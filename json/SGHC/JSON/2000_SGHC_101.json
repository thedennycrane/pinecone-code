        "(a) Loss of profits": "65. The plaintiffs have quantified their\n\nloss of profits by calculating that if the charter had taken place they would have earned\n\na total of US$663,617 as freight for cargo carried between the various ports of the\n\nintended voyage and as against that they would have incurred expenses of US$523,153\n\nleaving them a net profit of US$140,464. The details of these calculations are set out in\n\na costing projection prepared by Captain Wan on or about 13 March 1997 and annexed as an\n\nexhibit to his supplementary affidavit of evidence-in-chief.66. The defendants submitted that there\n\nwas no causal connection between their breach of contract and the plaintiffs’ alleged\n\nloss. They relied on the fact that by Captain Wan’s evidence it appeared that the\n\nplaintiffs had started booking cargoes for the intended voyage as early as a month before\n\nits intended commencement. By so doing, the plaintiffs they said, bore the commercial risk\n\nof things going wrong for example if they were unable to find a vessel to carry the\n\ncargoes. Thus the breach of contract was not the effective cause of the plaintiffs’\n\nloss. I am not able to accept that argument.67. As the plaintiffs submitted, it is\n\noften necessary for charterers to open bookings for cargo prior to the intended voyage so\n\nthat they will know what type and size of vessel is required and also the profitability of\n\nthe intended voyage. Secondly, the fact that the plaintiffs here started looking for cargo\n\na month or so before fixing theEver Wealthydoes not mean that their loss was not\n\ndue to the defendants’ default. Once theEver Wealthywas fixed, the\n\nplaintiffs would have organised their schedules around that vessel and would have ceased\n\ntheir efforts to find another vessel to carry the cargo that they had managed to book.\n\nWhen the defendants failed to deliver theEver Wealthythe plaintiffs had to start\n\nlooking for a carrier from scratch and many of their shippers were not willing to wait\n\ntill they found one. As Captain Wan testified, they lost cargo as a result of the\n\ndefendants’ default and in my judgment, as long as they were able to prove that this\n\ncargo had been fixed with them and was intended to be shipped on theEver Wealthythey would be entitled to recover for damages sustained when that shipment could not take\n\nplace. As far as the quantum of damages recoverable is concerned, this would have to be\n\ncalculated based on the proved freight rates as against the proved expenses.68. According to Captain Wan, the\n\nfollowing cargoes were booked with the plaintiffs to be loaded on the vessel:PARTICULARSS/NoPortsCargo detailsQuantityFrt/Rate1.Port KelangTimber1,000cbmUS$62.00/cbm2.Port KelangTimber500cbmUS$70.00/cbm3.Port KinabaluTimber813cbmUS$95.00/cbm4TernateTimber783cbmUS$95.00/cbm5.CeramTimber380cbmUS$95.00/cbm6.InchonSteel coils978mtUS$70.00/mt7.InchonSteel coils958mtUS$30.00/mt8.KaohsiungSteel\n\n      products1,167mtUS$72.40/mt9.KaohsiungYacht380cbmUS$45.00/cbm10.KuchingSteel coils400mtUS$65.00/mt11.KuchingTimber100cbmUS$95.00/cbm12.KuchingSteel pipes238mtUS$65.00/mt13.SingaporeDrill pipes400mtUS$85.00/mt14.SingaporeCopper slag3,000mtUS$22.50/mt15.JambiPlywood500cbmUS$80.00/cbm16.TernatePlywood85cbmUS$65.00/cbm69. The defendants challenged the\n\nplaintiffs’ assertion that they had the cargo listed above fixed for loading on the\n\nvessel. This was because in many cases the plaintiffs were unable to produce documents\n\nevidencing the fixture and/or the freight rate applicable. It should be noted, however,\n\nthat on 11 March 1997, the plaintiffs had sent detailed loading and sailing instructions\n\nto the master of the vessel. These instructions mentioned all the loading and discharging\n\nports and all the cargoes which are set out in the table in para 69. It therefore provides\n\nsome circumstantial evidence that at the material time the plaintiffs expected to load\n\nthose cargoes on theEver Wealthy.70. The plaintiffs’ problem is that\n\nin respect of many of the shipments they had no documentation other than the letter of\n\ninstructions to the master to indicate that the cargo referred to in those shipments would\n\nactually be loaded on the vessel. The plaintiffs explained that this was because many\n\nfixtures were concluded by telephone. They also said that they were not able to call the\n\nparties who had made those fixtures with them because it would have cost them an amount\n\nthat would have been unreasonable in the circumstances and/or would have led to delay.\n\nSuch difficulties might help in the admission of documents but they provide no help when\n\nit comes to establishing an oral contract. The plaintiffs have the burden of proving the\n\nexistence of legally enforceable contracts for the shipment of these various cargoes and\n\nthis can only be done by the production of the contract document, where it is written, or\n\nthe other party to the contract, where the contract was made verbally. If no such evidence\n\nis made available to the court, then the court has no basis on which to find that such\n\ncontracts existed notwithstanding the circumstantial evidence of the plaintiffs’\n\nbelief that the persons with whom they dealt were actually going to ship with them. Due to\n\nthe differing evidential positions with regard to the various shipments, it is necessary\n\nto deal with each shipment in turn in order to see whether the plaintiffs have succeeded\n\nin establishing the existence of the relevant contract.Shipment no. 171. This shipment involved 1,000 cubic\n\nmetres of timber from Port Kelang. The freight rate was US$62 per cubic metre. In support\n\nof the shipment, the plaintiffs produced the copy of a liner booking note between\n\nthemselves and a company called Scan-Trans Shipping & Chartering Sdn Bhd dated 13\n\nMarch 1997. The defendants’ objection to this was that the other party to the\n\ncontract was not called to confirm its issue of the document.72. The plaintiffs’ response was that\n\nthey had the letter to the master as corroboration of the shipment and that calling their\n\nshipper to Singapore to support their cargo booking would have involved unreasonable\n\nexpense as compared to the amount of the cargo booked. They submitted that the court\n\nshould admit the booking note as evidence under s 32(b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) as\n\nbeing a statement made in the ordinary course of business. They also relied on the case ofMohsin Abdullah Alesayi v Brooks Exim Pte Ltd[1993] 3 SLR 433where the court\n\nadmitted in evidence certain cash receipts although the party relying on them did not call\n\nthe staff members who issued them because those particular persons could not be found at\n\nthe time of the trial. Whilst in this case the fixture involved 1,000 tons of cargo and\n\nwould have earned the plaintiffs approximately US$62,000 in terms of freight so that the\n\nexpense of calling a witness from Malaysia would not have been disproportionate to the\n\nvalue of the evidence, I note that the plaintiffs had no way of compelling the\n\nwitness’ attendance since he was out of the jurisdiction and they had no leverage\n\nwith which to persuade a foreign witness to disrupt his normal business to attend a court\n\ncase in which he had no interest. In these circumstances, I consider the booking note\n\nadmissible under s 32(b) of the Act and therefore that this shipment has been proved.Shipment no. 273. This involved the shipment of 500\n\ncubic metres of timber from Port Kelang at US$70 per cubic metre. The name of the shipper\n\nis not known. The plaintiffs were unable to produce any document evidencing this fixture.\n\nIt was one of those allegedly made by telephone. The oral evidence of Captain Wan is not\n\nsufficient to prove it because his belief that the cargo would have been loaded had the\n\nvessel called at Port Kelang could not in itself convince the court that the plaintiffs\n\nwould have had a legal right to call on the shipper to ship or to claim damages against\n\nthem for non-shipment.Shipment no. 374. This involved a shipment of 813 cubic\n\nmetres of timber from Kota Kinabalu at a rate of US$95 per cubic metre. In court Captain\n\nWan said that this booking was evidenced by a freight statement forwarded to the\n\nplaintiffs by their agent in Kota Kinabalu in respect of cargo shipped onm.v. Zilina.\n\nAccording to Captain Wan, them.v. Zilinawas the substitute vessel that the\n\nplaintiffs employed for the shipment of some of the cargo that had originally been\n\nintended for theEver Wealthy. The defendants’ objection to this document was\n\nthat it did not relate to theEver Wealthyand also no one was called to prove it.\n\nI admit this document under s 32(b) of the Act on the same basis as the booking note for\n\nthe first shipment. I also accept that this document establishes the booking and the\n\nfreight rate for the third shipment although it refers to them.v. Zilinabecause\n\nCaptain Wan’s evidence as to his original intentions for this cargo are corroborated\n\nby 11 March letter and in due course the cargo was sent to the original destination for\n\nwhich it was intended. This booking has been proved.Shipment no. 475. This shipment involved 783 cubic\n\nmetres of timber to be carried from Ternate at a freight rate of US$95 per cubic metre.\n\nThe shipper of the cargo was Auspine International Pte Ltd (‘Auspine’). As\n\nevidence of the shipment, the plaintiffs produced a document prepared by the shipper\n\nsetting out the details of this cargo that it was intending to ship to Melbourne and\n\nBrisbane by theEver Wealthyas well as correspondence sent by Auspine to its\n\nshipper in Ternate. The plaintiffs also called Mr Tay Chin Joo who was employed as a\n\nmanager by Auspine. He confirmed that he had prepared all the documents in court relating\n\nto the Ternate shipment including the document containing the cargo details. Mr Tay stated\n\nthat once his company got the name of the intended carrying vessel, it would prepare a\n\nsummary of the cargo to be shipped and fax that summary to its various suppliers to tell\n\nthem to load their cargo onto the vessel. The document produced in court had been sent out\n\nby Auspine in March 1997 to its various suppliers of timber in Indonesia to instruct them\n\nto load the parcels of timber onto theEver Wealthy.76. Mr Tay further testified that when theEver Wealthydid not arrive, Auspine had looked for a substitute vessel and had\n\nmanaged to ship one parcel of cargo on that substitute. The rest had been shipped out on\n\nother vessels including a parcel on them.v. Zilina. The defendants submitted that\n\nI should not accept Mr Tay’s evidence because he did not produce the documents from\n\nhis suppliers that he used to prepare his instructions. This argument is specious. Mr Tay\n\nas a representative of the shipper, an independent party, confirmed that the shipper had\n\nagreed to ship shipment no. 4 aboardEver Wealthyand produced a contemporaneous\n\ndocument showing how the shipper had acted on that contract. That was all the proof I\n\nrequired. The defendants also submitted that the freight rate had not been proven as Mr\n\nTay did not testify on the applicable freight rate. In this respect I accept Captain\n\nWan’s evidence that the freight for this voyage was the same as that which the\n\nplaintiffs had previously charged Auspine for carriage of timber from Ceram to Melbourne\n\nand Brisbane as evidenced by a freight invoice dated 4 February 1997. The defendants did\n\nnot produce any evidence that that was an exorbitant or even an unusual freight rate for\n\nthe voyage in question. I therefore find this shipment proved.Shipment no. 577. This was another shipment of timber by\n\nAuspine. The port of loading was Ceram. The quantity was 380 cubic metres and the freight\n\nrate was US$95 per cubic metre. In this regard, the plaintiffs produced a letter written\n\nby Mr Tay to his agent in Jakarta informing the latter that theEver Wealthywould\n\narrive in Ceram around 30 March to load Auspine’s orders for March shipment. When Mr\n\nTay was in court, he confirmed preparing this letter and his evidence was not challenged.\n\nI find this shipment proved.Shipment no. 678. This was a shipment of 978 metric tons\n\nof steel coils from Inchon to Brisbane at a freight rate of US$70 per metric ton. The\n\ndefendants conceded that the booking had been proved by the plaintiffs but argued that the\n\nfreight rate had not since none of the documents relied on specified the rate for the\n\nvoyage. I notice, however, that the message to the plaintiffs from their booking agents in\n\nKorea confirming the bookings did mention that Dongbu Steel which was the supplier of\n\nsteel coils wanted to ship an additional 63 metric tons of this cargo to Brisbane and\n\nwould be charged US$65 per metric ton for the same. There is therefore evidence at least\n\nof a freight rate of US$65 per metric ton which I accept. This shipment has been proved at\n\na rate of US$65 per metric ton.Shipment no. 779. This was a shipment of 958 metric tons\n\nof steel coils from Inchon at a rate of US$30 per metric ton. The defendants accept that\n\nthe booking was made but quarrel with the rate. Once again, I note that in the booking\n\nagents’ fax of 11 March 1997 to the plaintiffs the agents mentioned a proposed rate\n\nof US$30 per metric ton for this shipment from Inchon to Kuching and asked whether that\n\nrate was correct. I accept the plaintiffs’ evidence that that was the correct rate\n\nfor that shipment. This shipment has been proved.Shipment no. 880. This was a shipment of 1,167 metric\n\ntons of steel products from Kaoshiung at a rate of US$72.40 per metric ton. The plaintiffs\n\nrelied on a fax from Fantai dated 13 March confirming the shipment. Mr Rando Lee confirmed\n\nthat that fax was from Fantai and that the Mr YH Chen named in it as the sender of the fax\n\nwas Fantai’s shipping general manager. He identified the document as being a booking\n\nlist sent out for the purpose of booking space on theEver Wealthy. Under\n\ncross-examination, he was not able to remember whether the plaintiffs had responded to\n\nconfirm the booking. The defendants submitted that he was unable to prove the document. I\n\ndisagree. Mr Lee’s evidence was sufficient to establish that his company had desired\n\nto ship the particular cargo on board theEver Wealthyand had booked the space.\n\nThere was no evidence that the plaintiffs had not accepted this booking. Indeed, from\n\ntheir message to the master of the vessel, it was clear that they expected the vessel to\n\nload that cargo in Kaoshiung.81. The only problem relates to the\n\nfreight rate. There is no documentary evidence on the exact rate charged for this booking\n\nnor was Mr Lee asked about it. Captain Wan’s evidence was that the plaintiffs’\n\nshipping service from Asia to Australia was a service run on a monthly basis from 1991 or\n\n1992 when he was working at Pine Seas Maritime. When Pine Seas stopped that service,\n\nCaptain Wan had started the plaintiff company to fill the gap and all agents, customers\n\nand consignees were familiar with the service and the rates charged. He produced documents\n\nshowing that in January 1997 he had charged US$75 per metric ton for steel cargo shipped\n\nfrom Kaoshiung to ports in Australia. I accept the plaintiffs’ evidence. I find it\n\nprobable that the rate charged by the plaintiffs for this shipment was the usual rate.\n\nThis shipment has been proved.Shipment no. 982. This was a shipment of a yacht from\n\nKaoshiung to Sydney. The rate charged was apparently US$45 per cubic metric for 380 cubic\n\nmetres. This booking was proved by the same document emanating from Fantai as that related\n\nto the steel cargo. There is, however, no evidence at all on the applicable rate. I\n\ntherefore find that the plaintiffs have not proved their loss in respect of this shipment.Shipment no. 1083. This was a shipment of 400 metric tons\n\nof steel coils from Kuching to Australia at a rate of US$65 per metric ton. The shippers\n\nof this cargo were Delta Bond and/or Pacific Sheet & Coil. As proof, the plaintiffs\n\nproduced a letter dated 20 February 1997 from Delta Bond stating that Pacific Sheet &\n\nCoil were hoping to have 1,000 metric tons of steel coil available to ship to Australia\n\nfrom Kuching in March 1997. There was another letter dated 19 March 1997 from Pacific\n\nSheet & Coil to Delta Bond stating that because of the poor performance of Delta Bond\n\n(ie the non-showing of theEver Wealthy), Pacific Sheet & Coil had 1,800 metric\n\ntons of goods sitting at Inchon and 400 metric tons of goods sitting at Kuching. The\n\nletter also asked whether alternative shipping arrangements should be made for the cargo\n\nthat had been waiting for theEver Wealthy. Mr Faulkner of Delta Bond who had sent\n\nout the first letter and received the second was called as a witness and he confirmed\n\nhaving sent out correspondence to the plaintiffs on behalf of Delta Bond in relation to\n\nshipments by Pacific Sheet & Coil. There was also a letter from the plaintiffs to\n\nDelta Bond for onward transmission to Pacific Steel & Coil explaining that they were\n\nhaving difficulty trying to get a substitute vessel to carry the 400 metric tons from\n\nKuching. All in all, I am satisfied that there was a booking for the carriage of this\n\ncargo by theEver Wealthy. Unfortunately, there is no evidence to support the\n\nfreight rate charged by the plaintiffs. I therefore hold that the plaintiffs have not\n\nproved their loss.Shipment no. 1184. This was a shipment of 100 cubic\n\nmetres of timber cargo from Kuching at US$95 per cubic metre. There are no documents to\n\nsupport this shipment. The plaintiffs submitted that Mr Faulkner was called to prove the\n\nshipment but I cannot find anything in his evidence that talks about shipment of timber\n\nfrom Kuching either in relation to quantity or in relation to rate. Such mention as there\n\nwas of timber in Mr Faulkner’s fax of 26 February 1997 appears to have been purely\n\nexploratory. The plaintiffs have not proved this shipment.Shipment no. 1285. This was a shipment of 238 metric tons\n\nof steel pipes at US$65 per metric ton from Kuching for Delta Bond. Once again the\n\nplaintiffs relied on Mr Faulkner’s evidence to prove this booking. Nothing was\n\nmentioned about this shipment in his oral evidence and his letter of 26 February 1997 was\n\nvague with no mention of quantity or rate. The plaintiffs have not proved this shipment.Shipment no. 1386. This was a shipment of 400 metric tons\n\nof drill pipes from Singapore at US$85 per metric ton. No documents were produced to\n\nsupport this shipment apart from the letter of instruction to the master. Neither was\n\nanyone called to testify that he had made this booking. This shipment has not been proved.Shipment no. 1487. This was a shipment of 3,000 metric\n\ntons of copper slag from Singapore at the rate of US$22.50 per metric ton. The plaintiffs\n\nproduced a copy of an unsigned Gencon charterparty dated 11 March 1997 purportedly made\n\nbetween Pan Abrasives Pte Ltd as charterers and themselves as disponent owner for the\n\ncarriage of this cargo from Singapore to Mackey. They did not call anyone from the\n\nprospective charterers’ office to confirm the fixture had actually been concluded\n\nalthough that company is a Singaporean company. Captain Wan, who testified that this\n\ndocument had been prepared by Eastport Shipbrokers in Singapore around 11 March 1997, said\n\nthat he had tried to contact the shipbrokers to give evidence. When he called their\n\noffice, however, he had been informed that the two gentlemen who had dealt with him were\n\nno longer with Eastport. One of them had gone to Japan and he did not know the whereabouts\n\nof the other one though this latter person was probably a local. It must be noted that the\n\nplaintiffs only tried to contact Eastport on the first day of this trial and, even though\n\nhearing was subsequently adjourned, no further attempts were made to call either Eastport\n\nor anyone from Pan Abrasives to confirm that there had been a concluded charter for the\n\ncarriage of the copper slag. The plaintiffs have not proved this charter.Shipment no. 1588. This was a shipment of 500 cubic\n\nmetres of plywood from Jambi at US$80 per cubic metre to be undertaken on behalf of\n\nAuspine. The documents adduced by the plaintiffs and supported by Mr Tay’s evidence\n\nshow that this booking was made. As for the freight rate, although there is nothing in the\n\ndocuments which directly supports the rate which the plaintiffs say had been agreed, the\n\ndocuments also show a rate of US$95 per cubic metre for carriage of timber from Ternate to\n\nAustralian ports. In view of that, US$80 per cubic metre from Jambi which is further away\n\nfrom Australia than Ternate would seem reasonable. The plaintiffs have proved this\n\nshipment.",
        "Shipment no. 16": "89. This is another shipment undertaken on\n\nbehalf of Auspine from Ternate. It is of 85 cubic metres of plywood for which the\n\nplaintiffs charged US$65 per cubic metre. This booking was proved by Mr Tay’s\n\nevidence and documents which supported the plaintiffs’ stand. As for the freight\n\nrate, the position is the same as that regarding shipment no. 15. I consider US$65 per\n\ncubic metre reasonable in the circumstances. The plaintiffs have proved their loss.Conclusion on loss of profits90. The plaintiffs have proved the\n\nfollowing shipments with the following freight income:Shipment no.Freight (US$)162,000377,235474,385536,100663,570728,740884,490.801540,000165,525__________Total472,045.80=========91. This means that the plaintiffs have\n\nproved that had the charter of theEver Wealthyproceeded, they would have earned\n\nUS$472,045.80 as freight. That would have been their gross income from the charter. The\n\nplaintiffs had, however, also calculated that in order to earn this freight, they would\n\nhave had to spend US$523,153. This figure comprised charter hire, cost of fuel, port\n\ncharges, loading/discharging costs and various miscellaneous charges. As their admitted\n\ncosts exceed their proved income, the plaintiffs have not proved that they would have\n\nsuffered any loss of profits by reason of the defendants’ breach of contract.Other items of the plaintiffs’\n\nclaim92. The next item of the plaintiffs’\n\nclaim is US$6,607.37 which they spent in order to send cargoes booked with them on another\n\nvessel from Inchon to Kuching. The substitute vessel wasAIS MAMASand the\n\nplaintiffs produced documents issued by various companies in Korea including their agent\n\nTai Young Shipping Co., Ltd to substantiate these costs. The defendants object to the sum\n\non the basis that the plaintiffs have not proved that the original freight rate for this\n\ncargo was US$30 per metric ton. I have, however, accepted the plaintiffs’ evidence in\n\nthis regard and the objection therefore has no further weight. I find that the plaintiffs\n\nhave proved this item of expense and accordingly award them US$6,607.37.93. The plaintiffs also incurred other\n\ncosts in relation to the substitute arrangements for the shipment of this cargo comprising\n\nbill of lading surrender fees, courier service charges and booking commission. These total\n\nUS$723.67. These expenses were evidenced by a fax dated 28 March from Tai Young Shipping\n\nCo., Ltd to the plaintiffs which said that these were expenses incurred as a result of the\n\nwithdrawal of theEver Wealthyand the non-arrival of the vessel at Inchon. I\n\naccept that document as evidence on the basis of s 32(b) of the Act. Accordingly I award\n\nthis sum to the plaintiffs as well.94. The next claim is for US$1,000 being\n\ncommunication costs incurred by the plaintiffs and Southern Cross in communicating with\n\neach other and with Oldendorff and Pescadores. Whilst it is clear from the evidence that\n\nthere was a great deal of communication between these various parties, it has to be noted\n\nthat the plaintiffs’ claim is for the estimated costs that they incurred and not the\n\nactual costs. As the plaintiffs have not proved what their actual expenditure was on this\n\nitem, I cannot award it to them.95. The same objection must be made to the\n\nplaintiffs’ next claim which is for US$1,500 being their estimated communication\n\ncosts when they communicated with various port agents regarding space/cargo booking and\n\nthe vessel. This estimate has not been substantiated by any bills and must be rejected.96. Finally, the plaintiffs wish to\n\nrecover US$1,200 as being the fees of their Australian solicitors. They point out that the\n\ndefendants did receive a letter of demand from these solicitors and that was clear\n\nevidence of the legal expenses which the plaintiffs incurred by reason of the\n\ndefendants’ breach. The plaintiffs have not, however, produced any bill to show\n\neither the exact amount charged by their Australian solicitors or the work for which this\n\nsum was charged. The figure of US$1,200 is far too large to cover simply a letter of\n\ndemand. Therefore, the plaintiffs have not proved that the sum claimed relates directly to\n\nthe defendants’ breach of contract.",
        "Conclusion": "97. In the result, there will be judgment\n\nfor the plaintiffs in the sum of US$7,331.04 and interest thereon at 6% per annum from the\n\ndate of the writ. As the plaintiffs have not succeeded on the most substantial portion of\n\ntheir claim, however, some adjustment may have to be made in relation to costs. I will\n\nhear the parties on costs.JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
