        "The facts": "2\n\n        Sometime in late June 2000, the CPIB received a\n\nletter (‘the letter’) dated 27 June 2000, addressed to one Osman bin Ahmad, a\n\nSenior Special Investigator at the CPIB. The letter contained several allegations\n\nsurrounding officers from the Traffic Police, namely one Steven Tang (‘Steven’),\n\nthen Officer-in-Charge of the Transport Section (‘OC Transport’), and his\n\nsuperior DSP Loh Kim Hock (‘DSP Loh’) who was then the Head of Administration\n\n(‘Head Admin’). In particular, two of the allegations formed the subject matter\n\nof the first and second charges.3\n\n        The first allegation stated that at the Traffic\n\nPolice, Stevenbecame very close to present Head Admin\n\n  DSP Loh Kim Hock, by doing personal favours and errands for him. Being obligated, Loh Kim\n\n  Hock appointed him as OC Transport despite so many hues and cries from other staff of TP.\n\n  There were other competent officers for the post of OC Transport but were left out.The second allegation stated that:The present towing company namely Eng Bee\n\n  Chop is awarded contract every year by the present Head Admin Loh Kim Hock. We believe\n\n  there is something fishy.4\n\n        The back of the envelope containing the letter\n\nbore the name of one Paul Anthony (‘Paul’), who was another officer of the\n\nTraffic Police. This formed the subject of the third charge, in that the appellant, also a\n\nTraffic Police officer, had given misleading information to the CPIB, namely that one Paul\n\nAnthony had written the letter.",
        "Decision of the trial judge": "5\n\n        The trial judge was satisfied, based on the\n\nhandwriting analysis of document and handwriting examiner Yap Bei Sing (‘Yap’)\n\nas well as surrounding circumstances, that it was the appellant Ghalib who had written the\n\nletter. She accepted Yap’s expert opinion on the basis that he was able to\n\n\"conclusively\" say that it was Ghalib who had written the letter after finding\n\nthat the appellant’s normal and request specimen handwriting tallied with that in the\n\nletter. She found no reason to disagree with Yap, as this was a matter outside the\n\ntechnical competence of the court. Noting that Yap was an experienced expert who had\n\nexamined about 3000 cases, of which 85% comprised handwriting examination and signature\n\nverification, she was satisfied that his opinion was formed on the basis of sound\n\nreasoning as he had explained how he compared the letter against the handwriting of Paul\n\nand Ghalib. She also found him to be a reliable witness who had maintained neutrality and\n\nimpartiality in exercising his judgment, having readily admitted that document examination\n\nwas not an exact science but an opinion science and that there would be variations in a\n\nperson’s handwriting.6\n\n        The trial judge followed the decision of the\n\nCourt of Appeal inSaeng-Un Udom v PP[2001] 3 SLR 1which held that:the court should not, when confronted with\n\n  expert evidence, which is unopposed and appears not to be obviously lacking in\n\n  defensibility, reject it nevertheless and prefer to draw its own inferences. While the\n\n  court is not obliged to accept expert evidence by reason only that it is\n\n  unchallenged… if the court finds that the evidence is based on sound grounds and\n\n  supported by basic facts, it can do little else than to accept the evidence.7\n\n        She also looked at surrounding circumstances\n\nwhich indicated that the writer of the letter was more likely to be someone in the Traffic\n\nPolice because it was signed off by a \"group of police officers from TP\" and in\n\nfact the envelope bore the name of \"Paul Anthony\", an officer from the Traffic\n\nPolice. The writer must have been quite close to Paul because Paul testified that he was\n\nknown to his friends as \"Paul Anthony\". He must also have been quite familiar\n\nwith Steven, DSP Loh and the Traffic Police based on the contents of the letter. For\n\ninstance, he could allude to Steven’s prior posting at Security Branch, that he had\n\nresigned and subsequently rejoined the Police Force, that he was in Transport Unit and was\n\npromoted to OC Transport when DSP Loh was Head Admin, and that Eng Bee Chop had been the\n\ntowing contractors of the Traffic Police for many years. An outsider would not have\n\nreadily known this.8\n\n        In addition, the trial judge was of the opinion\n\nthat the writer must have been aggrieved by Steven’s promotion to OC Transport which\n\noccurred in June 2000, around the time when the letter was written, and he would more\n\nprobably than not be someone who was working with Steven or under him in the same\n\ndepartment and who did not get along with him. The writer also must have borne a grudge\n\nagainst DSP Loh because of the allegation of impropriety in the letter. In this respect,\n\nPaul and Ghalib had openly admitted in their testimonies to being unhappy with and bearing\n\na grudge against DSP Loh and Steven. The trial judge ruled out Paul as the culprit on the\n\nbasis of Yap’s expert opinion as well as the reasoning that Paul would not have\n\nblatantly used his name in writing the letter especially when he had already been\n\ninvestigated and charged previously for filing an anonymous complaint. Instead, she was\n\nsatisfied that Ghalib was the writer of the letter as it was dated 27 June 2000, shortly\n\nafter Ghalib failed in his delivery duties during the National Day rehearsals on 24 June\n\n2000 and shortly after DSP Loh told Ghalib on 26 June 2000 that formal investigations\n\nwould be carried out to take disciplinary action against him. Moreover, the letter was\n\nposted at Tanjong Pagar, which according to DSP Loh, was near Ghalib’s residence and\n\nit was addressed to a CPIB officer known to Ghalib.9\n\n        As such, she was satisfied that Ghalib was the\n\nwriter of the letter and he had knowingly given misleading information to the CPIB. She\n\nheld him guilty on the third charge.10\n\n        As for the first charge, the trial judge was of\n\nthe opinion that the material information which was misleading was not whether there was\n\nmuch hue and cry over Steven’s appointment but rather the allegation that DSP Loh had\n\nappointed Steven as OC Transport because he was obligated to Steven for running personal\n\nerrands and favours. Thus although she accepted that there was dissatisfaction among some\n\nof the officers on Steven’s appointment and he was not popular among certain\n\nquarters, she held that the information in the letter was nevertheless misleading as there\n\nwas no evidence that Steven had done personal favours and errands for DSP Loh nor that\n\nthere was any impropriety in DSP Loh’s appointment of Steven as OC Transport.11\n\n        With regards to Ghalib’s and Paul’s\n\naccusations that Steven was hanging pictures and painting carpark lots as a personal\n\nfavour to DSP Loh during the Traffic Police’s shift to its new premises at Ubi\n\nAvenue, the trial judge accepted that it was part of Steven’s administrative duties\n\nto carry out these tasks along with other officers and noted that this was done in the\n\nopen and not surreptitiously. She rejected Paul’s testimony that Steven had informed\n\nhim that he was running personal errands for DSP Loh in order to get a promotion. This was\n\ndone on the basis of Steven’s own denial and her opinion that it would have been\n\nfoolish of Steven to have blatantly declared this to anyone, especially to his\n\nsubordinate, even if he indeed had such an ulterior intent. She bore in mind the fact that\n\nPaul had an axe to grind as he was still angry with DSP Loh and Steven whom he regarded as\n\nbeing responsible for his dismissal from the Police Force and treated his testimony with\n\ncaution. Ghalib was also unable to give details of the alleged personal favours and\n\nclaimed to have merely heard this from Paul. She was further convinced that DSP Loh had\n\nappointed Steven on merit as it was the former OC Transport SSgt Chong Kok Chong\n\n(‘Chong’) and not DSP Loh who recommended Steven for the promotion and DSP Loh\n\neven instructed Steven and the then Asst OC Transport SSgt Mohd Noh (‘Mohd Noh’)\n\nto reverse appointments upon the latter’s promotion to staff sergeant. This was\n\nsupported by Steven’s testimony.12\n\n        The trial judge went on to find that Ghalib had\n\nfulfilled themens rearequirement of the offence in that he clearly knew the\n\nallegations to be misleading. This was due to the fact that Ghalib had said he was very\n\nsure and \"felt very strongly\" that the allegations were true, but he could not\n\ngive a convincing explanation for this. He alleged that he had heard \"a lot of\"\n\nofficers were unhappy with Steven’s promotion but did not name these officers. He\n\nthen said that he heard about Steven doing personal favours for DSP Loh from only two\n\npersons, namely Paul and another colleague Lum Kar Kit (‘Lum’), but again could\n\nnot elaborate on what those personal favours and errands were. There was no evidence from\n\nLum on this at all and the trial judge had earlier rejected Paul’s testimony that\n\nSteven had openly informed him that he was running personal errands for DSP Loh in order\n\nto get his promotion. As such, she held that the prosecution had proved its case beyond\n\nreasonable doubt on the first charge.13\n\n        The trial judge again found no merit in the\n\nsecond charge. She accepted the testimonies of all the prosecution witnesses on the tender\n\nprocess and award since they were consistent and not challenged by the defence. DSP Loh\n\nwas neither a part of the evaluation committee nor the Tender Board. Though he was the one\n\nwho ultimately endorsed the former’s recommendation, he had to have some proper basis\n\nfor so doing. There was no evidence to show any inducement or favour given by Eng Bee Chop\n\nto anyone in order to obtain the contract year after year. The tender was also an open one\n\nwith no restrictions on related companies tendering, so it did not matter that two of the\n\nthree tenderers in 2000 were related companies. Most importantly, the trial judge noted\n\nthat as DSP Loh became Head Admin only in June 1999 and was involved in only one tender\n\nprocess, it could not be said that Eng Bee Chop was awarded the contract every year by DSP\n\nLoh.14\n\n        She further found that Ghalib knew this\n\ninformation to be misleading and had no basis for making such an allegation. He would have\n\nknown that DSP Loh only became Head Admin in June 1999, as prior to this, he was serving\n\nin the Gurkha Contingent, which was not part of the Traffic Police. Moreover, although\n\nGhalib did not know how the tenders were evaluated and awarded, he knew that Eng Bee Chop\n\nhad been the Traffic Police’s towing contractors for many years, even before DSP Loh\n\njoined the Traffic Police. Thus he must have known that it was impossible for DSP Loh to\n\nhave awarded the towing contract every year to Eng Bee Chop and, as such, that there could\n\nnot be anything \"fishy\" about DSP Loh’s dealings with Eng Bee Chop. Hence\n\nshe found that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt on the second\n\ncharge.",
        "The appeal against conviction": "15\n\n        The appeal against conviction was based on the\n\nground that the trial judge had erred in her finding of facts by wrongly accepting or\n\nrejecting certain testimonies at trial. However the appellate court, if it wishes to\n\nreverse the trial judge’s decision, must not merely entertain doubts as to whether\n\nthe decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong:PP v Azman binAbdullah[1998] 2 SLR 704.",
        "(a) Accepting that it was the appellant\n\nwho had written the letter and rejecting Lum’s evidence": "16\n\n        There appeared to me no reason why the trial\n\njudge should have rejected Yap’s expert opinion that it was Ghalib who wrote the\n\nletter. The trial judge had already accepted that document examination was not an exact\n\nscience but an opinion science and there would be variations in a person’s\n\nhandwriting. However, she considered this admission on Yap’s part to be a sign of his\n\nneutrality and impartiality and found him to be a reliable witness. In addition, she was\n\nalso correct in following the decision ofSaeng-Un Udom v PPand not rejecting\n\nYap’s uncontested expert testimony.17\n\n        I also found that the trial judge was correct\n\nin treating Lum’s testimony regarding the handwriting in the letter with caution,\n\ngiven the manner in which he vacillated during his testimony. He first claimed familiarity\n\nwith Ghalib’s handwriting and then failed to recognise samples of it. When told that\n\none of the handwriting samples belonged to Ghalib, Lum then claimed that he could now\n\nrecognise the handwriting by reading the contents of the sample, whereas he had earlier\n\nonly \"glance(d) through\" the document. The trial judge considered that Lum had\n\nin fact taken some time with the document and questioned Lum on this. Lum then conceded\n\nthat he in fact could not recognise Ghalib’s handwriting \"at a glance\".\n\nGiven this inconsistency, the court could not be expected to rely on Lum’s testimony.",
        "(b) Rejecting Paul’s testimony that\n\nSteven had informed him that he was running personal errands for DSP Loh in order to get\n\nhis promotion": "18\n\n        The trial judge had already given clear reasons\n\nfor rejecting Paul’s testimony on this. First, she found Paul to be a partial witness\n\nas a result of his grudge against DSP Loh and Steven whom he regarded as being responsible\n\nfor his dismissal from the Police Force. Secondly, she reasoned that it would be foolish\n\nof Steven to declare such an intention to anyone, let alone a subordinate. Finally, she\n\npaid careful attention to the testimonies of the witnesses concerning the errands in\n\nquestion, namely the painting of carpark lots and the hanging of pictures on the wall, and\n\ncame to the conclusion that they were within the official scope of Steven’s work and\n\nwere done in full view of other officers. In my opinion, this finding of fact could not be\n\nsaid to be plainly wrong.",
        "(c) Concluding that there was no reason\n\nfor DSP Loh to be ‘obligated’ to Steven and to promote him on this basis": "19\n\n        The trial judge had already considered all the\n\nevidence which showed that DSP Loh was not directly responsible for Steven’s\n\npromotion. Instead, it was Chong who admitted to having first recommended Steven. Another\n\nwitness, SSI Pong Siang Yin (‘SSI Pong’), who was Steven’s immediate\n\nsupervisor and DSP Loh’s subordinate, also concurred with the promotion. There were\n\nalso sufficient and convincing reasons for promoting Steven instead of Mohd Noh, the other\n\ncandidate whom Paul and Ghalib favoured. Steven had better computer skills and Mohd Noh\n\nwas reluctant to assume a leadership post. Even the defence witnesses conceded that Steven\n\nwas suitable for the appointment. Most importantly, DSP Loh lacked motive to promote\n\nSteven at the risk of corruption charges since Steven had apparently done no more than to\n\npaint carpark lots and hang up paintings for him. Besides the fact that they are, even\n\nfrom an outsider’s point of view, administrative duties within the normal scope of a\n\npolice officer’s job, they also do not benefit DSP Loh in any apparent manner. In the\n\nabsence of other evidence of the alleged \"personal errands or favours\", I found\n\nthat the trial judge was not wrong to hold that there was no reason for DSP Loh to promote\n\nSteven because he was obligated to him.",
        "(d) Concluding that the appellant had\n\ndownplayed his role and had behaved out of line and was told to put on full uniform when\n\nperforming his duties": "20\n\n        Counsel’s basis for this point of appeal\n\nwas that p 135 of the Notes of Evidence suggested that Ghalib was told to put on full\n\nuniform only after DSP Loh was called up for investigation by the CPIB. The prosecution\n\nrebutted this by showing that the Notes of Evidence had in fact revealed that the\n\nrecommendation for Ghalib to put on full uniform came as early as when Chong was still the\n\nTransport OC. I accepted the prosecution’s submission on this matter and came to the\n\nconclusion that Ghalib had borne a grudge against his superiors as a result of this\n\nrecommendation even before DSP Loh was investigated by the CPIB and before the letter was\n\nwritten, thus providing him the motive to write a letter to frame his superiors.21\n\n        In addition, there were many witnesses\n\ntestifying to Ghalib’s poor work performance. The trial judge found SSI Pong, Mohd\n\nNoh and Chong to be truthful, credible and consistent witnesses who had nothing to gain\n\nfrom their testimony as they were not implicated in any way. Moreover, she noted that DSP\n\nLoh was no longer SSI Pong’s and Mohd Noh’s superior at the Traffic Police at\n\nthe time of this case and hence they had nothing to fear from giving unfavourable\n\ntestimonies against DSP Loh or Steven who had also left the police force. Chong also said\n\nthat he was a good friend of Ghalib and SSI Pong testified that she had tried counselling\n\nGhalib to change his ways instead of taking drastic action against him. This showed that\n\nthey bore no grudges against Ghalib. As for DSP Loh and Steven, the trial judge was also\n\nof the view that they were reliable and honest, as their testimonies with regard to\n\nmaterial matters, such as the allegations contained in the letter as well as Ghalib’s\n\nwork attitude were largely supported by the other witnesses. All these considerations\n\nshowed that the trial judge was not wrong in accepting that Ghalib had a very poor work\n\nattitude.",
        "(e) Concluding that the appellant was a\n\n\"dishonest and evasive\" witness": "22\n\n        The trial judge found Ghalib to be a dishonest\n\nand evasive witness because he was unable to elaborate on what the alleged personal\n\nfavours and errands were despite feeling \"very strongly\" that the allegations\n\nwere true. He also kept changing his answers when queried as to the source of this\n\ninformation. In addition, he claimed to be a model worker who did not pose any problems to\n\nhis superiors, was always punctual, did all duties assigned to him and never attended any\n\ncounselling sessions. This was contradicted by Steven, Chong, SSI Pong and DSP Loh. Even\n\nLum, the defence witness, testified that Ghalib did come to work late and leave early,\n\nalbeit giving reasons for so doing, and was told to put on full uniform when performing\n\nhis duties. In fact, after Ghalib stated categorically that he was a good worker, he then\n\nreluctantly admitted that he had attended counselling sessions with SSI Pong and said that\n\nChong had also given him \"friendly advice\". Moreover, it was clear that he was\n\nunhappy with Steven and DSP Loh, the two implicated by the allegations in the letter and\n\nthis could have an impact on the partiality of his statement. I found that the trial\n\njudge’s reasons fully supported her findings and she had the opportunity to observe\n\nthe demeanour of the witnesses before coming to this conclusion.",
        "(f) Rejecting or ignoring evidence that\n\nthere were \"hues and cries\" surrounding Steven Tang’s appointment": "23\n\n        I found this point of appeal to be without\n\nbasis because in para 58 of the trial judge’s Grounds of Decision, it was clearly\n\nexplained that \"the material information that was misleading was not whether there\n\nwas much \"hue and cry\" on Steven’s appointment or whether other competent\n\nofficers had been left out. Rather the crux of the allegation which was misleading was\n\nthat DSP Loh had appointed Steven as OC Transport because DSP Loh was obligated to him for\n\nrunning personal favours and errands, and not because Steven was qualified for the\n\npost.\" First of all, this meant that the trial judge did not ignore the fact of\n\n\"hues and cries\" surrounding Steven’s promotion. Secondly, as the trial\n\njudge pointed out, that was not what was misleading. Whether it was true or not would not\n\nhave made a difference to Ghalib’s charge because what he was charged for was\n\nknowingly providing false or misleading information regarding a Prevention of Corruption\n\nAct offence. It was the motive behind Steven’s promotion that could lead to such an\n\noffence, not the response to his promotion. Whether there were \"hues and cries\"\n\nsurrounding someone’s promotion does not necessarily have a bearing on whether that\n\nperson was promoted by corrupt means, since the person who is a suitable candidate to the\n\nboss may not be a suitable candidate to the subordinates and such is a fact of life.",
        "(g) Not giving sufficient weight to the\n\nfact that DSP Loh ultimately endorsed the evaluation report and that it would have been\n\nsufficient to influence the Evaluation Committee to award the contract in Eng Bee\n\nChop’s favour": "24\n\n        I dismissed this point of appeal for two\n\nreasons: first, it was an undisputed fact that DSP Loh had been involved in no more than\n\none tender and it was therefore misleading anyway for the letter to allege that he awarded\n\nEng Bee Chop towing contracts every year. Secondly, the trial judge had carefully\n\nconsidered the whole tendering process and found that DSP Loh, for that one and only\n\ntender he was involved in, was not on either the tender evaluation committee nor the\n\nTender Board, and therefore played no more than a minimal role. To say that he could have\n\ninfluenced the tender process was to regard the whole tender procedure, specially put in\n\nplace by the Police Force to prevent any one individual from exercising substantial\n\ninfluence, as ineffectual. There was no evidence that this was so and thus I gave this\n\npoint no weight.",
        "(h) Failing to adequately consider the\n\nimplications when Travelwide and Eng Bee Recovery tendered for the same contract and that\n\nRichard Tan is in charge of both companies": "25\n\n        It was clear that there was nothing in the\n\ntender exercise that precluded related companies from tendering for the same contract. It\n\nwas also not shown what the \"implications\" were. The fact that these two related\n\ncompanies had tendered for the same contract was not relevant to DSP Loh and in any case\n\nthere was no indication that DSP Loh was aware of this fact. The defence counsel\n\nhighlighted SSI Pong’s testimony where she admitted to being surprised to learn that\n\ntwo of the tenderers were related companies but in the absence of any evidence showing\n\nthat this was against the tender rules, I could not attribute any corrupt motive behind\n\nthis fact.26\n\n        For the reasons given, I upheld the trial\n\njudge’s decision and dismissed the appeal against the appellant’s conviction.",
        "The appeal against sentence": "27\n\n        The sentence was for a term of six weeks’\n\nimprisonment per charge, with two sentences to run consecutively, thus totalling 12\n\nweeks’ imprisonment. Having regard to the maximum sentence of a fine not exceeding\n\n$10,000 or a term not exceeding one year’s imprisonment or both, this was a\n\ncomparatively light sentence. The trial judge bore in mind that this was a deliberate act\n\nby the appellant to falsely implicate another person of corrupt practices and was not done\n\nto absolve or protect the writer from some wrongdoing. Furthermore, the allegations were\n\nmade by a police officer, whose duty was to maintain law and order, against fellow police\n\nofficers. In addition, the envelope bore the name of another person and the effect was to\n\ncause great inconvenience to the CPIB in having to investigate not just the alleged person\n\ncomplained of but also the purported writer. The appellant had also claimed trial. The\n\ntrial judge felt the circumstances meant that a fine would have been inappropriate.\n\nHowever, she took into account the fact that Ghalib was a first offender and the three\n\ncharges related to the same letter.28\n\n        The trial judge considered the only High Court\n\nprecedent relating to the same offence –Balasundaram v PP[1996] 2 SLR 331– where the accused was sentenced to a term of three months’ imprisonment on one\n\ncharge, though the accused had antecedents. She also considered s 182 of the Penal Code\n\n(Cap 224), a fairly similar offence, and found the sentences ranging from two weeks’\n\nto four months’ imprisonment (Lai Oei Mun Jenny v PP[1993] 3 SLR 305;Madavi\n\nd/o Sethu Pillay v PP(MA 75 of 1993);Oh Chor Lan v PP(MA 410 of 1993);Kulandaivelu\n\nPalaniyappan v PP(MA 227 of 1996);Thirumalai Kumar v PP[1997] 3 SLR 434; andPP v Muhammad Baharuddin bin Amat(MA 20 of 1999)).29\n\n        The section under which Ghalib was charged was\n\nadded in July 1989 by the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act to update and tighten\n\nthe provisions because, as the then Minister for Law Prof S Jayakumar explained during the\n\nsecond reading of the Bill on 11 July 1989, previously persons who deliberately gave false\n\ninformation to the CPIB could only be prosecuted under s 182 of the Penal Code which\n\ncarried a maximum penalty of six month’s imprisonment or a fine of $10,000 or both.\n\nIt was felt that this penalty was insufficient to deter persons from deliberately giving\n\nfalse or misleading information to the CPIB. He felt that persons who commit such offences\n\nmust be subjected to greater penalties because \"their action can not only detract the\n\nCPIB in its investigations but can cause a great deal of harm to others\". Bearing in\n\nmind therefore that s 28 is for the very purpose of meting out a heavier sentence, it is\n\nunsurprising that the sentence in question, when compared against the spectrum of\n\nsentences under s 182 of the Penal Code, is on the higher end. I therefore found the\n\nsentence not manifestly excessive and saw no reason to interfere with the sentence imposed\n\nby the trial judge.",
        "Conclusion": "30\n\n        For the reasons stated above, I dismissed both\n\nthe appeals against conviction and sentence.",
