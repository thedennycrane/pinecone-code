        "Introduction": "1 This is the Plaintiff’sex parteapplication for an order that the Defendant’s interest in an immovable property be attached and taken in execution under a writ of seizure and sale (“WSS”). The Defendant and his wife hold this property as joint tenants. 2 The crux of the Plaintiff’s application is whether a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property is exigible to a WSS. This issue has divided the courts and academics alike. Nevertheless, based on the submissions before me, I only needed to resolve two issues to determine the Plaintiff’s application: (a) whether Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges, and (b) whether there are conflicting decisions by different High Court Judges regarding the exigibility of a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property by means of a WSS, such that an Assistant Registrar would be free to decide this matter by preferring one precedent over another. As I held that the answer to the first question was “yes”, and the answer to the second was “no”, I considered myself bound by the decisions inMalayan Banking Bhd v Focal Finance Ltd[1998] 3 SLR(R) 1008(“Focal Finance”)andChan Lung Kien v Chan Shwe Ching[2017] SGHC 136 (“Chan Lung Kien”) to hold that a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property is not exigible to a WSS. 3 On 8 November 2017, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s application. The Plaintiff has appealed against my decision, and I now set out my full grounds below.",
        "Brief Facts": "4 The Defendant and his wife are joint tenants of a condominium at 10 Pasir Ris Link (the “Property”). 5 The Plaintiff is a law firm that represented the Defendant in two High Court Suits – Suit No 244 of 2013 and Suit No 733 of 2014 (the “HC Suits”). On 24 October 2016, the Plaintiff ceased to act for the Defendant in the HC Suits. 6 The Defendant did not pay the Plaintiff’s legal fees for work done in the HC Suits. On 2 March 2017, the Plaintiff commenced Suit No 194 of 2017 (“Suit 194”) to recover outstanding legal fees of $394,254.14 from the Defendant. The Defendant did not enter an appearance in Suit 194, and on 9 June 2017, the Plaintiff entered judgment in default of appearance against the Defendant for the sum of $394,254.14 plus interest and costs. 7 The judgment debt in Suit 194 remains wholly unsatisfied. As a result, the Plaintiff applied under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) for an order that the Defendant’s interest in the Property be attached and taken in execution under a WSS.",
        "The Plaintiff’s Case": "8 The Plaintiff’s case is that a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property can be attached and taken in execution under a WSS. The Plaintiff relies on the decision inChan Shwe Ching v Leong Lai Yee[2015] 5 SLR 295 (“Chan Shwe Ching”), where Edmund Leow JC made anex parteorder that one joint tenant’s interest in immovable property be attached and taken in execution under a WSS. 9 The Plaintiff pointed out that the decision inChan Shwe Chingwas in conflict with two other decisions by High Court Judges, namely,Focal Financeby Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) andChan Lung Kienby Chua Lee Ming J. Both decisions held that a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property cannot be taken in execution under a WSS. The Plaintiff submitted that in light of this seeming conflict in the authorities, I was not bound by any of the aforementioned three decisions, and was free to rely on the decision inChan Shwe Ching. 10 The Plaintiff urged me to follow Leow JC’s decision inChan Shwe Chingas (a) it was consistent with the legal position in the jurisdictions of Australia, England, and Canada, and (b) there were strong public policy reasons in favour of finding that a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property can be taken in execution under a WSS. 11 At the first hearing before me, I raised a concern that the authorities were not in fact in conflict. This is because theex parteorder granted by Leow JC inChan Shwe Chingwas set aside by Chua J inChan Lung Kienafter aninterparteshearing and therefore ceased, for the purposes of the doctrine ofstare decisis, to have any precedential effect. 12 In response, the Plaintiff’s counsel acknowledged that the setting aside of Leow JC’s order is “a potential problem” to the Plaintiff’s position. He then submitted that I ought to adopt the approach by the court inChan Yat Chun v Sng Jin Chye & Anor[2016] SGHCR 4 (“Chan Yat Chun”), where the learned Assistant Registrar stated inobiterthat Assistant Registrars are not bound by the decisions of High Court Judges. In short, the Plaintiff’s alternative submission at the time was that even ifChan Shwe Chingceased to have precedential effect, on the authority ofChan Yat Chun, I was not bound by eitherFocal FinanceorChan Lung Kienanyway, and he urged me to find that the Defendant’s interest (as joint tenant) in the Property can be taken in execution under a WSS. 13 It subsequently came to my attention that there was another decision by an Assistant Registrar, namelyActis Excalibur Ltd v KS Distribution Pte Ltd[2016] SGHCR 11 (“ActisExcalibur”), where the court found that Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges. I then invited the Plaintiff’s counsel to address me onActis Excalibur. At the second hearing before me, he submitted that the decision inActisExcaliburis correct and that Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges. However, the Plaintiff’s counsel maintained that I was not bound byFocal FinanceorChan Lung Kienas there was conflict in the authorities. In short, he argued that Chua J (as one High Court Judge) could not overrule the decision of another High Court Judge (ie, Leow JC), and that I was free to rely on the decision inChan Shwe Ching.",
        "Issues": "14 As highlighted in the introduction, there are two issues which I needed to resolve to determine the Plaintiff’s application. I propose to first deal with the issue of whether Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges, before considering if I am bound by any High Court decision on the execution against a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property by means of a WSS.",
        "Issue 1:Stare Decisisbetween High Court Judges and Assistant Registrars": "15 In 2016, two Assistant Registrars reached different conclusions on the issue of whether Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges. 16 In the first decision ofChan Yat Chun, Assistant Registrar Zhuang WenXiong (“AR Zhuang”) observed that Assistant Registrars are not bound by the decisions of High Court Judges because (a) the doctrine of horizontalstare decisisdoes not prevail in Singapore and the High Court is not bound by its previous decisions, and (b) O 32 r 9 of the Rules provides that an Assistant Registrar has the same powers and jurisdiction as a Judge in Chambers (see [11]). 17 AR Zhuang’s views were considered by Assistant Registrar Colin Seow (“AR Seow”) inActis Excalibur. In short, AR Seow disagreed with AR Zhuang’s views for two reasons. First, he held that the authorities cited by AR Zhuang, namelyAttorney-General v Shadrake Alan[2010] SGHC 327 andAttorney-General v Chee Soon Juan[2006] 2 SLR(R) 650,  were distinguishable and did not deal specifically with whether Assistant Registrars were bound by the decisions of High Court Judges (see [15]). Second, Assistant Registrars are conferred with powers and jurisdiction to carry out certain functionson behalf ofHigh Court Judges as a matter of the internal organisation of judicial work in the High Court, and is therefore juridically ancillary to a High Court Judge in the judicial hierarchy (see [18]). 18 In my view, the different conclusions reached inChan Yat ChunandActis Excaliburis explicable on how the respective courts approached the issue of theplace or status of an Assistant Registrar in the judicial hierarchy. While the court inChan Yat Chunassumed that Assistant Registrars and High Court Judges are co-ordinate in the judicial hierarchy (seeChan Yat Chunat [11]), the court inActis Excaliburfound that Assistant Registrars are in fact subordinate to High Court Judges in the judicial hierarchy (seeActis Excaliburat [16]–[18]). 19 Hence, the proper characterisation of the place of Assistant Registrars in the judicial hierarchy is key to unlocking the issue of whether Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges. In approaching this issue, it will be helpful to briefly consider the doctrine ofstare decisis, and the jurisdiction and powers of the Assistant Registrar, which I now turn to.",
        "Stare Decisis": "20 In essence,stare decisis, or the doctrine of binding precedent, consists of rules of practice which guide the courts on the manner of adjudication with reference to decided cases.Stare decisiscan operate between courts at different levels in the judicial hierarchy (ie, verticalstare decisis) and between courts at the same level in the judicial hierarchy (ie, horizontalstare decisis). For present purposes, I am only concerned with verticalstare decisisin Singapore. 21Verticalstare decisissimply means that a Judge is constrained to follow a decision of the courts above him in the judicial hierarchy if the case before him cannot be distinguished from the prior case (see Walter Woon, “The Doctrine of Judicial Precedent” inThe Singapore Legal System(Kevin YL Tan ed) (Singapore University Press, 1999) (“Woon”) at 298). Under the rules ofstare decisis,only theratio decidendiof the decision is binding (see Woon at 298). In other words, only the rule of law which was expressly or impliedly treated by the Judge as a necessary step in reaching his or her conclusion is binding (seeIndo Commercial Society (Pte) Ltd v Ebrahim and another[1992] 2 SLR(R) 667 at [14]). 22 There can be no dispute that verticalstare decisisapplies in our judicial system. Applied to the present case, if I find that High Court Judges are above Assistant Registrars in the judicial hierarchy (ie, like AR Seow inActis Excalibur), it follows that verticalstare decisisapplies between Assistant Registrars and High Court Judges.",
        "Powers and Jurisdiction of Assistant Registrars": "23 The Registrar and the Assistant Registrars of the High Court exercise delegatedjurisdiction which is devolved from that vested in a High Court Judge in Chambers (see the Court of Appeal decision inTan Boon Heng v Lau Pang Cheng[2013] 4 SLR 718 (“Lau Pang Cheng”) at [13]–[16]). This is clear from s 62(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) read with O 32 r 9(1) of the Rules, which provide that the powers conferred on a High Court Judge in Chambers is exercisable by the Registrar unless the Chief Justice directs otherwise (for an example of such a direction, see para 42(1) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions, where it is stated that the Chief Justice has directed that applications forMarevainjunctions and search orders shall be heard by High Court Judges but all otherex parteapplications for interim injunctions may be heard by the Registrar and the Assistant Registrars of the High Court). The Registrar, and by extension Assistant Registrars, are delegated such powers, authority and jurisdiction as a matter ofadministrative convenience, to save the time of High Court Judges (seeLau Pang Chengat [14]). 24 All decisions of an Assistant Registrar (whether interlocutory or final) are appealable to a High Court Judge in Chambers under O 56 r 1(1) of the Rules. A Judge in Chambers who hears a Registrar’s Appeal is not exercising appellate jurisdiction butconfirmatoryjurisdiction, and is entitled to exercise his or her discretion afresh (seeLau Pang Chengat [16] and [21]). This stems from the fact that the Assistant Registrar and the Judge in Chambers exercise the same powers and jurisdiction.",
        "My Decision": "25 With respect, I do not find the decision inChan Yat Chunpersuasive for two reasons. (a) First, I agree with AR Seow that the authorities relied on inChan Yat Chunare distinguishable and did not specifically consider whether Assistant Registrars are bound by the decisions of High Court Judges (see [17] above), or where Assistant Registrars stand in the judicial hierarchy. (b) Second, the decision inChan Yat Chunconcerned an execution against a tenant-in-common’s interest in immovable property by means of a WSS. AR Zhuang had accepted as “trite” that a tenant-in-common owns a distinct and identifiable interest in immovable property (at [6]), and would have found, either on the authority ofFocal FinanceorChan Shwe Ching, that the interest of a tenant-in-common is exigible to a WSS (see [33] and [34] below). It was for this reason that the issue of whether Assistant Registrars are bound by decisions of High Court Judges was not argued before AR Zhuang and he did not have the benefit of hearing submissions on the matter. 26 Instead, I prefer the conclusion reached inActis Excalibur. In my view, it must be the case that High Court Judges occupy a higher position than Assistant Registrars in the judicial hierarchy such that the doctrine of verticalstare decisisprevails between Assistant Registrars and High Court Judges. I say so for three reasons. 27 First, all decisions of Assistant Registrars are appealable to a High Court Judge in Chambers as of right. In a hierarchical system of courts like ours, this right of appeal is indicative of (a) the lower standing of the Assistant Registrarvis-à-visthe High Court Judge in the judicial hierarchy, and (b) the existence of verticalstare decisisbetween Assistant Registrars and High Court Judges. As explained by Professor Walter Woon, verticalstare decisisnaturally follows from the power of one court to reverse the decision of another court. Professor Woon says (seeWoonat 306): Verticalstare decisisisconcomitant of the power of a court to reverse the decision of a lowercourt.If there is a right of appeal from court A to court B, then court A should treat court B’s decisions as binding.Otherwise, if court A departs from such decisions it is likely to be reversed on appeal.Thus a court should be bound by the decisions of a court to which appeals lie… [emphasis added in bold italics] 28 The same reason was expressed by the High Court of Australia inViro v R(1978) 18 ALR 257, where it was held that the High Court of Australia was no longer bound by the decisions of the Privy Council following the abolition of appeals from the High Court of Australia to the Privy Council. Barwick CJ explained that “[t]heessential basisfor the observance of a decision of a tribunal by way of binding precedent is that thattribunal can correct the decisions of the court which it is said so to be bound” [emphasis added] (at 260). Similarly, Stephen J stated that “[t]he sanction implicit in the doctrine of precedent is simple and effective: if an inferior court fails to observe the doctrine the superior court will correct its decision on appeal.Thus the existence of an appeal is inherent in and essential to the doctrine” [emphasis added] (at 289). 29 The second reason, which is related to the first, is the unfetteredstandard of review by High Court Judges in Registrar’s Appeals on interlocutory applications. In such applications, the Registrar’s Appeal operates as an actualrehearingof the application, and the High Court Judge treats the matter afresh as though it has come before him or her for the first time (seeHerbs and Spices Trading Post Pte Ltd v Deo Silver (Pte) Ltd[1990] 2 SLR(R) 685 at [12]). The fact that the High Court Judge need not consider how the Assistant Registrar exercised his or her discretion is strongly indicative that High Court Judges stand above Assistant Registrars in the judicial hierarchy. 30 The third reason relates to the delegated nature of the jurisdiction exercised by Assistant Registrars. Assistant Registrars are delegated certain powers, authority and jurisdiction of High Court Judgesforadministrative convenience(see [23] above). This must mean that Assistant Registrars are not co-ordinate with High Court Judges in the judicial hierarchy. As such, there is much force to AR Seow’s remark inActis Excaliburthat Assistant Registrars “are necessarily obliged in the discharge of [certain judicial functions on behalf of High Court Judges] not to overreach the very premise upon which such powers, authority and jurisdiction are derived” (see [18]). 31 To conclude on this issue, I find Assistant Registrars are bound by theratio decidendiof the decisions of High Court Judges if the case before him or her cannot be distinguished. The Plaintiff has rightly conceded that the decision inActis Excaliburought to be preferred to that inChan Yat Chun.",
        "Issue 2: Conflicting Decisions on WSS of Joint Tenant’s Interest?": "32 At the outset, I accept the proposition that an Assistant Registrar is not bound to follow the decision of any one High Court Judge where that decision conflicts with another decision by a High Court Judge (seeActis Excaliburat [19];Chan Yat Chunat [10]). The issue here is whether there exists a state of conflict in the authorities. There are three decisions by High Court Judges (cited by the Plaintiff) that have a bearing on this determination. 33 In the first decision ofFocal Finance, Tay JC held that a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property cannot be taken in execution under a WSS because the interests of the joint tenants are not distinct and identifiable, and therefore not capable of being attached under a WSS (at [15]–[18]). 34 In the second decision ofChan Shwe Ching,which was decidedex parte, Leow JC held that a WSS can be issued against a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property because severance of the joint tenant’s interest (to create a tenancy-in-common) will occur when the Sheriff decides to sell the immovable property under the WSS (at [13] and [20]). 35 In the third decision ofChan Lung Kien, which was decidedinter partes,Chua J followed Tay JC’s decision inFocal Finance. Chua J gave three reasons for this (at [29]–[35]). First, there is nothing for the WSS to bite onto at the point when the court makes an order for a WSS to be issued. Each joint tenant’s interest in the property is indistinguishable, and the issuance of the WSS does not sever the joint tenancy to create a tenancy-in-common. Second, if there is nothing for the WSS to bite onto at the point when the court makes an order for a WSS to be issued, it cannot be an answer to say that the joint tenant’s interest willsubsequentlybe converted into the interest of a tenant-in-common which would be capable of being seized. Third, Leow JC’s reasoning inChan Shwe Chingis premised on the ability to sell the property following a seizure of a debtor’s interest. However, the seizure of a joint tenant’s interest under a WSS (even assuming this can be done) is not the same thing as a seizure of the property itself, and the Sheriff cannot sell the property without the agreement of all the joint tenants. 36 When considering these three authorities, it must be remembered that the latter two concerned thesame legal claimand consideredthe same legal question. Leow JC inChan Shwe Chingmade anex parteorder that the interest of one joint tenant (ie, the defendant, Leong Lai Yee) in the property at 9 Jalan Tanah Rata be attached and taken in execution under a WSS. In the later case ofChan Lung Kien, Chua J, upon the application of a creditor of Leong Lai Yee (ie,a non-party to the proceedings inChan Shwe Ching), set aside Leow JC’s orderinter partesunder O 32 r 6 of the Rules. In setting aside Leow JC’sex parteorder, Chua J emphasized that the application under O 32 r 6 is not an appeal (seeChan Lung Kienat [18]). O 32 r 6 of the Rules permits anex parteorder to be set aside as it recognises thatex parteorders areprovisionalin nature and made upon the hearing of one party only (seeChan Lung Kienat [18]). In the words of Sir Donaldson MR, inWEA Records Ltd v Visions Channel 4 Ltd[1983] 1 WLR 721 at 727: … ex parte orders areessentially provisional in nature. They are made by the judge on the basis of evidence and submissions emanating from one side only. Despite the fact that the applicant is under a duty to make full and frank disclosure of all relevant information in his possession, whether or not it assists his application,there is no basis for making a definitive order and every judge knows this. He expects at a later stageto be given an opportunity to review his provisional order in light of evidence and argument adduced by the other side and, in sodoing, he is not hearing an appeal from himself and in no way feels inhibited from discharging or varying his original order.[emphasis added] 37 In my view, the provisional nature of anex parteorder is the very reason why the decision inChan Shwe Chingceased to have precedential force once it was set asideinter partes. Anex parteorder is not a definitive order, and may be discharged or varied in light of evidence and argument from the other side. If a court discharges anex parteorder after considering the same legal question(s) further on aninter partesbasis, it must necessarily follow that the decision initially made ex parte is no longer authoritative. 38 InChan Lung Kien, Chua J set aside Leow JC’sex parteorder as he arrived at a different conclusion from Leow JC on whether a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property is exigible to a WSS. Pursuant to the setting aside, theex partedecision inChan Shwe Chingis no longer authoritative. This must be correct, because if it were otherwise,inter partesdecisions made to set asideex parteorders wouldneverbe binding on the lower courts, because theinter partesdecision differs from theex parteone. In my respectful view, this would be a perverse outcome. Even though the circumstances surroundingChan Shwe ChingandChan Lung Kienare a little unique in that (a) different Judges issued theex partedecision and theinter partesdecision, and (b) theinter parteshearing was argued by a non-party (instead of the defendant), this does not change the analysis. 39 In the circumstances, only the decisions inFocal FinanceandChan Lung Kienare binding on me. On the facts before me,Focal FinanceandChan Lung Kiencannot be distinguished (and indeed the Plaintiff does not take such a position). Consequently, I am bound to find that the Defendant’s interest in the Property cannot be taken in execution under a WSS as the interest of a joint tenant is not distinct and identifiable.",
        "Conclusion": "40 In closing, I thank the Plaintiff’s counsel for his submissions. Despite his best efforts, I am bound to so find that the Defendant’s interest in the Property cannot be attached and taken in execution under a WSS. The Plaintiff’s application is therefore dismissed. Navin AnandAssistant Registrar Tang Hang Wu (Instructed), Choo Zheng Xi, Raj Mannar and Elaine Low (Peter Low & Choo LLC) for the Plaintiff."
