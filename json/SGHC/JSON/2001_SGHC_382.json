        "THE DEFENDANTS": "(1) The First Defendant10 The First Defendant, 71 years of age, the patriarch of the Tong\n\nfamily, used to reside at 2 Kew Drive. He left for Australia in early 2000 and returned\n\nhere for the trial. He came from China around 1948. In 1957, he married the Second\n\nDefendant. The Ninth Defendant was born in 1958, the Third Defendant in 1964 and the twin\n\nsisters (the Tenth and the Eleventh Defendants) in 1968. He worked hard and in 1973,\n\nregistered a construction firm, employing the Fifth Defendant soon thereafter as the sole\n\nemployee.11 He had basic education in Chinese and was practically illiterate in\n\nEnglish. He said he had no idea about accounts. He was a hot-tempered, traditional Chinese\n\nbusinessman who ruled his family with a strong arm. All properties bought or registered in\n\nthe names of the family members were regarded by the First Defendant as belonging to\n\nhimself. He appointed and removed directors of his companies as he pleased and changed the\n\nshareholdings of his daughters depending on whether he was pleased or angry with any of\n\nthem.12 As his construction business grew and flourished, the firm was\n\nincorporated as a private limited company in 1985 with the First Defendant as Managing\n\nDirector and majority shareholder. The company had many public sector construction\n\nprojects. The Fourth Defendant (his brother-in-law) joined his business in 1984 as a\n\nforeman and, after a short period of absence, rejoined it in 1987. In 1992, the Fourth\n\nDefendant was made a director of the Plaintiff company. He became the Deputy Managing\n\nDirector in 1995/1996 as the Tong family wanted to \"give him face\".13 The First Defendant bought properties and a plot of land formerly\n\nknown as 4 Kew Drive on which he constructed four houses – 4 and 4A Kew Drive and 755\n\nand 757 Upper East Coast Road. He also bought holiday homes in Perth and in Sydney and\n\ndeveloped a penchant for golf and fine wine, which he kept in a wine cellar in his former\n\nhome at 2 Kew Drive and in 755 Upper East Coast Road (the home of the Third Defendant and\n\nher husband, the Thirteenth Defendant). The Plaintiff company held annual golf\n\ntournaments. The First Defendant also commissioned and affixed wine labels bearing the\n\nPlaintiff company’s name on bottles of wine as gifts for his business associates.14 He claimed that he was in semi-retirement since 1995 and had left\n\nthe running of the company to the Fourth Defendant. However, the evidence showed quite\n\nclearly that he was still the final decision-maker in all things pertaining to the\n\ncompanies – from tenders to negotiations with subcontractors and award of\n\nsubcontracts. He was also actively monitoring the progress at the various worksites,\n\ntravelling about in a vehicle driven by his wife.",
        "(2) The Second Defendant": "15 The Second Defendant, 61 years of age, was an intelligent, astute\n\nand capable wife, mother and businesswoman. She received formal education in Chinese up to\n\nSecondary 4 level, quite a rarity in the days of old for a girl. She controlled the\n\ncompanies’ finances, invested in shares and in foreign currencies. She was trusted\n\ncompletely by the First Defendant and was practically her husband’s alter ego save\n\nfor his hot temper. Only she and the First Defendant were authorized to be sole\n\nsignatories in respect of the bank accounts. Although she was the Managing Director in the\n\nSixth Defendant only, the Second Defendant received monthly remuneration from both the\n\nPlaintiff company and the Sixth Defendant. She transferred progress payments from the HDB\n\nin respect of the construction projects to personal accounts to earn interest instead of\n\ndepositing the large amounts into the Plaintiff company’s account which, she said,\n\nearned no interest. She transferred the principal amounts back to the Plaintiff company\n\nsubsequently, retained the interest and paid income tax on the same. Over the years, the\n\nprincipal amounts involved added up cumulatively to $194 million.16 The Second Defendant, together with the Third, Fourth and Fifth\n\nDefendants, exercised functions in the Plaintiff company like an executive committee. They\n\ndiscussed when to pay, whom to pay first and how much to pay. When they were not able to\n\nresolve a particular matter, they would refer it to \"the boss\", the First\n\nDefendant. The Second Defendant also used money transferred from the Plaintiff company to\n\nthe Sixth Defendant to pay the interest on bank loans taken out by her and the Sixth\n\nDefendant for purchasing and developing the land (by constructing the four houses) at Kew\n\nDrive.17 She left for Australia in early 2000 with her husband and the Third\n\nDefendant’s elder son, Calvin, then aged 8, after making arrangements to sell away\n\ntheir properties and to ship their belongings there.",
        "(3) The Third Defendant": "18 The Third Defendant was the favourite daughter of the Tongs. She was\n\na graduate in Accountancy and had working experience in an international accounting firm.\n\nShe joined the Plaintiff company around 1995 and headed the accounts departments of the\n\nPlaintiff, the Sixth and the Seventh Defendants. She was a signatory to the\n\ncompanies’ accounts and worked closely with the then auditor, S K Lai. She resigned\n\nas a director of the Plaintiff company on 27 January 2000.19 She left Singapore for Sydney, Australia in December 1999 and\n\nappeared to have decided to settle down permanently there, even if reluctantly. Her\n\nhusband (the Thirteenth Defendant) and their other younger son remained in Singapore, the\n\nhusband having bought over 755 Upper East Coast Road from the Second and the Third\n\nDefendants.20 In her affidavit of 25 May 2000, the Third Defendant acknowledged\n\nthat the accounts of the Plaintiff company and the Sixth Defendant had been fiddled with\n\nto alter the actual loss situation in the Plaintiff company to that of a profitable one by\n\ntransferring the losses to the Sixth Defendant in order to preserve the net worth of the\n\nPlaintiff company at or above $5 million and consequently its G8 status. She claimed,\n\nhowever, that all this was done on the advice of the company’s auditor, S K Lai.\n\nIncidentally, S K Lai used to be a partner of the Liquidator in an accounting firm at the\n\nrelevant time but the Liquidator was not involved in the audit of the Plaintiff company or\n\nits affiliates then.21 In her very telling email sent on 4 May 2000 from Sydney to Mr B M\n\nSingh, she asked the family’s lawyer what would happen if she decided to return to\n\nSingapore to \"face the music\". She also stated:\"Life holds no meaning for me here. I’m living a lie here, I\n\n  can’t tell people the real reason that I’m in Sydney, and I have to cook up\n\n  stories as to why my husband is in S’pore while I’m in Sydney with my son. I\n\n  even have to resort telling people that I have only 1 son to save the hassle of having to\n\n  explain to them why I have only one son with me …I owe my life to my parents …I’d rather go back to S’pore, get a job and live a simple\n\n  life. Never mind about luxuries. Calvin can fit into the S’pore education with no\n\n  problem. There was never a need to bring him here – he was doing very well in school\n\n  in S’pore …Please tell me it’s possible to come back to S’pore. I\n\n  don’t mind being a bankrupt. I have no face to lose.\"(4) The Fourth Defendant22 The Fourth Defendant is the younger brother of the Second Defendant.\n\nHe is the third youngest sibling among the nine in the Koo family. He was essentially the\n\nman on the ground, spending almost all his working time at the sites supervising the works\n\nand liaising with the numerous subcontractors. He authorized and approved the\n\ncertification of the value of work done by the subcontractors but the accounts department\n\nwould invariably pay them less than the certified amounts.23 When the Plaintiff company’s funds could not meet all the\n\nclaims for payments, the Fourth Defendant would be consulted by the Second, the Third and\n\nthe Fifth Defendants (the de facto \"executive committee\") on whom should be paid\n\nfirst and in what amounts so that the works on the sites could carry on. He was, however,\n\nnever involved in the financial matters beyond being asked to rubber stamp the accounts\n\nprepared by the accounts department by signing Directors’ resolutions approving them.\n\nHe was never shown the audited accounts and there was never any formal meeting held.24 By the middle of 1998, the problem of non-payment or underpayment\n\nbecame more serious when the subcontractors affected began to delay their supplies and\n\nservices. In May 1999, the electrical contractor went to the extent of shutting off the\n\npower supply at a site. The Fourth Defendant reckoned that the five HDB projects awarded\n\nto the Plaintiff company ought to have been profitable to the extent of $10 million to $15\n\nmillion.25 The Fourth Defendant was promised some shares in the Plaintiff\n\ncompany by the First and the Second Defendants but, as the Second Defendant had\n\nconsistently told him that the Plaintiff company was losing money, he did not bother to\n\npursue the matter.26 On 26 February 2000, the Fourth Defendant’s services were\n\nsuddenly and unceremoniously terminated by the First Defendant upon the Fourth\n\nDefendant’s return from leave. However, he remained a director of the Seventh\n\nDefendant. No reason was given for the termination. The First Defendant explained in his\n\ntestimony in Court that it was essentially due to his discovery that the Fourth Defendant\n\nwas corrupt in his dealings with the Plaintiff company’s subcontractors and also that\n\nhe had been spreading rumours about the Tong family siphoning the company’s money to\n\nAustralia. Until then, the Fourth Defendant had been having a good relationship with the\n\nFirst and the Second Defendants, with the Tongs and the Koos regularly meeting for dinner\n\nat 2 Kew Drive.",
        "(5) The Fifth Defendant": "27 The Fifth Defendant had been working for the First Defendant since\n\nshe was 19 years old in 1975. She was appointed a director of the Plaintiff company when\n\nit was incorporated in 1985. She was completely trusted by the Tong couple and was also\n\ninvolved in the Sixth and the Seventh Defendants and in the Tong family’s personal\n\nmatters. She held no shares in the companies and was appointed a director to facilitate\n\nthe running of the Plaintiff company only. She was not a trained accountant but would\n\ndeputize the Third Defendant in her absence. She was in fact the head of both the\n\nadministration and the accounts departments before the Third Defendant took over the\n\naccounts department in 1995. Whatever she signed in her capacity as director was at the\n\nFirst Defendant’s express or implied instructions given to her directly or through\n\nthe Second Defendant. She signed contracts and documents relating to the annual accounts\n\nand the bank accounts.28 The Fifth Defendant knew when payments were made by the HDB to the\n\nPlaintiff company and was aware of the transfers of the money into the personal accounts\n\nof the First and the Second Defendants to earn interest for themselves. She did not know\n\nwhy the Plaintiff company did not maintain an interest bearing account.29 On 15 March 2000, she resigned as a director of the Plaintiff\n\ncompany.",
        "(6) The Sixth Defendant": "30 The Second, Ninth and Tenth Defendants were the directors of the\n\nSixth Defendant with the Second Defendant holding about 53% of the shares and the First\n\nDefendant about 24%. The rest of the shares were held by the Third and the Ninth\n\nDefendants. Like the Plaintiff company, the Sixth Defendant was insolvent.31 The Sixth Defendant developed residential projects until 1995/1996\n\nwhen it became the purported subcontractor for the Plaintiff company’s HDB projects.\n\nThe Sixth Defendant was in truth only a subcontractor in name as it had no resources of\n\nits own and was effectively the Plaintiff company’s alter ego. The First Defendant\n\ntestified that he incorporated the Sixth Defendant in 1984 as he wanted to have more than\n\none company to provide for the eventuality that one of his companies could be barred from\n\ntendering for construction jobs. As indicated earlier, the Sixth Defendant became the\n\nvehicle for the Plaintiff company to dump its losses, with the purported accounts showing\n\nthe Sixth Defendant owing the Plaintiff company some $19 million as at April 2000. S K\n\nLai, the auditor, testified that the Third Defendant had misrepresented to him that the\n\ntransactions between the Plaintiff company and the Sixth Defendant had a valid commercial\n\nbasis. As a result, his audit report did not reflect the true position that emerged during\n\nthe trial.",
        "(7) The Seventh Defendant": "32 The Seventh Defendant was wholly owned by the Sixth Defendant. Its\n\ndirectors were the First, Fourth and Ninth Defendants. It developed a housing project\n\nknown as Eastwood Lodge using the Plaintiff company’s funds. The units in the project\n\nwere allegedly sold at a loss. As at 30 April 1999, the Seventh Defendant was shown as\n\nowing the Plaintiff company slightly more than $7 million. In May 1999, some $5.55 million\n\nof proceeds of sale were returned to the Plaintiff company, reducing the balance\n\noutstanding at about $1.5 million. Between May and July 2000, the First Defendant took\n\n$482,000 from the Seventh Defendant as the First and Second Defendants required\n\n\"living expenses\" although the liquidator of the Plaintiff company was told by\n\nthe First and Second Defendants when he met them in August 2000 in Australia that the\n\nSeventh Defendant had no money.",
        "(8) The Eighth Defendant": "33 The Eighth Defendant used to be known as Tong Tien See Holding\n\n(Australia) Pty Ltd. It was incorporated in Sydney, Australia in October 1994. By a deed\n\ndated 5 October 1994, it became a trust corporation for the Tong family.34 The First, Second, Third and the Twelfth Defendants (the younger\n\nsister of the Second Defendant) were the directors of the Eighth Defendant. The First,\n\nSecond and Third Defendants used to hold 33.3% of the shares each. In November 1998, the\n\nTwelfth Defendant became the only shareholder and in November 1999, she became the sole\n\ndirector. In January 2000, it adopted the present name.35 The Eighth Defendant had two properties in its name. One was 39A\n\nHydebrae Street in Sydney and the other was an apartment at The Stamford, 52-56 Goderich\n\nStreet in Perth.36 When the Court ordered the disclosure of the accounting records and\n\nthe bank statements of the Eighth Defendant, the Twelfth Defendant claimed that they were\n\nin the accountants’ office for the preparation of accounts and that the said office\n\nhad unfortunately just been broken into and vandalized. Although the Twelfth Defendant\n\ninformed the Court in May 2001 during her testimony that she had written to the Eighth\n\nDefendant’s banks for a copy of the bank statements, nothing has been made available\n\nto the Plaintiff company so far.",
        "(9) The Ninth Defendant": "37 The Ninth Defendant was a director and shareholder of the Sixth\n\nDefendant and a director of the Seventh Defendant. She was also a co-signatory for the\n\nPlaintiff company’s bank accounts. She studied music in Australia in 1982. In 1991,\n\nshe married and then moved to Hong Kong to work for two years. In 1993, she returned to\n\nSingapore and was the Managing Director of a trading and forex company owned by her and\n\nher husband which operated for three years. She claimed that she only did basic records\n\nand was not conversant at all with accounting and financial matters.38 The Ninth Defendant managed the First Defendant’s bank accounts\n\nin Australia, opened in the name of Francis Tong. The First Defendant had initially denied\n\nhaving such a name or such accounts when cross-examined by Counsel for the Plaintiff\n\ncompany but when he returned after the lunch break, he claimed to have spoken to the Ninth\n\nDefendant who told him that she had chosen a Western name for him.39 The Ninth Defendant was the Plaintiff company’s Human Resource\n\nManager. She was in the office for only a few hours a day. She claimed that her\n\nappointment was in name only and that she was actually paid by the Plaintiff company to be\n\nat the beck and call of the First Defendant 24 hours a day, seven days a week.",
        "(10) The Tenth Defendant": "(11) The Eleventh Defendant40 These were the 33 year old twin daughters of the Tongs. The Tenth\n\nDefendant is not married. She was a director of the Sixth Defendant. The Eleventh\n\nDefendant is married to Er Chuan Lee who also worked for the Plaintiff company. The\n\nEleventh Defendant and her husband were appointed directors of the Plaintiff company on 28\n\nFebruary 2000. The twin sisters appeared to be less favoured by their parents than the\n\nThird and the Ninth Defendants. They worked as site clerks in the Plaintiff company.41 On 18 February 2000, the Tenth Defendant left for Sydney as\n\ninstructed by her parents, to help out with household chores and to look after the Third\n\nDefendant’s elder son, Calvin.42 Like the others, she said that she signed documents as a director\n\nwithout question or thought.43 In February 2000, the Second and the Eleventh Defendants opened a\n\njoint bank account so that the latter could pay for the outgoings of 2 Kew Drive as her\n\nmother was not going to be around for some time. She was also given a power of attorney by\n\nthe Third Defendant to sell the Third Defendant’s residential properties. However,\n\nshe did not seem to know anything about the sales besides having to go to the\n\nsolicitors’ office to sign some documents.44 On 27 April 2000, when the then Provisional Liquidator and his team\n\nentered the Plaintiff company’s premises, the Eleventh Defendant was instructed by\n\nher father, the First Defendant, to call the police to evict them. The Tenth Defendant and\n\nthe Ninth Defendant’s husband were also present at the office that evening. After the\n\npolice arrived and advised the Provisional Liquidator and his team to leave, the Fifth,\n\nthe Tenth and the Eleventh Defendants, with the assistance of some others, removed the\n\nfiles of the Sixth and the Seventh Defendants from the Plaintiff company’s office.\n\nThe Sixth and the Seventh Defendants have commenced an action against the Liquidator\n\narising from the events that evening.",
        "(12) The Twelfth Defendant": "45 The Twelfth Defendant undertook a nursing course in England and then\n\nmoved to Australia where she met and married her husband, Thava Rasiah. She became an\n\nAustralian citizen. They operated two McDonald's restaurants in Sydney. The Twelfth\n\nDefendant claimed that they had six such outlets previously. She was very dear to the\n\nFirst and the Second Defendants and was their nominee in the Eighth Defendant.46 The Twelfth Defendant and her husband owned one property held in the\n\nname of their company. They also owned jointly several other properties. They had loans\n\namounting to some A$3.5 million. Their companies’ tax returns showed losses from 1996\n\nto 1999 and a small profit of A$21,000 in 2000.47 The Twelfth Defendant claimed that she was told in November 1999 by\n\nher sister, the Second Defendant, of their intention to move to Australia because of\n\nCalvin’s enrolment in a school in Sydney. She claimed she had no knowledge of the\n\nfinancial woes of the Plaintiff company. The Second Defendant asked her for financial help\n\nto purchase a larger house as the one at 39A Hydebrae Street was too small for the family\n\nand too far from Calvin’s school.48 The Twelfth Defendant said that in November 1999, when the Second\n\nDefendant visited Sydney, the Twelfth Defendant contemplated purchasing a rather large\n\nhouse at 17 Woodward Avenue. The following month, she agreed to purchase it for A$1.47\n\nmillion. The deal was completed in March 2000 and the house was registered in her sole\n\nname. The Twelfth Defendant claimed that she borrowed A$670,000 from the First Defendant\n\nfor the purchase and the remaining A$800,000 came from her and her husband. The evidence\n\nshowed that the property was mortgaged for A$800,000 several months after the completion.49 The Twelfth Defendant claimed that she then rented the house to the\n\nTongs. According to the Tongs, the rental was not a fixed amount. The Twelfth Defendant\n\nalso claimed that she did not rent out one of her properties which was vacant to the Tongs\n\nas the First Defendant did not like to live in old houses.",
        "(13) The Thirteenth Defendant": "50 The Thirteenth Defendant is the husband of the Third Defendant. He\n\nworked as a fuel oil broker earning about $12,000 gross salary per month. They married in\n\n1990 and lived in her parents’ home at 2 Kew Drive until 1996 when they shifted to\n\nthe newly built 755 Upper East Coast Road, next door.51 The Thirteenth Defendant claimed that he had no interest in the Tong\n\nfamily’s affairs and did not discuss such matters with his wife. He said his working\n\nhours caused him to be away from home most of the time anyway. He claimed his wife left\n\nfor Australia in December 1999 as it was her dream to send Calvin to study abroad. He only\n\nknew that she was leaving about one week before her departure. He also said that he\n\ndiscovered the true reason for her departure only in March 2000 as he and his wife were\n\ngoing through a bad patch before that. He did not even know that his wife had sold her car\n\nuntil after the sale as she used to park it next door at her parents’ home.52 The Thirteenth Defendant bought over 755 Upper East Coast Road from\n\nthe Second and the Third Defendants in March 2000 for $1.7 million as he needed a home for\n\nhis second son, his father and his brother. He took a bank loan of $1.19 million, withdrew\n\n$170,000 from his CPF savings and paid $340,000 (or 20% of the purchase price) in cash.\n\nThe amount of cash came from his savings, winnings from illegal gambling and loans from\n\nfamily members, including Peggy Koo, the youngest sister of the Second and the Fourth\n\nDefendants, who lent him $230,000 for three years free of interest. Although he claimed\n\nthat 10% of the price was paid upon exercise of the option and the remaining 10% upon\n\ncompletion, the solicitors’ completion accounts indicated that no money was paid\n\nuntil completion. He claimed that he did pay in the manner stated by him but did not know\n\nhow his solicitors dealt with the matter.",
        "THE ACTS COMPLAINED OF": "53 The directors formally appointed in the Plaintiff company were the\n\nFirst, Third, Fourth and Fifth Defendants. It was not disputed that the relevant\n\nDefendants, as directors, were under a fiduciary duty and had to act honestly and in good\n\nfaith in the best interests of the company.54 When a company is solvent, its interests and those of its\n\nshareholders are one. In this case, there would not even be divergence of interests\n\nbetween the company and its shareholders as they were in reality the First and the Second\n\nDefendants. But when a company is insolvent, the interests of its creditors become the\n\ndominant factor in what constitutes the benefit of the company as a whole (West Mercia\n\nSafetywear Ltd v Dodd[1988] BCLC 250).55 A company is insolvent or unable to pay its debts when it is unable\n\nto meet current demands, irrespective of whether the company is possessed of assets which,\n\nif realized, would enable it to discharge its liabilities in full. Insolvency in this\n\ncommercial sense is principally a question of fact which may be established in a number of\n\nways. However, proof that a creditor’s debt has not been paid per se does not\n\nestablish an inability to pay debts within the meaning of Section 254(2)(c) of the\n\nCompanies Act. A temporary lack of liquidity does not tantamount to insolvency (seeRe\n\nSanpete Builders (S) Pte Ltd[1989] 1 MLJ 393).56 From the evidence adduced, the Plaintiff company was plainly\n\ninsolvent from about 1995 and this fact was well known to the First, Second and Third\n\nDefendants. The Fourth and the Fifth Defendants learnt of the consistent losses in the\n\nprojects from the Second Defendant. However, the accounts of the Plaintiff company were\n\nmanipulated to show profitability and to maintain falsely the G8 grading so that the\n\ncompany could continue to be awarded multi-million dollar jobs. The First and the Second\n\nDefendants claimed that they were in fact trying to save the company by hoping to reap\n\nenough profits from the later projects to pay off the company’s debts. In truth, they\n\nwere robbing Peter to pay Paul by using the new projects’ proceeds to pay the debts\n\nof the old projects and even then, not all of Peter’s money went to Paul. In the\n\nmeantime, far from trying to trim the expenses of the Plaintiff company, they continued as\n\nif the company was riding the crest of prosperity and projected a completely false image\n\nto the certifying authority, the owners of the projects and the company’s\n\nsubcontractors and suppliers. They also continued to use the Plaintiff company’s\n\nfunds for their personal benefit. They needed a continuous stream of new projects to feed\n\nthe debts of the old ones and when the drought descended upon the company after 1997 (when\n\nno new major project was forthcoming), they realized they had run out of Peters while the\n\nnumber of Pauls continued to increase.57 The auditor, S K Lai, denied that he had advised the Third Defendant\n\nin the \"creative accounting\" that she had done with the books of the Plaintiff\n\ncompany and the Sixth Defendant. His accuser refused to come to Court to substantiate her\n\nstatements. I had no reason to doubt his testimony. The Third Defendant was quite capable\n\nof writing or rewriting the accounts herself.58 The subcontractors and suppliers that dealt with the Plaintiff\n\ncompany were not deceived so much by the false accounts as by the consequences arising\n\nfrom the false accounts. The Plaintiff company was able to maintain and renew its G8\n\nstatus and tender for public projects of unlimited value because of this and, to those in\n\nthe building industry, the G8 grading must surely be the hallmark of creditworthiness.\n\nThey were therefore deluded into entering contracts with the Plaintiff company and would\n\nbe more indulgent when told by the Plaintiff company to wait for payment or full payment.59 No formal Annual General Meeting or Directors’ Meeting was held\n\nin the Plaintiff company or its affiliates for the past several years. The Fourth and the\n\nFifth Defendants were told to append their signatures to the company’s records. If\n\nthey should protest or refuse to comply in any way, it was certain they would incur the\n\nwrath of the First Defendant and be removed as directors and most probably as employees of\n\nthe Plaintiff company as well. The two directors who knew exactly what was going on and\n\nwho could exercise their mind in the matter were the First and the Third Defendants, who\n\nwere clearly in breach of their duties as directors. Bearing in mind the peculiar\n\ncircumstances of this case and the omnipotence of the overbearing First Defendant in the\n\nPlaintiff company, I did not think that the Fourth and the Fifth Defendants should be held\n\naccountable as directors for the false accounts of the Plaintiff company.60 Similarly, where the Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Defendants (the other\n\nthree daughters) were concerned, they were also subject to the overbearing influence of\n\nthe First Defendant (more so for the twin sisters than the Ninth Defendant) and should not\n\nbe held accountable as having knowingly assisted the First and the Third Defendants in\n\ntheir breach of duty. The twin sisters were not in the office most of the time and\n\ncertainly were not involved in management decisions. The Ninth Defendant was more a\n\nfun-loving and carefree person than someone involved in account-twisting and intrigue.61 The Sixth and Seventh Defendants were in truth the alter ego of the\n\nFirst and the Second Defendants and had obviously been used to facilitate the First and\n\nThird Defendants’ breaches of duty.61 The Second Defendant was not formally appointed a director of the\n\nPlaintiff company but was patently the First Defendant’s alter ego in the company.\n\nShe was active in the business and was known to be the boss’s wife. She was the true\n\nDeputy Managing Director of the Plaintiff company and controlled the purse strings. Her\n\nwords would be obeyed by those in the Plaintiff company as unquestioningly as if they\n\nemanated from the First Defendant himself. She would fall squarely within the extended\n\nmeaning of \"director\" (as underlined) in Section 4(1) of the Companies Act which\n\nreads:\"\"director\" includes any person occupying the position\n\n  of director of a corporation by whatever name called andincludes a person in\n\n  accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of a corporation are\n\n  accustomed to actand an alternate or substitute director.\"The words underscored in the definition above are also the \"shadow\n\ndirector\" mentioned in Section 149(8) of the Companies Act.62 Millet J inRe Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd[1994] 2 BCLC 180said:\"To establish that a defendant is a shadow director of a company,\n\n  it is necessary to allege and prove :(1) who are the directors of the company, whether de facto or de jure;(2) that the defendant directed those directors how to act in relation\n\n  to the company or that he was one of the persons who did so;(3) that those directors acted in accordance with such directions; and(4) that they were accustomed so to act. What is needed is first, a\n\n  board of directors claiming and purporting to act as such; and secondly, a pattern of\n\n  behaviour in which the board did not exercise any discretion or judgment of its own, but\n\n  acted in accordance with the directions of others.\"Although the Second Defendant consulted and discussed company matters\n\nwith the Third, Fourth and Fifth Defendants, there could be no doubt who would be the\n\ndecision-maker and that they would carry out whatever she instructed them to do. She was\n\ntherefore also under the same duties along with the First and the Third Defendants and,\n\nlike her husband and her daughter, was equally guilty of a breach of those duties63 The First, Second and Third Defendants were the ones with intimate\n\nknowledge of how the Plaintiff company was faring over the years and the ins and outs of\n\nthe Plaintiff company’s money. Knowing that the Plaintiff company was in dire\n\nfinancial straits, they nevertheless used the false accounts to create the G8 veil to\n\nshield the true state of the Plaintiff company from the eyes of the subcontractors and\n\nsuppliers. They knew that the existing creditors could only be paid by the \"Rob Peter\n\nto pay Paul\" scheme described earlier and that at any one time, there would be some\n\ncreditors who could not be paid in full or at all. They had thereby carried on the\n\nbusiness of the company with intent to defraud its creditors. The three of them were\n\nclearly parties to the carrying on of the business in that manner knowingly. Indeed, they\n\nwere the directing minds. They should therefore be personally liable without any\n\nlimitation of liability for all the debts of the Plaintiff company (in this case $53.3\n\nmillion) pursuant to Section 340(1) of the Companies Act which reads:\"340.–-(1) If, in the course of the winding up of a\n\n  company or in any proceedings against a company, it appears that any business of the\n\n  company has been carried on with the intent to defraud creditors of the company or\n\n  creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the Court, on the application\n\n  of the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company, may, if it thinks proper\n\n  to do so, declare that any person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the\n\n  business in that manner shall be personally responsible, without any limitation of\n\n  liability, for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the company as the Court\n\n  directs.\"The imposition of a criminal sanction in Section 340(5) does not bar\n\nthe declaratory relief sought by the Liquidator here (see Section 39 of the Interpretation\n\nAct).64 Before the financial year 1995/1996, the Plaintiff company\n\npurportedly used the \"full completion method\" in its accounts for the projects,\n\nrecognizing and recording revenue only when the projects in question were fully completed.\n\nThe Liquidator has shown that such an accounting policy was not adhered to for the\n\nfinancial years of 1993/1994 and 1994/1995 and if such a policy had been observed, the\n\nPlaintiff company would not have the $5 million net worth necessary for a G8 grading. For\n\nfinancial year 1995/1996, the Plaintiff company then moved the losses back to the previous\n\nfinancial years by means of a Prior Year Adjustment on the basis that the \"Percentage\n\nof Completion\" method of accounting introduced by the Third Defendant was more\n\nappropriate.65 A \"one-off\" revaluation of the Plaintiff company’s\n\nplant and machinery was carried out for the financial year 1995/1996 by valuers appointed\n\nby the Plaintiff company and based on the report dated 26 September 1996, a\n\n\"Revaluation Reserve\" of some $2.6 million was reflected in the audited\n\naccounts. The Liquidator questioned the bona fides of this exercise which, in his view,\n\nwas necessitated by the prior year adjustment in order to maintain the $5 million net\n\nworth of the company. The Liquidator’s valuer testified as an expert witness and the\n\nessence of his evidence was that the revaluation appeared to have confused and combined\n\nthe two concepts of fair market value and existing or continuing use and that the values\n\ngiven were on the high side. However, the Plaintiff company’s valuer had the\n\nadvantage of inspecting the plant and machinery at the relevant time. Even if his\n\nvaluation was erroneously high in some aspects, there was no evidence to show that it was\n\ndeliberately so and that it was a result of collusion between the Plaintiff company and\n\nthe valuer.66 Between 1995 to 2000, the First and Second Defendants also\n\nperiodically caused to be transferred amounts totalling cumulatively $194 million from the\n\nPlaintiff company to their personal accounts to earn interest. While they did return the\n\nprincipal amounts and did pay personal income tax on the interest earned, this practice\n\nwas done when the Plaintiff company was insolvent. There was no reason why the Plaintiff\n\ncompany could not open an interest-bearing account. The Plaintiff company was therefore\n\ndeprived of income that should have gone into its coffers. The cumulative amount of\n\ninterest earned this way was about $280,000 calculated on the basis of the number of days\n\nthe funds were in the First and Second Defendants’ personal accounts and an average\n\ninterest rate of 4% per annum.67 The First and Second Defendants also made use of the Plaintiff\n\ncompany’s funds to purchase land to develop residential properties in Singapore.\n\nThese properties were registered in the names of the Second and the Third Defendants. As\n\nindicated earlier, 4 Kew Drive was bought and four houses were built thereon. The land\n\ncost for the plot of land was $3.1 million, out of which $2.5 million were from overdraft\n\nfacilities provided to the Second and Third Defendants by OCBC Bank and the balance was\n\nsaid to be from the First and the Second Defendants. The building costs were also funded\n\nwith a loan from the same bank. Although the Second and the Third Defendants were the\n\npurported borrowers, the interest payable was paid by the Sixth Defendant using the\n\nPlaintiff company’s funds. One of the four houses (757 Upper East Coast Road) was\n\nsold in July 1996 for $3 million reaping in profits of about $501,000 for the Second and\n\nthe Third Defendants. 755 Upper East Coast Road was occupied by the Third Defendant and\n\nher husband, the Thirteenth Defendant and their family.68 The Plaintiff company also accepted, through the First Defendant, an\n\nadditional facility from the same bank in March 1997. The remaining three houses, together\n\nwith 2 Kew Drive and an Ocean Park apartment, were mortgaged to OCBC Bank at the material\n\ntimes.69 In January 2000, 4 and 4A Kew Drive and 755 Upper East Coast Road\n\nwere purportedly sold to the Sixth Defendant at 10% above valuation to reduce the First\n\nand Second Defendants’ indebtedness to the Sixth Defendant. Although the transaction\n\nwas recorded in the accounting books of the Sixth Defendant, the properties remained in\n\nthe names of the Second and the Third Defendants.70 In the following month, those three properties together with 2 Kew\n\nDrive and the Ocean Park apartment and the balance sale proceeds of Eastwood Lodge\n\ndeveloped by the Seventh Defendant were treated as assets of the Plaintiff company in the\n\ncomputation of dividends payable to unsecured creditors for the purposes of the Judicial\n\nManagement application.71 The Ocean Park apartment (528 East Coast Road #19-03 Ocean Park) was\n\nbought by the First Defendant in March 1990. He said he could not recall whether he had\n\nborrowed the Plaintiff company’s funds in the purchase. As this property was way\n\noutside the period in question in these proceedings (1995 to 2000) and the evidence was\n\nnot compelling, I did not find that this apartment was in truth the Plaintiff\n\ncompany’s. My comments apply equally to 2 Kew Drive, the home of the First and the\n\nSecond Defendants.72 The Eastwood Lodge project was sold in April 1999. The Liquidator\n\nclaimed that the Seventh Defendant owed the Plaintiff company some $7 million while the\n\nSeventh Defendant admitted having received only $5.755 million from the Plaintiff company.\n\nHowever, the Fourth Defendant as a director of the Seventh Defendant had confirmed in\n\nwriting that the Seventh Defendant was owing the Plaintiff company about $7 million in\n\nApril 1999. Between 1995 and 2000, the Sixth Defendant also transferred about $8.66\n\nmillion to the Seventh Defendant. After the sale of the apartments in Eastwood Lodge, some\n\n$5.55 million were paid to the Plaintiff company, leaving about $1.5 million outstanding.73 It was subsequently discovered by the Liquidator that $482,000 had\n\nbeen withdrawn by the First Defendant between 28 May and 24 July 2000 after the winding up\n\norder on 26 May 2000. The Second Defendant testified that they needed this amount as their\n\n\"living expenses\". In February 2000, the directors were also expecting $1.024\n\nmillion as \"Balance receivable from sale of Eastwood apartments (receivable after\n\nCSC)\" and treated that amount as the Plaintiff company’s asset in its\n\ncomputation of dividends payable to unsecured creditors. It was not shown what had\n\nhappened to the $1.024 million.74 Clearly, therefore the Plaintiff company’s funds had been used\n\nthrough the instrumentality of the Sixth and the Seventh Defendants to develop the four\n\nhouses and Eastwood Lodge and the company had an interest in them or in their sale\n\nproceeds.75 On 2 March 2000, the Third Defendant appointed the Eleventh\n\nDefendant (her sister) as her attorney to sell 4, 4A and 755 Upper East Coast Road. Her\n\nrole was only to sign for the Third Defendant. Every aspect of the sale was apparently\n\ntaken care of by the First, Second and the Third Defendants and their solicitors. All the\n\nfive mortgaged properties were sold between 15 March 2000 and 9 May 2000 after a letter of\n\ndemand dated 15 March 2000 was received from OCBC Bank. The proceeds were used to\n\ndischarge the loan from the bank. However, there appeared to be a surplus of about\n\n$500,000 unaccounted for after the indebtedness to the bank (about $11 million) was\n\ndischarged.76 Between November 1994 and April 1997, the Plaintiff company\n\ntransferred a total of $984,899.60 to the Eighth Defendant in Australia. By a\n\nDirectors’ resolution in April 1998, the debt was transferred from the Eighth\n\nDefendant to the First Defendant. The First and the Second Defendants used the Plaintiff\n\ncompany’s funds to purchase properties in Australia in the name of the Eighth\n\nDefendant. Two have been identified – 39A Hydebrae Street, Sydney and the Goderich\n\nStreet apartment in Perth. 39A Hydebrae Street was one of the two houses built on the\n\nproperty known as 39 Hydebrae Street. The other was sold in 1996. Another, 70 Barker Road,\n\nwas said by the First Defendant to have been sold and the proceeds spent for living\n\nexpenses. The Twelfth Defendant (the Second Defendant’s younger sister in Australia)\n\ntestified that 70 Barker Road was sold in September 1999 for about A$800,000.77 In all likelihood, the sale proceeds of 70 Barker Road were used to\n\npurchase 17 Woodward Avenue in December 1999, the large house in Australia which the Tongs\n\nare now living in. The Twelfth Defendant’s evidence was self-contradictory. If her\n\nsister (the Second Defendant) did not have enough funds to purchase a larger house, it was\n\nindeed strange that her husband (the First Defendant) could then give the Twelfth\n\nDefendant a loan of A$670,000 for the purchase of 17 Woodward Avenue. Further, this was\n\nthe only property in her sole name unlike the others which she had purchased earlier with\n\nher husband. Being so highly geared financially already, what was her purpose in\n\npurchasing such a large house at A$1.47 million?78 The timing was also uncanny – the agreement was entered into at\n\nthe time when the Tongs were obviously preparing to move permanently from Singapore to\n\nAustralia. The size of the house also coincided with the desire of the Tongs for more\n\nspacious accommodation and the rental that they claimed they were paying to the Twelfth\n\nDefendant was nebulous. The loan of A$800,000 came about only in August 2000, some five\n\nmonths after the completion of the purchase. Together with the facts that the name of the\n\nEighth Defendant was changed in January 2000 and the rumours that were rife in Singapore\n\nthat the First Defendant had siphoned off lots of money to Australia, I had no doubt\n\nwhatsoever that 17 Woodward Avenue was bought by the Twelfth Defendant under the\n\ninstructions of the First and the Second Defendants and that the funds for that purchase\n\nwere from the Eighth Defendant which was in turn funded by the Plaintiff company. Adverse\n\ninferences must be drawn against the Twelfth Defendant for her reluctance to produce the\n\nEighth Defendant’s records. The alleged untimely burglary and vandalization in the\n\nTwelfth Defendant’s accountants’ office were nothing more than a lame excuse\n\ntowards this end.79 It was also clear that the Plaintiff company’s funds of up to\n\n$3.7 million were utilized by the First, Second and the Third Defendants for their\n\npersonal benefit between 1996 and 2000 when the Plaintiff company was having difficulties\n\npaying its creditors. Examples of such personal benefit were detailed by the Liquidator as\n\npayment of income tax, payment for share transactions and for personal investments in\n\nAustralia.80 Where remuneration paid to the First, Second and Third Defendants by\n\nthe Plaintiff company and the Sixth Defendant was concerned, I did not think it right to\n\nhold that once a person is found to have acted in breach of his fiduciary duties, he has\n\nto disgorge all payments made to him by way of salary. The question must be asked whether\n\nthe salary of the First, Second and the Third Defendants was something they would have\n\nbeen entitled to if they had not breached their fiduciary duties. Plainly, they could not\n\nbe expected to work for free once the company became insolvent. The payment of the salary\n\nwas not the breach itself, unlike unjust enrichment situations where the money in the\n\nhands of the person who has breached his duties would not have been there but for the\n\nbreach.81 The Liquidator also alleged conspiracy on the part of the Defendants\n\nto injure and/or damage the Plaintiff company by the use of unlawful means. In the light\n\nof what I have discussed above, clearly the First, Second, Third and the Sixth Defendants\n\nwere involved in such a conspiracy and should be liable for the loss/damage suffered to\n\nthe extent of $53.3 million.82 The claim against the Thirteenth Defendant was for a declaration\n\nthat 755 Upper East Coast Road was sold by the Second and the Third Defendants to him in\n\nbreach of Section 73B of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act which provides:\"(1) Except as provided in this section, every conveyance of\n\n  property, made whether before or after 12thNovember 1993, with intent to\n\n  defraud creditors, shall be voidable, at the instance of any person thereby prejudiced.(2) This section does not affect the law relating to bankruptcy for the\n\n  time being in force.(3) This section does not extend to any estate or interest in property\n\n  disposed of for valuable consideration and in good faith or upon good consideration and in\n\n  good faith to any person not having, at the time of the disposition, notice of intent to\n\n  defraud creditors.\"The Liquidator argued that the sale in March 2000 at $1.7 million when\n\nthe Second and the Third Defendants had already left Singapore was consistent with their\n\nintention to make themselves judgment-proof.83 The sale at that price was approved by OCBC Bank, the mortgagee,\n\neven if it appeared to be below open market valuation. The documentary evidence pertaining\n\nto the completion emanating from the Thirteenth Defendant’s solicitors showed that no\n\npayment was made for the option or upon its exercise until completion on 14 July 2000.\n\nThis contradicted the Thirteenth Defendant’s evidence that he paid $10,000 for the\n\noption, 10% of the purchase price (including the $10,000) upon the exercise of the option\n\nand another 10% on completion.84 There was no dispute that the Thirteenth Defendant utilized $170,000\n\nof his CPF savings and took a bank loan of $1,190,000. The bone of contention was the\n\nsource of the 20% cash outlay ($340,000). He stated it was from his savings and later\n\namplied that to his savings, winnings from gambling, a loan from one of his brothers,\n\nmoney left to him by his deceased mother and a three-year loan of $230,000 from the Second\n\nDefendant’s youngest sister, Peggy Koo. He denied that it had anything to do with the\n\n$350,000 withdrawn by the First Defendant from the Seventh Defendant in May 2000. The\n\nFourth Defendant expressed surprise that Peggy Koo had lent $230,000 to the Thirteenth\n\nDefendant. When he was required to put up bail of $350,000 after he was charged for\n\ncriminal offences by the CPIB and approached Peggy Koo (his sister) for a loan, she said\n\nshe could only afford to lend $10,000. Secondly, he did not think that the Thirteenth\n\nDefendant and Peggy Koo were very close to each other. It should be noted that his bail\n\nmoney was required only in February 2001, about 10 or 11 months after Peggy Koo was said\n\nto have made the loan to the Thirteenth Defendant. No party called Peggy Koo to testify in\n\nCourt.85 The Thirteenth Defendant’s gross salary was about $12,000 per\n\nmonth. His take-home pay was $10,799. He was paid a bonus of one and a half months for\n\n2000. The monthly instalments of about $4,200 were paid from his CPF savings and with cash\n\nof $1,863 per month.86 The Liquidator also alleged that the sale price of $1.7 million was\n\nan undervalue. A valuation report by Jones Lang La Salle in December 1999 stated the open\n\nmarket value of 755 Upper East Coast Road as $1.92 million and the forced sale value at\n\n$1.7 million. Further, 4 and 4A Kew Drive, which had land areas of about 50 square metres\n\nsmaller than 755 Upper East Coast Road were sold in May 2000 at $1.66 million and in April\n\n2000 at $1.8 million respectively. Hence, despite the avowed intention of the First\n\nDefendant not to have the properties sold at a forced sale by the mortgagee bank, 755\n\nUpper East Coast Road was nonetheless sold as if it were a forced sale. Accordingly, the\n\nLiquidator asked that the sale be declared void and that the property be reconveyed to the\n\nPlaintiff company free of encumbrance with the Thirteenth Defendant having to discharge\n\nthe existing mortgages before reconveyance. He asked that 755 be sold subsequently and the\n\nnet proceeds be distributed equally between the Liquidator and the Official Assignee\n\n(because of the bankruptcy of the Third Defendant).87 The Thirteenth Defendant alleged that the Liquidator was aware of\n\nthe sale of 755 Upper East Coast Road to the Thirteenth Defendant as the details of the\n\nsale of all the five properties were clearly set out in the Third Defendant’s\n\naffidavit of 25 May 2000 in the winding up proceedings. However, he did nothing about it\n\nuntil 22 June 2000 when he instructed his solicitors to write to the solicitors for the\n\nSecond and the Third Defendants demanding that all the proceeds of sale be paid to him or\n\nbe held by the solicitors for the Second and the Third Defendants as stakeholders. The\n\nsaid Defendants’ solicitors could not accede to his demand. The proceeds of sale were\n\npaid to OCBC Bank as the mortgagee bank.88 While the Thirteenth Defendant’s evidence as to the source of\n\nthe $340,000 was far from satisfactory, it was not shown by the Liquidator that the money\n\nhad come from any of the Defendants or from the Plaintiff company’s funds. The\n\nproperty was sold at a forced sale value but that was done with the approval of the bank.\n\nIt was one of the five properties sold to discharge the outstanding loan and it could not\n\nbe said that the proceeds from the other four would be used first by the bank and that\n\nthere would therefore be a surplus. Indeed, it was the first of the five to be sold and if\n\nthe first-in, first-out principle was applied, the entire proceeds would have gone to the\n\nmortgagee-bank in any event, even if the price was for much more than $1.7 million.89 However, I rejected the Thirteenth Defendant’s claim of\n\nignorance about the Tong family’s financial woes and that he was unaware of their\n\nplans to take flight to Australia. After all, his young son (Calvin) was involved and his\n\nyounger son would be separated from his mother for a considerable period of time. It was\n\ntoo much of a coincidence that he would also be having such a \"bad patch\" with\n\nthe Third Defendant then that she would keep him totally in the dark about what was going\n\non.90 In the financial analysis, the bank was not defrauded and the other\n\ncreditors of the Second Defendant, the Third Defendant or the Plaintiff company could not\n\nhave been defrauded. It was therefore difficult to infer an \"intent to defraud\n\ncreditors\" in the circumstances. The Liquidator therefore failed in his claim against\n\nthe Thirteenth Defendant. In any event, it could not be right to make the Thirteenth\n\nDefendant pay the bank and the CPF the amounts he had borrowed in order that the Plaintiff\n\ncompany or the Official Assignee could benefit.91 This case has demonstrated the great difficulties involved in\n\nidentifying the sources of funds and the way they were used or rolled over. Having made\n\nthe conclusions set out above and with the consequential orders that would follow\n\ntherefrom, I did not think it necessary that these proceedings should be further extended\n\nby making tracing orders against the First, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh and the Eighth\n\nDefendants.",
        "THE ORDERS MADE": "92 The orders made are set out in the sequence in which the relevant\n\nprayers for relief appeared in the Amended Statement of Claim. I granted judgment against\n\nthe First, Second, Third and Sixth Defendants for the loss/damage suffered by the\n\nPlaintiff company by reason of the conspiracy to injure by unlawful means in the sum of\n\n$53.3 million. Alternatively, the said Defendants were liable to the Plaintiff company for\n\nthe said loss/damage as constructive trustees.93 I gave judgment against the First, Second and Third Defendants for\n\nthe loss/damage suffered by the Plaintiff company by reason of their breaches of fiduciary\n\nduty in the sum of $53.3 million and granted the declaration sought that the said\n\nDefendants were constructive trustees for the Plaintiff company in respect of the said sum\n\nand that they should account to the Plaintiff company for this sum and pay it to the\n\nPlaintiff company accordingly. I also granted a declaration that the four properties\n\ndeveloped on the land previously known as 4 Kew Drive were held in trust for the Plaintiff\n\ncompany.94 I granted a declaration that the First, Second and Third Defendants\n\nwere knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business of the Plaintiff company with\n\nintent to defraud its creditors and that they were liable to the Plaintiffs for the said\n\n$53.3 million. Alternatively, the said Defendants were liable as constructive trustees.95 Judgment was ordered against the Eighth and the Twelfth Defendants\n\nfor a declaration that they held $984,899.60 as constructive trustees for the Plaintiff\n\ncompany and that they should account to the Plaintiff company for the said sum. They were\n\nalso declared the constructive trustees for the Plaintiff company in respect of the\n\nfollowing Australian properties:(1) 39A Hydebrae Street, Sydney;(2) Stamford Apartment, Goderich Street, Perth; and(3) 17 Woodward Avenue, Sydney.Should all or any portion of the said $984,899.60 have been expended on\n\nany of the abovementioned three properties, the amount due would be extinguished or\n\ndiminished to that extent.96 The Plaintiff company was also given a declaration that the Seventh\n\nDefendant received $7 million from the Plaintiff company as constructive trustees and it\n\nshould account for the use of this $7 million including the outstanding amount of $1.5\n\nmillion.97 The total amount due to the Plaintiff company in respect of all the\n\nabove orders should be $53.3 million and any amount realized from any of the Defendants\n\npursuant to the above orders would reduce the total to that extent.98 The injunction dated 9 October 2000 should continue against the\n\nFirst, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and The Twelfth Defendants.99 Simple interest awarded on all sums due was to run from the date of\n\nthe Writ of Summons.100 The Plaintiff company was also awarded taxed costs against the\n\nFirst, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Twelfth Defendants. In view of the more\n\nlimited role played by the Twelfth Defendant and the insolvency of most of the other\n\nDefendants, I acceded to the request that her liability for the Plaintiff company’s\n\ncosts be limited to a fair proportion which I fixed at 25%.101 The Plaintiff company’s claims against the Fourth, Fifth,\n\nNinth, Tenth, Eleventh and Thirteenth Defendants were dismissed and the injunction against\n\nthem was discharged accordingly. There was no order to assess any damages suffered as a\n\nresult of the injunction as the Liquidator, with the knowledge gleaned from the documents\n\nmade available to him, had rightly taken out the injunction against all of them. I awarded\n\ntaxed costs to these Defendants but directed that such costs be paid by the First, Second,\n\nThird and Sixth Defendants as these proceedings were essentially the result of what they\n\nhad done.102 I also awarded a certificate for two Counsel to both Ms Belinda\n\nAng, S.C. and Mr B Mohan Singh.103 The Defendants had taken out various applications to set aside the\n\ninjunction but these were adjourned to be dealt with at the trial. In view of the above\n\norders, I made no order on these applications except that costs be in the cause.",
        "THE APPEALS": "104 In Civil Appeal 600124 of 2001, the Eighth and the Twelfth\n\nDefendants are appealing to the Court of Appeal against those parts of my decision\n\naffecting them. In Civil Appeal 600128 of 2001, the First, Second and the Third Defendants\n\nare appealing against those parts of my decision affecting them. Civil Appeal 600130 of\n\n2001 is the appeal by the Plaintiff company against the dismissal of its claim against the\n\nThirteenth Defendant and the refusal to make tracing orders against the First, Second,\n\nThird, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Defendants.Sgd:TAY YONG KWANGJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
