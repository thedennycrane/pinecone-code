        "Background": "2 The dispute arose out of two agreements entered into by the parties concerning arrangements for providing two power plants in India (the “Project”). 3 On or around 15 January 2013, CUX entered into a Term Sheet with CUZ. On 25 February 2013, two agreements were executed between the claimants and the respondent, with the respondent replacing another company as the claimants’ partner in the Project. 4 Those agreements (the “Agreements”) were: (a) A Share Subscription Agreement dated 25 February 2013 (the “SSA”) under which CUW was the “Promoter”, CUX was the “Company”, and the respondent was the “Investor”. Under the SSA, CUX agreed to issue and allot equity shares to the respondent and the respondent agreed to subscribe to those equity shares. (b) A Shareholders’ Agreement dated 25 February 2013 (the “SHA”) which set out the rights and obligations of the parties as shareholders in CUX. 5 Pursuant to the SSA, the respondent was to invest INR5.64b into the Project as a subscription to equity shares in CUX in three tranches: (a) INR210m (the “First Tranche Investment”); (b) INR270m (the “Second Tranche Investment”); and (c) INR 2.41b (the “Third Tranche Investment”). 6 The respondent made the First Tranche Investment on 7 June 2013 and obtained certain management rights in CUX, including the right to nominate one director to CUX’s board of directors. The Second Tranche Investment was made on 16 August 2013. 7 Under the SSA, there was a condition precedent that CUX would enter into a Common Loan Agreement (the “CLA”) with certain finance companies (collectively, the “Lenders”) in relation to the debt financing for the Project, prior to the Third Tranche Investment from the respondent. 8 The respondent raised objections to the terms of the draft CLA and, in particular, contended that those terms requested amendments which were contrary to the terms of the respondent’s investment in the Project, including a “no guarantee” provision in cl 19 of the SHA. The claimants contended that despite their attempts in 2014 and 2015 to address and resolve the respondent’s alleged concerns and objections to the draft CLA, the respondent refused to agree to the terms of the CLA. 9 On 17 December 2015, the respondent issued a letter alleging that the Project cost had increased by more than 20% and that the expected commercial operation date had been delayed by more than 24 months. 10 On 18 April 2016, the respondent issued to CUW and CUY a Material Adverse Change Notice (“MAC Notice”) under the SSA on the basis that a material adverse change on the Project had occurred and was still subsisting and calling on CUW to cure the MAC. 11 In addition, the respondent also objected to awarding [VVV] the contract for the works which formed the balance of project (“BOP” works) on the basis that a sole engineering, procurement, construction (“EPC”) contractor should be appointed to carry out both the boiler, turbine and generator work (“BTG”) and the BOP works. 12 On 30 May 2016, CUW, on behalf of itself, CUX and CUY issued a letter to the respondent in which it sought to terminate the Agreements (the “May 2016 Letter”) on the basis that the respondent had committed a repudiatory breach of the Agreements and that the repudiation was accepted with effect from 18 April 2016, the date of the MAC Notice. 13 On 22 December 2017, the respondent (as claimant) commenced the Arbitration against the claimants (as respondents) by filing a notice of arbitration (the “Notice of Arbitration”) referring disputes under the SSA and SHA to arbitration. Under the SIAC Rules, the Notice of Arbitration was treated as commencing two arbitrations which were then consolidated under the SIAC Rules (6th edition, 1 August 2016) (“SIAC Rules”). The appointment of the arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”) was completed on 4 May 2018. 14 On 25 July 2018, the respondent sent a written notice to the claimants (the “July 2018 Letter”) stating that the issuance of the purported termination letter of 30 May 2016, as well as the allegations in it, cumulatively or otherwise amounted to a repudiation of the Agreements, which the respondent accepted. 15 In the Arbitration, the claimants submitted that they had validly terminated the Agreements by way of the May 2016 Letter due to the respondent’s conduct in obstructing the CLA. They also contended that even if their termination on 30 May 2016 was wrongful, the respondent affirmed the Agreements. The respondent’s position in the Arbitration was that its conduct in relation to the CLA was not a breach of the Agreements. Further, it contended that it did not affirm the Agreements after the May 2016 Letter. It also contended that, even if it did affirm the Agreements, the claimants committed a continuing repudiatory breach by treating the Agreements as terminated after 30 May 2016 so that it was entitled to terminate the Agreements on 25 July 2018. 16 During the course of the Arbitration, the claimants filed an “Application for Early Dismissal of Claims” dated 26 October 2018 (“EDA Application”). That Application was heard on 31 January 2019 and the Tribunal’s Partial Award deciding the EDA Application was issued on 20 September 2019 (the “Partial Award”). 17 Directions were given by the Tribunal which led to a final oral hearing on 28 July 2021. The Tribunal then made the Award on 11 February 2022. 18 The claimants commenced these proceedings by way of an Originating Application in the High Court on 10 May 2022. The proceedings were then transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court on 28 July 2022. Following a virtual case management conference on 20 September 2022, the virtual hearing took place on 27 October 2022.",
        "The Application to set aside the Award": "19 The claimants seek to set aside the Award on the following grounds: (a) That the Tribunal, in breach of natural justice, failed to consider the claimants’ arguments that the respondent had, by its conduct, affirmed the Agreements following the issuance of the May 2016 Letter, thereby disentitling the respondent from subsequently terminating the Agreements for the same breach (the “Affirmation Defence Ground”). (b) That the Tribunal, in breach of natural justice, in considering whether the respondent’s conduct in relation to the CLA was reasonable, failed to consider the claimants’ arguments that the respondent’s objection to being classified as a “promoter” in the CLA was only an afterthought (the “Afterthought Argument Ground”). (c) That the Tribunal, in breach of natural justice, failed to consider the claimants’ argument that the respondent had breached cl 16.5 of the SHA (the “Clause 16.5 Breach Ground”) and had thereby committed a repudiatory breach of the Agreements, which breach the claimants accepted in their May 2016 Letter. (d) That the Tribunal, in breach of natural justice, having made a finding in the Partial Award that it would not make any ruling that CUY would be jointly and severally liable with CUW and CUX for any breach of the Agreements and having made findings at paragraphs 215 to 225 of the Partial Award, ruled in the Award that CUY is jointly and severally liable with CUW and CUX which is inconsistent with the Partial Award and CUY was deprived of an opportunity to be heard on cl 14.1 of the SSA ( the “Inconsistency Ground”).",
        "The legal basis for setting aside an award for breach of natural justice": "20 The relevant grounds for setting aside an arbitral award are contained in s 24(b) of the IAA which provides that: Court may set aside award 24.Despite Article 34(1) of the Model Law, the General Division of the High Court may, in addition to the grounds set out in Article 34(2) of the Model Law, set aside the award of the arbitral tribunal if –– … (b) a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the award by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced. 21 It is common ground that, as set out inSoh Beng Tee & Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“Soh Beng Tee”), a party challenging an arbitration award as having contravened the rules of natural justice has to establish the following: (a) which rule of natural justice was breached; (b) how it was breached; (c) in what way the breach was connected to the making of the award; and (d) how the breach prejudiced its rights (at [29]). 22Soh Beng Teeis also authority for the following propositions: (a) The threshold for a finding of breach of natural justice is a high one and it is only in an “exceptional case” that a court will find that threshold crossed (at [54]). (b) The setting aside application cannot be a stage where a dissatisfied party can have a second bite at the cherry (at [65(b)]). (c) The failure of an arbitrator to refer every point for decision to the parties for submissions is not invariably a valid ground for challenge. Only in instances such as where the impugned decision reveals a dramatic departure from the submissions, or involves an arbitrator receiving extraneous evidence, or adopts a view wholly at odds with the established evidence adduced by the parties, or arrives at a conclusion unequivocally rejected by the parties as being trivial or irrelevant, might it be appropriate for a court to intervene. In short, there must be a real basis for alleging that the arbitrator has conducted the arbitral process either irrationally or capriciously. The overriding burden on the applicant is to show that a reasonable litigant in his shoes could not have foreseen the possibility of reasoning of the type revealed in the award (at [65(d)]). (d) Each case should be decided within its own factual matrix. It must always be borne in mind that it is not the function of the court to assiduously comb an arbitral award microscopically in attempting to determine if there was any blame or fault in the arbitral process; rather, an award should be read generously such that only meaningful breaches of the rules of natural justice that have actually caused prejudice are ultimately remedied (at [65(f)]). (e) Even if there had been a breach of the rules of natural justice, a causal nexus must be established between the breach and the award made (at [73]). (f) In addition, the breach must have prejudiced the rights of the parties concerned. A breach of natural justice alone is distinct from satisfying the “prejudice” requirement (at [84]). 23 InBZV v BZW and another[2022] 3 SLR 447 (“BZV (HC)”) the applicable principles were summarised at [52] as follows: (a) The grounds for setting aside an award are to be construed and applied bearing in mind the policy of minimal curial intervention in arbitration. (b) An application to set aside an award is not a pretext for the losing party to appeal on the merits against the tribunal’s award. (c) A court hearing a setting-aside application will not strive to find fault with the tribunal or to find errors in the award. (d) A court will set aside an award only if the breach of natural justice is “demonstrably clear on the face of the record without the need to pore over thousands of pages of facts and submissions”. (e) The fundamental touchstone of the fair hearing rule is naturally the concept of “fairness”. But there are two sides to fairness. It is, of course, unfair to the losing party if the tribunal did not give it a fair hearing. But it is equally unfair to the successful party if it is deprived of the fruits of its success on an arid or technical challenge mountedex post facto. The court will therefore read the award generously in order to remedy only meaningful breaches of natural justice which have caused actual prejudice. (f) A breach of the fair hearing rule can arise from the tribunal’s failure to apply its mind to the essential issues arising from the parties’ arguments. The court will give the tribunal “fair latitude” to determine what is and is not an essential issue and also when reading the award to determine whether the tribunal failed to apply its mind to the essential issues. (g) The fact that a tribunal’s decision is inexplicable is only one factor which goes towards establishing that the tribunal failed to apply its mind to the essential issues arising from the parties’ arguments. If a fair reading of the award shows that the tribunal did apply its mind to the essential issues “but failed to comprehend the submissions or comprehended them erroneously, and thereby came to a decision which may fall to be characterised as inexplicable”, that will be simply an error of fact or law and the award will not be set aside. (h) So too, the fact that an award fails to address one of the parties’ arguments expressly does not, in itself, mean that the tribunal failed to apply its mind to that argument. There may be a valid alternative explanation for the failure. (i) An award will therefore not be set aside on the ground that the tribunal failed to apply its mind to an essential issue arising from the parties’ arguments unless the failure is a clear and virtually inescapable inference from the award. (j) A breach of the fair hearing rule can also arise from the chain of reasoning which the tribunal adopts in its award. To comply with the fair hearing rule, the tribunal’s chain of reasoning must be: (a) one which the parties had reasonable notice that the tribunal could adopt; and (b) one which has a sufficient nexus to the parties’ arguments. (k) A party has reasonable notice of a particular chain of reasoning (and of the issues forming the links in that chain) if: (a) it arose from the parties’ pleadings; (b) it arose by reasonable implication from their pleadings; (c) it is unpleaded but arose in some other way in the arbitration and was reasonably brought to the party’s actual notice; or (d) it flows reasonably from the arguments actually advanced by either party or is related to those arguments. (l) To set aside an award on the basis of a defect in the chain of reasoning, a party must establish that the tribunal conducted itself either irrationally or capriciously such that “a reasonable litigant in his shoes could not have foreseen the possibility of reasoning of the type revealed in the award”. A tribunal’s failure to hear from the challenging party on every single link in its chain of reasoning is therefore not in itself a breach of natural justice. It is also not in itself a breach of natural justice for the tribunal’s chain of reasoning to adopt a middle path between the parties’ diametrically opposed cases, whether on the appropriate inferences to be drawn from the primary facts, on the state or effect of the law or on the application of the law to the facts. Adopting a chain of reasoning, or a particular issue as a link in that chain, will be a breach of natural justice only if it represents a dramatic departure from the parties’ cases, is wholly at odds with the established evidence or arrives at a conclusion unequivocally rejected by both parties as being trivial or irrelevant. 24 The claimants also rely on a passage inBZW and another v BZV[2022] 1 SLR 1080 (“BZV (CA)”) where the Court of Appeal, while rejecting the challenge toBZV HC, stated at [54] that: … While generally speaking an assertion of a breach of the fair hearing rule does not require the degree of study of the Award and the record that the Judge undertook in this case, the allegations here that the impugned portions of the Award had no nexus to the case as actually presented to the Tribunal, required the exercise that the Judge undertook. If it takes time to make sense of an award to ascertain whether an important point was overlooked or addressed at all or whether the tribunal decided on a point that the parties did not have the opportunity to address, then the judge will have to look at the award, the pleadings, the submissions and any other documents that may throw light on what happened in the arbitral proceedings and what cases the parties were running. Then the judge will have to analyse the award in some depth in order to decide whether the allegations made by the party seeking to impugn the award on the basis of breach of natural justice have substance. 25 The claimants also refer to the decision of the Court of Appeal inGlaziers Engineering PteLtd v WCS Engineering Construction Pte Ltd[2018] 2 SLR 1311 at [37] where the court observed that: It was in view of these specific concerns that this court stated inAKN v ALCthat we would only infer that the decision-maker had wholly failed to consider an issue if the inference was clear and virtually inescapable. That is not to say that the applicant who alleges such a breach of natural justice must do anything more than to establish its case on the balance of probabilities. In fact, the statement (at [46]) that the court will not draw the inference against the decision-maker “… if the facts arealso consistentwith the [decision-maker] simply having misunderstood the aggrieved party’s case, or having been mistaken as to the law, or having chosen not to deal with [the] point …” [emphasis added] dovetails with the rule that the applicant must show that the facts are more consistent with the decision-maker having failed to consider the point entirely – that is to say, the applicant must show that this hypothesis ismore likely than not. 26 The respondent also refers toFront Row Investment Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Daimler South East Asia Pte Ltd[2010] SGHC 806 (“Front Row”) where it was held at [31] that “a court or tribunal will be in breach of natural justice if in the course of reaching its decision, it disregarded the submissions and arguments made by the parties on the issues (without considering the merits thereof)”. 27 The respondent submits that a breach of natural justice only occurs if the arbitrator had regard to the submissions made by a party during the hearing but did not really try to understand them and so failed to deal with the matter substantively and refers toFront Rowat [37] as well asAKN and another v ALC and others and other appeals[2015] 3 SLR 488 (“AKN”). It also refers to the decision inTMM Division Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Maine Pte Ltd [2013] 4 SLR 972(“TMMDivision”) and submits that the central inquiry in all such cases is whether the award reflects the fact that the arbitral tribunal had applied its mind to the critical issues and arguments. It further refers to a passage inAQU v AQV[2015] SGHC 269 where it was said that “courts should not undertake a review of the substantive merits of the underlying dispute between the parties” (at [32]). 28 In relation to the arbitral tribunal’s duty to give reasons and explanations, the respondent refers toSEF Construction Pte Ltd v Skoy Connected Pte Ltd[2010] 1 SLR 733 (“SEF”) where it was held at [60] that the fact that the tribunal did not feel it necessary to discuss its reasoning and explicitly state its conclusions does not necessarily mean that the tribunal did not have regard to those submissions at all, because it may be an accidental omission on its part or it may have found the points so unconvincing that it thought it was not necessary to explicitly state his findings. Further, the court stated that “[n]atural justice requires that the parties should be heard; it does not require that they be given responses on all submissions made”. 29 The respondent also refers toTMMwhere the court held that even if some of an arbitral tribunal’s conclusions are bereft of reasons, that is not necessarily fatal. There are a variety of reasons why an arbitral tribunal may elect not to say something. The crux is whether the contents of the arbitral award taken as a whole inform the parties of the bases on which the arbitral tribunal reached its decision on the material or essential issues (at [104]). 30 It also refers toAKNwhere it was stated at [46] that: … It will usually be a matter of inference rather than of explicit indication that the arbitrator wholly missed one or more important pleaded issues. However, the inference – that the arbitrator indeed failed to consider an important pleaded issue – if it is to be drawn at all, must be shown to be clear and virtually inescapable. If the facts are also consistent with the arbitrator simply having misunderstood the aggrieved party’s case, or having been mistaken as to the law, or having chosen not to deal with a point pleaded by the aggrieved party because he thought it unnecessary (notwithstanding that this view may have been formed based on a misunderstanding of the aggrieved party’s case), then the inference that the arbitrator did not apply his mind at all to the dispute before him (or to an important aspect of that dispute) and so acted in breach of natural justice shouldnotbe drawn. 31 The respondent also refers toAKNand says that the court clarified the “important distinction” between an arbitral tribunal’s decision to reject an argument (whether implicitly or otherwise, whether rightly or wrongly, and whether or not as a result of its failure to comprehend the argument and so to appreciate its merits) and the arbitral tribunal’s failure to even consider that argument. Only the latter amounts to a breach of natural justice. The former is an error of law, not a breach of natural justice (AKNat [47]). 32 It also relies onTMMwhere the court stated that no party to an arbitration has a right to have its evidence believed, just as no party has a right to have its submissions comprehended and consequently accepted (at [120]). 33 The respondent also submits that: (a) There is no right of recourse to the courts to set aside the arbitral award if an arbitrator has simply made an error of law and/or fact and relies onBLC and others v BLB and another[2014] 4 SLR 79 (“BLC”) at [53]. (b) Poor reasoning on the part of an arbitral tribunal is not a ground to set aside an arbitral award; even a misunderstanding of the arguments put forward by a party is not such a ground and relies onAKNat [59]. (c) The court is not required to carry out a hypercritical or excessively syntactical analysis of what the arbitrator has written. Neither should it approach an arbitral award with a “meticulous legal eye endeavouring to pick holes, inconsistencies and faults … with the objective of upsetting or frustrating the process of arbitration” and relies onAKNat [59]. (d) The breach of natural justice cannot merely be technical or inconsequential. The arbitrator must have been denied the benefit of arguments or evidence that had a real as opposed to a fanciful chance of making a difference to his deliberations and relies onL W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal[2013] 1 SLR 125 (“LW Infrastructure”) at [54]. (e) In determining whether a matter was within the scope of parties’ submission to arbitration (and in this case the attendant issue of what the Tribunal may have considered), the Singapore Court of Appeal inCDM and another v CDP[2021] 2 SLR 235 (“CDM”) held that this must be answered by reference to five sources – the parties’ pleadings, agreed list of issues, opening statements, evidence adduced and closing submissions at the arbitration (at [18]). 34 In relation to the test to be applied, the Court of Appeal held inLW Infrastructureat [54] that: ... the issue is whether the materialcould reasonablyhave made a difference to the arbitrator; rather than whether itwould necessarilyhave done so. Where it is evident that there is no prospect whatsoever that the material if presented would have made any difference because it wholly lacked any legal or factual weight, then it could not seriously be said that the complainant has suffered actual or real prejudice in not having had the opportunity to present this to the arbitrator … 35 With those matters in mind, I now turn to consider each of the four grounds relied on by the claimants.",
        "Affirmation Defence Ground": "",
        "Claimants’ submissions": "155 The claimants submit that the Tribunal found in the Partial Award that CUY only bore secondary liability in case of an award against CUW and CUX. At [224] of the Partial Award the Tribunal stated: 224. The interpretation of Clause 14.1 [of the SSA] which gives it meaning and substance is that [the respondent] may sue [CUY] in the same proceedings instituted against [CUW] and [CUX] but can enforce any award against [CUY] only after [CUW] and [CUX] have failed or refused to comply with it. 156 The claimants submit that this paragraph of the Partial Award represents a finding by the Tribunal that CUY would only bear secondary liability in case of any award which the Tribunal may make against CUW and CUX in the Final Award. 157 Under Indian law, the claimants submit that [224] of the Partial Award represents the Tribunal’s adjudication on the effect of cl 14.1 of the SSA, which is a contractual document that is governed by Indian law, thereby finally disposing the issue on the devolution of liabilities between CUW, CUX and CUY under the Agreements 158 This finding, say the claimants, is in accordance with ss 43 (and 42) of the Indian Contract Act 1872 (Act No 9 of 1872) (India) (“Indian Contract Act”) and they refer toSham Lal vs Gurbachan Singh[1929] SCC OnLine Lah 622 at [4]. They say that these provisions permit the parties to agree that joint and several liability would not apply despite having made a joint promise in the underlying agreement. 159 Even if Indian law is not considered, the claimants submit that it is clear from a plain reading of [224] of the Partial Award that the respondent could not enforce the Final Award against CUY unless it was first unsuccessful in enforcing the Final Award against CUW and CUX. 160 However, the claimants submit that by ruling in the Award that CUY is “jointly and severally” liable with CUW and CUX to pay damages and costs to the respondent, without including any proviso that the respondent could enforce the Award against CUY only after CUW and CUX have failed or refused to comply with it, the Tribunal has effectively ascribed primary liability to CUY. Such primary liability has been ascribed because it is possible for the respondent, should it wish to do so, to proceed against CUY alone in enforcement proceedings worldwide, since he was ordered to be jointly and severally liable in respect of the respondent’s damages and costs. The claimants submit that there is no obligation for the respondent to join CUW and/or CUX, let alone prove that it has failed or refused to comply with the Award. 161 The claimants refer to the respondent’s contention, relying on [217] and [218] of the Partial Award, that the Tribunal determined that the wording in cl 14.1 did not introduce a qualification as to when the joint liability of all the claimants could be ascertained. However, the claimants submit that the Tribunal did not make any such “determination” or “finding” in the Partial Award. Rather, the claimants submit that [215] to [223] of the Partial Award merely set out the Tribunal’s chain of reasoning which support its finding at [224] that CUY would only bear secondary liability in case of any award which the Tribunal may make in the Arbitration. 162 In this regard, the claimants say that it is clear from [215] to [223] of the Partial Award that the Tribunal was concerned with the hypothetical of what would happen if CUY could not be joined as a co-respondent in the same proceedings with CUW and CUX and it was only at [224] that the Tribunal pronounced its view on the “interpretation of Clause 14.1 which gives it meaning and substance”. 163 The claimants also says that there is evidence showing that the respondent, itself, had come to the conclusion that the Tribunal had found that CUY only bore secondary liability when, at paragraph 159 of its written closing submissions it accepted that it must first pursue CUW and CUX before CUY on enforcement. 164 Accordingly, the claimants submit that the Tribunal’s finding at [224] of the Partial Award was inconsistent with the Tribunal’s orders/rulings in the Award that CUY is jointly and severally liable to pay damages and costs to the respondent. 165 On the basis that the Award is inconsistent with the Partial Award, the claimants submit that a breach of the fair hearing rule has occurred as they were not given an opportunity to address the Tribunal on the effect of cl 14.1 of the SSA prior to the Tribunal’s decision to depart from its finding in [224] of the Partial Award that CUY only bore secondary liability in respect of any award made in the Arbitration. The claimants say that they were not informed by the Tribunal that it was considering making a ruling in the Award that was inconsistent with its finding in [224] of the Partial Award. 166 Furthermore, the claimants say that [224] of the Partial Award caused the claimants to believe that the Tribunal would not, in the Award, make any ruling that CUY was jointly and severally liable with CUW and/or CUX, that is that CUY bore primary liability for breach of the Agreements. 167 As [224] of the Partial Award represents a final and binding pronouncement by the Tribunal on the issue of devolution of liabilities between CUW, CUX and CUY under the Agreements, the claimants submit that, under Indian law, such a finding made in a partial award is final and cannot be re-adjudicated, unless it is first set aside. It refers toIndian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Limited v Bhadra Products[2018] 2 SCC 534 at [13] to [15]. 168 Further, under Singapore law which is the law of the seat of the Arbitration, partial and interim awards are final and binding and it refers to s 19B of the IAA andPT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK v CRW Joint Operation[2015] 4 SLR 364 at [46] to [48]. 169 The claimants submit that CUY has suffered actual or real prejudice because had CUY been given notice that the Tribunal would be departing from its finding at [224] of the Partial Award, CUY would have made further submissions on the effect of cl 14.1 of the SSA. 170 On that basis, the claimants say that it is entirely possible that counsel would have reminded the Tribunal that it could not depart from its findings at [224] under Singapore law and, if the Tribunal had the benefit of those submissions, the claimants submit that the Tribunal could reasonably have decided against ordering that CUY was jointly and severally liable to pay damages and costs to the respondent, without reference to the fact that CUY’s liability was only secondary in nature. 171 The claimants also submit that the mere fact that it is open for CUY to challenge enforceability of the Award in any foreign jurisdiction where the respondent may wish to enforce the Award would not cure the prejudice suffered. First, CUY would have to incur additional costs for defending the right to be held not jointly and severally liable to the amounts set out in the Award, without the respondent having first proceeded against CUW and CUX and being unsuccessful. Having already defended the right not to be held jointly and severally liable under for breaches under the SHA and SSA and consequently already having incurred those costs, the claimants submit that CUY would have to incur additional costs to address the very same assertions which were disposed of by the Partial Award. 172 Secondly, the claimants say that there is no guarantee that courts in foreign jurisdictions would accept that the Award cannot override findings made in the Partial Award. The rules of the enforcing court may be subject to standards different to Singapore or Indian Law. 173 On that basis, the claimants submit that CUY has suffered real and actual prejudice should those parts of the Award not be set aside.",
        "Respondent’s submissions": "174 The respondent says that CUY’s argument that he was deprived of the opportunity to present his case on cl 14.1 of the SSA is based on his claim that the finding in the Award that he was jointly and severally liable towards the respondent is at odds with the Partial Award finding that the respondent has to enforce against CUW and CUX first before looking to CUY. CUY claims that this was an unexpected and unanticipated finding, and he was deprived of an opportunity to address it. 175 The respondent says that CUY conceded that the claimants did not make the argument in the Arbitration that the findings in the Partial Award barred any finding on joint and several liability against him. 176 The Partial Award arose out of CUY’s application for an early dismissal of certain claims by the respondent. In that application, the respondent says that CUY argued that cl 14.1 of the SSA required the respondent first to exhaust all legal remedies available to it against CUW and CUX before it could mount any claim against CUY. In essence, CUY argued that he only bore secondary liability, as compared to primary liability, through the operation of cl 14.1 of the SSA. 177 The respondent refers to cl 14.1 of the SSA which provided that: [CUY], being in Control of [CUW], shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations and liabilities of [CUW] under this [SSA],provided, however, that in the event of any breach by [CUW] and [CUY] or [CUX] under [the SSA], [the respondent] shall first exhaust all legal remedies available to it under Applicable Law against the other Indemnifying Parties and thereafter seek recourse for any unsuccessful unappealable claims against [CUY] 178 The respondent says that it is not disputed that the Indemnifying Parties refer to the claimants. “Indemnifying Parties” was defined in cl 13.2.2 of the SSA as follows: The Indemnified Party I and the Indemnified Party III shall, for, the purposes of this Clause 13, collectively be referred to as the“Indemnified Parties”and individually as an“Indemnified Party”. The Indemnifying Party I, Indemnifying Party II and Indemnifying Party III shall collectively be referred, to as the“Indemnifying Parties”and individually an“Indemnifying Party”. 179 The Tribunal’s findings in respect of the claimants’ application for early dismissal and their interpretation of cl 14.1 of the SSA were set out in [216] to [225] of the Partial Award which the respondent summarises as follows: (a) At [216] of the Partial Award, the Tribunal drew a distinction between the use of the term joint and several liability and the proviso which relates to enforcement against CUW and CUX. (b) At [217] of the Partial Award, the Tribunal found that the proviso does not introduce a qualification as to when joint and several liability may be ascertained, that is that the proviso does not require claims against CUY to only be decided after liability is established or not established against CUW or CUX. (c) At [218] to [219] and [221] to [222] of the Partial Award, the Tribunal rationalised its findings. (d) At [220] of the Partial Award, the Tribunal found that “recourse” in cl 14.1 meant enforcement of any award against CUW and CUX. (e) At [223] of the Partial Award, the Tribunal highlighted that any interpretation of cl 14.1 of the SSA should not make the “joint and several” liability of CUY meaningless. (f) At [224] of the Partial Award, the Tribunal found that the proper interpretation of cl 14.1 is that the respondent can sue CUY in the same proceedings as CUW and CUX, but can only enforce any award against CUY after CUW or CUX refuses to comply with such an award. 180 On that basis, the respondent submits that the Tribunal rejected CUY’s claim that he only bore secondary liability and expressly sought to give effect to the phrase “jointly and severally liable” in cl 14.1. The Tribunal drew a distinction in its findings that CUY could be liable (jointly and severally) but that any enforcement against him can only be embarked upon after CUW and CUX refused to comply with any award. The respondent points out that CUY did not seek to challenge the Partial Award. 181 The respondent points out that CUY seeks to overturn the Tribunal’s finding that he is jointly and severally liable on the basis that the Partial Award bars such a finding. But, the respondent says, if that were true what would be the possible finding against CUY? It points out that CUY was sued under the Agreements and that the application for early dismissal and for CUY to be removed as a party was dismissed. The Arbitration proceedings therefore continued and CUY actively participated in the proceedings with CUW and CUX with representation from solicitors. CUY was seeking,inter alia, a dismissal of the claims against him but as the respondent succeeded in the Arbitration, CUY offers no alternate theory of liability for himself. It cannot be on the basis of specific liability given the terms of cl 14.1 of the SSA and it cannot be on the basis of joint liability given that the Partial Award anticipates that CUY would be liable for any shortfall following enforcement against CUW and CUX. The respondent submits that CUY does not articulate the basis for any liability other than joint and several liability. 182 The respondent submits that there is no contradiction between the Partial Award and the Award. 183 First, it says that it is unclear why CUY contends that joint and several liability is inconsistent with the finding of two-stage enforcement in the Partial Award. It says that joint and several liability simply means that CUY is jointly and severally liable with CUX and CUW for the same amount to the respondent and that the two-stage enforcement just affects the order which the respondent has to follow for enforcement against CUY and against CUW and CUX after liability has been established. This means, the respondent submits, that it has to try to seek recovery from CUW and CUX first before looking to CUY. It does not in any way curtail, limit or contradict CUY’s liability or the nature of CUY’s liability to the respondent. 184 The respondent says that the claimants themselves admitted at paragraph 56(i) of their Rebuttal to Reply to Early Dismissal Application dated 5 December 2018 that “the liability of the [claimants] is joint and several”. Their argument was simply that cl 14.1 of the SSA meant that the respondent should proceed against CUW and CUX first before proceeding against CUY, rather than proceed against all the claimants at the same time. In other words, they accepted that CUY could be jointly and severally liable to the respondent under cl 14.1 and their case was that, despite that, the respondent had to exhaust legal remedies against CUW and CUX first. 185 Secondly, in so far as CUY claims that Indian law interprets two-stage enforcement as being inconsistent with the concept of joint and several liability, the respondent says that this has not been established by the claimants and the authorities which the claimants relied on in their letters dated 30 September 2022 and 7 October 2022 do not establish that proposition. Instead, they simply say that parties may contract out of joint and several liability, which is the default position for breach of contract claims involving joint promises under Indian law pursuant to s 43 of the Indian Contract Act. Nor, says the respondent, do the authorities say anything about two-stage enforcement being inconsistent with the concept of joint and several liability. Conceptually, the respondent submits that the issue of joint and several liability goes to the legal liability of CUY based on breaches of contractual obligation whilst the two-stage enforcement is simply a separate contractual agreement by which the respondent would forbear to take enforcement action against CUY on his legal liability until CUW and CUX failed to pay. It says that both concepts are separate and distinct and do not contradict each other and, accordingly, CUY’s complaint that the joint and several liability finding in the Award is inconsistent with the two-stage enforcement finding in the Partial Award should be rejected because there is no such inconsistency. 186 In any event, the respondent submits that the Partial Award had already found that CUY might be jointly and severally liable under any award. In the Partial Award, the respondents says that the Tribunal dismissed the claimants’ argument that CUY had secondary liability and made clear that the two-stage enforcement provided under cl 14.1 of the SSA did not affect whether the joint and several liability finding could be made. It further anticipated that the claimants bore joint and several liability. 187 The respondent disputes CUY’s claim that the Partial Award caused him to think that he would not be held jointly and severally liable in the Award and says that there was never a dispute as to his joint and several liability to the respondent in the application for early dismissal and the Partial Award clearly set out the Tribunal’s interpretation of cl 14.1. 188 The respondent says that CUY did not argue that the findings in the Partial Award barred a finding of joint and several liability in the Arbitration. It adds that he had ample opportunity to address the Tribunal on the joint and several liability issue and was well-aware that the respondent was seeking relief against all the claimants, including CUY, on a joint and several basis. 189 Rather, the respondent says that CUY focused his defence in the Arbitration to one of defeating liability by showing there was no breach. He did not argue that if he was found liable, he should not be found liable on a joint and several basis. If the claimants considered that cl 14.1 of the SSA and/or the two-stage enforcement meant that CUY could not be held jointly and severally liable to the respondent, the respondent submits that the onus was on them to raise it to the Tribunal during the Arbitration. 190 In so far as the claimants are now alleging that Indian law provides for an exception to joint liability and that CUY can somehow rely on due to cl 14.1 of the SSA, the respondent says that this should have been raised at the stage of the early dismissal application stage, but the claimants chose not to do so and did not raise it afterwards at any point in the Arbitration nor did they seek to challenge or set aside the Partial Award. 191 The respondent also says that given the Tribunal’s statement in the Partial Award that the claimants could be found jointly and severally liable, any reasonable party in CUY’s position would have foreseen the possibility of the Tribunal making the joint and several liability finding in the Award and cannot now complain. 192 By seeking to raise the points he does on this application to set aside the Award, the respondent says that CUY is essentially trying to launch a collateral attack on the Partial Award but cannot do so. 193 Further, in so far as CUY is claiming that the Tribunal wrongly interpreted Indian law and/or cl 14.1 of the SSA, the respondent says that this is an error of law and not a breach of natural justice. 194 In any case, the respondent submits that the claimants did not suffer any prejudice, even if the Tribunal failed to give CUY an opportunity to address it on the points now made, given that the Partial Award was not challenged and/or set aside, there is no basis on which the Tribunal could have come to a different decision.",
        "My decision": "195 The Partial Award dealt with a particular issue raised by CUY. He sought the dismissal of certain claims against him in the Arbitration on the basis, as set out in [210] of the Partial Award, that cl 14.1 of the SHA required the respondent to first exhaust all legal remedies available to it against CUW and CUX before it could claim recourse against CUY. 196 At [213] of the Partial Award, the Tribunal rejected the claimants’ interpretation of cl 14.1 of the SHA and, in particular, the final part of that provision. The starting point is therefore the analysis of cl 14.1 of the SSA by the Tribunal in the Partial Award. 197 Clause 14.1 provided as follows: [CUY], being in Control of [CUW], shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations and liabilities of [CUW] under this [SSA],provided, however,that in the event of any breach by [CUW] and [CUY] or [CUX] under [the SSA], the [respondent] shall first exhaust all legal remedies available to it under Applicable Law against the other Indemnifying Parties and thereafter seek recourse for any unsuccessful un-appealable claims against [CUY] 198 It can therefore be seen that cl 14.1 consists of a statement that CUY is “jointly and severally liable for the obligations and liabilities of [CUW]”. It then has a proviso that the respondent should first exhaust all legal remedies against the other Indemnifying Parties and then seek recourse against CUY. The Partial Award was concerned with the meaning of the proviso which CUY contended meant that he should not be a party to the Arbitration. 199 In analysing the proviso in cl 14.1, the Tribunal stated, as follows at [216] and [224] of the Partial Award: 216. On a plain reading of Clause 14.1, the proviso in it makes a distinction between the joint and several liability of [CUW], [CUX] and [CUY] for the obligations of [CUW] and [CUX] under the SSA, and enforcement of any judgment obtained by the [respondent] in a claim for appropriate remedies for breaches by [CUW] and [CUX] of their SSA obligations. … 224. The interpretation of Clause 14.1 which gives it meaning and substance is that the [respondent] may sue [CUY] in the same proceedings instituted against [CUW] and [CUX] but can enforce any award against [CUY] only after [CUW] and [CUX] have failed or refused to comply with it. 200 The Tribunal therefore drew a distinction between joint and several liability in the first part of cl 14.1 and the enforcement of any judgment, dealt with in the proviso. The Tribunal therefore dismissed CUY’s application to dismiss the claims against him. 201 In the Award, the Tribunal then dealt with the question of liability. At [626] of the Award, the Tribunal held the claimants jointly and severally liable to the respondent. 202 The claimants submit that this part of the Award is inconsistent with the Partial Award. I do not agree. The Partial Award dealt not with liability but with enforcement, finding that the respondent could not enforce a judgment against CUY until after CUW and CUX have failed or refused to comply with it. That has nothing to do with liability but interpreted the proviso to cl 14.1 of the SHA which CUY had contended meant that the respondent had to proceed against CUW and CUX before proceeding against CUY. The Award then went on and made findings of liability against CUY and held that he was jointly and severally liable with CUW and CUX. 203 There is no inconsistency between the two awards. The effect of the Partial Award is that the respondent cannot enforce the Award against CUY until CUW and CUX have failed to comply with it. It has nothing to do with the issue of whether CUY was jointly and severally liable. That was the subject of the Award. 204 The existence of an inconsistency is a necessary precursor to the claimants’ case on natural justice. It is on the basis of that inconsistency that the claimants allege that there was a breach of the fair hearing rule as they were no given the chance to address the Tribunal on the effect of cl 14.1 of the SSA. They say that the Tribunal’s decision in the Award departed from the Tribunal’s finding in [224] of the Partial Award that CUY only bore secondary liability in respect of any award made in the Arbitration and they were not informed that the Tribunal was considering making an inconsistent ruling. However, on the basis that there is no inconsistency, this argument fails. 205 The claimants also put the point in another way. They say that the Tribunal’s finding in [224] of the Partial Award caused them to believe that the Tribunal would not, in the Award, make any ruling that CUY was jointly and severally liable with CUW and/or CUX. I consider that to be unarguable. The Tribunal drew a clear distinction between joint and several liability in the first part of cl 14.1 and the two-stage enforcement in the proviso. There is nothing in the Partial Award which could possibly give the impression that the Tribunal would not make a finding of joint and several liability. 206 Indeed, as recorded at [212] of the Partial Award, the claimants accepted the principle of joint and several liability in its response to the respondent’s submissions when they submitted: First, the [respondent] has not explained why their claims against [CUW] and [CUX] cannot proceed independent of their claims against [CUY]. Since the liability of the [claimants] is joint and several, the [respondent] can severally proceed against [CUW] and [CUX] before proceeding against [CUY]. In addition, as submitted by the respondent, it is difficult to see what liability [CUY] would have if not joint and several liability and no argument was made prior to the Award or, indeed, now that the liability should be other than joint and several. 207 On that basis, I reject the claimants’ application to set aside the Award on the basis of the Inconsistency Ground.",
