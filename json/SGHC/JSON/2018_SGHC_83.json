        "Introduction": "1 The present suit involves the supply of fuel oil pursuant to a contractual agreement between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant. The nature of this contractual arrangement is at the centre of the dispute. It was not disputed that the 1st defendant collected fuel oil from the plaintiff’s suppliers and delivered it to third party end-purchasers, pursuant to contracts for the sale of fuel oil entered into between the plaintiff and the end-purchasers. However, the question is whether the relationship between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant was one of sale and re-purchase, or one where the 1st defendant merely performed the delivery but at no time purchased the fuel oil? A written contract between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant suggested the former; but the plaintiff argued that an oral contract supporting the latter superseded that written contract. The plaintiff also claimed that the 2nd to 4th defendants were guarantors of the debt that the 1st defendant owed.",
        "Background": "",
        "Parties": "2 The plaintiff, Gulf Petrochem Pte Ltd (“Gulf”), is a Singapore-incorporated company in the business of trading petroleum products.1Foot Note 1×Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) (“SOC”) at para 1. 3 Mr Chew Sung Kwang (“Gary Chew”) was Gulf’s Senior Bunker Trader and its only employee in the bunker trading department in Singapore during his term of employment between 1 November 2011 and 31 August 2014. Among other things, Gary Chew’s job profile involved “[m]arketing and [b]ack to back bunker sales in Singapore … [t]rading cargoes, [and d]eveloping ex-wharf sales in Singapore”.2Foot Note 2×Gary Chew’s AEIC at p 26.Gary Chew’s duties and authority did not materially change during his term of employment.3Foot Note 3×Gary Chew’s AEIC at para 11. 4 Gary Chew reported to Mr Kalrav Dixit (“Dixit”),4Foot Note 4×Gary Chew’s AEIC at paras 19, 60; NE Day 1, p 15, lines 31–32.who was the head of bunker trading at Gulf’s parent company. 5 Dixit in turn reported to Mr Prerit Goel (“Goel”), who had been a director of Gulf since 3 June 2010 and was based in Gulf’s parent company in the United Arab Emirates. At all material times, Goel was in charge of Gulf’s overall management and business affairs.5Foot Note 5×Goel’s AEIC at para 9. 6 The 1st defendant, Petrotec Pte Ltd (“Petrotec”), was a Singapore-incorporated company engaged in the business of dealing in marine petroleum products and providing fuel oil delivery services.6Foot Note 6×SOC at para 2.It was originally set up by the 2nd defendant, Mr Tan Keng Huat, Dennis (“Dennis Tan”), in 2007 to provide offshore engineering services, and it started to deal in fuel oil sometime in 2011.7Foot Note 7×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 12. 7 At all material times, Dennis Tan was the sole director and sole shareholder of Petrotec, as well as a director and a shareholder of Oasis Asia Maritime Pte Ltd (“Oasis”), another Singapore-incorporated company.8Foot Note 8×Goel’s AEIC at para 6. 8 The 3rd defendant, Mr Tan Shuping (“Aroy Tan”), was a shareholder of Oasis until around 3 May 2013,9Foot Note 9×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 18, p 69.and a director of Oasis until 13 March 2014.10Foot Note 10×Goel’s AEIC at para 7. 9 The 4th defendant, Mr Soon Kok Khoon (“Steven Soon”), was the secretary and a director of Oasis until around May 2013. He was also a shareholder of Oasis until around the same date.11Foot Note 11×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at paras 18–19, p 69. 10 Oasis was incorporated by Dennis Tan, Aroy Tan, and Steven Soon in Singapore on 3 June 2011 to deal in fuel oil and to serve as a physical supplier of fuel oil to vessels calling within Singapore port limits.12Foot Note 12×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 14.The intention was for Oasis to apply for a Bunker Supplier Licence and a Bunker Barge Operator Licence issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (“MPA”). Apparently, only licensees could carry out the sale and supply of fuel oil to vessels within Singapore port limits.13Foot Note 13×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 14.However, around May 2013, because Oasis had still not been awarded the two licences by MPA, Steven Soon and Aroy Tan both sold their shares in Oasis to Dennis Tan.14Foot Note 14×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at paras 18–19, p 69.Steven Soon resigned as director on 3 May 2013,15Foot Note 15×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 18, p 70.and Aroy Tan did the same on 13 March 2014.16Foot Note 16×SOC at para 4. 11 For ease of reference, the 1st to 4th defendants will be collectively referred to as “the Defendants”. Further, for present purposes, the terms “bunker” and “fuel oil” are used interchangeably to refer to the cargo that was sold and/or delivered.17Foot Note 17×See Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 7; NE Day 4, p 44, lines 19–20.",
        "Genesis of the relationship": "12 The business relationship between Gulf and Petrotec was largely built upon the personal relationship between Gary Chew and Dennis Tan. As mentioned, Oasis was set up in June 2011. At around the same time, Petrotec started to deal in fuel oil. Sometime in 2011, Dennis Tan got in touch with Gary Chew to explore the possibility of Gulf doing business with Petrotec and Oasis.18Foot Note 18×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at paras 21–22.",
        "Two contractual arrangements": "13 Eventually, Gulf and Petrotec entered into a contractual arrangement relating to the supply of fuel oil. The parties agreed that the arrangement lasted for slightly more than two years from August 2012 to around November 2014.19Foot Note 19×Defendants’ Closing Submissions at para 15.However, they disagreed as to the nature of the contractual arrangement. Petrotec claimed that the business arrangement between it and Gulf involved a sale and re-purchase as constituted or evidenced by a written contract between the parties. This written contract was titled “Payment Net-Off Contract (Barging Agreement)” (“Net-Off Contract”). 14 Gulf did not dispute the existence of the Net-Off Contract or the fact that the parties had initially entered into that contract, but Gulf denied that it had ever been performed.20Foot Note 20×Goel’s AEIC at para 21.Gulf claimed that the Net-Off Contract had been superseded and dealings between the parties were instead based on an oral agreement providing for Petrotec to receive, transport, and deliver Gulf’s fuel oil (without any attendant sale or re-purchase between Gulf and Petrotec). This oral arrangement was referred to at trial as the “New Business Model”. 15 I now set out the details of the two contractual arrangements at issue. Net-Off Contract 16 It was undisputed that on 22 August 2012, Gulf and Petrotec entered into the Net-Off Contract which came into force on the same day for the period of one year. Gary Chew and Dennis Tan signed the Net-Off Contract on behalf of Gulf and Petrotec respectively.21Foot Note 21×Gary Chew’s AEIC at para 13. 17 The terms of the Net-Off Contract provided for the sale, re-purchase, and delivery of bunker fuel oil. There were two main components. First, under cl 2(ii) of the Net-Off Contract, Gulf would sell fuel oil to Petrotec on an ex-wharf basis (under a “Sale Contract”). The term “ex-wharf basis” in this context meant that Petrotec would directly collect the fuel oil from Gulf’s suppliers (“the Suppliers”). Second, under cl 2(i) of the Net-Off Contract, Gulf would re-purchase fuel oil from Petrotec on a delivered basis (under a “Purchase Contract”). “Delivered basis” meant that it was Petrotec (and not Gulf) that would deliver the fuel oil to downstream buyers (“the Buyers”). Accordingly, transactions under the Net-Off Contract involved the sale and re-purchase of fuel oil between Gulf and Petrotec.22Foot Note 22×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 4) (“Defence”) at para 15. 18 The Net-Off Contract also provided for a payment mechanism. Pursuant to cl 3.1 of the Net-Off Contract, a running account was maintained between Gulf and Petrotec based on the quantities and prices under the Purchase Contracts and Sale Contracts. At the end of each calendar month, the consolidated payment obligations accrued under the Sale Contracts for that month would be “net off” against the consolidated payment obligations accrued under the Purchase Contracts for the same month. Under cl 3.2 of the Net-Off Contract, depending on which consolidated sum was greater, either Gulf or Petrotec would be entitled to invoice the other party for the difference. 19 The Net-Off Contract itself did not provide all the terms of the business arrangement. Petrotec gave affidavit and oral evidence as to how business arrangements between the parties had in fact been conducted pursuant to the Net-Off Contract. According to Dennis Tan, the business arrangements proceeded as follows: (a) Petrotec sourced for potential purchasers of fuel oil on a delivered basis. On request of Petrotec, the Buyers would send their orders to Gulf for confirmation. Thereafter, any contract for the purchase of fuel oil would be entered into directly between the Buyers and Gulf. Apparently, this process was called “sleeving”, where orders from Petrotec’s customers were “sleeved” to Gulf.23Foot Note 23×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 42.1. (b) Gulf collated the Buyers’ orders until a threshold quantity was reached. Thereafter, Gulf would email Petrotec for confirmation that Petrotec would deliver the orders using fuel oil which Gulf would provide. (c) If Petrotec agreed to make the deliveries, Gulf would purchase the corresponding quantity of fuel oil from the Suppliers on an ex-wharf basis. Gulf would then issue a “Barge Confirmation” to Petrotec containing instructions to collect the fuel oil from the Suppliers. In response, Petrotec would email Gulf a “Barge Loading Nomination” nominating a barge for the collection. (d) Barges nominated by Petrotec would then collect the fuel oil from the Suppliers at the terminals. Simultaneously, Gulf (which had purchased the said fuel oil from the Suppliers) would onsell the fuel oil to Petrotec pursuant to a Sale Contract. The sale price under the Sale Contract was the purchase price of the fuel oil between Gulf and the Suppliers with an additional uplift (“the Uplift Charges”). The Uplift Charges were supposed to represent Gulf’s profit in the business arrangement. (e) Subsequently, Gulf would respond to the Buyers’ orders and enter into contracts for the purchase of fuel oil directly with the Buyers. Invoices would be raised by Gulf to the Buyers for the fuel oil sold.24Foot Note 24×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 42.13.Apparently, Petrotec did not have copies of these invoices.25Foot Note 25×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 42.13.Gulf would then (i) forward to Petrotec the firm orders for the purchase of fuel oil that the Buyers had sent (“Firm Orders”);26Foot Note 26×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 42.11.and (ii) issue Barge Confirmations to Petrotec for the latter to carry out the deliveries. (Some of the Firm Orders annexed in Dennis Tan’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) appear to have been addressed to Tankoil Marine Services Pte Ltd (“Tankoil”) instead of Gulf or Petrotec,27Foot Note 27×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at Exhibit DT-13.but since neither party raised any issue or made submissions on it, I place no weight on this). (f) According to Petrotec, these forwarded Firm Orders constituted offers by Gulf to purchase the stated quantity of fuel oil from Petrotec on a delivered basis. If Petrotec agreed to the sale of fuel oil to Gulf, two things would happen. First, Gulf would purchase from Petrotec the stated quantity of fuel oil on a delivered basis pursuant to a Purchase Contract. The purchase price would be the price at which Gulf had purchased the fuel oil from the Suppliers (“the Base Price”).28Foot Note 28×Defence at para 14(11).Second, Petrotec would carry out physical deliveries of fuel oil to the Buyers in accordance with details set out in the Firm Orders. Petrotec claimed that it did not usually object to sale of fuel oil to Gulf pursuant to the Firm Orders, since the Buyers were usually customers sourced by Petrotec itself for Gulf.29Foot Note 29×Defence at para 14(9); Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 42.12. 20 As mentioned (at [18] above), there was a “net off” process envisaged under the Net-Off Contract. Pursuant to the arrangement, Gulf would send Petrotec a monthly debit note setting out the monthly consolidated accounts and appending a spreadsheet demonstrating the numbers and calculations that constituted the “net off” process.30Foot Note 30×See Gary Chew’s AEIC at pp 37–45.The process used a “system minus”, which referred to the difference between the price of the Firm Order (ie, the price that Gulf receives from the Buyers for the fuel oil) and the Base Price (ie, Gulf’s purchase price for the fuel oil from the Suppliers, which does not include the Uplift Charges). This “system minus” was reflected in a special column of the spreadsheet attached to Gulf’s monthly debit notes to Petrotec. Multiplying the “system minus” by the quantity of fuel oil sold under the Firm Order, a “system minus value” would be derived. Conceptually, this “system minus value” appears to refer to the quantum of profit or loss that Gulf would have made if Gulf had purchased the relevant quantity of fuel oil at the Base Price from the Suppliers, and sold the same to the Buyers at the price of the Firm Order,without the involvement of Petrotec. The net amount of “system minus value” across the entire month’s consolidation of Firm Orders would give Gulf’s total monthly profit or loss from the resale of fuel oil (“the Purchase Margin”). If there was a profit (which would be achieved when, given a particular quantity of fuel oil ordered under a Firm Order, the price of the Firm Order exceeded the Base Price), credit would be given by Gulf to Petrotec; if there was a loss (when the price of the Firm Order was lower than that of the Base Price), Petrotec would bear the loss.31Foot Note 31×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 42.15. 21 There were also various types of charges which Petrotec agreed that it had to pay Gulf under this contractual arrangement, even though the terms of the Net-Off Contract did not expressly mention them: (a) First, Petrotec agreed that it had to pay Gulf the Uplift Charges of US$3.00 per metric tonne (“MT”) of fuel oil. However, there was a dispute regarding some of the Uplift Charges imposed at the commencement of the parties’ contractual arrangement, as those charges were imposed and paid at rates of more than US$3.00 per MT. I will elaborate on this later. (b) Second, any charges imposed by the Suppliers against Gulf for mooring and pilotage during the bunker loading operations would be charged by Gulf to Petrotec on a back to back basis.32Foot Note 32×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 42.10.Similarly, any claim made by the Buyers against Gulf for demurrage and/or delays would also be charged by Gulf to Petrotec on a back to back basis.33Foot Note 33×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 42.17.These charges are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Back to Back Charges”. 22 In addition, Gulf also imposed other charges which Petrotec disputes even though it paid them in the past. Indeed, some of the paid charges are the subject of Petrotec’s counterclaim. I will elaborate on these later. New Business Model 23 According to Gulf, after the Net-Off Contract was entered into but before it was performed, Gulf and Petrotec orally entered into the New Business Model. This New Business Model was a separate contract which governed the parties’ relationshipvis-à-visthe supply of fuel oil. The Net-Off Contract was never performed and thus “fell away”.34Foot Note 34×SOC at para 13A. 24 Gulf explained that the New Business Model was orally requested by Gulf, and orally agreed to by Petrotec.35Foot Note 35×SOC at para 11(c).This new arrangement was necessary because the Net-Off Contract provided a credit period of up to 30 days for Petrotec to make payment for its purchases of fuel oil from Gulf. At the time it entered into the Net-Off Contract, Gulf had intended to obtain credit insurance to protect itself from,inter alia, any potential default by Petrotec. However, after the contract was signed, Gulf was unable to obtain the credit insurance. Thus, Gulf “was not prepared” to proceed with the Net-Off Contract and orally requested for the New Business Model, which Petrotec allegedly agreed to.36Foot Note 36×SOC at para 11. 25 According to Gulf, the flow of business under the New Business Model was as follows:37Foot Note 37×SOC at para 13. (a) Petrotec arranged and negotiated the sale of fuel oil with the Buyers on behalf of Gulf. (b) Once the sale price and quantity were agreed upon, the Buyers would send “Confirmations of Nomination” directly to Gulf. Gulf would in turn send “Sales Confirmations”, which included the terms and conditions of sale, to the Buyers. (c) Gulf then purchased the fuel oil from the Suppliers on an ex-wharf basis, and appointed Petrotec to receive, hold, and transport the fuel oil to the Buyers by way of a “Barge Confirmation Purchase Side”. (d) Once Gulf’s fuel oil was loaded onto Petrotec’s nominated barge, the Suppliers would invoice Gulf for Gulf’s purchase of the fuel oil. Gulf would then send to Petrotec a “Barge Confirmation Sales Side” in respect of Gulf’s sale of fuel oil to the relevant Buyer. (e) Pursuant to the Barge Confirmation Sales Side, Petrotec would transport and deliver fuel oil to the Buyers. This delivery was evidenced by bunker debit notes. Gulf would then invoice the Buyers directly for Gulf’s sale of fuel oil to them. 26 In essence, under the New Business Model, Gulf remained the owner of the relevant fuel oilvis-à-visPetrotec and at no time sold fuel oil to, or purchased fuel oil from, Petrotec.38Foot Note 38×SOC at paras 13(h), 14.Petrotec was appointed only to receive, hold, transport, and deliver Gulf’s fuel oil on Gulf’s behalf. Petrotec would not be involved in the receipt or payment of any invoices between Gulf and the Suppliers,39Foot Note 39×SOC at para 13(ha).or between Gulf and the Buyers.40Foot Note 40×SOC at para 13(k). 27 The risk-profit apportionment between Gulf and Petrotec mentioned above in relation to the Net-Off Contract (see [20] above), however, appeared to remain largely similar under the New Business Model. This was because even under the New Business Model, debit notes would be sent by Gulf to Petrotec on a monthly basis at the start of each calendar month, indicating the net sum due from Petrotec to Gulf in the preceding month. One aspect of these debit notes was the “system minus” as described above in relation to the Net-Off Contract (see [20] above). However, under the New Business Model, this “system minus” was said to represent a purely financial arrangement rather than a sale and re-purchase arrangement.41Foot Note 41×SOC at para 20.Using the price of the Firm Order and the Base Price,42Foot Note 42×SOC at paras 15B, 16.Gulf would calculate the net profit or loss from the sale of fuel oil by Gulf to the Buyers (without intermediate sales and re-purchases from Petrotec). If the price of the Firm Order exceeded the sum of the Base Price and other relevant charges, Gulf would credit the surplus to Petrotec; if the converse, Petrotec would pay Gulf the deficit.43Foot Note 43×SOC at para 15A.",
        "Contractual performance and debit notes": "28 As mentioned, the business relationship between Gulf and Petrotec lasted for slightly more than two years from August 2012 to November 2014.44Foot Note 44×Defendants’ Closing Submissions at para 15.The parties agreed that the first time a barge nominated by Petrotec was loaded with fuel oil purchased by Gulf from the Suppliers was on 24 August 2012. 29 During the term of their business relationship, Gulf sent at least three types of debit notes to Petrotec, two of which were implicated in the present proceedings. 30 The first type of debit notes recorded the net monthly payments that should be made by Petrotec to Gulf (“the Barge Settlement DNs”). At the start of each month (save for August 2012 to December 2012 where Gulf issued one consolidated debit note in January 2013 for these months), Gulf issued a debit note to Petrotec indicating the net sum due from Petrotec to Gulf in the preceding month which comprised the following four components:45Foot Note 45×SOC at para 20. (a) the Purchase Margin, which represented the net profit or loss from the sale of the fuel oil to the Buyers;46Foot Note 46×SOC at para 15A. (b) the Uplift Charges, being US$3.00 per MT of fuel oil (the permissible rate is disputed) purchased from Gulf’s Suppliers – Gulf charged this to Petrotec as Gulf’s “operational costs of doing this business”;47Foot Note 47×SOC at para 19(a). (c) interests at the rate of 6% per annum that Gulf charged Petrotec on the Base Price from the date Gulf paid the Suppliers for the fuel oil to the date Gulf received payment for the same from the Buyers (“the Finance Charges”);48Foot Note 48×SOC at para 19(b); Gary Chew’s AEIC at para 29(c).and (d) late payment interests that Gulf charged Petrotec at a rate of 2% per month from the first day of the month in which Gulf issued the debit note to the date payment was made by Petrotec (“the Late Payment Interests”).49Foot Note 49×SOC at para 19(c). 31 The second type of debit notes was issued by Gulf to Petrotec for the Back to Back Charges (see [21(b)] above).50Foot Note 50×SOC at para 23; see Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 42.17. 32 A third type of debit notes was for the “Cancellation Charges”, which refer to the difference between the price of the Firm Orders and the purchase price that the Buyers eventually had to pay (which was usually higher) for fuel oil from an alternative source if their purchase from Gulf was cancelled. Apparently, the Buyers would bill the Cancellation Charges to Gulf, which would in turn raise a debit note to Petrotec on a back to back basis.51Foot Note 51×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 46.",
        "Guarantee": "33 According to Dennis Tan, he received a phone call from Gary Chew in 2012. Gary Chew told Dennis Tan that Gulf wanted Dennis Tan and his two partners in Oasis, Aroy Tan and Steven Soon, to sign a document in order to kick-start the business with Gulf.52Foot Note 52×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 24.Gary Chew also allegedly told Dennis Tan that he did not have to worry about anything, and that Gary Chew would take care of them like how he took care of another bunker supplier who had engaged in a similar business with Gulf.53Foot Note 53×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 24. 34 After receiving Gary Chew’s call, Dennis Tan called Steven Soon to come down to the office. That evening, Gary Chew arrived at Dennis Tan’s office and obtained Steven Soon’s and Dennis Tan’s signatures on the document.54Foot Note 54×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at paras 24–26.Dennis Tan then dispatched the document to Aroy Tan, who signed it and returned the document to Gulf.55Foot Note 55×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 26. 35 That document turned out to be a personal guarantee (“the Guarantee”), the validity and enforceability of which is in dispute. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th defendants are referred to collectively as “the Guarantors”.56Foot Note 56×SOC at para 49; Dennis Tan’s AEIC at p 61.I will elaborate on the Guarantee and its terms later.",
        "End of the relationship": "36 On or around 5 November 2014, Gulf suspected that Petrotec was facing financial difficulties and stopped doing business with it.57Foot Note 57×SOC at para 30.Apparently, the industry was in turmoil during that period as allegations of fraud were raised against certain major marine fuel companies such as OW Bunker and its subsidiary, Dynamic Oil Trading Pte Ltd (“DOT”). DOT had business relations with Tankoil, a company which had some connection with Petrotec and Dennis Tan. Investigations and claims against DOT and Tankoil led to disruptions in Petrotec’s performance of its delivery and payment obligations with Gulf.58Foot Note 58×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at paras 101–127. 37 As at the time Gulf stopped doing business with Petrotec, there were seven outstanding debit notes with the outstanding sum under them being US$3,937,105.33.59Foot Note 59×SOC at para 31(b).Petrotec had made part payment of US$580,205.25 for one of the outstanding debit notes as of 8 November 2014.60Foot Note 60×SOC at para 31(a). 38 On or around 8 November 2014, Dennis Tan sent a text message to Goel requesting for financial assistance to pay the debt. Goel suggested a meeting to discuss the proposal, but Dennis Tan did not reply.61Foot Note 61×SOC at para 32. 39 On 10 November 2014, Gulf’s lawyers wrote a letter of demand to Petrotec requesting immediate payment of US$4,268,852.05 which was then due and owing, and delivery of 15,794.86 MT of fuel oil which allegedly belonged to Gulf.62Foot Note 62×SOC at para 34; 4DBD at pp 422–423.On the same day, Gulf’s lawyers also wrote to each of the Guarantors to demand payment of US$4,268,852.05, and delivery of the “inventory quantity” of 15,794.86 MT of fuel oil valued at US$8,408,463.31.63Foot Note 63×4DBD at pp 420–421. 40 According to Gulf, the amount of US$4,268,852.05 stated in the letters of demand included (a) the outstanding debt owed by Petrotec as at the date of the letters, and (b) the debt under a Barge Settlement DN for November 2014 which had not yet been issued by Gulf at the time of the letters.64Foot Note 64×SOC at para 34.That Barge Settlement DN was subsequently issued on 1 December 2014 for a sum of US$303,684.86.65Foot Note 65×SOC at para 39(b); Goel’s AEIC at p 253.The amount stated in the letters of demand may not have been accurate as it appears to have mistakenly estimated the amount that would have been stated in this Barge Settlement DN as US$331,746.72.66Foot Note 66×4DBD at pp 420–423.However, nothing in the present case turned on this discrepancy. In any event, neither Petrotec nor the Guarantors complied with the letters of demand.67Foot Note 67×SOC at paras 54–57; 4DBD at pp 420–423. 41 On 11 November and 1 December 2014, Gulf issued a debit note for the Back to Back Charges and the above-mentioned Barge Settlement DN for November 2014 (see [40] above) respectively. There were therefore a total of nine outstanding debit notes, for a total face value of US$4,833,589.19. Given the part payment of US$580,205.25 made as of 8 November 2014 (see [37] above), the outstanding sum purportedly owed by Petrotec to Gulf was US$4,253,383.94.",
        "Claims and counterclaims": "42 The present suit was commenced on 18 November 2014. Gulf’s claim comprised three main parts:68Foot Note 68×SOC at p 32. (a) claim against Petrotec for delivery up of 15,309.248 MT of fuel oil (“the Surplus Oil”) which Petrotec had allegedly received and held on behalf of Gulf, or alternatively payment of US$8,123,896.43 being the approximate value and/or price of the Surplus Oil, or further and/or alternatively damages for conversion or detinue in respect of the Surplus Oil; (b) claim against Petrotec for the outstanding sum of US$4,253,383.94 due under debit notes issued between August and December 2014; and (c) claim against the Guarantors under the Guarantee for similar reliefs as were sought against Petrotec. 43 Petrotec counterclaimed the return of the following sums which were allegedly paid by mistake and/or led to the unjust enrichment of Gulf:69Foot Note 69×Defence at para 67A. (a) US$15,963.42 being the excess Uplift Charges levied by Gulf on Petrotec above the rate of US$3.00 per MT of fuel oil;70Foot Note 70×Defence at para 65. (b) US$2,734,809.13 “being part of” the Finance Charges paid by Petrotec to Gulf from December 2012 to June 2014;71Foot Note 71×Defence at paras 32, 66.and (c) US$1,102,560.49 being the Late Payment Interests paid by Petrotec to Gulf from February 2013 to June 2014.72Foot Note 72×Defence at paras 32, 67. For present purposes, there is no material distinction between each kind of payment and I collectively address them as “the Payments”. 44 There was also an alternative counterclaim for damages to be assessed in respect of the Payments. 45 Petrotec also sought a declaration that the Guarantee was void and/or unenforceable against the Guarantors.",
        "Issues": "46 Based on the parties’ positions, the following issues arise for determination:73Foot Note 73×Plaintiff’s and Defendants’ Lead Counsel Statements both dated 4 May 2017.

        "Whether the Net-Off Contract or the New Business Model applied": "47 The first issue is whether the Net-Off Contract or the New Business Model was applicable in relation to the parties’ contractual arrangement between August 2012 and November 2014.74Foot Note 74×Defendants’ Closing Submissions at para 15.",
        "Gulf’s arguments": "158 Gulf sought to enforce the Guarantee against the Guarantors for the following two sums: (a) US$4,253,383.94 being the balance sum under the nine outstanding debit notes;224Foot Note 224×SOC at para 50.and (b) US$8,123,896.43 being the approximate value of the Surplus Oil which Petrotec purportedly holds on behalf of Gulf.225Foot Note 225×SOC at para 53. 159 In response to arguments by the Guarantors, Gulf’s position was that: (a) The terms of the Guarantee were sufficiently certain.226Foot Note 226×Reply at para 43. (b) Under the Guarantee, the Guarantors were liable to Gulf for the Finance Charges and/or the Late Payment Interests.227Foot Note 227×Reply at para 43. (c) The Guarantee did not distinguish between the liabilities of Dennis Tan on the one hand, and of Aroy Tan and Steven Soon on the other. Nor was the liability of Aroy Tan and Steven Soon restricted to principal debts owed by Oasis.228Foot Note 228×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 134. (d) Properly construed, the Guarantee was an indemnity and therefore Aroy Tan and Steven Soon were bound even if they neither knew nor consented to the New Business Model.229Foot Note 229×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 139.Even if the Guarantee was characterised as a guarantee, its terms clearly covered the New Business Model.230Foot Note 230×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 140. (e) Neither Gulf nor its representatives represented that the Guarantee would not be binding, or that Gulf had no intention of enforcing the terms,231Foot Note 231×Reply at para 46A.and even if any of Gulf’s representatives had made such a representation, that representative did not have the authority to do so.232Foot Note 232×Reply at para 46B. 160 Gulf added that even if the Net-Off Contract applied, the Guarantors remained liable under the Guarantee.233Foot Note 233×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 142.",
        "Petrotec’s arguments": "147 I turn now to Petrotec’s counterclaim for the Payments. To recapitulate (see [43] above), Petrotec counterclaimed US$3,853,333.04 against Gulf which comprised the following sums which were allegedly paid by mistake and/or led to the unjust enrichment of Gulf:207Foot Note 207×SDB at p 63; Defence at para 67A; Defendants’ Closing Submissions at para 58. (a) US$15,963.42 being the excess Uplift Charges levied by Gulf on Petrotec above the agreed rate of US$3.00 per MT of fuel oil;208Foot Note 208×Defence at para 65; Annex. (b) US$2,734,809.13 “being part of” the Finance Charges paid by Petrotec to Gulf from December 2012 to June 2014;209Foot Note 209×Defence at paras 32, 66.and (c) US$1,102,560.49 being the Late Payment Interests paid by Petrotec to Gulf from February 2013 to June 2014.210Foot Note 210×Defence at paras 32, 67.",
        "Analysis": "164 I am of the view that the Guarantors’ arguments to resist enforcement of the Guarantee are not made out. Certainty 165 The Guarantors’ argument was that the Guarantee was not sufficiently clear to be enforceable. This was because there was no clear identification of the subject matter or the principal contract “pursuant to which the [Guarantee] was issued”. Further, the scope of the Guarantors’ liability was uncertain and/or unascertainable.243Foot Note 243×Defendants’ Closing Submissions at para 71.1. 166 In my view, there is sufficient certainty for the Guarantee to be given effect to in the present case. While it could have been more elegantly drafted, the Guarantee provided for the Guarantors’ liability in respect of principal debts owed by Petrotec to Gulf for the purchase of fuel oil whether under the Net-Off Contract or not. This was contemplated in the second paragraph of the Guarantee which read: “We also personally guarantee Gulf… for any sale of ex-wharf oil to us into our above-named barges.” The phrase “any sale… to us” is important. The word “us” in the context of the Guarantee must have included Petrotec since the first paragraph clarified that Petrotec was one of “our companies” – “our” referring here collectively to the Guarantors. The plain meaning of the phrase “any sale” is sufficiently certain. The reference to “any sale” wouldnotmake sense if the guaranteed obligation referred merely to, for example, a minimum threshold of transactions with the Buyers that Petrotec must “sleeve” to Gulf, since that would render the word “any” otiose. It could also not be that the guaranteed obligation referred merely to the condition of the fuel oil transported by Petrotec to the Buyers, because the key word used in the second paragraph was “sale”, and in any case, liability as to theft, robbery and spillage had already been provided for in the third paragraph of the Guarantee. 167 Indeed, apart from a bare assertion of uncertainty, the Guarantors did not in fact provide any alternative reading of the Guarantee that could plausibly fit within its terms. The fact that the Guarantee did not refer to the Net-Off Contract by name, or that it did not use the most precise terms to describe the ownership of the various barges, was not fatal. As stated inThe Law of Contract in Singapore(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“Phang on Contract”) at pp 145–146, “the courts do not expect commercial documents to be drafted with the outmost precision and certainty” and would generally endeavour to give effect to an agreement rather than strike it down. Further, as Gulf noted, there was no distinction drawn in the Guarantee between Dennis Tan and the other Guarantors, or between Petrotec and Oasis. Therefore, the Guarantors bear the collective liability of Petrotec and Oasis to Gulf. 168 Finally, there was no good reason why the Guarantors did not realise that what they were signing was a guarantee when the document so clearly used the term “personally guarantee” and it was not a lengthy document.244Foot Note 244×See Steven Soon’s AEIC at para 14. 169 I am therefore of the view that the Guarantee is not so uncertain as to be unenforceable. Consideration 170 The Guarantors submitted without elaboration that the Guarantee is unenforceable for failure of consideration.245Foot Note 245×Defendants’ Closing Submissions at para 71.2.They also asserted that there was “no consideration to the [Guarantors] for providing the [Guarantee]”.246Foot Note 246×Defendants’ Closing Submissions at para 71.2. 171 In my view, the consideration provided by Gulf for the Guarantee was its entry into the Net-Off Contract with Petrotec. It is true that Aroy Tan and Steven Soon were not employees or directors of Petrotec, and therefore they were not direct beneficiaries of the consideration.247Foot Note 247×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 131.However, it is trite that the consideration provided by Gulf need not be directed at the Guarantors themselves, but may also be provided to Petrotec as one of the principals under the Guarantee. As Low Kee Yang,The Law of Guarantees inSingapore & Malaysia(LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) (“Low on Guarantees”) stated (at pp 69–70): A contract of guarantee must be supported by valuable consideration such as making advances or supplying goods. The essential rule is that consideration must move from the promisee (or his agent) but it need not (though it may) move to the promisor. The promise that we are concerned with here is the surety’s promise – to pay the creditor (the promisee) if the principal debtor does not. To enforce the surety’s promise, the creditor must show that he has given valuable consideration,either to the principal debtor or to the surety. [emphasis added; internal citations omitted] 172 For completeness, I add that such consideration was not past consideration. While the Guarantee was undated, and even though Gulf’s pleaded case was that the Net-Off Contract chronologically preceded the Guarantee (see [156] above), Gary Chew’s unchallenged evidence in court was that the Guarantee had been signed “before the business started” because otherwise Gulf’s “management [would] not approve” the business arrangement with Petrotec.248Foot Note 248×NE Day 3, p 86.It was also Goel’s evidence that the Guarantee was the prerequisite to a business relationship between the parties.249Foot Note 249×NE Day 2, p 48.The better view of the facts is therefore that the Net-Off Contract and the Guarantee were part of one and the same transaction, and should hence be considered to have been entered into contemporaneously (seeLow on Guaranteesat p 76;Phang onContractat pp 193–195). 173 In the premises, I am of the view that the Guarantee is adequately supported by consideration provided by Gulf. Estoppel 174 The Guarantors further argued that Gulf was estopped from calling on the Guarantee due to the oral representations made by Gary Chew to Dennis Tan which the Guarantors relied on. In particular, they relied on the following alleged representations made by Gary Chew:250Foot Note 250×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 28. (a) that the Guarantee was a mere formality to kick-start business with Gulf; (b) that Gary Chew would “take care of” Dennis Tan;251Foot Note 251×NE Day 4, p 31, lines 1–6.and (c) that Dennis Tan “did not have to worry” about the Guarantee.252Foot Note 252×NE Day 4, p 31, lines 9–11. 175 The Guarantors did not specify the species of estoppel relied upon.253Foot Note 253×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 144.As Andrew Ang J explained inRudhra MineralsPte Ltd v MRI Trading Pte Ltd[2013] 4 SLR 1023, the appropriate species of estoppel that applies to preclude one party from resiling on his alleged promise or assurance as to future conduct should be promissory estoppel, and not estoppel by representation of fact. It is on this basis that I analyse the Guarantors’ submissions. 176 A party pleading promissory estoppel must show three elements: (a) a clear and unequivocal promise by the promisor, whether by words or conduct, (b) reliance on the promise by the promisee, and (c) detriment suffered by the promisee as a result of the reliance (see,eg,Aero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine Engineering Pte Ltd[2013] 4 SLR 409 at [37]). 177 On the facts, the purported representations do not amount to unequivocal promises that the Guarantee would not be enforced.254Foot Note 254×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 147.Gary Chew could equally be “taking care” of the Guarantors if hedeferredreliance on the Guarantee rather thanentirelydisclaimedits use. In this sense, a representation that Gary Chew would try his best to protect Dennis Tan and the other Guarantors did not amount to an unequivocal promise that the Guarantee would not be enforced.255Foot Note 255×NE Day 4, pp 34–35.Indeed, it would not make any commercial sense for Gulf to require a personal guarantee and yet undertake not to enforce that guarantee.256Foot Note 256×See Gary Chew’s AEIC at para 58. 178 Furthermore, even though Gary Chew conceded under cross-examination that he had told Dennis Tan that he would take care of him,257Foot Note 257×NE Day 4, pp 30–31.there is no evidence that he had made the same promises to Aroy Tan and Steven Soon. There is also no evidence that Dennis Tan informed the other Guarantors of the promise made by Gary Chew. Further, no submission was made as to whether such indirectly-conveyed promises would suffice to ground a claim in promissory estoppel. In the circumstances, even if Dennis Tan was entitled to raise an estoppel (which he was not), the same cannot be said of the other Guarantors. Guarantee over the New Business Model 179 Finally, the Guarantors argued that Aroy Tan and Steven Soon should be discharged from all liability under the Guarantee to Gulf as the New Business Model was entered into without their consent.258Foot Note 258×Defence at para 59.Since I have found that the New Business Model did not exist, this submission of the Guarantors must fail. 180 The Guarantors’ argument that the terms of the Guarantee did not apply to the Finance Charges and/or the Late Payment Interests259Foot Note 259×Defence at paras 57(c), 60B.also did not arise because of my finding that the New Business Model did not exist and the absence of any pleading that these charges were payable on any other basis. Conclusion 181 For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that the Guarantee is enforceable and that the Guarantors are liable to Gulf for debts owed by Petrotec to Gulf in respect of Petrotec’s purchase of fuel oil from Gulf under the Net-Off Contract. 182 I add that in its closing submissions, Gulf asserted that the Guarantee was in fact an indemnity.260Foot Note 260×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 119.This was not pleaded, and in any event I do not consider the argument sustainable as the Guarantee clearly stated that it involved a “personal[] guarantee” and nothing else suggests otherwise.",
        "Claim for the Surplus Oil": "129 Having established that the Net-Off Contract was the applicable contractual arrangement, I turn now to examine the merits of Gulf’s claims. 130 The main dispute appeared to be Gulf’s claim for ownership of the Surplus Oil loaded on four vessels, namely, “STAR QUEST”, “PETRO ASIA”, “NORTHWEST SUCCESS”, and SKY QUEST”.181Foot Note 181×Goel’s AEIC at para 71.",
        "Claim on the outstanding debit notes": "137 Gulf’s second claim was for the outstanding sum due under nine debit notes issued between August and December 2014. Of these debit notes, five were Barge Settlement DNs and four were for the Back to Back Charges.194Foot Note 194×SOC at para 39.As mentioned above (see [41] above), the face value of these debit notes totalled US$4,833,589.19 (with US$4,801,688.75 for the Barge Settlement DNs and US$31,900.44 for the debit notes for the Back to Back Charges). Given the part payment made by Petrotec of US$580,205.25 as of 8 November 2014 (see [37] above), the outstanding sum purportedly due from Petrotec to Gulf at the time of commencement of this suit was US$4,253,383.94.195Foot Note 195×SOC at para 39.",
        "Counterclaim for the Payments": "",
        "Claim on the Guarantee": "155 I turn now to the Guarantee (see [35] above). The Guarantee read as follows: I, Tan Keng Huat Dennis (I/C No. …) together with Tan ShuPing (I/C No. …) and Soon Kok Khoon (I/C No. …) hereby personally guarantee Gulf Petrochem Pte Ltd/FCZ for all oil transported by our companies PetroTec Pte Ltd and Oasis Asia Marine Pte Ltd and also for all oil loaded into our barges ‘Episode’, ‘Sophie 9’, ‘Pride’ and ‘SS Prosperity’ or any other barge name for purposes of barging, transportation, and delivered supply to ships for Gulf Petrochem Pte Ltd/FCZ. We also personally guarantee Gulf Petrochem Pte Ltd/FCZ for any sale of ex-wharf oil to us into our above-named barges. All losses due to theft, robbery, spill or any other reasons will be borne by us. 156 The Guarantee was not dated. Dennis Tan’s AEIC did not specify the date of the Guarantee, but suggested that he signed it between January and August 2012.220Foot Note 220×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 28.According to Gulf, this Guarantee was provided by the Guarantors between 22 August 2012 (when the Net-Off Contract was entered into) and 24 August 2012 (which is the date of the first transaction between the parties).221Foot Note 221×SOC at para 49. 157 Further, Dennis Tan gave evidence that one year later, in July 2013, Gary Chew informed him that some other document for the business deal was required, and that there was a personal guarantee involved.222Foot Note 222×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 29.Gary Chew also apparently said then that the Guarantee which Dennis Tan had previously signed was nothing. However, Dennis Tan refused to sign the new document as he did not want to be a personal guarantor. Gary Chew told Dennis Tan not to worry and that he would take care of things.223Foot Note 223×Dennis Tan’s AEIC at para 29.It appears that this second guarantee was not eventually pursued.",
        "The Guarantors’ arguments": "161 The Guarantors resisted liability under the Guarantee on the following grounds:234Foot Note 234×Defence at para 68. (a) In fact, no Guarantee had been provided.235Foot Note 235×Defence at para 56. (b) The terms of the Guarantee did not apply to the Finance Charges and/or the Late Payment Interests.236Foot Note 236×Defence at paras 57(c), 60B. (c) The Guarantee was unenforceable as the terms were uncertain.237Foot Note 237×Defence at para 57. (d) The Guarantee was unenforceable against Aroy Tan and Steven Soon for want of consideration, as they were at all material times not involved in and/or employed by Petrotec. Gulf neither transacted directly with Oasis, nor brought any claim against it.238Foot Note 238×Defence at para 58. (e) Even if the New Business Model applied, Aroy Tan and Steven Soon were discharged from all liability under the Guarantee as they did not know and did not consent to this agreement.239Foot Note 239×Defence at para 59. (f) Gulf was estopped from calling on the Guarantee, as Gulf’s representative, Gary Chew, had made numerous oral representations and/or promises to Dennis Tan that the Guarantee “was only a matter of formality and that [Gulf] would not enforce the [Guarantee]”.240Foot Note 240×Defence at para 60A(a).Each of the Guarantors relied on these oral representations when they signed the Guarantee.241Foot Note 241×Defence at para 60A(b). 162 In the circumstances, the Guarantors sought a declaration that the Guarantee was void and/or unenforceable. 163 Even if the Guarantee was enforceable, the Guarantors sought to set off Petrotec’s counterclaimvis-à-visGulf against Petrotec’s liability to Gulf.242Foot Note 242×Defence at para 61.",
        "Summary of decisions": "183 For the above reasons, since Gulf does not have title to the Surplus Oil, its claims for a delivery up of the Surplus Oil and/or for damages for conversion or detinue are dismissed. Instead, Petrotec is to pay Gulf US$8,123,896.43 as the purchase price of the Surplus Oil. In addition, Petrotec is to pay Gulf US$3,447,582.87 as the aggregate amount due and owing under the nine outstanding debit notes. Also, the Guarantors are jointly and severally liable to pay those two sums to Gulf. 184 Petrotec’s counterclaims for the Payments and for a declaration that the Guarantee is void and/or unenforceable are dismissed. 185 I will hear the parties on costs. 186 A final comment is due. At the end of the trial, I gave directions for the Defendants to file and serve written closing submissions by 5.00pm of 21 August 2017, and the plaintiff to do the same by 5.00pm of 11 September 2017. Submissions were filed belatedly by the Defendants on 4 September 2017. On 5 October 2017, counsel for the plaintiff wrote to court stating that even though the plaintiff’s closing submissions were (purportedly) due on 25 September 2017, “[the] parties have agreed to an extension of time of three weeks for the Plaintiff to serve its Closing Submissions”. I should clarify that while the parties may be agreeable to give each other an extension of time to make submissions, it is ultimately for the court to decide whether to abridge  its direction and to grant the extension. In the present case, I was agreeable to the extension in question but in future the parties should not assume that the court will agree. Woo Bih LiJudge Tan Boon Yong Thomas and Ng Wei Long (Haridass Ho & Partners)for the plaintiff and defendant in the counterclaim;Fu Simin Charmaine and Wong Shi Yi (Ang & Partners)for the first to fourth defendants and the plaintiffs in the counterclaim."
