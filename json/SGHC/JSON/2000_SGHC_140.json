        "Whether the plaintiffs were estopped from complaining of overloading": "27. Except for raising in their pleaded defence, the defendants did not make any\n\nserious effort to support this contention. I found no merit in it.Whether the overloading caused the damage28. The defendants appointed Philip Jones to study and report on the matter, and\n\nhe subsequently submitted his report. He observed that the floor of the warehouse was formed by\n\nconcrete slabs 6 m by 7 m which were non-suspended, which I understand to be that they were not\n\nbuilt over any support. Mr Jones noticed that while the majority of the floor had settled, the area\n\nof greatest settlement was in an area where no paper rolls were stacked.29. He made two findings-(i) that the slab thickness of 150 mm specified in the quotation for the\n\n  proposed reconstruction of the floor (and also the structural plan of the floor) was inadequate.\n\n  He referred to a work he considered to be authoritative on the subject, DeaconsConcrete\n\n  Ground Floors Their Design, Construction and Finishwhich recommended slab thicknesses of 200\n\n  mm for weak subgrade and 175 mm for normal subgrade for industrial premises and warehouses, and(ii) the differential settlement had been made worse because the north-western\n\n  corner of the site appeared to be constructed on filled ground, which is by its nature less\n\n  compact than undisturbed soil and is prone to settle at a faster rate.30. He attributed the damage to the poor design of the ground slabs and the poor\n\ncondition of the soil, was of the view that the damage had occurred before the defendants took\n\npossession of the premises.31. The plaintiffs expert Bobby Ho did not agree with him. In his report, he\n\nconcluded that the damages was the result of direct overloading in excess of 400 lb per square foot.32. Mr Ho was cross-examined at length by counsel for the defendants. Two areas\n\nof cross-examination were of particular significance, firstly whether the warehouse was constructed\n\non filled ground or a cut ground, and secondly, whether the ground slabs were laid in accordance to\n\nthe specifications in the structural plan.33. When counsel for the defendant suggested to him that part of the site was\n\nfilled ground meaning that the ground was raised by a layer of fill, he disagreed and said that it\n\nwas a cut site created by removing some of the soil on the top.34. Addressing the issue of ground strength, Mr Ho confirmed that \"(f)or a\n\nnon-suspended slab in designing the slab one must make sure that  the soil must be\n\nsufficiently firm\", and he went on to say \"If I have weak soil, I will never design a\n\nnon-suspended floor slab because the ground must settle when it is loaded. When we have weak soil\n\ncondition one always design the floor as a suspended slab\" and \"(w)hen we design for\n\nnon-suspended slabs, we dont normally design non-suspended slabs over weak soil, only on firm\n\nsoil\".35. In the course of the proceedings, the parties agreed that a soil test be\n\ncarried out to determine the soil condition. Soil & Foundation (Pte) Ltd was engaged to\n\nundertake the job. They made two bores adjacent to the warehouse, and noted in their report-Based on the borehole data and the laboratory test results, the subsoil strata\n\n  of the site are in a descending order as shown below:1) Fill composed of firm clayey silt and loose silty sand which is surfaced\n\n  with asphalt and premix base materials.2) Kallang Formation Alluvial Member (Ka) composed of soft sandy clay with\n\n  traces of gravel and peat, and loose to medium dense fine to coarse silty/clayey sand with\n\n  gravels,3) Residual Soils composed of firm to hard clayey/sandy silt,4) Bedrocks of Bukit Timah Granite Formation.Fill is about 1.0 to 1.5 m thick and is of SPT N-value of 9 at BH2 location.Soft sandy clay of Kallang Formation Alluvial Member is about 0.5 to 2.0 m\n\n  thick and is of SPT N-values ranging from 0 to 3.36. When the borelog reports were produced, Mr Ho accepted that there was fill\n\nmaterial and he added that SPT N values below 10 reflect soft ground. When asked to reconsider his\n\nevidence in the light of the test results, he conceded that \"it would appear that the warehouse\n\nwas founded on fill over its entire width\".37. The construction of the floor slabs also came under examination. The\n\nstructural plan specified that dowel bars be incorporated in the slabs. The purpose of such bars is\n\nto spread load between the slabs.38. The problem was that no dowel bars were sighted in the warehouse floor. The\n\ncontractors who undertook the partial re-casting of the floor made no mention of dowel bars, and did\n\nnot provide for them in the areas that they cast. Mr Bobby Ho visited the warehouse after a 2-2.5 m\n\nstrip of the floor along one side of the warehouse had been broken up. The dowel bars which the\n\nstructural plan specified to be placed at 600 mm intervals between the slabs would be visible if\n\nthey were there, but Mr Ho did not see any .39. I found on the evidence that the floor was constructed without dowel bars.\n\nThe omission of the bars which were on integral part of the slabs would have resulted in a weaker\n\nfloor than the designers had envisaged. That in time would increase the likelihood and extent of\n\nsettlement.Whether the plaintiffs quantification of the cost of rectification is\n\njustified40. The plaintiffs relied on the quotation they received from their contractors.\n\nThey did not invite other contractors to quote and ensure that they get the best price available.\n\nThey had not tried to bargain the quoted price down, or refer it to their engineers or consultants\n\nfor comment. In these circumstances, it is easy to understand that the quotation has not been put to\n\nthe plaintiffs board of directors for acceptance. Clearly, it was not a satisfactory basis for\n\nquantifying the cost of reconstructing the whole floor.41. There are other questions - whether it was necessary to reconstruct whole\n\nfloor, and whether it is proper to make the defendants pay for it.42. The parties agreed to appoint an expert to report in the soil condition, and\n\nappointed Dr Wong Ing Hieng for that purpose. Dr Wong, a professional engineer with substantial\n\nexperience in geotechnical and civil engineering, was furnished with the geotechnical report of Soil\n\n& Foundation Pte Ltd, on the basis of which he prepared his report.43. Dr Wong said in his report that \"(t)he upper strata of the Site are\n\nloose and the elastic modulii are correspondingly low. These soils are therefore likely to undergo\n\nimmediate settlements (sic) the magnitude of which depends on the applied load.\" He went\n\non and stated that after the initial process of immediate settlement, \"all the strata at the\n\nSite contain significant amounts of fines and are therefore likely to undergo time dependent\n\nsettlements (sic)\". Dr Wong worked out these settlement figures on the basis of an\n\napplied load of 20 kN/m2(equipment to 400 lb per square foot) and the data from the two\n\nbores, and concluded that would be immediate settlement of 7.6 mm and further settlement of 54 mm at\n\nwithin half a year.44. I do not know why the parties or the geotechnical engineers who did the tests\n\nsited the two bores outside south-east and north-west corners the warehouse rather than within it.\n\nThis left a question whether the bore tests were truly representative because beneath the warehouse\n\nmay have been compacted or prepared in other ways before the ground slabs were cast.45. However, the parties had appointed and instructed the soil investigators\n\ntogether, they had to make do with the results obtained. It was well that they agreed to proceed on\n\nthe basis that the results represented the general conditions of the soil below the warehouse near\n\nthe respective boreholes.46. Dr Wongs finding was that a part of the ground would have settled by more\n\nthan 61 mm within six months under a load of 20 kN/m2or 400 lbs per square foot. Dr Wong\n\nwas only briefed to take the maximum permissible load into account. Consequently, he did not\n\nconsider the weight of the concrete slab itself and the layer of blinding of hardcore and sand below\n\nit. It is fair to infer that a concrete slab of between 155 mm and 190 mm and a layer of blinding of\n\nbetween 55 mm and 100 mm would add to the load on the soil and result in greater settlement.47. The borehole logs show that Standard Penetration Test (SPT) readings. Mr Ho\n\nhad explained that any SPT N-value below 10 is soft. The logs reviewed that the underlying ground\n\nwas soft to a depth of 5 metres at the north-west corner of the site and a depth of 14 metres at the\n\nsouth-east corner of the site. The warehouse was evidently erected over soft ground.48. Looking at all the evidence, I found that the plaintiffs had not proved that\n\noverloading alone caused the damage. It was not possible to decide with any degree of accuracy what\n\ndamage the overloading caused in view of the other contributing facts of the weak ground and the\n\ndefective slab construction. These were matters that cannot be resolved by an order for a hearing to\n\nassess damages. I felt that it was necessary to adopt a pragmatic approach to bring matters to a\n\nconclusion.49. On the evidence, the warehouse was in a tenantable state when the defendants\n\ntook possession, but it required the partial re-laying of the floor before it can be rented out\n\nafter they left. After the repairs, the new tenants have moved in and remained on the premises\n\nwithout complaint. It would not be right that the defendants should have to pay for a new floor. On\n\nthe other hand, the plaintiffs should be compensated for the loss incurred as a result of the\n\noverloading.50. In view of the difficulty, if not impossibility of ascertaining the extent of\n\ndamage and the degree of the defendants culpability two and a half years after the damage was\n\ndiscovered and repaired, I ordered that the defendants to pay the plaintiffs the $28, 659.75\n\nexpended on the repairs.51. To my mind, this conclusion favoured the plaintiffs so far as it resolved\n\ntheir difficulty in discharging the onus on them to prove their loss. It was also fair to the\n\ndefendants as it obviated the costs and effort of a hearing on damages. The defendants accepted my\n\ndecision. The plaintiffs, who had their claim reduced from $314,954.32 to $28,659.75, are less\n\npleased, and are appealing against it.",
