        "The appeal": "8          An application to strike out a claim under O 18 r 19 can only succeed if a clear case has been made out for such a course of action. InDyson v Attorney-General[1911] 1 KB 410at 419, Fletcher-Moulton LJ remarked that a plaintiff should not be “driven from the judgment seat” and inTan Eng Khiam v Ultra Realty Pte Ltd[1991] SLR 798at 803, [31], G P Selvam JC (as he then was) explained why courts are reluctant to strike out a claim summarily in the following terms: Courts are reluctant to strike out a claim summarily either under O 18 r 19 of the [Rules of Court] or the inherent jurisdiction. This is anchored on the judicial policy to afford a litigant the right to institute a bona fide claim before the courts and to prosecute it in the usual way. Whenever possible the courts will let the plaintiff proceed with the action unless his case is wholly and clearly unarguable … 9          That the court’s discretion to strike out an action is to be used sparingly has been reiterated by the Court of Appeal on numerous occasions. Wherever possible, the court would allow a plaintiff to amend his statement of claim rather than strike out the action. (See, for instance,Tan Soo Leng David v Wee, Satku & Kumar Pte Ltd[1994] 3 SLR 481andKo Teck Siang v Low Fong Mei[1992] 1 SLR 454). InChing Mun Fong v Liu Cho Chit[2000] 1 SLR 517at [12], L P Thean JA, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said: The jurisdiction to strike out a statement of claim, whether under the Rules of Court or under the court’s inherent jurisdiction, is only exercised in a plain and obvious case. In general, the court’s approach to an application to strike out the statement of claim is to consider if the deficiency or defect therein, on the basis of which the application was made, could be cured by an amendment, and would prefer to allow an amendment rather than to take the drastic course of striking it out. 10        In the present case, LJL sought leave to amend para 3 of its Statement of Claim to clarify matters. It asserted that despite the wording of s 3(a) of the engagement agreement, the parties had intended that this clause would also cover the securitisation of the assets of LJL’s subsidiaries. It added that the real intention of the parties would be apparent if s 3(b) of the engagement contract was taken into account. Section 3(b), which concerns the consequences of a termination by LJL of the said agreement, provides that FLP is entitled upon the termination of the engagement agreement to 50% of the success fee payable as calculated according to s 3(a) if during the period of 12 months after such termination, an investor enters into an agreement “to invest or acquire assets of [LJL] or its subsidiaries and associated companies”. FLP asserted it does not make sense if it is entitled to a payment for the securitisation of the assets of LJL’s subsidiary after the termination of the engagement contract but not if the said securitisation takes place before the said contract has been terminated. 11        Reliance was placed on the following passage from the judgment of Kelly CB inGwyn v The Neath Canal Navigation Company(1868) LR 3Exch 209 at 215, which was cited with approval by Lord Lowry inForsikringsaktieselskapet Vesta v J N E Butcher, Bain Dawes Ltd[1989] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 331 at 345: The result of all the authorities is, that when a court of law can clearly collect from the language within the four corners of a deed, or instrument in writing, the real intentions of the parties, they are bound to give effect to it by supplying anything necessarily to be inferred from the terms used, and by rejecting as superfluous whatever is repugnant to the intention so discerned. 12        Whether FPL’s assertion in relation to the interpretation of s 3(a) of the engagement agreement is tenable remains to be seen. What is evident at this juncture is that it would be premature to strike out its claim. I thus granted leave to FPL to amend its Statement of Claim and reversed the decision of the assistant registrar on the striking out of its claim."
