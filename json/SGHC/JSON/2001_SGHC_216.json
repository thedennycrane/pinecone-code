        "Background": "2. In 1997, Leefon was awarded a subcontract to supply stone materials\n\nfor the building project known as Sunrise Condominium. The main contractor for the project\n\nwas GTM-Wan Soon Construction Pte Ltd. In the course of looking for suppliers, Leefon came\n\ninto contact with Stone Tec, a company which supplies materials for construction work who\n\ngave an initial quotation for the materials. In December 1997, Leefon, wanting a further\n\nquotation from Stone Tec, forwarded to them a fresh bill of quantities (‘BQ’)\n\nand the architect’s drawings for the project.3. On 10 February 1998, Stone Tec wrote to Leefon, by way of proforma\n\ninvoice, setting out the terms on which it was prepared to supply materials (consisting of\n\nsandstone, limestone, compressed marble, granite rubble and other types of stone) to\n\nLeefon for the project. Attached to this letter were 15 pages of the BQ duly filled in\n\nwith the rates at which Stone Tec was prepared to supply the various materials. On 9 March\n\n1998, Leefon accepted Stone Tec’s offer by signing and stamping the proforma invoice\n\nin the manner provided for in the invoice. Stone Tec also signed the proforma invoice,\n\napparently on 10 March 1998.4. Among the terms set out in the proforma invoice was the following:‘Production takes about ten days and it subjected(sic)to\n\n  factory working condition without obstruction. At least 7 days notice is required before\n\n  we proceed cutting(sic)at our factory.’and‘Agreement will be confirmed and valid upon signed(sic)by\n\n  both parties and received your purchase order or confirmation letter.’In the BQ, the dimensions, profiles and quantities of materials\n\nrequired were clearly stated. In addition, the prices quoted by Stone Tec were expressed\n\nin terms of dollars per metre run or per square metre except in respect of pilaster caps\n\nand weirs which were quoted in a per piece basis.5. According to the dates in Stone Tec’s delivery orders, they\n\ncommenced delivery of materials to the project on 24 July 1998 but the bulk of material\n\nwas supplied from 6 October 1998 onwards. The last delivery was made in February 1999.6. Leefon did not pay for the materials as and when the same were\n\nsupplied. Instead, they made payment at odd intervals. Stone Tec contended that these\n\npayments were made in response to demands for settlement of outstanding invoices but\n\nLeefon maintained that the payments were not related to invoices but most were lump sum\n\npayments made on account to help Stone Tec with its cash flow difficulties. The payments\n\nmade were as follows:DateAmount01.08.98$ 61,336.5021.10.98$103,000.0003.12.98$103,000.0005.04.99$ 30,900.0007.05.99$ 51,500.00Total$349,736.507. Some time in mid December 1998, Stone Tec submitted their claim for\n\npayment. Leefon was not satisfied with this computation and a meeting was called at the\n\nend of December to resolve the matter. A further computation was submitted by Stone Tec in\n\nearly 1999 but this too was rejected by Leefon. Leefon asserted that the billing had been\n\ndone using rates different from that quoted in the agreed BQ in that for items for which\n\nthe prices quoted were on a per unit basis, the amount billed was based on the number of\n\ndelivered pieces and for those items in respect of which the prices quoted were on a\n\nsquare metre basis, again the amount billed was based on the number of pieces delivered.\n\nLeefon accordingly did their own computation of what was due to Stone Tec on the basis of\n\nthe prices in the BQ.8. By the beginning of 1999, Leefon had paid Stone Tec $267,236.50 but\n\naccording to Stone Tec’s invoices, this amount was way below what was due to them.\n\nFor the next few months Stone Tec kept pressing for payment and Leefon subsequently made\n\ntwo further payments in April and May 1999. The dispute over the correct billing basis\n\ncontinued and there were various meetings between the parties to try and resolve the\n\nissue. They were not able to do so. By 1 December 1999, Leefon had recomputed the amount\n\ndue to Stone Tec as being $306,918.10. This was not accepted by Stone Tec. According to\n\nthe latter’s invoices, the total amount due from Leefon was $448,988.30 and since\n\nLeefon had paid only $349,736.50 there was a balance due to them of $99,251.80.9. When the action was filed, Leefon had prepared a revised statement\n\nof accounts whereby the total amount due to Stone Tec was computed as being $334,465.52\n\nwhich meant that Leefon had overpaid them by $15,259,98. By the time the trial started,\n\nhowever, Leefon had revised their computation again and they applied for and were given\n\nleave to amend their statement of claim to show that the amount due to Stone Tec was in\n\nfact $336,952.36. This meant that the overpayment was in the lesser amount of $12,784.14\n\nand Leefon accordingly reduced their claim to this sum.",
        "The pleadings": "10. By the time the action was commenced, both sides knew where the\n\nbattle lines were drawn: each of them had come up with different computations of the\n\namounts chargeable by Stone Tec for the materials supplied. When it came to pleadings,\n\nhowever, both sides were succinct in the extreme. This was a case that would have\n\nbenefited from a careful delineation of each party’s stand and the basis therefor\n\ninstead of reliance on standard form short pleadings which are better suited to a case in\n\nwhich there is no substantial dispute.11. The amended statement of claim consisted of two paragraphs. The\n\nfirst stated that the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants was for the sum of\n\n$12,784.14 being the amount overpaid by the plaintiffs to the defendants for the supply of\n\nmaterials for the plaintiffs’ project at Sunrise Gardens Condominium. As particulars\n\nof the claim, the plaintiffs referred to the annexed statement of account. This statement\n\nwas a 13 page long table setting out the plaintiffs’ detailed computation of the\n\namounts due to the defendants for the materials delivered. This table dealt with each type\n\nof material delivered and in respect of the same gave the following details: with\n\nreference to the BQ, the section of the BQ, the description, the size, the unit, the rate,\n\nthe total, the list, the item, and with reference to goods actually supplied, the size,\n\nthe quantity, the unit, the rate and the total. The second paragraph stated that the\n\ndefendants had failed to reimburse the plaintiffs despite repeated demands.12. The defence and counterclaim was equally brief. The first three\n\nparagraphs consisted of denials of the plaintiffs’ claim. The counterclaim consisted\n\nof seven paragraphs but the substance of the claim was contained in only two paragraphs\n\nviz paragraphs 6 and 7 which read:‘6. By a contract or contracts made between the Defendants and the\n\n  Plaintiffs on or about or from February 1998, the Defendants provided the materials\n\n  contracted for to the Plaintiffs for money consideration.7. In breach of the said contract or contracts, the Plaintiffs have to\n\n  date failed to pay for the Defendants’ supplies in the total outstanding sum of\n\n  $99,251.80.PARTICULARSThe particulars are set out in the Annexure herein.’The annexure referred to contained a table of items under the following\n\nheadings: date, invoice number, amount (S$) and at the end of that, a total which was set\n\noff against a list of payments received, credit notes and debit notes. The balance due was\n\nshown as being $99,251.80.13. The defence to counterclaim added nothing substantial. It consisted\n\nmainly of an assertion that the defendants had been overpaid and a denial that the\n\nplaintiffs were indebted to the defendants in the sum of $99,251.80 as claimed or at all.",
        "The parties’ cases as appeared from the affidavits of evidence-in-chief": "14. Leefon had two witnesses. The first was Daniel Wee Han Boon. He was\n\na project manager with Leefon, in charge of their Stone Division, between February 1997\n\nand December 1998. The first few paragraphs of his affidavit dealt with initial\n\nnegotiations between Leefon and Stone Tec which had focussed on the rates quoted by Stone\n\nTec. Finally, the parties came to an agreement in about early February 1998 and Stone\n\nTec’s proforma invoice was signed thereafter. According to Mr Wee’s affidavit,\n\nthe contract consisted of the proforma invoice and the agreed BQ referred to therein and\n\nthese documents were exhibited as WHB3 to his affidavit. That exhibit comprised the\n\nproforma invoice, the completed BQ consisting of ten pages and Stone Tec’s quotation\n\ndated 8 October 1997 which consisted of five pages.15. Mr Wee went on to say that the contract was done on a back-to-back\n\nbasis in that Stone Tec was to co-ordinate with the main contractor in respect of the work\n\nschedule, delivery schedule for the materials, cut lists, fabrication/templates, and\n\narrangement for delivery of the materials. Apart from this co-ordination, all other\n\nqueries of the main contractor from Stone Tec and vice versa were to be routed to Leefon.\n\nThe cutting lists were to be forwarded to Stone Tec by the main contractor on a\n\nprogressive basis.16. In April 1998, Stone Tec informed Leefon that the full cutting\n\nlists had not yet been received from the main contractor and that they would not be\n\nresponsible for any delay in the project as a result. In May the main contractor informed\n\nLeefon that there were some changes to the original drawings/plans. These changes were\n\ndocumented in the form of supplemental drawings and forwarded to Stone Tec. On 8 August\n\n1998, Leefon forwarded to Stone Tec five cutting lists together with 12 drawings and four\n\nschedules of quantities.17. Some time between August and September 1998, Herman Ang, Stone\n\nTec’s general manager, requested Daniel Wee to make part- payment of $103,000 to\n\nenable Stone Tec to ship in sandstone. Mr Wee stated that he authorised this part-payment\n\nas he was shown documents evidencing that shipping arrangements had indeed been made.18. In October 1998, the main contractor informed Leefon that the\n\ndelivery schedule for the fabricated sandstone had not been complied with. The main\n\ncontractor was also not satisfied with the quality of the sandstone so far delivered.\n\nAttempts made by Mr Wee to contact Mr Ang to resolve these complaints were unsuccessful\n\nand subsequently Mr Wee decided to visit Stone Tec’s fabricators in Singapore to find\n\nout the actual status of affairs. He learnt from these visits that none of the fabrication\n\nworks were complete and he subsequently wrote to Stone Tec informing them that all\n\nfabrication works should be completed by 21 November 1998. This deadline was not complied\n\nwith.19. On 21 November 1998, Stone Tec asked for funds to enable them to\n\nmake payment to their suppliers and fabricators. Mr Wee said that he refused to authorise\n\nthis payment was Stone Tec was not able to show that they had carried out substantial work\n\nthat would justify the payment request. However, subsequently, Leefon’s then deputy\n\ngeneral manager, one Mr Liew, authorised the payment and the second payment of $103,000\n\nwas made on 3 December 1998.20. Paragraphs 20 to 23 of the affidavit dealt with some difficulties\n\nrelating to the fabrication works and the use of epoxy pieces as a temporary measure. The\n\nmain contractor wanted these pieces removed and while the parties were trying to sort out\n\nthe situation, Stone Tec submitted their payment claims to Leefon. Mr Wee told his\n\ncolleague, Mr Seah, to look into these claims. He himself left Leefon’s employ on 31\n\nDecember 1998.21. The next witness was Mr Ronnie Seah Chong Peng. He was a senior\n\nproject executive in the employ of Leefon between October 1996 and June 2000. Much of his\n\naffidavit recited events that had already been dealt with by Mr Wee. In paragraph 21, he\n\nstarted to deal with the claim for payment made by Stone Tec in December 1998. Mr Seah\n\nsaid that this claim contained only the invoice numbers, the dates of the invoices and the\n\nsub-total amount due without specifying the actual quantities supplied or the unit rate\n\nand without making any reference to the agreed BQ. A meeting was convened on 26 December\n\nto try to resolve the matter.22. At the meeting, Leefon was represented by Mr Wee, Mr Liew, and Mr\n\nSeah whilst Stone Tec’s representatives were Mr Ang, Mr David Lim, their site\n\nco-ordinator, and Ms Lucy Wang, a director of Stone Tec who was in charge of billing.\n\nDuring the meeting, Stone Tec was told to submit their claims in a table format and/or in\n\na form of a ‘schedule of finish’ so as to facilitate comparison of the items\n\nsupplied with the items and prices quoted in the BQ. Mr Seah asked Stone Tec to forward\n\ntheir computation in a table which would indicate the materials supplied and the total\n\ncost of these materials based on the unit and unit rates contained in the BQ.23. In early 1999, Stone Tec submitted their computation. Mr Seah\n\nrejected this computation because the billing was done using rates which were different\n\nfrom those quoted in the agreed BQ in that for items which the prices quoted were per\n\nunit, the amount billed was based on the number of delivered pieces and that for items for\n\nwhich prices quoted were in square metres, the amount billed for the quantity similar was\n\nagain based on the number of pieces delivered. Stone Tec did not furnish any conversion\n\nformula to enable Mr Seah to verify their computation. Stone Tec was therefore told to\n\nresubmit their computation based on unit and unit rate as denoted in the agreed BQ.24. Instead of resubmitting the computation, between March and July\n\n1999, Stone Tec sent numerous reminders to Leefon asking for the outstanding amount to be\n\npaid. On 7 July 1999, Leefon wrote to Stone Tec stating its reason for non-payment. This\n\nwas that there was a discrepancy between the prices quoted in the BQ and accepted by\n\nLeefon and the prices actually charged. Leefon also said that up to then they had paid\n\nStone Tec $280,000 as against its claim on the invoices totalling $380,000. Such payment\n\nhad been made out of goodwill. The full payment according to the invoices could not be\n\nmade because of discrepancies.25. In early August 1999, Leefon suggested that a site meeting be held\n\nto confirm the actual quantities of materials supplied and/or any additional works done.\n\nThe site meeting was held on 10 August 1999 and attended by Mr David Lim and Mr Seah.\n\nDuring that meeting, no verification took place but Mr Lim agreed that all materials\n\nsupplied were in accordance with the agreed BQ and the additional and variation works were\n\nas previously agreed between the parties.26. Around the end of August there was another meeting to try and\n\nresolve the problem. Again Stone Tec was asked to submit a summarised bill in a table\n\nformat to facilitate comparison with the rates in the BQ. Stone Tec forwarded their\n\nfurther computation on 15 September. Mr Seah compared this with the construction drawings,\n\ncut lists and actual supply to site as reflected in the delivery orders. He did not agree\n\nwith the computation as he found that the items listed were not according to those in the\n\nBQ. Further, there were a lot of items that were not listed in the BQ. He therefore\n\nrecomputed the figures and forwarded his computation to Stone Tec on 16 November 1999 for\n\ntheir verification. Subsequently, the parties met on 23 November 1999 and Stone Tec put\n\nforward their objections to Leefon’s computation. Subsequently, Mr Seah recomputed\n\nthe figures based on a detailed study of the quotation and agreed BQ, the cut lists and\n\nsite measurements. The re-computation was forwarded to Stone Tec but they did not accept\n\nit. Thereafter, the parties were not able to reach any agreement. It is important to note\n\nthat although certain portions of Mr Seah’s affidavit were expunged on Stone\n\nTec’s objections, as they dealt with without prejudice negotiations between the\n\nparties, those parts of his affidavit I have paraphrased above were not affected by these\n\ncriticisms. Yet, Stone Tec did not cross-examine him at all on any of the allegations\n\nwhich remained in his affidavit.27. There were three witnesses for Stone Tec. The first was Herman Ang\n\nSoon Leang. Mr Ang identified himself as a director of Stone Tec and confirmed that on or\n\nabout 9 March 1998, he, on behalf of Stone Tec and Daniel Wee, on behalf of Leefon, had\n\nsigned an agreement whereby Stone Tec was to provide materials to Leefon for the Sunrise\n\nCondominium. He identified the agreement as being exhibit ASL2 to his affidavit. This\n\nexhibit contained the proforma invoice, the five page quotation of October 1997 and the\n\nten page BQ. He went on to say that Leefon required a substantial portion of the materials\n\nto be custom-made and cut to measure. He told Mr Seah and Mr Wee that since the slabs had\n\nto be cut to measure, exact site measurements would have to be given to him and also\n\nincorporated in the form of a complete cutting list. However, the cutting list was not\n\nsupplied to Stone Tec and therefore for those materials that required cutting, Stone Tec\n\nhad no choice but to order un-cut slab materials from India and wait for Leefon to supply\n\ncutting lists with the exact measurements required.28. Finally, the first part of the cutting list was given to Stone Tec\n\nwho proceeded with the cutting works almost immediately. Mr Ang recalled that cutting\n\nworks commenced on or about 2 October 1998 and were completed on or about 5 December 1998.\n\nMr Ang told Mr Seah about his concern that Leefon’s instructions were also given at\n\nshort notice and that the cutting lists were not complete but given to him in parts. Mr\n\nSeah told Mr Ang to go ahead and rush his subcontractors with the cutting works and\n\nsupplies. He would ensure that Stone Tec was paid. Stone Tec delivered the materials as\n\nagreed and raised invoices to Leefon for the materials supplied. These invoices were not\n\npaid in full. Yet, Stone Tec continued to perform their end of the agreement to\n\ncompletion.29. Mr Ang went on to say that Stone Tec had sent various reminders to\n\nLeefon for payment. Rather amazingly, Leefon then commenced this action against Stone Tec\n\nfor a sum allegedly overpaid to Stone Tec. In sheer exasperation Stone Tec retained\n\nsolicitors to defend the claim and commence a counterclaim.30. The next witness was Ms Lucy Wang Siam Keng. She was also a\n\ndirector of Stone Tec. Her affidavit contained nothing that was different from the\n\ncontents of Mr Ang’s affidavit. In fact, most of her affidavit was hearsay based on\n\nwhat she understood Mr Ang had told Mr Seah and Mr Seah had told Mr Ang. She too was\n\n‘amazed’ that Leefon had sued Stone Tec and confirmed that Stone Tec had acted\n\n‘in sheer exasperation’ in defending the claim and mounting the counterclaim.31. The last witness was David Lim Boon Ann who was the sales and\n\nproject co-ordinator of Stone Tec. His affidavit was identical to that of Ms Wang.",
        "The decision below": "32. The District Judge first summarised the case of each party. She\n\nthen noted that what had to be determined were first the nature of the contract between\n\nthe parties and secondly, whether Stone Tec was entitled to apply rates that differed from\n\nthose in the BQ to the materials supplied. The judge did not go on to note the third\n\nmatter to be determined, perhaps because of the decision she had reached on the first two.\n\nThe third issue was whether, on the basis that Stone Tec’s rates were not\n\ncontractually agreed, Leefon’s calculations based on the BQ were correct.33. After summarising the evidence presented by each party, the judge\n\ndiscussed her findings. The judge noted that Leefon had not referred to the contract\n\nbetween the parties in their pleadings. They had merely made their claim for overpayment\n\nwithout stating its basis. However, it was not disputed in evidence that the contract for\n\nthe supply of materials was AB3 to AB14 [note: these pages comprised the proforma invoice\n\nand the BQ but excluded the October 1997 quotation]. She examined the computation made by\n\nLeefon of the materials supplied and observed that Leefon could not show in this\n\ncomputation that the materials supplied corresponded with the descriptions in the BQ.34. The judge went on to find that the contract was a contract for the\n\nsupply of materials. She also observed that ‘it may be’ that the parties had\n\nagreed that the cutting lists from the main contractors be taken as the purchase orders.\n\nShe also noted that the delivery terms of the contract provided for production to take ten\n\ndays and seven days’ notice to be given before cutting was to be proceeded with so\n\nthat all in all 17 days’ notice was required for delivery. In fact, no such notice\n\nwas given and the materials were all delivered within a few days of supply of the cutting\n\nlists.35. The judge stated that it was not disputed that the materials that\n\nwere ultimately supplied by Stone Tec were vastly different from the descriptions in the\n\nBQ. It was also not disputed that where the items were the same as those in the BQ, the\n\nrates in the BQ were used. She continued at 20 of her grounds:‘20. An examination of the description of the items in the\n\n  delivery orders and invoices, which are in accordance with the cutting lists, would show\n\n  that they do not correspond with the descriptions in the BQ at all. A comparison of the\n\n  descriptions in the BQ and the delivery orders would show substantial differences, for\n\n  which it would not be possible to extrapolate the agreed rates in the BQ to apply to the\n\n  materials delivered by the defendants. As such, they must be taken to be variation orders\n\n  or additional orders. The issue therefore, arose as to whether the terms of the variation\n\n  orders or additional orders have been agreed by the plaintiffs. Mr Ang has alleged that Mr\n\n  Wee and Mr Seah had undertaken to pay the defendants pursuant to the variation but he had\n\n  not informed them of the rates for the variation orders. However, the defendants had\n\n  issued invoices to the plaintiffs on the same date as the delivery orders for the\n\n  materials delivered. There was no evidence that the plaintiffs had disputed any of these\n\n  invoices until sometime in December 1998, according to Mr Wee’s evidence. Mr Wee\n\n  claimed upon clarification by the court, that he did not receive the invoices. However, he\n\n  admitted that he was aware that the invoices were sent and he claimed that he had\n\n  highlighted to Mr Ang verbally that the defendants should make progress claims.’36. The judge went on to state that since the contract was for the\n\nsupply of materials, it was not necessary for Stone Tec to make progress claims rather\n\nthan to issue invoices. Leefon had paid Stone Tec’s first two invoices on 1 August\n\n1998 and had not raised any issue that a progress claim should have been made by Stone\n\nTec. The bulk of the invoices for the sandstone supplied were dated from 6 October 1998 to\n\n31 December 1998. She then referred to Stone Tec’s submission that Leefon’s\n\nagreement to Stone Tec’s rates for the variations orders and the additional orders\n\ncould be inferred from their conduct in accepting and using the materials supplied. The\n\njudge concluded in 23:‘The plaintiffs did not reject or return any of the materials or\n\n  raise an issue over the invoices initially. In fact, upon receipt of the invoices, various\n\n  payments were made by them on 21 October 1998, 3 December 1998, 5 April 1999 and 7 May\n\n  1999. While the last two payments were made after the dispute had arisen, the first two\n\n  were not. Although the 30 day payment period may not have expired on 21 October 1998 or 3\n\n  December 1998, Mr Wee admitted under cross-examination that part of the materials been\n\n  delivered when the payments were made and in respect of the payment made on 3 December\n\n  1998, the defendants had probably delivered materials up to the value of the payments that\n\n  were made. In any event, the delivery orders together with the invoices would have been\n\n  submitted by the defendants. Mr Wee claimed that he did not look at the invoices as the\n\n  contract was a progressive one. But the terms of the contract at AB3 as regards payment\n\n  are clear. There is no requirement for a progressive claim to be made. In the words of\n\n  Steyn LJ inTrentham Ltd v Archital Luxfer[1993] Lloyd’s Law Reports, 25, at\n\n  page 29:\"In a case where the transaction was fully performed the argument\n\n    that there was no evidence upon which the Judge could find that a contract was proved is\n\n    implausible. A contract can be concluded by conduct …\"In the circumstances, I agree with the defendants’ counsel’s\n\n  submission that there was a contract for the supply of the materials at the rates stated\n\n  in the invoices, by the conduct of the plaintiffs in accepting delivery and using the\n\n  materials upon receipt of the invoices. The plaintiffs continued to do so until all the\n\n  materials required for the project have been supplied and delivered by the\n\n  defendants.’",
        "Analysis": "37. From the above, it can be seen that the judge’s decision was\n\nbased on the following:(1) her finding that many of the items in the Stone Tec invoices did\n\n  not correspond at all with the descriptions in the BQ and her inference from that finding\n\n  that it would not be possible to extrapolate the agreed rates in the BQ to apply to the\n\n  materials delivered;(2) her conclusion that those materials which did not comply with the\n\n  description in the BQ had to be considered as additional or variation orders;(3) her redefining of the issue as being whether the terms of the\n\n  variation or additional orders had been agreed by Leefon and her finding that Leefon did\n\n  not reject or return any of the materials or raise any of issues initially but had instead\n\n  made two payments in October and December 1998 ‘upon receipt of the invoices’;\n\n  and(4) her conclusion that there was a contract for the supply of\n\n  materials at the rate stated in the invoices arising from Leefon’s conduct in\n\n  accepting the delivery and using materials upon receipt of the invoices.38. With due respect to the judge, I cannot accept her reasoning.\n\nFirst, there is no evidence to substantiate her conclusion that because the items in the\n\ninvoices were described differently from the items in the BQ no extrapolation could be\n\nmade from the BQ rates to establish the cost of the items delivered. Mr Seah’s\n\ntestimony was that he had been able to do exactly that by a detailed study of the\n\nquotation and the BQ, the cutting lists and the site measurements. He also took into\n\naccount the actual items supplied to the site as reflected in the delivery orders. Such a\n\ncalculation is not impossible since the items delivered were used in accordance with the\n\ndrawings and the BQ had been drawn up on that basis as well. It was not as if the items\n\nwere to be used in some way that was totally different than the use originally envisaged.\n\nIt would be recalled that Mr Seah had averred that at a meeting at the site in August\n\n1999, Mr Lim had agreed that all materials supplied were in accordance with the BQ. Mr\n\nSeah was not cross-examined on this allegation or on any of the computations that he had\n\nmade in relation to the correct costing for the items delivered. It was not put to him\n\nthat overall what he had done was an impossibility nor were any specific areas in any of\n\nhis computations criticised. At the least, this lack of cross-examination showed that\n\nStone Tec had no basis on which to quarrel with those computations. At the most it could\n\nbe considered an admission of the truth of Mr Seah’s evidence.39. Secondly, there was little basis for the conclusion that the\n\nmaterials that did not comply with the description of items in the B Q had to be\n\nconsidered as additional or variation orders by that reason alone. This conclusion was\n\nbased on the physical differences in the description only. It was not based on any\n\npleading on the part of Stone Tec. Nor was it based on any case made out in the affidavits\n\nof evidence-in-chief of Stone Tec’s witnesses. Mr Ang had agreed in 4 of his\n\naffidavit that the contract between the parties was the one signed by Mr Wee and himself\n\nin March 1998. He said nothing in any of the paragraphs following that about there being\n\nadditional or variation orders. His concern in the subsequent paragraphs was to explain\n\nthe difficulties that Stone Tec had encountered because of alleged delays in the delivery\n\nof the cutting lists and the fact that he had had to order uncut slabs of sandstone from\n\nIndia and arrange for cutting in Singapore. Since it was not pleaded that there had been\n\nadditional or variation orders to which different rates would apply from those agreed to\n\nin the BQ, it was not open to Stone Tec’s counsel to make submissions on that basis.\n\nNor was it open to the judge to make a finding on the issue.40. It was Stone Tec who contended that the rates in their invoices\n\n(which they agreed were not the BQ rates) were the applicable rates. This was the basis of\n\nStone Tec’s counterclaim. They should have pleaded their case on that basis. Instead,\n\ntheir counterclaim simply referred to a contract or contracts made from February 1998\n\nwithout specifying that such contract was any different from that relied on by Leefon. Nor\n\ndid they give any particulars of how such contract was formed ie by oral agreement or by\n\nconduct. This deficiency in the pleading was compounded by the affidavits of\n\nevidence-in-chief. There was nothing there to tell either Leefon or the court that Stone\n\nTec was proceeding on contracts that were different from or additional to the one sued on\n\nby Leefon and accepted by the judge asthecontract between the parties. Stone Tec\n\nhad the onus of making their counterclaim clear. They could only propound a case that was\n\npleaded. Having failed to meet this basic legal obligation, there was no ground for them\n\nto put forward arguments on variation of the contract or on additional contracts whether\n\nor not there was evidence to support their assertion that Mr Wee had agreed to pay them\n\nextra. In fact such evidence was irrelevant in the context of their pleaded case which\n\ncontained no reference to any new contract or any contract which had been varied for good\n\nconsideration.41. Since there was a contract in existence, there was no room for any\n\nargument or conclusion that the acceptance and use of materials delivered by Stone Tec\n\nresulted in contracts for the purchase of those materials at the rates stated in the\n\ninvoices issued. The cases quoted by counsel for Stone Tec both in the court below and\n\nbefore me related to the very different situation where, in the absence of any existing\n\nwritten or oral contract, conduct was used to show that the parties had come to an\n\nagreement. The situation here was the opposite: a contract existed and the conduct was in\n\naccordance with the existing contract. Leefon had asked Stone Tec to supply materials on a\n\ncertain basis. When the materials came, Leefon accepted them and used them as it was all\n\nalong envisaged they would be accepted and used. Acceptance and use of the materials in\n\nthese circumstances cannot be used to justify a conclusion that Leefon had agreed to the\n\nnew rates quoted in the invoices.42. Further, the invoices sent reflected charges on a per piece basis.\n\nUntil these charges were examined carefully in the context of the amount of material\n\nsupplied, it could not be ascertained whether the rates charged were as per the BQ or\n\notherwise. In the situation that existed, Leefon’s acceptance and use of the\n\nmaterials was not capable of giving rise to only one inference ie that they had agreed to\n\npay whatever Stone Tec had chosen to charge and that they were no longer relying on the\n\nagreed contractual rates. It should be noted that the rates in the BQ were those quoted by\n\nStone Tec and accepted by Leefon and for that reason it may not have occurred to Leefon\n\nthat the rates in the invoices would have differed from those in the BQ. Further, as was\n\npointed out below, the original intention had been for the items to be cut locally rather\n\nthan in India as indicated by the condition in the proforma invoice relating to the seven\n\nday notice requirement before Stone Tec would proceed with ‘cutting at our\n\nfactory’. Thus, an increase in rates by reason of local cutting would not have been a\n\nfactor in Leefon’s consideration when they accepted the materials. It should be noted\n\nthat it was not put to Mr Wee during cross-examination that Mr Ang had informed him that\n\nlocal cutting would result in increased costs and that he had urged Stone Tec to go ahead\n\nnevertheless.43. None of the four payments made by Leefon before the dispute over\n\nbilling arose was made in such circumstances as to give rise to an unequivocal inference\n\nthat Leefon had accepted the new rates. The non BQ rates were applied mainly to the\n\nsandstone which was delivered from October 6 onwards. Before that Leefon had paid Stone\n\nTec $61,336.50 which was the amount outstanding under two invoices dated 24 July 1998\n\nissued for granite rubble stone and broken Solnhofen. Most of these materials were charged\n\nat unit prices based on the area in terms of square metre of materials delivered, though\n\none component was charged on a per piece basis. According to Mr Ang, the materials billed\n\nfor here were straight forward materials, not sandstone, and therefore did not require any\n\ncutting. The billing for these materials was in accordance with the BQ and the different\n\ncomponents were charged according to the ‘metre square’ rate or the piece rate.\n\nSince these invoices were in accordance with the BQ rates, Leefon’s payment of them\n\ncould not give rise to any inference of accepting a varied rate or varied price basis.44. The next two payments made by Leefon were in the sum of $103,000\n\neach. Leefon’s explanation was that these were lump sum payments made to help Stone\n\nTec to pay their fabricators and stone cutters. These payments did not represent\n\nacceptance of outstanding invoices although, in court, Mr Wee accepted that by the time\n\nthe first of these payments was made, ie on 21 November 1998, Stone Tec had probably\n\nsupplied materials which exceeded $103,000 in value. In rejecting Leefon’s\n\nexplanation of these payments, the judge overlooked the fact that the amounts of the\n\npayments were round sums and did not reflect individual invoices issued in respect of\n\ndeliveries made. Nor did she have regard to the letter that Stone Tec wrote to Leefon on\n\n21 November 1998 asking for $100,000 to enable Stone Tec to pay their suppliers and\n\nfabricators. No mention was made in that letter of payment of specific invoices for\n\nmaterials already supplied nor was there any reference to any change in the costing due to\n\nthe cutting lists and/or the necessity to fabricate locally instead of in India.45. The character of these two payments was also reflected by the fact\n\nthat Stone Tec, as shown by the appendix to their counterclaim, had issued specific\n\ninvoices for these two amounts and subsequently, in drawing up their accounts, deducted\n\nthe amounts of these two invoices from their claims. Otherwise there would have been a\n\nduplication and an overcharge since the two invoices for $103,000 each did not reflect any\n\nspecific delivery of materials.46. In order to establish their counterclaim, Stone Tec had also to\n\nshow how their invoices were computed. They, however, failed to show exactly how this was\n\ndone. There was no explanation of how they arrived at the prices charged. Mr Ang was\n\nunable to explain to the court how the balance sum of $99,251.80 which Stone Tec claimed\n\nto be due had been derived. His only explanation was that the invoices had been done by Ms\n\nWang. During cross-examination of Ms Wang she was taken through some of the invoices and\n\nasked on what basis they had been prepared. Her reply was that the invoices were based on\n\nthe cutting lists and they tallied with the BQ except when the sizes of materials supplied\n\nhad differed. When asked to cross refer to the BQ and quotation and point out the\n\ncorresponding item numbers in the BQ, she was unable to do so. Further, when she was asked\n\nfor the computation of the amount outstanding, Mr Wang’s reply was that she had\n\n‘forgotten to put it in’. As early as 4 December 1999 in response to a letter\n\nfrom Leefon asking for the basis of Stone Tec’s claim, Stone Tec had stated that they\n\nwere trying to extract all necessary documents to show Leefon how their claim was\n\ncalculated. Unfortunately, by the time the matter came to court, this was still not done.\n\nWhilst Stone Tec was able to give a mathematical calculation of their claim by adding the\n\namounts of all the invoices together and subtracting the payments received from the total\n\n(as they had done as early as 23 November 1999), they were not able to justify their bills\n\nby reference to agreed rates or their own costs or even by what would be reasonable costs\n\nin the market for the items supplied.Conclusion47. Whilst I have pointed out the deficiencies in Stone Tec’s\n\nevidence, the basic problem with their counterclaim was that it was not properly pleaded.\n\nAs every litigation lawyer should know, what you do not plead you cannot prove and thus\n\ncannot successfully claim. Stone Tec failed to establish any legal basis which would have\n\nentitled them to charge Leefon for the materials in the way that they did. It was common\n\nground that the substantial portion of Stone Tec’s claim was not calculated in\n\naccordance with the BQ which contained the contractually agreed rates. Stone Tec having\n\nfailed to show the legal basis of their claim, the counterclaim failed and should have\n\nbeen dismissed.48. As regards Leefon’s claim, they pleaded that they had overpaid\n\nStone Tec based on their computation of what was due to Stone Tec under the contract. The\n\ncontract was admitted by Stone Tec. Stone Tec denied that they had been overpaid but they\n\ndid not challenge Mr Seah’s evidence on how the computation had been arrived at based\n\non the BQ rates, taken together with the drawings, the cutting lists and the amounts\n\ndelivered. This was a grievous mistake on their part. Since they did not challenge that\n\nevidence, they must be held to have accepted it as the correct calculation of the amount\n\ndue on the basis that the correct rates to apply were those contained in the BQ.\n\nAccordingly, Leefon had proved their claim and it should have been allowed.49. In the premises, I allow Leefon’s appeal and set aside the\n\njudgment below. There shall be judgment for Leefon in the sum of $12,784.14 together with\n\ninterest at 6% per annum from the date of the judgment below. Stone Tec’s\n\ncounterclaim is dismissed. Leefon shall have the costs of the action and of this appeal.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
