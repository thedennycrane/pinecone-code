        "Introduction": "2       This is an appeal by the wife (“the Wife”) against the following orders granted by the learned District Judge (“the Judge”) inJAE v JAF[2014] SGDC 373 (“the GD”) andJBX v JBY[2014] SGDC 449 (“the Supplemental GD”) (JBX corresponds to JAE – the Husband; JBY corresponds to JAF – the Wife): (a)     that the husband (“the Husband”) was entitled to 30% of the current market value of the property in Poland (“the Poland property”); and (b)     that the Wife should not be awarded a separate sum for the cost of a return air ticket to Poland once a year.",
        "The Poland property": "",
        "Background": "3       I deal first with the Poland property. This was purchased on or around 13 February 2001, and held by the Wife in her sole name. Both parties do not dispute that the purchase was completed before the date of marriage, 25 October 2002. 4       The purchase price of the Poland property, including taxes, was PLN 189,220 (S$73,149.40). It was not disputed at the appeal that the Husband’s financial contribution amounted to £15,000. 5       This property was one of two that the Judge divided. The second was a property in Scotland (“the Scotland property”) acquired during the marriage, the division for which the Wife has not appealed.",
        "The Judge’s decision": "30     The Judge first estimated the Wife’s expenses to be in the region of S$2,000. The Judge also took into account the fact that the Wife’s last drawn income was US$1,200 in 2001 and that she had not worked for 13 years. Nevertheless, the Judge noted that the Wife had acknowledged that it was possible for her to earn about S$2,200 to S$2,500 per month. The Judge observed that the Husband had already agreed to contribute the sum of S$100 per month for travel-related expenses and this was one of the components that had been taken into account for the purpose of determining the monthly maintenance order. It was further acknowledged that the Husband was responsible for providing the Wife with accommodation, the services of a full-time domestic helper and paying for the children’s expenses. In the circumstances, the Judge found that the Husband should not be made to bear the additional costs of the return air ticket to Poland.",
        "The Wife’s arguments": "28     The Wife is seeking a separate sum for the cost of a return air ticket to Poland on a yearly basis over and above the maintenance sum that the Husband has been ordered to pay the Wife on a monthly basis, because she has had this benefit for the last seven years. Further the maintenance sum had been reduced from November last year on the Judge’s expectation that she would find employment, but she has not managed to secure employment.",
        "The Husband’s arguments": "29     The Husband pointed out that he had already remarried and the monthly maintenance he paid was sufficient. He also referred to the Judge’s observations that the Wife was well educated and her income could supplement the maintenance she received from the Husband. The Wife’s difficulty in obtaining employment was attributed to her setting her expectations too high.",
        "My decision": "31     It is common practice not to make a separate reimbursement order for travel where there is a monthly sum set aside. Christopher Lau JC inMichelle Hong Chi Fung (m.w.) v Lin Cheow Sye and another[1995] SGHC 267 observed that the “maintenance [did] include a share in the cost of the [wife’s] air tickets”. In that case, the wife was from Hong Kong and the parties had entered into an earlier agreement, where the husband was responsible for providing two return air tickets to Hong Kong each year until the wife remarried. Nevertheless, Lau JC did not see it fit to incorporate the provision of air tickets as a separate order given that the maintenance sum ordered in favour of the wife already took into account the cost of the wife’s air tickets. 32     The issue then is whether,on the facts, the maintenance sum ordered reasonably includes such travel expenses. For this reason, although that particular order was not under appeal, I turned my attention to the monthly maintenance sum ordered. 33     Regarding the monthly maintenance sum, there is a discrepancy in the maintenance sum first ordered by the Judge and the Supplemental GD. In the initial order, because the Judge expected the Wife to commence work and bear a part of her own expenses, the Judge ordered the Husband to pay the Wife maintenance of S$1,200 per month from 3 November 2014. This is also reflected in the notes of evidence recorded by the Judge on 26 June 2014. In the Supplemental GD released on 10 December 2014, the Judge put the post-3 November sum as S$1,500. 34     This discrepancy was highlighted by the Wife in her supplemental written submissions, where she stated that she was paid S$300 short in November and December 2014. The Husband has paid maintenance of S$1,200 per month with effect from November 2014. Those payments must be correct given the order made by the Judge. 35     Looking at this issue of maintenance again, at [12] of the Supplemental GD, the Judge set out a thorough breakdown of the Wife’s claimed expenses. In brief, the Wife claimed that her monthly expenses amounted to S$3,000, while the court’s assessment put the figure at S$1,500. The Judge then added a further sum of S$500 per month to the Wife’s share of household expenses to arrive at an estimated figure of S$2,000 per month. It was on this basis that the Judge arrived at the conclusion that the “$1,500-00 per month award” would pay for the Wife’s personal expenses (after 3 November) if she wanted to travel. I find the figures set out and reasons given in the Supplemental GD for the sum of S$1,500 to be valid and fair. 36     It is useful at this juncture to consider the expenses for which the Husband is currently responsible, whether directly or indirectly through his employment benefits: (a)     rental for the Wife and the children’s current residence, amounting to S$5,200 per month; (b)     hire purchase payments for the Wife’s car, amounting to S$1,200 per month; (c)     utilities, telephone, cable television and internet bills; (d)     payment for the foreign worker’s levy for the Wife’s foreign domestic worker, the costs of her medical check-ups as required by the Ministry of Manpower, the insurance associated with engaging a foreign domestic worker and to provide her with airfare for her return to her homeland at the expiry of her employment contract; (e)     healthcare insurance for the children; (f)     return air tickets for the children to a destination of the Wife’s choice once a year; and (g)     the children’s school fees and bus fares. 37     Over and above the contributions set out above, the Husband is also paying maintenance of S$2,000 per month for each child. This adds up to S$4,000 per month for the children’s maintenance alone. With reference to the breakdown in expenses set out above, the Husband’s financial contributions are by no means insignificant, even without taking into account the maintenance for the Wife. 38     At the same time, the Wife is still enjoying the benefit of the rental home and the car through the Husband’s housing allowance. In addition, she receives the rental income from the Poland property. In her written submissions, the Wife stated that she had been receiving rent amounting to PLN 1,000 to PLN 1,200 (S$400 to S$480) per month. 39     Having regard to all the relevant circumstances, I order that the Wife’s monthly maintenance be set at S$1,500 per month from 3 March 2015. On this basis, and taking into account the Wife’s age and her future employment prospects, I agree with the Judge’s view that the Husband should not be made to pay for the Wife’s air ticket to Poland over and above the maintenance sum ordered in favour of the Wife. While the Wife took issue with the Judge’s comment that it was possible for her to earn up to a maximum of $2,500, her expected share of the household expenses envisages that she could take an offer of employment at a much lower salary.",
        "The return air ticket to Poland": "27     It is not disputed that prior to the finalisation of the divorce, one of the benefits which the Husband enjoyed under his employment contract was the provision of air tickets for the children and the Wife, which she used for trips to Poland. Upon the finalisation of the divorce, the Husband’s employer will continue to fund the children’s air tickets but not the Wife’s.",
        "Supplemental bundle adduced at appeal hearing": "40     At the hearing of the appeal, the Wife used supplemental submissions which included tables based on existing evidence as well as new evidence. I should mention for the avoidance of doubt that there was no application to adduce further evidence on appeal; neither did I take any of the additional evidence into consideration. Evidence had been canvassed at length in the trial below, with cross-examination, and the Judge’s findings were made thereafter. The extra materials did not affect the evidence in any crucial way and did not add to the arguments: there was thus insufficient ground to admit the new evidence on appeal (as required in these cases: seeACU v ACR[2011] 1 SLR 1235).",
        "Conclusion": "41     For the reasons set out above, the appeal is partially allowed. I make the following orders: (a)     The Poland property is not to be divided. The Wife is to retain the Poland property in her sole name. (b)     The balance sum of S$237,434 arising out of the sale of the Scotland property is to be apportioned between the parties as to 25% to the Wife and 75% to the Husband. The Wife’s share is S$59,358.50. (c)     The Husband is to pay to the Wife the sum of S$59,358.50 within 14 days from the date of this order. (d)     The Husband shall pay the Wife monthly maintenance of S$1,500 with effect from 3 March 2015. (e)     Liberty to apply. (f)     All other orders made by the Judge are to stand. 42     I shall hear parties on costs."
