        "Issue 1": "15     This issue can be dealt with quite simply. The contemporaneous records show that the Shares transferred to LLW were trust shares held by BN on trust for RDN. These shares were expressly transferred from BN to LLW on a trustee-to-trustee basis with no change of beneficial ownership. LLW is well-educated person and holds a Bachelor of Science and Physics degree, a Master of Science and Computer degree and a MBA degree in investment and finance. He would have understood the documents he executed when the Shares were transferred to him from BN. He accepted the Shares and he did not raise any queries or protests with BN, VL or RDN until after the working relationship with RDN had broken down and RDN instituted these proceedings to recover the Shares. The evidence showed that he knew when he received the Shares that he was to hold them on trust for RDN.",
        "Issue 2": "16     The conduct which LLW relies on is: (a)     an agreement[note: 18]dated 19 January 2010 between LLW and Maggie Lau Fung Sim (“ML”), the wife of RDN whereby LLW agreed to assign all his shares in ACDN and another company, TQ Global Pte Ltd to a third company Trackstar Enterprises Ltd, referred to as Trackstar Ltd in the agreement (“Trackstar”).  ML in turn agreed to transfer 6.5% of the shares of Trackstar to LLW. In his affidavit, LLW asked “If there had indeed been an arrangement between [RDN] and I that I was to hold the shares in [ACDN] on trust for [RDN], there would have been no need for [ML] and I to enter into the 2010 Agreement.”[note: 19]I understand the argument to be that if RDN was already the beneficial owner of the Shares, there was no necessity for LLW to transfer the Shares. The answer is that if the intention was to transfer the full interest in the ACDN shares to Trackstar, LLW’s legal title needed to be included in the transfer exercise. (b)     an email RDN sent to LLW on 22 November 2010 to inform LLW that “the 90% shares in ACDN which are registered in your name are held on behalf of TQ-Global (HK), according to the agreement we made in 2009”.[note: 20] (c)     email from RDN where he described LLW as the largest shareholder of ACDN: (i)       a series of email from RDN to LLW in which RDN described LLW as the largest shareholder of ACDN[note: 21] (ii)       an email from RDN to Thanakorn, Operation Manager of ACDN, dated 28 June 2010 where RDN stated “Daniel is the largest holder (90%) of ACDN” and “I personally has no shares in ... ACDN”.[note: 22] (iii)       an email from RDN to Michael Heng dated 28 June 2010 in respect of unpaid invoices for services rendered to ACDN and TQ Global Pte Ltd where RDN informed Michael Heng “The companies that you handling is all belong to Daniel.”[note: 23] (iv)       email from RDN to Clara Pei San Tan of DBS Bank dated 28 June 2010 regarding the redemption of ACDN loans with DBS where he stated “... Daniel own 90% of the company ...”[note: 24] (d)     an email from RDN to the Ministry of Manpower dated 6 September 2010 regarding the unpaid salaries and Central Provident Fund payments of ACDN’s employees, RDN stated that “Mr Daniel Liew is 90% share holder” and that he (RDN) did not own any shares in the company.[note: 25] The email referred to in (b) identified the beneficiary of the shares as TQ-Global (HK) rather than RDN, and the email referred to in (c) that stated that LLW was the largest shareholder of ACDN were inconsistent with RDN’s position in the present proceedings that LLW holds 97,650,000 shares in ACDN on trust for him. 17     RDN referred to the email in his affidavit. His explanation for the email of 22 November 2010 to LLW was: I had initially wanted Daniel Liew to hold ACDN shares on trust for TQ-HK. However, I subsequently changed my mind and had Daniel hold ACDN shares on trust for me instead. When I wrote the e-mail on 22 November 2010, I was confused as to whether Daniel Liew was holding onto ACDN shares on trust for TQ-HK or me”.[note: 26] and with regard to the other email, RDN stated that: Nowhere in the e-mails did I say that I had no beneficial interest in ACDN shares. The e-mails did not in any way derogate from the fact that Daniel Liew held the beneficial interest in ACDN shares on trust for me.[note: 27] 18     The email showed RDN in an unfavourable light. He was unsure over the beneficiary of the Shares, and he was being economical with the truth when he presented LLW as having a substantial interest in ACDN and did not disclose his own beneficial interest in the Shares and in ACDN when it suited his purpose. Nevertheless, the email did not diminish the force of the evidence in the contemporaneous records on the nature of the Shares which BN transferred to LLW.",
        "Issue 3": "19     The Written Submissions of LLW referred to s 7(2) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43 1999 Rev Ed) which states that: A disposition of an equitable interest or trust subsisting at the time of the disposition must be in writing signed by the person disposing of the same or by his agent lawfully authorised in writing or by will. and stated that “It is crystal clear that the Plaintiff did not have the disposition in writing and neither was it signed by him or his agent.”[note: 28] 20     Section 7(2) requires that a person who makes a disposition of an equitable interest or trust must do that in writing signed by him or his agent. On the facts, it was BN who vested the equitable/beneficial interest in the Shares in RDN when he declared that he held the Shares on trust for RDN. In respect of 90,000,000 of the 97,650,000 shares in question, BN had executed a trust document on 24 June 2008 in favour of RDN.[note: 29]As for the balance of 7,650,000 shares, RDN and BN had exchanged email on the trust document for these Shares. On 8 December 2010, RDN asked BN if he had the trust document for the 7,650,000 shares and BN replied that he did not have a copy of it, and that the document was kept in ACDN or with the company secretary.[note: 30]When BN gave evidence in court, he stated that he might have signed a trust document for the Shares[note: 31]but he was not sure about that. On the basis of the trust document and the evidence, LLW accepted that BN had agreed to, and did, hold the Shares in ACDN on trust for RDN.[note: 32]That being the case, there is no issue over s 7(2).",
        "Issue 4": "21     In para 23 of his affidavit, LLW deposed that: By 2 letters dated 24 September 2009, the Company received a S$300,000 LEFS Bridging Loan Programme ... and a S$500,000 Non-Revolving Hire Purchase Line ... from DBS Bank Ltd. It was a pre-requisite that only companies in Singapore that are locally-owned, with at least 30% local equity, can apply for a loan under the LEFS. LLW exhibited a letter of offer dated 24 September 2009[note: 33]from DBS Bank to ACDN for the bridging loan on the condition that: At all times, you shall have a minimum thirty per cent (30%) active participation and ownership, save in the event that SPRING Singapore’s prior approval is obtained. 22     LLW submitted that: Even if this Honourable Court finds that the 1stDefendant was holding the Shares on trust for the Plaintiff, such trust would be rendered invalid because the Plaintiff intended to cheat SPRING Singapore and DBS Bank Ltd into believing that the 2ndDefendant was at least 30% locally owned in order to obtain a loan from DBS Bank Ltd.[note: 34] without presenting any evidence from DBS Bank on whether the fact that the Shares were held on trust for RDN, who is not a Singapore national, disentitled ACDN from obtaining the bridging loan. 23     LLW also referred to the statement in para 11.109 ofWalter Woon on Company Law, Revised Third Ed (Sweet & Maxwell) (“Company Law”) that: Where shares are registered in the name of a nominee for an illegal purpose or in order to defraud a public authority, the owner may be precluded from asserting his beneficial ownership of the shares” and to the decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal inSuntoso Jacob v Kong Miao Ming[1983 – 1984] SLR(R) 458 and [1985 – 1986] SLR(R) 524 respectively (“Suntoso Jacob”) as support for his contention that even if there was a trust, the Shares were not recoverable because it was an illegal trust set up to obtain the loan from DBS Bank. 24     RDN denied that the loan was improperly obtained. He deposed that[note: 35]: Daniel Liew claims that he applied for loans under LEFS because he believed that he owned shares in ACDN and that ACDN was considered “locally-owned” as a result. The truth of the matter was that Daniel Liew had told me that he was familiar with and had experience in applying for loans under LEFS. He also mentioned LEFS would not look beyond the nationality of the registered shareholders as shown by ACRA searches and it did not matter if he held ACDN shares on trust for me. [emphasis in original] LLW did not respond to RDN’s averment, and his counsel did not cross-examine RDN on it. 25     In the examination of this issue, there was one critical omission – LLW did not call any witness or adduce any evidence from DBS Bank to attest that it would not have extended the bridging loan to ACDN if it had known that LLW was holding the Shares on trust for RDN. InSuntoso Jacob, the plaintiff, an Indonesia national, transferred shares in a company to a Singapore national to enable a tugboat owned by the company to be registered under the Singapore flag. An Assistant Registrar of Singapore Ships gave evidence that the Registrar of Singapore Ships had been deceived into allowing the tugboat to be registered in Singapore. 26     In the present case LLW should have adduced evidence that DBS Bank was deceived into making the loan. In the absence of such evidence and the absence of a response to RDN’s assertion that the bank would only look at the nationality of the registered shareholders, LLW had not proved that there was an intention to deceive DBS Bank, or that DBS Bank was deceived. Furthermore, even if the non-disclosure of the trust deceived DBS Bank, that would not prevent RDN from asserting his beneficial ownership of the Shares under the rule stated inCompany Lawunless DBS Bank is a public authority, and while DBS Bank is a large and reputable commercial bank, it is not a public authority.",
        "Conclusion": "27     I find that the Shares were transferred to LLW to be held by him as trustee, and that the issues raised by LLW did not defeat RDN’s right to have the Shares transferred to him. 28     Judgement is entered in favour of RDN, with costs against LLW to be taxed if there is no agreement thereon. There will be no order as to costs in respect of ACDN.
