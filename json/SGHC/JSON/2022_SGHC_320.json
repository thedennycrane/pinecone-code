The plaintiff brings a claim in proprietary estoppel for the Deceased’s HDB flat and for monies in the Deceased’s bank accounts. The defendants bring a counterclaim in unjust enrichment for monies in the Deceased’s bank account, which they allege had been withdrawn and transferred to the plaintiff without the necessary authorisation by the administrator of the Deceased’s estate.",

        "Passing of the Deceased": "6 The Deceased was involved in a traffic accident on the night of 30 July 2019. He was brought to hospital. His sisters, Malaveli d/o Jaganathan (“Ms Malaveli”) and Maanvili d/o Jaganathan (“Ms Maanvili”) were informed of the accident on around 10pm the same night. Ms Malaveli, Ms Maanvili, the Deceased’s friend, K P Luthesamy (“Mr Luthesamy”) and Mr Luthesamy’s wife arrived at the hospital at 11.00pm.

        "The plaintiff’s case": "9 Mdm Rasalingam seeks a declaration that she is entitled to the Tanjong Pagar flat or the sale proceeds thereof, and a declaration that she is entitled to all other assets of the Deceased (the “Other Assets”) at the time of his death. In the alternative, she seeks for damages to be assessed.14Foot Note 14×SOC at para 14. 10 Mdm Rasalingam’s claims to both the Tanjong Pagar Flat and the Other Assets are founded on the doctrine of proprietary estoppel. Her position is that after the Deceased’s divorce was finalised, he invited her, Ms Maanvili and Ms Malaveli to move into the Tanjong Pagar flat and reside with him.15Foot Note 15×SOC at para 8.Since mid-2005, the Deceased had repeatedly represented to Mdm Rasalingam that he would give the flat or any proceeds from the sale of the flat to her if he should pre-decease her.16Foot Note 16×SOC at para 9.In reliance on the Deceased’s representations, Mdm Rasalingam treated the Tanjong Pagar Flat as her home, expended money to renovate and improve the flat, looked after the Deceased, handled household chores and paid for household expenses.17Foot Note 17×SOC at para 10.Mdm Rasalingam hence avers that as she had relied and acted on the Deceased’s representations, it would be unconscionable for her to be deprived of the flat.18Foot Note 18×SOC at para 11. 11 As for the Other Assets, Mdm Rasalingam’s position is that the Deceased had also repeatedly represented to her from on or around mid-2005 that he would give the Other Assets to her should he pre-decease her.19Foot Note 19×SOC at para 12.In reliance on these representations, Mdm Rasalingam expended money on household expenses and buying groceries for the Deceased and on renovating and improving the flat, such that it would be unconscionable for her to be deprived of the Other Assets.20Foot Note 20×SOC at paras 13–14.",
        "The defendants’ case": "12 The defendants deny that any representations were made regarding the Tanjong Pagar flat or the Other Assets.21Foot Note 21×DCC at paras 10 and 13.They also aver that even if the representations had been made to Mdm Rasalingam, her daughters or Mr Luthesamy, Mdm Rasalingam had not suffered any detrimental reliance in respect of these representations.22Foot Note 22×DCC at paras 11–12 and 14. 13 The defendants’ position is that as the Deceased had died intestate, Mr Shankar is the sole beneficiary of the Deceased’s estate by operation of the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146, 2013 Rev Ed) (“Intestate Succession Act”).23Foot Note 23×DCC at para 18. 14 The defendants also aver that at the time of the Deceased’s passing, there was S$120,822.36 in his POSB account and S$55,514.51 in his OCBC account. On or about September or October 2020, Ms Shankar discovered that there was only S$1,762.28 in the POSB account and S$466.50 in the OCBC account.24Foot Note 24×DCC at para 21.The defendants plead that Mdm Rasalingam or her daughters had made withdrawals of monies (the “Withdrawals”) from the POSB account and the OCBC account, which had not been authorised by Mr Shankar in his capacity as Administrator of the Deceased’s estate. As a result, Mdm Rasalingam has been unjustly enriched by the Withdrawals.25Foot Note 25×DCC at paras 22–24. 15 The defendants hence bring a counterclaim for: (a) The sum of S$181,608.01; or (b) Alternatively, that Mdm Rasalingam account to the Deceased’s estate the sums withdrawn from the Deceased’s bank accounts from the Deceased’s passing to date; or (c) Further/alternatively, damages to be assessed.26Foot Note 26×DCC at p 10.",

        "Originating Summons 67 of 2021": "16 This suit was initially begun as an action by Originating Summons27Foot Note 27×See Originating Summons for HC/OS 67/2021 filed 25 January 2021.(“OS 67”). On 16 April 2021, the defendants applied for OS 67 to be converted to a writ.28Foot Note 28×See summons no 1756 of 2021 filed 16 April 2021.On 23 July 2021, it was ordered by consent that OS 67 be converted to a writ action.29Foot Note 29×See HC/ORC 4169/2021. 17 On 21 May 2021, the defendants applied for Mdm Rasalingam’s claim under OS 67 to be struck out.30Foot Note 30×See summons no 2371 of 2021 filed 21 May 2021.This application was granted on 24 June 2021.31Foot Note 31×See HC/ORC 3580/2021.Mdm Rasalingam appealed on 25 June 202132Foot Note 32×See Notice of Appeal for HC/RA 168/2021 filed 25 June 2021.and her appeal was allowed.33Foot Note 33×See HC/ORC 4031/2021.",
        "Injunctions in relation to the Tanjong Pagar flat": "18 An injunction was granted on 8 April 2021 pursuant to Mdm Rasalingam’s application under summons no 1533 of 2021 for the defendants to be restrained from evicting Mdm Rasalingam and her daughters or disposing of their personal effects and belongings from the Tanjong Pagar flat, pending the trial or determination of this action or until further order, with liberty to the defendants to apply to set it aside on an urgent basis.34Foot Note 34×See HC/ORC 1975/2021. 19 On 22 July 2022, the defendants applied under summons no 2731 of 2022 for the injunction under summons no 1533 of 2021 be set aside, and for an injunction for Mdm Rasalingam and her daughters to remove all their personal effects and belongings from and to vacate the Tanjong Pagar flat. The defendants also sought for the removal of a caveat lodged by Mdm Rasalingam in respect of the Tanjong Pagar flat.35Foot Note 35×See summons no 2731 of 2022 filed 22 July 2022. 20 The defendants submitted that monetary compensation would suffice if Mdm Rasalingam should succeed on her claims and that she would not be prejudiced by the orders sought for.36Foot Note 36×Defendants’ Written Submissions for summons no 2731 of 2022 dated 30 August 2022 at paras 36–37.On the other hand, the defendants would be seriously prejudiced if Mdm Rasalingam were to continue occupying the flat as she had been conducting hazardous activities at the Tanjong Pagar flat and had caused damage to the flat.37Foot Note 37×Defendants’ Written Submissions for summons no 2731 of 2022 dated 30 August 2022 at para 38.They also submitted that Mdm Rasalingam did not have a valid caveatable interest in the flat.38Foot Note 38×Defendants’ Written Submissions for summons no 2731 of 2022 dated 30 August 2022 at para 42. 21 I heard parties on this application on the first day of trial. At trial, counsel for the defendants submitted that there was a measure of urgency to this application as letters had been sent by the authorities on possible fire hazards in the flat and officers had stated that they wished to inspect the premises. As the immediate matter at hand was the possible fire hazards in the Tanjong Pagar flat, I ordered Mdm Rasalingam to be present at the premises on the dates and times that the SCDF and HDB arranged to inspect the premises. I also ordered Mdm Rasalingam to give access to the premises to the SCDF and HDB officers and to comply with all directions of the SCDF and HDB given in the course of those inspections.",
        "Change of plaintiff’s solicitors": "22 The plaintiff’s original solicitor, Mr Yeo Yao Hui, Charles,39Foot Note 39×See affidavit of Yeo Yao Hui, Charles dated 21 July 2022.left the country and became uncontactable since August 2022. Mdm Rasalingam’s present solicitor was instructed on the matter on 9 August 2022. In view of the circumstances of the case, I allowed Mdm Rasalingam’s application for an extension of time to file her affidavit of evidence-in-chief.40Foot Note 40×See summons for extension of time for summons no 2778 of 2022 filed 22 July 2022; HC/ORC 4085/2022.",
        "Issues": "23 This suit boils down to three issues: (a) Whether Mdm Rasalingam had a valid claim to the Tanjong Pagar flat. (b) Whether Mdm Rasalingam had a valid claim to the Other Assets. (c) Whether the defendants could establish that Mdm Rasalingam had been unjustly enriched by the Withdrawals from the OCBC and POSB accounts.",
        "The law on proprietary estoppel": "24 In order to establish a claim in proprietary estoppel, it must be shown that: (a) a representation or an assurance was made that the claimant would have an interest in the property, and that (b) in reliance on this representation, (c) the claimant had suffered a detriment (GeokHong Co Pte Ltd v Koh Ai Gek and others[2019] 1 SLR 908 at [94];SumoiParamesvaeri v Fleury, Jeffrey Gerard and another[2016] 5 SLR 302 (“Sumoi”) at [69];Ong ChaiKoon and others v Ong Chai Soon[2021] SGHC 76 (“Ong Chai Koon”) at [166]). On representation 25 The plaintiff must establish that the defendant had made a representation, express or implied, through words or conduct that the claimants had a share/interest in the property in question (Ong Chai Koonat [167]). There is no legal requirement for a representor to have intended for the representations to be acted upon, and purely oral promises would suffice (Letchimyd/o Palanisamy Nadasan Majeed (alias Khadijah Nadasan) v Maha Devi d/o Palanisamy Nadasan (administrator of the estate of Devi d/o Gurasamy, deceased[2021] 1 SLR 970 at [15]–[16]). Conduct, including silence, or acquiescence can amount to an implied representation. (Ong Chai Koonat [167];Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292 (“Hong Leong”) at [194] and [197]). The representee is a person to whom a representation is made whether directly or through an agent or an intermediary and includes a person to whose notice the representation was intended to and did come, such intention being express or inferred (Hong Leongat [205]). On reliance 26 There must be a sufficient link between the promise and the conduct,ie, the reliance must be on a statement which a reasonable person would have understood to be taken seriously and acted upon (Sumoiat [73], citingThornerv Major[2009] 1 WLR 776). For there to be detrimental reliance,the party must act in amanner to give effect to, or at least be related to, the representation madeOng Chai Koonat [174]).Once the claimant establishes the relevant representation and a change of position which is capable of causal relation to it, the burden shifts to the other party to establish that the claimant did not rely on the representation (Hong Leongat [208]). On detriment 27 Detriment is considered at the time when the promisor attempts to resile from his stated position and refers to the detriment or harm which would result from the change of position (Sumoiat [77]). Overarching inquiry of unconscionability 28 The overarching inquiry for proprietary estoppel is whether it would be unconscionable for the court not to raise the estoppel. This inquiry is undertaken within the framework of the above three elements. These three elements are directed at showing that something for which the defendant is responsible has caused or contributed to the plaintiff adopting a certain course of action such that it would be unconscionable to permit the defendant to act in accordance with his strict legal rights and indifferent to the plaintiff’s plight (Hong Leongat [191]–[192]). Interaction with the Intestate Succession Act 29 Preliminarily, I note that counsel for both Mdm Rasalingam and the defendants have sought to articulate the interaction between the Intestate Act and the doctrine of proprietary estoppel. Both counsel are incorrect in different ways. Counsel for the defendants submits that Mdm Rasalingam’s claims are a backdoor attempt to legitimise an oral will which would be legally invalid. This conflates the doctrine of proprietary estoppel with the issue of formality of wills. Counsel for Mdm Rasalingam in turn suggests that equity demands that her grandson is not the most fitting recipient as his entitlement springs from the “raw workings of the Law – the fearful [Intestate Succession Act] which … throws to the wind emotional and moral inklings”41Foot Note 41×PCS at para 37.and seeks to rely on the case ofR v Lucas[1981] QB 720 (“R v Lucas”). I do not see how this authority can be relevant by any stretch of the imagination asR v Lucaspertains to when a lying statement can amount to corroboration of other evidence against an accused person. Neither can the rules of equity be applied in an unprincipled fashion. 30 The correct reading is that the common law equitable remedy of proprietary estoppel cannot override the Intestate Succession Act, but a claim founded on proprietary estoppel can be a legitimate course of action against the Deceased’s estate (Letchimyd/o Palanisamy Nadasan Majeed (alias Khadijah Nadasan) v Maha Devi d/o Palanisamy Nadasan (administrator of the estate of Devi d/o Gurusamy, deceased)[2020] SGHC 132 at [13]–[14];Low Heng Leon Andy v Low Kian Beng Lawrence(administrator of the estate of Tan AhKng, deceased)[2013] 3 SLR 710 at [43]–[44]). What this means for the present dispute is that if I find that Mdm Rasalingam succeeds on any of her heads of claim, the assets or amounts granted in her favour would constitute a debt which Mr Shankar as estate administrator should settle as part of the probate process.",
        "Parties’ Submissions": "31 Counsel for Mdm Rasalingam relies on the doctrine of proprietary estoppel to submit that it would be unconscionable for Mdm Rasalingam to be denied the full benefit of the Deceased’s promise that his flat and wealth would be hers if he predeceased her.42Foot Note 42×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions (“PCS”) at para 37. 32 Counsel for the defendants contend that there was no representation, assurance or promise made43Foot Note 43×Defendants’ Closing Submissions (“DCS”) at para 56.– specifically, that the Deceased’s conduct in not making a will suggests that he did not intend to give the Tanjong Pagar flat to Mdm Rasalingam44Foot Note 44×DCS at paras 70 and 72.and that Mdm Rasalingam’s recount of the representations is sketchy and unspecific.45Foot Note 45×DCS at para 73. 33 The defendants further submit that even if there was a valid representation made by the Deceased, Mdm Rasalingam did not exhibit detrimental reliance on these representations.46Foot Note 46×DCS at para 74.Rather, her acts of looking after the Deceased, handling household chores and moving into the flat were done out of love and concern for the Deceased.47Foot Note 47×DCS at paras 84–87.Also, while Mdm Rasalingam initially suggested that she had paid monthly instalments for the flat, the flat had been fully paid up at the point of its transfer to the Deceased, the Deceased was a man of means who often paid for the groceries and it was undisputed that the Deceased had paid utility bills and town council payments.48Foot Note 48×DCS at paras 89, 93–96.As for Mdm Rasalingam’s pleaded position that she had paid S$25,000 for repairs and renovations to the flat, the defendants submit that this is unsupported by documentary evidence49Foot Note 49×DCS at para 102.and that the plaintiff’s witnesses were unable to give consistent evidence of the particulars of these renovation and repair works. They also submit that the claim of S$25,000 had been raised only after OS 67 was struck out and constituted new evidence belatedly introduced to cure deficiencies in her case.50Foot Note 50×DCS at paras 101–126.The defendants further submit that in any event, the expenditure of the S$25,000 would not constitute a detriment to Mdm Rasalingam as she would have expended it for her own and Ms Maanvili’s benefit.51Foot Note 51×DCS at paras 130–133, 143.",
        "Whether representations were made by the Deceased": "47 I am of the view that these representations regarding the Other Assets had been made. I preface my findings by saying that while Mdm Rasalingam had not given evidence of representations regarding the Other Assets in her first affidavit, I note (as stated above at [43]) that Mdm Rasalingam is uneducated, of advanced age and had gone through an unexpected change of counsel. Therefore, I would be slow to conclude from this discrepancy that no representation about the Other Assets was ever made. 48 These alleged representations are supported by the evidence of the Deceased’s conduct in hospital. To begin with, Mdm Rasalingam has successfully established that the cards and PIN numbers had been passed to Ms Maanvili when the Deceased was at the hospital. 49 The parties have differing accounts as to how the cards and PIN numbers came into the hands of Ms Maanvili. The defendants plead that the Deceased’s wallet had been passed to Mdm Rasalingam and/or Ms Maanvali for safekeeping by the police after the Deceased’s passing.67Foot Note 67×DCC at para 24(a).However, Mr Shankar had not been present at the hospital at the material time and the only documentary evidence in support of this version of events furnished by the defendants was a police report made by Mr Shankar in which he stated:68Foot Note 68×Shankar s/o Rajendran’s AEIC at pp 187–189. When my father passed away I am unsure if his belongings were given to his family. I am unsure where is his belongings at currently and I do not know who had made the withdrawals. 50 On the other hand, Mdm Rasalingam’s evidence that the PIN number was passed to one of her daughters69Foot Note 69×Transcript of 31 August 2022 p 71 ln 9.is consistent with Ms Maanvali70Foot Note 70×Transcript of 1 September 2022 p 42 ln 15 to ln 25.and Mr Luthesamy’s evidence that the Deceased had passed his bag containing his wallet and ATM card to Ms Maanvili in the hospital.71Foot Note 71×Transcript of 1 September 2022 p 76 ln 22 to p 77 ln 13.Counsel for the defendants submit that the witnesses have not been credible as Ms Maanvili and Mr Luthesamy differ in their accounts of the hospital interactions with the Deceased – specifically, whether the Deceased had gesticulated or communicated verbally. According to Ms Maanvili, the Deceased had been able to speak. Her evidence was that he had told her to take his belongings and to pass them to Mdm Rasalingam, and that he had told her his PIN number and asked her to inform Mdm Rasalingam of the number.72Foot Note 72×Transcript of 1 September 2022 p 42 ln 5 to ln 22; AEIC of Maanvili d/o Jaganathan at para 15.Mr Luthesamy’s evidence was that the Deceased had communicated by way of gesticulations.73Foot Note 73×Transcript of 1 September 2022 p 76 ln 12 to p 78 ln 14.However, as the evidence reflects that the interaction was brief, and as Mr Luthesamy’s evidence was that only Ms Maanvili had been talking to the Deceased,74Foot Note 74×Transcript of 1 September 2022 p 76 ln 4 to ln 6.I do not find this inconsistency very damaging to their account of events. I accept that the Deceased had passed the cards and communicated the PIN numbers to Ms Maanvili, and I find that this conduct reinforces Mdm Rasalingam’s case that the Deceased had represented that he wished to pass the Other Assets to her should he predecease her.",
        "Whether Mdm Rasalingam relied on the representations to her detriment": "51 However, detrimental reliance has not been made out. The same instances of detrimental reliance vis-à-vis the Tanjong Pagar flat were pleaded with regard to the Other Assets, and my reasoning is the same as above (see above at [39]–[44]). Hence, Mdm Rasalingam’s claim in proprietary estoppel also falls with respect to the Other Assets, and Mr Shankar remains the sole beneficial owner of the Other Assets.",
        "The Other Assets": "",
        "Parties’ submissions": "46 Counsel for Mdm Rasalingam again relies on the doctrine of proprietary estoppel to suggest that “all [the Deceased’s] wealth” should be Mdm Rasalingam’s should he predecease her.64Foot Note 64×PCS at paras 36–37.Counsel for the defendants in turn submit that Mdm Rasalingam failed to mention the Other Assets or her detrimental reliance on representations pertaining to the Other Assets in her first affidavit filed in support of OS 67.65Foot Note 65×DCS at paras 57–59 and 76.Neither was there any mention of her detrimental reliance on such representations in the solicitors’ letters sent prior to the commencement of OS 67. Counsel for the defendants hence suggest that there was no reliance by Mdm Rasalingam on these representations.66Foot Note 66×DCS at paras 76–83.",
        "The defendants’ counterclaim for the Withdrawals made": "52 In their counterclaim, the defendants claim for the sum of S$181,608.01, which they say was withdrawn from the Deceased’s POSB and OCBC accounts. In the alternative, they pray that Mdm Rasalingam be ordered to account for the sums withdrawn from the Deceased’s account from after the Deceased’s passing to date, and further/alternatively for damages to be assessed. The defendants’ counterclaim relies on the doctrine of unjust enrichment.75Foot Note 75×DCC at para 24. 53 I begin by stating that it is not in dispute that these withdrawals had been carried out by Ms Maanvili on Mdm Rasalingam’s instructions, and that the monies withdrawn had been transferred to Mdm Rasalingam. Mdm Rasalingam has acknowledged that she had instructed Ms Maanvili to withdraw these monies and that the monies had then been passed to her: Q Okay. Mdm Letchumee, you confirm that you instructed your daughter Maanvili to withdraw monies from the deceased’s POSB and OCBC accounts? A Yes, Your Honour. … Q No, did you use the monies that was withdrawn from the deceased’s POSB and OCBC account towards yourself? A It’s true that I withdrew from the accounts because it’s my entitlement. He gave me the entitlement. Yes, and I used it for myself. Q Okay. thank you. Okay. And just to confirm one last point. These monies were all withdrawn after the passing of your son, correct? A Yes, Your Honour.76Foot Note 76×Transcript of 31 August 2022 p 69 ln 23 to p 70 ln 7. When shown withdrawals from the OCBC account in August 2019, Mdm Rasalingam again stated that her daughter had made those withdrawals under her instructions after the Deceased’s passing.77Foot Note 77×Transcript of 31 August 2022 p 70 ln 29 to p 71 ln 4.Ms Maanvili similarly stated that her mother “was the one who told [her] to withdraw the monies” and that she had done so and passed the monies to Mdm Rasalingam accordingly.78Foot Note 78×Transcript of 1 September 2022 p 52 ln 29 to ln 30.",
        "The law on unjust enrichment": "54 To make out a cause of action in unjust enrichment, a claimant is to establish the following elements: (a) that a benefit has been received or an enrichment has accrued to the defendant; (b) that the benefit or enrichment is at the claimant’s expense; and (c) that the defendant’s enrichment is “unjust”. If the three elements are satisfied, the next question would be whether any defences can be established to the claim:Singapore Swimming Club v Koh Sin Chong Freddie[2016] 3 SLR 845 (“Singapore Swimming Club”) at [90], citingWee ChiawSek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve[2013] 3 SLR 801. Unjust enrichment focuses on the claimant’s loss or deprivation and not on the fault of the recipient. It is hence not based on a general or broad notion of unconscionability or unjustness, and claimants must demonstrate a positive reason for restitution and identify specific grounds of restitution which are legally recognised factors that make the defendant’s enrichment unjust:Singapore Swimming Clubat [92]–[93].",
        "Whether the defendants have made out their counterclaim in unjust enrichment": "55 The defendants’ counterclaim in respect of the Withdrawals is solely in unjust enrichment.79Foot Note 79×DCC at para 24.The defendants’ submissions, somewhat confusingly, make no express reference to unjust enrichment and do not cite any authorities on the law of unjust enrichment. However, as I see no reason to depart from the general rule that parties be bound by their pleadings (VNithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another[2015] 5 SLR 1422 at [38]), their submissions can only be considered within the parameters of their pleaded case in unjust enrichment. 56 As stated above at [54], it is for the defendants to identify legally recognised factors that make Mdm Rasalingam’s enrichment unjust. The defendants pleaded that: At all material times, [Mr Shankar], in his capacity as the Administrator of the Deceased’s estate, did not authorize any persons, including but not limited to, [Mdm Rasalingam] and [Mdm Rasalingam’s daughters], to withdraw monies from the Deceased’s POSB Account and/or OCBC Account.80Foot Note 80×DCC at para 23. 57 They have also pleaded that: At all material times, the withdrawals / transfers were not authorized by [Mr Shankar] and/or the Deceased (prior to his passing) nor known to [Mr Shankar]. Neither [were] the Unauthorised Withdrawals made in the benefit of [Mr Shankar], being the sole beneficiary of the Deceased’s estate.81Foot Note 81×DCC at para 24(c). 58 The defendants rely on their assertion that the Withdrawals were made without Mr Shankar’s authorisation. InEsbenFinance Ltd and others v Wong Hou-Lianq Neil[2022] 1 SLR 136 (“EsbenFinance”), the Court of Appeal considered the question of whether the lack of consent, in and of itself, can be considered an unjust factor. It held (at [251]–[252]) that: 251 To summarise our views on whether lack of consent ought to be recognised as an unjust factor justifying restitution on the basis of unjust enrichment: (a) There is in principleno reasonwhy lack of consent ought not to be recognised as an unjust factor because to hold otherwise would result in defendants who have received stolen property or value benefitting from a windfall. (b) However, the recognition of lack of consent as an unjust factor cannot be blanket and uncircumscribed because to do so would result in unacceptable encroachments on other areas of law, denuding them of their legal significance. In addition,legallyvalidtransfers of the claimant’s property or value without his consent, or theretention by the defendantof the claimant’s property or value to which the defendant islegally entitledcannot be said to have been unjust. (c) Thus, an unjust enrichment action on the basis of the unjust factor of lack of consent wouldgenerally notbe available where: (i) The transfer of the property or value in question from the claimant is alegally validone; (ii) The defendant islegally entitled(under a legal principle, rule or defence toanyclaim) to retain the property or value which is the subject-matter of the claim; and (iii) Where the claimant has any other available cause of action for recovery of the property or value in question under established areas of law (for example, the vindication of property rights). This follows from the need to prevent unjust enrichment from encroaching on or making otiose established areas of the law or denuding them of much of their legal significance. 252 The principles set out above are sufficient to dispose of the present case and we need not go further than this for the purposes of this judgment. We stress that the law of unjust enrichment ought to be developedincrementallyon a case-by-case basis and we thus leave the issues of whether there may be lack of consent situations in which a claim in unjust enrichment ought to be allowed, and whether there areotherlimits to recognising novel unjust factors, for a future appropriate case, as it is unnecessary for us to decide these points. [emphasis in original] 59 InEsbenFinance, the appellants were offshore companies which were principally managed by one Mr Wong Kie Nai. The respondent was his son. Upon Mr Wong Kie Nai’s death, effective control of the appellants passed to his brothers. One of Mr Wong Kie Nai’s brothers noticed that the appellants’ bank accounts were lower than expected and discovered that 50 payments had been made from these accounts to the respondent’s personal bank account. The appellants sued the respondent to recover these 50 payments on the basis of unjust enrichment, dishonest assistance, knowing receipt and unlawful means conspiracy. For 36 of the payments, the monies used for the payments stemmed from a practice of coordinated transactions to evade taxes in Malaysia. The court held that if moneys are transferred from an entity to an intermediary with the purpose of having the intermediary channel these monies onto an eventual receiver, there would be no subtraction from the intermediary’s assets and any enrichment received by the receiver would not be at the intermediary’s expense. As the role played by the appellants in the practice of coordinated transactions was akin to that played of such an intermediary, the moneys for these 36 payments could not be regarded as the appellants’ assets. Rather, both the making of the payments and the wherewithal for making these payments stemmed from the practice itself. Therefore, the respondent had not been enriched at the appellants’ expense by the 36 payments (at [154]–[155]). The remaining 14 payments were found to have been unauthorised, but as the appellants retained property to the monies, they had a proprietary claim for the monies which precluded the recognition of an unjust enrichment claim on the same facts (at [253]). 60 Turning to the present case, I do not think the defendants have successfully established a lack of consent. Indeed, the evidence is that the Withdrawals were done in accordance with the Deceased’s express wishes, even though the money was only withdrawn after his death. Although Mr Shankar did not authorise it, at the time the monies were withdrawn, he was not yet appointed the Administrator and therefore not in a position to grant or withhold consent. I do not think that the circumstances of this case justify a finding that Mdm Rasalingam had been unjustly enriched. I therefore dismiss the defendants’ counterclaim.",
        "Conclusion": "61 In summary, I find that Mdm Rasalingam has been unsuccessful in her claim for the Tanjong Pagar flat, and that the defendants have also been unsuccessful in their counterclaim for the S$181,608.01 withdrawn from the Deceased’s bank accounts. 62 I will hear parties on costs. Lee Seiu KinJudge of the High Court Rajwin Singh Sandhu (Rajwin & Yong LLP) (instructed) (S K Kumar Law Practice LLP) for the plaintiff; Wang Liansheng and Valerie Goh (Bih Li & Lee LLP) for the defendants."
