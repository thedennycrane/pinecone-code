        "Introduction": "1       The two applications before me are brought under\n                    s 310 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”)\n                    for the court to determine questions arising out of the winding up of MF Global\n                    Singapore Pte Ltd (“MFGS”). Originating Summons No 289 of 2013\n                    (“OS 289”) was commenced by MFGS and the joint and several\n                    liquidators, Mr Chay Fook Yuen, Mr Bob Yap Cheng Ghee (“Mr Yap”)\n                    and Mr Tay Puay Cheng (collectively, “the Liquidators”), against\n                    Vintage Bullion DMCC (“Vintage”) in its own capacity and as\n                    representative of 57 other customers of MFGS (collectively, “the LFX and\n                    Bullion customers”). As Vintage disagreed with the Liquidators’\n                    framing of the issues in OS 289, Vintage lodged Originating Summons No 578 of\n                    2013 (“OS 578”) in its own capacity against MFGS. 2       Essentially, the central issues in both OS 289\n                    and OS 578 are the same, and concern the treatment of certain forms of profits\n                    made by the LFX and Bullion customers under leveraged foreign exchange\n                    (“LFX transactions”) and leveraged commodity transactions\n                    (“Bullion transactions”) conducted by MFGS. In relation to these\n                    forms of profits, Vintage asserts proprietary claims, while MFGS argues that\n                    Vintage only has unsecured claims. In the latter scenario, the LFX and Bullion\n                    customers would stand as unsecured creditors, and would have to prove these\n                    unsecured debts in MFGS’ winding up. Parties thus agreed for both\n                    applications to be heard at the same time. 3       While Vintage was appointed, pursuant to an\n                    order of court dated 16 July 2013 in OS 289, to represent the LFX and Bullion\n                    customers who have claims for these forms of profits arising out of LFX and\n                    Bullion transactions, the order provided that Vintage was “not required\n                    to keep any [of the other customers] informed of these proceedings or to advance\n                    an argument or to take any instructions from any of them”. For the\n                    avoidance of doubt, any decision made in respect of Vintage in this judgment\n                    will apply equally to the LFX and Bullion customers who have equivalent claims\n                    against MFGS.",
        "Facts": "",
        "MFGS and its model of business": "4       I now set out the facts (with key terms\n                    highlighted in bold italics). MFGS was, at all material times, a member and\n                    clearing member of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited, the\n                    Singapore Exchange Derivatives Trading Limited, and the Singapore Exchange\n                    Derivatives Clearing Limited. MFGS was also a holder of a Capital Markets\n                    Services licence (“CMS licence”), issued by the Monetary Authority\n                    of Singapore (“MAS”), authorised to carry out the following\n                    regulated activities under the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed)\n                    (“SFA”): (a)     dealing in\n                    securities; (b)     trading\n                        in futures contracts; (c)     leveraged foreign exchange trading; (d)     securities financing; and (e)     providing custodial services for\n                        securities. 5       In the ordinary course of business, MFGS offered\n                    a range of over-the-counter LFX and Bullion products which included: (a)     cash-settled over-the-counter LFX\n                        spot contracts; (b)     cash-settled over-the-counter LFX forward contracts; (c)     cash-settled over-the-counter LFX\n                        non-deliverable forward contracts; (d)     over-the-counter LFX option contracts;\n                    and (e)     cash-settled\n                        over-the-counter Bullion spot contracts. 6       The above over-the-counter products were not\n                    traded on any exchange, and involved transactions where the investor would buy\n                    or sell currencies or commodities in a bid to profit from fluctuations in\n                    exchange rates between two different currencies, or fluctuations in the prices\n                    of commodities without physical delivery of the currencies or commodities\n                    involved. 7       For the purpose of facilitating trades in LFX or\n                    Bullion transactions, customers were required to open and maintain accounts with\n                    MFGS. The relationships between the LFX and Bullion customers and MFGS and the\n                    trades were governed by the terms and conditions set out in the account opening\n                    form and the Master Trading Agreement (“MTA”), which also enclosed\n                    a risk disclosure statement (“the Risk Disclosure\n                    Statement”). 8       Once the accounts were opened, customers would\n                    typically place with MFGS funds necessary to enable trades to be executed and to\n                    maintain open positions on the trades by way of “margin”. The bulk\n                    of MFGS’ customers traded on margin (ie,\n                    trading by placing a certain percentage of the value of the position concerned\n                    with MFGS). The margin required varied depending on the requirements for trading\n                    in the product concerned. 9       MFGS operated a 24-hour dealing and service desk\n                    for customers who traded in LFX and Bullion products. Customers could either\n                    trade directly with MFGS by calling MFGS’ desk dealers or by utilising an\n                    online platform. An order could be placed with MFGS via either platform so long\n                    as a customer had sufficient margin to enter into the transaction. If the\n                    customer did not meet MFGS’ margin requirements, MFGS would require the\n                    customer to satisfy the margin requirements before entering into an LFX or\n                    Bullion transaction. 10     In respect of the LFX and Bullion\n                    transactions, MFGS did not act as its customers’ agent. Instead, a\n                    customer concluded an LFX or Bullion transaction directly with MFGS which acted\n                    as principal on its own behalf. In other words, MFGS was the direct counterparty\n                    to any LFX or Bullion transaction which a customer entered into. 11     To hedge its own exposure, MFGS engaged in\n                    hedge transactions with hedge counterparties, being the Union Bank of\n                    Switzerland (“UBS”) in respect of the LFX transactions, and\n                    Deutsche Bank (“DB”) in respect of the Bullion transactions. MFGS\n                    funded these transactions with its own funds. 12     The margins placed by customers were deposited\n                    into MFGS’ bank accounts which MFGS classified as “Customer Segregated Accounts”. The funds placed\n                    in these accounts were segregated from MFGS’ own funds, although MFGS\n                    maintained some of its own funds in these accounts. According to the\n                    Liquidators, the LFX and Bullion customers’ margins were not onward-placed\n                    with any other party, or otherwise utilised by MFGS for the purposes of\n                    MFGS’ hedge transactions. Although MFGS maintained a number of Customer\n                    Segregated Accounts, MFGS did not open a separate bank account for each\n                    customer. MFGS, however, accounted distinctly for each customer’s funds in\n                    the Customer Segregated Accounts.",
        "The LFX and Bullion transactions, the “Daily FX Activity\n                Statements” and the “Seg Fund Statements”": "13     MFGS employed a back-office operations system\n                    to record the daily LFX and Bullion trade activity for each customer. Daily\n                    statements of the accounts of the customers (“Daily\n                        FX Activity Statements”) were also produced by the system.\n                    As a day-to-day chronicle of the relationship between MFGS and a particular\n                    customer, the relevant Daily FX Activity Statements are crucial pieces of\n                    documentary evidence presented by the parties. 14     Basically, a Daily FX Activity Statement\n                    contained,inter alia, the following sections: (i)\n                    the “Trade Confirmation” section; (ii) the “Forward\n                    Liquidation” section; (iii) the “Open Positions” section;\n                    and (iv) the “Financial Statement” section. In the ordinary course\n                    of business, an LFX or Bullion transaction between MFGS and its customer would\n                    occur as described below, and would be recorded in the Daily FX Activity\n                    Statements as follows: (a)     The customer would initiate a\n                        position by entering into an initial trade. MFGS would issue a trade\n                        confirmation under the “Trade Confirmation” section to its\n                        customer in the Daily FX Activity Statement for that particular\n                    day. (b)     The\n                        transaction was thereafter treated as continuing to remain open until a\n                        final trade was entered into. In such a case, the customer would be said to\n                        have an “open position”. These open positions would be\n                        reflected under the “Open Positions” section of the Daily FX\n                        Activity Statement. (c)     While a position remained open, the “paper” (ie, notional) value of the open position would be\n                        determined with reference to the market price of either the underlying\n                        currency or reference bullion (“the daily settlement prices”)\n                        in respect of the LFX and Bullion transactions respectively (ie, the transactions were marked to the market). If\n                        the movement of the underlying currency or reference bullion favoured the\n                        customer, the customer would have unrealised profits. However, if it did\n                        not, the customer would incur unrealised losses. The “Unrealised Profits” or “Unrealised\n                        Losses” would be reflected in the “Financial Statement”\n                        section of the Daily FX Activity Statement. (d)     If a customer was not able to meet MFGS’\n                        margin requirements, MFGS was entitled, by cl E4 of the MTA, to issue a\n                        “margin call”,ie, to require a\n                        customer to deposit with MFGS additional margins in order for the position\n                        to be maintained. I will discuss the way MFGS calculated a customer’s\n                        margin requirements at item (j) below. (e)     While the position remained open, the cost of keeping the\n                        position open was debited from or credited to the customer based on the\n                        total value of the contract. In respect of the LFX transactions, this cost\n                        was known as “forex swap”, and in respect of the Bullion\n                        transactions, this was termed “spot\n                    interest”. (f)     When a final trade was entered into, this was known as\n                        “closing” the position. When the position was closed, MFGS\n                        would issue a trade confirmation under the “Trade\n                        Confirmation” section. The trade confirmation would state the price\n                        of the trade, as well as a “Value\n                        Date”, which is defined in the MTA as “the date on\n                        which the respective obligations of the parties to a foreign exchange or\n                        [over-the-counter] transaction are to be performed”. Generally,\n                        though not always, the Value Date would be two days after closing a\n                        position. The closure of the position at a profit to the customer also gave\n                        rise to a sum which would be reflected in the “Financial\n                        Statement” section as “Forward\n                            Value”. The specific transactions which had been\n                        closed out would also be reflected under the “Forward\n                        Liquidation” section. (g)     On the Value Date, the sum previously reflected under\n                        Forward Value (with that particular Value Date) would be credited to a\n                        customer’s running account with MFGS as “Liquidation\n                        Profit” and be added to the sum reflected under “Ledger Balance C/F” (where C/F stands for\n                        “carried forward”) under the “Financial\n                        Statement” section of that day’s Daily FX Activity Statement.\n                        In other words, Forward Value with a Value Date “Z” would be\n                        shown to have been credited to the Ledger Balance C/F in the Daily FX\n                        Activity Statement dated “Z”. (h)     The aggregate sum of the Unrealised Profits,\n                        Forward Value and Ledger Balance C/F would be reflected in the\n                        “Financial Statement” section as “Total Account Equity”. (i)     When customers wished to withdraw their realised\n                        profits represented under the Ledger Balance C/F, MFGS would then effect\n                        physical payment to the customers from the Customer Segregated\n                        Accounts. (j)     A\n                        separate portion of the “Financial Statement” section deals\n                        with a customer’s margin requirements. This portion sets out the\n                        “Initial Margin Requirement” and “Margin\n                        Excess/Deficiency”. The Initial Margin Requirement represents the\n                        funds or value initially required to maintain an open position. The Margin\n                        Excess/Deficiency represents the difference between a customer’s Total\n                        Account Equity and the Initial Margin Requirement as reflected in the same\n                        statement. MFGS would only issue a margin call to its customer when a Margin\n                        Deficiency is incurred. 15     At all material times, MFGS ensured that there\n                    were sufficient moneys parked in the Customer Segregated Accounts to cover the\n                    Total Account Equity of all the LFX and Bullion customers, whichinter alia, included the three forms of profits:\n                    Unrealised Profits, Forward Value and Ledger Balance C/F. The primary dispute\n                    between the Liquidators and Vintage is whether the sums representing the\n                    Unrealised Profits and Forward Value in the Customer Segregated Accounts belong\n                    beneficially to (and therefore are the property of) the LFX and Bullion\n                    customers, or whether they are instead MFGS’ own moneys, available for\n                    distribution to MFGS’ unsecured creditors, including the LFX and Bullion\n                    customers, on apari passubasis, in MFGS’\n                    winding up. 16     During the ordinary course of business, MFGS\n                    also submitted a statement of assets and liabilities in the prescribed form\n                    under reg 27(1)(a), (3)(a), (9)(b) and (9)(e) of the Securities and Futures (Financial and Margin\n                    Requirements for Holders of Capital Markets Services Licences) Regulations (Cap\n                    289, Rg 13, 2004 Rev Ed) (“SF(FM)R”) on a quarterly basis to MAS.\n                    This form included a document with the heading “Segregation Requirements\n                    and Location of Segregated Funds” (“the Seg\n                        Fund Statement”). MFGS updated the Seg Fund Statement\n                    daily. The Seg Fund Statement is another key piece of documentary evidence\n                    referred to by the parties, and I shall describe this in more detail in due\n                    course.",
        "Vintage’s relationship with MFGS": "17     On 21 August 2006, Vintage opened an account\n                    with MFGS, and engaged in,inter alia, LFX and\n                    Bullion transactions through this account. Prior to 1 November 2011, being the\n                    date MFGS entered into provisional liquidation, Vintage closed out all its open\n                    positions in its LFX and Bullion transactions. In particular, Vintage liquidated\n                    121 lots of silver on 28 October 2011, and a further 241 lots of silver on 31\n                    October 2011.

        "The winding up of MFGS and Originating Summons No 22 of\n                2012": "20     On 31 October 2011, MFGS’ ultimate\n                    parent company, MF Global Holdings Ltd, filed a voluntary petition for relief\n                    under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States\n                    Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.

A\n                    creditors’ meeting was also held on that day where the creditors resolved,\n                    amongst other matters, to confirm the appointment of the\n                Liquidators.",
        "The present applications": "25     On 23 April 2012, Vintage received payment of\n                    the sum of US$5,137,229.93 as part of the interim distribution made by the\n                    Liquidators. This sum included amounts attributable to the LFX and Bullion\n                    transactions, as well as amounts from other futures and options transactions.\n                    Vintage was of the view that it had been underpaid. It transpired that parties\n                    took a different view of how the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value arising\n                    from the LFX and Bullion transactions should be treated as a matter of law. OS\n                    289 and OS 578 were thus taken out by the Liquidators and Vintage respectively\n                    in order to determine this and other issues. The Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value in dispute amount to about US$13.4m for all the LFX and Bullion customers.\n                    It should be noted that Vintage is claiming its Forward Valueonly, a substantial portion of which is attributable to its\n                    Bullion transactions. As of 31 October 2011, Vintage did not have any Unrealised\n                    Profits.",
        "Summary of the parties’ cases": "",
        "The Liquidators’ case": "26     According to counsel for the Liquidators, Mr\n                    Andre Yeap SC (“Mr Yeap”), given that MFGS acted as principal to\n                    the LFX and Bullion customers, the Unrealised Profits constituted only mere\n                    uncrystallised contingent debt obligations that were not yet due and payable,\n                    and the Forward Value constituted a debt payable only on the future Value Date.\n                    Hence, the LFX and Bullion customers only had choses in action against MFGS in\n                    respect of the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value. A chose in action could not\n                    be converted into trust property which MFGS holds as a “trustee”\n                    for a customer. Furthermore, even if it could be said that a\n                    “trust” over a chose was possible, it would not have been a trust\n                    over actual physical moneys, particularly since such moneys had not been paid,\n                    and were in fact not yet due and payable. 27     As stated above, MFGS maintained sums\n                    equivalent to the aggregate of the LFX and Bullion customers’ Unrealised\n                    Profits, Forward Value and Ledger Balance C/F in the Customer Segregated\n                    Accounts. However, according to the Liquidators, only the Ledger Balance C/F is\n                    held on trust for its customers, while the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value\n                    formed MFGS’ “residual financial\n                        interest” in the Customer Segregated Accounts. On the\n                    Value Date of a particular transaction, the Forward Value would be paid by MFGS\n                    into a customer’s Ledger Balance C/F from this “residual financial\n                    interest”. It was only after this payment on the Value Date that MFGS\n                    would hold the amount on trust for the customer. Indeed, the interim\n                    distribution under OS 22 was made on this basis. 28     Specifically, the Liquidators take the view\n                    that the statutory trust under the relevant legislation does not capture the\n                    Unrealised Profits and Forward Value of the LFX transactions. As for the Bullion\n                    transactions, the Liquidators argue that the specific provisions under the\n                    relevant legislation apply only when a commodity broker acts as agent for and on\n                    behalf of a customer. As MFGS did not act as agent for the Bullion customers,\n                    MFGS was not required to segregate any moneys, or hold any moneys on trust.\n                    However, the Liquidators’ position is that MFGS voluntarily held a\n                    customer’s Ledger Balance C/F attributable to Bullion transactions on\n                    trust. 29     The Liquidators also submit that no express\n                    trust was created over the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value. MFGS did not\n                    behave in a manner that evinced a clear intention to hold the Unrealised Profits\n                    or Forward Value on express trust for the LFX and Bullion\n                customers. 30     Against Vintage’s argument that the LFX\n                    and Bullion customers’ proprietary entitlement to the Ledger Balance C/F\n                    should be determined on the basis of the Daily FX Activity Statement dated 1\n                    November 2011, the Liquidators submit that due to the appointment of provisional\n                    liquidators on 1 November 2011, MFGS did not and could not pay the Forward Value\n                    into MFGS’ Customer Segregated Accounts after the close of business on 31\n                    October 2011. As payments in the ordinary course of MFGS’ business was\n                    made at the close of business on a particular Value Date, the last payment MFGS\n                    made (and could have made) to the account and credit of customers prior to the\n                    appointment of provisional liquidators was at MFGS’ close of business on\n                    31 October 2011, which was 5.00pm New York Time on 31 October 2011 (ie, 5.00am Singapore time on 1 November 2011) before\n                    MFGS went into provisional liquidation. Thus, the extent of a customer’s\n                    proprietary entitlement should be limited to the Ledger Balance C/F reflected in\n                    the 31 October 2011 Daily FX Activity Statement.",
        "Vintage’s case": "31     Vintage’s primary case is that a\n                    statutory trust arose over the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value as a result\n                    of the relevant legislation applicable to the LFX and Bullion transactions\n                    respectively. 32     Alternatively, even if MFGS was not obliged by\n                    the relevant legislation to hold the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value on\n                    trust for Vintage and the other LFX and Bullion customers,in\n                        actual fact, MFGS segregated moneys covering the value of the\n                    Unrealised Profits and Forward Value, and held these moneys on trust.\n                    Accordingly, a trust by conduct arose. 33     Further, Vintage’s argument is that even\n                    if MFGS was only required to hold the Ledger Balance C/F on trust for the LFX\n                    and Bullion customers, then these customers have a proprietary interest in the\n                    Ledger Balance C/F as reflected in the Daily FX Activity Statement dated 1\n                    November 2011, and not of that dated 31 October 2011. Effectively, this means a\n                    difference of about US$6m in Vintage’s favour. Vintage’s last\n                    argument is that the LFX and Bullion customers are entitled to amounts reflected\n                    as Margin Excess in the Daily FX Activity Statement. 34     On the last day of the hearing before me, Mr\n                    Thio Shen Yi SC (“Mr Thio”), counsel for Vintage, also submitted\n                    that a number of Mr Yap’s affidavits, as well as an LFX and Bullion Report\n                    prepared by the Liquidators for OS 298 and OS 578 (“the LFX and Bullion\n                    Report”) contained matters that were inadmissible for being in breach of\n                    O 41 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of\n                    Court”).",
        "Issues": "35     Given the positions of the parties, there are\n                    a number of substantive issues to be considered. First, I discuss the nature of\n                    the Unrealised Profits, Forward Value and Ledger Balance C/F under the contract\n                    between MFGS and the LFX and Bullion customers (sansthe interposition of any statutory trust or express\n                    declaration of trust) (“the Preliminary Issue”). 36     Next, I will consider whether, in respect of\n                    the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value, the LFX and Bullion customers have\n                    proprietary claims by way of either a statutory or express trust, or whether\n                    they must prove their unsecured debts in the winding up of MFGS (“the\n                    Proprietary Claim issue”). To determine the Proprietary Claim issue, the\n                    following sub-issues arise: (a)     Given the nature of the Unrealised\n                        Profits and Forward Value, whether MFGS is capable of holding them on trust\n                        for the benefit of the LFX and Bullion customers. (b)     If so, whether a statutory trust\n                        arises over the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value (“the Statutory\n                        Trust issue”). (i)       In respect of the Bullion\n                            transactions, whether MFGS is obliged under the Commodity Trading Act\n                            (Cap 48A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“CTA”) and Commodity Trading\n                            Regulations 2001 (Cap 48A, S 578/2001) (“CTR”) to hold the\n                            Unrealised Profits and Forward Value on statutory trust for the Bullion\n                            customers. (ii)       In respect of the LFX transactions, whether MFGS is obliged under\n                            the SFA and Securities and Futures (Licensing and Conduct of Business)\n                            Regulations (Cap 289, Rg 10, 2004 Rev Ed) (“SFR”) to hold\n                            the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value on statutory trust for the LFX\n                            customers. (c)     If no statutory trust arises over the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                        Value, whether an express trust arises over the Unrealised Profits and/or\n                        Forward Value as a result of MFGS’ conduct or the way MFGS held or\n                        treated such moneys (“the Express Trust\n                issue”). 37     If the Proprietary Claim issue is answered in\n                    the negative, and the LFX and Bullion customers have no proprietary interest in\n                    funds representing the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value, then the issue is\n                    whether they have a proprietary interest in the Ledger Balance C/F as reflected\n                    in the Daily FX Activity Statement dated 1 November 2011, or only in the Ledger\n                    Balance C/F reflected in the Daily FX Activity Statement dated 31 October 2011\n                    (“the Value Date issue”). 38     Lastly, if the LFX and Bullion customers only\n                    have a proprietary interest in the Ledger Balance C/F reflected in the 31\n                    October 2011 Daily FX Activity Statement, are they entitled to the amounts\n                    reflected as Margin Excess in that statement (“the Margin Excess\n                    issue”)? 39     I should add that the Liquidators, in OS 289\n                    and their submissions, raised two issues which Vintage does not contest before\n                    me. These are (i) whether MFGS acted as principal or as agent/broker vis-à-vis\n                    the LFX and Bullion customers, and (ii) whether the LFX and Bullion customers\n                    have any proprietary entitlement to profits from the hedge transactions which\n                    MFGS carried out with UBS and DB. Vintage accepts that the LFX and Bullion\n                    transactions which it entered into with MFGS were conducted on a\n                    principal-to-principal basis, and that MFGS was not acting as Vintage’s\n                    agent. Vintage also does not assert any proprietary entitlement to profits from\n                    the hedge transactions MFGS entered into with UBS and DB in respect of the LFX\n                    and Bullion transactions respectively. With that, I turn to the Preliminary\n                    Issue.",

        "Parties’ submissions": "250    Vintage argues in the alternative that even\n                    if it does not have a proprietary entitlement to the Unrealised Profits and\n                    Forward Value, it has a proprietary entitlement to the sum of US$10,793,862.06\n                    reflected as its Ledger Balance C/F of the Daily FX Activity Statement dated 1\n                    November 2011, instead of the US$4,711,459.18 in the Ledger Balance C/F of its\n                    Daily FX Activity Statement dated 31 October 2011. The difference arises because\n                    a sum of US$6,082,324.50 reflected as Forward Value in the Daily FX Activity\n                    Statement dated 31 October 2011 carried a Value Date of 1 November 2011 and a\n                    further US$78.38 was to be credited to Vintage’s Ledger Balance C/F on 1\n                    November 2011 as well. 251    Essentially, this dispute relates to the\n                    time at which settlement between MFGS and its customers occurred or should have\n                    occurred. This is material to determining the appropriate quantum of\n                    Vintage’s Ledger Balance C/F to which Vintage may properly claim a\n                    proprietary entitlement. 252    To elaborate, the Liquidators’\n                    submissions are that an LFX or Bullion customer’s proprietary interest in\n                    the Ledger Balance C/F must be determined with reference to what has actually\n                    beenpaidinto his or her account before the\n                    commencement of MFGS’ winding up on 1 November 2011. MFGS only paid moneys\n                    due to customers to the Ledger Balance at the close of business every business\n                    day, and MFGS ran a 24-hour dealing and service desk with a notional close of\n                    business pegged to New York time. Based on these facts, MFGS’ notional\n                    close of business on 1 November 2011 would have in actual fact been 5.00am on 2\n                    November 2011 in Singapore and settlement of a customer’s Forward Value\n                    with a Value Date of 1 November 2011 would have occurred at 5.00am on\n                        2November 2011 in Singapore time as well. As a consequence, MFGS\n                    did not, and could not have, paid the Forward Value with a Value Date of 1\n                    November 2011 as this would have violated thepari\n                        passuprinciple, given that the payment would have been made to\n                    customers from MFGS’ own fundsafter the commencement\n                        of winding up. The last payment made by MFGS to the account and\n                    credit of the LFX and Bullion customers was therefore made on 5.00am on 1\n                    November 2011 (Singapore time), and evidenced in the Daily FX Activity Statement\n                    dated 31 October 2011. 253    Mr Yap provided the following illustration\n                    and explanation on affidavit: The fact is that, based on the Liquidators’ inquiry, MFGS’\n                        [close of business] on a particular day is at 5.00 pm (New York time) of\n                        that same calendar day (i.e. at 5.00 am (Singapore time) the following\n                        calendar day). By way of illustration, a trade entered into at 3.00 am\n                        (Singapore time) 31 October 2011 (i.e. 3.00 pm (New York time) 30 October\n                        2011) would have been recorded with having a trade date of 30 October\n                        2011. In a similar vein, Mr Yap also stated that a Daily FX Activity\n                        Statement dated a particular day would only have been prepared and issued\n                        after MFGS’ close of business of that particular day (which was based\n                        on New York time). Hence, Mr Yap deposes that: … the statements of accounts dated 1 November 2011 were\n                        automatically generated and issuedafterMFGS’ [close of business] on 1 November 2011 (i.e. the next calendar\n                        day, 2 November 2011, andafterthe\n                        appointment of provisional liquidators on 1 November 2011). [emphasis in\n                        bold italics in original] 254    In essence, the Liquidators say that a Daily\n                    FX Activity Statement reflecting a date of “X” would cover trades\n                    and transactions which occurred between 5.00am on “X” (Singapore\n                    time) and 5.00am on “X + 1” (Singapore time) (“MFGS’\n                    Business Cycle”). 255    Further, the Liquidators say that MFGS made\n                    payment of the Forward Value to the LFX and Bullion customers from its\n                    “residual financial interest” within the Customer Segregated\n                    Accounts. The evidence given by the Liquidators on the payment made by MFGS on\n                    the Value Date is that: … [P]rior to 1 November 2011, available cash balances maintained in\n                        MFGS’ accounts with UBS and DB, being MFGS’ House Funds, would\n                        from time to time on an ad-hoc basis be subject to ‘cash\n                        sweeps’. Such monies were transferred to, and were deposited in\n                        MFGS’ “customer segregated bank\n                            accounts” not as payment to customers but as addition\n                        to the then “residual financial\n                            interest” of MFGS in the “customer segregated bank accounts” of MFGS. It was\n                        from that “residual financial\n                        interest” of MFGS that specific payments would be made as\n                        and when relevant to customers in discharge of MFGS’debtobligation(s) to customers for their\n                        bi-lateral principal-to-principal transactions pursuant to MFGS’\n                        express right to do so under the relevant legislation. … [emphasis in\n                        original] 256    Vintage’s position is that it has a\n                    proprietary claim over the quantum of its Ledger Balance C/F set out in the\n                    Daily FX Activity Statement issued by MFGS dated 1 November 2011. First, Vintage\n                    cites a number of authorities to contend that the date at which MFGS went into\n                    liquidation (ie, 1 November 2011) should be used\n                    as the date to determine Vintage’s proprietary entitlement. Second,\n                    Vintage refers to certain documents which, on its argument, show that MFGS\n                    credited the Forward Value to Vintage’s account on 1 November 2011. Third,\n                    Vintage contends that the Liquidators have not adduced evidence to support their\n                    assertion that the Forward Value would be converted to Ledger Balance C/F only\n                    at the close of business in New York on 1 November 2011 (ie, 5.00am on 2 November 2011 in Singapore). The clauses in the\n                    MTA, particularly the definition of “Value Date” and\n                    “Business Day”, are against the Liquidators’ position.\n                    Lastly, Vintage submits that even if MFGS did not in fact credit the Forward\n                    Value to Vintage’s Ledger Balance C/F on 1 November 2011 (Singapore time),\n                    MFGSshouldhave done so, and accordingly, this\n                    court should hold that Vintage has a proprietary interest in the money thatshouldhave been paid to Vintage’s\n                    Ledger Balance C/F.",
        "Analysis and findings": "41     I first consider the meaning of\n                    “contingent debts”, a term which both the Liquidators and Vintage\n                    have used in their submissions. In the context of the winding up of a company, s\n                        253(1)(b) of the Companies Act provides that a\n                    “contingent or prospective creditor” may apply to court to wind up\n                    a company. Similarly, s 327(1) of the Companies Act, which sets out what debts\n                    are provable in the winding up of a company, provides that: 327.—(1) In every winding up (subject\n                        in the case of insolvent companies to the application in accordance with the\n                        provisions of this Act of the law of bankruptcy)all\n                            debts payable on a contingency, and all claims against the company,\n                            present or future, certain or contingent, ascertained or sounding only\n                            in damages, shall be admissible to proof against the company,\n                        a just estimate being made, so far as possible, of the value of such debts\n                        or claims as are subject to any contingency or sound only in damages, or for\n                        some other reason do not bear a certain value. [emphasis added] With respect to an insolvent company, the rules relating to\n                        debts provable in bankruptcy apply (see s 327(2) of the Companies Act).\n                        Under ss 87(1) and (3) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed)\n                        (“Bankruptcy Act”), any liability arising out of a contract to\n                        which a bankrupt (i) is subject at the date of the bankruptcy order or (ii)\n                        may become subject before his discharge by reason of any obligation incurred\n                        before the date of the bankruptcy order shall be provable in bankruptcy.\n                        Section 2 of the Bankruptcy Act provides that “liability”\n                        means a liability to pay money or money’s worth, irrespective of\n                        whether such liability is present or future, certain or contingent or of an\n                        amount that is fixed or liquidated or that is capable of being ascertained\n                        by fixed rules or as a matter of opinion. 42     InKon Yin Tong and another\n                        v Leow Boon Cher and others[2011] SGHC 228, Judith Prakash J set\n                    out the differences between contingent liability and prospective liability as\n                    follows (at [40]): A “contingent liability” would refer to a liability or other\n                        loss which arises out of an existing legal obligation or state of affairs,\n                        but which is dependent on the happening of an event that may or may not\n                        occur. “Prospective liability” however, has been judicially\n                        defined as “a debt which will certainly become due in the future,\n                        either on some date which has already been determined or on some date\n                        determinable by reference to future events”. It thus embraces both\n                        future debts, in the sense of liquidated sums due, and non-liquidated\n                        claims. 43     Therefore, a contingent liability or debt is\n                    one that arises out of an existing state of affairs, but is dependent on the\n                    happening of a future event which may or may not transpire. On the other hand, a\n                    prospective liability may also be understood as a debt payable in the future. In\n                    this light, the parties’ respective obligations under the MTA in respect\n                    of the LFX and Bullion transactions may be more properly\n                characterised. 44     The MTA is silent on whether specific property\n                    should be held on trust for the customer. Clause A15.1 of the MTA states: 15. TRUST ACCOUNT 15.1 MFGS shall keep all funds and other assets held by MFGS on trust for\n                        the Customer separate from the funds and assets of MFGS. The\n                        Customer’s funds and assets shall be placed into a trust account,\n                        where they may be held commingled with excess funds or assets of other\n                        Customers in accordance with Applicable Laws. As may be observed, cl A15.1 of the MTA sets out the\n                        contractual position in relation to how trust funds and assets are to be\n                        treated. However, it does not state what funds or assets are to be held on\n                        trust for the customer by MFGS. In other words, there is nocontractualdefinition of what MFGS is obliged to\n                        hold on trust for its customers. 45     In fact, in relation to a customer’s\n                    margins, cl A6.8 of the MTA provides that MFGS “shall be entitled to\n                    deposit, pledge, re-pledge or lend any funds, assets or property in any form\n                    given to MFGS by way of margin”. The clause also provides that MFGS is\n                    not required to either account to the customer for “any interest, income\n                    or benefit that may be derived from such margin” or return to the\n                    customer “identical funds, property or assets … and may return\n                    equivalent collateral or margin”. This is to be contrasted with the\n                    requirements of the CTA and SFA as to the treatment of margins, which will be\n                    discussed later. 46     In the ordinary course of MFGS’\n                    business, unrealised profits or losses arise when a customer has entered into an\n                    open position against MFGS. The terms of the MTA applicable to the LFX and\n                    Bullion transactions provide that there will be no physical settlement between\n                    MFGS and its customer unless otherwise agreed upon. The relevant provision, cl\n                    C1.1 of the MTA, states that: The Customer acknowledges that unless otherwise agreed in writing with\n                        MFGS, all Transactions shall be cash-settled, and the Customer shall not be\n                        entitled to hold any open position until its maturity or settlement date\n                        with the intention to effect physical settlement on its settlement or\n                        maturity date. Unless otherwise liquidated pursuant to the Customer’s\n                        instructions, an open position may be liquidated and cash-settled by MFGS in\n                        its sole discretion as it deems fit to prevent the crystallising of any\n                        physical settlement obligation with respect to any open position. 47     Hence, in the case of LFX and Bullion\n                    transactions, the contract between the parties requires the close-out of open\n                    positions (whether voluntarily pursuant to a customer’s instructions, or\n                    involuntarily). Until the close-out of the transaction where a customer has\n                    entered into an opposite trade, no sums are due and payable (and unless\n                    otherwise agreed, no physical settlement is contemplated) either from MFGS to\n                    the customer (where the customer makes an unrealised profit) or from the\n                    customer to MFGS (where the customer makes an unrealised loss). During this\n                    period, the quantum of profit or loss fluctuates on a daily basis as the\n                    transaction price for the position is marked to market, and indeed, what may be\n                    an unrealised profit on one day, could turn into an unrealised loss on\n                    another. 48     Thus, all that a customer has as against MFGS\n                    before he or she enters into an opposite trade, thereby crystallising the profit\n                    or loss, is acontingentdebt obligation which\n                    would be represented by the sum of Unrealised Profits, if at the time the\n                    customer is in a position of net gain as against MFGS. In order for this\n                    contingent debt to crystallise into an actual liability that MFGS owes to a\n                    customer, two events must happen, being (i) the close-out of the transaction and\n                    (ii) the movement of the currencies or commodities prices such that the customer\n                    is in a position to close-out at a net profit. 49     Upon close-out of the transaction, a\n                    customer’s profit or loss is then quantified. However, under the terms of\n                    the MTA, MFGS’ obligation to pay the quantified profit to the customer\n                    only arises on the transaction’s Value Date. Under the MTA, the Value Date\n                    is defined as “the date on which the respective obligations of the\n                    parties to a foreign exchange or [over-the-counter] transaction are to be\n                    performed”. In my view, between the close-out of the transaction and the\n                    Value Date, what the customer has (in circumstances where the customer is in a\n                    position of profit as against MFGS) is a claim against MFGS which has been\n                    quantified, but is not yet payable. In other words, this is a prospective\n                    liability, and in the framework of s 327 of the Companies Act, the Forward Value\n                    may be classified as certain future debt. Hence, while MFGS’ obligation to\n                    pay has arisen, it need not beperformeduntil the\n                    Value Date. 50     Finally, upon the Value Date arriving, the\n                    quantified profits are due and payable to the customer. The quantified profits\n                    are no longer reflected as Forward Value in the Daily FX Activity Statement of\n                    that particular Value Date, but are reflected as standing to the client’s\n                    account under the Ledger Balance C/F, and are available for withdrawal by the\n                    client subject to MFGS’ margin requirements. There is a dispute between\n                    the parties as to when on Value Date MFGS performed or should perform this\n                    payment – which will be discussed below at the Value Date issue –\n                    but this is not material here. In such a situation, I would characterise the\n                    Ledger Balance C/F as a certain present debt. A customer could require MFGS to\n                    effect immediate payment of the sum representing the Ledger Balance C/F standing\n                    to his credit in his account to him. In this regard, the legal position of a\n                    customer of MFGS with credit amounts standing to the Ledger Balance C/F would\n                    not be unlike the person who deposits money into a bank account. 51     Professor Alastair Hudson explains it as\n                    follows (Alastair Hudson,Equity and Trusts(Routledge, 8th Ed, 2015) (“Equity and\n                        Trusts”) at p 1294): A bank account is merely a chose in action: a contractual recognition by\n                        the bank that the account-holder has deposited money with it and that the\n                        bank is required to return that money to the customer in accordance with the\n                        terms of their contract. It is not true to say that there is moneyina bank account. Rather, the bank account is an\n                        acknowledgment of a claim in favour of the account-holder with a given value\n                        attached to it. [emphasis in original] 52     I should clarify though, that an account a\n                    customer had with MFGS was not entirely analogous to a bank account. The\n                    observations of Sir Andrew Park inRe Global Trader Europe\n                        Ltd (in liquidation)[2009] 2 BCLC 18 (“Re Global Trader”) are instructive. InRe Global Trader, Sir Park was also concerned with the legal\n                    analysis of transactions conducted by Global Trader and its customers. Like\n                    MFGS, Global Trader was a brokerage firm. Global Trader required its customers\n                    to open an account with the brokerage, and maintain a sufficient margin sum. It\n                    did not act as agent for its customers but was itself the counterparty to the\n                    contracts which were primarily contracts for differences and spread bet\n                    transactions. In describing the customer’s account with Global Trader, Sir\n                    Park stated (at 29–30): [The client’s account with Global Trader] was not an account\n                        analogous to a bank account. Rather it was the sort of running account which\n                        operates between regular trading counterparties and which records by how\n                        much they are respectively in credit or in debit with each other from time\n                        to time. … … When a position was closed a profit or loss arose to the client.\n                        If it was a profit Global Trader credited the amount of it to the\n                        client’s running account between himself and Global Trader. Unless the\n                        amount of the credit in the client’s account was required by way of\n                        margin to support open positions under other trading contracts between him\n                        and Global Trader, the client could draw on his account and require the\n                        company to pay the balance of it (or part of the balance) to himself\n                        … … … Alternatively he could leave it, or part of it, in place with a\n                        view to it being instantly available as margin should he wish to open a new\n                        position under a future trade. Sir Park then concluded (at 59): The basic relationship between Global Trader and a client was contractual.\n                        If a client had a credit balance in his running account and had no open\n                        positions he was entitled under the contract to call on Global Trader to pay\n                        him the balance. The balance was a debt, and … the client was\n                        entitled to have it repaid. It was just the same as a case where a customer\n                        of a bank whose account is in credit can call on the bank to pay him money\n                        up to the amount of the balance. 53     For present purposes, the above analysis is\n                    helpful in showing that although the customer’s account with the brokerage\n                    is not directly equivalent to a bank account, a customer’s Ledger Balance\n                    C/F is MFGS’ acknowledgement of sums which are due and payable to the\n                    customer. In the ordinary course absent any statutorily imposed or expressly\n                    declared trust, the Ledger Balance C/F therefore represents achose in actionwhich the customer could enforce by calling on\n                    MFGS for payment. 54     On the nature of a “chose in\n                    action”, guidance may also be taken from the Court of Appeal inLim Lye Hiang v Official Assignee[2012] 1 SLR 228 (at\n                    [27]–[28]) where the Court of Appeal explained: … A chose in action is an expression used to describe “all\n                        personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action,\n                        and not by taking physical possession”: seeTorkington v Magee… It is trite law that the existence of a\n                            chose in action does not depend upon immediate\n                            enforceability.InKwok Chi Leung Karl v\n                            Commissioner of Estate Duty… , the Privy Council (on\n                        an appeal from Hong Kong) was faced with the issue of,inter alia, whether an obligation to pay a sum of money on\n                        demand after sixty days constituted an existing chose in action at the time\n                        when the obligation was entered into. Lord Oliver of Aylmerton (delivering\n                        the judgment of the court) held that the obligation was indeed an existing\n                        chose in action at the time when the obligation was entered into. He stated\n                        … : A chose in action is no less a chose in action\n                                because it is not immediately recoverable by action\n                            ... ... A debt which is payable in futuro is no less a\n                                debt ... [emphasis added] 55     From the preceding analysis, it can be seen\n                    that on the terms of the MTA alone, MFGS would have different legal obligations\n                    in respect of the Unrealised Profits, Forward Value and Ledger Balance C/F,\n                    given that these constitute contingent, certain future and certain present debts\n                    respectively. What the customer has in relation to all three forms of profits\n                    would be a chose in action against MFGS. It is only when MFGS is obliged, by the\n                    terms of the MTA, to effect immediate payment of the quantified profits, that a\n                    customer has the right as against MFGS to demandimmediate\n                        paymentof those moneys, and even then, only if MFGS is solvent.\n                    In other words, taking reference from the terms of the contract between the\n                    customer and MFGS, the contents of each chose – if enforced – are\n                    slightly different from the others.",
        "The Proprietary Claim Issue: Whether the LFX and Bullion customers\n                have proprietary rights in the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value": "",
        "Whether a trust is capable of arising over the Unrealised Profits and\n                Forward Value": "56     With the discussion on the nature of\n                    Unrealised Profits and Forward Value in mind, I turn next to consider whether\n                    the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value are capable of being the subject-matter\n                    of a trust. Mr Yeap strenuously argues that it is not possible for a trust to\n                    arise over the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value because the LFX and Bullion\n                    customers’ interests in them are merely choses in action. It is not\n                    possible for the obligor (here, MFGS) to hold these choses in action on trust\n                    for the obligee (the LFX and Bullion customers), as this would contemplate the\n                    “obligor-trustee” having to sue itself for the benefit of the\n                    “obligee-beneficiary” in the event the obligation was not\n                    performed. 57     Further, Mr Yeap submits that even if this is\n                    possible, Vintage still has to conjure up “two magical\n                    conversions”, being (i) the conversion of a contingent or future\n                    “right to a receivable” into a “trust over the receivable\n                    arising from a contractual principal to principal relationship”; and (ii)\n                    a further conversion of a trust over such “right to a receivable”\n                    into a “trust over actual moneys” in circumstances where such a\n                    receivable was not even due and payable, let alone paid to the account and\n                    credit of the LFX and Bullion customers. 58     There is force in the Liquidators’\n                    submissions. As stated above, Vintage’s claims in relation to the\n                    Unrealised Profits and Forward Value are properly characterised as choses in\n                    action. The right to sue MFGS under these choses vests, at all times, in the LFX\n                    and Bullion customers. Although choses in action may be considered “items\n                    of property”, they are only property to the extent they may be\n                    transferred to third parties. Professor Hudson considers them\n                    “quasi-property rights”, analysing them as follows (seeEquity and Trustsat p 1298–1299): … [The status of personal claims] as property is said to rest\n                        primarily on their transferability… … The chose in action is a claim which attaches to one person and\n                        is exercisable over another. The chose in action is accepted in English law\n                        as being itself an item of property capable of transfer at law and having a\n                        value of its own. It is this transferability and this possibility of\n                        distinct value which imbue such personal claims with the status of property.\n                        … This transferable personal claim is therefore property with no\n                        identifiable proprietary base. 59     Similarly, Dr Joanna Benjamin inInterests in Securities: A Proprietary Law Analysis of the\n                        International Securities Markets(Oxford University Press, 2000)\n                    at para 13.10 states: … [A]n intangible asset may be the subject of a real action, butonly as against a third party.For example,as against the\n                            debtor, the creditor can only assert personal rights in relation to the\n                            debt.However, if the debt is held through an intermediary,\n                        the creditor can assert real rights in relation to the debt, as against the\n                        intermediary. On this basis, intermediation is not merely compatible with\n                        property rights in relation to intangibles; it is their precondition.\n                        [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 60     Thus, the LFX and Bullion customers are able\n                    to assert onlypersonal(and not proprietary)\n                    rights against MFGS in respect of the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value.\n                    Indeed, this would also be the position for the Ledger Balance C/F.\n                    Additionally, it is not possible for the chose in action to be transferred by\n                    the LFX and Bullion customers to MFGS, so as to be held by MFGS as legal owner\n                    and trustee for the benefit of another. In effect, this would require MFGS to\n                    sue itself in order to enforce the chose. This was illustrated in the case ofSimpson and Company v Thomson, Burrell[1877]\n                    3 App Cas 279. 61     In that case, two ships which collided were\n                    owned by the same person. Under the applicable legislation, the ship owner could\n                    pay a sum fixed by statute into court to require any one who had a claim against\n                    him for damage caused by the ship to prove it against that sum. The ship owner\n                    paid the sum into court in respect of one ship. There were competing claims to\n                    this sum by the owners of cargo aboard this ship, as well as the ship\n                    owner’s underwriters for loss caused by this ship to the ship\n                    owner’s other ship. The House of Lords held that as the underwriters had\n                    to sue in the name of the person insured (ie, the\n                    ship owner) it was not possible for the underwriters to claim against the sum\n                    paid into court as this would contemplate the ship owner having a right of\n                    action against himself. Lord Penzance stated the position that it would be\n                    “an absurdity, and a thing unknown to the law” for a person to\n                    have a right of action against himself (at 288). In the same vein, it would be a\n                    logical impossibility for an obligor of a chose in action to hold that chose in\n                    trust for the obligee. 62     In any event, even if this were possible and\n                    the LFX and Bullion customers had somehow vested the choses they had against\n                    MFGS in MFGS itself as trustee, it would not give them any proprietary rights to\n                    MFGS’ moneys. The claims would remain debts provable in MFGS’\n                    winding up. However, this is not the argument Vintage advances. Vintage’s\n                    argument is that MFGS was required by statute to segregate funds amounting to\n                    the value of the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value and hold these segregated\n                    funds on trust for the LFX and Bullion customers or, alternatively, did so\n                    voluntarily. 63     Vintage relies on the case ofMac-Jordan Construction Ltd v Brookmount Erostin Ltd (in\n                        receivership)[1992] BCLC 350 (“Mac-Jordan”) to support this position. InMac-Jordan, the plaintiff was a building contractor, and\n                    the defendant was a property developer. The contract between the parties\n                    provided for interim payments against architect’s certificates, but\n                    entitled the defendant to retain 3% from each certified amount. The contract\n                    also imposed an obligation on the defendant to set aside as a separate trust\n                    fund a sum equal to the sums the defendant was entitled to retain. However, the\n                    defendant did not set aside any moneys. Subsequently, the defendant became\n                    insolvent. The contest was between the plaintiff and a bank which had a floating\n                    charge over the defendant’s assets. The plaintiff argued that even though\n                    the requisite fund was not appropriated, the contractual obligation to segregate\n                    the moneys operated to confer on the plaintiff an equitable interest in the\n                    notional fund that ought to have been segregated by the defendant. 64     Scott LJ (with whom Parker and Farquharson LJJ\n                    agreed) rejected this argument, holding that the plaintiff had to show either\n                    that it had an equitable interest in identifiable assets, or that the bank was\n                    bound in equity to permit the plaintiff’s contractual right that the\n                    defendant segregate the retained sums to have effect. The English Court of\n                    Appeal found that there were no identifiable assets impressed with trusts which\n                    could be said to be applicable to the retention fund. As for the second point,\n                    the court also found that the plaintiff had no equity against the bank to\n                    require the bank to make available funds from the floating charge in order for a\n                    retention fund in favour of the plaintiff to be set up. Scott LJ considered that\n                    the contractual obligation was only an “unsatisfied and unsecured\n                    contractual right for the payment of money”. The defendant’s\n                    obligation to segregate the moneys was, on Scott LJ’s analysis, “no\n                    more than an obligation to pay money, the payee being [the defendant] itself as\n                    trustee” (at 358–359). 65     Unlike the defendant inMac-Jordan, MFGS had in the present case segregated funds daily\n                    to cover its obligations to the LFX and Bullion customers in respect of the\n                    Unrealised Profits and Forward Value. This, Vintage submits, is the critical and\n                    defining factor. In order to show that it has a proprietary interest over those\n                    segregated funds, Vintage seeks to establish that the relevant statutory\n                    provisions required MFGS to hold those funds on statutory trust, or that the\n                    relevant statutory provisions imposed a trust over such funds. Alternatively,\n                    Vintage seeks to show that MFGS had done so with the intention of settling an\n                    express trust. I turn first to the Statutory Trust issue.",
        "The Statutory Trust issue": "Principles of statutory interpretation 66     The question whether a statutory trust arises\n                    over the funds segregated by MFGS to cover its Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value obligations is a question of statutory interpretation. Evidence of how\n                    MFGS treated the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value is therefore not relevant\n                    to this issue. 67     In interpreting the SFA, CTA, SFR and CTR, the\n                    court’s starting point is s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev\n                    Ed) (“Interpretation Act”), which provides that statutes should be\n                    interpreted in a manner that would promote the purpose or object of the written\n                    law. It should be pointed out that under s 1 of the Interpretation Act,\n                    “written law” includes “all Acts … and subsidiary\n                    legislation made thereunder for the time being in force in Singapore”.\n                    Thus, a purposive interpretation must be given to both the SFR and CTR as well.\n                    V K Rajah JA (sitting in the High Court) inPublic Prosecutor\n                        v Low Kok Heng[2007] 4 SLR(R) 183 summarised the approach to be\n                    taken under s 9A of the Interpretation Act as such (at [57]): … [Section] 9A of the Interpretation Act mandates that a purposive\n                        approach be adopted in the construction of all statutory provisions, and\n                        allows extrinsic material to be referred to, even where, on a plain reading,\n                        the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous. The purposive approach\n                        takes precedence over all other common law principles of interpretation.However, construction of a statutory provision\n                            pursuant to the purposive approach stipulated by s 9A is constrained by\n                            the parameters set by the literal text of the provision.The\n                        courts should confine themselves to interpreting statutory provisions\n                        purposively with the aid of extrinsic material within such boundaries and\n                        assiduously guard against inadvertently re-writing legislation. …\n                        [emphasis added] 68     Thus, and as Vintage submits, the language of\n                    a particular statutory provision is the framework within which the legislative\n                    purpose must expressly or implicitly manifest, and the court should not construe\n                    statutes in a manner that would re-write the words of the statute. 69     Besides the principle of purposive\n                    interpretation, the Liquidators also submit that a statute should not be taken\n                    as fundamentally altering the common law unless it uses words that point\n                    unmistakably to that conclusion. This principle has been applied by the Court of\n                    Appeal inYing Tai Plastic & Metal Manufacturing (S) Pte\n                        Ltd v Zahrin bin Rabu[1983–1984] SLR(R) 212 at [19], and\n                    more recently by Rajah JA (sitting in the High Court) inGoldring Timothy Nicholas and others v Public Prosecutor[2013]\n                    3 SLR 487 at [51]. On this basis, the Liquidators argue that the court should be\n                    slow to construe the SFA and CTA and the regulations promulgated under these\n                    Acts as changing the fundamental nature of a trust, when the statutes have not\n                    expressly provided so. 70     Nonetheless, I note that a statutory trust is\n                    created by statute essentially stipulating that the legal owner of certain\n                    property is not to have beneficial ownership of that property. It may not\n                    “bear all the indicia which characterise a trust as it was recognised by\n                    the Court of Chancery apart from statute” (seeAyerst\n                        (Inspector of Taxes) v C. & K.

The Bullion transactions (1)   Whether the CTA and CTR apply to the Bullion\n                transactions 72     The long title of the CTA provides that it is\n                    “An Act for the regulation of certain types of commodity trading, and for\n                    matters connected therewith”. These concern the licensing of commodity\n                    brokers, the accounts to be kept by commodity brokers, and the conduct of\n                    commodity trading business among other things. 73     Section 2 of the CTA defines\n                    “commodity” as: … any produce, item, goods or article that is the\n                        subject of any — (a) commodity forward contract; (b)leveraged\n                                commodity trading; (c) contract made pursuant to trading in\n                            differences; or (d) spot commodity trading, and includes an index, a right or an interest in such commodity, and such\n                        other index, right or interest of any nature as the Board may, by\n                        notification in theGazette, prescribe to\n                        be a commodity; but does not include any produce, item, goods or article\n                        that is the subject of a commodity futures contract and any index, right or\n                        interest in such produce, item, goods or article[.] [emphasis added] Commodity futures contracts are excluded from the definition\n                        of “commodity” under s 2 of the CTA as these contracts are\n                        governed by the SFA instead (see [82] below). Section 2 of the CTA provides\n                        that a “commodity futures contract” is: (a) a contract the effect of\n                        which is that — (i) one party agrees to deliver a specified commodity, or a specified\n                            quantity of a specified commodity, to another party at a specified\n                            future time and at a specified price payable at that time pursuant to\n                            the terms and conditions set out in the business rules of a futures\n                            market or pursuant to the business practices of a futures market;\n                            or (ii) the parties will discharge their obligations under the contract\n                            by settling the difference between the value of a specified quantity of\n                            a specified commodity agreed at the time of the making of the contract\n                            and at a specified future time, such difference being determined in\n                            accordance with the business rules or practices of the futures market at\n                            which the contract is made; or (b) such other contract or class of\n                        contracts as the Board may prescribe, and includes a futures option transaction[.] 74     The Bullion transactions were not commodity\n                    futures contracts as they were not carried out pursuant to the business rules or\n                    practices of a futures market. Instead, as Mr Yap deposed in his affidavit, the\n                    Bullion transactions were “cash-settled leveraged bullion (gold or\n                    silver) spot contracts”. The LFX and Bullion Report prepared by the\n                    Liquidators states that these Bullion transactions mirrored the price movements\n                    of the underlying reference bullion without involving ownership of the reference\n                    bullion. These were therefore “leveraged commodity trading” under\n                    s 2 of the CTA, which is defined as,inter\n                    alia: (a) the act of entering into or\n                        offering to enter into, or inducing or attempting to induce a person to\n                        enter into or offer to enter into, a contract or an arrangement on a margin\n                        basis (other than a commodity futures contract) whereby a person undertakes\n                        as determined by the terms and conditions of the contract or arrangement\n                        — (i) to make an adjustment between himself and another person according\n                            to whether a commodity is worth more or less, at a specified point in\n                            time; (ii) to pay an amount of money determined or to be determined by\n                            reference to the change in value of a commodity over a specified period\n                            of time; or (iii) to deliver to another person at an agreed future time an agreed\n                            amount of commodities at an agreed price[.] 75     Thus, on a general level, the CTA and CTR\n                    apply to the Bullion transactions. At the hearing, Mr Yeap clarified that the\n                    Liquidators do not dispute this. The more specific issue raised by the\n                    Liquidators is whether the statutory trust and segregation obligations under the\n                    CTA and CTR apply to MFGS and to the Bullion transactions. This will be\n                    considered below in the context of the relevant provisions. (2)   The relevant provisions under the CTA and CTR 76     The primary provision in the CTA is s 30 which\n                    states: Segregation of customer’s funds by\n                            broker 30.—(1) The Board may, with the\n                        approval of the Minister, make regulations to provide that every commodity\n                        broker shall treat and dealwith all money, securities or\n                            property received by him from a customer in such manner and in such\n                            separate accounts as may be prescribed. (2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1),\n                        such regulations may provide — (a) for the circumstances in which\n                            funds, securities or property received from a customer may be segregated\n                            and deposited in the same account; (b) for the circumstances in and\n                            purposes for which funds may be withdrawn from separate trust\n                            accounts; (c) for the exemption by the Board of\n                            any commodity broker or class of commodity brokers, or any transaction\n                            or class of transactions relating to trading in commodity contracts,\n                            from any of the provisions of such regulations; and (d) that a contravention thereof shall\n                            be punishable with a fine not exceeding $30,000 or with imprisonment for\n                            a term not exceeding 3 years or with both. (3) Money, securities or property received from a customer\n                        and held by a commodity broker in a separate trust account under any\n                        regulations made under subsection (1) shall not be — (a) available for payment of the debts\n                            of the commodity broker to a creditor of the commodity broker; or (b) liable to be attached or taken in\n                            execution under the order or process of any court at the instance of\n                            such creditor, unless the creditor is a customer of the commodity broker and the debt\n                        owed to the creditor was incurred in connection with trading in any\n                        commodity contract. (4) Nothing in this section shall take away or affect a lawful claim or\n                        lien that a commodity broker has against, or on, any money, securities or\n                        property held in an account under any regulations made under subsection\n                        (1). (5) Nothing in this Act or any written law shall prevent a\n                        commodity market or a clearing house, with the approval of the Board, from\n                        using the money, securities or property held in a trust account to meet the\n                        obligations of a commodity broker, being a member of the market or the\n                        clearing house, who defaults, if — (a) the default of the commodity broker\n                            is directly attributable to the failure of his customer to meet the\n                            obligations under a commodity contract; and (b) the failure to use the money,\n                            securities or property held in a trust account may jeopardise the\n                            financial integrity of the market or the clearing house. (6) In this section, “customer” means a person on whose\n                        account a commodity broker carries on trading in any commodity contract, but\n                        does not include directors, employees and representatives and related\n                        corporations of the commodity broker. [emphasis added] 77     Under s 63(1) of the CTA, the International\n                    Enterprise Singapore (“IE Singapore”) Board is vested with power\n                    to “make regulations for carrying out the purposes and provisions of [the\n                    CTA] and for the due administration thereof”. The relevant regulations\n                    made in the CTR pursuant to,inter alia, ss 30 and\n                    63 of the CTA, are: Segregation of customer’s funds by\n                            brokers 21.—(1) Every commodity\n                        broker and spot commodity broker shall — (a) treat and deal withall money, securities or property received by him from a\n                                customerto margin, guarantee or secure contracts in\n                            commodity trading or spot commodity trading,or\n                                accruing to a customer as a result of such trading,as belonging to that customer;\n                            and (b) account in a separate trust account,\n                            designated or evidenced as such, for all the money, securities or\n                            property received from the customer or accruing to the customer pursuant\n                            to sub-paragraph (a), and shall not commingle that money, security or property with his own\n                        funds or use them to margin, guarantee or to secure the contracts or extend\n                        the credit of any other customer or person other than the person for whom\n                        they are held. … (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a commodity broker or spot commodity\n                        broker may have aresidual financial interestin a customer’s trust account and may from time to time advance from\n                        his own funds sufficient money to prevent any or all of his customers’\n                        trust accounts from becoming under-margined. … Segregated accounts 22.—(1) All customer’s moneys\n                        shall be segregated asbelonging to customersand separately accounted for. (2) Any customer’s moneys received shall be paid without delay into\n                        a customer’s account unless authorised otherwise by the customer\n                        concerned. … [emphasis added] 78     As can be seen, s 30 of the CTA deals largely\n                    with the making of regulations, and does not set out in great detail the\n                    substantive obligations of a commodity broker. Thus, the main provisions which\n                    set out the scope of a commodity broker’s obligations are to be found in\n                    regs 21 and 22 of the CTR. In my view, insofar as regs 21(1)(a) and 22(1) of the CTR state that a commodity broker shall\n                    treat certain funds asbelonging to that customer,\n                    this is language which imposes a statutory trust over money, securities or\n                    property falling within its ambit. Admittedly, the provisions do not expressly\n                    use the term “statutory trust”. However, I find that this isin substancewhat the provisions provide for.\n                    The clear implication of regs 21(1)(a) and 22(1)\n                    is that a commodity broker will not be able to dispose of the funds falling\n                    within the scope of regs 21(1)(a) and 22(1) for\n                    its benefit. This is consistent with s 30(3) of the CTA which prohibits a\n                    commodity broker from using money, securities or property held in a separate\n                    trust account as required by the CTR for the payment of the commodity\n                    broker’s debts. These provisions effectively disallow a commodity broker\n                    from using such moneys beneficially in the course of its business, which is the\n                    fundamental feature of a trust,viz, that the\n                    beneficial ownership of these funds is vested in the customer. This protection\n                    is supplemented by further provisions which impose segregation obligations (see\n                    for example regs 21(1)(b) and 22(2) of the\n                    CTR). (3)   The purpose and object of the statutory trust and the\n                segregation obligations in the CTA and CTR 79     Before analysing the relevant provisions\n                    further, I briefly consider the purpose and object of the statutory trust and\n                    the segregation obligations. 80     The CTA was enacted in 1992 as the Commodity\n                    Futures Act 1992 (Act 17 of 1992) (“the Commodity Futures Act”) to\n                    regulate trading in rubber futures contracts and other commodities, beginning\n                    with trading in rubber futures contracts (seeSingapore\n                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(20 March 1992) vol 59 at\n                    cols 1345–1348 (BG Lee Hsien Loong, Minister for Trade and Industry)\n                    (“the Second Reading of Commodity Futures Act”)). Section 30 of\n                    the Commodity Futures Act provided for the segregation of\n                    “customer’s funds”. The relevant regulations at the time\n                    were to be found in regs 22 and 23 of the Commodity Futures Regulations (Cap\n                    48A, Rg 1, 1993 Rev Ed) (“CFR”). In relation to these provisions,\n                    the Minister explained that (at col 1347): (3)Conduct of commodity futures\n                        business. The Bill requires funds placed by customers with their brokers to be\n                        separately accounted for, to prevent brokers from making use of their\n                        client's funds for any other purposes. 81     In 2001, the Commodity Futures Act was renamed\n                    the “Commodity Trading Act”. Parliament also amended the Act in\n                    order to expand its scope to deal with not just commodity futures contracts, but\n                    also commodity forward contracts, trading in differences, leveraged commodity\n                    trading and certain forms of spot commodity trading (see Commodity Futures\n                    (Amendment) Act 2001 (No 22 of 2001)). This change was prompted by the rise of\n                    “bucket shops”. Parliament also enacted provisions to require\n                    persons who wished to engage in such commodity trading activities to apply for a\n                    licence under the CTA. In this regard, in Parliament, the Acting Minister for\n                    Trade and Industry (“Acting Minister”) stated (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(16 May 2001)\n                    vol 73 at col 1714–1719 (Peter Chen, Acting Minister for Trade and\n                    Industry) (“the Bucket Shop Debate”) at col 1715): “Bucket shops” are firms that entice the public to open\n                        trading accounts with them and to grant them wide discretion totrade on the investors’ behalf. Instead of\n                        trading with the investors’ interest in mind, the contractual terms\n                        are such that they favour the firms. They may claim to effect transactions\n                        when they did not; or “churn”, that is, make repeated\n                        transactions to earn commissions, without regard to the interest of\n                        investors. Investors are enticed with small initial profits but may end up\n                        losing their entire investment. [emphasis added] 82     Subsequently in 2007, Parliament amended the\n                    CTA once more to “transfer regulatory oversight of commodity futures\n                    trading from IE Singapore under the CTA to MAS under the SFA and [Financial\n                    Advisers Act]” (seeSingapore Parliamentary Debtates,\n                        Official Report(17 July 2007) vol 83 at col 1223 (Lim Hng Kiang,\n                    Minister for Trade and Industry)). The result of these amendments was that\n                    commodity futures transactions were governed by the provisions of the SFA, with\n                    MAS acting as the regulator. IE Singapore retained regulatory oversight of\n                    over-the-counter commodity derivatives and spot commodity contracts under the\n                    CTA. 83     Despite these numerous amendments, the\n                    obligations originally enacted in s 30 of the Commodity Futures Act and reg 22\n                    and 23 of the CFR remain materially unchanged. In my view, the Second Reading of\n                    the Commodity Futures Act and the Bucket Shop Debate show that the provisions\n                    relating to the statutory trust as well as segregation under the CTA and CTR\n                    were enacted for the purpose of protecting consumers and investors, and to\n                    ensure thatcustomers’ fundsare not\n                    misused. With this understanding, I now consider whether these provisions apply\n                    to MFGS. (4)   Whether the statutory trust and segregation obligations\n                under the CTA and CTR apply to MFGS (A)   Parties’ submissions 84     Vintage takes the position that the\n                    requirements under s 30 of the CTA and under regs 21 and 22 of the CTR apply to\n                    any person who acts as a “commodity broker” within the meaning of\n                    the CTA. As MFGS carried on “leveraged commodity trading” through\n                    the Bullion transactions, it acted as a “commodity broker” under\n                    the CTA. Therefore, these provisions apply to MFGS and the Bullion\n                    transactions. 85     The Liquidators do not quarrel with\n                    Vintage’s submissions that MFGS acted as a “commodity\n                    broker”. However, the Liquidators submit that the regulations made under\n                    s 30 of the CTA do not apply to MFGS and the Bullion transactions as Vintage and\n                    the other Bullion customers were not “customers” as defined by s\n                    30(6) of the CTA. They argue that s 30(6) specifically limits the application of\n                    the statutory trust and segregation obligations to a customer “on whose accountthe commodity broker carries on\n                    trading” [emphasis added]. The Liquidators submit that the phrase\n                    “on whose account” should be interpreted to mean “on behalf\n                    of”, and the use of the phrase shows that the statutory trust and\n                    segregation obligations prescribed under s 30 of the CTA apply only to\n                    situations where the commodity broker acts as an agent on behalf of the\n                    customer, holding moneys, securities and property which are beneficially owned\n                    by the customer. 86     The Liquidators also refer to the Bucket Shop\n                    Debate (reproduced at [81] above), and argue that Parliament’s intention\n                    is to protect customers’ moneys only where the broker “trade[s] on\n                    the investor’s behalf”. Since MFGS contracted with the LFX and\n                    Bullion customers on a principal-to-principal basis, the provisions do not apply\n                    to MFGS. (B)   Analysis and findings 87     I accept Vintage’s submission that the\n                    statutory trust and segregation obligations made under s 30 of the CTA apply to\n                    any person who acts as a “commodity broker”. In my judgment, MFGS\n                    is a “commodity broker” under the CTA and CTR. 88     Section 2 of the CTA defines a\n                    “commodity broker” as: … a person who (whether as principal or\n                            agent) carries on the business of soliciting, or accepting\n                        orders, for the purchase or sale of any commodity by way of or relating to\n                        any commodity contract, whether or not the business is part of, or is\n                        carried on in conjunction with, any other business[.] [emphasis\n                        added] 89     Put simply, a commodity broker is defined in\n                    the CTA as a person who accepts orders for the purchase or sale of “any\n                    commodity” by way of or relating to “any commodity\n                    contract”. The definition also makes clear that a commodity broker may\n                    act as both principal and agent. I have set out the definition of\n                    “commodity” under the CTA above at [73]. Under s 2 of the CTA, a\n                    “commodity contract” is defined as: (a) a commodity forward contract; (b) any contract made pursuant to trading in\n                        differences with respect to a commodity, not being a commodity futures\n                        contract; or (c)any contract made\n                            pursuant to a transaction in leveraged commodity\n                        trading[.][emphasis added] 90     The Bullion transactions were over-the-counter\n                    “leveraged commodity trades” (as defined under s 2 of the CTA, see\n                    [74] above). In respect of these trades, MFGS acted as its customers’\n                    direct counterparty. Thus, by virtue of carrying out “leveraged commodity\n                    trading” with its customers as principal, MFGS fell under the definition\n                    of “commodity broker” under the CTA. 91     The evidence also shows that MFGS appeared to\n                    accept the applicability of the CTA without qualification. The MTA makes\n                    multiple references to the CTA. MFGS also states in the Risk Disclosure\n                    Statement that the section that deals with “Commodity Contracts”\n                    therein is provided in accordance with s 32(1) of the CTA. 92     I do not accept the Liquidators’\n                    arguments that there is a further qualification, and that by virtue of the\n                    definition of “customer” under s 30(6), s 30 of the CTA and the\n                    regulations in the CTR do not apply to MFGS. The general definition of customer\n                    under s 2 of the CTA and the specific definition in s 30(6) of the CTA are\n                    similar in material respects. The definition of “customer” in s 2\n                    of the CTA provides: “customer” means a personon whose\n                            accounta commodity broker carries on trading in commodity\n                        contracts …[emphasis added] Similarly, for the purposes of s 30 of the CTA, s 30(6)\n                        provides that: (6) In this section, “customer” means a personon whose accounta commodity broker carries on\n                        trading in any commodity contract,but does not include\n                            directors, employees and representatives and related corporations of the\n                            commodity broker.[emphasis added] 93     It is true, as the Liquidators argue, that the\n                    definition in s 30(6) is narrower than the definition in s 2 of the CTA.\n                    However, it is only narrower in that “directors, employees and\n                    representatives and related corporations of the commodity broker” are\n                    excluded from the definition of “customer” for the purposes of s\n                    30 and any regulations prescribed. These persons, it may be pointed out, are all\n                    personsconnectedwith the commodity broker. To\n                    that extent, s 30(6) makes clear that the commodity broker does not need to\n                    segregate funds for “customers” who are related or connected\n                    persons or entities. However, there is no merit in the argument that based on\n                    this narrowed definition, the obligations imposed by s 30 of the CTA and the\n                    attendant regulations applyonlyto situations\n                    where the broker acts as agent, while the other obligations imposed by the CTA\n                    on commodity brokers are not thus confined. 94     I am also not persuaded that the Bucket Shop\n                    Debate (see [81] above) sheds much light on the phrase “on whose\n                    account” in s 30(6) of the CTA. In the first place, although the Acting\n                    Minister used the phrase “on the investor’s behalf”, this\n                    does not necessarily mean that Parliament had intended to limit the scope of\n                    protection under s 30 only to situations where the commodity broker acts as\n                    agent on behalf of another. As pointed out earlier, these provisions were first\n                    introduced in the Commodity Futures Act and the CFR, which antedated the Bucket\n                    Shop Debate, and have remained substantially unchanged since (see\n                    [80]–[83] above). In fact, the Commodity Futures Act already contained the\n                    narrower definition of “customer” in s 30(6) alongside the broader\n                    general definition of “customer” under s 2 of the Commodity\n                    Futures Act. As stated above at [83], the purpose and object of these provisions\n                    is the protection of consumers and investors. In this context, the court should\n                    not interpret the law narrowly. 95     Further, the interpretation of the phrase\n                    “on whose account a commodity broker carries on trading in any commodity\n                    contract” turns on the definition of “account”. The term\n                    “account” possesses many meanings, and may be used as a noun or as\n                    a verb, depending on the context.Black’s Law\n                        Dictionary(Bryan A Garner chief ed) (Thomson Reuters, 10th Ed,\n                    2014) (“Black’s Law\n                    Dictionary”) gives the following definitions of\n                    “account” as a noun (at p 20–21): 3.A statement by which someone seeks to\n                        describe or explain an event …4.A detailed statement of the debits and\n                        credits between parties to a contract or to a fiduciary relationship; a\n                        reckoning of monetary dealings …5.A course of business\n                            dealings or other relationship for which records must be kept <open a\n                            brokerage account>. [emphasis added in italics] Black’s Law Dictionaryalso defines the term “account for”, which is a verb, as (at p\n                        23): 1.To furnish a good reason or convincing\n                        explanation for; to explain the cause of.2.To render a reckoning of (funds held, esp. in trust).3.To answer for (conduct). 96The Oxford English\n                        Dictionaryvol 1 (Clarendon Press, 2nd Ed, 1989)\n                        (“Oxford English Dictionary”)\n                    defines the term “on account” and “on account of” as\n                    (at p 86): on account: as an item to be accounted for\n                        at the final settlement, in anticipation of or as a contribution to final\n                        payment, as an interim payment on account of something in process.on one’s account: so that\n                            it shall be charged or entered to his account; in his behalf and at his\n                            expense.on one’s own\n                            account: for one’s own interest, and at one’s own\n                        risk. …on account of: (a) In consideration of, for the sake of, by reason of,\n                        because of. [italics in original; emphasis added in bold] 97     In my opinion, the term\n                    “account” takes its meaning from the context in which it is used.\n                    A “customer” under the CTA and CTR is one who possesses a\n                    brokerage account with a commodity broker under which trades in commodity\n                    contracts are entered into and charged to his or her expense. I find that this\n                    accords with a purposive interpretation of the CTA and is also aligned with the\n                    daily practice of MFGS. Whenever counterparties entered into an LFX or Bullion\n                    transaction, MFGS would issue in the Daily FX Activity Statement of that\n                    particular day a trade confirmation (see [14(a)] above). The confirmation would\n                    state that “the following trades have been made this dayfor your accountand risk” [emphasis added]. A\n                    person who possesses an account with MFGS is conventionally referred to as a\n                    “customer”, and indeed, MFGS refers to such persons as\n                    “customers” in the MTA. Any other interpretation would be\n                    artificial. 98     It is also significant that where appropriate,\n                    the CTA and CTR make a distinction between situations where a commodity broker\n                    acts as an agent or as a principal. One example of this distinction is within\n                    the definition of “commodity broker” itself (see [88] above)\n                    – the CTA makes clear that an agent or principal counterparty may both be\n                    considered “commodity brokers”. Another illustration of this may\n                    be found in reg 24 of the CTR. Regulation 24(1) provides that a commodity broker\n                    should “furnish to hiscustomersa written\n                    confirmation of each contract executed by the broker on behalf of thatcustomer” [emphasis added]. Regulation\n                        24(2)(b) then provides that if “the\n                    broker is dealingas principal” [emphasis\n                    added] the written confirmation should provide a statement that he is acting as\n                    such. Consequently, if s 30 of the CTA is meant to be restricted only to\n                    situations where a commodity broker acted as agent, the CTA would have expressly\n                    stated so. 99     One last miscellaneous point ought to be\n                    addressed. MFGS (and its predecessor, Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd) was licensed by\n                    IE Singapore as a “Commodity Futures Broker” from 1995 to 30 June\n                    2008. After the transfer of regulatory jurisdiction over commodity futures\n                    contracts from IE Singapore to MAS, MFGS took the view that it was no longer\n                    required to be licensed, and accordingly did not apply for a further licence\n                    post-July 2008. This is not an issue in these proceedings. However, I note that\n                    there are exemptions to the licensing requirement which are set out under the\n                    Schedule of the CTA. Additionally, I note that the segregation obligations under\n                    s 30 apply to a “commodity broker” and not to a licensed person.\n                    Separately, under reg 21(5) of the CTR, the IE Singapore Board may also exempt a\n                    commodity broker from the requirements under reg 21(1) of the CTR, subject to\n                    terms and conditions which provide reasonable protection for customers. As\n                    Vintage points out, there is no evidence of IE Singapore exempting MFGS from the\n                    requirements under reg 21(1) of the CTR. Consequently, for the reasons given\n                    above, I find that s 30 of the CTA and the relevant regulations within the CTR\n                    apply to MFGS, and to the Bullion transactions. (5)   Whether the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value\n                (attributable to Bullion transactions) are “money … accruing to a\n                customer” 100    As I have stated above at [78], the main\n                    provisions which impose the statutory trust and lay down substantive obligations\n                    on a commodity broker in relation to customers’ funds are to be found in\n                    regs 21 and 22 of the CTR. Regulation 21(1)(a) of\n                    the CTR requires a commodity broker to treat and deal with (i) all money,\n                    securities or propertyreceived bya commodity\n                    broker from a customer to margin, guarantee or secure contracts in commodity\n                    trading (limb (i) of reg 21(1)(a)), and (ii) all\n                    money, securities or propertyaccruing toa\n                    customer as a result of such trading (limb (ii) of reg 21(1)(a)),as belonging to the customer.\n                    Under reg 21(1)(b), the commodity broker is\n                    required to account in a separate trust account, designated or evidenced as\n                    such, for moneyreceived fromthe customer oraccruing tothe customer pursuant to reg\n                        21(1)(a). 101    It appears to me that it is reg\n                        21(1)(a) which delineates the scope of the\n                    statutory trust and the funds that MFGS is required to segregate. Interpreting\n                    reg 21(1)(a) in line with the legislative\n                    intention of protecting customers’ funds, I find that this statutory trust\n                    arises on thereceiptoraccrualof the money, securities or property. In other words,\n                    where money, securities or property isreceived\n                        froma customer oraccrues toa\n                    customer in accordance with reg 21(1)(a), they\n                    are,by operation of reg 21(1)(a), beneficially\n                    owned by the customer. Consequently, a customer may assert proprietary rights to\n                    the money, securities or property if the money, securities and property falling\n                    within the scope of the statutory trust are identifiable. In this regard, the\n                    obligations to segregate these funds pursuant to regs 21(1)(b), 22(1) and 22(2) do not create the trust, but are obligations\n                    which flow from the imposition of the statutory trust over certain property by\n                    reg 21(1)(a) and provide additional protection to\n                    ensure that customers’ moneys subject to the statutory trust are not\n                    dissipated or misused. 102    Evidently, money received by MFGS from a\n                    customer to margin Bullion transactions is “money received by [MFGS] from\n                    a customer to margin … contracts in commodity trading” and\n                    therefore falls within the first limb of the statutory trust (viz, limb (i) of reg 21(1)(a)). I\n                    pause to note that this statutory obligation is in fact contrary to the terms of\n                    the contract between MFGS and its customers (see cl A6.8 of the MTA set out at\n                    [45] above) and affords the customers a greater degree of protection than they\n                    would otherwise possess under the MTA. However, it is not so clear from the\n                    language of reg 21(1)(a) itself whether the\n                    statutory trust also captures the Unrealised Profits, Forward Value and Ledger\n                    Balance C/F. (A)   Parties’ submissions 103    Vintage argues that the Unrealised Profits\n                    and Forward Value represented moneys “accruing to” Vintage as a\n                    result of commodity trading. Vintage submits that the concept of\n                    “accruing” should be interpreted as referring to moneys which a\n                    party is “entitled to” after having\n                    done all that is required of it to earn that sum, even if such sums are not yet\n                    due and payable. Hence, even if the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value were\n                    not contractually payable debts, moneys segregated to cover these obligations\n                    should still be construed as “accruing to” Vintage as Vintage was\n                    already entitled to these moneys. 104    The Liquidators do not propose a different\n                    interpretation of the term “accruing to”. However, they argue that\n                    no statutory trust can arise over the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value as it\n                    would be a trust over choses in action, and not over any actual underlying\n                    moneys. The Liquidators point out that neither the CTA nor the CTR state that a\n                    commodity broker would be required to pay actual moneys into the Customer\n                    Segregated Accounts on account of debts payable in the future, with the result\n                    of a trust being created over physical moneys. In this regard, I also refer to\n                    the Liquidators’ submission above at [69], that the court should be slow\n                    to construe legislation as changing the fundamental nature of a trust. Having\n                    taken the position that the statutory trust and segregation obligations within\n                    the CTA and CTR do not apply to MFGS and the Bullion transactions, the\n                    Liquidators also adopt the position that the Ledger Balance C/F is held on trust\n                    for their customers on a “purely voluntary” basis, and “not\n                    as a consequence of any (inapplicable) segregation obligations under the\n                    CTA”. (B)   Analysis and findings 105    The crux of the issue is whether the\n                    Unrealised Profits, Forward Value and Ledger Balance C/F can be said to be\n                        “money…accruing toa customer as a result of [commodity\n                    trading]”. Vintage does not contend that there is\n                    “property” or “securities” accruing to the Bullion\n                    customers. However, I note that “property” is defined under reg 2\n                    of the CTR as including: … movable and immovable property, and any estate, share and\n                        interest in any property, movable or immovable, and any debt, andanything in action, and any other right or interest,\n                        whether in possession or not[.] [emphasis added] As analysed above at [41]–[55], what MFGS represented in\n                        Vintage’s Daily FX Activity Statements as Unrealised Profits and\n                        Forward Value are, on deeper legal analysis, choses in action (in the nature\n                        of contingent debts or certain debts payable at a future date by MFGS to\n                        Vintage) that Vintage had against MFGS, and which vested, at all times in\n                        Vintage. The Unrealised Profits and Forward Value thus fall within the\n                        meaning of “property” in the CTR. Nonetheless, as the choses\n                        always vested in the customer vis-à-vis MFGS in the principal-to-principal\n                        transactions, they do not formpropertyin\n                        MFGS’ hands that MFGS is able to hold on trust or\n                    segregate. 106    To the extent that Vintage argues thatmoney(as opposed to property) amounting to\n                    the value of Unrealised Profits and Forward Value had been segregated by MFGS,\n                    thereby forming the proprietary basis of a statutory trust, this requires\n                    Vintage to show that this ismoney accruing toVintage. I note at the outset that there is no definition of\n                    “money” within the CTA or the CTR. In my view, the term, when used\n                    in the context of the CTA and CTR, may be broadly understood. For example, reg\n                    22(5) of the CTR states that customers’ moneys deposited with any bank\n                    must be deposited under an account name which clearly identifies such moneys as\n                    customers’ moneys and shows that such moneys are segregated in the manner\n                    which reg 21 of the CTR requires. Thus, the term “money” in this\n                    context means actual physical money, as well as “money” in bank or\n                    other accounts (although this is not astrictlyaccurate analysis of a bank account: see Professor Hudson’s analysis of\n                    this above at [51]). 107    There is also no definition of the phrase\n                    “accruing to” under the CTA or CTR. TheOxford\n                        English Dictionarydefines the term “accrue” as (at\n                    p 90): 1.To fall (toany one) as a natural growth or increment; to come by way of addition or\n                        increase, or as an accession or advantage. … 2.To arise or spring as a natural growth or\n                        result. …Esp. of interest: To grow or arise as the\n                        produce of money invested. [emphasis in original] 108Black’s Law\n                        Dictionarydefines the term “accrue” as (at p\n                    25): 1.To come into existence as an enforceable\n                        claim or right; to arise <the plaintiff’s cause of action for\n                        silicosis did not accrue until the plaintiff knew or had reason to know of\n                        the disease>. … 2.To accumulate periodically; to increase\n                        over a period of time <the savings-account interest accrues\n                        monthly>. 109    Vintage cites cases from three legal\n                    contexts,viz, income tax law, garnishee\n                    proceedings and the accrual of causes of action, as part of its effort to urge\n                    the court that money should be treated as “accruing to” a customer\n                    as a result of commodity trading when the customer has done all that is required\n                    of it to earn that sum, even if such sums were not due and\n                payable. 110    Section 10(1) of the Income Tax Act (Cap\n                    134, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Income Tax Act”) provides that income tax is\n                    payable upon “theincomeof any personaccruing inor derived from Singapore or\n                    received in Singapore from outside Singapore” [emphasis added]. The cases\n                    which discuss the concept of accruing income deal largely with whether certain\n                    payments received by a taxpayer could be considered as “income”.\n                    InPinetree Resort Pte Ltd v Comptroller of Income\n                        Tax[2000] 3 SLR(R) 136, the Court of Appeal interpreted the term\n                    “accrue” in the context of s 10(1) of the Income Tax Act to mean\n                    “to which any person has become entitled” (at [23]). This was\n                    followed by Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA inABD Pte Ltd v\n                        Comptroller of Income Tax[2010] 3 SLR 609 (“ABD Pte Ltd”). 111    InABD Pte\n                    Ltd, the issue was whether an entrance fee paid to the taxpayer-club\n                    upon a member’s admission should be wholly taxed within the year during\n                    which the member paid the fee, or whether it should be taxed equally over the\n                    period of club membership. This depended on whether the club earned the fee at\n                    the time the members were admitted, or whether the fees were instead earned over\n                    the period of club membership. The court discussed various authorities and held\n                    that “the stage at which a taxpayer will be deemed to have done all that\n                    is required of it to earn the income depends on the particular trade it is\n                    engaged in” (at [28]). On the facts ofABD Pte\n                        Ltd, Phang JA was of the view that the entrance fees accrued asincometo the club upon the club’sreceiptof the moneys (see [30]). The court\n                    stated (at [20] and [29]): 20 … In the present case, the Appellant became legally entitled to\n                        the entrance fees once a member was admitted to membership. This is apparent\n                        from the fact that, should the Appellant allow a member to pay the entrance\n                        fees by monthly instalments, any unpaid balance of the monthly instalments\n                        becomes immediately due and payable if a member transfers his membership\n                        … , resigns his membership … , or if he is expelled from the\n                        Club … . Moreover, there appears to have been no restriction on the\n                        right of the Appellant to deal with the entrance fees as it wished once they\n                        were received. … 29 ... [T]he obligation of the Appellant, upon receipt of the entrance\n                        fees, was merely to admit the payer of the entrance fees to membership.\n                        … The entrance fees paid to the Appellantcan\n                            fairly be said to have \"come home\" to the Appellantupon the\n                        grant of membership since the Appellant was legally entitled to the whole of\n                        the entrance fees once the application for membership was approved.\n                        [emphasis added] Phang JA therefore held that the club should be taxed on the\n                        full sum of the entrance fee in the year it was paid. 112    The analysis above reveals that whether the\n                    court considered that income had “accrued” depended on whether the\n                    taxpayer was “legally entitled” to the entrance fees. This in turn\n                    depended on what the club was obliged to do upon receipt of the fees. In\n                    essence, once the club had performed its obligation, the fees could be said to\n                    have “come home” to the taxpayer, and was consequently income that\n                    was liable to income tax. It is important to note that inABD\n                        Pte Ltd, the club had alreadyreceivedthe entrance fees from its members before the question\n                    as to whether income had accrued arose. 113    In the context of garnishee proceedings, O\n                    49 r 1(1) of the Rules of Court provides that the court may “order the\n                    garnishee to pay the judgment creditor the amount of any debt due oraccruing due tothe judgment debtor from the\n                    garnishee” [emphasis added]. Vintage cites the Malaysian case ofCheong Heng Loong Goldsmiths (KL) Sdn Bhd & Anor v\n                        Capital Insurance Bhd and another appeal[2004] 1 MLJ 353, which\n                    in turn relied on the Indian case ofShanti Prasad Jain v\n                        Director of Enforcement Foreign Exchange Regulation ActAIR 1962\n                    SC 1764, to interpret the term “accrued debt” in this context to\n                    mean a debt payable in the future. In the latter case, Venkatarama Iyer J\n                    delivered the judgment on behalf of the Full Bench of the Supreme Court of\n                    India, stating: A contingent debt is strictly speaking not a debt at all. In its ordinary\n                        as well as its legal sense, a debt is a sum of money payable under an\n                        existing obligation. It may be payable forthwith, solvendum in praesenti,\n                        then it is a debt “due” or it may be payable at a future date,\n                        solvendum future; then it is a debt “accruing”. But in either\n                        case it is a debt. Buta contingent debthas\n                        no present existence, because itis payable only when the\n                            contingency happens, and ex hypothesi that may or may not\n                        happen. [emphasis in original] 114    The preceding analysis is also consistent\n                    with the position in England (seeWebb v Stenton(1883) 11 QBD 518) and in Singapore (seeLim Boon Kwee\n                        (trading as B K Lim & Co) v Impexital SRL (Sembawang Multiplex Joint\n                        Venture, garnishee)[1998] 1 SLR(R) 757 at [15]). Thus, in the\n                    context of garnishee proceedings, “accrued debts” are debts which\n                    arise out of a present obligation, but are payable only in the future (ie, future debts). Contingent debts are not debts\n                    “accruing due to” the judgment debtor under the Rules of Court,\n                    and are not attachable in garnishee proceedings. 115    Lastly, Vintage refers to the use of the\n                    term “accrue” in the context of the accrual of causes of action.\n                    Here, the relevant provisions are to be found in the Limitation Act (Cap 163,\n                    1996 Rev Ed), which sets out various timelines as to when specific types of\n                    causes of action accrue. InFairview Developments Pte Ltd v\n                        Ong & Ong Pte Ltd and another appeal[2014] 2 SLR 318\n                        (“Fairview Developments”), the\n                    Court of Appeal held that an architect’s entitlement to sue the client for\n                    payment only accrues when the architect issues an invoice to the client, stating\n                    (at [87]): When [the relevant clauses applicable to the parties’ relationship]\n                        are read together, it was evident that while an architect became entitled to\n                        progress payments upon the completion of the various stages, such progress\n                        payments only became \"due and payable\" upon the issuance of the relevant\n                        invoice(s). Accordingly, while an architect's entitlement to payment accrues\n                        upon completion of various stages,no right and\n                            corresponding cause of action to sue upon such a right arises unless and\n                            until the relevant invoice(s) had been issued. To put it\n                        another way, the entitlement to fees crystallises into a right upon which a\n                        cause of action accrues only when the invoice is issued. [emphasis in\n                        original] 116    It is pertinent that the Court of Appeal\n                    separated the concept of (i) the architect’sentitlement to paymentand (ii) the accrual of the\n                    architect’scause of action. Although the\n                    architect’s entitlement to payment had arisen, the architect’s cause\n                    of action only accrued (for the purposes of limitation periods) when the debt\n                    became “due and payable” on the issuance of the\n                invoice. 117    As may be observed from the preceding\n                    analysis of the term “accrue” or “accruing” in\n                    varying legal contexts, the interpretation is not uniform for all contexts and\n                    purposes. In the three different contexts considered, the subject-matter of the\n                    accrual (ie, income, debt or causes of action)\n                    influenced the interpretation of the term. Regard must also be had to the\n                    framework in which the term operates, as well as the purpose and object of the\n                    provisions. In this regard, I have found that Parliament’s intention in\n                    imposing a statutory trust through reg 21(1)(a) of\n                    the CTR is primarily for the protection of what should be the customers’\n                    funds (see [83] above). 118    It appears to me that “money,\n                    securities or property … accruing to a customer as a result of\n                    [commodity] trading” should simply be interpreted to mean the\n                    accumulation or accretion of money, securities or propertytoa customer as a result of commodity trading. More critically,\n                    I am of the view that much will depend on the specific rights and obligations\n                    that exist between the commodity broker and its customer so as to determine what\n                    money is accruing to a customer such that a commodity broker is obliged to hold\n                    the moneyforthe customer. This is similar to the\n                    approach inABD Pte Ltd. 119    In my view, the Unrealised Profits and\n                    Forward Value, being contingent and future debts owed by MFGS to a customer, are\n                    not “money[s] … accruing to a customer as a result of [commodity]\n                    trading” and do not fall within the ambit of the statutory trust under\n                    reg 21(1)(a) of the CTR. 120    I elaborate. The Unrealised Profits, even on\n                    Vintage’s argument, would not be considered moneys accruing to Vintage as\n                    it had not done all that it was required to earn the sum (ie, close-out was still required). Indeed, based on the cases\n                    which Vintage relies on in the context of garnishee proceedings, the Unrealised\n                    Profits, being contingent debt obligations, would not be debts “due or\n                    accruing due” under the Rules of Court (see [115] above). If a contingent\n                    debt is not a debt “accruing due” in the context of garnishee\n                    proceedings,a fortori, it cannot give rise to the\n                    accrual ofmoney. 121    Vintage argues that as the Bullion\n                    transactions were marked-to-market, the gains (ie,\n                    the Unrealised Profits) and losses would be considered asaccruingon a daily basis. The concept of marked-to-market is\n                    defined in s 2 of the CTR as “theprocesswhereby the daily closing price of a commodity contract is used to value all\n                    outstanding positions of that contract at the end of the day and to establish\n                    the resulting gains and losses” [emphasis added]; marking the position to\n                    market is therefore only aprocessby which the\n                    quantum of the contingent debt claim is valued. The fact that a process is\n                    required to value the Unrealised Profits belies its unpredictable nature. As\n                    Unrealised Profits arecontingentdebt\n                    obligations, MFGS is not required or obliged to hold any money for a customer in\n                    relation to those Unrealised Profits. 122    On the Forward Value, Vintage argues that it\n                    represents the “quantified profit … following the closure of an\n                    open position”. As the profitcrystallisesupon close-out and becomes Forward Value, Vintage must be held to beentitledto money equivalent to the Forward Value. I\n                    note that analogising from the approach in garnishee proceedings, it may be\n                    argued that the Forward Value, being a certain future debt, is “accruing\n                    to” the creditor. However, what would be “accruing to”\n                    would be a debt (which isproperty), and notmoney. Drawing from the income tax cases\n                    discussed, it may be argued that Vintage has done all that is necessary to be\n                    entitled to the Forward Value. To answer that question, in the context of the\n                    tax cases, the court clearly considered theobligationsbetween the parties to be relevant. Under the\n                    contractual provisions, MFGS is not obliged to pay a customer the Forward Value\n                    until the Value Date, when the Forward Value becomes due and payable. Before the\n                    Value Date, Vintage could not have claimed payment of the Forward Value. Insofar\n                    as Vintage did not have a right to receive actual money from MFGS prior to the\n                    Value Date, it could not be said, in the words of Phang JA inABD Pte Ltd, thatmoneyhad\n                    “accrued” or “come home” to Vintage at that stage.\n                    Similarly, inFairview Development, the Court of\n                    Appeal held that thecause of actiondid not\n                    accrue until the sums were due and payable (although the architect was alreadyentitled to be paid). 123    Thus, I find that prior to the Value Date,\n                    there is nomoneyaccruing to Vintage, and any\n                    money placed by MFGS into the Customer Segregated Accounts to cover the value of\n                    the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value does not fall within the scope of the\n                    statutory trust under reg 21(1)(a) of the CTR.\n                    Rather, consistent with reg 21(4) of the CTR, I accept the Liquidators’\n                    position that this remained MFGS’ “residual financial\n                    interest” in the Customer Segregated Accounts. 124    Vintage also relies on the fact that Vintage\n                    was entitled to use the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value for trading\n                    purposes. Specifically, MFGS would take into account any Unrealised Profits and\n                    Unrealised Losses in computing whether Vintage’s margins were sufficient.\n                    Vintage thus argues that those moneys accrued to Vintage. I find difficulty with\n                    this submission. It appears to me that this only shows that MFGS allowed Vintage\n                    to use the value of thechoses in actionVintage\n                    had against MFGS to engage in further trades. However, this does not show that a\n                    statutory trust arises over MFGS’moneywhich MFGS segregated to cover its\n                    obligations attributable to Unrealised Profits and Forward Value arising from\n                    the Bullion transactions. On this, I also refer to my discussion at\n                    [222]–[223] below. 125    Vintage submits that a distinction cannot be\n                    drawn between the Forward Value and the Ledger Balance C/F as this would cause\n                    the protection afforded by the CTA and CTR to depend on the contractual\n                    agreement between each commodity broker and its customers. With respect, this\n                    argument is misconceived. The CTA and CTR do not operate in a vacuum, and must\n                    be applied to the context of each agreement. I agree with the Liquidators that\n                    the terms and timing of settlement and payment are matters properly left for\n                    parties to contract. Indeed, the requirement imposed on a commodity broker by\n                    reg 24(2)(b) of the CTR to state when he is acting\n                    as principal that he is doing so in all contract confirmations, is recognition\n                    of the fact that different rights and obligations will be generated when the\n                    broker acts as principal to or agent for the customer. 126    Vintage also citesIn the\n                        matter of Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (In Administration) and In\n                        the matter of the Insolvency Act 1986[2012] UKSC 6\n                        (“Re Lehman Brothers”) andIn Re MF Global Australia Ltd (in liq)[2012]\n                    NSWSC 994 (“Re MF Global Australia”)\n                    to show that international practice leans in favour of protection of the\n                    investor. On this basis, Vintage urges this court to hold that the Unrealised\n                    Profits and Forward Value should be the subject-matter of a statutory trust\n                    under the CTA and CTR. I do not derive much guidance from either decision as\n                    these cases deal largely with jurisdiction-specific legislation. Also, it would\n                    be mischaracterising the regime in Singapore to state that the CTA and CTR do\n                    not protect investors should the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value fall\n                    outside the ambit of the statutory trust imposed thereunder. Without the\n                    protection afforded by the CTA and CTR, the margins and the Ledger Balance C/F\n                    would not even be the subject of proprietary claims. (6)   Whether the Ledger Balance C/F (attributable to Bullion\n                transactions) is “money … accruing to a customer” 127    Although the parties did not contest that\n                    the Ledger Balance C/F in respect of Bullion transactions is held on trust, it\n                    would nonetheless be useful to complete the analysis. On the Value Date, MFGS is\n                    obliged to pay the Forward Value due on that date to the customer. As I have\n                    explained above at [53], where money is paid by crediting the customer’s\n                    Ledger Balance C/F, absent any statutory or express trust, a customer would only\n                    havein personamrights to those funds as against\n                    MFGS. 128    In this scenario, the customer is vulnerable\n                    to misuse, misappropriation or dissipation of those funds by the commodity\n                    broker. To address this, the CTA and CTR confer additional protection on\n                    customers. Hence, where a customer has a right to receive moneyimmediatelyfrom MFGS, and where this money is paid by\n                    crediting sums to the Ledger Balance C/F and has not been actually paid to the\n                    customer, this ismoneywhichaccruesto the customer, and which may be said to have\n                    “come home” to the customer. Therefore MFGS, by virtue of reg\n                        21(1)(a), holds money paid by crediting the\n                    Ledger Balance C/F on trust for the customer. 129    Insofar as the payment by crediting the\n                    Ledger Balance C/F is accompanied by the concomitant segregation of the\n                    equivalent value of funds into or within the Customer Segregated Accounts, the\n                    customer has proprietary rights to the value of such funds in the Customer\n                    Segregated Accounts. A question one might have at this juncture is what the\n                    position would be if MFGS failed to segregate the moneys into or within the\n                    Customer Segregated Accounts on the Value Date despite having credited the\n                    Ledger Balance C/F. In my provisional view, as the statutory trust arises on\n                    receipt or accrual of the money, securities or property, a customer may assert\n                    proprietary rights if the money, securities or property are identifiable. To\n                    that extent, segregation is a useful and often necessary tool to ensure that\n                    customers’ rights are adequately protected. For example, where MFGS\n                    receives money from a customer as margin for commodity trades, the margins are\n                    protected upon MFGS’receiptby virtue of reg 21(1)(a) of the CTR. However, if MFGS fails to place the margins (or\n                    equivalent funds) into the Customer Segregated Accounts, those moneys may be\n                    dissipated or become unidentifiable. In such a case, the customer may not be\n                    able to assert proprietary rights to those funds against MFGS, although the\n                    customer may have a separate claim for breach of trust or statutory duty.\n                    Nevertheless, this does not really arise for determination in this\n                case. 130    Save for the dispute over when payment by\n                    the crediting of the Forward Value with a Value Date of 1 November 2011 occurred\n                    or should have occurred (which will be discussed below as the Value Date issue),\n                    it is not in contention that MFGS paid and credited moneys to its\n                    customers’ Ledger Balance C/F, and segregated moneys accordingly in the\n                    Customer Segregated Accounts. A statutory trust thus arises, by virtue of the\n                    provisions in the CTR, over such funds in the Customer Segregated Accounts\n                    equivalent to the value of a customer’s Ledger Balance C/F (attributable\n                    to Bullion transactions). The LFX transactions (1)   Whether the SFA and the SFR apply to the LFX\n                transactions 131    The long title of the SFA states that it is\n                    an Act “relating to the regulation of activities and institutions in the\n                    securities, futures and derivatives industry, including leveraged foreign\n                    exchange trading”. MFGS was the holder of a CMS licence issued by MAS and\n                    was authorised, among other things, to carry out leveraged foreign exchange\n                    trading. The SFA and the SFR thus apply to the LFX transactions, which were\n                    leveraged foreign exchange trading transactions. These matters are not disputed\n                    by the parties. (2)   The relevant provisions under the SFA and SFR 132    Division 2 of Part V of the SFA deals with\n                    “customer assets”. At the material time, the relevant provisions\n                    in the SFA provided as follows: Interpretation of this Division 103A.In this Division, unless the context\n                        otherwise requires, “money or other assets” means moneyreceived or retained by, or any other\n                        asset deposited with, a holder of a capital markets services licence in the\n                        course of its businessfor which it is liable to\n                            accountto its customer, and any money or other assetsaccruing therefrom. Handling of customer assets 104.—(1) A holder of a\n                        capital markets services licence shall, to the extent that itreceives money or other assets from or on account ofa customer — (a) do so on the basis that the money or\n                            other assets shall be applied solely for such purpose as may be agreed\n                            to by the customer, when or before it receives the money or other\n                            assets; (b) pending such application, pay or\n                            deposit the money or other assets in such manner as may be prescribed;\n                            and (c) record and maintain a separate book\n                            entry for each customer in accordance with the provisions of this Act in\n                            relation to that customer’s money or other assets. [emphasis\n                            added] It should be noted that s 104(1)(a) of the SFA was amended slightly in 2012, but I am not\n                        concerned with the amended provision here. 133    Unlike the CTA, the SFA clearly provides\n                    that for the purposes of Part V of the SFA, “customers” can\n                    include counterparties with whom a CMS licence holder enters into transactions\n                    as principal (see s 2 of the SFA). Parenthetically, I note that this lends\n                    weight to my interpretation of “customer” under the CTA, as I am\n                    of the view that it is unlikely that the protection under the CTA and SFA would\n                    differ in such a material aspect. 134    Section 104A of the SFA states that customer\n                    money and assets are not (i) available to a CMS licence holder for payment of\n                    its debts or (ii) liable to be paid or taken in execution under an order or\n                    process of any court, unless provided for in Part V of the SFA or the applicable\n                    regulations, being the SFR. 135    Pursuant to,inter\n                        alia, s 104(2) of the SFA, regulations were made under the SFR to\n                    govern the handling of “money or other assets” by a CMS licence\n                    holder. Regulation 16 of the SFR states: Money received on account of customer 16.—(1) The holder of a\n                        capital markets services licence — (a) shall treat and deal with allmoneys received on accountof its\n                            customeras belonging to that\n                            customer; (b) shall deposit allmoneys received on accountof its customer in a trust\n                            account or in any other account directed by the customer; and (c) shall not comminglemoneys received on accountof its customer with\n                            other funds, or use the moneys as margin or guarantee for, or to secure\n                            any transaction of, or to extend the credit of, any person other than\n                            the customer. (2) The holder shall deposit the money receivedon\n                            account ofits customer in the trust account no later than\n                        the business day immediately following the day on which the holder receives\n                        such money or is notified of the receipt of such money, whichever is the\n                        later, unless the money has in the meantime been paid to the customer or\n                        deposited in an account directed by the customer or unless it is deposited\n                        in accordance with regulation 19 or invested in accordance with regulation\n                        20. (3) In paragraph (2), “business day” means the business day\n                        of the holder or, if the custodian with whom the trust account is maintained\n                        is closed for business on that day and the holder is unable to deposit the\n                        money in the account, the next business day of the custodian. (4) Moneys received by the holderon account\n                            ofits customers may be commingled and deposited in the same\n                        trust account. 136    Regulation 15(2) of the SFR then sets out\n                    what “money received on account” means: (2) For the purposes of this Part, a reference to moneyreceived on accountof a customer of the\n                        holder of a capital markets services licence includes — (a) moneyreceived\n                                from, or on account of, the customer in respect of a sale\n                            or purchase of futures contract or a transaction connected with\n                            leveraged foreign exchange trading; … (e) moneyreceived\n                                from, or on account of, the customer for the purpose of\n                            managing the customer’s funds; and (f) moneyreceived\n                                from, or on account of, the customer in the course of the\n                            business of the holder, but does not include — (i) money which is to be used to reduce the amount owed by the\n                            customer to the holder; (ii) money which is to be paid to the customer or in accordance with\n                            the customer’s written direction; (iii) money which is to be used to defray the holder’s brokerage\n                            and other proper charges; and (iv) money which is to be paid to any other person entitled to the\n                            money. [emphasis added] 137    Unlike the provisions under the CTA and CTR,\n                    the relevant obligations imposed by the SFA and SFR do not explicitly refer to a\n                    requirement to “segregate”. However, I am of the view that insofar\n                    as regs 16(1)(b) and (c) state a CMS licence holder shall deposit “moneys\n                    received on account of a customer” into a trust account and shall not\n                    commingle those moneys with its own funds or use those moneys for\n                    cross-margining purposes, regs 16(1)(b) and\n                        (c) of the SFRin\n                        effectimpose segregation obligations on a CMS licence\n                    holder. (3)   The purpose and object of the statutory trust and the\n                segregation obligations in the SFA and SFR 138    In order to aid the analysis of the relevant\n                    provisions in the SFA and SFR that follow, the history of the SFA and SFR and\n                    the object and purpose of these provisions will be briefly\n                examined. 139    The SFA was enacted as an omnibus Act in\n                    2001 in an effort to consolidate the provisions governing the securities and\n                    futures industry (eg, the Futures Trading Act (Cap\n                    116) (“FTA”), the Securities Industry Act (Cap 289)\n                    (“SIA”) and certain provisions in the Exchanges (Demutualisation\n                    and Merger) Act (Cap 99B) and the Companies Act (Cap 50)) into a single\n                    licensing regime which covered leveraged foreign exchange trading, among other\n                    activities. 140    Leveraged foreign exchange trading first\n                    came to be regulated under the FTA in 1995. Section 37 of the FTA set out the\n                    obligations of brokers in a manner similar to reg 16 of the SFR. Given the\n                    similarity of the provisions, it would be useful to examine the underlying\n                    object and purpose of the obligations as originally enacted in the FTA. In\n                    Parliament, the following was stated (seeSingapore\n                        Parliamentary Reports, Official Report(31 March 1986) vol 47 at\n                    cols 1431–1436 (Dr Hu Tsu Tau, Minister for Finance) at col\n                    1435–1436): The conduct of business In the futures industry, the segregation of customers' funds plays a key\n                        role in the protection of their interests. The Bill provides that the funds\n                        placed by customers with their brokers for margin requirements must be\n                        separately accounted for and not be comingled with those of the brokers.This is to prevent brokers from making use of their\n                            clients' funds for any other purpose than for the benefit of the clients\n                            themselves.[emphasis added] 141    The second main predecessor Act to the SFA\n                    was the SIA. Sections 103A and 104 of the SFA appear to be derived from s 64 of\n                    the SIA. On s 64 of the SIA, the Minister stated (Singapore\n                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(31 March 1986) vol 47 at\n                    cols 1440–1447 (Dr Hu Tsu Tau, Minister for Finance) at col 1445): Under the Bill, fund managers will be required to be licensed as\n                        investment advisers so as to afford greater protection for investors.An entire new Division 2 in Part VII of the\n                            Bill[under which s 64 is found]sets out\n                            the basic requirements of fund managers which fund managers have to\n                            abide by, such as the keeping of proper accounts. Clients' funds are\n                            also required to be kept in separate trust accounts and are not to be\n                            commingled with those of the fund manager nor to be used for purposes\n                            other than for the clients' benefit.[emphasis added] 142    To the extent that the various provisions in\n                    the FTA and SIA relating to customers’ moneys and assets have been\n                    consolidated and re-enacted in the SFA or SFR, it is clear that the purpose and\n                    object behind these provisions is to protect customers’ moneys in order to\n                    guard against the risk of dissipation, misuse or misappropriation. With this in\n                    mind, I turn to consider whether the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value fall\n                    within the Parliament’s intended scope of protection. (4)   Whether the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value\n                (attributable to LFX transactions) are “money received on account of”\n                a customer (A)   Parties’ submissions 143    The Liquidators submit that under s 103A of\n                    the SFA, what constitutes “money or other assets” which the CMS\n                    licence holder is obliged to segregate are moneys or other assets which it is\n                    “liable to account” to its customer for. This, the Liquidators\n                    say, then depends on whether the moneys or assets are beneficially owned by the\n                    customer. 144    The Liquidators take the position that a\n                    customer’s margins and Ledger Balance C/F are moneys which MFGS is\n                    “liable to account” for. However, as the Unrealised Profits and\n                    Forward Value were not due and payable to its customer, there could be no\n                    underlying moneys to which a customer could have a proprietary interest in\n                    unless and until these debt obligations were discharged by payment into the\n                    Customer Segregated Accounts. Thus, there were no physical moneys or assets\n                    which could have been beneficially owned by MFGS’ customers. 145    Vintage anchors its case on the basis that\n                    the funds segregated by MFGS to cover the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value\n                    were moneys which MFGS held “on account of” Vintage under s 104(1)\n                    of the SFA and reg 15(2)(a) of the SFR. Since the\n                    segregation obligations under the SFA were enacted to protect customers’\n                    moneys, especially in the context of insolvency, both customers’ margins\n                    and the funds segregated to cover the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value\n                    should be protected by being made the subject of a statutory trust. As the\n                    phrase “received from” requires the CMS licence holder to\n                    segregate moneys received as margins from customers, the phrase “on\n                    account of” should apply to the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value. 146    Vintage also refers to the phrase\n                    “accruing therefrom” under s 103A of the SFA. Similar to the\n                    submissions advanced in relation to the CTA, Vintage argues that the phrase\n                    “any money or asset accruing therefrom” under s 103A should be\n                    defined as being that which a party is entitled to after having done all that is\n                    required of it to earn that sum but which was not yet due. (B)   Analysis and findings 147    The provisions in the SFA and SFR relating\n                    to customer moneys and assets are not structured in an entirely straightforward\n                    manner. As stated, the Liquidators construct their case largely on the\n                    definition of “money or other assets” under s 103A of the SFA. The\n                    Liquidators argue that what a CMS licence holder is obliged to segregate are\n                    moneys or other assets which it is “liable to account to its\n                    customer” for, and in turn, that a CMS licence holder is only\n                    “liable to account to its customer” for what the customer is\n                    beneficially entitled to. I have considerable difficulties with this\n                    argument. 148    I refer to [95]–[96] above, where I\n                    have explained that the term “account” possesses many meanings.\n                    Used as a noun, “account” may be defined as “a detailed\n                    statement of the debits and credits between partiesto a\n                        contract or to a fiduciary relationship; a reckoning of monetary\n                    dealings” [emphasis added] (seeBlack’s Law\n                        Dictionaryat p 20). When used as a verb, the term\n                    “account for” may be defined as “to furnish a good reason\n                    or convincing explanation for”, or “to render a reckoning\n                    of” (seeBlack’s Law Dictionaryat p\n                    23). It appears to me that s 103A stipulates that Div 2 of Part V of the SFA is\n                    concerned with the treatment of “money or other assets” for which\n                    a CMS licence holder is to provide a proper explanation of to the\n                    customer. 149    In other words, s 103A of the SFA does not\n                    prescribe that the provisions under Div 2 of Part V of the SFA applyonlyto “money or other assets” that are\n                    already being treated by the CMS licence holder as beneficially owned by the\n                    customer without the aid of statutory intervention. Further, in and of itself, s\n                    103A of the SFA does not set outwhat“money or other assets” a CMS licence holder is in fact\n                    “liable to account” for. Thus, there is no basis for the\n                    Liquidators to rely on s 103A to argue that the provisions in the SFA and SFR\n                    only apply to “money or other assets” which belong beneficially to\n                    the customer. Moreover, to my mind, this would run counter to the legislative\n                    purpose behind these provisions, which is to confer protection on investors and\n                    consumers (see [142] above). Little purpose would be served if Div 2 of Part V\n                    is confined to trust property already protected by equity. 150    More importantly, s 103A does not introduce\n                    any substantive obligations on CMS licence holders, which are to be found in\n                    other provisions, which I have set out at [132]–[137] above. I now turn to\n                    these specific provisions. To begin, it is useful to recap the wording of s 104\n                    of the SFA: 104.—(1) A holder of a\n                        capital markets services licence shall, to the extent that itreceives money or other assets from or on account of a\n                            customer— (a) do so on the basis that themoney or other assetsshall be applied\n                            solely for such purpose as may be agreed to by the customer, when or\n                            before it receives themoney or other\n                                assets; (b) pending such application, pay or\n                            deposit themoney or other assetsin such\n                            manner as may be prescribed; and (c) record and maintain a separate book\n                            entry for each customer in accordance with the provisions of this Act in\n                            relation to that customer’smoney or other\n                                assets. (2) The Authority may … make regulations in respect of all or any\n                        of the matters in this Division, including the handling ofmoney or other assetsby a holder of a capital\n                        markets services licence. [emphasis added in italics and in bold] 151    Plainly, the definition in s 103A does not\n                    lend itself to easy application within s 104 of the SFA. For example, where the\n                    phrase “money or other assets” is used within the larger phrase\n                    “receives money or other assets from or on account of a customer”,\n                    such as in s 104(1) of the SFA (marked in italics above), applying the\n                    definition in s 103A creates an overly tedious and illogical reading of the\n                    provisions. In this regard, s 103A expressly states that it does not apply where\n                    “the context otherwise requires”. 152    It should be noted that s 104(1) of the SFA\n                    did not originally include the words “on account of”. Also, s 104,\n                    as enacted, contained a definition of “money or other assets” in\n                    sub-section (3). In 2003, s 104(1) was amended to include the words “on\n                    account of”. The definition originally found in s 104(3) was also removed\n                    and re-enacted as the standalone section,viz, the\n                    current s 103A. Parliament explained that the amendment to include the words\n                    “on account of” in s 104(1) was to clarify that “the\n                    sectionalsoapplies to money or assets …\n                    received by a [CMS licence holder] on account of its customers” [emphasis\n                    added] (see Explanatory Statement to the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill\n                    (Bill No 15/2003)). Given that Parliament’s express intention was to make\n                    clear that the provisions in s 104(1) apply to money or assets receivedon account ofa customeras\n                        well asmoney or assets receivedfroma customer, the operative words in s 104 are whether money\n                    or assets arereceivedby a CMS licence holderfrom or on account ofits customers. Hence,\n                    where s 104(1)(a), (b) and (c) are concerned, the\n                    phrase “money or other assets” in these sub-sections must be read\n                    with reference to the overarching ambit of s 104(1) (ie, money or other assets received from or on account of a\n                    customer). 153    Under s 104(1) of the SFA, a broad level of\n                    protection is to be given to customers in respect of these money and assets\n                    which a CMS licence holder receives from or on account of a customer. However,\n                    under s 104(2) read with s 103A of the SFA, MAS also has the power to make rules\n                    concerning the handling of “money or other assets”. In fact, the\n                    bulk of protection is to be found in the SFR. 154    Under the SFR, different classes of assets\n                    are treated differently and given different protection. More specifically, money\n                    is treated differently from other forms of assets. Div 2 of Part III of the SFR\n                    sets out the regulations which apply to “customer’s moneys”,\n                    while Div 3 of Part III of the SFR concerns other assets to the exclusion of\n                    money. It is not disputed that we are only concerned with\n                    “customer’s moneys” in the present case. 155    In this regard, the main provisions that\n                    confer protection over customer’s moneys are regs 15 and 16 of the SFR\n                    (reproduced at [135]–[136] above). In my view, it is reg 16(1)(a) of the SFR whichspecificallycreates or imposes a statutory trust. Similar to\n                    reg 21(1)(a) of the CTR, reg 16(1)(a) of the SFR requires CMS licence holders to treat and\n                    deal with “all moneys received on account of its customer”as belonging to that customer. As I have explained\n                    above in the context of the CTR (see [78] above), the effect of the language of\n                    reg 16(1)(a), read with Parliament’s\n                    intention to protect customers’ moneys, is to create or impose a statutory\n                    trust over certain moneys by effectively stipulating that those moneys belong\n                    beneficially to the customer. This is also consistent with s 104A of the SFA,\n                    which prohibits a CMS licence holder from using these moneys beneficially in the\n                    course of its business. Regulation 16(1)(a)\n                    defines the property to which the trust attaches to as being “all moneys\n                    received [by a CMS licence holder] on account of its customer”. The\n                    further requirement to segregate the moneys is then found in reg 16(1)(b), and the prohibition against commingling the moneys\n                    or using it for cross-margining purposes in reg 16(1)(c). Here, I would point out that a precondition to the operation\n                    of reg 16(1) is that the money is held by the CMS licence holder. Indeed, the\n                    use of the phrase “receivedon account\n                    of” [emphasis added] in reg 16(1) presupposes that money is in the CMS\n                    licence holder’s hands. 156    Reg 15(2)(a)\n                    then specifies that “money received on account of a customer” of a\n                    CMS licence holder includes “moneyreceived from, or\n                        on account of, the customer in respect of … a transaction\n                    connected with leveraged foreign exchange trading” [emphasis added]\n                        (ie, the LFX transactions). Thus, where the\n                    LFX transactions are concerned, the statutory trust is created by reg\n                        16(1)(a) read with reg 15(2)(a) of the CTR over (i) money received from a customer in\n                    respect of a transaction connected with leveraged foreign exchange trading (limb\n                    (i) of the LFX trust) and (ii) money received on account of a customer in\n                    respect of a transaction connected with leveraged foreign exchange trading (limb\n                    (ii) of the LFX trust). Moneys which a customer places with MFGS as collateral\n                    or margins for LFX transactions are clearlymoneys received\n                        fromthe customer (within limb (i) of the LFX trust), and MFGS,\n                    by virtue of reg 16(1)(a) holds the moneys on\n                    trust for the customer and is only allowed to use such moneys for the purposes\n                    provided by reg 21 of the SFR. Once again, this affords more protection over a\n                    customer’s margins than a customer would otherwise have under the terms of\n                    the MTA alone (see cl A6.8 of the MTA at [45] above). 157    I pause to note that the phrase\n                    “received from, or on account of, the customer” in reg\n                        15(2)(a) echoes the operative words of s\n                    104(1) of the SFA (“receives money or other assets from or on account of\n                    a customer”). The issue to be considered is whether the money segregated\n                    to cover the Unrealised Profits, Forward Value and Ledger Balance C/F is\n                    “money received from, or on account of” the LFX customers, and\n                    therefore falls within the protection of the statutory trust under reg\n                        16(1)(a) of the SFR. As I have set out in [96]\n                    above, theOxford English Dictionarydefines\n                    “on account of” as “in consideration of, for the sake of,\n                    by reason of, because of”. Taken together, I am of the view that reg\n                        16(1)(a) and reg 15(2) of the SFR provide that\n                    a statutory trust arises over any money a CMS licence holder receivesfromor receivesforits\n                    customer. 158    In my view, the LFX customers’\n                    Unrealised Profits and Forward Valuedo notfall\n                    within Parliament’s intended scope of protection, and therefore of the\n                    statutory trust. To reiterate, the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value were\n                    choses in action against MFGS which vested in the LFX customers at all times.\n                    There wasno underlying moneywhich MFGS could\n                    receivefromits customer orforits customer in either instance. Before a trade was\n                    closed-out, a customer only had a contingent claim, and was not entitled to\n                    receive any money. MFGS was also not obliged to pay any money, as no obligation\n                    to pay had yet arisen. Even after a trade was closed-out and a Forward Value\n                    arose, MFGS’ obligation to pay those moneys, only materialised on the\n                    relevant Value Date. 159    Does the fact that MFGS segregated moneys\n                    amounting to the value of its obligation to the LFX customers in respect of the\n                    Unrealised Profits and Forward Value change the above analysis? In my opinion,\n                    it does not. These moneys were not placed by MFGS into the Customer Segregated\n                    Accounts to the credit of each customer’s respective account. Rather,\n                    these moneys, in accordance with reg 23 of the SFR, formed MFGS’\n                    “residual financial interest” in the Customer Segregated Accounts.\n                    Until MFGS’ payment obligation arrived on the Value Date, and MFGS paid\n                    the money to the account and credit of its customer, these moneys properly\n                    remained MFGS’ own funds to which no LFX customer could have a proprietary\n                    interest. These segregated moneys thus did not fall within the scope of the\n                    statutory trust imposed by reg 16(1)(a) of the\n                    SFR. 160    Vintage also argues that in interpreting\n                    whether the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value are received “on account\n                    of” the LFX customers, regard should be had to s 103A of the SFA which\n                    defines “money or other assets”, and in particular, the phrase\n                    “accruing therefrom” within the section. Vintage does not deal\n                    withwherethe money or assets accruefrom, but in line with its submission on the Bullion\n                    transactions (see [103] above), submits that the phrase should be defined as\n                    being that which a party isentitled toafter\n                    having done all that is required of it to earn that sum but which was not yet\n                    due or received. Vintage also does not submit on how s 103A interrelates with s\n                    104 of the SFA and regs 15 and 16 of the SFR. As explained, s 103A does not\n                    create or impose a statutory trust. Hence, even if I accept Vintage’s\n                    proposed interpretation of the term “accruing”, Vintage must still\n                    show that such funds fall within the scope of the statutory trust imposed by reg\n                        16(1)(a) of the SFR,ie, the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value must be shown to be\n                    moneyreceivedby MFGSon\n                        account ofVintage. For the reasons given above, the Unrealised\n                    Profits and Forward Value are not moneys received by MFGSforVintage. (5)   Whether the Ledger Balance C/F (attributable to LFX\n                transactions) is “money received on account of” a customer 161    Parties have accepted that the Ledger\n                    Balance C/F is held by MFGS on trust under the SFA and SFR for the LFX\n                    customers. For completeness, I briefly set out why I agree that the sum\n                    representing the Ledger Balance C/F is money which MFGSreceived for(ie, on account of)\n                    its customers under reg 16(1)(a) of the\n                    SFR. 162    Vintage points out that if money must\n                    actually bereceivedby MFGS, then the Ledger\n                    Balance C/F does not fall within the ambit of the statutory trust as this is\n                    money which was “paid or credited to Vintage after the relevant Value\n                    Date”, and not actually received by MFGS. In my view, given that the\n                    purpose of these provisions is to protect customer’s funds (see [142]\n                    above), the meaning of “received” must not be read so narrowly as\n                    to require a separate counterparty. Here, I also highlight Scott LJ’s\n                    analysis inMac-Jordanwhere he stated that the\n                    defendant’s obligation under the contract was to pay itself as trustee\n                    (see [64] above). 163    On the Value Date, MFGS is obliged to\n                    discharge its debt obligation to its customers under the terms of the MTA. MFGS\n                    is therefore required, by the terms of its contract with its customers, topaythe debt which is due and payable on that\n                    date. In order to discharge this obligation, MFGS could receive the money on the\n                    customer’s behalf. This receipt occurs when MFGS credits a\n                    customer’s Ledger Balance C/F with the Forward Value due on that date. The\n                    payment received from MFGS (as principal-payor) by MFGS (as payee on its\n                    customers’ behalf) is money receivedon account\n                        ofits customers and therefore subject to the statutory trust.\n                    This is largely in line with the discussion on the Bullion transactions above at\n                    [128]. 164    Regulations 15(2)(ii) and 16(2) (set out\n                    above at [135]–[136]) support this position. The effect of regs 15(2)(ii)\n                    and 16(2) is that moneyspaid to the customerdo\n                    not form moneys received on account of the customer and do not have to be paid\n                    into the trust account by the next business day after receipt of the money. The\n                    corollary of this is that if the moneys which ought to be paid arenotpaid to the customer, they should be\n                    “received on account of” the customer and deposited into a trust\n                    account on the next business day. On the Value Date, MFGS was obliged to pay its\n                    customers the realised profits from the close-out of the LFX transactions. To\n                    the extent that MFGS credited funds to the Ledger Balance C/F on the Value Date\n                    and did not pay the customers these moneys directly, I find that these are\n                    moneys which are received by MFGS on account of its customers. The amount\n                    standing in the Ledger Balance C/F is thus held on statutory trust by MFGS for\n                    the benefit of the LFX customers under reg 16(1)(a) of the SFR. There is a dispute over the amount that should stand\n                    in the Ledger Balance C/F, which will be covered in the discussion of the Value\n                    Date issue. Conclusion on the Statutory Trust issue 165    In conclusion, I find that the SFA, SFR, CTA\n                    and CTRdo notrequire MFGS to hold the segregated\n                    funds amounting to the value of the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value\n                    attributable to the LFX and Bullion transactions on trust for the LFX and\n                    Bullion customers.",
        "The Express Trust issue": "Parties’ submissions 166    In order to assert a proprietary right to\n                    the moneys in the Customer Segregated Accounts amounting to the value of the\n                    Unrealised Profits and Forward Value, Vintage argues, in the alternative, that\n                    MFGS has declared an express trust over these funds. 167    In this respect, Vintage’s case is\n                    that MFGSthoughtthat it was required by law to\n                    segregate and hold the moneys on trust, and accordingly did so. Vintage submits\n                    that there is ample evidence which shows that prior to winding up, MFGS held\n                    moneys representing the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value as if they belonged\n                    to the LFX and Bullion customers. In the circumstances, an express trust can be\n                    inferred from MFGS’ conduct in the ordinary course of business. Such\n                    conduct included the following: (a)     MFGS did not declare the Unrealised\n                        Profits and Forward Value of the LFX and Bullion customers as its\n                        liabilities and did not declare the money it segregated to cover the\n                        Unrealised Profits and Forward Value as its assets in its audited financial\n                        statements. In fact, in 2009 and 2010, the financial statements used the\n                        words “held in trust” to describe the money MFGS segregated to\n                        cover,inter alia, the LFX and Bullion\n                        customers’ Unrealised Profits and Forward Value. (b)     MFGS ensured on a daily basis,\n                        through the Seg Fund Statements, that sufficient money was segregated to\n                        cover,inter alia, the substantial Unrealised\n                        Profits and Forward Value of the LFX and Bullion customers. MFGS also\n                        calculated, through the Seg Fund Statements, its “residual financial\n                        interest” in the segregated funds, which did not include the\n                        Unrealised Profits and Forward Value of the LFX and Bullion\n                        customers. (c)     Vintage had the ability to withdraw sums in excess of its Ledger Balance\n                        C/F. This shows that MFGS considered that the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                        Value were Vintage’s proprietary moneys as of right, and therefore\n                        capable of withdrawal. (d)     MFGS’ directors and the Liquidators had previously\n                        taken the position that the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value from the\n                        LFX and Bullion transactions are segregated and trust moneys of\n                        Vintage. 168    Vintage also submits in the alternative that\n                    by cl A15.1 of the MTA (see above at [44]) MFGS expressly declared a trust in\n                    writing. 169    The Liquidators accept that MFGS had taken\n                    into account the quantum of the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value in\n                    ascertaining the sufficiency of the segregated funds maintained. However, their\n                    position is that MFGS did not intend to create a trust over its own money for\n                    the benefit of the LFX and Bullion customers in anticipation of meeting its\n                    obligations relating to the Unrealised Profits or Forward Value. The Liquidators\n                    say that there is no evidence of such an intention, which runs against\n                    commercial logic. Rather, they say that MFGS did so for “internal risk\n                    management” purposes, and to ensure that there was an adequate\n                    “operational float” in the Customer Segregated Accounts. In the\n                    alternative, the Liquidators submit thatifthis\n                    court finds that MFGS held the money in its Customer Segregated Accounts on\n                    trust to satisfy its Unrealised Profits and Forward Value obligations, the court\n                    should nonetheless exercise its equitable jurisdiction to set aside this trust\n                    on the ground of MFGS’ mistake. The applicable legal principles 170    It is settled law that in order for an\n                    express trust to arise, the three certainties being the certainty of intention,\n                    certainty of subject matter and certainty of objects must be\n                present. 171    The first certainty required is the\n                    certainty of intention. It must be clear that the settlor intended to create a\n                    trust, and subject the trust property to trust obligations, rather than do an\n                    act or impose obligations that are not trust obligations. As stated inSnell’s Equity(John McGhee QC gen ed) (Sweet\n                    & Maxwell, 32nd Ed, 2010) (“Snell’s\n                        Equity”) at para 22–013, this intention must be\n                    clear on two levels: first, the trustee’s duties must be intended to be\n                    legally enforceable and not merely social or moral obligations, and second, that\n                    the relationship is to involve trust duties, as opposed to other forms of\n                    relationships, such as a debtor and creditor relationship. 172    The easiest way to prove such an intention\n                    is where the trust is declared in writing through a trust instrument. However,\n                    trust instruments are not necessary in order to prove the certainty of\n                    intention. Courts have often found the certainty of intention to be satisfied,\n                    even in the context of insolvency, where no trust instrument existed (see,eg,In re Kayford\n                        Ltd[1975] 1 WLR 279). Thus, an intention to create a trust may\n                    be inferred by examining evidence of the alleged settlor’s words and\n                    conduct as well as the circumstances surrounding the alleged express trust, and\n                    through the interpretations of any agreements that the parties might have\n                    entered into (seeGuy Neale and others v Nine Squares Pty\n                        Ltd[2015] 1 SLR 1097 at [58]). 173    The commercial context must also not be\n                    overlooked. As stated by the Court of Appeal inHinckley\n                        Singapore Trading Pte Ltd v Sogo Department Stores (S) Pte Ltd (under\n                        judicial management)[2001] 3 SLR(R) 119 (“Sogo Department Stores”) at [33]: The ultimate question to decide is whether, in the light of the terms of\n                        the agreement, as exemplified by the actual arrangement, there was an\n                        intention to create a trust. No general rule may be laid down in this\n                        regard.In a case where there is no express term in the\n                            agreement on the question of trust, whether the equitable rules would be\n                            implied would depend onwhat may\n                            correctly be inferred to be the expectations of the parties in the light\n                            of the commercial context. … [emphasis added in\n                        italics and in bold italics] 174    Generally, courts are disinclined toward\n                    finding a trust relationship in everyday commercial transactions (seeNeste Oy v Lloyds Bank PLC[1983] 2 Lloyd’s Rep\n                    658 at 665). What is necessary is that there “must beclear evidencefrom what is said or done of an intention to\n                    create a trust” [emphasis added], being “an intention to dispose\n                    of a property or a fund so that somebody else to the exclusion of the disponent\n                    acquires the beneficial interest in it” (seePaul v\n                        Constance[1977] 1 WLR 527 at 531). In the context of insolvency,\n                    this is all the more crucial (Snell’s Equityat para 22–015): … The imposition of a trust, withoutstrong\n                            evidenceof an intention to declare one, would upset the\n                        usual proportionate distribution of assets in insolvency. … [emphasis\n                        added] 175    In this regard, the mere segregation of\n                    money is not conclusive of the intention to create a trust. The United Kingdom\n                    Supreme Court considered, in the case ofRe Lehman\n                        Brothers, the importance of segregation of client’s moneys.\n                    Lord Hope stated (at [2]): Under English law the mere segregation of money into separate bank\n                        accounts is not sufficient to establish a proprietary interest in those\n                        funds in anyone other than the account holder. A declaration of trust over\n                        the balances standing to the credit of the segregated accounts is needed to\n                        protect those funds in the event of the firm’s insolvency. Segregation\n                        on its own is not enough to provide that protection. … This point was also echoed by Lord Collins (at\n                    [186]): … under English law mere segregation of funds was not enough to\n                        protect those funds from the firm’s creditors in the event of its\n                        insolvency, and investors’ money could be safeguarded by segregation\n                        only if it was segregated in such a way that ownership remained with them,\n                        ie under a trust … 176    In my judgment, the principle stated by Lord\n                    Hope and Lord Collins above applies equally under Singapore law. Thus, the mere\n                    segregation of moneyper seis insufficient to\n                    prove an intention on the part of the alleged settlor to create a trust over the\n                    segregated funds. Clear and strong evidence must be shown that the alleged\n                    settlorintendedto hold these sums on trust for\n                    the benefit of another. 177    The second certainty is the certainty of\n                    subject matter. What this requires is that the assets which are to be the\n                    subject of the trust are identifiable and clearly defined. The\n                    beneficiary’s interest in the subject matter should also be sufficiently\n                    certain so that the trust may be executed in accordance with the settlor’s\n                    intentions. It is here that the segregation of the trust assets may play an\n                    important role in identifying the specific assets over which the trust arises.\n                    Oliver J stated the traditional position inRe London Wine Co\n                        (Shipper)[1986] PCC 121: I appreciate the point taken that the subject matter is part of a\n                        homogenous mass so that specific identity is of as little importance as it\n                        is, for instance, in the case of money. Nevertheless, as it seems to me,to create a trust it must be possible to ascertain\n                            with certainty not only what the interest of the beneficiary is to be\n                            but to what property it is to attach.[emphasis added] 178    The last certainty required is the certainty\n                    of objects. This means that the objects of the trust must also be clearly\n                    defined so as to enable the trustees to execute the trust in accordance with the\n                    settlor’s intention. 179    The main dispute between the parties which\n                    requires an examination of the factual matrix and documentary evidence is with\n                    respect to the certainty of intention,viz,\n                    whether there is clear and strong evidence that MFGS intended to create a trust\n                    in favour of the LFX and Bullion customers. Analysis and findings 180    Vintage’s alternative argument, being\n                    its reliance on cl A15.1 of the MTA, may be briefly dealt with first. It is\n                    clear, in my judgment, that there was no agreement between MFGS and its\n                    customers as to how or in what manner the Unrealised Profits or Forward Value\n                    were to be held or applied. Vintage’s reliance on cl A15.1 as being an\n                    express declaration of trust in writing, with respect, is untenable. Clause\n                    A15.1 of the MTA, the substance of which is set out at [44] above, merely states\n                    that MFGS shall place “Customer’s funds and assets” into a\n                    trust account. It also stipulates that customer’s funds and assets are to\n                    be kept separate from MFGS’ funds and assets. Hence, cl A15.1 only deals\n                    with the manner in which MFGS may deal with “Customer’s funds and\n                    assets” but does not indicate whether the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value would fall within such “funds and assets”. It is unhelpful\n                    for Vintage to assert that this court should interpret “funds and\n                    assets” as covering the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value without\n                    more. 181    In the absence of an express declaration of\n                    trust, and in the context of MFGS’ winding up, what must be shown in order\n                    to ground an intention to create an express trust isclear\n                        and strong evidenceof a course of conduct or the presence of\n                    circumstances from which it can be inferred that the settlor-trustee treated the\n                    property as if it were beneficially owned by the beneficiaries. 182    During oral submissions, Mr Thio urged me to\n                    be cautious when dealing with aspects of Mr Yap’s affidavits that\n                    purported to set out the “intentions” of MFGS because Mr\n                    Yap’s evidence in this respect was hearsay and contravened O 41 r 5 of the\n                    Rules of Court. Mr Thio points out that although a number of MFGS’ former\n                    directors were in Singapore at the time of the hearing, no affidavits were filed\n                    by the former directors, who were the persons best placed to give evidence on\n                    MFGS’ intentions at the material time the transactions were carried out.\n                    However, Mr Thio accepts that where documentary evidence exists, the documents\n                    speak for themselves. 183    It is true that this court has not had the\n                    benefit of evidence from any of the former directors or employees of MFGS. I\n                    accept that Mr Yap’s evidence on the true intentions of MFGS is not\n                    conclusive. In any event, evidence of MFGS’ intentions in segregating the\n                    amounts, even if given by a former director of the company, would not have been\n                    conclusive. It is the court’s task to ascertain from all the evidence,\n                    especially the documentary and undisputed evidence, whether MFGS had, at the\n                    material time, intended to create an express trust over moneys equivalent to the\n                    Unrealised Profits and Forward Value. 184    Before turning to consider Vintage’s\n                    arguments in further detail, an important distinction must be highlighted. An\n                    intention to hold moneys or propertyas required by the\n                        applicable laws and regulationsmay not be the same as an\n                    intention to create a trustin the general law of\n                        equity. As I have stated at [70]–[71] above, a statutory\n                    trust may not bear the full indicia of a trust recognised by law apart from\n                    statute. Hence, the mere fact that MFGS might have mistakenly believed that it\n                    had certain obligations under statute which it accordingly sought to discharge\n                    did notipso factomean that MFGS had equally\n                    intended for an express trust to arise under the normally applicable equitable\n                    principles. In my view, even if some of the evidence Vintage put forth coheres\n                    with the theory that MFGS intended to hold the moneys as it believed it was\n                    required to under the applicable statutes and regulations, the evidence does not\n                    go so far as to show that MFGS intended to be anexpress\n                        trusteeof the moneys equivalent to the Unrealised Profits and\n                    Forward Value on the LFX and Bullion customers’ behalf. 185    In this regard, two important facts stand\n                    out. First, MFGS commingled its own money with funds which Vintage alleges are\n                    held on trust for customers; and second, MFGS commingled funds between\n                    customers. To my mind, both these facts show that MFGS was acting in accordance\n                    with the provisions of the CTR and SFR. Although reg 21(1) of the CTR and reg\n                        16(1)(c) of the SFR do not allow MFGS to\n                    commingle customer’s funds with its own funds or any other funds, an\n                    exception to this general rule may be found in reg 21(4) of the CTR and reg\n                        23(1)(a) of the SFR. The exceptions allow a\n                    commodity broker or CMS licence holder respectively to advance its own funds to\n                    customer trust accounts (in MFGS’ case, the Customer Segregated Accounts)\n                    in order to prevent the accounts from becoming under-margined, cross-margined or\n                    under-funded. 186    Regulation 23(1)(b) of the SFR also allows a CMS licence holder to advance its\n                    own funds to the trust accounts to ensure the continued maintenance of that\n                    account with a financial institution or custodian as the case may be. Section\n                    30(4) of the CTA and reg 24 of the SFR then preserves the commodity\n                    broker’s or CMS licence holder’s “lawful claim or\n                    lien” to those funds. Where a commodity broker’s or CMS licence\n                    holder’s own funds have been advanced to customer trust accounts, reg\n                        21(3)(d) of the CTR and reg 21(e) of the SFR permits the commodity broker or CMS\n                    licence holder to reimburse itself the moneys which it has advanced into the\n                    trust accounts. Such funds have been referred to above as MFGS’\n                    “residual financial interest”. 187    Similarly, reg 21(2) of the CTR and reg\n                    16(4) of the SFR allow commodity brokers and CMS licence holders to commingle\n                    moneys as between customers. While cl A15.1 of the MTA provides that the\n                    customer’s “funds and assets … may be held commingled with\n                    excess funds or assets of other Customersin accordance with\n                        Applicable Laws”, it also stipulates that “MFGS\n                    shall keep all funds and other assets held by MFGS on trust for the Customerseparate fromthe funds and assets of\n                    MFGS” [emphasis added]. In commingling its own money with funds which\n                    MFGS held on trust for its customers in the Customer Segregated Accounts, and\n                    commingling funds between customers, MFGS was acting within the perimeters of\n                    the CTR and SFR, but was in fact in breach of cl A15.1 in relation to\n                    co-mingling of its own funds. 188    The fact that MFGS commingled its own funds\n                    with what Vintage alleges are funds held on express trust militates against a\n                    finding that MFGS intended to hold moneys equivalent to the Unrealised Profits\n                    and Forward Value on express trust for the LFX and Bullion customers. Channell J\n                    articulated the applicable principles inHenry v\n                        Hammond[1913] 2 KB 515 (“Henry v\n                        Hammond”) at 521, which was cited with approval by the\n                    Court of Appeal inSogo Department Storesat\n                    [18]: It is clear that if the terms upon which the person receives the money are\n                        that he is bound to keep it separate, either in a bank or elsewhere, and to\n                        hand that money so kept as a separate fund to the person entitled to it,\n                        then he is a trustee of that money and must hand it over to the person who\n                        is hiscestui que trust. If on the other handhe is not bound to keep the money\n                        separate, but isentitled to mix it with his\n                            own moneyand deal with it as he pleases, and when called\n                        upon to hand over an equivalent sum of money, then, in my opinion, he is not\n                        a trustee of the money, but merely a debtor. [emphasis added] 189    The Court of Appeal inSogo Department Storescontinued (at [22]): … it is clear that where under an arrangement there is\n                        no prohibition against the mixing of funds by the agent, that is a very\n                        significant consideration in the overall determination of the question\n                        whether there is a trust. In the absence of an express term creating a\n                        trust, the maintenance of a separate account by the agent is crucial to\n                        constituting the money as trust money: seeRe Nanwa Gold\n                            Mines Ltd… andRe Kayford\n                            Ltd… . Here we are reminded of the words of Slade J\n                        inRe Bond Worth Ltd… : ... where an alleged trustee has the right to mix tangible assets or\n                            moneys with his own other assets or moneys and to deal with them as he\n                            pleases, this is incompatible with the existence of a presently\n                            subsisting fiduciary relationship in regard to such particular assets or\n                            moneys. 190    The statement of principle inHenry v Hammondand the Court of Appeal’s analysis\n                    inSogo Department Storesshows that in searching\n                    for the presence of an intention to create an express trust in the absence of\n                    any express declaration, the general position is that the maintenance of a\n                    separate account with a prohibition (whether express or implied) against mixing\n                    lends much weight to the finding of an intention to create a trust. This is\n                    because such conduct shows that the legal holder of the money is not to have\n                    free disposal of it, which is consistent with an intention to confer beneficial\n                    ownership of the money on another. To the extent that cl A15.1 prohibited the\n                    mixing of MFGS’ assets and funds with those it held on trust, this shows\n                    that MFGS too recognised this principle. I also note that the mixing of a\n                    trustee’s own funds with those he holds on trust for a beneficiary, and\n                    the mixing of funds between beneficiaries, may also lead to further issues in\n                    the identification of property through the tracing process (see for example the\n                    discussion inBarlow Clowes International Ltd (in liq) and\n                        others v Vaughan and others[1992] 4 All ER 22 at 35–36 on\n                    the different methods of tracing through bank accounts). Thus in the normal\n                    course, the mixing of alleged trust funds between “beneficiaries”\n                    and with the “trustee’s” own funds is, in the absence of an\n                    express declaration of trust, likely to negative a finding of an intention to\n                    create a trust. 191    I will now deal specifically with the\n                    various pieces of evidence which Vintage uses to show that MFGS intended to hold\n                    the moneys equivalent to the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value on trust for\n                    the LFX and Bullion customers, before showing, on the whole, why MFGS’\n                    intention to create an express trust for the benefit of the LFX and Bullion\n                    customers in respect of the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value has been\n                    insufficiently proven. (1)   MFGS’ audited financial statements 192    Vintage relies on MFGS’ audited\n                    financial statements for the years ended 31 March 2009, 31 March 2010 and 31\n                    March 2011 (“AFS 2009”, “AFS 2010” and “AFS\n                    2011” respectively) to support its case that MFGS intended to hold moneys\n                    equivalent to the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value on express trust for the\n                    LFX and Bullion customers. 193    In order to aid the subsequent discussion,\n                    pertinent portions of the financial statements will be reproduced here. The\n                    “Current assets” section of AFS 2011 stated: Note2011US$ASSETSCurrent\n                                                assetsCash and bank\n                                    balances915,928,655Amount segregated for\n                                        customers9, 1129,051,154……120,261,902   194    As can be seen above, there is a\n                    cross-reference under the “Amount segregated for customers” in AFS\n                    2011 to Note 9 and Note 11 of the financial statements. Note 9 is titled\n                    “Cash and cash equivalents” and the following table is set out\n                    under it: 2011US$Cash and bank\n                                    balances15,928,655Amount segregated for\n                                        customers(Note 11)29,051,154Cash and cash equivalents per statement\n                                            of cash flows44,979,809   195    Note 11 is titled “Clients’\n                    segregated funds”, and sets out the following table: 2011US$Customer segregated\n                                                assets- Margin deposits with\n                                        brokers278,301,541- Margin deposits with\n                                        SGX-DC82,902,494- Bank balances372,159,342733,363,377Less:Company’s\n                                                assets segregated for\n                                        customers(29,051,154)704,312,223[emphasis added in\n                                        underline]   196    As the above tables demonstrate, in AFS\n                    2011, MFGS only declared the figure of US$29,051,154 as its assets under\n                    “amount segregated for customers” on its balance sheet. The\n                    location of this US$29m may be found under MFGS’ “customer\n                    segregated assets”, as Note 11 reveals. Note 11 also shows that MFGS did\n                    not declare on its balance sheet the additional sum of US$704,312,223, which it\n                    instead parked as “customer segregated assets”. Vintage submits\n                    that MFGS accounted for the LFX and Bullion customers’ Unrealised Profits\n                    and Forward Value under the “customer segregated assets”, which\n                    the Liquidators have not disputed. Although it is not set out above, I should\n                    also mention that MFGS did not declare the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value\n                    of its customers under the “Liabilities” portion of its balance\n                    sheet in AFS 2009, 2010 and 2011. 197    In AFS 2009 and 2010, the balance sheet\n                    contained a further section titled “Clients’ segregated\n                    accounts”. This section in AFS 2010 is reproduced below: Note2010US$…Clients’\n                                                segregated\n                                    accountsClients’ segregated\n                                        funds12643,254,368Less:Amountsheld in trustin respect of\n                                                clients22(643,254,368)[emphasis added in italics and bold\n                                            italics]   Except for the amounts in question, this section in\n                        AFS 2009 is materially similar. 198    Vintage submits that if the directors and\n                    auditors of MFGS considered that the moneys segregated to cover the LFX and\n                    Bullion customers’ Unrealised Profits and Forward Value were MFGS’\n                    own, these would have been declared under the “Assets” portion of\n                    the balance sheet. Correspondingly, if the directors and auditors believed that\n                    the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value of the LFX and Bullion customers were\n                    unsecured debts, they would have also declared this under the\n                    “Liabilities” portion of the balance sheet, which they did not do.\n                    Vintage also relies on the fact that the balance sheet of AFS 2009 and 2010\n                    stated that the segregated funds were “amounts heldin\n                        trustin respect of clients” [emphasis added]. Vintage\n                    submits that the only reasonable explanation for failing to account for these\n                    items on MFGS’ balance sheet and for stating that the amounts were heldin trustin AFS 2009 and 2010 was because the\n                    directors and auditors of MFGS considered that these moneys belonged to the LFX\n                    and Bullion customers. 199    The Liquidators submit that when AFS 2009,\n                    2010 and 2011 are read together with the Seg Fund Statements, the financial\n                    statements are consistent with the position that the amounts corresponding to\n                    the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value were reflected off-balance sheet as\n                    part of MFGS’ “notional accounting exercise to ensure sufficiency\n                    of liquidity and to ensure an adequate operational float”. MFGS had\n                    treated all its liabilities to customers as a “global sum without\n                    stratification”, regardless of whether these amounts were held on trust\n                    for each respective class of customers. According to the Liquidators, this\n                    “global treatment” meant that the aggregate sum was considered\n                    off-balance sheet, with the necessary disclosures made in the financial\n                    statements. However, the fact that MFGS did so could not constitute evidence\n                    that MFGS considered that the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value were\n                    proprietary moneys belonging to the LFX and Bullion customers. 200    While Vintage points out that audited\n                    financial statements should reflect the true state of affairs of a company,\n                    neither Vintage nor the Liquidators make submissions on any specific accounting\n                    conventions as to when assets and liabilities of a company may be held\n                    off-balance sheet, and what this might entail. In the circumstances, I proceed\n                    on the assumption that the accounting conventions do not dictate any particular\n                    conclusion and apply the legal principles accordingly. 201    The essential question to be answered is\n                    whether MFGS’ conduct in excluding these segregated funds from its balance\n                    sheet in AFS 2009, 2010 and 2011 is evidence of an intention to hold the same onexpresstrust for the benefit of the LFX and\n                    Bullion customers. It may be recalled that in order to show the requisite\n                    certainty of intention, it must be shown clearly and strongly that MFGS intended\n                    to createlegally enforceable trust duties, which\n                    are fiduciary in nature. In essence, Vintage must show that MFGS intended the\n                    LFX and Bullion customers to havebeneficial\n                        ownershipof the segregated funds. 202    InRe English &\n                        American Insurance Co Ltd[1994] 1 BCLC 649, Harman J held that\n                    sums received by an insurance company in connection with the insurance coverage\n                    provided to the members of the Structural Engineers’ Professional\n                    Indemnity Association Ltd were held on trust for the association’s members\n                    even though such funds had been included as part of the company’s balance\n                    sheet. Clause 4 of the agreement between the parties stated: The company agrees that all sums received by the company in respect of\n                        specified insurance business and all assets and reserves relating to the\n                        specified insurance business shall be segregated from all other income,\n                        assets and reserves of the company and shall be applied solely for the\n                        purposes of the specified insurance business and similarly all debts and\n                        liabilities shall be segregated from the debts and liabilities relating to\n                        all other business of the company. 203    Harman J cited the principle set out inHenry v Hammond(quoted at [188] above), and\n                    held that on that basis, cl 4 of the agreement was a term which equity would\n                    classify as creating a trust relationship (at 651). Thus, the subsequent conduct\n                    of the company in including the funds on its balance sheet could not prevail\n                    against “the clear evidence of the earlier intention and constitution of\n                    the fund as a trust fund” (at 653). In other words, how funds are\n                    accounted for on the balance sheet is not necessarily conclusive of their legal\n                    character. 204    During oral submissions, Mr Thio accepted\n                    that the fact that amounts were not reflected on MFGS’ balance sheet did\n                    not conclusively mean that they were the beneficial property of MFGS’\n                    customers, but submitted that it took the parties to “match\n                    point”, and that the presence of other sources of evidence such as the\n                    Seg Fund Statements, MFGS’ treatment of the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value in the Daily FX Activity Statements, and the Liquidators’ alleged\n                    admissions won the match for Vintage. 205    In my judgment, both the Liquidators and\n                    Vintage are right to accept that the fact that sums were held off-balance sheet\n                    did not inevitably lead to the conclusion that those moneys were intended to be\n                    held on express trust for the LFX and Bullion customers. An equally plausible\n                    conclusion is that MFGS segregated its own money in order to ensure sufficient\n                    liquidity to meet its contingent and future debt obligations,viz, the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value. While MFGS might\n                    have,from an accounting perspective, considered\n                    that it was not free to deal with these segregated moneys which it had set aside\n                    as a prudential measure to ensure that funds would be available to satisfy its\n                    debt obligations as and when they fell due, it did not necessarily follow that\n                    MFGS intended its customers to have alegally\n                        enforceablebeneficial interest in the same, with the\n                    accompanying fiduciary obligations on its part. 206    That being said, did this fact nonetheless\n                    take parties to “match point”? With respect, I do not think so. In\n                    the first instance, I find it significant that the “amounts held in trust\n                    in respect of clients”, an item which was present in both AFS 2009 and\n                    2010 (see [197] above), was left out of AFS 2011. AFS 2011, being MFGS’\n                    most recent financial statement, is the statement most relevant in ascertaining\n                    MFGS’ intention in respect of the funds Vintage asserts are held by MFGS\n                    on express trust for it. The fact that the phrase was left out of AFS 2011\n                    strengthens the Liquidators’ case that the fact of segregation did not\n                    mean that the amounts are being held on trust. 207    Also, the audited financial statements\n                    clearly show that MFGS placed its own assets in the funds it segregated for\n                    clients (see Note 11 to AFS 2011, reproduced at [195] above). For the reasons I\n                    have given at [184]–[190] above, this is an important fact which militates\n                    against any finding of intention on MFGS’ part to create a trust over\n                    amounts equivalent to the LFX and Bullion customers’ Unrealised Profits\n                    and Forward Value. Although MFGS did designate certain accounts to be Customer\n                    Segregated Accounts, which would go towards showing that MFGS maintained\n                    separate bank accounts for the benefit of the LFX and Bullion customers, the\n                    fact that MFGS did not keep its own fundscompletely\n                        separate, but placed (on Vintage’s argument,at least) US$29m of cash and cash equivalents within its\n                    “Clients’ segregated funds” (reflected in AFS 2011) as it\n                    was entitled to do under the CTR and SFR (but notably, was not allowed to do\n                    under the MTA), is more consistent with an intention to comply with the\n                    applicable statutes and regulations, rather than with an intention to hold the\n                    amounts as a private law trustee for the LFX and Bullion customers. The audited\n                    financial statements are therefore not clear and strong evidence of an intention\n                    on MFGS’ part to create a trust of the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value for those customers. (2)   The Seg Fund Statements 208    In advancing its case, Vintage also relies\n                    heavily on the Seg Fund Statements. First, Vintage points out that MFGS ensured\n                    through a daily preparation of the Seg Fund Statement that sufficient moneys\n                    were segregated to cover the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value of the LFX and\n                    Bullion customers. This point is not disputed by the Liquidators. 209    Second, Vintage submits that the\n                    computations being performed on a daily basis through the Seg Fund Statements\n                    are the precise computations required by the CTR and SFR, and that this fact\n                    strongly suggests that MFGS was ensuring that sufficient funds were segregated\n                    to cover the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value because it believed it was\n                    required to do so by law, and not for operational reasons as the Liquidators\n                    allege. While the exact language used in the CTR and SFR is different, broadly,\n                    both reg 22(12) of the CTR and reg 37(1) of the SFR require a commodity broker\n                    or CMS licence holder to compute at the close of each business day: (a)     the total amount of money deposited\n                        in trust accounts; (b)     the total amount of money required to be deposited in trust accounts;\n                        and (c)     the\n                        commodity broker’s or CMS licence holder’s residual interest in\n                        the accounts or funds. 210    The discussion will be prefaced by a brief\n                    description of the Seg Fund Statement. The Seg Fund Statement was part of a\n                    prescribed form which MFGS submitted to MAS on a quarterly basis as part of its\n                    obligations as a CMS licence holder under the SF(FM)R (see [16] above). For ease\n                    of reference, a sample of MFGS’ Seg Fund Statement dated 31 March 2011 is\n                    annexed to this judgment at Annex A. There are two sections to the Seg Fund\n                    Statements. The first section is titled “Segregation\n                    Requirements”, with six separate items set out thereunder. 211    A number of items in the first section of\n                    the Seg Fund Statement are important and should be explained. First, item 1 of\n                    the Seg Fund Statement sets out the “Net Ledger Balances in Accounts of\n                    Customers”. According to Mr Yap, this item was calculated based on an\n                    aggregate of the Ledger Balance C/F under the accounts of MFGS’ customers\n                    at the particular date. Item 2, which set out “Securities (at fair value)\n                    Belonging to Customers”, did not apply to MFGS and no sums were reflected\n                    under that heading in the ordinary course. Item 3 set out the “Net\n                    Unrealised Profit/(Loss) in Open Contracts”. Mr Yap explains that MFGS\n                    took into account the aggregate Unrealised Profits and Forward Value of the LFX\n                    and Bullion transactions in calculating item 3. Item 4 sets out the “Net\n                    Equity of Customers”, being a sum of the first three items. 212    Item 5 then sets out the “Deficit\n                    Accounts”, being the aggregate of accounts of customers that were in\n                    deficit. The heading of item 6 under the first section of the Seg Fund Statement\n                    states “Amount Required to be Segregated”. The amount reflected\n                    under this item is the sum of the funds represented under items 4 (which in turn\n                    is the sum of items 1, 2, 3) and 5. Mr Yap also deposed in his eighth affidavit\n                    that the amount under item 6 is consistent with the aggregate of the Total\n                    Account Equity under the accounts of MFGS’ customers as at that particular\n                    date. By way of reminder, the Total Account Equity is the aggregate sum of the\n                    Unrealised Profits, Forward Value and Ledger Balance C/F as reflected in the\n                    “Financial Statement” section of the Daily FX Activity Statement.\n                    Insofar as the “Net Unrealised Profit/(Loss) in Open Contracts”\n                        (ie, item 3), which covers the LFX and Bullion\n                    customers’ Unrealised Profits and Forward Value, is used in the\n                    calculation of the “Amount Required to be Segregated” under item\n                    6, the first section of the Seg Fund Statementappearsto require MFGS to segregate moneys to cover the LFX and\n                    Bullion customers’ Unrealised Profits and Forward Value. 213    However, it is important to recognise that\n                    the Seg Fund Statement, which is prepared under the SF(FM)R, is a financial\n                    reporting device. It does not (and cannot) prescribe what is to be held by MFGS\n                    on statutory trust for its customers. What is required to be segregated is\n                    governed by the CTA and CTR (in the case of Bullion transactions) and the SFA\n                    and SFR (in the case of LFX transactions). I have dealt with this at length\n                    above (see [72]–[165]). The words used in the first section of the Seg\n                    Fund Statement, therefore, should not be taken to change or alter the scope and\n                    operation of the statutory trust which is imposed by the applicable statutes and\n                    the CTR and SFR. Thus, the fact that the words “amountrequired to besegregated” are used in item 6 of the Seg\n                    Fund Statement cannot,ipso facto, lead to the\n                    conclusion that the funds stated here by MFGSmustbe held by MFGS on statutory trust for the LFX and Bullion customers, if such\n                    funds do not fall within the scope of the statutory trusts under the CTR or\n                    SFR. 214    The second section is titled\n                    “Location of Segregated Funds”. This section sets out where the\n                    “Amounts Required to be Segregated” (ie, item 6) are in fact located. These include deposits in\n                    segregated bank accounts (see item 8) and receivables from margin deposits with\n                    clearing houses and other parties (see items 10 and 12). The total amount of the\n                    sums segregated is then reflected under item 15. A CMS licence holder is then\n                    required to reflect the difference between the total amount segregated (item 15)\n                    and the amount required to be segregated (item 6) under item 16 as\n                    “Excess/(Deficiency) Funds in Segregation”. A positive number\n                    indicates that the CMS licence holder has segregated more funds than it was,by the first section of the Seg Fund\n                    Statement, required to segregate. A negative number indicates that\n                    the CMS licence holder is,by the first section of the Seg\n                        Fund Statement, required to segregate more funds that it has in\n                    fact segregated. 215    A perusal of the Seg Fund Statement reveals\n                    that item 16 (“Excess/(Deficiency) Funds in Segregation”) isnotequivalent to MFGS’ “residual\n                    financial interest” in itsCustomer Segregated\n                        Accounts, contrary to Vintage’s contention. One should note\n                    that item 15 doesnotrepresent the total amount\n                    of cash segregated on behalf of MFGS’ customers in bank accounts, as it\n                    includes both net equities with futures brokers and other receivables. The\n                    excess or deficiency (as the case may be) in item 16 can thus be attributed to a\n                    number of factors, which includes,inter alia, (i)\n                    MFGS advancing its own moneys to the Customer Segregated Accounts under item 8,\n                    (ii) an excess or deficiency of receivables under items 10 and 12, (iii) an\n                    excess or deficiency of net equities from futures brokers under item 11, or (iv)\n                    a combination of the above. It is therefore entirely possible for MFGS to have\n                    advanced more of its own funds into the Customer Segregated Accounts than the\n                    amount that is reflected under item 16. Thus, the amount reflected under item 16\n                    is not the same as the amount of MFGS’own moneyswhich it had advanced to its Customer\n                    Segregated Accounts as it was permitted to do under the CTR and SFR. Hence,\n                    Vintage is wrong to assert that the computations performed by MFGS through the\n                    Seg Fund Statement are the “precise computations required by the relevant\n                    legislations/regulations” (see [209] above) since it is not evident from\n                    the face of the Seg Fund Statements whether item 16 records MFGS’s\n                    “residual financial interest” in the Customer Segregated\n                    Accounts. 216    The LFX and Bullion Report states that the\n                    Seg Fund Statement was prepared by MFGS as part of its “internal risk\n                    management procedure” to ensure that a sufficient buffer was maintained\n                    in the Customer Segregated Accounts to prevent inadvertent cross-margining\n                        (ie, the process by which excess funds of one\n                    customer is used to satisfy another customer’s obligation). In line with\n                    this, the Liquidators submit that the Seg Fund Statement was merely apro formastatement (ie, a\n                    financial statement which is prepared on an “as if” basis). Mr\n                    Yeap submits that MFGS managed its risk by ensuring that it had sufficient funds\n                    to pay off all its liabilities (including contingent and future debts) in the\n                    putative situation where these liabilities all crystallised at the same time. To\n                    that end, MFGS always ensured that there would be a positive figure at item 16\n                    of the Seg Fund Statement. 217    In my judgment, MFGS’ preparation of\n                    the Seg Fund Statement on a daily basis is not clear and unambiguous evidence\n                    that MFGS intended to hold money equivalent to the Unrealised Profits and\n                    Forward Value on an express trust for the LFX and Bullion customers. In Mr\n                    Yeap’s words, there were “too many permutations” and many\n                    things that were in “constant flux” for anything to be ascertained\n                    with precision. I agree. The Seg Fund Statement does not clearly distinguish\n                    which funds are MFGS’ own funds, from the funds MFGS holds on trust (if\n                    any). The Seg Fund Statement is merely an accounting and financial reporting\n                    device which MAS required CMS licence holders to prepare as part of its\n                    regulatory framework. In and of itself, the Seg Fund Statement could not confer\n                    more rights on the customers of CMS licence holders than were prescribed by the\n                    applicable statutes and regulations. By the same token, the Seg Fund Statement\n                    itself is not an express declaration of trust on MFGS’ part. (3)   The Daily FX Activity Statements 218    Vintage also points to three other aspects\n                    of how MFGS allowed Vintage to deal with its Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value, to show that MFGS treated the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value as\n                    Vintage’s moneys. As evidenced in the Daily FX Activity Statements, these\n                    were that MFGS: (a)     allowed withdrawal of funds by\n                        Vintage which exceeded the Ledger Balance C/F; (b)     did not charge interest on the sums withdrawn\n                        which exceeded the Ledger Balance C/F, but only charged interest when a\n                        customer incurred a Margin Deficiency; and (c)     factored in the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                        Value when calculating Vintage’s Margin Excess or Margin\n                        Deficiency. 219    It is clear from the documentary evidence\n                    and Daily FX Activity Statements that MFGS took into account the Unrealised\n                    Profits and Forward Value in accounting for a customer’s margin\n                    requirements. MFGS would only issue a margin call if a customer’s Total\n                    Account Equity fell below the necessary margins. No margin call would be issued\n                    even if the Ledger Balance C/F was in negative territory if there were\n                    sufficient Unrealised Profits and Forward Value to cover the margin\n                    requirements. In the same vein, MFGS allowed withdrawal of funds by Vintage\n                    which exceeded the Ledger Balance C/F and did not charge interest on those\n                    excess withdrawals. Also, MFGS only charged interest when a customer incurred a\n                    Margin Deficiency (ie, where the sums in a\n                    customer’s Total Account Equity fell below the necessary margins which\n                    MFGS required a customer to maintain). The question I have to answer is whether\n                    these facts show that MFGS held the Total Account Equity (or at least the\n                    Forward Value and Ledger Balance C/F) on trust for the LFX and Bullion\n                    customers. 220    The Liquidators explain that although\n                    Vintage did withdraw from its account moneys exceeding its Ledger Balance C/F,\n                    this withdrawal was not in respect of any proprietary moneys owned by Vintage.\n                    Rather, Mr Yeap explains that any withdrawn sum which exceeded the Ledger\n                    Balance C/F was an “advance” made by MFGS by way of early payment\n                    of MFGS’ obligations which would otherwise only be payable on Value Date.\n                    To support this point, the Liquidators point out that the\n                    “withdrawn” amount was applied only against the Ledger Balance C/F\n                    so as to bring the Ledger Balance C/F into negative territory, and was not\n                    applied against the Forward Value or Unrealised Profits. 221    Mr Thio disputes Mr Yeap’s\n                    “advance” theory. He submits that if such a sum was truly an\n                    advance or early payment made by MFGS to Vintage, it was not commercially\n                    sensible for MFGS to have neglected to charge interest on the same, given that\n                    the deficiency in the Ledger Balance C/F on these occasions ran in the millions,\n                    and points out that MFGS charged interest whenever its customers’ margins\n                    were in deficit even though the deficit might not have been large. Mr Thio also\n                    submits that while MFGS is allowed under the CTR and SFR to make payment of sums\n                    to customers (see reg 21(3)(a) of the CTR and reg\n                        21(a) or (d) of\n                    the SFR), it is not permitted to advance or lend moneys. Thus, Mr Thio submits\n                    that only two possibilities existed: either the Total Account Equity of the LFX\n                    and Bullion customers is held on trust, or at least the Forward Value and Ledger\n                    Balance C/F are held on trust by MFGS for its customers (as the numbers also\n                    supported the latter interpretation). 222    I do not think that the above facts lead\n                    inexorably to the conclusion that MFGS held the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value on trust for the LFX and Bullion customers. For one, the fact that MFGS\n                    factored in the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value in calculating a\n                    customer’s margin excess or deficiency was but a reasonable practice. A\n                    margin requirement is in essence security required by MFGS for keeping a certain\n                    position open. The Unrealised Profits and Forward Value, being choses in action\n                    an LFX or Bullion customer has against MFGS, were values which MFGS could\n                    properly take into account in deciding whether a customer’s margin was\n                    sufficient. 223    Indeed, it seems to me consistent with\n                    commercial realitynotto require a customer to\n                    put in further funds with MFGS just because his or her Ledger Balance C/F fell\n                    below the margin requirements if the customer possessed choses in action against\n                    MFGS,viz, the Unrealised Profits or Forward\n                    Value, the value of which exceeded the margin requirements. Moreover, the fact\n                    that MFGS took this into account did not mean that Vintage was entitled toactual money. 224    In support of its argument that it was free\n                    to deal with its Unrealised Profits and Forward Value, Vintage refers me only to\n                    two specific Daily FX Activity Statements which document Vintage’s\n                    withdrawals of amounts exceeding its Ledger Balance C/F, being the Daily FX\n                    Activity Statements of 5 May 2011 and 6 May 2011. I find it pertinent that\n                    although the sums withdrawn exceeded the Ledger Balance C/F, this excess was\n                    adequately covered by the Forward Value, which consisted of sums with Value\n                    Dates of 9 May 2011 and 10 May 2011 respectively. This is consistent with the\n                    Liquidators’ submissions that the withdrawal was an advance by MFGS to\n                    Vintage by way of early payment of MFGS’s payment obligations vis-à-vis\n                    the Forward Value, a crystallised future debt, which would otherwise have been\n                    paid only on the relevant Value Date. It would have been clear to MFGS when\n                    making the advance on 5 and 6 May 2011 that although the advance exceeded the\n                    available funds in the Ledger Balance C/F, any shortfall in the Ledger Balance\n                    C/F would shortly be repaid on 9 and 10 May 2011 when the Forward Value became\n                    due and payable and paid into the Ledger Balance. 225    In this regard, whilst the Daily FX Activity\n                    Statements of 9 and 10 May 2011 have not been produced in evidence, it is clear\n                    from Vintage’s May 2011 interest breakdown statement which Mr Yap produced\n                    in his fourteenth affidavit filed in OS 289 that by 10 May 2011, the Ledger\n                    Balance C/F was no longer negative. Another key fact is that the withdrawal was\n                    (as evidenced by the Daily FX Activity Statements) applied only against the\n                    Ledger Balance C/F andnotagainst the Unrealised\n                    Profits or Forward Value. This showed that when Vintage withdrew funds in excess\n                    of the Ledger Balance C/F, it incurred a debt obligation to MFGS. If the sums\n                    covering the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value had in truth been held on\n                    trust by MFGS for Vintage, these payments made on 5 and 6 May 2011 by MFGS to\n                    Vintage which were in excess of Vintage’s Ledger Balance C/F would have\n                    been a payment of moneys made to its rightful beneficial owner, and no debt\n                    obligation would have been incurred by Vintage to MFGS. This is additional\n                    corroboration of the position that an LFX or Bullion customer did not have the\n                    unfettered ability to deal with the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                Value. 226    In my view, the Daily FX Activity Statements\n                    do not show that MFGS intended to hold the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value\n                    or any equivalent moneys on trust for Vintage or its other LFX or Bullion\n                    customers. The advances made by MFGS to Vintage which exceeded Vintage’s\n                    Ledger Balance C/F on 5 and 6 May 2011 were more in line with an administrative\n                    and commercial decision by MFGS to advance funds to an important and high-value\n                    customer like Vintage with the knowledge that it would be repaid from the\n                    Forward Value in the matter of a few days. This may also explain why interest\n                    was not charged against the negative Ledger Balance C/F. 227    I am also of the opinion that the CTR and\n                    SFR do not prohibit the making of such advances. Since the CTR and SFR do not\n                    require MFGS to hold moneys equivalent to the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value on trust for the LFX and Bullion customers, to the extent that MFGS placed\n                    moneys in its Customer Segregated Accounts to cover these obligations, this was\n                    MFGS’ “residual financial interest” that it is entitled to\n                    withdraw under reg 21(3)(d) of the CTR and reg\n                        21(e) of the SFR as long as the withdrawal\n                    does not result in a customer’s account becoming under-margined or\n                    under-funded. Regulation 23(3) of the SFR also expressly allows money belonging\n                    to a CMS licence holder to be used to pay its customer. (4)   Alleged admissions by the Liquidators and former directors\n                of MFGS 228    Vintage submits that the Liquidators and\n                    former directors of MFGS have previously taken the position that MFGS treated\n                    the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value as being held on trust for the LFX and\n                    Bullion customers. This can be seen from,inter\n                        alia: (a)     statements made by Mr Rajendra\n                        Bhambhani, the Managing Director of MFGS (“Mr Bhambhani”),\n                        that MFGS had always treated the accrued profits of its customers as\n                        segregated moneys; (b)     statements made by Mr Yap and other documentary evidence that showed\n                        that MFGS treated US$477m worth of funds (which presumably included the\n                        amounts segregated to cover Unrealised Profits and Forward Value) as being\n                        held on trust for customers; (c)     the treatment of the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                        Value in the Daily FX Activity Statements; and (d)     statements made by Mr Yap that “excess\n                        margins” were held on trust for customers. 229    I have dealt with the treatment of the\n                    Unrealised Profits and Forward Value in the Daily FX Activity Statements above\n                    (see [218]–[227]) and will not reprise what has been said, except to\n                    repeat that I am not persuaded by Vintage’s reliance on the Daily FX\n                    Activity Statements. I will deal with the “excess margins” point\n                    below at [284]–[289] when addressing the Margin Excess issue. Hence, in\n                    this section, I will only discuss items (a) and (b) mentioned\n                above. 230    In oral submissions, Vintage did not pursue\n                    the fact that statements had been made by Mr Bhambhani and other former\n                    directors/officers of MFGS to Vintage. In any event, Mr Vinod Puranmal Bansal\n                    (“Mr Vinod”) who filed an affidavit on behalf of Vintage attesting\n                    to this fact, did not provide any objective or documentary evidence proving the\n                    fact that these statements were in fact made. While not casting doubt on the\n                    veracity Mr Vinod’s evidence, the lack of documentary basis for these\n                    assertions means that they must be treated with caution. I therefore do not\n                    derive much assistance from Mr Vinod’s evidence in this\n                regard. 231    A stronger basis for Vintage’s\n                    arguments, which it understandably relies on to greater effect, is documentary\n                    evidence which allegedly shows that MFGS and the Liquidators considered that\n                    US$477m (a sum which included the value of the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value) were “Customer’s Funds” which were held on trust by\n                    MFGS for the LFX and Bullion customers. Such documentary evidence include,inter alia: (a)     Mr Yap’s first affidavit\n                        filed in support of OS 22; (b)     a statement of affairs certified by one of MFGS’\n                        directors on 9 December 2011 (“the Statement of\n                        Affairs”); (c)     the Seg Fund Statement dated 31 October 2011; and (d)     a presentation at a creditor’s\n                        meeting dated 28 May 2012 prepared by the Liquidators (“the\n                        Presentation”). 232    I have reproduced the order made by the\n                    court in OS 22 at [23] above. In that order, the court authorised the\n                    then-provisional liquidators to distribute “the segregated and\n                    proprietary funds of customers as may be accountable by MFGS to its customers\n                    … in the control of the Provisional Liquidators … an amount of up\n                    to US$350million”. In support of the OS 22 application, Mr Yap filed an\n                    affidavit (“Mr Yap’s OS 22 affidavit”) where he stated the\n                    following: 18.In accordance with the provisions of the SFA and\n                            its related regulations … and the terms and conditions of the MTA\n                            (specifically, clause 15 of the MTA), the funds received by\n                        MFGS from its customers (including any excess margins) were to be held on\n                        trust for such customers by MFGS.Funds provided by a\n                            customer were held for that customer in trust accounts, and …\n                            segregated from MFGS’ own funds or assets, i.e. the\n                            Customer’s Funds.… 19. These funds held in trust accounts were commingled as between the\n                        customers, as permitted under Regulation 16(4) of the [SFR] and clause 15.1\n                        of the MTA, and were utilised by MFGS for purposes of funding the margins\n                        and settlement of its customers’ respective positions. To this end,\n                        MFGS maintained various customer segregated accounts with both local and\n                        offshore financial institutions, as well as counter-parties, correspondent\n                        brokers, and clearing members, both in Singapore and abroad. As at\n                            31stOctober 2011 and based on the books and\n                        records of MFGS,the aggregate Customer’s Funds\n                            held by MFGS amounted to about US$477 million(based on the\n                        then prevailing marked-to-market values). [emphasis added in italics and in\n                        bold italics] 233    The inference from Mr Yap’s above\n                    statement is that a sum of US$477m was held on trust for MFGS’ customers.\n                    The Seg Fund Statement dated 31 October 2011 in turn sets out the “Amount\n                    required to be segregated” under item 6 as a sum of US$476,767,804. One\n                    would recall that in calculating item 6, MFGS took into account the Total\n                    Account Equity, which would include the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value\n                    (see above at [212]). This exact figure of US$476,767,804 is also set out in the\n                    Statement of Affairs as the “Balances owing partly secured\n                    creditors”. In the Presentation in May 2012 made to the creditors of MFGS\n                    by the Liquidators, the sum of US$476,768,000 was stated to be available for\n                        “partly secured creditors”, and\n                    also stated to be the value ofsegregated funds(as opposed to MFGS’ own funds) owing to creditors and\n                customers. 234    As the sum of US$477m largely corresponds to\n                    the sum of US$476,767,804 in the 31 October 2011 Seg Fund Statement, Vintage\n                    contends that this must mean that MFGS intended to hold, and always held, the\n                    Unrealised Profits and Forward Value on trust for the LFX and Bullion customers.\n                    Vintage complains that given that there was amongst other things (i) no\n                    qualification in OS 22 that the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value were not\n                    held on trust for the LFX and Bullion customers; and (ii) no qualification that\n                    any portion of the US$477m was not held on trust for the LFX and Bullion\n                    customers, coupled with the position taken by the Liquidators at the\n                    Presentation that the US$477m was segregated funds and not MFGS’ own\n                    funds, the Liquidators in now submitting that the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value arenotheld on trust, have resiled from\n                    their previous position. 235    Much of the evidence Vintage relies on (for,eg, the Presentation, the Statement of Affairs\n                    and Mr Yap’s OS 22 affidavit) occurred post-liquidation. To the extent\n                    that Vintage suggests that these pieces of evidence showed that the Liquidators\n                    treated the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value as being held on trust, and by\n                    so doing created an express trust post-liquidation, this would be in direct\n                    contravention of the winding-up regime in Singapore (see s 300 of the Companies\n                    Act). Against the argument that these pieces of evidence show that MFGS always\n                    considered itself as holding the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value on trust,\n                    a number of other comments may be made. 236    First, the Presentation and the Statement of\n                    Affairs reflect the sum of approximately US$477m as liabilities owed to\n                    “partly secured creditors”. This may give rise to two meanings. On\n                    the one hand, it may mean that the sum reflectsonlythe secured claims of these “partly secured\n                    creditors”. On the other hand, it may also be read to mean that the sum\n                    is made up ofallthe claims of the “partly\n                    secured creditors”, some of which were unsecured claims. The presence of\n                    such ambiguity in the Presentation and Statement of Affairs counts against a\n                    finding of clear and strong evidence of an intention on MFGS’ part to hold\n                    these sums on trust for its customers. It is therefore possible thatnot allof the US$477m was held on trust for MFGS’\n                    customers. 237    Second, an examination of the contents of Mr\n                    Yap’s OS 22 affidavit clearly negatives Vintage’s submission that\n                    there was no qualification therein. In respect of the LFX and Bullion customers,\n                    Mr Yap set out at para 64 to 67 of his OS 22 affidavit a number of pertinent\n                    points, some of which are reproduced here: 64. … MFGS acted as principal to customers who traded in LFX and\n                        bullion, and margins placed by such customers and realised profits (actually\n                        paid by MFGS in respect of such LFX and bullion transactions) would be paid\n                        into MFGS’ customer segregated accounts (i.e. would be and are\n                        compromised in the Available Customers’ Funds).However, LFX and bullion customers may also have unrealised profits and\n                            losses and/or realised profitswhich were\n                            not paidinto MFGS’ customer\n                            segregated accounts. … 67.Anyrealised profits\n                            not yet paidby MFGS and not comprised in\n                            the Available Customers’ Funds, and any estimatedunrealised profits(if applicable)would notbe taken into account under the proposed\n                            Interim Distribution as such monies arenotcomprised in the Available\n                            Customers’ Funds.Such monies would instead constitute\n                        an unsecured debt provable in the winding-up of MFGS … [emphasis\n                        added in italics and bold italics] 238    It is true that on the face of it, there\n                    appears to be inconsistencies between Mr Yap’s evidence at paras 18 and 19\n                    of his OS 22 affidavit, and these later qualifications made in paras 64 to 67.\n                    However, these inconsistencies show that Mr Yap’s alleged admissions in OS\n                    22 are neither clear nor strong evidence that MFGS had an intention to hold\n                    moneys equivalent to the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value on trust for the\n                    LFX and Bullion customers. 239    Mr Yeap accepted at the hearing that the\n                    Liquidators relied on the Seg Fund Statement in coming to the sum of US$477m,\n                    but disputes that this created or evinced a trust. The comments I have made\n                    above with respect to the Seg Fund Statement apply equally here (see [217]\n                    above). In summary, item 6 of the Seg Fund Statement (“Amount Required to\n                    be Segregated”) cannot prescribe what the applicable statutes require\n                    MFGS to segregate. It also does not enable one to identify MFGS’ true\n                    “residual financial interest” in the Customer Segregated Accounts.\n                    To the extent the Liquidators have relied on the Seg Fund Statement in arriving\n                    at the sum of US$477m, it is possible that they have erred or proceeded on the\n                    wrong understanding of the legal principles. Thus, insofar as Mr Yap deposed in\n                    his affidavit that the “aggregate Customer’s Funds held by MFGS\n                    amounted to about US$477 million”, I accept Mr Yeap’s submissions\n                    that this statementmust be read in the whole context of Mr\n                        Yap’s OS 22 affidavit, which expressly states that\n                    “unrealised profits and losses and/or realised profits not paid into\n                    MFGS’ customer segregated accounts” would not be comprised in the\n                    “Available Customers’ Funds”. This same position was also\n                    communicated to Vintage and MFGS’ other customers in a letter dated 11\n                    January 2012 from the Liquidators. In my judgment, Mr Yap did not express the\n                    view that MFGS held sums equivalent to the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value\n                    on trust for the LFX and Bullion customers. 240    In any event, it is clear from Mr\n                    Yap’s OS 22 affidavit that MFGS held the “Available\n                    Customers’ Funds” on trust in order to comply with the provisions\n                    of the SFA and its related regulations (see the quote reproduced at [232]\n                    above). To me, as with the Seg Fund Statement and MFGS’ audited financial\n                    statements, the most that can be said is that these documents demonstrate an\n                    intention on MFGS’ part tocomply with the applicable\n                        laws and regulations, which is not the same as an intention to\n                    hold the moneys as anexpress trustee. Hence, I am\n                    of the view that for the reasons given above, these alleged admissions of the\n                    Liquidators donotshow that MFGS intended to hold\n                    moneys equivalent to the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value on express trust\n                    for its customers. Conclusion on the Express Trust issue 241    Before concluding, the case ofSogo Department Storesshould be considered in further\n                    detail. In that case, the Court of Appeal was also faced with the issue as to\n                    whether the certainty of intention to create a trust was present. The facts of\n                    the case are as follows: Sogo, a departmental store, had agreed to sell\n                    Hinckley’s products under a concessionaire agreement. Under the\n                    concessionaire agreement, the products belonged to Hinckley, and when these\n                    products were sold, the proceeds were collected by Sogo’s cashiers and\n                    banked into Sogo’s general account along with the sale proceeds of all the\n                    other goods in Sogo’s store. Sogo subsequently entered judicial\n                    management, and Hinckley claimed that Sogo held the sale proceeds of its\n                    products on trust for it, on the basis that Sogo had received the moneys as\n                    Hinckley’s agent. After surveying the law on this issue, the Court of\n                    Appeal held (at [40]): What is essential to bear in mind is that this was a business arrangement,\n                        initially for a period of three years. The parties would have realised that\n                        it would involve the sale of a huge number of … goods.It would be wholly unrealistic to suggest that the parties\n                            expected a trust to arise in relation to the sum received in respect of\n                            each item of goods. The commercial context would militate against any\n                            such imputation or inference of a trust. Furthermore, at the\n                        same time, there were many concessionaries operating within the department\n                        store. … [emphasis added] 242    The comments made by the Court of Appeal are\n                    apposite to the present situation. As a general observation, it does not seem\n                    likely that MFGS would have set aside its own moneys and held them on trust in\n                    order to satisfy obligations owed to the LFX and Bullion customers in respect of\n                    the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value, even though neither was due and\n                    payable then. It appears to run against commercial logic that MFGS could have\n                    intended to hold moneys on trust for the benefit of the LFX and Bullion\n                    customers in anticipation of meeting its contingent or future debt obligations,\n                    which it owed as principal to them. For one, the quantum of the Unrealised\n                    Profits fluctuated on a daily basis, and could even turn into losses instead. As\n                    for Forward Value, this is bydefinitiona sum to\n                    be paid in the future. In the absence of express agreement (as compared toMac-Jordan, where the agreement contemplated\n                    the setting-up of a trust account in respect of the retention moneys), it does\n                    not appear to me commercially sensible for MFGS to have satisfied this future\n                    debt obligation earlier by creating a trust over its value. 243    It is a constant theme in Vintage’s\n                    submissions that MFGS was not permitted by the CTR or SFR to put in funds into\n                    the Customer Segregated Accounts for “operational convenience” or\n                    for “internal risk management”. Vintage harks back to reg 21(4) of\n                    the CTR and reg 23(1)(a) of the SFR to emphasise\n                    the point that MFGS was only allowed to put its own funds into the Customer\n                    Segregated Accounts in order to prevent its customers’ accounts from\n                    becoming under-margined or under-funded. 244    Against this, it should be noted that reg\n                    21(4) of the CTR and reg 23(1)(a) of the SFR are\n                    drafted fairly widely. These two regulations allow a CMS licence holder or\n                    commodity broker to advance “sufficient money” from its own funds\n                    “to prevent any or all of his customers’ trust accounts from\n                    becoming under-margined” (reg 21(4) of the CTR), or “to prevent\n                    the customer’s trust account from being under-margined or\n                    under-funded” (reg 23(1)(a) of the SFR). As\n                    the proverbial saying goes, prevention is better than cure. The provisions under\n                    the CTR and SFR permit prevention, but they do not compel cure. What is\n                    “sufficient” depends on the facts and circumstances. A prudent and\n                    cautious CMS licence holder or commodity broker might advance a great deal more\n                    funds, including amounts that would cover the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value, so as to ensure that under-margining of any of its customers’\n                    accounts wouldneveroccur. In this regard, it\n                    should be recalled that MFGS took into account the Total Account Equity (which\n                    would include the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value) in calculating a\n                    customer’s margin requirements (see [14(j)] above). As MFGS allowed the\n                    customer to use the value of the chose owed by MFGS to him or her to engage in\n                    further trades, it may have been prudent for MFGS, within the framework of the\n                    CTR and SFR, to inject its own funds to cover the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value. In my view, such conduct would not be inconsistent with the CTR and SFR.\n                    Finally,even ifMFGS was in breach of reg 21(4)\n                    of the CTR and reg 23(1)(a) of the SFR, the fact\n                    that MFGS placedmoreof itsown moneysinto the Customer Segregated Accounts than it was\n                    allowed to would not, of itself, give the LFX and Bullion customers a\n                    proprietary interest in those funds. 245    I have also gone through the documentary and\n                    other pieces of evidence which Vintage relies on in seeking to prove that MFGS\n                    intended to hold moneys equivalent to the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value\n                    on trust for its customers. In respect of each category of evidence, I have\n                    found that they do not constitute clear and strong evidence that MFGS intended\n                    to hold moneys equivalent to the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value on trust\n                    for its customers. Even considering all the categories of evidence together, I\n                    am also of the view that they do not present a compelling picture that MFGS\n                    intended to hold moneys equivalent to the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value\n                    on trust for its customers. 246    With this finding, there is no need for me\n                    to consider whether the alleged trust satisfied the requisite certainty of\n                    subject matter and certainty of objects. There is also no longer any need for me\n                    to consider whether the court should exercise its equitable jurisdiction to set\n                    aside the alleged trust for mistake. 247    Nonetheless, as Vintage has made submissions\n                    on the certainty of subject matter, I will briefly address this element. I find\n                    difficulty with this element, and am doubtful that Vintage could have proved\n                    that the alleged trust had the requisite certainty of subject matter, even if\n                    MFGS’ intention to hold the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value on trust\n                    was proven. In the main, the presence of commingling between customers’\n                    funds and MFGS’ own funds in the Customer Segregated Account and the fact\n                    that the quantum of Unrealised Profits fluctuated on a daily basis are factors\n                    which appear to negate the certainty of subject matter. However, I will not\n                    delve further into this issue. 248    Finally, in conclusion on the Express Trust\n                    issue, I would mention that it appears to me that MFGS has conducted itself\n                    judiciously and in a commercially sound manner. However, in the absence of an\n                    express declaration of trust, mere judicious conduct consistent with\n                    commercially sound decisions does not amount to clear, strong evidence of an\n                    intention to create a trust.",
        "Conclusion on the Proprietary Claim Issue": "249    For the reasons given above, I hold that the\n                    LFX and Bullion customers do not have a proprietary entitlement to the sums\n                    standing in the Customer Segregated Accounts that may be broadly attributable to\n                    the value of the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value whether by way of\n                    statutory or express trust. Instead, the LFX and Bullion customers have choses\n                    in action against MFGS for the value of the Unrealised Profits and Forward\n                    Value, and must prove the claims as unsecured creditors in the winding up of\n                    MFGS.",

        "Relevance of commencement of provisional liquidation on the LFX and\n                Bullion customers’ proprietary claim": "257    I deal first with Vintage’s submission\n                    that the date on which voluntary liquidation commences is the most appropriate\n                    date to determine a party’s proprietary entitlement. Vintage relies onRe Lehman Brothers Finance Asia Pte Ltd (in\n                        creditors’ voluntary liquidation)[2013] 1 SLR 64\n                        (“Re Lehman Brothers Finance\n                    Asia”) and on authorities from New South Wales and the United\n                    Kingdom for this proposition. I do not derive much assistance from this\n                    submission as Vintage’s argument fails to take into accounthowa statutory trust arises over a customer’s\n                    Ledger Balance C/F. 258    It should be recalled that in the context of\n                    MFGS’ relationship as principal counterparty to the LFX and Bullion\n                    customers, it is only after MFGS has made payment to a customer by crediting\n                    funds to the Ledger Balance C/F that funds fall within the ambit of the\n                    statutory trusts under the CTR and SFR (see [128] above in respect of the\n                    Bullion transactions and [163]–[164] in respect of the LFX\n                    transactions). 259    However, once MFGS commenced winding up, it\n                    is mandated by s 300 of the Companies Act to apply its assetspari passuin satisfaction of all liabilities. Under s 300 of\n                    the Companies Act, the distribution of the property of the company should be\n                    made as follows: Distribution of property of company 300.Subject to the provisions of this Act\n                        as to preferential payments, the property of a company shall, on its winding\n                        up, be applied pari passu in satisfaction of its liabilities, and, subject\n                        to that application, shall, unless the articles otherwise provide, be\n                        distributed among the members according to their rights and interests in the\n                        company. 260    When MFGS was placed into provisional\n                    liquidation on 1 November 2011, this was the date on which it commenced\n                    voluntary winding up under s 291(6)(a) of the\n                    Companies Act. MFGS was thus not able to discharge any unsecured debt obligation\n                    owed to the LFX and Bullion customers that became due and payable on or after\n                    the commencement of MFGS’ winding up on 1 November 2011 in priority to\n                    other unsecured debts. 261    Where MFGS acts as agent for its customers\n                    in respect of transactions executed on an exchange, the receivables due from\n                    these exchanges are held on trust for its customers. Hence, any sums received\n                    from the exchange after MFGS entered into provisional liquidation willnotform part of MFGS’ assets, but will be\n                    received on trust for the respective customers. However, where MFGS acts a\n                    principal counterparty against its customers, such as in the LFX and Bullion\n                    transactions, the same does not apply. In these instances, MFGS does not hold\n                    the choses in action on trust for its customers. Any payment in discharge of\n                    these unsecured debt obligations ahead of payments to other unsecured creditors\n                    made after the commencement of liquidation would constitute a disposition of\n                    MFGS’ own assets and violate s 300 of the Companies Act. 262    Therefore, for funds to be caught by the\n                    ambit of the statutory trusts imposed by the CTR and SFR, they must be paid to\n                    an LFX or Bullion customer through the crediting of the Ledger Balance C/F\n                    before the commencement of MFGS’ winding up. 263    It is therefore insufficient for Vintage to\n                    assert that the date on which MFGS went into liquidation should be used to\n                    determine Vintage’s proprietary entitlement. Further, the authorities\n                    Vintage relies on are not particularly useful.Re Lehman\n                        Brothers Finance Asiadealt with the date at which foreign\n                    currency debts should be converted to Singapore dollars under r 181 of the\n                    Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed). This is not in dispute in this\n                    case. The other authorities cited by Vintage,Re MF Global\n                        Australia,Re Global Trader Europe Ltd (in\n                        liq) (No 2)[2009] EWHC 699 (Ch) andIn the\n                        matter of MF Global UK Limited (in special administration)[2013]\n                    EWHC 92 (Ch) were also of little assistance as they concerned the interpretation\n                    of jurisdiction-specific provisions (ie, the\n                    Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth) and Chapter\n                    7 and 7A of the Client Asset Sourcebook of the United Kingdom Financial Services\n                    Authority Handbook).",
        "When payment of the Forward Value occurred or should have occurred on\n                the Value Date": "264    Flowing from the above, and as stated above\n                    at [251], the crux of the issue is when the payment of the Forward Value with a\n                    Value Date of 1 November 2011 occurred or should have occurred, and whether this\n                    occurred or should have occurred prior to the commencement of MFGS’\n                    winding up on 1 November 2011. 265    In my judgment, MFGS did not pay, and was\n                    notrequiredto pay, the Forward Value with a\n                    Value Date of 1 November 2011 before MFGS was placed into provision liquidation\n                    on 1 November 2011. Vintage and the LFX and Bullion customers thus only have a\n                    proprietary entitlement to what is represented as the Ledger Balance C/F on the\n                    Daily FX Activity Statement dated 31 October 2011. I now explain my reasons for\n                    so holding. 266    At the outset, I observe that the MTA does\n                    not clearly set out when the real-time settlement of the Forward Value between\n                    MFGS and the LFX and Bullion customers was contractually required to occur on a\n                    particular Value Date. Vintage relies on the definition of “Value\n                    Date” and “Business Day” in the MTA to contend that\n                    settlement of Forward Value should have occurred on the specified calendar date\n                    with reference to Singapore time. Value Date is defined in the MTA as\n                    “thedateon which the respective\n                    obligations of the parties to a foreign exchange or [over-the-counter]\n                    transaction are to be performed”. However, the MTA does not explicitly\n                    state that this “date” in the\n                    definition of Value Date should be determined with respect to Singapore time,\n                    instead of New York or London time. Business Day is defined in the MTA as\n                    “any day on which MFGS is open for business in Singapore”. This\n                    definition does not refer either to MFGS’ operational hours, or the time\n                    fixed for MFGS’ close of business or the settlement of\n                positions. 267    The Liquidators produced a report published\n                    by the Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee titled “The Singapore\n                    Guide to Conduct and Market Practices for Treasury Activities” (November\n                    2010 Ed) (“the Guide”) to show that the timing of MFGS’\n                    close of business was in line with market practice. The relevant portions of the\n                    Guide read: 1. MARKET TRADING HOURS 1.1 Foreign exchange trades, whether direct or via a broker, transacted\n                        prior to 5.00 AM Sydney time, are done in conditions that are not considered\n                        to be normal market-conditions or market hours. Thus the official range in\n                        currency markets will be set from 5.00 AM Sydney time on Monday morning, all\n                        year round. 1.2 Therecognized closing time for the currency\n                            markets will be 5.00 PM Friday New York time, all year\n                        round. … 3. VALUE DATES 3.1 Quotations for foreign exchange are value spot, which is defined as\n                        two business days from the date of transaction. 3.2Misunderstandings can arise over the definition of\n                            “value date” and “business day”,\n                        given the observance of different holidays in various financial centres. In\n                        quoting prices, market participants are thereforestrongly urged to make clear to their counterparties the precise dates\n                            for settlement of transactions. [emphasis added] 268    I note that the Guide states that the\n                    currency markets open at 5.00am Sydney time on Monday mornings, and closes at\n                    5.00pm New York time on Friday evenings, all year round. The Guide does not\n                    state that the industry practice is for brokers to peg theirdailyclose of business to New York time, regardless of the\n                    jurisdiction in which they operate. In fact, the Guide encourages brokers to\n                    “make clear to their counterparties the precise dates for the settlement\n                    of transactions”. It is regrettable that the contract between MFGS and\n                    its customers did not do so. 269    No evidence has been led by Vintage to show\n                    that the facts set out by the Liquidators, inasmuch as they relate to the time\n                    of MFGS’ close of business, were wrong or based on false assumptions.\n                    Instead, I find that the evidence is consistent with the position that\n                    MFGS’ close of business was pegged to New York time and that the Daily FX\n                    Activity Statement was dated according to MFGS’ Business Cycle (see [254]\n                    above). 270    The Guide makes it clear that the currency\n                    markets close at 5.00pm New York time every Friday evening. Trades could thus\n                    have been carried out by MFGS’ customers until 5.00am every Saturday\n                    morning (in Singapore time). In this regard, I find it significant that MFGS did\n                    not produce Daily FX Activity Statements for Saturday and Sunday of the week.\n                    For example, although Vintage produced its Daily FX Activity Statements dated\n                    17, 26, 27, 28 and 31 October 2011, as well as 1 November 2011, no statements\n                    were produced in evidence for 29 and 30 October 2011 which was a Saturday and\n                    Sunday respectively. Mr Vinod also stated in his ninth affidavit that no Daily\n                    FX Activity Statements were issued by MFGS on the weekends. 271    In my opinion, the fact that MFGS did not\n                    issue statements on the weekends is evidence which is consistent with the\n                    position that MFGS’ close of business was pegged to New York time. Hence,\n                    a trade carried out at 3.00pm New York time on a Friday afternoon (date:\n                    “Y”) being 3.00am on a Saturday morning (date: “Y +\n                    1”) in Singapore time, would have been reflected on the Daily FX Activity\n                    Statement dated “Y” and not on a Daily FX Activity Statement dated\n                    “Y + 1”, since the latter statement would not have been issued in\n                    MFGS’ ordinary course of business. This would also be consistent with the\n                    industry practice stated in the Guide. The date stated in the Daily FX Activity\n                    Statement must thus be read with reference to MFGS’ Business Cycle (see\n                    [254] above), and not strictly in accordance with Singapore time. 272    In the course of the hearing before me,\n                    Vintage did not challenge the Liquidators’ position that the daily\n                    settlement prices for open positions were marked to the market at MFGS’\n                    close of business on that particular day (ie,\n                    5.00pm New York time on the same calendar day). Given that the daily settlement\n                    prices for open positions were reflected on the Daily FX Activity Statements, it\n                    would also follow that the Daily FX Activity Statements were only produced after\n                    MFGS’ close of business. This is also the Liquidators’ position (see\n                    [253] above). 273    Thus, it has been established that at least\n                    two events occurred at or after MFGS’ close of business respectively.\n                    First, at MFGS’ close of business, any open positions would be marked to\n                    the market, and a customer’s Unrealised Profits or Unrealised Losses would\n                    be calculated accordingly. Second, after this was done, the Daily FX Activity\n                    Statements would be produced and sent to customers. 274    While the above shows the time at which\n                    daily settlement prices for open positions were calculated and Daily FX Activity\n                    Statements produced, does it go so far as to show that the Forward Value was\n                    only paid to customers at MFGS’ close of business? There has been scant\n                    evidence as to the time at which this was made. 275    There is some force in Vintage’s\n                    argument that as a matter of obligations between the parties under the MTA, itshould havebeen able to withdraw the Forward\n                    Value with a Value Date of 1 November 2011 on 1 November 2011 (Singapore time)\n                    since the value of these funds, in any event, were already in the Customer\n                    Segregated Accounts. Vintage in fact sought to withdraw US$6m on 31 October 2011\n                    and a further US$5.5m on 1 November 2011. Also, even though the close of\n                    MFGS’ business on 31 October 2011 was notionally fixed at 5.00am on 1\n                    November 2011 (Singapore time), MFGS could still have paid the Forward Value due\n                    on 1 November 2011 any time after 5.00am on 1 November 2011 in Singapore time\n                    – prior to MFGS’ entry into provision liquidation – and need\n                    not have paid it only at 5.00am on 2 November 2011 (ie, MFGS’ notional close of business for 1 November\n                    2011). 276    However, in my judgment, two points stand in\n                    the way of Vintage’s argument. First, there is no evidence that the\n                    Forward Value with a Value Date of 1 November 2011was in\n                        fact paid and creditedto Vintage’s Ledger Balance C/F\n                    before the commencement of MFGS’ winding up. In this regard,\n                    Vintage’s reliance on the Daily FX Activity Statement dated 1 November\n                    2011 as evidence that MFGS had made payment of the Forward Value due to\n                    Vintage’s Ledger Balance C/F is not persuasive. If it is accepted (which I\n                    do) that the Daily FX Activity Statement was only produced after MFGS’\n                    close of business on 1 November 2011, the mere fact that the Daily FX Activity\n                    Statement dated 1 November 2011 was produced does not show that the Forward\n                    Value was creditedbefore MFGS entered provisional\n                        liquidation. 277    Second, it is significant that the daily\n                    settlement prices were marked to market at MFGS’ close of business (a fact\n                    which Vintage has not disputed). In my view, given the many customers and\n                    product lines which MFGS dealt with on a daily basis, a system for clearing and\n                    settlement and the reconciliation of accounts had to be put in place. I am\n                    persuaded that in the ordinary course of business, settlement and reconciliation\n                    of marked-to-market positions occurred at MFGS’ close of\n                business. 278    As a matter of operational efficacy, I find\n                    it more likely than not that settlement and reconciliation ofall accounts(and not just the marked-to-market positions) would\n                    have occurred at the same time. This lends support to the argument that MFGS\n                    would, in its ordinary course of business, only have credited the Forward Value\n                    to the Ledger Balance C/F, and made payment of the equivalent value of funds\n                    into or within the Customer Segregated Accounts, at its close of business. It\n                    was therefore not able to make payment of the Forward Value that would\n                    ordinarily have been paid on its close of business on 1 November 2011, as MFGS\n                    had already been placed in provisional liquidation. I would also observe that if\n                    MFGS had departed from its ordinary practice and made payment to its customers\n                    before it went into provisional liquidation, this might be considered an unfair\n                    preference within s 99 of the Bankruptcy Act, liable to be unwound under s 329\n                    of the Companies Act. 279    Finally, I note that this position is not\n                    inconsistent with the terms of the MTA. As stated above at [266], the provisions\n                    of the MTA do not set out in great detail MFGS’ mechanism for settlement.\n                    What is clear is that MFGS must perform its obligations under foreign exchange\n                    or over-the-counter transactions (ie, the LFX and\n                    Bullion transactions) on the Value Date, which is defined as thedateon which MFGS is to perform its\n                obligations. 280    Given that a Value Date for any particular\n                    transaction is only reflected in the Daily FX Activity Statements and not in any\n                    other contractual documents, the “date” on which MFGS is to\n                    perform its obligations should be read consistently with the Daily FX Activity\n                    Statements. The Daily FX Activity Statements were in turn, dated according to\n                    MFGS’ Business Cycle (see [254] above). Thus, the “date” on\n                    which MFGS is to perform its obligations (ie, the\n                    Value Date) must also take reference from this business cycle. In this regard,\n                    there is no mention in the MTA of thetimeat\n                    which the obligation is to be performed on a particular Value Date. The MTA\n                    should thus be interpreted to permit MFGS’ payment obligation to be\n                    performed only at the close of business on a particular Value Date. Therefore,\n                    on this ground, I do not accept Vintage’s submission that even if MFGS did\n                    not in fact credit the Forward Value to Vintage’s Ledger Balance C/F on 1\n                    November 2011 (Singapore time), contractually, MFGSshouldhave done so. 281    In the circumstances, there was therefore no\n                    other evidence or basis on which I could have found that the Forward Value with\n                    a Value Date of 1 November 2011 was in fact paid and credited, or should have\n                    been paid and credited, into Vintage’s (and the LFX and Bullion\n                    customers’) Ledger Balance C/F before MFGS was placed into provisional\n                    liquidation. For the reasons given above, I find on the basis of the evidence\n                    that it is more likely than not that MFGS ordinarily made payment of the Forward\n                    Value at its close of business on the applicable Value Date. As a consequence,\n                    the Forward Value with a Value Date of 1 November 2011 had not yet been paid and\n                    credited to the LFX and Bullion customers’ Ledger Balance C/F before the\n                    provisional liquidators were appointed and as a result, is not caught by the\n                    ambit of the statutory trusts imposed by the CTA and SFA and their attendant\n                    regulations. This is also in accordance with the terms of the MTA.",
        "Conclusion on the Value Date issue": "282    By the above, Vintage cannot assert a\n                    proprietary right to the US$10,793,862.06 reflected under its Ledger Balance C/F\n                    in its Daily FX Activity Statement dated 1 November 2011. Vintage is only\n                    beneficially entitled to US$4,711,459.18 reflected under its Ledger Balance C/F\n                    in its Daily FX Activity Statement dated 31 October 2011. 283    For completeness, I should highlight that\n                    this is not a case where MFGS has failed to pay what it was required to pay\n                    before it entered into provisional liquidation. There may well be cases where a\n                    commodity broker or CMS licence holder fails to pay or credit a customer’s\n                    Ledger Balance C/F when it was clearly contractually required to do so. In such\n                    a hypothetical situation, on the interpretation preferred in this judgment,\n                    moneyshould haveeither “accrued\n                    to” the customer (under reg 21(1)(a) of the\n                    CTR), or been “received on account of” the customer (under reg\n                        16(1)(a) of the SFR). Whether as Vintage\n                    argues, the court would hold that a customer has a proprietary interest in the\n                    money thatshouldhave been paid is not a point\n                    that I have determined.",
        "The Margin Excess issue": "284    Finally, Vintage also argues that it has a\n                    proprietary interest in what is reflected as Margin Excess on its Daily FX\n                    Activity Statement dated 31 October 2011. Vintage makes this contention on the\n                    basis that the Liquidators, in particular Mr Yap, had unequivocally admitted on\n                    affidavit in OS 22 that MFGS had treated “excess margins” as\n                    moneys held on trust by MFGS for its customers. Vintage relies on para 18 and 53\n                    of Mr Yap’s first affidavit filed in OS 22. Paragraph 18 of Mr Yap’s\n                    OS 22 affidavit has been set out above (see [232]) and para 53 is reproduced\n                    here: 53. As highlighted earlier in this affidavit, in accordance with the\n                        provisions of the SFA and its related regulations (including, in particular,\n                        provisions of the [SFR]) and the terms and conditions of the MTA (including,\n                        in particular, clause 15 of the MTA), the fundsreceivedby MFGSfromcustomers (including any excess margins) were\n                        to be and are held on trust for such customers by MFGS … [emphasis\n                        added] Vintage also refers me to Mr Yap’s first affidavit filed\n                        in OS 289, where he repeated the points set out above. 285    From what Mr Yap has deposed in his\n                    affidavit set out above, it cannot be doubted that the Liquidators take the\n                    position that “excess margins” are held on trust for customers\n                    pursuant to the applicable statutes and regulations, as well as cl A15 of the\n                    MTA. The critical question is therefore the definition of “excess\n                    margins”. 286    Vintage submits that “excess\n                    margins” are equivalent to the Margin Excess as reflected in its Daily FX\n                    Activity Statements. As I have explained above at [14(j)], the Margin Excess is\n                    calculated by deducting the Initial Margin Requirement from a customer’s\n                    Total Account Equity. Since the Liquidators have affirmed on affidavit that a\n                    customer’s “excess margins” are held on trust for a\n                    customer, Vintage posits that it is entitled to the sum reflected as Margin\n                    Excess on its Daily FX Activity Statement dated 31 October 2011, being\n                    US$11,547,454.49. 287    However, as the Liquidators point out, Mr\n                    Yap has stated in the same breath in his OS 22 affidavit that these\n                    “excess margins” are included in the fundsreceivedby MFGSfromcustomers.\n                    Plainly, the Unrealised Profits and Forward Value, being contingent and future\n                    debt obligations owed by MFGS to its customers, are not funds “receivedby MFGSfromcustomers”. 288    With respect therefore, I find that the link\n                    that Vintage seeks to be drawn between “excess margins” as stated\n                    by Mr Yap, and the Margin Excess in the Daily FX Activity Statements a highly\n                    tenuous one and is not clear and strong evidence of MFGS’ intention to\n                    create a trust over the Margin Excess. 289    To the extent that Vintage seeks to argue\n                    that Mr Yap’s statements in his OS 22 affidavit amount to an express\n                    declaration of trust, the remarks I have made in relation to Vintage’s\n                    submissions on the effect of the Liquidators’ conduct (being conduct\n                    occurring after the commencement of winding up) at [235] above apply here in\n                    equal measure. I therefore do not accept that these statements made by Mr Yap in\n                    his affidavits show that Vintage is entitled to the sums reflected as Margin\n                    Excess in its Daily FX Statement dated 31 October 2011.",
        "Conclusion": "290    Due to the nature of the claims and the\n                    issues before me, this judgment has inevitably been a long one. Here, I set out\n                    a summary of my findings: (a)     The Bullion transactions are\n                        governed by the CTA and CTR, notwithstanding MFGS’ capacity as\n                        principal counterparty. The CTA and CTR impose a statutory trust over\n                        “money … accruing to a customer” (pursuant to reg\n                            21(1)(a) of the CTR). A statutory trust\n                        arises over a Bullion customer’s Ledger Balance C/F, but not the money\n                        segregated to cover MFGS’ Unrealised Profits or Forward Value\n                        obligations, as the latter is not “money … accruing to a\n                        customer”. (b)     In respect of the LFX transactions, the SFA and SFR impose a\n                        statutory trust over “money on account of” a customer\n                        (pursuant to reg 16(1)(a) of the SFR). A\n                        statutory trust arises over an LFX customer’s Ledger Balance C/F, but\n                        not money segregated to cover MFGS’ Unrealised Profits or Forward\n                        Value obligations, as the latter is not “money received on account\n                        of” a customer. (c)     MFGS did not intend for the moneys segregated to meet\n                        its Unrealised Profits and Forward Value obligations to be held on express\n                        trust for the LFX and Bullion customers. (d)     The LFX and Bullion customers only have a\n                        proprietary claim, pursuant to the statutory trusts under the CTA, CTR, SFA\n                        and SFR, to the sums actually paid and credited to the Ledger Balance C/F\n                        before MFGS appointed provisional liquidators on 1 November 2011. As MFGS\n                        only paid its customers at its close of business which was pegged to the\n                        close of business in New York, the last relevant payment made was evidenced\n                        in the LFX and Bullion customers’ Daily FX Activity Statements dated\n                        31 October 2011, and Vintage and the LFX and Bullion customers only have a\n                        proprietary claim to sums reflected as Ledger Balance C/F\n                    therein.
