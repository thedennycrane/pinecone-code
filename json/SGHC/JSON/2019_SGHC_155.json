        "Introduction": "1 These grounds of decision deal with the conviction and sentence of Imran Bin Mohd Arip (“Imran”), Pragas Krissamy (“Pragas”), and Tamilselvam A/L Yagasvranan (“Tamil”) after their joint trial. Imran was convicted under s 5(1)(a) read with s 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) for abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with Pragas and Tamil to traffic in not less than 19.42g of diamorphine. Pragas and Tamil, whom the prosecution established to have delivered the diamorphine to Imran, were convicted under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) for trafficking in not less than 19.42g of diamorphine. Section 33B of the MDA was not applicable. I therefore imposed the mandatory sentence of death on Imran, Pragas and Tamil.",
        "Charges": "2 Imran is a 49-year-old male Singaporean who was charged as follows: That you, 1. IMRAN BIN MOHD ARIP, on or before 8 February 2017, in Singapore, did abet the doing of a thing by engaging in a conspiracy with one Tamilselvam A/L Yagasvranan (FIN: [GXXXXX57M]) and one Pragas Krissamy (FIN: [GXXXXX76P]) to do a certain thing, namely, to traffic in a controlled drug listed in Class ‘A’ of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”),to wit, two (2) packets containing 894.2 grams of granular/powdery substance which was found to containnot less than 19.42 grams of diamorphine, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, on 8 February 2017, at or about 7.09 a.m., at the level 4 corridor of Block 518 Jurong West Street 52, Singapore, the said Pragas Krissamy and Tamilselvam A/L Yagasvranan did jointly deliver two (2) packets containing 894.2 grams of granular/powdery substance which was found to contain not less than 19.42 grams of diamorphine to you, without authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 12 of the MDA punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA, and further upon your conviction, you may alternatively be liable to be punished under Section 33B of the MDA.

[emphasis in original] 5 The Prosecution, with the agreement of defence counsel, applied for a joint trial under s 143(g) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) and I so ordered.1Foot Note 1×Notes of Evidence (“NE”) 19 February 2019, p 6.",
        "Facts": "6 The three charges centre on a delivery of a white plastic bag by Pragas to Imran in the presence of Tamil in the corridor outside Imran’s residence, unit #04-139 of Block 518 Jurong West Street 52, Singapore (“the Unit”)2Foot Note 2×Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”), tendered under s 267(1) of the CPC, at [4].on 8 February 2017. The following facts surrounding the arrest of the three men are not disputed. 7 Officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) who were on duty observed that at about 7.05am, Tamil and Pragas entered the carpark of Block 518A Jurong West Street 52.3Foot Note 3×ASOF at [7].They parked at the motorcycle lots behind Block 517 Jurong West Street 52. Thereafter, they walked together towards Block 518 Jurong West Street 52, which was where the Unit was located. Pragas carried a black haversack. Tamil handed Pragas a mobile telephone before entering a lift at Block 518. 8 At about 7.09am, Tamil came out of the lift at the fourth storey corridor of Block 518 Jurong West Street, and there met with Imran, who came out of the Unit.4Foot Note 4×ASOF at [8].Tamil then called Pragas using a mobile telephone. Pragas spoke to Tamil using the mobile telephone that Pragas had given him at the foot of Block 518. Pragas then went upstairs to the fourth storey corridor via the staircase from the ground floor. Once there with Tamil and Imran, Pragas opened his black haversack and took out a white plastic bag which he handed over to Imran. Imran then walked back to the Unit with the white plastic bag, while Tamil and Pragas walked down the staircase of the block and towards their motorcycles. 9 This exchange was witnessed by Senior Staff Sergeant Wilson Chew Wei Xun (“SSSgt Chew”) and Woman Staff Sergeant Cynthia Lee Shue Ching (“W/SSgt Lee”) who stationed themselves at unit #07-08 of Parc Vista Tower 1 (“the Parc Vista condominium unit”), a nearby condominium, in order to observe the Unit.5Foot Note 5×ASOF at [5]. 10 At about 7.10am, a team of CNB officers arrested Pragas and Tamil in the vicinity of where their motorcycles were parked.6Foot Note 6×ASOF at [9].They seized several items from both Pragas and Tamil. In particular, the officers seized a stack of Singapore currency amounting to $6,700 tied with two red rubber bands from Tamil’s black waist pouch. This was marked as E1. Three mobile telephones belonging to Tamil were also seized and marked respectively as TS-HP1, TS-HP2, and TS-HP3. 11 Meanwhile, at about 7.15am, a separate team of CNB officers conducted a raid of the Unit.7Foot Note 7×ASOF at [22].They arrested Imran inside the kitchen of the Unit. A search was then conducted inside and outside the unit in Imran’s presence. An initial search revealed exhibits from various parts of Imran’s flat. Hidden within a pair of grey “Everlast” shoes that were placed on a shoe rack outside the Unit were A1A1 (ten packets of granular/powdery substance believed to be a controlled drug), A2A1 (ten packets of granular/powdery substance believed to be a controlled drug), A2B1 (ten packets of granular/powdery substance believed to be a controlled drug). These substances do not form part of the subject matter of the charges. S$97,500 (B1A1A) was found in a refrigerator in the kitchen. 12 From Imran’s bedroom, officers seized D1, a white plastic bag that was on his bed; and from a drawer of a dressing table, eight packets of duty-unpaid Marlboro Red cigarettes (“contraband cigarettes”). These eight packets were subsequently destroyed by Singapore Customs after Imran was administered a stern warning for the possession of duty-unpaid cigarettes, an offence under the Customs Act (Cap 70, 2004 Rev Ed). 13 Subsequently, at about 11.00am, two bags of items were seized from the top shelf inside the storeroom of the Unit.8Foot Note 8×ASOF at [24].First, a green and white “City-Link” plastic bag, C1. Inside C1, a packet of granular/powdery substance believed to be a controlled drug, C1A1A1, was found. Second, a black plastic bag, C2. Inside C2 were two bundles, marked C2A and C2B. Inside C2A, within another clear plastic bag marked C2A1, was a packet of granular/powdery substance believed to be a controlled drug, marked C2A1A. Inside C2B, within another clear plastic bag marked C2B1, was a packet of granular/powdery substance believed to be a controlled drug, marked C2B1A. C2A1A and C2B1A form the subject matter of the three charges. 14 The various drug exhibits were submitted to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) on 9 February 2017, and determined to contain diamorphine.9Foot Note 9×ASOF at [39], [40].C2A1A and C2B1A, in particular, contained not less than 5.79g and 13.63g of diamorphine respectively.10Foot Note 10×ASOF at [41].This amounted to a total of 19.42g of diamorphine. Imran, Tamil and Pragas were all not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to possess or traffic in diamorphine.11Foot Note 11×ASOF at [43]. 15 On 14 February 2017, it was ascertained from various blood samples from Imran, Pragas and Tamil, submitted to the HSA for DNA analysis, that Imran’s DNA was found on C2,12Foot Note 12×ASOF at [44]-[46], [49].the black plastic bag in the storeroom which contained C2A1A and C2B1A, the two bundles containing diamorphine that was the subject matter of the three charges.",
        "The legal context": "16 Section 5(1)(a) of the MDA formed the basis of the charges against Imran, Pragas and Tamil. Section 5(1)(a) reads as follows: 5.—(1) Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore — (a) to traffic in a controlled drug; … 17 The act of trafficking is, in turn, defined under s 2 of the MDA: “traffic” means — (a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or (b) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a), otherwise than under the authority of this Act, and “trafficking” has a corresponding meaning; The specific mode of trafficking Pragas and Tamil were alleged to have effected was that of delivery to Imran. 18 Imran was charged with abetment by conspiracy, under s 12 of the MDA. Section 12 of the MDA provides: Abetments and attempts punishable as offences 12.Any person who abets the commission of or who attempts to commit or does any act preparatory to, or in furtherance of, the commission of any offence under this Act shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable on conviction to the punishment provided for that offence. 19 Imran was the recipient of the delivery. A recipient of such a delivery may be charged with abetment of trafficking if his intention, either presumed or proved, is that of onward distribution: seeNgYang Sek v Public Prosecutor[1997] 2 SLR(R) 816,LiewZheng Yang v Public Prosecutor[2017] 5 SLR 611, andAli bin Mohamad Bahashwan v Public Prosecutor and other appeals[2018] 1 SLR 610 (“Ali”). No defence of consumption or any other defence negativing onward distribution was advanced by Imran. 20 The mode of abetment Imran was charged with in this case is that of conspiracy. For an offence for abetment by conspiracy to traffic drugs, the guidance of the Court of Appeal inAliat [34] and [75] is that three elements must be satisfied: (a) the abettor must have intended to be party to an agreement to do an unlawful act; (b) the abettor must have known the general purpose of the common design, and the fact that the act agreed to be committed is unlawful; and (c) the abettor’s purpose in taking delivery must be for the onward distribution of the drugs, and not for his own consumption. 21 Pragas and Tamil, on the other hand, were charged with having the common intention to traffic pursuant to s 5(1)(a) of the MDA read with s 34 of the Penal Code. Section 34 reads as follows: Each of several persons liable for an act done by all, in like manner as if done by him alone 34.When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. 22 Under s 34 of the Penal Code, constructive liability is imputed to a secondary offender in relation to an offence arising from a criminal act committed by the actual doer in furtherance of the common intention shared by the actual doer and the secondary offender (seeMuhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v PublicProsecutor and other matters[2014] 3 SLR 721 (“Ridzuan”) at [27];Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasanand others v Public Prosecutor[2010] 4 SLR 1119 (“Daniel Vijay”) at [76]). Three elements must be present before constructive liability can be imposed pursuant to s 34 of the Penal Code: (a) the criminal act element: this concerns the aggregate of all the diverse acts done by the actual doer and secondary offenders which collectively give rise to the offence that they have been charged with; (b) the common intention element: this focuses on the common intention of the offenders to do something or achieve some goal or purpose; and (c) the participation element: this requires a secondary offender to participate in the specific criminal act committed by the actual doer which gives rise to the offence charged or participate in some other criminal act that is done in furtherance of the common intention of all the offenders. 23 The Court of Appeal was of the view inRidzuan(at [29]) that once constructive liability against an accused has been established, there is no further need to additionally establish the elements for the charge of trafficking. It approved the stance taken inFoong Siew Nguiv Public Prosecutor[1995] 3 SLR(R) 254 at [62]: … the actual offence constituted by the criminal act was possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking and the persons who committed the criminal act were Foong and Lim… and s 34 was invoked to render Tan liable for that criminal act.If s 34 applies in this case, as we think it does, it does not matter whether Tan had possession of the drugs at the material time.[emphasis in original] 24 In the Court of Appeal’s view, an alternative analysis based on whether the elements of the offence of trafficking had been made out under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA could also be completed out of an abundance of caution: seeRidzuanat [30]–[31].",
        "Overview of the Prosecution and Defence cases": "25 The Prosecution’s case was that Imran arranged with Tamil to deliver two pounds of heroin on the morning of 8 February 2017. This was for onward transmission to Imran’s customers. Tamil then arranged with his supplier for the necessary, and asked Pragas to assist him with the delivery. The delivery on that morning was the culmination of their plan. Tamil’s plan required two persons in order to effect delivery. He would first meet Imran to check that the location and the payment was secure. Thereafter he would telephone Pragas, who would go to the assigned location and deliver the heroin. 26 Imran accepted that there was a delivery of heroin to himself, and that he was engaged in a conspiracy to have heroin so delivered. His defence was that he only intended to traffic in one pound of heroin, which brought his offence below the capital punishment threshold. Tamil was his “boss”. Imran contended he was Tamil’s courier. Tamil, contrary to his promise to deliver him a single pound of heroin for onward distribution, gave him two pounds, contrary to their prior agreement and his intention. 27 Pragas and Tamil, on the other hand, testified that their common intention was to deliver contraband cigarettes to Imran. In keeping with their plan, they contended, they delivered two cartons of cigarettes – and not heroin – to Imran that morning. Pragas highlighted that he had minimal interaction with Imran, and had been paid to assist Tamil with deliveries of contraband cigarettes. They would travel from Malaysia to Singapore to meet a contact who would hand over the cigarettes. On that morning, a Malay man went into a toilet in Tuas to put the white plastic bag into Pragas’s haversack, which Pragas then transported to the venue and handed over to Imran, thinking that the bag contained cigarettes. Tamil, similarly, contended that cigarettes were delivered that morning. The $6,700 found on his person at the time of arrest was a loan he sought from Imran because they had a plan to buy 400 cartons of contraband cigarettes.",
        "Imran": "28 Imran gave a total of seven statements. The Prosecution relied on the first six statements, recorded on 8–11 and 14 February 2017. Imran contended at trial that only his last and seventh statement, recorded on 18 December 2017, was accurate. His counsel asked for an ancillary hearing in respect of the first six statements, to which Prosecution agreed, and I therefore conducted.",
        "The ancillary hearing": "29 Imran’s basis for his allegation of threat, inducement or promise was that on the morning of 8 February 2017, when the CNB officers were raiding the Unit, he heard a CNB officer tell his colleague in English the following statement, which I refer to in these grounds as “the Disputed Statement”:13Foot Note 13×Closing Submissions for the First Accused, p 2; NE 20 February 2019, p 78. If he admits, there’s a good chance for him. If he does not admit, bring back his parents to the station. Imran understood the Disputed Statement to mean that he had to provide, in his words, a “simple account” of the events in relation to the transaction between Pragas, Tamil and himself, in order to ease the job of the CNB officers and if he did, they would secure a lighter sentence for him.14Foot Note 14×Closing Submissions for the First Accused, p 25.It was this Disputed Statement that induced him to lie in the first six of his seven statements given in the course of 8–14 February 2017.15Foot Note 15×Closing Submissions for the First Accused, pp 12, 27. 30 Section 258(3) of the CPC states: The court shall refuse to admit the statement of an accused or allow it to be used in the manner referred to in subsection (1) if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give the accused grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making the statement he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him. 31 Section 258(3) comprises two limbs: an objective limb requiring that there was in fact, a threat, inducement or promise; and a subjective limb requiring that the threat, inducement or promise operated on the mind of the accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge (seeChai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor[1998] 3 SLR(R) 619 at [53];Ismail bin Abdul Rahman v Public Prosecutor[2004] 2 SLR(R) 74 (“Ismail”) at [36]). 32 First, there was no evidence of the Disputed Statement having been made by anyone. Imran’s contention was a bare assertion. He was unable to recall which officer made the statement. He did not follow up with any of them to verify that he had heard the statement correctly, or that it had any veracity. The fact that Imran failed to seek clarification from anyone regarding the meaning of such a nebulous statement suggests that the Disputed Statement was raised as an afterthought. The Prosecution argued that there was no reason for the CNB officers to threaten to arrest Imran’s elderly parents, who were not involved in Imran’s activities. The 12 CNB officers who were on duty that morning were called to give evidence, and each affirmed that no such statement was made by any of them. 33 Second, even assuming that the statement was made, it could not objectively amount to a threat, inducement or promise. Bringing Imran’s parents to the police station did not amount to a threat. No danger arose therefrom. There was nothing to suggest that they were involved in Imran’s dealings, nor did the officers question them at any point. The raid was targeted at Imran alone. Regarding the “good chance” that was purportedly offered to Imran, this was too vague and uncertain to amount to an inducement. As stated inIsmailat [41], it is important for the court to consider the degree of assurance offered in any given case. The mere offer of a “good chance”, without more, could not serve as an inducement. Much less an inducement that operated on Imran’s mind throughout the course of seven days between 8 February, when he gave his first statement, to 14 February 2017, the date of his sixth statement. The corollary is that any inducement arising from the Disputed Statement, even if genuinely heard by Imran, would be self-induced. Self-perceived threats are insufficient to render a statement involuntary; the existence of a threat, inducement or promise from a person in authority must be established (Lu Lai Heng v Public Prosecutor[1994] 1 SLR(R) 1037 at [19]). 34 I held, therefore, that it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that the six statements were voluntarily made. They were duly admitted.",
        "Abetment by conspiracy": "35 Coming then to the elements of Imran’s offence, the Prosecution’s case was that Imran knowingly conspired with Pragas and Tamil to deliver two pounds of heroin for $6,700, for onward sale and distribution, and this plan was successfully carried out on 8 February 2017. Act of delivery of heroin 36 While SSSgt Chew and W/SSgt Lee observed the transfer of the white plastic bag from Pragas and Tamil to Imran, they did so from the Parc Vista condominium unit, which was approximately 50m to 60m away from the Unit.16Foot Note 16×NE 19 February 2017, p 97.They were unable to see the contents of the white plastic bag from their viewing point. 37 Pragas and Tamil disputed that the white plastic bag handed by Pragas to Imran contained heroin. They contended that what was handed over was only a bag with two cartons of cigarettes, one of Marlboro Light and another of Gudang Garam. 38 Imran admitted at trial that the white plastic bag that they saw contained two pounds of heroin. He said he received the heroin in the white plastic bag, then transferred the heroin he received from the white plastic bag into a black plastic bag and thereafter stored the black plastic bag with the two bundles within it in the storeroom. When cross-examined on the reason for transferring the bundles from the white bag into a black bag, he explained that he took the bundles out and put them into an opaque black plastic bag before putting them away in the storeroom because the original white bag was very thin and he did not want his parents to see the contents. The white bag D1 was shown to the court by Home Team Specialist Toh Sin Ee and I would mention that it was an almost translucent bag, consistent with Imran’s testimony.17Foot Note 17×NE 19 February 2019, p 28. 39 Imran’s statements, which alluded to prior transactions, were also clear about the delivery: (a) In his first statement (first contemporaneous statement) recorded on 8 February 2017 at 11.49am, where he was queried on various different packets of drugs found in his apartment, Imran stated that the two bundles (C2A1A and C2B1A, the subject of the charges) contained heroin intended for sale, and that the source of the bundles was Tamil, to whom he paid $6,700 on 8 February 2017.18Foot Note 18×Imran’s Statements, p 308. (b) In his third statement (first investigative statement) recorded on 10 February 2017 at 11.05am, Imran stated that he had met up with Tamil and Pragas approximately ten minutes before the CNB arrested him on 8 February 2017. He stated that Tamil and Pragas were supposed to deliver two pounds of heroin to him for $6,700, and that after he met Tamil and Pragas, he returned to his house and confirmed that there were two big bundles of heroin contained in the white plastic bag that he was handed. He then transferred the two bundles to a black plastic bag and placed it on the top shelf of his storeroom. He mentioned that when they spoke, he and Tamil would refer to heroin as cigarettes, in order to avoid detection from the CNB.19Foot Note 19×Imran’s Statements, pp 341–342. (c) Contrary to Pragas’s and Tamil’s narrative of prior deliveries of cigarettes to Imran, Imran’s fourth statement (second investigative statement) recorded on 10 February 2017 at 3.10pm detailed a prior delivery of a pound of heroin, either on 2 February 2017 or 3 February 2017. The contents were in the green and white plastic bag marked C1 found on the top-shelf of his storeroom.20Foot Note 20×Imran’s Statements, p 344. (d) In his fifth statement (third investigative statement) recorded on 11 February 2017 at 11.30am, Imran stated that he had known Tamil since 2015, when they worked together at a company called Totel Oil Asia. He confirmed that the sum of $6,700 was meant as payment to Tamil for two pounds of heroin. He also stated that he had been purchasing heroin from Tamil once a week from sometime in September 2016, save from December 2016 to end-January 2019. Each time, Imran would hand the money to Tamil, and Pragas would subsequently deliver the heroin.21Foot Note 21×Imran’s Statements, p 354–355. (e) Imran’s sixth statement (fourth investigative statement) recorded on 14 February 2017 at 4.00pm contradicted the contention of Pragas and Tamil that their plan was to deliver cigarettes and that Imran had agreed to loan Tamil $6,700. Imran said that he had never lent any money to Tamil or Pragas, nor had they asked to borrow money from him. He also stated that neither Tamil nor Pragas had previously delivered cigarettes to him at his house or at his lift lobby; Imran had only purchased cigarettes from Tamil when they were still working together.22Foot Note 22×Imran’s Statements, p 367. (f) Similarly, his seventh statement recorded on 18 December 2017, which he maintained as accurate at trial, did not dispute the fact that two pounds of heroin were delivered to him.23Foot Note 23×Agreed Bundle (“AB”) 446–447.His defence was aimed atmens rea– his evidence was that he thought the bag contained only one pound of heroin and not two. 40 The investigation scene showed no trace of the two cartons of cigarettes, one of Marlboro Light and another of Gudang Garam, which Pragas and Tamil contended they handed over. This was despite a thorough and lengthy search completed by the officers that morning. Only eight packets of duty-unpaid Malboro Red were recovered from the Unit. 41 In my judgment, it was clear that two pounds of heroin were delivered to Imran. Imran’s evidence in his statements that the price was $6,700 was corroborated by the evidence that $6,700 was found on Tamil at the time of his arrest. Further, SSgt Chew testified during trial that $6,700 for two pounds of heroin would be consistent with market prices in 2017.24Foot Note 24×NE 19 February 2019, p 91. Act of and members to the conspiracy 42 The charge against Imran is that of abetment by conspiracy. While Imran played the role of recipient in the conspiracy to deliver heroin, no defence of consumption was mounted. In his second statement (cautioned statement) recorded on 9 February 2017 at 3.33am, Imran admitted to a charge against him for having in his possession drugs for the purpose of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA. The total amount of drugs stated in that charge was that of “3 bundles and 30 packets containing approximately 1426.85g of granular/powdery substance believed to contain diamorphine”.25Foot Note 25×Imran’s Statements, p 333.In his fourth statement, Imran said he sold heroin to supplement his income.26Foot Note 26×Imran’s Statements, p 346.His conspiracy to take delivery of heroin for the purpose of trafficking falls within the policy purview of the MDA, which was enacted to address the growing problem of drug abuse (seeAliat [64]). His version of events at trial also alluded to his role in the onward distribution of the heroin, albeit to one “55” as Tamil’s courier. I address the alleged role of “55” in more detail below (see [47]). 43 His partner in the conspiracy was primarily Tamil. Imran’s evidence at trial was that on 7 February 2017, Tamil telephoned him in the afternoon to inform him that he had a new shipment of drugs.27Foot Note 27×NE 26 February 2019 at pp 94–95.On the day in question, that which they conspired to do came to pass. Imran took delivery of the two pounds of heroin and paid Tamil $6,700. The $6,700 was recovered from Tamil upon arrest. 44 A last matter concerns the nexus between Imran and Pragas, whose assistance was arranged by Tamil. While Imran gave evidence of similar prior assistance that Pragas rendered Tamil, Imran’s evidence was that he did not communicate with Pragas concerning the delivery of heroin. The only conversation he had with Pragas was on an occasion when he attempted to telephone Tamil, who did not pick up the call. A few minutes later, Pragas returned the call from a different number, informing Imran that Tamil was busy and would return his call.28Foot Note 28×NE 28 February 2019, pp 19 and 21.Pragas’s and Tamil’s evidence, in like vein, was that Pragas did not know what transpired between Tamil and Imran, as Pragas did not directly deal with Imran.29Foot Note 29×NE 1 March 2019, pp 19-21, 5 March 2019, pp 14, 37 and 40-41. 45 On a charge of conspiracy, it is sufficient to “show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand” (seePublic Prosecutor vYeo Choon Poh[1993] 3 SLR(R) 302 (“Yeo Choon Poh”) at [20]). There is no requirement that each member of a criminal conspiracy must have had direct contact with each other. As the Court of Appeal stated inYeo Choon Pohat [19], affirming the words of Whitton J inR v Chew Chong Jin[1956] MLJ 185 at 186: Again it is clear that there need not be communication between each conspirator and every other, provided that there be a common design common to each of them all:R v Meyrick & Ribuffi21 Cr App R 94. 46 It was thus unnecessary for Pragas and Imran to have had direct contact with each other; all that is required is that they shared a common design. The facts make clear that Imran communicated with Tamil to arrange for the delivery of heroin;30Foot Note 30×Closing Submissions for the First Accused, p 39; Prosecution’s Closing Submissions, p 25.and Tamil then secured Pragas to assist in the delivery. The plan came to fruition on 8 February 2017. Tamil’s caution in meeting Imran first and ascertaining payment before calling Pragas was a clear demonstration of the conspiracy, which was successfully carried out. Mental element 47 Imran’s defence was directed at hismens rea, that he intended to traffic in only one pound of heroin. This defence first started emerging in his interviews on 22 February 2017, 24 February 2017 and 1 March 2017 at Changi Prison Complex Medical Centre with Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) consultant Dr Cheow Enquan (“Dr Cheow”), who assessed him to be of sound mind. Dr Cheow’s psychiatric evaluation report, dated 6 March 2017, mentioned that Imran had contended Tamil passed him two bundles of heroin instead of one without his knowledge.31Foot Note 31×AB139.Subsequently, another iteration of his new narrative emerged in his seventh statement recorded some ten months after his arrest, on 18 December 2017 around 11.20am. At that point, Imran contended he was working for Tamil.32Foot Note 32×AB446–447.Imran stated that Tamil had instructed him to hold on to the bundles of heroin, and to wait for a phone call by a Singaporean Indian known as “55”. “55” was a Singaporean Indian who was about 30 years old, skinny, and without any tattoos. After delivering the drugs to “55”, Imran would purportedly collect money on Tamil’s behalf. He would then be paid a sum of $300 by Tamil. This was the position Imran maintained at trial.33Foot Note 33×NE 28 February 2019, pp 62–63, 67. 48 I note here that even if I were to accept Imran’s defence, his actions would nevertheless fall within the definition of trafficking, which includes the sending or delivering of unauthorised drugs (see above at [17]). His defence would simply serve to reduce the weight of drugs trafficked to below the threshold for attracting capital punishment. 49 In any case, I rejected this defence. First, it was evidently raised as an afterthought, and did not square with other aspects of the evidence. Imran’s previous statements contained clear admissions of his awareness of how much heroin he had agreed to traffic. He appears to have begun regretting this on 22 February 2017 when he saw Dr Cheow, and therefore told Dr Cheow he ordered one bundle. I note that this is inconsistent with his evidence at trial that he expected two small bundles, although in both scenarios the amount to be received would likely be under the capital punishment threshold for diamorphine. Imran’s account in his December 2017 statement (that he worked for Tamil as a courier and expected to deliver drugs to “55”) was even more difficult to believe. “55” was clearly a figment of his imagination, as were the allegations that he worked for Tamil for a $300 commission. Imran’s new contention would also require him to explain the $6,700 paid to Tamil, which was otherwise a clear nexus to the sale of two pounds of heroin because it reflected the market price for the same. Imran tried to explain this away by claiming that $3,700 was received from “55” and the remainder was a $3,000 loan he was making to “his boss” Tamil, who would pay him after “55” collected the drugs.34Foot Note 34×NE 28 February 2019, p. 26.This explanation was illogical. If Imran were truly working for Tamil, and being paid $300 per delivery to “55”, why would Tamil require $3,000 from him? In any case, this explanation was not only unsupported by evidence but also contradicted by Tamil, who instead claimed that the entire sum of $6,700 was a loan from Imran for the purchase of cigarettes.35Foot Note 35×NE 5 March 2019, p 10.The only plausible explanation is that Imran paid Tamil $6,700 for two pounds of heroin. 50 Second, Imran’s defence that he intended to traffic in only one pound of heroin could not withstand cross-examination. Acceptance of Imran’s version of events at trial would require acceptance that Imran could not tell the difference in weight between one and two pounds of heroin. The difference in weight should have been apparent to Imran – and indeed was, as I shall explain – the moment Pragas handed him the white plastic bag, in light of the fact that Imran was familiar with receiving and dealing drugs. When pressed, he conceded during cross-examination that he took the bag despite being able to feel the difference in the weight. The relevant part of the transcript is as follows:36Foot Note 36×NE 28 February 2019, p 63. Q: So don’t you agree, Mr Imran, when you take over the plastic bag, you will immediately know that this weighs twice the normal weight that you normally collect from Pragas or Tamil? A: I did not realise that because at that time I was rushing. I took the bag and immediately went back to my house. Q: But when you take the bag, you would feel the weight, correct? You carry in your hands. A: I took the plastic bag. I went back home, I wanted to check---and Tamil and Pragas had already left. Once I took the plastic bag, they left. Q: No. Mr Imran, my point is, the moment you carry the plastic bag and you take it over from Pragas, you would have known this is twice the weight as compared to what you normally received. A:I could feel the difference but they had already left. So I went back home and I checked the plastic bag. [Emphasis added in italics] 51 His excuse that, while he “could feel the difference”, “they had already left” was unconvincing, as his admission was that he could feel the differenceonce the bag was in his hand. He could have called Tamil and Pragas back to seek an explanation: when they left him, they were merely walking to the stairwell and down the stairs. Imran’s excuse must further be weighed against another piece of his own evidence, to the effect that there was a previous delivery just immediately before the 8 February 2017 delivery, either on 2 or 3 February 2017, where he had been given “four small bundles but what was promised were [sic]two small bundles”.37Foot Note 37×NE 26 February 2019, p 92.If so, on 8 February, he ought to have been more cautious about the number of bundles he was given. This is a wholly different situation from past cases such asPublic Prosecutor v Muhammad Farid bin Mohd Yusop[2015] 3 SLR 16 (“Farid”), where the accused had similarly alleged that he had entered into an agreement with his supplier to traffic in a non-capital quantity of drugs. There, at [25]–[33], the Court of Appeal accepted the accused’s assertion that he did not know he was carrying more than 250g of Ice. In reaching this decision, the court placed emphasis on the fact that there was no “inherent contradiction” between the accused’s statements and his defence, as well as the fact that the weight of Ice delivered on three prior occasions was 250g or less (seeFaridat [28] and [32]). In contrast, in this case, Imran has no basis for such sanguinity. Indeed, by Imran’s own admission, Tamil had previously delivered to him an excessive amount of heroin. This being the case, he must surely have been cognisant of the possibility of a misdelivery occurring yet again on 8 February 2017.",
        "Conclusion on charge against Imran": "52 I found therefore that the charge against Imran for abetment by conspiracy to traffic in not less than 19.42g of diamorphine was made out beyond reasonable doubt. I convicted him accordingly.",
        "Pragas": "",
        "Elements of common intention": "91 As mentioned above at [22], the common intention charge that Pragas and Tamil faced required: (a) the criminal act element, in this case that of delivery of the heroin to Imran; (b) the common intention element, in this case the plan to do so; and (c) the participation element. 92 Tamil’s defence at trial was aligned with Pragas’s, and focused on the factual element of the delivery of heroin. They were there to deliver cigarettes, and cigarettes were indeed what they delivered on 8 February 2017. He did not deny that he facilitated and orchestrated a delivery to Imran; his defence was only that what he coordinated was a delivery of cigarettes. The criminal act element 93 I have found that the act of delivery of heroin was committed (see [41] in the context of Imran and [68] in the context of Pragas). 94 Dealing then with the use of Imran’s statement against Tamil, I considered Imran’s motives for implicating Tamil. Tamil sought to argue that Imran was an unreliable witness, and that his testimony as to his receipt of heroin from Pragas was a lie. He raised the following key points: first, that Imran had changed his evidence regarding the provenance of certain drugs that were seized; second, that Imran had initially claimed that he had repacked drugs for sale to one “Apai” before later claiming that he was actually working for Tamil to deliver drugs to “55”; and finally, that Imran possessed strong reasons to lie to the CNB officers and the court due to his perception that he would be given a lighter sentence if he were to provide the CNB with fabricated statements. 95 In contrast to Pragas, Imran possessed an incentive to minimise his role in his dealings with Tamil, in view of his attempt to explain that he only ordered one pound of heroin, and the existence of “Apai” and “55” In this context, I earlier rejected these claims that he had been working for Tamil: see above at [48]. Nevertheless, these spurious claims did not detract from the admission that heroin was delivered. Imran’s evidence on the delivery remained consistent in court. This heroin delivery was supported by the $6,700 found on Tamil and the absence of external evidence with regard to the two cartons of contraband cigarettes that were purportedly delivered, as highlighted above at [40] and [63]. The common intention element 96 On the issue of common intention, Imran’s statements and evidence in court were clear that the intention of Tamil was to deliver heroin. My findings above, at [81], in the context of the common intention of Pragas and Tamil are also relevant. 97 In addition, as far as the charge against Tamil was concerned, while Tamil sought to argue that his intention was to deliver cigarettes, his own account of events was inconsistent. Tamil did not challenge the voluntariness of his six statements although at trial he sought to disown them at various junctures by contending that he had been stressed, shocked, confused, afraid or did not want to implicate others.55Foot Note 55×NE 5 March 2019, p. 59, line 19; NE 5 March p. 42, line 10; NE NE 5 March 2019, p. 59, line 1; NE 5 March 2019, p. 4, line 18; NE 5 March 2019, p. 6 lines 20-21.I turn to explain the inconsistencies between the various statements. 98 Tamil’s first two contemporaneous statements were a denial:56Foot Note 56×AB282–292. (a) In his first statement (first contemporaneous statement) recorded on 8 February 2017 at about 10.40am, Tamil claimed that he had gone to visit Imran in order to borrow a sum of $7,000 dollars. According to Tamil, he had gone to meet Imran alone, but Pragas “also went up” to Imran’s lift lobby to meet Imran and Pragas. Tamil said that when he left, Pragas was still speaking to Imran. Tamil also said that he would sell cigarettes to Imran; their arrangement was for Tamil to borrow money from Imran first, before using that sum to purchase cigarettes for him from Malaysia. Typically, either Pragas or Tamil would bring in the contraband cigarettes from Malaysia. (b) In his second statement (second contemporaneous statement) recorded on 8 February 2017 at about 11.30am., Tamil was shown some pictures of seized exhibits recovered from Imran. Tamil claimed that he did not recognise them, and that he did not deliver anything to Imran that morning. 99 It was only from 9 February 2017,the same date that Pragasstarted to advance his narrative about cigarette delivery, that Tamil did the same: (a) In his third statement (first cautioned statement) recorded on 9 February 2017 at about 4.10am, Tamil stated that he had known Imran for more than a year and that Imran would always purchase cigarettes from him. He claimed that Imran would usually order one or two cartons of cigarettes per week, and that he had met Imran to borrow money from him on the morning of 8 February 2017. He reiterated that when he left, Pragas and Imran were still speaking to each other. Tamil only realised that Pragas was following him a while later. Tamil reiterated that he did not deliver anything to Imran that morning.57Foot Note 57×AB338. (b) In his fourth statement (first investigative statement) recorded on 12 February 2017 at about 2.20pm, Tamil claimed that he had met Imran while they were working at the same factory in Tuas, and that he had started to purchase cartons of cigarettes for Imran from Malaysia then. Over time, Imran only paid Tamil about $70 to $80 for a carton of cigarettes. Tamil would order between one to four cartons of cigarettes at a time. Theirmodus operandiwas for Tamil to deliver the cigarettes to Imran at his home, whereupon Imran would pay Tamil in cash.58Foot Note 58×AB368–371. (c) In his fifth statement (second investigative statement) recorded on 13 February 2017 at about 10.45am, Tamil stated he had introduced Pragas to Imran sometime in 2016, as he intended for Pragas to help him with the delivery of contraband cigarettes. Tamil claimed that he was only able to smuggle two cartons of cigarettes in his bag at a time, and that he required Pragas’s assistance to smuggle an additional two cartons. He also stated that he had previously instructed Imran to call Pragas directly to arrange for the delivery of cigarettes when he had personal matters to attend to. On 7 February 2017, Imran had offered to lend a sum of $6,700 to $6,800 to Tamil for the latter to purchase cigarette cartons. That same night, Pragas had called Tamil to inform him that he was delivering two cartons of cigarettes to Imran the next morning. On 8 February 2017, Tamil had met Imran at his lift lobby on the fourth storey, where he received a stack of money from Imran that was wrapped in a rubber band. When Tamil was about to leave, Pragas appeared. Tamil parted ways with Imran then, and did not notice what Pragas and Imran were doing. Afterwards, when Tamil was walking to his motorcycle, he noticed that Pragas was walking behind him.59Foot Note 59×AB373–376. (d) In his sixth statement (third investigative statement) recorded on 14 February 2017 at about 10.45am, Tamil claimed that he had been helping his friend, “Prakash” who resided in Johor Bahru, to sell illegal cigarettes. On average, Tamil would purchase 100 cartons of cigarettes at a time, which would cost him RM15,000. Tamil stated that that was the reason he needed to borrow so much money from Imran. He claimed that he would borrow a sum of $4,000 to $7,000 from Imran once every two weeks to buy his stock of cigarettes. Tamil said that he did not have the handphone number of “Prakash” stored in any of his handphones that were seized from him. He also stressed that both Imran and Pragas did not know about the existence of “Prakash”.60Foot Note 60×AB378–381. 100 His changes of position may be summed up as follows. Tamil, in his first two statements on 8 February 2017, initially denied that he was involved in delivering any goods to Imran on 8 February 2017 and claimed ignorance of Pragas’s purpose in meeting Imran. From his third statement on 9 February 2017, he changed his account of events, stating that he had introduced Pragas and Imran to each other in order for Pragas to deliver cigarettes to Imran; he claimed that Pragas had informed him on 7 February 2017 that he would be delivering cigarettes to Imran on 8 February 2017. Tamil nevertheless insisted that he was not involved in any delivery of goods to Imran on 8 February 2017. Subsequently, at trial, Tamil changed his evidence yet again to align himself with Pragas. When he was brought through his statements by his counsel, he requested to make amendments to all six of them, in order to reflect that he and Pragas had, together, handed two cartons of cigarettes to Imran.61Foot Note 61×NE 5 March 2019, pp 3–9. 101 Further, despite having never mentioned this in his first five statements, Tamil, in his sixth statement, alleged that he required large sums of money once every fortnight in order to purchase large quantities of cigarettes from his friend, “Prakash”.62Foot Note 62×AB378.Apart from the fact that this crucial fact was not mentioned in his prior statements, it made little sense that Imran would agree to loan Tamil large sums of money for him to purchase 100 cartons of cigarettes at a time, especially when, as stated by Tamil, neither Imran nor Pragas knew of the purported existence of “Prakash”. At trial, Tamil further complicated his account, claiming instead that he would borrow money from Imran “whenever [he] needed money”,63Foot Note 63×NE 5 March, p 9.rather than once every fortnight, and that the amount of $6,700 that he received from Imran went towards the purchase price for an order of 400 cartons of cigarettes placed by Imran.64Foot Note 64×NE 5 March, p 10.This contention was raised for the first time during Tamil’s examination-in-chief at trial, and his counsel conceded at closing arguments that the fresh allegation was not put to Imran, who testified first. Further, on Tamil’s own evidence, past transactions ranged from one to four cartons per delivery. The 400 cartons were a wholly anomalous amount that was necessitated by the mathematics of dividing $6,700 by the price of a carton of cigarettes. These were mere assertions to justify his receipt of $6,700, the clearest nexus with his having arranged the delivery of the heroin. 102 Tamil’s account was not supported by any surrounding evidence. He claimed that he had agreed to deliver one carton of Gudang Garam cigarettes and one carton of Marlboro Light cigarettes.65Foot Note 65×NE 5 March 2019, p 10.But no such contraband cigarettes were found in the Unit. After a lengthy search, the CNB officers only recovered eight packets of contraband Marlboro Red cigarettes. Although Imran’s father gave evidence that he found an additional packet of contraband cigarettes with red and white packaging within the storeroom while cleaning up the storeroom,66Foot Note 66×NE 21 February 2019, pp 53-54.this did not support any inference that the officers had missed a carton of Gudang Garam and a carton of MarlboroLightin their search. Red and white packaging is used for MarlboroRedcigarettes. In further contradiction of Tamil’s account, the officers found the empty white plastic bag, consistent with Imran’s evidence that he put the contents of the white bag into C2, the black plastic bag, in order to evade detection from his parents (because the storeroom was a common use area). 103 I was therefore satisfied that the common intention of Tamil and Pragas were clearly that of delivery of two bundles of heroin. Participation element 104 Tamil’s evidence alluded to his role as the person who planned the delivery with Imran, albeit of cigarettes which I did not accept. His coordination with Pragas was reflected in the agreed statement of facts. He first went up to check on Imran, and then telephoned Pragas, who then, duly summoned, delivered the drugs. 105 The concept of deemed possession under s 18(4) of the MDA also applied to the issue of Tamil’s participation. This provision reads: Where one of 2 or more persons with theknowledge and consentof the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them. [emphasis added in italics] 106 “Consent” was explained by the Court of Appeal inRidzuanat [63], as having “power or authority over the object in question” [emphasis omitted]. InRidzuan, the court found that the accused had been instrumental in putting his co-accused in actual physical possession of the drugs; he had made the necessary arrangements for his co-accused to receive the drugs from their supplier (see [65] ofRidzuan). The element of consent, as well as knowledge, was thus readily satisfied. Similarly here, Tamil had orchestrated the sale of heroin to Imran and recruited Pragas to assist him. As Pragas had the heroin in his possession with the knowledge and consent of Tamil, Tamil would also be deemed to be in possession of the heroin. Tamil’s participation element would in that case be characterised as a delivery to Imran made jointly by Pragas and himself. Alternative analysis 107 I also considered the alternative analysis for Tamil’s primary liability under s 5(1)(b) of the MDA. The first element, that of trafficking, was made out as the delivery of the heroin was pursuant to Tamil’s plan. Section 18(4) applied in this context. The second element would be knowledge of the nature of the drug. From my findings as to Tamil’s role and the chain of events which culminated in Tamil’s receipt of $6,700, it is clear that Tamil possessed actual knowledge of the drugs for which he coordinated the delivery.",

The first requirement is the accused’s role as a courier. I held that Imran and Tamil were not couriers. Pragas was a courier, in view of his limited delivery role. The second requirement is a certificate of substantial assistance from the Public Prosecutor. This was not furnished in respect of all three accused persons. I therefore sentenced all three accused persons to the mandatory sentence of death.
