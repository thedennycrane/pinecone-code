        "WBL": "2       WBL is a public company listed on the Singapore\n                    Exchange Ltd (“SGX”). In 2007, it had about 90 active\n                    subsidiaries. WBL’s principal activities are in Technology Manufacturing,\n                    Automotive Distribution, Technology Solutions and Investments. The Technology\n                    Manufacturing division consists of,inter alia, a\n                    Flexible Printed Circuits business (“FPC”) and a Precision\n                    Engineering Unit. At the material time, WBL had a number of subsidiaries under\n                    its FPC business, including Multi-Fineline Electronix Inc\n                    (“M-Flex”) and MFS Technology Ltd (“MFS”). M-Flex\n                    was listed on the SGX while MFS was a company listed on NASDAQ, an American\n                    securities exchange. WBL held approximately 75% of the issued shares in MFS and\n                    55% of the issued shares in M-Flex. While WBL did not manage MFS and M-Flex on a\n                    daily basis, it had nominee directors sitting on the Board of Directors of both\n                    companies. Another subsidiary of WBL was Wearnes Precision (Thailand) Limited\n                    (“WPT”), a company belonging to WBL’s Precision Engineering\n                    unit with operations in Thailand. 3       At the material time, WBL’s senior\n                    management comprised of Tan Choon Seng (“CS Tan”) its\n                    Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Wong Hein Jee\n                    (“Wong” who is also known as Lester) the Chief Financial Officer\n                    (“CFO”), Lew (the Group General Manager for Enteprise Risk\n                    Management at the time) and Tan Swee Hong(“Swee Hong”),\n                    WBL’s Company Secretary and Group General Manager for Legal and\n                    Compliance. Lew, an accountant by training, joined WBL in 1998 as its Group\n                    Financial Controller and became the equivalent of the CFO in 2002. He became\n                    WBL’s Group General Manager in 2006. Soh Yew Hock (“Soh”)\n                    was a Non-Independent and Executive Director of WBL between 1994 and July 2007.\n                    CS Tan, Wong and Swee Hong testified for MAS and WBL while Soh was Lew’s\n                    witness. 4       It would be useful, at this juncture, to provide\n                    some background on how WBL operated. When CS Tan took over as WBL’s CEO in\n                    December 2004, he instituted the Group Management Council (“GMC”)\n                    to support WBL’s Board of Directors in strategic, operational and\n                    financial matters. The GMC would typically meet every Monday at 8.30am (the\n                    “GMC Meeting”). These GMC Meetings were chaired by CS Tan and\n                    attended by members of the GMC and WBL’s senior management. At the\n                    material time, the GMC Meetings alternated, on a weekly basis, between\n                    operational meetings (where operational matters and strategy were discussed) and\n                    financial meetings (where financial forecasts of WBL’s performance were\n                    provided). On a number of occasions, CS Tan informed the attendees of GMC\n                    Meetings that the information presented and discussed at the meetings was\n                    confidential. 5       At the GMC meetings, it was common for financial\n                    forecasts to be presented by WBL’s finance department through Microsoft\n                    Powerpoint presentation slides. Most of WBL subsidiaries (save for the smaller\n                    ones) would submit a forecast to their respective division heads, who would in\n                    turn submit their forecasts to WBL. Wong’s evidence was that most of\n                    WBL’s subsidiaries had a qualified accountant and that the closer the\n                    forecasts were made and submitted towards the end of each quarter, the greater\n                    their accuracy in their reflection of the figures for that quarter. These\n                    Microsoft Powerpoint presentation slides were not distributed to the attendees\n                    of GMC Meetings due to their confidential nature. 6       Lew’s position was that these GMC Meetings\n                    were not taken seriously by WBL’s senior management. He claimed that: (a)\n                    GMC Meetings, which he labelled a “Grand Master Circus”, were\n                    unstructured and not taken seriously; (b) no substantive decisions were made at\n                    these meetings; (c) important discussions were taken offline; and (d) decisions\n                    made at GMC Meetings were not implemented. 7       I cannot accept Lew’s evidence. First, his\n                    own witness, Soh, had agreed that during those GMC Meetings: (a) important\n                    and/or confidential matters were discussed; (b) substantive decisions were made;\n                    (c) updates were given about important matters in the WBL group; (d) it was not\n                    true that most matters discussed were trivial; (e) the meetings were not\n                    incoherent, a circus or a farce; and (f) the most up-to-date financial\n                    information was revealed during the meetings, contradicting Lew’s evidence\n                    entirely on this point. In addition, Soh had also agreed that financial\n                    forecasts that were provided towards the end of every quarter were more\n                    reliable. Second, in cross-examination, Lew had retracted his statement that no\n                    substantive decisions were made at GMC Meetings. Third, Lew had also agreed that\n                    confidential information such as financial data was given during GMC Meetings,\n                    thereby contradicting his statement that such meetings were a circus or a farce.\n                    I therefore reject Lew’s evidence on this point. It was clear on the\n                    evidence that important discussions and decisions were made at the GMC\n                    Meetings. 8       The claim of MAS against Lew relates to the sale\n                    of his WBL shares on 4 July 2007, two days after a GMC Meeting during which\n                    (it was alleged) material price-sensitive information was made known to Lew. The\n                    price-sensitive information pertained to two matters, namely that: (a)     WBL was going to make a loss;\n                        and (b)     it would be\n                        taking an impairment charge on WPT. I will now set out\n                    the facts leading to the receipt of what MAS alleged, was material\n                    price-sensitive information by Lew and his trade in WBL shares.",
        "Information announced by WBL prior to the 2 July 2007 GMC\n                Meeting": "9       On 14 February 2006, WBL announced a net\n                    attributable profit (i.e., the profit after tax and minority interest\n                    (“PATMI”)) of $25.8m for the first quarter of FY 2006 (“Q1\n                    FY06”), up from $7.9m in the first quarter of FY 2005. In Q1 FY 06,\n                    M-Flex and MFS contributed $41.9m and $17.8m to WBL’s pre-tax profit\n                    respectively. As for its prospects for the next quarter, i.e. the second quarter\n                    of FY 06 (“Q2 FY06”), WBL opined that: [WBL] expects its second quarter results barring unforeseen circumstances,\n                        to continue to be positive year-on-year. However, due to the shorter\n                        reporting period and the seasonality of sales of electronic products in the\n                        second quarter, the Technology Manufacturing Division is likely to report\n                        slower sales compared to the first quarter. The Automotive and Technology\n                        Solutions Divisions are also likely to see keen competition and increasing\n                        pressure on margins.Hence, the company is cautiously\n                            optimistic about its overall performance for Q2\n                        FY2006. [emphasis added] 10     On 11 May 2006, WBL announced a net\n                    attributable profit of $40m for the first half of FY 2006, which meant that it\n                    made a net attributable profit of $14.5m for Q2 FY06. Again, M-Flex and MFS were\n                    singled out for achieving “good sales”, with the Technology\n                    Manufacturing division earning a pre-tax profit of over $92m. As for its\n                    prospects for the second half of FY 2006, WBL opined that: [WBL] expects its performance for the rest of the year, barring unforeseen\n                        circumstances, to improve over last year. The Technology Manufacturing\n                        Division is likely to report continued strong sales from existing customers\n                        and M-Flex is also expected to roll out several new patented products. The\n                        Automotive Division will launch several new models in the later part of the\n                        year which should have a positive impact on revenue. However, the Technology\n                        Solutions Division is likely to face keen competition and increasing\n                        pressure on margins. The company expects to continue to unlock value from\n                        its property holdings in the investments portfolio in the second half of\n                        FY2006. In its financial statement for Q2 FY06, WBL noted that: The performance of the Group’s other technology manufacturing\n                        operations were affected by continued streamlining… the performance\n                        of the precision operations in Thailand was affected by further provisions\n                        made for inventory write offs. Hence the operations recorded a pre-tax loss\n                        of $3.1 m for the quarter. … Developments in Q3 FY 2006 The Group is cautiously optimistic on the performance\n                            of its core businesses in Q3 2006. [emphasis in italics added] 11     On 11 August 2006, WBL announced a net\n                    attributable profit of $9m in the third quarter of FY2006 (“Q3\n                    FY06”), down from $32.5m in the third quarter of FY 2005 (“Q3\n                    FY05”). CS Tan observed that the Technology Manufacturing Division had a\n                    challenging quarter due to eroded margins, and that while WBL was disappointed\n                    in WPT’s “larger than expected losses”, it was confident of\n                    recovery “as we have addressed the issues there”. The announcement\n                    also stated that: The Precision operations recorded losses of $6.6 million; this was mostly\n                        from the Thailand operations, which had cost over-runs because it made good\n                        contractual and customer obligations for the delayed delivery of several\n                        products. The management team has put in place an action plan to reduce\n                        costs, improve operational quality and delivery issues and change its\n                        product mix to higher margin products. Looking forward, WBL noted that: (a) the Technology Manufacturing\n                    Division and the Technology Solutions Division were likely to face continued\n                    pressures on margin; (b) the Automotive Division would only start to deliver new\n                    models in Q1 FY07; and (c) WBL would continue to unlock value from its property\n                    holdings in the fourth quarter of FY 2006 (“Q4 FY06”). The\n                    financial statement for the Q3 FY 06 results indicated that WBL: expect[ed] to continue with its efforts to streamline operations and\n                        divest non-core property holdings in FY 2006. Hence it [was] cautiously\n                        optimistic about its performance for Q4 FY 2006 and for the full\n                        year. 12     On 23 November 2006, WBL announced a net\n                    attributable profit of $58.9m for all of FY06, up from $7.7m in FY05. This meant\n                    that it made a net attributable profit of approximately $9m in Q4 FY06. In its\n                    announcement, WBL noted that: For FY 2006, the precision manufacturing operations of the Group\n                        significantly affected the performance of the Technology Manufacturing\n                        Division. It recorded losses of $11.9 m for the whole year,mainly from the Thailand plant which made good contractual and\n                            customer obligations for several low margin products. Going ahead, the\n                            Group expects the Thai operations to perform better, and has already\n                            started to see the turnaround there. … [CS Tan added]: “We still have work to do to streamline and unlock\n                        value in FY 2007. The core FPC businesses are likely to face increased\n                        competition. We believe that our efforts to streamline and focus have made\n                        us more resilient and better able to tackle the challenges ahead as we\n                        continue to unlock value for shareholders in a more challenging global\n                        environment.” [emphasis added] 13     On 14 February 2007, WBL announced a net\n                    attributable profit of $7.4m for the first quarter of FY 2007 (“Q1\n                    FY07”). CS Tan observed that it was a “challenging quarter with\n                    continued margin compression in the Technology Manufacturing Division”.\n                    The announcement also noted that: The precision manufacturing operations of the Group continue to face\n                        losses related to contractual obligations to a major customer. It is\n                        negotiating with this customer for better prices. The financial statement for Q1 FY07 observed that: The precision manufacturing operations of the Group continued to drag on\n                        the performance of the Division. It had losses of $6.0million for the\n                        quarter. The operations will continue to focus on reducing costs and to\n                        negotiate with a major customer to improve the margins on several\n                        products. … Developments in Q2 FY 2007 In line with the announcement by the Group’s subsidiaries, [M-Flex]\n                        and [MFS], the FPC sector is expected to continue to face stiff competition\n                        and lower gross margins. The Automotive Division expects continued keen competition in the\n                        Singapore market. The Technology Solutions Division is also likely to face increasing\n                        pressure on margins due to more aggressive competition. The Group will continue with its efforts to streamline operations. 14     On 12 May 2007, WBL announced a net\n                    attributable profit of $1.7m for the second quarter of FY 2007 (“Q2\n                    FY07”). CS Tan observed that it was a “challenging half\n                    year”. The announcement noted that: The precision manufacturing operations in Thailand continued to perform\n                        poorly and incurred retrenchment costs as it scaled back production due to a\n                        drop in sales volume. It recorded a loss of $11.2 million for the half year,\n                        compared with a loss of $2.5 million in the first half of FY 2006. The Group\n                        will continue to restructure the operations in Thailand. CS Tan also observed, in the announcement, that: As we continue to navigate a challenging year, we expect our Technology\n                        Manufacturing Division to face continued pressure on margins. The Group is\n                        accelerating its plans to divest some non-core assets and believes that\n                        together with the Automotive Division, this could help counter some of the\n                        cyclical uncertainties related to the technology business. In the financial statement for Q2 FY07, it was noted that: The Group’s precision operations in Thailand had retrenchment costs\n                        and lower revenue related to the fall in demand from its largest customer.\n                        These contributed to attributable losses of $5.3 million. … Developments for the rest of the\n                        year In line with continued margin compression in the Group’s core\n                        Technology Manufacturing Division, and in line with the announcement by its\n                        subsidiaries, M-Flex and MFS, the Group is cautious about its performance\n                        for the rest of the year.",
        "Internal Discussions on WPT": "15     While WPT was not a major component of\n                    WBL’s revenue, it was regarded as a problematic entity, having\n                    consistently recorded losses over a number of quarters, as follows: Q4 FY 05Q1 FY 06Q2 FY 06Q3 FY 06Q4 FY 06Net loss\n                                        (pre-tax)$6.1m$0.7m$2.2m$5.9m$4.4m   The 20 November 2006 Audit Committee Meeting 16     WPT’s losses did not go unnoticed by\n                    WBL’s management and board of directors. On 20 November 2006, an\n                    Audit Committee (“AC”) meeting was held. CS Tan, Wong and Lew\n                    attended the meeting. At this meeting, WPT’s performance was discussed.\n                    The minutes indicated that WBL’s management took the view that the taking\n                    of an impairment was unnecessary, and that WPT would be able to break even by\n                    the third quarter of financial year 2007 (“Q3 FY07”) and even make\n                    a profit in the following quarter by making operational changes, including\n                    effecting cost-cutting measures of approximately $6m. At this meeting, CS Tan\n                    had said that Dr Lim, another member of WBL’s Board of Directors,\n                    would present an update on WPT’s performance for WBL’s Board of\n                    Directors and that an implementation plan would be prepared. The 9 February 2007 Audit Committee Meeting 17     On 9 February 2007, another AC meeting\n                    was held (the “9 February 2007 AC Meeting”). CS Tan, Wong and\n                    Lew attended the meeting. By then, WPT had already recorded losses in Q1 FY07\n                    that were greater than projected. There were discussions as to whether it was\n                    necessary to take an impairment on 31 December 2007. WBL’s\n                    management took the view that it was unnecessary to do so. Tan Bee Nah,\n                    WBL’s external auditor, briefed the AC on the impairment issue, noting\n                    that: [T]he issue of impairment is highly judgmental as it is highly dependent\n                        on the following key assumptions, including: (a)    Finalisation and acceptance of the revised terms\n                            (as set out in Appendix 1) with Nidec; (b)    Securing contracts from new customers (such as SC\n                            Wado) and new businesses [such as the Molex business from Wearnes\n                            Precision (Shenyang)]; and (c)    Cost reduction initiatives (including headcount\n                            reduction, improvement of yield and quality). 18     Both CS Tan and Dr Lim explained to the\n                    AC that: [A] number of the loss-making contracts had been terminated and a review\n                        of the sub-contractors had been performed to eliminate those which were not\n                        competitive. WPT also threatened to terminate their business relationship\n                        with Nidec due to the loss making business, and successfully negotiated\n                        better terms with Nidec, including an increase of selling prices…\n                        Dr Lim shared that the increase in selling prices with Nidec will take\n                        effect from… February and Nidec will review the selling prices with\n                        WPT on a month to month basis, depending on the production yield. Chairman enquired whether there will be an upward trend in the next\n                        quarter. Mr Lai Teck Poh also enquired whether the projections were based on\n                        realistic or optimistic assumptions. Dr Lim Huat Seng replied that\n                        based on the actual results to date, the loss was about $1.3m in January but\n                        was expected to reduce significantly in February and March. The projection\n                        of the $3.1 m loss included a $1 m retrenchment cost for reducing the\n                        headcount by 566. After some deliberations on the assumptions, the Committee agreed that no\n                        impairment charge be recorded at 31 December 2006.However, the Committee said that the performance of WPT will need to be\n                            monitored; an impairment of the assets will need to be considered if WPT\n                            performs worse than the projections of a $3.1m loss for Q207 (excluding\n                            the effects of one-off charges such as the retrenchment\n                            payments). [emphasis added] 19     Lew gave evidence that the AC had, at this\n                    meeting, decided that WPT would without further discussion take an impairment in\n                    Q2 FY07 if it incurred more than $3.1m in losses. During cross-examination, Lew\n                    accepted that his position was not reflected in the minutes. When asked why he\n                    did not amend the minutes, he gave a number of different excuses claiming that:\n                    (a) the minutes were not received for verification; (b) it was not for him to\n                    amend the minutes since it was only for the AC members; (c) he had talked to\n                    Dr Lim and the minute-taker about this discrepancy; and, (d) it was not for\n                    the attendees of the AC meetings to challenge the minutes, and that he had never\n                    been asked whether he agreed with the minutes in all the years he had attended\n                    meetings. However, WBL produced three emails (dated 23 January 2007,\n                    5 April 2007 (in relation to the 9 February 2007 AC Meeting) and\n                    9 July 2007 (in relation to the 8 May 2007 AC Meeting)), where Lew\n                    responded to requests to review the minutes of the AC meetings. In two of those\n                    instances, Lew proposed changes to the minutes. Questioned, Lew claimed he was\n                    “mistaken”, conceded that there was a practice of sending minutes\n                    internally for verification, but insisted that he did not have authority to make\n                    any substantive amendments to the minutes. I reject Lew’s evidence on this\n                    point as his testimony was not corroborated by any other witness. It beggars\n                    belief that such a high-ranking employee of the company could not make any\n                    substantive changes to the minutes if necessary or, that the\n                    “mistake” had not been spotted by any of the other seven\n                    addressees of the e-mails seeking verification of the same. In my view, it was\n                    more likely than not that no firm decision to take an impairment in Q2 FY07 was\n                    taken at the 9 February 2007 AC Meeting, if the results were\n                    unfavourable. The 8 May 2007 Audit Committee Meeting 20     At the next AC meeting held on 8 May 2007\n                    attended by CS Tan, Wong and Lew (the “8 May 2007 AC\n                    Meeting”), it was reported that WPT’s losses for Q2 FY07 were\n                    higher than expected. The minutes indicated that a number of explanations were\n                    given for those losses. There were also discussions on whether WPT had to take\n                    an impairment charge. The minutes stated: [Wong] briefed the AC on the updated impairment analysis prepared in Q207,\n                        which showed no impairment in value of WPT assets. [Wong] stated that the\n                        key assumptions made by management and mentioned that the updated impairment\n                        analysis is heavily dependent on a key assumption of getting a new key\n                        customer…. WPT is in an advanced stage of negotiation with [the new\n                        customer]… for hard-disk drive business and believe that WPT will be\n                        able to turnaround with this key customer who offers a much better pricing\n                        and volume. In response to Dr Cham Tao Soon’s question on the value of\n                        fixed assets at risk,Ms Tan Bee Nah [from\n                            PricewaterhouseCoopers] stated that the value at risk is $22 million,\n                            excluding freehold land and building. If freehold land and building are\n                            included, the value at risk is $30.5 million. [CS Tan] updated the AC that management is in the process of negotiating\n                        with two parties… Dr Cham Tao Soon [the AC Chairperson] enquired about the expected\n                        date that the [deal with the new customer] will be completed, and that a\n                        cut-off date should be set to decide when impairment charge is to be\n                        recorded.Mr Tan Choon Seng proposed a cut-off date of\n                            Q307, and an impairment charge should be recognised if there is no\n                            progress by then. The AC agreed. Ms Tan Bee Nah added that the benchmark should not be against the Q3\n                        forecast (as it is now May 2007 and discussion with [the new customer] is\n                        still on-going), but rather milestones such as whether agreement has been\n                        signed. [emphasis added] 21     Further, in Microsoft Powerpoint presentation slides that were prepared for this meeting, it was observed that WBL could adopt either of the following options in respect of WPT: 1.Re-build?Only if JVC and/or [Panasonic] HDD business firmed up within the next 30 days?Analysis clearly shows viable & profitable business under any normal situation?WPT operations not viable without HDD business?Little confidence that current WPT team able to deliver?…?Very high risk option since still require several more quarters of losses before turnaround2.Immediate Shutdown?Most predictable outcome?High one-time write-off of up to S$30 million?Reputation related risks3.Sell off WPT as an ongoing business concern?Attractive to potential buyer only with HDD business secured?Risk of not finding buyer within short time frame?Continuing operational losses in meantime?No asset impairment in current quarter.

        "The 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting": "22     On 2 July 2007, a financial GMC Meeting\n                    was chaired by CS Tan (“2 July 2007 GMC Meeting”). This\n                    meeting was held 2 days after the end of the Q3 FY07 on 30 June 2007. Wong, Swee\n                    Hong and Lew were also attendees. The evidence suggested that the meeting was\n                    not pleasant with voices being (at the least) raised thereat. A Microsoft\n                    Powerpoint presentation of WBL’s financial forecasts for Q3 FY07 and Q4\n                    FY07 was provided at the meeting, as follows: Pre-tax ProfitProfit after Tax and Minority\n                                    InterestsTechnology\n                                            Manufacturing(4.6 m)(4.8 m)Technology\n                                        Solutions0.9 m1.2 mAutomotive5.1 m4.4 mInvestments4.0 m2.7 mCorporate\n                                    HQ(4.4 m)(4.8 m)Stock Option Expenses &\n                                            SARS(1.1 m)(1.0 m)WBL Total\n                                                (w/o MFS/[M-Flex])(0.0\n                                                m)(2.3\n                                                m)MFS/MFI4.2 m1.8 mWBL\n                                                Total4.2\n                                                m(0.4\n                                                m)   [emphasis original] 23     The forecasts were based on actual results in April and May 2007 and best estimates for June 2007, but did not take into account any impairment charge to be taken on WPT. The minutes of this meeting stated as follow: Subject 1 Tech Manufacturing … 1.1 Wearnes Precision ThailandContinued losses, more than forecast due to exchange rate loss. Q3 forecast -$4.7m. Operational loss is $3.5m. $1.1m exchange rate loss.1.1.1  Decision point on divesting the plant must be made by next week. [CS Tan] points out that the original drop dead date was June 30th.Would like to see an end by 31stJuly and greater sense of urgency. Likely to take an impairment this quarter for the entire Group and write it off totally instead of continuing to lose money as has been the last 3 quarters.Action Items1.1.2  Lester updates that the past 2 weeks, there were visits related to a big buyer looking into WPT. This week the buyers are going to make a decision and that it may be necessary to get a new valuer as the old valuation was unrealistically high.Lester to follow up…3 Overall Group Forecast3.1 Performance will be loss of $2.3million without MFS n MFLEX.WBL total: with MFLEX n MFS, will be loss of $0.4m.…5 Action Items5.1 Need to take a full impairment for Q3 and move on.…5.3 Need a solid decision on WPT.Lester   [emphasis in italics added] 24     CS Tan testified that he had told the\n                    attendees that a full impairment had to be taken on WPT’s assets in Q3\n                    FY07, unless the deal to sell WPT as a going concern was concluded within a\n                    week. CS Tan and Wong also stated that Wong had indicated that the chances of a\n                    sale were “very slim”. However, even if a sale materialised, WBL\n                    would still have to recognise an impairment charge because WPT would have been\n                    sold at distressed prices below its carrying value on WBL’s\n                    accounts. 25     Interestingly, an email was sent by one Debra\n                    Soon (who was WBL’s Group General Manager for Corporate Communications and\n                    Investor Relations) (“Debra”) to Swee Hong, stating that\n                    “like that we will need a profit warning”. This email was sent at\n                    8.48am, i.e., during the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting. Swee Hong asked\n                    Debra what was stated in WBL’s last announcement. Debra replied by stating\n                    “That not good la, but we never said going into\n                loss”.",
        "Events subsequent to the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting": "26     On 11 July 2007, M-Flex announced that it\n                    had suffered an unanticipated decline in revenue for Q3 FY07 and was expected to\n                    record a net loss in that quarter. This announcement was made available by WBL\n                    on the SGX website. On 17 July 2007, MFS also issued an announcement on the\n                    SGX website to warn that it was expecting a net loss of between $2.5m and $3m in\n                    Q3 FY07. After trading hours on 17 July 2007, WBL issued a profit warning.\n                    It referred to the announcements released by MFS and M-Flex and stated that\n                    “further to the said announcements and the continual loss suffered by\n                    [WPT]”, the Group would be reporting a loss for Q3 FY07. 27     On 2 August 2007, M-Flex announced a net\n                    loss of US$6.7m. On 14 August 2007, WBL announced that it suffered an\n                    attributable loss of $27.3m for Q3 FY07, which included an impairment charge on\n                    WPT costing $26.6m.",
        "The sale of WBL shares by Lew": "28     The records from SGX showed that Lew had, on\n                    2 July 2007 at 2.24 pm, made a bid to sell 17,000 WBL shares at $5.05 per\n                    share. However, his bid was not matched. Subsequently, at about 8.34am on\n                    4 July 2007, Lew submitted three bids to sell a total of 27,000 WBL shares\n                    at $5.05 to $5.10 per share. The records suggested that the three bids were made\n                    at 8.34am within a span of two seconds, but none were matched with buyers. Lau\n                    Kin Hin Leslie, the Assistant Information Technology Manager for AmFraser, gave\n                    evidence that Lew had placed those bids through his Internet trading account\n                    with AmFraser and testified that the users’ brokers did not know the\n                    password and username for trading on the AmFraser’s Internet trading\n                    platform on their clients’ behalf. Lew did not dispute the veracity of\n                    AmFraser’s records. However, he claimed that he had given the order to\n                    sell those 27,000 shares only after lunchtime on 4 July 2007, and that\n                    the order was made through his broker. During cross-examination, Lew said that\n                    he could not recall making those three bids and suggested that it was not\n                    possible for him to trade at 8.34am on 4 July 2007 as he was then on the\n                    move in China. I do not accept Lew’s evidence. MAS provided documentary\n                    evidence (which Lew accepted) to show that Lew had put in bids to sellpersonallyon the morning of 4 July 2007. His\n                    excuse, that he was on the move in China, was uncorroborated. In my view, the\n                    fact that the three bids (from the SGX’s records) appeared to be made\n                    within a span of two or three seconds was inconclusive as to the veracity of\n                    Lew’s account. Given that the information was downloaded from SGX, the\n                    time captured on SGX’s record would reflect the time that the bids werereceivedby SGX and not the time that the bids\n                    weresentby Lew from China. In my view, on the\n                    totality of the evidence, it was more likely than not that Lew had made those\n                    bids through his internet trading account on the morning of\n                    4 July 2007. 29     At 2.36pm, Lew put in a bid to sell 30,000 WBL\n                    shares at $4.98 (which was the last transacted price) and his bids were matched.\n                    At 3.52 pm, he put in another bid to sell 30,000 shares at $4.98 (also the last\n                    transacted price) and his bids were matched within three minutes. At 3.56pm, Lew\n                    put in a third bid to sell 30,000 shares at $4.98 (the last transacted price),\n                    and his bid was matched almost instantly. All the bids were made through\n                    Lew’s broker with AmFraser. In total, Lew sold 90,000 shares at $4.98,\n                    raising $448,200.",
        "Lew’s resignation from WBL": "30     On 5 July 2007, Lew wrote to,inter alios, Swee Hong to inform her about the sale of\n                    his WBL shares on the previous day. Swee Hong responded on 9 July 2007\n                    stating that, in her view, he possessed price-sensitive information made known\n                    at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting and that his actions might be construed as\n                    insider trading. Lew’s response was: I sold my shares to raise cash to exercise my WBL options, which forms you\n                        would have received today. I did not think that the matters discussed at the GMC on 2 July were\n                        price-sensitive information, which is why I sold the shares. Had I thought\n                        otherwise, I definitely would not have done anything because I am fully\n                        aware of insider trading rules. The GMC Meeting on 2 July was an update of the 3Q forecast which can\n                        and do change, as you have seen in previous GMC meetings when such forecasts\n                        were presented, sometimes quite substantially, when the actual results are\n                        submitted or at the next update. Moreover, the forecast of the two FPC\n                        subsidiaries, which forms the bulk of the Group results, were not updated at\n                        the meeting. Additionally, there may be non-operational events which may or\n                        may not have been discussed at the meeting. Besides, as explained above, I\n                        sold the shares so that I can exercise my options for more shares. However, it is interesting that you view what was discussed at the GMC as\n                        sufficiently price-sensitive to send me this caution note, which I greatly\n                        appreciate. You know that the last thing I want to do is to be in breach of\n                        the regulations. If you consider my explanations as not sufficient justification of the\n                        sale and advise that I should not have carried out that trade, I will\n                        promptly buy back those shares at no less than the price that I sold them\n                        for. Your advise is greatly appreciated. 31     Swee Hong’s response the following day\n                    (on 10 July 2007) was that Lew had sought her advice on the afternoon of\n                    2 July 2007 (i.e., after the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting), and that her\n                    advice was that: it would be prudent not to deal in WBL shares in view of the information\n                        (which was and is still not generally available to the public) shared at the\n                        GMC meeting that morning. Nevertheless, it would definitely not be in order to purchase the same\n                        number of shares (which you have sold) back from the market\n                        presently. 32     In Lew’s response, he acknowledged\n                    having “a casual conversation after the [GMC Meeting] on whether the\n                    matters discussed at the meeting [were] price-sensitive information”.\n                    However, Lew denied that he had sought Swee Hong’s advice on whether he\n                    could sell the WBL shares. He claimed that at that point of time, it did not\n                    occur to him that he would be doing so. He ended by observing that they had a\n                    different view on whether the information was price-sensitive. Swee Hong\n                    subsequently reiterated that she had advised Lew on 2 July 2007 that it\n                    would not be “prudent” to deal with his WBL shares in the light of\n                    the information shared at the GMC Meeting that morning. 33     CS Tan’s evidence was that on\n                    10 July 2007, Swee Hong told him about Lew’s trade in WBL shares,\n                    and, that she (Swee Hong) had previously told Lew that the information discussed\n                    at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting was price-sensitive. WBL’s solicitors\n                    were called to conduct an inquiry, the outcome of which is privileged. On\n                    17 July 2007, WBL filed a Suspicious Transaction Report in respect of\n                    Lew’s trade. On 19 July 2007, Lew resigned from WBL with immediate\n                    effect.",
        "Issues before the Court": "34     The claim of MAS against Lew is based on\n                    s 218 of the SFA, the relevant provisions of which are as follows: Prohibited conduct by connected person in possession of\n                            inside information 218. —(1) Subject to this Division, where\n                        — (a) a person who is connected to a corporation possesses information\n                            concerning that corporation that is not generally available but, if the\n                            information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect\n                            it to have a material effect on the price or value of securities of that\n                            corporation; and (b) the connected person knows or ought reasonably to\n                            know that — (i) the information is not generally available; and (ii) if it were generally available, it might have a material\n                                effect on the price or value of those securities of that\n                                corporation, subsections (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) shall apply. (2) The connected person must not (whether as principal or\n                        agent) — (a) subscribe for, purchase or sell, or enter into an agreement to\n                            subscribe for, purchase or sell, any such securities referred to in\n                            subsection (1) or (1A), as the case may be; or … (4) In any proceedings for a contravention of subsection (2)\n                        or (3) against a person connected to a corporation referred to in subsection\n                        (1), where the prosecution or plaintiff proves that the connected person was\n                        at the material time — (a) in possession of information concerning the corporation to which\n                            he was connected; and (b) the information was not generally available, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the\n                        connected person knew at the material time that — (i) the information was not generally available; and (ii) if the information were generally available, it might have a\n                            material effect on the price or value of securities of that\n                            corporation. (5) In this Division — (a) “connected person” means a person referred to in\n                            subsection (1) or (1A) who is connected to a corporation; and (b) a person is connected to a corporation if\n                            — (i) he is an officer of that corporation or of a related\n                                corporation; … (6) In subsection (5), “officer”, in relation\n                        to a corporation, includes — (a) a director, secretary or employee of the corporation;\n                            … 35     As such, under s 218(1) of the SFA, a\n                    person must not sell any shares of the company if: (a)     he is a “person connected to\n                        a corporation”; (b)     he possesses information concerning that\n                        corporation; (c)     that information is not generally available; (d)     a reasonable person would, if that information\n                        were generally available, expect it to have a material effect on the price\n                        of the securities of that corporation; (e)     the connected person knows, or ought reasonably to know,\n                        that the information is not available; (f)     the connected person knows, or ought reasonably to know,\n                        that if it the information were generally available, it might have a\n                        material effect on the price of the securities of that\n                    corporation. Conditions (e) and (f) are presumed, until the\n                    contrary is proven, if MAS can prove conditions (a), (b) and (c) to the\n                    satisfaction of this court (see s 218(4) of the SFA). 36     It cannot be disputed that Lew is a\n                    “connected person” within the meaning of s 218(5) of the SFA.\n                    Neither is it in doubt that Lew possessed information at the material time. The\n                    issues for this court’s determination are as follows: (a)     what was the\n                        “information” Lew possessed at the material\n                    time? (b)     was the\n                        information generally available? (c)     did the information have a material effect on the price\n                        of WBL shares? (d)     did Lew know or ought reasonably to know, that the information was not\n                        generally available? (e)     did Lew know, or ought reasonably to know, that the information might\n                        have a material effect on the price of WBL shares? 37     The key witnesses for MAS were CS Tan, Wong\n                    and Swee Hong. In addition, Christopher Chong (“Chong”) was its\n                    expert witness. Apart from himself, Lew called two other witnesses namely Soh\n                    and R, who was his expert witness. 38     At this juncture, it would be useful for me to\n                    make some observations about the evidence that was given. From my observation, I\n                    found the key witnesses of MAS to be truthful and honest – there was no\n                    reason for me to reject their evidence, especially since they were corroborative\n                    on many points. On the other hand, I was not impressed with Lew’s\n                    testimony. Lew had, on a number of occasions, been untruthful (see, for\n                    instance,[19]above). I should also point\n                    out that while R was Lew’s expert witness, Lew did not rely on R’s\n                    testimony at all in his closing submissions.",
        "What was the Information Lew possessed at the material\n                time?": "39     Under s 214 of the SFA,\n                    “information” is defined asincluding: (a) matters of supposition and other matters that are insufficiently\n                        definite to warrant being made known to the public; (b) matters relating to the intentions, or the likely intentions, of a\n                        person; (c) matters relating to negotiations or proposals with\n                        respect to — (i) commercial dealings; (ii) dealing in securities; or (iii) trading in futures contract; (d) information relating to the financial performance of a corporation or\n                        business trust, or otherwise; (e) information that a person proposes to enter into, or had previously\n                        entered into one or more transactions or agreements in relation to\n                        securities or has prepared or proposes to issue a statement relating to such\n                        securities; and (f) matters relating to the future. 40     MAS asserted that Lew possessed the following\n                    information on 4 July 2007: (a)     As of 2 July 2007, WBL had\n                        forecasted a loss for Q3, FY 2007 at $2.3m (excluding MFS and M-Flex’s\n                        performance) or $0.4m (including MFS and M-Flex’s performance), which\n                        were based on WBL’s most updated internal forecasts and discussions\n                        held during the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting; (b)     WBL needed to take afullimpairment for WPT in Q3, FY 2007 from the 2 July\n                        2007 GMC Meeting, and that the quantum of the impairment would be a\n                        significant one; and (c)     As a result of the first two pieces of information, Lew knew that WBL\n                        would incur a substantial loss for Q3, FY 2007. 41     A reading of Lew’s closing submissions\n                    revealed that he implicitly disagreed with the assertion of MAS that he\n                    possessed the information, especially in relation to the quality of the\n                    information. Lew argued that the information he received at the 2 July 2007\n                    GMC Meeting was indefinite and unreliable. While these arguments were raised in\n                    respect of subsequent issues (viz, materiality and\n                    his subjective knowledge), it would be more convenient to deal with them here.\n                    Making clear the type of information possessed by Lew with regards to,inter alia, its quality and nature, will avoid the risk\n                    of conflating separate issues in the subsequent analysis. 42     As mentioned earlier, the case against Lew was\n                    that he possessed information in the form of aforecastmade known at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting, that\n                    WBL would make a loss of $2.3m (excluding the performance of MFS and M-Flex) or\n                    a loss of $0.4m (including the two companies’ forecasted performance). Lew\n                    did not dispute that such a forecast was provided at the meeting. Therefore, Lew\n                    possessed the information that WBL hadforecastedthe loss as described above (at [40(a)]). 43     Lew also did not deny that discussions on\n                    impairment were held during the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting. However, he did\n                    not accept that it was decided, at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting, that a full\n                    impairment would berecognised, and that the\n                    quantum of impairment wassignificant. Lew’s\n                    arguments and evidence were that: (a)     If WBL had decided to take a full\n                        impairment on WPT at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting, it would have\n                        discussed issuing a profit warning at that meeting and would not have waited\n                        until 17 July 2007 to do so. (b)     The minutes for the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting\n                        suggested that the deadline for taking the impairment had been extended to\n                        31 July 2007 (see above at[23]). (c)     No mention of any impairment was made in the profit warning issued or\n                        the suspicious transaction report made by Swee Hong. Similarly, in an e-mail\n                        sent by CS Tan to WBL’s Board of Directors on 12 July 2007, CS\n                        Tan said that “WBL may have to issue our own warning together with\n                        the impairment thatmayhappen in\n                        [WPT]” [emphasis added], suggesting that no such actual decision had\n                        been made. (d)     WBL’s management kept pushing back the deadline to recognise the\n                        impairment as it was reluctant to do so. There was no indication that the\n                        deadline given at the 8 May 2007 AC Meeting was a fixed deadline. For\n                        example, following from the 9 February 2007 AC Meeting, an impairment should\n                        have been taken but was not recognised even when WPT’s losses for Q2\n                        FY07 of $5.3m exceeded the limit of $3.1m decided at that meeting (see above\n                        at[18]). New assumptions were\n                        constantly introduced. At the 8 May 2007 AC Meeting, it was discussed\n                        that WPT could get JVC as a new key customer, and that they were negotiating\n                        with other buyers for WPT. As a result, as of 2 July 2007, Lew could\n                        not conclude that all these alternatives were dead as there were no updates,\n                        and decisions might have been made offline. (e)     There was no requisite quorum for the\n                        2 July 2007 GMC Meeting as Dr Lim and Jane Lim, who were both\n                        involved with WPT, were absent. Lew also knew that Wong, Dr Lim and\n                        Jane Lim would be visiting Thailand after the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting\n                        for further discussions with potential buyers, and therefore, no decision to\n                        impair could have been made at that meeting. 44     The common testimony of CS Tan, Wong and Swee\n                    Hong was that at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting, it was clear that the\n                    impairment had to be recognised. From CS Tan’ perspective, it was because\n                    WPT had failed to satisfy the condition imposed by the AC during the 8 May\n                    2007 AC Meeting (viz, to secure a contract with\n                    JVC) (see above at[20]-[21]). From Wong’s and Swee Hong’s\n                    perspective, the fact that no mention of any JVC deal was made at the\n                    2 July 2007 GMC Meeting meant that no such deal had been reached. As a\n                    result, the impairment had to be recognised as the condition imposed at the\n                    8 May 2007 AC Meeting was not satisfied. This would be so even if a sale of\n                    WPT (or its assets) materialised as it was unlikely that the selling price would\n                    be above WPT’s carrying value on WBL’s accounts. In any case,\n                    Wong’s evidence was that the chances of a sale were slim. However, Wong\n                    admitted that the AC subsequently had to agree to the impairment and that there\n                    was a possibility that the update to the AC would be different if a sale or new\n                    deal with a customer had materialised. 45     I accept that there were apparent\n                    inconsistencies between the evidence of Wong and Swee Hong on the one hand and\n                    CS Tan’s evidence on the other. The former two suggested that the decision\n                    to impair was madeduringthe meeting, while the\n                    latter suggested that the decision was madebeforethe meeting as the condition had not been satisfied. In my view, this apparent\n                    inconsistency arose due to the different perspectives taken by them, and it was\n                    not indicative of any confusion or uncertainty as Lew contended. CS Tan, as CEO,\n                    had personally promised the AC that an impairment would be recognised if WPT did\n                    not secure a new customer by 30 June 2007. From his perspective, since WPT did\n                    not secure a new customer, the decision to impair was set in stone. However,\n                    from the perspective of the other two, they might not have the same information\n                    as CS Tan. Until the GMC Meeting took place, they were unable to assume\n                    that the impairment would take place. 46     In my view, the important feature of the\n                    evidence of CS Tan, Wong and Swee Hong was that any attendee of the 2 July\n                    2007 GMC Meeting would know that the decision to impair was almost a certainty.\n                    I accept that the decision to impair was subject to the AC’s subsequent\n                    approval, but given the known implausibility that there would be any buyers for\n                    WPT and that an impairment would have to be recognised regardless, I cannot\n                    accept Lew’s evidence that he did not know that an impairment was very\n                    likely to materialise. On the contrary, Lew accepted during cross-examination,\n                    that he had heard CS Tan say words to the effect that WBL would take a full\n                    impairment in Q3 FY07, corroborating the evidence of CS Tan, Wong and Swee Hong.\n                    I therefore find that Lew possessed information that WBL was very likely to\n                    recognise an impairment in Q3 FY07. 47     In my view, the other points raised by Lew do\n                    not detract from the fact that he possessed information relating to the\n                    impairment. The fact that no profit warning was issued until a much later date\n                    is not determinative of the issue,viz, whether an\n                    impairment was very likely to materialise, and does not aid his case. The SGX\n                    Listing Manual (“SGX-LM”) does not impose on listed companies anabsoluteduty of immediate disclosure (see\n                    Rule 703(3) of the SGX-LM for exceptions relating to confidential,\n                    insufficiently definite or internal information). In addition, I accept the\n                    explanation of CS Tan that the issuance of a profit warning by WBL was a\n                    sensitive matter which required internal discussions and advice from counsel,\n                    all of which would take time. His evidence was corroborated by Swee Hong. In any\n                    case, Wong and Swee Hong testified that they had (separately) given\n                    consideration on the issue of providing a profit warning on 2 July 2007,\n                    and that Swee Hong had discussed this issue with CS Tan immediately after\n                    he returned from his holiday. While there is no documentation to show that\n                    discussions on the profit warning had taken place before 12 July 2007, the\n                    e-mails exchanged between Debra and Swee Hong during the 2 July GMC Meeting\n                    (see above at[25]) strongly suggests that\n                    the issue of the profit warning would have been raised soon after the meeting.\n                    Debra and Swee Hong, being in charge of WBL’s communications and legal\n                    matters respectively, would have been key personnel involved in the preparation\n                    of a profit warning. The facts therefore lend support to the strong inference\n                    that a profit warning had been discussed soon after the 2 July 2007 GMC\n                    Meeting. As such, I do not think the failure to issue a profit warning\n                    immediately after the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting was indicative of any\n                    uncertainty in the forecasted loss or the taking of the impairment,per se. 48     CS Tan’s statement (as recorded in the\n                    minutes) that he would “like to see an end by\n                        31stJuly and greater sense of urgency”\n                    (see above at[23]), when read on its own,\n                    suggests that the deadline for recognising an impairment had been pushed back.\n                    However, when read in context, that was not the intended meaning. Instead, that\n                    deadline referred to any plans to divest WPT’s plant. Both CS Tan and Wong\n                    testified that those observations referred to the decision on thesizeof the impairment (e.g., whether a sale of WPT or\n                    its assets would materialise), and not the decision to impair itself. Their\n                    explanation was consistent with such an interpretation,viz, that the deadline referred to plans to divest WPT’s\n                    plant and not the impairment. Hence, I do not find that the 31 July\n                    deadline was referable to the decision to recognise an impairment. 49     Lew relied on the 20 November 2006 and the 9\n                    February 2007 AC Meetings to argue that the 30 June 2007 deadline fixed at\n                    the 8 May 2007 AC Meeting was not definite as the management kept pushing\n                    back those deadlines. I have already (at[19]above) rejected Lew’s claims that a definite deadline\n                    had been imposed at the 9 February 2007 AC Meeting. Nothing said at the\n                    20 November 2006 AC Meeting suggested that a definite deadline was imposed.\n                    Therefore, Lew had no basis for asserting that the deadline fixed at the\n                    9 May 2007 AC Meeting was not definite. Lew’s argument, that he\n                    did not know that the JVC deal or deals with other buyers were dead, cannot\n                    stand, particularly since Lew had admitted that CS Tan had said words to the\n                    effect that an impairment had to be taken. 50     The fact that there was no quorum at the\n                    2 July 2007 GMC meeting does not assist Lew’s case. I accept that the\n                    decision to impair was not made at that meeting itself, but in the\n                    circumstances, it was clear to all attendees that it wasvery\n                        likelythat the impairment would be recognised, for the reasons\n                    explained above (at[44]-[49]). 51     As for the suspicious transaction report, Swee\n                    Hong’s explanation was that the impairment had been implicitly referred to\n                    in the suspicious transaction report as “other financial\n                    information” that was involved. In any case, given the strong evidence\n                    that any attendee at the meeting would know that an impairment was almost\n                    certain to be taken, and that Lew had admitted hearing CS Tan mention that an\n                    impairment would be taken, I do not think what was written in the suspicious\n                    transaction report or in CS Tan’s e-mail to WBL’s Board of Directors\n                    can make a difference to the conclusion. I therefore find that Lew possessed\n                    information that WBL was very likely to recognise an impairment on WPT at the\n                    material time. 52     I turn now to consider the information that\n                    Lew possessed on the quantum of the impairment. At the 8 May 2007 AC\n                    Meeting, WBL’s external auditors had informed those present (including\n                    Lew) that WBL’s value-at-risk was at $22.5m and $30.5m (excluding and\n                    including freehold property respectively), and it was suggested that a $30m\n                    write-off was the most predictable outcome (see above at[20]-[21]).\n                    Lew contended that the maximum value at risk could not be $30m, because no\n                    assessment was made as to WPT’s valuation or its value in use. In my view,\n                    it is difficult to appreciate how Lew could contend that the impairment would\n                    not be significant. Even taking into account any possibility of a sale of WPT\n                    (at a distressed price or any other valuation), the evidence strongly suggested\n                    that the impairment would still be a substantial one, even if it may not be at\n                    $30 million. 53     As such, I find that Lew was in possession of\n                    the following information at the material time: (a)     That WBL had forecasted a loss of\n                        loss of $2.3m (excluding MFS and M-Flex’s performance) or a loss of\n                        $0.4m (including MFS and M-Flex’s forecasted performance) for Q3\n                        FY07. (b)     That it\n                        wasvery likelyfor WBL to recognise asignificantimpairment on WPT in Q3\n                        FY07. (c)     As a\n                        result of (a) and (b) above, that it was very likely that WBL would incur a\n                        significant overall loss for Q3 FY07.",
        "Whether the Information was generally available": "",
        "What is “generally available” information?": "54     Under s 215 of the SFA, information is\n                    generally available if: (a) it consists of readily observable matter; (b) without limiting the generality of paragraph (a)\n                        — (i) it has been made known in a manner that would, or would be likely\n                            to, bring it to the attention of persons who commonly invest in\n                            securities of a kind whose price or value might be affected by the\n                            information; and (ii) since it was so made known, a reasonable period for it to be\n                            disseminated among such persons has elapsed; or (c) it consists of deductions, conclusions or inferences made\n                        or drawn from either or both of the following: (i) information referred to in paragraph (a); (ii) information made known as referred to in paragraph (b) (i). 55     I will refer to s 215(a) as the\n                    “readily observable test”, s 215(b) as the\n                    “publishable information test” and s 215(c) as the\n                    “market analysis test”. At this juncture, I should observe that\n                    these definitions are not without difficulty, for reasons which will be\n                    explained in greater detail below. Ironically, the Australian equivalent to\n                    s 215 of the SFA was introduced to provide more certainty on the type of\n                    information that was intended to be caught by the provisions (see Kendall and\n                    Walker,Insider Trading in Australia and New Zealand:\n                        Information that is “generally available”(2006)\n                    24 C&SLJ 343 at 345). The prior Australian position (found in the\n                    Australian Securities Industries Act 1980) did not define what information was\n                    “not generally available”, and this made the previous regime\n                    uncertain and difficult to police (see Lyon and du Plessis,The Law of Insider Trading in Australia(Annandale, N.S.W.: The\n                    Federation Press, 2005) at p 30). 56     The Australia draftsmen of this legislation\n                    meant to provide a fair market for trading securities, vis-à-vis the information\n                    that is available to the investing public. As was noted in its report, Griffith,Fair Shares for All, Insider Trading in\n                        Australia(Australian Government Publishing Service, 1989)\n                    (“Griffith Report”) (at para 3.3.6): [I]t must be emphasised that the basis for regulating insider\n                        trading is the need toguarantee investor confidence in\n                            the integrity of the securities market. Accordingly, the\n                        Committee confirms the principles adopted in 1981 by the Committee of\n                        Inquiry into the Australian Financial System (the Campbell Committee) as a\n                        basis for the prohibition of insider trading: The object of restrictions on insider trading is toensure that the securities market operates freely and fairly, with\n                                all participants having equal access to relevant\n                                information. Investor confidence, and thus the ability of\n                            the market to mobilise savings, depends importantly on theprevention of the improper use of confidential\n                                information. [emphasis added] 57     It should, however, be noted that the Griffith\n                    Report only touched on the requirements of the publishable information test.\n                    With regard to the readily observable test, it was explained in the Explanatory\n                    Memorandum to the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 (the\n                    “Explanatory Memorandum”) that that test was subsequently included\n                    because (at para 327): Concern was expressed that in consequence of the adoption of this\n                        definition in the exposure draft [i.e., the publishable information test],\n                        information directly observable in the public arena would not be regarded as\n                        generally available, as it has not been ‘made known’. It was\n                        considered that a person could be liable for insider trading where he/she\n                        traded in securities on the basis of, for example, an observation that the\n                        body corporate had excess stocks in a yard. This was not the intention of\n                        the provisions. 58     There is, however, considerable uncertainty\n                    regarding the applicability of the readily observable test in Australia. These\n                    difficulties were raised in the decision of the New South Wales Criminal Court\n                    of Appeal inR v Firns[2001] NSWCCA 191\n                        (“Firns”). There, the accused\n                    acted on information obtained from the Papua New Guinea (“PNG”)\n                    Supreme Court which was favourable to a certain company. The information was\n                    made known to him through that company’s solicitors (who had attended the\n                    hearing before the PNG Supreme Court) and he went on to purchase shares in that\n                    company. The issue was whether a judgment issued by the PNG Supreme Court could\n                    be considered “generally available information”. On appeal, it was\n                    held, by a majority, that such information was generally available. Mason P,\n                    delivering the majority’s judgment, recognised that there was a tension\n                    between the Australian equivalent to s 215(b) of the SFA, which reflected\n                    the policy of equality of access to relevant information to ensure fair markets\n                    (the “fairness policy”), and the Australian equivalent to\n                    s 215(a) and s 215(c) of the SFA, which recognised that\n                    “cleverness, swiftness and efficiency” were to be encouraged for\n                    some types of information (the “efficiency policy”) (seeFirnsat [51] and [57]). Given the conflation of\n                    competing policies within the same section, Mason P took the view that the\n                    Australian equivalent of s 215(a) of the SFA had to be read literally to\n                    reflect the efficiency policy. As such, the class of persons by whom the matter\n                    in question was to be regarded as readily observable was not confined to\n                    existing shareholders or persons who traded on the Australian Stock Exchange\n                    (seeFirnsat [70]). On the facts of the case,\n                    Mason P found that the PNG judgment was readily observable as it was available,\n                    understandable and accessible to a significant group of the public,viz, those present and capable of being present in court\n                    in the ordinary course (seeFirnsat\n                [76]). 59     Carruthers AJ, however, dissented from\n                    the majority’s judgment on this point, taking the view that (seeFirnsat [112]-[113]): [T]he words readily observable matter cannot be allowed to operate in a\n                        vacuum. In most cases the question must be asked: to what class of persons\n                        must the information consist of \"readily observable matter\"? ... Mr Game SC for the Crown on this appeal submitted (correctly in my\n                        view) thatthe matter must be readily observable by the\n                            public at large as it is that group of persons who are capable of\n                            trading on the share market in Australia, or in shares of corporations\n                            which are formed or carry on business in Australia. The\n                        public at large in that sense must, at least, include the Australian public,\n                        as the provisions contained in the Corporations Law are clearly designed\n                        principally to protect Australian investors by promoting equal access to\n                        information for investors.For information to be\n                            generally available on the basis that it consists of readily observable\n                            matter, it must, at least, be readily observable by members of the\n                            Australian public. [emphasis added] 60     On the one hand, the insider trading rules\n                    were promulgated with the intent of correcting any unfair informational\n                    asymmetry that may arise in the securities market. On the other hand, the test\n                    of what is “generally available information”, if construed\n                    strictly, would mean that the diligent would be unduly penalised by the wide\n                    scope of insider trading laws. As was recognised by the US Supreme Court inDirks v Securities Exchange Commission463 US 646 (1983) (at p 658-659): Imposing a duty to disclose or abstain solely because a person knowingly\n                        receives material nonpublic information from an insider and trades on it\n                        could havean inhibiting influence on the role of market\n                            analysts, which the SEC itself recognizes is necessary to the\n                            preservation of a healthy market. It is commonplace for\n                        analysts to \"ferret out and analyze information,\" … and this often is\n                        done by meeting with and questioning corporate officers and others who are\n                        insiders. And information that the analysts obtain normally may be the basis\n                        for judgments as to the market worth of a corporation's securities. The\n                        analyst's judgment in this respect is made available in market letters or\n                        otherwise to clients of the firm. It is the nature of this type of\n                        information, and indeed of the markets themselves, that such information\n                        cannot be made simultaneously available to all of the corporation's\n                        stockholders or the public generally. [emphasis added] 61     Locally, s 9A of the Interpretation Act\n                    (Cap 1, 1999 Rev Ed) states that: an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the\n                        written law…shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not\n                        promote that purpose or object. It is however not apparent, whether the legislative purpose of\n                    s 215(a) is such that the policy of fairness should trump the policy of\n                    efficiency. At the second reading of the Securities and Futures\n                        Bill (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official\n                        Report(5 October 2001) vol 73 at col 2136-2137)\n                    (“the Parliamentary Debates”) by BG Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime\n                    Minister (“BG Lee”) it was suggested that the underlying rationale\n                    for implementing the current insider trading rules was to ensure fairness within\n                    the securities market. BG Lee explained (idat\n                    col 2136): At the core, the mischief of insider trading lies in tilting the playing\n                        field unfairly against other market participants. Those who knowingly have\n                        inside information should be prohibited from trading, whether or not they\n                        are connected with the company. The intent is to address the core evil of\n                        trading while in possession of undisclosed market sensitive information,\n                        instead of having liability depend on a person's connection with the\n                        company. 62     However, it has been pointed out that the\n                    policy of efficiency was not far away from the regulator’s minds in\n                    promulgating the current rules (see Lee,“Americanisation” of the Civil Liability Regime for Insider\n                        Trading in Singapore(2005) 23 C&SLJ 396 at\n                    p 397-398). According to MAS’ Insider Trading Consultation Paper,\n                    2001 (the “MAS Consultation Paper”), the current provisions on\n                    insider trading were created to “further enhance the effectiveness of our\n                    insider trading laws” and were part of MAS’ “continuing\n                    efforts to ensure that our markets operatefairly and\n                        efficiently” [emphasis added] (at para 21). It would\n                    therefore appear that both policies of fairness and efficiency were considered\n                    pertinent in passing the relevant provisions in the SFA. In construing the\n                    insider trading provisions, I am mindful of Mason P’s observation (inFirnsat [40]) that: There is lengthy philosophical debate about the object of prohibiting\n                        insider trading. Because of this, care needs to be taken to ensure that a\n                        judge does not unconsciously read his or her own philosophy into the\n                        enactment and then use it as the basis for construing the enactment\n                        consonant with that philosophy. 63     It is not strictly necessary for me to decide\n                    whether the majority or minority decision ofFirns, or even a different formulation therefrom, should be adopted\n                    in Singapore. MAS, in its submissions, did not dispute that the information\n                    which Lew sought to rely on (viz, the press\n                    releases and announcements of companies listed in Singapore or the USA)\n                    satisfies the readily observable test or publishable information test. However,\n                    I take the view that the efficacy of the insider trading regime would be best\n                    maintained by imposing a narrow view of what is “generally available\n                    information”. Lew’s counter-argument was that it would place an\n                    onerous burden on company insiders as they would not be able to trade on their\n                    option shares, which, I recognise, may comprise a not insubstantial portion of\n                    their income (see generally the observations of the US District Court for\n                    Eastern District of Pennsylvania inUnited States of America\n                        v Kevin Heron525 F Supp 2d 72). However, that is not a good\n                    reason for construing “generally available information”\n                    expansively. As was observed by BG Lee (Parliamentary Debates at\n                    col 2157-2158): First, may I explain that whether or not a trade violates the insider\n                        trading rules does not depend on the restriction period. Itdepends on whether or not you have sensitive inside information\n                            at the time of trading. It can be outside the restricted\n                        period. But if you have some information, you know something is going to\n                        happen, you trade on it, you have violated the rule. And when we say it is\n                        information-connected rather than person-connected, we mean that it goes\n                        down the chain - I told you, he told the next person, and so on. It is\n                        information-connected. [Emphasis added] Clearly, therefore, if a company executive is in possession of\n                    sensitive information that is not known to the market, he should not be allowed\n                    to trade in those securities. 64     With regard to the market analysis test, Lew\n                    argued that the words “deduction, conclusion and inference” in\n                    s 215(c) should be given their respective dictionary meanings, with an\n                    “inference” being less certain than a conclusion. As such, under\n                    the market analysis test, the “deductions, conclusions or\n                    inferences” need not be correct, so long as it is not fanciful and was\n                    arrived at with some basis. It would be possible to arrive at different\n                    conclusions, deductions or inferences from the same data, and therefore, the\n                    threshold for such “deductions, conclusions or inferences” was\n                    rationality, not certainty. 65     InR v Hannes[2000] NSWCCA 503 (“Hannes”), a person who called himself “M Booth”\n                    had instructed his brokers to purchase call options in TNT Limited\n                    (“TNT”). The call options were due to expire in two months, had a\n                    strike price of $2, and were purchased at 2 cents a piece. Two weeks later, a\n                    take-over bid for TNT was announced at $2.45 per share, and TNT’s share\n                    price rose to $2.25 as a consequence. “M Booth” made a $2m profit\n                    from his call options. The jury, after considering the evidence, took the view\n                    that H had purchased the options using the false name “M Booth”. H\n                    was an executive director of MCF, a division of a major bank that had advised\n                    TNT at the material time. 66     The prosecution inHannesrelied on the cumulative effects of four separate\n                    elements of the information possessed by H, namely, that (Hannesat [28]): (a)     there was a prospect that TNT would\n                        be the subject of a take-over; (b)     there was a prospect that the offer would be at a price\n                        in excess of $2 per share; (c)     MCF was advising TNT in relation to the possible\n                        take-over; and (d)     TNT securities had been placed on MCF’s embargo\n                list. 67     On appeal, H raised a number of grounds to\n                    challenge his conviction, including the ground that the trial judge had erred in\n                    directing the jury on the type of information which was considered to be\n                    “not generally available” (seeHannesat [103]). On this point, the appellant sought to rely\n                    on,inter alia, contemporaneous brokers’\n                    reports and newspapers articles, which referred to TNT as a take-over target and\n                    valued TNT shares in excess of $2 each. Spigelman CJ first observed that\n                    the reports and articles only related to the first two of the four elements of\n                    information that the Prosecution relied on. He observed, in respect of the third\n                    and fourth elements, that (seeHannesat\n                    [256]): The fact that the company was seeking advice with respect to these matters\n                        and the further fact that that advice was of sufficient significance to\n                        warrant an embargo of this character,was an important\n                            part of the insider information contained in the particulars.\n                        At whatever level of probability the prospect of a take-over at a price\n                        could be seen to exist at any relevant time,these\n                            further factors increase the quality of that information in a manner\n                            which is plainly of significance. [emphasis added] 68     In addition, Spigelman CJ also observed\n                    that the articles and reports relied on by the accused were not of the same\n                    quality as the information in his possession, as follow (seeHannesat [258]): The \"information\" which the jury had to consider was whether or not there\n                        was a \"prospect\" that shares in TNT \"would be the subject of a takeover\" and\n                        whether or not there was a \"prospect\" that an offer \"would be at a price in\n                        excess of $2 per share\". References in the brokers' research were of the\n                        following character: \"TNT as a take-over candidate\" and \"We currently value\n                        TNT at $2.20/share\" (AB4546); \"Takeover Value Estimated At $2.21\" and\n                        \"Takeover Value $2.21\" (AB4689).Such references are of\n                            little, if any, assistance on the issue whether or not the information\n                            in the particulars was \"generally available\". [emphasis\n                        added] 69     Despite the vagaries in those articles and\n                    reports, H argued that the information in his possession could have been deduced\n                    or inferred from information generally available (i.e., the reports and\n                    articles). Spigelman CJ gave short shrift to this argument, explaining\n                    that: 275    No doubt the analyses were \"deductions, conclusions,\n                        and inferences\" from matter that was \"generally available\".However, none of it is of the character of the \"information\"\n                            particularised. It is not about the \"prospect\" that there \"would be\" a\n                            take-over at a price above $2. Nor, obviously, is it about the fact that\n                            TNT had appointed MCF as advisers and MCF had placed TNT shares on an\n                            embargo list. 276    In my opinion, the information specified in the\n                        particularswas not of the same characteras\n                        that contained in the brokers' reports.Those reports\n                            deduced from the objective circumstances of the company the possibility\n                            of a takeover. The brokers' reports also computed, on a variety of\n                            bases, the brokers' valuations, some of which were in excess of\n                            $2. 277    The \"information\" particularised, although it could\n                        have been more felicitously expressed in this respect,has an element of probability which is not present in any of the\n                            brokers' reports. Both of the first sentences as to the\n                        prospect of a take-over and of the price use the word \"would\". The reference to \"prospect\" indicates an element of\n                        indefiniteness. However, an element of \"probability\" rather than mere\n                        \"possibility\" is contained in the word \"would\". This element is emphasised\n                        by the third sentence of the particulars, referring to the involvement of\n                        MCF as an adviser and the embargo list. In my opinion, nothing in the nature\n                        of the \"deductions, conclusions or inferences\" contained in any of the\n                        brokers' reports suggested that it was based on information of the same\n                        character as that contained in the \"information\" as particularised. [emphasis added] 70     Spigelman CJ further explained that (seeHannesat [382]): [T]he stockbroker reports and newspaper articles relied upon were, as I\n                        have said above,of a qualitatively different character\n                            to the matter particularised in the first two sentences of the\n                            particularised \"Information\"which referred to a prospect\n                        that TNT \"would be the subject of a take-over\" and that the offer \"would be\n                        at a price in excess of $2 per share\".This went well\n                            beyond informed analysis of the vulnerability of TNT to a take-over. The\n                            brokers' valuations in excess of $2 per share were of a different\n                            quality to the information particularised which concerned the likely\n                            price of a prospective take-over, rather than a valuation based, as such\n                            valuations must be based, on information of varying and often unknown\n                            reliability, employing a diversity of valuation techniques.\n                        [emphasis added] 71     In short,Hannessupports the proposition that the deduction, conclusion or inference drawn must\n                    be of thesame quality and characteras the\n                    information possessed by the defendant. Otherwise, a person who possesses\n                    information that a merger is about to take place will be able to trade, so long\n                    as there are rumours in the market that the merger may take place. I accept the\n                    submission of MAS thatHannesapplies with equal\n                    force in Singapore. It would make no sense to allow a corporate insider to trade\n                    with impunity simply because (whether fortuitously or otherwise) the same\n                    outcome had been predicted by outsiders with less certainty. The insider\n                    possesses information of an entirely different quality from that relied upon by\n                    an outsider, in the sense that the information available to the insider is more\n                    reliable, and the predictions by the insider are therefore more certain than\n                    that by an outsider. To allow the corporate insider to trade on the basis of\n                    more reliable insider information simply because the same outcome could be\n                    predicted by outsiders with less certainty would be to promote an unequal\n                    playing field. I therefore reject Lew’s contention that rationality to the\n                    exclusion of certainty is the threshold for the market analysis\n                test.",
        "The parties’ arguments": "72     On the facts, Lew relied on various press\n                    releases from WBL, announcements posted on SGX’s or WBL’s websites\n                    and public announcements by MFS, M-Flex or WBL’s major customers (e.g.\n                    Motorola). As I had highlighted earlier (at[63]above), there is no real dispute that such information\n                    satisfies the readily observable test or publishable information\n                test. 73     Lew’s argument was that the forecasted\n                    loss and impairment could have been deduced, concluded or inferred using the\n                    market analysis test, because: (a)     The Q1 FY07 Announcement (see above\n                        at[13]) and Q2 FY07 Announcement (see\n                        above at[14]) showed a declining trend,\n                        suggesting that there was a “real possibility of a continuing decline\n                        in performance”. Since there was no good news during this period, the\n                        generally available information on WBL as on 2 July 2007 was\n                        “pessimistic and cautious”. (b)     WBL’s profit in Q2 FY07, being only 0.32%\n                        of its revenue, was marginal and insignificant in comparison. As such, any\n                        deterioration in performance would easily bring WBL into a loss. Based on Q2\n                        FY07’s results, it was “certainly a real possibility”\n                        that it could be deduced, concluded or inferred that Q3 FY07 would be a\n                        loss. This was especially since those profit and revenue figures were\n                        readily available figures which WBL expressly brought to the public’s\n                        attention. (c)     In\n                        WBL’s forward looking statements in their results announcements for\n                        the past six quarters, the company suggested that its performance could\n                        deteriorate. Despite subsequent drops in profits, WBL maintained that its\n                        results were “in line” with its previous guidance. Considering\n                        WBL’s declining profits and those pessimistic statements, a loss was\n                        therefore more logically probable for Q3 FY07. This was especially since\n                        “companies trumpet good news and are euphemistic about bad\n                        news”. It was reasonable to use the preceding six quarters of\n                        financial information as it was not affected by any impairments and\n                        therefore reflected a fair view of WBL’s operational\n                        performance. In the light of the above, Lew argued that\n                    while the market did not know of the forecast made by WBL’s management, it\n                    was possible to conclude, deduce or infer that WBL would make a loss. It did not\n                    matter if it was the right or only conclusion, so long as it was a reasonable\n                    conclusion. 74     Lew had further argued that the impairment\n                    could have been deduced, concluded or inferred from the generally available\n                    information. In particular, while WPT was not a major part of WBL, its poor\n                    performance had been consistently singled out by WBL’s management. Despite\n                    the management’s assurance given in Q3 FY06 and Q4 FY06 that it would\n                    improve margins, WPT’s results did not show any improvement. WBL’s\n                    press release for Q2 FY07 would have been viewed with even more pessimism as it\n                    was retrenching staff and scaling down on operations without explaining why they\n                    failed to turn WPT around. As such, Lew contended that it was objectively\n                    possible to conclude, deduce or infer that WBL would “have to contemplate\n                    the closing down of the WPT business, sale of WPT or the downsizing and\n                    continuation of WPT and the consequent impairment which may be taken”.\n                    Therefore, the news of the impairment taken by WPT would have been in the\n                    market, in the sense that under the market analysis test such information could\n                    be deduced, concluded or inferred, on 4 July 2007. 75     To summarise, Lew’s argument was that a\n                    person who considered WBL’s results and forward-looking statements for the\n                    past six quarters, would or could reach the deduction, conclusion or inference\n                    that WBL would suffer a loss in the next quarter, and that WBL would take a\n                    sizeable impairment on WPT. 76     MAS’ case was that such information was\n                    not publicly available. Nothing in the results announcements or forward-looking\n                    statements suggested that WBL would make a loss, and no profit warning was given\n                    either. MAS highlighted that the trend analysis could not be relied on as it was\n                    not reliable. MAS also argued that an investor could not possibly know that the\n                    impairment would be taken since it was a one-off event, especially since WBL\n                    announced that WPT had incurred retrenchments costs in Q2 FY07 which suggested\n                    that its operating losses would decrease with time. The circumstantial evidence\n                    also suggested that the deductions, conclusions or inferences relied on by Lew\n                    could not arise.",
        "Was the forecasted loss “generally available\n                information”?": "77     I will now consider Lew’s argument that\n                    the forward-looking statements and results announcements suggested that WBL\n                    would suffer a loss in Q3 FY07, and that it was a real possibility that WBL\n                    would incur a loss then because its profits were already hovering just above\n                    breakeven. Chong’s evidence on this point was that there was no indication\n                    that WBL would suffer a loss in Q3 FY07. While the forward-looking statements\n                    and results announcements were cautious, it did not state that WBL would suffer\n                    a loss. In addition, WBL did not incur a loss in previous quarters even though\n                    the results announcements and forward-looking statements released prior to those\n                    quarters were similarly cautious. No profit warning had been issued by WBL as of\n                    4 July 2007, and investors would therefore not deduce, conclude or infer\n                    that it would be announcing a loss the next quarter. 78     I accept Chong’s evidence on this point.\n                    None of the forward-looking statements or results announcements alluded to the\n                    possibility that WBL was going to suffer a loss in the next quarter, although I\n                    accept that they were fairly described as being pessimistic. In this regard, I\n                    find it significant that no profit warning was issued. Chong, who is also a\n                    director of several companies, gave unchallenged evidence that it would have\n                    been bad practice from a corporate governance perspective for any company not to\n                    issue a profit warning before announcing a loss. Lew’s expert, R, also\n                    agreed that a reasonable investor could not reasonably have expected a loss at\n                    the end of Q2 FY07, based on the forward-looking statements and results\n                    announcements. That would militate against any conclusion, deduction or\n                    inference that WBL was likely to suffer a loss. 79     Another argument of Lew was that if one\n                    considered WBL’s consistently declining but positive PATMI for the past\n                    six quarters, it would be “rational” to conclude, deduce or infer\n                    that a loss would materialise in Q3 FY07. I do not accept this argument. Insofar\n                    as the regression analysis is used to show that it waspossiblefor a person to deduce a loss in Q3 FY07, it does not\n                    assist Lew’s case. This is so because the conclusions drawn by Lew based\n                    on the information he possessed would have been of far greater certainty than\n                    the conclusions drawn from a regression analysis based merely on six data\n                    points. In other words, because of the difference in the quality of information\n                    (the information Lew had as compared with the six data points available to the\n                    public) Lew could be more certain of his conclusions than an investor who relied\n                    on the regression analysis (see in this regard[71]above). Insofar as this regression analysis is used to show\n                    that there was thesamedegree of probability that\n                    a loss would be incurred by WBL in Q3 FY07, I reject the argument. In addition\n                    to the point made earlier that Lew could be more certain of his conclusions than\n                    an investor who relied on the regression analysis to draw his conclusions\n                    because of the difference in the quality of information on which the conclusions\n                    were drawn, the regression analysis was also deficient as an analytical tool. As\n                    Chong had pointed out, taken to its logical extreme, the invocation of the\n                    regression analysis would lead one to the conclusion that WBL would never make a\n                    profit from Q2 FY07 onwards. Furthermore, the accuracy of Lew’s simple\n                    regression analysis is also questionable. There were only six data points and\n                    such an analysis assumed, very questionably, in my view, that the variables were\n                    homoscedastic, i.e. that there was a constant variance. Lew conceded that it was\n                    “anybody’s guess” what the results for Q3 FY07 would be\n                    based on the regression analysis. R, during cross-examination, found it\n                    “naïve” to think that an investor would apply a linear regression\n                    to predict the future, in the first place. 80     I conclude that a forecast based on the\n                    regression analysis could not be of the same quality as a forecast made by Lew\n                    based on the information he possessed, which rested,inter\n                        alia, on figures for two months of actual results. This argument\n                    did not support Lew’s position that the information he possessed was\n                    generally available. For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the forecasted loss\n                    was not generally available information.",
        "Whether the taking of an impairment was “generally available\n                information”": "81     WPT was consistently singled out by WBL in its\n                    announcements despite its relative small size. WBL’s management gave\n                    repeated assurances that things would improve at WPT but it never did. WBL also\n                    announced that it was retrenching staff and scaling back on operations in WPT.\n                    In addition, WPT’s losses for the first half of FY07 were as bad as its\n                    loss for the whole of FY06. Based on these bits of information, Lew argued that\n                    it could be deduced, concluded or inferred that the impairment would be taken,\n                    as WPT was doing very badly despite the management’s attempts to turn it\n                    around. Again, the deduction, conclusion and inference he sought to draw is\n                    clearly of a different quality. This form of inference is, at best,speculative. This is in contrast to the information Lew\n                    possessed, that it wasvery likelythat asignificantimpairment would be recognised. On\n                    this ground alone, Lew’s contention that information on the impairment was\n                    generally available would fail, since it is clearly of disparate quality. As MAS\n                    rightly pointed out, the public would also not possess various particularised\n                    aspects of the information Lew possessed, for example, that the decision to\n                    impair came from the CEO or that WPT had recorded losses that were worse than\n                    expected. Lew and R both agreed that the quantum of the impairment could not be\n                    deduced by the investing public, again, lending support to the finding that the\n                    information possessed by Lew and the inference he sought to draw were of\n                    disparate quality. 82     It is difficult to see how it can be argued\n                    that the information which Lew possessed, that WBL would very likely incur asignificantloss in Q3 FY07, was generally\n                    available. As MAS pointed out, there was no evidence of any report by any\n                    investor or analyst that deduced, inferred or concluded the information that Lew\n                    possessed. I therefore hold that MAS has established that the information Lew\n                    possessed was not generally available.",
        "Did the information have a material effect on the price of WBL\n                shares?": "83     Section 218(1)(a) of the SFA, additionally,\n                    requires the information to be of such a character that: … a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on\n                        the price or value of securities of that corporation… 84     As to what is considered of “material\n                    effect”, s 216 of the SFA sets out that: Material effect on price or value of\n                            securities 216. For the purposes of this Division, a\n                        reasonable person would be taken to expect information to have a material\n                        effect on the price or value of securitiesif the\n                            information would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly\n                            invest in securities in deciding whether or not to subscribe for, buy or\n                            sell the first-mentioned securities. [emphasis added] 85     In other words, the relevant test here is\n                    whether a reasonable person would expect that the information in questionwould, orwould be\n                        likelyto, influence the common investor in deciding whether or\n                    not to buy or sell WBL shares. The following principles can be distilled from\n                    these provisions and the cases: (a)     From the language of the provision,\n                        it is clear that the test is to be objectively applied (see alsoHannesat [287]). (b)     From the language of the provision, it is also\n                        clear that there is no need for there to be an actual impact on\n                        company’s share price in order to establish the element of materiality\n                        (seeThe Law of Insider Trading in Australiaat p 25). (c)     Be that as it may, the court is entitled, in deciding the materiality of\n                        the information, to consider the actual effect on the price of the\n                        securities when the announcement is released. However, the court, in so\n                        assessing the materiality of the information, should remain alive to the\n                        possibility that the quality of the information announced (which may be\n                        couched in absolute terms) may not be the same as that possessed by the\n                        defendant (which may be couched in terms of a high degree of probability)\n                        (seeHannesat [295] and [298] andR v Rivkin[2004] NSWCCA 7\n                            (“Rivkin”) at [195]). As was\n                        observed inHannes v DPP (Cth) (No 2)[2006] NSWCCA 373 at [351]: Further, the probative value of such evidence will undoubtedly vary\n                            from case to case and will depend in part on which element or elements\n                            of the charge the evidence may support. In particular, where the\n                            evidence goes to questions of general availability or materiality, it\n                            must be borne in mind that the jury is invited to speculate as to\n                            whether information has been made known in a manner likely to bring it\n                            to the attention of persons who commonly invest in securities of a\n                            particular kind and whether a reasonable person would be taken to expect\n                            such information to have a material effect on the price or value of the\n                            security.The actual effect of the release of the\n                                information to the marketplace is not necessarily without probative\n                                value in answering those questions. The possibility that other\n                                factors may have affected the market for a particular security at a\n                                particular time must always be borne in mind, but to reject\n                                information as to price movements out of hand on that basis is at\n                                least to risk inviting the jury to speculate, without the assistance\n                                of the only concrete evidence which might be thought to provide some\n                                assistance in undertaking that evaluation. [emphasis added] (d)     The source of the\n                        information is relevant towards the test of materiality and can have a\n                        significant impact on price-sensitivity (seeRivkinat [132], [134] and [232]). 86     It has been suggested that the decisions of\n                    the US courts on the materiality threshold are persuasive in the Australian\n                    context and, by parity of reasoning, in Singapore (see Baxt, Black and Hanrahan,Securities and Financial Services Law(Chatswood, N.S.W.: LexisNexis Butterworths, 7thEd,\n                    2008) at para 18-17). The leading case in the US on the materiality\n                    threshold isTSC Industries Inc v Northway Inc(1976) 426 US 438 (“TSC”), wherein the US Supreme Court\n                    held that information would be considered material if (at\n                    p 448-449): [T]here is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would\n                        consider it important in deciding how to vote. … It does not require\n                        proof of a substantial likelihood that disclosure of the omitted fact would\n                        have caused the reasonable investor to change his vote. What the standard\n                        does contemplate is a showing of a substantial likelihood that, under all\n                        the circumstances, the omitted fact would have assumed actual significance\n                        in the deliberations of the reasonable shareholder.Put\n                            another way, there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure\n                            of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as\n                            having significantly altered the “total mix” of\n                            information made available. [emphasis added] 87     However, this approach appears to have been\n                    criticised by the Court of Appeal of Western Australia inJubilee Mines NL v Riley[2009] WASCA 62, on the ground that (at\n                    [34], per Martin CJ): Section 1001D [in pari materia with s 216 of the SFA] did not require\n                        that the information should have a “material” effect on the\n                        share price. Rather, the effect of the section was to obviate the need to\n                        address the question of whether a reasonable person would be taken to expect\n                        a “material” effect on price to be produced by deeming that\n                        question to be answered in the affirmative if the information would, or\n                        would be likely to, influence persons who commonly invest in the relevant\n                        securities in deciding whether or not to subscribe for, or buy or sell those\n                        securities.Further, the “material effect”\n                            referred to in ss 1001A and 1001D is the effect on price, whereas the\n                            materiality referred to in the case cited by the master is the\n                            materiality of information: TSC Industries Inc v Northway Inc\n                            426 US 438 (1976). [emphasis added] 88     The italicised portion of the judgment, read\n                    in isolation, suggests that the Court of Appeal of Western Australia treated the\n                    US and Australian approach on materiality as being conceptually different, as\n                    the former approach is concerned with the materiality of theinformationitself, while the latter approach is concerned with\n                    materiality in the sense of the effect of the information on the share price.\n                    However, reading the judgment as a whole, it was clear that the Court of Appeal\n                    of Western Australia was criticising the trial judge’s holding that\n                    s 1001D of the Australian Corporations Act required that the\n                    “information should have a “material” effect on the share\n                    price”, conflating the two principles (on the materiality of information\n                    and on materiality in terms of effect on share price) together (at [33]). The\n                    Australian Corporations Act and the SFA both require proof that a reasonable\n                    person wouldexpectthe information in question to\n                    have a material effect on the share price. It does not require proof that the\n                    informationwouldhave a “material”\n                    effect on the share price. An expectation that certain information would have a\n                    material effect on the share price and the actual materialisation of that effect\n                    are different things. In addition, a reasonable person isdeemedtoexpectthat the\n                    information would have a material effect on the share price, if it is shown that\n                    the informationwould, or would be likely to,\n                        influencea common investor in deciding whether or not to buy or\n                    sell the shares of that company. In other words, there is no basis for rejecting\n                    the US approach simply because the test of materiality there is referable to\n                    information, and not share price. In my view, the approach inTSCis persuasive, insofar as it serves as a reminder to the\n                    court that the materiality of the “inside” information is to be\n                    considered in the context of the information that is available in the market,\n                    and how the “inside” information affects or alters the information\n                    that is available in the market when made public. It is noteworthy that the\n                    ruling inTSCwas adopted by the US Supreme Court\n                    inBasic Inc v Levison(1988) 485 US 224\n                    in relation to Rule 10b-5 in the context of insider trading. 89     It is common ground between the parties that\n                    the date for assessing the materiality of the information possessed by Lew is\n                    4 July 2007, the date of Lew’s trade. It would be useful at this\n                    juncture to refer to two Australian cases, where a finding of materiality was\n                    made out in one but not in the other. InAustralian\n                        Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia\n                        Pty Ltd (No 4)[2007] FCA 963, the Federal Court of\n                    Australia found that even if information that Citigroup was acting for a\n                    particular client was generally available, it wouldnothave had a material effect at the time of the alleged\n                    insider trade by the defendant, because the price had, at that point of time,\n                    already reflected a substantial likelihood of a takeover (at [569] and [571]).\n                    InRivkin, the appellant heard from M, the\n                    Executive Chairman of Impulse Airlines (“Impulse”), that there was\n                    a deal for merging Impulse with Qantas, that he could only buy the\n                    accused’s property after ACCC had approved the merger, and that he\n                    believed the ACCC approval would be forthcoming (seeRivkinat [4]-[5]). The appellant then instructed his broker to\n                    purchase shares in Qantas for his company and was charged for insider trading.\n                    The court observed that the appellant’s expert had conceded that\n                    “the fact of the price rise, after the announcement, meant that the\n                    market had not factored in the disappearance of one of the players” (seeRivkinat [196]) and agreed that the\n                    information was, therefore, material. 90     Lew raised a whole host of arguments to assert\n                    that the information he possessed was not material. I will deal with each\n                    argument in turn. 91     In respect of the forecasted loss, Lew argued\n                    that the information was not material on two broad grounds. First, generally,\n                    such forecasts were inherently flawed because: (a)     a number of WBL’s subsidiaries\n                        did not have qualified accountants preparing the figures; (b)     there was a great deal of subjectivity\n                        involved in preparing the forecasts, for example, in determining any\n                        consolidation adjustment; and (c)     Lew’s past experience was that the forecasts were\n                        not a reliable predictor of whether WBL would record a profit or a\n                        loss. 92     Second, Lew claimed that the specific\n                    forecasted information was not definite because it did not incorporate the\n                    forecast figures of M-Flex and MFS even though both were key subsidiaries. The\n                    figures for June 2007 were simply forecasts. The overall forecast was also so\n                    close to break-even point that any such small errors or accounting adjustments\n                    could result in WBL breaking even or recording a profit. This uncertainty was,\n                    in Lew’s view, reflected in the fact that WBL did not announce a profit\n                    warning immediately after the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting. 93     I reject Lew’s arguments. First,\n                    Lew’s submissions assumed that the common investor would know that the\n                    forecasts provided were generally unreliable (assuming that the common investor\n                    was privy to the forecasts). It would not be possible to attribute such\n                    knowledge to the common investor. InRivkin, for\n                    example, the trial judge directed that the jury could take into account (at\n                    [227]): … the fact that persons who commonly invest in securities would be\n                        taken to have the ability to assess the reliability of information, and\n                        information of the kind under consideration here.This\n                            ability would include a knowledge of matters that are generally\n                            available. Such persons would be able to draw inferences from the\n                            Information itself in assessing its\n                        reliability.[emphasis added] One of the appellant’s arguments on appeal was that the\n                    directions did not go far enough to eliminate the precise circumstances in which\n                    the information had been received in considering the materiality of the\n                    information. However, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal took the view\n                    that the directions given were correct and appropriate (seeRivkinat [232]). It is therefore supported, by both logic and\n                    authority, that the common investor cannot possess information that was not\n                    generally available or not inferable from generally available information. In\n                    the present case, the common investor cannot be expected to know about the\n                    unreliability (if true) of the forecasts (assuming the forecasts had been made\n                    public). 94     Second, as of 4 July 2007, the latest\n                    publicly available information that a common investor possessed on WBL’s\n                    financial matters would be its Q2 FY07 results. It is inconceivable that a\n                    forecast by WBL itself that was based, in part, on two months of actual results,\n                    could not influence the common investor’s decision to buy or sell shares.\n                    I agree with Chong’s commonsensical approach that,ceteris paribus, the more recent the information, the greater\n                    weight a common investor would attach to it. 95     In my view, it would be too myopic to say, as\n                    Lew did, that the information was not material because the forecasted loss was\n                    marginal and the $2m drop in profits was small compared to WBL’s size and\n                    performance. WBL was about to record its first loss after six consecutive\n                    quarters of profits. Nothing in the forward-looking statements or results\n                    announcements suggested that a loss was imminent. The fact that no profit\n                    warning had been issued as of 4 July 2007 meant that the common investor\n                    would not likely expect WBL to report a loss for Q3 FY07. Taking all these\n                    factors into consideration, the common investor would not expect a loss to be\n                    forthcoming. Seen in this light, the forecasted loss would, at the least, be\n                    likely to influence the common investor’s decision to buy or sell WBL\n                    shares. One would certainly take a step back to consider if this would be the\n                    start of many more quarters of losses, or was simply an aberration. As such, I\n                    am of the view that the common investor would regard the information possessed\n                    by Lew on the forecasted loss as being material. 96     I turn now to consider the impairment charge.\n                    I have already dealt with Lew’s contention that the impairment was not\n                    certain or definite as of 2 July 2007, and that the value of the\n                    impairment was not known as of 2 July 2007 (see above at[43]-[48]).\n                    One other argument raised by Lew was that the common investor would not react to\n                    the impairment because it was simply an accounting adjustment and/or because of\n                    WBL’s previous impairment in Q4 FY05. I reject this argument. Insofar\n                    as he suggested that there was no informational value to the fact of an\n                    impairment, his assertion is unsubstantiated and may be rejected outright. As\n                    for the reference to WBL’s previous impairment, Lew argued that there was\n                    no real effect on WBL’s performance, and therefore, the common investor\n                    would not be affected by the impairment in July 2007. However, as Chong had\n                    pointed out, there were numerous differences between the circumstances in which\n                    the previous impairment was taken in FY05, and the circumstances in which the\n                    impairment was to be taken in Q3 FY07. In particular, after the previous\n                    impairment in FY05 was announced, WBL’s share price fell by 2.5% in a\n                    rising market, suggesting that news of the impairment was material.\n                    Chong’s evidence was that the common investor would tend to look at an\n                    impairment as “something big”, suggesting that it would have a\n                    material effect on the share price. I agree. Much would depend on the common\n                    investor’s expectations at that point in time – if, for example, the\n                    impairment was smaller than expected by the common investor, the news of such an\n                    impairment would certainly affect the common investor’s decision to invest\n                    or not. Here, considering the quantum of the impairment, I cannot accept that\n                    the information was not material. There was no evidence that the common investor\n                    would have, in deciding whether to buy or sell WBL shares, already factored in a\n                    significant impairment at the material time.",
        "The expert evidence on materiality": "97     I will now turn to consider how WBL’s\n                    share price reacted when the information possessed by Lew was subsequently\n                    released. On this point, the parties were diametrically opposed. MAS contended\n                    that the subsequent price changes in WBL’s share price reflected that the\n                    information possessed was material; Lew disagreed. 98     Given the numbers involved, it would be useful\n                    for me to briefly set out the price changes that took place. It is not disputed\n                    that the three most relevant points of time are 12 July 2007 (the day\n                    M-Flex issued its profit warning), 17 July 2007 (the day MFS and WBL issued\n                    their profit warnings) and 14 August 2007 (the day WBL announced its actual\n                    loss figures and the impairment). 12 July 2007 99     The M-Flex profit warning was released by WBL\n                    at 12.40 pm on 12 July 2007. Coincidentally, WBL went ex-dividend (at 8.5\n                    cents per share) on the same day. The relevant information is as follows: DateCloseVolume11 July\n                                    07$5.00107,00012 July\n                                    07$4.9238,00013 July\n                                    07$4.9248,00016 July\n                                    07$4.9875,000   100    Lew attributed the fall in price on\n                    12 July 2007 to the share going ex-dividend on that date. After that\n                    information had been made known to the public and had affected the share price\n                    accordingly, Lew submitted that it was apparent that there was no significant\n                    change in share price over the next three trading days, suggesting that the\n                    M-Flex announcement had little impact. 101    MAS argued that Lew had taken a flawed\n                    interpretation of the data. First, the fall in share price on 12 July 2007\n                    took place in a rising market. Also, WBL shares started to under perform the\n                    Straits Times Index (“STI”) from 12 July 2007 onwards.\n                    In addition, the opening price on 12 July 2007 was $4.98. The announcement\n                    of the profit warning by M-Flex therefore resulted in the additional losses for\n                    that day. 17 July 2007 102    MFS issued its profit warning before trading\n                    began on 17 July 2007. WBL’s profit warning was issued after trading\n                    closed for the day. The relevant information is as follows: DateCloseVolume17 July\n                                    07$5.0067,00018 July\n                                    07$4.90389,00019 July\n                                    07$5.00204,00020 July\n                                    07$5.00106,000   103    Lew’s argument was that the changes in\n                    WBL’s share price (or the lack thereof) reflected that the market was not\n                    surprised by the information that WBL would record a loss in Q3 FY07. The lack\n                    of reaction over WBL’s profit warning could not be attributed to\n                    M-Flex’s earlier announcement as the results of MFS, the other major\n                    component, were still unknown. Investors would therefore be slow to conclude\n                    that WBL would make a loss just because of M-Flex’s results. 104    MAS argued that the MFS and WBL profit\n                    warnings did not cause any significant impact on WBL’s share price. The\n                    common investor would have, based on the M-Flex profit warning, viewed\n                    WBL’s profit warning as unsurprising. 14 August 2007 105    WBL’s Q3 FY07 results were announced\n                    on 14 August 2007 after the close of trading. The relevant information is\n                    as follows: DateCloseVolume% change% change STI14 August\n                                        07$4.7816,000NA15 August\n                                        07NANA(3.4)16 August\n                                        07$4.6817,000(2.1)(3.7)17 August\n                                        07NANA(0.69)20August\n                                    07NANA6.121 August\n                                        07$4.686,00002.822 August\n                                        07$4.4645,000(3.8)2.923 August\n                                        07$4.4669,00001.5   106    Lew argued that the fall in the share price\n                    on 16 August 2007 was insignificant. The volume traded was minimal and was\n                    not a fair representation of how the common investor reacted. There were no\n                    trades, and therefore, no interest or reaction over the next two days (i.e., 17\n                    and 20 August 2007). This suggested that the information on the impairment\n                    had no influence on the common investor. 107    MAS submitted that the news of the\n                    impairment had a significant impact on the common investor’s\n                    decision-making process. It highlighted that while there was a positive\n                    correlation between WBL’s share price and the STI before 15 August\n                    2007, the positive correlation became a negative correlation after that date.\n                    This was because investors “sharply revised downwards their assessment of\n                    WBL”. MAS also relied on the bid-ask spread for WBL shares over the next\n                    four trading days to establish that there was a significant impact on the share\n                    price. Whether the trades reflected that the information was\n                material 108    I will deal with the M-Flex profit\n                    announcement made on 12 July 2007 first. I accept that there was no perfect\n                    correlation between the size of the dividend given and the drop in WBL’s\n                    share price. I should observe that it may not always be safe to simply rely on\n                    the opening price on the ex-dividend date as the benchmark for the ex-dividend\n                    share price, as evidence on how the share price reacted after the first trade\n                    may be material towards ascertaining the ex-dividend price, especially since it\n                    is accepted that markets do not operate with perfect efficiency. I should,\n                    however, observe that the STI rose by nearly 1% at the opening bell, which would\n                    go a long way towards explaining the first traded ex-dividend price of\n                    $4.98. 109    If that was the case, a six cent (or 1.2%)\n                    drop would be attributable to M-Flex’s profit warning. The STI rose by\n                    0.8% on the same day, suggesting that the news had, approximately, a 2% impact\n                    on WBL’s share price. On 13 July 2007, WBL’s share price\n                    remained unchanged, but the STI rose by 0.8% again. On 16 July 2007,\n                    WBL’s share price rose by 1.2%, with the STI remaining flat. Chong\n                    suggested that WBL’s share underperformed the STI between 12 July\n                    2007 and 16 July 2007. While that may be true in absolute terms, in my\n                    view, it must also be considered that the percentages involved were relatively\n                    small. As such, I take the view that the changes in WBL’s share price\n                    after the M-Flex announcement suggested that the news had some, but not a major\n                    or significant impact, on investors. 110    Both MAS and Lew agreed that the MFS and WBL\n                    profit warnings had no significant impact on the market. Lew attributed this to\n                    the fact that the market was not surprised by WBL’s loss; MAS attributed\n                    this to the fact that the market had already expected WBL to record a loss after\n                    M-Flex’s profit warning. Given my conclusion that the M-Flex profit\n                    warning did not have a significant impact on WBL’s share price, it must\n                    necessarily follow that the profit warnings of MFS and WBL also did not have any\n                    significant impact on WBL’s share price. As such, the market did not\n                    appear to regard the information on the loss to be a significant factor towards\n                    their evaluation of WBL. 111    What was the effect that the news of the\n                    impairment and the actual losses had on the market? In my view, such news was\n                    clearly considered by the market to be material for a number of reasons. I agree\n                    that the information on the bid-ask spread is relevant towards ascertaining the\n                    effect the news had on the market. Lew had suggested that the prevalence of\n                    deleted entries and the small number of bidders involved meant that those\n                    bidders were not serious. I cannot accept that this was the case. Many of the\n                    deleted bids were instantaneously followed by a higher bid, which suggests that\n                    the bidders were slowly trying to close the bid-ask spread. 112    I turn my attention now to look at how the\n                    WBL share price fluctuated after the loss and impairment was announced. For\n                    15 August 2007, there were no takers for the lowest asking price of $4.60\n                    (which represented a 3.8% decline in share price from the previous day); this is\n                    compared with a 3.4% drop in the STI on the same day. The data for\n                    15 August 2007 is inconclusive as no trades were carried out. On\n                    16 August 2007, WBL’s share price outperformed the STI, but I would\n                    observe that the volume traded was low. On 17 August 2007, there were no\n                    takers for WBL shares at $4.68. On 20 August 2007, there were no takers for\n                    WBL shares even at the lowest asking price of $4.70, although the STI saw a gain\n                    of more than six percent that day. The divergence became more stark between 21\n                    and 23 August 2007, when WBL shares changed hands at a falling price\n                    despite a rising market. Chong’s evidence was that no more than three\n                    market days should be used to analyse the impact of the results announcements. I\n                    accept that this should usually be the case, but in this case where the volume\n                    thinned out and there were no trades on two days, I see no reason why the court\n                    cannot take into consideration the trades that took place subsequently,\n                    particularly if they were significant. Here, I find it especially significant\n                    that the STI rose by more than 10% between 20 August 2007 and\n                    22 August 2007 but the price of WBL shares dropped by nearly 4% during the\n                    same period. It is also noteworthy that the significant volumes were registered\n                    only at $4.46, suggesting that that was the price at which the market valued WBL\n                    shares, taking into account the impairment and losses. 113    In my view, given that the investors were\n                    given advance warning of the losses and the quantum of the operating losses for\n                    that quarter was relatively small (at $0.7m), the drop in WBL’s share\n                    price was largely attributable to the news on the taking of the impairment and\n                    its quantum.",
        "Conclusion on whether the information was material.": "114    There is little doubt that the news of the\n                    impairment was material. The market clearly did not expect WBL to recognise the\n                    impairment at that point of time and at that quantum, resulting in a drop in\n                    WBL’s share price after news of the impairment was announced. The\n                    empirical evidence therefore supported the predictive evidence that the fact of\n                    the taking of the impairment and its quantum was material\n                information. 115    As for the loss, the issue is quite finely\n                    balanced. On the one hand, there is strong evidence that the common investor\n                    would not have expected a loss given the absence of statements to that effect in\n                    previous results announcements and forward-looking statements, and the absence\n                    of any profit warning. As for the empirical evidence, I accept that a two\n                    percent drop in WBL’s share price (after factoring in the rise in the STI)\n                    would ordinarily be material. However, I am mindful that this two percent\n                    estimate comes with a large standard deviation. If, for example, there was a\n                    one-bid increase or decrease in “true” ex-dividend price and WBL\n                    had a record of rising and falling less than the STI (i.e., a beta not\n                    equivalent to one), the two percent figure would be affected. In this regard,\n                    the empirical evidence was not as strong as that for the impairment. Be that as\n                    it may, the empirical evidence still shows that the news of the loss had some\n                    effect on the price of WBL’s share. Further, it must be remembered that\n                    the SFA does not require actual proof that there was a material effect on the\n                    price of the share – it simply requires a reasonable person toexpectit to have such effect. As such, taking into\n                    account the predictive effect of the forecasted loss, I take the view that the\n                    information that WBL would record a loss in Q3 FY07 was material.",
        "Did Lew know or ought reasonably to know that the information was not\n                generally available and that if it was generally available, it might have a material\n                effect on the price of WBL shares?": "116    Given that MAS has successfully proven that\n                    Lew was in possession of information concerning WBL that was not generally\n                    available, under s 218(4) of the SFA, it is assumed that Lew knew, at the\n                    material time, that the information was not generally available, and that if\n                    generally available, itmighthave a material\n                    effect on the price or value of WBL shares. 117    Lew’s position was that he did not\n                    know or ought reasonably to have known that the information was not generally\n                    available and that it would have a material effect on the price of WBL shares,\n                    if available, for the following reasons. 118    First, Lew claimed that his past experience\n                    with the forecasts was that they were not a “reliable predictor”\n                    of whether WBL would make a loss or profit. Any small errors, one-off items or\n                    consolidation adjustments could have caused WBL to turn in a profit instead. As\n                    such, Lew did not attach much significance to the forecast given at the\n                    2 July 2007 GMC Meeting, and could only recall that it was a small loss.\n                    Additionally, Lew claimed that it was significant that no profit warning had\n                    been discussed at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting, which in his view, meant\n                    that the forecast provided was just “another volatile\n                    forecast”. 119    With respect to the impairment charge,\n                    Lew’s case was that he did not think it would be detrimental to WBL. WPT\n                    was a small company which had a big impact on WBL’s profits. An impairment\n                    was simply an accounting adjustment and it was not necessarily detrimental as it\n                    did not involve the company’s cash-flow. In the present case, the\n                    impairment would be beneficial to WBL as it would enable WBL to improve its\n                    bottom-line. This was, in fact, the case when post-Q3 FY07 results were\n                    released, with WBL recognising that its increased profits were due (in part) to\n                    the closure of WPT. 120    In addition, Lew highlighted that\n                    WBL’s AC and management had discussed the impairment for the past nine\n                    months. However, no decision was made; instead, the deadline was constantly\n                    pushed back. In addition, it was highlighted to the AC that there were other\n                    potential deals, and Lew (who was not involved in WPT) could not have known that\n                    those options were dead. From Lew’s perspective and experience, those\n                    matters could have been taken “offline” for discussion.\n                    Dr Lim, the person in charge of WPT, was also not present at the meeting,\n                    and Lew knew that Dr Lim and Wong would be going to Thailand for\n                    discussions with potential buyers after the meeting. Further, there was no\n                    requisite quorum for the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting. Additionally, the\n                    impairment charge would not have been $30m, given the value of WPT’s\n                    assets and the need for a valuation report to ascertain the relevant valuations.\n                    There was also no discussion on a profit warning at the 2 July 2007 GMC\n                    Meeting, suggesting that no decision to take the impairment charge had taken\n                    place. 121    As for Swee Hong’s opinion that the\n                    information was price-sensitive, Lew argued that it was for him to make the\n                    relevant judgment call, and that he had acted reasonably in disagreeing with her\n                    view. Lew had, on a number of earlier occasions, sold WBL shares and duly\n                    reported them, expecting WBL to point out to him if there were any problems. In\n                    any case, Lew was more experienced than Swee Hong in areas of finance.\n                    Lew’s open conduct was therefore not indicative of an insider\n                    trader. 122    The response of MAS was straightforward. In\n                    its view, the evidence adduced show that there was no doubt that Lew had traded\n                    with the requisite knowledge, given the sequence of events at the material time,\n                    as well as the answers he (Lew) gave in subsequent interviews with WBL’s\n                    external lawyers and the MAS.",
        "Did Lew know or ought reasonably to know that the information was not\n                generally available?": "123    Lew, in his submissions, did not deny that\n                    he knew that the information he possessed was not generally available. Indeed,\n                    in his interviews with WBL’s counsel (on 12 July 2007) and with the\n                    MAS (on 11 September 2007), Lew agreed that that was the case. I therefore find\n                    that Lew knew that the information was not generally available.",
        "Did Lew know or ought reasonably to know that the information, if\n                generally available, might have a material effect on the price of WBL\n                shares?": "124    In respect of the forecasted losses,\n                    Lew’s submission was (in essence) that such forecasts were unreliable, and\n                    that as a consequence, he did not know (or ought reasonably to have known) that\n                    it might have a material impact on WBL’s share price. Lew also submitted\n                    that an impairment was not necessarily bad news for WBL and that there was no\n                    certainty that a decision to impair had been taken at the 2 July 2007 GMC\n                    Meeting. 125    It is difficult to see how Lew could argue\n                    that he did not know, or ought reasonably to know, that the forecasted lossmighthave a material impact on WBL’s\n                    share price. The threshold for materiality here is pitched at a lower standard\n                    than that in s 218(a), as reflected in the use of the word\n                    “might” here instead of the word “would” in\n                    s 218(a). In my view, it was disingenuous of Lew to contend that he did not\n                    know that the forecasted loss might have a material effect on the price of WBL\n                    shares, for the same reasons as explained above (at[95]). Even if Lew did not know this as a matter of fact, I find\n                    that he ought reasonably to have known that the informationmighthave a material effect on the price of WBL shares. Quite\n                    plainly, the fact that a large company that had turned in six consecutive\n                    quarters of profits was going to suffer an operational lossmighthave a material impact on that company’s share\n                    price. 126    As for the impairment, similarly, I find it\n                    difficult to believe that Lew did not know that it might have a material effect\n                    on the share price of WBL. Lew knew that the impairment would be a significant\n                    one. Given the quantum, it is difficult to see how it would not have had a\n                    material effect on the price of WBL shares. While it may be fairly said that\n                    WPT’s troubles were publicly well-documented, the common investor would\n                    not have known that a conditional deadline to impair had been imposed by the AC,\n                    and that the condition had, in all likelihood, not been satisfied as of the\n                    2 July 2007 GMC Meeting (and after the deadline imposed). Therefore, while\n                    the common investor may suspect that an impairment would be taken at some point\n                    of time, the news that an impairment would be immediately recognised must surely\n                    have a possible impact on WBL share price. Even if, taking Lew’s case at\n                    its highest and recognising that such an impairment was beneficial to WBL by\n                    enabling it to record profits without being dragged down by WPT, one would then\n                    expect WBL’s share price to rise. 127    I have, for reasons explained earlier,\n                    rejected Lew’s arguments that decisions to impair had previously been made\n                    but not followed through. Lew’s second argument in respect of the\n                    information on the impairment was, therefore unsustainable. Again, for the\n                    reasons stated above (at[44]-[46]), I do not accept Lew’s evidence that\n                    he did not know that no deal had materialised that could save WPT from being\n                    impaired. Significantly, Wong and Swee Hong came out of that meeting with the\n                    clear impression that no such deal had been reached. In my view, Lew ought\n                    reasonably to have reached the same conclusion. Lew was no babe in the woods,\n                    having served in WBL for many years and being a trained\n                accountant. 128    In addition, I would also observe that Swee\n                    Hong’s evidence was that she had told Lew that the information was\n                    price-sensitive after the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting, but before he executed\n                    the trade (see above at[30]-[33]). Lew countered that Swee Hong’s\n                    opinion was immaterial and that he was entitled to exercise his own judgment\n                    call, especially since he was more qualified in areas of finance. MAS pointed\n                    out that the test in s 218(a) includes constructive knowledge, and\n                    therefore, the issue is whether Lew’s opinion that the information was\n                    immaterial was reasonable in the circumstances. I am of the view that it was\n                    not. Lew had information of a better quality than the market. The information\n                    related to significant impairments and a forecasted loss after six quarters of\n                    consecutive profit. The market did not know that the impairment or loss was to\n                    be recorded. Lew therefore ought reasonably to know that the informationmighthave a material effect on the price of\n                    the share. In any case, the burden of proof was on Lew to disprove his knowledge\n                    – he has, quite plainly, failed to discharge his burden. 129    Therefore, I find that Lew knew that the\n                    impairment would materialise, and for the same reasons as given above, that it\n                    might have a material effect on WBL’s share price.",
        "Conclusion": "130    I find that MAS has satisfied, on a balance\n                    of probabilities, the requisite elements to make out the claim for insider\n                    trading under s 218 of the SFA against Lew. MAS is claiming a civil penalty\n                    from Lew under s 232(2) of the SFA, which states: (2) If the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities\n                        that the person has contravened a provision in this Part which resulted in\n                        his gaining a profit or avoiding a loss, the court may make an order against\n                        him for the payment of a civil penalty of a sum — (a) not exceeding 3 times — (i) the amount of the profit that the person gained; or (ii) the amount of the loss that he avoided, as a result of the contravention; or (b) equal to $50,000 if the person is not a corporation, or $100,000\n                            if the person is a corporation, whichever is the greater. 131    The position taken by MAS is that the loss\n                    avoided by Lew was the difference in the price at which he sold his shares\n                    (i.e., $4.98) and the price at which he could have sold his shares if he had\n                    complied with the insider trading provisions. This, MAS submitted, would be\n                    16 August 2007 (i.e., the first day after 14 August 2007 with trades),\n                    where the average price of WBL shares was $4.68. As such, MAS contended that Lew\n                    avoided a loss of $27,000 (30¢ x 90,000). The penalty would therefore range from\n                    $50,000 (see s 232(2)(b)) to $81,000 (three times the loss avoided by Lew).\n                    According to MAS, the highest possible civil penalty (of $81,000) ought to be\n                    imposed in the present case as Lew had deliberately used the information he\n                    obtained while he was a very senior officer in WBL to benefit himself, despite\n                    having received advice to the contrary. MAS also sought costs of the present\n                    action. 132    Lew’s closing submissions did not\n                    address the issue of the civil penalty at all. I will therefore hear the parties\n                    on this issue and also on costs on another date. In that regard, the parties are\n                    to write in to the Registrar to fix a hearing date."
