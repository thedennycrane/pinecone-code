        "The parties": "2 Cip was a male Indonesian national who passed away suddenly at the early age of 40 after commencing this suit.1Foot Note 1×Affidavit of Anna Oei Ai Hoea dated 20 July 2016 (“Oei’s Affidavit”) at paras 4–6 and Exhibit A (p 5).At the time of his death, he was the Vice President Commissioner of PT Charoen Pokphand Indonesia TBK which is part of the Charoen Pokphand Group Indonesia (“the CP Group”).2Foot Note 2×Transcript, 10 April 2017, p 12.The CP Group comprises more than 200 companies, which are primarily in the agriculture business.3Foot Note 3×Transcript, 12 April 2017, p 3.After Cip’s death, Anita, his widow, obtained letters of administration in respect of this suit, and an order to carry on these proceedings as the administratrix of Cip’s estate.4Foot Note 4×Oei’s Affidavit at para 6 and Exhibit A (pp 6–7 and 10); Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) of Anita dated 27 February 2017 (“Anita’s AEIC”) at para 4; Order of Court dated 28 July 2016. 3 The defendant is a Singapore-incorporated company in the business of dealing in luxury yachts.5Foot Note 5×AEIC of Peter John Mison dated 27 February 2017 (“Mison’s AEIC”) at para 3.At the material time, the defendant dealt in yachts produced by Azimut Benetti SpA (“Azimut”), a company incorporated in Italy.",
        "The background to the dispute": "4 In January 2013, Cip and Aina Taslim (“Aina”), the Head of Purchasing (Commercial Division) of the CP Group,6Foot Note 6×AEIC of Aina Taslim dated 27 February 2017 (“Aina’s AEIC”) at para 1.met Peter Mison (“Mison”), a yacht broker for the defendant, and discussed the possibility of Cip purchasing yachts from the defendant. At the material time, Cip was considering the purchase of (at least) one yacht each for use in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia respectively.7Foot Note 7×Mison’s AEIC at para 9. 5 On 10 April 2013, Cip signed a contract to buy an Azimut 62S yacht from the defendant (“the Azimut 62S Contract”).8Foot Note 8×PCB 478–482.However, this contract was cancelled because Cip did not pay the deposit for this yacht.9Foot Note 9×Mison’s AEIC at para 17. 6 On 26 April 2013, Mison met Cip at Cip’s house.10Foot Note 10×Transcript, 13 April 2017, p 17.The parties do not fully agree on what occurred during this meeting (“the 26 April 2013 Meeting”). But it is undisputed that Cip signed the following two documents: (a) A contract to buy an Azimut 64 yacht (hull number 68) (“the Azimut 64 #68”) for €1,916,675.00 (“the Azimut 64 Contract”) from the defendant.11Foot Note 11×PCB 491–495. (b) An invoice (“the Deposit Invoice”) for the sum of €1m (“the €1m Deposit”). The Deposit Invoice states that the €1m sum was a “holding deposit” against two boats: an Azimut 100 Grande yacht (hull number 12) (“the Azimut 100G #12”) and an Azimut 100 Leonardo yacht (hull number 15) (“the Azimut 100L #15”). I shall refer to these two yachts collectively as “the Azimut 100 yachts”. 7 On 29 April 2013, Cip paid a €500,000 deposit, in respect of the Azimut 64 Contract, and the €1m Deposit to the defendant. The defendant issued two receipts dated 29 and 30 April 2013 respectively in relation to these payments.12Foot Note 12×Mison’s AEIC at paras 35 and 79; PCB 497–498. 8 On 30 April 2013, Mison informed Cip that Azimut had sold the Azimut 100G #12 to a Mexican buyer.13Foot Note 13×PCB 81. 9 On 8 May 2013, Cip met Paul Grange (“Grange”), Kenneth Ng (“Ng”) and Giordano Pellacani (“Giordano”) in Hong Kong and viewed an Azimut 100 Leonardo yacht (“the 8 May 2013 Meeting”).14Foot Note 14×Mison’s AEIC at para 11; PCB 127–128.At the material time, Grange was the defendant’s Group Sales Manager who was responsible for sales of Azimut yachts; Ng was the defendant’s Senior Yacht Broker; and Giordano was the Azimut Sales Manager for Asia.15Foot Note 15×Transcript, 19 April 2017, p 4; AEIC of Paul Jonathan Grange dated 27 February 2017 (“Grange’s AEIC”) at paras 1 and 11.The parties dispute what was agreed during this meeting. 10 On 9 May 2013, the defendant paid a sum of €1m to Azimut.16Foot Note 16×PCB 585–588. 11 On 18 June 2013, Cip and the defendant agreed, by an Addendum to the Azimut 64 Contract (“the Addendum”), that Cip would receive the Azimut 64 yacht (hull number 64) (“the Azimut 64 yacht”) instead of the Azimut 64 #68.17Foot Note 17×PCB 500.The parties also agreed to change the specifications of the Azimut yacht; consequently, the purchase price increased to €2,017,470.00. Thereafter, the parties further agreed to refit the interior of the Azimut 64 yacht; the purchase price was therefore increased to €2,047,470.00 (“the Azimut 64 Price”). 12 On or about 31 July 2013, Cip met Mison (“the 31 July 2013 Meeting”). What the parties agreed during this meeting is also disputed. But it is clear that Cip and Mison agreed that half of the €1m Deposit would be applied to the purchase price of the Azimut 64 yacht (“the Compromise Agreement”).18Foot Note 18×PCB 195; PCB 547–549. 13 On 1 August 2013, the defendant issued a revised payment invoice for the Azimut 64 yacht. This reflected the Compromise Agreement: the calculation of the balance payable for the Azimut 64 yacht accounted for half of the €1m Deposit.19Foot Note 19×PCB 503.Thereafter, Cip paid the balance sum and the defendant accordingly issued an invoice on 5 August 2013.20Foot Note 20×PCB 505. 14 On 16 September 2013, the Azimut 64 yacht arrived in Singapore.21Foot Note 21×PCB 272. 15 On 2 October 2013, Cip, Anita, Toh Chee Ping (“Toh”, Cip’s personal assistant),22Foot Note 22×AEIC of Toh Chee Ping dated 27 February 2017 (“Toh’s AEIC”) at para 4.and Ken Pun Tze Chung (“Ken”, Cip’s boat surveyor), met Mison at Raffles Marina to inspect the Azimut 64 yacht (“the 2 October 2013 Meeting”). Additionally, it seems that Lau Man Tung, another of Cip’s assistants, and Andi Sasmita, Cip’s Indonesian boat captain, were present.23Foot Note 23×Transcript, 11 April 2017, pp 135–136; PCB 589–591.Upon viewing the yacht, Cip discovered that the yacht’s two gearbox serial numbers differed from those stated on the warranty certificate (“the First Certificate”).24Foot Note 24×PCB 652–654.Then, an altercation between Cip and Mison ensued. The details of this altercation are disputed. Mison claimed that Cip punched him three times; the plaintiff denied this claim. 16 On 3 March 2014, with Cip’s agreement, the defendant resold the Azimut 64 yacht to a third party for €1,865,510.00 (“the Resale Price” or “the Resale Proceeds”).25Foot Note 25×PCB 515–520. 17 On 15 August 2014, Cip commenced this suit.26Foot Note 26×Writ of summons dated 15 August 2014. 18 On 12 December 2014, the defendant paid €1,666,837.89 to Cip. The defendant avers that this sum represents the balance of the Resale Proceeds after deducting the sums claimed in its first three counterclaims (see [27(a)–27(c)] below).27Foot Note 27×Anita’s AEIC at para 26; Mison’s AEIC at para 83.The plaintiff does not dispute this computation.",
        "The witnesses": "19 The plaintiff called Anita, Toh and Aina as factual witnesses and Mr Sum Chee Keong (“Sum”), a yacht dealer with 45 years of experience,28Foot Note 28×AEIC of Sum Chee Keong dated 27 February 2017 at para 1 and p 6.as an expert witness. 20 The defendant called Mison, Grange, and Paul Whelan (“Whelan”), who was the defendant’s General Manager for Southeast Asia at the material time,29Foot Note 29×AEIC of Paul Thomas Whelan dated 27 February 2017 (Whelan’s AEIC) at para 3.as factual witnesses. The defendant also called Mr Donald Richard Arthur Lamble (“Lamble”), a marine surveyor with more than 40 years’ experience in the shipping and pleasure craft business,30Foot Note 30×AEIC of Donald Richard Arthur Lamble dated 21 February 2017 at para 1 and p 8.as its expert witness.",
        "The parties’ cases": "",
        "The statement of claim": "21 The plaintiff’s case has two prongs. First, in respect of the €1m Deposit, the plaintiff’s case is that the parties made two oral agreements: (a) During the 26 April 2013 Meeting, Cip agreed to pay the €1m Deposit to the defendant as a holding deposit for the Azimut 100 yachts (“the 1st Holding Agreement”). It was an express or implied term of the 1st Holding Agreement that the defendant would return the €1m Deposit to Cip if he did not subsequently contract to purchase a yacht. Since Cip did not agree to buy either of the Azimut 100 yachts, the €1m Deposit was repayable to Cip.31Foot Note 31×Statement of claim (Amendment No 1) at paras 6, 8 and 11–12. (b) Upon making the Compromise Agreement, by which half of the €1m Deposit was applied towards the purchase of the Azimut 64 yacht, the parties also agreed that the defendant would hold the other half of the €1m Deposit (“the €500k Remainder”) while Cip considered buying another yacht (“the 2nd Holding Agreement”). It was an express or implied term of the 2nd Holding Agreement that the defendant would return the €500k Remainder to Cip if he did not subsequently buy another yacht from the defendant. As Cip did not buy another yacht from the defendant, Cip is entitled to recover the €500k Remainder either in accordance with the 2nd Holding Agreement or by way of restitution.32Foot Note 32×Statement of claim (Amendment No 1) at paras 13–16. 22 Secondly, in respect of the Azimut 64 yacht, the plaintiff claims that the defendant repudiated the Azimut 64 Contract by failing to hand over the Azimut 64 yacht and by selling it to a third party. The plaintiff accepted the repudiation. Therefore, there was a total failure of consideration and the plaintiff is entitled to the purchase price of €2,047,470.00 by way of restitution.33Foot Note 33×Statement of claim (Amendment No 1) at paras 22–28. 23 The plaintiff thus claims a total of €2,547,470.00 (comprising the €500k Remainder and the purchase price of the Azimut 64 yacht) by way of restitution, as well as interest and costs from the defendant.34Foot Note 34×Statement of claim (Amendment No 1) at paras 29.However, I note that the defendant has already paid some of the Resale Proceeds to Cip (see [18] above). Therefore, as Anita acknowledged, the maximum sum which I may award to Cip in respect of the Azimut 64 yacht is €380,632.11 (being the difference between the Azimut 64 Price and the quantum of the Resale Proceeds already paid to the plaintiff).35Foot Note 35×Anita’s AEIC at paras 26 and 28.The total maximum sum which the plaintiff may obtain for his entire claim is therefore €880,632.11.",
        "The defence and counterclaim": "24 The defendant avers that, in March 2013, Cip agreed to purchase two yachts: either of the Azimut 100 yachts, and a smaller yacht.36Foot Note 36×Defence and counterclaim (Amendment No 3) at para 5. 25 In respect of the €1m Deposit, the defence is, in gist, that the €1m Deposit was paid as a non-refundable deposit. In particular, the defendant pleads as follows: (a) First, on or about 26 April 2013, Cip agreed to pay the €1m Deposit as earnest monies for Azimut to hold the Azimut 100 yachts off the market for three weeks pending Cip’s viewing and decision to purchase either yacht. There was an express agreement by incorporation of the defendant’s Standard Terms and Conditions (“the T&C”) that the €1m Deposit would be non-refundable, or alternatively an implied term to that effect.37Foot Note 37×Defence and counterclaim (Amendment No 3) at paras 21, 47 and 49–50. (b) Secondly, on or about 8 May 2013, Cip agreed with Grange that the €1m Deposit would be paid to Azimut as a non-refundable deposit to reserve the Azimut 100L #15 and another Azimut 100 Grande yacht (hull number 15) (“the Azimut 100G #15”). Moreover, the plaintiff is estopped from claiming the €500k Remainder as the defendant paid the €1m Deposit to Azimut in reliance on Cip’s representation that he was prepared to pay the €1m Deposit as a non-refundable deposit to Azimut.38Foot Note 38×Defence and counterclaim (Amendment No 3) at paras 28–29 and 55. (c)  Thirdly, on 31 July 2013, when the Compromise Agreement was made, Cip also expressly agreed that the €500k Remainder would be applied towards purchasing another Azimut yacht, which was to be larger than the Azimut 64 yacht (“a Larger Yacht”), before the end of August 2014; and that, if no such purchase was made by the end of August 2014, Azimut would forfeit the €500k Remainder. Alternatively, there was an express agreement by incorporation or an implied term to that effect.39Foot Note 39×Defence and counterclaim (Amendment No 3) at paras 34–35 and 53. 26 In respect of the Azimut 64 yacht, the defendant avers that Cip refused to accept the yacht and to participate in its handover for baseless reasons, and subsequently agreed to the sale of the Azimut 64 yacht to a third party. Further and/or alternatively, the defendant claims that the yacht was sold in accordance with the Azimut 64 Contract; and that Cip repudiated the contract by failing to take possession of the yacht, which repudiation was accepted by the defendant when it sold the yacht.40Foot Note 40×Defence and counterclaim (Amendment No 3) at paras 15–18 and 62–64. 27 The defendant counterclaims for the following (“the counterclaim”):41Foot Note 41×Defence and counterclaim (Amendment No 3) at paras 12–19 and 69–73. (a) Expenses of S$19,619.40 for insurance and maintenance. The defendant avers that Cip did not purchase insurance as was required under the Azimut 64 Contract, which led it to incur costs (“the insurance costs”) in purchasing the same on his behalf. The defendant also claims that Cip’s failure to take possession of the Azimut 64 yacht led it to incur maintenance charges (“the maintenance costs”). (b) Damages of €186,551.00 or to be assessed, for the defendant’s alleged costs in reselling the Azimut 64 yacht (“the resale costs”). (c) Damages of S$69.00, the cost of reimbursing Mison’s medical expenses for injuries which Mison allegedly suffered due to Cip’s alleged attack on him on 2 October 2013 (“the medical costs”). (d) Damages for the plaintiff’s repudiatory breach in failing to complete the purchase of either of the Azimut 100 yachts.",
        "The reply and defence to counterclaim": "28 In reply, the plaintiff denies that there was any agreement between the parties, express or implied, that the €1m Deposit would be paid as a non-refundable holding deposit. The plaintiff further avers that Cip did not agree to buy any yacht from the defendant except for the Azimut 64 yacht.42Foot Note 42×Reply and defence to counterclaim (Amendment No 3) at para 1C. 29 In defence to the counterclaim, the plaintiff denies that it is indebted to the defendant for the sums claimed. In respect of the maintenance costs, the defendant did not hand over the Azimut 64 yacht; in relation to the resale costs, there is no contractual basis for such costs and Cip did not agree to the Resale Price nor was his consent sought to the same. The plaintiff also denies being in repudiatory breach and being liable for the losses arising from the said breach.43Foot Note 43×Reply and defence to counterclaim (Amendment No 3) at paras 2–4 and 5.",
        "The issues": "30 The parties’ cases are joined over three broad issues: (a) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover the €500k Remainder (“the Deposit Issue”); (b) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover the Azimut 64 Price (“the Azimut 64 Issue”); (c) Whether the counterclaim succeeds (“the Counterclaim Issue”). 31 I will deal with these issues in turn.",
        "The Deposit Issue": "32 I first set out the parties’ submissions on this issue.",
        "The plaintiff’s submissions": "33 First, the plaintiff submits that the €1m Deposit was a pre-contractual deposit, and was thusprima facierecoverable if Cip did not enter into a contract to buy either of the Azimut 100 yachts. As Cip did not enter into any such contract, Cip had aprima facieright to recover the €1m Deposit.44Foot Note 44×Plaintiff’s closing submissions at paras 49–55.Furthermore, once Azimut sold the Azimut 100G #12 to another buyer (see [8] above), “the entire basis for the payment … fell away”; Cip was entitled to a return of the €1m Deposit.45Foot Note 45×Plaintiff’s closing submissions at paras 126 and 188; Plaintiff’s reply submissions at paras 6 and 69–74. 34 Secondly, the plaintiff submits that Cip did not agree that the €1m Deposit would be non-refundable during the 26 April, 8 May and 31 July 2013 Meetings, and that no term to that effect should be implied into the contract.46Foot Note 46×Plaintiff’s closing submissions at paras 7b, 146–195; Plaintiff’s reply submissions at paras 11-64. 35 Finally, since the parties made the Compromise Agreement, the plaintiff is entitled to the balance of the €1m Deposit,ie, the €500k Remainder.47Foot Note 47×Plaintiff’s closing submissions at paras 167 and 206.",
        "The defendant’s submissions": "36 First, the defendant submits that, contrary to what Anita claimed during the trial, the parties did not agree that the €1m Deposit would be offset against the purchase price of the Azimut 64 yacht if Cip did not purchase either of the Azimut 100 yachts.48Foot Note 48×Defendant’s closing submissions at paras 76–96.However, as the defendant notes in its reply closing submissions,49Foot Note 49×Defendant’s reply submissions at para 9.the plaintiff has abandoned this claim. I therefore say no more about it. 37 Secondly, the defendant submits that the plaintiff did not plead that the €1m Deposit was a pre-contractual deposit; moreover, in any event, this claim is erroneous. The defendant argues that, on 26 April 2013, Cip agreed to buy either of the Azimut 100 yachts and that the €1m Deposit would be paid as a non-refundable deposit to reserve both of these yachts.50Foot Note 50×Defendant’s closing submissions at paras 97a and 101–113; Defendant’s reply submissions at paras 29–60.In this regard, the defendant submits that the T&C, which provided for the €1m Deposit to be paid as a non-refundable deposit, were incorporated into the parties’ agreement on 26 April 2013. 38 Thirdly, the defendant submits that Cip agreed during the 8 May 2013 Meeting that the defendant should pay the €1m Deposit to Azimut as a non-refundable deposit to reserve the Azimut 100L #15 and the Azimut 100G #15. Moreover, Cip agreed during the 31 July 2013 Meeting that the €500k Remainder would have to be used to purchase a Larger Yacht, failing which it would be forfeited.51Foot Note 51×Defendant’s closing submissions at paras 97b–97c and 119–134. 39 Fourthly, the defendant submits that, alternatively, it was an implied term of the purported agreements that the €500k Deposit was non-refundable.52Foot Note 52×Defendant’s closing submissions at paras 98 and 135–139. 40 Finally, the defendant submits that the €1m Deposit was a reasonable amount for a deposit. Thus, in view of all of the defendant’s submissions, the plaintiff has no basis to recover the €500k Remainder.53Foot Note 53×Defendant’s closing submissions at paras 140–145.",
        "My decision": "99 I deal with each category of costs in turn. The insurance costs 100 As noted at [54] above, the Azimut 64 Contract provides, and I so find, that the T&C are incorporated into the contract. Clause 6.4 of the T&C states: 6.4The Buyer is responsible for ensuring thatadequate insurance for the full value of Craft is in place at all times commencing from the Time of Delivery Ex Works Building Yard. [emphasis added] I note that this clause does not expressly state that if the Buyer does not obtain adequate insurance, the defendant may do so and thereafter recover the costs of the same from the Buyer. However, as the defendant argues,143Foot Note 143×Defendant’s reply submissions at para 153–154.the plaintiff does not dispute that the defendant would be entitled to recover the insurance costs under cl 6.4 if the defendant has proved that such expenses were incurred. I therefore proceed on the basis that cl 6.4 of the T&C entitles the defendant to recover insurance costs if it incurs such costs on the Buyer’s behalf, where the Buyer has failed to obtain adequate insurance for the Craft. 101 I find that the defendant is entitled to recover the insurance costs, which amount to S$7,678.00 for the following reasons: (a) First, I find that Cip did not fulfil his duty under cl 6.4 to ensure that adequate insurance for the Azimut 64 yacht was in place “from the Time of Delivery Ex Works Building Yard”. Toh deposed that Cip paid €8,276.40 for insurance for the yacht from its arrival in Singapore until the Azimut 64 Contract was cancelled.144Foot Note 144×Toh’s AEIC at para 29.However, during cross-examination,145Foot Note 145×Transcript, 11 April 2017, p 133.he admitted that this statement was untrue because, as the relevant insurance policy disclosed,146Foot Note 146×2DCB 430–450.Cip only obtained insurance for the yacht from 22 October 2013 to 21 October 2014. As noted at [14] above, the yacht arrived in Singapore on 16 September 2013. Thus, Cip did not fulfil his duty to ensure that the yacht was insured under cl 6.4 (even though Mison reminded Cip and Toh several times to do so).147Foot Note 147×PCB 224–227 and 257; 3DCB 580–588. (b)  Secondly, the defendant paid S$7,678.00 to purchase insurance for the Azimut 64 yacht from 16 September to 15 December 2013.148Foot Note 148×PCB 506–508.During cross-examination, Toh agreed that the defendant did so because Cip did not confirm that he had obtained the relevant insurance.149Foot Note 149×Transcript, 11 April 2017, p 133.Mison also deposed that he had arranged for the defendant to purchase the necessary insurance on Cip’s behalf.150Foot Note 150×Mison’s AEIC at para 162.Therefore, I find that the defendant incurred the insurance costs on Cip’s behalf. (c) Thirdly, I find that it was reasonable for the defendant to purchase such insurance. It was plainly sensible and prudent for the defendant to obtain insurance for the Azimut 64 yacht from its arrival in Singapore on 16 September 2013, to address the risk of any damage to the yacht that might have jeopardised the Handover. It would be difficult for the plaintiff to argue against the need to insure the yacht upon its arrival in Singapore. (d) Fourthly, I do not accept the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant is not entitled to recover the insurance costs because the Azimut 64 yacht was not handed over.151Foot Note 151×Plaintiff’s closing submissions at para 338.The plaintiff did not identify any contractual basis for this contention; furthermore, I have found that the plaintiff was not entitled to reject the Handover. The maintenance costs 102 Clause 5.7 of the T&C provides as follows: 5.7Where the Buyer fails to take the Craft at the Handover destination when the Craft is ready for Handover for any reason whatsoever … the Seller, may at its sole option: 5.7.1store the Craftuntil Handover is completedand charge the Buyer forall costs and associated costs… of storage …. 5.7.2should the Craft have been stored as per 5.71 for 30 days or moreandupon written notice to the Buyer, sell the Craft through private agreement or at auction at a reasonable price available at the timetaking into account that a quick sale may be necessary and,after deducting all storage and selling expenses, account to the Buyer for any excess over the Purchase Price.The Buyer shall pay to the Seller any shortfall below the Purchase Price. [emphasis added] 103 I find that the defendant is entitled to recover the maintenance costs, which amount to S$11,941.40 for the following reasons: (a)  Clause 5.7.1 is clear. The plaintiff failed to take delivery of the Azimut 64 yacht when it was ready to be handed over, and the defendant was thus entitled to store it and recover the storage and associated costs from the plaintiff. (b) The defendant produced an invoice dated 20 January 2014 for the sum of S$8,985.40, and another dated 13 February 2014 for the sum of S$2,956.00.152Foot Note 152×PCB 512–514.By these invoices, the defendant claimed S$11,941.40 for,inter alia, berthing and water and electricity charges, underwater hull cleaning and boat washing. The plaintiff does not dispute, and I so find, that such charges are reasonable and fall within the scope of the phrase “all costs and associated costs … of storage” in cl 5.7.1 of the T&C. (c) The plaintiff argues that the defendant is not entitled to the maintenance costs because they might have included a profit element; the defendant has not proved that it suffered loss of S$11,941.40.153Foot Note 153×Plaintiff’s closing submissions at para 337.I do not accept this claim. As the defendant submits, it was neither pleaded nor put to the defendant’s witnesses at trial; thus, the defendant had no opportunity to introduce evidence to rebut this claim.154Foot Note 154×Defendant’s reply submissions at paras 160–164.Thus, I find that it is not open to the plaintiff to make this contention in closing submissions and I reject it accordingly. The resale costs 104 The defendant’s claim for the resale costs is premised on cl 5.7.2 of the T&C (see [102] above). The defendant’s case is that it is entitled to recover the resale costs of €186,551.00, as a 10% commission fee derived on the basis of the Resale Price (see [16] above), as “selling expenses”. 105 It is important to set out the defendant’s pleaded claim in respect of the 10% commission fee:155Foot Note 155×Defence and counterclaim (Amendment No 3) at para 71. 71. On 3 March 2014, the Defendant resold [the Azimut 64 yacht] to a third party purchaser at a price of €1,865,510.00.The Defendant incurred time and costs in sourcing for the same. The Defendant reasonably estimates its costs incurred on the basis of the standard broker’s fee of ten percent of the sale price, amounting to€186,551.00. [emphasis added] In other words, the defendant claims a 10% commission fee on the basis that such a fee reasonably reflects its time and costs in sourcing for a purchaser of the Azimut 64 yacht. 106 I find that the defendant is not entitled to recover the resale costs. In short, the defendant has not adduced sufficient and proper proof of the costs that it incurred in arranging a sale of the Azimut 64 yacht. No evidence was adduced,eg, regarding the hours that were spent sourcing for the third party purchaser, or of sale-related expenses such as advertising costs. Rather, the defendant’s position is simply that its standard commission rate is 10% of the sale price and that this is a reasonable estimate of its “selling expenses”. I cannot accept that the defendant is entitled to recover €186,551.00 as resale costs on this basis. (a) First, a “reasonable estimate” of loss is not adequate proof of the same. It was incumbent on the defendant to prove the exact quantum of the selling expenses it incurred. It did not do this. (b) Secondly, in any event, I do not accept that the defendant’s standard commission rate is a reasonable estimate of its selling expenses. A standard commission rate would probably include a profit element. It would not accurately reflect the selling expenses that the defendant incurred in arranging for the particular sale in question. For these reasons, the defendant is not entitled to recover €186,551.00, as a 10% commission fee derived on the basis of the Resale Price, as “selling expenses” under cl 5.7.2 of the T&C. It is undisputed that Cip did not sign the defendant’s standard brokerage listing agreement that provided for such a commission fee to be charged. There is therefore no contractual basis for the defendant’s claim of €186,551.00. I find that the defendant is not entitled to this sum. The medical costs 107 Mison deposed that, on 2 October 2013, Cip punched him three times during an altercation after inspecting the Azimut 64 yacht.156Foot Note 156×Mison’s AEIC at paras 175–185.Thus, he suffered injuries and incurred fees of S$69.00 for medical treatment of the same. The key point in contention in respect of the medical costs is whether Mison was telling the truth in his account of the incident on 2 October 2013. For the following reasons, I find that he was. 108 First, Mison’s account was vivid, detailed and consistent. In two emails dated 3 and 4 October 2013 respectively, he related that Cip had punched him three times;157Foot Note 157×2DCB 275–277.it also appears from a doctor’s note that he told one Dr Kevin Chua (“Dr Chua”), who examined him, that he had been punched three times.158Foot Note 158×3DCB 664–665.The plaintiff noted one inconsistency in his account. The doctor’s note indicates that he told Dr Chua that Cip’s third punch landed on his shoulder; Mison also stated that he was punched in the shoulder in his AEIC. However, in his emails, he described the third punch as landing on his chest, and on his “left pectoral chest muscle”. In my judgment, this is a minor inconsistency which does not detract from the general coherence of Mison’s accounts. 109  Secondly, Anita and Toh deposed that Cip did not punch Mison; rather, he had only “stretched out his arms to try to stop … Mison from walking away …. [and] held his arm to stop him from going”.159Foot Note 159×Anita’s AEIC at para 23; Toh’s AEIC at para 24.However, I preferred Mison’s evidence to Anita’s and Toh’s evidence for the following reasons: (a) I find that Mison was an honest witness. He made several concessions during the trial which were unfavourable to the defendant’s case, including the concession that the €1m Deposit was refundable after Azimut sold the Azimut 100G #12 (see [45] and [56] above). (b) As the defendant noted, Anita’s and Toh’s accounts of how the altercation between Cip and Mison unfolded were identical, word for word.160Foot Note 160×Defendant’s closing submissions at paras 211.When questioned about this, Toh admitted that he had discussed his evidence (on this point) with Anita.161Foot Note 161×Transcript, 11 April 2017, p 58.In light of this concession, I placed less weight on their accounts. 110 Thirdly, I find that Mison’s actions after the altercation are consistent with his account for the following reasons: (a) Mison only visited Dr Chua on 4 October 2013. He testified that he did not seek medical treatment on 3 October 2013 as he had important meetings. In view of the fact that Mison’s injuries were minor, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, I accept Mison’s explanation. (b) Mison testified that he went to the police and considered filing a police report. But he did not do so as he was concerned that he would enrage Cip further and that Cip would harm him or his family.162Foot Note 162×Transcript, 18 April 2017, pp 10–11.I note that Mison mentioned this concern in his emails dated 3 and 4 October 2013.163Foot Note 163×2DCB 275–277.It is plain from those emails that Mison’s explanation in court was not an afterthought, and I accept it accordingly. (c) In his emails dated 3 and 4 October 2013,164Foot Note 164×2DCB 275–277.Mison stated that he did not wish to have any further contact with Cip. However, it is not in dispute that Mison went to Cip’s house in March or April 2014 to visit Cip, Anita and their newborn son. During cross-examination, Mison explained that he did so because Cip had apologised profusely to him.165Foot Note 165×Transcript, 18 April 2017, p 19.The plaintiff urged me to reject this claim on the basis that Mison did not mention such an apology in his AEIC.166Foot Note 166×Plaintiff’s closing submissions at paras 331–332.However, when it was suggested to Anita that Mison came to her house because Cip had apologised to him, Anita said that this was “probably” the case.167Foot Note 167×Transcript, 11 April 2017, p 28.Again, I accept the defendant’s submission that the fact that Mison visited Cip’s house was first raised in Anita’s AEIC.168Foot Note 168×Defendant’s reply submissions at para 181c.Thus, I find that Cip did apologise to Mison. In any case, there is a second possible reason why Mison resumed contact with Cip which, ironically, was suggested to him by Miss Oei,viz, “[it] was good business for [him] and [his] wife”.169Foot Note 169×Transcript, 18 April 2017, p 19.It is undisputed that Mison’s wife sought to leverage off his contact with Cip, by asking Aina for a referral to companies associated with the CP Group in Thailand.170Foot Note 170×Transcript, 18 April 2017, pp 16–18.Therefore, I find that the fact that Mison resumed contact with Cip does not cast doubt on his account of the altercation. 111 Fourthly, in view of the point just made,viz, that it was good business for Mison to be friendly with Cip, I accept the defendant’s submission that Mison had no motive or reason to falsely accuse Cip of punching him.171Foot Note 171×Defendant’s closing submissions at para 212. 112 Fifthly, I accord little weight to the fact that Cip lodged a police report to state his account of the altercation.172Foot Note 172×PCB 589–591.It was common ground that Mison told Cip during the altercation that he was going to the police.173Foot Note 173×Anita’s AEIC at para 24; 2DCB 277.Anita deposed that Cip made the police report “as a precaution”.174Foot Note 174×Anita’s AEIC at para 24. 113 Therefore, I make the following findings: (a) I find that Cip punched Mison three times on 2 October 2013. (b) I find that Cip’s attack caused Mison to suffer light injuries, and to incur S$69.00 in medical fees (as Mison deposed).175Foot Note 175×Mison’s AEIC at para 184. (c) The defendant produced a document which indicated that it had paid Mison S$69.00 in respect of a “Doctor bill after being punched by Chip”.176Foot Note 176×3DCB 666.The plaintiff did not dispute that the defendant reimbursed Mison S$69.00 for his medical expenses, and I so find. I also accept the defendant’s submission that it was obligated to indemnify Mison, its agent, for his medical expenses, which were incurred in the execution of his authority: seeIn reFamatina Development Corporation, Limited[1914] 2 Ch 271 at 282.177Foot Note 177×Defendant’s closing submissions at para 214. 114 Importantly, it is not the plaintiff’s case that, even if Cip caused Mison to incur the medical costs and the defendant reimbursed Mison for the same, there is no legal basis for the defendant to recover the medical costs from the plaintiff. Therefore, in view of all the above reasons, I find that the defendant is entitled to recover the medical costs from the plaintiff. Conclusion 115 In summary, I find that the defendant succeeds in its counterclaims for the insurance, maintenance and medical costs. As the defendant deducted the resale costs from the sum that it paid to the plaintiff (see [18] above), and was not entitled to do so (see [106] above), I find that the defendant is liable to pay €186,551.00 for the same to the plaintiff.",
        "Conclusion": "116 For the reasons set out above, I allow the plaintiff’s claim in part and award the plaintiff a total of €686,551.00 (see [78] and [115] above). 117 I also allow the defendant’s counterclaims for the insurance, maintenance and medical costs. As the defendant subtracted the value of its claims for the former two categories of costs from the Resale Proceeds, I award the defendant S$69.00 in respect of the medical costs. 118 I will hear the parties on interest and costs. Quentin LohJudge Anna Oei Ai Hoea and Deannie Yap (Tan, Oei & Oei LLC) for the plaintiff;Bazul Ashhab, Lionel Chan Cong Yen and Beatrice Yeo (Oon & Bazul LLP) for the defendant.",
        "The Azimut 64 Issue": "",
        "The parties’ submissions": "97 The defendant counterclaims for the insurance costs, the maintenance costs, the resale costs and the medical costs (see [27] above).141Foot Note 141×Defendant’s closing submissions at paras 195–214; Defendant’s reply submissions at paras 153–182.In respect of the first three claims, the defendant’s case is that it is entitled to recover these costs under the terms of the Azimut 64 Contract. In respect of the medical costs, the defendant submits that it is entitled to them because it reimbursed Mison for the same, and Cip caused Mison to sustain these costs by assaulting him. 98 The plaintiff’s response is that the defendant has failed to prove that it is entitled to the damages claimed.142Foot Note 142×Plaintiff’s closing submissions at paras 7d and 314–380; Plaintiff’s reply submissions at paras 101–122.In respect of the insurance costs, the plaintiff avers that Cip had arranged for insurance coverage; with regard to the maintenance and resale costs, the plaintiff argues that the defendant has not proved that it incurred loss. Finally, in respect of the medical costs, the plaintiff submits that the defendant has not proved that Cip assaulted Mison, or that Mison’s alleged injuries were caused by the assault.",
        "The Counterclaim Issue": "96 In its submissions, the defendant does not maintain its counterclaim for damages for the plaintiff’s alleged repudiatory breach in failing to complete a purchase of either of the Azimut 100 yachts (see [27(d)] above).138Foot Note 138×Defendant’s closing submissions at para 3c.This claim was premised on the defendant’s contention that Cip agreed to buy two yachts – either of the Azimut 100 yachts, and a smaller yacht – in March 2013 (see [24] above). I find that there was no such agreement. On 1 April 2013, Mison sent an email to Cip including quotations for several boats, including four 100-foot yachts.139Foot Note 139×1AB 186–187.During cross-examination, Mison accepted that, as of 9 April 2013, there were “four contenders in the 100-footer range”.140Foot Note 140×Transcript, 12 April 2017, p 151.Thus, I find that Cip did not agree in March 2013 to buy either of the Azimut 100 yachts. Accordingly, I dismiss this counterclaim. I now turn to the other counterclaims."
