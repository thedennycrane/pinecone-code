        "(i) Late delivery": "7 There are 2 aspects to the issue of late delivery. Firstly, the\n\nparties had originally agreed on delivery by 30 March 2000, failing which liquidated\n\ndamages would be imposed. The Plaintiffs agree that this deadline was not met and that\n\npursuant to this provision they are liable for the sum of EUR 33,333. However this only\n\ncomprises a small part of the total that the Defendants are claiming under the BG.8 The dispute lies in the second aspect of this matter. The new\n\ndeadline for delivery was 30 April 2000. Should the Plaintiffs fail to achieve this,\n\nliquidated damages at a rate of 2.5% per month (pro rated daily) would be payable. The\n\nDefendants allege that delivery was effected only on 6 May 2001 and that the liquidated\n\ndamages for this amounts to EUR 32,876. The Plaintiffs do not disagree with the\n\narithmetic, but allege that they had complied with the delivery provision by 30 April\n\n2000.9 The Plaintiffs’ case is as follows. The delivery provision in\n\nthe amended contract, clause 10.2(b), reads as follows:\"Subject to this Agreement if the Vessel is not completed by the\n\n  Builder as evidenced by the execution by the parties of the Protocol of Completion on or\n\n  before 29 February 2000 at the Port of Delivery, or the Vessel does not arrive in\n\n  Pointe-a-Pitre on or before 30 April 2000, the Operator shall have the right to rescind\n\n  the sale of the Vessel by notice to the Builder and upon doing so title to the Vessel\n\n  shall revert toand revest in the Builder. The Builder shall pay to the Purchaser as\n\n  liquidated damages an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Basic Purchase Price.\"The Plaintiffs say that the Passion arrived at Point-a-Pitre before 20\n\nApril 2000 and therefore they had satisfied this provision.10 The Defendants contend that delivery was only completed at the\n\nearliest on 6 May. They said that while the Passion may have arrived at Guadeloupe on 23\n\nApril, she was not offloaded from the cargo vessel; instead the Plaintiffs’\n\nsub-contractors began work on the required modifications. The Passion was unloaded on 25\n\nApril and the sub-contractors continued with the modification works. It was not until 5\n\nMay that the Plaintiffs requested the Defendants to sign the Protocol of Completion. The\n\nDefendants refused to sign it on various grounds, some of which are dealt with below. At\n\nthe hearing before me, they were prepared to accept that delivery was made on 6 May as\n\nthey took over the Passion on that date.11 The Plaintiffs point out that the Passion did \"arrive\" at\n\nPointe-a-Pitre before 30 April 2000, even if she was not operational by then. The\n\nDefendants contend that this provision required that she be operational by then. This\n\nquestion is one for the arbitrator to determine but it cannot be said that the\n\nDefendants’ position is untenable. This is because the Plaintiffs’ position,\n\ntaken to the extreme, would mean that so long as all the components of the Passion are at\n\nPointe-a-Pitre, they are not under any obligation to get her to be operational by a\n\nstipulated date. In my view, it cannot be said that the Defendants were unreasonable in\n\nholding the view that because thePlaintiffs only requested them to sign the Protocol of Completion on 5\n\nMay, liquidated damages for late delivery is payable up to that date.",
        "(ii) Failure to attain specified speed": "12 Clause 15.1 of the Agreement provides as follows:\"15 PERFORMANCE15.1Speed(a) The Builder hereby warrants that the continuous speed of the Vessel\n\n    shall be 40 knots at 5816 kw corresponding to 100% of maximum continuous power with a load\n\n    of 41.5 tons, in calm weather, wind and sea not exceeding Beaufort 3 and 2 respectively,\n\n    with clean hull.(b) If the actual continuous speed of the Vessel during sea trials\n\n    varies from the guaranteed value of 40 knots, the Basic Purchase Price shall be adjusted\n\n    as follows –Actual continuous speedReduction inSpeed (knots)Basic Purchase Price\n\n    (percent)up to 39.5 knots0below 39.5 knotsUSD 10,000 per 0.1 knotShould the actual continuous speed as measured on sea trials fall below\n\n37.50 knots the Operator shall have the right to reject the Vessel and terminate this\n\nAgreement.\"13 Sea trials were conducted on 27 and 28 January 2000 at which the\n\nPassion attained a maximum continuous speed of 41.9 knots and an average of 41.35 knots.\n\nThe Plaintiffs argue that the vessel was therefore in conformity with clause 15.1(a) and\n\nthere was no basis for the Defendants’ complaint in this respect.14 The Defendants say that the sea trial was defective in that the\n\nengines of the vessel were overloaded to achieve that speed. In support of this, the\n\nDefendants exhibited a letter from the engine supplier which stated that the engines were\n\noverloaded by about 8.3% to 13.9% during the sea trials and warned that the warranty for\n\nthose engines would be affected unless corrective action was taken in respect of the\n\noverloading problem. By the time the engine supplier sent this letter, the vessel was\n\nalready being transported to Point-a-Pitre. Therefore a further sea trial in Singapore was\n\nimpossible.15 The Defendants engaged a surveyor to conduct sea trials at\n\nGuadeloupe on 26 and 27 June 2000. The surveyor reported a speed of between 37 and 38\n\nknots. Based on an average of 37.5 knots, the Defendants say that the formula in clause\n\n15.1(b) entitles them to make a claim for US$250,000 which is equivalent to approximately\n\nEUR285,000.16 The Plaintiffs allege that this sea trial was not done in their\n\npresence as required under the Agreement. This is not disputed by the Defendants. However\n\nthis does not detract from the fact that there is a claim by the Defendants against the\n\nPlaintiffs in respect of the speed performance of the Passion. It would be necessary for\n\nthe arbitrator determine whether the Plaintiffs have satisfied this provision. Whether\n\nthis is done by a further sea trial or by some other means would be a matter for the\n\narbitrator to decide. For the present, the Defendants have this claim, and so far as they\n\nhave been capable of determining it, the Passion could only reach 37.5 knotsand their claim rested on that basis. I cannot see anything\n\nunreasonable in that position.",
        "(iii) Miscellaneous defects": "17 The Defendants alleged that there were various defects to the\n\nPassion that were not rectified by the time they took over the vessel and that they either\n\nhad repaired or would have to do so. However at the hearing before me the Defendants had\n\nnot provided any quantification of these repair costs. Therefore I would have to disregard\n\nthem in relation to this application.",
        "(iv) Fifth engine": "18 The Passion was designed as a vessel with 4 engines. However the\n\nAgreement, as modified, obliges the Plaintiffs to supply a fifth engine which is to be\n\nused as a spare. This obligation is not denied by the Plaintiffs. Neither do they deny\n\nthat the Passion was supplied without the fifth engine. However the Plaintiffs raised\n\nissues as to whether they were liable to the Defendants for this engine rather than to a\n\nthird party. The Plaintiffs also submit that the BG states that it is for the purposes of\n\nsecuring their obligations pursuant to clauses 10.2(b), 14.7, 15.1 and 19 of the Agreement\n\nand only to those clauses. Therefore even if they were in breach of their obligations to\n\nsupply the fifth engine, this was outside the scope of the BG.19 The Defendants contend that this breach did fall within one of those\n\nprovisions, namely clause 10.2(b) which is set out in paragraph 9 above. This relates to\n\nthe completion or arrival of the \"Vessel\". The Defendants say that the Passion\n\nwas not in conformity with the specifications and therefore did not fall within the\n\ndefinition of \"Vessel\" in the Agreement. That term is defined in clause 1.1 as\n\nmeaning (emphasis added):\"… a 43 metre Catamaran vesselwith all its componentswhich is the subject of this Agreement having the Yard Number H162 allocated to it by the\n\n  Builder to be, or being constructed, awaiting delivery or delivered as the case may\n\n  be.\"Thus, the Defendants argue, if the Passion did not have all its\n\ncomponents, she was not the \"Vessel\" as defined. The term \"components\"\n\nis defined in the same clause as meaning:\"… everything which forms or is intended to form part of the\n\n  Vessel or to be placed in or on the Vessel and, without limiting the generality of the\n\n  foregoing, includes the hull, engines, machinery, appliances, appurtenances, equipment,\n\n  gear, fittings, furniture and stores;\"Since she did not have the fifth engine which is one of the\n\n\"components\" of the \"Vessel\", it would follow that the Passion was not\n\nthe \"Vessel\" as defined in the Agreement. Therefore the Plaintiffs were in\n\nbreach of their delivery obligation under clause 10.2(b).20 Although the Defendants’ argument appears to be a technical\n\none, nevertheless it is not untenable and one which ought to be dealt with by the\n\narbitrator. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the Defendants’ claim in this respect is\n\nperfectly reasonable. It is for a sum of EUR 278,000 and the Plaintiffs do not deny that\n\nthis is the price of an engine.",
        "Unconscionability and fraud": "21 The Defendants’ claims appear to be entirely reasonable. In any\n\nevent, there is clearly no fraud. The only question is whether it is unconscionable for\n\nthem to make the demand. InEltraco International Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd[2000] 4 SLR 290the Court of Appeal stated that in considering unconscionability, the\n\nentire picture must be viewed, taking into account all the relevant factors. In the matter\n\nbefore them the court found that it was not unconscionable for a beneficiary to make a\n\ncall on a demand bond where there was a genuine dispute between the parties on liability.\n\nThe court said at para 32:\"32. At the time the respondents called on the bond\n\n    on 18 February 2000, the appellants had clearly not rectified all the defects listed in\n\n    the November 2000 schedule. The earlier joint inspection of 2 February 2000 is evidence of\n\n    that. Furthermore, the appellants also disputed that they were liable for all the defects.\n\n    Quite clearly, there were genuine disputes between the parties - both as to the extent of\n\n    the defect liability and the cost of the rectification works. In the circumstances, the\n\n    learned judge was entitled to find that as regards both matters, the extent of the defect\n\n    liability and the cost for rectifying the same, were unclear to him. In the light of the\n\n    foregoing, we do not see how the call on the bond by the respondents can be termed to be\n\n    abusive. The respondents are entitled to protect their own interest. In our opinion, there\n\n    is nothing improper on the part of the respondents in calling on the bond. The defendants`\n\n    concern was further aggravated by the fact that there was some evidence then that the\n\n    appellants were in financial difficulties.\"22 In the present case, the BG was issued for the purpose of providing\"security\n\nfor the fulfilment of the obligations\"of the Plaintiffs under the Agreement. It\n\nis an undertaking by the bank to pay upon receipt of the Defendants’ written demand.\n\nIt is an ordinary on-demand bond clearly intended to entitle the Defendants the right to\n\nreceive such sum from the bank as they, in theirbona fideview, determine that the\n\nPlaintiffs are liable to them under the relevant provisions of the Agreement. A demand\n\nmade by the Plaintiffs on the grounds described above would fall within what is\n\ncontemplated in the Agreement. In those circumstances, I cannot see how such a demand\n\nwould be unconscionable as would move the court to continue the injunction. Accordingly I\n\ndischarged it.Material non-disclosure23 The Defendants also point out that the Plaintiffs had, in their\n\napplication for theex parteinjunction, failed to make full and frank disclosure\n\nof all material facts. They submit that the nature of the non-disclosure of itself\n\njustifies discharging the injunction.24 Theex parteapplication was supported by an affidavit filed\n\nby Priscilla Lim, a director of the Plaintiffs. After citing the relevant provisions of\n\nthe Agreement, Lim said in paragraph 9 that:\"9. The Plaintiffs delivered the Vessel to the Port of Final\n\n  Delivery on 23 April 2000. The Defendants, however, wrongfully refused to take delivery of\n\n  the Vessel until 5 May 2000 and wrongfully refused to sign the Protocol of Transit.\"Lim then continued by saying that the Defendants unilaterally declared\n\nthat the Vessel only arrived on 15 May 2000 and claimed liquidated damages on that basis.\n\nNo mention was made of the basis of the Defendants’ claim as I had set out above,\n\ni.e. that the Passion was not unloaded from the carrier vessel until 25 April, that the\n\nPlaintiffs’ sub-contractors were working on her thereafter and that it was not until\n\n5 May that the Plaintiffs requested the Defendants to sign the Protocol of Completion.The impression given by Lim is that the Defendants had absolutely no\n\nbasis for their claim of late delivery and therefore their behaviour was fraudulent.25 The affidavit then turns to the Defendants’ claim in relation\n\nto the speed of the vessel. Lim said that it was made fraudulently because:(i) sea trials conducted jointly in Singapore recorded a speed of 41.7\n\n  knots which was above the 40 knots specified;(ii) the Defendants’ allegation that the Vessel was not up to\n\n  speed was based on sea trials conducted by them in the absence of the Plaintiffs’\n\n  representatives;(iii) the conditions of the Defendants’ unilateral sea trials were\n\n  suspect because the weather conditions were not recorded; and(iv) the modification works carried out would at most have reduced the\n\n  speed by 0.5 to 1.0 knots.26 Lim thus gave the impression that a proper sea trial had been done\n\nin Singapore and that it was witnessed by both parties. At that sea trial the Passion had\n\nrecorded a speed of 41.7 knots, well in excess of the specified speed of 40 knots.\n\nTherefore it was fraudulent of the Defendants to go on to conduct a further speed trial\n\nunder spurious conditions in which the Plaintiffs’ representatives were not present\n\nand then claim that the Passion did not attain the speed specified. Lim did not disclose\n\nin her affidavit that the sea trial in Singapore was unacceptable because the engines were\n\noverloaded when the speeds of 41.7 knots was achieved.27 A party applyingex partefor an injunction on an urgent\n\nbasis owes a duty to the court to set out all the relevant facts, in particular any\n\npossible defence that would weaken his case for an injunction. But even if there has been\n\nmaterial non-disclosure, the court nevertheless has the discretion to continue an\n\ninjunction if the justice of the case requires it: seeDauphin Offshore Engineering\n\n& Trading Pte Ltd v The Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al\n\nNahyan[2000] 1 SLR 657at para 48. In the present case, not only did Lim fail to\n\ndisclose those matters which she was aware of and highlight the relevant correspondence in\n\nher affidavit, she had gone out of the way to paint a wholly different picture in order to\n\nattach fraud on the Defendants and in so doing had misled the court. The Plaintiffs had\n\npresented such a distorted view of the facts that to ignore their non-disclosure would be\n\nto reward such behaviour and encourage similar acts by other parties. Therefore, on this\n\nbasis alone, the injunction ought to be discharged.English law28 The foregoing are sufficient grounds for my decision to discharge\n\nthe injunction. However in the course of writing this judgment, I discovered an\n\ninteresting point which deserves ventilation.29 Both the Agreement and BG are expressed to be governed by English\n\nlaw. It was held inNew Civilbuild Pte Ltd v Guobena Snd Bhd[1999] 1 SLR 374that\n\nthere was no concept of unconscionability in English law in relation to on-demand bonds\n\nand that fraud was the sole exception. The court went on to find that the Court of Appeal\n\ninBocotra Construction Pte Ltd v A-G (No 2)[1995] 2 SLR 733did not rule\n\notherwise, notwithstanding that the term unconscionability was used in that judgment.\n\nHowever inGHL Pte Ltd v Unitrack Building Construction Pte Ltd[1999] 4 SLR 604the Court of Appeal disagreed with that view and held that the court inBocotrahad\n\nmade a conscious departure from English law in that unconscionability was another\n\nexception under Singapore law. The court held (at para 16):\"It is abundantly clear from the judgment that the court expressly held that\n\n  `fraud or unconscionability` was a ground on which the court would interfere and restrain\n\n  the enforcement of a performance bond. It is significant that in that judgment the court\n\n  on no less than three occasions referred consistently to `fraud or unconscionability` as a\n\n  ground for the grant of an injunction. We should add that the concept of\n\n  `unconscionability` was adopted after deliberation, and was not inadvertently inserted as\n\n  a result of a slip; nor was it intended to be used synonymously or interchangeably with\n\n  `fraud`. There is nothing in that judgment which can be said to indicate or suggest that\n\n  the court did not decide that `unconscionability` alone is not a separate ground as\n\n  distinct from fraud. We accept that to that extent, Bocotra is a departure, and if we may\n\n  respectfully say so, a conscious departure, from the English position.\"30 This position is reinforced in the recent decision of the Court of\n\nAppeal inEltraco International Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd[2000] 4 SLR 290.\n\nIn that judgment, the court referred to the English decision ofCargill International\n\nSA & Anor v Bangladesh Sugar & Food Industries Corp[1996] 4 All ER 563 and\n\nobserved as follows (at para 38):\"38 There is one other observation onCargill Internationalwhich\n\n  we should make. If the fact situation in that case were to recur in a Singapore case, the\n\n  court here might well have issued a restraint on the call since unconscionability is a\n\n  ground on which a Singapore court would grant restraint, unlike the position in\n\n  England.\"31 As unconscionability is not an exception in English law, there is\n\nthe question as to whether the Plaintiffs may rely upon this ground in addition to fraud\n\nbecause the relevant contracts, i.e. the Agreement and the BG, are governed by English\n\nlaw. However this issue is not necessary for my decision and I did not have the benefit of\n\nsubmissions from counsel. Therefore I will be content to merely raise it here and leave\n\nthis question to be decided elsewhere.Sgd:Lee Seiu KinJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
