        "SUMMARY OF FACTS IN SUIT NO. 834\n\nOF 2001": "2.\n\n        The following facts appear in the aforesaid\n\naffidavit as well as in the affidavit of Philippa Kilburn-Toppin, Executive Director of\n\nthe Defendant, filed on 14 October 2002 to oppose the Originating Motion.3.\n\n        Anthony Wee Soon Kim is a 72 year old retired\n\nlawyer suffering a serious heart ailment complicated by diabetes and renal failure. UBS AG\n\nis an international private bank carrying on business in Singapore in accordance with the\n\nAssociation of Banks in Singapore’s Code of Conduct.4.\n\n        In August 1997, Anthony Wee’s son,\n\nRichard, received a tip that the Malaysian Ringgit (‘RM’) was likely to\n\nstrengthen and decided, with his father’s consent, to use his father’s account\n\nwith the bank to purchase RM35 million against a US$ loan. However, the RM weakened\n\nagainst the US$. By December 1997, Anthony Wee was deeply concerned about the mounting\n\nlosses he was suffering as a result of that transaction. He therefore asked the bank for\n\nsuggestions on how he could effectively manage his losses.5.\n\n        The bank offered him the following 3\n\nalternative strategies :(1)    keep his\n\n    existing RM position and do nothing;(2)    cut his RM\n\n    position immediately and convert it into US$, realizing his losses;(3)    adopt the\n\n    ‘DFF Strategy’ which consisted of an investment in the bank’s US$\n\n    denominated Dynamic Floor Fund (‘DFF’) and a 12-month Forward Foreign Exchange\n\n    trade buying RM against the US$.After several meetings, Anthony\n\nWee decided to adopt the DFF Strategy.6.\n\n        Around the middle of 1998, interest rates for\n\nthe RM shot up to almost 30% per annum as the Malaysian government aggressively raised\n\ninterest rates in order to fend off speculative attacks on the RM. When Anthony Wee\n\neventually unwound the DFF Strategy on 28 July 1998, it had yielded him a positive return\n\nof about RM915,000. He would have been much better off financially had he kept his RM\n\nposition intact in December 1997. In September 1998, as a result of the capital measures\n\nimposed by Bank Negara, the bank converted Anthony Wee’s RM deposits at US$1 to RM4,\n\nthe rate adopted by the Association of Banks in Singapore7.\n\n        On 4 July 2001, Anthony Wee commenced this\n\naction against the bank, alleging that the bank’s representatives misrepresented the\n\nDFF Strategy to him. He also claimed that the conversion of his RM deposits was wrongful\n\nand took issue with various charges and fees debited against his account. Engelin Teh, SC\n\nand Thomas Sim represented Anthony Wee while the bank was defended by Davinder Singh, SC\n\nand his assistants.8.\n\n        The trial began on 26 February 2002. At the\n\ncommencement of Anthony Wee’s cross-examination, his then counsel requested that he\n\nbe cross-examined in the morning sessions only as he was not fit enough to continue the\n\nfull day. That was granted by the trial judge. During the course of the cross-examination,\n\nAnthony Wee also asked for breaks on account of his medical condition. The\n\ncross-examination thus took up the three weeks fixed for the trial. The trial was then\n\nscheduled to continue for a further six weeks from 22 July to 30 August 2002.9.\n\n        In the meantime, Anthony Wee discharged his\n\nlawyers ‘because of differences with Mr Thomas Sim as to the conduct of the\n\ncase.’ He then engaged the services of Goh Aik Leng & Partners who, on 9 July\n\n2002, filed and served the Notice of Appointment of Solicitors to act for Anthony Wee.\n\nHowever, in their letter to the bank’s solicitors, the new solicitors stated that\n\nthey were the solicitors on record and that Anthony Wee ‘will still be conducting his\n\nown case as counsel’ and ‘will be assisted by his co-counsel Mr Mohan\n\nSingh’.10.\n\n        On 15 July 2002, the parties appeared before\n\nthe trial judge for the hearing of an interlocutory application. Anthony Wee turned up\n\naccompanied by Mark Goh and Mohan Singh. Mohan Singh informed the judge that he had been\n\ninstructed to have conduct of the application in the event Anthony Wee was not medically\n\nfit to continue. Mark Goh told the judge that Anthony Wee would be arguing the application\n\nhimself. The judge ruled that Anthony Wee could not do so as he had solicitors acting for\n\nhim. He then stood the matter down for Anthony Wee and his solicitors to discuss the\n\nmatter.11.\n\n        When the parties returned to the judge’s\n\nchambers, Mark Goh applied to discharge himself on the basis that Anthony Wee insisted on\n\narguing the application himself. He was discharged accordingly but was permitted to remain\n\nto assist Anthony Wee as a ‘McKenzie friend’. The interlocutory application was\n\nsubsequently dealt with.12.\n\n        On 19 July 2002, Goh Aik Leng & Partners\n\nfiled a second Notice of Appointment of Solicitors but did not serve it on the bank’s\n\nsolicitors.13.\n\n        The trial resumed on 22 July 2002. Anthony Wee\n\nwas absent as he was unwell. Mark Goh and Mohan Singh attended the proceedings introducing\n\nthemselves as the ‘friend’ and the ‘co-counsel’ respectively. Mohan\n\nSingh told the trial judge he had been instructed, in view of Anthony Wee’s age and\n\ncondition, to assist him in the event he was unable to carry on and to cross-examine and\n\nre-examine such witnesses as directed by Anthony Wee, who would remain a litigant in\n\nperson. The judge took issue with this. The hearing was then adjourned to 24 July 2002.14.\n\n        On 24 July 2002, only Mark Goh attended on\n\nbehalf of Anthony Wee. He informed the judge that Anthony Wee had instructed Mohan Singh\n\nto withdraw from the action. The judge permitted Mark Goh to act as the ‘friend’\n\nbut refused his application for leave to address the court on Anthony Wee’s behalf.\n\nAn appeal against this ruling is pending before the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No. 81\n\nof 2002, due to be heard in November 2002. The judge also directed that a medical\n\ncertificate in respect of Anthony Wee be produced.15.\n\n        On 26 July 2002, Mark Goh produced a medical\n\ncertificate stating that Anthony Wee was unfit to attend court for 60 days from 24 July\n\n2002 to 21 September 2002. The trial dates were thus vacated.16.\n\n        Later that day, Goh Aik Leng & Partners\n\nfaxed the second Notice of Appointment of Solicitors to the bank’s solicitors. At\n\naround the same time, the parties were informed to attend before the trial judge again at\n\n4 pm that day to clarify the position on the second Notice. When they attended before the\n\njudge, Mark Goh explained that the said second Notice was filed in error and that Anthony\n\nWee remained a litigant in person.17.\n\n        Four days later, on 30 July 2002, the same firm\n\nof solicitors wrote to the Registrar of the Supreme Court on behalf of Anthony Wee to\n\nrequest further arguments on the interlocutory application. On 1 August 2002, the\n\nRegistrar replied stating that the judge had instructed that such a request should come\n\nfrom Anthony Wee as he was a litigant acting in person.18.\n\n        Anthony Wee sent a response to the Registrar on\n\n2 August 2002, arguing that his duly appointed lawyer had ‘the lawful right to act on\n\nmy behalf, and on that footing to request for further argument regardless of my status as\n\na litigant in person’. An exchange of correspondence between the Registry and Anthony\n\nWee followed. On 12 August 2002, Goh Aik Leng & Partners wrote to the Registrar with\n\nthe concluding paragraphs of that letter stating :\"In view of the\n\n    uncompromising directions and our client’s life threatening heart disease aggravated\n\n    by the difficulties thrown his way as regards the filing of the various Court documents,\n\n    he has, with great reluctance, instructed us to advise you to treat his Notice of\n\n    Intention to Act in Person as withdrawn so that the perceived legal impediments may cease\n\n    to exist.In the premises, we trust that we\n\n    will now be able to represent Mr Wee to the fullest extent the Legal Profession Act (Cap\n\n    161) would allow.\"19.\n\n        On 2 October 2002, the present Originating\n\nMotion was filed by Goh Aik Leng & Partners.",
        "THE DECISION OF THE COURT": "20.\n\n        The law on admission of Queen’s Counsel\n\nunder section 21 of the Legal Profession Act is clear. As set out inRe Caplan Jonathan\n\nMichael QC[1998] 1 SLR 432at 435 and applied in many subsequent cases, an\n\napplication for admission under that section has to satisfy a three-stage test. At the\n\nfirst stage, the applicant must demonstrate that the case in which he seeks to appear\n\ncontains issues of law and/or fact of sufficient difficulty and complexity to require\n\nelucidation and/or argument by a Queen’s Counsel. Such difficulty or complexity is\n\nnot of itself a guarantee of admission, for the decision to admit is still a matter for\n\nthe court’s discretion. At the second stage, therefore, the applicant must persuade\n\nthe court that the circumstances of the particular case warrant the court exercising its\n\ndiscretion in favour of his admission. Finally, the applicant has to satisfy the court of\n\nhis suitability for admission.21.\n\n        According to Mark Goh Aik Leng, the factual\n\nmatrix of the action was complex and difficult. The difficulty was compounded by the\n\npresence of allegedly altered documents and the bank’s campaign of selective and\n\nmisleading disclosure. Accordingly, the facts would ‘require considerable acumen on\n\nthe part of any counsel for (Anthony Wee)’. It was also submitted that there were\n\nmany legal issues involving negligence, fraud, fiduciary and equitable duties and breach\n\nof contract. It was pointed out that the law in respect of fiduciary duties owed by a\n\nprivate banker to a client had undergone significant evolution in recent years to keep\n\npace with the changes in the banking industry and that there was no local authority that\n\ndefinitively addressed the issues relating to private banking. The applicant’s\n\nwritten submissions (at paragraph 56) state:\"In essence, the issues in\n\n    Suit 834 of 2001 relate to the basic principles stemming from contract, tort and equity,\n\n    albeit in a novel and undeveloped area of the law from the perspective of a special\n\n    relationship of a private investment banker versus a high net worth customer.\"22.\n\n        The above view as to the complexity and\n\ndifficulty of the case in fact and in law was not shared by all the other parties to this\n\napplication. The bank’s view was that the issues concerned essentially the\n\nrelationship between a bank and its customer and allegations of misrepresentation and/or\n\nfraud. It was argued that the issues were largely factual and were not unique or complex\n\nand that such issues have been considered in many local decisions argued by local counsel.\n\nThe law in respect of banker-customer relationship, it was submitted, was no different for\n\nprivate bankers. The Attorney-General’s Chambers and the Law Society of Singapore\n\nwere also of the same view.23.\n\n        I agree that the facts and the legal issues in\n\nthe proceedings between Anthony Wee and the bank are not of sufficient difficulty and\n\ncomplexity to warrant the admission of Queen’s Counsel. A long story is not always a\n\ncomplicated one. New factual situations, like new business practices, will always arise.\n\nWith each new permutation of facts, the law is applied, sometimes by way of extension, at\n\nother times by refinement, of the principles involved. The existing local case law and\n\nlegal treatises would probably be more than adequate to dispose of the legal issues that\n\narise. Even if reference has to be made to decisions elsewhere, and that is hardly unique\n\nto this case, I do not see why that should necessarily elevate the case to such level of\n\ndifficulty or complexity that it would require elucidation or argument by Queen’s\n\nCounsel.24.\n\n        I now consider the other circumstances in this\n\ncase. The applicant submitted that the ability and the availability of local counsel to\n\nhandle this case was not by itself an absolute bar to the admission of a Queen’s\n\nCounsel. InRe Beloff Michael Jacob[2000] 2 SLR 782, the defendants (Singtel)\n\nappointed local Senior Counsel to argue their case. The plaintiffs (Japura) did not\n\nattempt to engage local counsel but successfully sought the admission of Stuart Lindsay\n\nIsaacs QC to argue their case. Following that, the defendants decided that they also\n\nwanted a Queen’s Counsel to argue their case. In allowing the defendants’\n\napplication to admit their Queen’s Counsel, Yong Pung How CJ said :\"13.    \n\n    Japura’s first objection was that Singtel was already ably represented by Senior\n\n    Counsel Mr Michael Hwang SC and junior counsel, and therefore did not require the services\n\n    of Mr Beloff. The first point to note is that the availability and ability of local\n\n    counsel is notper sean absolute bar to admission of a Queen’s Counsel –\n\n    at the second stage of the test for admission, the court is required to engage in a\n\n    balancing exercise, and the ability and availability of local counsel is only one of the\n\n    factors to be placed on the scales: seeRe Caplan Jonathan Michael QC (No 2)[1998]     1 SLR 440. The second point to note is that there is no general rule that prohibits a\n\n    litigant from engaging both a Queen’s Counsel and a local Senior Counsel to argue his\n\n    case. What the court is concerned with in each case is whether, having found that the\n\n    issues of fact and law are of sufficient difficulty or complexity to justify the admission\n\n    of a Queen’s Counsel, there are circumstances in that particular case which point the\n\n    court towards either exercising or not exercising its discretion in favour of the\n\n    applicant. Each case must be decided on its own facts.14. … In my judgment, having\n\n    held that the factual and legal matrix of the case were sufficiently complex and difficult\n\n    to warrant the admission of Mr Isaacs on Japura’s behalf, it was important to ensure\n\n    a level playing field by also allowing Singtel to engage a Queen’s Counsel, if it so\n\n    wished. I found no reason to penalise Singtel simply because it had already retained local\n\n    Senior Counsel. After all, the fact that Japura had not made any attempt at all to engage\n\n    local Senior Counsel was not held against it when it sought to admit Mr Isaacs.\"25.\n\n        In the present case, let us examine how Anthony\n\nWee came to be in the predicament he found himself in where the issue of legal\n\nrepresentation is concerned. Mark Goh Aik Leng’s affidavit makes the following\n\nstatements (with Anthony Wee referred to as ‘the Plaintiff’) :\"53.    The\n\n    Plaintiff has previously appointed a leading local Senior Counsel to act for him. However,\n\n    much to his dismay, he found that her strongly recommended assistant also refused to take\n\n    the Plaintiff’s instructions and on that basis she offered to withdraw. The Plaintiff\n\n    was thus compelled to act in person. However, the Plaintiff’s health and age\n\n    precludes him from continuing to act as a litigant in person.54.    Senior\n\n    Counsel Davinder Singh of Drew & Napier acts as lead counsel for the Defence. In the\n\n    course of his illustrious career, her has acquired a daunting, if not absolutely fearsome\n\n    reputation as Singapore’s foremost litigator.55.    Mr Davinder\n\n    Singh acted for UBS AG Singapore and commenced an Originating Summons No. 546 of 1999\n\n    against the Plaintiff, his wife Betty Wee and his son Richard Wee as the 1st, 2nd& 3rdDefendants respectively for an order that the Plaintiff’s\n\n    personal assets held under his personal account with UBS AG Hong Kong Branch be delivered\n\n    to the Plaintiff’s and/or his wife’s and/or son in Singapore on the false\n\n    premise that said personal assets were previously held in their joint account No. 110628\n\n    in Singapore.56.    On the\n\n    recommendation of a fellow lawyer, the Plaintiff then instructed Senior Counsel Harry\n\n    Elias and his partner one Lawrence Quahe to resist the aforesaid OS 546/99 as well as to\n\n    commence an action against UBS AG in Singapore. Regrettably, at the hearing before a\n\n    Judicial Commissioner, Mr Elias SC did avolte faceand strongly advised the\n\n    Plaintiff to accept the delivery of the assets in question. As an inducement, Mr Elias SC\n\n    even offered to waive his costs without a fight. The other inducement was that the\n\n    Plaintiff would be free to commence the intended action without delay. His partner Mr\n\n    Lawrence Quahe opposed the taxation of the bill of costs submitted by Drew & Napier\n\n    which was claimed at $56,563.07 in an uncontested application.57.    In the\n\n    result, the Plaintiff was not able to find a local Senior Counsel that he could be\n\n    comfortable with. This is particularly so, in view of his experience with his Senior\n\n    Counsel Engelin Teh of Engelin Teh Practice LLC and Senior Counsel Harry Elias.\"26.\n\n        It was said in court that Anthony Wee did not\n\nwish to go into the reasons why he was not comfortable with the two Senior Counsel who had\n\nacted for him previously. Mohan Singh was only willing to play a supporting role and the\n\ncase was said to be too complex for Mark Goh Aik Leng’s one-man firm. Due to his age\n\nand the poor state of his health, Anthony Wee was unable to handle the case himself and\n\n‘was compelled to seek assistance of a Queen’s Counsel whose ability and more\n\nimportantly whose integrity (he) is comfortable with.’27.\n\n        The crux of all that is set out above appears\n\nto be that there is no dearth of local lawyers able and willing to handle the case and to\n\nact for Anthony Wee but he is not willing to have them for his lawyers. It would seem\n\nthat, of the two lawyers in Singapore he is comfortable with, one is willing to assist\n\nonly but not to conduct the case while the other feels totally inadequate for the task.\n\nEven assuming his feelings about the two Senior Counsel are justified, is it reasonable of\n\nhim to assume that the twenty or so other Senior Counsel would disappoint him in like\n\nfashion ? Surely not. What about the 3,000 other practising members of the local Bar? His\n\nunjustifiable stance in this case does not warrant the court exercising its discretion in\n\nhis favour.28.\n\n        I was also urged to take into consideration the\n\nlarge amount of money involved in the case and the fact that Singapore aims to be the\n\nregional hub for financial and banking services. I do not see how disallowing the\n\napplication to admit Queen’s Counsel in the circumstances here would detract from\n\nthis objective. It is patently clear that there is no shortage of local lawyers who are\n\nmore than capable of handling the factual and legal issues for Anthony Wee in his dispute\n\nwith the bank.29.\n\n        I now consider the qualifications of Gerald\n\nGodfrey QC. He practised at the Chancery/Commercial Bar in England for 30 years, 15 of\n\nwhich were as a Queen’s Counsel. He appeared frequently in the High Court and the\n\nCourt of Appeal in England and in Hong Kong as well as in the House of Lords and the Privy\n\nCouncil. He has also appeared in Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, the Bahamas and Kenya. He is\n\nan experienced arbitrator and a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators. He is\n\nalso a member of the International Academy of Estate and Trust Law and of the Insolvency\n\nPractitioners Association. He has addressed many international law conferences in his\n\nvarious fields of expertise and has given lectures by invitation at Harvard and Tufts\n\nUniversities in the USA.30.\n\n        In 1981, he was appointed Chairman of the team\n\ninvestigating the affairs of St Piran Ltd ordered by the United Kingdom’s Director of\n\nTrade. The matter involved allegations that a financier who had acquired a public listed\n\ncompany was stripping its assets to the detriment of the minority shareholders. It was\n\nsubmitted that this illustrated the Queen’s Counsel’s ‘expertise and skill\n\nwent beyond his extensive Chancery/Commercial practice into the field of fraud by crooked\n\nfinanciers’ and that he is therefore eminently qualified to assist the court in\n\ndetermining whether Anthony Wee had been defrauded by the bank.31.\n\n        In 1986, Gerald Godfrey QC was appointed a High\n\nCourt Judge in Hong Kong. In that capacity, he delivered many landmark judgments in\n\nconveyancing, trust, arbitration, revenue and company law. In 1993, he was appointed to\n\nthe Court of Appeal in Hong Kong and in 2000 he became the Vice-President of that Court.\n\nHe retired on 29 July 2001 and was honoured with a CBE on 31 December 2001.32.\n\n        The bank submitted that the Queen’s\n\nCounsel did not meet the criterion of ‘special qualifications or experience for the\n\npurpose of the case’ [section 21(1)(c) of the Legal Profession Act]. It argued that\n\nthere was no evidence he had conducted or had been involved in cases involving\n\nbanker-customer issues, fraud or breach of fiduciary duties. The landmark decisions\n\ndelivered by him as a Judge also did not concern these issues. This view was shared by the\n\nAttorney-General’s Chambers and the Law Society of Singapore.33.\n\n        With the greatest of respect to Gerald Godfrey\n\nQC, despite his very impressive achievements and ability, his qualifications and\n\nexperience do not quite meet the requirements of the case before the court. It is not\n\nimmediately obvious from all that has been stated in the documents before me that he has\n\nspecial qualifications or experience in the area of banking law, private or otherwise. The\n\ncriterion set out in the said section 21(1)(c) has therefore not been satisfied.34.\n\n        For the above reasons, I dismissed the\n\nOriginating Motion with costs fixed at $5,000 to be paid by Anthony Wee to the bank.Sgd:Tay Yong KwangJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
