        "Question (1): Whether assignment of the [option participation assets] was a pre-condition to payment by the plaintiff of the balance purchase price": "13     There clearly is no such pre-condition and the position is in fact the converse. Clause 2.1 of the option agreement provides as follows: Call Option: In consideration of the payment by the Purchaser to the Vendor of the Premium (payable in accordance with the provisions of Clause 3), the Vendor hereby irrevocably grants to the Purchaser … the Call Option to require the Vendor to sell to the Purchaser … the Option Participation Assets … 14     Clause 3.1 provides that the premium shall be the purchase price for the option participation assets plus transaction costs. Clause 3.2 requires the plaintiff to deposit, within three business days of the date of the option agreement, the Deposit into an account in a New York bank. It also obliges the plaintiff to deposit additional sums into that account within five business days of written request by the defendant. Clause 3.3 authorises the defendant to transfer from that account into its own account an amount equal to the premium estimated by the defendant to be payable by the plaintiff in respect of the option participation assets. Clause 3.5 provides as follows: Sufficient Funds: For the avoidance of doubt, the Vendor shall not be obliged to purchase Option Participation Assets if the Account does not contain sufficient funds for the Vendor to withdraw and transfer an amount equal to the Premium in accordance with Clause 3.3. 15     Clause 3.5 of the option agreement clearly provides that the defendant shall not be obliged to purchase the option participation assets if the Account did not contain sufficient funds for the defendant to withdraw and transfer an amount equal to the premium. As the plaintiff had not paid up the balance purchase price, there was simply no obligation on the part of the defendant to purchase the option participation assets, let alone transfer anything.",
        "Question (2): Whether the contract was discharged by reason of the plaintiff’s failure to pay the balance purchase price by the settlement date": "16     The termination clause in the trade confirmation agreement provides as follows: The Purchaser’s rights to the Assets, the Deposit, the PDI and Other Distributions shall be forfeited if the Purchaser fails to pay (a) the Deposit three business days before the Signing Date or (b) the Purchase Price Balance on Settlement Date, unless the Vendor, in its sole discretion, agrees to extend the Signing Date or the Settlement Date, as applicable. 17     This clause clearly deals with the consequences of breach of the plaintiff’s obligation to pay the purchase price balance on the settlement date. As the plaintiff had failed to make such payment by that date, the defendant was entitled to forfeit the Deposit under this provision. I should add that although labelled as a termination clause, this is more in the nature of a liquidated damages provision as it limits the damages payable by the buyer to the seller in the event of a breach of contract by the buyer.",
        "Question (3): Whether the termination clause in the WestLB-Metro trade confirmation is a penalty": "18     Before me, counsel for the plaintiff conceded that the termination clause is not a penalty. Therefore I need not deal with this issue, which the assistant registrar had answered in the negative.",
        "Question (4): Whether the plaintiff is entitled to equitable relief from forfeiture of the Deposit": "19     InPacific Rim Investments Pte Ltd v Lam Seng Tiong[1995] 3 SLR 1, the plaintiff had entered into a sale and purchase agreement with the defendant property developer for an uncompleted house, with provisions for payment by instalments. There was a dispute over whether the parties were entitled to set off sums owed in late completion interest and liquidated damages and both parties contended that the other had wrongfully repudiated the agreement. Although the suit was determined on the basis of other grounds, in its judgment, the Court of Appeal dealt extensively with the issue of equitable relief from forfeiture of the purchaser’s interest in land. Thean JA (as he then was) cited Lord Wilberforce inShiloh Spinners Ltd v Harding[1973] AC 691 at [722] where he reaffirmed “the right of courts of equity in appropriate and limited cases to relieve against forfeiture for breach of covenant or condition where the primary object of the bargain is to secure a stated result which can effectively be attained when the matter comes before the court, and where the forfeiture provision is added by way of security for the production of the result.” His Lordship added that in exercising such discretion to grant relief, the court would consider the conduct of the applicant, in particular whether his default was wilful, the gravity of the breaches, the disparity between the value of the property of which forfeiture is claimed and the damage caused by the breach. 20     Thean JA then referred to the House of Lords decision inThe Scaptrade; Scandinavian Trading Tanker Co AB v Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana[1983] 2 AC 694 which held that equitable relief from forfeiture was inapplicable in that case, where the shipowner, who had chartered his vessel to the charterer under a time charter, had withdrawn the vessel from hire for non-payment of hire on the stipulated date. Lord Diplock held that what Lord Wilberforce said inShiloh Spinners Ltd“was never meant to apply generally to contracts not involving any transfer of proprietary or possessory rights”. Thean JA went on to citeSport International Bussum BV v Inter-Footwear Ltd[1984] 1 WLR 776 for the proposition that equitable relief has not been granted to purely commercial contracts unconnected with any interests in land, and declared at paragraph 42 that there was: no general principle that whenever a party to a contract is given a contractual right to terminate or rescind the contract for a breach which consists only of non-payment of a sum of money and where the purpose of incorporating such right is to secure payment of that sum, there is an equitable jurisdiction to grant relief against the exercise of such right of termination or rescission. In accepting that the court had the power in appropriate cases to grant relief from forfeiture in a contract for sale of land, Thean JA said that such jurisdiction would only be exercised in exceptional circumstances since the courts would not ordinarily countenance a departure from contractual rights and obligations. In order to invoke successfully the courts’ jurisdiction, the circumstances of the case must reveal elements of unconscionability and injustice. 21     InTriangle Auto Pte Ltd v Zheng Zi Construction Pte Ltd[2001] 1 SLR 370(“Triangle Auto’scase”), Selvam J (as he then was) reviewed the law on deposits and three cases:Mayson v Clouet[1924] AC 980,Linggi Plantations Ltd v Jagatheesan[1972] 1 MLJ 89andWorkers Trust & Merchant Bank Ltd v Dojup Investments Pte Ltd[1993] 2 WLR 702. The judge concluded that if the deposit was penal, that is, not reasonable as earnest money, the court could grant relief from forfeiture of the deposit when the contract is discharged. He found that this principle, established in contracts relating to the sale of land also applied to contracts relating to the sale of goods. 22     The cases on relief from forfeiture of payments made in the context of a contract that has been discharged have been examined inGoff and Jones: The Law of Restitutionwhere the authors concluded as follows at [20-046]: The scope of equity’s power to grant relief is then uncertain. The cases suggest that the courts may relieve against the forfeiture of proprietary or possessory interests if the forfeiture can be characterised as unconscionable. It is doubtful whether the certainty of commercial transactions would be endangered if, following Lord Denning inStockloser v Johnson, the courts were to accept a jurisdiction to relieve against the consequence of forfeiture of instalment payments, even if there was no forfeiture of a proprietary or possessory right, if the forfeiture would be penal and out of proportion to the loss suffered. Equity already relieves against the payment of penalties, and may raise an estoppel against a person if it would be unconscionable for him to assert his legal rights. It would be regrettable, therefore, to conclude that the courts never have jurisdiction to relieve against the forfeiture of such payments, made in the course of the performance of commercial contracts, although it is proper to affirm that relief should be granted only in exceptional circumstances and that the burden should be on the party in breach to demonstrate that the retention of any payment was unconscionable. There is no doubt therefore that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that it would be unconscionable on the part of the defendant to forfeit the Deposit. 23     The situation in this case does not concern the forfeiture of a proprietary or a possessory right. It essentially concerns an arm’s length contract between two parties who were advised by their solicitors at all times pertaining to the purchase of a distressed debt. Even if the court has power to grant relief against forfeiture in this case, it would be necessary to inquire into the necessity, in the circumstances of this case, of exercising such power, which alters the bargain between the parties. I am not satisfied that the need to do so arises in this present case. 24     In support of their case for equitable relief, the plaintiff relied principally onWorkersTrust & Merchant Bank Ltd v Dojap Investments Ltd[1993] 2 WLR 702 (“Workers Trust’scase”), a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from Jamaica. A purchaser of property from a bank had paid a deposit of 25% of the price but failed to pay the balance purchase money in time. The Privy Council held that as the customary practice was for a 10% deposit to be taken, a vendor who seeks to obtain a larger amount must show special circumstances to justify such a deposit. The bank was unable to do so and their Lordships found the deposit to be unreasonable and granted the purchaser equitable relief against forfeiture. The Privy Council ordered that the deposit be refunded subject to a deduction of a sum to account of damages which the bank may have suffered. This position was followed by the High Court inTriangle Auto’scase. 25     The plaintiff filed an affidavit by one Chun Jung Hoon, the business head of the Korea/Japan corporate institutional group of ARAB Bank plc. He claimed to be an expert in distressed debt transactions and gave his opinion that “it has never been customary for any seller to require a deposit to be paid for the distressed debt. The established customary practice in such transactions, over the decades and even before that, is that no deposit is paid in the purchase of a distressed debt.” He concluded that the deposit in the present case, amounting to almost 15% of the purchase price, did not accord with the customary market practice whereby no deposit is paid. Chun subsequently filed a second affidavit in which he said that, “for the type of transactions such as the proposed sale and purchase of the Asset in the present case, the customary practice is not to have any deposit paid in advance …” However in the next paragraph, he said that in the present case “if a deposit were to be payable .. a reasonable deposit would be a nominal amount in the region of 1% …” It should be noted that Chun had stated that it was customary that no deposit would be paid, then proceeded to state that if a deposit were payable, a reasonable (but no longer customary) deposit would be a nominal 1%. 26     I am not impressed by this evidence. Furthermore, the transaction in question is not even the usual sale of distressed debt by a party that owns such debt. It concerns a party, the defendant, who was brought in because it had the qualification to purchase the debt from Citigroup and from which the plaintiff could then purchase such debt once the defendant had acquired it upon being put in funds by the plaintiff. Chun did not refer to a transaction of this nature. Indeed it is difficult to say that there is anything customary about this transaction and certainly there would be no such thing as a customary deposit in such an unusual transaction. Chun was talking about a normal transaction in distressed debts, although even for that, it is difficult to fathom that it is anything near the established practice in purchases in real property, which was what theWorkers Trust’scase is concerned with. 27     I therefore found no grounds to grant relief against forfeiture in this case."
