        "The sentence": "Section 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224) provides for mandatory imprisonment for life or for a term of up to ten years. The section also provides for a discretionary fine or caning.On the basis of Dr Phang`s psychiatric report on the accused, the prosecution submitted that life imprisonment was the appropriate sentence here. The prosecution said it was looking beyond retribution to the need for protection of the public.On the other hand, defence counsel submitted that life imprisonment would be too harsh for this accused who did not choose to suffer from mental illness and who was a danger only if he did not take his medication.The accused is a divorcee with a 15-year-old son. His mother is 68 years old. His father passed away many years ago. He has nine other siblings. He deeply  regretted taking his elder brother`s life and could not understand why he had done so.Defence counsel further argued that while the accused`s family members were less than enthusiastic about taking care of him, they could apply under the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act at the appropriate time for the accused to be placed in an institution. Although they were not people of means, they could make such an application with the assistance of the Legal Aid Bureau.Neo Man Lee v PP[1991] SLR 146[1991] 2 MLJ 369was a case involving a schizophrenic man convicted under s 304(a) of the Penal Code for having stabbed a woman to death in the changing room of a condominium. The accused there was arrested on 27 September 1984 and after a trial which stretched from 3 October 1988 to 25 May 1989, he was convicted and sentenced by FA Chua J to life imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest. The judge there said:The doctors have reported that you are suffering from a chronic schizophrenic illness which requires a long-term maintenance drug treatment for an indefinite period and that is to minimize relapses and if you have a relapse, you may pose a danger to yourself and to society. Now, the public must be protected against you and the detention, in my view, should be as long as it is permissible under the law. A long-term imprisonment would also be for your own good because whilst in prison, you will get proper medical care and attention. I will be failing in my duty if I do not sentence you to a long term of imprisonment. You are sentenced to imprisonment for life.On appeal to the then Court of Criminal Appeal, Yong Pung How CJ said:Section 304(a) is, on the face of it, rather curiously drafted, because in addition to the sentence to imprisonment for life, there is the alternative possibility of a much lighter custodial sentence up to a maximum of ten years. The only question in the present case was whether the sentence to imprisonment for life was justified.The deputy public prosecutor referred us to a report on sentencing from the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal in England in the case ofR v Rowland Jack Foster Hodgson[1968] 52 Cr App R 113which carried the following statement by MacKenna J, with which we are in broad agreement:`When the following conditions are satisfied, a sentence of life imprisonment is in our opinion justified: (1) where the offence or offences are in themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence; (2) where it appears from the nature of the offences or from the defendant`s history that he is a person of unstable character likely to commit such offences in the future; and (3) where if the offences are committed the consequences to others may be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual offences or crimes of violence.`In the present case, the appellant has been suffering from schizophrenia, a major mental illness, since 1975. Both the psychiatrists` reports, which were considered by the court before sentence was passed, were to the effect that he would require a long term drug treatment for an indefinite period to minimize relapses during which he might pose a danger to society and himself. In fact, the appellant had two relapses in 1980, one in 1983, and one in 1984 when he committed the present offence; and, while he was in remand in 1987 and 1988 he had two more relapses lasting one week and one month respectively.We were of the opinion that the conditions for sentence to imprisonment for life were clearly satisfied in the present case and justified a life sentence. The appellant is clearly a continuing danger not only to himself but also to the public. The trial judge was of the  view, which we shared, that he should be detained as long as it was permissible under the law. We might add that, with remissions, life imprisonment in Singapore may be reduced in practice to no more than 14 years, and the appellant may in fact be out of prison in another seven years.Subsequently, inAbdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v PP[1997] 3 SLR 643, the Court of Appeal held that a sentence of life imprisonment meant imprisonment for the remaining natural life of the prisoner. After that decision, r 119A of the Prisons Regulations (Cap 247, Rg 2, 1990 Ed) was passed. Under this rule, a Life Imprisonment Review Board reviews the suitability for release of prisoners who have served 20 years of their sentence of life imprisonment at intervals not exceeding 12 months. The Board then submits a written report to the Minister who may, in his discretion, remit, with or without conditions, any part of the sentence of imprisonment to which the prisoners have been sentenced.",
        "Neo Man Lee, Abdul Nasir": "and the said r 119A were re-visited in the Court of Appeal`s decision inPP v Tan Kei Loon Allan[1999] 2 SLR 288. There, an 18-year-old male pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304(a) of the Penal Code for causing the death of another male by stabbing him with a knife. He was sentenced to seven years` imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane. The prosecution, which had urged the trial judge to impose the maximum permissible sentence of life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane, appealed. The Court of Appeal enhanced the sentence to ten years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Commenting onNeo Man Lee`s case, Lai Kew Chai J (delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal) said (at [para ]20):Yong Pung How CJ noted specifically, however, that `with remissions, life imprisonment in Singapore may be reduced in practice to no more than 14 years, and the appellant may in fact be out of prison in another seven years`. That logic is now obviously negated in light of our decision inAbdul Nasir, and all the cases in which the life sentence was imposed must be viewed in that context.The prosecution pointed out five other cases where accused persons suffering from one form of mental disorder or another were sentenced to life imprisonment under s 304(a) of the Penal Code by the High Court. Three of these were pre-Abdul Nasirand two were post-Abdul Nasir. Of these two cases, both involving schizophrenic accused persons, one was convicted after trial and the other was convicted upon his plea of guilt. In the former case (PP v Carilman Aloysius Joshi- CC 43/99) Chan Seng Onn JC said (at [para ]32 of the judgment):The accused never accepted that he had any mental illness. It necessarily followed that he would not take his medication voluntarily. I agreed with the submission of the DPP that the accused must be sentenced to life imprisonment so that he would not become a danger to himself and to society. Whilst under confinement in prison, he would receive proper treatment which would be for his own good.The accused`s appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 22 November 1999. Defence counsel pointed out to me that the accused in that case had been admitted to Woodbridge Hospital some 17 times since 1986 and that he was given to consuming alcohol which would make his mental state worse.I do not consider the comments made inTan Kei Loon Allanas having negated or qualified the principles set out inNeo Man Lee. The earlier Court of  Appeal decision made it clear that when the stated conditions were satisfied, a sentence of imprisonment for life would be justified. There, the Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that the accused, who was suffering from chronic schizophrenia, should be detained for as long as it was permissible under the law and the maximum permissible was life imprisonment. The concluding comment of the Court of Appeal that Neo Man Lee could in fact be released in seven years was no more than a passing remark alluding to the fact that the prisoner had already been in custody for almost seven years at the time of his appeal. I do not think the Court of Appeal would have sentenced the accused there any differently even if the court was of the view that life imprisonment meant imprisonment for the remaining natural life of the accused. I am fortified in this belief by the dismissal of Carilman`s appeal. I therefore applied the principles inNeo Man Leeto the facts of the present case.Here, the accused`s psychiatric history went back to 1986 when he was first treated at a psychiatric outpatient clinic. He defaulted in his treatment and, while in a state of relapse, jumped from a height in 1988, injuring his spine in the process which resulted in partial paralysis of his lower limbs. He resumed psychiatric treatment until July 1991 when he defaulted again. He was admitted to Woodbridge Hospital for two periods of time - from 3 November 1991 to 9 December 1991 and from 14 May 1992 to 4 June 1992 - because of his violent behaviour. He had broken some furniture and assaulted his former wife with a knife.The psychiatrist was of the opinion that the accused required `ongoing treatment, probably on a lifelong basis` and that the act of killing `was a product of his relapsed mental illness`. The psychiatrist concluded his assessment with the following words:I would add that the future of dangerousness remains significant, and he should be held in a secure setting, possibly by subsequently invoking the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act.The accused has shown what he could do in a state of relapse - inflicting 25 incised wounds on another adult male with a chopper. He had also previously attacked his ex-wife with a knife. He had defaulted at least twice in his treatment. He was clearly a continuing danger not only to himself but also to the public.In the circumstances, I imposed a sentence of imprisonment for life on the accused deemed to commence on 9 December 2000, the date of his arrest.Outcome:Order accordingly.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
