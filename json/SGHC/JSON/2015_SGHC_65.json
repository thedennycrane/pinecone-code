        "Introduction": "1       In\nthe last few decades, international arbitration has emerged as an attractive\nand, in certain industries, the preferred form of dispute resolution.\nParties opt for arbitration for various tactical, strategic, and commercial\nreasons including the flexibility to select the tribunal who, in their\nassessment, is best suited to preside over the dispute bearing in\nmind the complexity of the case. Finality of the arbitral award\nis also perceived as a significant advantage though it would be\nfair to say that the perception is viewed less advantageously, after\nthe fact, by the losing party. Curial intervention is therefore\navailable only in limited circumstances, including instances where\nthere has been a breach of natural justice, where the award is tainted\nby fraud or corruption, or where the award has been madeultra viresthe jurisdiction of the tribunal. 2       I\nhave observed a clear trend, in recent times, of parties seeking\nto set aside adverse arbitral awards on the basis of alleged breaches\nof natural justice. Many have failed. It is perhaps opportune for\nme to state that an accusation against a tribunal for committing\na breach of natural justice is a serious matter. The tribunal is\nnot able to defend itself and the accusation can have an adverse\nimpact on the arbitrator’s reputation and standing in the arbitration\ncommunity. The courts take a serious view of such challenges and\nthat is why those which have succeeded are few and far between and\nlimited only to egregious cases where the error is “clear on the face\nof the record” (seeTMM Division Maritima SA\nde CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd[2013] 4 SLR\n972 (“TMM Division”) at [125]). 3       Parties\nhave nonetheless been creative (though ultimately unsuccessful)\nin attempting to expand the defined boundaries of the doctrine of\nbreach of natural justice. Some notable examples include an assertion\nthat the tribunal’s decision to close the arbitral proceedings and subsequent\nrefusal to reopen them upon request was a breach of the right to a\nfair hearing (ADG and another v ADI and another\nmatter[2014] 3 SLR 481) (“ADG v\nADI”); that dilatoriness in the release of an award was evidence\nof apparent bias (PT Central Investindo v Franciscus\nWongso and others and another matter[2014] 4 SLR 978\n(“PT Central Investindo”)); and that\na tribunal’s refusal to admit an expert report tendered on the last\nday of the hearing was a breach of the right to a fair hearing (Triulzi Cesare SRL v Xinyi Group (Glass) Co Ltd[2015]\n1 SLR 114) (“Triulzi”). 4       The\npresent case represents another novel attempt to set aside an arbitral\naward. In brief, the plaintiff’s argument is two-fold. First, the plaintiff\nargues that the Tribunal had breached itsdutyunder\nRule 27.1 (“r 27.1”) of the 2007 Singapore International Arbitration\nCentre Rules (“the 2007 SIAC Rules”) because it failed to declare\nthe arbitral proceedings closed before releasing its award. Second,\nthe plaintiff argues that there was inordinate delay in the release\nof the award because the award was only issued 19 months after the\nparties’ final closing submissions. On the strength of the preceding,\nthe plaintiff submits that the award should be set aside,inter alia, on the basis that there had\nbeen a breach of natural justice. 5       Two\ngeneral issues arise from these facts. The first is the proper construction\nof r 27.1; the second is the applicable time limit, if any, for\nthe release of arbitral awards.",
        "Background facts": "6       The\nplaintiff, Coal & Oil Company LLC (“C&O”), is a company registered\nin Dubai, United Arab Emirates.[note: 1]It is engaged in the business of trading\ncoal. 7       The\ndefendant, GHCL Limited (“GHCL”), is a company registered in the\nRepublic of India. It was, at the material time, a customer of the plaintiff.[note: 2] 8       The\nfacts are not in dispute and lie within a narrow compass. On 26 April\n2007, the plaintiff signed an agreement to supply between 180,000 and\n190,000 Metric Tons (“MT”) of coal to the defendant (“the Agreement”).[note: 3]It\nwas agreed that the coal would be delivered in three to four shipments.\nClause 16 of the Agreement provided that any disputes would be submitted\nto arbitration in Singapore.[note: 4]The plaintiff separately contracted\nwith Noble Resources Pte Ltd (“Noble”) to obtain some of the coal\nit required to fulfil the terms of its contract with the defendant\n(“the Noble Contract”).[note: 5] 9       Between\nApril 2007 and January 2008, the price of coal rose dramatically\nand Noble attempted to re-negotiate the price of coal under the\nNoble Contract. The plaintiff initially resisted this increase as\nit would affect the profitability of its contract with the defendant\nbut Noble was insistent that the price be increased. This triggered\nan exchange of correspondence between the plaintiff and the defendant\nduring which the defendant was informed that the plaintiff would\nnot deliver the third shipment (consisting of 70,000 MT of coal)\nunless a price increase was agreed.[note: 6]By way of an addendum dated\n17 March 2008, the defendant agreed to a price increase of US$18.50\nper MT for the third shipment (“the Addendum”).[note: 7]The\nthird shipment was loaded and paid for on 25 April 2008.[note: 8]However,\non 18 May 2008, the defendant demanded that the plaintiff repay\na sum of US$1,295,888 (the additional sum paid under the Addendum),\narguing that the Addendum was illegal as it had been procured through\ncoercion.[note: 9] 10     The\nplaintiff refused to repay the demanded sum and, pursuant to clause\n16 of the Agreement, the defendant submitted the dispute to arbitration\nin Singapore.[note: 10]The parties agreed, from\nthe outset, that the arbitration would be governed by the 2007 SIAC\nRules.[note: 11]A sole arbitrator (“the Tribunal”)\nwas appointed by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre\n(“the SIAC”). 11     The\nfollowing is a brief chronology of the arbitration:[note: 12] DateEvent22 May 2009GHCL issued a notice of arbitration to C&O14 May 2012 – 17 May 2012Oral hearings conducted before the Tribunal10 July 2012GHCL filed its closing submissions15 July 2012C&O filed its closing submissions15 August 2012GHCL filed its reply submissions17 August 2012C&O filed its reply submissions5 July 2013The SIAC informed parties that the Tribunal was in the process\nof drafting the award.3 September 2013The Tribunal wrote to inform the parties that a draft award\nwas expected to be ready by the end of the month.12 December 2013GHCL wrote to the SIAC requesting for an update on the status\nof the award. On the same day, the SIAC wrote to inform the parties\nthat it had written to the Tribunal on the issue and hoped to receive\na draft award before Christmas.9 January 2014The SIAC wrote to the parties to inform them that it had yet\nto receive the draft award but was in contact with the Tribunal\non the issue.17 January 2014The SIAC wrote to the parties to inform them that it had received\nthe draft award from the Tribunal.14 March 2014The Award was issued.17 March 2014The parties received a copy of the Award via email.   12     In\nits Final Award dated 14 March 2014 (“the Award”), the Tribunal found\nin favour of the defendant and held that the Addendum was vitiated by\nduress and ought to be side aside. The Tribunal awarded the defendant the\nsum of $1,295,888 with interest.[note: 13]The parties received the\nAward on 17 March 2014, one year and seven months after they made\ntheir final reply submissions (on 17 August 2012).",
        "The plaintiff’s application": "13     On\n12 June 2014, the plaintiff filed Originating Summons No 538 of 2014\n(“OS 538/2014”), applying under s 24 of the International Arbitration Act\n(Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”) to set aside the Award on the following\ngrounds:[note: 14] (a)     First,\nunder Art 34(2)(a)(iv) of the UNCITRAL\nModel Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985 (“the Model\nLaw”) as set out in the First Schedule to the IAA in that the issuance\nof the Award was in breach of the parties’ agreed procedure. (b)     Second,\nunder Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model\nLaw in that the Award was in conflict with the public policy of\nSingapore. (c)     Third,\nunder s 24(b) of the IAA in that there was a breach of natural justice. 14     The\nplaintiff also prayed, in the alternative, for a declaration under Art 14(1)\nof the Model Law that the Tribunal’s mandate had been terminated\nprior to 14 March 2014 (the date of the issuance of the Award) by\nreason of the Tribunal’s failure to act without undue delay in declaring the\nproceedings closed and that, therefore, the Award should be set\naside for want of jurisdiction.[note: 15]As\nthe application to terminate the mandate of the arbitrator was filed\nout of time, the plaintiff also sought an extension of time in aid\nof that specific ground of the application.[note: 16] 15     At\nthe hearing on 20 January 2015, Mr Peter Gabriel (“Mr Gabriel”), counsel\nfor the plaintiff, informed me that the plaintiff would not be proceeding\nwith the alternative prayer.[note: 17]I should add that if the plaintiff had pursued the alternative prayer,\nI would not have been minded to grant the extension of time. Order\n69A r 2(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”)\nstipulates that any application to decide on the termination of\nthe tribunal’s mandate must be made “within 30 days from the date\nof receipt by the applicant… of the arbitral tribunal’s decision\nor ruling.” Given that the plaintiff had received the Award on 17\nMarch 2014, the application ought to have been filed by 16 April\n2014. The plaintiff was thus 57 days late in filing the application\non 12 June 2014. No convincing reasons for the delay were put forward\napart from the need to “study the purported Final Award”, “seek\nlegal advice”, and instruct new solicitors.[note: 18]However, I note that\nthe plaintiff was represented by their previous solicitors, M/s\nRajah & Tann LLP, at least until 2 May 2014, which is wellafterthe deadline for the filing of the\napplication had passed.[note: 19]While they were\nrepresented by their previous solicitors, the plaintiff had ample\ntime to study the Award and seek their advice. Therefore, a delay\nof 57 days – nearly twice the length of the time provided for in\nO 69A r 2(3) of the ROC – is inexcusable.",
        "The substantive issues": "16     With\nthat, it remains for me to consider the remaining three grounds set\nout at[13].\nAs noted above at[4],\nall three grounds rest on the same two factual premises, each of\nwhich the plaintiff asserts is a sufficient basis for invoking any\none of the three grounds for setting aside. The first factual premise\nis the Tribunal’s purported failure to comply with r 27.1. The second\nis the 19-month gap of time between the final submissions tendered by\nthe parties and the date of the release of the Award, a lapse of\ntime which the plaintiff terms an “inordinate delay”. 17     It\nis undisputed that the Tribunal only released the Award 19 months after\nthe parties tendered their final written submissions. However, parties disagreed\non whether the Tribunal had been in breach of r 27.1 so that is\nthe issue to which I shall now turn.",
        "Has there been a breach of r 27.1?": "18     Rule 27.1\nreads: 27.1  Before\nissuing any award, the Tribunal shall submit it in draft form to the\nRegistrar. Unless the Registrar extends time or the parties agree otherwise,\ntheTribunal shall submit the draft award to\nthe Registrar within 45 days from the date on which the Tribunal\ndeclares the proceedings closed. The Registrar may suggest\nmodifications as to the form of the award and, without affecting\nthe Tribunal’s liberty of decision, may also draw its attention\nto points of substance. No award shall be issued by the Tribunal until\nit has been approved by the Registrar as to its form. [emphasis\nadded in bold] The parties’ arguments 19     Mr\nGabriel‘s argument may be expressed syllogistically. First, he submits\nthat r 27.1obligesthe Tribunal\nto first declare the proceedings closed before issuing a draft award.\nSecond, he notes that it is common ground that the Tribunal did\nnot declare the proceedings closed before issuing the draft award.\nIn conclusion, he submits, the Tribunal had breached its duty by\nissuing the draft award without first declaring the proceedings\nclosed and the Award must therefore be set aside. 20     It\nis clear that, on the face of r 27.1, the 45-day period only begins\nto run from the date on which the Tribunal declares the proceedings\nclosed. It is also not in dispute that the Tribunal did not declare\nthe proceedings closed. Therefore the key question is whether the\nTribunal isobligedor merelyempoweredto declare the closure of proceedings.\nMr Gabriel concedes that there is nothing on the face of r 27.1\nwhichexpressly requiresthe Tribunal\nto declare the proceedings closed. However, he argues that such\nan obligation may be inferred because the issuance of arbitral award always\ntakes place in two stages: first, the tribunal declares the proceedings closed;\nsecond, the tribunal must submit the draft award to the Registrar\nof the SIAC within 45 days of its declaration. Mr Gabriel submits\nthat because the “second step is amandatory\nstepand is hinged upon the declaration of close of proceedings\nby the Tribunal… the Tribunal as a first stepis required\nto declare the closure of the arbitration proceeding[s]”[note: 20][emphasis added]. 21     Mr\nJoseph Lopez (“Mr Lopez”), counsel for the defendant, submits that\nthere is no express provision in the 2007 SIAC Rules (including\nr 27.1) which imposes any requirement on the Tribunal to declare\nthe proceedings closed. In fact, he submits, the scheme of the 2007\nSIAC Rules provides otherwise. In this connection, he relies on\nr 21.5 of the 2007 SIAC Rules (“r 21.5”) which reads: TheTribunal may declare\nthe hearings closedif it is satisfied that the parties have\nno further evidence to produce or submissions to make. The Tribunal may\non its own motion or upon the application of a party but before\nany award is made, reopen the hearings.” [emphasis added in bold] Mr Lopez submits that the\nexpression “hearings” in r 21.5 is synonymous with the expression\n“proceedings” in r 27.1. Thus, he concludes, the 2007 SIAC Rules\nspecifically confers apower(through\nr 21.5, which is expressed in discretionary terms) and not adutyon the Tribunal to declare the proceedings\nclosed. 22     Mr\nLopez gives two reasons in support of this construction: (a)     First,\nMr Lopez relies on the changes wrought by the passage of the 2010\nSingapore International Arbitration Centre Rules (“2010 SIAC Rules”).\nRule 28.1 of the 2010 SIAC Rules (the successor to r 21.5 of the\n2007 SIAC Rules) provides that that the Tribunal “shall, after\nconsulting with the parties, declare theproceedingsclosedifit is satisfied that the parties have\nno further relevant and material evidence to produce or submission\nto make” [emphasis added]. Rule 28.2 of the 2010 SIAC Rules (the\nsuccessor to r 27.1 of the 2007 SIAC Rules), remains largely unchanged\nand provides that “the Tribunal shall submit the draft award to\nthe Registrar within 45 days from the date on which the Tribunal\ndeclares proceedings closed.” Mr Lopez makes the following observations:\nfirst, the expression “close of hearings” in r 21.5 of the 2007\nSIAC rules has been amended to read “close of proceedings” in r 28.1\nof the 2010 SIAC Rules; second, there is no provision in the 2010\nor 2013 versions of the SIAC Rules which provides for a declaration\nof the closure of the hearings – there is only provision for a declaration\nof the closure of the proceedings; third, the word “may” in r 21.5\nwas replaced with the word “shall” in r 28.1 of the 2010 SIAC Rules.\nMr Lopez infers from the foregoing that the expression “hearings”\nin r 21.5 had always been intended to be read interchangeably with\nthe expression “proceedings” in r 27.1 and submits that the 2010\namendments were made,ex abundanti cautela, to\nmake this clear.[note: 21] (b)     Second,\nMr Lopez drew my attention to Article 3 of Schedule 1 of the 2007\nSIAC Rules, which is entitled “Special Provisions for SIAC Domestic\nArbitration Rules”. Art 3(5) of Schedule 1 of the 2007 SIAC Rules\n(“Art 3(5)”) provides that “a Tribunal’s [summary] award or order\nshall be made in writingwithin 21 days after\nclose of hearingunless extended by the Registrar” [emphasis\nadded]. Mr Lopez notes that Art 3(5) imposes a time limit for the\nrelease of the summary award with reference to theclose\nof hearingsand submits that this demonstrates that,\ninsofar as time limits for the release of awards are concerned,\nthe expressions “close of hearings” and “close of proceedings” are\nsynonymous and are used interchangeably.[note: 22] Does r 27.1 impose a power or\na duty to declare proceedings closed? 23     Rule 27.1\nhas been incorporated into the parties’ contract and must be interpreted\npurposively (seeNCC International AB v Land\nTransport Authority Singapore[2009] 1 SLR(R) 985 at[37](“NCC International”);AQZ\nv ARA[2015] SGHC 49 at [132]) (“AQZ\nv ARA”). Since we are considering the institutional rules\nof an arbitral institution, this entails a consideration of the\ndrafting history of the rules, in a manner akin to an examination\nof the legislative history of an Act of Parliament (seeNCC Internationalat[37]). The drafting history of r 27.1 24     In\ntotal, there have been five different editions of the SIAC Rules (excluding\nthe Domestic Arbitration Rules released in 2001 and 2002), all of which\ncontain provisions which govern the time limit for the release of arbitral\nawards and for the declaration of the closure of hearings/proceedings.\nThese provisions exist in three different permutations. 25     The\nfirst permutation exists in the 1991 and 1997 versions of the SIAC Rules\n(hereinafter, “the 1991 SIAC Rules” and “the 1997 SIAC Rules” respectively).\nRule 21.6 of the 1991 SIAC Rules and r 22.6 of the 1997 SIAC Rules\nare, save for minor differences in wording, identical.  Rule 21.6\nof the 1991 SIAC Rules reads: TheTribunal may declare\nthe hearings closedif the parties have no further proof\nto offer or witnesses to be heard or submissions to make.The Tribunal may on its own motion or upon application\nof a party but before any award is made, reopen the hearings.\n[emphasis added in bold] Rule 27.1 of the 1991 SIAC\nRules and r 28.1 of the 1997 SIAC Rules deal with the time limits\nfor the rendering of awards. Both provisions are also, save for\nminor differences in wording, identical. Rule 27.1 of the 1991 SIAC Rules\nreads: The Tribunal shall make its award in writingwithin forty-five (45) days from the date on which\nthe hearings are closedand, unless all the parties agree otherwise,\nshall state the reasons upon which its award is based. The award shall\nstate its date and shall be signed by the arbitrator or arbitrators. [emphasis\nadded in bold] 26     The\nsecond permutation is found in the 2007 SIAC Rules. Rules 21.5 and\n27.1 of the 2007 SIAC Rules are reproduced here for convenience: 21.5  The\nTribunal may declare the hearings closed if it is satisfied that\nthe parties have no further evidence to produce or submissions to\nmake. The Tribunal may on its own motion or upon the application\nof a party but before any award is made, reopen the hearings. [emphasis\nin bold] … 27.1  Before\nissuing any award, the Tribunal shall submit it in draft form to the\nRegistrar. Unless the Registrar extends time or the parties agree otherwise,\ntheTribunal shall submit the draft award to\nthe Registrar within 45 days from the date on which the Tribunal\ndeclares the proceedings closed. The Registrar may suggest\nmodifications as to the form of the award and, without affecting\nthe Tribunal’s liberty of decision, may also draw its attention\nto points of substance. No award shall be issued by the Tribunal until\nit has been approved by the Registrar as to its form. [emphasis\nadded in bold] 27     The\nthird permutation may be found in the 2010 SIAC Rules and the 2013\nversion of the SIAC Rules (“the 2013 SIAC Rules”). Rules 28.1 and 28.2\nof the 2010 SIAC Rules are identical to rr 28.1 and 28.2 of the\n2013 SIAC Rules. Rules 28.1 and 28.2 of the 2010 SIAC Rules read: 28.1  The\nTribunal shall, after consulting with the parties, declare the proceedings\nclosed if it is satisfied that the parties have no further relevant and\nmaterial evidence to produce or submission to make. The Tribunal\nmay, on its own motion or upon application of a party but before\nany award is made, reopen the proceedings. 28.2  Before issuing any award, the Tribunal\nshall submit it in draft form to the Registrar. Unless the Registrar\nextends time or the parties agree otherwise, theTribunal\nshall submit the draft award to the Registrar within 45 days from\nthe date on which the Tribunal declares the proceedings closed.\nThe Registrar may, as soon as practicable, suggest modifications\nas to the form of the award and, without affecting the Tribunal's\nliberty of decision, may also draw its attention to points of substance.\nNo award shall be issued by the Tribunal until it has been approved\nby the Registrar as to its form. [emphasis added in bold] 28     When\nthe history of the SIAC Rules is examined, a clear trajectory may\nbe discerned: there has been a gradual shift towards the imposition\nof stricter timelines for the release of arbitral awards through\na decrease in tribunal autonomy and a concomitant increase in the\nsupervisory role of the Registrar and the parties. Under the 1991\nand 1997 of the SIAC Rules, the release of the award was entirely\nwithin the control of the tribunal. This is because the 45-day period\nbegins to runif and only ifthe\ntribunal elects to declare the closure of hearings which it may,\non its own motion or on the application of one of the parties, reopen.\nFurther, the 45-day time limit may be extended by the tribunal on\nits own motion (see r 24.1(e) of the 1991 SIAC Rules and r 25(e)\nof the 1997 SIAC Rules, which grant the tribunal the general power\nto extend or abbreviate any time limits provided in the rules of\nits own motion, subject only to the caveat that it must afford the\nparties an opportunity to state their views). By contrast, under\nthe 2010 and the 2013 versions of the SIAC Rules, the reckoning\nof time begins to run when the tribunal declares a closure of proceedings,\nwhich it isobligedto doif, after consulting with the parties,\nit is of the view that the parties have no further evidence or submissions\nto present. This declaration triggers the start of a 45-day window\nwithin which the tribunal has to render its draft award. This time\nlimit may not be unilaterally extended by the tribunal. This is\nbecause, since the 2007 SIAC Rules, the general power of the tribunal\nto extend time limits has been expressly qualified by the proviso that\nthis power does not cover extensions of time limits for the release\nof the award (see r 24(d) of the 2007 SIAC Rules and r 24(c) of\nthe 2010/2013 SIAC Rules). Under the 2010 SIAC Rules, the 45-day\ntime limit may only be extended by the Registrar or by the agreement\nof the parties. 29     Any\nconstruction of the 2007 SIAC Rules must reflect its place in the historical\ndevelopment of the SIAC Rules, bearing in mind the careful balance\nthe drafters wanted to strike between tribunal autonomy (in the conduct\nof the arbitration) and institutional oversight (through the supervisory\nrole of the Registrar): see generally Sabiha Shiraz, “The New SIAC\nRules 2007” [2007] 4 Sinarb 2 at p 3. 30     The\n2007 SIAC Rules is unique in that it is the only iteration of the rules\nwhich specificallyempowersthe\ntribunal to declare a closure ofhearingsbut\nimposes a timeline for the release of the award with reference to\na closure ofproceedings. To elaborate: (a)     The\n1991 and 1997 versions of the SIAC Rules give the tribunal apower but not a dutyto declarehearingsclosed. Following a declaration\nof the closure ofhearings, a tribunal\nhas an obligation to render a draft Award within 45 days. The 1991/1997\nSIAC Rules did not contemplate a declaration of the closure ofproceedings. (b)     The\n2010 and 2013 versions of the SIAC Rules impose adutyon the\nTribunal to declareproceedingsclosed\nif, after consulting with the parties, it is satisfied that they\nhave no further evidence or submissions to present. Following a\ndeclaration of the closure ofproceedings,\na tribunal has an obligation to render a draft Award within 45 days.\nThe 2010/2013 SIAC Rules do not refer to the closure ofhearings. 31     The\nkey question is therefore whether the 2007 SIAC Rules, being silent\non the issue, ought to be construed as imposing adutyon\nthe tribunal to declare proceedings closed (as Mr Gabriel has suggested)\nor whether it should be construed as conferring a mere power. I\nam of the view that the latter construction is preferable for four\nreasons. 32     First,\nthe former construction would not be consonant with the drafting\nhistory of the rules. Under the 2010 and 2013 SIAC Rules, the tribunal’s\nduty to issue a declaration of the closure of proceedings only arises\nonce it has (a) consulted the parties; and (b)personally\nformed a viewthat the parties have no further evidence\nto tender or submissions to make. However, there is nothing in the\n2010 or 2013 versions of the SIAC Rules which suggest that the tribunal\nhas a duty to consult parties on this issue to begin with. Therefore,\nunder the 2010/2013 SIAC Rules, it is entirely possible that the\nproceedings may never be declared closed. This situation would arise\nif (a) there were no consultation between the tribunal and the parties\nas to whether the latter has any further evidence to tender or submissions\nto make; and/or (b) if the tribunal does not form the view (following\nsuch consultation) that the parties have no further relevant material\nevidence to produce or submissions to make. The plaintiff’s construction\nof r 27.1, if accepted, would mean that the 2007 SIAC Rules are\neven stricter than its successor since it would impose anunqualifiedobligation to issue a declaration\nof closure without the duty to first consult with the parties and\nthe duty to, after such consultation, be subjectively satisfied\nthat parties do not have further evidence or submissions to present. 33     The\nplaintiff’s construction is not only impractical (since the parties are\nclearly the ones who are best placed to advise the tribunal if they\nhave further material to present), it would also give rise to difficulties.\nIt would be unsafe to impose a duty on tribunals to issue a declaration\nof closure of the proceedings without a predicate duty of prior\nconsultation with the parties (which is present in the 2010/2013\nSIAC Rules). Imposing an unqualified duty to issue a declaration\nof closure might encourage hasty tribunals to close proceedings\nprematurely, opening awards to collateral attacks on the basis that\nthe rules of natural justice have been violated. An aggrieved party\nmight be encouraged to apply to set aside an award on the basis\nthat proceedings had been closed prematurely, thereby denying him an\nadequate opportunity to present his case. This concern is not new. Rule 21.6\nof the 1991 SIAC Rules (the predecessor of r 21.5 of the 2007 SIAC\nRules) appears to have been derived from Art 29 of the United Nations\nCommission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules 1976,UN General Assembly Resolution 31/98,\n(UN Doc. A/RES/31/98, 15 December 1976) (“UNCITRAL\nRules 1976”). Article 29 of the UNCITRAL Rules 1976 reads,\n“[t]he arbitral tribunal may inquire of the parties if they have\nany further proof to offer or witnesses to be heard or submissions\nto make and, if there are none, it may declare the hearings closed.”\nAt its Ninth Session, the Committee of the United Nations Commission\non International Trade Law (“the UNCITRAL Committee”) was fully cognisant\nof the danger that aggrieved parties might apply to set awards aside\non the basis that they had been denied an opportunity to present\ntheir case because of the premature closure of the hearings. That\nwas why the representatives in the UNCITRAL Committee drafted Art\n29 carefully to require tribunals to consult the parties in the\narbitrationbeforeexercising its\npower to declare hearings closed: seeSummary\nRecord of the 16thMeeting of the United\nNations Commission on International Trade Law, Ninth Session (A/CN.9/9/C.2/SR.16,\n26 April 1976) at paras 83 to 85. 34     Second,\nthe plaintiff’s construction is also not consonant with theraison d'êtreof r 27.1. In my view, the\ndeclaration of closure functions as a case-management tool. As explained\nby Mark Mangan, Lucy Reed and John Choong in their book,A Guide to the SIAC Arbitration Rules(Oxford University\nPress, 2014) (“A Guide to the SIAC Arbitration\nRules”), at para 12.11: [t]he closure of the proceedings [as provided\nfor in r 28.1 of the 2010/2013 SIAC Rules] prevents an endless stream\nof submissions or new documents from the parties. It also signals\nto the parties (and the Secretariat) that they can expect to receive\nthe award in relatively short order.In practice,\ntribunals will usually only declare the proceedings closed when\nthe drafting of the award is well advanced or is expected to be\ncompleted within 45 days, as requiredby Rule 28.2. [emphasis\nadded in italics] It follows that the declaration\nof closure of proceedings is essentially a tool for case-management.\nIt serves two main purposes. First, it benefits the tribunal by\npreventing the drafting process from being derailed by last-minute\nsubmissions from parties. Second, it serves as a signal to parties\nthat the arbitral process is coming to an end and that a final disposition\nof their legal rights is forthcoming. 35     The\nplaintiff’s argument, if accepted, would elevate a case-management\ntool into a condition precedent for the release of the award. To\nmy mind, imposing adutyon the\ntribunal to declare proceedings closed is inconsistent with the\ncase-management function of a declaration of closure. Tribunals\nhave wide powers of case management (seeSoh\nBeng Tee & Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd[2007]\n3 SLR(R) 86 (“Soh Beng Tee”) at[60];TMM Divisionat [115]). This is particularly\nso for parties who elect to arbitrate in Singapore under the SIAC\nRules, which grant tribunals wide and flexible case-management powers\n(seeADG v ADIat [111]). To impose\na duty of declaration would effectively limit a tribunal’s freedom\nof action, which is the very opposite of what case-management powers\nare intended for. 36     Third,\nthe plaintiff’s construction is not commercially sensible. The plaintiff\nis unable to provide any satisfactory explanationwhythe declaration\nof closure is normatively important enough to the arbitration process\nthat such a duty should be imposed. The plaintiff’s submission that the\ndeclaration of closure is “a fundamental requirement as per the agreement\nof the parties”[note: 23]is question-begging.\nAs the plaintiff acknowledges, r 27.1 is silent as to whether the\nTribunal has adutyor a merepowerto issue a declaration of closure\nof proceedings so the plaintiff bears the burden of proving why\nthe former construction is more commercially sensible and is to\nbe preferred. It is difficult to understand why the drafters of\nthe SIAC Rules, being mindful of the need to avoid impeding the\narbitration process with pointless formalities, would require arbitral\ntribunals to first declare proceedings closed before issuing an award. 37     It\nis also telling that the plaintiff is unable to provide a definitive answer\non when the Tribunal’s obligation to issue a declaration of closure arose\nin this case. In its written submissions, it identified five possible\ndates when the Tribunal ought to have declared hearings closed:\n(a) 17 August 2012 (the date the plaintiff filed its final reply\nsubmissions); (b) 5 July 2013 (when the SIAC informed the parties\nthat the Tribunal was in the process of drafting the award); (c)\n15 August 2013 (45 days before 30 September 2013, the first expected\ncompletion date of the award); (d) 10 November 2013 (45 days before\n25 December 2013, the revised expected completion date for the award);\nand (e) 3 December 2013 (45 days before 17 January 2014, when the Registrar\nwas said to have received the draft of the Award).[note: 24]During the oral\nhearings, Mr Gabriel could only offer the tentative response that\nthe declaration ought to have been made within a reasonable time.\nWhen pressed, he eventually submitted that the Tribunal ought to\nhave declared the proceedings closed either on 3 December 2013 (45\ndays before 17 January 2014, when the draft award was received by\nthe SIAC) or 45 daysafter17 January\n2014.[note: 25] 38     In\nmy view, the plaintiff’s inconclusive and unsettled position on\nthis issue just reinforces my point that the central difficulty\nwith the plaintiff’s submission is that there just does not seem\nto be any compelling reasonwhythe\nrequirement of a declaration of closure is so critical. The plaintiff\nis asserting the existence of an arid procedural requirement that\ndoes not add anything substantive to the arbitration process. I\ndo not think the drafters of the 2007 SIAC Rules would have intended\nsuch a result. This is usefully contrasted with the requirement\n(also found in r 27.1) that any award must first be approved by\nthe Registrar before it can be released. That requirement serves\nan integral function by allowing the Registrar to maintain the quality\nof awards released under the auspices of the SIAC (seeA Guide to the SIAC Arbitration Rulesat\nparas 12.12–12.19). 39     Fourth,\nthe former construction would render r 21.5 superfluous. Even assuming\nthat – in the specific context of rr 21.5 and 27.1 – “hearings” and\n“proceedings” refer to different events (which, as I will elaborate\nlater at[40]–[43], is not the\ncase), the point is that “proceedings” generally encompass “hearings.”\nThus, if proceedings are closed, hearings, being a subset of proceedings,\nmust surely be closed as well. If a tribunal already has adutyto close proceedings under r 27.1\n(thereby closing hearings in the process), r 21.5 would be rendered\notiose since tribunals would never have need to exercise itspowerto close hearings if they are already\nduty bound to declare closure of proceedings. Mr Gabriel has not\nprovided any explanation as to why there would be a need for tribunals\nto separately have thepowerto\nclose hearings in juxtaposition with adutyto\nclose proceedings. Hypothetically, one might suggest that “hearings”\nrefers only to an event for the making of oral submissions and the\ntaking of oral evidence. On this theory, a tribunal might wish,\nin declaring hearings closed, to signal that it does not wish to\nhear further oral arguments but is still open to receiving written\nsubmissions. However, there is nothing in the 2007 SIAC Rules which\nexplicitly states that the expression “hearings” bears this restricted\nmeaning. Are hearings and proceedings\nsynonymous? 40     Having\ndecided that r 27.1 does not impose any duty on the Tribunal to\ndeclare the closure of the proceedings, it is strictly not necessary\nto consider Mr Lopez’s additional argument (which is premised on\nr 21.5) as alluded to at[22]above.\nHowever, given the parties’ submissions on this issue, I will go\non to make some observations on this subject though I should add\nthat acceptance of the argument would merely provide an additional\nreason to conclude that r 27.1 confers a power and not a duty on tribunals\nto declare the closure of proceedings. However, the converse is not\ntrue in that should the argument not find favour with me, it does\nnot in itself establish that r 27.1 imposes a duty, and not a power,\non tribunals to declare the closure of the proceedings. It would\nstill not address the absence of any express provision in the 2007\nSIAC Rules which imposes a duty on tribunal to declare the closure\nof proceedings. 41     For\nthe purposes of examining Mr Lopez’s argument, it is not essential\nto find that the expressions “hearings” and “proceedings” are used synonymouslythroughoutthe 2007 SIAC Rules. Semantically\nspeaking, these two expressions can bear different meanings, particularly\nwhere the context demands it. For example, r 21.3 of the 2007 SIAC\nRules reads, “[i]f any party to theproceedingsfails\nto appear at ahearingwithout showing sufficient\ncause for such failure, the Tribunal may proceed with the arbitration\nand may make the award based on the submissions and evidence before\nit” [emphasis added]. In this context, the expression “proceedings”\nseems to refer to the arbitration as a whole whereas “hearings”\nrefers only to a physical meeting in which oral evidence is taken and\noral submissions are made. 42     Therefore,\ncontext is key. The relevant inquiry is whether “hearings”in r 21.5is intended to have a different\nmeaning to “proceedings”in r 27.1. Such\nan inquiry is best aided by examining the evolution of the relevant rules\nthrough the different iterations of the SIAC Rules. 43     It\nis clear from the drafting history of rr 21.5 and 27.1 and their equivalents\n(see[24]–[31]above) that\nthe only version which does not use the same expression consistently\nin both rules is the 2007 SIAC Rules. The 1991/1997 versions use\nthe same expression “hearings” in both rules while the 2010/2013\nversions use the expression “proceedings”. In other words, the equivalent\nof rr 21.5 and 27.1 in the 1991/1997 SIAC Rules refer to the same\nevent – the close of hearings; similarly, the equivalent of rr 21.5\nand 27.1 in the 2010/2013 SIAC Rules refer to the same event – the\nclose of proceedings. The question is whether a distinction was\nintended to be made between the expression “hearings” and “proceedings”\nin rr 21.5 and 27.1 of the 2007 SIAC Rules. No logical reasons have\nbeen offered for any distinction and I think none exist (see also[39]above). In\nmy view, purposively construed, the expressions “hearings” and “proceedings”\nare, in the context of rr 21.5 and 27.1, synonymous. I also note\nthat, in the 2010/2013 SIAC Rules, the provision granting the Tribunal\nthe power to close proceedings (r 28.1, the successor to r 21.5\nof the 2007 SIAC Rules) can now be found immediately before the\nprovision providing for the 45-day time limit for the release of\nthe award (r 28.2, the successor to r 27.1 of the 2007 SIAC Rules).\nThe consolidation of these two provisions in the same rule gives\nme further reason to believe that it was always intended that both\nprovisions would refer to the same event. 44     However,\nwith that being said, I do not think that Mr Lopez’s argument based\non Art 3(5) (see [22(b)] above) is convincing. Art 3(5) provides\nthat a summary award issued under Schedule 1 of the 2007 SIAC Rules\nhas to be submitted within 21 days of the “close of hearing”. Mr\nLopez submits that the fact that Art 3(5) provides that a tribunal\nis to issue its award within 21 days of the close of hearing is\nfurther evidence that the time limit for the issuance of an arbitral\nawards is measured by reference to the close of hearings and not\nproceedings. I do not agree. As Mr Gabriel pointed out, Art 3(5)\nmust be read in context. Article 3 governs the issuance of a summary\naward indomestic arbitrationsconducted\nunder the 2007 SIAC Rules, and not international arbitrations, which\nis the case on our facts. It specifically provides for a special\nhearing before the summary award is made. In this context, the reference\nto “hearing” in Art 3(5) is a reference to theoral\nhearing in respect of an application for summary judgment.\nThe purpose of the rule is to ensure that all such applications\nfor summary awards are swiftly disposed of (within 21 days of the\nend of the special oral hearing). Article 3(5) cannot be used to\nsupport a general point about time limits for the release of awards\nin arbitrations. 45     Furthermore,\nit is also clear from a review of all the editions of the SIAC Rules\n– be it the 1991, 1997, 2007, 2010, or the 2013 versions – that none\nof them impose an unqualified duty to declare the closure of hearings or\nproceedings. The 2010/2013 SIAC Rules come the closest. But even\nthen, the obligation to declare a closure of the proceedings is\nsubject to two conditions precedent as explained at[32]above. If this\ninterpretation is right (and no other satisfactory reason has been\noffered to persuade me otherwise), then it must support the defendant’s\nconstruction that the Tribunal indeed has thepowerand\nnot adutyto declare the closure\nof theproceedings. 46     In\nconclusion, I hold that, on a true construction of r 27.1, the Tribunal\nhad thepowerand not adutyto declare the proceedings closed before\nreleasing the Award. Thus, the Tribunal was not in breach of r 27.1 in\nthis case when it elected – as it was entitled to under the wide\ncase-management powers it is afforded under the 2007 SIAC Rules\n– not to issue to issue a declaration of closure of the proceedings\nbefore releasing the Award",
        "The grounds for setting aside": "47     Given\nmy finding that there was no breach of r 27.1, I need only consider\nwhether the remaining factual premise –viz,\nthe interval of 19 months from the date of the parties’ final submissions\nand the release of the Award – justifies the setting aside of the\nAward on the three grounds invoked. However, for completeness, I\nshall consider each of the three grounds with reference to both\nthe r 27.1 issue as well as the delay issue to demonstrate that\na breach of r 27.1 would not, in any event, have justified the setting\naside of the Award. Breach of agreed procedure 48     Article\n34(2)(a)(iv) of the Model Law provides\nthat “an arbitral awardmaybe set\naside” [emphasis added] if proof is furnished that the arbitral procedure\nleading up to the issuance of the award was not in accordance with\nthe agreement of the parties. As a preliminary point, I observe\nthat the court retains a discretionnotto\nset an award aside even if one of the prescribed grounds for setting\naside has been made out (seeCRW Joint Operation\nv PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK[2011] 4 SLR\n305 (“CRW (CA)”) at [100]). This\nreflects the plain language of Art 34(2) of the Model Law, which\nstates that a court “may” set an award aside if one of the stated\ngrounds is present, not that it has to. 49     As\nstated by Belinda Ang Saw Ean J at[54]ofTriulzi: … It cannot be the case that any breach\nof an agreed arbitral procedure, even that of a technical provision\nor minor formality, will invariably result in an award being set\naside. Most supervising courts inquire into thematerialityof the\nprocedural requirements that were not complied with and the nature\nof the departures from the parties’ agreed arbitral procedure …\n[emphasis in original] 50     I\nnote that different jurisdictions have taken different approaches\nto this inquiry. Some have elected to cast this inquiry in terms\nof the “seriousness of the breach” (see the observations of the\nHong Kong Court of Appeal inGrand Pacific\nHoldings Ltd v Pacific China Holdings Ltd (in liq) (No 1)[2012]\n4 HKLRD 1 at [105]). Other jurisdictions require proof of “substantial\nprejudice”: seeKaraha Bodas Company, LLC v\nPerusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara190\nF Supp 2d 936 (SD Tex, 2001) where (in considering an application\nto set aside an arbitral award under the New York Convention on\nthe basis that there had been a departure from the agreed arbitral\nprocedure) the court held, at 945, that the applicant “must show\nthat… the violation actually caused [that party] substantial prejudice”.\nIn the United Kingdom, s 68 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK)\n(“UK Arbitration Act”) permits challenges to an award on the basis\nthat the tribunal had failed to conduct the proceedings in accordance\nwith the procedure agreed by the parties, provided this failure “has\ncaused or will causesubstantial injusticeto\nthe applicant” (s 68(2) UK Arbitration Act) [emphasis added]. 51     At\nthe end of the day, I agree with Belinda Ang J (see[65]ofTriulzi) that this inquiry is necessarily\nfact-specific. The key is that the procedural breach complained\ncannot be of an arid, technical, or trifling nature; rather, it\nmust be a material breach of procedure serious enough that it justifies\nthe exercise of the court’s discretion to set aside the award. This\nwill often, though not invariably, require proof of actual prejudice\n(ie, where the procedural breach\ncomplained of could reasonably have said to have altered the final\noutcome of the arbitral proceedings in some meaningful way): seeTriulziat[66];AQZ v\nARAat [136]. 52     In\nmy view, a failure to issue a declaration of the closure of proceedings\nwould not satisfy the test. The plaintiff’s complaint is precisely the\nsort of arid procedural objection that would not occasion the setting aside\nof an award. It is important to note that the plaintiff isnotarguing that proceedings ought to\nhave been declared closed at any particular point in time. Rather,\nits submission is simply that the tribunal ought to have declared\nproceedings closed before releasing a draft award (whenever that might\nhave been) and that a failure to do so “cannot be remedied” by the court.\nIn short, the plaintiff asserts that it is an incurable defect.\nAs I have noted above at[36]–[38], my difficulty\nwith this submission is that the plaintiff has not shownwhythe event of a declaration of closure\nis of such critical importance such that non-compliance justifies\nthe setting aside of the award. 53     In\nits submissions, the plaintiff relies on the decision of this court\ninTing Kang Chung John v Teo Hee Lai Building\nConstructions Pte Ltd[2010] 2 SLR 625 (“John\nTing”).John Tingconcerned\nan arbitration carried out under the Singapore Institute of Architects\nArbitration Rules 1999 (“SIA Arbitration Rules”). Under Art 14.1\nof the SIA Arbitration Rules, an award has to be released within\n60 days of the “close of hearing”. However, the award was only released\non 15 April 2005 – one year and four months after the hearings had\nclosed. The defendant inJohn Tingapplied\nto set the award aside on the basis that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction\nto issue the award while the arbitrator applied for apost hocextension of time to render the\naward under s 15 of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed). Quentin Loh JC\n(as he then was) held, at[32],\nthat the arbitrator’s failure to adhere to the agreed time limit\nmeant that the award was issued without jurisdiction and was therefore\nvoid and of no effect. The plaintiff in the instant case argues,\nby analogy withJohn Ting, that\nthe failure of the Tribunal to first declare the proceedings closed\nmeant that the subsequent issuance of the Award was made without\njurisdiction and should therefore be declared void and set aside.[note: 26] 54     However,\nI do not think thatJohn Tingassists\nthe plaintiff. The trueratioofJohn Tingis that the mandate of an arbitrator\nexpires after the time limit for the release of an award has expired.\nThus, any award issued after that is issued without jurisdiction.\nThis is made clear by the following extract from[32]ofJohn Ting: TheArbitrator’s error\nin overlooking a time limit within which to issue his award was\na very serious error… Alan Redfern and Martin Hunter\nwith Nigel Blackaby and Constantine PartasidesLaw\nand Practice of International Commercial Arbitration(Sweet\n& Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2004) warns at para 8-66: A limit may be imposed as to the time within\nwhich the arbitral tribunal must make its award.When\nthis limit is reached, the authority or mandate of the arbitral\ntribunal is at an endand it no\nlonger has jurisdiction to make a valid award…. … I am of the view that the statement inLaw and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration,\nquoted above, is the correct analysis. [emphasis in original in bold italics;\nemphasis added in bold] 55     The\nholding inJohn Tingis confined\nonly to breaches of agreed time limits for the issuance of the award\nbecause such breaches have critical implications on themandateof the tribunal.John\nTingdoes not stand for the general proposition that\nthe failure to comply withanyprocedural requirementipso factomeans that an award is issued\nwithout jurisdiction and, without more, should be set aside. I should\nalso point out that the defendant inJohn Tingactually\nwrote to the tribunal on 7 April 2004 (long before the award was\nreleased) expressing the view that the time limit for the making\nof the award had already expired. Notwithstanding this letter, the\narbitrator inJohn Tingdid not\nreply and only wrote to the parties one year later, on 15 April\n2005, stating that the award was ready for collection. 56     As\nregards the delay issue, the 2007 SIAC Rules do not provide for any\ntime limits for the release of arbitral awards apart from that contained in\nr 27.1 and Art 3(5) of Schedule 1 (which only applies to domestic arbitrations).\nAs noted at[20]above,\nthe 45-day time limit provided under r 27.1 does not begin to run\nuntil the Tribunal declares the proceedings closed, which it did\nnot do in this case. Given this, the assertion that the Award was\nrendered out of time (and therefore in breach of the parties’ agreed\nprocedure) simply cannot stand. 57     If\none looks at the institutional rules of other arbitral institutions,\nit is clear that time limits, where they exist, are expressed in\nvery clear terms. To take two examples, Art 24(1) of the International\nChamber of Commerce Arbitration Rules 1998 (“1998 ICC Rules”) states: Thetime limit within\nwhich the Arbitral Tribunal must render its final Award is six months.\nSuch time limit shall start to run from the date of the last signature\nby the Arbitral Tribunal or by the parties of the Terms of Referenceor,\nin the case of application of Article 18(3), the date of the notification\nto the Arbitral Tribunal by the Secretariat of the approval of the Terms\nof Reference by the Court. [emphasis added in bold] Rule 46 of the International\nCentre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes Rules 2006 (“2006\nICSID Rules”) provides: The award (including\nany individual or dissenting opinion) shall be drawn up and signed\nwithin 120 days after closure of the proceeding.The\nTribunal may, however, extend this period by a further 60 days if\nit would otherwise be unable to draw up the award. [emphasis added in bold] 58     It\nalso bears mention that, when the 2007 SIAC Rules were issued, only\nthe rules of three major arbitral institutions provided for mandatory time\nlimits for the release of awards: the 1998 ICC Rules, the 2006 ICSID Rules,\nand the London Maritime Arbitrators Association Terms 2006 (“2006\nLMAA Rules”). This was in keeping with the prevailing wisdom at that\ntime that it was preferable not to prescribe a time limit for the\nrelease of an award for it merely gives intransigent parties an\nopportunity to frustrate the arbitration through the use of delaying\ntactics until compliance with the time limit becomes impossible\n(see Alan Redfern, Martin Hunter, Nigel Blackaby and Constantine\nPartasides,Law and Practice of International Commercial\nArbitration(Sweet & Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2004) at para\n8-68)). In fact, as recently as in 2012, Professor Gary B. Born\nwas able to comment that most institutional rules do not contain\ntime limits for the release of arbitral awards and that those which\ndo, such as the 1998 ICC Rules and the 2006 LMAA Rules, formed the\nexception rather than the rule (see Gary B. Born,International\nArbitration: Law and Practice(Kluwer Law International,\n2012) at p 292). 59     Since\n2012, however, many arbitral institutions have updated their rules\nand, in the latest round of updates, more institutions have introduced time\nlimits for the release of awards where none existed previously.\nSome notable examples include the American Arbitration Association\n– International Commercial Dispute Resolution Arbitration Rules\n2014, which provides that an award is to be released no later than\n60 days from the closing of the hearing and the Japan Commercial\nArbitration Association Rules 2014, which provides that an award\nshall be made within three months of the appointment of the arbitrator.\nThis is a relatively recent phenomenon. However, what is clear is\nthat in each of the arbitral institutions where time limit is imposed,\nsuch time limits are expressly prescribed by its arbitral rules. 60     In\nsummary, the issuance of the Award is not tainted by the breach\nof any procedure agreed upon by the parties under the 2007 SIAC\nRules. Public policy 61     Article\n34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Law provides\nthat an award may be set aside if it is in conflict with public\npolicy. InPT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero)\nv Dexia Bank SA[2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 (“PT\nAsuransi”) at[59],\nthe Court of Appeal made it clear that it is only in exceptional\ncases where the “upholding of an arbitral award would‘shock the conscience’ …, or is ‘clearly injurious to the public good’or\n… ‘wholly offensiveto the ordinary reasonable\nand fully informed member of the public’ …, or where itviolates the forum’s most basic notion of morality\nand justice” [emphasis added] that it would be set aside\non the grounds of public policy. However, despite the very high\nthreshold that has been set, public policy, together with the rules of\nnatural justice, still appear to be the last refuge of the desperate,\nas far as applications to set aside arbitral awards are concerned.\nThis case is no exception. 62     The\nplaintiff argues that “an act of the arbitral Tribunal which is contrary\nto the agreement of the parties [ie,\nr 27.1] is against the public policy of Singapore… [and] must ‘shock\nthe conscience’ or is ‘clearly injurious to the public good’ or\n[is] ‘wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed\nmember of the public’ or ‘violates the forum’s most basic notion\nof morality and justice.’”[note: 27]To put it\nmildly, there is more than a bit of hyperbole in that statement.\nIn essence, the plaintiff’s submission is that all breaches of agreed\nprocedure are,ipso facto, contrary\nto public policy. This argument is deeply flawed because it completely\nignores whatpublic policyis intended\nto capture: matters ofgeneral–\nrather than particular – interest. The procedural breach complained\nof is one that governs only the conduct of the arbitrationinter seand does not have wider public\nramifications. I do not see how this is an issue which engages the\ninterests of the wider community or one which rises to the level\nof gravity that the notion of “public policy” contemplates. 63     The\nplaintiff also argues that “Singapore’s public policy demands that any\narbitration and its award are presented in a fair and expeditious manner”\nand that the delay of 19 months in this case constitutes a violation of\npublic policy. With respect, the plaintiff’s argument is misconceived.\nIt trades on a conflation of the concept ofpublic\ninterestwith that ofpublic policy.\nThe public interest is the wider concept. It embraces everything\nthat is conducive to the public good ranging from the comparatively\nminor (clean streets) to the vital (a robust criminal justice system).\nAn innumerable number of things could be described as not being\nin the public interest. However, the concept of “public policy”\nin the context of the setting aside of an arbitral award, as noted\nat[61]above,\nis much narrower. Violations of “public policy” only encompass those\nacts which are so egregious that elementary notions of morality\nhave been transgressed. While delay in the release of an arbitral\naward might not necessarily be in the public interest, it cannot,\nin itself without more, constitute a violation of public policy. 64     InHong Huat Development Co (Pte) Ltd v Hiap Hong &\nCo Pte Ltd[2000] 1 SLR(R) 510 (“Hong\nHuat”), the court had to consider whether an arbitral\naward that was released more than ten years after the hearings had concluded\nshould be set aside. The Court of Appeal held that the delay, while\n“grossly inordinate” and apt to “undermine faith in arbitration”,\nwas not,per se, a sufficient basis\nfor setting aside an award which had already been rendered (seeHong Huatat[57]). The Court of Appeal observed\nthat the aggrieved party ought to have taken action – prior to the\nissuance of the award – to remove the arbitrator pursuant to s 18\nof the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed). Having elected not\nto do anything, it had to live by its decision. 65     If\na ten year gap between the end of the hearings and the release of\nthe award was not a sufficient basis for setting aside an award\nthen,a fortiori, a 19-month delay\ncannot be a sufficient basis for setting aside the award. If the\ndelay were truly intolerable, the plaintiff ought to have applied\nunder Art 14 of the Model Law for the mandate of the arbitrator\nto be terminatedbeforethe Award\nwas released. However, it did not do so. It is only making the argument\nnow because the Award that was issued was adverse to the plaintiff\nand not because of any delay. As bluntly observed by the court inHong Huatat[57], an application at this late\nstage “smacks of the [plaintiffs]… saying, set it aside because\nit is not in our favour.” Natural justice 66     InSoh Beng Tee, the Court of Appeal held\nat[29]that\na party seeking to set aside an arbitral award as having contravened\nthe rules of natural justice has to show the following: (a)which\nrule of natural justice was breached;(b)how it was breached;(c)in what way the breach was connected\nto the making of the award; and(d)how the breach prejudiced its rights.67     As\nnoted inSoh Beng Teeat[43], the rules\nof natural justice are encapsulated in the two Latin maximsaudi alteram partemandnemo\njudex in causa sua. The former guarantees the right to\nbe heard while the latter provides that adjudicators must be unbiased\nand disinterested. The plaintiff argues that “[t]he failure to declare\nthe closure of the arbitral proceeding [sic] coupled with the inordinate\ndelay in submitting the draft Final Award to the SIAC are obvious\nprocedural irregularities. As a result, the arbitration proceeding\nwas unnecessarily delayed and prolonged.” During the oral hearing\nbefore me, Mr Gabriel cited the decision of the Court of Appeal\ninLW Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San\nContractors Pte Ltd and another appeal[2013] 1 SLR 125\n(“LW Infrastructure”) and argued\nthat the Tribunal ought to have invited parties to submit on its\nfailure to comply with r 27.1 before issuing the award. Mr Gabriel\nsubmitted that the Tribunal’s failure to invite submissions to address\nthe r 27.1 issue was tantamount to a denial of the plaintiff’s right\nto be heard.[note: 28]68     I\nhave difficulty following Mr Gabriel’s argument. The gist of his submission\nis that the plaintiff had not been given the chance –beforethe award was issued – to submit\nthat the award should not be issued. However, the problem with this\nsubmission is that before the Award was released, there could not,\nby definition, have been any breach of r 27.1. Furthermore, the\nTribunal had no reason to believe, at the time it issued the Award,\nthat there was anything procedurally improper over which it ought\nto have invited submissions. The plaintiff seems to be suggesting\nthat every tribunal should always, prior to releasing an award,\ninvite submissions on why the award should not be released. This\nsuggested practice – of inviting prophylactic submissions to forestall\ncriticisms of a breach of natural justice – is seriously misconceived.69     The\ncase ofLW Infrastructuredoes not\nassist the plaintiff.LW Infrastructureconcerned\na domestic arbitration over a dispute arising from a construction\ncontract. The Arbitrator, having found for the defendant, awarded\npost-award interest on the judgment sum. The defendant then wrote\nto the tribunal to seek a supplemental award for pre-award interest\nas well. This request was made pursuant to s 43(4) of the Arbitration\nAct (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“s 43(4)”) which states that “a party may,\nwithin 30 days of receipt of the award andupon\nnotice to the other party, request the arbitral tribunal\nto make an additional award as to claims presented during the arbitration\nproceedings but omitted from the award” [emphasis added]. The tribunal\ndid so three days later by issuing a supplemental award ordering\nthat a further sum of S$274,114.61 (representing pre-award interest)\nbe paid. The plaintiff protested immediately and applied to set\naside the award on the basis that there had been a breach of natural\njustice since it had not been given an opportunity to be heard on\nthe applicability of s 43(4). The Court of Appeal, in accepting\nthis argument and setting aside the award, held that the phrase “upon\nnotice to the other party” in s 43(4) encompassed within it the requirement\nthat the opposing party be afforded an opportunity to tender submissions\non whether a supplemental award should be rendered under s 43(4).\nThe tribunal’s failure to invite submissions on this issue constituted a\nbreach of the rules of natural justice.70     As\nis clear, the decision of the Court of Appeal inLW\nInfrastructureturned on the particular wording of s 43(4).\nIn that case, it was clear that the plaintiff had a right to be\nheard before a supplemental award (which increased the appellant’s\nliability) could be issued. However, the plaintiff does not – under\nthe 2007 SIAC Rules – have a corresponding right to be heard before\nthe Tribunal makes a decision on whether it ought to declare the\nproceedings closed before releasing the Award. As I have pointed\nout at[32]above,\nno version of the SIAC Rules imposes a duty on the tribunal to consult\nthe parties on whether proceedings should be closed. The closest\n– the 2010/2013 SIAC Rules – only provides thatifa\ntribunal wants to declare the proceedings closed it must first consult\nthe parties on whether they have any evidence to tender or submissions\nto make. However, the 2010/2013 SIAC Rules do not impose a duty\nof consultation if the tribunal does not intend to declare the proceedings\nclosed. In the circumstances, I hold that the plaintiff has not\nsucceeded in showing a breach of natural justice so its application\nunder s 24(b) failsin limine.71     Furthermore,\nI am not convinced that the plaintiff has successfully shown that\nhe has been prejudiced. InLW Infrastructureat[54], the Court of\nAppeal held that, where a court wants to consider whether prejudice\nhas arisen from a denial of the right to a fair hearing,… [T]he real inquiry is whether\nthe breach of natural justice was merely technical and inconsequential\nor whether as a result of the breach, the arbitrator was denied\nthe benefit of arguments or evidence that had a real as opposed\nto a fanciful chance of making a difference to his deliberations.\nPut another way, the issue is whether the materialcould\nreasonablyhave made a difference to the arbitrator;\nrather than whether itwould necessarilyhave done\nso. [emphasis in original]The key here is that the\nprejudice shown must relate to theoutcome\nof the present arbitration.72     In\nthe instant case, the plaintiff asserts three heads of prejudice:\nfirst, that its intended arbitration against Noble (which it had\nyet to initiate, pending the release of the Award) might be met\nwith the defence of prescription/laches; second, that, due to the\ndelay, it would have difficulty locating witnesses for the arbitration\nagainst Noble; and third, that it was made liable to pay a large\nsum in interest as a result of the delay in the release of the Award.[note: 29]The first two\nreasons have nothing to do with the outcome of thepresentarbitration.\nIn any case, there is no reason why the plaintiff need have waited\nuntil the conclusion of this arbitration before taking action against\nNoble since any contemplated action Noble would involve different\nparties and different contracts. Any prejudice suffered by the plaintiff\nas a result of its own decision (which has not been proved) is not\ncausally connected with this arbitration. The final reason – the\npayment of the additional interest – is aconsequenceof\nthe outcome of the arbitration rather than a factor which would\nhave affected its outcome. Furthermore, as pointed out by the court\ninHong Huatat[59], for as long as\nthe Award had not been rendered, the plaintiffs would have had use\nof the money and could have invested it profitably. Thus, the plaintiff\ncannot assert that it had been prejudiced by the imposition of interest\nfor the period of time during which the Award was outstanding.73     The\nplaintiff’s remaining argument is grounded on the assertion that the\n19-month delay in the issuance of the Award is a procedural irregularity that\namounts to a breach of natural justice. The plaintiff has not identified which\nparticular rule of natural justice has been infringed in this case\nand I do not see how the rules of natural justice have been breached\nhere. First, I do not see how the delay could have impaired the\nplaintiff’s right to a fair hearing. The plaintiff calculates the\ndelay in terms of the lapse of time between the date the parties’\nfiled their final submissions (in August 2012) and the date of the\nrelease of the Award (in March 2014). Given that the Award was prepared\non the basis of the submissions of the parties – all of which had\nalready been tendered by August 2012 – there is no possibility that\nthe plaintiff had been prejudiced in the preparation of its case.\nIt is not the case that the plaintiff had applied for, but had been\nrefused leave, to adduce additional evidence after August 2012.\nSecond, I do not see how dilatoriness on the part of the Tribunal\ncan be evidence of bias. As noted by this court inPT\nCentral Investindoat[68], delay in the release of an\naward affects both parties equally. Thus, it is difficult to envision\nhow an inference of bias can be drawn against a tribunal on the\nbasis of dilatoriness in the release of an award.74     In\nshort, I find that there was no rule of natural justice was breached. Further,\nI am not convinced that the plaintiff has successfully shown the requisite\nprejudice required to justify the setting aside of the Award on\nthe basis of a breach of natural justice.Conclusion75     I\nfind that the issuance of the Award was in accordance with the parties’\nagreement and that there is no basis under either public policy\nor the rules of natural justice for the Award to be set aside. In\nthe premises, I dismiss the plaintiff’s application.Costs76     Taking\ninto account the novelty of the issues before me and the arguments\nand authorities submitted by both counsel, I award the defendant\ncosts fixed at $20,000 inclusive of disbursements. This award of costs\nis also consistent with the parties’ submissions on costs. It leaves\nme to thank both counsel for their able assistance in the presentation\nof their respective cases.[note: 1]Plaintiff’s\nOutline Submissions dated 30 December 2014 (“Plaintiff’s Outline Submissions”)\nat [3].[note: 2]Plaintiff’s Outline\nSubmissions at [4]; Defendant’s Written Submissions dated 7 January\n2015 at [6].[note: 3]Final Award in the matter\nofGHCL Limited v Coal & Oil Company LLC(SIAC Arb\nNo. 59 of 2009/CV) (“The Award”) at [3].[note: 4]The\nAward at [6].[note: 5]The\nAward at [14(g)].[note: 6]The\nAward at [85].[note: 7]The Award at [43].[note: 8]The Award at [50].[note: 9]The\nAward at [51].[note: 10]The\nAward at [52].[note: 11]The\nAward at [7].[note: 12]Plaintiff’s Outline\nSubmissions at [5]; Defendant’s Written Submissions at [10].[note: 13]The\nAward at [138].[note: 14]OS\n538/2014 at [1]; Plaintiff’s Outline Submissions at [6a][note: 15]OS\n538/2014 at [2] and [3]; Plaintiff’s Outline Submissions at [6b][note: 16]OS 538/2014 at [4][note: 17]Notes\nof Evidence dated 20 January 2015 at p 3.[note: 18]Plaintiff’s Outline\nSubmissions at [45].[note: 19]Defendant’s\nWritten Submissions at [44].[note: 20]Plaintiff’s Outline\nSubmissions at [11]–[12].[note: 21]Defendant’s\nWritten Submissions at [82]–[85].[note: 22]Defendant’s\nWritten Submissions at [83].[note: 23]Plaintiff’s\nOutline Submissions at [12].[note: 24]Plaintiff’s Outline\nSubmissions at [6(b)(i)].[note: 25]Notes\nof Evidence dated 20 January 2015 at p 2, lines 13–25.[note: 26]Plaintiff’s Outline\nSubmissions at [15].[note: 27]Plaintiff’s\nOutline Submissions at [37].[note: 28]Notes\nof Evidence dated 20 January 2015 at p 3, lines 1–4; Plaintiff’s\nOral Submissions – Bullet Points at [30]–[31].[note: 29]Plaintiff’s Outline\nSubmissions at [40]–[41].",
