        "Maintenance": "11     As for maintenance, s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter provides as follows: In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters: (a)    the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future: (b)    the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future; (c)    the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage; (d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage; (e)    any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage; (f)     the contributions made by each of the parties to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family. 12     It must first be noted that Mr Yew is unemployed and is in ill health. He is diabetic, has high blood pressure and is already blind in the left eye. In his report on 1 April 2006, Assoc Prof Au Yong Kah Guan, a consultant ophthalmologist, certified that apart from being blind in his left eye, Mr Yew has wet myopic macular degeneration in his right eye. Another eye specialist, Dr Gerard Chuah, stated in a report dated 9 December 2005 that in view of his eye condition, it is highly likely that Mr Yew will require prolonged and life-long follow-ups and may require multiple treatments of laser. In view of his health problems, Mr Yew is clearly unable to work. 13     Apart from Mr Yew’s ill health and inability to work, it is pertinent to note that inLee Yong Chuan Edwin v Tan Soan Lian[2001] 1 SLR 377, the Court of Appeal accepted that for the purpose of determining the question of maintenance, the division of the matrimonial assets and the financial resources that the parties have or are likely to have in the foreseeable future may be taken into account. In the present case, with theen blocsale of the matrimonial home at Hilltops, Cairnhill, Mdm Liew already has in her hands quite a tidy sum. The parties’ Newton apartment, which has been fully paid for, has appreciated in value considerably in the present property market and there are other matrimonial properties. In short, the fact that Mdm Liew has been awarded 40% of the matrimonial assets cannot be overlooked when considering the question of maintenance. In these circumstances and in view of Mr Yew’s unemployment and ill health, Mdm Liew’s suggestion that she be paid a monthly maintenance of around $4,700 or a lump sum of $200,000.00 cannot be countenanced. This is especially so since separate arrangements had already been made for the welfare of Don, who is presently below 21 years of age. 14     On hindsight, it might have been preferable not to have ordered Mr Yew to pay any maintenance at all to Mdm Liew. Mr Yew has not appealed against the order that he pay $700 per month to Mdm Liew. As for Mdm Liew, she may have her long list of expenses, as outlined in her affidavit, but she should be content with her share of the matrimonial assets and use them to maintain her preferred life-style."
