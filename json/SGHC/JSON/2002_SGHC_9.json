        "The role of an auditor": "10.    Before considering the 16 relevant charges\n\nagainst Mr Tay, a consideration of the role of an auditor will be helpful. InRe London\n\n& General Bank (No 2)[1895] 2 Ch 673, 682, Lindley LJ said:[An auditor’s] business is to ascertain and state the true\n\n  financial position of the company at the time of the audit, and his duty is confined to\n\n  that. But then comes the question : How is he to ascertain that position? The answer is,\n\n  by examining the books of the company. But he does not discharge his duty by doing this\n\n  without inquiry and without taking any trouble to see that the books themselves show the\n\n  company’s true position. He must take reasonable care to ascertain that they do so.\n\n  Unless he does this, his audit would be worse than an idle farce. Assuming the books to be\n\n  so kept as to show the true position of a company, the auditor has to frame a balance\n\n  sheet showing that position according to the books and to certify that the balance sheet\n\n  presented is correct in that sense. But, his first duty is to examine the books, not\n\n  merely for the purpose of ascertaining what they do show, but also for the purpose of\n\n  satisfying himself that they show the true financial position of the company.11.    Lindley LJ’s view was endorsed inWong\n\nKok Chin v Singapore Society of Accountants[1989] SLR 1129, 1148 by Yong Pung How J,\n\nas he then was, who added as follows:While reasonable care and skill as first laid down in these 19thcentury cases still remains the standard required of an auditor, some recent authorities\n\n  have generally recognised the more exacting nature of this standard in the light of modern\n\n  day conditions. The importance of this has been emphasized by considering defaults in the\n\n  light of the surrounding circumstances, having regard also to professional codes of\n\n  standards andguidelinesand to evidence of general professional practice. In\n\n  particular, a court which is determining a case must guard against hindsight and only take\n\n  into account knowledge available to the auditor at the time of default….In determining whether there has been a breach by an auditor of the\n\n  duty of reasonable skill and care, the court must therefore have regard to the overall\n\n  background and circumstances in which the alleged breach occurred.",
        "Charge No 1": "12.    The first charge against Mr Tay concerned the\n\nfact that the Reviewers found no evidence in the Group Audit Planning Brief\n\n(\"GAPB\") or in the other audit working papers that he had evaluated and\n\ndocumented the potential impact of the significant increase in the number of companies\n\nmaking losses and the significant decline in the profits of the Group after the draft\n\naccounts of the companies included in the consolidation for the year ended 31 December\n\n1995 were made available to BDO. In fact, the Reviewers asserted that the GAPB was mainly\n\nprepared on the basis of accounts up to 30 June 1995. Mr Tay was alleged to have breached\n\nthe following:(a) SAG 5(11), which stipulates a list of matters that the auditor\n\n  should consider when developing his overall plan for the expected scope and conduct of the\n\n  audit;(b) SAG 4(14), which states that plans should be further developed and\n\n  revised as necessary during the course of the audit; and(c) SAG 5(3), which states that planning should be continuous\n\n  throughout the engagement.13.    The Inquiry Committee asserted that Mr Tay did\n\nnot answer the charge against him. It said that his position was that as he had already\n\nperformed the audit, audit planning was irrelevant and noted that he had explained his\n\napproach to auditing as follows:If you want to do a good job, there are certain steps, procedures, but\n\n  whether you should do procedure No 1 first or procedure No 2, for example, coming back to\n\n  your cooking experience, what is there to pour in the lime juice in making rojak last but\n\n  the rojak man prefers to put the lime juice in the blachan and all that and he mixes that\n\n  first. At the end of the day, you still get a very good rojak dish.14.    PAB’s counsel, Mr Lee, pointed out that Mr\n\nTay had confused an \"audit plan\" with an \"audit programme\" and that\n\nhis explanation in relation to the first charge concerned the execution of standard audit\n\nprogrammes and not audit planning.15.    At the hearing of the appeal, Mr Raman conceded\n\nthat his client did not include the Group’s deteriorating performance in the audit\n\nplan in question but submitted that this state of affairs could be ascertained from other\n\ndocuments, including the subsidiaries’ accounts. This is not an answer to the first\n\ncharge. Furthermore, it should not be overlooked that at the hearing of the inquiry, Mr\n\nTay admitted that he had not carried out the requisite financial analysis to evaluate and\n\ndocument the significant increase in the number of companies making losses and the\n\nsignificant decline in the profits of the Group when the GAPB was prepared. There is thus\n\nno reason to fault the Inquiry Committee’s finding on the first charge.",
        "Charge No 2": "16.    The second charge against Mr Tay concerned his\n\nfailure to consider in the audit plan the significance of the 12 material subsidiaries\n\naudited by other auditing firms. These 12 subsidiaries accounted for around 70% of the\n\nGroup’s turnover and around 65% of the Group’s total cost of investments. In the\n\nyear ended 31 December 1995, 10 of them suffered losses.17.    The Reviewers found no evidence in the GAPB that\n\na proper risk analysis was performed on the accounts of each of the said subsidiaries and\n\non their overall significance to the Group. It was also alleged that there was no evidence\n\nthat the auditor reviewed and revised the audit plan of each of the 12 subsidiaries and of\n\nthe Group after the draft accounts of the companies for the year ended 31 December 1995\n\nwere made available to BDO. Mr Tay was accused of having breached SAG 5(11), SAG 4(14) and\n\nSAG 5(3), which have been referred to above.18.    Mr Tay pointed out that each subsidiary was\n\nsubject to an audit under the same professional rules and that the auditors of these\n\ncompanies submitted reports and draft audited accounts to BDO for testing the\n\nconsolidation work sheets prepared by the client. He added that the review and evaluation\n\nwere performed continuously over the course of the audit. Finally, he claimed that BDO\n\nrelied on a report prepared by Merrill Lynch in January 1996, which evaluated the\n\nfinancial performance and position of the Group.19.    The Inquiry Committee noted that the auditors of\n\nthe subsidiaries that were not audited by BDO planned their audit and scope of work for\n\nthe purpose of being able to express an opinion on the financial statements of each\n\nsubsidiary standing alone. Those auditors had no responsibility to consider the financial\n\nposition and results of the Group as a whole. Only BDO had this responsibility. As such,\n\nBDO was required to determine the adequacy of audit work performed not only for expressing\n\nan audit opinion on the financial statements of the subsidiaries standing alone but also\n\nfor expressing an opinion on the consolidated accounts. The Inquiry Committee thought that\n\nBDO had not done what was required of them as Amcol’s auditors. As for the Merrill\n\nLynch Report, it found that Mr Tay failed to consider the serious audit implications in\n\nthis report when he was planning the audit. In fact, this omission is the subject of the\n\nfourth charge, which will be discussed below. During the hearing of the appeal, there was\n\nno credible evidence that the finding of the Inquiry Committee with respect to the second\n\ncharge was defective in any way.",
        "Charge No 3": "20.    The third charge concerned Mr Tay’s failure\n\nto consider the corporate reconstruction exercise involving Amcol Plastic, Amcol\n\nEngineering and Amcol Multitech in the audit plan of each of these companies. The\n\nReviewers found \"no evidence that the audit plans of the 3 companies were reviewed\n\nand revised in the light of the corporate restructuring exercise and in accordance with\n\nparagraph 10.3 of the GAPB\". Mr Tay was alleged to have breached SAG 5(11), SAG 4(14)\n\nand SAG 5(3), which have been referred to in relation to the first charge.21.    Mr Tay’s answers to this charge were\n\ninconsistent. Initially, he said that as the corporate reconstruction was only made known\n\nto BDO in December 1995, it could not be covered in the relevant audit plan. However, in\n\nhis second response dated 7 October 2000, he altered his position and stated as follows:BDO was aware of the reconstruction and consequently in preparing the\n\n  Group Planning Brief and in anticipation, BDO included such a matter in said paragraph\n\n  10.3\".22.    Paragraph 10.3 of the Group Planning Brief merely\n\nstated that the Group was \"in the process of consolidating certain of their\n\nactivities, being scaling down substantially the operations of certain subsidiaries and\n\ndisposal of certain investment and purchase of other business\". Mr Tay thus did not\n\nanswer the charge that the audit plans of Amcol Engineering, Amcol Plastic and/or Amcol\n\nMultitech were not reviewed or revised in the light of the corporate restructuring\n\nexercise and in accordance with para 10.3 of the Group Planning Brief. In fact, he took\n\nthe view that the Group Planning Brief \"provided excellent direction, guidance and\n\nthe slant of the audit to the auditors\". He added that no further value could be\n\nadded to the audit process by re-writing or re-phrasing the contents of the individual\n\naudit plans of Amcol Plastic, Amcol Engineering and Amcol Multitech.23.    Mr Tay thus did not furnish any credible reason\n\nas to why the Inquiry Committee’s verdict with respect to this charge was\n\nunjustified.",
        "Charge No 4": "24.    The fourth charge against Mr Tay was that he\n\nfailed to consider in the audit plan of the Amcol Group the serious audit implications in\n\na 1996 report by Merrill Lynch, which referred to the following concerns regarding Amcol:(a)    It had no core business and lacked management control in a number\n\n  of its joint ventures;(b)    It had a poor track record of investments in several instances;(c)    It was significantly more highly geared than comparable\n\n  companies;(d)    Its forecasted earnings were primarily from non-recurring\n\n  sources. The Group's source of earnings after Costa Rhu was uncertain;(e)    Its forecasted earnings and cash flow forecast were expected to\n\n  deteriorate after two years;(f)    It had many divisions which made insignificant or even negative\n\n  contributions to net income;(g)    It had significant exposures to low earning businesses; and(h)    Amcol’s earnings and cash flow streams were highly dependent\n\n  on investments such as Costa Rhu. With the maturing of such investments, the future source\n\n  of earnings were uncertain given the absence of substantial recurring earning streams.25.    For failing to pay sufficient attention to the\n\nserious concerns raised in the Merrill Lynch Report, Mr Tay was accused of having breached\n\nSAG 4(14), SAG 5(3) and SAG 5(11), which have been referred to above in relation to the\n\nfirst charge.26.    Mr Tay’s response to the fourth charge was\n\nas follows:The carrying values of the assets were sufficiently covered by the\n\n  audit programmes, which were performed adequately at the subsidiary, company and group\n\n  levels and therefore BDO obtained sufficient audit evidence to form an opinion on the\n\n  entities.27.    The Inquiry Committee saw in Mr Tay’s\n\nresponse an indication that BDO did not vary its originally planned approach in auditing\n\nto take into account the specific concerns raised in the Merrill Lynch Report and noted\n\nthat there was no documentation of the reasons for taking this position. It also noted\n\nthat Mr Tay had stated in his second response on 7 October 2000 that he took Merrill\n\nLynch’s comment that forecasted earnings was expected to deteriorate after two years\n\nas a reason for concluding that from \"an audit point of view, the review by Merrill\n\nLynch indicates the group is a going concern at least for the next 12 months\".\n\nHowever, there was no evidence that Mr Tay reviewed or revised his audit plans for the\n\naudit of the Group accounts to include additional appropriate procedures to consider the\n\npotential effect of the matters set out in the Merrill Lynch Report. The Inquiry Committee\n\nthus concluded that the fourth charge was clearly proven. No valid reason was furnished as\n\nto why the Inquiry Committee had been wrong.",
        "Charge No 5": "28.    The fifth charge concerned Mr Tay’s failure\n\nto comply with materiality guidelines stipulated in the GAPB. The materiality levels for\n\nbalance sheet items of 9 subsidiary companies were set at 5% of the total assets, as\n\nopposed to 5% of net assets under the GAPB. No reasons were given for the deviation from\n\nthe guideline stipulated in the GAPB for the adoption of the higher materiality level. Mr\n\nTay was accused of having breached SAG 4(11), which requires an auditor \"to document\n\nmatters which are important in providing evidence that the audit was carried out in\n\naccordance with the basic principles\".29.    Mr Tay, who admitted that there had been an\n\nerror, insisted that this was due to an oversight. In his written response dated 7 October\n\n2000, he stated as follows:It is unlikely that the % would have been based on net assets and they\n\n  would have dismissed it as a typographical error.30.    The Inquiry Committee did not accept Mr\n\nTay’s explanation and I was not convinced that the Committee’s finding on the\n\nfifth charge was wrong.",
        "Charge No 6": "31.    The sixth charge against Mr Tay concerned his\n\nfailure to check whether or not the Amcol Financial Manual (\"AFM\") had been\n\ncomplied with. He was alleged to have breached SAG 7(15), which requires an auditor to\n\n\"review the accounting system and related internal controls to gain an understanding\n\nof the flow of transactions and the specific control procedures to be able to make a\n\npreliminary evaluation and identification of those internal controls on which it might be\n\neffective and efficient to rely in conducting his audit.\" He was also alleged to have\n\nbreached SAG 7(28), which requires an auditor who has become aware of weaknesses in\n\ninternal control to make management aware, on a timely basis, of material weaknesses which\n\nhave come to his attention.32.    The audit planning briefs of 6 of Amcol’s\n\nsubsidiaries provided that audit tests were to be carried out to ensure that the company\n\nhas complied with the procedures and practices laid down in the AFM. The importance of the\n\ntests was also emphasised in the Group’s audit planning memorandum, in which BDO\n\nstated that the \"audit should also ensure that the standing instructions contained in\n\nthe AFM are adhered to by [Amcol] and its subsidiaries\". Material deviations from the\n\nAFM were to be highlighted to the Board and the Audit Committee.33.    Mr Tay’s response to this charge was as\n\nfollows:Although the AFM has laid down certain procedures and practices, most\n\n  of these were general in nature and could not be specifically tested for compliance.\n\n  Hence, we considered the operations of the company as a whole and noted that there was no\n\n  significant non-compliance. It was verbally communicated by the audit partner and manager\n\n  to the management of [Amcol] that the AFM should be reviewed and re-drafted to provide\n\n  more specific guidelines to be more meaningful. The basic objective of an audit is to\n\n  ensure that the financial statements (not the AFM) were true and fair.34.    The Inquiry Committee, which found that no work\n\nhad been performed by the auditor on the AFM, was surprised that BDO, which had stressed\n\nthe importance of testing the AFM in the audit plans, abandoned the AFM on the ground of\n\nits irrelevance. It thought this to be particularly disturbing because BDO had been the\n\nauditor of Amcol and some of its subsidiaries for a number of years.35.    Finally, the Inquiry Committee found no evidence\n\nthat the inadequacies of the AFM were communicated to the company as required by SAG\n\n7(28).36.    At the hearing of the appeal, Mr Raman submitted\n\nthat the company’s general manager had been orally informed of the inadequacies in\n\nthe AFM. However, this assertion was not corroborated in any way. No additional light was\n\nshed on the matters put before the Inquiry Committee. In these circumstances, there are no\n\ngrounds for disagreeing with the Inquiry Committee’s finding on the sixth charge.",
        "Charge No 7": "37.    The seventh charge against Mr Tay was that no\n\naudit planning briefs had been prepared for three of Amcol’s subsidiaries, namely\n\nAmcol China, Amcol International and Amcol Enterprises. He was alleged to have breached\n\nSAG 4(12), which requires an auditor to plan his work to enable him to conduct an\n\neffective audit in an efficient and timely manner, and SAG 5(12), which requires an\n\nauditor to document his overall plan.38.    In his response dated 7 October 2000, Mr Tay\n\nstated that it was his policy not to prepare planning documentation where the audit fee\n\nfor a company is, as it was in the case of the companies in question, less than $5,000. He\n\nalso tried to justify the lack of such documentation by asserting that sufficient\n\ndirection had been provided to the audit staff and that sufficient audit evidence had been\n\nconsidered. The Inquiry Committee thought it inappropriate to dispense with the\n\nrequirement of planning documentation merely because the audit fee was less than $5,000.\n\nIn its view, the audit fee, which is often agreed upon after negotiations with the client,\n\nmay bear no direct relationship to the risk, complexity and/or size of a company. The\n\nCommittee thus found him guilty of the charge in question. No evidence was submitted at\n\nthe hearing of the appeal as to why Mr Tay’s practice of not preparing the requisite\n\naudit plans where the audit fee is less than $5,000 ought to be countenanced. In these\n\ncircumstances, the Inquiry Committee cannot be faulted for taking Mr Tay to task for not\n\npreparing the relevant audit planning briefs.",
        "Charge No 9": "39.    The ninth charge concerned Mr Tay’s failure\n\nto identify errors in the presentation of the Amcol Infrastructure accounts. Contrary to\n\nthe Companies Act, the amounts owed to the holding company and minority shareholders were\n\ntreated as part of shareholders’ equity. He was accused of having breached SAG 4(10),\n\nwhich states that an auditor \"should carefully direct, supervise and review work\n\ndelegated to assistants\" and that the auditor \"should ensure that work performed\n\nby other auditors or experts is adequate for his purpose\". He was also charged with\n\nhaving breached SAG 8(10), which states that the work performed by each assistant should\n\nbe reviewed by personnel of equal or higher competence to determine whether the work has\n\nbeen performed in accordance with professional and firm standards, whether the work\n\nperformed and the results obtained have been adequately documented, whether any\n\nsignificant audit matters remain unresolved and whether the objectives of the audit\n\nprocedures have been achieved and the conclusions expressed support the auditor’s\n\nopinion on the financial information. Finally, he was said to have breached SAG 8(11),\n\nwhich notes that the major review stages can often be identified in an audit include a\n\nreview of the initial audit plan and the audit programme, a review of the study and\n\nevaluation of internal control, a review of the documentation of the audit evidence\n\nobtained and the conclusions drawn and a review of the financial information and proposed\n\nauditor’s report.40.    At the hearing of the appeal, Mr Tay reiterated\n\nthat the errors were typographical errors. The Inquiry Committee did not believe that the\n\naccounts, which had been reviewed by the partner and manager, could contain such obvious\n\nerrors. It thus believed that Mr Tay had not supervised and reviewed the work of his\n\nassistants and had breached SAG 4(10), SAG 8(10) and SAG 8(11). I was not convinced that\n\nthe conclusion of the Inquiry Committee with respect to the ninth charge was wrong.",
        "Charge No 10": "41.    The tenth charge against Mr Tay concerned the\n\nReviewers’ allegation that in relation to Amcol Plastic, they found no evidence that\n\nthe audit programme to review credit notes issued after the end of the year had been\n\nperformed. Mr Tay was thus alleged to have breached SAG 4(10), SAG 8(10) and SAG 8(11),\n\nwhich have been referred to in relation to the ninth charge.42.    In his initial response, Mr Tay admitted his\n\ndefault when he stated as follows:Yes, we have missed out on reviewing credit notes issued after the year\n\n  end.43.    In his second response on 7 October 2000, Mr Tay\n\ndenied that audit work had not been done to establish the effect of credit notes. The\n\nInquiry Committee believed that Mr Tay’s initial admission that he had not reviewed\n\ncredit notes reflected the true position. It noted that he did not explain satisfactorily\n\nhow he knew that no credit notes were issued after the end of the year and added that even\n\nif this is true, the audit programme step should have been completed with an explanatory\n\nfootnote as to why that step was no longer required.44.    During the appeal, no satisfactory explanation\n\nwas given as to why Mr Tay provided contradictory responses to the charge against him. I\n\nwas not satisfied that the Inquiry Committee was not entitled to come to the conclusion\n\nthat it did in relation to the tenth charge.",
        "Charge No 11": "45.    The eleventh charge concerned Mr Tay’s\n\nfailure to complete audit programmes. In relation to Amcol Plastic, it was alleged that\n\nthere was a lack of evidence of review by the engagement manager and partner in the audit\n\nprogrammes and working papers. Furthermore, it was alleged that Mr Tay did not carry out\n\nTest 8 on the audit programme on share capital, reserves and dividends. He was accused of\n\nhaving breached SAG 4(10), SAG 8(10) and SAG 8(11), which were referred to in relation to\n\nthe ninth charge.46.    As far as the failure to properly sign off audit\n\nprogrammes is concerned, Mr Tay admitted the error. He said that this was due to an\n\noversight and pointed out that it should not be overlooked that he had read and checked\n\nevery page.47.    The Inquiry Committee found that as Mr Tay had\n\nadmitted to the identified failures, he was guilty of the charge in question. In its view,\n\nMr Tay’s attempts to respond to questions on this lapse on his part by referring to\n\nhis review of the audit work papers showed that he was evasive. It also noted that Mr Tay\n\nhad accepted that if audit programmes are not signed and dated, it would be \"much\n\nmore difficult to establish that the programme steps were completed\".48.    At the hearing of the appeal, the Inquiry\n\nCommittee’s findings were not satisfactorily challenged. As Mr Tay had admitted to\n\nthe lapses referred to in the eleventh charge against him, there are no grounds for\n\ndisagreeing with the verdict of the Inquiry Committee in relation to the eleventh charge.",
        "Charge No 13": "49.    The thirteenth charge concerned Mr Tay’s\n\nfailure to date the audit planning briefs for Amcol Rex and Amcol Warehouse. He was thus\n\naccused of having breached SAG 8(11), which was referred to above in relation to the ninth\n\ncharge.50.    At the hearing of the appeal, Mr Tay admitted\n\nthat he was guilty of this charge.",
        "Charge No 14": "51.    The fourteenth charge concerned, inter alia, Mr\n\nTay’s failure to properly date the audit programme of the Amcol Group. It was\n\nreviewed and signed on 2 August 1996, about three months after the date of the audit\n\nreport, namely 30 April 1996. Mr Tay was said to have breached SAG 4(10) and SAG 8(10),\n\nwhich have been referred to earlier on in this judgment. At the hearing of the appeal, Mr\n\nTay admitted that he was guilty of this charge.",
        "Charge No 15": "52.    The fifteenth charge against Mr Tay related to\n\nhis failure to obtain an updated management representation letter. In the audit of Amcol\n\nRex, the management representation letter was dated 10 January 1996 whereas the audit\n\nreport was dated 8 March 1996. This difference of two months breached SAG 20(12), which\n\nstates as follows:A management letter should normally be dated the same date as the\n\n  auditor’s report on the financial statements. However, in certain circumstances in\n\n  respect of specific transactions, a separate representation letter may also be obtained\n\n  during the course of the audit.53.    Mr Tay’s first response to this charge was\n\nas follows:We acknowledge that we should have obtained a revised management letter\n\n  but did not due to oversight.54.    In his second response, Mr Tay asserted that the\n\nmanagement representation letter was irrelevant and cited his 30 years of experience in\n\nAustralia to support this view. He also said that the Inquiry Committee failed to note\n\nthat SAG 20(4) provides that the auditor can obtain evidence of management’s\n\nacknowledgement of such responsibility and approval from relevant minutes of meetings of\n\nthe management board or other similar body or by obtaining a written representation from\n\nmanagement of a signed copy of the financial statement. He added that the financial\n\nstatements were signed by the directors before the auditors signed them and the only\n\ncircumstance which had changed between the earlier date and the date of the financial\n\nstatements was the compulsory acquisition of the leasehold land owned by Amcol Rex.\n\nHowever, the acquisition had been gazetted and independently verified.55.    At the hearing of the appeal, no convincing\n\nevidence was introduced to support Mr Tay’s assertion that an updated management\n\nletter was not required in the circumstances of the case. As Mr Tay did not have the\n\nrequisite management letter, he had no defence to the fifteenth charge.",
        "Charge No 16": "56.    The sixteenth charge concerned a failure to take\n\ninto account post balance-sheet events. It was alleged that Mr Tay failed to take into\n\nconsideration the fact that the audit reports of most of the Group’s stable of\n\ncompanies were dated earlier than the audit report date for the Group’s accounts,\n\nnamely 30 April 1996. The Reviewers found insufficient evidence of a review of subsequent\n\nevents from the respective dates of their audit reports to 30 April 1996. Mr Tay was\n\nalleged to have breached SAG 4(11) and SAG 10(4), which have been referred to earlier on\n\nin this judgment. In addition, he was alleged to have breached SAG 24(7) and (8) and SAG\n\n20(5) and (6).57.    SAG 24(8) provides that the procedures to\n\nidentify subsequent events should be performed as near as practicable to the date of the\n\nauditor’s report. As for SAG 24(7), it states as follows:The auditor is not expected to conduct a continuing review of all\n\n  matters to which he has previously applied procedures and reached conclusions. However,\n\n  the auditor should perform procedures designed to satisfy himself that all subsequent\n\n  events up to the date of his report that may require adjustment of or disclosure in the\n\n  financial statements have been identified. These procedures are in addition to specific\n\n  procedures which may be applied to transactions occurring after the balance sheet date\n\n  designed to obtain evidence as to account balances as at the balance sheet date, for\n\n  example, the examination of data to ensure that transactions have been recorded in the\n\n  proper period.58.    SAG 20(5) states that where representations are\n\nmade by management whether unsolicited or in response to specific inquiries, the auditor\n\nshould, when such representations relate to matters which are material to the financial\n\nstatements, seek corroborative audit evidence from sources inside or outside the entity,\n\nevaluate whether the said representations appear reasonable and consistent with the other\n\naudit evidence obtained and consider whether the individuals making the representations\n\ncan be expected to be well-informed on the matter. It adds that if the said representation\n\nis contradicted by other evidence, the auditor should investigate the circumstances and,\n\nwhen necessary, reconsider the reliability of other representations made by management.\n\nSAG 20(6) makes it clear that representations by management cannot be a substitute for\n\nother audit evidence that the auditor would expect to find.59.    Mr Tay referred to the work done by his firm from\n\n13 March 1996 and 23 April 1996 on the rights issue by Amcol as proof that review work had\n\nbeen carried out subsequent to 31 December 1995. He claimed that during the Amcol rights\n\nissue exercise, he concurrently covered subsequent developments relating to Amcol and its\n\nsubsidiaries. However, the Inquiry Committee took the view that work concerning the rights\n\nissue \"was not suitable for complying with the requirements in auditing subsequent\n\nevents in a statutory audit\". In any case, the audit programme on subsequent events\n\npresented by BDO concerned Amcol, the holding company, and did not specifically address\n\nwork to be done with respect to its subsidiaries. It thus found Mr Tay guilty of this\n\ncharge. I saw no reason to question this finding of the Inquiry Committee.",
        "Charge No 18": "60.    The eighteenth charge concerns a failure to\n\nadequately consider the audit implication of control deviations discovered when payment\n\nvouchers were checked. For instance, in the audit of Amcol, all the 40 payment vouchers\n\nchecked had not been authorised by the appropriate officers. It was alleged that the\n\ncauses of the control deviations and their implications on the audit were not considered.\n\nThe Reviewers also noted that there was no evidence of work to ascertain the adequacy of\n\nthe segregation of duties to prevent and detect duplicate payments. It was further alleged\n\nthat Mr Tay had not communicated the weaknesses in the internal controls to the\n\nmanagement. Mr Tay was alleged to have breached the following:(a) SAG 7(23), which notes that deviations from prescribed controls may\n\n  be caused by factors such as changes in key personnel and human error and requires an\n\n  auditor to make specific enquiries concerning these matters;(b) SAG 7(24), which provides that based on the results of his\n\n  compliance procedures, the auditor should evaluate whether the internal controls are\n\n  adequate for his purposes;(c) SAG 7(28) requires an auditor to make his client aware of\n\n  weaknesses in internal control; and(d) SAG 5(16), which provides that the audit plan and related programme\n\n  should be reconsidered as the audit progresses and that such consideration is based on the\n\n  auditor’s review of internal control, his preliminary evaluation thereof, and the\n\n  result of his compliance and substantive procedures.61.    Mr Tay’s response to this charge was as\n\nfollows:[T]he control reliance audit was not used for the audits of Amcol\n\n  companies. Consequently, the PAB Reviewers’ comments are not relevant.62.    He also pointed out that the Inquiry Committee\n\nfailed to take into account the evidence in the working papers that the control reliance\n\naudit approach was not used for the audit of Amcol companies. The audit planning brief\n\nstated that it would be more cost effective to apply substantive testing procedures rather\n\nthan internal controls. He also claimed that a draft management letter dated 30 June 1996\n\ncontaining comments on, inter alia, reallocation of expenses to related companies,\n\napproval on payment vouchers and inter company balances was sent to the client.63.    The Inquiry Committee found no evidence that\n\ndeviations from internal controls were fully considered and the risk assessed. As for the\n\nlack of communication of the weaknesses of the internal controls to the management of\n\nAmcol, the Committee said that there was no evidence that a management letter was finally\n\nissued to the client. As such, it found that this charge had also been proven. I saw no\n\nreason to disagree with this conclusion.",
        "Charge No 19": "64.    The final charge against Mr Tay concerned a\n\nfailure to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to support the audit opinion in respect\n\nof SAS 19. More specifically, the complaint was that in relation to the accounts of Amcol\n\nRex for the year ended 31 December 1995, he issued an unqualified opinion although he had\n\ngiven a qualified opinion in the 1994 audit as a result of his disagreement with\n\nmanagement on the capitalisation of interest cost on borrowing relating to a development\n\nsite owned by Amcol Rex. For the year ended 31 December 1995, interest capitalised into\n\ndevelopment properties was $6,032,269. Out of this, $1,479,924 was capitalised in the year\n\nunder review. The Inquiry Committee could not understand why Mr Tay did not qualify the\n\n1995 accounts and he was accused of having breached, inter alia, SAG 4(21), which requires\n\nan auditor to review and assess the conclusions drawn from the audit evidence obtained as\n\nthe basis for his opinion on the financial information.65.    Mr Tay denied that he erred by not qualifying\n\nAmcol Rex’s accounts for 1995. To him, the capitalisation of interest cost of $1.479m\n\nwas not material at Group level or at the subsidiary company level. In fact, it\n\nconstituted only about 4% of the total assets of Amcol Rex.66.    The Inquiry Committee took the view that as the\n\nproposed development was no longer feasible due to the compulsory acquisition of the\n\nproposed development site, Amcol Rex should not have capitalised the interest cost as this\n\ndid not comply with SAS 19. It explained its position as follows:In the view of the Inquiry Committee there was no approval received\n\n  from the relevant authorities to develop the site and this lack of approval could not be\n\n  attributable to normal delays in permits in Singapore because the risk of non-approval was\n\n  evident from as far back as in 1992. We find no basis for the auditor of Amcol Rex not\n\n  qualifying his audit report of the 1995 accounts in view of the capitalisation of interest\n\n  cost as development properties. The Inquiry Committee was also disturbed by the responses\n\n  to questions given by Mr Tay during the hearing on 19 October 2000 …. [H]e stated\n\n  that he lifted the qualification in 1995 because Amcol Rex became a subsidiary of Amcol\n\n  Holdings.67.    The Inquiry Committee thus held that by not\n\nqualifying his audit report, Mr Tay breached SAG 4(21), which states as follows:The auditor should review and assess the conclusions drawn from the\n\n  audit evidence obtained as the basis for the expression of his opinion on the financial\n\n  information, This review and assessment involves forming an overall conclusion as to\n\n  whether:The financial information has been prepared using acceptable accounting policies which\n\n      have been consistently applied;The financial information complies with the relevant legislation and regulations so far\n\n      as they affect financial information and promulgations of the Singapore Society of\n\n      Accountants;The view presented by the financial information as a whole is consistent with the\n\n      auditor’s knowledge of the business of the entity; andThere is adequate disclosure for a true and fair presentation of the financial\n\n      information.68.    Mr Tay defended his decision not to qualify the\n\n1995 accounts by pointing out that the capitalisation in question was in order as\n\n\"the company had actively been submitting applications upon applications to the\n\nrelevant authorities but as the government had not yet finalised their MRT plans then, it\n\nwas unable to give the company any firm refusal to develop.\" He added that he had\n\nseen the drawings which Amcol Rex proposed to erect on the site.69.    It ought to be noted that in his response on 7\n\nOctober 2000, Mr Tay admitted that he knew when he issued his audit report for 1995 that\n\nthe property intended for development had already been compulsorily acquired by the\n\ngovernment. After considering all the arguments, I accept that Mr Tay ought to have\n\nqualified Amcol Rex’s accounts for the year ended 31 December 1995. As such, I do not\n\ndisagree with the conclusion of the Inquiry Committee in relation to the nineteenth\n\ncharge.C. WHETHER THE PENALTY WAS TOO HARSH70.    Mr Tay’s assertion that a suspension of 18\n\nmonths was too harsh will now be considered. He reiterated that the SAGs which he had\n\nbreached were mere guidelines with no binding force. He pointed out that the fact that the\n\nSAGs have now been replaced by Singapore Standards of Auditing, which must be complied\n\nwith, should not be overlooked. It was also argued that there is a degree of flexibility\n\nand a certain amount of discretion given to an auditor on whether or not to follow the\n\nguidelines strictly, and where a situation warrants it, the auditor may depart from the\n\nguidelines.71.    There is no doubt that at the very least, the\n\nSAGs are statements of minimum standards to be adhered to by practising accountants. Mr\n\nTay did not present any credible evidence as to why he was justified in not following the\n\nguidelines. He failed to establish that the alternative procedures followed by him were\n\nacceptable. Mr Raman referred to the affidavit of Mr Kaka Singh, an accountant with 30\n\nyears of experience, to the effect that he \"concurred with the various replies that\n\n[Mr Tay] has made to the observations, comments and charges against him\". Mr Singh\n\nwas not called to substantiate his assertion. A blanket statement by him that he agreed\n\nwith all that Mr Tay had said cannot advance the latter’s case very far. This is\n\nespecially since Mr Tay had accepted during the hearing of his appeal that he was guilty\n\nof a number of the charges.72.    The Inquiry Committee accepted that the test of\n\nprofessional misconduct is that set out inChew Kia Ngee v Singapore Society of\n\nAccountants[1988] SLR 999. In that case, LP Thean J, as he then was, substantially\n\nagreed with the following passage from the Pape J’s judgment inMercer v Pharmacy\n\nBoard of Victoria[1968] VR 72, 85:In my view ‘conduct discreditable to a pharmaceutical\n\n  chemist’ includes any conduct in relation to the carrying on of the business of a\n\n  chemist which would be reasonably regarded by other chemists of good professional\n\n  competence as calculated to destroy or lower public confidence in that chemist, or as\n\n  injuring the credit or standing of the chemist in his professional capacity. I do not\n\n  think it necessary that his conduct should be dishonest or fraudulent, or that it should\n\n  involve any moral turpitude. It is enough if it brings discredit on him as a\n\n  pharmaceutical chemist or on the profession as a whole. Nor do I think it necessarily\n\n  follows that conduct which is due solely to negligence or inadvertence cannot be said to\n\n  be discreditable conduct, because the chemist is in a position where his duties are to a\n\n  large extent laid down by Regulations or by the Act, and where great care is required in\n\n  the carrying out of those duties and because failure to exercise that degree of care\n\n  expected of him must necessarily lower public confidence in him and discredit him in the\n\n  eyes of his professional brethren.73.    When referring to the above-mentioned test inWong\n\nKok Chin v Singapore Society of Accountants[1989] SLR 1129, 1140, Yong Pung How J, as\n\nhe then was, said that a practical test could have been if reasonable people, on hearing\n\nwhat the accountant has done would have said without hesitation that as an accountant, he\n\nshould not have done it.74.    The Inquiry Committee did not mince its words\n\nwhen it explained why it thought that Mr Tay was guilty of professional misconduct and why\n\nhe ought to be suspended. In paragraph 6.1 of its report, it stated as follows:The Committee found that Mr Patrick Tay had not observed several of the\n\n  relevant professional pronouncements in the conduct of the audit of Amcol Holdings Ltd and\n\n  subsidiaries in many areas. His overall attitude towards SAGs was found to be callous and\n\n  disturbing. His approach to the audit of this significant group of companies appeared to\n\n  be casual and the documentation of work done and conclusions therefrom was totally absent\n\n  in many instances. Supervision of assistants and the quality of his review also appear to\n\n  be lacking as evidenced by the many instances of errors found, inconsistency in\n\n  documentation and the manner in which audit programmes were left unsigned or incorrectly\n\n  completed. Significant audit procedures were missing as evidenced by the lack of evidence\n\n  of appropriate work done in reviewing subsequent events at the subsidiaries. In planning\n\n  his audit he did not appear to have taken into consideration significant factors like the\n\n  significant deterioration in the profitability of the group and the results of the review\n\n  by Merrill Lynch. He did not take the necessary steps to update his initial planning to\n\n  take into account latest relevant information that became available during the course of\n\n  his work. In the view of the Committee his conduct of the audit of Amcol Holdings and its\n\n  subsidiaries has rendered him unfit to be a public accountant and would bring the\n\n  profession of public accountancy into disrepute.75.    The Inquiry Committee made it plain in paragraph\n\n6.3 of its report that it regarded Mr Tay’s breaches as serious in nature. In fact,\n\nfour of the five committee members recommended to the PAB that Mr Tay be suspended for the\n\nmaximum permitted period of two years while the remaining member thought that Mr\n\nTay’s professional misconduct was so grave that his registration as a public\n\naccountant ought to be cancelled. Notwithstanding these recommendations, the PAB suspended\n\nMr Tay for only 18 months. Taking all circumstances into account, it has not been\n\nestablished that the penalty imposed by the PAB ought to be varied in any way.D. CONCLUSION76.    For reasons already stated, Mr Tay’s appeal\n\nis dismissed with costs.Sgd:TAN LEE MENGJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
