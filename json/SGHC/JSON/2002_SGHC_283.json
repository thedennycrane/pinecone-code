        "Background": "2.\n\n        In the middle of 1995, Mr Philip Motha,\n\nPMC’s chairman, proposed to Mr Colin Moore, JLL’s then managing director, that\n\ntheir companies enter into a co-broking arrangement for the en bloc sale of a number of\n\nproperties in Devonshire Road (the \"Devonshire properties\"). It is pertinent to\n\nnote that when these discussions between Mr Motha and Mr Moore took place, neither PMC nor\n\nJLL had any mandate from the owners of the Devonshire properties to sell the said\n\nproperties on an en bloc basis.3.\n\n        By April 1996, PMC had obtained a mandate from\n\nthe owners of the Devonshire properties for the en bloc sale of their properties. PMC and\n\nJLL agreed to market the said properties together and Mr Terence Tang, JLL’s then\n\nsenior manager in the investment sales department, outlined the terms of the co-broking\n\nagreement in a letter to PMC on 23 April 1996. He stated in his letter that the two\n\nparties would share the advertising costs as well as PMC’s \"commission\"\n\nfrom the en bloc sale equally. PMC’s project consultant, Mr Ang Boon Hua, accepted\n\nthe terms by signing a copy of Mr Tang’s letter.4.\n\n        Tenders were called for the en bloc sale of the\n\nDevonshire properties. On 29 May 1996, Grandwin Investment Pte Ltd (\"Grandwin\")\n\nsubmitted a tender bid for the said properties and paid a tender fee of $900,000. However,\n\nthey withdrew their tender bid on 10 June 1996 and their tender fee was forfeited. PMC\n\nreceived 30% of the forfeited sum, which amounted to $270,000, under their arrangements\n\nwith the owners of the Devonshire properties. They instructed their solicitors, Ms Tang\n\n& Partners, to pay half of this sum to JLL.5.\n\n        Further attempts by PMC and JLL to jointly sell\n\nthe Devonshire properties did not bear fruit and by late August 1996, PMC’s mandate\n\nfrom the owners of these properties for an en bloc sale expired.6.\n\n        Shortly after the expiry of PMC’s mandate\n\nto sell the Devonshire properties, the owners of the said properties entered into a\n\ncollective sale agreement and appointed JLL as their marketing agents for a period of\n\nthree months with effect from 12 September 1996. JLL did not manage to sell the said\n\nproperties within the period fixed in this collective agreement.7.\n\n        The owners of the Devonshire properties did not\n\ngive up trying to achieve higher returns by having an en bloc sale of their properties. In\n\n1997, they appointed another firm of real estate agents, M/s Edmund Tie & Co, as their\n\nexclusive agents for the en bloc sale of their properties. However, no suitable buyer for\n\nthe said properties was found.8.\n\n        Two years later, in 1999, the owners of the\n\nDevonshire properties approached JLL once again to handle the en bloc sale of their\n\nproperties. In September 1999, JLL succeeding in selling these properties and earned a\n\ncommission for their work.9.\n\n        On 1 October 1999, PMC’s Mr Motha wrote to\n\nJLL, claiming that his company was entitled to half of the commission earned by JLL for\n\nthe en bloc sale of the Devonshire properties. JLL did not reply to this letter as they\n\nthought that PMC’s claim was ludicrous. More than one and a half years later, PMC\n\nwrote to JLL again on 3 May 2001 to claim half of the commission in question.10.\n\n        On 29 May 2001, PMC invoiced JLL for half of\n\nthe commission earned by JLL for the en bloc sale of the Devonshire properties in\n\nSeptember 1999. For the first time, PMC also sought a refund of the amount paid to JLL in\n\n1996 with respect to the forfeited tender fee of Grandwin. As JLL resisted both claims,\n\nPMC instituted this action against them.",
        "The commission for the en bloc\n\nsale": "11.\n\n        PMC’s claim for a share of the commission\n\nearned by JLL in 1999 for the en bloc sale of the Devonshire properties will first be\n\nconsidered. PMC asserted that an oral agreement in the middle of 1995 gave them a right to\n\nshare JLL’s commission. They contended that this oral agreement was confirmed in a\n\nletter dated 19 October 1995 from their chairman, Mr Motha, to JLL. The said letter was in\n\nthe following terms:We like to thank you for your\n\n    verbal agreement in this co-broking arrangement that in spite of and even in the event of\n\n    any interruption whatsoever including the termination/expiry of our option to find a\n\n    buyer, followed by subsequent renewal of such options, or in subsequent collective\n\n    agreements by the owners in which you are appointed to sell, this arrangement of\n\n    co-broking/[co-operation] between the two of our companies continues until the properties\n\n    or part thereof are finally sold by you as earlier verbally arranged, when we mentioned\n\n    that the costs of advertisements as well as the commission would be split 50/50 between\n\n    us.12.\n\n        There are many reasons why PMC cannot rely on\n\nthe above-mentioned letter. To begin with, JLL denied ever having received the said\n\nletter. PMC’s Mr Ang, who said that the said letter was sent by ordinary post,\n\nadmitted that JLL never acknowledged receipt of it. JLL’s former managing director,\n\nMr Pan Tien Chor, stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the letter could have\n\nbeen recently fabricated to bolster PMC’s claim.13.\n\n        Secondly, the owners of the Devonshire\n\nproperties had not appointed PMC as their agents for the en bloc sale of their properties\n\nin July 1995. As such, it is unlikely that there was an oral co-broking arrangement in\n\nJuly 1995. JLL’s Mr Pan explained the position as follows in paragraph 14 of his\n\naffidavit of evidence-in-chief:[I]n all my years of experience\n\n    as a property consultant, I have never entered into a co-broking agreement with another\n\n    property consultant where neither of us had obtained the prior authority from the owners\n\n    to market the properties. To the best of my knowledge, it is very unusual for property\n\n    consultants to do so.14.\n\n        Thirdly, even if there was an oral agreement in\n\nmid-1995, it was superseded by the terms of the written agreement between the parties in\n\nApril 1996. The terms of this written agreement, which were contained in a letter dated 23\n\nApril 1996 from JLL’s Mr Tang to PMC’s Mr Motha, were stated as follows:SALE OF LAND AT DEVONSHIRE ROADThis is to confirm that you are\n\n    agreeable to co-broke with [JLL] on the above and [JLL] will share 50% ofyourcommission.\n\n    The advertising expenses incurred for the tender sale will also be equally [borne] by\n\n    yourself and [JLL].15.\n\n        The terms of the written agreement of 23 April\n\n1996 differed from the terms of the alleged oral agreement of July 1995. In view of\n\nsection 94 of the Evidence Act, Cap 97, PMC cannot rely on oral terms which are\n\ninconsistent with the terms of this written contract to establish that they are entitled\n\nto a share of JLL’s commission for the en bloc sale of the Devonshire properties in\n\n1999.16.\n\n        A fourth reason for holding that the alleged\n\nJuly 1995 oral agreement did not exist is that Mr Motha himself made no reference to this\n\nagreement when he first wrote to JLL’s Mr Pan on 1 October 1999 to claim a share of\n\nJLL’s commission for the en bloc sale of the Devonshire properties. That letter was\n\nin the following terms:Co-broking arrangement –\n\n    Devonshire Road propertiesWe would like to congratulate you\n\n    for having finally succeeded in concluding a sale of above properties.You will recall that one day in\n\n    your office room after the first occasion when the sale did not succeed, our Mr Riechard\n\n    Ang had informed you that our company would take legal action against an owner Loh Siok\n\n    Hong.You will recall that on that\n\n    occasion you did encourage our Mr Riechard Ang not to take legal action against Loh Siok\n\n    Hong saying that if we took legal action against him and if later on the subject of the\n\n    sale of the Devonshire Road properties was revived and then succeed, our share of the\n\n    commission would not be included. But if we did not take the intended legal action, then\n\n    we have a share in the commission for a subsequent successful sale.Based on you encouragement, we\n\n    did not proceed with the intended legal action against Loh Siok Hong.Now that the sale is successful\n\n    we hope eventually you would let us have our share of the commission.We would like to thank you very\n\n    much and Best Regards.17.\n\n        If there was an oral agreement which gave PMC\n\nthe right to 50% of the commission earned by JLL in 1999, surely Mr Motha would have\n\nreferred to it in his letter. Instead, he referred to a promise made by JLL’s Mr Pan\n\nto share any future commission earned by JLL if PMC did not sue Mr Loh. If PMC was\n\nentitled to 50% of the commission to be earned by JLL for the en bloc sale of the\n\nDevonshire properties at anytime in the future, JLL would have had no right to deprive PMC\n\nof their share of the commission regardless of whether or not Mr Loh was sued. In any\n\ncase, JLL’s Mr Pan categorically denied having promised to pay anything to PMC if the\n\nlatter did not sue Mr Loh. His evidence was not challenged when he was cross-examined.18.\n\n        A fifth reason for supporting JLL’s\n\ncontention that there was no oral agreement in mid-1995, as alleged by PMC, is that the\n\nterms of the alleged agreement are so one-sided that no reasonable estate agent would have\n\naccepted them. In paragraph 9 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, JLL’s Mr Pan\n\nexplained the position in the following rather persuasive terms:Even if, which is denied, the\n\n    Plaintiffs made such a proposal to the Defendants, I would not have agreed to the same for\n\n    the following reasons (i) such a proposal was one-sided and only favoured the Plaintiffs\n\n    because if the Plaintiffs were the ones to ultimately sell the properties after the\n\n    termination/expiry of the Options, the Defendants would not be entitled to a share of\n\n    their profits; (ii) to enter into such an indefinite agreement would essentially prevent\n\n    the Defendants from marketing the properties in the future when circumstances and market\n\n    conditions changed; and (iii) in all my years of experience, neither I nor the Defendants\n\n    had ever entered into or agreed to such onerous terms in a co-broking agreement.19.\n\n        I thus hold without any hesitation whatsoever\n\nthat it has not been established that there was an oral agreement in mid-1995 on the basis\n\nof the terms of Mr Motha’s letter dated 19 October 1995. That being the case, the\n\nclaim by PMC for a share of JLL’s commission must be viewed in the context of the\n\nterms stated in JLL’s letter of 23 April 1996.20.\n\n        If all the circumstances of the case are taken\n\ninto account, JLL’s letter of 23 April 1996 does not lend any support to PMC’s\n\nclaim for a share of the commission earned by JLL in 1999 for the en bloc sale of the\n\nDevonshire properties. Admittedly, the duration of the co-broking arrangement was not\n\nmentioned in the letter of 23 April 1996. However, the context in which the co-broking\n\narrangement was made provides ample evidence as to its duration. The raison d’tre\n\nfor this co-broking arrangement was that PMC had by that date a mandate from the owners of\n\nthe Devonshire properties to sell their properties on an en bloc basis. PMC was thus the\n\nparty to be paid a commission if the en bloc sale succeeded and JLL was merely lending\n\ntheir brand name to the en bloc sale. That is why JLL’s letter of 23 April 1996\n\nspecifically referred to the sharing of PMC’s commission and not JLL’s\n\ncommission.21.\n\n        Once PMC’s mandate from the owners of the\n\nDevonshire properties with respect to the en bloc sale expired by the end of August 1996,\n\nthe question of co-broking no longer arose. JLL’s Mr Pan explained the position in\n\nparagraph 13 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief as follows:[I]n my experience as a property\n\n    consultant, changes in market conditions are inevitable and it would not be prudent for\n\n    any property consultant to be bound to a co-broke arrangement for such an indefinite time.22.\n\n        PMC did not furnish any credible evidence that\n\nJLL continued to work with them on a co-broking basis for the en bloc sale of the\n\nDevonshire properties after 1996. In fact, other estate agents, namely M/s Edmund Tie\n\n& Co, had been invited by the owners of the said properties to find an en bloc buyer\n\nfor the properties after the expiry of PMC’s mandate to sell the properties. As such,\n\nwhen JLL returned to the scene in 1999 after other estate agents had failed to sell the\n\nproperties on an en bloc basis, they were acting solely for their own benefit. In view of\n\nthis, PMC’s claim for a share of the commission earned by JLL for the en bloc sale of\n\nthe Devonshire properties in 1999 is dismissed.",
        "The forfeited Grandwin tender fee": "23.\n\n        I now turn to PMC’s claim for a refund of\n\nthe amount paid by them to JLL in July 1996 with respect to the forfeiture of\n\nGrandwin’s tender fee. PMC asserted that their agreement with JLL, as evidenced in\n\nthe latter’s letter to them dated on 23 April 1996, was only to share any commission\n\nearned and advertising expenses. They contended that as the forfeited tender fee was not a\n\n\"commission\" earned by them, JLL had no claim to it. On the other hand, JLL\n\ncontended that the term \"commission\", as used in the co-broking agreement,\n\nincludes forfeited tender fees.24.\n\n        It was common ground that PMC’s claim is\n\none for money had and received. In this context, it is worth noting that inBrisbane v\n\nDacres(1813) 5 Taunt 143, 150, Gibbs J said as follows:I think that where a man demands\n\n    money of another as a matter of right, and that other with a full knowledge of the facts\n\n    upon which the demand is founded, has paid a sum, he never can recover back the sum he has\n\n    so voluntarily paid…. If we were to hold otherwise, many inconveniences may arise;\n\n    …. I think that by submitting to the demand, he that pays the money gives it to the\n\n    person to whom he pays it, and makes it his, and closes the transaction between them.25.\n\n        PMC paid JLL half of their own share of\n\nGrandwin’s forfeited tender fee with full knowledge of the facts upon which\n\nJLL’s claim to the said fee was founded. Mr Ang’s evidence that he told Mr Pan\n\nthat PMC would subsequently seek a refund of the amount paid to JLL cannot be accepted. In\n\nfact, on 2 July 1996, PMC instructed M/s Tang & Partners to pay JLL without any hint\n\nthat the money was being paid under protest.26.\n\n        It should not be overlooked that although JLL\n\nwas paid half of the forfeited tender fee in July 1996, PMC did not complain that JLL was\n\nnot entitled to the amount paid until almost five years later. They had ample\n\nopportunities to do so earlier on. When PMC’s chairman, Mr Motha, wrote to JLL on 1\n\nOctober 1999 to claim a share of the latter’s commission for the en bloc sale of the\n\nDevonshire properties, he made no reference to Gandwin’s forfeited tender fee.\n\nFurthermore, two years later, when Mr Motha informed JLL that PMC’s lawyers will be\n\nhandling their claim for a share of JLL’s commission for the en bloc sale of the\n\nDevonshire properties, no mention was made of PMC’s right to recover the forfeited\n\ntender fee.27.\n\n        To sum up, although JLL’s letter of 23\n\nMarch 1996 could have been better drafted, I accept that it was understood that the\n\nsharing arrangement extended to forfeited tender fees. I thus hold that PMC is not\n\nentitled to claim from JLL the amount paid to the latter in July 1996 with respect to\n\nGrandwin’s forfeited tender fee.",
