        "Introduction": "1       The\naccused, Purushothaman A/L Subramaniam, was charged with the importation\nof diamorphine into Singapore as follows:[note: 1] You, Purushothaman A/L Subramaniam, are charged that you, on the 26th day of\nMarch 2012 at or about 7.15 pm, at Bike Arrival Hall, Woodlands\nCheckpoint, Singapore, in motorcycle JLR 1838, did import a controlled\ndrug specified in Class A of The First Schedule of the Misuse of\nDrugs Act, (CAP. 185), to wit, three (3) packets of granular substances\nbelieved to be Diamorphine, weighing approximately 1389.39 grams\nwithout authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder\nand you have thereby committed an offence under section 7 and punishable\nunder section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (CAP. 185). As the amount of diamorphine imported by the accused exceeds\nthe statutory limit of 15g as prescribed under the Second Schedule\nof the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), this\noffence is punishable with death. 2       The\naccused claims trial to the charge. His defence is that he did not know\nwhat was inside the black bundle that he was asked to carry into Singapore.[note: 2]",
        "The Prosecution’s case": "3       The\nProsecution adduced evidence that the accused is a 21-year-old male\nMalaysian who was staying in Johor Bahru.[note: 3]At the time of his arrest, he was\na “vegetable lorry stacker”.[note: 4]",
        "At Woodlands Checkpoint Counter\n43": "4       On\n26 March 2012, at about 7.13pm,[note: 5]the accused rode his Malaysian-registered\nmotorcycle bearing registration number JLR 1838 into Singapore via\nMotorcycle Arrival Booth 47, Woodlands Checkpoint.[note: 6]He\nproduced his passport to PW11, Corporal Muhammad Shafiq bin Mohamed,[note: 7]the\nPrimary Screening Officer with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority\n(“ICA”). PW11 then screened the accused’s particulars using the\nICA computer. He was alerted by a notification to stop the accused\nand refer him to an enforcement agency.[note: 8] 5       PW11\nthen told the accused to switch off his motorcycle engine and to\nhand over his motorcycle key. At the same time, the ICA Quick Response Team\nwas activated.[note: 9]The accused, together with his passport\nand motorcycle key, was handed over to PW12, Corporal Lim Lian Chuan\nof the ICA Quick Response Team, who soon arrived at the scene.[note: 10]",
        "At the ICA Arrival Car Secondary\nTeam Office": "6       The\naccused was asked by PW12 to push his motorcycle to the ICA Arrival\nCar Secondary Team Office. He parked his motorcycle at motorcycle\nlot A39, one of the parking lots located outside the office.[note: 11]In the\nmeantime, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) at\nthe Woodlands Checkpoint were alerted and the accused was handed\nover to them for investigation.[note: 12]",
        "The search": "7       The\naccused was told by one of the CNB officers to push his motorcycle\nto the Police K9 (dog unit) garage.[note: 13]A physical search was conducted\non the motorcycle. PW16, Corporal Vengedesh Raj Nainar s/o Nagarajan,\nrecovered a black bundle from the motorcycle.[note: 14]Thereafter, the accused was immediately\nplaced under arrest. When PW17, Staff Sergeant Chia Eu Foong,[note: 15]made a small cut on the black bundle\nin the accused’s presence, a brownish granular substance was seen.\nA physical examination and a K9 search (using sniffer dog) of the\naccused revealed nothing on him. The backscatter scan performed\non the motorcycle also revealed no other incriminating evidence.[note: 16]",
        "Accused’s first statement on\nthe discovery of the six bundles in the motorcycle seat": "8       In\nthe CNB office at Woodlands Checkpoint, PW14, Staff Sergeant Marlina\nBinte Djumadi, asked the accused questions about the black bundle found\non his motorcycle.[note: 17]PW16 acted as the interpreter\nas the accused chose to answer the questions in Tamil. The exchange\nwas as follows:[note: 18] PW16.What is this? ([accused] was shown the exhibit recovered)A.I don’t know.Q.Whose bike is this?A.Mine.Q.Who does the (exhibit) black bundle belong to?A.I don’t\nknow. I came here (S’pore) to buy shoes.   The Prosecution admitted this statement as well as his other\nstatements given to the investigation officer as the accused confirmed\nthat they were voluntarily taken from him without any inducement,\nthreat or promise.",
        "Analysis of the six bundles": "9       There\nwere three packets of the brownish granular substance found inside\nthe black bundle. These were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”)\nfor analysis. They were labelled “A1A1”, “A1B1” and “A1C1” respectively.\nThe HSA analysis revealed the following: (a)     A1A1:\nThe gross weight of the granular/powdery substance was 460.2g and\nit contained no less than 24.97g of diamorphine at a confidence\nlevel of 99.9999%. (b)     A1B1:\nThe gross weight of the granular/powdery substance was 459.0g and\nit contained no less than 25.25g of diamorphine at a confidence\nlevel of 99.9999%. (c)     A1C1:\nThe gross weight of the granular/powdery substance was 456.0g and\nit contained no less than 25.19g of diamorphine at a confidence\nlevel of 99.9999%.",
        "The presumption of possession\nand knowledge of the drug under s 18 of the Act": "10     The\nProsecution relies on the statutory presumptions under ss 18(1)(a) and 18(2) of the Act.[note: 19]Under s 18(1)(a), the accused is presumed to have been\nin possession of the diamorphine found in the motorcycle while under\ns 18(2), he is further presumed to have known of the nature of the\ndiamorphine. This, combined with the fact that the accused physically\nbrought the diamorphine hidden in the motorcycle into Singapore,\nestablishes the offence of importation of a controlled drug with which\nhe was charged.[note: 20]",
        "The accused’s case": "11     The\naccused seeks to rebut both the presumptions of possession and knowledge\nunder ss 18(1)(a) and 18(2) of the\nAct respectively.[note: 21]He alleged\nthat he did not know that the black bundle concealed in his motorcycle\ncontained diamorphine. His story is that a person called “Prabha”\nplaced drugs in his motorcycle without his knowledge. Therefore, he\nis not wilfully blind.[note: 22]Prabha was later identified to\nbe one Prabagaran a/l Srivijayan. He was arrested based on a telephone\nnumber given to the police by the accused.[note: 23]",
        "The accused’s background": "12     The\naccused comes from a family of six. He has a mother, three elder sisters\nand an elder brother. His father is deceased. The accused has been the\nfamily’s sole breadwinner since the age of 12, initially working\nin a job involving marriage decoration in Perak.[note: 24]He\nfirst started working in Singapore at a warehouse situated at Jalan\nPenjuru in January 2011, doing packing. He was paid about $600 a\nmonth, out of which he would send RM500 back to his family. However,\nhe ceased working as a packer around February or March 2011 as it\nwas hard work and he felt that he was not being paid sufficiently.[note: 25] 13     Subsequently,\nthe accused found a job loading and unloading goods from lorries\nin Johor Bahru. For this, he was paid between RM50 to RM60 per day.\nHe would send back between RM300 to RM400 per month to his family\nin Perak.[note: 26]From December 2011 to\nJanuary 2012, he worked as a vegetable packer in Johor Bahru and\nwas paid RM800 per month. He would send back RM500 to his family\nin Perak.[note: 27]",
        "The meeting between the accused\nand Prabha": "14     Around\nFebruary 2012, the accused’s mother needed a heart surgery. He did\nnot have money to finance the operation. It was around this time that\nthe accused went out for drinks with his colleague and met Prabha\nfor the first time at a Chinese coffeeshop in Johor Bahru.[note: 28]Prabha\nhad been drinking with three other friends at that time and the\naccused joined them.[note: 29]However,\nthe accused did not drink with them as he was sad because he did\nnot have the money to pay for his mother’s operation.[note: 30]Prabha then asked the accused\nwhat was wrong and persisted in knowing what was troubling the accused.\nEventually, the accused told Prabha that he needed money for his\nmother’s operation.[note: 31]When they\nleft, Prabha comforted the accused by telling him “The god will\nsave your mother”.[note: 32]",
        "The RM10,000 loan": "15     Two\ndays later, the accused met Prabha in a Hindu temple. Prabha enquired\nwhether the accused had obtained the money that he needed. The accused\nsaid that he had not. 16     Prabha\nthen offered to help the accused and they exchanged contact details.[note: 33]Prabha told the accused that\nhe would let him know in two days’ time whether any help was forthcoming.\nHowever, the accused called him two days later instead. Prabha informed\nthe accused that he could lend him the money but the accused would\nhave to help him in return for the loan.[note: 34]Prabha wanted\nthe accused to bring “stuff” into Singapore for him.[note: 35]However, Prabha was evasive\nwhen the accused asked him about what “stuff” was to be brought\ninto Singapore.[note: 36]The\naccused did not agree immediately and only agreed after a few meetings\nwith Prabha. The reason why the accused agreed to help Prabha was\nbecause the accused felt indebted to Prabha for the loan which financed\nhis mother’s operation.[note: 37] 17     According\nto the accused, he agreed to help Prabha only once.[note: 38]However, after the first time\nthe accused did the job, he disclosed to Prabha that his mother\nneeded RM500 a month for her post-operation medical expenses.[note: 39]Prabha then offered to pay the\naccused RM500 per job if he was willing to do the same job subsequently.\nThe accused agreed as “there was no other way to save [his] mother.”[note: 40]",
        "The modus operandi for the importation\nof the “stuff” into Singapore": "18     The\naccused’s account of the modus operandi was as follows. First, the accused\nwould pass the motorcycle to Prabha in Johor Bahru. Prabha would ride\naway with the motorcycle for about one to two hours before returning to\nthe accused’s place. The accused would then be informed to take\nback the motorcycle, no questions asked.[note: 41]When he asked Prabha\nabout what he was transporting, Prabha would refuse to tell him.[note: 42]He would then ride his motorcycle\ninto Singapore, clear immigration within 30 minutes, and head towards\nWoodlands MRT station,[note: 43]where the accused would call Prabha. 19     After\nreceiving the accused’s call, Prabha would get a person to meet the\naccused. About an hour later, the person would either arrive in\na car or a taxi. He would then ride away with the accused’s motorcycle\nbefore returning it in about half an hour. Prabha would then give\na call to the accused, to inform him about the whereabouts of the\nmotorcycle. The motorcycle key would be left in the accused’s motorcycle\nbasket. The accused would then ride the motorcycle back to Johor\nBahru[note: 44]and be paid RM500. The accused\nwould send all the money back to his family in Perak because his\nmother needed about RM600 a month for her medical expenses.[note: 45]",
        "The accused’s lack of knowledge": "20     The\nabove went on for about a month until the accused was stopped by\nthe police officers at Woodlands Checkpoint on 26 March 2012. It\nwas then that he became worried as the officers discovered a black\nbundle in his motorcycle which he thought could be drugs.[note: 46]He\nsuspected that Prabha might have used the screwdriver under his\nmotorcycle seat to unscrew the plastic cover and placed the drugs\ninside a compartment of the motorcycle.[note: 47] 21     The\naccused also testified that he did not suspect anything amiss about\nthe RM500 he received each time he sent “stuff” into Singapore or\nthe RM10,000 loan that Prabha extended to him. This was because\nhe was very concerned about his mother’s surgery.[note: 48]Also,\nhe would check his motorcycle each time after Prabha returned it\nto him and before he rode it into Singapore. He never noticed anything\nunusual, although he suspected that Prabha might have concealed\ncigarettes in his motorcycle. 22     Lastly,\nthe accused denied ownership of the motorcycle when he was administered\nthe Notice of Warning under s 23 of the CPC[note: 49]but\nlater explained that it was a lie that he had made up as he was\nscared of being arrested.[note: 50]He did not call any witnesses\nin his defence.",
        "The issue: Whether the accused\nknew of the drugs in his motorcycle": "23     It\nis undisputed that the accused was arrested on 26 March 2012 and the\nblack bundle was found concealed in the accused’s motorcycle. He\nwas caught red-handed. The accused also agree that all his statements\ngiven in the course of the investigations were voluntarily given\nwithout any inducement, threat or promise from the recording officers\nor any other persons. Theactusreusof the offence is undisputed. What\nis disputed is themens reaelement\nof the offence. This is where the accused denies knowledge of the\ndiamorphine hidden in his motorcycle.",
        "Presumption of possession and\nknowledge of diamorphine hidden in the accused’s motorcycle": "24     The\nProsecution relies on the presumption of possession and knowledge\nunder s 18(2) of the Act to show the presence ofmens\nrea,ie, that the accused\nwas assumed to know that diamorphine was hidden in his motorcycle.\nSection 18(2) is as follows: (2)    Any\nperson who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in\nhis possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed\nto have known the nature of that drug. 25     In\norder for the accused to rebut this presumption, he has to show\non a balance of probabilities that he did not know the nature of\nthe controlled drug referred to in the charge:Nagaenthrana/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor[2011]\n4 SLR 1156 (“Nagaenthran”) at [23].\nThis requires the court to evaluate the evidence to ascertain whether\nthere was wilful blindness on the part of the accused. Thus, I shall\nfirst deal with the law on wilful blindness.",
        "The law on wilful blindness": "26     InTan Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor[2008]\n1 SLR(R) 1 (“Tan Kiam Peng”), the\ncourt held that wilful blindness is equivalent to actual knowledge\nat law (at [104]): … This is entirely understandable as well\nas logical and practical simply because the court cannot read a\nperson’s mind (seeperYong CJ inKoo Pui Fong,supra,\nas well asperLord Esher MR inBruntonat [109] below). As we have just\nmentioned, a clear admission is going to be extremely rare. The proof\nof an actual situation of actual knowledge is, in the circumstances, going\nto be equally rare. This isa fortiorithe\ncase in so far as offences under the Act are concerned. Accused\npersons are hardly likely to admit to possessing actual knowledge\nand can (indeed, will) easily disavow such knowledge even if it\nexisted, given the surreptitious nature inherent in drug offences\nas well as the draconian penalties that are imposed on conviction.\nIn any event, as we have already noted,wilful\nblindness has, in any event, always been treated, in law, as actual\nknowledge. … [emphasis added] Wilful blindness is also a fact-sensitive enquiry. It should\nbe premised on a strong factual basis and has to meet a high threshold:Khor Soon Lee v Public Prosecutor[2011]\n3 SLR 201 at [20]. What are the suspicious circumstances\nthat give rise to a duty to inquire? 27     The\nfinding of wilful blindness must be based on a factual finding that gives\nrise to a suspicion that a certain state of affairs exists. It has\nbeen described as “an evidential matter to be taken into account\nwhen deciding if the necessary knowledge existed”: Chan Wing Cheong,\n“Culpability in the Misuse of Drugs Act: Wilful Blindness, the Reasonable\nPerson and a Duty to Check” (2013) 25 SAcLJ 110 (“Culpability in\nthe Misuse of Drugs Act”) at p 116. 28     A\nperson is wilfully blind when the circumstances are such as to warrant\nhis suspicion and give rise to a duty by him to make further enquiries.\nInTan Kiam Pengat [125] and [127],\nit was stated that: … [S]uspicion islegally sufficient to ground\na finding of wilful blindness provided the relevant factual matrix\nwarrants such a findingandthe\naccused deliberately decides to turn a blind eye. … However, the\ncaveat is that alow levelof suspicion\npremised on a factual matrix that wouldnotlead\na person to make further inquiries would be insufficient to ground\na finding of wilful blindness … [T]hat level of suspicionmust then lead to a refusal to investigate further… … … [W]ilful blindness is a combination of\nsuspicioncoupled withadeliberatedecision not to make further\ninquiries, whereas the recklessness that has been referred to by\nProf Williams refers to recklessness in terms of the accused’s conduct\nin the context of circumstanceswhich would\nnot otherwise have aroused suspicionon the part of the\naccused. We think that it is important to reiterate this point because\nit is possible, on another interpretation, to argue that the decision\nby the accused not to make further inquiries when faced with suspicious\ncircumstances may be characterised as reckless conduct. We donotagree with such an argument and characterisation.\nSuch conduct is wilful blindness that entails adeliberatedecision\nnot to make further inquiries when faced with suspicious circumstances.\n… [emphasis in original] 29     However,\nnot all facts will give rise to suspicion which necessitates a duty\nto inquire on the part of the accused. It is important to bear in\nmind that wilful blindness is distinct from recklessness. An accused\nisonlywilfully blind if there\nis suspicion coupled with a deliberate decision not to make further\ninquiries. This is opposed to a situation where the accused was merely\nreckless and faced with circumstances which would not otherwise arouse\nsuspicion on the part of the accused:Tan Kiam\nPengat [127]. 30     In\nGlanville Williams,Criminal Law(Stevens\n& Sons: 2nd Ed, 1961) at p 159, the learned author comments\nthat in relation to wilful blindness, the accused’s calculated steps\nmust be so as to “cheat the administration of justice”. Prof Chan\nWing Cheong (“Prof Chan”) in his article Culpability in the Misuse\nof Drugs Act at p 117 adds that: The requirement of a “deliberate” decision\nnot to make further inquiries shows that it is those who choose\nto avoid knowledge in order to escape punishment that are brought\nwithin the concept of wilful blindness. … 31     Therefore,\nin order to ascertain whether the accused is wilfully blind, it\nis critical to inquire whether the accused by his conduct had chosen\nnot to make enquiry to deliberately avoid knowledge and elude punishment.\nIn the words of Yong Pung How CJ inChiaw Wai\nOnn v Public Prosecutor[1997] 2 SLR(R) 233 at [45]: [W]here the facts obviously point to one\nresult, and the accused must have appreciated it but shuts his eyes\nto the truth, then together with the other evidence adduced, this\ncan form a very compelling part of the evidence to infer the requisite\nguilty knowledge. Thus, if a man says to himself,“Despite all\nthat I have seen and heard, I refuse to accept what my brain tells\nme is obvious”, it is an absurdity to say that he does not have\nthe relevant knowledge simply because he chooses to practise Nelsonian\nblindness and delude himself.[emphasis added] Is the accused’s wilful blindness\nassessed on an objective or subjective standard? 32     What\nmust a person be taken to know before a duty to inquire will arise?\nThe reasonable person in the circumstances “would have suspicions and\nwould have made enquiries or take other steps to allay his suspicions. There\nmust be suspicion and intention; carelessness or thoughtlessness\nwill not suffice”:Public Prosecutor v Azman\nbin Mohamed Sanwan[2010] SGHC 196 at [147]. 33     InPublic Prosecutor v Sng Chun Heng and another[2011]\n3 SLR 437 at [75], the court held that the assessment of wilful\nblindness has to be on the basis of a person who has “average intelligence\nand honesty”. However, the level of knowledge which the accused\nhad is also relevant and is subjective as the Court of Appeal held\ninNagaenthranat [30]: … [Wilful blindness] is a subjective concept,\nin that the extent of knowledge in question is the knowledge of\nthe accused and not that which might be postulated of a hypothetical\nperson in the position of the accused (although this last-mentioned\npoint may not be an irrelevant consideration) (ibid).\n…",
        "Was there wilful blindness by\nthe accused for the presence of the diamorphine hidden in his motorcycle?": "34     Do\nthe circumstances in this case lead to the conclusion that the accused\nwas wilfully blinded to the presence of the diamorphine hidden in his\nmotorcycle? The factors that pointed towards\nthe accused’s wilful blindness (I)   The modus operandi\nwas highly suspicious to even the accused and that pointed to his\nwilful blindness 35     The\naccused was granted a loan of RM10,000 by Prabha for his mother’s\nheart operation. In return, the accused had to bring things for Prabha\nto Singapore. For each successful delivery the accused was paid RM500.\nThe delivery was done in highly suspicious circumstances as described\nby the accused in his statement to the IO:[note: 51] … Each time before I enter into Singapore,\nI will pass my motorcycle to ‘Prabha’ and he will put the things\ninside. He will ride away on it and I will wait for about 1 to 2\nhours for him at my place in Johor Bahru. He will call me to take\nback the motorcycle when he is done. I will then ride the motorcycle and\ngo to Singapore. It takes me about 30 minutes to reach Woodlands Checkpoint. I will then clear immigration and proceed\nto ride towards Woodlands MRT. When I reach Woodlands MRT, I will\ncall ‘Prabha’ and then he will get someone to meet me. Each time\nthe person will either drive a car or come in a taxi. Normally I\nwill wait for about an hour before the person arrives. A Malay person\nwill come to meet me but not always the same person. The person\nwill then ride my motorcycle away before returning in about half\nan hour. If he came in a car he will park it and then ride off.\nSometimes it is at a car park, sometimes it is at the vicinity of\nWoodlands MRT. When the Malay person returns me my motorcycle, ‘Prohba’\nwill call me to tell me where the motorcycle is. The keys will be\nleft in the basket of my motorcycle for me. I will then ride off\nand go back to Johor Bahru. When I wait for my motorcycle, I will\ngo shop around the Woodlands area. 36     This\nhappened in the same manner on the day the accused was arrested\nwhere the accused stated in his statement that:[note: 52] On 26 March 2012, ‘Probha’ called me on\nmy handphone at about 4pm and told me he wanted to talk to me. He\nwill drive a car to my house in Johor Bahru to meet me. He took\nmy motorcycle keys and tell me that he was borrowing my motorcycle\nfor a while. That happened at about 5pm when he arrived. He came\nback after about an hour later. I then took over the keys after\n6pm. I then enter Singapore after 7pm and was then stopped by the checkpoint\nofficers. 37     The\naccused himself admitted to being suspicious about the above modus\noperandi. He alleged that he had asked Prabha repeatedly about what\nhe was transporting. He said under cross-examination that “[h]e (Prabha)\ntold me not to ask this question. ‘Just help [him].’”[note: 53]He also admitted to being suspicious\nand searched his motorcycle each time the motorcycle was returned\nto him for him to make the delivery in Singapore although he ultimately\nfound nothing suspicious.[note: 54] 38     Besides\nthe accused’s own suspicions being aroused, any reasonable person\nin the accused’s shoes would have found the whole arrangement very\nsuspicious. The accused did not deny that the manner in which he\nwas asked to make delivery of things to Singapore subsequently caused\nhim to be suspicious of Prabha.[note: 55]This caused the accused\nto try to find out from Prabha, every time he was asked to make\nthe delivery, the nature of the thing that he was transporting,\nalthough to no avail. In the circumstances, he must have known that\nPrabha was being evasive and had something to hide. Why else would\nPrabha not want to tell him what “stuff” he was bringing into Singapore\nand refuse to tell him what it was despite his persistence? In my\nview, a reasonable person in the accused’s shoes would have found\nthe arrangement very suspicious. 39     Next,\nI find it hard to believe that the accused checked his motorcycle each\ntime Prabha returned it to him to bring the “stuff” into Singapore. When\nI inspected the motorcycle, I found that there were not many hidden places\non the motorcycle in which the “stuff” could be concealed. It would also\nnot take too much time to search for these places. Yet even though\nthe accused did more than 20 runs for Prabha and even after he checked\nhis motorcycle before each run was performed, he found nothing.\nI find this difficult to believe. If the accused really searched\nhis motorcycle, he would have easily discovered the “stuff” that\nPrabha had asked him to deliver, especially since he believed that\nPrabha had asked him to smuggle cigarettes. It is incredible that\nhe could not find the “stuff” on all those runs when he knew that\nPrabha had asked him to do the deliveries and paid him RM500 for\neach delivery. As such, I reject the accused’s evidence that he checked\nhis motorcycle each time before he made the trip. (II)   Only one of the\nscrews for the plastic cover, Exhibit C, was used so as to facilitate\neasy retrieval of the drugs 40     The\naccused said he failed to discover the drugs because he did not remove\nthe plastic cover under the basket as he said in his testimony that\nhe did not know how to remove it.[note: 56] 41     I\nfind that difficult to accept. The motorcycle is a small one and\nthe accused had owned it for more than a year. Thus, it is reasonable\nto expect him to know every visible compartment on the motorcycle,\nwhich is not many to begin with. The drugs were found hidden in\na compartment near the motorcycle engine under a black plastic cover,\nExhibit C. This could be easily removed as it was only secured with\na screw. It is usually secured with three screws which can be easily\nremoved with a screwdriver that was kept in the compartment under\nthe motorcycle seat. However, the evidence showed that on the day\nof the accused’s arrest at the Woodlands Checkpoint, the two arms\nof the plastic cover were not secured with screws. The plastic cover\nwas only secured by the centre screw. It appears that this was deliberate\nto facilitate the removal of the cover and the retrieval of the drugs. 42     I\nfurther note that photographs PH14 and PH15 show the locations for\nsecuring the two long arms of the plastic cover below the seat of\nthe motorcycle. One of the locations was circled by the accused\nin photograph PH14. The other screw point is located opposite to\nthat. This is in the foreground of the photograph. However, one\nof the long arms of the plastic cover could not be screwed to the\nmotorcycle as the anchorage point had broken off. Therefore, although\nthere are three places to screw Exhibit C to the motorcycle, there\nwere only two screw anchorage points that were useable. The third\nanchorage point at one of the long arms of the plastic cover was\ndamaged. Therefore, I find that the Exhibit C was secured in this way\nso as to facilitate the easy retrieval of the drugs. (III)   The arrangement\nof the metal structure that supported the basket of the motorcycle\nwas set up for easy removal 43     Under\nnormal circumstances, the motorcycle basket would be secured by\nthree screws. The two sides of the basket would be secured to the motorcycle\nwith a screw each. The bottom of the basket would be supported at\nthe centre by a metal structure which shared the same screw point\nas Exhibit C. However, I noticed that the metal support of the basket\nwas not secured to the motorcycle. Instead, the screw hole of the\nmetal support had a screw and nut, giving the impression that it\nwas screwed to Exhibit C to the motorcycle. The arrangement seems\nto facilitate easy access to the engine compartment underneath Exhibit\nC, making it easy for one to retrieve the package hidden within\nby enabling easy removal of Exhibit C. At the same time, it would\ngive the impression that Exhibit C and the basket were secured together.\nThis would ensure that no suspicion would arise at the customs checkpoint. 44     The\nDefence submitted that it is unbelievable that an alleged drug trafficker\nriding a motorcycle from Johor Bahru into Singapore with drugs hidden\nin the engine compartment of the motorcycle would cross the Causeway\nwithout securing the cover which concealed the drugs.[note: 57]On that\nbasis, he urged the court to take the Prosecution’s evidence with\na “pinch of salt”.[note: 58]I disagree with the Defence. In\nmy view, it is entirely logical from the accused’s perspective to\nride the motorcycle into Singapore with Exhibit C secured firmly\nwith a screw so as to facilitate its easy removal to retrieve the\ndrugs hidden therein. If all anchorage points were securely screwed,\nit would be troublesome to remove Exhibit C especially this was done\non a regular basis for Prabha. (IV)   The accused’s DNA\npresent on Exhibit B2 pointed towards his wilful blindness 45     Fourth,\nthe accused made strenuous attempts to distance himself from Exhibit\nC. This is obvious as the diamorphine was found hidden under it.\nHe submits that he did not know how to remove Exhibit C. 46     I\nreject his submission. It was puzzling how the accused would not have\nknown how to remove Exhibit C while at the same time testifying\nthat he knew how to remove the basket above it.[note: 59]His submission also goes against\nthe direct evidence present: his DNA was found on Exhibit B2, a screw\nwhich was used to secure one of the two long arms of the plastic cover.[note: 60]His\nexplanation as to why his DNA was found on Exhibit B2 was inadequate;\nhe merely said: “I don’t know”.[note: 61] 47     Why\nwas the accused’s DNA found on Exhibit B2? The accused must have\ncome into contact with it or his DNA would not have been present. This\nscrew was found together with the screwdriver in the same compartment\nunder the motorcycle seat. It had been used to secure one of the\ntwo arms of the plastic cover that hid the drugs. From this, I infer\nthat the accused was not telling the truth. He had said he did not\nknow how to remove Exhibit C. However, if he could remove this screw,\nExhibit B2, which was used to secure the plastic cover, why he did\nnot check the engine compartment, unless he knew that the black\nbundle of diamorphine was hidden there? In my opinion, therefore,\nthis pointed towards the accused’s wilful blindness. The factors that failed to rebut\nthe presumption of wilful blindness (I)   The Defence’s submission\nregarding the two screws allegedly unaccounted for was irrelevant\nand did not rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge 48     First,\nthe Defence submits that there were two screws besides Exhibits B2\nand B3, which were unaccounted for and it was questionable what\nhad happened to the two screws which were meant to secure the left\nand right side of the basket.[note: 62]His submission is that the Prosecution’s\nevidence was inconsistent because: (a)     PW17,\nin his examination-in-chief, had stated that not all the screws\nwere intact and two of them were not attached to the motorcycle.[note: 63]Under\ncross-examination, PW17 also agreed that he had not seen any screw\nattached to Exhibit C.[note: 64] (b)     PW17’s\ntestimony contradicted the evidence of PW24, Lee Tien Shiong Herman,\nwhich indicated that one of the exhibits was described as “A screw\nattached to exhibit C”. Therefore, in the circumstances, Exhibit B3 could not have\nany probative value with respect to the accused’s knowledge of the\nhidden drugs in his motorcycle.[note: 65] 49     Those\nfacts are immaterial to my findings given that the Defence’s case\ndoes not dispute that theactusreushas been made out. In the Prosecution’s\nsubmissions, the circumstances surrounding the handling of the exhibits\nwere clear: Exhibits B1, B2 and B3 were seized by PW19, Staff Sergeant\nLow Kok Wee Wilson, on the instructions of the investigating officer,\nPW24.[note: 66]That was corroborated by PW19\nand 24’s statements. The Defence did not raise any objections to\nthose statements.[note: 67]In\nmy view, the issue about the screws is not relevant as theactusreusis\nnot disputed: the accused was caught red-handed with the diamorphine.\nTherefore, this submission is unmeritorious and fails to rebut the\npresumption of knowledge. (II)   The lack of DNA\nprofiling on two other screws did not rebut the presumptions of\npossession and knowledge 50     Second,\nthe Defence submits that besides Exhibits B2 and B3, the Prosecution\nhad chosen not to send two other screws for DNA analysis “for reasons\nbest known to them”.[note: 68]Since the Prosecution\nhad chosen not to send those other screws for DNA profiling to establish\nPrabha’s involvement, it would go some way to corroborating the\naccused’s version of the story that it was Prabha who had hidden\nthe drugs in the motorcycle without his knowledge.[note: 69]If\nDNA profiling had been done on those two other screws, the results\nmight have been in favour of the Defence. 51     The\nsubmission is speculative. The burden of proof is on the Defence to\nrebut the presumption of knowledge. The Defence’s submission was\nbuilt on nothing more than mere speculation that the results of\nany DNA profiling test done would be favourable to the accused.\nThat, however, cannot be the basis on which he can rebut the presumption\nof knowledge. Even if this speculation was true, it merely confirmed\nthe accused’s story that he was a courier for Prabha. It does not\nexonerate the accused from the offence. (III)   The accused’s suspicions\nthat he was transporting cigarettes failed to rebut the presumptions 52     The\naccused stated in his testimony in court that he had suspected that\nwhat he was transporting were cigarettes. This was because of the empty\ncigarette cartons that he had seen in Prabha’s car.[note: 70]I\nam of the view that the accused’s defence was unreliable and an\nafterthought. (A)   The accused had every\nopportunity to disclose his suspicions of transporting cigarettes\nduring the investigation stage 53     The\naccused did not disclose in any of his statements to the CNB that he\nsuspected that he was smuggling cigarettes for Prabha.[note: 71]When asked why\nhe did not inform the Investigation Officer (“IO”) of his suspicions,\nhe said that the IO did not ask him and if he had been asked, he\nwould have told him.[note: 72]I am not\nconvinced by the accused’s explanation as he was confronted with\nthe drugs found in his motorcycle and yet he neither informed the\nIO nor the CNB officers that he suspected it to be cigarettes and\nnot drugs. When the charge was read to him in his cautioned statement,\nhe also did not disclose his suspicions but instead lied to the CNB\nofficer:[note: 73] I do not know how it came to be in my motorcycle.\nIt is my elder brother who uses the motorcycle. Only today I brought\nthe motorcycle into Singapore. That is all. 54     The\naccused in his statement to the IO also said:[note: 74] When the officers opened the black bundle\nand I was able to see what was inside, I became very scared. I knew\nI had done the wrong job. I did not know what it was but I thought\nthat it could have been drugs. 55     The\naccused later told the court about his suspicions that the drugs were\ncigarettes when he was being cross-examined. The reason for his disclosure\nwas because he had the opportunity to do so then. If it was opportunity\nthat he was looking for, the sessions with the IO were excellent opportunities\nfor the accused to inform the IO about his suspicion that the “stuff”\nthat he was delivering for Prabha might be cigarettes. However, despite\nthose opportunities, the accused only said that he suspected the “stuff”\nto be drugs. In the circumstances, I reject the accused’s defence\nthat he was suspicious that what he was transporting were cigarettes. (B)   The accused’s evidence\nregarding his state of mind was hard to believe 56     Second,\nwith respect to his state of mind, the accused was asked in cross-examination\nwhether it occurred to him that he must have been bringing in very\nexpensive goods since Prabha had loaned him RM10,000 and given him\nRM500 for each delivery. His reply was: “It did not occur [to] me\nbecause of my mother’s operation”.[note: 75] 57     I\nfind the above hard to believe and have grave doubts about whether his\nsuspicions that he was transporting cigarettes were genuine. When asked\nabout how it was possible to squeeze cigarette cartons into the\nsmall compartment, the accused replied that he did “not have the\nability to think”.[note: 76]While the\naccused’s concern for his mother’s health condition and medical\nexpenses is understandable, how could he suspect that he was smuggling\ncigarettes for Prabha when he was paid RM500 for each trip? The\nquantity of cigarettes would have to be very large in order to justify\nthe trip and that consideration must have featured in the accused’s\nmind at some point in time. That he was wilfully blind was clear\nwhen he told the IO that he was suspicious of Prabha one week before\nhis arrest.[note: 77]The accused’s statement\nis reproduced as follows:[note: 78] A week before my arrest, I started to get\nsuspicious that ‘Prabha’ was paying me RM500 for each trip into\nSingapore to deliver stuff. I got suspicious because he was sending\nme over to Singapore in the morning. I was also suspicious that\n‘Prabha’ was taking my motorcycle and then returning it an hour\nlater and the same thing happening here in Singapore by the Malay person.\nHowever, because of my mother’s illness, I did not take it seriously. 58     For\nthese reasons, I find that the facts irresistibly point towards\nthe accused’s wilful blindness and the presumption of knowledge\nhas not been rebutted.",
        "Similar fact evidence": "59     In\nthe course of the accused’s cross-examination, the Prosecution enquired\nabout his previous deliveries for Prabha which were referred to\nin his examination-in-chief. The Defence objected to the line of\nquestioning on the basis that it was similar fact evidence and therefore\nprejudicial to the accused. I overruled the objection and my reasons\nare as follows. 60     The\npurpose for which the evidence is sought to be admitted is important.\nThe Court of Appeal inTan Meng Jee v Public\nProsecutor[1996] 2 SLR(R) 178 explained at [37]–[42]\nwhen similar facts evidence can be used and held that: 37    It\nis important to establish the purpose for which the evidence was relied\nupon in order that we can discern its relevance under the Evidence\nAct and, therefore, its admissibility. … 38    The Evidence Act, as envisaged byStephen, admits such evidence under ss\n14 and 15. Section 14 states: Facts showing the existence of any state\nof mind, such as intention, knowledge, good faith, negligence, rashness,\nill-will or good-will towards any particular person, or showing\nthe existence of any state of body or bodily feeling, are relevant\nwhen the existence of any such state of mind or body or bodily feeling\nis in issue or relevant. 39    And\ns 15 says: When there is a question whether an act\nwas accidental or intentional or done with a particular knowledge\nor intention, the fact that such act formed part of a series of\nsimilar occurrences, in each of which the person doing the act was\nconcerned, is relevant. 40    It\nwill be noted that these sections identify a number of issues to\nwhich similar fact evidence is relevant. Since, in this case, the\nsimilar fact evidence has been used to support a finding as to the\nmental state of the appellant when he was engaged in the physical\nact of transporting, they are potentially relevant under these two\nsections. Whether it is possible for the law to accommodate the\nuse of evidence going to the proof of a matter not identified in\nss 14 and 15 is not in issue in the present case and we do not think\nit advisable to pronounce on that matter more than is necessary\nat the present time. What is in issue is whether the principles\npertaining to similar fact evidence allow the use of the said evidence\non the facts before us. 41    The underlying rationale for the rule\nexcluding similar fact evidence is that to allow it in every instance\nis to risk the conviction of an accused not on the evidence relating\nto the facts but because of past behaviour or disposition towards\ncrime. Such evidence without doubt has a prejudicial effect against the\naccused.However, at times, similar facts can\nbe so probative of guilt that to ignore it via the imposition of\na blanket prohibition would unduly impair the interests of justice. [emphasis added] 61     Similar\nfact evidence was admitted inNg Beng Siang\nand Others v Public Prosecutor[2003] SGCA 17 (“Ng Beng Siang”) where the probative value\nof admitting the evidence outweighed its prejudicial value against\nthe accused. The Court of Appeal held at [40]–[42] that: 41    In\nour judgment, it was clear that the previous incident had more probative\nvalue than its prejudicial effect for two reasons. First, the defence\nof Ng to the present charge was that he did not know the bundles\ncontained drugs. Thus evidence on the previous occasion where Ng\ndid a similar errand for Ken, and the unusual manner in which the\nthings were to be delivered, went to show that Ng could not be ignorant\nof what he was conveying for Ken. Second, Ng recognised Rosdi and\nRoseley because he had seen them on his first trip. This went to\nestablish that Rosdi and Roseley were the two persons to whom Ng\nwas to pass the haversack. The similar fact evidence was clearly\nconnected with the issues before the court. We would also add that\nin the course of the trial, the judge had made it clear that he\nwould not take into account the potentially prejudicial effect of\nthis similar fact evidence as suggesting that Ng had the propensity\nto commit the offence of drug trafficking. 42    As regards the evidence relating to\nthe five packages found in the red plastic bag in the boot of Ng’s\ncar, it seemed clear to us that this evidence was adduced as a matter\nof completeness. Ng stuffed twenty bundles into the haversack and\nthe remaining five into the red plastic bag and put them into the\nboot. That was the complete story as to what happened when Ng returned to\nthe car after buying the haversack. More importantly, in the course\nof the trial the judge expressly said that aside from the limited\npurpose of providing the court with a complete account of the facts,\nthe evidence on the five bundles would be disregarded by him in\nconsidering the charges preferred against the three appellants. 62     The\nfacts here are similar toNg Beng Siangas\nthe Prosecution did not adduce evidence to show that the accused\nhad a propensity to commit the offence as charged but to ascertain\nwhether the accused in this case had the necessarymens\nreato import diamorphine into Singapore on 26 March 2012.\nThis was because the accused’s defence was that he was not wilfully blind\nsince he checked his motorcycle every single time he performed a\njob for Prabha but found nothing. The accused also claimed that\nhe thought that he was bringing cigarettes into Singapore. This\nwas on the basis of cigarette cartons found in Prabha’s car. I allowed\nthe Prosecution to cross-examine the accused on facts and events\nthat might appear to be similar fact evidence. However, I focused\nstrictly on what the evidence was adduced for,ie,\nwhether the accused was wilfully blind and thus had themens reato import diamorphine into Singapore\non 26 March 2012 at Woodlands Checkpoint. 63     I\nwish to make it very clear that when I evaluated the evidence against the\naccused, I did not use it to show that the accused had also delivered drugs\nfor Prabha on previous occasions, which would be deeply prejudicial to\nhim. In any case, there is no evidence to prove those allegations.\nI also did not use the evidence of past deliveries or past conduct\nto conclude that the accused had the propensity to import drugs\ninto Singapore on 26 March 2012.",
        "Has the accused rebutted the\npresumptions under ss 18 and 21 of the Misuse of Drugs Act?": "64     From\nthe above reasons, I find that the presumption under s 18 has not\nbeen rebutted by the accused. Section 21 of the Act reads: If any controlled drug is found in any\nvehicle, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to\nbe in the possession of the owner of the vehicle and of the person\nin charge of the vehicle for the time being. 65     Here,\nthe accused admitted to ownership of the motorcycle and did not\ndeny that a black bundle was found hidden in his motorcycle.[note: 79]The presumption\nof possession then gives rise to the presumption that the accused\nknew of the nature of the drug under s 18(2) of the Act. The presumption\nin s 18(2) imputes knowledge of the nature of the drug onto the\naccused when the drug is in his possession. The cumulative effect\nof the two presumptions in s 18(2) and s 21 is the establishment\nof the requisitemens reafor the\noffence of importation of a controlled drug. 66     On\nthe evidence as explained above, I find that the accused has failed to\nrebut the presumption under s 18(2) and s 21 of the Act. I find\nthat the accused was a drug mule for Prabha and was paid RM500 each\ntime the delivery was successfully completed. His failure to check,\ndespite these suspicious circumstances, amounts to wilful blindness\nwhich equates to actual knowledge. His defence that he thought he\nwas being asked to smuggle in cigarettes cannot stand as it is based\non his denial of knowledge that the black bundle contained diamorphine.\nHis bare denial is insufficient to rebut the presumption of possession\nand knowledge of the diamorphine on a balance of probabilities.\nAccordingly, the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the Act\nhas not been rebutted on a balance of probabilities.",
        "Conclusion": "67     For\nthe above reasons, I find that the Prosecution has proven its case against\nthe accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I find the accused\nguilty and convict the accused for the offence of importation of 75.41g\nof diamorphine into Singapore under s 7 of the Act.  [note: 1]AB at\np 166.
