        "More should have been done to market the properties": "26. Ms Arulmozhi, who said that the Serangoon properties were sold to\n\nher husband because there were no offers to purchase them at a reasonable price, claimed\n\nthat she wanted to get the best possible price for the properties.27. For a start, more should have been done to market the Serangoon\n\nproperties before they were sold to Mr Chandran. Ms Arulmozhi, who said that she left the\n\nsale of the Serangoon properties to BP’s Patrick Teo, accepted that the most common\n\nway of selling properties is to advertise the sale in the newspapers. BP advertised the\n\nsale only once in the Straits Times. When cross-examined, Ms Arulmozhi revealed how little\n\nshe did to advertise the sale of the properties. She said as follows:Q. Did you attempt to advertise?`A. I asked BP to do it.Q. Did you see the advertisement?A. No.Q. How many times did BP advertise?A. I did not ask.Q. Did BP say how many times they advertised?A. No, now I know they advertised once….Q. In early February 1998, did you not ask BP to advertise again?A. No, I left it to them….Q. Did you tell them to try another round of advertising or go to\n\n  property agents?A. I only told them to go and get a buyer.28. BP’s Mr Teo said that very little had been done to advertise\n\nthe sale of the property because his instructions were that there was to be no publicity\n\nabout the proposed sale because the company was then being sued. However, Ms Arulmozhi did\n\nnot mention this when she was taken to task during cross-examination for not having done\n\nenough to advertise the sale of the properties in order to obtain the best possible price\n\nfor KIP.29. It should not be overlooked that Mr Teo’s housing agency dealt\n\nmainly with the sale of HDB flats. As such, other real estate agents with more expertise\n\nin the sale of commercial units should have been offered an opportunity to market the\n\nproperties. I thus find that Ms Arulmozhi’s conduct was not consistent with that of a\n\ndirector who was anxious to sell the company’s properties at the best possible price\n\nand that insufficient steps had been taken to market the Serangoon properties before they\n\nwere sold to Mr Chandran.",
        "The SLB valuation report was fundamentally flawed": "30. Ms Arulmozhi claimed that her husband helped the family by\n\npurchasing the properties for $4m. As for whether this price was reasonable or not, she\n\nrelied on a valuation report by SLB dated 16 March 1998, which stated that the properties\n\nwere worth only $4.1m. She said that she was advised by KIP’s lawyer, Mr Edwin Tay,\n\nthat it would be in order for the properties to be sold to Mr Chandran for $4m in view of\n\nSLB’s valuation report.31. SLB valuation figure of $4.1m was very low because it was\n\nfundamentally flawed. In fact, SLB’s valuation of the Serangoon properties would have\n\nbeen much higher than $5m if it had not been drastically reduced on the ground of the\n\n\"efficiency\" of one of the properties, namely No 672 Chander Road. Neither Mr Oh\n\nWan Keong, the trainee valuer who prepared SLB’s report, nor Ms Liow Pick Yuen, who\n\nsigned the said report, were able to explain why SLB’s valuation of the Serangoon\n\nproperties was drastically reduced on the ground of efficiency. When cross-examined, Mr\n\nOh, who could not explain what the principle of \"efficiency\" entailed, merely\n\nsaid as follows:Q. The \"efficiency\" principle utilised in the SLB report is\n\n  not found in any other valuation report. What is this principle?A. It is in the standard computer worksheet in SLB. I can’t\n\n  explain this principle.32. Ms Stella Seow of Colliers pointed out that \"efficiency\"\n\nrefers to the layout of the available space and that it is not relevant to KIP’s\n\nconservation shophouses because there are restrictions on the redevelopment of such\n\nconservation properties.33. The SLB report was also grossly inaccurate because it was based on\n\nan assumption that the monthly rental income for Nos 41 and 43 Kerbau Road was $13,000\n\nwhen it was $17,000. Ms Liow, who signed the SLB report, testified that if the market\n\nrental for the properties at the material time was $17,000, she would have increased the\n\nvaluation of the Serangoon properties by $464,000. SLB’s Mr Oh testified that the\n\nerroneous rental figure had been given to him by either Ms Arulmozhi, Mr Chandran or their\n\nlawyer, Mr Edwin Tay. In view of this, KIP’s counsel suggested that the erroneous\n\nfigure had been given to SLB in order to cause a reduction in the valuation amount.",
        "Whether Ms Arulmozhi knew that the properties were worth more": "34. I find that both Ms Arulmozhi and Mr Chandran knew that the market\n\nvalue of KIP’s properties was more than SLB’s valuation of $4.1m. To begin with,\n\nKIP’s business consultants, BP, stated in an advertisement in the Straits Times on 16\n\nJanuary 1998 that the properties were \"valued\" at $7m. Furthermore, Ms Arulmozhi\n\nadmitted that BP’s Mr Patrick Teo had told her to expect a price of $5m.35. Ms Arulmozhi knew that Colliers & Jardine (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n\n(hereinafter referred to as \"Colliers\") had valued the Serangoon properties at\n\n$6.5m in June 1996. This valuation report must have been on her mind when plans were afoot\n\nto sell these properties to Mr Chandran in early 1998. When cross-examined, Ms Arulmozhi\n\nclaimed to have forgotten about the Colliers' 1996 valuation report. She said as follows:Q. In mid-1997, you gave the Colliers’ report which valued the\n\n  properties at $6.5m to BP?A. Yes….Q. It was in KIP’s interest to get the best possible price?A. Yes.Q. Having got a valuation of $6.5m in June 1996, were you not alerted\n\n  to get another valuation after receiving SLB’s valuation of $4.1m.A.I did not remember the 1996 valuation.(emphasis\n\n  added)36. Ms Arulmozhi and Mr Chandran could not have forgotten about the\n\nColliers’ 1996 valuation report. After all, this report was furnished to OUT when Mr\n\nChandran applied for a loan to finance his purchase of the said properties in early 1998.\n\nFurthermore, for the purpose of this trial, Ms Arulmozhi and Mr Chandran asked Colliers\n\nfor a report on the value of the said properties at the time of the sale. As for why this\n\nwas done, Mr Chandran said as follows when cross-examined:Q. When you needed a valuation for this trial, did you tell BP that you\n\n  wanted a valuation from Colliers?A. I do not recall specifying any valuer.I may have said that\n\n  Colliers were probably suitable because they had valued the properties previously.(emphasis added)37. In short, both Ms Arulmozhi and her husband were fully aware of the\n\nexistence of the Colliers' 1996 valuation report. Had she taken the simple step of\n\nchecking SLB’s valuation with Colliers or with other valuers, the sale of the\n\nproperties to Mr Chandran for $4m would have been unthinkable.38. As has been mentioned, Chesterton, who furnished their valuation\n\nreport dated 22 April 1998 to OUT, to whom Mr Chandran had applied for a loan to finance\n\nhis purchase of the Serangoon properties, placed the open market value of the properties\n\nat $8m. Both Ms Arulmozhi and her husband knew that OUT had instructed Chesterton to value\n\nthe properties for the purpose of granting the loan in question. Chesterton’s Ms Teh\n\nSiew Lye, who inspected the properties, testified that she had been instructed to speak to\n\nMr Chandran to fix the appointment for the inspection. Ms Lim Geok Lan, the OUT officer\n\nwho handled Mr Chandran’s application for a loan, testified that the photographs\n\ntaken by Chesterton’s valuer during the inspection of the premises showed that both\n\nMs Arulmozhi and her husband were present during the inspection. More importantly, Ms\n\nArulmozhi and her husband knew that the OUT loan could only be finalised after Chesterton\n\nhad valued the properties. I do not accept that they did not know about Chesterton’s\n\nvaluation amount at the material time. In any case, even if Ms Arulmozhi’s claim that\n\nshe did not know about Chesteron’s valuation amount at the material time is to be\n\nbelieved, she should not have proceeded to complete the sale of the said properties to her\n\nhusband without bothering to enquire about Chesterton’s valuation. After all, she\n\naccepted that KIP should get the best price for the Serangoon properties. Her\n\n\"Nelsonian\" blindness in not wanting to know about the Chesterton valuation can\n\nonly be explained on the basis that she was too preoccupied with having KIP’s\n\nproperties transferred to her husband at a very low price. As such, whether or not she\n\nknew that Chesterton had valued the Serangoon properties at $8m, there was a serious\n\nfailure on her part to fulfil her fiduciary duties to KIP.39. For the purposes of the trial, two other reports were procured. KIP\n\ncommissioned Jones Lang LaSalle (hereinafter referred to as \"JLS\") to value the\n\nSerangoon properties as at the time of the sale to Mr Chandran. JLS reported that in April\n\n1998, the said properties were valued at $7m. On the other hand, Ms Arulmozhi and Mr\n\nChandran furnished another valuation by Colliers, which placed the value of the said\n\nproperties in April 1998 at around $4.5m.40. Even the lowest of the non-SLB valuations, namely that by Colliers,\n\nwas much higher than SLB’s valuation of $4.1m. In fact, the Colliers valuation figure\n\nwould have been much higher than $4.5m if Colliers had been given adequate information on\n\nrental income. In this case, the actual monthly rental income for No 672 Chander Road and\n\nthe adjoining beer garden was $13,850. However, for the purpose of valuing the properties,\n\nMs Stella Seow of Colliers assumed that the monthly rental figure was $10,000. This\n\nassumption was made because BP’s Mr Patrick Teo, who commissioned the report on\n\nbehalf of Ms Arulmozhi and Mr Chandran, failed to respond to her request for tenancy\n\nagreements to be furnished. Ms Seow said that had the said agreements been furnished, the\n\nvaluation for the properties would have increased from $4.5m to $4.81m. She also accepted\n\nthat if she had access to the comparable rental figures in Little India, as Jones Lang\n\nLasalle did, her valuation of the Serangoon properties for April 1998 would have been\n\naround $5.25m.41. From the aforesaid, it is evident that there was no basis for the\n\nSLB valuation of $4.1m. Ms Arulmozhi and Mr Chandran must have known that something was\n\namiss when they received the SLB report. By not making enquiries with respect to\n\nChesterton’s valuation of $8m and by not commissioning another valuation report\n\nbefore arranging for the sale of the said properties to her husband for $4m, Ms Arulmozhi\n\nundoubtedly breached her fiduciary duties to KIP.",
        "Arrangements for the sale of the properties": "42. The arrangements for the sale of the Serangoon properties to Mr\n\nChandran and the terms of payment of the $4m for the said properties also showed that Ms\n\nArulmozhi was too preoccupied with benefiting her husband to be in a position to look\n\nafter KIP’s interest in the sale.43. Although the purchase price was $4m, this sum did not reach\n\nKIP’s coffers. To begin with, around $2.3m was required to pay DBS Bank, the\n\nmortgagees of the properties. Secondly, although it was Mr Chandran who required a loan\n\nfrom OUT to finance his purchase of the Serangoon properties, KIP had to pay for the\n\nservices of one Mr Rocky Selvarajoo to assist him in getting the said loan from OUT. Mr\n\nSelvarajoo’s bill for this service was a whopping $150,000. Thirdly, Mr Chandran\n\ndeducted from the purchase price the sum of $513,704.31, which he and his wife agreed was\n\nthe sum he had lent to KIP. Finally, he deducted from the purchase price the sum of\n\n$486,259,69 by agreeing to assume liability for KIP’s debts of an equivalent amount.",
        "Mr Selvarajoo’s commission": "44. Why Ms Arulmozhi agreed that KIP should pay Mr Selvarajoo $150,000\n\nfor introducing her husband to OUT for a loan for his own benefit cannot be fathomed. Both\n\nshe and her husband knew that no middleman was needed to obtain the required loan from\n\nOUT. Mr Chandran is literate and he had arranged for several overdraft accounts with a\n\nnumber of banks. In fact, after taking over KIP’s properties, he arranged for\n\nadditional financing from another financial institution. When cross-examined, Mr Chandran\n\nexplained why he relied on Mr Selvarajoo to get a loan for him from OUT in the following\n\nterms:Q. You relied on Rocky’s assistance to get you a loan and that was\n\n  the only way you could a loan?A. It was not me who relied on him. The decision had already been made\n\n  by the family to rely on him. I did not get a chance to do my own shopping for the\n\n  loan….Q. Why did you not look for other banks to give you a loan?A. By the time mother-in-law approached me, I had the impression that\n\n  she had already spoken to Rocky and things were under way for a loan.45. Mr Chandran’s oral testimony contradicted what he had stated\n\nin an affidavit filed in relation to OS 1378 of 1999. In paragraph 11 of that affidavit,\n\nhe had stated as follows:I then tried to find a bank to finance my purchase of the Serangoon\n\n  properties. It was not easy because at the time Singapore was entering a recession.\n\n  Further, banks were very wary of financing properties in Little India. Eventually the\n\n  Overseas Union Bank Limited agreed to finance the transaction.46. When questioned about the inconsistency, Mr Chandran said that the\n\nwhole of paragraph 11 in his earlier affidavit was a \"mistake\". When pressed to\n\nexplain, Mr Chandran could not do so satisfactorily. He merely said that he was rushed for\n\ntime and that his current version was true.47. It must not be overlooked that at the material time, both Mr\n\nChandran and his wife were being advised by KIP’s business consultant, Mr Patrick Teo\n\nof BP. Surely, Mr Teo, who constantly accompanied Ms Arulmozhi and Mr Chandran to banks\n\nand to her lawyer’s office, could have helped Mr Chandran obtain a loan for much less\n\nthan the $150,000 charged by Mr Selvarajoo. Mr Teo said that he did not know that Mr\n\nChandran was purchasing the properties. It is most unlikely that this was the case.48. Why Ms Arulmozhi utilised Mr Selvarajoo’s services for\n\n$150,000 is thus one of the unsolved mysteries in this case, and especially so since it\n\nwas Mr Selvarajoo who showed the Chesterton valuation report to Ms Arulmozhi’s\n\nsiblings after he had differences with Mr Chandran. Ms Arulmozhi said that Mr Selvarajoo\n\nwas introduced to her by her mother, who agreed that KIP should pay the $150,000\n\ncommission for helping Mr Chandran obtain a bank loan. This was denied by Madam Narumalar.\n\nNeither party called Mr Selvarajoo to testify. All the same, Ms Arulmozhi’s\n\nwillingness to utilise $150,000 of KIP’s money to pay for the procuring of a loan\n\nfrom OUT for her husband to buy the Serangoon properties showed that she neglected her\n\nduties to KIP in the sale of the said properties to her husband.",
        "Deduction of loans": "49. The loans given by Mr Chandra to KIP will next be considered.\n\nAdmittedly, he had helped the family quite generously in the past. However, there is no\n\nevidence that he lent KIP more than half a million dollars or that he had such a large\n\namount of money to lend to KIP. As such, Ms Arulmozhi should not have agreed that KIP owed\n\nhim $513,704.31 and that this sum be deducted from the purchase price for the Serangoon\n\nproperties.50. Mr Chandran said in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that he had\n\nmore than $140,000 in savings when his father-in-law died. However, when cross-examined,\n\nhe conceded that this was not borne out by his evidence. In any case, he accepted that he\n\ndid not use all his savings for the family business. Mr Chandran next contended that he\n\nhad overdraft accounts with a number of banks but even if all the overdraft accounts were\n\nutilised, the total amount was only around $50,000. As for his assertion that he took\n\nloans from his parents and a friend, no credible evidence of any such loans being large\n\nenough to support his claim that he lent KIP more than half a million dollars was\n\nfurnished. As for the proceeds of the sale of his HDB flat in 1994, he accepted that only\n\nabout $100,000 of this sum had been lent to KIP.51. Ms Arulmozhi contended that her family had agreed that the money\n\nlent by her husband to KIP could be deducted from the purchase price. She referred to a\n\ndirectors’ resolution authorising the deduction of Mr Chandran’s loans from the\n\namount payable to KIP for the properties. Even if this resolution is taken into account,\n\nit merely authorised a deduction of $400,000 from the purchase price. Ms Arulmozhi was not\n\nauthorised to allow her husband to deduct $513,704.31 from the purchase price.52. The deduction of $486,295.69 from the purchase price of $4m on the\n\nbasis that Mr Chandran would take over specified KIP’s debts of an equivalent amount\n\nwas also not in KIP’s interest. Not all the debts in question were paid by Mr\n\nChandran immediately. In fact, a debt to BP, totalling $108,197.90 was paid more than one\n\nand a half years after the purchase of the Serangoon properties. Mr Chandran should have\n\npaid the $486,295.69 directly to KIP.53. More importantly, a question arises as to whether some of the debts\n\nwhich Mr Chandran agreed to settle on KIP’s behalf were genuine debts. As has been\n\nmentioned, part of the debts assumed by Mr Chandran included BP’s bills. When the\n\ndate for Mr Chandran to purchase the Serangoon properties drew near, BP sent KIP a number\n\nof bills for nearly $300,000. On 1 March 1998, BP submitted a bill for $40,000 for\n\nresearch and preparation of plan for the enhancement of No 37 Kerbau Road. Three days\n\nlater, on 4 March 1998, BP sent KIP another bill for $79,500 for \"consultancy\n\nservices on property matters relating to No 37, Kerbau Road\". On 21 April 1998, BP\n\nsent KIP a third bill for $33,000 for \"execution of the plan for No 37 Kerbau Road\n\nand for co-ordination with others with respect to the matter\". In short, KIP was\n\nexpected to pay BP the sum of $152,000 for services rendered in relation to No 37 Kerbau\n\nRoad alone.54. When Mr Chandran was asked why such a large bill was rendered for\n\none property alone, namely No 37 Kerbau Road, he merely replied that BP’s services\n\nwere \"worth it\". On the other hand, BP’s Mr Patrick Teo said that the bill\n\nfor No 37 Kerbau Road was a bill for turningallthe Serangoon properties into\n\ntourist attractions. Why this was not stated in the bills was not satisfactorily\n\nexplained. What is evident is that Mr Chandran did not appear to know that the bill for No\n\n37 Kerbau Road was for work done in relation to all the four properties.55. A question arises as to why BP charged such large sums for their\n\nplan to upgrade the Serangoon properties when it was evident to Ms Arulmozhi, Mr Chandran\n\nand Mr Patrick Teo of BP that the plan was doomed from the very start because the family\n\ncoffers were empty. Mr Patrick Teo, who testified that $1m was required to upgrade the\n\nfour properties, admitted that by September 1997, he knew that KIP was in no position to\n\nraise any money for this purpose after DBS Bank turned down Ms Arulmozhi’s\n\napplication for a loan. He also said that by October 1997, Mr Chandran had borrowed\n\n$45,000 from him and had given him three or four post-dated cheques. In any case, Mr\n\nChandran said that by January 1998, he had already been asked to buy these properties for\n\n$4m. In these circumstances, there was no basis whatsoever for BP to continue to look into\n\nplans to upgrade the Serangoon properties and for KIP to incur costs with respect to this\n\nwasteful exercise.56. Other bills submitted by BP are also startling. On 4 March 1998, BP\n\nbilled KIP for $32,000 for consultancy services in relation to the family’s\n\ncoffeeshop at Tanjong Pagar Plaza and $35,000 for litigation. Mr Chandran, who worked\n\nrather closely with BP, could not explain why BP billed KIP $35,000 for litigation\n\nmatters. When cross-examined, he merely said as follows:Q. Litigation for $35,000. What was this for?A.They were explaining what is an \"affidavit\", how to\n\n  prepare for court, compiling evidence. If we went to a lawyer, it would cost ten times\n\n  more.(emphasis added)57. Mr Chandran’s answer shows that there was no basis for the\n\nbill for $35,000 for litigation matters. There is no reason for KIP to pay BP this amount\n\nwhen KIP’s own lawyers could have explained to Mr Chandran and his wife what an\n\naffidavit is and how they ought to prepare for the trial.58. As a director of KIP, Ms Arulmozhi should have questioned BP with\n\nrespect to their bills. She should not have allowed all these bills to be deducted from\n\nthe purchase price payable by her husband to KIP for the said properties. Her deafening\n\nsilence in the face of BP’s bills clearly showed that she paid little attention to\n\nKIP’s rights.",
        "Whether management decisions were bona fide": "59. Counsel for Ms Arulmozhi pointed out that it would be wrong for the\n\ncourt to substitute its opinion for that of the management, or to question the correctness\n\nof bona fide management decisions. In this context, it is pertinent to note that inHoward\n\nSmith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd[1974] AC 821, 832, Lord Wilberforce said as follows:[W]hen a dispute arises whether directors of a company made a\n\n  particular decision for one purpose or for another, or whether, there being more than one\n\n  purpose, one or another purpose was the substantial or primary purpose, the court, in\n\n  their Lordships' opinion, is entitled to look at the situation objectively in order to\n\n  estimate how critical or pressing, or substantial or, per contra, insubstantial an alleged\n\n  requirement may have been. If it finds that a particular requirement though real, was not\n\n  urgent, or critical, at the relevant time, it may have reason to doubt, or discount, the\n\n  assertions of individuals that they acted solely in order to deal with it, particularly\n\n  when the action they took was unusual or even extreme.60. For reasons already stated, the actions taken by Ms Arulmozhi in relation to the\n\nsale of the Serangoon properties to her husband were, to use Lord Wilberforce’s\n\nwords, \"unusual and even extreme\". As Ms Arulmozhi did not act in KIP’s\n\ninterest when she arranged for the sale of the said properties to her husband, she\n\nbreached her fiduciary duties to KIP.D. MR CHANDRAN’S POSITION61. Although Mr Chandran was not a director of KIP, this does not mean that he does not\n\nhave to account to KIP for his actions in relation to his purchase of the Serangoon\n\nproperties in April 1998. InBarnes v Addy(1874) LR 9 Ch App 244, 251-252, Lord\n\nSelborne LC explained the position as follows:That responsibility [i.e of a trustee] may no doubt be extended in equity to others who\n\n  are not properly trustees, if they are found either making themselves trusteesde son\n\n  tort, or actually participating in any fraudulent conduct of the trustee to the injury\n\n  of thecestui que trust. But, on the other hand, strangers are not to be made\n\n  constructive trustees merely because they act as the agents of trustees in transactions\n\n  within their legal powers, transactions, perhaps of which a court of equity may\n\n  disapprove, unless those agents receive and become chargeable with some part of the trust\n\n  property, or unless they assist with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design on the\n\n  part of the trustees.62. Mr Chandran contended that he had done nothing wrong by buying the Serangoon\n\nproperties from KIP for $4m as he was trying to help his wife’s family by buying the\n\nsaid properties. In para 14 of his affidavit in OS 1378 of 1999, he said as follows:14. I am now the reluctant owner of the Serangoon properties. I bear the onerous burden\n\n  of servicing the loan repayments – this in itself is giving me endless anxiety.63. It must be noted that when Mr Chandran purchased the Serangoon properties, his nett\n\nmonthly salary was not much more than $4,000. He could afford to buy $4m worth of\n\nproperties because he had done his calculations carefully. As the rental income from the\n\nsaid properties outstripped the monthly instalment on the $3m loan from OUT, the\n\nproperties were affordable, and especially so if the remaining $1m of the purchase price\n\nwas not paid immediately because of, among other things, a deduction for \"loans\"\n\ngiven by him to KIP. Rather than a burden, as Mr Chandran described them, the Serangoon\n\nproperties were a windfall, which resulted from his wife’s breach of her fiduciary\n\nduties to KIP.64. Mr Chandran also said that he would not make a profit if he sold the Serangoon\n\nproperties. In fact, he claimed that a sale would be an attempt to \"cut losses\".\n\nIn para 15 of his affidavit in OS 1378 of 1999, he stated as follows:15. …. The logical thing for me to do would be to sell off the Serangoon\n\n  properties,not to make a profitbut simply to cut losses incurred by me\n\n  personally….65. When cross-examined, Mr Chandran, who reiterated that he would not make a profit if\n\nhe sold the Serangoon properties, said as follows:Q. In your affidavit of 21 October 1999 in OS 1378 of 1999, your position was that you\n\n  had no intention to profit from the Serangoon properties?A. Yes.Q. In August 1999, you had signed an option form and agreed to sell the properties to\n\n  Mr Rocky Selvarajoo’s wife for $5m.A. Yes.Q. You did not mention this option in your affidavit in OS 1378 of 1999.A. Yes, it was not mentioned.Q. You were less than truthful?A.No, the $1m profit was to offset the costs of maintaining the property.(emphasis\n\n  added)66. When it was pointed out to Mr Chandran that the rental income was much more than\n\nthe monthly payments to the bank for his loan, he finally accepted that he would profit\n\nfrom the sale of the properties.67. For reasons already stated in the earlier part of this judgment, Mr Chandran was\n\nfully aware of the fact that his wife did not act in KIP’s interest when she sold the\n\ncompany’s properties to him in April 1998. This puts him in a different position from\n\nthird parties who are unaware that they were dealing with a director who has breached his\n\nor her fiduciary duties to the company. As such, Mr Chandran has to answer to KIP for the\n\nfruits of his wife’s breach.E. THE PLAINTIFFS' OTHER CONTENTIONS68. In view of my finding that Ms Arulmozhi breached her fiduciary duties to the\n\ncompany, I need not discuss the allegations against her with respect to misrepresentation\n\nor undue influence.69. In his written submissions, KIP’s counsel also asserted that the sale of the\n\nSerangoon properties to Mr Chandran was null and void because the consent of the Urban\n\nRenewal Authority had not been obtained for the transfer of the properties. Such consent\n\nis required under KIP’s lease agreement with the Urban Renewal Authority. It was also\n\nasserted in the written submissions that there was no proper authorisation by KIP for the\n\nsale of the properties to Mr Chandran. Neither of these assertions were pleaded and they\n\nwere not adequately dealt with during the trial. As such, they need not be considered.F. CONCLUSION69. This is a sordid family dispute and innumerable allegations of impropriety, many of\n\nwhich were not proven, were made by family members against one another. After having had\n\nthe benefit of listening to the witnesses and evaluating the evidence, I have no doubt\n\nthat Ms Arulmozhi did not act in the best interest of KIP when she sold the company’s\n\nproperties to her husband for $4m in 1998. I also have no doubt whatsoever that Mr\n\nChandran knew the whole picture when he agreed with his wife to take over KIP’s\n\nproperties. In the circumstances, the plaintiffs succeed in their claim for damages for\n\nthe loss suffered as a result of the sale of the Serangoon properties to Mr Chandran for\n\n$4m. The damages payable to KIP will be assessed by the Registrar.70. The plaintiffs are entitled to interest at the rate of 6% as from the date of the\n\nwrit. As for costs, the plaintiffs are, in the circumstances of the case, only entitled to\n\ntwo-thirds of the costs.Sgd:TAN LEE MENGJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
