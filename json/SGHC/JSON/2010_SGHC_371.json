        "Other appeals of the plaintiff": "22     There were three appeals against the\n                    dismissals of the claims for future speech physiotherapy and occupational\n                    therapy costs, for future nursing care and for future loss of earnings of the\n                    mother of the plaintiff for $223,800.",
        "Future speech, physiotherapy and occupational therapy costs": "23     In coming to her decision the AR relied on the\n                    evidence of Dr Kong Keng He, Head and Senior Consultant, Department of\n                    Rehabilitation Medicine, who had treated the plaintiff, that the\n                    plaintiff’s physical impairments have improved tremendously, and are\n                    almost back to normal. Specifically, Dr Kong thought that it was not\n                    necessary for him to continue with speech therapy and occupational therapy. The\n                    plaintiff contended that the AR should not have disregarded the evidence of a\n                    speech language therapist, Dr Radika Vasudeva, and other persons who had\n                    dealt with the plaintiff who recommended that he should continue with\n                    occupational therapy and speech and language therapy that he was\n                    receiving. 24     The AR heard the evidence of all the witnesses\n                    on this area and concluded that: I accept the evidence of Dr Kong Keng He that the patient’s\n                        condition has more or less tapered off, and that future speech and\n                        occupational therapy sessions are unnecessary, and will be of little or no\n                        benefit to him. In the appeal the plaintiff only submitted that\n                    Dr Vasudeva’s recommendations should be accepted, without stating\n                    that the AR was wrong to accept Dr Kong’s evidence or that\n                    Dr Kong’s opinion was wrong. I do not see any reason for disagreeing\n                    on the AR’s finding made after listening to the witnesses.",
        "Future nursing care for the plaintiff quantified at\n                $120,000": "25     The plaintiff had ceased to require nursing\n                    care at the time of the assessment of damages. This claim for future nursing\n                    care was put forward on the basis that his condition may deteriorate or worsen\n                    as he gets older. This claim is really groundless. There was no basis to suppose\n                    that the plaintiff’s condition would deteriorate. All the evidence was\n                    that he had recovered to a level that he does not require nursing care. The AR\n                    was correct to reject it.",
        "Mother’s loss of future income": "26     This claim, for $251,802 computed at $19,754\n                    per year for 13 years until she retires at the age of 62 years was made on the\n                    basis that the plaintiff’s mother was due to start work as a full time\n                    kindergarten teacher on the day of the accident, and because of the accident,\n                    she did not take up the employment. This claim was not supported by any evidence\n                    from the mother herself or the employer. The plaintiff’s father produced\n                    two letters to support the claim; the first a letter from the Head (Principal),\n                    Yuhua Education Centre, PAP Community Foundation, to the mother that she was\n                    converted from part-time status from 1 January 2005 at a basic monthly\n                    salary of $1000, with no reference to the tenure of employment, and the second\n                    was a letter from the education centre which confirmed that she did not take up\n                    her appointment. The writers of the letters did not give evidence. 27     The defendant had objected to the\n                    admissibility of the two letters, and clearly they were not admissible. In the\n                    absence of direct evidence from the mother and the writers of the two letters,\n                    there was no evidence to support a claim for $251,802. 28     The defendant also disputed the\n                    plaintiff’slocus standito make the claim\n                    for the mother’s pre-trial loss of earnings and future loss of earnings.\n                    On a conceptual standpoint, there is some basis in this objection because the\n                    income lost is the mother’s income, not the plaintiff’s income or\n                    loss, but there is an answer to the objection. As these claims are acknowledged\n                    to be the mother’s losses, the mother is effectively the beneficial\n                    claimant, especially as she is aware of these claims being made, and is not\n                    making any claims of her own. (It should be noted that the same objection could\n                    be taken over other claims e.g. the costs of treatment, transport and the\n                    maids’ employment because the plaintiff’s parents paid them, but no\n                    objections were taken.) 29     Such claims have been allowed. InKuan Kian Seng v Wong Choon Keh[1995] SGHC 43, K S Rajah JC allowed a claim for the loss of\n                    earnings of the plaintiff’s wife. The judge cited as authorityDonnelly v Joyce[1974] QB 474 which allowed a\n                    claim for a mother’s loss of earnings. For these losses to be recovered,\n                    however, they have to be reasonable. If a mother gives up a $10,000 monthly\n                    salary to look after a child instead of employing a maid or a nurse, then the\n                    recoverable loss should be based on the cost of employment of a maid or nurse\n                    and not the mother’s salary.",
        "Other appeals of the defendant": "30     There were three appeals which were against\n                    the AR’s awards for loss of earning capacity, cost of future psychiatric\n                    treatment, pre-trial maid expenses, pre-trial loss of income of the mother, and\n                    pre-trial transport expenses.",
        "Loss of earning capacity": "31     The AR held that the plaintiff’s loss\n                    was a loss of earning capacity rather than a loss of future earnings. As the\n                    plaintiff had not completed his education when he was injured, and it was\n                    uncertain that he would have become an architect, as he had aspired to be, the\n                    AR’s ruling accorded with the Court of Appeal’s rulings inSamuel Chaion loss of future earnings and loss of\n                    earning capacity. 32     The quantification of the loss at $600,000,\n                    however, is not as well-founded. The plaintiff submitted in the assessment\n                    hearing that: We have assessed his loss of earning capacity to be $800,000.00 taking\n                        into account his age and potential that was nipped in the bud just as he was\n                        embarking on his studies to achieve his career path. without citing a single precedent award to support the assessment. The\n                    AR did not explain how the $600,000 was arrived at. 33     The plaintiff submitted at the same hearing\n                    that the plaintiff’s loss of earning capacity should be in the range of\n                    $150,000 to $180,000. The plaintiff cited the identical awards of $100,000 for\n                    the same loss made inWinston TanandMuhamad Ilyas. There is another case,Tan Siew Bin Ronnie v Chin Wee Keong[2008] 1 SLR 178\n                        (“Ronnie Tan”) in which the same\n                    sum was awarded, and inNirumalan V Kanapathi Pillay v Teo\n                        Eng Guan[2003] 3 SLR(R) 601 (“Nirumalan”) $180,000 was awarded. Prior to these\n                    cases, such awards were conservative. Audrey Limet\n                        al,Practitioners’ Library, Assessment\n                        of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents(Butterworths\n                    Asia 2001) lists 52 awards made between 1990 and 2000, with the highest at\n                    $75,000. 34     In assessing the loss of earning capacity, all\n                    the circumstances of the injured person has to be considered, particularly his\n                    age, education and work qualification, work record, and the effect the\n                    disabilities will have on his work prospects. These matters are relevant for\n                    putting a monetary value to the loss. Even with these matters in mind, the\n                    assessment of such damages is an inexact exercise, especially when the\n                    person’s income-earning potential is uncertain. 35     These four cases offer guidance for the\n                    quantification of the plaintiff’s loss of earning capacity. The plaintiff\n                    inMuhamad Ilyaswas 21 years old and had\n                    completed junior college when he met with the accident and suffered serious head\n                    injuries. Despite the injuries, he was doing a course in electrical engineering\n                    and computer science at the University of California, under a disabled\n                    students’ program. The plaintiff acknowledged that he was still a person\n                    of very high intelligence even after his accident, and was just\n                    “slower”. The AR did not notice any slowness and found that he was\n                    likely to find gainful employment and be successful at whatever career he\n                    chose. 36     The plaintiff inWinston\n                        Tanwas 13 years old at the time of the accident when he was a\n                    secondary school student, and taking a course on information technology at\n                    Temasek Polytechnic at the time of the assessment of damages. Chan J found\n                    that his residual disabilities should not be a major stumbling block preventing\n                    him from making further progress and achieving his employment\n                goals. 37     The plaintiff inRonnie\n                        Tanwas a 36 year-old litigation lawyer. He had a whiplash injury\n                    with residual disabilities including frontal headaches, neck pain and stiffness\n                    and vertigo which affected his ability and capacity to work, although he\n                    continued work, probably at a reduced level. 38     The plaintiff inNirumalanwas also a lawyer and was about 40 years old when he\n                    suffered a whiplash injury which caused him to cut back on his work. He was\n                    awarded $180,000 for loss of earning capacity by me. I have to state that when I\n                    reviewed this award against the applicable principles and the other awards, it\n                    appeared the award was higher than it should have been. 39     In the plaintiff’s case, there is\n                    evidence that he can undertake simple undemanding employment, but he would not\n                    be able to work and earn at the level of a person who has completed his\n                    secondary education (which he had) or his junior college education (which he\n                    probably would have, but for the accident). The salient factors for\n                    consideration in his case are that: (i)     his ability to work is significantly\n                        diminished, (ii)     the diminution extends over the whole of his working life,\n                    and (iii)     his\n                        potential earning level (without the diminution) is\n                uncertain. 40     Taking into account the factors to be\n                    considered and the awards made in the cases mentioned, I set the damages for\n                    loss of earning capacity for the plaintiff at $250,000.",
        "Cost of future psychiatric treatment": "41     The AR’s award was for $144,000 at $600\n                    per month for 20 years, although the plaintiff had claimed $121,200 before the\n                    AR, at $505 per month for 20 years,[note: 3]and this was\n                    repeated in his submissions in the appeal.[note: 4]The supporting\n                    evidence came from Dr Adrian Wang Chee Cheng of the Gleneagles Medical\n                    Centre who was treating the plaintiff. Dr Wang testified that there is a\n                    70–80% probability that the plaintiff would require long term medication\n                    of five to 10 years, and if his condition remained, then he would require\n                    life-long medication. However, he did not state the treatment charges, and the\n                    defendant had worked out the charges incurred in 2008 and 2009 to be\n                    $350–$400 per month. In his reply, the plaintiff did not explain the $505\n                    that was put up, or the $600 that the AR used. The plaintiff also did not\n                    dispute the defendant’s computation of the $350–$400. 42     The defendant had contended that the plaintiff\n                    could receive the same treatment for less at a government-structured hospital. I\n                    do not accept that argument. It is for the injured party to decide on the\n                    treatment that he is to receive, and he is entitled to claimreasonablecosts of treatment. He is not obliged to seek\n                    treatment or receive damages at the lowest costs available. I allow $90,000 for\n                    further psychiatric treatment at $375 per month for 20 years.",
        "Pre-trial expenses": "Maid expenses 43     The AR allowed $22,527 for the costs of\n                    employing two maids successively. The defendant appealed against the award on\n                    two grounds, firstly, that the documentary evidence produced only showed the\n                    Foreign Workers Levy payments. The defendant was not disputing the employment of\n                    the maids, which was supported by the evidence of the levy payments. While no\n                    supporting documents were produced on the salary and the other expenses incurred\n                    on the maids, a list of all the payments was put up. The plaintiff’s\n                    father explained that there were no documentary records of the payments of the\n                    maids’ salaries because they were paid in cash, and the other expenses for\n                    the maids were based on estimated figures issued by the Ministry of\n                    Manpower. 44     The other point raised was that the maids did\n                    not only attend to the plaintiff but undertook some household duties. The\n                    plaintiff’s case was that the maids were employed to help his mother to\n                    look after him, because she was unable to do it alone. If the maids did some\n                    household chores which the mother was unable to do while she attended to the\n                    plaintiff, that part of the maids’ services should not be excluded from\n                    consideration. The evidence showed that the mother was not seeking to gain an\n                    advantage from the employment of the maids because she dispensed with them when\n                    she could cope by herself. This award should stand. Transport expenses 45     The AR made an award of $13,166.80 for\n                    pre-trial transport expenses over four years by the family car, taxi and bus.\n                    The defendant submitted during the appeal that there were no supporting\n                    documents. However, although the plaintiff’s father had listed the trips\n                    for which the claims were made, he was not questioned over them by the\n                    defendant’s counsel during the assessment. The AR had seen and heard the\n                    father and accepted his computation of the claim, and I do not see any reason\n                    for disturbing it. Mother’s loss of income 46     The AR had made an award of $72,600 because\n                    she accepted the evidence that the plaintiff’s mother had given up her\n                    employment to look after the plaintiff. The employment in question is the\n                    full-time job as a kindergarten teacher with the Yuhua Education Centre in\n                    respect of which her claim for loss of future earnings has been dealt with. No\n                    evidence was produced in support of the claim beside the two letters, one\n                    informing her of her appointment and the other confirming her resignation, both\n                    of which were not properly proved in evidence. 47     The claim was put up and quantified at $72,600\n                    over the period 2005–2008 without an explanation or documentation on how\n                    that figure was arrived at. Against that state of evidence, there was no basis\n                    for the AR to make the award. I therefore set aside this award.",
        "Conclusion": "48     The following variations are made to the\n                    AR’s awards: (i)     the award for pain and suffering and\n                        loss of amenities is reduced to $160,000; (ii)     the award for the loss of earning capacity is\n                        reduced to $250,000; (iii)     the award for costs of future psychiatric treatment is\n                        reduced to $90,000; and (iv)     the award for the mother’s loss of income is set\n                        aside. 49     As the plaintiff’s appeals have failed,\n                    the plaintiff shall pay costs of $2,000 and reasonable disbursements. As the\n                    defendant has succeeded in the majority of his appeals, the plaintiff is to pay\n                    costs of $10,000 and reasonable disbursements.
