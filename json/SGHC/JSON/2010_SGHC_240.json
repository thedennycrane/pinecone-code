        "The facts": "2       Although the plaintiffs are three separate\n                    Singapore incorporated entities, they share a common office and have one common\n                    shareholder,ieWong Shiu Wong\n                    (“Wong”) who is the managing-director of the plaintiff of which\n                    Wong’s brother Wong Sui Weng (“Weng”) is the general\n                    manager. The plaintiffs are primarily in the business of ship-repair and\n                    fabrication of steel works for tankers and other ocean-going\n                vessels. 3       The first defendant is in the specialised\n                    business of constructing (for the oil and gas industries) topside modules of\n                    vessels, processing equipment and structures. Its managing-director at the\n                    material time was Gay Beng Toong (“BT”). The first defendant was\n                    incorporated on 6 March 1986 as a family company owned by BT, his sister\n                    and wife. On 23 November 2006, the first defendant was sold to an American\n                    listed company known as Universal Compression Holdings Inc\n                    (“Universal”). Subsequently Universal merged with Hanover\n                    Compression Company and Exterran Holdings Inc. (“Exterran”), also\n                    a listed entity in the United States, and became the owner of the first\n                    defendant. BT remained the managing-director of the first defendant\n                    notwithstanding the change in ownership while his younger brother Ngay Ming Kok\n                    (“Gary”) was at all material times the business development\n                    manager of the first defendant. 4       The shareholders of the second defendant are\n                    Gary’s wife Lucy Tan and one Er Nyong Song. Gary is also the general\n                    manager of the second defendant. Although the business of the second defendant\n                    was stated (at the time of its incorporation on 25 August 2006) to be\n                    marine engineering, it was the defendants’ case that the second\n                    defendant’s specific role was to effect advances and loans to the first\n                    defendant’s contractors including the plaintiffs. 5       According to BT, the first defendant’s\n                    business is labour-intensive and starting from about 2000, the first defendant\n                    had subcontracted to Wong’s companies various projects. Initially, the\n                    first defendant subcontracted to Wong’s firm known as Sunny Construction.\n                    After their incorporation, the first defendant subcontracted projects to the\n                    plaintiffs. According to BT, it did not matter to the first defendant which of\n                    the plaintiffs was its subcontractor since all three companies effectively\n                    belonged to Wong. 6       In 2006, the first defendant subcontracted to\n                    the plaintiffs its projects numbered 1008, 1026, 1027, 1035, 1036 and 1044 and\n                    1045 (collectively “the projects”). Project 1045 (“project\n                    1045”) was subsequently awarded to the plaintiffs in 2008. Besides\n                    labour, the second plaintiff also provided hand-tools and fabrication materials\n                    for project 1045. The plaintiffs’ workers carried out work on the projects\n                    and on project 1045 at the premises of the first defendant. It was the\n                    plaintiffs’ case that each of its labourers was issued unique\n                    identification numbers (“UINs”) by the first defendant that\n                    enabled the workers to clock-in and clock-out using their UINs and thumbprints.\n                    The accounts department of the first defendant monitored the time spent by the\n                    plaintiffs’ workers by issuing a daily manpower list. The plaintiffs\n                    (through Weng) submitted invoices (together with timesheets) to the first\n                    defendant fortnightly based on the daily manpower lists. Usually, the defendants\n                    would pay the plaintiffs within five days of the issuance of the\n                    invoices. 7       It was the plaintiffs’ case that prior to\n                    its sale to Universal, the first defendant did not issue purchase orders\n                    (“PO”) to the former. However, after Exterran became the owner,\n                    the first defendant issued POs to the plaintiffs upon the work being\n                    completed. 8       According to the plaintiffs’ version (as\n                    given in Weng’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief [“AEIC”]),\n                    Weng was told by BT in 2007 that the first defendant was losing money (of about\n                    $8m) on project 1008 but BT could not divulge this to Universal as otherwise BT\n                    would not achieve a higher price for the first defendant. To conceal such\n                    losses, Weng alleged that BT called him to a meeting and requested Weng to issue\n                    credit notes so that the expenses incurred by the first defendant on project\n                    1008 could be reduced thereby erasing the losses. BT promised to pay the\n                    plaintiffs all the sums stated in the credit notes by utilising funds from\n                    future projects that were profitable. 9       Based on BT’s assurances, Weng deposed\n                    that the second plaintiff issued the following credit notes which were backdated\n                    at BT’s request:- DateNumberAmount $(a)(b)28 June\n                                        200703 January\n                                        2008CN027/2007/UHIN/BTCN001/2008/UHIN/BT550,228.73198,771.27   The defendants agreed that the first credit note was actually issued\n                    on 12 December 2007 but asserted that the second credit note was not\n                    backdated. Gary was alleged by the plaintiffs to have stopped making payment on\n                    the plaintiffs’ invoices. This resulted in the plaintiffs being unable to\n                    pay their workers. When BT requested him to provide additional subcontract works\n                    for project 1045, Weng said the plaintiffs could not. As a result, Gary made\n                    cash advances of $312,000 to Wong so that the plaintiffs could carry on working\n                    on project 1045. Weng deposed that Gary wrongly asked for the return of the\n                    advances even though that meant that the plaintiffs had paid the salaries of\n                    their workers without receiving any payment from the first\n                defendant. 10     Weng alleged that as the first defendant could\n                    not pay the plaintiffs due to its impending sale to Universal, Gary used the\n                    second defendant to make advances to the plaintiffs. Weng further alleged that\n                    BT instructed the plaintiffs and other subcontractors of the first defendant to\n                    stop issuing invoices to the first defendant and to issue them instead to the\n                    second defendant. 11     BT on the other hand deposed that from the\n                    very beginning of their relationship, Wong constantly requested the first\n                    defendant for advances/loans for subcontracted jobs. Initially, BT acceded to\n                    the request to help Wong with his cash-flow. However over time, BT discovered\n                    that the practice of asking for advances became themodus\n                        operandiof the plaintiffs/Wong’s operations. Other\n                    subcontractors of the first defendant also requested cash advances but to a\n                    lesser extent than the plaintiffs/Wong. BT was concerned about the practice and\n                    after consulting Gary, the brothers decided that a mechanism had to be\n                    instituted to verify that the quantum of advances/loans requested was justified\n                    as the first defendant’s practice of making advances had thus far been too\n                    liberal. That decision led to the incorporation of the second defendant in\n                    August 2006. At that time, it was uncertain whether the impending sale to\n                    Universal of the first defendant would materialise. The sale was eventually\n                    concluded on 26 November 2006. 12     After the incorporation of the second\n                    defendant, Gary was tasked with handling the invoices issued by contractors to\n                    the first defendant. He would scrutinise the invoices for over-claims and assess\n                    whether a contractor’s request for advances should be granted and to what\n                    extent. The second defendant followed up by disbursing payments to contractors\n                    which sums the first defendant would later reimburse. 13     Against the above backdrop, BT deposed in his\n                    AEIC that the defendants made the following payments to the plaintiffs:- DateNature of paymentAmount $(a)(b)(c)(d)3 April\n                                        200821 May\n                                        200822 May\n                                        200831 May\n                                        2008AdvanceAdvanceAdvanceAdvance152,000.0015,000.00312,000.0010,000.00489,000.00   of which the plaintiffs had repaid the first advance\n                    ($152,000). 14     As it was against the policy of Universal to\n                    make cash advances, BT deposed that Gary instructed the plaintiffs not to issue\n                    invoices to the first defendant but to issue them to the second defendant so\n                    that the latter could reconcile the advances it had made against the\n                    plaintiffs’ invoices in its books of accounts. 15     BT admitted that the plaintiffs did issue the\n                    two credit notes set out in[9]above but,\n                    contrary to Weng’s testimony, they were issued due to the\n                    plaintiffs’ breaches of the subcontracts for the projects. For convenience\n                    however, both credit notes only referred to project 1008 as BT thought payment\n                    for the other projects had more or less been completed. He denied Weng’s\n                    allegation that the defendants had promised but failed to pay the second\n                    plaintiff on other projects in exchange for the credit notes. BT pointed out\n                    that the defendants did give full credit for the first credit note of\n                    $550,228.73 but only $35,741.76 for the second credit note, leaving a balance of\n                    $163,029.51 in the defendants’ favour. 16     BT deposed it was patently untrue for the\n                    plaintiffs to allege that he had asked Weng to deliberately reduce the\n                    liabilities of the first defendant so that the company could be sold to\n                    Universal at a higher price. He pointed out that it made no sense for him to\n                    transfer the first defendant’s liabilities to the second defendant as the\n                    sale to Universal was generally based on 75% of the first defendant’s\n                    earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortization\n                    (‘‘EBIDTA’’) for the fiscal years ending 31 March\n                    2007, 2008 and 2009 and, he had wholly funded the second defendant. Transferring\n                    the liabilities to the second defendant only meant he would have to bear the\n                    liabilities personally whereas leaving them with the first defendant made no\n                    significant impact on the consideration he would receive from Universal because\n                    of the manner in which the sale price to Universal was calculated. The\n                    plaintiffs’ allegation could not be true in any event because project 1008\n                    was never unprofitable – in fact it made a profit of $7,442,928.51 for the\n                    first defendant (for which BT produced statements of accounts to the\n                    court). 17     BT revealed that from 2006 onwards, the\n                    plaintiffs committed repeated breaches of the works under the projects and\n                    project 1045. These included placing unsuitable/unskilled or insufficiently\n                    skilled workers on jobs and providing poor or non-existent supervision of\n                    workers. BT ascertained from his staff that the reason for the plaintiffs’\n                    deteriorated standards in workmanship was due to the fact that they were\n                    recruiting unskilled labourers and then training them to do jobs meant for\n                    skilled workers, in order to cut costs. The plaintiffs also overcharged the\n                    second defendant by invoicing for 50 workers when in reality only 25 workers\n                    were supplied to the first defendant. 18     The substandard labour provided by the\n                    plaintiffs had an adverse impact on the first defendant in particular on project\n                    1008. That project was a $30 million contract awarded by Petreco\n                    International Inc for the construction of three process modules which were\n                    ultimately to be shipped to Brazil. Due to the plaintiffs’ poor\n                    workmanship which also delayed the project, additional work amounting to US$2.8\n                    million had to be done in Brazil. As a result, the first defendant’s\n                    expected revenue of US$27,480,426.00 from project 1008 was reduced to\n                    US$24,680,426.00. 19     In addition, the defendants came to know that\n                    the second plaintiff had failed to pay Goods and Services Tax\n                    (“GST”) when the first defendant was appointed the second\n                    plaintiff’s agent under the GST Act by a letter from the Inland Revenue\n                    Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) dated 17 March 2008, for\n                    outstanding GST amounting to $416,687.63. After receipt of the aforesaid letter\n                    from IRAS, the first defendant remitted a sum of $85,275.69 to IRAS on or about\n                    29 May 2008 and was released as the second plaintiff’s agent.\n                    Subsequently, the first defendant received (between 17 December 2008 and 5\n                    February 2010) five more similar letters from the IRAS. However, no payment was\n                    made by the first defendant to IRAS as the second plaintiff’s appointed\n                    agent as, by 15 July 2008, the parties (according to the defendants but\n                    denied by the plaintiffs) had entered into a compromise agreement with the\n                    result that no monies were subsequently due to the second plaintiff from the\n                    first defendant.",
        "The Compromise Agreement": "54     I had set out the full text of the Compromise\n                    Agreement earlier at[23]. Contrary to the\n                    submission of the plaintiffs, I find no ambiguity in the text such as to require\n                    the application of thecontra proferentumrule. 55     To elaborate, the parties to the agreement\n                    were set out: “U-Hin” can only refer to the first and second\n                    plaintiffs while “Wong Eng’g” must refer to the third\n                    plaintiff. The words ‘‘final settlement” are clearly stated\n                    while “all outstanding invoices/payment/claims including but not limited\n                    to...” reinforced the understanding that the agreement was to be a global\n                    settlement of all accounts between the parties. As for the note “the\n                    above is subjected [sic] to the return of all advance payments and CN amounting\n                    to $582,771 prior to the issue of the final settlement payment”, the\n                    words could only have referred to the advances made to and the credit notes\n                    issued by, the plaintiffs since neither the first nor the second defendants were\n                    the recipients of advances or issuer of credit notes. Consequently, the\n                    plaintiffs’ argument that the Compromise Agreement precluded the\n                    defendants from recovering the advances and the credit note sums is\n                    rejected. 56     Do the words “...pending the\n                    confirmation of BTG/1035 VO claims of $80,000” render the Compromise\n                    Agreement conditional? I do not think so. I accept the evidence of BT that the\n                    lump sum settlement of $450,000 was subject to adjustment downwards but not\n                        upwards, vizthe amount could be less but not\n                    more than $450,000 as that figure was the maximum sum the defendants were\n                    willing to pay to the plaintiffs. The law 57     I turn next to the law on compromise\n                    agreements. I can do no better in this regard than to refer to the recent Court\n                    of Appeal decision inGay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence\n                        Peter[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 (“Gay’scase”) cited by the defendants. 58     InGay’scase, the Court of Appeal cited Foskett QC’s authoritative textbook (at\n                    [41]) on what constituted a valid compromise agreement: In the leading Commonwealth textbook on compromise and settlements,\n                        Foskett QC sets out the following definition of a “compromise”\n                        (see David Foskett,The Law and Practice of\n                            Compromise(Sweet & Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2005) at\n                        para 1-01) (“Foskett”): Compromise can be defined as thesettlement of dispute\n                            by mutual concession, its essential foundation being the ordinary law of\n                            contract… A more practical and, perhaps, more apt\n                        description would bethe complete or partial resolution\n                            by agreement of differences before final adjudication by a court or\n                            tribunal of competent jurisdiction[emphasis added] 59     The Court of Appeal went on to spell out (at\n                    [46]) the essential requirements of a compromise: As Foskett has observed (at para 3-01), and adopted inInfo-communications(at [115]), a compromise will\n                        not arise unless certain requirements are fulfilled; these include\n                        (differing somewhat, though, from the precise sequence Foskett has adopted)\n                        what is, in fact, traditionally required under the general common law of\n                        contract,viz, an identifiable agreement that\n                        is complete and certain, consideration, as well as an intention to create\n                        legal relations. 60     The Compromise Agreement satisfies all three\n                    tests. The agreement is certainly identifiable, consideration was provided by\n                    both parties to the agreement and undoubtedly there was an intention to create\n                    legal relations. It was also common ground that both parties intended to resolve\n                    all their differences by the Compromise Agreement. It would not be necessary\n                    therefore to dwell further on this issue.",
        "The pleadings": "35     It would also not be necessary to set out the\n                    parties’ pleadings either as the same was alluded to earlier. It is to be\n                    noted however that the plaintiffs’ statement of claim was amended twice.\n                    Initially, the first plaintiff made a claim for $416,872 for its final invoice\n                    no. 0061/2008 based on the defendants’ PO No. 38967 dated 3 October\n                    2008 ($389,600 plus 7% GST amounting to $27,272). Subsequently, the second and\n                    third plaintiffs were made parties to the action. The statement of claim was\n                    amendedin extensoand the claims were increased\n                    to $867,237.12 (not including 7% GST) as being owed to the first plaintiff by\n                    the first defendant, $1,185,990.07 as being owed by the first defendant to the\n                    second plaintiff, $71,198 as being owed by the first defendant to the third\n                    plaintiff and $261,870.21 as being owed to the second plaintiff by the second\n                    defendant. The claims totalled $2,447,002. 36     At the commencement of trial, the plaintiffs\n                    amended and reduced their claim to the outstanding sum ($1,823,258.49). It was\n                    also established from Weng’s testimony (at Notes of Evidence\n                    (“N/E”) 53-54) that the first plaintiff was not registered for GST\n                    with the relevant authorities at the material time. Consequently, the first\n                    plaintiff was not entitled to claim any GST from the defendants, whether based\n                    on 7% or on any other rates. 37     I should add that the defendants have a\n                    counterclaim against the plaintiffs. The counterclaim in its final form was for\n                    the unpaid balance of $163,029.51 due under the second credit note issued by the\n                    plaintiffs in[9]above and for the three\n                    sums of $10,000, $50,000 and $20,000 initially advanced by Gary which debts were\n                    subsequently paid and taken over by the second defendant.",
        "The evidence": "",
        "(i)   The plaintiffs’ case": "38     Weng and Wong were the plaintiffs’ two\n                    key witnesses. As I have set out the plaintiffs’ version of events in\n                    earlier paragraphs, I move straight to a review of the evidence adduced from the\n                    brothers in their cross-examination. 39     Weng (PW1) made significant concessions on the\n                    defendants’ case when he was questioned by counsel for the defendants.\n                    First, he agreed that the meeting with BT and Gary was to settle all invoices of\n                    the plaintiffs on a lump sum basis. He then agreed that the discussions\n                    culminated in the Compromise Agreement (see N/E 31/32). 40     In his AEIC (para 33), Weng claimed that\n                    he agreed to accept $450,000 in full and final settlement of the\n                    plaintiffs’ outstanding invoices on the basis that the defendants’\n                    cash advances in[9]would be written off. He\n                    alleged that after he had signed the Compromise Agreement, he reminded BT that\n                    the defendants were to repay the plaintiffs’ credit notes from payments\n                    for future projects. However, BT had responded that he did not want to pay the\n                    plaintiffs anymore. Counsel for the defendants pointed out to Weng that in view\n                    of BT’s response, it was illogical of Weng to then contend (in his AEIC)\n                    that the Compromise Agreement (see[23]) was\n                    subject to the defendants’ return of the credit note amounts. It is\n                    noteworthy that the Compromise Agreement only referred to the plaintiffs’\n                    obligation toreturnadvances made by the\n                    defendants, there was no mention that the defendants had torefundthe credit note sums of $550,228.73 to the plaintiffs\n                    (see[9]). 41     When the above fact was pointed out by counsel\n                    for the defendants during his cross-examination (at N/E 42),Weng took refuge in\n                    the excuse that in actual fact, he did not know what was written in the\n                    Compromise Agreement. Questioned by the court (at N/E 43) whether he had signed\n                    the document blindly, Weng prevaricated and said he had signed the Compromise\n                    Agreement based on issues that were agreed between himself and BT. Weng admitted\n                    that he was given an opportunity to read the Compromise Agreement but he could\n                    not understand it. I disbelieve Weng’s unconvincing explanation. It was\n                    not the plaintiffs’ pleaded case that Weng did not understand the\n                    Compromise Agreement on the basis ofnon est\n                        factum. Neither was it the plaintiffs’ pleaded case (as\n                    stated in para 29 of the plaintiffs’ closing submissions) that Weng\n                    was under pressure from various sources (not identified) and felt he had no\n                    choice but to sign the Compromise Agreement. Further, no evidence was led on\n                    this spurious allegation. 42     Weng’s AEIC (para 15) as well as\n                    the reply and defence to counterclaim had alleged that the credit note for\n                    $550,228.73 was issued at BT’s behest to conceal losses incurred on\n                    project 1008 from the first defendant’s buyer. Quite apart from BT’s\n                    denial, this was a wild and absurd allegation in the light of BT’s\n                    explanation (see[16]) as to how the sale\n                    price to Universal was calculated and the fact that project 1008 was actually\n                    profitable, based on documents produced by BT. 43     It was more likely than not (as the defendants\n                    contended), that the plaintiffs agreed to and issued two credit notes because\n                    they were in breach of contract in providing substandard and/or defective works\n                    to the defendants, as evidenced in the defendants’ documents (at\n                    DB37-149). While I am mindful that these documents did not form part of the\n                    agreed documents before the court, I note that counsel for the plaintiffs did\n                    not raise strenuous objections when they were referred to by BT nor did he\n                    challenge their authenticity. In their closing submissions (at para 37),\n                    the plaintiffs merely said that the defendants provided a sampling of random\n                    examples of alleged minor breaching of the subcontracts, nothing\n                more. 44     I note further that Weng eventually agreed\n                    with counsel (at N/E 49) that the defendants’ position on the Compromise\n                    Agreement was correct. Weng further agreed that some of the plaintiffs’\n                    claims (including that for GST) were unfounded and or fabricated amongst them\n                    being the unpaid invoice for $663,400 – which Wong eventually admitted (at\n                    N/E 107) was never sent to the defendants. No mention was made by Weng in his\n                    AEIC of the claim for $20,000 which the defendants disputed. In\n                    cross-examination of Weng, Wong’s complaint in his AEIC that the second\n                    defendant was attempting to recover personal loans ($10,000, $20,000 and\n                    $50,000) made by Gary to Wong was proven to be incorrect. While the moneys came\n                    from Gary initially, Gary had subsequently been reimbursed by the second\n                    defendant so that the debt was owed to the latter. 45     Nothing turns on Wong’s testimony as it\n                    was Weng who negotiated with BT and signed the Compromise Agreement on the\n                    plaintiffs’ behalf. Wong confirmed that what he knew of the discussions\n                    and negotiations between his brother and BT was what he was told by Weng. Hence,\n                    Wong’s AEIC was replete with hearsay evidence. Like Weng, Wong’s\n                    AEIC (albeit to a lesser extent) contained speculation and scurrilous\n                    accusations against BT and Gary, regarding BT’s motive in incorporating\n                    the second defendant. Offensive paragraphs in his and Weng’s AEIC were\n                    eventually withdrawn when they took the stand.",
        "(ii)   The defendants’ case": "46     BT (DW2) and Gary (DW1) were the\n                    defendants’ witnesses. Unlike Wong and Weng, their testimony did not\n                    contradict but was corroborated by documents that were before the court. They\n                    were far more credible witnesses than the Wongs. Indeed, their cross-examination\n                    reinforced my finding. In this regard I reject the plaintiffs’ submission\n                    that BT was an evasive and unreliable witness. That criticism can be levelled at\n                    Weng and to a lesser extent Wong, but not against BT or Gary; both were\n                    forthright and truthful. Weng on the other hand was found to be lying on so many\n                    occasions that he lost all credibility.",
        "The decision": "47     The plaintiffs’ closing submissions were\n                    premised on the plaintiffs’ version of events being true and correct.\n                    Sometimes those submissions completely disregarded or contradicted the evidence\n                    that was adduced in court from the plaintiffs’ own witnesses. I note too\n                    that the plaintiffs’ submissions (para 30) asserted that the\n                    Compromise Agreement was signed by BT on behalf of the first defendant only and\n                    not on behalf of the second defendant. That however was not the\n                    plaintiffs’ pleaded position nor asserted by Weng in his AEIC nor put to\n                    BT when he was in the witness stand. Consequently, I reject the\n                argument. 48     The plaintiffs’ pleaded case on the\n                    Compromise Agreement was that it did not come into effect because of the\n                    non-fulfilment of the preconditionsvizconfirmation of the two variation claims of $122,017.17 and $80,000. However, as\n                    the defendants argued and which I accept, there were no preconditions, only the\n                    requirement of confirmation of whether the two variation clams had been paid by\n                    the defendants as BT thought. 49     The plaintiffs’ stand was sometimes\n                    ambivalent. Although they disclaimed knowledge (in para 62 of their\n                    submissions) on how the figure of $582,771 in the Compromise Agreement was\n                    arrived at and even accused BT of creating the same, it is noteworthy that in\n                    another part of their submissions (at para 41), the plaintiffs complained\n                    that the defendants reneged on their promise to return the credit note sum of\n                    $749,006 or even $582,771. The plaintiffs had obviously overlooked BT’s\n                    explanation that the amount of $582,771 was incorrect and should have been the\n                    first credit note amount of $550,228.73 in[9]which was never in dispute. 50     Although Wong/Weng contended that they were\n                    not obliged to return the defendants’ advances, the fact remains that the\n                    plaintiffs repaid the defendants the first advance of $152,000 in[13]on or about 15 July 2008, in part\n                    performance of the Compromise Agreement. Moreover, in the first amendment to the\n                    statement of claim (at para 10), the plaintiffs themselves gave credit for\n                    the defendants’ third advance of $312,000 on 2 September 2008. Such\n                    conduct seriously undermined the plaintiffs’ case and the credibility of\n                    their witnesses. 51     The plaintiffs’ submissions dealt at\n                    length with the issue of extrinsic evidence not being admissible to interpret\n                    the Compromise Agreement as well as the application of thecontra proferentumrule. With respect, those issues do not arise\n                    here. It is my view that the Compromise Agreement is clear on its terms and\n                    there is no need to import extraneous facts for its\n                interpretation. 52     The documents presented in court were\n                    consistent with the defendants’ position, as given by BT and Gary that\n                    after end January 2008, any work carried out by the plaintiffs must be\n                    accompanied by a PO. Their testimony that invoices of the plaintiffs subsequent\n                    to that timeframe, if unaccompanied by the defendants’ POs were either\n                    false or fabricated, was substantiated by no less a person than Weng, who had\n                    admitted (see[44]above) that the\n                    plaintiffs’ invoice for $663,400 was never sent to the defendants; it can\n                    only be said to have been fabricated as BT and Gary contended. 53     Taken in its totality, the evidence adduced in\n                    court showed on a balance of probabilities that the plaintiffs’ claim had\n                    no merit. More significantly, the evidence corroborated the defendants’\n                    pleaded case that the claims and counterclaims between the parties involved had\n                    been subsumed in the Compromise Agreement. I turn my attention therefore to that\n                    document.",
        "The other defences": "61     Even if I am wrong in my finding and the\n                    Compromise Agreement does not constitute a valid compromise agreement, I am of\n                    the view that the defendants have successfully proven on a balance of\n                    probabilities, that the plaintiffs’ invoices upon which their numerous\n                    claims were based were either (i) paid or (ii) cancelled or (iii) fabricated.\n                    Indeed, the plaintiffs’ claims bordered on dishonesty. I have in mind\n                    Weng’s evidence in this regard; he was a totally unreliable witness as can\n                    be seen from the comments on his testimony in[39]to[44]above.",
        "Conclusion": "62     Consequently, I have no hesitation in\n                    dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims with costs. I award both defendants\n                    judgment and costs on their counterclaim for $163,029.51 and judgment for\n                    $80,000 in favour of the second defendant only.",
        "Addendum to Judgment": "30 August 2010",
        "Lai Siu Chiu J:": "63     After judgment was delivered, the court was informed by the defendants’ solicitors that they had made an Offer to Settle (“the OTS”) pursuant to O 22A r 9(3)(b) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) to the plaintiffs on 18 February 2010. The OTSinter aliastated the defendants were willing to pay the sum of $100,000 to the plaintiffs in full and final settlement of all claims with each party bearing its own costs. The defendants gave a deadline of 5 March 2010 to the plaintiffs to accept the OTS failing the same would be deemed to be withdrawn. There was no response from the plaintiffs’ solicitors on the OTS. 64     Under O 22 r 9(3)(b) of the Rules, the terms of the OTS were more favourable to the plaintiffs than the judgment herein, as I had dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims. Consequently, the defendants are entitled to their costs on a standard basis up to and including 18 February 2010 and thereafter they are entitled to costs against the plaintiffs on an indemnity basis."
