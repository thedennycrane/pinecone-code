        "Introduction": "1 In this application, Ms Li Jialin and Mr Li Suinan (the “Applicants”) principally sought the return of $1,195,354.42 (less any amount refunded to date) from Wingcrown Investment Pte Ltd (the “Respondent”), along with interest at a rate of 5.33% per annum. The Applicants had paid the sum of $1,195,354.42 to the Respondent pursuant to two abortive attempts to purchase a residential property (the “Property”). Although it was undisputed that the sale had been terminated due to repeated defaults by the Applicants, the Applicants submitted that the Respondent was not entitled to retainanypart of this sum. Out of this sum, the Respondent had returned $488,957.04 to the Applicants prior to the commencement of proceedings and submitted that it was entitled to retain the balance of $706,397.38. 2 After hearing the parties’ submissions, I held that the Respondent was entitled to forfeit $380,000 as a true deposit and that the Respondent was to retain the remaining $326,243.07 pending the determination of its claim of equitable set-off in an assessment of damages hearing to be heard by an Assistant Registrar. As the Respondent had made an offer to settle that was without prejudice save as to costs, I reserved the matter of costs to the Assistant Registrar, who would be able to determine whether the net sum found payable to the Applicants after any set-off would fall below the settlement offer. I also ordered the Respondent to pay pre-judgment interest on the moneys found payable to the Applicants. The Applicants have appealed against my decision to dismiss their application, my decision that interest was to run only in respect of the net sum of money that is eventually found to be repayable to the Applicants after the assessment of damages hearing, as well as my decision to reserve the matter of costs and the applicable rate of interest to the Assistant Registrar. I set out my grounds in full below.",
        "Facts": "3 The Respondent is the developer and vendor of a residential development that included the Property. The Applicants are citizens of the People’s Republic of China and reside abroad. The parties were legally represented at all material times and principally corresponded through their respective solicitors.",
        "The first attempted purchase": "4 On 5 December 2015, the Respondent issued the Applicants an Option to Purchase (“OTP 1”) in respect of the Property, at the purchase price of $1,785,000. On 28 December 2015, the parties entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA 1”). Pursuant to cl 7.4(d) of SPA 1, the Respondent was entitled to forfeit and keep 20% of the purchase price (amounting to $357,000) should SPA 1 be “annulled” by the Respondent following a repudiation of the contract by the Applicants. Under cl 7.4(c) of SPA 1, the Respondent was also entitled to recover from prior payments “all interest, property tax, maintenance charges and other amounts owing and unpaid” under SPA 1 as at the date of annulment and “all costs and expenses legal or otherwise” incurred in relation to the recovery of possession of the Property.1Foot Note 1×Affidavit of Koh Chin Beng dated 16 May 2023 at pp 48–49.Both OTP 1 and SPA 1 were in the standard form prescribed under the Housing Developers Rules. 5 On 12 March 2018, SPA 1 was annulled by the Respondent. It was undisputed that this termination was valid as the Applicants had defaulted on their payment obligations. The Respondent informed the Applicants that pursuant to cl 7.4 of SPA 1, the Respondent was entitled to the sum of $379,195.58, comprising the $357,000 deposit as well as deductions for interest on outstanding payments, maintenance fees, and tax reimbursements. By then, a total of $1,217,550 had already been paid by the Applicants. The Respondent said that the remaining $838,354.42 would be returned to the Applicants.2Foot Note 2×Affidavit of Koh Chin Beng dated 16 May 2023 at pp 88–89.",
        "The second attempted purchase": "6 Despite the termination of SPA 1, the Applicants remained interested in purchasing the Property and commenced negotiations with the Respondent. To demonstrate their “utmost sincerity” and to plead for a “final chance”, the Applicants’ solicitors wrote to the Respondent on 3 and 4 April 2018, seeking the Respondent’s “kind indulgence to allow [the Applicants] to continue the purchase of the Property on the same terms”.3Foot Note 3×Affidavit of Li Jialin dated 25 April 2023 at pp 142–144.Although the Respondent refused to continue on the terms of SPA 1 and reiterated that SPA 1 had already been annulled, negotiations eventually resulted in the grant of a fresh Option to Purchase dated 17 April 2018 (“OTP 2”). Under OTP 2, the revised purchase price for the Property was $1,900,000.4Foot Note 4×Affidavit of Li Jialin dated 25 April 2023 at pp 129–135. 7 OTP 2 is a single document. It sets out the terms of the Option to Purchase, followed by a section headed “Terms of Sale” which sets out the terms that would become operative upon exercise of the Option to Purchase. The preamble to OTP 2 recorded the chronology of events leading up to the grant of OTP 2. Recital III of the preamble to OTP 2 noted that: Out of the Original Price, the sum of Singapore DollarsThree Hundred And Seventy-Nine Thousand One Hundred And Ninety-Five and Cents Fifty-Eight($379,195.58)(the \"Forfeited Amount\") was deducted by the [Respondent] pursuant to Clause 7.4 of the SPA and the sum of Singapore DollarsEight Hundred and Thirty-Eight Thousand Three Hundred and Fifty-Four and Cents Forty-Two ($838,354.42)is to be to be returned to the [Applicants] (the \"Refund Amount\") subject to the terms of the SPA … [emphasis in original] Recital IV stated that: [The Applicants have] requested the [Respondent] to:- a. issue the [Applicants] a fresh option to purchase the Property at the price of Singapore DollarsOne Million Nine Hundred Thousand ($1,900,000.00)(the \"Purchase Price\"); b. out of the Forfeited Amount, not to forfeit the sum of Singapore DollarsThree HundredAnd Fifty-Seven Thousand ($357,000.00)and to instead credit that sum towards the option fee payable under the fresh option to purchase the Property; and c. notwithstanding the terms of the SPA, not refund the Refund Amount to the [Applicants] unless it is in accordance with Clause C below; and d. to transfer and credit the Refund Amount towards the deposit payable under the fresh option to purchase the Property in accordance with Clause B below, in the event the [Applicants] exercises the Option in accordance with Clause B below … [emphasis in original] Clause A of OTP 2 stated that the grant of OTP 2 was in consideration for the payment of the “Option Fee”, being the $357,000 already received by the Respondent as recorded in Recital IV. 8 Pursuant to cl B of OTP 2, the Applicants were required to deliver OTP 2 and a signed acceptance copy to the Respondent by 30 April 2018 to properly exercise OTP 2. By such exercise, the Applicants would “irrevocably authorise and direct the [Respondent] to credit the Refund Amount towards payment of the Deposit (defined below) less the Option Fee”. Pursuant to cl C of OTP 2, upon the due exercise of OTP 2, “the Option Fee already paid by the [Applicants] will be credited to the Purchase Price, and there shall be a binding contract for the sale and purchase of the Property between the parties hereto on the ‘Terms of Sale’ set out below”. Conversely, should the Applicants fail to properly exercise OTP 2, the Respondent would be entitled to forfeit the “Option Fee” (the $357,000) and the Respondent would return the “Refund Amount” (the $838,354.42) to the Applicants. 9 Under the section headed “Terms of Sale”, cl 1 of OTP 2 set out various definitions and interpretations, the most salient of which was that: \"Deposit\" means Singapore DollarsOne Million One HundredAnd Ninety-Five Thousand Three Hundred And Fifty-Four and Cents Forty-Two Only (S$1,195,354.42)and shall form part of the Purchase Price. [emphasis in original] The sum of $1,195,354.42 was derived from the $1,217,550 that had already been paid to the Respondent, less the deductions that the Respondent was entitled to make pursuant to cl 7.4(c) of SPA 1 (at [5] above). In other words, the sum comprised the $357,000 originally paid as a deposit under SPA 1, as well as the $838,354.42 that the Respondent would otherwise have returned to the Applicants following the termination of SPA 1.5Foot Note 5×Affidavit of Li Jialin dated 25 April 2023 at paras 20-22; Affidavit of Koh Chin Beng dated 16 May 2023 at para 28. 10 On 30 April 2018, the Applicants exercised OTP 2. The Applicants were therefore obliged to pay the balance of the $1,900,000 purchase price on the completion date, which was ten weeks from the date of OTP 2 (26 June 2018). Under the section headed “Terms of Sale”, cl 2 of OTP 2 incorporated The Law Society of Singapore’s Conditions of Sale 2012 (the “Conditions”). Condition 15 of the Conditions concerns the issuance of a notice to complete, which requires the recipient to complete the transaction within 21 days after the day of service. Condition 15.9 provides that:6Foot Note 6×Respondent’s Bundle of Authorities dated 28 June 2023 at pp 119–120. If the Purchaser does not comply with the terms of any effective Notice to Complete served by the Vendor under this Condition, then the following terms apply: (a) on the expiry of the Notice to Complete or within such further period as the Vendor may allow, the Purchaser must immediately return all title deeds and documents in his possession that belong to the Vendor; (b) the Purchaser must at his own expense procure the cancellation of any entry relating to the Contract in any register; and (c)without prejudice to any otherrights or remedies available to him at law or in equity, the Vendormay: i.forfeit and keepany depositpaid by the Purchaser; and ii. resell the Property whether by auction or by private agreement without previously tendering a Conveyance to the Purchaser. [emphasis added] 11 It was undisputed that the Applicants failed to complete on 26 June 2018 as required under OTP 2. Despite several extensions of time and repeated reminders by the Respondent, the Applicants failed to perform their payment obligations.7Foot Note 7×Affidavit of Li Jialin dated 25 April 2023 at pp 167–193.The Respondent thus served the Applicants a notice to complete dated 24 October 2018.8Foot Note 8×Affidavit of Li Jialin dated 25 April 2023 at p 195.Despite the notice, the Applicants failed to complete within 21 days and the Respondent notified the Applicants that OTP 2 had been terminated by way of a letter dated 20 November 2018. In that letter, the Respondent expressly reserved its right to forfeit under Condition 15.9 of the Conditions.9Foot Note 9×Affidavit of Li Jialin dated 25 April 2023 at p 197.The Applicants accepted that OTP 2 was validly terminated.10Foot Note 10×Affidavit of Li Jialin dated 25 April 2023 at para 55. 12 The Respondent thereafter attempted to sell the Property to third parties, eventually completing the sale of the Property on 14 April 2021.11Foot Note 11×Affidavit of Koh Chin Beng dated 16 May 2023 at paras 54-55. 13 From the available evidence, the parties next corresponded by way of a “letter of appeal” dated 1 March 2019, wherein the Applicants explained the reason for their repeated defaults and asked for the Respondent to show “empathy” and to “help mitigate [the Applicants’] losses … by refunding them the money of SGD$1,195,354.42 that they had paid todate [sic]”.12Foot Note 12×Affidavit of Li Jialin dated 25 April 2023 at pp 206–207.By an email dated 29 April 2019, the Respondent declined to return the sum of $1,195,354.42 and reasserted that its rights under Condition 15.9 of the Conditions were reserved.13Foot Note 13×Affidavit of Li Jialin dated 25 April 2023 at pp 279.Further appeals by the Applicants were turned down by the Respondent on 4 June 2019 and 3 October 2019.14Foot Note 14×Affidavit of Li Jialin dated 25 April 2023 at pp 281 and 284.In consequence, the Respondent retained the sum of $1,195,354.42.",
        "The letter of demand": "14 The Applicants next wrote to the Respondent close to four years later, issuing a letter of demand dated 21 March 2023. In a change of tack, the Applicants demanded the return of the entire sum of $1,195,354.42 along with interest at a rate of 5.33% per annum calculated from 20 November 2018 to the date of payment. The Applicants claimed that the “deposit” of $1,195,354.42 had to be returned in full as it was not a true deposit and operated as a penalty.15Foot Note 15×Affidavit of Li Jialin dated 25 April 2023 at p 292. 15 On 10 April 2023, the Respondent informed the Applicants that it would return $488,957.04 out of the $1,195,354.42. The Respondent took the position that it was entitled to:16Foot Note 16×Affidavit of Li Jialin dated 25 April 2023 at p 296. (a) forfeit 20% of the purchase price of $1,900,000 stated in OTP 2, being the sum of $380,000; and(b) set-off the sum of $326,397.38 as reasonable fees and expenses incurred as a result of the termination of SPA 1 and OTP 2. I pause to observe that, for the purposes of this application, the Respondent subsequently reduced the amount of fees and expenses claimed as a set-off to $326,243.07 after reviewing the documents in relation to this matter.17Foot Note 17×Affidavit of Koh Chin Beng dated 16 May 2023 at para 77. 16 On 19 April 2023, as promised, the Respondent paid the sum of $488,957.04 to the Applicants.",
        "Summary of the parties’ cases": "17 The Applicants primarily prayed for the following orders: (a) a declaration that the sum of $1,195,354.42 paid to the Respondent was not a true deposit; (b) a declaration that the forfeiture of the sum of $1,195,354.42 was an unenforceable penalty; and (c) an order that the Respondent repay the sum of $1,195,354.42 (less the $488,957.04 already repaid) with interest at a rate of 5.33% per annum calculated from 20 November 2018 to the date of full payment. 18 The Applicants submitted that although the sum of $1,195,354.42 was labelled as a “deposit” under OTP 2, it amounted to approximately 63% of the purchase price of the Property and was thus neither moderate nor customary. It therefore could not be forfeited as a true deposit. In any event, the Respondent was not expressly entitled to forfeit 20% of the purchase price of $1,900,000 under any of the terms of OTP 2. The Applicants thus submitted that the forfeiture of the sum of $1,195,354.42 became subject to the penalty rule and was unenforceable as an extravagant and unconscionable penalty. Furthermore, the Applicants submitted that the Respondent was not entitled to set-off any fees or expenses and should have commenced a separate claim to prove its damages, which the Applicants argued were unreasonable and unsubstantiated. Accordingly, the Applicants submitted that the Respondent was not entitled to any part of the $1,195,354.42, and that the Applicants were entitled to pre-judgment interest on the entire sum pursuant to s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act 1909 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Civil Law Act”) for being wrongfully kept out of use of the moneys.18Foot Note 18×Applicants’ Written Submissions dated 28 June 2023 at paras 35, 53, 79, 81–85, and 103. 19 The Respondent submitted that despite having defaulted on both SPA 1 and OTP 2, the Applicants were in effect attempting to convert their breaches of contract into an interest bearing “fixed deposit account”. By claiming the return of the full sum of $1,195,354.42 plus interest at 5.33% per annum, the Applicants would be rewarded for their default and profit from what would essentially be an advantageous “risk-free transaction”. The Respondent submitted that only $380,000 had been forfeited, which represented 20% of the purchase price. This was reasonable as earnest money and was thus forfeitable as a true deposit. The Respondent was contractually entitled to forfeit pursuant to Condition 15.9(c)(i) of the Conditions (“Condition 15.9(c)(i)”), which empowered the Respondent to “forfeit and keepanydeposit paid” by the Applicants. The Respondent also submitted that it was entitled to equitable set-off and that the court should direct an assessment of damages to determine the quantum of damages to be set-off.19Foot Note 19×Respondent’s Written Submissions dated 28 June 2023 at paras 8, 59, 62-63, 87; NE, 5 July 2023, at p 13.Although the Respondent did not initially make detailed submissions on the issue of pre-judgment interest, it developed its position on the applicable period and quantum of pre-judgment interest in its further submissions.20Foot Note 20×Respondent’s Further Written Submissions dated 8 August 2023 at paras 60–62 and 64.",
        "Issues determined": "20 Consequently, the following issues arose for my determination: (a) whether the Respondent was entitled to forfeit;(b) whether Condition 15.9(c)(i) was a penalty;(c) whether the Respondent was entitled to equitable set-off, and if so, whether an assessment of damages should be directed; and(d) whether the Applicants were entitled to interest.",
        "Whether the Respondent was entitled to forfeit": "21 Both parties agreed on the key legal principles governing the forfeiture of deposits but disputed the application of those principles to the facts. Both parties also agreed that in the context of a sale and purchase of real property, 20% of the purchase price was the “magic number” and that a deposit of such amount would be customary and moderate, and thus be forfeitable as a true deposit.21Foot Note 21×Applicants’ Written Submissions dated 28 June 2023 at para 41. 22 Although the Applicants initially submitted that there was nothing in OTP 2 that entitled the Respondent to forfeit 20% of the purchase price of $1,900,000,22Foot Note 22×Applicants’ Written Submissions dated 28 June 2023 at paras 50–53.the Applicants subsequently agreed at the hearing that the Respondent had purported to rely on the express right to forfeit under Condition 15.9(c)(i) (at [10] above). The crux of the dispute was thus the proper interpretation of Condition 15.9(c)(i).23Foot Note 23×NE, 5 July 2023, at pp 7–8.In particular, the issue was whether on a proper construction of Condition 15.9(c)(i), the Respondent was entitled forfeit such sum it considered reasonable as a true deposit, namely 20% of the purchase price.",
        "Applicants’ case": "61 The Applicants submitted that they were entitled to interest on the entire sum of $1,195,354.42 at a rate of 5.33% per annum, with interest running from the date that OTP 2 was terminated, 20 November 2018, until the date of repayment. Of this total, interest on the sum of $488,957.04 was to run from 20 November 2018 to 19 April 2023, and interest on the balance moneys in the hands of the Respondent was to run until the date of full repayment. 62 The Applicants sought to be compensated by way of interest, on the basis that they had been wrongly held out of money to which they were entitled. Relying on the Court of Appeal decision ofGrains and Industrial Products Trading Pte Ltd v Bank of India and another[2016] 3 SLR 1308 (“Grains and Industrial Products”) at [138], the Applicants submitted that interest should be awarded for the period starting from the date of their entitlement to the money until the date the money was repaid. The Applicants submitted that they were entitled to pre-judgment interest during the period starting from the date the cause of action arose to the date of judgment pursuant to s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act. The Applicants also argued that they had not been dilatory in bringing these proceedings, as they had written letters of appeal to the Respondent from 1 March 2019 (at [13] above). 63 As for the rate of interest, the Applicants submitted that the rate of 5.33% per annum should be applied.40Foot Note 40×Applicants’ Written Submissions dated 28 June 2023 at paras 81–101.According to the Applicants, the Respondent had failed to provide an evidential basis supporting the rate of interest they proposed, citing the High Court decision ofNoor Azlin bte Abdul Rahman and another v Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd and others[2021] SGHC 10 (“Noor Azlin”) at [222].41Foot Note 41×Applicants’ Further Written Submissions dated 8 August 2023 at paras 66–67.",
        "Respondent’s case": "64 The Respondent submitted that no interest should be awarded on any moneys found payable to the Applicants out of the retained sum of $326,243.07. If the Respondent is found to have over-deducted the quantum of money it was entitled to set-off at the assessment of damages, it nevertheless ought not be required to pay interest as the Respondent had acted reasonably and in good faith in its estimation of its set-off.42Foot Note 42×Respondent’s Further Written Submissions dated 8 August 2023 at para 44. 65 The Respondent also submitted that the period of interest should begin on 10 April 2023, the date on which the Respondent actually exercised the power to forfeit, or on 21 March 2023, the date on which the Applicants first formally demanded the return of the entire sum.43Foot Note 43×NE, 5 July 2023, at pp 11–12. 66 Finally, the Respondent submitted that the rate of 5.33% per annum should not be applied. This was because the Respondent itself did not and could not have earned interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum. Instead, the Respondent submitted that a rate of 1.28% per annum was more appropriate, being derived from the average annual rate of interest income the Respondent actually received on its other funds during the equivalent period. Alternatively, the Respondent submitted that the issue of the applicable rate of interest should be dealt with by the Assistant Registrar hearing the assessment of damages, where submissions and evidence could be tendered.44Foot Note 44×Respondent’s Further Written Submissions dated 8 August 2023 at paras 60–62 and 64.",
        "Decision": "67 Three distinct issues were engaged. First, whether interest should be awarded. Second, if interest was awarded, the applicable rate of interest. Third, the period for which any interest should be awarded. 68 I agreed with the Applicants that they ought to be compensated for being kept out of use of moneys to which they were entitled, in the form of interest on that amount. I therefore rejected the Respondent’s submission that no interest should be awarded on any moneys found payable to the Applicants out of the retained sum of $326,243.07. 69 The court has a wide discretion to award pre-judgment interest under s 12 of the Civil Law Act. Pre-judgment interest serves to compensate a successful claimant for the time value of money, the use of which was lost between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date of the judgment. In other words, pre-judgment interest recognises that the claimant had been wrongfully kept out of moneys by the defendant, who had enjoyed the use of it during that period. However, a claimant is not entitled to interest as of right, and the court is entitled to exercise its discretion in the manner best able to achieve justice in the circumstances of each case. Nevertheless, interest would generally be awarded if the claimant succeeds at proving that it had been wrongly held out of money to which it was entitled (Grains and Industrial Productsat [137]–[138] and [142]). 70 InGrains and Industrial Products, the Court of Appeal identified a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court could consider in the exercise of its discretion (at [140]): (a) in the absence of a prescribed rate, what rate of interest would be appropriate to the relevant period(s);(b) whether the claimant was dilatory in the bringing and conduct of the proceedings;(c) whether the claimant had received compensation for the loss suffered from a source other than the defendant;(d) whether the claimant had sought and been awarded damages which include damages for the loss of the use of money;(e) whether the debt is paid immediately after proceedings are commenced; and(f) whether the parties have agreed that pre-judgment interest should not be recoverable. 71 In my judgment, interest must be awarded on the sum of $488,957.04. The Respondent did not dispute that it was not entitled to this sum and had in fact already returned it to the Applicants on 19 April 2023. 72 Interest must also be paid on thenetsum found payable to the Applicants out of the retained sum of $326,243.07, if any, after the conclusion of the assessment of damages. In line with the rationale and purpose of pre-judgment interest, the Applicants areonlyentitled to be compensated interest on such sum that is found to have belonged to them (in other words, moneys the Respondent ought not to have claimed as set-off). If the Respondent is found to have properly set-off the entire sum of $326,243.07, the Respondent is entitled to retain that entire sum and the Applicants cannot be said to have been wrongfully kept out of use of the moneys. 73 I did not accept the Respondent’s submission that no interest should be awarded on any sum found payable to the Applicants. First, it was the Respondent who had not been ready to fully substantiate their claim for expenses with sufficient evidence at the time of the hearing and it was the Respondent who had asked for the assessment of damages. Second, the onus is now on the Respondent to make the application for an assessment of damages. Hence, the Respondent ought to bear the cost of keeping the Applicants out of use of money that the Applicants are entitled to, in the form of interest. 74 The next issue was the period for which interest was to accrue, which was similarly a matter of discretion. Although any interest awarded should generally run from the date the loss accrued, the court retains a wide discretion to award interest from a later date, such as where there has been an unjustifiable delay on the part of the claimant in bringing the claim (see the High Court decision ofCrescendas Bionics Pte Ltd v Jurong Primewide Pte Ltd and other appeals[2023] 1 SLR 536 at [219]). The discretion to determine the appropriate period to award pre-judgment interest is also found in s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act, which provides: In any proceedings tried in any court of record for the recovery of any debt or damages, the courtmay,if it thinks fit, order that there shall be included in the sum for which judgment is given interest at such rate as it thinks fit on the whole or any part of the debt or damages for the whole orany part of the periodbetween the date when the cause of action arose and the date of the judgment. [emphasis added] Accordingly, the general approach of awarding interest from the date the loss accrued is only the default starting point that represents themaximumperiod for which pre-judgment interest may be awarded (see the Court of Appeal decision ofRobertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd and another[2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 at [100]). 75 I did not accept the Respondent’s submissions on the starting date for the interest period. Although I accepted the force behind their submission that a demand for the return of the deposit had to be sufficiently clear, I did not accept their submission that such clarity could only be found in the form of a formal letter of demand from a party’s solicitors. The Respondent had submitted that interest should only accrue from 21 March 2023, the date of the formal letter of demand issued by the Applicants’ solicitors. While the correspondence from the Applicants, which had been drafted by their solicitors, had used language such as “appeal and entreat” and not the language of a formal demand, the Applicants had nevertheless made clear that they were asking the Respondent to refund “the money of SGD$1,195,354.42 that [the Applicants] had paid todate [sic]” (at [13] above). It was hence sufficiently clear that the Applicants were asking for the return of the deposit in this letter. Not all purchasers may be able to avail themselves of the services of legal counsel. As a matter of general principle, the form of the demand or the use of specific language cannot be determinative, provided that there is sufficient clarity in what the purchaser is seeking. In my view, the Applicants had made it sufficiently clear in their letter dated 1 March 2019 that they were seeking the return of the sum of $1,195,354.42. 76 I thus awarded interest on the sum of $488,957.04, for the period starting on 2 March 2019 to 18 April 2023. As for any sum found payable to the Applicants after the conclusion of the assessment of damages, I awarded interest on such sum to be calculated from 2 March 2019 to the date of payment. 77 In relation to the applicable rate of interest, the Applicants had relied uponNoor Azlinin support of their submission that the rate of 5.33% per annum should be applied. I noted that the court inNoor Azlinhad reached its conclusion in that case because of the lack of any explanation for why a different rate of interest was justified (Noor Azlinat [222]). In this case, the Respondent had contended that it could not have earned interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum on the retained sums and was seeking to prove its actual annual income rate. This would more properly reflect the consequences of being kept out of use of the money. I considered it fair to allow the Respondent the opportunity to develop its stance on the appropriate rate of interest at the assessment of damages, bearing in mind that no substantive submissions had yet been made on this issue.",
        "Whether Condition 15.9(c)(i) was a penalty": "52 As stated, under the framework set out inHon Chin Kong, the penalty rule would not be applicable if the forfeiture was of a true deposit. As I had found that the Respondent was entitled to forfeit the sum of $380,000 as a true deposit, the issue of whether Condition 15.9(c)(i) was a penalty became academic. 53 For completeness, I did not accept the Applicants’ alternative argument, which emerged in their further submissions, that Condition 15.9(c)(i) would have been subject to the penalty ruleregardlessof whether the Respondent was entitled to forfeit a true deposit.35Foot Note 35×Applicants’ Further Written Submissions dated 8 August 2023 at paras 24–35.As stated, the penalty rule did not apply to true deposits. True deposits need not be a genuine pre-estimate of loss and may be forfeited regardless of the actual loss caused by the breach. To apply the penalty rule to true deposits would depart from its purpose of serving as earnest moneys and defeat the very concept of deposits.",

        "Whether the Applicants were entitled to interest": "60 The final issue was whether the Applicants were entitled to interest. As I have held that the Respondent was entitled to forfeit the sum of $380,000 as a true deposit, the Applicants were not entitled to any interest on that sum. The issue of interest thus arose only in relation to two sums. First, the sum of $488,957.04 that had been repaid to the Applicants on 19 April 2023. Second, the sum of $326,243.07 that was retained by the Respondent pending the conclusion of the assessment of damages.",
        "Conclusion": "78 To conclude, I held that the Respondent was entitled to forfeit the sum of $380,000 as a true deposit. The Respondent is to apply for an assessment of damages to determine the amount it may set-off against the retained sum of $326,243.07. The rate of interest to be applied to the repaid sum of $488,957.04 as well as for any sum determined to be payable to the Applicants after the set-off is also to be determined at the assessment of damages. 79 The Respondent had submitted that the issue of costs of the hearing may be affected by the eventual orders made at the assessment of damages, in light of a without prejudice letter, and asked that it be decided by the Assistant Registrar hearing the assessment of damages. I accepted this submission and made no order on costs, reserving it to the Assistant Registrar hearing the assessment. As for the hearing of further arguments, I fixed costs in favour of the Respondent at $9,000, including disbursements.
