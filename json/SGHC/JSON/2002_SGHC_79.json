        "The apportionment of the matrimonial assets": ".4.    The husband is in his early 50s and has been unemployed for a\n\nwhile. He vehemently denied the submission by Ms Jasvendar Kaur, counsel for the wife,\n\nthat his unemployment was self-imposed. He has, he said, tried hard to get employment but,\n\ninspite of his many years of experience in the electronic and mechanical engineering\n\ntrade, his age was against him and he could not secure employment even at in lower\n\npositions and at considerably reduced wages. Being unemployed, the only way he could\n\nsupport himself and his younger son (and pay the monthly maintenance to his wife) was to\n\nutilise his share of the matrimonial assets to generate sufficient income or, failing\n\nthat, dip into his capital (ie his share of the matrimonial assets).5.    The husband argued that just as he had to support himself (and his\n\nyounger son) from his 60% share of the matrimonial assets, so too could the wife support\n\nherself from her 40% share of the matrimonial assets. He argued that the District Judge,\n\nin ordering him to pay maintenance to his wife, had not sufficiently taken into account\n\nthe fact that whilst his share of the matrimonial assets had to be utilised for himself\n\nand his younger son, the wife’s share of the matrimonial assets was only for herself.\n\nHe therefore urged the court to either grant him a greater share of the matrimonial assets\n\nor reduce/cancel the maintenance payable to the wife.6.    Miss Kaur pointed out that the Notice of Appeal did not\n\nspecifically cover maintenance and submitted that, unless the court granted leave to the\n\nhusband to appeal out of time, the court should not vary the apportionment of the\n\nmatrimonial assets to reflect the obligation on the husband to maintain the wife or\n\nentertain any submissions on maintenance. It could well be argued, as the husband did in\n\nthis case, that the apportionment of matrimonial assets and the provision of maintenance\n\nwere inter-connected and that an appeal on the apportionment would necessarily involve an\n\nappeal on the maintenance. But even if that was not so, I was prepared to grant the\n\nhusband leave to raise the question of maintenance.7.    In her Grounds of Judgment, the District Judge explained that it\n\nwas because of the fact that the husband would have to support his younger son that she\n\napportioned to him 60% share of the matrimonial assets instead of the 50% share that she\n\nwould otherwise have allowed. The District Judge did not factor into that apportionment\n\nthe husband’s obligation to maintain the wife. This is understandable as maintenance\n\npayments are not ordinarily taken into account in determining how matrimonial assets are\n\nto be distributed. However, in a case like this – where the husband is of relatively\n\nadvanced age and unemployed and where the reality is that the only source of sustenance\n\nfor him at present and in the years to come would be from his share of the matrimonial\n\nassets – there does not seem to be any reason why the court should not factor the\n\nobligation to pay maintenance into the equation in determining the apportionment of the\n\nmatrimonial assets.8.    In the present case, however, the wife will, in fact,\n\nnot obtain the bulk of her share of the other matrimonial assets –\n\nin particular her share of what is in the husband’s CPF account – until the\n\nhusband attains the age of 55 years, which is still some 3 years away. It seems to me\n\nappropriate that until such time as the wife obtains her full share of the matrimonial\n\nassets, the husband should be required to maintain her. Thereafter she and the husband can\n\nmeet their financial needs from their respective shares in the matrimonial assets.9.    I therefore upheld the decision of the District Judge that the\n\nmatrimonial assets be apportioned in the ratio 60:40 but ordered that the $300 per month\n\nmaintenance ordered by the District Judge be payable to the wife only up to June 2005 by\n\nwhich time her 40% share in the husband’s CPF funds would have been released to her\n\nand she would have received in full her share of the matrimonial assets.",
        "Quantifying the \"other matrimonial assets\"": ".10.    The District Judge had not quantified the value of the\n\nmatrimonial flat: its value was to be dependent on the price it fetched when sold. This\n\nwas as it should be. In respect of the \"other matrimonial assets\" however, the\n\nDistrict Judge quantified the value of each asset as follows:1.Mewah View Condominium in Malaysia$90,0002.DBS autosave account$ 46,3943.POSB savings account$ 2,2194.RHB bank account A$ 7735.RHB bank account B$ 3236.Citibank account$ 9907.SCB savings account$ 2088.CPF ordinary account$ 61,4509.Shares – CPF Investment account$140,00410.CDP shares account$ 16,75311.Malaysian shares$ 28,65612.Thailand shares$ 4,41013.Chinese Swimming Club$ 3,00014.Pinetree Club$ 12,00015.Penang Club$ 2,700TOTAL:$409,880Less: Liability to creditors$ 34,200NET VALUE:$375,680Having arrived at the nett value of $375,680 the District Judge rounded\n\noff the wife’s 40% share of the nett assets at $150,000 and ordered the husband to\n\npay that sum to the wife.11.    The husband, at the hearing of this appeal, pointed out that he\n\njust did not have cash anywhere near $150,000 with which to comply with the order made\n\nagainst him. He pointed out that the amount of $61,450 stated to be in his CPF ordinary\n\naccount and $140,004 stated to be in his CPF investment account could not be withdrawn by\n\nhim until he reached the age of 55 years. He further pointed out that figure of $409,880\n\nadopted by the District Judge as the gross value of the other matrimonial assets was a\n\nmere estimate and until the assets were actually realised the value would be just\n\nconjecture. In that context, he pointed out that the property market and the share market\n\nhad in recent times suffered rapid decline and the values adopted by the District Judge\n\nwere just not realistic. A fairer order for the District Judge to have made,\n\nhe submitted, would have been – as she did in respect of the matrimonial flat\n\n– to order that the other matrimonial assets be sold within a time-span prescribed by\n\nthe court and the proceeds apportioned between him and the wife in the ratio of 60:40.12.    There was merit in the husband’s submission. It was not\n\nappropriate, in this case, for the court to fix the value of the other matrimonial assets\n\nand require one party to pay to the other party in cash the share of the other party. All\n\nthat the court can do (in the absence of consent) is order the sale of the assets so that\n\nthe sale proceeds can be apportioned between them.13.    For the above reason I set aside the order of the District Judge\n\nordering the husband to pay the wife the sum of $150,000 and made specific orders (some of\n\nthem by consent) in relation to each asset. In respect of the CPF investment account, I\n\nauthorised the husband to sell the shares held in that account and I further authorised\n\nthe wife to place a charge on the funds in the CPF ordinary account and the\n\nCPF investment account in order to secure her 40% interest. As for the Mewah View\n\nCondominium, I ordered the husband to sell the property within 6 months and pay 40% of the\n\nnett sale proceeds to the wife in Malaysian Ringgit. As for the memberships in the Chinese\n\nSwimming Club and the Penang Club (of which he was an absent member), the husband was\n\nprepared to pay to the wife 40% of the value determined by the District Judge. In respect\n\nof the Pinetree Club, I accepted the submission of the husband that as a result of recent\n\nevents the membership was no longer marketable and so could not be given any value.Sgd:S.
