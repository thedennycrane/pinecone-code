        "Introduction": "1       The plaintiff is a painting\n                    contractor and the defendant is a manufacturer and supplier\n                    of paint. The full account of the background to the dispute\n                    arising between the parties is set out inAnti-Corrosion Pte Ltd v Berger Paints Singapore Pte\n                        Ltd and another appeal[2011]\n                    1 SLR 427 (“the CA\n                    decision”).",
        "Background": "2       For the purpose of this\n                    judgment, which deals solely with the assessment of damages,\n                    it suffices to set out the following salient facts. The\n                    plaintiff was subcontracted to paint the surfaces of a\n                    building project at Bukit Batok Street 23 (‘the\n                    Bukit Batok project”) which included: (a)     a 9-storey ramp\n                        up building (“Building A”);\n                        and (b)     a 30-storey building\n                        (“Building B”). It\n                    bought the defendant’s paint for that purpose. The\n                    plaintiff applied the paint to the surfaces of the building\n                    project based on the defendant’s proposed paint\n                    system. However, there was extensive discolouration. The\n                    plaintiff bought replacement paint from a third party,\n                    Haruna (S) Pte Ltd, and repainted both the discoloured and\n                    adjacent areas in the buildings. Although the original\n                    painting works took 7.5 month to complete, the\n                    repainting works took 16 months. Subsequently, the\n                    plaintiff brought the present action claiming damages for\n                    the expense of repainting. It claimed that the defendant had\n                    given a warranty for the paint so long as the use of the\n                    paint was based on the defendant’s proposed paint\n                    system. The defendant denied that the paint was defective\n                    and brought a counterclaim against the plaintiff for the\n                    contract price of the goods supplied. It also denied that it\n                    had given any enforceable warranty covering the paint\n                    supplied. 3       InAnti-Corrosion Pte Ltd v Berger Paints Singapore Pte\n                        Ltd[2010] SGHC 351, I found that the\n                    plaintiff had not proven its case (namely that the defects\n                    in the paint had caused the discolouration) on a balance of\n                    probabilities. I also observedobiterthat if I had decided on the issue of\n                    the warranty, I would have found that the defendant had\n                    warranted all its products used in any of the\n                    plaintiff’s projects for a period of five years,\n                    provided that the use was based on a proposed paint system\n                    by the defendant. The plaintiff appealed. The defendant\n                    cross-appealed on the question of the\n                warranty. 4       The Court of Appeal\n                    dismissed the defendant’s cross-appeal on the warranty\n                    at [27]: ... Joseph Yong made his statements to\n                        Vincent Lim intending the latter to rely on them. We\n                        therefore find the following assurances given by Joseph\n                        Yong were express terms of the contract: (a)    the Respondent's Decora\n                                Emulsion paint would be fit for application on\n                                the internal surfaces of the Bukit Batok\n                                project, without the need for a sealer coat;\n                                and (b)    the provision of a\n                                five-year warranty for the paints used in the\n                                Bukit Batok project, provided the use of paint\n                                was based on a proposed paint system by the\n                                Respondent:\n                                see [9] and [10] above as\n                                well as [42]-[45] below. 5       The Court of Appeal allowed\n                    the plaintiff’s appeal and made the following\n                    findings: 38    Accordingly, we find that the\n                            paint discolouration was more likely than not caused\n                            by defects in the Decora Emulsion paint supplied by\n                            the Respondent. There has therefore been a breach of\n                            the express term of the contract that the\n                            Respondent's paint would be free from defects and\n                            fit for application on the internal surfaces of the\n                            Bukit Batok project, without the need for a sealer\n                            coat (see [27(a)] above). This finding obviates the\n                            need to consider whether there is a breach of the\n                            implied terms of the SGA. 6       This assessment of damages\n                    follows the Court of Appeal’s findings.",

Where\n                    oral evidence is inconsistent with documentary evidence, and\n                    no adequate explanation has been provided, the court may\n                    well be justified in relying solely on what can be proven\n                    through documentation and not the oral testimony, as was the\n                    case inBocatra Construction Pte Ltd v\n                        Thorkildsen[1994] 2 SLR(R) 387 at\n                        [31]. I bear\n                    these principles in mind as I turn to consider each item\n                    claimed by the plaintiff. 9       The plaintiff claims that\n                    the entire area that required repainting were as\n                    follows: (a)     176,882 m² being\n                        the equivalent of about 6 out of 9 storeys of Building\n                        A; and (b)     100,883 m² being the equivalent of\n                        about 19 out of 30 storeys of\n                    Building B. This means that three\n                    storeys of Building A and 11 storeys of Building B\n                    did not require repainting by reason of discolouration or\n                    had not been originally painted with the Berger paint. The\n                    plaintiff had originally issued a letter of demand for\n                    repainting, of $443,243.20 (excluding the cost of paint).\n                    The plaintiff also claims the costs of a sub-contractor who\n                    repainted Building B.",

The\n                    plaintiff submits invoices and pay slips for these other\n                    heads of claim.

The difference in\n                    the position taken by the respective parties lies in the\n                    fact that the defendant’s expert allowed for a 10%\n                    increase in time “in view of the difficulties\n                    encountered during repainting works due to the installed\n                    mechanical and electrical services”, whereas the\n                    plaintiff’s expert found that 20% would be a more\n                    realistic cost “resulting from difficulties\n                    encountered due to the need to cut-in around installed\n                    mechanical and electrical services, and the protection to\n                    windows”. In its closing submissions, the plaintiff\n                    adopted the middle ground of 15% in its computations. The\n                    figure of 15% appears to have been accepted as a reasonable\n                    one by the defendant’s expert in cross-examination.\n                    Taking all the above into account, I accept that the figure\n                    of 15% is not unreasonable. 21     With respect to\n                    item (b), I note the plaintiff’s expert\n                    witness’s evidence that the plaintiff had deployed an\n                    average of 19.89 workers per month during the original\n                    painting works, and 23 workers per month during the\n                    repainting works. Given that more workers were used on\n                    average during the repainting works than the original\n                    painting works, I had difficulty accepting that the time for\n                    repainting would have been extended at all due to shortage\n                    of labour, let alone by such a wide margin as 50%. This is\n                    especially since the repainting work for Building B had\n                    been outsourced to Swiss Plan which had completed all of its\n                    sub-contracted works by February 2009. The plaintiff’s\n                    workers only had to repaint 6 storeys of Building A.\n                    Based on the foregoing, I would reject the plaintiffs uplift\n                    based on item (b). 22     As for Item (c), the\n                    plaintiff is claiming that it took extra time for repainting\n                    due to the lack of a scissors lift, which it used during the\n                    original works. However, the plaintiff additionally claims\n                    $81,579.95 for the “Rental of Portable Scaffolding,\n                    Scissors Lift and Boom Lift” for the entire period of\n                    repainting as evidenced by an invoice for the period June\n                    2008 to September 2009 for “scaffolding, scissor lift\n                    and boomlift”. As I have allowed some claim for extra\n                    time on Item (a) and (d), I would make no double counting\n                    arising from the alleged non-use of the scissors lift in the\n                    repainting. 23     As for Item (d), the\n                    plaintiff has led evidence to show that sanding off was an\n                    additional step required before repainting could take place\n                    given that no sealer coat was applied. Although the\n                    defendant challenged whether the plaintiff did or needed to\n                    sand off the entire painted surface,ie, specifically the internal surfaces to be\n                    repainted, no alternative reasonable figure was proposed and\n                    given that in cross-examination, the defendant’s\n                    witness Chin Cheong appeared to have accepted the\n                    sanding-off in principle, I find that the figure of 10%\n                    submitted by the plaintiff is not\n                unreasonable. 24     In the premises, I find\n                    that the plaintiff’s claim of 16 months for\n                    repainting was inflated. The claim should be reduced to a\n                    figure of approximately 6.05 months, arising from the\n                    following: 4.78 months x 115% x 110% = 6.05\n                        months. 25     The plaintiff is therefore\n                    only entitled to recover $238,855.93 for the salary costs of\n                    its workers’ deployed to repaint Building A\n                        (ie, 6.05\n                        ÷ 16 x $631,685.09 =\n                    $238,855.92).",
        "Dinner for workers": "26     The defendant challenges\n                    the sum claimed under this head (ie, $34,668.00) on largely the same basis as\n                    it challenges the amount claimed for worker’s salary.\n                    Given my adopting of a 6.05 months proxy for the\n                    completion of repainting the 6 storeys of Block A, and\n                    not the 16 months claimed, I accordingly reduce the sum\n                    claimed proportionately to $13,108.84 ,ie, $34,668.00 x (6.05 ÷\n                    16) = $13,108.84.",

        "Consumable tools": "28     The plaintiff claims\n                    $11,428.35 as the costs incurred to purchase consumable\n                    tools to carry out the repainting works. It has produced\n                    receipts to prove that these costs were incurred. The\n                    defendant do not dispute that these tools were purchased. In\n                    similar vein to Item 3, however, it does challenge\n                    whether these tools were purchasedfor\n                        the purpose of the repainting works. Its case\n                    is that unless the plaintiff discharges its burden of\n                    showing that these tools were purchased for the purpose of\n                    the repainting, I should only grant nominal damages. It is\n                    more likely than not that in the course of the repainting,\n                    consumable tools such as turpentine and brushes would be\n                    required. The plaintiff’s has produced evidence of\n                    these tools and affirmed that these tools were purchased and\n                    used in the repainting works. There is no reason to\n                    disbelieve the plaintiff. Absent evidence to the contrary,\n                    the plaintiff has proven its claim under this\n                head.",
        "Upkeep for Vehicle GQ 895L": "29     In this item, the\n                    plaintiff claims petrol, parking and servicing fees as\n                    upkeep for Vehicle GQ 895L (“the\n                    Vehicle”), which it says it used during the\n                    repainting works. The defendant objects to the\n                    plaintiff’s claim under this head on a number of\n                    grounds. First, it repeats its point that the plaintiff\n                    should not be awarded damages unless it can show that a\n                    particular item was used solely for the purpose of the\n                    repainting works and no other. Second, it cites the\n                    plaintiff’s expert’s belief that a reasonable\n                    deduction should be made to account for the “higher\n                    running costs” of using an older vehicle as compared\n                    to a brand new one. 30     As to the first objection,\n                    the plaintiff has produced receipts verifying that it has\n                    spent $11,613.78 on petrol, parking and servicing in\n                    relation to the Vehicle. Its factual witness testified that\n                    these sums were expended in relation to the repainting\n                    works. I accept that testimony. The defendant has not\n                    adduced any evidence to show that the Vehicle was used for\n                    other purposes. It has not adduced any evidence to show that\n                    the expenses were incurred in relation to a different\n                    vehicle. I see no basis for finding that the expenses or the\n                    Vehicle were used for purposes other than the repainting\n                    works. 31     As for the second\n                    objection, the defendant is entitled to claim damages for\n                    expenses reasonably incurred. I do not think it unreasonable\n                    that it should use its existing company vehicle for the\n                    purpose of the repainting works. It was not obliged to\n                    obtain a new vehicle for the purpose. The defendant has also\n                    not quantified how the discount should be\n                applied. 32     What is relevant, however,\n                    is the fact that the sum claimed under this head was\n                    incurred over a period of 16 months which should be adjusted\n                    to 6.05 months proxy. As such, the plaintiff is\n                    awarded: $11,613.78 x (6.05 ÷\n                        16) = $4,391.46",
        "Accommodation for workers by AC Creative Pte Ltd\n                and Cheer Keong Contractor & Construction": "33     The plaintiff claims\n                    $29,393.20 for accommodation of the workers utilised for\n                    repainting works who could not stay on the site of the\n                    building project after February 2009 when the\n                    Building A units were handed back to the main\n                    contractor.

However, it raises the same objections\n                    – first, that the plaintiff has premised its claim on\n                    more man days than actually expended, and second, that the\n                    plaintiff has not proven its case that all the workers\n                    living in the alternative accommodation were used solely for\n                    the purpose of the repainting works. 35     The first objection is\n                    valid in light of my allocation of 6.05 months to\n                    repaint 6 storeys of Building A.

Whilst only the corridors and external\n                    areas of Building A remained to be repainted, the\n                    plaintiff has produced no evidence to establish the number\n                    of workers that he utilised for this remaining area and the\n                    duration of their work and accommodation costs.
