        "Introduction": "1 In this action, CIMB Bank Berhad (“CIMB”) claims against World Fuel Services (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“WFS”) for sums under a deed of debenture dated 15 July 2016 (“the Debenture”). The Debenture assigned to CIMB rights under 11 invoices issued by Panoil Petroleum Pte Ltd (“Panoil”) (“the 11 Panoil Invoices”) and 11 sales confirmations issued by Panoil (“the 11 Panoil Sales Confirmations”). The 11 Panoil Sales Confirmations incorporated terms from a document titled “Panoil’s Terms and Conditions For Sales of Marine Fuel” (“Panoil’s Terms and Conditions”). The aforesaid invoices, sales confirmations and terms and conditions are collectively referred to as “the Sales Documents”. The Sales Documents related to 11 separate sales of marine fuel oil by Panoil to WFS (“the Subject Transactions”).",

        "Background": "2 CIMB is the Singapore branch of a bank incorporated in Malaysia and is licensed to provide banking services in Singapore.1Foot Note 1×KMMEVAEIC, para 3.CIMB provided such services to Panoil. On 2 October 2017, Panoil was placed under judicial management.2Foot Note 2×LSJAEIC, para 14.It has since been wound up. Panoil occupied a different position in the supply chain for marine fuel oil from WFS.3Foot Note 3×LCCAEIC, para 4.Panoil was a physicalsupplierof marine fuel oil to vessels.4Foot Note 4×LCCAEIC, para 4.WFS is a bunkertraderwith access to the supply of marine fuel oil from “oil majors” and cargo traders. 3 CIMB’s banking services to Panoil were governed by a facility letter dated 29 June 2016 (“the Facility Letter”). The loan facility contained therein was secured,inter alia, by an all monies limited debenture over all the goods and/or the receivables and documents representing the goods financed by CIMB. Under the Facility Letter, Panoil was obliged to execute such a debenture.5Foot Note 5×KMMEVAEIC, paras 6 to 7.On 15 July 2016, Panoil purportedly executed the Debenture in favour of CIMB.6Foot Note 6×KMMEVAEIC, para 7; see KKMEV-3 for the copy of the Debenture.In substance, the Debenture assigned certain rights to CIMB. CIMB relies on those rights in this action against WFS. 4 In or around mid-August 2017, CIMB discovered that Panoil was in financial trouble.7Foot Note 7×KMMEVAEIC, para 21.Based on news that Panoil’s bunker crafter operator’s license had been revoked, CIMB realised that Panoil’s operations could suffer.8Foot Note 8×KMMEVAEIC, para 27.CIMB then issued WFS a notice of assignment on 29 August 2017 (“the Notice of Assignment”) of its rights under the Debenture.9Foot Note 9×KMMEVAEIC, para 28. 5 On 22 February 2018, CIMB sought to exercise its rights as the legal assignee under the Debenture against WFS.10Foot Note 10×KMMEVAEIC, para 34.",
        "The witnesses": "6 The following witnesses appeared for CIMB: (a) Bay Gek Qwee (“Ms Bay”), an associate director for trade sales in CIMB.11Foot Note 11×1BAEIC; BGQAEIC, para 1.Ms Bay testified that she had personally sent the Notice of Assignment to WFS. (b) Lai Shing Joo (“Ms Lai”), a relationship manager in CIMB handling Panoil’s affairs.12Foot Note 12×1BAEIC; LSJAEIC, paras 1 and 3.Ms Lai described CIMB’s commercial relationship with Panoil and explained why CIMB had not called Panoil’s former employees as witnesses in the present proceedings. (c) Khoo May May Evelyn Vanessa (“Ms Khoo”), a director of commercial banking in CIMB.13Foot Note 13×2BAEIC; KMMEVAEIC, para 1.Ms Khoo was the main witness for CIMB. She testified extensively on the Subject Transactions and, more generally, on the commercial relationship between CIMB and Panoil. (d) Neo Tiau Gee (“Mr Neo”), the executive director of SDE International Pte Ltd. He has more than 26 years of experience in the bunker industry.14Foot Note 14×1BAEIC; NTGAEIC, para 1.Mr Neo was an expert witness on various matters relating to the bunkering industry.15Foot Note 15×NTGAEIC, para 3.He tendered an expert report (“Mr Neo’s Expert Report”). 7 The following witnesses appeared for WFS: (a) Tan Chee Boon (“Mr Tan”), WFS’ supply manager. Mr Tan was personally involved in WFS’ dealings with Panoil.16Foot Note 16×TCBAEIC, para 1.He testified that WFS had entered into a number of separate contracts with Panoil that gave it certain rights of set-off against Panoil. He explained that the sums due to Panoil under the Subject Transactions had been validly set-off pursuant to various set-off notices. (b) Adrienne Beth Bolan (“Ms Bolan”), the former senior Vice President and Treasurer of WFS.17Foot Note 17×ABBAEIC, para 1.Ms Bolan testified to the authenticity of a key document which WFS relies on in this action. Ultimately, her evidence was not material to the proceedings for the reasons explained at [82]. (c) Loh Chee Choon (“Mr Loh”), the Vice President (Asia Supply) of WFS.18Foot Note 18×LCCAEIC, para 1.Like Mr Tan, Mr Loh testified to the business dealings with Panoil and how the sums owed to Panoil had been validly set off. (d) Tay Liang Seng (“Mr Tay”), the financial controller of WFS.19Foot Note 19×TLSAEIC, para 1.Mr Tay gave evidence on the contracts that WFS had entered into with Panoil, which granted it rights of set-off.

        "WFS’ case": "11 WFS denies the authenticity of the Debenture. WFS also maintains that, as a matter of contractual interpretation, the Debenture did not assign Panoil’s rights under the Sales Documents to CIMB. 12 In addition, WFS does not admit that the Sales Documents governed the Sales Transactions. Instead, WFS claims that each of the Subject Transactions was covered by at least one of the following documents:25Foot Note 25×Defence (Amendment No.2), para 2.2. (a) a contract of affreightment between WFS and Panoil dated 30 December 2016 (“the 2016 COA”); (b) a contract of affreightment between WFS and Panoil dated 11 July 2017 (“the 2017 COA”); (c) a Transportation Agreement M/T “OPHELIA” dated 1 January 2017 (“the 2017 TA”); and (d) an agreement between WFS and Panoil on or around 20 August 2014, providing for the mutual setting off of certain payable sums (“the 2014 Offset Agreement”). 13 I refer to the first three documents collectively as the “Umbrella Contracts”. 14 Essentially, WFS contends that the Subject Transactions were part of a composite “buy-sell” relationship in which Panoil sold fuel oil to WFS before Panoil bought thesamequantity of oil from WFS.26Foot Note 26×Defence (Amendment No.2), para 2.6.Thereafter, the oil would be delivered by Panoil to WFS’ vessels.27Foot Note 27×Defence (Amendment No.2), para 2.6.This arrangement was governed by the Umbrella Contracts and/or the 2014 Offset Agreement. Under these contracts, WFS had rights of set-off exercisable against Panoil. Having exercised these rights against Panoil, WFS claims that it no longer owes CIMB. 15 WFS also denies that cl 8.2 of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions had been successfully incorporated into any of the Sales Documents and, in particular, into the Sales Confirmations. Accordingly, WFS retained its rights of set-off. WFS successfully exercised these rights of set-off against Panoil and is therefore no longer liable to CIMB in respect of the Subject Transactions. Finally, WFS submits that CIMB must prove “loss” in order to succeed in its claims.",
        "Issues to be determined": "16 The following issues arise in this action: (a) whether CIMB has proven the authenticity of the Debenture; (b) have Panoil’s rights under the Sales Documents been assigned under the Debenture; (c) which documents governed the Subject Transactions; (d) in any event, whether WFS was entitled to set-off the sums due under the Subject Transactions before the Notice of Assignment; and (e) whether CIMB is required to prove loss.",
        "Is the Debenture authentic?": "17 The Debenture contains two signatures purportedly belonging to Alvin Yong Chee Ming (“Yong”), Panoil’s former managing director, and Lim Shi Zheng (“Lim”), a director of Panoil. WFS insists that CIMB proves these signatures belong to Yong and Lim. 18 CIMB’s treatment of the original Debenture in this suit is relevant in two aspects. 19 First, the late disclosure of the original Debenture. CIMB disclosed acopyof the Debenture to WFS by way of a letter from its solicitors on 14 February 2018. Similarly, it disclosed a copy of the Debenture in its list of documents dated 28 September 2018. However, the original Debenture was only disclosed to WFS on 24 October 2019, when CIMB’s solicitors wrote to WFS’ solicitors informing them that the “original deed [was] available for [their] inspection…” WFS inspected the original Debenture on 25 October 2019. Having inspected the original Debenture, WFS filed a Notice of Non-Admission (“the Notice”) as required by O 27 r 4(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). The trial commenced on 29 October 2019. No reason was put forward for the late disclosure. 20 Second, although Ms Khoo referred to and exhibited a copy of the Debenture in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the original Debenture was not admitted through any of CIMB’s witnesses. Instead, the original Debenture was first introduced at trial during the cross-examination of WFS’ witness, Mr Loh (see below at [41]).28Foot Note 28×NE, 1/11/2019, p 32. 21 At trial, CIMB did not call Yong and Lim as witnesses to testify to the authenticity of the signatures. CIMB maintains that it cannot trust the credibility of Yong and Lim’s evidence as they are presently being investigated for wrongdoing against it, including for “double financing”.29Foot Note 29×LJSAEIC, paras 27 to 28.CIMB also claims that the Commercial Affairs Department had asked it to assist in investigations against Yong and Lim.30Foot Note 30×LJSAEIC, paras 27 to 28. 22 Despite not calling Yong and Lim as witnesses, CIMB seeks to prove the authenticity of the signatures by relying on s 75(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”). 23 Section 75(1) of the EA provides: Comparison of signature, writing or seal with others admitted or proved 75.—(1)  In order to ascertain whether a signature, writing or seal is that of the person by whom it purports to have been written or made, any signature, writing or seal, admitted or proved to the satisfaction of the court to have been written or made by that person, may be compared by a witness or by the court with the one which is to be proved, although that signature, writing or seal has not been produced or proved for any other purpose. 24 CIMB submits that the signatures of Yong and Lim are clearly authentic upon comparison with their signatures on other documents, the authenticity of which WFS does not challenge.31Foot Note 31×PCS, para 40.CIMB also points to the fact that it had produced the original Debenture for inspection.32Foot Note 32×PRS, para 17.Further, CIMB contends that WFS had not expressly pleaded that Yong and Lim’s signatures were inauthentic.33Foot Note 33×PRS, para 14. 25 While WFS did not expresslypleadthat Yong and Lim’s signatures were inauthentic, it did not admit, in Defence (Amendment No.2), to CIMB’s claims that its banking facilities were secured by the Debenture, and that Panoil had assigned, pursuant to the Debenture, all its rights, title, benefit, interest,etc, under the Sales Documents.34Foot Note 34×Defence (Amendment No.2), paras 3 and 4.WFS also filed the Notice on 26 October 2019 which states that “[WFS] requires [CIMB] to prove the authenticity of [the Debenture] at the trial of this action” [emphasis added].35Foot Note 35×Notice of Non-Admission of Documents dated 26 October 2019.In my view, this placed CIMB on notice to prove the Debenture’s authenticity at trial.",
        "The law": "26 The Court of Appeal inJet Holding Ltd and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and other appeals[2006] 3 SLR(R) 769 (“Jet Holding(CA)”) established the following principles relating to the proof of documents: (a) A party is legally entitled to object to the authenticity of documents. It is entitled to insist that the documents be admitted in accordance with the proper rules of evidence (Jet Holding(CA)at [36]). (b) The general principle is that the party wishing to admit documents into evidence must comply with the provisions of the EA (Jet Holding(CA)at [48]). (c) The relevant provisions on the admission of documents include ss 63 to 67 of the EA (Jet Holding(CA)at [37]). (d) A party is generally deemed to admit authenticity unless he can bring himself within O 27 r 4(2) of the ROC by showing that he had issued a notice of non-admission within the requisite window of time (Jet Holding(CA)at [73]). 27 InJet Holding(CA), the court held that documents exhibited in a supplemental affidavit of evidence-in-chief had not been properly admitted in evidence because the plaintiff failed to adduceprimary evidenceof those documents (ie, the originals). This is required under s 66 of the EA, which provides that documents must be proved by primary evidence except where permitted under s 67 of the EA. Primary evidence is defined in s 64 of the EA as meaning “the document itself [is] produced for the inspection of the court”. The plaintiff failed to show that any of the exceptions for adducingsecondaryevidence (ie, non-original documents) under s 67 of the EA applied. 28 The EA was amended in 2012. One amendment was the addition of s 67A. Section 67A of the EA provides that where a document is admissible under s 32(1), it may be proved by the “production of a copy of that document, or of the material part of it, authenticated in a manner approved by the court”. In other words, where a party satisfies one of the exceptions in s 32(1) of the EA, it may rely on a “copy” of that document. Section 66 must now therefore be read subject to s 67A. Notwithstanding the introduction of s 67A of the EA, the general principles expressed by the court inJet Holding(CA), in my view, continue to be applicable. Although the present case does not centre on the provisions dealt with inJet Holdings (CA),viz, ss 66 and 67, the principles articulated above at [26] are relevant to this dispute, which concerns ss 69(1) and 75(1) of the EA. 29 Even where primary evidence of a document is produced, itsauthenticitymay be in issue. In other words, a party may still insist on the other party proving that the signature belongs to the person who is alleged to have signed it,despitethat party having produced the original document. This point is made clear by the learned authors of Sudipto Sarkar & V R Manohar,Sarkar’s Law of Evidence(Wadhwa & Co, 16th Ed, 2007) (“Sarkar”) at 1248: …There still remains the most important question, viz, the genuineness of the documents produced as evidence, ie, Is a document what it purports to be?The production of a document purporting to have been signed or written by a certain person is no evidence of its authorship. Hence the necessity of rules relating to theauthenticationof documents,ie, proving their genuineness and execution. Proof, therefore, has to be given of the handwriting, signature and execution of a document. InStamper v. Griffin,1856, 20 Ga 312, 320 (Am) Benning, J said: - No writing can be received in evidence as a genuine writing until it has been proved to be a genuine one, and none as a foregery [sic] until it has been proved to be a forgery. A writing, of itself, is not evidence of the one thing or the other. A writing, of itself, is evidence of nothing, and therefore is not, unless accompanied by proof of some sort, admissible as evidence. [emphasis added in italics] 30  In this regard, it is also apposite to cite the observations by the High Court inJet Holding and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd[2005] 4 SLR(R) 417 (“Jet Holding (HC)”) that the mere production of the original document is not sufficient to prove what it purports to be (at [146]): The making, execution or existence of a document has, for instance, to be proven by the evidence of the person who made it or one of the persons who made it, or a person who was present when it was made. InDeutz Far East (Pte) Ltd v Pacific Navigation Co Pte Ltd[1989] 2 SLR(R) 392, the original log book was tendered to court for identification. The court held the log book inadmissible as the person responsible for the logbook who was the master of the vessel was not called as a witness to establish that the log book was the vessel’s log, that the signatures in the log were his and that he kept the log according to the statutory regulations. This decision demonstrates that a mere tender of even the original document is not enough.Documents are not ordinarily taken to prove themselves or accepted as what they purport to be. There has to be an evidentiary basis for finding that a document is what it purports to be. [emphasis added] 31 These observations do not appear to have been disturbed on appeal inJet Holdings (CA). 32 Section 69 of the EA provides: Proof of signature and handwriting of person alleged to have signed or written document produced 69.–(1) If a document is alleged to be signed or to have been written wholly or in part by any person, the signature or the handwriting of so much of the document as is alleged to be in that person’s handwriting must be proved to be in his handwriting. 33 According toSarkar,s 67 of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872 (which is inpari materiawith s 69 of the EA) does not establish a new rule on what kind of proof must be given to prove the authenticity of a signature. Instead, the provision merely embodies what is the universal rule in all cases:he who makes an allegation must prove it(Sarkarat 1249). The general principle is that writing purporting to be of a certain authorship cannot be treated as genuine. There must be someevidenceof its genuineness or its execution (at 1250). 34 There are various ways to prove that a document is authentic and was signed by the person who is alleged to have signed it. The following may be called as a witness: (a) the person who signed the document; (b) the person who witnessed the document being signed; (c) a person who is acquainted with the handwriting of the person who signed the document (see s 49 of the EA); and (d) a handwriting expert (see s 47 of the EA). 35 In addition, under s 75(1) of the EA, the disputed signature can be compared by a witness or by the court with a signature already admitted or proved. Section 75(1) of the EA is similar to s 73 of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872. While s 75(1) of the EA expressly provides that the comparison can be done by the court, s 73 of the Indian Evidence Act is silent on who can undertake the comparison. However, the position under Indian law is clear that the comparison can be undertaken by the court (Sarkarat 1307). Yet, Sarkar points out that the comparison should notnormallybe done by the court: Though, there has been no legal bar to the Judge using his own eyes to compare the disputed writings with the admitted writings; as a matter of prudence,extreme caution,and judicial sobriety,the Court should notnormally take upon itself the responsibility of comparing the disputed signatures with that of the admitted signatures or handwritings and hesitate to base its findings with regard to the identity of the handwritings solely on such comparison made by itself. [emphasis added in italics] 36Yeoh Wee Liat v Wong Lock Chee and another suit[2013] 4 SLR 508 (“Yeoh Wee Liat”)36Foot Note 36×DBOA, Tab 13.concerned two suits to rectify the share register of a company called Next Capital Pte Ltd (“NCPL”). In one suit, HRT Corporation (“HRT”), as plaintiff, claimed that the defendant, Wong, had agreed for it to hold 33% of the total shares in NCPL. The defendant alleged that this agreement was merely a non-binding understanding which was displaced by a subsequent agreement under which the plaintiff was entitled only to a 24.5% shareholding. To corroborate the subsequent agreement, the defendant relied on a share transfer form transferring only 24.5% of NPCL’s shares to the plaintiff. This form was allegedly witnessed by HRT’s sole director, Phuah. HRT filed a notice of non-admission in respect of the share transfer form. Citing s 69 of the EA, Quentin Loh J held that “since HRT has challenged the authenticity of the share transfer form, Wong had to produce the originalandprove that the signature thereon was in fact Phuah’s” [emphasis added]. Wong, however, failed to produce the original share transfer form. Neither did he prove that the signature belonged to Phuah. In the circumstances, the court found that HRT could not be taken to be aware that it had only been allocated 24.5% of the shares (Yeoh Wee Liatat [31]). 37 InRaman Subbalakshmi Krishan v Indian Overseas Bank[1994] SGHC 8, the plaintiff was the bank’s customer, and had purportedly signed two letters of authority. As the bank relied on these letters in its claim, the bank bore the burden of proof. Three bank officers testified on its behalf. The bank also called a senior scientific officer of the Department of Scientific Services. The officer examined the signatures on various documents, and ultimately concluded that theplaintiffhad signed the letters. In other words, they were authentic documents. Having regard to the expert evidence, the court found that the plaintiff had signed the two letters of authority. 38 InBank of India v Dr Pravinchand P Shah[1994] SGHC 276 (“Bank of India”), the bank claimed against the defendant under a guarantee. The defendant argued that the bank had failed to prove the guarantee as required under s 69 of the EA as it did not lead evidence of his signature. The plaintiff provided primary proof of the guarantee by producing it at the hearing. The defendant had admitted in a letter on 1 September 1987 that he was a guarantor to the bank but belatedly denied the existence of the guarantee on 9 September 1988. The court observed that s 69 of the EA does not prescribe the mode of proving the authenticity of a signature, and that the signature may be proved other than by direct evidence. Having regard to the defendant’s conduct, the court was satisfied that he had signed the guarantee. 39 InChua Kim Eng Carol v The Great Eastern Life Assurance[1998] SGHC 403 (“Chua Kim Eng Carol”), the plaintiff claimed for wrongful termination. The defendant had terminated an agency agreement with the plaintiff on the basis that signatures on certain policy documents had been forged by the plaintiff. Despite the defendant calling an expert witness to prove that the signatures had been forged, and the plaintiff calling her own expert witness to prove that the signatures were not forged, Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) found that the plaintiff had not breached the agency agreement by forging the policyholders’ signatures. In doing so, the court made the following observations: (a) There is no requirement in law that the evidence of a handwriting expert must be corroborated. However, it would not be safe, even on a balance of probabilities, to conclude that the documents had beenforged, especially where more direct evidence was available (Chua Kim Eng Carolat [90]). (b) The court should not compare signatures under s 75(1) of the EA especially when more direct evidence is available (Chua Kim Eng Carolat [90]). (c) It was crucial to call the policyholders to testify as to their signatures, which was a matter so clearly within their knowledge (Chua Kim Eng Carolat [91]). (d) The defendant knew its burden at trial. However, the defendant had not shown that it had approached the policyholders or that they had refused to testify (Chua Kim Eng Carolat [91]). (e) If the policyholders turned hostile, they could be impeached. If the impeachment failed, then the defendant’s allegations would not be borne out by the evidence (Chua Kim Eng Carolat [91]). (f) An adverse inference ought to be drawn against the defendant under s 116(g) of the EA (Chua Kim Eng Carolat [91]).",
        "Analysis": "71 The relevant contractual principles are: (a) The law applies an objective approach to questions of contractual formation (R1 International Pte Ltd v Lonstroff AG[2015] 1 SLR 521 (“R1 International”) at [51]). (b) The objective approach involves ascertaining the parties’ objective intentions gleaned from the parties’ correspondence and conduct in the light of the relevant background disclosed by the evidence(R1 Internationalat [51]). (c) The relevant background includes the industry in which the parties are in, the character of the document which contains the terms in question and the course of dealings between the parties (RI Internationalat [51]). (d) In interpreting a contract, it is the parties’ objectively ascertained intentions that are relevant, not theirsubjective intentions(Yap Son On v Ding Pei Zhen[2017] 1 SLR 219 at [30]). 72 Next, I set out the undisputed facts relating to the Subject Transactions. As CIMB was not an original party to these transactions, the account of the various transactions was provided by WFS’ witness, Mr Loh. In this judgment, I refer to each of the Subject Transactions as the 1st Sales Transaction, 2nd Sales Transaction,etc. 73 The parties entered into the 1st Sales Transaction as follows. On 29 June 2017, WFS sent Panoil an order confirmation for the delivery of 1,300 Metric Tons of marine fuel oil from between 5 to 6 July 2017.52Foot Note 52×LLCAEIC, para 39.That same day, Panoil issued a sales confirmation, SO-1706-0986, which stated,inter alia, that the sale was “subjected to the standard terms and conditions of Panoil which is updated from time to time”.53Foot Note 53×LLCAEIC, para 45.On 6 July 2017, Panoil sent WFS an email, attaching a copy of Panoil’s bunker delivery note. This served as confirmation that the fuel oil had been delivered on 6 July 2017. Panoil also attached a copy of its sales invoice (PS-B17/07-0016) in the email to WFS.54Foot Note 54×LLCAEIC, para 46. 74 Generally, all of the Subject Transactions followed the same chronology described above. First, WFS would issue Panoil an order confirmation. Subsequently, Panoil would issue WFS a sales confirmation. Next, upon delivery, Panoil would send WFS a bunker delivery note, which constituted evidence of delivery. Panoil would also send WFS a copy of its sales invoice. 75 In each sales confirmation issued by Panoil to WFS, key details of the sale are provided under the heading “[w]ith reference to our earlier conversation, we are pleased to confirm the nomination with the following details”.55Foot Note 55×LCCAEIC, p 318.These include, among other things, the identities of the buyer and seller, delivery date, product specifications, quantity, and mode of payment. Further, in each sales confirmation, under the heading “terms”, it is provided that “sales [sic] is subjected to the standard terms and conditions of Panoil which is updated from time to time”. 76 Applying the offer and acceptance analysis, WFS’ purchase confirmation is the contractual “offer”, and Panoil’s sales confirmation is the contractual acceptance. 77 An acceptance of an offer is the final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer (Avra Commodities Pte Ltd v China Coal Solution (Singapore) Pte Ltd[2019] SGHC 287 at [51]). InPan-United Shipping Pte Ltd v Cummins Sales and Services Singapore Pte Ltd[2017] SGHC 198 at [83], Chan Seng Onn J observed that in a classic “battle of the forms” scenario, the “last shot” must be a counter-offer in order to destroy the original offer and constitute the new terms on which an agreement is formed, citingButler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corporation (England) Ltd[1979] 1 WLR 401 (“Butler Machine”), the leading decision on “battle of the forms”. InGay Choon Ingv Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332, the Court of Appeal endorsed the analysis of the majority inButler Machinethat the court would examine each “shot” which was “fired” by the respective parties, and only find a concluded agreement when a final and unqualified acceptance has been made (at [63]). In this regard, it has been observed by Dyson LJ inTekdata Interconnections Ltd v Amphenol Ltd[2010] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 357 (“Tekdata”) at [25] that while there is no general rule that applies in all cases where there is a “battle of the forms”, where A makes an offer on its conditions and B accepts that offer on its conditions and performance follows without more, the correct analysis is that there is a contract on B’s conditions. 78 In this case, it is common ground that the sales confirmation issued byPanoilwas the final document sent before delivery of each parcel of fuel oil for each of the Subject Transactions. ApplyingTekdata, each of the Subject Transactions is a separate contract separately embodied under the 11 Panoil Sales Confirmations and the terms contained therein. 79 The terms of the 11 Panoil Sales Confirmations also show that each sales confirmation represents a separate contract for the sale of fuel oil. As mentioned above at [75], each document provides the key details of each sale. These constitute the essential terms of the contract necessary for contractual formation. 80 In establishing which documents governed the Subject Transactions, I also took the relevant commercial background into account (R1 Internationalat [51]). In this respect, I accept Mr Neo’s evidence that it was industry practice to treat sales confirmations as embodying the contracts between the parties. Mr Neo also testified that parties in the bunkering industry treat thesuppliers’salesconfirmationas the governing contract for an individual sale transaction.56Foot Note 56×Neo’s Expert Report, para 39.In this case, Panoil was both the supplier and the party issuing the sales confirmation. The evidence does not suggest that the parties intended to depart from this usual commercial practice. Moreover, the parties had a consistent course of dealing in which all of the key terms were contained in each of the 11 Sales Confirmations. In my view, this indicates that the parties had intended the 11 Panoil Sales Confirmations to govern the Sales Transactions.",
        "What were the rights assigned to CIMB under the Debenture?": "57 WFS claims that Panoil’s rights under the Sales Documents were not assigned to CIMB under the Debenture. In this regard, WFS contends that Ms Khoo had accepted that CIMB was relyingonlyon cll 3.1(c) and 3.1(d) of the Debenture.40Foot Note 40×DWS, para 134.It submits that, on a true construction of these clauses, the Debenture does not assign Panoil’s rights under the Sales Documents. First, cl 3.1(c) provides for the assignment of “allReceivables… relating to or arising from any and allGoodsandRelevantAgreements…” [emphasis added]. “Goods” and “Relevant Agreements” are, however, restricted under cl 1 of the Debenture to matters which did not cover the subject matter of the Sales Transactions. Second, cl 3.1(d) assigns all “Contract Rights”, which WFS also argues did not cover the subject matter of the Subject Transactions. 58 I find that Ms Khoo did not accept that CIMB was relying only on cll 3.1(c) and 3.1(d) of the Debenture as the basis of the assignment of Panoil’s rights under the Sales Documents. While Ms Khoo may have made such a concession during cross-examination, she made it clear during re-examination that CIMB was also relying on cl 3.1(e) of the Debenture.41Foot Note 41×NE, 30/10/2019, pp 102–103.Similarly, CIMB adopts this position in its written submissions and argues that cl 3.1(e) is the operative provision assigning Panoil’s rights under the Sales Documents. WFS further raises the objection that CIMB failed to plead cl 3.1(e) in its statement of claim. 59 At para 4 of CIMB’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No.2), CIMB pleaded as follows:42Foot Note 42×Statement of Claim (Amendment No.2), para 4. … By the Debenture, [Panoil]inter aliaassigned to [CIMB] all its right, title, benefit and interest under the [Sales Contracts] issued by [Panoil] to [WFS], and in all moneys payable by [WFS] to [Panoil] under the said Sales Contracts. 60 In my view, it was not essential for CIMB to have pleaded the specific term of the Debenture so long as its contractual effect is clear. There is support for this proposition in the following extract from Prof Jeffrey Pinsler SC,Principles of Civil Procedure(Academy Publishing, 2013) at para 15.020: The rule is that “the effect of any document or the purport of any conversation referred to in the pleading must, if material, be briefly stated, and the precise words of the document or conversation shall not be stated, except in so far as those words are themselves material”. Therefore, the reference to the effect of the document or purport of the conversation should be brief. The actual words contained in the document or conversation should not be pleaded unless the words themselves have particular significance … 61 The language used in para 4 of CIMB’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No.2) makes plain that CIMB is relying on all the clauses under the Debenture which assigned to it Panoil’s rights, title, benefit and interest under the Sales Documents. Ultimately, cl 3.1 is the main operative provision assigning Panoil’s rights to CIMB. Naturally, it follows that CIMB is entitled to rely on the various sub-clauses therein in its claim against WFS. 62 In any event, I find that WFS did not suffer any prejudice by CIMB’s failure to expressly plead cl 3.1(e). 63 InDoka Formwork Pte Ltd v Grandbuild Construction Pte Ltd[2016] SGHC 248 (“Doka Formwork”), Andrew Ang SJ cited, at [57], the Court of Appeal’s observation inV Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another[2015] 5 SLR 1522 at [40] that the law permits a departure from the general rule of pleadings where no irreparable prejudice would be caused to the other party or where it would be clearly unjust for the court not to do so. In this regard, the court has a “degree of discretion in allowing parties to rely on points that were not expressly or specifically pleaded”. Hence, even though the plaintiff had not pleaded the specific clauses under the contract which it was relying on, the court found that the defendant was not irreparably prejudiced by such failure as: (a) the contract itself was pleaded in the Statement of Claim; (b) the plaintiff’s reliance on the specific contractual clauses became clear when the affidavits of evidence-in-chief were filed; (c) the plaintiff expressly referred to the contract clauses in its opening statement; and (d) the defendant had full opportunity during trial and closing submissions to question the plaintiff’s reliance on those contractual terms and make relevant submissions (Doka Formworkat [58]). 64 Similarly, CIMB had, in its Statement of Claim (Amendment No.2), expressly pleaded that it was relying on the Debenture. And even though Ms Khoo referred only to cll 3.1(c) and 3.1(d) in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief,43Foot Note 43×KMMEVAEIC, para 8.it was made clear during the trial that CIMB was also relying on cl 3.1(e).44Foot Note 44×NE, 30/10/2019, p 107–111.WFS also had the opportunity to make submissions on cl 3.1(e) after Ms Khoo referred to it during re-examination but failed to do so. I do not see how WFS suffered any prejudice from CIMB’s failure to expressly plead cl 3.1(e). Nor did WFS make any submissions on why this was so. 65 Turning to the substantive issue, I find that the language of cl 3.1(e) is sufficiently wide to include Panoil’s rights under the Sales Documents. Clause 3.1(e) of the Debenture provides as follows:45Foot Note 45×2BAEIC, p 446. … [Panoil] … (e)assigns and charges to [CIMB] by way of first fixed security all present and future contract rights, receivables, books and other debts and monetary claimsnow or at any time hereafter due or owing to [Panoil], in consideration of or against which [CIMB] has extended or may hereafter extend banking or credit facilities or accommodation of any kind, together with the full benefit of all guarantees and securities therefor and indemnities in respect thereof and all Collateral Instructions, liens, reservations of title, rights of tracing and other rights enabling [Panoil] to enforce such contract rights, receivables, debts or claims … [emphasis added in bold italics] 66 The language of cl 3.1(e) is contrasted with cll 3.1(c) and 3.1(d). Unlike cll 3.1(c) and 3.1(d), cl 3.1(e) does not capitalise the terms “contract rights”, “receivables” and “debts”. While the terms “Receivables”, “Goods” and “Relevant Agreements” are specifically defined under cl 1 of the Debenture, the terms “contract rights”, “receivables” and “debts”, which are not capitalised, are not. By not capitalising these terms, the parties must have intended to distinguish these terms from their capitalised equivalents under cll 3.1(c) and 3.1(d). Hence, the “contract rights”, “receivables” and “debts” under cl 3.1(e) are not restricted to their definitions under cl 1 of the Debenture. These terms must therefore be given their plain and ordinary meaning in accordance with the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation. In my view, it is clear that the language of cl 3.1(e) is sufficiently wide to include Panoil’s rights under the Sales Documents, these being present or future “contract rights” that were due and owing to Panoil. Pursuant to the Debenture, Panoil’s rights under the Sales Documents were therefore assigned to CIMB.",
        "Which documents governed the Subject Transactions?": "",
        "Parties’ arguments": "67 Both sides dispute the documents which governed the Subject Transactions. 68 CIMB submits that the documents which governed the Subject Transactions were the 11 Panoil Sales Confirmations.46Foot Note 46×PWS, para 91.In brief, CIMB’s case is that each of the 11 Panoil Sales Confirmations is an independent and separate contract containing details such as the quantity, price and delivery date.47Foot Note 47×PWS, para 95.If the 11 Sales Confirmations governed the Subject Transactions, CIMB contends that WFS will not be entitled to any rights of set-off, given that the 11 Sales Confirmations incorporate a clause excluding any right of set-off (see above at [8]). 69 WFS contends that at least one of the Umbrella Contracts and/or the 2014 Offset Agreement governed each of the Subject Transactions. In support of its case, WFS provides the following reasons: (a) CIMB is a stranger to the contractual relationship between WFS and Panoil. Thus, CIMB does not know the parties’ contractual intentions. (b) According to WFS’ witnesses, the parties’ contractual intentions were for the Umbrella Contracts and/or the 2014 Offset Agreement to govern the Subject Transactions.48Foot Note 48×DWS, para 98. (c) Panoil never suggested that the Umbrella Contracts did not govern the Subject Transactions.49Foot Note 49×DWS, para 103. (d) It is illogical for WFS and Panoil to negotiate and enter into the Umbrella Contracts only for them not to apply.50Foot Note 50×DWS, para 104. (e) The 2014 Offset Agreement refers to the right to set off “any sums payable by any entity of Panoil to any entity of [WFS]” against “any amount payable that any entity of [WFS] has to any entity of Panoil”. This right of set off applies toalltransactions between Panoil and WFS, including the Subject Transactions.51Foot Note 51×DWS, para 107. 70 If the Umbrella Contracts and/or the 2014 Offset Agreement governed the Subject Transactions, WFS submits that it is entitled to rights of set-off. In this respect, WFS contends that it hasalreadypaid for the sums due for the Subject Transactions as it had issued various “offset notices” to Panoil, which constituted due payment.",
        "Did the Umbrella Contracts and/or 2014 Offset Agreement govern the Subject Transactions?": "81 Specifically, WFS claims as follows:57Foot Note 57×Defence (Amendment No.2), para 2.7. (a) the 1st and 2nd Sales Transactions were governed by the 2017 TA; (b) the 3rd Sales Transaction was governed by the 2016 COA; and (c) the 4th to 11th Sales Transactions were governed by the 2017 COA. 82 Despite initially disputing the authenticity of the Umbrella Contracts and the 2014 Offset Agreement,58Foot Note 58×KMMEVAEIC, paras 39 to 41.CIMB eventually accepted (belatedly) in its closing submissions that the documents were authentic.59Foot Note 59×PWS, para 147.On its part, WFS had called Ms Bolan, who testified by video-link, and Mr Lee to give evidence on the existence and authenticity of the documents. 83 The circumstances surrounding WFS’ and Panoil’s entry into the Umbrella Contracts and the 2014 Offset Agreement are not in dispute. However, parties disagree on whether these contracts were intended by WFS and Panoil to govern the Subject Transactions. 84 On 20 August 2014, WFS and Panoil entered into the 2014 Offset Agreement,60Foot Note 60×TCBAEIC, para 10.which provided that “in consideration for entering into contracts for the supply, service, distribution and/or purchase of fuel products and/or marine lubricants by [WFS] with [Panoil] … any sums payable by [Panoil] to [WFS] may be offset against any amount payable that [WFS] has to [Panoil]”. 85 On 30 December 2016, Panoil and WFS entered into the 2016 COA.61Foot Note 61×TCBAEIC, para 12.Similarly, the 2016 COA provided that WFS may “deduct or set off any amounts owed to [it] by Panoil under [the 2016 COA] against any amounts payable by [WFS] to [Panoil] under [2016 COA]”.62Foot Note 62×TCBAEIC, para 12. 86 On 1 January 2017, Panoil and WFS entered into the 2017 TA. The 2017 TA also included a term providing WFS with the right to deduct or set off amounts owed to it by Panoil.63Foot Note 63×TCBAEIC, para 13. 87 Finally, on 11 July 2017, Panoil and WFS entered into another contract of affreightment,ie, the 2017 COA. Clause 1 the 2017 COA provides that WFS shall be entitled to “offset account payables as against its account receivables vis-à-vis Panoil in accordance with the Credit Security Arrangement, and the [2014 Offset Agreement]”, and such provisions as contained….”64Foot Note 64×TCBAEIC, para 15. Analysis 88 I note that none of the key documents behind the Subject Transactions,viz, the 11 Sales Confirmations, the Purchase Confirmations, and the invoices, issued in relation to the Subject Transactions, expressly refers to the Umbrella Contracts or the 2014 Offset Agreement. Presumptively, this suggests that the Umbrella Contracts or the 2014 Offset Agreement were not intended by the parties to cover the Subject Transactions. It is only reasonable to expect some reference to the Umbrella Contracts or the 2014 Offset Agreement in at least some of the documents relating to the Subject Transactions. There was, however, none. 89 WFS submits that the “True Job Orders” (ie, the actual documents that passed from WFS to Panoil) made references to the Umbrella Contracts.65Foot Note 65×DWS, para 101.In this regard, Mr Loh’s affidavit-of-evidence in chief provides as follows: (a) For PS-17/07-0016, the order confirmation used the letters “TC” indicating that the order was made under “time charter” and accordingly governed by the 2017 TA.66Foot Note 66×LCCAEIC, para 40. (b) For PS-B17/07-0025, the order confirmation used the letters “TC”.67Foot Note 67×LCCAEIC, para 50.The 2017 TA was applicable to this order.68Foot Note 68×LCCAEIC, para 51. (c) For PS-B17/07-0028, the order confirmation used the letters “TC”.69Foot Note 69×LCCAEIC, para 56.However, as the Ophelia vessel was not available for use, Panoil used its Jazeel vessel for delivery of the fuel oil, and therefore the 2016 COA governed the sale. (d) For PS-B17/07-0047, PS-B17/07-0083, PS-B17/08-0004, PS-B17/08-0008, and PS-B17/08-0023, the order confirmations used the letters “COA”, indicating that the 2017 COA governed the sale.70Foot Note 70×LCCAEIC, para 64; LCCAEIC, para 70; LCCAEIC, para 82; LCCAEIC, para 88; LCCAEIC, para 101. 90 Taking WFS’ case at its highest, it is clear that none of the order confirmationsexpressly refersto any of the Umbrella Contracts. In my view, the abbreviation “COA” is plainly insufficient to show that the2017 COAgoverned a particular transaction, even if I accept that “COA” refers to a contract of affreightment. WFS also failed to call any witnesses from Panoil to testify that “COA” refers to the 2017 COA. If the parties had intended for a specific sales transaction to be governed by the 2017 COA, I would have expected a reference to the “2017 COA” or something to the effect that “the transaction is governed by the 2017 COA”. As for the reference to “TC”, Mr Tan accepted that this was only a reference to a “time charter”.71Foot Note 71×NE, 31/10/2019, pp 106–107.I do not see how the reference to a “time charter” necessarily means that the Subject Transactions in question were governed by the 2016 COA or the 2017 TA. In any event, given my finding above at [80] that the documents governing the Subject Transactions were the 11 Sales Confirmations, any incorporation or reference to the Umbrella Contracts must be contained in the 11 Sales Confirmations. References to the Umbrella Contracts in other documents not covering the Subject Transactions do not show that one of the Umbrella Contracts governed the specific Subject Transactions, or that its terms have been incorporated into the 11 Sales Confirmations. 91 I now consider each of WFS’ claims at [81] and examine the relevant clauses under the Umbrella Contracts. (1) 1st and 2nd Sales Transactions 92 Clauses 4 and 5 of the 2017 TA provide as follows:72Foot Note 72×3BAEIC, p 1020; TCBAEIC, p 104. 4. From time to time, WFS may elect, at its option, to sell Fuel Oil to Panoil on a barge delivered basis, at a price per MT of the mid-point of the daily AAFER00 Platts Bunkerwire Singapore 380CST Bunker Ex-Wharf Quotation on the 20th day of the month prior to the month of delivery (the “Platts Price”), to be laden and shipped on board the Vessel. In the event that there is no published Platts Price on the 20th day of the month, the quoted price on the next working day will apply. Upon the exercise of the aforegoing option(s) from time to time, WFS shall oneach occasion issue Panoil with asale confirmation in WFS’ standard format applicable from time to time(the “Sale Confirmation”) 5. On each occasion that WFS sells Fuel Oil to Panoil pursuant to this Agreement, above, WFS shall simultaneously purchase a like same amount of Fuel Oil on a barge delivered basis, at a price per MT of Platts Price + Freight Premium. On each occasion that WFS purchases Fuel Oil in accordance with this Agreement, WFS shall issue Panoil with a purchase confirmation in WFS’ standard format applicable from time to time (the “Purchase Confirmation”) … [emphasis added in bold italics] 93 Clause 7 of the 2017 TA further provides that each time WFS exercises its sale and purchase options under the agreement, it shall provide Panoil withwritten noticeof its sale and shipment requirements, as well as two other documents, asale confirmationand apurchase confirmation, within usual office working hours.73Foot Note 73×TCBAEIC, p 105. 94 Construing the above clauses, it is clear that: (a) WFS must first issue asales confirmationwhen it sells fuel oil to Panoil; and (b) WFS must then issue a purchase confirmation to Panoil when it simultaneously purchases thesameamount of fuel oil from Panoil. In the present proceedings, it is common ground that WFS did not produce any such “sales confirmations” as evidence. (2) 3rd Sales Transaction 95 The material terms of the 2016 COA are as follows:74Foot Note 74×TCBAEIC, pp 79–80. 6A1. On each occasion that WFS sends to Panoil a [j]ob [o]rder, it shall simultaneously sell the like same volume of Bunker Fuel entered on the [j]ob order to Panoil on [a barge] delivered basis, ……... On each occasion that a[j]ob [o]rderis submitted such that Bunker Fuel is sold to Panoil, WFS shall issue Panoil with asale confirmationin WFS’ standard format applicable from time to time (the “Sale Confirmation”). 6A2. On each occasion that WFS issues a[j]ob [o]rderand sells Bunker Fuel to Panoil pursuant to this Agreement WFS shall simultaneously purchase a like same amount of Bunker Fuel as is sold pursuant to Clause 6A1 above on a barge delivered basis, at a price per MT of Platts Price + Freight. On each occasion that WFS purchases Bunker Fuel in accordance with this Agreement,WFS shall issue Panoil with a purchaseconfirmationin WFS’ standard format applicable from time to time (the “Purchase Confirmation”.) 6A3. On each occasion that WFS exercises its sale and purchase options and obligations pursuant to this Agreement, it shall promptly provide Panoil with written notice of its sale and shipment requirements and such notificationshall be promptly followed up by the provision by WFS to Panoil of a Sale Confirmation and a Purchase Confirmation within usual office working hours. [emphasis added in bold italics] 96 Reading the above clauses, it is apparent that any transaction under the 2016 COA must involve the following documents: (a) a job order; (b) a sale confirmation; and (c) a purchase confirmation. Both the sale confirmation and purchase confirmation were required to be issued byWFStoPanoil. 97 Clause 2.1 of the 2016 COA provides that the contract shall apply to the supply of barges pursuant to documents calledjob orders.75Foot Note 75×TCBAEIC, p 77.WFS is obliged to issue these job orders to Panoil. WFS, however, failed to adduce any evidence of a job order that it had issued to Panoil in respect of any of the Subject Transactions. In particular, Mr Tan accepted that no job order, sale confirmation, or purchase confirmation had been issued.76Foot Note 76×NE, 31/10/2019, pp 88–90. (3) 4th to 11th Sales Transactions 98 The material terms of the 2017 COA are as follows:77Foot Note 77×TCBAEIC, p 159. 7.6 On each occasion that [WFS] sends to Panoil a [j]ob [o]rder, it shall simultaneously sell the like same volume of Bunker Fuel entered on the[j]ob [o]rderto Panoil on a barge delivered basis … On each occasion that a[j]ob [o]rderis submitted such that Bunker Fuel is sold to Panoil, [WFS]shall issue Panoil with asale confirmation, incorporating the GTC which Panoil accepts to apply to each such sale, in [WFS’] standard format applicable from to time to time (the “Sale Confirmation”.) 7.7 On each occasion that [WFS] issues a[j]ob [o]rderand sells Bunker Fuel to Panoil pursuant to this Contract, [WFS] shall simultaneously purchase a like same amount of Bunker Fuel as is sold pursuant to Clause 7.6, above on a barge delivered basis, at a price per MT of Platts Price + Freight. On each occasion that [WFS] purchases Bunker Fuel in accordance with this Contract, [WFS] shall issue Panoil with a purchase confirmation in [WFS’] standard format applicable from time to time … (the “PurchaseConfirmation”.) [emphasis added in italics] 99 Similarly, as under the 2016 COA, cll 7.6 and 7.7 of the 2017 COA contemplate the following two steps: (a) First, when a job order is submitted (ie, at the time the fuel oil is sold to Panoil), WFS issues Panoil a sales confirmation; (b) Second, when WFS simultaneously purchases the same amount of fuel oil from Panoil, WFS issues Panoil a purchase confirmation in its standard format. 100 A transaction under 2017 COA would also involve the following documents: (a) a job order; (b) a sale confirmation; and (c) a purchase confirmation. 101 WFS did not disclose any of the above documents in the present proceedings. 102 Clauses 3.1, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of the 2017 COA provide as follows: 3.1 This Contract shall apply to the supply of the Barge(s) and the performance of all barging and other related services by Panoil for [WFS] pursuant to all[j]ob [o]rders. 4.1 [WFS] shall issue to Panoil a [j]ob [o]rder for each Job Delivery which [WFS] requires Panoil to perform. 4.2 Panoil shall comply in all respects with each [j]ob [o]rder and shall execute each [j]ob [o]rder expeditiously and in any case, within the timeline specified by [WFS] for the [j]ob [o]rder. Time of delivery shall be of the essence of this Contract and each [j]ob [o]rder. 4.3 Panoil undertakes to [WFS] not to perform any Job Delivery unless and until a [j]ob [o]rder has been issued to it by [WFS] and [WFS] may refuse payment in respect of any Job Delivery performed by Panoil which is not supported by a [j]ob [o]rder. [emphasis added in italics] 103 These clauses show that the job order is an important document facilitating any transaction between WFS and Panoil. In this regard, Mr Tan accepted that Panoil and WFS would need to comply with cll 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 of the 2017 COA in order for the 2017 COA to apply to the specific transaction in question.78Foot Note 78×NE, 31/10/2019, p 79. Findings on the Umbrella Contracts 104 In my judgment, WFS’ claim that one of the Umbrella Contracts governed each of the Subject Transactions is without merit. This is for the following reasons. 105 First, the transactions envisioned under the Umbrella Contracts do not correspond with the Subject Transactionsactually carriedout by the parties: (a) Under the 2017 TA, WFS was obliged to provide Panoil with a sale confirmation and a purchase confirmation. However, there is no evidence that such documents were ever issued in relation to the 1st and 2nd Sales Transactions. (b) Similarly, transactions under the 2016 COA involved job orders, sales confirmations, and purchase confirmations, which were to be issued by WFS to Panoil. Again, there is no evidence that these documents were ever issued to Panoil in respect of the 3rd Sales Transaction. (c) Likewise, transactions under the 2017 COA involved job orders, sales confirmations, and purchase confirmations. There is no evidence that these documents were issued by WFS to Panoil in respect of the 4th to 11th Sales Transactions. 106 In contrast, in the case of the Subject Transactions,WFSwould issuePanoilanorder confirmation. Then,Panoilwould issueWFSasales confirmation(see above at [74]). In other words, theonly documentswhichWFSissued toPanoilfor the Subject Transactions wereorder confirmations. Under the Umbrella Contracts, WFS was to issue sales confirmations and purchase confirmations. Further, save for the 2017 TA, the remaining Umbrella Contracts contemplated the issuance of  job orders. WFS, however, failed to produceany of these documentscontemplated under the Umbrella Contracts in these proceedings. The lack of evidence makes clear that no such documents were ever issued and no transactions were carried out pursuant to the Umbrella Contracts. 107 Second, there is no objective evidence that any of the transactions contemplated under the Umbrella Contracts had ever been carried out. The substance of the Umbrella Contracts was that WFS would sell the same quantity of fuel oil back to Panoil in a composite “buy-sell” transaction. There is no evidence that such transactions had ever taken place. Put a different way, there is no objective evidence that WFS had concurrently sold to Panoil the same quantity of fuel which it had bought from Panoil under the Subject Transactions. I do not accept Mr Tan’s assertions on affidavit, unsupported by objective documentary evidence, that there had been such buy-sell transactions with Panoil. In particular, I find it unbelievable that it was “generally not possible to track each Panoil purchase of … fuel oil from WFS to [a] particular sale from Panoil to WFS”. According to Mr Tan, on a monthly basis, WFS ensured that the volume of fuel oil soldto and purchasedfrom Panoil tallied. In this respect, WFS entered into various contracts for the supply of fuel oil to end-user vessels or vessel owners. WFS performed such contracts by purchasing fuel oil from its suppliers, including Panoil. Panoil would then purchase the fuel oil from WFS for delivery to WFS’ customers,ie, the end-user vessels or vessel owners.79Foot Note 79×TCBAEIC, para 19.Under this arrangement, WFS would be required to monitor its net position with Panoil under internal documents called “monthly reconciliations”.80Foot Note 80×TCBAEIC, para 21.WFS closely monitored these statements such that the volume of fuel oil bought and sold by WFS to Panoil tallied at the end of the month.81Foot Note 81×TCBAEIC, para 22.To show that there had been such “monthly reconciliations”, WFS produced records of its “reconciliation statements”.82Foot Note 82×TCBAEIC; Exhibit TCB-10 and TCB 11.In my view, these monthly “reconciliation statements” do not prove that there had been composite “buy-sell” transactions in respect of the Subject Transactions. At bottom, these “reconciliation statements” are internal financial documents prepared by WFS. They do not evidence that there had been “buy-sell” transactions under the Umbrella Contracts. WFS could have called witnesses from Panoil or, alternatively, produced the relevant documents contemplated under these contracts,viz, purchase confirmations or sales confirmations or job orders, which it had issued to Panoil. If such transactions had been carried out, it is probable that WFS would retain copies of these documents. As I mentioned above at [105], WFS did not produce these documents in these proceedings. In the circumstances, I find that there were no composite “buy-sell” transactions in respect of the Subject Transactions. It follows that the Subject Transactions are not governed by the Umbrella Contracts. 108 Third, I find that WFS and Panoil did not act in a manner consistent with the payment terms required under the Umbrella Contracts. Under the Umbrella Contracts, each party was required to pay the other within 15 days of the presentation of the sales invoice (foreg, cl 7.3 of the 2016 COA, cl 10 of the 2017 TA and cl 8.4 of the 2017 COA). However, it is undisputed that WFS’ purchase confirmations in respect of the Subject Transactions all provided for payment to be made within 30 days. 109 Fourth, the terms of the Umbrella Contracts themselves show that the Subject Transactions were not governed by the Umbrella Contracts because they do not mention the dates, prices, payment mode, or indeed any other details. 110 Finally, even though CIMB was, at the time, a third party to the Subject Transactions between WFS and Panoil, I find this immaterial to the issue of which documents governed the 11 Sales Transactions. It is a well-established principle that contracts are appraised objectively. Applying this objective analysis, it is plain from the terms of the Umbrella Contracts that the Subject Transactions were not covered by these same documents. 111 Given the above, I find that the Subject Transactions were not governed by the Umbrella Contracts.",
        "Did the 2014 Offset Agreement govern the Subject Transactions?": "112 WFS submits that the 2014 Offset Agreement includes all transactions between WFS and Panoil.83Foot Note 83×DWS, para 107.This is because the 2014 Offset Agreement refers to the right to set off “any sums payable by any entity of Panoil to any entity of [WFS]” against “any amount payable that any entity of [WFS] has to any entity of Panoil”. It is not necessary for me to make a finding on whether the 2014 Offset Agreement governed the Subject Transactions, given my finding below that any rights of set-off arising from it would be superseded in any event by the rights under the Sales Documents (see below at [125]–[130]).",
        "Is WFS entitled to a right of set-off?": "",
        "Clause 8.2 of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions": "Parties’ arguments 113 CIMB submits that each of the 11 Panoil Sales Confirmations incorporates cl 8.2 of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions. In this regard, CIMB argues that “reasonable notice” of the term has been given, and that no set-off clauses are common in the bunkering industry.84Foot Note 84×PWS, para 108. 114 WFS disputes that the 11 Panoil Sales Confirmations incorporate cl 8.2 on several grounds: (a) Panoil’s Terms and Conditions are not proven;85Foot Note 85×DWS, p 54.(b) CIMB did not at any time believe that these terms governed the Subject Transactions;86Foot Note 86×DWS, para 163.and (c) there is insufficient notice of the incorporation of cl 8.2 of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions.87Foot Note 87×DWS, paras 171.In this regard, it contends that there must be some reference to where the applicable terms and conditions can be found.88Foot Note 88×DWS, para 175.Furthermore, as cl 8.2 provides that the applicable standard terms and conditions of Panoil may be updated from time to time, the specific version applicable (at any given time) is unknown. Hence, there is insufficient notice.89Foot Note 89×DWS, para 177. Analysis 115 Clause 8.2 of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions provided as follows: Payment for each delivery of marine fuel shall be in United States Dollars or Singapore Dollars as specified in the invoice and such payment shall be made by the Buyer free and clear of any deduction, set-off, counter claims, whatsoever on cash in advance or by telegraphic transfer to Seller’s bank after each delivery is completed as directed by Seller on the date shown on the invoice. 116 Both parties accept that reasonable notice must be provided in order to incorporate a set-off clause. 117 The relevant legal principles are uncontroversial. 118 InWartsila Singapore Pte Ltd v Lau Yew Choong and another suit[2017] 5 SLR 718 (“Wartsila Singapore”), Belinda Ang Saw Ean J explained that one of the methods of incorporating terms is by reasonable notice (at [122]). InThe Law of Contract in Singapore(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012), the learned authors explained at  para 07.022 that incorporation by reasonable notice is “by its very nature, heavily dependent on the particular facts of the case concerned” and that actual notice is not required for incorporation. 119 InCircle Freight International Ltd (T/A Mogul Air) v Medeast Gulf Experts Ltd (T/A Gulf Export)[1988] 2 Lloyd’s Law Reports 427 (“Circle Freight”), the plaintiff successfully incorporated anexclusion clausefound in the standard conditions of the Institute of Freight Forwarders. The clause provided that “all business is transacted by the company under the current trading conditions of the Institute of Freight Forwarders a copy of which is available on request”. The English Court of Appeal held (at 433) that the clause was validly incorporated: [I]t is not necessary to the incorporation of trading terms into a contract that they should be specifically set out provided that they are conditions in common form or usual terms in the relevant business. It is sufficient if adequate notice is given identifying and relying upon the conditions and they are available on request. Other considerations apply if the conditions or any of them are particularly onerous or unusual. 120 In my judgment, CIMB had provided reasonable notice of cl 8.2 of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions under the 11 Sales Confirmations. 121 First, I accept Mr Neo’s evidence that clauses such as cl 8.2 of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions are common or usual terms in the bunkering industry. WFS does not deny this. Mr Loh himself conceded that the general terms and conditions, which he had seen, contained such clauses excluding the right of set-off.90Foot Note 90×NE, 31/10/2019, 63:8–63:20.After all, even WFS’ own general terms and conditions included a clause excluding the right of set-off.91Foot Note 91×NE, 31/10/2019, 63:21–64:15.Given the common and usual nature of cl 8.2, it stands to reason that the requirement of “reasonable notice” is more easily satisfied. 122 Second, in determining what constitutes “reasonable notice”, I have regard to the fact that WFS is a sophisticated commercial party with a history of business dealings with Panoil. 123 Third, upon examination of the clause that seeks to incorporate cl 8.2, I find that reasonable notice was provided. Each of the 11 Sales Confirmations is a brief document, and did not spell out the terms of the contract of sale at length. Instead, as appears common with the bunkering practice, under the heading “terms” (as in terms of the contract), it provided that “sales [sic] is subjected to thestandard terms and conditions of Panoilwhich is updated from time to time” [emphasis added]. Evidently, this case should be distinguished from cases where the incorporating clause is printed in small and illegible print. The incorporating clause in each of the 11 Sales Confirmations is prominent and easily seen. Another point to note is that, other than the clause stipulating that the sale is subject to Panoil’s Terms and Conditions, there are only a few contractual terms listed under the heading “[a]dditional terms”. To any reasonable commercial party, it is obvious that all of the main contractual terms will be found in Panoil’s Terms and Conditions, given the bare bones nature of each sales confirmation. 124 Finally, it is clear that WFS hadactual noticeof Panoil’s Terms and Conditions as the evidence shows that WFS possessed a copy of the same. In his affidavit of evidence in chief, Mr Loh conceded that WFS had a copy of one version of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions that WFS disclosed in its List of Documents.92Foot Note 92×LCCAEIC, para 122.I also note that WFS does not deny that it had received this version of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions from Panoil, but simply claims that it does not accept this version of the terms as being in force at the material time.93Foot Note 93×LCCAEIC, para 122.While it is clear that there were different versions of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions (the copy which CIMB possessed differed from WFS’ copy), both versions presented to the court contained cl 8.2. It is also not WFS’ case that the version of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions at the material time did not contain cl 8.2. Given WFS’ possession of the version of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions, I find that WFS likely obtained a copy of the document from Panoil. Even if WFS did not have actual notice of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions, it is, in any event, apparent that it had reasonable notice of those terms. Furthermore, even though the incorporating clause does not provide that Panoil’s Terms and Conditions were available on request, I do not think it was necessary for parties to include such a term given their commercial sophistication and history of business with each other.",
        "Cl 8.2 supersedes any set-off right arising under each of the Umbrella Contracts and the 2014 Offset Agreement": "125 I have found that the Subject Transactions were governed by the 11 Sales Confirmations at [80]. The 11 Sales Confirmations incorporate cl 8.2, which does not allow any right of set-off. This extends to any rights of set-off which may arise under the Umbrella Contracts and/or the 2014 Offset Agreement. 126 Hence, evenifat least one of the Umbrella Contracts or 2014 Offset Agreement covered each of thetransactionsbetween WFS and Panoil, the no set-off right under cl 8.2 supersedes any rights of set-off under these contracts. 127In Sintalow Hardware Pte Ltd v OSK Engineering Pte Ltd[2017] 2 SLR 372 (“Sintalow”), the parties signed a letter containing general terms and conditions for the purchase of sanitary ware (“the Master Contract”). The respondent later accepted three separate product quotations for the sanitary ware (“the Products Agreements”). The Court of Appeal held that the Master Contract merely prescribed general terms and conditions for the supply of the sanitary ware, but did not require the respondent to buy or the appellant to sell them. Instead, the sale and purchase of the products were governed by the separate Products Agreements. 128 The court explained the applicable approach where there is inconsistency between terms in different contractual documents: (a) A well-drafted contract normally provides a hierarchy of precedence to deal with inconsistencies between contractual terms or clauses, or general terms and specific terms (Sintalowat [53]). (b) However, if the contract does not expressly provide an order of precedence between the different documents or specify that a certain class of documents should prevail over others, “the more specific document ought to prevail over a standard form document” [emphasis in original] (Sintalowat [53]). (c) Where there is no order of precedence clause stipulating the hierarchy between contractual documents, the terms of the sales contract, which contained the specifically agreed clause, take precedence over a clause incorporated by reference to the general terms and conditions (seeIndian Oil Corporation v Vanol Inc[1991] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 634) (Sintalowat [54]). (d) The court should try to reconcile the terms to preserve the general terms. Only where there is a clear and irreconcilable discrepancy is it necessary to resort to the contractual order of precedence to resolve the inconsistency. Even where there is no order of precedence clause, the principle is that the general terms and conditions are superseded or varied by inconsistent specific terms and conditions to the extent of their inconsistency (Sintalowat [55]–[57]). 129 In this case, there is a clear inconsistency between the terms in the Umbrella Contracts and the 2014 Offset Agreement, and the 11 Sales Confirmations. The former contracts provide for rights of set-off, while the latter contracts expressly exclude any rights of set-off. 130 Similar to the Products Agreements inSintalow, the 11 Sales Confirmations were thespecific contractual documentswhich governed each of the Subject Transactions. The 11 Sales Confirmations set out specific terms such as the price, mode of payment, date of delivery,etc, which are not contained in the Umbrella Contracts and the 2014 Offset Agreement. Likewise, the Umbrella Contracts and the 2014 Offset Agreement, assuming that they governed the Subject Transactions, are akin to the Master Contract inSintalow, these being documents lacking any of the specific details of each sales transaction. As there is a clear and irreconcilable inconsistency between the terms in these two sets of agreements, it is necessary to apply the principle that the terms in the more specific contract should prevail over the terms in the less specific contract. Hence, cl 8.2, which had been incorporated under the 11 Sales Confirmations, supersedes any rights of set-off under the Umbrella Contracts and the 2014 Offset Agreement (even if they were applicable to the Subject Transactions).",
        "Relevance of the offset notices": "131 Given that WFS has no rights of set-off pursuant to the Umbrella Contracts and/or 2014 Offset Agreement, any offset notices issued by WFS have no legal effect. 132 At trial, the evidence showed that WFS only began issuing these offset noticesafterit became clear that Panoil was in financial trouble. There was no indication that WFS had been issuing such offset notices at or around the time of the Subject Transactions. 133 On or around 25 May 2017, Panoil stopped paying WFS’ debts in cash.94Foot Note 94×LLCAEIC, para 16.WFS became concerned.95Foot Note 95×LLCAEIC, para 16.At this stage, WFS issued itsveryfirstoffset notice to Panoil. WFS proceeded to issue a further 10 offset notices to Panoil.96Foot Note 96×TCBAEIC, para 29.In this regard, Mr Loh expresslyacknowledgedthat WFSdid not useto offset payments to Panoil. Instead, each party would pay the other in full.97Foot Note 97×NE, 1/11/2019, 26:21–27:12.Likewise, Mr Tan confirmed that WFS never used set-offs until June 2017.98Foot Note 98×NE, 31/10/2019, 117:7–117:20.Mr Loh and Mr Tan’s evidence shows that Panoil and WFS never acted in accordance with the Umbrella Contracts or the 2014 Offset Agreement. The failure to issue offset notices at the time of the Subject Transaction also supports my finding at [111] that the Umbrella Contracts were never intended to govern the Subject Transactions.",
        "Is an equitable right of set-off available to WFS?": "134 WFS claims that it is entitled to equitable set-off. In support, it submits that there is a close relationship or connection between certain dealings between WFS and Panoil and the Subject Transactions.99Foot Note 99×DWS, para 226.WFS points to its longstanding buy-sell relationship with Panoil since 2014, and its issuance of a large volume of invoices to Panoil. 135 I have already found at [107] that there is insufficient evidence of contemporaneous buy-sell transactions between Panoil and WFS in connection with the Subject Transactions. These are the same transactions which WFS relies on in support of its claim for equitable set-off. Accordingly, there is insufficient evidence of any closely connected dealings between Panoil and WFS. 136 Nonetheless, I proceed to consider whether WFS can exercise equitable rights of set-off, assuming that these transactions exist. 137 The relevant law is clear. The right of equitable set-off applies where there is a close relationship or connection between the dealings and the transactions which give rise to the respective claims, such that it would offend one’s sense of fairness or justice to allow one claim to be enforced without regard to the other (BP Singapore Pte Ltdv Jurong Aromatics Corp Pte Ltd (receivers and managers appointed) and others and another matter[2020] 1 SLR 627 at [49], citing Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) inAbdul Salam Asanaru Pillai (trading as South Kerala Cashew Exporters) v Nomanbhoy & Sons Pte Ltd[2007] 2 SLR(R) 856 at [26]). InPacific Rim Investments Pte Ltd v Lam Seng Tiong[1995] 2 SLR(R) 643 (“Pacific Rim”), the Court of Appeal held at [35] that the exercise of an equitable set-off is permitted only ifequitable considerationssupport such an exercise and cited Lord Denning MR in the English Court of Appeal decision inFederal Commerce & Navigation Co Ltd v Molena Alpha Inc[1978] QB 927 (“The Nanfri”) at 974–975: [I]t is not every cross-claim which can be deducted. It is only cross-claims that arise out of the same transaction or are closely connected with it. And it is only cross-claims which go directly to impeach the plaintiff’s demands, that is, so closely connected with his demands that it would be manifestly unjust to allow him to enforce payment without taking into account the cross-claim. 138 The right to equitable set-off may be expressly excluded by contract (Pacific Rimat [36]). 139 Recently, the Court of Appeal inKoh Lin Yee v Terrestrial Pte Ltd and another appeal[2015] 2 SLR 497 (“Koh Lin Yee”) held that parties can agree to contract out of anequitableright of set-off. InKoh Lin Yee, the relevant clause was as follows (at [6]): All payments to be made by [Allgo or Koh] under the [Loan Agreement] shall be made without set-off, counterclaim or condition… [emphasis in original removed] 140 Interpreting the above clause, the court held that the right of equitable set-off was excluded (at [15]–[17]): 15. …In accordance with the principle of the freedom of contract, it must be understood that parties can agree to contract out of the right of set-off and, if they intend to do so, clear words must be used. The defence of an equitable set-off can thus, equally, be contractually excluded.… 16. As explained in [Rory Derham,Derham on the Law of Set-Off(Oxford University Press, 2010)] (at para 5.95), the general common law principle is one based on commercial logic and common sense as well as on giving effect to the agreement that the parties have signed; in the words of the learned author: It may be important for cash flow reasons that a party should receive payment in full under a contract so that, if the other party has a cross-claim which otherwise would give rise to an equitable set-off or a common law defence of abatement, that other party should not be entitled to rely upon it as a justification for tendering a reduced amount, but should be required to seek his or her remedy in separate proceedings. … 17. Looking at the words of cl 12.2, we did not see how they could be interpreted to refer only to legal set-offs and not equitable ones. In our view, cl 12.2 excludedallforms of set-off, with no distinction between the two. Mr Asokan argued that for an equitable set-off to be expressly excluded by the contract, the clause concerned had to state “without equitable set off”. If this particular argument were correct, by parity of reasoning it would mean that for a legal set-off to be excluded, the clause would have to state “withoutlegalset off” – an argument which we note Mr Asokan had not attempted to make. On the contrary, Mr Asokan’s argument was, instead, based on the assumption that the words “without set-off” in cl 12.2 meant “without legal set-off”.In our view, this was a pedantic as well as artificial argument that was wholly without merit, not least because it completely ignored the crystal clear language (“without set-off”) utilised by the parties which evinced their equally crystal clear intention, as seen in the entire context of the agreement itself, to exclude all manner of set-offs, both legal and equitable.Indeed, Mr Asokan wasaddingto the words “without set-off” in cl 12.2 the word “legal” when the words “without set-off” were perfectly clear in stating what the parties had intended. [emphasis added in bold italics] 141 For convenience, I reproduce cl 8.2 of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions: Payment for each delivery of marine fuel shall be in United States Dollars or Singapore Dollars as specified in the invoice and such payment shall be made by the Buyer free and clear of any deduction, set-off, counter claims, whatsoever on cash in advance or by telegraphic transfer to Seller’s bank after each delivery is completed as directed by Seller on the date shown on the invoice. 142 Like the relevant clause inKoh Lin Yee, cl 8.2 expressly provides that payment for each delivery of marine fuel shall be made “free of any deduction, set-off, or counterclaim”. The language in cl 8.2 is sufficiently clear to show the parties’ intention to excludebothlegal and equitable rights of set-off. Hence, WFS is precluded from relying on an equitable right of set-off.",
        "Is CIMB required to prove loss?": "143 WFS submits that CIMB’s action must fail because CIMB has not shown that it has suffered loss.100Foot Note 100×DWS, para 230.In this respect, WFS contends as follows: (a) CIMB has filed a proof of debt in the liquidation proceedings involving Panoil totalling US$4,234,596.00. CIMB, however, claims against Italmatic (the identity of which is not relevant) and WFS for a total of US$7,524,864.69 (excluding interest), which exceeds the amount filed in the proof of debt against Panoil.101Foot Note 101×DWS, para 234. (b) CIMB fails to explain why it claims for its “losses” in the present proceedings whilst not claiming, under the proof of debt, that the 11 Panoil Invoices are unpaid.102Foot Note 102×DWS, para 235. (c) There is no direct evidence that CIMB has suffered any loss.103Foot Note 103×DWS, para 238. 144 CIMB denies that proof of loss is relevant to the present proceedings.104Foot Note 104×PWS, p 32. 145 In my judgment, WFS’ submission cannot succeed. There is no need for CIMB to establish that it has suffered “loss”, so long as it is entitled to exercise the assigned rights under the Debenture without any corresponding right of set-off by WFS. As I have found above at [113]–[142], WFS has no rights of set-off under the Umbrella Contracts and, in any case, any rights of set-off under the Umbrella Contracts (or the 2014 Offset Agreement) are superseded by cl 8.2 of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions, which is incorporated in each of the 11 Panoil Sales Confirmations. In any event, cl 10.4(d) of the Debenture expressly provides that CIMB may recover in excess of what Panoil has borrowed from it, except that such surplus “shall be paid to [Panoil] or any other person entitled thereto”.",
        "Conclusion": "146 As CIMB did not prove the authenticity of the Debenture, I dismissed its claims. 147 I will hear parties on costs.
