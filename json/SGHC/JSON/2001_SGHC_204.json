        "Gift/windfall.": "20. Immediately after the vessel had been loaded, the relevant documents were forwarded through\n\nbanking channels for acceptance by Ravate. Mrs Abeda Patel (\"Mrs Patel\"), a director of\n\nRavate and a witness called by Sitra Wood, could not recall if Ravate accepted the documents before\n\nor after the vessel sank but the banking documentation produced showed that by 21 July 1999 the\n\ndocuments under the two LCs maturing on 27 September 1999 had been accepted by Ravate and by 29 July\n\n1999 the three bills of exchange maturing on the same date had been accepted. It was not in dispute\n\nthat thereafter Ravate asked for and Sitra Wood agreed to extend the maturity dates and, as noted\n\nearlier, full payments under the invoices were made by 29 November 1999.21. Under cl 9 of the contract (quoted in paragraph 1 above), Ravate was contractually obliged to\n\npay for the cargo whether or not the cargo arrived at the Reunion Islands. The fact that Ravate paid\n\nfor the cargo inspite of the vessel having sunk was consistent with this contractual obligation.\n\nUnder cl 5 of the contract, the risk of shipment was on Ravate. Also, this was an FOB transaction\n\nand under cl 5 Ravate was required to insure the cargo to safeguard itself against cargo risk. This\n\nRavate did and, upon learning of the loss of the cargo, Ravate claimed for and obtained\n\nreimbursement from the insurers for the loss suffered. The conduct of Ravate in insuring the cargo\n\nand settling the amounts due under the invoices was in accordance with the terms agreed between the\n\nparties.22. In the above scenario, for Sitra Wood to now claim that Ravate made the payments merely out\n\nof goodwill is, in my view, a highly implausible claim. To highlight just one aspect, if Ravate was\n\nmaking the payments purely out of goodwill, there would be no need to obtain Sitra Wood's consent\n\nfor the extensions in respect of the maturity dates. It may be that, if the documents had not been\n\naccepted before the loss of the cargo, Ravate could have tried, using the loss as the reason, to\n\ndelay or avoid its contractual obligations. To that extent, the fact that Ravate did not resort to\n\nsuch conduct could be said to be an expression of goodwill but that sort of \"goodwill\"\n\ncannot detract from the fact that, the documents being in order, Ravate, under its contract with\n\nSitra Wood, was obliged to accept the same. Notwithstanding Mrs Patel's evidence that Ravate would\n\nhave to inspect the cargo before accepting it, these transactions were - as cll 9 and 11 amply\n\nindicate - transactions where the parties dealt only in documents.23. In any event, if indeed Ravate made the payments merely out of goodwill, the payments could\n\nnot be categorised as \"losses\" to Ravate vis--vis its insurers. Ravate cannot have it\n\nboth ways. If it was a gift, Ravate would have no claim against its insurers. If these were\n\ngratuitous payments, Ravate could not and should not have handed the endorsed bills of lading to its\n\ninsurers or subrogated its rights against the carrier to the insurance company. If, because of the\n\nloss of cargo, Ravate wished to cancel the contract, it should have so informed Sitra Wood and\n\ndeclined to accept the bills of lading and other documents. Sitra Wood could then have claimed\n\nindemnity from Royal & Sun and subrogated its rights against Ravate and/or the carrier to Royal\n\n& Sun. Under the contracts, the risk of shipment was on Ravate. It seems to me that, the cargo\n\nhaving perished during shipment, Ravate decided to honour its contract with Sitra Wood by paying for\n\nthe cargo on the credit terms agreed and then obtain reimbursement from its insurers.24. One of the arguments advanced by Mr Asokan in support of his submission that the payments by\n\nRavate were gratuitous was the fact that cl 10 of the contract provided that the property in the\n\ngoods would pass to the beneficiary only after receipt of full payment. In support of this\n\nsubmission, Mr Asokan, cited the headnotes in the case of Mitsui & Co Ltd & Anor v Flota\n\nMercante Grancolombiana SA, The Ciudad de Pasto, The Ciudad de Neiva [1989] 1 All ER 951. The\n\nheadnotes read:\"Arising out of the presumption in s 19 of the 1979 Act that where by the bills of lading\n\n  shipped goods were deliverable to the order of the seller the seller reserved the right of\n\n  disposal and the property in the goods did not pass to the buyer until the conditions imposed by\n\n  the seller had been fulfilled, it was to be presumed that where only part of the purchase price\n\n  had been paid the condition imposed by the seller for the passing of the property in the goods was\n\n  payment of the balance of the purchase price, since in the ordinary way a seller would not wish to\n\n  part with the property in his goods if they were shipped overseas until he had been paid in full.\n\n  On the facts, that presumption had not been displaced since the sellers took the bills of lading\n\n  to their own order and consequently retained the property in the goods until the balance of the\n\n  purchase price had been paid. Since the second plaintiffs had been unable to show that their claim\n\n  failed. The appeal would therefore be allowed.\"Mr Asokan pointed out that just as in Ciudad de Pasto, in the present case too the bills of\n\nlading were \"to order\" and at the time of the loss of cargo payment had not been made.25. The facts in Ciudad de Pasto briefly were that the sellers had sold a consignment of prawns\n\nto the buyer and had received 80% of the purchase price before shipment. There was no evidence\n\nbefore the court as to the actual terms of sale and no evidence as to when the balance 20% was to be\n\npaid or whether it was paid. The court had to determine whether the property in the cargo had passed\n\nto the buyer upon shipment, thereby entitling the buyer to sue the carrier in tort. The court found\n\nthat property had not passed to the buyer. In arriving at that conclusion, Staughton LJ said at page\n\n957:\"It seems to me that in the ordinary way a seller will not wish to part with the property\n\n  in his goods if they are shipped overseas until he has been paid in full.\"But, as Mr Govintharasah pointed out in his submissions, Staughton LJ having said that went on to\n\nquote, with approval, the following paragraph in Benjamin's on Sale of Goods:\"There is support for that view again in Benjamin para 1484:'In overseas sales, there is, therefore, a fairly strong presumption that the seller does not\n\n  intend to part with property until he has either been paid or been given an adequate assurance of\n\n  payment. Of course the presumption may be rebutted: for example, by the fact that buyer and seller\n\n  are associated companies (so that the seller does not need security for payment) or by the fact\n\n  that the contract expressly provides for credit'.\"(Emphasis added.)It is clear from the above quotation that the presumption that a seller does not intend to part\n\nwith property can be rebutted if credit terms are extended to the buyer. In the absence of evidence\n\nbefore the court in that case as to the actual terms of the sale, the court was not prepared to\n\ninfer that the prawns had been sold on credit and found that property had not passed. That, however,\n\nis not the position in our present case. The sale to Ravate by Sitra Wood was a credit sale.26. It is the intention of the parties as manifested in their contract terms and in their\n\ndealings that determine when property in goods passes. As Sitra Wood had extended credit to Ravate,\n\nproperty in the goods would pass when Ravate agreed to the terms of that credit. In this case,\n\nRavate was in physical possession of the property from the date of shipment and property in the\n\ngoods passed when Ravate in exchange for the shipping documents (in particular the endorsed bills of\n\nlading) accepted the credit terms.27. In support of its claim that Ravate made the payment out of goodwill, Chew Hua Mong\n\n(\"Chew\"), the Managing Director of Sitra Wood, procured from Ravate the following letter\n\ndated 24 February 2000:\"We refer to the above invoices and the 5 consignments of plywood and timber you agreed to\n\n  supply to us under various sales contracts which were lost at sea in July 1999 after shipment.This is to confirm that as a gesture of goodwill and for our continuing business relationship,\n\n  we have made payments to you in respect of the above captioned invoices according to the invoices\n\n  price for the said consignments.\"I use the word \"procured\" because it seems to me, on the evidence I have heard, that\n\nthe idea that the payments were not contractual but purely out of goodwill was an idea born in\n\nhindsight. Sitra Wood had, upon receiving the payments from Ravate, abandoned its claim in respect\n\nof those payments. Even after Rodyk & Davidson came into the picture, that continued to be the\n\nposition of Sitra Wood. In abandoning its original claim, Sitra Wood was necessarily taking the\n\nposition that the payments received from Ravate were in satisfaction of the invoices. Indeed, that\n\nis what Sitra Wood (and Rodyk & Davidson) told Webster at that time. US$584,366.50 is not a\n\nsmall sum of money. If indeed Ravate made that payment as a gift, one would expect that the first\n\nthing that Sitra Wood would do is to tell its solicitors about their good fortune in having a buyer,\n\nwho, out of sheer generosity and goodwill had paid in full for the lost cargo. If Rodyk &\n\nDavidson had been informed of this, the correspondence between Rodyk & Davidson and Royal &\n\nSun would have reflected this fact.28. It seems to me that the truth of the matter was that the payments made by Ravate were not\n\npayments made out of sheer goodwill. Ravate paid because Ravate, having accepted the credit and\n\nhaving undertaken the cargo risk, felt obliged to pay. Chew, however, came to know from his\n\ndiscussions with Rodyk & Davidson that if the payments had been by way of a gift or goodwill,\n\nthen Sitra Wood would, in addition to the payments received from Ravate, be able to claim the full\n\ninsured value. Sensing an opportunity of making some money, Chew then spoke to Ravate and managed to\n\nobtain from Ravate the letter quoted above. Thereafter Chew gave instructions to Rodyk &\n\nDavidson based on Ravate's letter of 24 February 2000. I accept the submission of Mr Govintharasah\n\nthat Sitra Wood's defence that the payments by Ravate were out of sheer goodwill was a defence\n\nconcocted by Sitra Wood to bolster its claim.29. In arriving at this conclusion, I am aware that Mrs Patel claimed authorship of the letter of\n\n24 February 2000. That may well be so but that does not detract from the fact that she did so\n\nbecause Chew asked for such a letter. It is pertinent that the letter does not, in so many words,\n\nsay that Ravate made the payments inspite of knowing that it was under no legal obligation to do so.\n\nIt is also pertinent to note that Mrs Patel, in cross-examination, admitted that Ravate was\n\ncontractually bound to pay for the cargo under the irrevocable LCs.30. An insurance contract is a contract of indemnity. The underlying principle of such contracts,\n\nas clearly established in Castellain v Preston & Ors (1883) 11 QBD 380 is that the insurer is\n\nliable to the insured to the extent of the insured's loss and that the insured should not profit\n\nfrom his own loss.31. In Castellain, a vendor contracted with a purchaser for the sale at a specified price of a\n\nhouse which had been insured by the vendor against fire. Before the date of completion, the house\n\nwas damaged by fire and the vendor received the insurance money from the insurer. The purchase was\n\nafterwards completed, and the contracted price was paid to the vendor without any deduction on\n\naccount of the damage caused by the fire. The (English) Court of Appeal held that the insurer was\n\nentitled to recover from the vendor the insurance monies received. To quote from the judgment of\n\nBrett LJ at 386:\"The very foundation, in my opinion, of every rule which has been applied to insurance law\n\n  is this, namely, that the contract of insurance contained in a marine or fire policy is a contract\n\n  of indemnity, and of indemnity only, and that this contract means that the assured, in case of a\n\n  loss against which the policy has been made, shall be fully indemnified, but shall never be more\n\n  than fully indemnified. That is the fundamental principle of insurance, and if ever a proposition\n\n  is brought forward which is at variance with it, that is to say, which either will prevent the\n\n  assured from obtaining a full indemnity, or which will give to the assured more than a full\n\n  indemnity, that proposition must certainly be wrong.\"(Emphasis added.)In Castellain, the purchaser need not have paid the contracted price. He could have sought an\n\nabatement in the price by reason of the fire and paid only the abated price. It seems to me that the\n\npayment, in that case, of the contracted price (to the extent of the difference between that price\n\nand the abated price) was much more in the nature of a gift than the payment in this case.32. The principal authority relied on by Sitra Wood, in court, as well as in the very first\n\nletter written by Rodyk & Davidson claiming the full insured sum, was the decision of the Court\n\nof Appeal in Malayan Motor and General Underwriters (Pte) Ltd v Abdul Karim & Anor[1982] 1 MLJ 51. Mr Asokan emphasised, on several occasions in the course of his submissions, that the decision\n\nin the Malayan Motor case, being a decision of the Court of Appeal, was binding on this court.33. The plaintiffs in the Malayan Motor case had purchased a consignment of timber from the\n\nvendors on c.i.f. terms for shipment to Hodeidah. At Hodeidah, a part of the cargo (to the value of\n\nUS$17,757.40) was found missing. The vendors had at that time already assigned the all risks policy\n\nof marine insurance that they had taken out on the cargo to the plaintiffs. The vendors and the\n\nplaintiffs arrived at an understanding that the plaintiffs' bankers would deduct the value of the\n\nmissing cargo from the sum payable to the vendors and that when the plaintiffs received payment from\n\nthe insurance company for the loss, the plaintiffs would credit that sum to the vendors. When the\n\nclaim was made the insurance company disputed liability on the ground that the plaintiffs, having\n\nbeen reimbursed by the vendors, had suffered no loss. In that factual context, Wee Chong Jin CJ, at\n\nfirst instance, in his unreported judgment in Suit No. 2718/77 held:\"There was on the undisputed facts no money or other benefit received by the assured which\n\n  ought to be taken into account in diminishing the loss against which the contract of indemnity is\n\n  given. The fact that the plaintiffs have been compensated by their vendors, the assured is, in so\n\n  far as concerns the defendant underwriters, res inter alios acta. The defendants as underwriters\n\n  will be subrogated to the assured's right to recover the value of the missing timber from the\n\n  carriers.\"(Emphasis added.)and gave judgment for the plaintiffs against Malayan Motor and General Underwriters for the sum\n\nclaimed of US$17,757.40. The Court of Appeal described the arrangement reached between the vendors\n\nand the plaintiffs as \"a fair way of resolving their business relations\" and upheld his\n\ndecision.34. Mr Asokan relied on Malayan Motor as authority for the proposition that only payments by the\n\nparty who caused the loss could be taken into account as diminishing the injured party's loss. He\n\nbased this submission on the following passage in the judgment of the Court of Appeal at 526 where,\n\nin distinguishing the case of Stearns v Village Main Reef Gold Mining Co Ltd (1905) 21 TLR 236, the\n\nCourt of Appeal stated:\"There the insurers had indemnified the assured: in our case nothing has been paid by the\n\n  insurers. Another material distinction is in that case the assured was later compensated by the\n\n  party that had caused the loss. In our case the assured has not (nor the assignees) received any\n\n  payment from the carriers for the loss. The insurers therefore cannot assert, or even argue, that\n\n  they are entitled not to make any payment.\"(Emphasis added.)Mr Asokan submitted that the above dicta applied to the present case. He submitted that, as in\n\nthe Malayan Motor case, Sitra Wood, in the present case, had not received any payments from the\n\ncarrier. The fact that the payments were made by Ravate as a gift, he submitted, made those payments\n\nres inter alios acta and, following the decision in Malayan Motor, was not recoverable by the\n\ninsurers.35. I cannot accept that submission. The Court of Appeal, in my view, did not decide the Malayan\n\nMotor case on the broad basis that where compensation was paid by someone other than the carrier,\n\nthe insurers are precluded from arguing that they need not make payment. All that the Court of\n\nAppeal was doing, in the above passage relied on by Sitra Wood, was highlighting the differences\n\nbetween the case they were considering and the case of Stearns. The basis of the Court of Appeal's\n\ndecision is to be found in the sentence immediately following the passage relied on by Mr Asokan\n\nwhere Sinnathuray J, adopting the language used by Wee Chong Jin CJ, said:\"The point to be emphasised is neither the assured (plaintiffs) nor the assignees\n\n  (vendors) have received any money from anyone which as the learned Chief Justice has observed\n\n  'ought to be taken into account in diminishing the loss against which the contract of indemnity is\n\n  given.' \"The question to ask therefore is: were the payments made by Ravate payments which ought to be\n\ntaken into account in diminishing the loss against which the contract of indemnity was given?36. On the facts as I have found them to be, Ravate made the payments to Sitra Wood under a\n\ncontractual obligation to do so. It was therefore Ravate which suffered a loss when the Arktis Queen\n\nsank. Despite what Mrs Patel claimed, I find that it was because Ravate, at the relevant time, had\n\naccepted that position that Ravate agreed to make payments to Sitra Wood and thereafter, quite\n\nproperly, had handed the bills of lading over to its insurers, subrogated to those insurers its\n\nrights against the carrier for the loss of the cargo and obtained payment in compensation of that\n\nloss from its insurers. In those circumstances, the payments by Ravate to Sitra Wood were, in my\n\nview, payments that clearly ought to be taken into account in diminishing the loss of Sitra Wood. As\n\nSitra Wood has been paid in full for the cargo, Sitra Wood has suffered no loss. Their claim against\n\nRoyal & Sun therefore fails.",
        "Insurable interest.": "37. Whether Sitra Wood had an insurable interest in the cargo has been dealt with above. This was\n\na credit sale. That being so, Sitra Wood, even if it had an insurable interest at the time of\n\nloading, no longer had any such interest when Ravate accepted the terms of the credit and the\n\nendorsed bills of lading were handed over to Ravate. Besides, Sitra Wood - having been fully paid by\n\nRavate for the cargo - suffered no loss. The question of whether it had an insurable interest is\n\ntherefore academic.",
        "Clause 16 - ITTF Clauses.": "38. In its Defence, Royal & Sun had pleaded, in the alternative, that Sitra Wood was in\n\nbreach of cl 16 of the ITTF Clauses in that Sitra Wood had failed to take reasonable measures to\n\nensure that all rights against carriers, bailees and other third parties were properly preserved.\n\nSitra Wood, in its Reply, denied that it was in breach of cl 16. Sitra Wood further pleaded that\n\nRoyal & Sun are estopped from relying on cl 16 of the ITTF Clauses and/or had waived the\n\nrequirements of the said clause. As I have decided this case on the grounds that Sitra Wood's claim\n\nfails because Sitra Wood has not suffered any loss, it is not necessary for me to consider this\n\nissue. I only do so for the sake of completeness.39. It was not in dispute that the ITTF Clauses were applicable in this case. Clause 16 provided\n\nas follows:\"MINIMISING LOSSES.16 It is the duty of the Assured and their servants and agents in respect of loss recoverable\n\n  hereunder16.1 to take such measures as may be reasonable for the purpose of averting or minimising such\n\n  loss and16.2 to ensure that all rights against carriers, bailees or other third parties are properly\n\n  preserved and exercised and the Underwriters will, in addition to any loss recoverable hereunder,\n\n  reimburse the Assured for any charges properly and reasonably incurred in pursuance of these\n\n  duties.\"(Emphasis added.)Sitra Wood was reminded of this obligation by Webster (see penultimate paragraph of Webster's\n\nletter to Sitra Wood dated 13 October 1999 quoted in paragraph 8 above).40. By Article 111, rule 6, of the Haque Rules, there is a one-year time limitation within which\n\nsuits against the carrier for damage to or loss of cargo is to be instituted. That rule specifies\n\nthat such suits have to be brought instituted \"within one year of their delivery or of the date\n\nwhen they should have been delivered\". Sitra Wood did not commence proceedings against the\n\ncarrier until 16 August 2000. The unchallenged evidence before me was that the voyage between\n\nSingapore and the Reunion Islands would take approximately 12 to 13 days. The Arktis Queen, in the\n\nnormal course of events, would therefore have reached the Reunion Islands by about 11 July 1999. The\n\nsuit commenced by Sitra Wood against the carrier on 16 August 2000 was therefore time-barred.41. Mr Asokan submitted that Sitra Wood was not in breach of cl 16 of the ITTF Clauses as Royal\n\n& Sun had not specifically required Sitra Wood to commence proceedings against the carrier. In\n\nparticular, Mr Asokan referred to Webster's letter of 13 October 1999 to Sitra Wood (paragraph 8\n\nabove) and pointed out that nowhere in that letter had Webster required Sitra Wood to file a writ\n\nfor the benefit of Royal & Sun. To quote from Mr Asokan's submission:\"The defendants (Royal & Sun) were not interested in the plaintiffs (Sitra Wood)\n\n  filing a writ to protect the defendants' rights. They cannot now complain. They misled the\n\n  plaintiffs and/or made them act on a mistaken basis. It is most unfair and/or\n\n  inconscionable.\"I could see nothing \"unfair\" or \"unconscionable\" in the conduct of Royal\n\n& Sun or Webster. The obligation to properly preserve the rights that Sitra Wood had, or might\n\nhave had, against the carrier, bailees or other third parties, was on Sitra Wood. Royal & Sun by\n\nWebster's letter of 13 October 2000 had reminded Sitra Wood of this obligation. Sitra Wood, on its\n\npart, perhaps because it had received full payment from Ravate, did nothing, until 16 August 2000,\n\nin pursuance of this obligation. By its inaction, Sitra Wood has prejudiced Royal & Sun's right\n\nof subrogation.42. The obligation of an assured to prosecute claims is summarised in Arnould's Law of Marine\n\nInsurance and Average (16th Ed at paragraph 1320) as follows:\"Although it is clear that the assured must not actively prejudice the right of\n\n  subrogation, it appears that there is no obligation on the assured, apart from express provisions\n\n  in the policy, to take any active steps to prosecute claims, or to preserve time-limits, before\n\n  his claim under the policy has been paid. There is, however, an express obligation on the assured\n\n  under the Bailee Clause in the Institute Cargo Clauses to 'ensure that all rights against\n\n  carriers, bailees or other third parties are properly preserved and exercised.' It is submitted\n\n  that the effect of this important clause is to give the underwriter a cross-claim for damages,\n\n  which in appropriate circumstances may amount to a full defence to a claim under the policy, in\n\n  any case where the assured has failed to preserve a time-limit against the third party, or has\n\n  committed some other breach of the obligations imposed by the clause.\"There was in the present case, an obligation under cl 16 of the ITTF Clauses on the assured\n\n(Sitra Wood) to ensure that all rights against carriers, bailees or other third parties were\n\nproperly preserved. Sitra Wood had breached this obligation. I accept the view expressed by Arnould\n\nthat such a breach would give the underwriter a cross-claim for damages. As the breach in this case\n\nwould result in Royal & Sun's right by way of subrogation becoming nugatory, such breach would\n\nbe a full defence to Sitra Wood's claim under the policy for the invoiced value of the cargo.43. For the above reasons, I dismiss with costs Sitra Wood's claim against Royal & Sun.",
