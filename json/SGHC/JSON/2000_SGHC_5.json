        "Background": "1. The plaintiffs are a ship-owning\n\ncompany incorporated in Thailand. In October 1998, they chartered their vessel,Nopporn\n\nNaree, to the defendants, a Singapore company. The vessel was delivered to the\n\ndefendants on 18 October 1998 on the basis that charter hire would be paid every 15 days\n\nin advance. The vessel then took on cargo in accordance with the defendants’\n\ninstructions and commenced a voyage to Galverston, Texas, USA which was estimated to take\n\nup to 16 December 1998. The defendants paid charter hire on taking delivery but failed to\n\npay the next two instalments of hire payable for the periods from 2 November 1998 to 16\n\nNovember 1998 and from 17 November 1998 to 2 December 1998.2. On 23 November 1998, the plaintiffs\n\ncommenced this action to recover the sum of US$175,000 comprising the outstanding hire and\n\nother payments due from the defendants. On the same day, they applied for, and were\n\ngranted, a mareva injunction. The specific terms of the order prevented the defendants by\n\ntheir agents or employees from removing from Singapore or in any way disposing of or\n\ndealing with or diminishing the value of any of their assets which were in Singapore\n\nwhether in their own name or not and whether solely or jointly owned up to the value of\n\nUS$500,000. This prohibition included the defendants’ assets in their US$ account\n\nwith the Rabobank, Singapore branch.3. The injunction order was obtained in\n\nthe evening. The plaintiffs’ solicitors caused a notice of injunction to be sent at\n\n6.18 pm the same day by facsimile transmission from their firm to the fax number of the\n\ndefendants. The actual order and the writ in the action were, however, only physically\n\nserved on the defendants on the next day, 24 November 1998. The defendants did not enter\n\nan appearance to the action and judgment in default of appearance was obtained by the\n\nplaintiffs on 31 December 1998.4. In the meantime, on 8 December 1998,\n\nthe plaintiffs obtained an order requiring disclosure of assets by the defendants. The\n\ndefendants were ordered to inform the plaintiffs in writing at once of all their assets in\n\nSingapore and whether in their own name or not, and whether solely or jointly owned,\n\ngiving up to date information about the value, location and details of such assets and\n\nthis information had to be confirmed in an affidavit sworn or affirmed by or on behalf on\n\nthe defendants and served within seven days of service of the court order. This second\n\norder of court was served on the defendants at their registered office on 10 December\n\n1998.5. The defendants have three directors\n\neach of whom is also a shareholder in the company. Only one of these directors and\n\nshareholders is resident in Singapore. He is Mr Tay Sien Djim also known Moses Tay. At the\n\nmaterial time, Mr Tay’s address was 92 Seletar Hill Drive, Singapore. On 4 January\n\n1999, a clerk from the plaintiffs’ solicitors’ office went to this address and\n\nserved on Mr Tay copies of the first and second injunction orders.6. In the meantime, the plaintiffs’\n\nsolicitors had discovered from documents provided to them by the Rabobank pursuant to a\n\ncourt order that on 24 November 1998 the defendants had withdrawn US$96,000 (equivalent to\n\nS$150,000) from their US$ account at the said bank. The withdrawal had been effected in\n\nstages. First, the sum of US$96,000 was transferred from the defendants’ US$ account\n\nto their Singapore dollar account with Rabobank. This account was credited with S$150,000.\n\nThe S$150,000 was immediately withdrawn by way of a cash cheque for this amount drawn by\n\nRabobank on its account with the Standard Chartered Bank Singapore. The cash cheque was\n\nhanded to Mr Tay who had initiated these transactions on behalf of the defendants, and the\n\nsame was cashed by Mr Tay at the Standard Chartered Bank’s branch at Battery Road at\n\nabout 12.22 pm the same fternoon.7. On 4 February 1999, the defendants\n\nfiled an affidavit in purported satisfaction of the second order of court. This affidavit\n\nexhibited a list of the defendants’ assets. This list did not, however, include the\n\nsum of US$96,000 withdrawn from the Rabobank account. Nor did it make mention of any debt\n\nowing to the defendants by Mr Tay.8. The plaintiffs took the view that the\n\ndefendants and Mr Tay were in contempt of both the orders of court mentioned and applied\n\nfor an order of committal against both of them. The plaintiffs applied for Mr Tay to be\n\ncommitted to prison and for Mr Tay and the defendants to be ordered to restore the sum of\n\nS$150,000 which had been taken from the defendants’ account on 24 November 1998. The\n\nplaintiffs also asked for costs.9. The contempt proceedings were heard\n\nbefore me between 13 to 15 September 1999. The stand taken by Mr Tay and the defendants\n\nwas that they had had no knowledge of the mareva injunction at the time when Mr Tay cashed\n\nthe cheque for S$150,000 and disposed of the proceeds and that therefore they were not in\n\ncontempt of court. At the conclusion of the hearing, I found both defendants guilty of\n\ncontempt in relation to the handling and disposal of the S$150,000 from the Rabobank\n\naccount and ordered both to procure the repayment of that sum to the company’s\n\naccount with the said bank. I also found them guilty of contempt in not making a proper\n\ndisclosure of the company’s assets in the affidavit of Mr Tay filed on 4 February\n\n1999.10. Sentencing was postponed for one month\n\nupon the application of the defendants’ counsel. This was to give Mr Tay time to make\n\nthe restitution ordered. When court reconvened on 13 October 1999, however, it appeared\n\nthat although Mr Tay had made attempts to raise funds he had not been able to do so. After\n\nhearing the mitigation plea, I sentenced Mr Tay to three months’ imprisonment for his\n\ncontempt of court. Appeals against conviction have been lodged by both Mr Tay and the\n\ndefendants and Mr Tay has also appealed against the sentence imposed.The evidence11. The documentary evidence established\n\nthat the defendant company was notified by facsimile transmission at about 6.18 pm on 23\n\nNovember 1998 of the injunction obtained by the plaintiffs against it. The defendants did\n\nnot take the stand that the fax had not been received in their office on that date or at\n\nthat time. Their stand was that they had no notice of the injunction that day because the\n\nfax was received after their office closed at about 5.30 pm and that Mr Tay, the only\n\ndirector present in Singapore, did not see the fax until he arrived at the office sometime\n\nafter 1 pm on 24 November 1998. By that time he had already withdrawn the S$150,000 from\n\nRabobank. The documentary evidence also established that the cash cheque issued by\n\nRabobank for S$150,000 was cashed by the Standard Chartered Bank at approximately 12.22 pm\n\nthat day.12. The plaintiffs’ evidence in the\n\ncontempt proceedings was adduced by way of an affidavit filed by their solicitor, Mr\n\nAugustine Liew which exhibited the court orders, the procedural steps taken by the\n\nplaintiffs and the documents obtained by them about and from the defendants, including\n\ncorrespondence from the defendants’ solicitors and documents supplied by Rabobank.\n\nThe plaintiffs also relied on an affidavit filed by one Mr Woon Kim Leng, a ship broker\n\nwho had sent a fax to the defendants’ office on 24 November 1998 and who had spoken\n\nto Mr Hector Goh of the defendants. Mr Woon was cross-examined by the defendants’\n\nsolicitors on his affidavit.13. The defendants filed two affidavits to\n\ncontest the plaintiffs’ allegations. The first was made by Mr Moses Tay and the\n\nsecond by Mr Goh Hean Sung who was employed by the defendants as a manager between 18 May\n\n1998 and 30 November 1998. Mr Goh did not, however, attend for cross-examination on his\n\naffidavit and I accordingly had to disregard it. The defendants’ only witness was,\n\ntherefore, Mr Tay.14. The facts which the defendants wanted\n\nme to find were as set out in Mr Tay’s affidavit of 12 May 1999. He stated that\n\nwhilst the registered address of the company was at No. 2 Handy Road #09-08/09 Cathay\n\nBuilding, its place of business was at 101 Thomson Road, #26-02 United Square. The\n\nregistered office was only a secretarial office and its operational hours were between 9\n\nam and 5.30 pm. The defendants operated their own office between 9 am to 6 pm, five days a\n\nweek although fax machine, telephone lines and telex machine were on 24 hours a day. At\n\nthe material time, the defendants employed two persons namely Hector Goh (presumably that\n\nwas Goh Hean Sung), a shipping manager, and Tan Gek Choo, an assistant manager, to assist\n\nMr Tay in the operations of the defendants’ business. Mr Tay was overall in charge of\n\noperations. The other directors were investors and were not involved with the\n\ndefendants’ business.15. Mr Tay said that he was never\n\npersonally served with the mareva injunction and the other order of court which formed the\n\nsubject matter of the plaintiffs’ application for contempt. The writ and mareva\n\ninjunction were only served on the defendants at their registered address on 24 November\n\n1998 at 3 pm although by the time Mr Tay returned to the office at 1 pm on 24 November\n\n1998 he had sight of the plaintiffs’ solicitors’ letter of 23 November 1998\n\nwhich had been faxed to the business office at about 6.16 pm that day. Mr Tay reiterated\n\nthat he was not in the business office at 6.16 pm on 23 November 1998 as he had left for\n\nthe day at about 1700 hours. He could not recall exactly where he was nor what he had done\n\nbut it was likely that he had gone home. He did not know whether his two employees were in\n\nthe business office at the time when the fax was sent but he did not receive any call from\n\neither of them on the evening of 23 November in relation to the fax.16. On 24 November 1998 at about 12 noon,\n\nhe was at the Rabobank drawing out the sum of S$150,000 for the purpose of a loan to\n\nhimself. He remembered drawing up a cash cheque on 23 November for S$150,000. The next\n\nday, 24November 1998, before going to the business office, he attended at the\n\nRabobank to present the cheque for payment. Rabobank then paid through a Standard\n\nChartered Bank cheque which he encashed on the same day.17. Mr Tay went on to say that during the\n\nperiod from May 1998 to November 1998 he had periodically made deposits into the Rabobank\n\naccount and each deposit had exceeded S$30,000. Similarly he had also made cash\n\nwithdrawals from the Rabobank account. He said that in the course of his appointment as a\n\ndirector of the defendant company, he had made advances amounting to approximately\n\nS$700,000 to the company and had also taken loans of varying amounts from it. As of the\n\ndate of the affidavit, the amount which he had borrowed from the defendant company stood\n\nat approximately S$1,050,000.18. Mr Tay reiterated that at the time\n\nwhen he encashed the cheque at the Standard Chartered Bank he did not know of the mareva\n\ninjunction that was issued and neither was he informed of it by anyone from his office or\n\nfrom the secretary’s office. He only knew about the injunction when he returned to\n\nhis office at about 1 pm on 24 November 1998 and read the documents.19. Mr Tay referred to the\n\ndefendants’ solicitors’ letter to the plaintiffs’ solicitors on 25 January\n\n1999 and stated that the same explained why he had not been able to comply with the second\n\norder of court, that dated 8 December 1998. He restated the reasons in his affidavit as\n\nfollows:(1) he originally thought that he had to\n\n  obtain a full set of accounts namely the balance sheets and profit and loss accounts and\n\n  therefore upon receipt of the order he proceeded to seek the assistance of the auditors to\n\n  prepare them;(2) however, the accounts could not be\n\n  prepared as the bank statements for December 1998 had not been received from the banks and\n\n  also the two foreign directors had not agreed to nor approved the accounts. Mr Tay\n\n  subsequently discovered from Rabobank that as all the defendants’ facilities with\n\n  that bank had been cancelled upon the bank’s receipt of the injunction order the bank\n\n  had not issued any further statement to the defendants after November 1998. He was\n\n  therefore not able to submit bank statements to the plaintiffs.20. Mr Tay said that after receiving a\n\nletter from the plaintiffs’ solicitors on 11 January 1999 he decided to engage a firm\n\nof solicitors to reply on his behalf. It was only then that he discovered that he had to\n\nfile a list of the defendant company’s assets and did so on 4 February 1999.\n\nParagraph 14 of that affidavit he said itemised the quantity of the assets described and\n\nalso their value. As these assets were all items of office equipment, they were in the\n\ndefendants’ business office at that time. He therefore thought it unnecessary to set\n\nout the location of the items. As to the bank account, Mr Tay stated that it had not\n\noccurred to him that he had to furnish particulars of the bank account. He then went on to\n\nsay that as at the date when the order was served the company had had only two bank\n\naccounts, one a US$ account and the other a Singapore dollar account, and both were with\n\nRabobank. He disclosed the balances of the accounts as being US$3,565.37 and S$7,955.01\n\nrespectively.21. The main issue was whether the\n\ndefendants had been aware of the injunction order at the time the money from the Rabobank\n\naccount had been withdrawn and disposed of. The only evidence on their lack of knowledge\n\ncame from Mr Tay. Neither Mr Goh nor his colleague were called to confirm Mr Tay’s\n\nposition. The credibility or otherwise of Mr Tay was therefore vital to both parties and\n\nas a result he was cross-examined intensively. His credibility was severely damaged by\n\nthis process.22. Mr Tay agreed that as a director of\n\nthe defendants he knew of its indebtedness to various creditors. He confirmed that as at\n\n30 November 1998 the defendant company was insolvent because of a net loss of\n\napproximately S$1.09 million. Out of that net loss, S$1.04 million could be attributed to\n\nloans taken by him from the company. As at 23 November, he had owed the company about\n\nS$911,000 and the extra S$150,000 of indebtedness had come from the loan the company made\n\nto him on 24 November. Mr Tay admitted that there was no directors’ resolution which\n\nhad authorised any of the loans taken by him. In answer to my question as to who had\n\nauthorised the loans, his reply was ‘nobody’. He was asked whether in those\n\ncircumstances the taking of the loans amounted to criminal breach of trust. His reply was\n\nthere was no question of criminal breach of trust and that he could not be in breach of\n\ntrust if the defendants’ shareholders were not taking action against him.23. Mr Tay then agreed that he had gone to\n\nHong Kong on 3 December 1998 to see the shareholders but that up to the date of the\n\nhearing he had not received any approval from the shareholders in respect of the loans\n\nmade to him. When he was asked what reason there could have been for the shareholders to\n\nadvance to him the S$150,000 which he had borrowed on 24 November 1998, his reply was that\n\nhe had no answer to the question and that he did not understand it. It was then put that\n\nthere was no reason for the defendants to advance him that money when doing so would\n\nincrease the defendants’ insolvency. Again his response was ‘I have no means of\n\nanswering this question’.24. Later in his cross-examination, Mr Tay\n\nstated that the other shareholders had first known about the various loans which the\n\ncompany had made him when he visited them in Hong Kong in December 1998. He had told them\n\nthat the purpose of the various loans was to settle his gambling debts and this news had\n\nupset them. He tried to persuade them to sign a directors’ resolution approving the\n\nloans but after a series of discussions they told him that they needed time to consider\n\nthe matter. He then flew back to Singapore. Thereafter, he called them many times but they\n\nwould not agree to sign either the resolution or the company’s accounts. It was clear\n\nto me from this testimony that Mr Tay had treated the defendants’ funds as his own to\n\nbe used as suited his convenience and that he had no regard for the legalities which\n\nshould have governed the use of such funds.25. Mr Tay was queried on the purpose of\n\nthe loan of S$150,000. His reply was that it was made to enable him to settle his personal\n\ndebt. Subsequently, he was asked whom he had owed this money to. His reply was that he did\n\nnot have the full names and details of his creditors. When pressed further as to what he\n\nhad done with the S$150,000 Mr Tay said:‘I know one Bobby. I gave Bobby\n\n  $150,000 the same day, 24/11/98. I met him in a coffee shop in Toa Payoh at about 7pm.\n\n  Coffee shop in Toa Payoh, Lorong 8. Bobby works for a gambling syndicate. I gambled on\n\n  board a casino ship. That was the Superstar Leo. Bobby’s employer provided me with\n\n  credit for the purpose of gambling. Bobby’s employer provides credit facilities for\n\n  people who gamble on board ships.’26. This evidence was interesting because\n\nit indicated that Mr Tay had had the S$150,000 in his hands when he returned to the office\n\nand learnt about the injunction order. Paying the money over to Bobby at 7 pm that night\n\nin full knowledge of the order would have been a flagrant breach of it. Mr Tay gave this\n\nevidence in the morning. After lunch he retracted it. Immediately he took the stand in the\n\nafternoon Mr Tay volunteered the following:‘In my earlier testimony, I made a\n\n  mistake in relation to the timing of the meeting with Bobby. The particular transaction of\n\n  handing over the money to him was done immediately after withdrawing the money from the\n\n  bank. He was waiting for me outside the bank.’Mr Tay was then asked how he had realised\n\nthat 7 pm was the wrong time and his reply was that it was because he had had more than\n\none transaction with Bobby and that the 7 pm meeting he had mentioned actually referred to\n\na previous transaction that had taken place about a week earlier. Mr Tay conceded that he\n\ndid not keep any diary of what he did and when asked what had prompted him to recollect\n\nsomething different, his answer was that the break had given him an opportunity to\n\nrecollect the events that occurred during the relevant days.27. More questions were put to Mr Tay\n\nregarding his meeting with Bobby. He said that he had gone to the Rabobank office at\n\nRepublic Plaza, Raffles Place around noon or late morning. Bobby waited for him at the\n\nground floor of Republic Plaza. Then the two of them walked to the Standard Chartered Bank\n\nbranch at Battery Road. Mr Tay went into the bank alone. Bobby waited outside the bank.\n\nAfter Mr Tay cashed his cheque, he left the bank and handed the money over to Bobby in the\n\nstreet. The money was not in an envelope. He just handed the notes directly to Bobby who\n\nthen left. I found it difficult to believe this story. Mr Tay had a cash cheque from\n\nRabobank. He could have given that cheque to Bobby inside Standard Chartered Bank office\n\nor he could even have given the S$150,000 in cash to Bobby in the bank lobby. Why should\n\nBobby wait for him on the street? In any case, why should Bobby go with him to both banks\n\ninstead of meeting him in the evening at the coffee shop which was their more frequent\n\nmeeting place? Mr Tay did not give any reason why in this case the money should have been\n\nhanded over outside the bank instead of elsewhere. The only reason I could attribute for\n\nthe change in his evidence was his realisation of the implications of what he had said\n\nbefore the lunch break. It was also noteworthy that he had not deigned to explain his use\n\nof the money in his affidavit. He had only come up with this story in answer to\n\ncross-examination questions. It appeared to me to be an afterthought.28. There were other difficulties with Mr\n\nTay’s story of having disposed of the S$150,000 in ignorance of the court order. The\n\nRabobank statement of account showed that just prior to 24 November 1998, the defendant\n\ncompany’s US$ call deposit account had a credit balance of US$96.30. On that day a\n\ndeposit of US$97,014.03 was made bringing the credit balance up to US$97,110.33. On the\n\nsame day, the sum of US$96,000 was withdrawn and this left the account with a balance of\n\nUS$1,110.33.29. Mr Tay stated in evidence that he had\n\ndrawn up and signed a cash cheque on the defendants’ US$ account for US$96,000 at\n\nabout 5.30 pm on the evening of 23 November. He had done this despite the fact that the\n\naccount held insufficient funds to meet this cheque on that date because he knew that a\n\nfreight payment due to the defendants would be coming into the account the next day and\n\nbecause he knew he was not going into the office the next morning since he had to run some\n\nerrands. When asked, Mr Tay could not remember what errands he had had to run on the\n\nmorning of 24 November. That failure of memory was surprising considering that Mr Tay was\n\nable to remember all the details of his meeting with Bobby on the morning of 24 November\n\nand could specify that he reached the office at 1 pm that day. There were only two\n\npossible reasons why he could not remember the details of his errands. The first was\n\nbecause there had been no errands to run. The second was because he truly had a bad memory\n\nso that details of what he had done in the past eluded him in which event the details of\n\nhis meeting with Bobby could only have been recounted so clearly because he had made them\n\nall up.30. The next morning, having carried the\n\nsigned cash cheque home in his briefcase, Mr Tay went about his errands, carrying the\n\ncheque with him and then went to the bank around noon to cash the cheque. He was not\n\nworried about losing the cheque and explained that he had dated it 24 November although he\n\nhad drawn it up on 23 November because he knew he would be able to cash the cheque the\n\nnext day. I asked him whether it would not have been safer to carry an uncompleted cheque\n\nleaf around with him. He agreed that that would have been the safer course but said that\n\nhe frequently carried large amounts of cash with him.31. I could not accept Mr Tay’s story\n\nthat the cheque for S$150,000 was drawn up in the evening of 23 November and post-dated to\n\n24 November because he was absolutely certain that the money would be in the next day. I\n\nthink that it is more probable that he checked with the bank on the morning of 24 November\n\nand drew up the cheque that morning when the bank informed him that the money had been\n\nreceived. He could not admit this because he wanted to maintain the fiction that the\n\ndecision to withdraw had been made on 23 November before he could possibly have had notice\n\nof the injunction. It is not credible that Mr Tay could have known for sure on 23 November\n\nthat the money would be in the bank the next day even if he had spoken to the remitting\n\nparty as he maintained. Intercontinental transfers of money are not instantaneous and even\n\nif a telegraphic remittance is made by one party on one day the recipient cannot be\n\ncertain that he will receive it the next day.32. In relation to the other allegation of\n\ncontempt of court, Mr Tay was asked why when he filed his affidavit of 4 February 1999\n\nthere had been no mention of any debt owing by him to the defendants. His reply was\n\n‘I have no answer’. He had mentioned this indebtedness, however, in two\n\naffidavits which he had filed in other actions. He was asked why the difference. His\n\nanswer was that he could only assume that there was no specific request in this action for\n\na list of debtors. He was then told that in this action there was a request for a list of\n\nassets. Mr Tay made no response for a long time. Finally he said that all that he could\n\nsay was that it was probable that the omission was an oversight.33. I was satisfied after hearing and\n\nconsidering the evidence that the defendants and Mr Tay had had notice of the injunction\n\norder before the sum of S$150,000 was withdrawn from the Rabobank account and definitely\n\nbefore the money was disposed of by Mr Tay whether by payment to Bobby as he alleged or by\n\npayment to anyone else. I was also satisfied that he had deliberately omitted mention in\n\nhis affidavit detailing the defendants’ assets of the amounts in the Rabobank\n\naccounts and the amounts of his indebtedness to the defendant company to try and conceal\n\nthe fact that he had disposed of money belonging to the defendants after having had notice\n\nof the mareva injunction. I therefore found him and the defendants guilty of contempt of\n\ncourt.34. As regards sentence, I took the view\n\nthat the nature of the contempt was serious. Mr Tay had deliberately disregarded the\n\ncourt’s order for his own personal benefit and by doing so had put himself and the\n\ncompany in contempt. He had put his own interests above those of the company and its\n\ncreditors. He showed no respect whatsoever for any party other than himself. He was not\n\nable to recover any of the money that he had disposed of despite having known of the\n\ncontempt proceedings from at least May 1999 and having been given a further month to raise\n\nmoney after conviction. By his actions, both the defendant company and its creditors have\n\nsuffered. Court orders must be respected and there was no excuse for his conduct. In the\n\ncircumstances, I considered that three months was a fair sentence.JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGESINGAPORECopyright © Government of Singapore."
