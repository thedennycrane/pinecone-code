        "Introduction": "1       The\nplaintiff, Triulzi Cesare SRL (“Triulzi”), a company incorporated in\nItaly, is in the business of,inter alia,\nmanufacturing and producing horizontal and vertical washing machines\nfor glass sheets. The defendant, Xinyi Group (Glass) Company Limited\n(“Xinyi”), a company incorporated in Hong Kong, is in the business\nof manufacturing and selling,inter alia, float\nglass products, solar glass products, automobile glass products\nand other associated products in the People’s Republic of China. 2       Triulzi\nand Xinyi entered into three contracts on 17 November 2009 for Xinyi’s\npurchase of Triulzi’s washing machines. The precise contractual arrangements\nbetween the parties are not relevant to the present application.\nSuffice to say for now, the three contracts provided for any disputes\nbetween the parties to be resolved by arbitration in Singapore. 3       Disputes\narose between the parties that led to Xinyi commencing an arbitration\nin the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber\nof Commerce (“ICC”)videCase No.\n18848/CYK) (“the Arbitration”). The sole arbitrator, Mr Woo Tchi\nChu (“the Tribunal”), was appointed by the end of September 2012.\nThe Arbitration was governed by the ICC Rules of Arbitration 2012\n(“the ICC Rules 2012”). 4       On\n12 August 2013, the Tribunal issued a final award dated 12 August 2013\n(“the Award”) which was forwarded to the parties by the ICC Secretariat\non 19 August 2013. The Tribunal allowed Xinyi’s claim and dismissed\nTriulzi’s counterclaim. 5       Triulzi\nfiled Originating Summons No 1114 of 2013 (“OS 1114/2013”) on 18\nNovember 2013 to set aside the Award under Art 34(2) of the UNCITRAL\nModel Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985 (“the Model\nLaw”), as set out in the First Schedule to the International Arbitration\nAct (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IAA”), and s 24(b)\nof the IAA. 6       Mr\nPaul Tan (“Mr Tan”) represented Triulzi in OS 1114/2013 while Mr\nShum Wai Keong (“Mr Shum”) was Triulzi’s counsel in the Arbitration. Ms\nKoh Swee Yen (“Ms Koh”) represented Xinyi in both OS 1114/2013 and the\nArbitration.",
        "Gist of the underlying dispute\nin the Arbitration": "",
        "Xinyi’s case": "7       By\ncl 15 of each contract, upon the installation of each washing machine\nat Xinyi’s premises, an acceptance test would be conducted by both\nparties in accordance with the technical specifications. This involved an\n8-hour uninterrupted test with different sizes of glass sheets.\nIf the installed machine failed the acceptance test, Xinyi could\nthen cancel the respective contract and Triulzi would have to refund\nXinyi the purchase price. Triulzi was allowed to make modifications\nto the machine twice but the acceptance period must not extend beyond\n70 days. 8       Xinyi’s\ncase, as stated in the Award, was that sometime during July 2010,\nthe first washing machine was delivered to and installed at Xinyi’s facility\nby Triulzi pursuant to the first contract. The machine was found\nto be faulty on several occasions and it underwent modifications.\nDespite all that, the machine still failed to meet the technical\nspecifications stipulated in the first contract. Stains were found\non the glass sheets after being washed in the machine. An acceptance\ntest was carried out from 7 to 12 May 2011 and the machine failed\nthe acceptance test. In or around May 2011, Xinyi cancelled the\nfirst contract by asking Triulzi to take back the machine. 9       On\nor around 15 February 2011, the second washing machine was delivered\nto and installed at Xinyi’s facility by Triulzi pursuant to the second\ncontract. Xinyi informed Triulzi that the machine also failed to\nmeet the technical specifications stipulated in the second contract.\nXinyi cancelled the second contract on 8 June 2011. 10     On\nor around 5 March 2011, Xinyi paid 10% of the purchase price of the\nthird washing machine pursuant to the third contract. In view of\nthe defects found in the second machine, Triulzi was requested,\non or around 25 April 2011, to conduct a detailed factory inspection\nof the third machine before delivering it to Xinyi’s facility. Triulzi\ndid not respond to this request and did not deliver the third machine\nto Xinyi. Thereafter, Xinyi cancelled the third contract on or around\n8 June 2011. 11     In\nthe Arbitration, Xinyi claimed for a refund of the purchase price paid\nunder all three contracts as well as damages.",
        "Triulzi’s case": "12     Triulzi’s\nAnswer and Counterclaim in the Arbitration was that the first washing\nmachine was fully operational by late December 2010 or early January\n2011. Triulzi alleged that the first machine’s faulty performance was\ndue to the dirty and dusty environment of Xinyi’s premises where\nit was installed and the lack of proper maintenance of the machine\nby Xinyi. Furthermore, the stains on the glass sheets were not caused\nby the first machine but from another machine which processed the\nglass sheets in the manufacturing process. According to Triulzi,\nall issues with the first machine were resolved by March 2011. Xinyi\ndid not reject the first machine and did not ask Triulzi to take\nthe machine back. 13     As\nregards the second washing machine, Triulzi’s position was that\nits technician could not properly install and test the second machine\nas Xinyi failed to provide the necessary facilities for proper testing.\nHowever, the second machine was thereafter found to be operational\nduring the technician’s second visit. Despite the fact that the\nfirst and second washing machines were properly installed and functional,\nXinyi failed to make full payment of the purchase price for both\nmachines. 14     Triulzi\nalso claimed that the third machine was never delivered because\nof Xinyi’s stated intention to reject the delivery of the machine\nin a letter dated 8 June 2011 to Triulzi. 15     Triulzi\ntherefore counterclaimed for the balance of the purchase price owing\nunder the first two contracts and specific performance of the third contract.",
        "The Award": "16     The\nevidential hearing was held from 22 to 25 April 2013. The events, prior\nto 22 April 2013 and at the evidential hearing itself, are at the\nheart of OS 1114/2013. A chronology of the relevant events is set\nout below (at [25]– [43]). Paragraphs of the Award that are relevant\nto OS 1114/2013 are set out in the course of this Judgment.",
        "Outline of the issues in OS\n1114/2013": "17     Triulzi\nalleges a number of serious breaches in the Tribunal’s conduct of\nthe arbitral proceedings which had caused it prejudice. According\nto Mr Tan, the Tribunal’s conduct violated a number of obligations\nunder the IAA and the Model Law. Triulzi submits that the Award\nshould be set aside on the following grounds: (a)     on\nthe basis of Art 34(2)(a)(iv) of\nthe Model Law in that the Tribunal’s decision to admit Xinyi’s expert\nwitness statement was in breach of the parties’ agreed arbitral\nprocedure (“Issue 1”); (b)     on\nthe basis of Art 34(2)(a)(ii) of\nthe Model Law and s 24(b) of the\nIAA in that Triulzi was,inter alia,\nnot afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard in respect of\nexpert evidence (“Issue 2”); and (c)     on\nthe basis of Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of\nthe Model Law in that the decision of the Tribunal not to apply\nthe United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods\n(“the CISG”) as the applicable law of the three contracts does not\naccord with the public policy of Singapore (“Issue 3”). 18     Mr\nTan’s fall-back argument, which is an alternative to Issue 1, arises in\nthe absence of a procedural agreement to exclude expert evidence.\nHis fall-back argument is that the Award may be set aside under Art 34(2)(a)(iv) if it was not in accordance with\nArt 18 of Model Law (“Issue 1A”). 19     The\noutline of Issues 1 and 2 above is set out in board terms based\non the challenges advanced in court. As I see it, the nub of the\ncomplaints for Issues 1 and 2 are the same in that they are challenges\nto the procedural orders or directions made in the course of the\narbitral proceedings rather than a challenge to the making of the\nAward. This distinction is important. As stated below (at [52]–[53]),\ncomplaints against procedural orders or directions cannot give rise\nto the setting aside of an award unless the procedural orders or\ndirections in question resulted in a breach of an agreed arbitral\nprocedure or a breach of natural justice (ie,\nthe procedural nature of the right to be heard), as a result of\nwhich a party’s rights have been prejudiced (see s 24(b) of the IAA). This is the first legal\nobstacle that Triulzi has to overcome. I will elaborate on the case\nmanagement powers of the arbitral tribunal later in this decision. 20     Significantly,\na singular query that foreshadows the outcome of OS1114/2013 is\nwhether Triulzi’s complaints are due to either circumstances attributable\nto the Tribunalorcircumstances\nthat resulted from Triulzi’s own failures or choices (tactical or\notherwise). The features in the present case that fashioned the\ncircumstances that gave rise to Triulzi’s complaints described below\n(at [25] to [43]) will be scrutinised in due course. For now, it\nis appropriate to state that there can be no basis whatsoever to\nset aside the Award under Art 34(2)(a)\nof the Model Law and s 24(b) of\nthe IAA if Triulzi’s complaints arenotpremised\nupon circumstances attributable to the Tribunal. 21     Finally,\nTriulzi’s application cited Art 31(2) of the Model Law as a ground\nfor setting aside the Award. However, this ground was not developed\nin Triulzi’s submissions, and I need say no more.",
        "Outline of Triulzi’s criticisms\nof the Tribunal": "22     I\nnow outline the specific criticisms of the Tribunal said to give\nrise to the present application to set aside the Award. The specific\ncomplaints or criticisms alleged against the Tribunal are as follows: (a)     Conduct\nprior to 22 April 2013: (i)       The Tribunal admitted Xinyi’s expert witness statement in breach\nof the parties’ purported agreed arbitral procedure to file only\nfactual witness statements. (ii)       Alternatively, the Tribunal failed to afford Triulzi a reasonable\nopportunity to file a meaningful expert witness statement in response\nto Xinyi’s expert witness, thereby resulting in a denial of a fair\nhearing. (b)     Conduct\nat the evidential hearing on 25 April 2013: (i)       The Tribunal’s refusal to admit Triulzi’s expert witness statement\non 25 April 2013 was tantamount to a failure to afford Triulzi a\nreasonable opportunity to respond to Xinyi’s expert witness, thereby\nresulting in a denial of a fair hearing. 23     The\nfailures described are said to be cumulative in effect with the result\nthat Triulzi suffered prejudice from the fact that: (a)     Triulzi\nwas prevented from advancing arguments to the Tribunal that the\nmachines in dispute had complied with the contractual technical\nspecifications, and that any non-performance was due to Xinyi’s\nlack of maintenance and the very dirty environment of Xinyi’s facility;\nand (b)     Triulzi\nwas prevented from refuting the Tribunal’s reliance on Xinyi’s expert\nevidence concerning the contractual requirement to run the subject\nmachines for 8 hours in the conduct of the acceptance test.",
        "Chronology of events relevant\nto Issues 1 and 2": "24     On\n25 September 2012, the Tribunal was formally constituted.",
        "Conduct prior to 22 April 2012": "10 to 13 December 2012 25     The\nTribunal circulated a draft procedural timetable to both parties on\n10 December 2012 (“the Draft Procedural Timetable”). According to\nthe Draft Procedural Timetable, “Witness Statements” were to be\nfiled by 28 January 2013 and the evidentiary hearing was to take\nplace from 18 to 21 February 2013. The parties then attended a Case\nManagement Conference before the Tribunal held on 11 December 2012\n(“the CMC”). The timelines in the Draft Procedural Timetable were\nthen adjusted to accommodate the various commitments of each counsel\nbefore a revised procedural timetable was adopted by the Tribunal\n(“the Procedural Timetable”). The revised timelines that were formalised\nprovided,inter alia, as follows: (a)     “Filing\nof Witness Statements” by 25 March 2013; and (b)     Hearing\ndates fixed for 22 to 25 April 2013. At the CMC, a preliminary issue relating to the governing\nlaw of the three contracts was heard. The Tribunal determined the\ngoverning law of the contracts to be Singapore law. 26     Before\nthe close of the CMC, Mr Shum proposed adopting the International\nBar Association Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International\nArbitration (“the IBA Rules”) for the purposes of the Arbitration.\nMs Koh did not object and the Tribunal duly directed that the IBA\nRules be adopted. 27     The\nTribunal forwarded to the parties the Procedural Timetable and the\nminutes of the CMC in its e-mail dated 13 December 2012. In the\nsame e-mail, the Tribunal emphasised the need to strictly adhere\nto the timelines in the Procedural Timetable:[note: 1] … The Arbitration should be completed and\nAward issued by 27 May 2013.The Tribunal intends\nto follow the agreed timelines strictly. [emphasis added] Subsequently, at the parties’ request on 22 March 2013, the\nTribunal allowed witness statements to be filed and exchanged by\n1 April 2013. No changes were made to the hearing dates. 1 to 5 April 2013 28     On\n1 April 2013, Xinyi filed the expert witness statement of Dr Bao Yiwang\n(“Dr Bao”) along with other factual witness statements. Dr Bao’s statement\ncontained a 22-paragraph report pertaining to the design and specifications\nof the first and second washing machines as well as the operating\nenvironment of Xinyi’s facility (“Dr Bao’s Report”). 29     On\n2 April 2013, Triulzi wrote asking the Tribunal to exclude Dr Bao’s\nReport from the arbitral proceedings. Triulzi alleged that it was indicated\nto the Tribunal at the CMC that the parties would not be filing any\nexpert witness statements and that, consequently, the Procedural Timetable\ndid not provide a timeline for expert witness statements to be filed.\nTriulzi’s letter dated 2 April 2013 made clear that Triulzi’s position was\nthat the parties’ “agreement” to dispense with expert evidence was reached\nat the CMC.[note: 2]Triulzi further complained\nthat no notice of Xinyi’s intention to file Dr Bao’s Report was\ngiven to Triulzi before 1 April 2013. In the circumstances, admitting\nDr Bao’s Report would thus be contrary to the alleged procedural\nagreement reached during the CMC. Triulzi also argued in its lawyer’s\nletter that the admission of Dr Bao’s Report would be prejudicial\nas Triulzi would not have an opportunity to verify the contents of\nDr Bao’s Report. Besides, Dr Bao’s Report had no probative value\nas the inspection by Dr Bao took place 21 months after the disputes\nover the washing machines arose. 30     As\nan alternative to its application to exclude Dr Bao’s Report, Triulzi sought\nan order from the Tribunal to allow it to engage an expert to inspect the\ntwo washing machines at Xinyi’s facility and to file an expert witness statement\nthereafter. Triulzi further applied for the evidentiary hearing dates\nin April to be vacated. Triulzi requested a total period of eight\nweeks: (a) four weeks from the date of the Tribunal’s order for\ninspection of the first and second washing machines at Xinyi’s facility;\nand (b) an additional four weeks for the expert’s report to be filed. 31     On\n4 April 2013, the Tribunal replied that the minutes of the CMC contained\nno record of any agreement that the parties would not be filing expert\nevidence. The Tribunal’s e-mail of 4 April 2013 reads as follows:[note: 3] … 3)    [Triulzi]\nrequests that [Xinyi’s] expert witness report be excluded on the\nground that during the case management conference, the parties had indicated\nto the Tribunal that the parties will not be filing any expert witness statements. I would like to have [Xinyi’s] comments\non this bynoon tomorrow. I have looked\nat the brief minutes of the CMC, copies of which were forwarded\nto the parties on 13 December 2012. The minutes, short though they\nare, made no mention of any indication or understanding on the part\nof the parties not to include expect witness statements. … [emphasis in original) 32     On\n5 April 2013, Xinyi replied stating that it had never indicated\nat the CMC that it wouldnotfile\nany expert witness statements. There was no agreement between the\nparties to dispense with expert evidence. Besides, the Tribunal’s\nminutes did not record any agreement between the parties. Ms Koh’s\nposition was that the Tribunal’s reference to the “Filing of Witness\nStatements” in the Procedural Timetable meant that there was “no limit\nplaced on the type or number of witness statements to be filed”.[note: 4]She pointed\nout that, having elected not to call an expert, Triulzi had waived\nits right to do so and should not be permitted to file an expert\nwitness statement at that late a stage. Filing an expert witness\nstatement at that time would prejudice Xinyi as Triulzi would have\nhad the benefit of Dr Bao’s Report. However, if the Tribunal was\nminded to grant Triulzi an opportunity to file an expert witness\nstatement, then it should be filed within seven days. 33     Triulzi\nreplied on 5 April 2013. It maintained that there was an agreement\nbetween parties to dispense with expert evidence and that the agreement\nwas indicated to the Tribunal at the CMC. Triulzi repeated its request\nthat it be given time to inspect the washing machines and to thereafter\nfile an expert witness statement. 34     The\nTribunal thereafter issued directions on the same day which provided\nas follows:[note: 5] … (1)    The\nstatement of [Xinyi’s] expert (Dr Bao Yiwang) is admitted; (2)    [Triulzi] has until4pm\nof 15 April 2013to file its own expert witness statement\nand report, if it wishes to. [Xinyi] should give reasonable supervised\naccess to [Triulzi’s] expert to inspect the 2 glass-washing machines.\nInspection should of course be confined to these 2 machines under dispute\nand not extend to other units in the same or other premises. The Tribunal\nnotes that it took [Xinyi’s] own expert 4 hours to inspect on 16 March\n2013. (3)    The hearing dates (22–25 April 2013)\nwill not be vacated. … [emphasis in original] 12 to 16 April 2013 35     On\n12 April 2013, Triulzi wrote to the Tribunal complaining that the time\ngiven by the Tribunal for it to find an expert was “just too short”,\nand again raised the matter of vacating the hearing dates.[note: 6] 36     On\n16 April 2013, a hearing was convened for the Tribunal to give parties\nfurther directions. At that hearing, Triulzi disclosed an e-mail\nfrom one Jonathan Peter Wigg (“Mr Wigg”) whom it had intended to\ncall as an expert witness. In that e-mail, Mr Wigg stated that he\nwould only have been available from early June 2013 onwards. Triulzi\nalso disclosed an e-mail which advised that an application made\nin Italy for a visa to China should be submitted one month before\nthe date of travel.[note: 7] 37     Triulzi’s\nsecond attempt to vacate the evidential hearing in April was rejected\nby the Tribunal. In its e-mail dated 16 April 2013, the Tribunal directed,inter alia, that the hearing from 22 to\n25 April 2013 would proceed as stated in the Procedural Timetable.\nThe Tribunal also noted:[note: 8] … Counsel for [Triulzi] has asked the Tribunal\nto record his dissatisfaction at the Tribunal’s unwillingness to\nvacate the dates for the hearing. His main grounds are that … there\nwas an agreement between the parties at the CMC that no expert witness\nwould be called and in any event [Triulzi] was not given enough\ntime now by the Tribunal to engage its own expert, send him to China\nfor the inspection and come up with a report. The Tribunal overruled [Triulzi’s] submissions\nand if necessary will refer to them in more detail at a more appropriate\nstage. … 38     On\nthe same day, Xinyi wrote to the Tribunal expressing its disapproval\nof Triulzi’s conduct in relation to calling an expert witness.[note: 9]It said\nthat after the Tribunal’s decision on 5 April 2013, Triulzi did\nnot raise any issue with the Tribunal’s directions until 12 April\n2013 when Mr Shum wrote to the Tribunal stating that Triulzi did\nnot have enough time. Triulzi also did not contact Xinyi at all\nto arrange for an inspection at Xinyi’s factory premises.",
        "Conduct at the evidential hearing\non 25 April 2013": "39     At\nthe evidentiary hearing which began on 22 April 2013, Xinyi called two\nwitnesses of fact and Dr Bao. On the last day of hearing, 25 April\n2013, and before Triulzi’s last factual witness took the stand,\nMr Shum applied to the Tribunal to adduce the expert witness statement\nof one Dr Alberto Piombo (“Dr Piombo”). Dr Piombo’s expert evidence\npertained to the operation of the first and second washing machines\n(“Dr Piombo’s Report”). The date of the report was 22 April 2013\nand it coincided with the first day of the hearing. Mr Shum explained\nthat he only received Dr Piombo’s Report on the morning of 25 April\n2013. 40     Ms\nKoh objected to Mr Shum’s very late application to admit Dr Piombo\nReport after two undeniable events: (a) Triulzi had, by its own conduct,\nelected not to file an expert witness statement having missed the original\nand extended deadlines for doing so; and (b) Dr Bao had already testified.\nShe surmised that Dr Piombo’s Report would have been prepared with\nthe benefit of Dr Bao’s Report, including evidence given under cross-examination. 41     In\nresponse, Mr Shum explained that Triulzi had difficulties with the time\nframe of 10 days set by the Tribunal previously on 5 April 2013\nand wanted the Tribunal to hear further submissions on the admissibility\nof Dr Piombo’s Report now that it was in hand. He stated that if\nthe Tribunal were to admit Dr Piombo’s Report, then a further hearing\ncould be fixed for the cross-examination of Dr Piombo. As Dr Piombo\nwas not in attendance at the hearing on 25 April 2013, Mr Shum explained\nthat he would not be using Dr Piombo’s Report at the hearing on\n25 April 2013. Rather, he was bringing it up in order to have it\nplaced before the Tribunal in light of the fact that Xinyi had adduced\nexpert evidence at the hearing. He disagreed with Ms Koh’s contention\nthat Triulzi had elected not to call an expert. 42     After\nMr Shum’s confirmation that Dr Piombo was not present at the hearing,\nthe Tribunal remarked:[note: 10] Arbitrator:I think it’s a bit late in the day, you know, Mr Shum. We\nare at the last day of the arbitration.Mr Shum:Sure, sir, but as I explained earlier, if I could have adduced\nthis earlier, I would --Arbitrator:I didn’t say it was your fault, but clearly it was somebody’s\nfault, right, you know, that it’s adduced so late in the day.Mr Shum:Sure, sir. That’s my submissions.Arbitrator:Unless you can really come up with some compelling arguments,\nI will not admit it.Ms Shum:Sure.\nWe stand guided by the tribunal.   43     Critically,\nthe Tribunal’s view was that Mr Shum had not raised any compelling\narguments to persuade it to admit Dr Piombo’s Report. The evidentiary\nhearing hence continued without Dr Piombo’s Report being admitted.\nThe Tribunal subsequently rendered the Award in favour of Xinyi,\nand Triulzi now seeks to set it aside.",
        "Issue 1: Breach of an agreed\narbitral procedure": "44     Issue\n1 focuses on the Tribunal’s decision to admit Dr Bao’s Report (see\n[34] above). The contention here is that the Tribunal’s decision\nto admit Dr Bao’s Report was in breach of a procedural agreement\nto dispense with expert evidence and that the Award should therefore\nbe set aside pursuant to Art 34(2)(a)(iv)\nof the Model Law. In response, Xinyi maintains that there was no\nagreement to dispense with expert evidence. Thus, Triulzi’s criticisms\nof the Tribunal’s conduct of the arbitral proceedings, including\nthe Tribunal’s procedural orders and directions prior to 22 April\n20l3 (see [25]–[38] above) that related to the admission of Dr Bao’s\nReport, are unfounded.",
        "Relevant legal principles": "45     Before\nturning to the question whether there was, in existence, a procedural\nagreement between the parties, it is useful, at this juncture, to outline\nsome of the relevant general principles underlying the application\nof Art 34(2)(a)(iv) of the Model\nLaw with regard to a breach of an agreed arbitral procedure. Art\n34(2)(a)(iv) provides: Article\n34. Application for setting aside as exclusive recourse against arbitral\naward … (2)    An\narbitral award may be set aside by the court specified in Article\n6 only if: (a)    the\nparty making the application furnishes proof that: … (iv)   the\ncomposition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was\nnot in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such\nagreement was in conflict with a provision of this Law from which\nthe parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not\nin accordance with this Law; or … 46     I\nstart with the important features of party autonomy in international arbitration.\nThere are two aspects to this concept of party autonomy – the restricted\nrole of the courts in the arbitral process and the procedural freedom\nand flexibility enjoyed by the parties. Section 15A(1) of the IAA provides\nthat “a provision of rules of arbitration agreed to or adopted by\nthe parties … shall apply and be given effect, except to the extent\nthat such provision is inconsistent with a provision of the Model\nLaw or [Part II of the IAA] from which the parties cannot derogate.”\nArticle 19 of the Model Law reads: Article 19.\nDetermination of rules of procedure (1)    Subject to the provisions of this\nLaw, the parties are free to agree on the procedure to be followed\nby the arbitral tribunal in conducting the proceedings. (2)    Failing such agreement, the arbitral\ntribunal may, subject to the provisions of this Law, conduct the\narbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate. The power\nconferred upon the arbitral tribunal includes the power to determine\nthe admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence. This article undoubtedly\nreflects the principle of party autonomy in fixing the procedure\nto be adopted and followed by the arbitral tribunal. The parties\nhave the freedom and flexibility to determine the rules of procedure that\ngoverns the arbitration, and failing an agreement by the parties,\nthe arbitral tribunal is permitted to conduct the arbitration in\nsuch a manner as it considers appropriate. Notably, the parties’\nfreedom under Art 19(1) is subject to the mandatory,ienon-derogable, provisions in the Model\nLaw. One example of a mandatory provision is Art 18 of the Model\nLaw which prescribes the minimum procedural requirements of equality\nof treatment and natural justice (ie,\nreasonable opportunity to be heard and to present one’s own case). 47     In\nthe absence of any procedural agreement, Art 19(2) of the Model Law\ngives the arbitral tribunal wide procedural powers to determine\nthe applicable rules of evidence on admissibility, relevance, materiality\nand weight of any evidence. To this end, the power of the arbitral\ntribunal under Art 19(2) is discretionary and the arbitral tribunal\nis required to exercise its discretion within the confines of the\nmandatory provisions of Model Law and Part II of the IAA. 48     It\nfollows that within the boundaries of the minimum procedural requirements\nnoted in Art 18, parties are free to agree on the institutional rules\nthat govern the arbitration. This can happen prior to or subsequent\nto the commencement of the arbitration. The Arbitration was an ICC\ncase and it was governed by the ICC Rules 2012. Besides the freedom\nto choose the procedural rules for the conduct of the arbitration,\nother matters that parties are free to agree to may include the\nmatters mentioned inPT Perusahaan Gas Negara\n(Persero) TBK v + Joint Operation[2010] 4 SLR 672. In\nthat case, it was stated at [39] that the parties’ agreed procedure,\nin the context of arbitration, may relate to “timelines for submission\nof answers in response to the request for arbitration, the information\nrequired to be provided in the submissions, notification to the\nparties of the names of the members of the arbitral tribunal,etc.” 49     Arguably,\nan agreement to dispense with expert evidence may be regarded as\na procedural agreement. Once the parties have agreed upon the procedure\nto be adopted for the arbitration, the arbitral tribunal will be obliged\nto conduct the arbitration in accordance with the procedure agreed by\nthe parties. 50     An\naward may be set aside under Art 34(2)(a)(iv)\nof the Model Law if: (a) the award is not in accordance with the\nparties’ agreed procedure, unless the agreed procedure is in conflict\nwith a mandatory provision of the Model Law; or (b) the award is\n“not in accordance with this Law” (see [45] above). As stated, equality\nof treatment and natural justice prescribed in Art 18 are two of\nthe non-derogable minimum procedural requirements under the Model\nLaw as regards the procedural conduct of the arbitration. 51     On\nthe other hand, Article 34(2)(a)(iv)\nof the Model Law isnotengaged\nif the non-observance of either an agreed procedure (Art 19(1))\nor the minimum procedural requirements of Art 18 isnotdue\nto circumstances attributable to the arbitral tribunal but is derived\nfrom the applicant’s own doing. A helpful commentary that stresses\nthe same point is made in respect of the purpose of Art 18 in theUNCITRAL 2012 Digest of Case Law on the Model Law\non International Commercial Arbitration(United Nations,\n2012) (“the 2012 Digest”) at p 98, para 7: … The purpose of article 18 is to protect\na party from egregious and injudicious conduct by an arbitral tribunal,\nand it is not intended to protect a party from its own failures\nor strategic choices. … 52     Separately,\nArt 34(2)(a)(iv) is againnotengaged if the challenge to the award\nis against the arbitral tribunal’s procedural orders or directions which\nfall within the exclusive domain of the arbitral tribunal. As stated\ninSingapore International Arbitration: Law\n& Practice(David Joseph and David Foxton gen eds)\n(LexisNexis, 2014) (“SIA: Law & Practice”)\nat ch 6, para 4.1: Once the parties have agreed upon the procedure\nto be adopted for the arbitration and a tribunal has been appointed,\nthe way in which the matter will go forward including the decisions\nthat must be made over time as to the progress of the reference,\nare matters falling within the exclusive province of the arbitral\ntribunal. 53SIA: Law & Practicecontinues in the\nsame chapter at para 5.3 that if a party is dissatisfied with procedural\norders or directions, there is no right of recourse to set aside\nthe order or direction by the Singapore courts. There are two reasons\nfor this: … First, Article 5 of the Model Law provides\nthat “in matters governed by this Law, no court\nshall intervene except where so provided in this Law”,\nand as was noted in para 3, Article 19(2) provides that the tribunal\nmay conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate\n(subject to contrary agreement of the parties, and the to the terms\nof Model Law). Secondly, procedural orders are not an “award” within\nthe meaning of Article 34 of the Model Law or s 24 of the IAA, and\ntherefore cannot be set aside under those provisions. [emphasis\nin original] 54     I\nnow come to technical and minor breaches committed by an arbitral tribunal.\nIt cannot be the case that any breach of an agreed arbitral procedure,\neven that of a technical provision or minor formality, will invariably\nresult in an award being set aside. Most supervising courts inquire\ninto thematerialityof the procedural\nrequirements that was not complied with and the nature of the departures\nfrom the parties’ agreed arbitral procedures. The cases below (see\n[55]–[58]) illustrate the element of prejudice (whether procedural\nor substantive) that eventuates as a result of a violation of an\nagreed procedure to support the materiality of the breach. 55     InCompagnie des Bauxites de Guinee v Hammermills, Inc1992\nWL 122712 (DDC, 1992) (“Hammermills”),\nan application was brought under the Convention on the Recognition\nand Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (“the New York Convention”)\nas a defence to the confirmation of an award on,inter\nalia, the ground that the arbitral tribunal had breached\nthe agreed ICC procedure when rendering its award. The complaint\nwas that the arbitral tribunal had inserted into the award the amount\nof the legal costs to be assessed against a party after the draft\naward had been approved by the ICC Court. Although the United States\nDistrict Court held that this did not amount to a breach of the\nICC procedure, it also observed at [5] that: … The Court does not believe that section\n1(d) of Article V [of the New York Convention] was intended, as\nCBG argues, to permit reviewing courts to police every procedural\nruling made by the Arbitrator and to set aside the award ifanyviolation of ICC procedures is found.\nSuch an interpretation would directly conflict with the “pro-enforcement”\nbias of the [New York] Convention and its intention to remove obstacles\nto confirmation of arbitral awards. … Rather, the Court believes\nthat a more appropriate standard of review would be to set aside\nan award based on a procedural violation only if such violation\nworked substantial prejudice to the complaining party. … [emphasis\nin original] 56     This\npassage quoted above was approved in another US District Court decision\nofKarahaBodas\nCompany, LLC v Perusahaan PertambanganMinyak\nDan Gas Bumi Negara190 F Supp 2d 936 (SD Tex, 2001).\nIt was held at 945 that for a complaining party to succeed in an\napplication under Art V(1)(d) of\nthe New York Convention on the ground that the arbitral tribunal\ndeparted from the agreed arbitral procedure, it “must show that there\nis a violation of an arbitration agreement between the parties and\nthat the violation actually caused [that party] substantial prejudice\nin the arbitration.” In applying this principle, the United States\nDistrict Court inWilliams v National Football\nLeague2012 WL 2366636 (D Colo, 2012) confirmed an award\neven though it was rendered after a specified time limit agreed\nupon by the parties as the complaining party was not substantially prejudiced\nby the delay. 57     Although\nthe US decisions dealt with Art V(1)(d)\nof the New York Convention, the observations are relevant to an\napplication of Art 34(2)(a)(iv)\nof the Model Law since Art 34 of the Model Law was drafted to “align\nthe grounds for setting aside with the grounds for recognition and enforcement\nthat were listed in Article V of the New York Convention” (see Howard\nM Holtzmann and Joseph E Neuhaus,A Guide to\nthe UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration:\nLegislative History and Commentary(Kluwer Law and Taxation\nPublishers, 1989) (“Holtzmann and Neuhaus”)\nat p 912). It must be noted that the UNCITRAL Working Group on International\nContract Practices (“the Working Group”) had also discussed and\nrejected the suggestion to include additional grounds for setting\naside under Art 34 in favour of keeping to the scope delineated\nby Art V of the New York Convention. As stated by the Working Group\nin theReport of the Working Group on International Contract\nPractices on the Work of its Fifth Session(A/CN.9/233,\n28 March 1983) at para 187: That solution [to align Art 34(2)(a)(iv)\nof the Model Law with Art V of the New York Convention] would facilitate\ninternational commercial arbitration by enhancing predictability\nand expeditiousness and would go a long way towards establishing\na harmonized system of limited recourse against awards and their\nenforcement. It was [further] stated in support that the reasons\nset forth in article V of the New York Convention provided sufficient\nsafeguards, and that some of the grounds suggested as additions\nto the list were likely to fall under the public policy reason. 58     The\nQuébec Supreme Court has also adopted an approach similar to that\nof the US Courts in the context of a setting-aside application on\nthe ground that there was a violation of the agreed arbitral procedure.\nInHolding Tusculum BV v Louis Dreyfus Holding\nSAS[2008] QCCS 5904, it was argued that an award should\nbe set aside as the tribunal had revisited issues that have already\nbeen decided in breach of an implied term of the applicable arbitration\nprocedure. Articles 940.6 and 948 of the Code of Civil Procedure\n(chapter C-25) (Québec) required the Québec Supreme Court to take\ninto consideration the Model Law and New York Convention respectively\nwhen dealing with international arbitral awards. In this regard, the\nQuébec Supreme Court agreed with and cited at [129] the opinion\nof one, Fabien Gélinas, who was called by the applicant to provide\nexpert evidence as to matters of international commercial arbitration: The standard of a “material breach of procedure”\nor a breach that “presumably affected the award” and the requirement\nof prejudice,simpliciter, sufficient\nor substantial, have one thing in common: they all operate toavoid the trivialization of judicial review in cases\nof minor violation of the procedure… [emphasis in italics\nin original, emphasis added in bold] 59     I\nnow come to the supervising court’s discretionary powers under Art 34(2)\nof the Model Law. 60     Even\nthough the decisions above (at [55]–[58]) address the issue of prejudice\nwhen deciding whether to set aside an award, it is also clear that prejudice\nis not expressly stipulated to be a requirement for setting aside\nan award under Art 34(2)(a)(iv)\nof the Model Law. The issue of prejudice should instead be understood\nin the context of thediscretionarynature\nof the court’s power to set aside awards under Art 34(2). As stated\nin Gary B Born,International Commercial Arbitrationvol\n3 (Wolters Kluwer, 2nd Ed, 2014) at p 3177: It is equally clear that the grounds specified\nin Article 34(2) of the Model Law are permissive and discretionary,\nnot mandatory. That is, a courtmayannul an\naward if one or more of the Article 34(2) grounds are satisfied,\nbut the court is notmandatorily requiredto\nannul the award, even where one of these grounds applies. This is\nmade express by Article 34(2), which provides that an “awardmaybe set aside by the court … only if”\nspecified grounds are present. … [emphasis in original] Notably, the operative word which is found in the opening\nsentence of Art 34(2) of the Model Law is “may”, and this word underscores\nthe discretionary powers of the supervising court to refuse to set\naside an award even if there was a breach of the agreed procedure. 61     InGrand Pacific Holdings Ltd v Pacific China Holdings\nLtd (in liq) (No1)[2012]\n4 HKLRD 1 (“Grand Pacific”), the\nHong Kong Court of Appeal opined (obiter)\nthat the Hong Kong courts have a discretion to refuse to set aside\nan award even where a violation of Article 34(2)(a)\nis established. The Hong Kong Court of Appeal opined at [105] that\neven if the circumstances described in Art 34(2)(a)\nare established, “the Court may refuse to set aside the award if\nthe Court is satisfied that the arbitral tribunal could not have reached\na different conclusion.” Emphasis was once again placed on the word\n“may”. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, in upholding the decision\nof the Court of Appeal, did not disturb the latter’sobiter dictum. 62     Other\nModel Law jurisdictions like New Zealand and Australia have similarly\nrecognised the existence of the court’s discretion in a setting-aside application\n(see, for example,Downer-Hill Joint Venture\nv Government of Fiji[2005] 1 NZLR 554 at [103];Cargill International SA v Peabody Australia Mining\nLtd[2010] NSWSC 887 at [242]). Some national versions of\nthe Model Law go even further than the Model Law in providing specifically\nthat the power to annul an award is discretionary. For example, s 30\nof the Arbitration Act (c 55) (British Columbia) provides that where the\ncourt finds that the arbitrator has “committed an arbitral error”,\nbut that “the error consists of a defect in form or a technical\nirregularity,” the court may refuse to set aside the award where\n“refusal would not constitute a substantial wrong or miscarriage\nof justice”. 63     Most\nnotably, in the Singapore Court of Appeal decision ofCRW Joint Operation v PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero)\nTBK[2011] 4 SLR 305 (“CRW Joint\nOperation (CA)”), V K Rajah JA also observed in general terms\nat [100] that “the court may, in its discretion, decline to set\naside an arbitral award even though one of the prescribed grounds\nfor setting aside has been made out”. 64     Understood\nin the context of a general discretion, my view is that prejudice\nis a factor or element relevant to,rather\nthana legal requirement for the application of Art 34(2)(a)(iv) of the Model Law. In other words, prejudice\nis merely a relevant factor that the supervising court considers\nin deciding whether the breach in question is serious and, thus,\nwhether or not to exercise its discretionary power to set aside\nthe award for the breach. As the Hong Kong Court of Appeal observed\ninGrand Pacificat [105]: … How a court may exercise its discretion\nin any particular case will depend on the view it takes ofthe seriousness of the breach. Some breaches\nmay be so egregious that an award would be set asidealthough the result could not be different.\n[emphasis added] It can be gleaned from this passage that the Hong Kong Court\nof Appeal recognises that there may be certain instances where the\ncourt will nonetheless set aside an award despite the absence of\nprejudice. 65     Rajah\nJA inCRW Joint Operation (CA)at\n[100] observed that where prejudice was shown, the court ought not\nto exercise its discretion to refuse to set aside an award. As to\nwhether Rajah JA’s observation is ostensibly inconsistent with the\nHong Kong position just stated above, I do not think so. Depending\non the facts of the particular case at hand, it may be possible to\npresent the breach in question either in terms of prejudice or in\nterms of the seriousness of the breach. In my view, the singular\npoint to be derived from bothGrand PacificandCRW Joint Operation (CA)is that every\ncase is fact-sensitive and much depends on the circumstances of\neach case. I should also point out thatGrand\nPacificwas a decision on the case management powers\nof the arbitral tribunal, whereasCRW Joint\nOperation (CA)was not. 66     As\nseen from the discussion above, the inquiry in a setting-aside application\nin respect of Art 34(2)(a)(iv) should\nfocus on the materiality, or seriousness, of the procedural breach.\nFrom this perspective, an applicant wishing to set aside an award\nwould endeavour to show the materiality of the procedural requirements\nthat were not complied with. An applicant may do so by establishing\nthe fact that the applicant had been prejudiced, or was reasonably\nlikely to have been prejudiced, by the arbitrator’s conduct of the\narbitral proceedings, including his procedural directions and orders. However,\nthis does not mean that the setting-aside application would necessarily\nbe rebuffed in the event that he fails to establish prejudice although\nhe would have to advance alternative submissions to evince the materiality\nor seriousness of the breach. 67     Finally,\nI come to a separate principle that has general application to Triulzi’s\nchallenges brought under Art 34(2) in respect of all four issues identified\nin [17] above. This is the “second bite at the cherry argument” that\nwas frowned upon by the Court of Appeal inBLC\nand others v BLB and another[2014] 4 SLR 79 (“BLC v BLB”). In that case, the Court of\nAppeal cautioned in general terms against the use of the setting-aside\nprocedure to raise new arguments that were not previously before\nthe tribunal. The supervising court would also be wary of any attempts\nby a party to re-package or re-characterise its original case and\narguments that were previously advanced in the arbitration for the\npurpose of challenging the award. As the Court of Appeal observed\nat [53]: In considering whether an arbitrator has\naddressed his mind to an issue, however, the court must be wary\nof its natural inclination to be drawn to the various arguments\nin relation to the substantive merits of the underlying dispute\nbetween the parties. In the context of a setting aside application,\nit is crucial for the courts to recognise that these substantive\nmerits arebeyondits remit notwithstanding\nits natural inclinations. Put simply, there is no right of recourse\nto the courts where an arbitrator has simply made an error of law and/or\nfact.A fortiori, the courts should\nguard against attempts by a disgruntled party to fault an arbitrator\nfor failing to consider arguments or points which were never before\nhim.The setting aside application is not to\nbe abused by a party who, with the benefit of hindsight, wished\nhe had pleaded or presented his case in a different way before the\narbitrator. [emphasis added] Accordingly, a supervising court would not hesitate to scrutinise\nhow the parties had approached their case in the arbitration and,\nin particular, to review the respective issues and arguments that\nhad been put before the tribunal.",
        "Discussion and decision": "68     With\nthe principles set out above in mind, I now turn to consider Issue\n1 in the context of the following matters: (a)     The\nexistence of a procedural agreement to dispense with expert evidence; (b)     If\n(a) is established, whether there was a breach of the procedural\nagreement; and (c)     If\n(a) and (b) are established, whether the breach was so material that\nthe court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the\nAward. 69     Specifically,\nany inquiry into the materiality of the procedural requirements\nthat was not complied with and the nature of the departures from\nthe parties’ agreed arbitral procedures will be examined and tested\nin light of Triulzi’s allegation of prejudice eventuated by the\nTribunal’s conduct in the course of the arbitral proceedings including\nthe latter’s procedural orders and directions. The existence of a procedural\nagreement (1)   Alleged agreement\nreached at CMC 70     I\nnow turn to the alleged agreement to dispense with expert evidence. As\nI alluded to above (at [49]), an agreement to dispense with expert evidence\nmay be regarded as a procedural agreement. Triulzi maintains that there\nwas such an agreement and that the admission of Dr Bao’s Report amounted\nto a violation of this agreement. Conversely, Xinyi argues that there\nwas no such agreement to dispense with expert evidence . A resolution\nof this point in favour of Xinyi is enough on its own to defeat Triulzi’s\napplication to set aside the Award under Art 34(2)(a)(iv)\nof the Model Law on the ground that the “arbitral procedure was\nnot in accordance with the agreement of the parties”. 71     Mr\nShum’s letter dated 2 April 2013, which was addressed to the Tribunal,\nspecifically referred to an alleged agreement to exclude expert evidence\nthat was reached at the CMC. It alleged that Xingyi had, by its conduct,\nreneged on it. Mr Shum further wrote:[note: 11] However, [Xinyi] filed [its] Expert Report\nyesterday, taking [Triulzi] by surprise. [Xinyi] had apparently\nsent its expert to inspect the 1stand\n2ndUnit on 16 March 2013 in secret contrary\ntothe agreement reached at the case management\nconference. [emphasis added] 72     Mr\nShum’s subsequent letter addressed to the Tribunal dated 5 April 2013\nreads as follows:[note: 12] … We highlight that [Xinyi’s] disagreement\nthat the parties had indicated to the Tribunal that the parties\nwill not be filing any witness statements focused solely on the\nTribunal’s minutes of the case management conference on 11 December\n2012. [Xinyi] did not categorically deny that there was such agreement\nbetween the parties. We express shock at [Xinyi’s] conduct as we had\ndefinitely agreed with Wong Partnership that no expert witness would\nbe called (to minimize costs due to the amount in dispute then).\nWe maintain that the parties had indicated this to the Tribunal\nduring the conference. … 73     Finally,\nat Mr Shum’s request, the Tribunal recorded in its e-mail dated\n16 April 2013 the following matters:[note: 13] (a)     Mr\nShum’s dissatisfaction with the Tribunal’s unwillingness to vacate\nthe dates fixed for the hearing; and (b)     Mr\nShum’s allegation that “there was an agreement between the parties\nat the CMC that no expert witnesses would be called”. 74     In\nthis present challenge, Ms Mariella Triulzi (“MT”), a director of Triulzi,\nin her Reply Affidavit at para 9, deposed to Mr Shum’s telephone conversation\nwith Ms Koh prior to the CMC held on 11 December 2012. According\nto MT, during that telephone conversation, Mr Shum had proposed\nthat both sides should dispense with expert evidence in order to minimise\ncosts. This agreement, according to MT, was then communicated to\nthe Tribunal at the CMC. 75     The\nexistence of an agreement to dispense with expert evidence was categorically\nrejected by Mr Zhao Jinhui (“ZJ”), the in-house counsel of Xinyi.\nZJ maintained that no agreement to only file factual witness statements\nwas ever reached by the parties through their respective counsel either\nat the CMC held on 11 December 2012 or prior to that. 76     I\nmake two points in relation to the alleged telephone conversation mentioned\nabove (at [74]). First, I note that no contemporaneous telephone attendance\nnote was produced to prove the alleged telephone conversation between\ncounsel. Secondly, there was no mention of a telephone conversation\nin any of the contemporaneous written communications to the Tribunal.\nAs ZJ pointed out in his affidavit, the alleged telephone conversation\nsurfaced for the first time in MT’s Reply Affidavit. Triulzi’s contention\nall the while during the Arbitration was that the alleged agreement\nwas reached at the CMC and it cannot be afforded a “second bite at\nthe cherry” now by raising a fresh allegation that the Tribunal\nwas not informed of. 77     The\nTribunal confirmed that there was no record of the alleged agreement\nin the Tribunal’s minutes of the CMC (see [31] above). Notably, the\nsame minutes had been sent to the parties on 13 December 2012 and\nthe accuracy of the contents was never queried by Triulzi prior\nto 1 April 2013. This was neither raised to the Tribunal on 22 March\n2013 when parties sought an extension for the filing of witness\nstatements to 1 April 2013 (see above at [27]). 78     The\nevidence adduced by Triulzi therefore does not stand up to scrutiny.\nMr Tan was also aware of the weakness of the evidence to make good\nthe existence of an agreement reached in a telephone conversation between\nMr Shum and Ms Koh which was ostensibly communicated to the Tribunal\nat the CMC. He conceded that he was really relying on the Procedural\nTimetable to deduce the existence of the alleged agreement. (2)   Alleged agreement\nas evidenced by the Tribunal’s direction on “Filing of Witness Statements” 79     Mr\nTan argues that the Tribunal’s direction pertaining to the “Filing of\nWitness Statements” in the Procedural Timetable meant only factual witness\nstatements in light of the IBA Rules that both parties agreed to\nbe bound by on 11 December 2012. Xinyi disagrees and contends that\nthe direction on the “Filing of Witness Statements” in the Procedural\nTimetable was intended to encompass both factual and expert witness\nstatements. 80     I\nmake three points. First, Mr Tan’s argument goes further than the stated\nposition taken by Mr Shum during the course of the Arbitration.\nThe latter had previously based Triulzi’s case on the existence\nof an agreement to dispense with expert evidence that was reached\nat the CMC which was then communicated to the Tribunal. Mr Tan’s\nreliance on the IBA Rules to define the meaning of the direction\n“Filing of Witness Statements” was not argued before the Tribunal.\nIt was a new argument brought up for the first time in the present\nproceedings and, needless to say, is another attempt by Triulzi\nto have a “second bite at the cherry”. 81     Secondly,\nthe Tribunal could not have contemplated the adoption and operation\nof the IBA Rules when it issued its direction on the “Filing of Witness\nStatements” in the Procedural Timetable. Significantly, prior to\nthe CMC, the Tribunal prepared and circulated to the parties on\n10 December 2012 the Draft Procedural Timetable that provided a\ndeadline for the “Filing of Witness Statements”. This Draft Procedural\nTimetable was sent to the parties before the IBA Rules were raised\non 11 December 2012 at the CMC. As can be seen from the Tribunal’s\nminutes of the CMC, the parties had first discussed the Draft Procedural\nTimetable and made modifications to the proposed deadlines so as\nto accommodate the schedules of counsel before formalising the Procedural\nTimetable. The IBA Rules were raised by Mr Shumafterthe\ndirections for “Filing of Witness Statements” in the Procedural\nTimetable were finalised. In short, there was nothing to suggest that\nthe direction on the “Filing of Witness Statements” in the Procedural Timetable\nwas intended to mean anything different from what was initially intended\nby the Tribunal on 10 December 2012, and cannot be interpreted in\nlight of the IBA Rules which came after the finalisation of the\nProcedural Timetable. Triulzi’s reliance on the IBA Rules to interpret\nthe words “Filing of Witness Statements” in the Procedural Timetable\nis thus without merit. 82     Thirdly,\nMr Tan’s reliance on the direction on the “Filing of Witness Statements”\nin the Procedural Timetable to deduce the existence of an agreed\nprocedure to dispense with expert witness does not cohere with the nature\nof a procedural timetable under the ICC Rules 2012 and is rejected for\nthe reasons below. 83     Mr\nTan’s written submissions, taken to its logical conclusion, must mean\nthat the Procedural Timetable embodied the agreement as to arbitral procedure\nbetween the parties. However, this contention does not sit well with\nthe nature of the Tribunal’s procedural order, issued in the form\nof the Procedural Timetable, after the CMC. The CMC was held and\nthe Procedural Timetable was issued by the Tribunal in accordance\nwith Art 24 of the ICC Rules 2012 which states: Article 24:\nCase Management Conference and Procedural Timetable (1)    When drawing up the Terms of Reference\nor as soon as possible thereafter, the arbitral tribunal shall convene\na case management conference to consult the parties on procedural\nmeasures that may be adopted pursuant to Article 22(2). Such measures\nmay include one or more of the case management techniques described\nin Appendix IV. (2)    During or following such conference,\nthe arbitral tribunal shall establish the procedural timetable that\nit intends to follow for the conduct of the arbitration. The procedural\ntimetable and any modifications thereto shall be communicated to\nthe Court and the parties. (3)    To ensure continued effective case\nmanagement, the arbitral tribunal, after consulting the parties\nby means of a further case management conference or otherwise, may\nadopt further procedural measures or modify the procedural timetable. (4)    Case management conferences may be\nconducted through a meeting in person, by video conference, telephone\nor similar means of communication. In the absence of an agreement\nof the parties, the arbitral tribunal shall determine the means\nby which the conference will be conducted. The arbitral tribunal\nmay request the parties to submit case management proposals in advance\nof a case management conference and may request the attendance at\nany case management conference of the parties in person or through\nan internal representative. 84     It\nis clear from Art 24(2) of the ICC Rules 2012 that a procedural timetable\nis established by the arbitral tribunal and not by way of an agreement\nby the parties. Even though the arbitral tribunal is required to consult\nthe parties under Art 24(1), the directions formalised by the arbitral tribunal\nare its own procedural order. It is well within the arbitral tribunal’s power\nand discretion to accept or reject the views of the parties expressed during\na case management conference as regards establishing the procedural\ntimetable. Article 24(3) further empowers the arbitral tribunal to\nmodify the established procedural timetable without being bound\nby the views of the parties as well. The establishment of a procedural\ntimetable therefore falls under the arbitral tribunal’s exercise\nof its case management powers which will be discussed in greater\ndetail when dealing with Issue 2. 85     Since\nthe Procedural Timetable constitutes a procedural order issued by\nthe Tribunal, the direction on “Filing of Witness Statements” cannot\nbe characterised as an agreed procedure between the parties for\nthe purposes of a setting-aside application under Art 34(2)(a)(iv) of the Model Law. (3)   The Tribunal’s implicit\nacceptance that there was no agreement to dispense with expert evidence 86     I\nnow refer to the Tribunal’s directions on 5 April 2013 (see [34] above).\nMs Koh explained that the Tribunal considered the arguments of the\nparties in the exchanges of communication and must have implicitly agreed\nwith Xinyi that there was no agreement to dispense with expert evidence.\nShe elaborated that the Tribunal’s direction to admit Dr Bao’s Report\nsupports her position that the direction on the “Filing of Witness Statements”\nin the Procedural Timetable should be interpreted as allowing for\nthe filing of both factual and expert witness statements. 87     It\nis possible to construe the Tribunal’s directions on 5 April 2013\nin Ms Koh’s way. Since the Tribunal’s minutes did not record any\nagreement to dispense with expert evidence, and considering the\nfact that the criticisms of the Tribunal now raised by Mr Tan are\nnew, I see no reason to view the position taken by the Tribunal\ndifferently. Besides, Mr Tan’s criticisms simply do not stand up\nto analysis. Conclusion on the existence\nof the alleged procedural agreement 88     For\nthe reasons stated, there was no agreed procedure to dispense with\nexpert evidence. Triulzi’s application to set aside the award under Art 34(2)(a)(iv) of the Model Law on the ground\nthat the Award was not in accordance with the parties’ agreed arbitral\nprocedure is premised on the existence of an agreement to dispense\nwith expert evidence. This premise is not made out and the application\nfailsin limine.",
        "Other Matters": "89     Having\nreached the conclusion that there was no agreement to dispense with\nexpert evidence, it is not necessary to decide on the matters described\nabove (at [68(b)] and [68(c)]). However, I propose to discuss some\naspects of the matters raised in argument such as waiver and prejudice.\nThe discussions below are connected to Triulzi’s criticisms that Triulzi\nwas prejudiced from the fact that without its own expert’s witness statement,\nit was prevented from refuting the Tribunal’s reliance on Xinyi’s expert. Waiver of procedural irregularity 90     In\nrelation to Xinyi’s waiver argument, it relies on Art 39 of the\nICC Rules 2012. It argues that Triulzi is precluded from relying\non the IBA Rules to interpret the direction on the “Filing Witness\nStatements” in the Procedural Timetable since Triulzi failed to\nraise that issue with the Tribunal. As such, Triulzi had lost its\nright to object on the basis of the IBA Rules. 91     It\nis now appropriate to refer to Triulzi’s request to the Tribunal\nto record Triulzi’s dissatisfaction with the Tribunal’s procedural\ndirections issued on 16 April 2013 (see [37] above). Needless to\nsay, Triulzi’s insistence that the tribunal recorded its dissatisfaction\nwas nothing more than a precautionary attempt to state its objection\nat that time to overcome any argument that the right to complain\nhas been forgone by waiver. However, the objections recorded did\nnot cover the specific waiver argument that is discussed here. 92     Article\n39 of the ICC Rules 2012 Rules states: Article\n39. Waiver A party which proceeds with the arbitration without raising\nits objection to a failure to comply with any provision of the Rules,\nor of any other rules applicable to the proceedings, any direction\ngiven by the arbitral tribunal, or any requirement under the arbitration\nagreement relating to the constitution of the arbitral tribunal\nor the conduct of the proceedings, shall be deemed to have waived\nits right to object. 93     One\nof the objectives of Art 39 of the ICC Rules 2012 is to ensure that any\nobjection as to the conduct of the proceedings is made promptly.\nIf a party does not object, then it may well be deemed to have waived\nits right to object pursuant to Art 39. There is no need to waive\nin writing, although, as a matter of proof, an objection should\nbe in writing or recorded in the transcript. A bare objection without\nany substantiation may not avoid a waiver of a procedural right.\nAs stated in Michael W Bühler and Thomas H Webster,Handbook\nof ICC Arbitration: Commentary, Precedents, Materials(Sweet\n& Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2008) at para 33-27: If there are objections to the procedure,\ntheymust be identified and in general substantiated.\nIn theBombadiercase, the Respondent\nraised general procedural objections and the Tribunal on several\noccasions requested that the Respondent specify the procedural objectionsso that they could be dealt with. The\nRespondent failed to do so and eventually brought proceedings to annul\nthe Award. The Paris Court of Appeal rejected the request for annulment\nand noted in particular that: “Considering that in order to be heard\nin annulment proceeding, the grievance needs to have been invoked\nin front of the arbitral tribunal each time it was possible to do\nso; that this rule, which protects procedural loyalty and arbitral\nawards, would be rendered useless if it was enough to utter menaces\nand critics in front of the Tribunal, as shown by Bombardier, in\norder to keep its options open when the time has come, to isolate\nan element of the procedure and present it as a violation of the\nadversarial principle.” [emphasis added] 94     The\npassage quoted above is important. It emphasises the need to allow\nthe Tribunal to deal with the objections promptly and properly.\nIn order to do so, any party objecting to the procedural irregularity\nmust put forward the arguments which are available to it so as to\nallow the Tribunal an opportunity to consider them. This concern\nalso constitutes part of the purpose behind Art 39 of the ICC Rules\n2012 as stated in Jason Fry, Simon Greenberg and Francesca Mazza,The Secretariat’s Guide to ICC Arbitration(ICC,\n2012) at pp 418–419: Purpose.Article\n39 ensures that if a party fails to raise objections with respect to\nthe constitution of the arbitral tribunal or the conduct of the\nproceedings it will be deemed to have waived its right to object.\nThis is especially relevant with regard to any subsequent court\nproceedings.The provision is intended to force\nparties to raise any genuine procedural concerns promptly during\nthe arbitration, so that, where possible, the concern can be addressed\nimmediately and within the arbitration. This prevents\nparties from holding back any objections for use in a later attempt\nto attack the award. A party that proceeds with an arbitration without\nraising a procedural objection runs a serious risk that it will\nbe prevented (either by the Rules or relevant law) from relying\non any procedural issue in subsequent court proceedings to set aside\nor resist enforcement of an award. [emphasis added] The rationale is that a party should not be allowed to withhold\nany arguments that it could have made before the Tribunal but make\nit at a later stage in a setting-aside application in the event\nthat the arbitral award turns out to be unfavourable. 95     In\narguing for the exclusion of Dr Bao’s report, Mr Shum wrote in his letter\naddressed to the Tribunal dated 2 April 2013:[note: 14] … During the abovementioned case management\nconference, the parties had indicated to the Tribunal that the parties\nwill not be filing any expert statements. Consequently, the Procedural\nTimetable dated 11 December 2012 did not provide a timeline for\nexpert witness statements to be filed. We have also not been given\nany notice that [Xinyi] will be filing any expert witness statements. … 96     Apart\nfrom a bare assertion that the Procedural Timetable did not provide\nfor expert witness statements to be filed, Triulzi’s objections\ndid not mention, let alone rely on, the IBA Rules to draw the distinction\nmade in the IBA Rules between factual and expert witness statements.\nAs stated above (at [81]), the IBA Rules were adopted after the\nTribunal’s direction on the “Filing of Witness Statements” was made\nand there was no reliance placed on the IBA Rules to limit the direction\non the “Filing of Witness Statements” to the filing of only factual\nwitness statements. On the face of it, Triulzi’s failure to raise\nthis issue in relation to the IBA Rules in the Arbitration precluded\nit from making such a submission in this setting-aside application. 97     Even\nif waiver is not made out under Art 39 of ICC Rules 2012, the use\nof the IBA Rules to draw a distinction between factual witness statements\nand expert witness statements in order to ascribe a different meaning\nto the direction on the “Filing of Witness Statements” in the Procedural\nTimetable is plainly an afterthought. It is based onex post factoreasoning derived from facts\nthat were not before the Tribunal when it issued its procedural\ndirection on the “Filing of Witness Statements”. Admission of Dr Bao’s Report 98     Mr\nTan raises the question of prejudice in his submissions (see [23] above).\nFor the sake of argument, if there was a procedural agreement as alleged,\nit would then mean that expert evidence should have been excluded from\nthe arbitral hearing. Consequently, the examination of prejudice\nin the context of Xinyi’s breach of the parties’ agreed arbitral\nprocedure is really a question of whether the exclusion of expert\nwitness statements,ie, Dr Bao’s\nReport, would have made a reasonable difference to the Tribunal’s deliberation\n(seeLW Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San\nContractors Pte Ltd and another appeal[2013] 1 SLR 125\nat [54]). The alleged prejudice that eventuated as a result of the\nbreach must have a causal connection with the admission of Dr Bao’s\nReport. This question does not involve an inquiry into what would\nhave happened if Triulzi had been allowed to adduce its own expert\nevidence. 99     From\nthis perspective, Triulzi’s argument that there would be a real\nor likely difference to the Tribunal’s deliberation if it had been\nallowed to adduce its own expert evidence is not relevant to this\nissue of prejudice in the context of a setting-aside application\nunder Art 34(2)(a)(iv) of the Model\nLaw where the complaint relates to an alleged breach of an agreed arbitral\nprocedure. In this context, one is concerned with the right to have the\narbitration conducted in accordance with the agreed arbitral procedure. The\nscenario here is quite different from those cases where there is\nan alleged breach of natural justice which, in this case, would\nconcern Triulzi’s right to adduce its own expert witness statements\nthat flows from the right to be afforded a reasonable opportunity\nto present its case. That consideration is relevant in the context\nof Triulzi’s allegations of breach of natural justice which I shall\ndeal with when discussing Issue 2. 100    In\nconnection with this aspect of the application to set aside the Award\nunder Art 34(2)(a)(iv) of the Model\nLaw, the theoretical inquiry here (assuming that the admission of\nDr Bao’s Report was in breach of an agreed procedure) is whether\nan exclusion of Dr Bao’s Report would have reasonably made a difference\nto the deliberations of the Tribunal. I now turn to Dr Bao’s Report\nto examine how the Tribunal dealt with it in the Award. 101    Dr\nBao’s Report dealt with three issues that was considered by the Tribunal: (a)     Whether\nthere were design defects in the washing machines; (b)     Whether\nthe cleanliness of Xinyi’s facility affected the performance of\nthe washing machines; and (c)     Whether\na full 8-hour acceptance test should have been conducted by Xinyi\nfor the washing machines. 102    It\nis clear that as to the first issue, Dr Bao was not an expert in industrial\nwashing machines and the Tribunal treated Dr Bao’s opinion as a “matter\nof conjecture”.[note: 15]As for the second\nissue on the cleanliness of Xinyi’s facility, the Tribunal found\nthat Dr Bao’s opinion on the cleanliness of the facility was not\nsatisfactory since his inspection was conducted more than 21 months\nafter the washing quality issues arose. The Tribunal stated in [101]\nof the Award:[note: 16] Furthermore, Dr Bao’s conclusion that the\ncleanliness of the air at the Wuhu Facility was normal, did not\nassist the Tribunal in determining the cleanliness of the Wuhu Facility\nat the relevant time period when the washing quality issues were\nraised (December 2010 to May 2011), as Dr Bao’s inspection and observations\nwere made more than 21 months after the Claimant raised the alleged\nwashing quality issues. 103    In\nsummary, Dr Bao’s Report had no bearing on the Tribunal’s determination\nin respect of the first and second issues. As for the third issue,\nthe Tribunal agreed with Dr Bao that there was no need for Xinyi\nto conduct a full 8-hour acceptance test. Whilst Triulzi argues\nthat this is evidence of prejudice, it must be noted that in the\nsame paragraph of the Award where the Tribunal seemingly agreed\nwith Dr Bao on this point, the Tribunal further held:[note: 17] … [I]t is immaterial that [Xinyi] did not\ncarry out a full 8 hour acceptance test,given\nthe evidencethat there were several areas that did not\ncomply with the contract specifications within the period of time\nwhen the acceptance test was conducted from 7 to 12 May 2011. [emphasis\nadded] 104    This\nfinding of the Tribunal is significant for the reason that the final determination\nof the Tribunal in relation to Triulzi’s defence would not have\nbeen affected even if he disagreed with Dr Bao’s opinion on the\nthird issue. 105    For\nthe reasons stated, an exclusion of Dr Bao’s Report would not have\nreasonably made a difference to the deliberations of the Tribunal. There\nis consequently no reason to set aside the award even if such a procedural\nagreement excluding expert evidence existed.",
        "Issue 1A: Award was not in accordance\nwith Art 18 within the meaning of Art 34(2)(a)(iv)": "106    Mr\nTan’s fall-back argument is that the Award should be set aside under\nArt 34(2)(a)(iv) of the Model Law\nas it was not in accordance with Art 18 of the Model Law which sets\nout the non-derogable minimum procedural requirements as regards\nthe procedural conduct of an arbitration. In my view, Mr Tan’s fall-back\nargument does not assist Triulzi because the evidence in this case\npointed, at best, to a misunderstanding of the scope of the direction\non the “Filing of Witness Statements” or some other mistake on Triulzi’s\npart. Plainly, the non-filing of Triulzi’s expert evidence by 1\nApril 2013 was entirely its own fault, and Triulzi was in delay, even\nat that stage, in complying with the Tribunal’s direction on the\nFiling of Witness Statements. Furthermore, for the reasons explained\nbelow (at [110] to [116]), the Tribunal’s subsequent procedural\norders and directions cannot be relied upon as a ground for challenging\nthe eventual Award. In the circumstances of this case, Art 18 is\nnot engaged. I have already set out the purpose of Art 18 above\n(at [51]) which is about protecting a party from the arbitral tribunal’s\nconduct. It is certainly not intended to protect a party from its\nown “failures or strategic choices”. 107    It\nis now appropriate to set out Article 18 of the Model Law in full: Article\n18. Equal treatment of parties The parties shall be treated with equality and each party\nshall be given a full opportunity of presenting his case. 108    I\naccept that Art 18 of the Model Law, described as a key element\nof the “Magna Carta of Arbitral Procedure” in theAnalytical\nCommentary on Draft Textof a Model\nLaw on International Commercial Arbitration: Report of the Secretary\nGeneral(A/CN.9/264, 25 March 1985) (“Analytical Commentary”)\nat p 44, is a mandatory provision, and the breach of which would\nbe, as stated in Art 34(2)(a)(iv)\nof the Model Law, “in conflict with the provision of this Law” or\n“not in accordance with this Law”. Consequently, a breach of Art\n18 may give rise to a ground for setting aside an award under Art\n34(2)(a)(iv). 109    It\nmust be recognised however that Art 18 is worded with reference\nto the abstract notions of “equality” and “full opportunity”. As\nobserved byHoltzmann and Neuhausat\np 551: The terms of Article 18 were modelled on\nArticle 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Commission\nReport provides no authoritative guidelines to interpreting the\nterms “treated with equality” and “full opportunity of presenting\nhis case”; nor do the reports of the Working Group. It is submitted\nthat this may be because the delegates considered that the terms\nwere so well understood in all legal systems that comment was unnecessary\nand that detailed definitions might limit the flexible and broad approach\nneeded to ensure fairness in the wide variety of circumstances that must\nbe encountered in international arbitration. Therefore, the exact content of Art 18 that is engaged by\na complaint of a breach of Art 18 must depend upon the level of\nabstraction at which the complaint is described or characterised. 110    In\nthis case, Mr Tan argues that even without the alleged procedural agreement,\nthe Tribunal nonetheless violated Art 18 of the Model Law as Triulzi\nwas not treated equally compared with Xinyi. Mr Tan raises the point\nthat the Tribunal should have appreciated the fact that Triulzi\nwas under the mistaken belief that expert evidence was to be dispensed\nwith. In this regard, Xinyi had the benefit of the entire duration\nfrom 11 December 2012, after the CMC, to 1 April 2013, the deadline\nfor the “Filing of Witness Statements”, to produce an expert report\nwhereas Triulzi was effectively not afforded such an ample amount\nof time as the Tribunal only gave it a ten-day time period. The\ncrux of Mr Tan’s complaint is that only Xinyi, and not Triulzi,\npresented its expert evidence during the hearing from 22 to 25 April 2013. 111    I\nmake several points. First, the Tribunal’s decision to extend time\nby ten days for Triulzi to file its expert witness statement must\nnot be considered in isolation. I concluded that there was no agreement\nto dispense with expert evidence, and as such, Triulzi would have\nhad the same amount of time as Xinyi (11 December 2012 to 1 April\n2013) to prepare and file an expert witness statement. It is thus\nfanciful to now complain of inequality because the Tribunal gave\nTriulzi only ten days to prepare an expert report. Besides, it is\nrisible that Triulzi now complains of inequality when the perceived\ndisadvantage was occasioned by its own doing. The Tribunal’s decision\nto extend time by another ten days to file Triulzi’s expert witness\nstatement was decidedly made after taking into account parties’\narguments and a myriad of factors including the arbitral tribunal’s\nobligation to conduct the arbitration fairly and expeditiously.\nThe Tribunal had come to grips with Triulzi’s desire to inspect\nthe two washing machines, but it was not told why Triulzi needed\nfour weeks to inspect and another four weeks to prepare the expert\nreport when Xinyi took four hours to inspect the two washing machines.\nIn those circumstances, Triulzi’s contention relating to inequality\nmust be rejected on this point alone. 112    Secondly,\nthe term “equality” must be “interpreted reasonably in regulating\nthe procedural aspects of the arbitration” (seeHoltzmann\nand Neuhausat p 551). It cannot be the case that each\nparty must have the exact same amount of time afforded in relation\nto the production of an expert report. Article 18 does not require\nthe arbitral tribunal to ensure that both parties are treated identically.\nNotably, the principle of equality in Art 18 is about applyingsimilarstandards to all parties throughout\nthe arbitral process (see the 2012 Digest, p 97 at para 5). Furthermore,SIA: Law & Practicemake the following\ncomments at ch 6, paras 2.11–2.13 and 2.15: 2.11  The\nfirst requirement, that the parties be ‘treated with equality’,\nmeans that the parties are to be treated in equal fashion. This\ndoes not mean that the tribunal must treat the parties identically,\nbut it must accord them equal treatment in the procedure adopted\nfor the conduct of the reference. It seems that the requirement\nof equal treatment must be observed by the parties and the tribunal\nalike. 2.12  Nevertheless the principle of equal\ntreatment should not, it is suggested, be confused with that of\nmandating an exact equal amount of time or an equal number of pleadings,\nor speeches. Whilst such a procedure may be adopted in the discretion\nof the tribunal it is not mandated. … 2,13  The fundamental reason that equality\nof treatment does not mandate such an approach is that equality\nof treatment is ultimately considered together with a full opportunity\nto present its case. In other words, if a party is accorded a full\nopportunity to present its case including to comment upon the case\nadvanced against it, then it is suggested that a tribunal is not concerned\nwith whether or not an exactly equal time or an exact equal number\nof pleadings or speeches is accorded to each party. … 2.15  Yet\nfurther, it is even possible to express at the extremes a potential tension\nbetween the two concepts of equality of treatment and a full opportunity\nto present its case. Thus every tribunal is likely to make some provision\nfor a procedural timetable for the disposal of the matter in as reasonably\nexpeditious fashion as is permitted in all the circumstances. Such a\ntimetable will inevitably limit the amount of time given to each\nparty to prepare and present a case. Thus it frequently transpires\nthat one party or other applies to the tribunal for further permission\nto extend time or present further evidence out of time or an additional\nsubmissions. All will depend upon the circumstances of the particular\ncase; nonetheless a tribunal must balance the need to accord equality\nto the parties which will include adherence to the timetable applicable\nto each side to prepare and present its case and the requirement\nto accord each party a full opportunity to present its case. … 113    I\nnow refer to a German decision by the Oberlandesgericht Celle:8 Sch 3/01(2 October 2001) which was\ndiscussed by Dr Peter Binder,International\nCommercial Arbitration and Conciliation in UNCITRAL Model Law Jurisdictions(Sweet\n& Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2010) at pp 279–280: In this case the respondent alleged a violation\nof its right to be heard and the equal treatment of parties (art.18\nof the model Law) due to the fact that the arbitral tribunal had\nconducted the proceedings only in the Russian language, which the\nrespondent could not understand, this despite the fact that the contract\nitself was drafted in two languages. The Higher Regional Court Celle held\nthat the defendant had been givensufficient\npossibility to raise defencesbefore the arbitral tribunal.\nLacking any specific agreement of the parties to the contrary, it\nwas self-evident that the Russian Court of Arbitration would conduct\nthe arbitral proceedings in Russian. The court emphasised that it\nwas the defendant’s obligation to obtain assistance from an interpreter\nin order toparticipate fully in the proceedings.\n[emphasis added] As can be seen from this excerpt, the mere fact that there\nwas some “inequality” as a result of the fact that it was more convenient\nfor the applicant, who understood Russian, to participate in the\narbitration does not amount to a violation of Art 18. 114    Likewise\nthe commentary fromSIA: Law & Practiceabove\n(at [112]) recognises that the amount of time to be afforded to\na party cannot be based solely on the amount of time afforded to\nthe other party. Other circumstances may bear upon the judgment\nof the Tribunal. A relevant consideration is the conduct of the\nparties. The stage of the arbitral proceedings at the material time\nalso matters. 115    In\nthis regard, I note that in Triulzi’s letter dated 5 April 2013,\nMr Shum had only requested time for Triulzi to engage an expertto inspect the two washing machines at Xinyi’s facility\nand produce a report based on such an inspection. Obviously,\nthe Tribunal had relied on Triulzi’s submission that it only wanted\nto inspect the two machines at Xinyi’s facility. In this regard,\nthe Tribunal: (a) noted that Dr Bao took four hours to inspect the machines;\nand (b) confined Triulzi’s inspection to the two washing machines\nand that its inspection should “not extend to other units in the same\npremises or other premises”.[note: 18]At the same time, the Tribunal\nwas mindful that the extension of time to file an expert witness\nstatement was being sought very close to the evidentiary hearing\ndates in April. In this regard, the Tribunal’s consideration of\nurgency in the conduct of the arbitral proceedings was a relevant\nfactor. Notably, the Tribunal must have regard: (a) to the fact\nthat Xinyi filed its expert witness statement on time on 1 April\n2013; and (b) to its obligation to get on with the arbitral proceedings\nwith reasonable expedition (see also [131]–[132] below). Seen against\nthis backdrop of circumstances, the Tribunal could not be said to have\ntreated Triulzi unequally. I also note that all these factors are\nalso relevant to the issue of whether Triulzi was afforded a reasonable opportunity\nto be heard and they will be discussed in greater detail when I deal\nwith Issue 2. 116    Lastly,\nit cannot be the case that Triulzi was treated unequally for the sole\nreason that Xinyi was the only party armed with expert evidence\nat the hearing. The Tribunal is only required to ensure that both\nTriulzi and Xinyi had an opportunity to submit expert evidence.\nIt is not required to ensure that both Triulzi and Xinyi made full\nand best use of such an opportunity. Triulzi cannot complain of\nits own failure to make use of the opportunity given to it by the\nTribunal. Triulzi’s complaint, in effect, is premised on it being\ndenied an opportunity to adduce expert evidence rather than the\nbare fact that it did not adduce such evidence at the hearing. From\nthis perspective, Triulzi’s main contention does not relate to equality\nof treatment under Art 18 of the Model Law and should be re-characterised\nas an allegation that it was not afforded a reasonable opportunity\nto present expert evidence. The question then is whether Triulzi\nwas afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard in the arbitration\nand this is raised by Triulzi under Issue 2.",
        "Issue 2: Breach of natural justice": "",
        "Criticisms of the Tribunal’s\nprocedural orders and directions": "117    Mr\nTan’s alternative argument to the agreed procedural breach point is\nfounded on s 24(b) of the IAA and\nArt 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Model Law. Issue\n2 is premised on three specific criticisms of the Tribunal’s procedural orders\nand directions that were said to have effectively denied Triulzi\na reasonable opportunity to present its own expert evidence. In\nparticular, Triulzi was prevented from advancing arguments before\nthe Tribunal that the subject machines complied with the contractual\ntechnical specifications, and that any non-compliance was due to\nXinyi’s lack of maintenance and the very dirty environment of Xinyi’s\nfacility. Triulzi was further prevented from refuting the Tribunal’s\nreliance on Xinyi’s expert evidence in respect of the contractual\nrequirement to run the subject machines for 8 hours for the acceptance\ntest. Mr Tan also argues that, as a result of such procedural orders\nand directions, Triulzi was treated unequally as compared with Xinyi (this\ninequality point is already discussed above). The three procedural orders\nand directions are: (a)     The\ndirection on 5 April 2013 for Triulzi to file its expert witness\nstatement by 4pm on 15 April 2013; (b)     The\ndirection on 16 April 2013 refusing Triulzi’s application to vacate\nthe hearing dates; and (c)     The\nrefusal to admit Dr Piombo’s Report on 25 April 2013. 118    As\nI alluded to above (at [19]), Triulzi’s challenge is effectively\nagainst the procedural orders and directions made in the course\nof the arbitral proceedings rather than a challenge to the making\nof the Award. In this case, Triulzi has to persuade the court that\nthe Tribunal’s procedural decisions were, albeit a matter of case\nmanagement, amounted to a breach of natural justice (ie, the procedural nature of the right\nto be heard) as a result of which Triulzi’s rights are prejudiced\n(see s 24(b) of the IAA). Notably,\nthe accusations are not that the Tribunal had not dealt with all\nthe central issues of the dispute or that the Tribunal had dealt\nwith the issues without hearing the parties. Triulzi’s difficulty\nresides in establishing that Triulzi’s complaints arise from circumstances\nattributable to the Tribunal, or that the circumstances were not\na result of Triulzi’s own failures or choices (tactical or otherwise).\nIn the final analysis, the three procedural orders and directions\ncould not even be treated as evidence of the Tribunal’s culpability\nand this means that Triulzi’s criticisms of the Tribunal (see also\n[22]–[23] above) must fail. In my view, these criticisms were unfounded.",
        "Triulzi’s arguments": "119    In\nbrief, Triulzi’s allegations as part of its natural justice arguments are\nas follows: (a) that ten days to produce an expert report did not\nafford it a meaningful opportunity to file an expert report; and\nthat this short time extension was further compounded by (b) the\nTribunal’s rejection of Triulzi’s application to vacate the hearing\ndates and (c) its refusal to admit Dr Piombo’s Report which Triulzi\nhad attempted to file on the last day of the hearing. 120    Triulzi’s\nsubmits that the Tribunal’s procedural orders and directions described\nin [117(a)] and [117(b)] and the Tribunal’s decision described in [117(c)]\nviolated its right to be heard as embodied in Art 18 of the Model Law\nthat requires the arbitral tribunal to give each party “a full opportunity of\npresenting his case”. As a result of this violation of its right\nto be heard, Triulzi argues that the Award should be set aside under\ns 24(b) of the IAA and Art 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Model Law.",
        "Parties’ approach in OS 1114/2013": "121    Section\n24(b) of the IAA provides that: Court may\nset aside award 24.    Notwithstanding\nArticle 34(1) of the Model Law, the High Court may, in addition\nto the grounds set out in Article 34(2) of the Model Law, set aside the\naward of the arbitral tribunal if — … (b)    a\nbreach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with\nthe making of the award by which the rights of any party have been\nprejudiced. 122    Article\n34(2)(a)(ii) of the Model Law provides\nthat: Article\n34. Application for setting aside as exclusive recourse against arbitral\naward … (2)    An\narbitral award may be set aside by the court specified in article\n6 only if: (a)    the\nparty making the application furnishes proof that: … (ii)   the\nparty making the application was not given proper notice of the\nappointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was\notherwise unable to present his case; or … 123    Both\nparties drew no distinction between s 24(b)\nof the IAA and Art 34(2)(a)(ii)\nof the Model Law. Vinodh Coomaraswamy J inADG\nand another v ADI and another[2014] 3 SLR 481 (“ADG v ADI”) recognised at [118] that there\nis “no distinction between the right to be heard as an aspect of\nthe rules of natural justice under s 24 (b)\nof the IAA and as an aspect of being able to be heard within the\nmeaning of Article 34(2)(a)(ii).” 124    Furthermore,\nalthough Art 18 uses the word “full opportunity” to present one’s\ncase, both parties proceeded on the understanding that this only\nrequires the Tribunal to accord each party a “reasonable opportunity” to\npresent its case. Coomaraswamy J also held inADG\nv ADIat [105] that “full opportunity” to be heard as\nmandated by Art 18 is no different from a requirement to afford\na party a reasonable opportunity to be heard. There is in effect\nno need to rely on Art 18 since the principles there accord with\nthe principles of natural justice in both s 24(b)\nof the IAA and Art 34(2)(a)(ii) of\nthe Model Law. 125    I\ntherefore propose to deal with s 24(b)\nof the IAA and Art 34(2)(a)(ii) together\nsince both provisions involve a single inquiry as to whether Triulzi was\ndenied a reasonable opportunity to be heard (“the fair hearing rule”).\nIt is noteworthy that the content of the fair hearing rule can vary\ngreatly from case to case depending on the circumstances of each\ncase since what may be a breach in one context may not be a breach\nin another. At this juncture, it is useful to refer to the Queensland\nSupreme Court’s observations on procedural fairness in the decision\nofSugar Australia Pty Ltd v Mackay SugarLtd\n[2012] QSC 38 (“Sugar Australia”)\nat [33]: The question is whether the applicant was\ndeprived unfairly of an opportunity to put its case, by argument\nand if relevant by evidence, against the reasoning by which the\narbitrator had rejected the applicant’s case. The answer largely\nturns upon whether the applicant should reasonably have anticipated\nthat, without the arbitrator providing such an opportunity to the applicant,\nthe arbitrator might determine the dispute by that reasoning. InRe Association of Architects ex parte Municipal Officers\nAssociation, Gaudron J said: “As was pointed out by Deane J inSullivan v Department of Transport(1978)\n20 ALR 323 at 343, procedural fairness requires only that a party\nbe given ‘a reasonable opportunity to present his case’ and not that\nthe tribunal ensure ‘that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity\nto which he is entitled’. And it is always relevant to enquire whether\nthe party or his legal representative should reasonably have apprehended\nthat the issue was or might become a live issue: seeRe Building Workers’ Industrial Union of Australia;\nex parte Gallagher(1988) 62 ALJR 81 at 84; 76 ALR 353\nat 358.” 126    If\nTriulzi is able to establish that it was denied a reasonable opportunity\nto present its case, it must then establish how this denial bore upon\nthe adverse decision or in other words that it was prejudiced as\na result. At this juncture, it is appropriate to repeat here my\ncomments above (at [118]). Triulzi has to first and foremost show\nthat the Tribunal’s procedural orders and decisions were not a matter\nof case management, but a breach of natural justice (ie, the procedural nature of the right\nto be heard). Evidentially, were Triulzi’s complaints due to circumstances attributable\nto the Tribunal, or were the circumstances due to Triulzi’s own failures\nor choices (tactical or otherwise)?",
        "Case management powers of the\nTribunal": "127    Triulzi’s\ncomplaints revolved around the exercise of the Tribunal’s case management\npowers. The Tribunal’s discretion to determine procedure, in the\nabsence of agreement between the parties on such matters, is enshrined\nin Art 19 of the Model Law which is set out above (at [46]). 128    Furthermore,\nby adopting the ICC Rules 2012, the parties have also agreed to\ngrant the Tribunal broad and flexible case management powers. As\nstated in Art 22(2) of the ICC Rules 2012: Article 22:\nConduct of the Arbitration (1)    The arbitral tribunal and the parties\nshall make every effort to conduct the arbitration in an expeditious\nand cost-effective manner, having regard to the complexity and value\nof the dispute. (2)    In order to ensure effective case\nmanagement, the arbitral tribunal, after consulting the parties,\nmay adopt such procedural measures as it considers appropriate,\nprovided that they are not contrary to any agreement of the parties. … (4)    In\nall cases, the arbitral tribunal shall act fairly and impartially\nand ensure that each party has a reasonable opportunity to present\nits case. (5)    The parties undertake to comply with\nany order made by the arbitral tribunal. 129    A\nsimilarly broad and flexible authority is granted to the Tribunal\nto deal with evidence under Art 9(1) of the IBA Rules which the\nparties have also adopted: Article 9.\nAdmissibility and Assessment of Evidence (1)    The Arbitral Tribunal shall determine\nthe admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of evidence. 130    In\nthis regard, I refer to Tay Yong Kwang J’s description of the role\nof the Tribunal as the “master of his own procedure” with wide discretionary powers\ninAnwar Siraj v Ting Kang Chung[2003]\n3 SLR(R) 287 (“Anwar Siraj”) at\n[41]: The arbitrator is, subject to any procedure\notherwise agreed between the parties as applying to the arbitration\nin question, master of his own procedure and has a wide discretionary\npower to conduct the arbitration proceedings in the way he sees\nfit, so long as what he is doing is not manifestly unfair or contrary\nto natural justice. 131    This\npassage was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal inSoh Beng Tee & Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development\nPte Ltd[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“Soh\nBeng Tee”) at [60]. That the Tribunal is the master of\nhis own procedure is one of the foundational elements of the international\narbitral process. Nonetheless, as observed by Tay J, the arbitral\ntribunal’s case management powers are not without limits. The exercise\nof case management powers is subject to the rules of natural justice\nwhich includes the right to be heard. However, this right only encompasses\na reasonable opportunity to present one’s case, the fair hearing\nrule, which must be considered in light of other competing factors.\nFor instance, the Tribunal is also obligated under Art 22(1) of\nthe ICC Rules 2012 to “make every effort to conduct the arbitration\nin an expeditious and cost-effective manner, having regard to the\ncomplexity and value of the dispute.” Weight must be accorded to\n“the practical realities of the arbitral ecosystem such as promptness\nand price” (seeTMM Division Maritima SA de\nCV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd[2013] 4 SLR 972\nat [103]). 132    In\nthis regard, an arbitral tribunal exercising case management powers\nwill take into consideration a myriad of factors, including the arbitral\ntribunal’s obligation to conduct the arbitration fairly and expeditiously.\nThe supervisory role of the court over the Tribunal’s exercise of\nhis case management powers should therefore be “exercised with a\nlight hand” in the context of a challenge on the basis of the fair\nhearing rule (seeAnwar Sirajat\n[42]). 133    The\ndecision inGrand Pacificwhich\nI have discussed above (at [61]) in relation to Art 34(2)(a)(iv) is also relevant here. In that\ncase, the applicant also sought to set aside an arbitral award under\nArt 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Model Law\non the ground that it had been unable to present its case as a result\nof certain case management decisions taken by the tribunal. One\nof these decisions was a refusal to consider additional authorities\nwhich the applicant sought to rely on. The High Court set aside\nthe award but the decision was reversed by the Hong Kong Court of\nAppeal. In its decision at [68], the Hong Kong Court of Appeal emphasised\nthe broad and flexible case management powers of the arbitral tribunal: The learned Judge concluded at para.129\nthat the refusal to receive and consider the additional authorities\nprevented [the applicant] from presenting its case and therefore\na violation of art.34(2)(a)(ii) has been established. With respect,\nI cannot agree with Saunders J.I do not believe\nhe was entitled to interfere with a case management decision, which\nwas fully within the discretion of the [arbitral tribunal] to make.[emphasis\nadded] 134    The\nHong Kong Court of Appeal proceeded to highlight at [94] that in\nrelation to the exercise of the arbitral tribunal’s case management powers,\n“the conduct complained of must be sufficiently serious or egregious\nso that one could say a party has been denied due process.” In this regard,\nI note that this phrase was also considered by Coomaraswamy J inADG v ADIand I agree with his interpretation\nat [116]: … [The Hong Kong Court of Appeal] held\n[inGrand Pacific] … that before\na court finds that a party was unable to present its case within\nthe meaning of Article 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Model Law, “the conduct\ncomplained of must be sufficiently serious or egregious so that\none could say a party has been denied due process”. Although the\nterm “due process” originates in English law (see the Liberty of\nSubject Act 1354, still in force in England today), it is not a term\nof art in English, Singapore or indeed Hong Kong law. Read in context, the\nconcept of “due process” referred to by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal directs\nthe focus to the elemental or fundamental aspects of the right to\nbe heard rather than to its technical or incidental aspects. The\nviolation of that right which is necessary to amount to a party\nbeing “unable to be heard” must be a radical breach of that right\nwhich is “serious or egregious”, though not so radical that the\npublic policy grounds under Article 34(2)(b)(ii) are engaged. 135    With\nthese case management principles in mind, I now turn to examine\nwhether Triulzi is able to show that the Tribunal’s procedural decisions\nwere a breach of natural justice (ie,\nthe procedural nature of the right to be heard) and brought them\nwithin the ambit of s 24(b) of the\nIAA and Art 34(2)(a)(ii) of the\nModel Law. The direction on 5 April 2013\nfor Triulzi to file its expert witness statement by 4pm on 15 April\n2013 136    In\nconnection with this aspect of the application, the case management\npowers of the Tribunal need to be addressed in the context of five\nother matters. First, the Tribunal’s duty was to proceed with the conduct\nof the arbitration fairly and expeditiously. The history here is\nthat the parties were supposed to be ready for an evidentiary hearing\nstarting 22 April 2013; the hearing dates having been fixed since\n11 December 2012 in the Procedural Timetable. The Tribunal had also\ngiven notice to the parties on 13 December 2012 that it expected\nthe parties to strictly adhere to the Procedural Timetable (see\n[27] above). There was already a departure from the prescribed timeline\nfollowing a request by both parties to extend the deadline for the\n“Filing of Witness Statements” by a week to 1 April 2013. I also\nobserve that according to Art 30(1) of the ICC Rules 2012, the Tribunal was\nrequired to render its final award six months from the Terms of Reference,ie28 May 2013, and this also contributed\nto the urgency of the matter. It does not matter that the Tribunal\nhad in fact issued the Award after 28 May 2013 as what is important\nis that the Tribunal was concerned with this deadline when it issued\nits procedural orders and directions. Considering all those factors\nat play, and in light of Art 22 of the ICC Rules 2012 which requires\nthe Tribunal to conduct matters expeditiously, the Tribunal, on\nlearning of Triulzi’s application to vacate the April hearing dates\non the basis that it required a total of eight weeks to inspect\nand file its expert witness statement, was quite entitled to conclude\nthat in those circumstances, it was better for the hearing to proceed\non the dates fixed and grant a time extension of ten days to Triulzi\nfor it to file an expert witness statement. It seems to me that\nthe Tribunal had, within its case management discretion, acted fairly\nand was entitled to conclude that proper case management of the\nArbitration required the April hearing to go ahead. 137    Secondly,\nI have already concluded that Triulzi’s excuse for not filing its\nexpert’s witness statement by 1 April 2013 was not credible. The\nfact of the matter is that Xinyi had in hand Dr Bao’s Report on\n1 April 2013 but Triulzi, on the other hand, despite having the\nsame amount of time as Xinyi, was without an expert witness statement.\nTriulzi’s predicament was created by its own doing and it did not\nmatter whether this was due to a mishap, mistake or misunderstanding\nthat it had an agreement with Xinyi. The suggestion that the Tribunal’s\ntime extension was not meaningful is symptomatic of Triulzi’s approach\nthroughout the entire Arbitration in that its own mistakes and misunderstandings\nshould not matter. As I see it, the Tribunal had conducted itself\nfairly in the face of a predicament that was entirely of Triulzi’s\nown doing. 138    Triulzi’s\npredicament was further compounded by what it had told the Tribunal\n– it wanted its expert to inspect the two washing machines in dispute.\nIt was also compounded by what it hadnottold\nthe Tribunal. Notably, the Tribunal’s decision to grant Triulzi\na time extension of ten days was set against the back drop of the\nfollowing matters: (a) the Tribunal was only told in a letter on\n5 April 2013 that Triulzi wanted its expert to inspect the two machines\nand to file an expert’s report on that matter; (b) the Tribunal\nwas neither told that the expert evidence would cover other aspects\nof the dispute nor was it told that it was Triulzi’s intention to instruct\na non-Chinese expert, and that Triulzi could face difficulties in relation\nto the availability of its expert and the visa application for its\nexpert; (c) the Tribunal observed that the length of time it took\nDr Bao to inspect the two machines was four hours; and (d) the scheduled\nhearing was less than three weeks away. Besides the time extension,\nthe Tribunal directed Xinyi to give Triulzi’s access to the two\nmachines in dispute so as to expedite matters. 139    Thirdly,\nwhen issuing procedural directions, an arbitral tribunal must consider\nthe interests of both parties (seeSanko Steamship\nCo Ltd v Shipping Corp of India and Selwyn and Clark (The Jhansi\nKi Rani)[1980] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 569). The Tribunal therefore\nhad to balance the interest of Xinyi to ensure that it was not inconvenienced\nfor what might be termed Triulzi’s “lapses” or, in a more charitable\nterm, “mishaps”. 140    Fourthly,\nthe parties were supposed to be ready for a hearing starting 22\nApril 2013, which hearing dates had been fixed since 11 December\n2012. Triulzi was not ready and wanted the hearing dates of 22 to\n25 April to be vacated. It must be remembered that: (a) the dispute\nover the alleged agreement to dispense with expert evidence arose\non 2 April 2013 which was less than 3 weeks before the start of\nthe scheduled hearing; and (b) Triulzi missed the deadline for filing\nan expert witness statement on 1 April 2013. It was, however, given\nanother opportunity to prepare an expert report and an additional\nten days was given after the Tribunal heard Triulzi’s application\nfor more time and vacation of the April hearing. 141    For\nthe reasons given, the Tribunal’s conduct is not capable of criticism\nwhatsoever. Triulzi’s complaints are misconceived. In my view, the\nTribunal had made its decision fairly in consideration of all points raised\nby Triulzi at that stage. It is not for the supervising court to\ninterfere in an entirely legitimate case management decision, and\none which was necessary in the light of the matters set out above. The direction on 16 April 2013\nrefusing Triulzi’s application to vacate the hearing dates 142    On\n12 April 2013, Triulzi wrote to the Tribunal to complain that the time\nextension of ten days for the Triulzi to file an expert’s report\nwas too short and invited the Tribunal to reconsider its decision\nnot to vacate the April hearing dates. By that time, seven of the\nten days afforded to Triulzi had passed. 143    In\nthat communication, Triulzi informed the Tribunal that its choice of\nexpert was not available. This formed the basis of Triulzi’s subsequent contention\nin OS 1114/2013 that it was not given a meaningful opportunity to\nfile an expert report. Triulzi relies on the fact that its first\nchoice expert, Mr Wigg, was only available from early June 2013\nonwards. It also relies on the fact that its Italian experts had\nto apply for a visa one month before travel to China. This would\nmean that it was impossible for either Mr Wigg or another Italian\nexpert to produce an expert report between 5 April 2013 and 15 April\n2013. 144    I\ncannot accept this argument criticising the Tribunal’s conduct on and\nprior to 16 April 2013. Bearing in mind what was said to the Tribunal\nat that stage, a reasonable opportunity to present Triulzi’s case\ndoes not equate to a reasonable opportunity to optimally presenteverythingthat it wants to present. Triulzi’s\ninability to engage either Mr Wigg or an Italian expert is not a\nbasis for finding that 10 days did not constitute a reasonable opportunity\nto file its expert report. Neither should Triulzi’s failure to reasonably\napprehend the new issues that were, or might have become, live issues\nconstitute a want of procedural fairness. 145    I\nhave already stated that the Tribunal was not told prior to the\n5 April 2013 decision that Triulzi wanted to engage Mr Wigg who\nwould need to apply for a visa to China. It was not Triulzi’s case\nthat it could not engage an expert that was already in China. Triulzi\nalso submits that aside from securing an expert, the ten days granted\nby the Tribunal was insufficient for it to: (a)     liaise\nwith Xinyi to ensure that the washing machines were available for\ninspection at Xinyi’s facility; and (b)     have\nthe expert prepare the report that not only deals with the issue\nof inherent design defects within the machine, but also the impact\nof the environmental conditions of the facility on the washing machines,\nthe adequacy of Xinyi’s maintenance of the machines and the interpretation\nof technical terms. 146    As\nregards point (a), the Tribunal had on 5 April 2013 directed Xinyi to\n“give reasonable supervised access to [Triulzi’s] expert to inspect\nthe 2 glass-washing machines.”[note: 19]It transpired that Triulzi\ndid not contact Xinyi and Ms Koh submits that Triulzi cannot complain\nof having insufficient time when its own behaviour shows that it\nwas not making full use of the ten days granted to it. I agree with\nMs Koh’s submissions. 147    On\npoint (b), Mr Shum’s letter dated 5 April 2013 and 12 April 2013 only\nrelated to the inspection of the two machines in dispute. Notably,\nMr Wigg was also only instructed to inspect the two machines in\ndispute, as seen in his e-mail to Triulzi dated 12 April 2013. Right\nthrough to the hearing on 16 April 2013, the complaint related to\ninsufficient time “to engage [an] expert witness, send him to China\nfor the inspection and come up with a report” as seen from the Tribunal’s\ne-mail of 16 April 2013 set out above (at [37]). Significantly,\nit is clear from the contemporaneous documentary evidence that in\nApril 2013, the Tribunal wasnottoldby Triulzi that it needed its expert\nnot only for the inspection of the two machines, but also for the\nenvironment of the facility and Xinyi’s maintenance regime. 148    Again,\nTriulzi’s complaint that the Tribunal’s time extension was not meaningful\nand it was not given an opportunity to present its own expert evidence\nthat covered other matters is again symptomatic of Triulzi’s approach\nthroughout the entire Arbitration. Triulzi seeks to criticise the Tribunal’s\nconduct for something that Triulzi itself had not seen fit to put before\nthe Tribunal for consideration. There is no explanation as to why\nthe Tribunal was not told on 16 April 2013 that Triulzi wanted its\nexpert to inspect the environmental conditions of Xinyi’s facility,\nXinyi’s maintenance regime, or for the expert report to deal with\nthe interpretation of technical terms. Triulzi’s stated position\nin April 2013 was that it wanted its expert to inspect the two machines\nonly and to file an expert statement on this, a position that is\nvery different from the one it is taking in OS 1114/2013. It plainly\nnow wants to have a “second bite at the cherry” having seen the\nTribunal’s findings and reasoning in the Award. In particular, the Tribunal\nrejected Triulzi’s factual witness evidence on these issues, and knowing\nthat, Triulzi, with the benefit of hindsight, now alleges that time should\nhave been given for it to prepare an expert report to buttress its factual\nwitness evidence on those issues. It is also noteworthy that the\nissue relating to the interpretation of technical terms, which was\nnot part of Triulzi’s original pleaded case, was only “brought up\nbelatedly at the hearing”[note: 20]by its factual witness.\nIt is highly unlikely that any expert report filed by Triulzi before\nthe hearing would have dealt with this issue in the first place. 149    FollowingBLC v BLB, this court should reject Triulzi’s\nattempts to re-package the original arguments that were previously\nadvanced in the Arbitration for the purpose of challenging the Award\non the ground that it was not given a reasonable opportunity to\nfile an expert report. 150    For\nthe reasons above, in my view, the Tribunal’s refusal to vacate\nthe April hearing dates and to go ahead with the April hearing was\na proper and legitimate case management decision. There is nothing\nto the contention that by refusing the application, the Tribunal\ndenied Triulzi its right to be heard. 151    I\nwould also add that the right of each party to be heard does not mean\nthat the Tribunal must “sacrifice all efficiency in order to accommodate\nunreasonable procedural demands by a party” (seeHoltzmann\nand Neuhausat p 551). The Tribunal was entitled to take\n“the view that Triulzi have had a chance to inspect the machines”\nwithin the ten days.[note: 21] 152    Lastly,\nI also agree with the observation in the passage fromSugar Australiaquoted above (at [125])\nthat procedural fairness requires only that a party be given “a\nreasonable opportunity to present his case” and not that the tribunal\nneeds to ensure “that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity\nto which he is entitled”. Here, the Tribunal did not have to ensure\nthat Triulzi took the best advantage of the ten days it was given.\nIt is obvious from the narrative above that it was Triulzi who has\nto take the blame for the predicament it faced. The decision refusing the admission\nof Dr Piombo’s Report on 25 April 2013 153    Triulzi’s\ncontention in this regard is that the Tribunal’s refusal of its application\nto admit Dr Piombo’s Report was a breach of natural justice. This\ncontention is baseless. It is quite clear from the transcripts that Triulzi’s\napplication to admit Dr Piombo’s Report was made on the last day of\nthe hearing and that Mr Shum could not satisfy the Tribunal that\nthere were compelling reasons for his very late application to admit\nit. The same points raised previously to persuade the Tribunal to\nvacate the April hearing were rehashed to persuade the Tribunal\nto admit Dr Piombo’s Report and for the hearing to be part heard.\nThis was Triulzi’s third attempt to stop the Arbitration having\nfailed twice to vacate the April hearing in order to buy more time\nto obtain expert evidence. 154    That\nDr Piombo was not at the hearing to take the stand meant that the\nArbitration must be definitely left part-heard if Dr Piombo’s Report\nwas admitted at such a late stage of the arbitral proceedings. His\nabsence was also not explained and his non-attendance was plausibly\nviewed as entirely of Triulzi’s own making and quite deliberate.\nBesides, there were no compelling arguments to satisfy the Tribunal\nthat Dr Piombo’s Report had to be admitted on the last day of the\nhearing (see [42] above). 155    It\nwould seem that Triulzi was once again adopting a tactical ploy\nto adjourn the hearing. In this regard, the observation made inAnalytical Commentaryat p 46 is apposite: “[F]ull opportunity of presenting one’s\ncase” does not entitle a party to obstruct the proceedings by dilatory\ntactics and, for example, present any objections, amendments, or\nevidence only on the eve of the award.” 156    It\nis difficult to see how, in those circumstances, the Tribunal could\nbe said to have been deserving of criticism in not admitting Dr\nPiombo’s Report. The Tribunal was justified in concluding that the\nright course was to go ahead to complete the hearing on 25 April\n2013. Taking everything together, Triulzi was indeed seeking to\nadmit evidence at the last day of the hearing and to have the proceedings\npart-heard. As stated, the absence of Dr Piombo at the hearing to\ntake the stand on 25 April 2013 was not explained. Furthermore,\nthere was no prior indication at all that Triulzi was still trying\nto admit expert evidence long after it failed to persuade the Tribunal\nto reconsider vacating the April hearing on 16 April 2013 and after\nit had missed the 15 April 2013 deadline for filing its expert witness statement.",
        "Conclusion on Triulzi’s right\nto be heard": "157    For\nthe reasons given above, I reject Triulzi’s criticisms of the conduct of\nthe Tribunal. Triulzi was not denied a reasonable opportunity to\nfile an expert witness statement and the Tribunal had also exercised\nhis case management powers reasonably and properly. I find that\nTriulzi’s application to set aside the arbitral award under s 24(b) of the IAA and Art 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Model Law must fail.",
        "Prejudice": "158    For\nthe sake of completeness, I will comment on the issue of prejudice on\nthe assumption that there was a breach of a natural justice. 159    Triulzi\nargues that an expert report which dealt with the environmental\nconditions at Xinyi’s facility, Xinyi’s maintenance of the washing\nmachines and the interpretation of technical terms could have reasonably\nmade a difference to the Tribunal’s deliberations. I have observed\nabove (at [147]–[148]) that Triulzi’s contention that it would have dealt\nwith these issuesviaits expert\nreport is premised upon hindsight. Given what was said to the Tribunal\nin April 2013, Triulzi was not intending to file an expert report\ndealing with these issues at that time. As such, there would consequently\nbe no impact on the Tribunal’s deliberation since such material\nwould not even have been present before the Tribunal for its consideration.\nTriulzi is therefore unable to show that it suffered any prejudice\neven if I had found that there was a breach of natural justice.\nIts application to set aside the arbitral award under s 24(b) of the IAA and Art 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Model Law would have failed\non this basis as well.",
        "Issue 3: Breach of public policy": "160    On\nIssue 3, Mr Tan submits that the Tribunal was obliged to apply as the\ngoverning law of the contracts the CISG which is an international\ntreaty that Singapore has signed and ratified. He argues that the\nAward which failed to apply the CISG is in conflict with Singapore’s\npublic policy. I proceed to deal with this final ground of setting\naside raised by Triulzi. 161    During\nthe CMC on 11 December 2012, a preliminary issue as to the applicable\nlaw to the three contracts was tabled for determination. According\nto the minutes of the CMC, the Tribunal heard oral submissions from\nboth parties and decided that the governing law for all three contracts was\nto be Singapore law. Mr Tan argues that the Tribunal did not apply\nthe CISG. He did not identify the relevant Articles in the CISG\nthat ought to have been applied by the Tribunal. I do not follow\nMr Tan’s point that the Tribunal did not apply CISG. First, as I\nunderstand it, there is domestic legislation in the form of the\nSale of Goods (United Nations Convention) Act (Cap 283A, 2013 Rev\nEd) (“International Sale of Goods Act”) giving effect to the CISG\nand when the Tribunal decided that the governing law was Singapore\nlaw, the Tribunal would be referring to the common law and statutes\nin force in Singapore, including the International Sale of Goods Act.\nSecondly, I observe from para [111] of the Award that the Tribunal\nhad actually made reference to the CISG and, contrary to Mr Tan’s\ncontention that the Tribunal did not apply the CISG, the Tribunal\napplied Art 35 of the CISG as to the requisite burden of proof.\nEven if there were other relevant Articles of the CISG that should\nhave been applied, Mr Tan did not identify them. In any event, even\nif the Tribunal did not consider other Articles of the CISG when\nit ought to, it has simply made an error of law and an error of\nlaw does not engage the public policy ground in Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Law (seePT AsuransiJasa\nIndonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA[2007] 1 SLR(R) 597\n(“PT Asuransi”) at [57]). 162    I\nmove on to Triulzi’s other argument that the failure of the Tribunal to\napply the CISG violates Singapore’s policy of upholding international obligations\n(since it has ratified the CISG) and should therefore be set aside pursuant\nto Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model\nLaw. Art 34(2)(b)(ii) allows the court\nto set aside the award if “the award is in conflict with the public policy”\nof Singapore. InPT Asuransi, the\nCourt of Appeal explained the operation of this ground of setting\naside at [59]: Although the concept of public policy of\nthe State is not defined in the Act or the Model Law, the general\nconsensus of judicial and expert opinion is that public policy under\nthe Act encompasses a narrow scope. In our view, it should only\noperate in instances where the upholding of an arbitral award would\n“shock the conscience” (seeDowner Connect([58]supra) at [136]), or is “clearly injurious\nto the public good or … wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable\nand fully informed member of the public” (seeDeutsche Schachbau\nv Shell International Petroleum Co Ltd[1987] 2 Lloyds’\nRep 246 at 254,perSir John Donaldson\nMR), or where it violates the forum’s most basic notion of morality\nand justice: seeParsons & Whittemore Overseas\nCo Inc v Societe Generale de L’Industrie du Papier (RAKTA)508\nF 2d 969 (2nd Cir, 1974) at 974. This would be consistent with the\nconcept of public policy that can be ascertained from the preparatory\nmaterials to the Model Law. As was highlighted in the Commission\nReport (A/40/17), at para 297 (referred to inA\nGuide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration:\nLegislative History and Commentaryby Howard M Holtzmann and\nJoseph E Neuhaus (Kluwer, 1989) at p 914): In discussing the term “public policy”,\nit was understood that it was not equivalent to the political stance\nor international policies of a State but comprised thefundamental notions and principles of justice…\nIt was understood that the term “public policy”, which was used\nin the 1958 New York Convention and many other treaties, covered\nfundamental principles of law and justice in substantive as well\nas procedural respects. Thus, instances such ascorruption,\nbribery or fraudand similar serious cases would constitute\na ground for setting aside. [emphasis added] It cannot be said that the Tribunal’s failure to apply the\nCISG “would shock the conscience”. It is also neither “clearly injurious\nto the public good or … wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable\nand fully informed member of the public” nor does it violate Singapore’s\n“most basic notion of morality and justice.” 163    Furthermore,\nwhat Triulzi is essentially saying is that upholding the Award amounts\nto a breach of Singapore’s international obligations and this has\nto fall within the domain of Singapore’s public policy in the wide sense.\nBut this is contrary to the view of the Court of Appeal inPT Asuransithat “public policy” in Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Law refers to Singapore’s\npublic policy in the narrow sense. Singapore has honoured its obligations\nas a signatory to the CISG by passing domestic legislation giving legal\neffect to the CISG. It is not surprising that Mr Tan cannot point\nto any legal basis that engages Singapore’s international public\npolicy to require this particular Tribunal or other arbitral tribunals,\nprivate institutions that are not bound by the CISG, to apply the\nCISG. Arbitral tribunals are first and foremost bound by the agreement\nof the parties which includes the agreed institutional rules. In\nthis case, Art 21(1) of the ICC Rules 2012 provides that: Article 21:\nApplicable Rules of Law (1)    The parties shall be free to agree\nupon the rules of law to be applied by the arbitral tribunal to\nthe merits of the dispute.In the absence of\nany such agreement, the arbitral tribunal shall apply the rules\nof law which it determines to be appropriate. [emphasis\nadded] 164    Given\nthat there is no choice of law agreement in any of the three contracts,\nit is therefore clearly within the Tribunal’s powers, granted to\nit by mutual consent of the parties, to determine Singapore law\nto be the governing law of the contract. There is no strict obligation\non the Tribunal to apply the CISG and it is entitled to prefer another\nrule of law which it “determines to be appropriate”. Triulzi, by\nagreeing to apply the ICC Rules, also agreed to have its dispute\nresolved in accordance with this rule of law determined by the Tribunal.\nIt cannot complain about the rule of law chosen by the Tribunal\neven if it disagrees with the Tribunal’s choice since it has agreed\nto be bound by the Tribunal’s choice. 165    For\nthese reasons, Triulzi’s application to set aside the award under Art 34(2)(b)(ii) also fails.",
        "Conclusion": "166    For\nthe reasons stated, Triulzi’s application in OS 1114/2013 is without\nmerit and must be refused. Accordingly, OS 1114/2013 is dismissed.\nThe evidential foundation of Triulzi’s complaints had nothing to do\nwith conduct of the Tribunal and the predicaments Triulzi faced\nwere entirely of its own doing. This was clearly reflected in the\nway it conducted its case in the Arbitration. In this application,\nTriulzi’s characterisation of its case as an award that was not\nin accordance with Art 18 in order to engage Art 34(2) of the Model\nLaw and s 24(b) of the IAA simply\nignores the evidential foundation of Triulzi’s complaints. Its public\npolicy argument is no better. Triulzi must bear the consequences\nof its own failures and choices (tactical or otherwise) that it\nmade at the Arbitration. 167    I\nwill hear parties on the costs of OS1114/2013. At the costs hearing, parties\nare to address me on whether or not the circumstances of the present\ncase favour an order for costs to be taxed on an indemnity basis.
