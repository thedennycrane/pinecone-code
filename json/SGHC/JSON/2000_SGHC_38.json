        "Introduction": "1.    On 21 April 1999, about 7.00am, T Maniam, a 55 year old\n\nretired police inspector from the Criminal Investigation Department (\"CID\") was\n\nset upon and battered to death outside his home at 86 Phoenix Garden. Three persons were\n\ncharged with his murder. Two of them are Indian nationals, aged 25. The first accused is\n\nLoganatha Venkatesan and the second accused is Chandran s/o Rajagopal. The third accused\n\nis Maniam’s widow, Julaiha Begum, aged 51. She was charged under section 302 read\n\nwith section 109 of the Penal Code for abetting Venkatesan, Chandran and other unknown\n\npersons in the murder.",
        "The Background": "2.    The domestic history of Maniam and Julaiha is relevant for a\n\nclearer understanding of the case of the prosecution as well as the defence.\n\nJulaiha’s first husband was one Abdul Kareem for whom she bore two sons and two\n\ndaughters. When they divorced in 1981 Julaiha took custody of the daughters, Sairah and\n\nFairos, as well as the second son. Abdul Kareem took custody of the elder son. At that\n\ntime Julaiha was living in a flat at Dover Crescent. Maniam came to know Julaiha about\n\nthis time and subsequently moved in to live with her. Sairah and Fairos were then about\n\nfive and eleven years old respectively. It can be gleaned from their testimonies that\n\nManiam brought them up very well, and they in turn, became utterly devoted to him. Maniam\n\nwas himself married at the time he moved into Julaiha’s flat. He later divorced his\n\nwife and married Julaiha in 1991. In the meantime, Julaiha sold the Dover Crescent flat\n\nand moved into a terrace house at Jurong Kechil which Maniam purchased in his sole name.\n\nIn 1993 Maniam sold that house and bought 86 Phoenix Garden with Julaiha as a joint owner.\n\nAccording to Fairos, the relationship between Maniam and Julaiha began to deteriorate in\n\n1993. The estrangement was slow and gradual, but its nadir (in October 1996 when Julaiha\n\nleft the matrimonial home) was frenzied and violent. From the accounts of Sairah and\n\nFairos, trouble brewed when the family took a holiday in India sometime in mid 1995.\n\nManiam and Fairos returned from the holiday as scheduled, but Julaiha and Saira were\n\nunable to return until some six months later owing to problems with the Indian\n\nauthorities, the details of which are not relevant for the purposes of this trial.\n\nAccording to Sairah and Fairos, however, Julaiha unjustifiably blamed Sairah for their\n\ndetention in India. Sairah was enrolled as a tertiary student in an Australian university\n\nat that time, and Maniam had to obtain a deferment of her studies until her return at the\n\nend of 1995.3.    It was in those unsettled times in 1996 that Julaiha first came to\n\nknow Venkatesan. He was then staying with other Indian nationals two houses away from\n\nManiam and Julaiha’s home, and about the middle of that year Venkatesan was engaged\n\nto fell a mango tree in 86 Phoenix Garden. Fairos recalled an incident when she returned\n\nhome unexpectedly one afternoon because her classes were cancelled. She saw Julaiha and\n\nVenkatesan sitting intimately on the family sofa. She also testified that on another\n\noccasion, she had seen Julaiha passing food to Venkatesan over the gate of their house.\n\nOne evening in October 1996, Maniam and Julaiha’s daughters caught her holding hands\n\nwith Venkatesan at nearby Teck Whye. A scuffle ensued between Maniam and Venkatesan.\n\nVenkatesan took out a private summons against Maniam for assault arising from that\n\nincident. The trial was held in 1998 in which Maniam, Sairah and Fairos were charged with\n\nassaulting Venkatesan. Julaiha testified on behalf of Venkatesan. The two girls were\n\nacquitted, but Maniam was convicted and fined $500. Not fully satisfied, Venkatesan\n\ncommenced a civil suit against Maniam which was still pending at the time Maniam was\n\nkilled. Also pending trial was a second private summons taken out by Venkatesan against\n\nManiam arising from a later incident in which Venkatesan alleged that Maniam had sent two\n\nmen to beat him up. There was to be a court hearing concerning that summons on Saturday 24\n\nApril 1999.4.    I revert to the Teck Whye incident. Venkatesan and Julaiha denied\n\nthat they were holding hands. They said that Julaiha met Venkatesan at a bus-stop at Teck\n\nWhye to collect some food which he had brought for her. The assault by Maniam on\n\nVenkatesan at Teck Whye took place in the evening. In the wee hours of the following\n\nmorning, Julaiha went to 86 Phoenix Garden to collect her belongings. She was accompanied\n\nby her friend Sellamal, Sellamal’s daughter, and son-in-law, Moghan Perisamy.\n\nThereafter, she moved out and lived with Venkatesan, first at Sellamal’s flat, then\n\nat Jurong, and finally at Tah Ching Road. The occasion when Julaiha returned to collect\n\nher belongings was not a peaceful episode. It is not clear where Venkatesan was when\n\nJulaiha went back to collect her things. One account had him lurking outside the house,\n\nanother that he was seen going up the stairs where he had another scuffle with Maniam.\n\nWhat was clear, from the testimony of Moghan Perisamy, was that Maniam refused to let him\n\n(\"Moghan\") enter the house, and a quarrel ensued between these two men. The\n\npolice arrived and advised Moghan and Sellamal to wait in the car while they escorted\n\nJulaiha when she collected her belongings. Evidence was adduced by the prosecution through\n\nSairah and Fairos that as Julaiha was leaving the house, she turned and threatened Maniam\n\nthat she would \"take care\" of him, in the ominous sense.5.    I pause at this juncture to consider a point of contention. The\n\nprosecution adduced evidence to show that Venkatesan and Julaiha were lovers. Moghan\n\nPerisamy himself saw them in a lovers’ embrace at the staircase outside\n\nSellamal’s flat sometime after October 1996. He questioned Julaiha about her\n\nrelationship with Venkatesan and she told him that they were lovers. Evidence of intimacy\n\nwere also adduced through Fairos and Sairah. It was also not disputed that Julaiha and\n\nVenkatesan lived together after Julaiha left her husband although it was clear that they\n\nrented separate rooms in the same flat at Tah Ching Road from a Malay family (who\n\nthemselves occupied the master bedroom of the flat). Whether Julaiha and Venkatesan were\n\nlovers is not a finding that I need to make. There is, however, sufficient evidence for me\n\nto conclude that they were bonded by a close and intimate friendship even if that\n\nrelationship fell short of an adulterous affair.6.    The period from October 1996 until 21 April 1999, when Maniam was\n\nkilled, was one in which Julaiha, Venkatesan, and Maniam waged war in the courts. They\n\nfought a private summons taken out by Venkatesan against Maniam, Sairah and Fairos for\n\nassault. There was also a pending civil suit over the same matter. Then, there was the\n\nprotection order which Maniam obtained on 3 April 1997 against Julaiha. There was a\n\ndispute in the High Court over the division of 86 Phoenix Garden in which, Judicial\n\nCommissioner Tay Yong Kwang made an order in November 1998 that the house be sold by June\n\n1999 with Julaiha being entitled to 20% of the proceeds and Maniam the remaining 80%.\n\nThere was also the private summons hearing in the subordinate courts scheduled for\n\nSaturday 24 April 1999. This concerned Venkatesan’s allegation that Maniam had\n\nprocured two men to assault him at Gul Road, Jurong.7.    About 7 o’clock on the Wednesday morning of 21 April 1999\n\nManiam left his house. He was walking to his car parked a short distance diagonally across\n\nthe front gate of his house. He was there set upon by two men and assaulted with blunt\n\ninstruments. The attack was swift and brutal. It might have been carried out in cold blood\n\nor with unfettered rage, but that is one facet of this case that is neither easy nor\n\nnecessary to determine. When the assault ended, however, Maniam lay dying on the pavement\n\noutside his neighbour’s house. The ambulance attendant Sim Lai Kiow from the Bukit\n\nTimah Fire Station pronounced him dead at 7.25 am. Dr Teo Eng Swee, a pathologist with the\n\nDepartment of Scientific Services, testified that Maniam died from severe injuries to his\n\nhead. In his opinion, there were at least four blows to the left side of the head, one to\n\nthe right side, and one to the neck. He found that the base of the skull was cracked from\n\near to ear. Part of Maniam’s right middle finger was amputated by a blow during the\n\nassault. This injury was described by Dr Teo as one of the various defensive injuries\n\nfound on Maniam’s hands and arms. No similar wounds were inflicted elsewhere on his\n\nbody. From this evidence, it appears to me that the assailants were aiming only at his\n\nhead with the intention of causing maximum damage.",
        "The Prosecution’s Case: The Conspiracy": "8.    The prosecution’s case is that Venkatesan and Chandran\n\nattacked Maniam and dealt him the mortal blows while another accomplice sat in their\n\nget-away truck. It is their case that the murder was commissioned by Julaiha who abetted\n\nthe crime by conspiracy. The evidence of the conspiracy was produced chiefly by the\n\ntestimony of Govindasamy Ravichandran. Ravichandran was a 28 year old fisherman from the\n\nvillage of Pudukuppam in Tamil Naidu, India. He had come to work in Singapore once before.\n\nHis second stint here began on 27 August 1997. He had known Venkatesan and Chandran from\n\nhis childhood days in Pudukuppam.9.    On the evening of 14 April 1999, which was the Tamil New Year,\n\nVenkatesan and Chandran looked for Ravichandran in a make-shift cinema where a group of\n\nIndian nationals were watching a film. After they had found him, they took him to a quiet\n\nspot at a block of flats in Geylang Avenue East. There, Venkatesan told Ravichandran that\n\nhe had a court case with Maniam which he (Venkatesan) was not likely to win, and so they\n\nhave to \"finish off that man (Maniam)\". Chandran added some details as well as\n\nan account of a previous attempt to finish Maniam. He told Ravichandran that in that\n\ninstance, Julaiha paid some men $15,000 but they did not do the job. The two male accused\n\nthen took Ravichandran by taxi to meet Julaiha at the void deck of her rented flat. After\n\nthey were introduced, Julaiha said to him, \"First [Venkatesan] came and then Chandran\n\ncame. I feel a little better. Now that you have come I am fully content. [Venkatesan] came\n\nto help me and got into this problem [so] finish that man\". Ravichandran testified\n\nthat he expressed some fear because he was married with a daughter, but Julaiha assured\n\nhim thus: \"Don’t worry about that. Don’t worry. I will pay you however much\n\nyou want. If you finish that man I will get the house. I will sell the house and we can go\n\nto India. You can trust me. I won’t cheat you.\" According to Ravichandran,\n\nJulaiha then gesticulated with her hands and added, \"Try to finish that man,\n\nRavi\". His evidence was that her words \"finish that man\" meant and was\n\nunderstood by him to mean \"murder\". Chandran and Ravichandran left Venkatesan\n\nand Julaiha at 2.30am (15 April) and went to a coffeeshop at Geylang.10.  Ravichandran testified that Chandran assured him that Julaiha \"was a\n\ngood woman and would pay\" once the deed was done. Ravichandran remained uncomfortable\n\nwith the idea of getting involved in murder. Nonetheless, he was brought along to Phoenix\n\nGarden several times. The first was merely a reconnaissance exercise to survey where\n\nManiam lived and where he parked his car. This was on the Thursday night 15 April itself.\n\nVenkatesan, Chandran and another man referred to by Venkatesan as the driver (later\n\nidentified as \"Mani\"), met Ravichandran about 10pm. At 11pm, after some drinks,\n\nVenkatesan suggested that they go to see where Maniam parked his car. The foursome went to\n\nPhoenix Garden by taxi. There they saw a car which Venkatesan identified as Maniam’s\n\ncar. He told them that Maniam works at Orchard Road and would leave his house at 6.30am\n\nand that he would be carrying a bag. He instructed them to park their vehicle under a\n\nnearby tree. He told them that Maniam might even die of a heart attack if they surprise\n\nhim when he opens the boot of his car. They were told that if he does not die from shock,\n\n\"beat him and finish him off\". After the reconnaissance the gang went to watch a\n\nfilm called \"Padaiappa\" at Sultan Plaza.11.    After the show, they went to the vicinity of the Sivan Temple at\n\nGeylang East. Venkatesan entered a nearby field and returned with a broad bladed knife\n\nknown in the Tamil language as an \"aruval\". Ravichandran testified that\n\nhe subsequently saw thearuvalin the back of the pick-up truck. Venkatesan told\n\nthe rest of the gang that they will go to Maniam’s house in the morning. That would\n\nbe Friday, 16 April. He instructed Ravichandran to bring his work clothes so that he could\n\nchange into them and go to work after \"finishing off that man\". After collecting\n\nhis clothes Ravichandran met the rest of the gang at Chandran’s room. He saw another\n\nperson sleeping in the room at that time. He identified that person as Tamilvanan. The\n\ngang had some beer in the room. At 4am of 16 April Venkatesan said that he would go with\n\nMani to collect the pick-up truck while Ravichandran and Chandran wait at a nearby\n\nbus-stop. The four of them drove to Maniam’s house in the pick-up truck. They stopped\n\na short distance from the house, near a telephone booth. Venkatesan told them \"Try to\n\nfinish him off by today\"; to which Chandran replied, \"Yes, we will finish him by\n\ntoday\". Venkatesan then left in a taxi while the other three drove on in their truck\n\nto see if Maniam’s car was still there. Having done that, they returned to the\n\noriginal spot and waited. A short while later, they moved the truck nearer to\n\nManiam’s house. Chandran told Ravichandran that he was getting out to wait for Maniam\n\nand when he sees him he would signal to Ravichandran. On that signal Ravichandran was to\n\nbring an iron pipe, hitherto hidden under the seat in the truck, to Chandran. However,\n\nwhen Chandran eventually signaled him, Ravichandran became too frightened to carry out the\n\ntask as instructed. Instead, he took the iron pipe and walked away from Maniam.\n\nConsequently, that morning’s mission was aborted.12.    The party drove to a nearby park where Chandran hid the \"aruval\".\n\nHe then telephoned Venkatesan to tell him that the plan to finish Maniam had failed. He\n\npaid the driver $100, and the same amount to Ravichandran later on. Ravichandran went to\n\nthe doctor’s and did not report for work that day (Friday 16 April). He watched a\n\nmatinee before returning to his room and slept through to 17 April when he went to work.\n\nIt was this day that Ravichandran pondered over his participation in the conspiracy. He\n\nreminded himself that he was married and was soon to be a father. He could not go through\n\nwith his part in the plan. He decided that if he was called upon again he would cheat\n\nVenkatesan and Chandran of their money and abscond to India.13.    On the following day, 18 April (Sunday), Ravichandran met\n\nVenkatesan and Chandran on his way to his friend VJ Velu’s home. Venkatesan invited\n\nhim to meet Julaiha at her flat. Rajesh, the younger brother of Ravichandran was also\n\ninvited. So, at 3pm the four of them went to Julaiha’s flat (at Tah Ching Road). They\n\nwatched television and enjoyed snacks cooked by Julaiha. Venkatesan proudly displayed his\n\npaintings to Rajesh. These paintings were kept in Venkatesan’s room. The evidence of\n\nthis was clearly and amply supplied by Rajesh. The party ended about 7pm. The landlady\n\nJuliyah Bte Ramlee, told the court that about 7am that day, she went with her husband and\n\nson to the Waterfront City at Batam Island, and they were unaware that Julaiha had\n\nreceived visitors in their absence. Juliyah and her family returned to the flat the next\n\nday about 6pm. Meanwhile, still in the evening of Sunday 18 April, Ravichandran had\n\nreturned to his room to rest when Venkatesan and Chandran visited him at 11pm.\n\nRavichandran was told to follow them to Chandran’s room. He testified that on this\n\noccasion Venkatesan told him that he had to \"finish him [Maniam] off\". He also\n\ntestified that Venkatesan told him that he was getting some number plates for the van, and\n\nRavichandran was to run Maniam down and kill him with the van, adding \"If he still\n\ncould not be finished off, we should get off the van and assault him. He would surely\n\ndie\". These instructions were repeated to Mani. Mani had since absconded and is still\n\nat large. Ravichandran heard Venkatesan tell Mani that he had to be strong. Mani was also\n\ninstructed to change the number plates and run Maniam down with the van. Venkatesan then\n\nleft with Mani to get the number plates while Chandran and Ravichandran went to\n\nChandran’s room. At that time, Chandran’s room-mate Tamilvanan was also in the\n\nroom. When Venkatesan returned he brought the gang to Maniam’s house in a taxi just\n\nto check if Maniam was home. They saw Maniam’s car and concluded that he must be\n\nhome. It was now about 12.30am, Monday 19 April. Venkatesan then said that they should\n\nfinish him off \"today\". The gang of four returned to Chandran’s room to\n\nrest. They were awakened by Venkatesan at 4 am to make preparations for the planned\n\nassault on Maniam. On Venkatesan’s instructions Chandran handed three $1,000 notes to\n\nRavichandran. He told Ravichandran that he had only $3,000 with him, but after Maniam was\n\nfinished off he would get some more money from Julaiha. No mention was made as to how much\n\nmore he would be paid, but Chandran assured Ravichandran that he would get more from\n\nJulaiha. Although Ravichandran referred to a \"van\", it was clear that the\n\nvehicle actually used was a blue pick-up truck (henceforth referred to as \"the\n\ntruck\").14.    The four of them then traveled to Phoenix Garden in the truck,\n\narriving between 5.50am and 6am. When they were near Maniam’s house Venkatesan got\n\noff and left the scene in a taxi. Ravichandran then decided to delay the act by asking\n\nChandran to get beer from a coffeeshop nearby. They went and had some beer, and returned\n\nonly to find that Maniam’s car was gone. They contacted Venkatesan by telephone to\n\ntell him that the attempt failed. Excerpts from the conversation were provided by\n\nRavichandran and they indicated that both Venkatesan and Ravichandran were agitated, but\n\nfor obviously different reasons. Ravichandran returned to his room (at Geylang Lorong 25)\n\nand began to make plans to get back to India. He notified his employer by telephone. He\n\nalso sought assistance from the Ministry of Manpower for an expedited payment of his wages\n\nfrom the employer.15.    Ravichandran then met his friends Shanmugam and VJ Velu over\n\ndrinks at a coffeeshop. He confided in them that Venkatesan and Chandran wanted him to\n\nkill someone. He said that Shanmugam advised him not to get involved in that scheme.\n\nThrough the rest of the day Ravichandran continued his preparations to leave the country.\n\nAt 12.30am (now Tuesday 20 April) Mani came looking for Ravichandran to tell him that\n\nVenkatesan and Chandran were waiting for him at Chandran’s room (at 38D Changi Road).\n\nThey proceeded there. Tamilvanan, Chandran’s room-mate was asleep in the room. It is\n\nnot the prosecution’s case that Tamilvanan was a participant in the conspiracy. The\n\ngang of plotters slept until 4am when they were awakened by Venkatesan. About this time,\n\nRavichandran chanced upon Chandran’s wallet underneath his mattress when the latter\n\nhad gone to the toilet. He found $3,000 in it and promptly stole the money. Venkatesan,\n\nChandran and Ravichandran then took a taxi to Geylang Lorong 13. Venkatesan told them that\n\nhe would fetch Mani while Ravichandran gets a change of clothes. Ravichandran pretended to\n\nwalk back to his room, but soon turned around and proceeded to \"Tekka\" where he\n\ntook a meal. After that he was on his way to Lorong 30 where the transport from his\n\nemployer would normally pick up the workers, but he spotted Chandran so he went to the\n\nMass Rapid Transport (\"MRT\") station instead. He took an MRT train to his\n\nworkplace at Tuas to bid farewell to his Japanese supervisor. He was given $150 and a\n\nwatch as farewell gifts by the Japanese man. Thereafter, Ravichandran went to Shenton Way\n\nand bought a Singapore Airlines ticket for a flight back to Madras that same day. The\n\nticket was duly proved in court and the evidence of Ravichandran’s flight back to\n\nIndia was not challenged. The post-script to this episode was that Chandran’s mother\n\nbegan proceedings in the village to reclaim the $6,000 that he had taken from Chandran.\n\nRavichandran testified that he was subsequently questioned by the Singapore CID police\n\nofficers in India and decided to testify in Singapore because he wanted to tell the truth\n\nto dispel his fellow villagers’ belief that he had killed Maniam and run off with the\n\nmoney.",
        "Peer Mohamed And John Tan Tai Poh": "16.    Peer Mohamed s/o Mohamad Hassan is a supervisor at a transport\n\ncompany. He was introduced by his relative to Venkatesan sometime in February 1998. From\n\ntime to time, whenever he needed to find work, Venkatesan would call upon Peer Mohamed.\n\nPeer Mohamed first met Julaiha in July 1998 when she borrowed $2,500 from him. Sometime in\n\nMarch 1999 Julaiha asked him for a loan of $8,000 to $9,000. At first he said that he had\n\nno money. He relented after she cried over the telephone and told him that she needed the\n\nmoney to pay her lawyers. He then told her to give him a few days to raise the money. In\n\nthe meantime, he asked his friend John Tan Tai Poh, a property agent, to lend Julaiha\n\n$7,500. John Tan said that he did not know her, but he would be prepared to lend the money\n\nif Peer Mohamed accepts the loan as being made to him. Peer agreed and arranged for John\n\nTan to meet Julaiha on 7 April 1999. John Tan handed two cash cheques, one for $5,000 and\n\nthe other for $2,500 to Julaiha. Evidence was adduced from the banks that the cheques were\n\nencashed. It was not disputed by the defence that Julaiha encashed the two cheques and\n\ngave the total sum of $7,500 to Venkatesan. It was also not disputed that Venkatesan\n\nhanded $6,000 out of this sum to Chandran.",
        "Wednesday 21 April 1999 - The Day of Death": "17.    With Ravichandran gone, the plot had to be revised. Venkatesan\n\nbecame directly involved in the actual assault. Evidence of the attack was adduced through\n\nthe eye-witness accounts of three persons namely, Fairos; Aurea David, a maid; and\n\nGeraldine Tan Poh Choo, Aurea David’s employer. These witnesses saw the same event\n\nfrom different vantage points. Fairos testified that about 7am on the morning of 21 April\n\n1999 she heard some noises outside her bedroom window (Geraldine Tan’s house was\n\nacross the road). She looked out and saw two male Indians struggling with another man.\n\nThat man was wearing a long sleeved shirt whom she subsequently identified as Maniam, and\n\nwhom she referred to throughout her evidence as her father. One of the two assailants was\n\ntaller than the other by about a head. Both of them were wearing T-shirts and Bermuda\n\nshorts. It then occurred to her that the man in the long-sleeved shirt might be her\n\nfather. She ran to her sister’s room where she could see where Maniam parked his car.\n\nShe thought that if the car was not there the person could not have been her father.\n\nHowever, she saw that her father’s car was still there, so she ran back to her room.\n\nBy this time, she saw that her father was already on the ground and the assailants were\n\n\"kicking and stamping him\".18.    On 12 May 1999 Fairos was brought to a police identification\n\nparade in which she identified Venkatesan as the taller attacker and Chandran as the\n\nshorter one. She admitted that she did not have a clear look at their faces on the day of\n\nthe attack, but she was able to identify Venkatesan from the shape and built of the\n\nattacker. She informed the police when they began their investigations that one of the\n\nassailants was her mother’s boyfriend. She noted, however, that the man she saw was\n\nthinner than the Venkatesan she last saw in 1998 in court during one of the legal disputes\n\ninvolving Maniam, Julaiha and Venkatesan. She testified that she was able to identify what\n\nshe regarded as a distinct slouch belonging to Venkatesan. In the same parade, she\n\nidentified Chandran by asking that he turn his back to her. She then identified him by his\n\ndistinct hair-cut (which she described to be \"like a mushroom\").19.    Aurea David, the maid at 73 Phoenix Garden testified that she\n\nnoticed a blue truck parked outside her employer’s home about 5.40am on 21 April 1999\n\nwhen she started her day’s chores. She noticed that it was still there at 6.15am and\n\n6.55am. She said that she noticed two men in the truck. At 7am she heard a commotion\n\noutside the house. She looked out of a bedroom window and saw a male Indian swinging a\n\nlong pole at the head of another male Indian, whose \"head was covered with\n\nblood\". She was stunned by what she saw and sat on the bed silently in shock.20.    Geraldine Tan Poh Choo, alerted by her maid Aurea David that\n\nthere was a fight outside their home, looked out of her window and saw two male Indians\n\nrunning away from their front gate towards a blue pick-up truck. One was a head taller\n\nthan the other. Both were carrying an object in their hands. Geraldine Tan said that one\n\nof the objects looked like an axe, and the other a pole. She maintained this evidence\n\nagainst a strong cross-examination.21.    The prosecution adduced forensic evidence matching the blue paint\n\nfound on the rear bumper of Maniam’s car to that of the pick-up truck GJ 1993 S used\n\nby Mani, Venkatesan and Chandran in the attack. The broken plastic pieces found on the\n\nground near Maniam’s car also physically matched the broken plastic cover of the\n\nfront right signal light of the truck. Sarveshvaran Ratnasamy the owner of the truck\n\ntestified that he had loaned the truck to Chandran and Mani at the material time.",
        "Chandran’sVoir Dire": "22.    The prosecution sought to admit four statements made by Chandran\n\non 28 April 1999; one on 30 April 1999, one on 13 May 1999; and one on 21 May 1999. The\n\nfirst of the four 28 April statements was recorded by S/Sgt Guruthevan at 6.40 am and\n\ncompleted at 7.20 am at room #03-11, Criminal Investigation Department (\"CID\").\n\nThe second was the cautioned statement recorded under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure\n\nCode (\"CPC\"). The last two were recorded at the scene of the crime. Theses\n\nstatements were challenged by Chandran on the ground that they were not voluntary\n\nstatements. The basis for his challenge is as follows.23.    Chandran and his room-mate, Tamilvanan, were asleep in their\n\nrented room at Changi Road when they were awakened in the early hours of the morning on 28\n\nApril 1999. The police evidence that the raid was conducted about 5.30 am is not disputed.\n\nThe two men were handcuffed and led down the stairs and put in separate police vans in\n\nwhich they were driven to the CID. Chandran was the lone captive in his van. Four other\n\npersons, including Tamilvanan, were taken in another van. None of the others were charged\n\nwith Maniam’s murder. Chandran testified that when he was escorted down the stairs of\n\nhis rented room by S/Sgt Guruthevan, Tamilvanan was similarly escorted by other officers\n\njust behind him. The other three arrested persons were still upstairs in another room. He\n\nwas placed in a police van with S/Sgt Guruthevan and Sgt Suresh Muthusamy. SI Zainal\n\nAbidin was seated in the front passenger seat and S/Sgt Low Meng Tee was driving the van.\n\nChandran was questioned by S/Sgt Guruthevan in the van and was there abused with\n\nvulgarities and kicked in the groin by S/Sgt Guruthevan. Shortly after, he heard S/Sgt\n\nGuruthevan instructing S/Sgt Low to go to the Kallang Stadium. He was then taken to a\n\nplace which he neither knew nor recognize except to say that it looked like a park. There\n\nhe was asked to alight and told to run by S/Sgt Guruthevan. He did not. He was then kicked\n\nin the back, and had his face pressed downwards while S/Sgt Suresh kneed him in the\n\nabdomen. They stopped a few moments later when SI Zainal Abidin told them,\n\n\"Let’s go office\" (sic). In the van S/Sgt Guruthevan continued abusing\n\nChandran with vulgarities.24.    Chandran further testified that at a corridor on the third floor\n\nof the CID building he was surrounded by three Chinese officers, two of whom he identified\n\nas Insp Lim Song Chai and S/Sgt Saw Chong Teck. These officers kicked him. S/Sgt\n\nGuruthevan then asked him whether he wants to talk. At this point SI Zainal Abidin took\n\nout a photograph from the wallet seized from Chandran by S/Sgt Guruthevan. One of the\n\nChinese officers exclaimed, \"That’s Maniam’s photo!\" Then he was again\n\nassaulted by the officers so badly that he could not stand. He was once again pressed down\n\nand kicked. His will thus broken, he agreed to talk. A statement was recorded from him by\n\nS/Sgt Guruthevan with no one else present. After recording the statement, S/Sgt Guruthevan\n\nthen warned Chandran not to change the statement, telling him, \"You know what will\n\nhappen if you change the statement\".25.    The above account was repudiated by the police officers. This is\n\ntheir version. They raided 38-D Changi Road based on information that one of the\n\naccomplices in Maniam’s murder named Chandran can be found there. Chandran was\n\narrested in his room with Tamilvanan. When they realised that they had caught their man\n\n(Chandran), they brought Tamilvanan down to the van while S/Sgt Guruthevan and SI Zainal\n\nAbidin searched the room. They recovered Chandran’s wallet under a mattress. The\n\nwallet was handed to Chandran. After that he was handcuffed and escorted downstairs.\n\nHowever, as they approached the stairs Chandran shrugged his shoulders, a move interpreted\n\nby S/Sgt Guruthevan as an escape attempt. He was physically subdued by S/Sgt Guruthevan\n\nand SI Zainal Abidin. This escape attempt was described by SI Zainal Abidin’s arrest\n\nreport as a \"violent resistance\" to arrest, although from the oral evidence of\n\nthe officers it appears that there was hardly any violence. The officers say that the van\n\ncarrying Chandran was the first to leave Changi Road and the first to return to the CID.\n\nThey denied stoppingen route. The journey to CID was quiet and uneventful.26.    The incontrovertible evidence was that although Chandran told Dr\n\nNg Wai Chong that he was assaulted on his chest, abdomen, and back, no visible marks or\n\nsigns of assault were found on examination. Dr Ng reported, however, that there was\n\ntenderness at the upper left chest and right loin (back) region. I think that it is fair\n\nto say that an absence of signs of physical injury does not necessarily mean that no\n\nassault had taken place. The burden of proof is not on the accused. It is on the\n\nprosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the statement were given without threat,\n\ninducement, or promise.27.    The other main issue concerned the extra five kilometres\n\ntravelled by the van that took Chandran to the CID. The point was whether this arose from\n\nthe detour to \"Kallang Stadium\" or the park as Chandran described, or as the\n\nresult of the longer route taken by S/Sgt Low Meng Tee who drove the van. This point was\n\nclarified to some extent subsequently when the police adduced evidence of a test drive\n\nreplicating the route taken by S/Sgt Low and the result shows an extra five kilometres.\n\nHowever, a short detour from Changi to Kallang Stadium may be less than one kilometre, and\n\nthat may not be obvious from the subsequent exercise of tracing the route. Thus in\n\nassessing the evidence, this has to be borne in mind.28.    I think that Chandran was probably not assaulted by the officers,\n\nbut as I have said, that is not the test. On the evidence, I would give him the benefit of\n\nthe doubt. However, taking the nature and circumstances of the alleged assault as well as\n\nthe physical make-up and character of Chandran into consideration, I was of the view that\n\neven if he was so assaulted, the episode should have no further impact on his body, mind\n\nand will beyond 30 April 1999. I therefore admitted those statements he made to the police\n\nafter that date. The statements made on 28 and 30 April 1999 were accordingly rejected.\n\nThe following statements were admitted and marked as follows: P162 (a s121 CPC statement\n\nmade on 13 May 1999); P163; P165; P165A; P165B; and P165C (statements made at various\n\nplaces). I shall revert to the contents of these statements shortly.",
        "Events After 21 April 1999": "29.    Tamilvanan (Chandran’s room-mate at 38 D Changi Road)\n\ntestified that in the evening of 21 April Venkatesan came looking for Chandran who said to\n\nhim, \"Well, the problem was over\". He also heard Chandran asking Venkatesan for\n\nmoney, but Venkatesan said that Julaiha would give them the money in two days’ time.\n\nTamilvanan also testified that Venkatesan went to his room again the next day. Chandran\n\nagain asked for money and this time Venkatesan said that it would take another four or\n\nfive days to get it. During these two days Chandran continued sleeping in the same room.\n\nHe also told Tamilvanan that he intended to go back to India as soon as possible and was\n\nlooking for money from friends for that purpose. Venkatesan and Julaiha were arrested on\n\n24 April 1999 and subsequently, on 28 April 1999, Chandran was arrested together with\n\nTamilvanan in their rented room. The latter was subsequently released.30.    Juliyah Bte Ramlee, Venkatesan and Julaiha’s landlady\n\ntestified that about noon on 22 April 1999 Julaiha was talking to someone over the\n\ntelephone. She subsequently told Juliyah that she was talking to her lawyer. When she came\n\nout of her room she told Juliyah that the CID may be looking for her (Julaiha), and also\n\nfor Juliyah as she was the landlady. She told Juliyah that if she was asked, she should\n\ntell the CID that Venkatesan and herself (Julaiha) were having breakfast together on the\n\nmorning of 21 April 1999. Juliyah told her that if they did not do anything there was no\n\nneed to lie. However, Julaiha said that Venkatesan was a good person and that if they\n\nhelped him, one day he might help them in return. She then followed Juliyah around the\n\nflat pleading with her to lie to the CID. Juliyah finally agreed, and Julaiha thanked her\n\n\"many many times\" and told her that she was going to see her lawyer. She told\n\nJuliyah that since her husband was dead she wanted to ask her lawyer whether she would be\n\ngetting the house.31.    On 23 April 1999 Muhamad Rafi and one Loganathan Pavadaisamy\n\nvisited Venkatesan and Julaiha at the flat. Juliyah testified that she let in Muhamad\n\nRafi, but she does not know if anyone else was in the flat that day. Pavadaisamy is a\n\ncousin of Venkatesan. Venkatesan called him on 22 April to say that he was returning to\n\nIndia and wanted Pavadaisamy to be his attorney under a power of attorney to take care of\n\nhis affairs here when he is back in India. Pavadaisamy accompanied Venkatesan to his\n\nlawyer’s office in the morning of 23 April where a power of attorney was executed by\n\nVenkatesan. Muhamad Rafi joined them at Julaiha’s flat subsequently. Julaiha told\n\nPavadaisamy that she intended to send Venkatesan to India and asked him to help by\n\ncontributing $2,000. Pavadaisamy said that he did not have the money. Muhamad Rafi then\n\nsaid to him \"If you have the money, help. Give the money.\" Muhamad Rafi also\n\ntold him that if he (Pavadaisamy) lent the money, he (Muhamad Rafi) would repay him.\n\nMuhamad Rafi corroborated this evidence. He works as an office attendant at Price\n\nWaterhouse Coopers, earning $1,000 a month. He was a self-confessed rejected suitor of\n\nJulaiha, but was obviously still fond of her. He stopped courting her after Maniam started\n\nseeing her. However, in September 1998 he met her by chance and she told him her long and\n\nwoeful tale about Maniam and her daughters. He thus took pity on her and gave her\n\nprovisions and small sums of money from time to time. In February 1999 Julaiha asked him\n\nfor a loan of $5,000. He did not have the money. Nonetheless, he took a loan of $3,000\n\nfrom his insurers and added $1,000 of his savings to lend her $4,000. On 22 April 1999\n\nJulaiha called him and asked that he meet her at her lawyer’s office at Maxwell Road.\n\nHe met her at 6.30pm after his work. There he gave her $100 as she had no money.32.    Mohamad Rafi left Julaiha’s flat together with Pavadaisamy\n\nat 10.30pm on 23 April. Pavadaisamy also testified that when they were at the flat\n\nVenkatesan read the report of Maniam’s murder from the Tamil newspapers. Julaiha took\n\nthe papers from Venkatesan and after reading them, commented that her daughters had given\n\nthe wrong story to the press and she would give them her version the next day. Pavadaisamy\n\nthen asked her whether she was sad. She told him that she was not, and on the contrary,\n\nshe was happy. Pavadaisamy quoted Julaiha’s words, \"After this there will be no\n\nproblem. The house will come to me\". Julaiha’s version of her reply in this\n\nconversation was, \"Do you think I’m happy?\" I shall set out my findings\n\nshortly, but I should say at this point that I find Pavadaisamy’s evidence to be more\n\ntruthful.33.    On 24 April Muhamad Rafi called at Venkatesan’s\n\nlawyer’s office because Venkatesan wanted to give a power of attorney to him.\n\nVenkatesan and Muhamad Rafi were arrested at the lawyer’s office, and subsequently,\n\nMuhamad Rafi led the police to Juliyah’s flat where Julaiha was arrested.",
        "The Question Of Motive": "34.    There is no requirement that the prosecution must establish a\n\nmotive in order to succeed in proving murder because the law recognizes the difficulty of\n\nextracting that which lay in the deepest and most inaccessible recesses of the human mind.\n\nBut, motives and intention can sometimes be inferred from words and conduct. The presence\n\nof a motive strengthens the overall case of the prosecution, and by the same token, an\n\nabsence of motive serves as a warning to approach the evidence with added caution. Thus,\n\nmotive is not relevant to the charge, but is relevant to the case.35.    In this instance, the prosecution adduced evidence that Julaiha\n\nwas deeply concerned of being deprived of her house. The seed of her insecurity germinated\n\nfrom the time the Jalan Jurong Kechil was purchased. It grew although 86 Phoenix Garden\n\nwas purchased with her as a joint owner. The evidence shows that Julaiha believed herself\n\nto be entitled to at least a half share of the house, but when she commenced civil\n\nproceedings in the High Court (OS 5199 of 1997, later re-titled OS 627 of 1998) she stated\n\na claim for 80%. However, the court order made in November 1998 gave her only 20% of it.\n\nThe prosecution also called a lawyer, John Abraham, to testify that as far back as March\n\n1996 Julaiha was already fighting with Maniam for at least a half share in the house. She\n\nthen rejected Maniam’s offer to give her a 40% share of the house. In the course of\n\nhis evidence, he recounted that just before Julaiha stormed out of his office she said to\n\nhim in the Malay language, the words, \"I will wait till he dies. When he dies, I will\n\nget all\". Julaiha’s desire for a large share of the house is also evident from\n\nthe testimonies of Fairos and Sairah in which they described Julaiha’s unhappiness\n\nover the purchase of their previous house at Jalan Jurong Kechil in Maniam’s sole\n\nname. Juliyah, Julaiha’s landlady, also testified that Julaiha told her that 86\n\nPhoenix Garden was her house and that she wanted to get it back. She told Juliyah that\n\nwhen she does she would sell it and return to India. All this evidence, together with the\n\nevidence that Julaiha was getting increasingly impecunious after she left Maniam, and had\n\nto borrow money from time to time, inspired the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor, Mr\n\nAnandan, to submit that Julaiha had a strong motive in seeing to it that Maniam dies\n\nbecause it was her belief that when he does 86 Phoenix Garden will rightfully revert to\n\nher.36.    At the close of the prosecution case counsel for all three\n\naccused declined to make any submission. I called upon their defence as I was satisfied\n\nthat aprima faciecase has been made out. All three elected to give evidence.",
        "The Defence Of Venkatesan And Chandran": "37.    Venkatesan and Chandran put up a common defence. The first part\n\nof their defence denies any conspiracy with Julaiha to murder Maniam. The second part of\n\ntheir defence accepts that they were present at the time Maniam was killed, but it was\n\nMani, the missing third man, who killed Maniam. Their defence was that neither of them\n\nintended to assault Maniam and did not inflict any blow on him. Their defence was simply\n\nthat Mani acted on his own.38.    The reason why they went to seek Maniam on 21 April 1999 was\n\nnarrated as follows. Venkatesan’s father was ill in India, and he (Venkatesan) was in\n\nneed of money because his family was heavily in debt. Consequent upon Maniam’s\n\nconviction on a charge of assault, Venkatesan instituted civil proceedings claiming\n\ndamages against him. Venkatesan was anxious to recover payment and therefore enlisted the\n\naid of his friend Chandran. Chandran introduced someone he knew who might act as a\n\nmediator to negotiate a settlement for Maniam. This person was a man called Selvam. He was\n\nan Indian national who worked as an assistant to Chandran when he was working as a pipe\n\nfitter. Selvam introduced them to a person known only by the nickname of Meesai. Meesai\n\nwanted to be paid $10,000 to do the job and so Venkatesan lost interest in using him. A\n\nperson by the name of Mani overheard their conversation and he offered to help. He brought\n\nthem to meet someone else, but that person wanted to be paid half of whatever sum Maniam\n\nwere to pay Venkatesan.39.    Finally, they enlisted Ravichandran who was prepared to help.\n\nMani, it appears, lingered on to assist by being the driver for them. Ravichandran was to\n\ntalk to Maniam and ask for payment, but instead, according to Venkatesan and Chandran, he\n\n(Ravichandran) stole $6,000 from Chandran and fled the country. Venkatesan, Chandran, and\n\nMani decided that they could not rely on others and would do the job themselves. The\n\noriginal plan, according to Venkatesan, was to have Ravichandran speak to Maniam while\n\nChandran added support by saying a few good words on Venkatesan’s behalf. In the\n\nabsence of Ravichandran, Chandran was designated the main negotiator and Mani the driver\n\nbecame the supporting spokesman.40.    The common evidence of Venkatesan and Chandran was that on 21\n\nApril 1999 the trio arrived at Phoenix Garden shortly after 5.30am in the truck GJ 1993 S\n\ndriven by Mani. They parked near a tree and Venkatesan took over the driver’s seat.\n\nThey spotted Maniam leaving his house about 7am whereupon Venkatesan told the other two\n\nthat he will drive closer to Maniam. He stopped just behind Maniam’s parked car and\n\nChandran got out, followed by Mani. Chandran testified that when he approached Maniam he\n\nsaid to him, \"Sir, are you Maniam?\"; to which he received the curt and rude\n\nreply, \"Yes, so what?\". Apparently unruffled, Chandran proceeded to say his\n\npiece, \"Venkatesan’s father is sick in India and he would like to go to India to\n\nsee him. Give him some money which he claimed from you and send him off.\"\n\nManiam’s response was to abuse Chandran with vulgarities. Chandran alleged that\n\nManiam said, \"Youpundehfrom India. What do you think you are? I will pay you\n\nif you will get your mother and his mother to sleep with me!\" He then threw a bunch\n\nof keys and some newspapers at Chandran, saying at the same time, \"See what I am\n\ngoing to do to you.\" Maniam then turned and ran. Chandran claimed that he did not\n\nknow why Maniam ran, but as soon as he saw Maniam running he \"walked quickly\"\n\nbehind him while Mani came from the opposite direction and pushed Maniam to the ground.\n\nMani then hit Maniam two or three times with something that looked like a piece of wood.\n\nAll this while, Chandran was exhorting Mani to stop beating Maniam. Then, in fright, he\n\nran back to the front passenger seat of the truck, calling out to Mani, \"Get on to\n\nthe vehicle!\" Venkatesan started the vehicle and Mani got on the back of the truck as\n\nthe vehicle was moving off. Venkatesan stopped the truck just a short distance away, at a\n\nbend of the road, and asked Mani to take over the driver’s wheel. Venkatesan finally\n\ngot off at Choa Chu Kang Road and told the other two to go off by themselves. This was the\n\ntwo male accused persons’ short and simple account of what happened at Phoenix Garden\n\non the morning of 21 April.41.    In response to the evidence of the $6,000 from Julaiha which\n\nVenkatesan took and handed to Chandran, Venkatesan said that he gave the money to Chandran\n\nfor safekeeping as it was his intention to send the money to his family in India. Although\n\nChandran testified that he had given $3,000 of that sum to Ravichandran, Venkatesan was\n\nnot perturbed because as far as he was concerned, Chandran was answerable for the full\n\namount to him. I find Venkatesan’s evidence on this point to be utterly unconvincing.42.    Venkatesan steadfastly denied any amorous relationship between\n\nJulaiha and himself. He denied that Ravichandran and Rajesh had met Julaiha, a stand\n\nsupported by Julaiha and Chandran in their own testimonies. Both men also disputed\n\nRavichandran’s evidence that they made a trip to Phoenix Garden on 16 April with the\n\nview of killing Maniam that day. Ravichandran’s evidence was that he deliberately\n\nwalked away with the iron pipe instead of handing it to Chandran. The two male accused do\n\nnot challenge Ravichandran’s evidence that they went to Maniam’s house late in\n\nthe evening of 15 April, but they disputed Ravichandran’s stated reason for being\n\nthere. Chandran said that it was Ravichandran who was anxious to go and talk to Maniam and\n\nsuggested that they do it that night. Venkatesan was against the idea because it was late\n\nand Maniam might accuse them of trying to rob him. Instead, he said he would bring them\n\nthere to see the place; so they went in a taxi for that purpose. Venkatesan pointed out\n\nManiam’s house and the spot where he normally parked his car.43.    Chandran said that the next time Venkatesan and he met\n\nRavichandran was Sunday, 18 April. Ravichandran’s brother Rajesh joined them, and\n\nthey spent the afternoon at the Little India Arcade having drinks and enjoying themselves.\n\nThey disputed Ravichandran and Rajesh’s evidence that they spent the afternoon at\n\nJulaiha’s flat.",
        "Defence of Julaiha": "44.    Julaiha’s defence is an outright denial. She\n\ndenies that she had any motive to kill Maniam. She denies that she met Ravichandran or his\n\nbrother Rajesh; she denies any adulterous relationship with Venkatesan; She denies that\n\nshe had conspired with anyone to kill Maniam; she denies that she had raised money to pay\n\nRavichandran, Chandran, and Mani; she denies that she tried to set up an alibi defence for\n\nVenkatesan; and she denies that she sought to find financial assistance to enable\n\nVenkatesan to flee the country after the killing. Mr Selva Naidu, counsel for Julaiha,\n\nfocused the thrust of his defence on her behalf by attacking the credibility of\n\nRavichandran as a witness. The barrage began with a reminder that Ravichandran was a thief\n\nand a cheat; he stole $3,000 from Chandran, and fled with another $3,000 given to him in\n\nthe belief that he would, in consideration, negotiate with Maniam for the payment of\n\ncompensation to Venkatesan. There is no basis, however, to conclude that a thief and a\n\ncheat cannot provide reliable and truthful evidence. Mr Selva, further, submitted that\n\nRavichandran’s evidence is suspect because he was an accomplice. More importantly, he\n\nsubmitted that Ravichandran’s evidence is unreliable because he lied on several\n\noccasions. Counsel suggested that Ravichandran was not honest in his explanation as to why\n\nhe had used a different name – Govin Ravi (a shortened version of Govindasamy\n\nRavichandran) – in his previous passport. Mr Selva also pointed out that Ravichandran\n\nadmitted in the witness box that he had lied to the tribunal in India that he took $3,000\n\nfrom Chandran when, in fact, he took $6,000. Counsel stressed that Ravichandran testified\n\nthat when he was taken to Julaiha’s flat at Tah Ching Road he passed by a block\n\nnumbered 320, but in fact, no such block existed. Julaiha’s flat was in block 325.\n\nThe other blocks in the vicinity were numbered 321 to 330. Mr Selva also referred to\n\nRavichandran’s detailed account of what happened at Phoenix Garden on the morning of\n\n16 April 1999. In his statement during the Preliminary Inquiry, Ravichandran said that the\n\nattack was aborted after Chandran told the waiting gang that Maniam’s car had just\n\ndriven by. In court, Ravichandran added that after that remark they drove the truck nearer\n\nto Maniam’s house to check and found that his car was still there. Chandran then got\n\nout of the truck and instructed Ravichandran to take a metal rod underneath the passenger\n\nseat as soon as he (Chandran) gave the signal. However, when Chandran eventually gave the\n\nsignal Ravichandran lost confidence and walked away from Chandran. Mr Selva counted this\n\nadditional evidence as an embellishment and a lie.",
        "My Findings And Judgment": "45.    It is the high aim of a trial judge to seek the truth; but it\n\nis his duty to find the facts. That is why a trial is conducted under a large canopy of\n\nrules regulating evidence and procedure; to protect the court from evidence of dubious\n\npersuasion. Thus hearsay evidence is inadmissible, not because the truth cannot be found\n\nin it, but because such evidence is generally unreliable and unsafe, and therefore,\n\nirrelevant. The trial judge’s duty is to consider only that which is relevant, and\n\nthen attaching the appropriate weight to it. After which he must decide, whether on the\n\nwhole, the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt that each accused\n\nperson is guilty of the offence with which he or she is tried. The evidence in this trial\n\nwas comprehensively adduced through sixty-nine witnesses for the prosecution and three for\n\nthe defence. The events covered a period from 1989 to May 1999. A large portion of the\n\nevidence relates to the domestic history of Maniam and Julaiha. There is also a large\n\nportion that covered the conspiracy and the events that happened in the fortnight leading\n\nto the murder. Finally, there is a substantial portion that covers the murder and its\n\naftermath. I shall deal first with the case against Venkatesan and Chandran. The evidence\n\nagainst them comes mainly from Fairos, Geraldine Tan Poh Choo, and Aurea David. These\n\nthree witnessed an assault by two Indian men on a third. The two assailants were armed\n\nwith instruments resembling a pole and an axe respectively. One of the assailant was about\n\na head taller than the other; a fitting comparison of Venkatesan and the shorter Chandran.\n\nThe evidence of these three witnesses were challenged by Mr Lee and Mr Rajarh, counsel for\n\nVenkatesan and Chandran respectively. They argued that the evidence of these witnesses\n\nwere not identical and pointed out, for instance, that Aurea David saw only one male\n\nperson assaulting Maniam whereas Geraldine Tan saw two persons running away.46.    In my judgment, I do not think that these discrepancies\n\naffect the prosecution’s case. The witnesses were watching what was to them a\n\nhorrible scene, viewed from different angles, each recalling different aspects of a quick\n\nand traumatic event. Fairos’s identification of Venkatesan and Chandran at the police\n\nidentification parade was attacked by counsel as being unreliable. The incontrovertible\n\nfacts are that Fairos gave Venkatesan’s identity to the police even before he was\n\narrested, and both men accept that they were present at Phoenix Park at the material time.\n\nIt is to their story as to why they were there that I now turn.47.    Venkatesan and Chandran say that they went to Phoenix Garden\n\nin the early morning of 21 April 1999 only with the view of talking to Maniam and\n\npersuading him to pay compensation to Venkatesan. They had originally engaged Ravichandran\n\nto be the chief negotiator, backed by Chandran and Mani. When Ravichandran absconded with\n\ntheir money Chandran took over his place, supported only by Mani. Chandran barely managed\n\nto introduce himself when Maniam began to abuse him, and without warning or reason, Mani,\n\nthe hitherto bit-part player, began to assume a role of vast significance. He attacked\n\nManiam with a weapon which Chandran did not know he had carried, nor where it was taken\n\nfrom. Chandran pleaded in vain with Mani to stop the assault.48.    This account fails to persuade me that it could possibly be true.\n\nI do not believe that Mani, a stranger just two weeks previously, went berserk and\n\nattacked Maniam on his own accord. I am inclined to the view that the circumstances at the\n\ntime were such that the prevailing mood was hardly conducive to any amicable settlement,\n\nand certainly not one that was to be carried according to Venkatesan’s terms.\n\nFurther, on his own evidence (supported by Chandran and Ravichandran) he was afraid that\n\nthe very sight of him might invoke a hostile reaction by Maniam. That was why he did not\n\npresent himself in the early attempts to catch Maniam. He became directly involved, in my\n\nview, by necessity when his main hired killer backed out. It is an obvious paradox that\n\nVenkatesan who was afraid to show his face to Maniam then became (on his own evidence) the\n\ndriver of the truck who daringly drove right up to Maniam. It is also convenient at this\n\npoint to consider the forensic evidence that the broken plastic found at the scene\n\nindicated that the truck hit Maniam’s car in a front-to-rear collision. I find that\n\nthis is consistent with Mr Anandan’s submission that Maniam dashed his truck against\n\nManiam’s car to prevent the latter from escaping. Venkatesan gave no explanation of\n\nthis account during his evidence-in-chief, nor was he able to give a clear account under\n\ncross-examination.49.    I accept that all the persons who featured in Venkatesan’s\n\nplan were men with low education, especially the two male accused, but from the way they\n\ngave their evidence, I do not think that they were men of low intelligence. I do not\n\nbelieve that they had made a far more elaborate plan identifying Maniam and making sure\n\nthat they catch him before he gets to work, than they did in planning the substance of the\n\nnegotiation. Indeed, their evidence disclosed no plan whatsoever in this regard Chandran\n\ntestified that all he would say to Maniam was that \"Venkatesan’s father is ill\n\nin India, please pay him some money and send him on his way\". There was no discussion\n\nas to how much compensation they should ask for, or what should be a minimum acceptable\n\nsum. I am of the view that their story was a convenient lie to conceal the real purpose,\n\nwhich was to ambush Maniam and kill him. The intention to kill is manifested in the\n\nbrutality of the assault itself and also by the evidence of Ravichandran. It is inevitable\n\nthat Ravichandran’s evidence and his veracity must be compared with that of the\n\naccused persons. I now come to this aspect.50.    Reason and logic are by no means a complete and accurate device\n\nfor assessing the veracity of a witness or the truthfulness of his story. In evaluating\n\nthis element of the evidence, a judge should pay attention to the way the witness gave his\n\nevidence, and while taking that into account, not allow himself to be misled by any\n\ninnocuous quirk or mannerism of the witness. In this case, I find that Ravichandran spoke\n\nwith the assuredness that comes only from a person who has been where he said he has been,\n\nand done what he said he has done. His tale was detailed and complete. Wherever\n\ncorroboration was possible evidence was called. Thus, when he said that after the first\n\naborted attempt he visited a doctor at Boon Lay but was not given a medical certificate,\n\nevidence was adduced from the doctor and his clinic staff to verify that part of his\n\nevidence. Even the manager of the cinema at Sultan Plaza testified that during the\n\nmaterial time in mid-April 1999 his cinema was indeed screening the film,Padaiappa.\n\nWhen he referred to things said in the presence of Chandran’s room-mate Tamilvanan,\n\nTamilvanan corroborated that evidence. His evidence of the visit to Julaiha’s rented\n\nabode on Sunday, 18 April, was supported by Rajesh. I have no difficulty finding\n\nTamilvanan, notwithstanding his mild speech defect, and Rajesh, to be forthright and\n\ntruthful witnesses.51.    This is a convenient juncture for me to say that I find that all\n\nthe independent prosecution witnesses, varied as they are in their background and roles,\n\nto be forthright, accurate, and truthful. I hold this regard for Fairos and Sairah as\n\nwell, even though counsel for the defence criticized their evidence at length. Minor\n\ninconsistencies in recollection are unavoidable by dint of the fallibility of the human\n\nmind. Inconsistencies become significant only when they are sufficient to affect a finding\n\nof fact by the court. These two witnesses (Sairah and Fairos) gave their evidence very\n\nmuch like Ravichandran. They were firm; they were clear; and they were courageous. They do\n\nnot have the fondness, attachment or loyalty that one may fairly expect daughters to have\n\nfor their mother, but I believe that they were honest in their evidence. The substance of\n\ntheir evidence is not pleasant so far as they relate to Julaiha and Venkatesan, but I do\n\nnot detect any trace of vengeance or ill-will in their testimonies. It is also important\n\nto keep in mind that the most damning part of Fairos’s evidence was against\n\nVenkatesan and Chandran. The damning evidence against Julaiha came from Ravichandran. The\n\nevidence of Fairos and Sairah relating to Julaiha and Venkatesan were relevant only in\n\ntheir confirmation of the bitterness and hatred that Julaiha and Venkatesan had for\n\nManiam, but that was plain to see (even without Fairos’s and Sairah’s\n\ntestimonies) from the documented evidence of all the court proceedings that they fought,\n\nand were still fighting up to the day Maniam was killed. So far as Venkatesan and Chandran\n\nwere concerned, Fairos had a good view of them participating in the assault.52.    There are two other matters I had to consider in respect of the\n\ndefence of Venkatesan and Chandran. The first concerns the undisputed evidence that a\n\ncut-out photograph of Maniam was found in Chandran’s wallet when he was arrested.\n\nFound together with that photograph was a piece of paper with the registration numbers of\n\nManiam’s cars and motor-cycle. Chandran explained that the photograph was shown to\n\nMeesai, and subsequently handed to Chandran for safekeeping. No plausible explanation was\n\ngiven to account for the paper with Maniam’s car and motor-cycle numbers. Chandran\n\nonly said that he found it in his wallet but did not know how it got there. Venkatesan\n\nsaid that he recorded the vehicle numbers some time ago when he thought that Maniam was\n\nstalking him after a court hearing; but this does not explain why he should give that\n\npaper to Chandran. I do not accept the accounts of the two male accused concerning the\n\nphotograph and the vehicle numbers. Neither do I accept Julaiha’s supporting evidence\n\nthat when Venkatesan asked her for a photograph of Maniam she pointed to her drawer and\n\nasked him to help himself, and to replace the photograph in her drawer after he was done\n\nwith it. She claimed that she did not know whether he had put the photograph back. In my\n\nview, the photograph and vehicle numbers were given to Chandran for the purpose of\n\nidentifying Maniam for the kill.53.    The second matter relates to Chandran’s statements to the\n\npolice that had been admitted after thevoir dire. The main statement (P162) is a\n\ncontinuation of a statement recorded on an earlier date. A court that is asked to consider\n\npart of a statement without the benefit of what has been said previously must do so with\n\nextreme caution. In this case, I do not have the benefit of the statements recorded\n\nearlier to which references have been made in this statement. Furthermore, some of the\n\nincriminating parts of this statement are inconsistent with the evidence of the\n\neye-witnesses. They are also inconsistent with his evidence in court. The other statements\n\nwere short statements concerning the places where the alleged murder weapons were taken\n\nand subsequently discarded. No weapon was found and produced in court. Although I had\n\nadmitted these statements, in the course of considering the evidence, I am left with some\n\ndoubt as to the reliability of the said statements. I am, therefore, of the view that the\n\nstatements should not be given any weight.54.    On the totality of the evidence, I am satisfied that the\n\nprosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt that Venkatesan and Chandran had\n\ngone to Phoenix Garden on 21 April 1999 with the common intention of killing Maniam. I\n\nfind that both accused inflicted injuries on Maniam, but it is not necessary, under the\n\nlaw of common intention, for me to ascribe the fatal blow or blows to either of them.\n\nIndeed, under the law, so long as they shared the common intention to kill, they would be\n\nguilty of murder. I do not accept the evidence that it was Mani alone who attacked Maniam.\n\nI also find that the blows that landed on Maniam were delivered with the intention of\n\ncausing death. For completeness, I should record my finding that it is clear from the\n\nevidence of the pathologist, whose evidence I accept, that the wounds inflicted on Maniam\n\nwould in the ordinary course of nature result in death. Each of these three grounds in\n\nitself would be sufficient to return a verdict of murder. Thus, Venkatesan and Chandran\n\nhave committed the murder of Maniam three times over. Nothing that they have said in their\n\ndefence had raised any reasonable doubt in my mind in respect of the prosecution’s\n\ncase. Even the accused persons’ description of the events on the morning of 21 April\n\nvividly fits the picture of an ambush. I do not believe that the procedure they had\n\nadopted was for the purpose of carrying on a negotiation with Maniam.55.    The case against Julaiha is different. She was not a direct\n\nparticipant at the scene of death. The prosecution’s case is that she was an abettor.\n\nIt’s case against her is founded principally on the testimony of Ravichandran. I need\n\nnot repeat his evidence save to say that he had unequivocally said that Julaiha told him\n\nin the presence of Venkatesan and Chandran on 15 April 1999 to \"finish off that man\n\n(Maniam)\". Ravichandran was asked by the learned DPP what he understood by the words\n\n\"finish him off\" and he answered firmly, twice, that he understood the words to\n\nmean \"murder him\". In a subsequent part of his testimony, he also said that when\n\nVenkatesan spoke to him earlier at an open ground near the Sivan Temple, he too used the\n\nwords \"finish off that man\". Similarly, Ravichandran had no difficulty in\n\nunderstanding the words to mean ‘murder’. This part of his evidence was not\n\ndiscredited in any way during his cross-examination.56.    I accept Ravichandran’s evidence and am satisfied that he\n\nhad not misheard Julaiha, nor was there any miscommunication as to Julaiha’s\n\nintention. I cannot come to any other conclusion than that the words conveyed the meaning\n\nas understood by Ravichandran. Some other aspects of the conversation with Julaiha that\n\nday are also important in understanding the text and context of her instructions.\n\nAccording to Ravichandran, Julaiha sought to allay his misgivings about the proposed deed\n\nby telling him not to worry and that she would pay him however much he wanted, adding\n\nfurther that if he finishes off Maniam \"I would get the house. I will sell the house\n\nand we can all go to India\".57.    It is not the law that no one may be condemned to death solely on\n\nthe testimony of a lone witness, but the inherent danger of such reliance is obvious.\n\nCapital punishment is the supreme penalty; it is not amenable to abrogation or\n\ncompensation once the condemned is executed. In such cases, therefore, the court ought to\n\nremind itself that it must be fully satisfied with that evidence. In this instant, for the\n\nreasons that I have cited above, I am satisfied that Ravichandran spoke the truth. Julaiha\n\ndenied that she had conspired with anyone to kill Maniam. In order to emphasize her point,\n\nshe said that even up to the day Maniam died she still harboured the hope of a\n\nreconciliation with him. However, I find that the evidence was overwhelmingly stacked\n\nagainst her having such thought. It was necessary and crucial from her position, to deny\n\nmeeting Ravichandran on the two occasions that he said he met her. The denial of the\n\nSunday meeting at her rented flat must be examined more closely. Implicit in the denial\n\nthat this visit had taken place is an allegation that Ravichandran lied. Julaiha rented a\n\nroom from Juliyah bte Ramlee and her husband. This couple stayed in the master bedroom of\n\nthe same flat (and there is evidence that they preferred Julaiha not to bring guests into\n\nthe flat). Ravichandran had no means of knowing that on Sunday 18 April 1999 Juliyah and\n\nher husband would be going to Indonesia. He would have taken an unnecessary risk of having\n\nsuch a disingenuous lie being unraveled by Juliyah. Even if Ravichandran did not know that\n\nJulaiha rented a room in a shared flat, he would have no idea whatsoever as to who else\n\nmight be in the flat who might contradict his story. Ravichandran and Rajesh had no\n\ndifficulty identifying the rooms in the flat from the photographs. Furthermore, this visit\n\nis of no significance to the charges against the accused since nothing sinister occurred\n\nthere that day and I can see no reason why Ravichandran would conjure it to embellish his\n\nevidence, or Rajesh to corroborate it. Rajesh’s corroboration is significant. He said\n\nthat he watched SUN TV when he was in Julaiha’s flat. The owner, Mohamad Tumpang\n\n(Juliyah’s husband) testified that this was a cable channel which he had subscribed\n\nto. I do not believe that Rajesh would recklessly assume that the flat had a television\n\nset, let alone a subscription to SUN TV.58.    The charge against Julaiha is that of the abetment of murder by\n\nconspiracy. By this charge it is not envisaged that she should have been present at the\n\nscene of the murder and participated in the slaughter of Maniam. If conspiracy is proved\n\nit would be as if her hand was there, adding weight to the force of every blow that fell\n\nhim. The evidence that I have reviewed draws me to conclude that sometime in April 1999\n\nJulaiha participated in a conspiracy with Venkatesan and Chandran to kill Maniam. The\n\nevidence suggests that there must have been other discussions each amounting to a criminal\n\nconspiracy sufficient to meet the charge, but the prosecution has sufficiently proved the\n\nconspiracy that took place at the void deck of Juliyah’s flat in the early hours of\n\n15 April 1999 when Ravichandran was brought by Venkatesan and Chandran to meet Julaiha and\n\nreceive her exhortation to finish Maniam.59.    In coming to the findings as I do, I have taken into account the\n\nlengthy and varied evidence of the history relating to the strain and break-up of the\n\nrelationship between Maniam and Julaiha. I weighed this aspect of the evidence against the\n\ntestimony of Julaiha and her account of the disputes as well as her desire to reconcile\n\nwith Maniam. I place no great weight to all the instances of threats by Julaiha against\n\nManiam that are too remote in time such as that made in the office of the lawyer John\n\nAbraham or when she went to collect her belongings from 86 Phoenix Garden in October 1996.\n\nA wish list in 1996 should not be construed as a purchase order in 1999. However, more\n\nrecent utterances cannot be ignored. I, therefore, think that Julaiha’s declaration\n\nto Juliyah (that 86 Phoenix Garden was hers and that she wanted to get it back, sell it,\n\nand return to India) to be significant. First, this was said to Juliyah after the middle\n\nof March 1999, and reasonably close to the day of Maniam’s murder. Secondly, it\n\ncorroborates the point made by Ravichandran that she had said the same thing to him.\n\nThirdly, it forms part of the big picture showing her obsession with getting the house. It\n\nadds to the evidence of her attempt to get the house through the courts, and her statement\n\nto Juliyah the day after Maniam died, that she was going to see her lawyer in the\n\nafternoon to see if she could get the house now that Maniam was dead.60.    Finally, Mr Anandan submitted that Julaiha’s evidence in\n\ncourt ought to be impeached by her prior inconsistent statements made to the police. Under\n\ncross-examination by the learned DPP Julaiha said that on 21 April 1999 she did not enter\n\nVenkatesan’s room and did not know if he was there during the time when Maniam was\n\nkilled. She asserted her position more deeply by saying that she never enters his room\n\nwhen he is sleeping. However, in her statements to the police which she accepts as\n\nvoluntary statements, she said: \"On 21 April 1999 (Wednesday) at about 5.30 am, I\n\nwoke up. I went to pray again in the room. At about 6.00 am, I finished my prayer and went\n\nto sweep the floor. I swept Venkatesan’s room. I opened the door of his room. I woke\n\nhim up to do his painting. I do not know whether he woke up or not.\" In court, she\n\nfirst said that she held onto the handle of the door without opening it. Upon further\n\ncross-examination, she said that she said that she swept just a small portion of\n\nVenkatesan’s room by opening the door slightly. Furthermore, contrary to her evidence\n\nin court that she never enters Venkatesan’s room when he is asleep, her statement to\n\nthe police stated that on 20 April 1999 (the day before the murder) she was sweeping the\n\nfloor of the entire house including Venkatesan’s room when he was then asleep.61.    There is another inconsistency. She was referred by Mr Anandan,\n\nduring her cross-examination, to a promissory note of $50,000 she made in favour of\n\nVenkatesan. This promissory note was made on 29 May 1998, and payable on 29 May 1999. She\n\nsaid that this note was meant to deceive Venkatesan’s creditors in India into\n\nbelieving that he had money coming to him. It was not really meant to be paid. However, in\n\nher police statement she said that \"since I promised Venkatesan that I would give him\n\n$50,000, I might sell away my India property to pay him\". I found that there were\n\ndiscrepancies between her statements to the police and her evidence in court, and\n\npermitted Mr. Anandan to cross-examine her on them. I have taken these into account, as\n\npart of the evidence overall, when deciding whether or not her evidence has raised a\n\nreasonable doubt in my mind.",
        "Conclusion": "62.    On the findings that I have made and the reasons set out above, I\n\nam satisfied that the prosecution has proved its case against all three accused persons\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I find all three accused guilty as charged, and\n\nsentence them to suffer death.Choo Han TeckJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
