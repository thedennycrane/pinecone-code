        "Introduction": "1 Originating Summons No 51 of 2021 (“OS 51”) concerned an application by the plaintiff to set aside Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) Award No. 161 of 2020 (the “Award”) rendered by an arbitrator in SIAC Arbitration Nos. 360 and 361 of 2018. The plaintiff alleged breaches of the rules of natural justice by the arbitrator in the making of the Award. 2 I heard OS 51 on 21 April 2021. On 26 April 2021, I dismissed OS 51 with costs, delivering oral grounds containing brief reasons for my decision. As the plaintiff has appealed against my decision, I now set out the grounds for my decision in full. 3 For completeness, in Originating Summons No. 1311 of 2020 (“OS 1311”), the OS 51 defendant (as the plaintiff in OS 1311) applied for and obtained leave to enforce the Award in Singapore as a judgment of the court, and thereafter filed garnishee proceedings seeking to garnish monies held by the SIAC as part of a deposit paid by the OS 51 plaintiff in the arbitration proceedings. In tandem with OS 51, the OS 51 plaintiff (as the defendant in OS 1311) filed HC/SUM 1352/2021 (“SUM 1352”) seeking,inter alia, an adjournment of all further proceedings in OS 1311 pending the final disposal of OS 51. Following my dismissal of OS 51, I also dismissed SUM 1352. There has been no appeal against my decision in SUM 1352.",

        "Background to the dispute": "4 The plaintiff is a company incorporated in Taiwan while the defendant is a company incorporated in Singapore.1Foot Note 1×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 at paras 18–19.The parties had, from May 2018 to September 2018, an “amicable working relationship” during which six sale and purchase agreements for gasoil of various quantities, ranging from 9,588.743 metric tons (“MT”) to 13,930.843 MT, were executed without any problems. The plaintiff thus decided “to increase the volume of gasoil to be ordered under the seventh and eighth agreements” dated 8 October 2018 (the “First Contract”) and 19 October 2018 (the “Second Contract”) respectively (collectively, the “Contracts”).2Foot Note 2×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 at paras 21–22.Each of the Contracts concerned the sale by the defendant to the plaintiff of 20,000 MT (+/– 10% at the seller’s option) of gasoil with 500ppm sulphur content, with delivery on free on board (or “FOB”) Taichung basis.3Foot Note 3×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 at para 23; Shanna Rani Ghose’s Affidavit dated 24 February 2021 at para 12.Under the First Contract, delivery of the gasoil was to be effected between 28 September to 30 October 2018 (ie, a 33-day loading period) while under the Second Contract, the delivery period was between 1 and 30 November 2018. Delivery of the contracted quantities could be effected by way of “multiple liftings” with a minimum quantity of 2,000 MT per lifting to be loaded onboard the nominated vessel.4Foot Note 4×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 270–273 (Defendant’s letters dated 28 November 2018). 5 Clause 26 of the Contracts is identical, and I reproduce below the pertinent parts which parties referred to (“Clause 26”):5Foot Note 5×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 243–245 (First Contract) and pp 263–264 (Second Contract). 26.  DESTINATION RESTRICTION 26.1  It is a condition of the agreement that the product delivered under the agreement shall not be sold, transferred, transported, transshipped [sic], imported or discharged (by the buyer or others), directly or indirectly and irrespective of means, to any destination (“Restricted Destination”) which is at the time of such import inconsistent with, penalised or prohibited under the laws of the country in which such product was produced or contrary to any laws, regulations, decrees or other official United Nations, Singapore, Swiss, United States of America, European Union rules, regulations or requirements applicable to the seller which relate to foreign trade controls, export controls, embargoes or international boycotts of any type, or contrary to any regulation, rule, directive or guideline applied by the government of that country (or international body) or any relevant agency thereof. The buyer shall keep itself informed as to such laws, regulations, rules, directives or guidelines and shall ensure that they are complied with. 26.2  The buyer undertakes that the product deliverable hereunder shall not: (A) be exported to any Restricted Jurisdiction; or (B) be sold or supplied to any natural or legal person in any Restricted Jurisdiction; or (C) be sold or supplied to any natural or legal person for the purposes of any commercial activity carried out in or from any such Restricted Jurisdiction. For the purposes of this clause, (I) “Restricted Destination” includes any port(s), vessel/barge(s) or storage facilities in any Restricted Jurisdiction. (II) “Restricted Jurisdiction” shall mean any country, state, territory or region against which there are sanctions imposed by the country in which such product was produced, the United Nations, Singapore, Switzerland, United States of America, or European Union which prohibit the shipment thereto of crude oil and/or petroleum products. 26.3  The buyer shall, if the seller so requires, provide the seller with appropriate documentation for the purposes of verifying the final destination of any delivery hereunder. Such documentation shall be provided within seven (7) days of the request or such lesser period as will enable the seller or its supplier to comply (to the seller’s satisfaction) with any requirement or request of the government or authority in question. … 26.6  The buyer shall ensure that all of its sale agreements involving the product shall contain the same Restricted Destination clause or another clause that has like effect. … 26.8  The buyer undertakes and warrants that it will comply with the provisions of this clause. Any breach of this clause shall constitute an event of default, and shall entitle the seller to exercise its rights relating to such event of default, including an indemnity for any fines or penalties imposed on the seller. 6 On 30 October 2018 and under the First Contract, 1,994.862 MT of gasoil was loaded at the port of Taichung onboard the motor tanker “OSLO” nominated by the plaintiff as the FOB buyer (the “OSLO Parcel”), and for which the plaintiff paid the defendant a sum of USD 1,425,003.37. The plaintiff alleged that there were quality issues with the OSLO Parcel, and in respect of which it had to eventually compensate the third-party buyer to whom it had on-sold the cargo.6Foot Note 6×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 274–287 (Notice of Arbitration dated 21 December 2018, paras 16–20).Save for the OSLO Parcel, the plaintiff failed to take delivery of any of the remainder of the cargo it had contracted to buy from the defendant under the Contracts because of the alleged quality concerns.7Foot Note 7×Shanna Rani Ghose’s Affidavit dated 24 February 2021 at para 13; Plaintiff’s Written Submissions (“WS”) at para 14.The defendant subsequently sent two letters dated 28 November 2018 to the plaintiff purporting to terminate the Contracts and stated that it would claim “losses, damages, costs and expenses” against the plaintiff.8Foot Note 8×Plaintiff’s WS at para 14; Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 at para 25. 7 By a Notice of Arbitration filed with the SIAC on 21 December 2018, the plaintiff commenced two arbitrations against the defendant, one under each of the Contracts.9Foot Note 9×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 at para 26, Exhibit TC–1 at pp 274–287 (Notice of Arbitration dated 21 December 2018).Both arbitrations were subsequently consolidated by the SIAC on 15 February 2019. The arbitral tribunal was constituted on 23 April 2019 (“Tribunal”) with the appointment by the SIAC of a sole arbitrator (“Arbitrator”).10Foot Note 10×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at p 34 (Final Award at para 12).",
        "The Arbitration Proceedings and the Award": "8 In the arbitration proceedings, the plaintiff claimed,inter alia, for a refund of “[a]ll sums that have actually been received by the [defendant] from the [plaintiff]” in relation to the First Contract.11Foot Note 11×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at p 285 (Notice of Arbitration at para 39(a)(xi)).The plaintiff also sought a declaration that the Second Contract had “not been validly formed” and a declaration that the defendant “is not entitled to any payment” under the Contracts.12Foot Note 12×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at p 316 (Notice of Arbitration at paras 39(b)(ii) and (c)(i)).The defendant in turn counterclaimed,inter alia, for the plaintiff’s breach in its failure and/or refusal to “take delivery of the cargo as agreed”. Instead, the plaintiff “only took delivery of 1,994.862MT of cargo under [the First Contract] on 30 October 2018, and took no further deliveries thereafter”.13Foot Note 13×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at p 316 (Re-Amended Statement of Defence and Counterclaim at para 90).The defendant also counterclaimed for the plaintiff’s breach in respect of the Second Contract, with damages for breach of the Contracts to be calculated based on s 50(2) of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed) (“SOGA”).14Foot Note 14×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 317, 319 (Re-Amended Statement of Defence and Counterclaim at paras 93–95, 101–104).As will be elaborated below, the defendant subsequently changed tack and proceeded on the basis that the damages, if any, due to the defendant were to be calculated based on s 50(3) of the SOGA instead. Section 50(3) of the SOGA provides that: Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been accepted or (if no time was fixed for acceptance) at the time of the refusal to accept. 9 In the arbitral proceedings, the plaintiff advanced two arguments relating to the aforementioned issues (the “Arguments”). According to the plaintiff, the defendant “had failed to adduce evidence of actual losses (the “No Actual Losses Argument”)” and “had no goods [ie, the requisite gasoil to supply] for the majority of the [33-day loading period] and therefore suffered no losses (the “No Goods No Losses Argument”)”.15Foot Note 15×Plaintiff’s WS at paras 19 and 43.In summary, the plaintiff’s No Actual Losses Argument was that the defendant “had failed to adduce evidence of actual losses and accordingly, had not suffered any actual losses despite [the plaintiff’s] breach of contract” and thus claimed for “forecasted” losses which “were never incurred”.16Foot Note 16×Plaintiff’s WS at para 34.The plaintiff’s No Goods No Losses Argument was that the defendant “did not have sufficient [g]asoil to supply to [the plaintiff] under the [Contracts] and therefore could not have suffered any losses”. In that regard, the plaintiff argued that the defendant’s own documents “showed that they did not have the necessary goods to meet [the required volume of gasoil] all the way until 24 October, just a week left until the end of the loading period” under the First Contract.17Foot Note 17×Plaintiff’s WS at paras 42–43. 10 Lastly, I noted that parties had initially disputed whether there was an available market and hence a number of the arguments made and evidence tendered in the arbitration proceedings revolved around the issue of hedging and whether the defendant had failed to mitigate its alleged loss. The plaintiff contended that the defendant ought to have mitigated its losses by entering into gasoil hedging contracts on or shortly after 30 October 2018 and 6 November 2018 for the First and Second Contracts respectively, when the defendant had initially denied that there was an available market for the gasoil.18Foot Note 18×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at p 39 (Award at para 45).However, about a week prior to the evidentiary hearing, the defendant conceded that there was an available market. Thereafter, the question of whether there was an available market was no longer a contentious issue or contemplated in parties’ submissions in the arbitration. Consequently, the issue of hedging became irrelevant and s 50(2) of the SOGA was no longer the focus.19Foot Note 19×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at p 648 (Claimant’s Written Closing Submissions dated 30 April 2020 at para 129) and p 410 (Respondent’s Closing Submissions dated 30 April 2020 at para 111).At the hearing before me, counsel for the defendant, Mr Siraj Omar SC, confirmed that while the defendant had initially advanced its case on the basis of there being no available market, it subsequently dropped that claim and instead advanced its claim on the basis that therewasan available market, and relied on s 50(3) of the SOGA instead.20Foot Note 20×Transcript dated 21 April 2021 at p 11, lines 4–8; p 14, lines 22–29. 11 In the arbitral proceedings, the defendant also counterclaimed for the plaintiff’s breach of Clause 26 of the Contracts, the relevant portions of which have been reproduced at [5]. The defendant submitted that the plaintiff had breached Clause 26 of the First Contract by: (a) failing to ensure that its own sale contract with its buyer, Great Sign Ltd (“Great Sign”), regarding the OSLO Parcel contained the same or equivalent Restricted Destination clause (as required by Clause 26.6); and (b) failing to provide documentation verifying the final destination of the OSLO Parcel (in breach of Clause 26.3). Clause 26.8 thus entitled the defendant to an indemnity from the plaintiff for any fines or penalties imposed on it.21Foot Note 21×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 343–344 and 423 (Re-Amended Statement of Rejoinder and Reply to Defence to Counterclaim dated 9 January 2020 at para 33A; Respondent’s Closing Submissions dated 30 April 2020 at paras 151–154). 12 The plaintiff responded that Clause 26 could not be relied on by the defendant following the defendant’s termination of the First Contract. In particular, it was not stipulated in either of the Contracts that Clause 26 would survive termination. As such, the plaintiff sought to adduce expert evidence on whether Clause 26 would survive termination as a matter of industry practice. This forms the contextual backdrop to the second ground of objection which the plaintiff raised in OS 51 (see [19] below). The plaintiff also submitted that, in any case, Clause 26.8 is a compensatory indemnityand not a preventive indemnity. In that regard, the defendant has not suffered any losses as a result of any alleged breach of Clause 26 which the plaintiff ought to indemnify.22Foot Note 22×Shanna Rani Ghose’s Affidavit dated 24 February 2021 at pp 95, 103–104 and 126–127 (Claimant’s Amended Statement of Reply and Defence to Counterclaim dated 11 October 2019 at paras 43A, 68C–68H; Claimant’s Written Opening Submissions dated 17 March 2020 at paras 83–86). 13 On 17 November 2020, the Tribunal issued the Award in favour of the defendant. The Tribunal held,inter alia, that:23Foot Note 23×Defendant’s WS at para 6. (a) the plaintiff was in breach of the First Contract by failing to lift the remaining gasoil within the loading period, and such breach entitled the defendant to terminate the First Contract, which it did by way of letter on 28 November 2018;24Foot Note 24×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 59–60 (Award at [137]–[140]). (b) the plaintiff was in breach of the Second Contract by failing to provide a letter of credit by 9 November 2018 and by failing to lift any gasoil within the loading period, and such breaches entitled the defendant to terminate the Second Contract, which it did by way of letter on 28 November 2018;25Foot Note 25×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 61–62 (Award at [148]–[155]).and (c) the plaintiff was in breach of Clause 26 of the First Contract by failing to ensure that its sale contract with Great Sign regarding the OSLO Parcel contained the same or equivalent Restricted Destination clause in the First Contract and by failing to provide documentation verifying the final destination of the OSLO Parcel. The Tribunal therefore granted a declaration that the plaintiff was required to indemnify the defendant in the event that any fines or penalties are imposed on the latter by reason of the final destination of the OSLO Parcel.26Foot Note 26×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 38, 70–72 (Award at [35] and [195]–[202]). 14 Flowing from the findings as set out at [13(a)] and [13(b)], the Arbitrator found that the defendant was entitled to be compensated for any loss and damage it had suffered by reason of the plaintiff’s breaches of the Contracts for non-acceptance of gasoil, with damages to be assessed by reference to s 50 of the SOGA as follows:27Foot Note 27×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 62–63 and 65–70 (Award at [156] and [159]–[194]). (a) concerning the First Contract, the difference between the contract price and the market price on the next business day after the expiry of the loading period (ie, 31 October 2018), rounded to the nearest dollar; and (b) concerning the Second Contract, the difference between the contract price and the market price on the next business day after the expiry of the loading period (ie, 3 December 2018). 15 The Arbitrator made three dispositive orders against the plaintiff:28Foot Note 28×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 78–79 (Award at [237]); Plaintiff’s WS at para 2; Defendant’s WS at para 7. (a) in respect of the First Contract, the Arbitrator awarded the defendant damages in the sum of USD 303,555.00 plus (i) interest at the rate of 6.30688% per annum from 31 October 2018 (inclusive) until the date of payment (exclusive) and (ii) costs and expenses in the amount of S$504,407.09 and costs of the arbitration pursuant to Clause 20 of the First Contract; (b) in respect of the Second Contract, the Arbitrator awarded the defendant damages in the sum of USD 3,055,096.00 plus (i) interest at the rate of 6.37888% per annum from 3 December 2018 (inclusive) until the date of payment (exclusive) and (ii) costs and expenses in the amount of S$504,407.09 pursuant to Clause 20 of the Second Contract; and (c) an indemnity for any fines or penalties imposed on the defendant by reason of the final destination of the parcel of 1,994.862 MT of gasoil delivered to the plaintiff aboard the MT OSLO on 30 October 2018 pursuant to Clause 26.8 of the First Contract.",
        "The parties’ cases": "16 I briefly summarise the parties’ cases in OS 51. 17 The plaintiff applied to set aside the Award, relying on the ground of breach of natural justice under s 24(b) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”) and/or Art 34(2)(a)(ii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (the “Model Law”). The plaintiff acknowledged that the four requirements (as reiterated by the Court of Appeal inSohBeng Tee & Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“SohBeng Tee”) at [29]) would have to be satisfied by it, namely:29Foot Note 29×Plaintiff’s WS at paras 22, 24 and 26. (a) which rule of natural justice was breached;(b) how it was breached;(c) in what way the breach was connected to the making of the award; and(d) how the breach prejudiced its rights. 18 The plaintiff argued that all the requirements were met in this case, and raised two grounds. The first was that the Arbitrator’s “failure to consider or address points raised by parties falls foul of theaudialteram partemrule, which states that a judge must hear both sides of a case before reaching a decision”.30Foot Note 30×Plaintiff’s WS at para 27.In this regard, the plaintiff submitted that the Arbitrator “had failed to apply its mind to [the plaintiff’s] Arguments”.31Foot Note 31×Plaintiff’s WS at para 33.The Arguments went to the crux of the issue of whether the defendant had “proven its losses to entitle it to claim for the same” as the plaintiff must “prove its losses in the first place before damages can be assessed”.32Foot Note 32×Plaintiff’s WS at paras 48–49.If the Arbitrator had considered the Arguments, the defendant would not have been awarded damages, interest on such damages, and costs.33Foot Note 33×Plaintiff’s WS at paras 4 and 6.I term this first ground of objection the “1st NJ Breach”. 19 The plaintiff submitted, as its second ground, that it was “not given a full or reasonable opportunity to be heard” under Article 18 of the Model Law due to the Tribunal’s direction “not to submit expert evidence on certain aspects of industry practice”.34Foot Note 34×Plaintiff’s WS at para 69.The expert evidence related to whether Clause 26 (see above at [5]) survives the termination of each of the Contracts by reason of industry practice.35Foot Note 35×Plaintiff’s WS at para 73.Had the Arbitrator not disallowed the plaintiff’s application to adduce expert evidence, the plaintiff would not have been ordered to indemnify the defendant with respect to the relevant fines and penalties that may have been imposed on the defendant.36Foot Note 36×Plaintiff WS at paras 5–6.Thus, this ground also satisfied the requirements as laid down inSohBeng Tee(see above at [17]). I term this ground of objection the “2nd NJ Breach”. 20 The defendant’s position was that “there [was] no legal or factual basis to sustain [the plaintiff’s] claims in this application”.37Foot Note 37×Defendant’s WS at para 70.Concerning the plaintiff’s allegation that the Arbitrator failed to apply his mind to the Arguments, the defendant submitted that this allegation was a “complete non-starter” as the plaintiff has not suffered any prejudice and, in any case, the Arbitrator had considered the Arguments.38Foot Note 38×Defendant’s WS at paras 11–12.Concerning whether Clause 26 survived the termination of the Contracts, the defendant submits that the Arbitrator had afforded both parties the opportunity to be heard in relation to the expert evidence which the plaintiff sought to adduce.39Foot Note 39×Defendant’s WS at para 38. 21 Additionally, not every breach of the rules of natural justice will in itself amount to the required “prejudice” mentioned at [17(d)] above. The Court of Appeal was careful to elaborate that it is necessary to “prove that the breach, if any, had caused actual or real prejudice to the party seeking to set aside an award” (SohBeng Teeat [86]). In that regard, an applicant will have to persuade the court that there has been some actual or real prejudice caused by the alleged breach which is “more than technical unfairness” (SohBeng Teeat [91]). At the very least, it must be established that the breach could “have actually altered the final outcome of the arbitral proceedings in some meaningful way” (SohBeng Teeat [91]).",
        "Issues to be determined": "22 The foregoing summary demonstrates that there are two main issues to be determined: (a) whether the Arbitrator failed to consider the Arguments and consequently, was the 1st NJ Breach made out; and(b) whether the 2nd NJ Breach was made out by virtue of the Arbitrator’s decision not to grant the plaintiff leave to adduce expert evidence in relation to the survivability of Clause 26. 23 I address each of these issues in turn.",
        "Issue 1: whether the 1st NJ Breach was made out": "",
        "The applicable legal principles": "62 It is well established that Article 18 of the Model Law, while providing that each party shall have a “full opportunity” of presenting its case, is understood to mean that each party has a right to have a reasonableopportunity to present its case (ADG and another v ADI another matter[2014] 3 SLR 481 (“ADG”) at [104]). The “full opportunity” to present one’s case is “not an unlimited one and must be balanced against considerations of reasonableness, efficiency and fairness” (CBSat [50];ADGat [105]). 63 What amounts to a reasonable opportunity to be heard is, in turn, an intensely factual inquiry. The court’s concern is whether the proceedings were “conducted in a fair manner” (CBSat [51]). Ultimately, the overarching enquiry is whether “what the tribunal did (or decided not to do) falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done” (China Machineat [98]). 64 In applying this test, the court assesses the tribunal’s decision with reference to “what was known to the tribunal at the material time” [emphasis in original] (China Machineat [99]). Furthermore, the court accords a “margin of deference to the tribunal in its exercise of procedural discretion” precisely because an arbitration tribunal “possesses a wide discretion to determine the arbitral procedure” and such discretion “is exercised within a highly specific and fact-intensive contextual milieu, the finer points of which the court may not be privy to” (China Machineat [103]). 65 The foregoing principles are particularly apposite to a party’s conductduringthe arbitral proceedings and, in particular, with regard to procedural issues that may arise in the course of the arbitration. The Court of Appeal has made it clear that if a party “intends to contend that there has been a fatal failure in the process of the arbitration, then theremustbe fair intimation to the tribunal that the complaining party intends to take that point at the appropriate time if the tribunal insists on proceeding” [emphasis in original]. If a party so alleges that there has been such a fatal process failure and its hopes for a fair hearing have thereby been “irretrievably dashed by the acts of the tribunal”, then it “cannot simply ‘reserve’ its position until after the award and if the result turns out to be palatable to it, not pursue the point, or if it were otherwise to then take the point” (China Machineat [168], [170]). As this court observed inCAI v CAJ[2021] SGHC 21 at [2], if an aggrieved party equivocates or keeps silent on the manner in which the arbitral proceedings are conducted only to raise objections subsequently in a setting aside application, such conduct would be viewed unfavourably by the court as an illegitimate attempt by that party to hedge its position.",
        "The parties’ positions": "57 The plaintiff’s position was that the Tribunal had “wrongfully excluded expert evidence, thereby infringing on [the plaintiff’s] right to be heard pursuant to Article 18 of the Model Law”,80Foot Note 80×Plaintiff’s WS at para 33.which provides,inter alia, that “parties shall be given a full opportunity of presenting his case”. The plaintiff relied onCBSv CBP[2021] SGCA 4 (“CBS”) for the proposition that “the broad procedural powers of an arbitral tribunal are subject to the fundamental rules of natural justice” (at [62]).81Foot Note 81×Plaintiff’s WS at para 77.The expert evidence which the plaintiff intended to submit was on the specific point whether clauses such as Clause 26 “survive termination in the industry” and thus “remains enforceable after termination”.82Foot Note 82×Plaintiff’s WS at paras 71 and 73.Such expert evidence would have been relevant “for determining if an indemnification is to be granted”, was not “duplicative”, would have “required only a short opinion” and its “length and complexity [would have been] minimal”. Thus, under rr 19.1 and 25.2 of the SIAC Rules (6th Edition, 2016) (“SIAC Rules”), such expert evidence ought to have been admitted.83Foot Note 83×Plaintiff’s WS at paras 72–76. 58 According to the plaintiff, the exclusion of expert evidence led to the Arbitrator deciding that such clauses would survive the termination of the Contracts, thus “resulting in the Tribunal making the third dispositive order in the Award”. That was the serious prejudice the plaintiff had suffered and which had altered the final outcome of the arbitral proceedings. Had the Arbitrator allowed the plaintiff’s expert evidence, “the third dispositive order would not have been made”.84Foot Note 84×Plaintiff’s WS at paras 83–84. 59 The defendant submitted that the Arbitrator “concluded, after a full consideration of [the plaintiff’s] submissions, that expert evidence” would “not be relevant and/or helpful in resolving the dispute between the parties”.85Foot Note 85×Defendant’s WS at para 45.The defendant highlighted that the following chronology of events demonstrates clearly that there was no failure in the arbitral process as far as the Arbitrator’s procedural ruling was concerned: (a) 3 January 2020: the plaintiff sent an email to the defendant stating the specific questions that the plaintiff’s expert witness would cover.86Foot Note 86×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 1308–1310 (Email from plaintiff’s solicitors dated 3 January 2020 at 11:33 at S/N 4).The defendant replied that that was the “first time” that the plaintiff had “given notice of its intention to tender expert evidence on the [C]lause 26 issue”. In that regard, “[n]o permission to tender evidence of this point was given when the [List of Issues] was finalised, nor was leave sought at any time prior to the submission of factual witness statements” and in any case, “the point raised is a legal one and not one for expert evidence”.87Foot Note 87×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 1306–1308 (Email from defendant’s solicitors dated 3 January 2020 at 8:12PM at S/N 4). (b) 6 January 2020: the Arbitrator directed the plaintiff to respond to the defendant’s points and explain why expert evidence was required, having regard to the pleadings and the List of Issues.88Foot Note 88×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at p 1306 (Email dated 6 January 2020 at 2:24PM). (c) 7 January 2020: the plaintiff explained that “as final destination provisions are a relatively recent feature of the industry, with some major traders adopting this but others not, it might be helpful for the Tribunal to have industry expertise brought to bear”.89Foot Note 89×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at p 1299 (Letter dated 7 January 2020 at para 9). (d) 8 January 2020: the defendant maintained that the plaintiff’s application to adduce expert evidence on the Clause 26 issue should be disallowed “for the simple reason that the [C]lause 26 issue is strictly a legal issue and not an issue of ‘industry practice’ or one for expert evidence”.90Foot Note 90×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at p 1304 (Email dated 8 January 2020 at para 16). (e) 9 January 2020: the Arbitrator conveyed his decision to the parties by email, having “reviewed the pleadings again in detail as well as the various submissions filed by the parties” and having considered rr 19.1, 19.2 and 41.2 of the SIAC Rules. In respect of the issue in question, the Arbitrator did not “consider that industry expertise will assist in the proper construction of the contract and whether as a matter of law Clause 26 survives termination” and thus “decline[d] to permit expert evidence on this issue”.91Foot Note 91×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at p 1323 (Email dated 9 January 2020 timed at 11:37).I reproduce below the relevant parts of the Arbitrator’s ruling:92Foot Note 92×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 1321 and 1323 (Email dated 9 January 2020 timed at 11:37). It is somewhat unusual to be faced with an application of this sort before the expert evidence has been filed. Without seeing the evidence, there is an element of conjecture in being able to determine what relevance and probative value such evidence might have. I must therefore proceed with caution in debarring evidence prior to seeing it. To be clear, the directions below are not a determination by me of the relevance, materiality and admissibility of the expert evidence to be filed. … Finally, I turn to issue 4(a). This issue is described as whether as a matter of industry practice Clause 26 survives the termination of the First Disputed Contract. The Claimant has elaborated to explain that “as final destination provisions are a relatively recent feature of the industry, with some major traders adopting this but others not, it might be helpful for the Tribunal to have industry expertise brought to bear”. I do not consider that industry expertise will assist in the proper construction of the contract and whether as a matter of law Clause 26 survives termination. As a consequence, I decline to permit expert evidence on this issue. [emphasis in original] 60 The defendant submitted that from the chronology set out above, it is clear that the Arbitrator’s ruling was made “after a full consideration of [the plaintiff’s] submissions”. In those circumstances, there was no breach of the rules of natural justice.93Foot Note 93×Defendant’s WS at paras 45–47.Even if there was a breach, there was no prejudice occasioned by such breach. The defendant highlighted that the plaintiff “did have the opportunity to convince the Tribunal that Clause 26 did not survive the termination of the First Contract, and in fact fully exercised that opportunity”. As the issue was one of construction of the First Contract which, in turn, was based on ascertaining the parties’ intentions as to the scope of Clause 26, expert evidence on industry practice could have “no bearing on the issue”.94Foot Note 94×Defendant’s WS at paras 49–55. 61 The foregoing circumstances also made the present case distinguishable fromCBS.95Foot Note 95×Defendant’s WS at paras 56–60.In that case, the arbitrator directed that “there would be no witnesses presented at the hearing” and only allowed the hearing “for oralsubmissions only” [emphasis in original] (at [27]).",
        "My analysis and decision": "66 Bearing these principles in mind, I conclude that there was no breach of natural justice occasioned by the Arbitrator’s decision to exclude expert evidence on Clause 26. The Arbitrator’s decision was reasoned and arrived at after considering the arguments raised by both parties. The manner in which the Arbitrator dealt with the application and issued his ruling on the plaintiff’s application could not in any way be described as irrational or capricious. The Arbitrator’s decision to disallow the plaintiff’s application to tender expert evidence on the Clause 26 issue was well within the ambit of the wide discretionary powers of the Arbitrator to determine matters pertaining to procedure and evidence, as well as the deference given to arbitrators on such matters. Nor could it be said that what the Arbitrator did fell outside the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done. 67 Further, there was no objection raised by the plaintiff to the Arbitrator’s decision which was rendered on 9 January 2020. Mr Lee referred me to an email sent by the plaintiff’s solicitors to the Arbitrator on 16 January 2020, where the plaintiff indicated that it “will comply,but under protest, with [the Arbitrator’s decision rendered on 9 January 2020] (with compulsive force) for exchange of expert evidence, which has shifted from a full simultaneous exchange, which was Parties’ longstanding agreement since the procedural architecture was fixed, to a part-simultaneous-part-sequential one” [emphasis added]. In this regard, the plaintiff indicated its “rights are respectfully reserved”.96Foot Note 96×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at pp 1315 and 1323 (Email dated 16 January 2020 timed at 11:13). 68 I disagreed with the plaintiff that this purported reservation of rights was adequate; on the contrary, it was clear to me that it was in fact woefully inadequate. I say this for several reasons. 69 First, the plaintiff’s purported reservation of rights wasnotin fact directed at the Arbitrator’s decision to disallow expert evidence on the Clause 26 issue. Rather, the plaintiff’s complaint and purported reservation of rights was in relation to the Arbitrator’sfurtherprocedural decision directing that part of the expert evidence be submittedsequentiallyinstead of being exchanged. Thus, insofar as the Arbitrator’s decision disallowing expert evidence on the Clause 26 issue was concerned, there was in factnoreservation of rights at all. Further, for completeness and as stated below at [74], even the complaint pertaining to sequential submission of expert evidence was dropped by the plaintiff and was no longer in issue in OS 51. 70 Second, the Arbitrator’s ruling disallowing the expert evidence was madepriortothe evidentiary hearing which took place in March 2020. Nevertheless, the plaintiff continued with the proceedings right through to the completion of the evidentiary hearing and closing submissions without demur. 71 In my judgment, the plaintiff’s conduct was precisely the sort of hedging and equivocation that the Court of Appeal inChina Machinehad expressly cautioned arbitrants against (see above at [65]). It was thus not open to the plaintiff to belatedly raise the objection before this court that it was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard by reason of the Arbitrator’ procedural decision to disallow expert evidence on the Clause 26 issue. 72 In any event, I failed to see what prejudice was occasioned to the plaintiff. I accept the defendant’s argument that, based on the Arbitrator’s reasoning and conclusions reached on the substantive issue pertaining to Clause 26 (identified by the Arbitrator as Issue 13(a) in the List of Issues), any expert evidence led by the plaintiff, even if allowed, could not have reasonably made any difference to the outcome. It is clear that ultimately, the Arbitrator’s decision on whether Clause 26 survived termination of the First Contract turned entirely on the construction of the First Contract and clause 26.97Foot Note 97×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 Exhibit TC–1 at p 71 (Award at paras 197–199).In those circumstances, expert evidence would, in my judgment, have made no difference to the Arbitrator’s analysis and decision on this issue. 73 For the foregoing reasons, the 2nd NJ Breach alleged by the plaintiff was also not made out. 74 Finally and for completeness, the plaintiff also appeared to raise, in its supporting affidavit,98Foot Note 98×Terrence Chiu Ying Terng’s 1st Affidavit dated 21 January 2021 at para 59.certain further objections relating to the Arbitrator (a) disallowing expert evidence on the issue of the reasonableness of the defendant’s decision to order/acquire gasoil to fulfil the Second Contract without the plaintiff having provided a letter of credit and (b) directing that part of the expert evidence be submitted sequentially, these further objections were dropped by the plaintiff and no longer pursued during the hearing before me.99Foot Note 99×Transcript dated 21 April 2021 at p 2, lines 35–38.",

        "Conclusion": "75 For the reasons set out above, I dismissed the plaintiff’s application in its entirety and awarded costs to the defendant. I fixed costs at S$15,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant. 76 Finally, as the plaintiff’s application was unsuccessful, there was no need for me to consider the defendant’s alternative arguments on remitting the Award to the Arbitrator.
