        "Three applications": "1       By the three applications before me, the\n                    plaintiffs seek to set aside an award issued in favour of the defendants by a\n                    three-member tribunal in an arbitration administered by the Singapore\n                    International Arbitration Centre. I shall refer to the award as a single award,\n                    although in truth it comprises a partial award issued on 9 May 2012 as amended\n                    by a further partial award issued on 15 June 2012 and as further amended by a\n                    memorandum of corrections issued on 5 July 2012. 2       To maintain the confidentiality attached to the\n                    arbitration, the plaintiffs in each application applied for and secured, without\n                    objection from the defendants, an order under s 22 of the International\n                    Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IAA”) that the\n                    proceedings in each application be heard otherwise than in open court and that\n                    the court’s electronic file in each application be sealed to prevent\n                    public inspection. To maintain that confidentiality, I have used pseudonyms in\n                    this judgment to refer to the parties and to any names by which they or their\n                    arbitration may be identified. I have also converted all sums denominated in\n                    local currency into the approximate equivalent in US dollars at a representative\n                    exchange rate. 3       The arbitration arises from the liquidation of a\n                    company I shall call the Corporation. The Corporation was the largest regional\n                    producer of a product I shall call Mithril. It carried on business in a country\n                    I shall call Moria, with its principal production facility in a city I shall\n                    call Erebor. 4       In the course of the Corporation’s\n                    liquidation, all of the following parties entered into an Asset Purchase\n                    Agreement (“the APA”): (a) the liquidator, (b) the\n                    Corporation’s secured creditors, (c) the Corporation’s shareholders\n                    and (d) the defendants. Under the APA, the defendants agreed to purchase certain\n                    assets from the Corporation. Some of these assets were encumbered with security\n                    interests in favour of the Corporation’s creditors. In exchange for these\n                    secured creditors’ agreement to the sale, and as part of the consideration\n                    for the assets they purchased, the defendants agreed to issue two notes for the\n                    benefit of the secured creditors. The terms of the notes were set out in an\n                    agreement between the defendants and the secured creditors known as the Omnibus\n                    Agreement (“the OMNA”). 5       At the time the parties entered into the APA,\n                    the Corporation owed a large amount of unpaid tax to the municipal authorities\n                    of Erebor. One of the conditions precedent to the closing of the transactions\n                    under the APA was the approval by the municipal authorities of a deferred\n                    payment scheme for this unpaid tax. This condition precedent was eventually\n                    satisfied when the liquidator delivered to the defendants what the parties\n                    referred to as a “tax amnesty agreement” (or “the\n                    TAA”). The TAA was liable to be revoked if any taxes in relation to the\n                    Corporation’s assets, including the assets which the defendants purchased\n                    under the APA, were not paid on time. 6       The transactions under the APA closed in 2004.\n                    Very soon thereafter, the defendants, the liquidator and the secured creditors\n                    of the Corporation became embroiled in disputes with the municipal authorities\n                    over the taxes that had to be paid in relation the Corporation’s assets,\n                    including assets which the defendants had purchased under the APA. The TAA was\n                    eventually revoked in 2006 because of the failure to pay certain taxes on\n                    time. 7       In 2008, the defendants commenced arbitration\n                    against a number of entities. In its final incarnation, the defendants’\n                    case in the arbitration was that the liquidator, the secured creditors and the\n                    shareholders of the Corporation were in breach of the APA because they had\n                    failed to deliver to the defendants clean title to the assets which the\n                    defendants had purchased under the APA. The defendants alleged that title was\n                    not clean because the assets were subject to a tax lien. The defendants also\n                    claimed that the liquidator, the secured creditors and the shareholders were\n                    jointly and severally liable to indemnify the defendants for the failure of the\n                    secured creditors, in breach of their obligations under the APA, to settle\n                    certain property claims (“the Lost Land Claims”). 8       The tribunal agreed with the defendants. It\n                    awarded the defendants US$80m as damages for a lost opportunity to earn profits\n                    and an indemnity of about US$23.7m in respect of the Lost Land Claims. It also\n                    declared that the defendants were entitled to suspend performance of their\n                    payment obligations under the two notes (see [4] above) without consequence for\n                    so long as the plaintiffs remained in breach of their obligation to deliver\n                    clean title to the assets. 9       Dissatisfied with the award, the plaintiffs now\n                    apply to set it aside on two grounds: (a)     That they were unable to present\n                        their case in the arbitration within the meaning of Art 34(2)(a)(ii) of the\n                        UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985 (“the\n                        Model Law”) and/or that their rights were prejudiced by a breach of\n                        the rules of natural justice in connection with the making of the award\n                        within the meaning of s 24(b) of the IAA. (b)     That the award deals with disputes not\n                        contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to the\n                        arbitration and/or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the\n                        submission to the arbitration, contrary to Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model\n                        Law.",
        "The parties": "10     The plaintiff in Originating Summons No. [L]\n                    is the Corporation’s liquidator. The liquidator is represented by a team\n                    from WongPartnership LLP led by Mr Alvin Yeo SC. 11     The plaintiffs in Originating Summons No. [M]\n                    are 11 out of 24 secured creditors of the Corporation. For convenience, I shall\n                    refer to these 11 parties collectively as “the secured creditors”.\n                    They are represented by a team from Drew & Napier LLC led by Mr Davinder\n                    Singh SC. 12     The first to third plaintiffs in Originating\n                    Summons No. [N] are three investment funds which purchased on the secondary\n                    market the notes issued by the defendants (see [4] above) from some of the\n                    original 24 secured creditors of the Corporation. I shall refer to these three\n                    parties collectively as “the Funds”. The fourth plaintiff in this\n                    originating summons is the sub-custodian and agent for the Funds. These\n                    plaintiffs are represented by a team from Rodyk & Davidson LLP led by Mr\n                    Philip Jeyaretnam SC. 13     The two defendants in all three applications\n                    are special purpose vehicles incorporated under the laws of Moria. They are\n                    subsidiaries of a company I shall call Galaxy, incorporated under the laws of\n                    the Isle of Man. The defendants are represented by a team from Rajah & Tann\n                    LLP led by Mr Andre Yeap SC.",
        "The parties’ cases in a nutshell and my decision": "14     A number of the plaintiffs’ complaints\n                    about the award are common to all of the plaintiffs. The remaining complaints\n                    are specific to a particular set of plaintiffs. It suffices for now to list the\n                    plaintiffs’ seven principal complaints about the tribunal’s decision\n                    without attributing specific complaints to specific plaintiffs: (a)     The tribunal failed to consider the\n                        liquidator's submissions, arguments and evidence in support of his case that\n                        the obligation to deliver clean title to the assets under the APA was\n                        qualified to the extent of the TAA. (b)     The tribunal failed to consider the secured\n                        creditors’ and the liquidator’s submissions, arguments and\n                        evidence in support of their separate cases that it was the defendants\n                        – and not the liquidator – who were responsible for the TAA\n                        being revoked. (c)     The tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by determining that the defendants\n                        suffered damage in the form of a loss of an opportunity to earn profits as a\n                        result of the plaintiffs’ breaches of the APA. (d)     As an alternative to (c), the secured\n                        creditors and the liquidator were unable to present their separate cases on\n                        whether the defendants had suffered damage in the form of a loss of an\n                        opportunity to earn profits as a result of the plaintiffs’ breaches of\n                        the APA. (e)     The\n                        tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by suspending the defendants’\n                        payment obligations under the two notes. (f)     The tribunal failed to consider the secured\n                        creditors' submissions, arguments and evidence in support of their case in\n                        relation to the Lost Land Claims. (g)     The tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction when it held that\n                        the Funds – who were merely purchasers of the notes in the secondary\n                        market – were liable to the defendants for breaches of the APA;\n                        further and in the alternative, the tribunal did not give the Funds an\n                        opportunity to present their case as to why they were not, as mere assignees\n                        of the notes, liable under the APA. 15     The defendants’ response, in short, is\n                    to deny that any of the grounds for setting aside the award have been\n                    established. They argue that the tribunal considered and rejected the\n                    plaintiffs’ separate cases on these main issues, leaving no basis on which\n                    to set aside the award. The defendants also maintain that the tribunal did have\n                    the jurisdiction to determine all of the issues which it did. Further, the\n                    defendants contend that the Funds submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of\n                    the tribunal voluntarily and without qualification, and therefore cannot be\n                    heard to complain about the result. 16     Having considered the parties’ written\n                    and oral submissions and the material that the parties have placed before me, I\n                    allow all three applications and set aside the award in its entirety. I now set\n                    out my reasons.",
        "Background": "17     As I have alluded to above, at the heart of\n                    the parties’ dispute is the question of how the existence of unpaid taxes\n                    over the Corporation’s property sold to the defendants under the APA\n                    affected the parties’ rights and obligations under the APA and,\n                    separately, under the notes. Before I deal with that issue, however, it is\n                    useful to flesh out the facts in a little more detail.",
        "The Corporation goes into liquidation": "18     In 1999, the Corporation filed a petition with\n                    the Securities Commission of Moria (“the Commission”) seeking to\n                    suspend payments on its liabilities. At that time, the Corporation operated a\n                    plant in Erebor and owned assets in the city of Erebor as well as elsewhere in\n                    Moria. Only the Corporation’s plant and assets in Erebor are relevant for\n                    present purposes. 19     The Corporation then owed approximately\n                    US$337m to its secured creditors. This debt was secured over certain of the\n                    Corporation’s assets by a mortgage trust indenture executed in 1990. The\n                    mortgaged assets included the Corporation’s Mithril plant in Erebor as\n                    well as the movable equipment and some (but not all) of the real properties\n                    which were used directly for the plant’s operations. 20     In 2000, the Commission declared the\n                    Corporation insolvent and placed it in liquidation, in one of the largest\n                    liquidations in the history of Moria. Eventually, the liquidator took office and\n                    the Corporation’s assets were transferred to him to hold as trustee. In\n                    2001, the liquidator submitted a liquidation plan to the Commission. This plan\n                    was subsequently approved in 2003. Under the plan, the liquidator grouped the\n                    Corporation’s assets into two categories: (a)     “The Plant Assets”\n                        comprising the Corporation’s assets. These are the assets which the\n                        defendants eventually acquired under the APA; and (b)     “The Retained Assets”\n                        comprising all of the Corporation’s remaining\n                assets. 21     The Plant Assets were further grouped into two\n                    sub-categories: (a)     The Mithril plant, machinery,\n                        equipment and other items (“the Plant Non-Land Assets”);\n                        and (b)     Four\n                        parcels of land on which these assets were situated (“the Plant Land\n                        Assets”). These four parcels of land were allocated “ten tax\n                        declaration numbers”. 22     Under the liquidation plan, the secured\n                    creditors of the Corporation were to give up their rights under the existing\n                    mortgage trust indenture in exchange for a new mortgage indenture. The new\n                    indenture was to create security over the same property as the existing\n                    indenture but would include two additional parcels of land. In exchange for the\n                    new indenture, however, the secured creditors of the Corporation had to accept a\n                    discount on their debt and had to waive their right to make claims against the\n                    Retained Assets for any shortfall between the undiscounted amount of their debt\n                    and the amount they received under the liquidation plan. 23     The liquidation plan was designed to allow the\n                    liquidator to pay off two different sets of creditors. The Plant Assets\n                        (ie, the first group of the\n                    Corporation’s assets) would be sold as an integral facility to a\n                    prospective buyer so that the buyer could resume operations as soon as possible\n                    after acquisition. The hope was that a sale in this manner would enable the\n                    Plant Assets to fetch a better price in total than if its individual parts were\n                    sold separately. The sale proceeds from the Plant Assets would then be applied\n                    against the discounted debt due to the Corporation’s secured creditors.\n                    The Retained Assets would be sold separately, with the proceeds applied against\n                    the unsecured debts of the Corporation.",
        "Galaxy agrees to purchase the Plant Assets": "24     The liquidation plan was eventually approved\n                    and the liquidator called a tender for the Plant Assets. Galaxy won the tender\n                    in 2003. The liquidator, the secured creditors and the shareholders reached a\n                    basic agreement with Galaxy on the terms of the sale of the Plant Assets. The\n                    parties were keen to give Galaxy possession of the Plant Assets quickly so that\n                    it could begin rehabilitating the plant and resume production as soon as\n                    possible. The parties therefore entered into a memorandum of agreement\n                    (“the MOA”) on 29 January 2004. 25     The MOA was intended only to record the basic\n                    terms and conditions of the parties’ agreement. The parties planned to\n                    enter into a more comprehensive agreement later which was “to be\n                    negotiated, executed, and implemented in good faith by the Parties in respect of\n                    the … sale and purchase of the … [the Plant Assets], upon\n                    substantially the same terms and conditions agreed upon by the Parties [in the\n                    MOA]”.",
        "The Memorandum of Agreement": "26     Under s 2.2 of the MOA, Galaxy agreed to\n                    acquire the Plant Assets with clean title except as provided in s 4.2(h).\n                    Under s 4.2(h), the liquidator represented that the Plant Assets were\n                    encumbered by,inter alia, “claims of\n                    … the [Lorien]/[Celeborn] group, and the unpaid realty tax due on [the\n                    Plant Assets], which may affect clean title over some or all of [the Plant\n                    Assets]”. I refer to the separate claims of the Lorien/Celeborn group as\n                    “the Lorien Claim” and “the Celeborn\n                Claim”. 27     Under s 3.2(a) of the MOA, the parties\n                    agreed that the consideration for the Plant Assets would be approximately\n                    US$300m. That consideration was to take the form of (i) an initial down-payment\n                    of an equivalent of US$22m and (ii) the issuance of the two notes for the\n                    equivalent of the remaining US$278m, payable by equal instalments over eight\n                    years. Under s 3.2(b) of the MOA, the parties agreed that the initial\n                    down-payment for the Plant Assets was to be paid to the liquidator who would\n                    then pay the secured creditors and shareholders in accordance with an agreement\n                    to be executed amongst them. It appears that the terms and conditions of the\n                    notes were not yet finalised when the parties executed the MOA, as nopro formanotes were annexed to it. 28     Under s 5.3(c) of the MOA, the liquidator\n                    agreed that “[d]uring the effectivity of [the MOA]” (ie, so long as the MOA remained in place), the\n                    liquidator would “apply for the waiver by all appropriate Governmental\n                    Authority of all tax liabilities of [the Corporation] affecting any or all of\n                    [the Plant Assets], including but not limited to the liability for income and/or\n                    real estate taxes”. 29     Section 9 of the MOA sets out the dispute\n                    resolution provisions. It reads as follows: DISPUTE RESOLUTION 9.1 Amicable Settlement Any dispute or controversy of any kind whatsoever arising between or among\n                        the Parties (such dispute or controversy being referred to herein as a\n                        “Dispute”) in respect of all matters relating to or in\n                        connection with this [MOA] and also in all matters concerning the provisions\n                        of this [MOA] and the performance of the obligations provided herein, shall\n                        be settled amicably by mutual consultations between or among the Parties as\n                        far as practicable. 9.2 Arbitration If the Dispute cannot be settled amicably within thirty (30) days by\n                        amicable settlement, the same shall be resolved through arbitration in\n                        accordance with the arbitration rules of the Singapore International\n                        Arbitration Centre for the time being in force. ...",
        "The legislative body of Erebor passes the Tax Ordinance": "30     When the Corporation filed for insolvency with\n                    the Commission in 1999, it owed substantial sums of taxes on its real property,\n                    on its plant and on its machinery to the municipal authorities in Erebor.\n                    Further taxes continued to accrue during the liquidation:ie, while the liquidation plan was formulated and approved and\n                    thereafter. Thus, the Corporation owed real property taxes to Erebor in respect\n                    of (i) the Plant Assets that were the subject of the MOA and (ii) the Retained\n                    Assets which would remain with the liquidator. In addition, the failure of the\n                    Corporation to pay these real property taxes on time meant that a large amount\n                    of interest and penalties also continued to accrue on the unpaid\n                taxes. 31     From the terms and conditions of the MOA\n                    described above, it is clear that all of the parties were aware of these tax\n                    liabilities. In fact, a few days after the parties signed the MOA, Galaxy asked\n                    the liquidator to apply to Erebor to waive the unpaid taxes affecting the Plant\n                    Assets or (although this was not strictly an obligation of the liquidator under\n                    the MOA) to settle all such unpaid taxes if a waiver could not be\n                    obtained. 32     AKP is a secured creditor of the Corporation\n                    and is the first plaintiff in Originating Summons No. [M]. On 13 July 2004, AKP\n                    wrote, on behalf of all secured creditors including itself, to the municipal\n                    legislative body in Erebor (“the SP”). AKP emphasised to the SP,\n                    among other things, the need to provide “a conducive and peaceful\n                    investment environment” in order to facilitate the “successful\n                    rehabilitation and operation” of [the Corporation’s Mithril plant]\n                    which was a crucial pillar of the Erebor economy. AKP therefore asked the SP to\n                    grant “a condonation and/or waiver … of the unpaid business and\n                    property taxes affecting [the Plant Assets]”. 33     On 28 July 2004, the liquidator followed up on\n                    AKP’s request. Galaxy’s in-house counsel agreed to prepare a draft\n                    resolution waiving the Corporation’s unpaid realty taxes. The liquidator\n                    hoped that the SP would pass that draft into law. 34     The draft resolution did not have the desired\n                    effect on the SP. In fact, it had quite the opposite effect. On 3 August 2004,\n                    the SP passed a resolution requiring Erebor’s city treasurer to levy\n                    execution on all of the Corporation’s properties for unpaid taxes. The SP\n                    drew the conclusion that the liquidator would have sufficient funds in hand to\n                    pay the outstanding real property taxes in full as a result of the sale of the\n                    Plant Assets to Galaxy. 35     On 7 September 2004, the SP had a change of\n                    heart. It now passed the Tax Ordinance. The Tax Ordinance enabled Erebor until\n                    31 December 2004 to grant tax relief to taxpayers who were in arrears (such as\n                    the Corporation) by waiving accrued interest and penalties on their unpaid real\n                    property taxes. Securing that waiver required the principal amount of all unpaid\n                    taxes to be paid on 1 December 2004 or at any later time permitted by the city\n                    treasurer. 36     Any taxpayer who obtained tax relief under the\n                    Tax Ordinance had to comply with the strict requirements of s 6 of the Tax\n                    Ordinance and keep current on all tax falling due during the period of relief.\n                    Section 6 provides as follows: SECTION 6. Any taxpayer who incurs further delinquency in the payment of\n                        their current real property taxes while still paying its real property tax\n                        obligations due up to 2004 or its approved extended period, and failure to\n                        comply with the terms and conditions on the granting of extension to pay\n                        their basic real property tax delinquency shall lose the benefit of this\n                        relief under [the Tax Ordinance], and all penalties and interests waived\n                        and/or subject of this amnesty would be restored and become immediately due\n                        and demandable from said delinquent taxpayers. In other words, the taxpayer had to keep up to date with both\n                        (i) its current taxes (which were not subject to any tax relief) as well as\n                        (ii) its past tax obligations (ie, the unpaid\n                        taxes which were the subject of the tax relief). Any failure to make timely\n                        payment of either category of taxes would mean that the taxpayer would lose\n                        the benefit of the relief granted under the Tax\n                Ordinance.",
        "The Asset Purchase Agreement": "37     On 10 September 2004, three days after the SP\n                    passed the Tax Ordinance, the defendants (ie,\n                    subsidiaries of Galaxy), the liquidator, the secured creditors and the\n                    shareholders formalised the sale and purchase of the Plant Assets under the MOA\n                    by entering into the APA. 38     Section 2.1 of the APA reads: Sale and Purchase of [the Plant Assets] Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this APA, [the defendants]\n                        agree to purchase from [the liquidator], [the secured creditors] and [the\n                        shareholders], and [the liquidator], [the secured creditors] and [the\n                        shareholders] agree to sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to [the\n                        defendants], on the Closing Date, [the Plant Assets], free from and clear of\n                        all Liens of any kind, which sale and purchase shall be implemented in such\n                        a way as to allow the Parties to avail of the benefits of [a certain\n                        provision of Morian law] … ... 39     Under s 3 of the APA, the defendants\n                    agreed to pay the purchase price for the Plant Assets to the secured creditors\n                    and the liquidator by: (a)     making a US$22m down-payment to the\n                        liquidator; and (b)     issuing two zero coupon notes in the aggregate principal amount of US$278m\n                        to the secured creditors and to the shareholders. The principal under the\n                        notes was payable over a period of eight years. The terms and conditions of\n                        these notes were set out in the OMNA (a draft of which was annexed to the\n                        APA). 40     In order to secure its payment obligations,\n                    the defendants agreed under s 4 of the APA:(i) to issue stand-by letters of\n                    credit (“SLCs”) and (ii) to execute the new mortgage trust\n                    indenture (described above at [22]) in favour of the secured\n                creditors. 41     The security interest created by the new\n                    indenture expressly envisaged that the defendants could seek new secured\n                    financing to be secured over the same assetspari\n                        passu. Thus, under s 4.2(b) of the APA, the defendants were\n                    entitled to use the Plant Assets, encumbered under the new indenture, as\n                    security for new loans or credit facilities up to US$86m. In addition, that\n                    limit of US$86m could be increased by the amount of any payment or prepayment of\n                    the purchase price. New lenders would be issued mortgage participation\n                    certificates under which their right to repayment would be securedpari passuby the new indenture. In other words, the\n                    parties envisaged that the defendants would need additional secured financing to\n                    rehabilitate the plant and permitted them to obtain that financing subject to\n                    the new lenders standing on the same footing as all other secured creditors in\n                    their security rights over the Plant Assets. 42     At the time of closing, there were several\n                    outstanding claims against the Plant Assets. The parties agreed under the APA\n                    that the secured creditors should be responsible for settling two of these\n                    claims,ie, the Lost Land Claims mentioned in\n                    passing above at [7]. This claim will be discussed in greater detail at [213] to\n                    [242] below. 43     Under s 7.2 of the APA, the liquidator\n                    made certain representations and warranties to the other parties to the APA\n                    about the status of the Plant Assets. The relevant parts of s 7.2 read as\n                    follows: Representations and Warranties of [the liquidator] [The liquidator] hereby represents and warrants to the other Parties as\n                        follows: … (f) To the best of his knowledge and after due inquiry, no event has\n                        occurred and is continuing which might materially and adversely affect the\n                        carrying out of [the liquidator’s] obligations under this APA other\n                        than those which have been disclosed in writing at the time of this\n                        APA. (g) [The defendants] will acquire [the Plant Assets] completely free from\n                        and clear of all claims, Liens and encumbrances of whatever kind and\n                        nature. … (i) There are no unpaid taxes which have accrued or will accrue on or\n                        prior to the Closing Date which constitute or at any time on or after the\n                        Closing Date will constitute a Lien on [the Plant Assets]. (j) [The defendants] will have no liability whatsoever for or in\n                        connection with any taxes in respect of [the Plant Assets] for any period on\n                        or prior to the Closing Date, and all such liabilities will be duly\n                        discharged by [the liquidator]. … (n) At the Closing, full legal and valid title and ownership over [the\n                        Plant Assets] will be transferred and conveyed to [the defendants] free from\n                        and clear of all claims, Liens, and encumbrances whatsoever. 44     The parties agreed that the warranties and\n                    representations above were true and correct as at the date of signing and were\n                    deemed to be repeated on the date of closing. I should point out that the above\n                    warranties and representations were given against the background of the Tax\n                    Ordinance. This is clear from s 7.2(j) of the APA where the liquidator\n                    represented that the taxes owing on the Plant Assets for the period prior to\n                    closing “will be duly discharged.” Although it is phrased as a\n                    representation, the liquidator promised by that provision to discharge these\n                    taxes following on or prior to the closing. 45     The dispute resolution provisions of the APA\n                    are central to one of the issues in the applications. I will consider them in\n                    greater detail at [243] to [265] below.",
        "The liquidator obtains the Tax Amnesty Agreement": "46     Several conditions precedent set out in\n                    s 5.3(b) of the APA had to be satisfied before the defendants came under an\n                    obligation to execute the necessary documents to bring about the closing of the\n                    transaction. I will go on to discuss some of the relevant conditions precedent\n                    later. For the time being I shall focus on s 5.3(b)(iii)(4), which\n                    reads: (iii) [The liquidator] shall have delivered to [the defendants], in form\n                        and substance reasonably satisfactory to [the defendants] and their counsel,\n                        the following: … (4) A copy of the agreement duly signed by the appropriate Governmental\n                        Authority approving a deferred payment scheme for the unpaid realty taxes\n                        affecting [the Plant Assets]. ... 47     I ought now to explain the significance of\n                    this condition precedent. As mentioned above, the parties signed the APA on 10\n                    September 2004. That was three days after the Tax Ordinance was passed. Closing\n                    under the APA was originally scheduled to take place on 8 October 2004. However,\n                    the parties were unable to close on that day because this condition precedent\n                    had not yet been satisfied. The parties therefore agreed to delay the closing\n                    until 15 October 2004. 48     On 1 October 2004, the liquidator wrote to\n                    Erebor’s city mayor to seek relief under the Tax Ordinance from having to\n                    pay interest and penalties on the Corporation’s unpaid taxes. The\n                    liquidator asked further that the Corporation be allowed to pay its remaining\n                    basic real property tax liability by instalments, beyond 1 December\n                2004. 49     On 11 October 2004, the defendants wrote to\n                    the liquidator, chasing him to obtain “from [the city mayor] a formal\n                    letter of settlement, giving effect to [the Tax Ordinance] passed by his\n                    council”. 50     On 13 October 2004, the city treasurer and the\n                    city mayor sent the liquidator a crucial letter. This is the letter which the\n                    parties have called the TAA (first referred to at [5] above). At that time, the\n                    Corporation owed unpaid taxes amounting to about US$4m on all of its properties\n                    in Erebor. The TAA granted the Corporation relief from the payment of interest\n                    and penalties for these unpaid taxes and permitted the Corporation to settle\n                    them in eight equal instalments of an equivalent of US$500,000. Each instalment\n                    was to be paid every December between 2004 and 2012 (save for 2005). The TAA\n                    therefore covered tax arrears over both the Plant Assets and the Retained\n                    Assets. The TAA permitted the Corporation to pay its taxes by instalments rather\n                    than requiring a lump sum payment in total discharge. Thus, Erebor did not waive\n                    the principal amount of tax liability but simply deferred the payment of unpaid\n                    tax to permit the agreed instalment plan and without imposing any penalties or\n                    interest as a result of the deferred payment. 51     The TAA also made it clear that there would be\n                    serious consequences if the annual instalments of tax were not paid. As\n                    mentioned above, under s 6 of the Tax Ordinance, all deferred tax would\n                    become immediately due and demandable together with all penalties and interest\n                    that had been previously waived if the taxpayer failed to pay its current\n                    liability for any tax or failed to pay an instalment due against its deferred\n                    past tax liabilities. Put another way the TAA would be revoked should the\n                    current taxes or past taxes on both the Plant Assets and the Retained Assets not\n                    be paid on time. Two consequences followed from the revocation of the\n                    TAA: (a)     the instalment payments on all\n                        previous unpaid taxes would all become due and payable at once;\n                    and (b)     the amount of\n                        all tax payable on all the Corporation’s properties (that is, the\n                        Plant Assets and the Retained Assets) would balloon to include all the\n                        interest and penalties previously waived. 52     It is not disputed that the liquidator’s\n                    delivery of the TAA to the defendants satisfied the condition precedent in\n                    s 5.3(b)(iii)(4) of the APA (see [46] above).",
        "The close of the transaction": "53     The closing took place as rescheduled on 15\n                    October 2004. At closing, the parties executed and delivered several documents\n                    which have significance for the parties’ dispute. The parties execute the Omnibus Agreement and the defendants issue\n                the notes 54     First, the defendants and the secured\n                    creditors (but not the liquidator) entered into the OMNA which sets out the\n                    terms and conditions upon which the secured creditors agreed to accept the\n                    notes. 55     I make the following observations about the\n                    OMNA: (a)     The OMNA provided a mechanism for\n                        the defendants to “set off from time to time any claims it may have\n                        against any [secured creditor of the Corporation]” against the amount\n                        that each secured creditor was due under the notes: s 4.01(a) of the\n                        OMNA. (b)     Pursuant\n                        to s 6.01(e) of the OMNA, the defendants undertook that so long as the\n                        notes remained outstanding, it would duly pay all tax levied on its\n                        properties: Taxes– Duly pay and discharge\n                            all legal and valid taxes, assessments and charges of whatsoever nature\n                            levied upon it or against its properties by any Governmental Authority\n                            prior to the date on which penalties attach thereto, and also pay and\n                            discharge when due all lawful claims which, if unpaid, might become a\n                            lien or charge upon any of the its [sic]\n                            properties … For avoidance of doubt, this provision shall not\n                            cover unpaid realty taxes and business taxes and/or fees already\n                            existing prior to the purchase by [the defendants] of [the Plant Assets]\n                            and which taxes continue to be the liability of [the Corporation] and/or\n                            [the liquidator] in accordance with the terms of the [APA]. (c)     The OMNA provided\n                        at s 9.04 that the secured creditors were entitled to assign all or any\n                        portion of their rights and obligations under the OMNA or under any other\n                        “Relevant Document”. That term was defined to include the\n                        notes, the SLCs, the new mortgage indenture and other documents required or\n                        otherwise contemplated to be executed pursuant to the\n                    OMNA. (d)     The OMNA\n                        contained a distinct dispute-resolution mechanism from the one in the APA. I\n                        shall describe this further at [248]. 56     The defendants issued the two notes on the\n                    same day, 15 October 2004. They are described as the Tranche A note and the\n                    Tranche B note. Other documents executed or delivered at closing 57     Second, the liquidator, the secured creditors\n                    and the shareholders agreed formally to amend a Purchase Price Sharing Agreement\n                    (“the PPSA”) which they had previously executed on 10 September\n                    2004. The PPSA regulated the manner in which the interested stakeholders would\n                    share in the payments made by the defendants and was one of the conditions\n                    precedent required by the defendants before closing could take place. Under the\n                    amendment to the PPSA, the parties agreed that the liquidator could use part of\n                    the defendants’ initial down-payment of about US$22m to pay the first of\n                    the eight instalments due to Erebor under the TAA. 58     Third, by a letter dated 15 October 2004, the\n                    secured creditors agreed to guarantee the instalment payments under the\n                    TAA: [s]ubject to the prompt receipt of payment on the Tranche A and Tranche B\n                        Notes from [the defendants], the Secured Creditors, through the Facility\n                        Agent, likewise guaranty the payment of the deferred Real Property Taxes\n                        which has been accepted by the Mayor of the City of [Erebor] in his letter\n                        dated 13 October 2004. 59     The liquidator maintains that he gave this\n                    letter to the defendants in order to satisfy his obligation under the condition\n                    precedent to closing in s 5.3(b)(iii)(6) of the APA. Indeed, the liquidator\n                    maintains that this was the only document the defendants asked for to satisfy\n                    that condition precedent. Section 5.3(b)(iii)(6) reads: (iii) [The liquidator] shall have delivered to [the defendants], in form\n                        and substance reasonably satisfactory to [the defendants] and their counsel,\n                        the following: ... (6) Such other documents as [the defendants] may reasonably require from\n                        [the liquidator] prior to Closing Date to give [the defendants] full, good,\n                        legal, valid, and valuable title to [the Plant Assets] and to enable [the\n                        defendants] to become registered owners thereof free from and clear of all\n                        claims, Liens, and encumbrances. ... 60     Fourth, the liquidator’s legal counsel\n                    issued a legal opinion for the benefit of the defendants which stated its\n                    opinion that “[a]t Closing, full legal and valid ownership of, and to,\n                    [the Plant Assets] shall be transferred and conveyed to [the defendants], free\n                    from and clear of all claims, liens and encumbrances, except as previously\n                    disclosed”. This legal opinion addressed the condition precedent at\n                    s 5.3(b)(iii)(8) of the APA which required: [a] legal opinion issued by the legal counsel of [the liquidator]\n                        satisfactory to [the defendants] and the legal counsel of [the defendants]\n                        that ... at Closing, full legal and valid ownership of, and to, [the Plant\n                        Assets] shall be transferred and conveyed to [the defendants] free from and\n                        clear of all claims, Liens and encumbrances whatsoever ...",
        "Disputes over the unpaid realty taxes after closing": "61     Three different categories of taxes were due\n                    to Erebor which are relevant for present purposes. 62     The first category of taxes I shall refer to\n                    as the “Pre-Closing Taxes”. These taxes consisted of the arrears\n                    of the taxes accrued from 1999 to 15 October 2004, the closing date, over all of\n                    the Corporation’sreal property. The\n                    Pre-Closing Taxes therefore related to all of the Corporation’s real\n                    property, whether that real property was comprised in the Plant Assets or in the\n                    Retained Assets. The Pre-Closing Taxes remained the responsibility of the\n                    liquidator despite closing pursuant to his warranty and representation in\n                    s 7.2(j) of the APA that “all such liabilities will be duly\n                    discharged by [the liquidator]”. 63     The second category of taxes I shall refer to\n                    as the “Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes”. These taxes comprised\n                    amongst other things, (i) ten tax declaration numbers over the four parcels of\n                    land which formed the Plant Land Assets; and (ii) real property taxes over Plant\n                    Non-Land Assets. I observe at this point that even though the Plant Land Assets\n                    were transferred to the defendants at closing, title could not immediately be\n                    registered in the defendants’ name. The Plant Land Assets thus remained\n                    registered in the Corporation’s name even after closing. As far as\n                    Erebor’s municipal authorities were concerned, therefore, the Corporation\n                    remained the registered owner and therefore the taxpayer responsible for the\n                    Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes. Further, unlike the Pre-Closing Taxes, the APA\n                    was silent as to who was liable for the Post-Closing Plant Asset\n                Taxes. 64     The third category of taxes I shall refer to\n                    as the “Post-Closing Retained Assets Taxes”. These taxes were\n                    payable on the Retained Assets (ie, all of the\n                    Corporation’s assets which were not sold to the defendants) which remained\n                    in the name of and administered by the liquidator. 65     In early 2005, the liquidator and the secured\n                    creditors became embroiled in disputes with Erebor over the taxes that were\n                    payable in respect of the Plant Assets and the Retained Assets as well as the\n                    defendants’ application for various tax exemptions. I will touch on this\n                    in greater detail later in this judgment. For now, it suffices to note that\n                    there were two main disputes: (a)     The first related to the first\n                        instalment of the Pre-Closing Taxes (the first category of relevant taxes)\n                        which had been paid by the secured creditors of the Corporation on behalf of\n                        the liquidator in December 2004. (b)     The second related to the payment of the Post-Closing\n                        Plant Assets Taxes (the second category of relevant\n                    taxes). As a result of these disputes, Erebor\n                        eventually revoked the TAA, with disastrous consequences for the\n                        parties’ transaction. 66     In 2005 and 2006, the defendants, the\n                    liquidator and the secured creditors entered into negotiations with Erebor\n                    concerning the outstanding taxes over the Plant Assets. Those efforts were\n                    unsuccessful. In November 2006, Erebor declared that it intended to conduct a\n                    public auction of the Plant Assets in order to satisfy the tax arrears. The\n                    liquidator made an urgent application to the Commission and secured an order on\n                    30 November 2006 enjoining the city treasurer from proceeding with the auction.\n                    As a result, the auction was forestalled. 67     On 14 October 2008, the city treasurer applied\n                    to the Commission for permission to conduct a forced sale of the Plant Assets.\n                    By an order dated 17 November 2008 made pursuant to an application by the\n                    liquidator, the Commission denied the city treasurer’s\n                application.",
        "The Funds purchase the notes on the secondary market": "68     While all this was going on, through a number\n                    of transactions between 2005 and 2008, the Funds purchased in the secondary\n                    market the right to receive payments under the notes. They currently hold\n                    22.2254% of the Tranche A note and 17.7804% of the Tranche B note.",
        "Events leading up to the commencement of arbitration": "69     The defendants paid the first two instalments\n                    under the terms of the notes in 2006 and 2007.[note: 1]However, shortly before it was\n                    due to pay the third instalment under the notes on 15 October 2008, it filed an\n                    application before a Morian court on 9 October 2008 seeking an injunction\n                    restraining AKP (the first plaintiff in Originating Summons No [M] and the\n                    facility agent of the notes for the secured creditors) from: (a)     issuing a certification that the\n                        payment due under the APA and OMNA has not been received; (b)     declaring the defendants to be in\n                        default under the APA and OMNA; and (c)     encashing one of the SLCs. AKP opposed the defendants’ application for an injunction. On\n                        10 October 2008, the Morian court dismissed the defendants’\n                        application. On the same day, the defendants commenced the\n                        arbitration.",
        "Procedural skirmishes leading to a temporary injunction": "70     The parties then engaged in two years of\n                    procedural skirmishes in the Singapore courts which culminated in the defendants\n                    securing an interim injunction which (i) restrained the secured creditors from\n                    declaring the defendants to be in default under the APA, the notes and the OMNA,\n                    (ii) restrained the secured creditors from declaring the purchase price or the\n                    unpaid principal under the notes to be due and payable and (iii) suspended the\n                    defendants’ payment obligations under the notes and its obligation to\n                    provide further security by way of further SLCs. The Singapore Court of Appeal\n                    also directed that any future applications to vary or discharge the interim\n                    injunction be heard by the tribunal rather than by the courts. 71     On 7 July 2010, the tribunal upheld the\n                    interim injunction but made it clear that AKP (as the facility agent for the\n                    secured creditors) was free to contend during the substantive hearing that the\n                    tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to impose a permanent injunction to\n                    equivalent effect.",
        "The arbitration": "72     In the arbitration, the defendants’\n                    position on the substantive dispute was that the liquidator and the secured\n                    creditors’ failure to pay the Pre-Closing Taxes (ie, the first category of taxes) rendered the Plant Assets\n                    subject to a statutory lien in favour of Erebor. As a result, the defendants\n                    claimed that the liquidator and the secured creditors had breached their\n                    obligations under the APA to deliver the Plant Assets with clean title and had\n                    also breached a number of related representations and warranties given in the\n                    APA (some of these provision have already been canvassed above). 73     The defendants also claimed that the\n                    liquidator: (a)     failed to specify to the city\n                        treasurer that the first instalment payment under the TAA was to be applied\n                        to the unpaid taxes in relation to the Plant Assets (ie, the assets that were transferred to the defendants) and\n                        not to the Retained Assets; and (b)     failed to comply with the TAA by failing to pay the\n                        Post-Closing Retained Assets Taxes (the third category of taxes; see [64]\n                        above), which led to the revocation of the TAA. 74     As a result, the defendants claimed that the\n                    Plant Assets remained encumbered and that the relevant authorities refused to\n                    issue the requisite tax clearances to the defendants. This in turn meant that\n                    title to the Plant Assets was not clean. The lack of clean title, according to\n                    the defendants, meant that it was unable to obtain loans from banks to finance\n                    the modernisation and rehabilitation works which the Plant Assets needed,\n                    ultimately causing the defendants to lose substantial profits. 75     Separately, the defendants also claimed that\n                    the secured creditors had, in breach of the APA, failed to settle two civil\n                    claims in respect of a plot of land which formed part of the PlantLandAssets (the Lost Land Claims referred to at [7]\n                    above). The defendants sought to be indemnified against the consequences of this\n                    breach. 76     As a result of all of this, the defendants\n                    claimed in the arbitration the following relief: (a)     A declaration that the liquidator,\n                        the secured creditors and shareholders were in breach of the APA in that\n                        they had failed to pay accrued taxes on the Plant Assets or failed to\n                        deliver them free of encumbrances. (b)     An order that the defendants’ obligations to pay\n                        any instalments falling due under the APA, the notes, and to provide any\n                        further SLC or any SLC of increased value, be suspended, deferred and/or\n                        postponed until the liquidator and the secured creditors deliver the Plant\n                        Assets with clean title. (c)     An order that the liquidator and the secured creditors be\n                        restrained and/or enjoined from declaring the defendants in default for\n                        non-payment of “the next instalment of the Purchase Price falling due\n                        on and the provision of the New SLC on 15 October\n                    2008”.

        "The tribunal’s decision": "77     The tribunal found in favour of the defendants\n                    in its award. In summary, it held that: (i) the liquidator and the secured\n                    creditors had a joint and several obligation to transfer the Plant Assets to the\n                    defendants free from any encumbrances, which included tax liens; (ii) the tax\n                    lien which encumbered the Plant Assets meant that the liquidator was in breach\n                    of its warranty and representation under the APA to deliver clean title to the\n                    Plant Assets on closing or soon after closing; (iii) the secured creditors were\n                    jointly and severally liable with the liquidator for this breach of the APA;\n                    (iv) the secured creditors were in breach of their obligation to settle the Lost\n                    Land Claims and accordingly were obliged to indemnify the defendants against it;\n                    and (v) the tribunal had the jurisdiction to suspend the defendants’\n                    obligations under the APA to make payment and provide further security and\n                    therefore to enjoin the secured creditors from declaring the defendants in\n                    default of those obligations (which are in fact found under the notes and the\n                    OMNA). 78     As a result, the tribunal granted the\n                    defendants relief which includes the following: (a)     It awarded the defendants US$80m in\n                        damages representing compensation for an opportunity to earn profits which\n                        it lost as a result of the liquidator’s failure to transfer clean\n                        title to the Plant Assets. (b)     It awarded the defendants the equivalent of about\n                        US$23.7m by way of an indemnity in respect of the Lost Land\n                    Claims. (c)     It granted\n                        the relief sought by the defendants at [76(b)] and [76(c)] above in respect\n                        of its payment and security obligations under the notes and the\n                    OMNA.",
        "(1) The liquidator and the secured creditors were jointly and\n                severally obliged under the APA to sell the Plant Assets to the defendants": "79     I pause at this point briefly to consider the\n                    tribunal’s reasons for awarding the defendants US$80m in\n                damages. 80     After reviewing the provisions of the APA and\n                    the mechanics of the sale which it contemplated, the tribunal concluded that the\n                    liquidator and the secured creditors were jointly and severally obliged under\n                    the APA to sell the Plant Assets to the defendants.",
        "(2) The liquidator was in breach of the warranty and representation\n                to deliver clean title to the Plant Assets": "81     The tribunal concluded that the liquidator had\n                    an obligation to transfer clean title to the Plant Assets and that this\n                    obligation was not qualified in any way by the TAA. 82     In particular, the tribunal rejected the\n                    possibility that the TAA qualified the obligation of the liquidator and of the\n                    secured creditors under the TAA to deliver clean title to the Plant Assets\n                    because what the defendants required commercially was unencumbered title to the\n                    Plant Assets which it could use as security for future borrowing. 83     In the tribunal’s view, the surest (and\n                    possibly the only) way in which the liquidator and the secured creditors could\n                    have obtained title capable of being transferred to the defendants free from\n                    encumbrances (that is, clean title) was by paying all taxes due as at 31\n                    December 2004 using the initial down-payment. They had failed to do this because\n                    of the way in which they had agreed under the PPSA to deal with the\n                    down-payment. The tribunal held that whatever the parties to the PPSA had agreed\n                    under that agreement was none of the defendants’ concern since it was not\n                    a party to it.",
        "(3) The defendants lost the opportunity to earn increased\n                profits": "84     After finding that the liquidator had breached\n                    his obligations under the APA and that the liquidator and the secured creditors\n                    were jointly and severally liable for this breach, the tribunal then turned to\n                    deal with the issue of damages. It took the view that although the\n                    defendants’ claim was advanced as a claim for profits actually lost, the\n                    claim was “better considered as a claim for the loss of an opportunity to\n                    make increased profits”. The tribunal therefore considered the\n                    defendants’ damages claim on that basis. The tribunal then split on the\n                    quantum of the ultimate damage suffered by the defendants. The majority held\n                    that it was a loss of an opportunity to earn profits of US$140m. The minority\n                    concluded that it was the loss of an opportunity to earn profits of US$95.616m.\n                    The tribunal attached a probability of 55% to this opportunity. The majority\n                    therefore used its figure to assess the compensation for this lost opportunity\n                    as 55% of US$140m, or US$80m.",
        "The plaintiffs’ complaints": "85     The liquidator’s case in his application\n                    is as follows: (a)     The tribunal breached the rules of\n                        natural justice or the liquidator was unable to present his case on the\n                        following matters: (i)       whether the\n                            liquidator’s obligation under ss 2.1 and 7.2 of the APA was\n                            qualified by the TAA; (ii)       whether the defendants were responsible for the\n                            payment of the Post-Closing Taxes in 2005 and caused the TAA to be\n                            revoked; and (iii)       whether the defendants suffered damage\n                            characterised as the loss of an opportunity to earn\n                        profits. (b)     The issue of the loss of an opportunity to earn profits was never submitted\n                        to the tribunal for determination and the tribunal had thus exceeded the\n                        scope of its jurisdiction. As a result,\n                        the liquidator contends that the tribunal’s award should be set aside\n                        in its entirety. In the alternative, the liquidator contends that the\n                        tribunal’s award of damages in the sum of US$80m should be set\n                        aside. 86     The secured creditors advance a case in their\n                    application which is similar to that advanced by the liquidator at [85(a)(ii)],\n                    [85(a)(iii)] and [85(b)] above: (a)     The tribunal breached the rules of\n                        natural justice by not giving the secured creditors a fair hearing on the\n                        issue of whether the defendants were responsible for the TAA being\n                        revoked. (b)     The\n                        tribunal awarded damages for the loss of an opportunity to earn profits in\n                        circumstances where the defendants had never submitted any such claim to\n                        arbitration and where the tribunal failed to afford the secured creditors\n                        the opportunity to address the tribunal on this point. The secured creditors argue that the award should be set aside\n                        in its entirety on these grounds. 87     In addition, the secured creditors argue the\n                    award should be set aside in its entirety on the basis that the tribunal did not\n                    give the secured creditors a fair hearing on the Lost Land Claims. 88     Further, the secured creditors advance an\n                    additional point which is unique to their position: they argue that the tribunal\n                    acted in excess of its jurisdiction by assuming jurisdiction in relation to\n                    matters under, and in granting relief under and in respect of, the OMNA and the\n                    notes. These matters fell outside the ambit of the parties’ arbitration\n                    agreement under the APA. As a result, the parts of the award which restrain the\n                    secured creditors from calling an event of default under the notes should be set\n                    aside. 89     The Funds in their application adopt these\n                    arguments of the secured creditors and of the liquidator. In addition, they\n                    argue that even though they voluntarily applied to be joined as a party to the\n                    arbitration, the defendants never sought to claim that the Funds, as assignees\n                    of rights under the notes and/or the OMNA in the secondary market, were liable\n                    under theAPA. By determining that the Funds are\n                    jointly and severally liable along with the secured creditor to the defendants\n                    under theAPA, the tribunal dealt with an issue or\n                    dispute that was not contemplated by the submission to arbitration and/or the\n                    tribunal breached the rules of natural justice by making its determination\n                    against the Funds without first giving them an opportunity to be heard or to\n                    present their case on why they should not be liable. Accordingly, the award\n                    should be set aside on against the Funds on the basis of an excess of\n                    jurisdiction or on natural justice grounds.",
        "Issues to be decided": "90     The argument above can be distilled into a\n                    total of seven issues for determination. The following five issues were common\n                    to all three applications: (a)     Did the tribunal fail to consider\n                        the liquidator’s arguments, evidence and submissions on whether the\n                        ss 2.1 and 7.1 of the APA were qualified by the TAA (“Issue\n                        1”)? (b)     Did\n                        the tribunal fail to consider the liquidator’s and the secured\n                        creditors’ arguments, evidence and submissions on the issue of whether\n                        the defendants were responsible for the revocation of the TAA (“Issue\n                        2”)? (c)     Did\n                        the tribunal, in awarding damages to the defendants for their loss of an\n                        opportunity to earn profits, exceed its powers by dealing with a matter that\n                        had not been submitted to it (“Issue 3”)? (d)     In the alternative to Issue 3, did the\n                        tribunal, in awarding damages to the defendants for its loss of an\n                        opportunity to earn profits fail to give the liquidator and secured\n                        creditors an opportunity to address the tribunal on that question\n                        (“Issue 4”)? (e)     Did the tribunal fail to consider the secured\n                        creditors’ arguments, evidence and submissions in relation to the Lost\n                        Land Claim (“Issue 5”)? 91     The secured creditors’ and the\n                    Funds’ applications raise a separate issue which is common to them, that\n                    is, did the tribunal act in excess of its jurisdiction contrary to Art\n                    34(2)(b)(iii) of the Model Law by granting relief under and in respect of the\n                    OMNA and the notes (“Issue 6”)? 92     The Funds’ application raises one\n                    further issue, unique to the Funds. That is whether the tribunal acted in excess\n                    of its jurisdiction or in breach of natural justice by holding the Funds, as\n                    assignees under the OMNA and the notes, liable alongside the rest of the secured\n                    creditors for breaches of the APA (“Issue 7”). 93     I now deal with the issues in\n                turn.",
        "Issue 1: Did the tribunal fail to consider the liquidator’s\n                arguments, evidence and submissions on whether the ss 2.1 and 7.1 of the APA\n                were qualified by the TAA?": "",
        "The applicable legal principles": "94     A party applying to set aside an award on the\n                    basis that it has been denied natural justice must identify: (a) the relevant\n                    rule of natural justice; (b) how that rule was breached; (c) how the breach was\n                    connected to the making of the award; and (d) how the breach prejudiced his\n                    rights: seeSoh Beng Tee & Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount\n                        Development Pte Ltd[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“Soh Beng Tee”)at [29] andL W\n                        Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another\n                        appeal[2013] 1 SLR 125 (“L W\n                        Infrastructure”) at [48]. 95     The liquidator says that the relevant rule of\n                    natural justice is the right to be heard. Encompassed within this rule is the\n                    sub-rule that an arbitral tribunal cannot disregard submissions or arguments\n                    made by a party without considering them on their merits. The defendants do not\n                    challenge this proposition. I accept it as correct. The parties do not dispute\n                    that if this sub-rule was breached then this would have caused the liquidator\n                    and the secured creditors to have suffered prejudice. Further, the defendants do\n                    not suggest that I ought to remit this issue to the tribunal if I find that\n                    there was a breach of natural justice. Instead, both sides’ submissions\n                    rest on whether this sub-rule was breached at all.",
        "The liquidator’s submissions": "96     Before the tribunal, the liquidator’s\n                    main defence on the issue of liability was that the TAA qualified his obligation\n                    under the APA to deliver clean title to the Plant Assets. The liquidator’s\n                    evidence and submissions in support of this position before the tribunal can be\n                    summarised as follows: (a)     The APA and the documents delivered\n                        pursuant to the conditions precedent to closing must be read\n                        collectively. (b)     All the parties knew from the outset and agreed that Pre-Closing Taxes\n                        would be paid in eight annual instalments from 2004 to 2012 (except for\n                        2005). (c)     It was a\n                        condition precedent to closing under s 5.3(b)(iii)(4) of the APA that\n                        the liquidator deliver to the defendants (in form and substance reasonably\n                        satisfactory to the defendants and their counsel) “[a] copy of the\n                        agreement duly signed by the appropriate Governmental Authority approving a\n                        deferred payment scheme for the unpaid realty taxes affecting [the Plant\n                        Assets]”. It is not disputed that this condition precedent was\n                        fulfilled when the liquidator delivered the TAA to the defendants (see [52]\n                        above). (d)     It was\n                        a condition precedent to closing under s 5.3(b)(iii)(6) of the APA that\n                        the liquidator deliver to the defendants any such documents as “[the\n                        defendants] may reasonably require from [the liquidator] prior to Closing\n                        Date to give [the defendants] full, good, legal, valid and valuable title to\n                        [the Plant Assets] and to enable [the defendants] to become registered owner\n                        thereof free from and clear of all claims, Liens, and encumbrances”.\n                        The only document that the defendants asked for pursuant to this condition\n                        precedent (and which the liquidator duly delivered) was a guarantee from the\n                        secured creditors that the TAA instalments would be paid on time, provided\n                        the defendants promptly paid their instalments under the notes on time (see\n                        [59] above). (e)     The defendants were represented by one of the top law firms in Moria in\n                        negotiating the APA and hence must have received legal advice on the Tax\n                        Ordinance, the TAA and the other closing documents. Mr Y (one of the\n                        defendants’ witnesses) confirmed during cross-examination that it was\n                        the defendants’ lawyers who advised him that the defendants should be\n                        able to obtain registered title to the land which formed part of the Plant\n                        Assets within about two months from closing (thereby allowing them to\n                        mortgage the land to raise financing). (f)     The actions of the defendants prior to the commencement\n                        of the arbitration in 2008 were entirely consistent with the belief that the\n                        Pre-Closing Taxes (which would otherwise give rise to a tax lien) were to be\n                        dealt with exclusively in accordance with the TAA. In fact, the\n                        defendants’ own Morian law expert, Justice A, expressed a similar\n                        view: On 15 October 2004, Closing of the transaction took place on the basis\n                            that [the liquidator and secured creditors] would meet all the payment\n                            obligations under the [TAA]. But to [the defendants’] surprise,\n                            the [the liquidator and secured creditors] did not act in accordance\n                            with the terms of the TAA. ... [The liquidator’s] failure to ensure payment of the first\n                            installment [sic] of the accrued\n                            pre-closing taxes triggered the enforcement claims of the City of\n                            [Erebor] in relation to their lien over [the Plant Assets] ... … The parties considered that for as long as [the liquidator\n                            and secured creditors] comply with the terms of the [TAA] and meet the\n                            scheduled payment provided therein, the property would be left\n                            undisturbed. ... ... ... The provisions on warranty [sic]\n                            should be read together with the provision dealing with the deferred\n                            payment scheme mentioned [at Section 5.3(b)(iii)(4) of the APA]. The\n                            Parties merely stipulated that the accrued taxes on the property were\n                            for the account of [the liquidator and secured creditors] and were to be\n                            settled with the local government under a deferred payment scheme. To\n                            reiterate, the requirement of deferred payment scheme was incorporated\n                            in the contract precisely to protect [the defendants] from the\n                            possibility that should the taxes remain unpaid without any agreement as\n                            to how they are to be settled, the City of [Erebor], at any time, could\n                            sell the property in auction to satisfy its claim. 97     Counsel for the liquidator Mr Yeo points out\n                    that the award does not, on its face, address any of the six points above. From\n                    this, Mr Yeo invites me to draw the inference that the tribunal had either\n                    improperly disregarded or at the very least failed to engage with the\n                    liquidator’s submissions, arguments and evidence in reaching its\n                    decision.",
        "The defendants’ submissions": "280    Mr Yeap submits that the Funds voluntarily\n                    subjected themselves to the tribunal’s jurisdiction without qualification\n                    and conducted themselves throughout as if though they were content to be treated\n                    in the same way as the original secured creditors and noteholders. As such, the\n                    Funds placed themselves squarely within the four corners of the\n                    defendants’ case and the tribunal’s terms of reference. The Funds\n                    are therefore bound by the award regardless of whether the tribunal’s\n                    decision was correct on the merits.",
        "Analysis of the tribunal’s decision": "(1) The tribunal’s remarks that revocation of the TAA was a\n                “hotly contested” issue 129    Mr Yeap first points to paragraph 148 of the\n                    award where the tribunal referred to the reasons for the revocation of the TAA\n                    as a “hotly contested” issue: 148. The revocation of the TAA, and the reasons for that revocation, were\n                        amongst the most hotly contested issues in the arbitration. [The defendants]\n                        contended that the reason for the revocation was the failure of the\n                        Liquidator to comply with the terms of the TAA. For his part, the\n                        Liquidator, who was joined by the Secured Creditors in this submission,\n                        contended that the reason for the revocation was that [the defendants]\n                        failed to pay the taxes due on the parcels of land transferred to [them]\n                        during 2005. Mr Yeap argues that this showed that the tribunal was fully\n                        aware of the revocation issue and the submissions advanced by both\n                        parties. 130    As I have already said, the mere fact that\n                    the tribunal acknowledges that an issue is live does not necessarily mean that\n                    the tribunal has engaged with the submissions and arguments of both sides on\n                    that issue. 131    It is pertinent that the tribunal in this\n                    passage says that “the Liquidator, who was joined by the Secured\n                    Creditors in this submission, contended that the reason for the revocation was\n                    that [the defendants] failed to pay the taxes due on theparcels of landtransferred to it during 2005” [emphasis\n                    added]. With respect, this misstates the liquidator’s (and the secured\n                    creditors’) position. It is not disputed that the liquidator’s\n                    position in the arbitration was that the defendants had failed to pay taxes to\n                    settle the Post-Closing Plant Taxes in 2005. But this failure includes not only\n                    the taxes due on the parcels of land (ie, PlantLandAssets) but also the taxes due on the\n                    PlantNon-LandAssets. It is also undisputed that\n                    the liquidator repeatedly stated his position in the arbitration. The\n                    tribunal’s error in this regard is consistent with Mr Yeo’s\n                    submission that it had no actual regard for the submissions made by the\n                    liquidator. It was also consistent with Mr Singh’s submission that the\n                    tribunal had simply dealt with the liquidator and the secured creditors as if\n                    they were a single entity, thereby depriving the secured creditors of their\n                    right to have their separate submissions considered in light of their separate\n                    position. 132    Further, this passage (as well as the\n                    tribunal’s main analysis of this issue) appears in the part of the award\n                    where the tribunal is discussing the chronology of events. I found this rather\n                    curious. It was not at all clear whether the tribunal truly appreciated how the\n                    issue of revocation was relevant in light of its own finding that the secured\n                    creditors and the liquidator were in breach of the APA from the very outset\n                    because the TAA did not have the effect of removing the statutory liens over the\n                    Plant Assets. 133    When I pressed Mr Yeap on this point in oral\n                    submissions, he took the position that the tribunal’s analysis of this\n                    issue was completely irrelevant to the issue of the US$80m in damages it awarded\n                    to the defendants, but was relevant only to the issue of who was responsible for\n                    paying the penalties and interest on the unpaid back taxes, when those penalties\n                    and interest became payable upon the revocation of the TAA. In my view, this\n                    made the location of the tribunal’s analysis of this issue within the\n                    context of its entire award even more curious. 134    In any event, as we shall see below, even\n                    though the tribunal ostensibly recognised the importance of the issue to the\n                    parties, the award does not actually analyse (i) the liquidator’s\n                    submissions and the evidence put forward or (ii) the secured creditors’\n                    submissions on this point at all. (2) The tribunal accepted the liquidator’s purported concession\n                that he was liable for the current taxes in 2005 135    Mr Yeap next relies on paragraphs 227 to 248\n                    of the award where he says the tribunal determined that it was the liquidator\n                    who was responsible for the TAA being revoked and shows that the tribunal simply\n                    preferred the defendants’ evidence, arguments and submissions over the\n                    liquidator’s. 136    In paragraphs 227, 228 and 236 of the award,\n                    the tribunal holds that the secured creditors’ payment on behalf of the\n                    liquidator of about US$108,000 on 27 December 2005 to Erebor for the\n                    Post-Closing Retained Assets Taxes (the third category of taxes; see [64] above)\n                    was not sufficient to discharge all of the outstanding taxes, leaving a\n                    shortfall of around about US$11,000. The liquidator himself acknowledged this in\n                    a letter to Erebor dated 28 March 2006. The liquidator therefore owed\n                    outstanding taxes to Erebor as at 31 December 2005. 137    At paragraphs 244 and 246 to 248 of the\n                    award, the tribunal finds that as a result, the TAA was automatically revoked on\n                    1 January 2006: 244. Accordingly, the Tribunal holds that on the\n                            31stDecember 2005, or at the latest, the\n                            1stJanuary 2006, the TAA was automatically\n                        revoked. … 246. There was also considerable debate about whether, if the TAA was\n                        automatically revoked by reason of the failure to pay current taxes after\n                        Closing, the fault was that of the Liquidator or of [the defendants]. 247.In the Liquidator’s Written Reply Closing\n                            Submissions, he accepts that he was ultimately liable for payment of\n                            current taxesvis-à-vis [Erebor]: see Paragraph 64.1. The Tribunal\n                            agrees with that concession.The Liquidator goes on to assert\n                        that [the defendants] had a contractual responsibility to the Liquidator for\n                        paying the current taxes. The Tribunal finds no justification for that\n                        assertion in the APA, and the provision upon which the Liquidator relies\n                        (Section 6.01(e) of the [OMNA]) contains a covenant to the Secured Creditors\n                        and the Facility Agent but not to the Liquidator. 248. The Tribunal finds that the TAA was automatically revoked by reason\n                        of the failure of the Liquidator to pay the current taxes during 2005. The\n                        latest date upon which the automatic revocation took place was the\n                            1stJanuary 2006. [emphasis added] 138    In summary, the tribunal’s decision\n                    that it was the liquidator who caused the revocation of the TAA at the latest on\n                    1 January 2006 by failing to pay the full amount of (all) current taxes by 31\n                    December 2005 turned on the liquidator’s concession that he was liable for\n                    the payment of (all) current taxes (that means to say both the Post-Closing\n                    Plant Assets Taxes and the Post-Closing Retained Assets Taxes). The tribunal\n                    found that the liquidator was unable to rely on s 6.01(e) of the OMNA since\n                    the defendants’ covenant to pay Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes was given\n                    only to the secured creditors and not to the liquidator. 139    In my judgment, the mere fact that the\n                    tribunal dealt with an issue and gave its reasons for doing so does not mean\n                    that it has considered both sides’ submissions. In fact, it is possible to\n                    infer from the tribunal’s reasoning that it failed to address its mind or\n                    to engage with one party’s submissions at all. I make the following\n                    observations. 140    First, the tribunal fails even to mention\n                    the express admission of the defendants’ witness Mr X that the defendants\n                    were obliged to make payment of the Post-Closing Plant Assets Taxes (which\n                    related to both Plant Land Assets and Plant Non-Land Assets) even though the tax\n                    declarations remained in the name of the Corporation (see [124(b)] above).\n                    Neither does the tribunal refer to the liquidator’s point that the\n                    defendants refused to make payment of the Post-Closing Plant Asset taxes in\n                    relation to the Plant Non-Land Assets for which they unsuccessfully sought tax\n                    exemptions. Instead, the tribunal focuses only on the question of payment of\n                    taxes for the Plant Land Assets. 141    Second, and related to the first point, the\n                    chronology set out by the tribunal in the award does not include the\n                    correspondence between the defendants and Erebor in which the defendants sought\n                    exemptions for the payment of taxes on the Plant Non-Land Assets. An example of\n                    this is the tribunal’s summary of a letter dated 15 April 2005 which the\n                    tribunal refers to at paragraph 184 of the award: 184. On the 15thApril 2005, [the\n                        defendants’ in-house counsel] wrote a lengthy letter to [the city\n                        treasurer]. She disputed the computation contained in [the city\n                        treasurer’s] letter dated the 4thFebruary\n                        2005. She told [the city treasurer] that the reason for the dispute was that\n                        the computation was “based on the assessed value of all properties\n                        belonging to [the Corporation]”, but reminded him that only four\n                        parcels of land had been assigned to [the defendants]. [The\n                        defendants’ in-house counsel] said that there was a need for a\n                        reconciliation of the city treasurer’s records and documents with [the\n                        defendants'] authorised representatives … [emphasis in original omitted] The tribunal in its summary of the 15 April 2005 letter above\n                        curiously refers only to the second and fifth paragraph of the letter but\n                        omits the third and fourth paragraph which make it clear that the defendants\n                        were aware that they were responsible for paying the 2005 Post-Closing Plant\n                        Assets Taxes in respect of the Plant Non-Land Assets: With respect to the buildings and machineries and other immovable\n                        properties which were assigned to [the first defendant] under a Deed of\n                        Assignment of [Plant Non-Land Assets] …, the valuation thereof made\n                        by the Asian Appraisal is only [about US$151.4m]. Please be reminded that\n                        these machineries, buildings and other immovables have already depreciated\n                        and the same have not been operational since 1999 when [the Corporation]\n                        ceased operations. … It is very important that your Office should also be informed that our\n                        company has a pending request with the Honourable city mayor and the [SP]\n                        wherein we are availing of the tax exemptions under the [Investment\n                        Incentives Code] of [Erebor]. These tax exemptions are available to new\n                        investors and even to existing enterprises which are being revived and whose\n                        facilities are being rehabilitated by the new owners who are investing a\n                        considering sum of investments. Please be further advised that our request\n                        is still pending study by a Committee headed by [one of the Erebor City\n                        Councillors] which Committee was specifically created for such purpose.\n                        … 142    Third, the tribunal’s reliance on the\n                    liquidator’s concession that he was legally liable for the payment of all\n                    the current taxes in 2005 was taken completely out of context. It is undisputed\n                    that the liquidator remained legally liable to Erebor for all taxes so long as\n                    he remained the nominal owner of the property on the title registry. However, it\n                    was also undisputed that the defendants were responsible for the payment of the\n                    Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes. In order to arrive at its conclusion, it was\n                    necessary for the tribunal to deal with and give reasons for dismissing the\n                    concession of Mr X. But it did not. 143    In coming to its conclusion, it also appears\n                    that the tribunal departed in a significant respect from the submissions of both\n                    parties, and in particular, from the submissions of the defendants. From the\n                    written submissions before the tribunal, it was clear that the defendants’\n                    position was that the liquidator was delinquent in paying the Post-ClosingRetained AssetsTaxes (not the Post-ClosingPlant AssetsTaxes) in 2004 (not\n                        2005),[note: 9]such that the TAA was automatically\n                    revoked by as early as January 2005 (not January 2006).[note: 10]As for the defendants’ non-payment of\n                    the Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes in respect of the PlantNon-LandAssets, the defendants’ case (on which extensive\n                    submissions were made) was that it could not be faulted for failing to pay these\n                    taxes because of the actions of Erebor and the liquidator. In other words, the\n                    defendantsacceptedthat it was responsible for\n                    paying Post-Closing Plant Assets Taxes but offered a defence for its failure to\n                    do so. 144    This much was conceded by Mr Yeap during\n                    oral submissions before me:[note: 11] Mr Yeap:    Let me pause here. We never said we had no\n                            responsibility in general to pay the post closing taxes, so this issue\n                            is really a red herring. We always said we were trying to pay, we were\n                            trying to pay the post closing taxes. And I have shown your Honour we\n                            are trying to, we needed to get it discharged.So we\n                                never took the basis you, the liquidator, had to pay the post\n                                closing taxes. That was never our case. So the statement\n                            that somehow the tribunal got it wrong, your Honour, is -- and I will\n                            demonstrate to your Honour further on this. That is a total\n                            mischaracterisation of how the issues were dealt with below. We accepted\n                            we were supposed to be paying, we were trying to pay. Court:    Which statement do you mean? Mr Yeap:    That [the defendants] had -- there was some\n                            allegation by the applicants that the tribunal did not consider or was\n                            under a misapprehension as to whether [the defendants] had an obligation\n                            to pay post closing taxes. I will come back to that when I get to that\n                            point further. I'll just leave it for the time being, your\n                            Honour. Court:    Very well. … Mr Yeap:    So in paragraph 247, your Honour, your Honour\n                            will see that the tribunal has made the point that the liquidator is\n                            ultimately liable for payment of the current taxes\n                        … [reads out paragraph 247 of the award] I'll show your Honour the tribunal's -- how they pick up the issue\n                        later. Suffice to say, I also went through the APA again and as I recall there is\n                        no specific provision in the APA saying that [the defendants were] to bear\n                        the post closing [tax]. Court:    I know. But [Mr X, the key witness of the\n                            defendants] admitted it in cross-examination. Mr Yeap:    He accepted that.We\n                                proceeded on the basis that we were responsible, that's why we were\n                                trying to pay.So for us to say we had no real\n                            responsibility had clean title been given to us -- our case was that if\n                            -- you were supposed to give us clean title, we would have … paid\n                            all the post closing [taxes], we were trying it pay the post closing\n                            [taxes] but it became a being problem because of the back\n                        taxes. [emphasis added] I was thus satisfied from the above that the tribunal had\n                        determined the issue on its own basis without regard to evidence and\n                        submissions before it. (3) The tribunal “agreed” with the defendants that it\n                was excused from its obligation to pay current taxes 145    The third passage Mr Yeap relies on is\n                    paragraphs 409 to 411 of the award where the tribunal agreed with the defendants\n                    that they did not have to pay current taxes because of the liquidator’s\n                    and secured creditor’s breach of their obligations under the APA to\n                    deliver clean title: 409.  [The defendants contend] that [a specific\n                            principle of Morian law] is irrelevant because the reason why [the\n                            defendants] did not pay the current realty taxes,if\n                                it was[their]responsibility to do so, was because [they were]\n                            entitled to withhold performance of [their] obligations so long as the\n                            Liquidator and the Secured Creditors failed to perform their\n                            obligations. [The defendants submit] that the relevant limitation period\n                            is not the one year provided for [under this principle], but the 10\n                            years provided for [under another principle] in respect of claims under\n                            a written contract where there is a claim for specific\n                            performance. 410.  Thus, [say the defendants], as the Liquidator and\n                            the Secured Creditors are in breach of their obligations under the APA,\n                            [the defendants are] excused from performance of [their] obligations,\n                            and time does not being to run against [them]. 411.  The Tribunal has concluded that [the\n                            defendants’] submissions are correct. … [emphasis added] 146    Mr Yeap says that the tribunal’s\n                    phrase “if it was its responsibility to do so” in the passage\n                    above shows implicitly that the tribunal took into account Mr X’s\n                    admission and any submissions on it that the defendants was responsible for\n                    paying Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes. I do not agree. If this passage was\n                    indeed meant to acknowledge Mr X’s admission and deal with it, then the\n                    tribunal would have dealt with it in paragraph 247 where the tribunal wasspecificallyaddressing its mind to that\n                    question in the context of the revocation of the TAA. Having considered the\n                    submissions of both sides, I am satisfied that this passage supports, rather\n                    than undermines the liquidator’s and the secured creditors’ case\n                    that there has been a breach of natural justice. 147    The first point to make is that the\n                    tribunal’s discussion in this passage is in relation to the issue of\n                    whether a limitation defence was available to the liquidator and the secured\n                    creditors under a certain principle of Morian law. It is therefore unclear, in\n                    light of the tribunal’s own logic, how the issue of revocation was at all\n                    related to the question of limitation. 148    It was also inexplicable why the tribunal\n                    ascribed to the defendants an argument which the defendants did not make at all.\n                    The defendants’ case in the arbitration on the limitation defence had\n                    nothing to do with the revocation issue. Instead, it was framed as\n                        follows:[note: 12] [The defendants] say that [the liquidator and the secured creditors] have\n                        cited the wrong [principle of Morian law] in relation to [the\n                        defendants’] claim. [The defendants’] claim is based on the\n                        reciprocal obligations under the APA (the duties to pay\n                            the Purchase Price and to deliver clean title to[the Plant Assets]). According to [another principle\n                        of Morian law], upon a breach of such reciprocal obligations, [the\n                        defendants], being the injured [parties], may choose between fulfilment and\n                        rescission of the obligation of the Liquidator, [the secured creditors]\n                        and/or the [the shareholders of the Corporation] to deliver clean title of\n                        [the Plant Assets] to [the defendants], with payment of damages in either\n                        case. ... [emphasis added] 149    The defendants’ case therefore was\n                    that it was entitled to withhold its payments under the notes so long as it had\n                    not received clean title to the Plant Assets. Also, as conceded by Mr Yeap\n                    above, itwasthe defendants’ case that they\n                    were responsible for paying Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes. There was therefore\n                    no uncertainty about the position which would have warranted the tribunal using\n                    the conditional form “if it was its responsibility to do so” when\n                    describing the defendants’ position in respect of the Post-Closing Plant\n                    Asset Taxes. In the circumstances, I am of the view that the tribunal’s\n                    adoption of this argument for a completely unrelated point to my mind is not a\n                    “middle path” between both parties’ submissions (cf Soh Beng Teeat [65(e)]). I agree with Mr Yeo that\n                    the tribunal’s conclusion at paragraphs 409 to 411 of the award appears to\n                    have been reached on its own basis with no reference to either parties’\n                    submissions. 150    In any event, Mr Yeap’s reliance on\n                    this passage was in truth an afterthought by the defendants as it did not appear\n                    in the defendants’ written submissions in the applications and was\n                    advanced for the first time only in oral submissions before me.[note: 13] (4) The tribunal found that the defendants had mitigated their losses\n                and acted reasonably in refusing to pay the outstanding “back-taxes”\n                in 2005 151    The fourth passage which Mr Yeap relies\n                        on[note: 14]is found at paragraphs 459 to 465 of the award.\n                    Again, this was a submission that was raised only in oral submissions before me\n                    and which did not appear in any of the defendants’ written submissions\n                    prior to that. In summary, the tribunal here was dealing with the liquidator and\n                    secured creditor’s contention that the defendants had failed to mitigate\n                    its loss. In particular, the tribunal was considering the liquidator’s and\n                    the secured creditors’ submission that the defendants should have come\n                    forward to pay the outstanding amount of back taxes (that is, Pre-Closing Taxes)\n                    which the secured creditors and the liquidators were contractually liable to pay\n                    under the APA. 152    The tribunal went through the conduct of the\n                    parties throughout 2005, including the attempt by both the liquidator and the\n                    defendants to persuade Erebor to apply the first TAA instalment towards the\n                    Pre-Closing Taxes related to the Plant Land Assets, and concluded that the\n                    defendants had behaved reasonably in the circumstances. Mr Yeap submits that\n                    when read together with the other three passages above, the tribunal has made it\n                    clear that it is the liquidator, and not the defendants, who was responsible for\n                    the revocation of the TAA. 153    This submission was a complete non-starter.\n                    The tribunal here was dealing with the Pre-Closing Taxes. It was not dealing\n                    with the post-closing tax obligations at all. Thus, if this passage was really\n                    intended to resolve the issue of revocation (which it was not), again it\n                    supports the liquidator’s and the secured creditors’ argument that\n                    the tribunal ignored their arguments which centred around the responsibility for\n                    paying Post-Closing Plant Assets Taxes.",
        "Conclusion on Issue 1": "123    In light of the above, I am satisfied that\n                    the liquidator was denied natural justice and that the award should be set aside\n                    in its entirety for this reason alone.",
        "Issue 2: Did the tribunal fail to consider the liquidator’s and\n                the secured creditors’ arguments, evidence and submissions on the issue of\n                whether the defendants were responsible for the revocation of the TAA?": "",
        "The liquidator’s and the secured creditors’\n                submissions": "124    The liquidator’s case was that the\n                    revocation of the TAA was caused (or primarily caused) by the defendants. As a\n                    result, the defendants had only themselves to blame for any loss suffered as a\n                    result of being unable to obtain clean title to the Plant Assets. In other\n                    words, the defendants’ actions broke the chain of causation between any\n                    breach of the APA and any loss which the defendants suffered. The\n                    liquidator’s evidence and submissions in support of this position before\n                    the tribunal can be summarised as follows: (a)     By purchasing the Plant Assets, the\n                        defendants had purchased not only the PlantLandAssets but also the PlantNon-LandAssets. (b)     The defendants accepted that it was responsible for the\n                        payment of Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes (the second category of taxes\n                        which were due on both Plant Land Assets and Plant Non-Land Assets; see [63]\n                        above). This was confirmed by a key concession during the cross-examination\n                        of one of the defendants’ witnesses, Mr X: Mr Yeo:    [Mr X], by this time, when you got this\n                                letter of 22 March 2005, you were aware of this requirement under\n                                the tax amnesty agreement, that current taxes had to be kept current\n                                -- that current taxes had to be paid, otherwise one of the\n                                consequences would be that the tax amnesty agreement is revoked. You\n                                were aware of that point by then, right? Mr X:  Yeah, from this letter, yes, definitely,\n                                yes. Mr Yeo:    You were also aware that as between [the\n                                defendants] and [the secured creditors and the liquidator], [the\n                                defendants] had undertaken to pay the post-closing taxes in relation\n                                to the properties -- land and non-land -- transferred to them, sold\n                                to them; correct? Mr X:  Yes, post-closing taxes was our\n                                responsibility. (c)     At the\n                        relevant time, the defendants were liaising with Erebor to obtain a tax\n                        exemption for Post-Closing Plant Assets Taxes in relation to the Plant\n                        Assets but were ultimately unsuccessful. (d)     The defendants failed to pay any of the\n                        Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes in relation to the PlantNon-LandAssets in 2005. The defendants also did not pay the\n                        sum of about US$51,500 which it said represented the 2005 Post-Closing Plant\n                        Asset Taxes in relation to the PlantLandAssets[note: 8]; (e)     In the circumstances, the revocation\n                        of the TAA was caused (or primarily caused) by the defendants’ own\n                        breaches and so they could not rely on their own breach(es) or blame the\n                        liquidator for the revocation of the TAA. 125    Mr Yeo argues that the tribunal ignored the\n                    undisputed facts and the defendants’ concessions and did not actively\n                    consider the liquidator’s submissions and arguments. In doing so, Mr Yeo\n                    submits that the tribunal decided this issue for reasons of its own and thereby\n                    breached the rules of natural justice. 126    The secured creditors’ case before the\n                    tribunal in summary was that the defendants were under a contractual obligation\n                    under s 6.01(e) of the OMNA to pay the Post-Closing Plant Assets Taxes (see\n                    [55(b)] above). It was therefore the defendants’ failure to pay the\n                    Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes that had caused the TAA to be revoked.\n                    Alternatively, the secured creditors argued that they should not be held liable\n                    jointly with the liquidator for any of his breaches of the TAA. 127    Before me, counsel for the secured creditors\n                    Mr Singh argues that the tribunal’s reasoning in the award shows that when\n                    it dealt with s 6.01(e) of the OMNA, it failed to appreciate that the\n                    liquidator and the secured creditors stood in a different position as against\n                    the defendants. On that basis, he argues that the tribunal did not expressly or\n                    implicitly deal with the secured creditor’s separate arguments in this\n                    regard and thereby breached the rules of natural justice.",
        "Conclusion on Issue 2": "154    Reading the award as a whole and having\n                    regard to the documents which were placed before me, I am satisfied that the\n                    liquidator was denied natural justice and that, even if I am wrong on Issue 1,\n                    the award should be set aside in its entirety on the basis of my finding on\n                    Issue 2. Given that I have found in favour of the liquidator, I do not find it\n                    necessary to discuss the secured creditors’ submissions on this issue in\n                    any more detail.",

        "The applicable legal principles on Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model\n                Law": "155    The relevant legal principles are not in\n                    dispute. Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law provides that an arbitral award may\n                    be set aside by the court if the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by\n                    or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains\n                    decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to the\n                    arbitration. 156    The Court of Appeal discussed the law on\n                    setting aside an award on the ground of excess of jurisdiction under Art\n                    34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law inCRW Joint Operation v PT\n                        Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK[2011] 4 SLR 305 at [31] to\n                    [33] (“CRW v PGN”). As the Court of\n                    Appeal said at [31]: 31    It is useful, at this juncture, to set out some of\n                            the legal principles underlying the application of Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of\n                            the Model Law.

Rather, it applies\n                            where the arbitral tribunal improperly decided matters that [were not]\n                            submitted to it or failed to decide matters that [were] submitted to it.\n                            In other words, Art 34(2)(a)(iii) addresses the situation where the\n                            arbitral tribunal exceeded (or failed to exercise) the authority that\n                            the parties granted to it ... 157    The Court of Appeal made it clear inCRW v PGNat [32] that in order to set aside\n                    an award under Art 34(2)(a)(iii), in addition to satisfying the court that the\n                    case comes within that provision, applicant must also satisfy the court that it\n                    suffered actual or real prejudice. 158    The question of what matters are within the\n                    scope of a submission to arbitration was recently considered by the Court of\n                    Appeal inPT Prima International Development v Kempinski\n                        Hotels SA and other appeals[2012] 4 SLR 98 (“Kempinski”). InKempinski, the Court of Appeal emphasised (at [33] and [36]) the\n                    importance that pleadings and the memorandum of issues play in delineating the\n                    issues which are before an arbitral tribunal: 33    The role of pleadings in arbitral proceedings is to\n                            provide a convenient way for the parties to define the jurisdiction of\n                            the arbitrator by setting out the precise nature and scope of the\n                            disputes in respect of which they seek the arbitrator's adjudication.\n                            ... … 36    … In\n                            arbitration, the parties can determine the scope of the arbitration\n                            …vis-à-visthe issues to be tried.

It is fundamental to our adversarial system of justice that the\n                            parties should clearly identify the issues that arise in the litigation,\n                            so that each has the opportunity of responding to the points made by the\n                            other.The function of the judge is to adjudicate on\n                                those issues alone. The parties may have their own reasons for\n                                limiting the issues or presenting them in a certain way. The judge\n                                can invite, and even encourage, the parties to recast or modify the\n                                issues. Bu[t] if they refuse to do so, the judge must respect that\n                                decision. One consequence of this may be that the judge is compelled\n                                to reject a claim on the basis on which it is advanced, although he\n                                or she is of the opinion that it would have succeeded if it had been\n                                advanced on a different basis. Such an outcome may be unattractive,\n                                but any other approach leads to uncertainty and potentially real\n                                unfairness. [emphasis added] 159    Recognising that arbitration is a dynamic\n                    and flexible process, the Court of Appeal also recognised at [37] that it was\n                    possible to introduce new issues so long as the adjudicatory process ensures\n                    procedural fairness: 37    … Even where a new issue is raised by the\n                            court on its own motion as a result of the evidence adduced during the\n                            trial, the defence should, for the sake of good order, be amended so\n                            that the plaintiff may file an amended reply and, if necessary, call\n                            rebuttal evidence on the new issue. This is an established process to\n                            ensure fairness to the party affected by the new issue. From the court's\n                            perspective, any issue of fact and/or law that is relevant to the\n                            dispute before it will normally be allowed to be raised by way of an\n                            amendment to the pleadings so that all the issues relevant to the\n                            dispute can be disposed of at the same time in the same trial (subject\n                            only to the principle that a proposed amendment to a party's pleadings,\n                            if allowed, must not result in prejudice to the other party which cannot\n                            be compensated by way of costs). 160    Thus, if a tribunal is of the view that a\n                    party has not addressed the real issue on which the dispute before it turns, it\n                    ought to invite that party to amend its pleadings so as to place that issue\n                    squarely before the tribunal and to give unambiguous notice to the opposing\n                    party that that issue is to be presented to and considered by the tribunal.\n                    Having said that, the Court of Appeal also held that the failure of one party to\n                    amend its pleadings cannot be determinative of whether the issue has been\n                    submitted to the tribunal. Rather, the key question is one of substance over\n                    form. The question is whether the opposing side was given sufficient notice of\n                    and opportunity to meet the new case:Kempinskiat\n                    [47]. 161    This is, of course, subject to two\n                    qualifications. First, a party cannot unilaterally enlarge the tribunal’s\n                    jurisdiction beyond that permitted by the parties’ arbitration agreement\n                    simply by the manner in which it frames its pleadings. Second, while each party\n                    is entitled to an opportunity to present its case, it is entitled only to areasonableopportunity to do so. So a tribunal\n                    before whom a party seeks to reframe its case, with or without consequential\n                    amendments to its pleadings will have to consider whether acceding to that\n                    request will cause unreasonable prejudice to the opposing party.",
        "My decision on Issue 3": "(1) The defendants’ own case on damages was that it had\n                suffered a loss of actual profits and not a loss of an opportunity to earn\n                profits 162    Mr Yeap accepts that the defendants’\n                    pleadings characterised their loss as a loss of profits and sought compensation\n                    equivalent to those profits lost. He accepts also, as he must, that the tribunal\n                    approached the defendants’ loss as a lost opportunity to earn profits and\n                    not as a loss of actual profits. His argument was that the issue of whether the\n                    defendants had lost an opportunity to earn profits was always a live issue\n                    before the tribunal. In support, he relies on the defendants’ notice of\n                    arbitration. The defendants concluded their list of relief claimed with a\n                    generic claim for damages: RELIEF SOUGHT 61. [The defendants] seek the following orders and reliefs: … (5) An order that the Secured Creditors do indemnify [the defendants] for\n                        any and all costs, expenses, obligations, liabilities and/or damages that\n                        [the defendants] may incur in respect of the issue of the unpaid taxes and\n                        all interests and penalties in respect thereof pursuant to Article 7.3(g) of\n                        the APA; (6) Further or alternatively,damages… ... [emphasis added] 163    According to Mr Yeap, the prayer for generic\n                    “damages” was broad enough to include damages for loss\n                    characterised as a lost opportunity to earn profits. I do not agree. Damages is\n                    the default remedy for a cause of action in contract and is simply a claim\n                    compensation for the loss suffered. The real question is, having regard to the\n                    pleadings, evidence and submissions, what did the defendants assert they had\n                    lost as a result of the breaches of contract alleged? 164    Having considered the material put before\n                        me,[note: 15]I agree with the secured\n                    creditors and the liquidator that the defendants characterised their loss as the\n                    actual profits that they would have earned but which they failed to earn because\n                    of the breaches of contract. For virtually the entire arbitration, their claim\n                    was framed as follows: (a)     the defendants intended to mortgage\n                        the Plant Assets in order to obtain additional financing amounting to US$86m\n                        (later increased to US$106m); (b)     the purpose of the additional loans was to finance the\n                        works needed to modernise and rehabilitate the Plant\n                    Assets; (c)     because\n                        the Plant Assets did not come with clean title, the defendants were unable\n                        to obtain the additional loans from banks; and (d)     because the defendants were unable to obtain\n                        the additional loans, they would have earned actual profits for which they\n                        ought to be compensated. 165    None of the documents which the defendants\n                    presented to the tribunal and placed before me on these applications\n                    characterised their loss as the loss of an opportunity to earn profits. In the\n                    memorandum of issues jointly prepared by the parties to the arbitration, the\n                    parties together framed the issue as one relating to a loss of profits. Thus,\n                    for example: 3.    In the event the Tribunal finds that the\n                            Liquidator, [the secured creditors] and/or the [shareholders of the\n                            Corporation] breached the above mentioned\n                            obligations/warranties/representations, what losses, damages and/orlosses of profits(if any) [the\n                            defendants] are entitled to. In this respect, the following related or\n                            sub-issues arise, namely, whether the Liquidator, the [the secured\n                            creditors] and/or the [shareholders of the Corporation] are liable\n                            to:- … (b)    compensate [the defendants] for anyloss of profitssuffered by [the defendants]\n                            arising from their inability to obtain the Additional Loans from other\n                            third party financial institutions, and if so, the amount thereof. In\n                            relation to this, the following sub-issues also arise: (i)    whether the alleged breach(es) causedthe loss of profitsclaimed by [the\n                            defendants]; (ii)  if so, whether [the defendants’] right to\n                            claim for suchloss of profitis affected\n                            by the alleged failure on the part of [the defendants] to pay post\n                            Closing taxes, which allegedly led to the revocation of the TAA\n                            ... ... [emphasis added] 166    In some arbitrations, the memorandum of\n                    issues includes a catch-all provision which gives the arbitral tribunal some\n                    latitude to add issues which are not expressly listed (see for exampleTMM Division Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte\n                        Ltd[2013] 4 SLR 972 at [52]). There was no such provision here.\n                    Instead, the concluding provision in paragraph 8 of the agreed memorandum of\n                    issues merely recorded that: “The Parties reserve their rights to modify,\n                    vary and/or supplement the contents of this Memorandum.” This is entirely\n                    consistent with the secured creditors’ and the liquidator’s position\n                    that the tribunal was not given the unilateral power to add to the issues which\n                    were expressly listed in the memorandum of issues. While the parties did agree\n                    in paragraph 8 of the memorandum of issues that they remained free to modify,\n                    vary or supplement the issues, party could not do so unilaterally, with no\n                    notice formal or informal to the other party. 167    The defendants continued to characterise\n                    their loss in this way up to and including the defendants’ written closing\n                    submissions dated 23 May 2011. Those submissions stated the following at\n                    paragraph 293: 293. [t]hequantification of loss of profitssuffered by [the defendants] as a result of [the secured creditors and the\n                        liquidators’] breaches of their obligations/ warranties/\n                        representations under the APA is set out in the Witness Statement of [one of\n                        the defendants’ experts] signed on 3 November 2010. Theloss of profitsas at 31 December 2009 was\n                        quantified at US$368.578 million. [emphasis added] 168    It is to my mind clear beyond doubt that the\n                    sole basis of the defendants’ case on loss before the tribunal was that by\n                    reason of the breaches of contract which they alleged, the defendants would\n                    actually have earned profits and ought therefore to be compensated for those\n                    actual lost profits. It quantified those lost profits at\n                US$368.578m. (2) The tribunal understood the defendants’ original claim in\n                the award as one of loss of profits 169    The tribunal also understood the\n                    defendants’ case on loss as one concerning the loss of actual profits and\n                    not the loss of an opportunity to earn profits. During the defendants’\n                    oral closing submissions on 21 October 2011, Mr Yeap addressed the tribunal on\n                    the alleged lack of evidence that the defendants had tried but failed to obtain\n                    additional funding to modernise the steel plant. The chairman of the tribunal\n                    then suggested that the defendants ought to be seeking compensation for the loss\n                    of an opportunity to earn profits as opposed to seeking compensation for the\n                    loss of actual profits:[note: 16] Mr Yeap:    Yes, but if you are expecting us to get\n                            specific bankers to come and say \"I was running this bank at that time,\n                            [the defendants] had approached me and I had said no only because of\n                            this reason\", firstly, I don't think that would be realistic, if I may\n                            say so, because of the nature of the litigation. Chairman:    But what you are really then talking about,\n                            Mr Yeap, is not actually the inability to raise the funds, it's the loss\n                            of the opportunity. Mr Yeap:    I know. I was going to say that also. At the\n                            end of the day, I was going to say that if the Tribunal felt that there\n                            was a loss of an opportunity,certainly it would be\n                                open to the Tribunal to analyse it as a loss of a chance, or\n                                alternatively what we call temperate damages, which\n                            incidentally has already been referred to in [the defendant’s\n                            Morian Law expert, Justice A’s] first statement. Like the common law principles, if the Tribunal is of the view that we\n                        have suffered loss and it's a question of difficulty in proving that loss,\n                        the quantum, then it is open to the Tribunal to give damages which it\n                        believes to be fair and reasonable. So they've got the same principle as we\n                        do in the common law system. It's not a new point, it has been flagged from\n                        day one. Chairman:But neither courts nor\n                                tribunals just pluck figures out of the\n                        air. Mr Yeap:    Yes. I was going to say thatin considering what is fair and reasonable, it would be\n                                open to the Tribunal to analyse this from a chance perspective. But\n                                it may not be seen as a loss of a chanceper se, but it dovetails with the concept of temperate\n                                damages. Arbitrator 1:    Yes so are you saying that temperate\n                            damages is the [Morian law] equivalent of the concept of a loss of a\n                            chance? Mr Yeap:I would say that they may\n                                not be entirely equivalent, but the loss of a chance may well come\n                                within the temperate damages doctrine. Chairman:    [Justice A] refers to temperate damages, but\n                            I don't think so [the secured creditors’ and the\n                            liquidator’s Morian Law expert Justice B] specifically deals with\n                            this question. Mr Yeap:    No one asked [Justice A] about temperate\n                            damages. Chairman:    No, but I think he did deal with temperate\n                            damages in his -- Mr Yeap:    Yes, it's in his statement. That's right we\n                            dealt with exemplary, we dealt with temperate, we dealt with all kinds\n                            of damages. Chairman:    All I said was I don't think that [Justice\n                            B] actually dealt with temperate damages. Mr Yeap:    He had every opportunity to do\n                        so. Chairman:    Well. Mr Yeap:    You are correct. Chairman:    But equally,I don't\n                                think that Justice A gave us much of an as[sic]to how the [Morian]\n                                court might assess temperate damages, other than to stick one finger\n                                in a mouth and stick it in the air and see which the way wind was\n                                blowing. [emphasis added] 170    I make four observations about the exchange\n                    above. First, this was the first time the defendants ever put its case on loss\n                    on the basis that what it had lost was an opportunity to earn profits, or indeed\n                    an opportunity to raise additional finances whether as a step towards earning\n                    actual profits or towards a further, subsidiary opportunity to earn profits.\n                    Second, rightly or wrongly, it was the defendants’owncase that any award for a loss of opportunity\n                    had to be dealt with not under the concept in Morian law of “actual or\n                    compensatory” damages but under the alternative concept in Morian law of\n                    “temperate” damages. Third, it is obvious from the above exchange\n                    that there was no evidence before the tribunal from Justice B, the Morian law\n                    expert for the secured creditors and for the liquidator, on the concept of\n                    “temperate” damages under Morian law. Fourth, as the Chairman\n                    pointed out, the problem with this new alternative case characterising the\n                    defendants’ loss as the loss of an opportunity to earn profits was that\n                    there was insufficient evidence for the tribunal to quantify the\n                    defendants’ opportunity of earning that profit and thereby to quantify the\n                    compensation to be awarded for the loss. As the chairman of the tribunal put it,\n                    “neither the courts nor the tribunals pluck figures from the\n                    air”. 171    The following exchange then took\n                        place:[note: 17] Chairman:    So you say that because of the liquidator's\n                            failure to transfer title to you, youlost the\n                                opportunity to raise the additional loans? Mr Yeap:    That's right. Chairman:That's the way it is now\n                                put, is it? Mr Yeap:    I think that's the way we have always put it,\n                            it's just that we took it further to say that if we have had the loans\n                            we would have basically -- I mean, the intention was to get on with the\n                            enhancements but certainly because we couldn't get on with it, as it\n                            turned out, we suffered operating losses. I mean, we could have -- if\n                            those loans were permitted to be used for operating purposes, we may\n                            well have done it, but the fact is that what is clear is without the\n                            land, we couldn't get the additional loans. And that has always been our\n                            case. Arbitrator 2:    It still leaves the problem, as I\n                            understand it, Mr Yeap. The difference between loss of opportunity and\n                            actual loss would be in one case you say \"If I had the money, I would\n                            have done this\". And in the second, you say \"If I had the money, I could\n                            have done this\". In either event you would need some kind of factual\n                            basis to say what is it that you would or could have done with the\n                            money. In one case it becomes loss of opportunity, in the other case it\n                            becomes an actual loss. That's really where at least I think this\n                            Tribunal will need a little help on facts. [emphasis added] 172    To my mind, the above exchange shows clearly\n                    that the tribunal recognised, once all the evidence was in, that the defendants\n                    ought to have characterised their loss as the loss of an opportunity to earn\n                    profits. This exchange also shows clearly that the tribunal recognised that the\n                    legal and factual underpinnings of an inquiry into a lost opportunity to earn\n                    profits were quite different from those of an inquiry into a loss of actual\n                    profits which had been presented to them. (3) The tribunal expressly re-characterised the defendants’\n                claim in the award as one of loss of an opportunity to earn profits 173    All of this is confirmed in the award\n                    itself, where the tribunal explicitly recharacterises the defendants’ case\n                    on loss from a claim to recover loss of actual profits to a “claim for\n                    the loss of an opportunity to make increased profits” (at paragraphs 432\n                    to 433 of the award): 432.  [The defendants claim] that, as a result of the\n                            failure to transfer clean title, [they were] unable to obtain the\n                            Additional Loans (as defined in the APA) in order to rehabilitate,\n                            modernise and upgrade the [Mithril Plant] so that [they had] lost\n                            profits which are estimated to be [US]$368.6 million for the period\n                            between 2005 and 2009. 433.  [The defendants assert] that the failure of the\n                            Liquidator and the Secured Creditors to transfer clean title hindered\n                            [their] efforts to raise money to refurbish and modernise the [Mithril\n                            Plant], and that, in consequence, [they were] unable to earn the profits\n                            that [they] would have been able to earn during a period when the\n                            worldwide demand for [Mithril] was flourishing. Although this claim was\n                            put as a loss of profits claim,it is, in the\n                                Tribunal’s view, better considered as a claim for the loss of\n                                an opportunity to make increased profits, and the Tribunal will\n                                consider it on that basis. [emphasis added] 174    At paragraph 445 of the award, the tribunal\n                    again recharacterises the defendants’ loss as a lost opportunity to earn\n                    profits: 445.  The Tribunal next considers the damages to which\n                            [the defendants are] entitled as a result of the breach of the APA by\n                            the Liquidator and the Secured Creditors.It is\n                                clear that[the\n                                defendants]cannot prove any actual\n                                loss. However, [the\n                                defendants’]case is\n                                that[they]lost the opportunity to earn profits. [They] did\n                            not carry out the intended work of rehabilitation and modernisation, as\n                            [they] did not have the funds to do so. The failure of the Liquidator\n                            and the Secured Creditors to transfer clean title meant that [the\n                            defendants were] unable to raise the additional loans against the\n                            security of the new [indenture], and, in consequence, [were] unable to\n                            carry out the work of rehabilitation and modernisation that it\n                                [sic] was necessary to do in order to\n                            make the plant more productive. As a result of the breach, therefore,\n                            [the defendants] lost the opportunity to earn substantial\n                            profits[.] [emphasis added in bold and bold italics] 175    Mr Singh argues that this recharacterisation\n                    of the defendants’ case is significant because the tribunal themselves\n                    recognise that “[i]t is\n                        clear that[the defendants]cannot prove any actual loss” [emphasis\n                    added]. Mr Singh took this to mean that the tribunal found as a fact that the\n                    defendants’ claim for loss of actual profits failed. I was initially\n                    hesitant to accept this interpretation. I am keenly aware that an award has to\n                    be construed generously and any passage in an award needs to be construed in the\n                    context of the entire award and not read like a statute. On one reading, it is\n                    at leastplausiblethat the tribunal here is using\n                    “actual loss” simply to refer to quantifiable out of pocket losses\n                    (in other words, reliance loss) as opposed to the loss of expected future\n                    profits (or expectation loss). 176    On balance, however, it is my view that the\n                    interpretation which Mr Singh puts on this passage is more consistent with the\n                    tenor of the entire award. First, it was never the defendants’ case that\n                    it suffered out of pocket losses. Rather, as the tribunal itself recognised in\n                    paragraph 432, it was the defendants’ case that “as a result of the\n                    failure to transfer clean title, it was unable to obtain the additional Loans\n                    (as defined in the APA) in order to rehabilitate, modernise and upgrade the\n                    [Mithril Plant] so that it has lost profits which are estimated to be\n                    [US$368.6m] for the period between 2005 and 2009”. Second, in the\n                    exchanges between the tribunal and counsel quoted above, the tribunal showed\n                    itself acutely aware of the evidential difficulties that the defendants had in\n                    establishing on the balance of probabilities that it had suffered actual losses\n                    of US$386.6m. 177    For completeness I should add that I found\n                    the following passage at paragraph 458 of the award particularly\n                    difficult: 458.  The Tribunal notes that under [a principle of\n                            Morian law], there is a head of damages called “temperate or\n                            moderate” damages. This category covers cases where it is not\n                            possible readily to quantify the actual loss suffered, and the [Morian\n                            Courts] thus award “temperate or moderate” damages.\n                            However, in the present case, the Tribunal has received satisfactory\n                            evidence that [the defendants]did suffer actual loss\n                                and has also received expert evidence of the likely quantum of such\n                                loss. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not find [this\n                            principle] to be applicable. [emphasis added] This paragraph is consistent with the rest of the award\n                        insofar as it suggests that the tribunal was satisfied that the defendants\n                        had suffered some form of loss, though not loss of the kind it had chosen to\n                        advance in its claim: lost actual profits. Nevertheless, even though Mr Yeap\n                        had earlier pointed out that on the defendants’ own case, the gateway\n                        under Morian law for a claim equivalent to the common law concept of a loss\n                        of opportunity came under the Morian law concept of temperate damages, the\n                        tribunal inexplicably decided that this concept was not applicable as it\n                        held it had “received expert evidence of the likely quantum of such\n                        loss”. With respect, the expert evidence that the tribunal had\n                        received was on lost actual profits, and not on the loss of an opportunity\n                        to earn profits. In reaching its conclusion: (i) to eschew the concept of\n                        temperate or moderate damages under Morian law; and (ii) to take expert\n                        evidence adduced to assist the tribunal to assess lost actual profits and\n                        use that evidence to assess damages for the loss of an opportunity to earn\n                        profits, it appears to me that the tribunal decided the matter on a basis\n                        which was not submitted to it. Kempinski is distinguishable on the facts 178    Mr Yeap relies onKempinskito argue in the alternative that even if the issue of\n                    a lost opportunity to earn profits was not expressly submitted to the tribunal,\n                    the defendants’ claim for damages reframed in this way was “part\n                    of, or directly related to, the dispute which the parties submitted for\n                    arbitration” and therefore need not have been specifically\n                        pleaded.[note: 18] 179    In my view, the facts ofKempinskican be distinguished from the present case. InKempinski, K commenced arbitration against P,\n                    alleging the wrongful termination of a management contract. After the arbitrator\n                    had issued a first interim award but before he had issued a second interim\n                    award, P discovered that K had entered into a similar arrangement with a third\n                    party, allegedly in breach of the management contract. The arbitrator issued a\n                    third interim award which held that the new arrangement was inconsistent with\n                    the management contract and that K was not entitled to damages after the date of\n                    the new arrangement. K applied to set aside the third interim award on the basis\n                    that the issue was not within the scope of the parties’ submission to\n                    arbitration since the new arrangement had not been specifically pleaded. The\n                    High Court agreed with K and set aside the third interim award. The Court of\n                    Appeal inKempinski, reversing the High Court,\n                    dismissed the application and restored that award. 180    The Court of Appeal found that the pleaded\n                    issues submitted for arbitration included K’s claim (i) for damages for\n                    “the remainder of the term of the [management contract]” and (ii)\n                    specific performance. This meant that the issue of the legal effect of the new\n                    arrangement on the continuing viability of these two claims after the date of\n                    the new arrangement fell within the scope of the parties’ submission to\n                    arbitration. It then held at [47]: 47    ... In our view, anynew\n                                factor change in the law arising after a submission to\n                            arbitration which is ancillary to the dispute submitted for arbitration\n                            and which is known to all the parties to the arbitration is part of that\n                            dispute and need not be specifically pleaded. It may be raised in the\n                            arbitration, as [P] did when it raised the New Management Contract as\n                            part of itsforce majeuredefence to [K's]\n                            claim. We should also point out that [K] was given sufficient notice of\n                            and opportunity to meet [P's]force\n                                majeuredefence. [emphasis added in bold italics] 181    The Court of Appeal was also satisfied that\n                    K had suffered no prejudice as a result of the failure of P to amend its\n                    pleadings. It emphasised (at [51]) that there had been “extensive correspondence, written submissions and expert\n                        evidence” [emphasis added] on the legal effect of this new\n                    arrangement. It was also clear that the arbitrator had on several instances\n                    informed the parties that he wanted to be addressed on the legal effect of the\n                    new arrangement. Seen in that light, P’s failure to amend its pleadings\n                    was in substance immaterial in light of the ample notice that K had on this\n                    issue. 182Kempinskiwas\n                    a case where anew factemerged in the course of\n                    the arbitration which had a bearing on the quantum of damages or the viability\n                    of the remedy of specific performance which was properly before the tribunal. In\n                    the present case, there were no new facts which emerged in the course of the\n                    arbitration. All that happened is that it occurred to the tribunal, almost at\n                    the very end of the arbitration, that the defendants ought to have characterised\n                    their loss in a different way in light of the evidence. UnlikeKempinski, the tribunal did not ask the parties to\n                    address it on a claim for a lost opportunity to earn profits before quantifying\n                    and awarding damages on that basis in its award. (4) “Loss of an opportunity to earn profits” is\n                different from “loss of profit” 183    However, can it be argued that the loss of\n                    an opportunity to earn profits and a loss of actual profits arein substancethe same thing? If that is the case, it is\n                    irrelevant what label the tribunal puts on the defendants’ loss. At a high\n                    level of conception, there is force in the argument that in both cases a party\n                    is seeking to recover compensation for profits which he expected to earn from\n                    activities which were in the future at the time of breach and which will now\n                    never take place because of the breach. Seen in that light, loss characterised\n                    as a loss of actual profits is necessarily the same a loss of an opportunity to\n                    earn profits in the sense that earning the profits in both cases depends on the\n                    future occurrence of uncertain events. 184    Nevertheless, there is to my mind a\n                    substantive distinction between the two ways of looking at loss. In a claim for\n                    the loss of actual profits, the plaintiff asserts that but for the breach of\n                    contract, hewould(notcould) have earned profits. In other words, the plaintiff is\n                    asserting a direct link between the breach and the loss. If the plaintiffsucceedsin proving that link, he is entitled\n                    to full compensation for his loss. If, on the other hand, the plaintifffailsto prove that direct link, he recovers\n                    nothing. 185    Damages assessed on the basis of actual lost\n                    profits is thus an all or nothing exercise. This is an important point. Even if\n                    the finder of fact is of the view that there is only a 51% chance that the\n                    plaintiff would have gone on to earn the profits claimed if the breach had not\n                    occurred, the plaintiff recovers full compensation. He does not recover 51% of\n                    his loss. By the same token, even if the finder of fact is satisfied that the\n                    plaintiff’s chance of going on to earn the profits claimed is as high as\n                    49%, the plaintiff recovers nothing. He does not recover 49% of his\n                loss. 186    The position is completely different when a\n                    plaintiff presents his loss as a lost opportunity to earn profits. On that\n                    analysis, the plaintiff asserts that but for the breach of contract, hecould(notwould) have earned profits. On this analysis, the plaintiff concedes\n                    that his ability to earn profits is subject to events beyond his control (for\n                    example, because of the actions of a third party). A plaintiff who proves this\n                    assertion on a balance of probabilities is not entitled to full compensation and\n                    cannot move directly to the assessment stage. He is entitled only to proceed to\n                    the intermediate stage of proving the likelihood of those events occurring. That\n                    likelihood is then ascertained by the finder of fact and applied at the quantum\n                    stage to modulate the plaintiff’s damages proportionately. A party who\n                    advances a case on the basis of a lost opportunity to earn profits concedes that\n                    he might recover less in damages if he succeeds but mitigates his risk of\n                    recovering nothing at all. 187    This view is consistent with the way in\n                    which the distinction is treated, at least under Singapore law (I will return to\n                    this point later below at [191]). In the Singapore High Court case ofSuper Continental Pte Ltd v Essential Engineering &\n                        Construction Pte Ltd[2010] SGHC 365 (“Super Continental”), S contracted to purchase machines\n                    from E. S planned to use these machines to manufacture certain products which it\n                    would then sell for a profit. E’s machines were defective and as a result,\n                    S specifically claimed both damages for actual loss of profits and, in the\n                    alternative, damages for the loss of a chance to earn profits. Having found E\n                    liable to S, Judith Prakash J turned to consider S’s claim for damages.\n                    S’s case on actual lost profits was that it would have derived profits\n                    from sales to certain businesses such as Singapore Airlines even though it did\n                    not have a contract to supply Singapore Airlines with the product at the time of\n                    the breach (Super Continentalat [136]). Although\n                    its evidence on the ability to earn a profit from Singapore Airlines was weak, S\n                    argued that it merely had to show a real or substantial chance to earn that\n                    profit in order for the court to award damages for actual loss of profits.\n                    Prakash J disagreed and held at [142]: 142    ... In this connection, I think the plaintiff has\n                            mixed up two different bases of claim. A plaintiff can make a claim for\n                            actual loss of profits if he can show that on a balance of\n                            probabilities, he would, apart from the defendant’s breach, have\n                            earned such profits. Alternatively, he can make a claim for the loss of\n                            a chance to make a profit. Prakash J then held that S failed to show that it would have\n                        earned the projected profits and that his claim for actual loss of profit\n                        failed on that basis. On the alternative claim, Prakash J was satisfied that\n                        S had lost a real and substantialchanceto\n                        earn profits and not a speculative one. On that basis, she awarded S a\n                        percentage of the profit S could have earned. 188    In light of my discussion at [162] to [187]\n                    above, I am satisfied that the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by inquiring\n                    into the defendants’ loss of an opportunity to earn profits even though it\n                    was not an issue that was placed before it. I now move on to consider whether\n                    the secured creditors and the liquidator suffered prejudice as a\n                result. (5) The secured creditors and the liquidator suffered prejudice 189    Mr Yeap makes two arguments in relation to\n                    prejudice. First, he argues that even if the issue of a lost opportunity to earn\n                    profits was not submitted to the tribunal, the secured creditors and the\n                    liquidator suffered no prejudice since all the relevant evidence was before the\n                    tribunal for it to determine the lost opportunity claim. Second, he argues that\n                    there was in any event no prejudice because the tribunal concluded at paragraph\n                    454 of the award that the defendants would have had a slightly better than even\n                    chance of making substantially enhanced profits (and then put the figure at\n                    55%). This, so the argument went, meant that if the tribunal had determined the\n                    case based on the defendants’ original claim for actual lost profits, the\n                    defendants would have satisfied the tribunal on the balance of probabilities\n                    that it would have earned the profit claimed (because the tribunal ascribed a\n                    probability of more than 50% to the chance) and therefore obtained 100% of the\n                    actual lost profits claimed. Therefore, the secured creditors and the\n                    liquidators should, if anything, be grateful that the tribunal re-characterised\n                    the defendants’ claim and thereby limited the damages awarded against them\n                    to only 55% of the projected profits. 190    Turning to his first argument, in my view,\n                    the re-characterisation of the damages issue deprived the secured creditors and\n                    the liquidators of an opportunity to adduce evidence and make submissions\n                    on: (a)     the relevant legal principles under\n                        Morian Law relating to damages for the loss of an opportunity; as well\n                        as (b)     gaps in the\n                        evidence available to establish a claim for damages for loss of an\n                        opportunity to earn profits (as opposed to a claim for actual loss of\n                        profits). 191    Whatever the position might be under\n                    Singapore law with respect of damages for the loss of an opportunity, the APA\n                    was governed by Morian law. A key issue which the tribunal would have had to\n                    consider, therefore, was whether a claim for the loss of an opportunity to earn\n                    profits was recoverable under Morian law and if so, what were the relevant\n                    principles for quantifying damages awarded on that basis. 192    Both sides in this application tendered\n                    expert evidence on Morian law from most eminent experts. The defendants adduced\n                    expert evidence from Justice A. He contends that there is no distinction between\n                    loss of profits and loss of an opportunity under Morian law. It is worth\n                    pointing out that this directly contradicts the position taken by the defendants\n                    before the tribunal that loss of opportunity cases “dovetails with the\n                    concept of temperate damages” as opposed to “actual and\n                    compensatory damages” (see transcript reproduced at [171] above). On the\n                    other hand, the secured creditors’ Morian Law expert Justice B contends\n                    that Morian law does not allow a claim on the basis of actual or compensatory\n                    damages for the loss of an opportunity. His evidence is that, at best, temperate\n                    or moderate damages should have been awarded and this would have led to a\n                    significantly lower quantum of damages. 193    It is not this court’s role to\n                    determine whether the loss of a chance doctrine as it is understood at common\n                    law is available under Morian law or how it should be characterised and treated\n                    under Morian law. In my view, prejudice has been suffered by the secured\n                    creditors and the liquidator because this evidence could have made a reasonable\n                    difference to the tribunal: seeL W Infrastructureat [54]. 194    It is also clear from the arbitral documents\n                    that the liquidator and the secured creditors took the defendants’ claim\n                    for actual lost profits at face value. Given that the defendants were running an\n                    all or nothing claim on damages, the plaintiffs ran an “all or\n                    nothing” defence directed solely towards attacking causation on the\n                    balance of probabilities. In other words, the plaintiffs’ argument on\n                    damages was that the defendants had failed to prove on the balance of\n                    probabilities that the plaintiffs’ alleged breach hadcausedthe defendants to suffer a loss of profits at all.\n                    Evidence and submissions directed towards moving the balance of probabilities on\n                    an actual lost profits claim is in substance and effect quite different from\n                    evidence and submissions directed towards ascertaining the quantum of the chance\n                    lost on the lost opportunity analysis. For one thing, the balance of\n                    probabilities approach is binary whereas the lost opportunity approach is\n                    infinitely shaded from 0% to 100%. 195    I therefore accept that the difference\n                    between the defendants’ pleaded case on its loss and the approach on loss\n                    which the defendants urged upon the tribunal and which the tribunal adopted is a\n                    difference of substance and not form, and one which caused prejudice to the\n                    liquidator and the secured creditors. Had the defendants’ claim in damages\n                    been put from the outset, either primarily or in the alternative, as one arising\n                    from a lost opportunity to earn profits, the tribunal would have had to inquire\n                    explicitly at an intermediate stage, between liability and assessment, into the\n                    proper percentage to be ascribed to the lost opportunity to earn profits. The\n                    liquidator and secured creditors were entitled to adduce expert evidence and\n                    made submissions on that issue. 196    To this end, the tribunal observed in the\n                    award at paragraph 451 that the liquidator’s expert accountant was\n                    instructed only to provide a critique of the report prepared by the\n                    defendants’ expert accountant and “provided no independent\n                    assessment of the damages claim”. Mr Yeap argued that having made that\n                    choice, the secured creditors and liquidator cannot now complain that it had no\n                    opportunity to adduce further evidence at the hearing. But this is precisely the\n                    point I make. Given the manner in which the defendants advanced its claim on\n                    damages, it was perfectly legitimate for the liquidator and the secured\n                    creditors to confine their defence to attacking the defendants’ assertion\n                    that it could prove on the balance of probabilities that it had suffered loss\n                    caused directly by the breach and that it could prove to the same standard the\n                    quantum of that loss. That is a different exercise from ascribing a likelihood\n                    to intermediate events between the breach and the lost profits. On the case on\n                    damages which the defendants put forward, the likelihood of those intermediate\n                    events was never in issue during the evidential phase and throughout virtually\n                    all of the submissions phase. 197    The biggest difficulty with the award which\n                    Mr Yeap had to grapple with was the lack of any analysis by the tribunal to show\n                    how it determined that the defendants had a 55% chance of making substantially\n                    enhanced profits. As the chairman of the tribunal himself recognised,\n                    “neither courts nor tribunals just pluck figures out of the air”\n                    (see [169] above). This observation is as true of lost actual profits as it is\n                    of alikelihoodof lost profits. Yet, the chairman\n                    of the tribunal himself recognised during oral submissions that the\n                    defendants’ submissions and evidence on the probability of the lost\n                    opportunity were unhelpful:[note: 19] Chairman:    … But if you now say, well, we lost\n                            the chance to raise that sort of money, and we should get temperate\n                            damages to represent that loss of a chance, what do we say? Do we say\n                            it’s 1 per cent or 10 per cent or 5 per cent of that? How do we\n                            begin? That’s where we need help. 198    Once the tribunal moved away from the\n                    defendants’ pleaded all or nothing case on damages and the binary nature\n                    of a lost actual profits claim, the secured creditors and the liquidators were\n                    entitled to an opportunity to address the tribunal on where between 0% and 100%\n                    the justifiable level of damages should rest in light of Morian law on damages,\n                    expert evidence on the issue, the likelihood of the opportunity materialising\n                    and the parties’ submissions. 199    Mr Yeap’s second argument – that\n                    the tribunal’s approach in fact left the liquidators and the secured\n                    creditors better off – is also without merit. First, as I have mentioned\n                    above, the tribunal found that the defendants were unable to prove their case on\n                    actual loss. On my reading, that is a finding by the tribunal that the\n                    defendants failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that it had suffered\n                    a loss of actual profits. That finding in itself ought to have resulted in the\n                    dismissal of the defendants’ claim on this head. The liquidator and the\n                    secured creditors have clearly been prejudiced. In any event, the issue is not\n                    whether the liquidator and the secured creditors are less worse off. Rather, the\n                    issue is whether the liquidator and secured creditor were prejudiced because\n                    they were unable to object to the inclusion of this new issue at such a late\n                    stage or because they were unable to address the tribunal on this issue with\n                    relevant evidence which could have led to a lower award of damages. I have found\n                    that they were.",
        "Conclusion on Issue 3": "200    To summarise the discussion from [155] to\n                    [198], I am satisfied that the tribunal acted in excess of its jurisdiction in\n                    making an award for damages for the loss of an opportunity to earn profits and\n                    that the award should be set aside in its entirety on this basis\n                alone.",
        "Issue 4: Did the tribunal, in awarding damages to the defendants for\n                its loss of an opportunity to earn profits fail to give the liquidator and secured\n                creditors an opportunity to address the tribunal on that question?": "201    My decision on Issue 3 renders Issue 4\n                    largely academic. I have found that characterising loss as profits actually lost\n                    is different in substance (and not merely form) from characterising loss as the\n                    loss of an opportunity to earn profits. I have also found that the\n                    recharacterisation of the defendants’ claim in this manner caused the\n                    liquidator and the secured creditors prejudice because they did not have proper\n                    notice of it and were not allowed an opportunity to address it with evidence and\n                    submissions. The conclusion must be that the liquidators and the secured\n                    creditors did not receive a fair hearing on this issue. However, for the sake of\n                    completeness, since the parties made extensive submissions on this point I shall\n                    deal with this point in slightly greater detail. 202    The secured creditors’ and the\n                    liquidator’s arguments on this point are twofold: (a)     First, they argue that by deciding\n                        the issue of damages on the basis of a lost opportunity, they were denied\n                        the opportunity to make submissions and/or introduce evidence on the\n                        likelihood of the defendants’ opportunity to earn increased\n                        profits. (b)     Second, they argue that the decision was one which was wholly at odds with\n                        the evidence tendered. 203    Mr Yeap, on the other hand, relies onSoh Beng Teefor the proposition that the\n                    court must determine that the tribunal’s decision to award damages for\n                    loss of opportunity to earn profits was “unexpected” before it the\n                    award was liable to be set aside. 204    InSoh Beng\n                        Tee, F employed S to build a condominium. Despite numerous\n                    requests for an extension of time, F gave S only a five day extension. When S\n                    was unable to complete the building works in time, F terminated S’s\n                    employment. S commenced arbitration against F. The arbitrator found in favour of\n                    S, holding that S should have a reasonable amount of time to complete the\n                    project. 205    F sought to set aside the award on the basis\n                    that the arbitrator had found that S was entitled to a reasonable amount of time\n                    to complete the project and had thereby set “time at large”\n                    without fixing what that reasonable extension of time ought to have been.\n                    Further, the issue of whether time was at large as a result of F’s acts of\n                    prevention had not been submitted on or canvassed before the arbitrator and F\n                    had been unfairly deprived of the opportunity to present countervailing\n                    arguments to the arbitrator. The trial judge found for F and set aside the\n                    award. The Court of Appeal restored the award. 206    The Court of Appeal pointed out that the\n                    pleadings filed by the parties expressly referred to the issue of whether time\n                    was at large; and noted that at the end of the hearing, the arbitrator\n                    specifically called for and gave the parties the opportunity to tender written\n                    submissions on the issue of whether time was at large. 207    The Court of Appeal held at [41] that even\n                    where the issue was not truly alive during the arbitration, that would not, in\n                    itself, amount to a breach of natural justice: 41    In addition, even if\n                            we were to determine that the issue of whether time was at large was not\n                            truly alive during the arbitration, thatper\n                                sewould not be sufficient to inexorably lead to the\n                            conclusion that the Arbitrator had necessarily failed to adhere to the\n                            rules of natural justice in denying [F] an occasion to present its\n                            contentions on the issue.It is frequently a matter\n                                of degree as to how unexpected the impugned decision is, such that\n                                it can persuasively be said that the parties were truly deprived of\n                                an opportunity to argue it.As helpfully summarised in\n                            Sir Michael J Mustill & Stewart C Boyd,The Law\n                                and Practice of Commercial Arbitration in England(Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1989) (“Commercial\n                                Arbitration”) at p 312: If the arbitrator decides the case on a point which he has invented\n                            for himself, he creates surprise and deprives the parties of their right\n                            to address full arguments on the base which they have to answer.\n                            Similarly, if he receives evidence outside the course of the oral\n                            hearing, he breaks the rule that a party is entitled to know about and\n                            test the evidence led against him. [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in bold italics] 208    As I have already mentioned above, it was\n                    clear to me that the pleadings, evidence and submissions tendered by the\n                    defendants were made purely to advance a claim for profits actually lost. In the\n                    face of that, the liquidator and the secured creditors were entitled to position\n                    their evidence and submissions to meet the defendants’ case as it was\n                    presented. 209    Mr Yeap argues that since the\n                    defendants’ loss of an opportunity to earn profits was expressly mentioned\n                    during the exchange on 21 October 2011, the liquidator and the secured creditor\n                    were not prevented from making submissions on this issue. In other words,\n                    following this exchange, they could or should have taken the initiative to ask\n                    the tribunal to hear them on the issue or to receive further written submissions\n                    addressed to this issue; but they instead elected not to do so. 210    It is important to understand in context how\n                    the loss of an opportunity issue arose. The exchange between Mr Yeap and the\n                    tribunal occurred well after the close of the evidential phase and after the\n                    parties had filed two rounds of written closing submissions on 23 May 2011 and 4\n                    July 2011 respectively. Mr Yeo, who was also counsel for the liquidator in the\n                    arbitration, addressed the tribunal on damages on 20 October 2011. The secured\n                    creditor adopted the liquidator’s submissions on the issue of damages.\n                    During Mr Alvin Yeo’s submissions, he was repeatedly assured by the\n                    tribunal that if he had not fully addressed the defendants’ submissions on\n                    damages and if the tribunal needed further assistance, he would be given a\n                    chance to address the tribunal once more. 211    The issue of loss of an opportunity arose\n                    the following day, 21 October 2011, after both the liquidator and secured\n                    creditor had completed their oral submissions on all issues. The tribunal then\n                    gave directions for the parties to file submissions on the limited issue of the\n                    relief sought by the defendants. The tribunal did not give the parties free rein\n                    to make additional submissions on whatever they chose. Further, in light of the\n                    exchange with the chairman of the tribunal in which he pointed out the\n                    difficulties in the defendants advancing a loss of an opportunity case on\n                    damages on the state of the evidence before the tribunal and in light of the gap\n                    in the submissions (see [169] and [196]), it appeared to me entirely reasonable\n                    for all counsel to assume that the tribunal proposed to deal with the\n                    defendants’ claim for relief as it had been pleaded and advanced up to\n                    that point. 212    In my view, for the reasons already stated\n                    in Issue 3, if the tribunal thought that the defendants’ claim was better\n                    considered as a claim for the loss of an opportunity to earn profits the\n                    tribunal was obliged to give the parties the opportunity to deal with this new\n                    point. Also for the reasons which I have already stated in Issue 3, I find that\n                    the liquidator and the secured creditor suffered prejudice as a result. The\n                    award should therefore be set aside in its entirety on this basis\n                alone.",
        "Issue 5: Did the tribunal fail to consider the secured\n                creditors’ arguments, evidence and submissions in relation to the Lost Land\n                Claims?": "213    The fifth issue concerns whether the\n                    tribunal breached the rules of natural justice by not having regard to the\n                    defences that the secured creditors ran in relation to the Lost Land Claims. In\n                    particular, the question is whether the tribunal wrongly assumed that the\n                    secured creditors had made a concession as to whether the parcel of land which\n                    was the subject of the Lost Land Claims was truly\n                “lost”.",
        "The background to the Lost Land Claims": "214    In the arbitration, the defendants sought\n                    damages from the secured creditors and the liquidator, alternatively an\n                    indemnity, in relation to two claims that were subsisting over land which formed\n                    part of the Plant Assets. 215    The defendants rely on the indemnity found\n                    in s 6.8 of the APA which reads: 6.8 Claims for Settlement by [the secured\n                        creditors] In the event[the secured\n                            creditors]fail to settle and discharge\n                            theClaims for Settlementby[the\n                            secured creditors],more particularly\n                            described in Part A of Schedule VI hereof, in the manner set forth\n                            therein, on or before the Closing Date, [the secured\n                        creditors] shall fully settle and discharge the same claims prior to the\n                        expiration of this APA. One (1) year prior to the expiration of this APA,\n                        [the secured creditors] and [the defendants] shall agree on the manner of\n                        the settlement and discharge of the Claims for Settlement by [the secured\n                        creditors]. It is expressly understood that [the secured creditors] shall,\n                        at all times, indemnify and hold [the defendants] completely free from and\n                        clear of any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, costs and expenses\n                        of whatever kind and nature, arising from theClaims for\n                            Settlementby [the secured creditors]. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 216    The expiration date referred to above was 15\n                    October 2012 (ie, eight years after the date of\n                    closing (see [53] above)). The “Claims for Settlement” which were\n                    the subject of the indemnity were set out at Part A of Schedule VI of the APA,\n                    which reads: CLAIMS FOR SETTLEMENT BY [the\n                            secured creditors] PART A 1.Petition for Reconstitution of Two Original Certificates of Title by\n                                [Celeborn]. This is a Petition filed in 1985 by [Celeborn] for the reconstitution of\n                        supposed titles of his mother over parcels of land with a total area of 38.2\n                        hectares in [Erebor] (which included … the 3.4071 hectares on which\n                        [a shop which forms part of the Plant Assets] is situated). This was opposed\n                        by the Government, [the Corporation]… and the City of\n                        [Erebor]. Manner of Settlement: Note that none of [the Plant Assets] subject of this\n                        Asset Purchase Agreement are included in the above-mentioned cases, except\n                        the property over which [a shop which forms part of the Plant Assets] is\n                        situated. Accordingly, the undertaking of [the secured creditors] with\n                        respect to the settlement of the cases above-mentioned shall be limited to\n                        the property over which [a shop which forms part of the Plant Assets] is\n                        situated, and the liability of [the secured creditors] shall be limited to\n                        the value of such property at the time of expropriation. … 2.[Lorien] vs. [the Corporation] Nature/Amount Involved: This is an action for ejectment brought by [Lorien] against [the\n                        Corporation]. [Lorien] claims to have bought the subject property from\n                        [Celeborn] (item 1 above). The total money judgment in favor of [Lorien] is\n                        [about US$864,000] representing yearly rental of [about US$34,000] from June\n                        1978 to June 2003 plus rental payments in arrears, attorney's fees and cost\n                        of suit. Manner of Settlement: as provided in the [Celeborn] case above, the\n                        undertaking of [the secured creditors] with respect to the settlement of\n                        this [Lorien] case shall likewise be limited to the property over which [a\n                        shop which forms part of the Plant Assets] is situated, and the liability of\n                        [the secured creditors] shall be limited to the value of such\n                        property. 217    The secured creditor’s obligations\n                    under s 6.8 of the APA read with Part A of Schedule VI of the APA were thus\n                    to settle the claims in respect of the Celeborn Claim and the Lorien Claim\n                    (which I referred to at the start as the Lost Land Claims) or before 15 October\n                    2012. If the Lost Land Claims were still not settled by 15 October 2011, the\n                    secured creditors were to agree with the defendants on the manner of settling\n                    the Lost Land Claims. 218    In addition to the indemnity in s 6.8\n                    of the APA, the secured creditors also gave the following warranty and\n                    representation under s 7.3(g) of the APA in relation to the Lost Land\n                    Claims which was supported by a similar indemnity: (g) Aside from the Designated Liabilities and the claims, Liens and\n                        encumbrances listed in the list attached hereto and made an integral part\n                        hereof as Schedules VI and VII which affect the Mortgaged Assets and which\n                        claims have been or will be settled by the relevant Party on or before the\n                        Closing Date, it is not aware and has no knowledge of any other such claims,\n                        liens and/or encumbrances of whatever kind and nature that may affect the\n                        Mortgaged Assets (the “Other Claims, Liens and Encumbrances”).\n                        In the event that it is shown that it is aware or has knowledge of any of\n                        such Other Claims, Liens and Encumbrances, it shall indemnify [the\n                        defendants] for any and all costs, expenses, obligations, liabilities,\n                        and/or damages that [the defendants] may incur in respect of any or all such\n                        Other Claims, Liens and Encumbrances. 219    The defendants’ claim appears to have\n                    come about this way. In addition to the Lost Land Claims, one Mdm Vaire had\n                    separately filed a petition in the Morian courts in 1998 claiming that she was\n                    the true owner of the land in respect of the Celeborn Claim (which is the same\n                    land as that of the Lorien Claim). Separately, the government of Moria commenced\n                    an action in October 2004 for the cancellation of title in respect of the same\n                    piece of land. Both Mdm Vaire’s claim and the government of Moria’s\n                    claim made their way to the Morian Supreme Court. On 7 July 2010, the Morian\n                    Supreme Court issued a decision that (i) upheld the grant of Mdm Vaire’s\n                    petition and (ii) reinstated the government of Moria’s\n                Claim. 220    In the arbitration, the defendants contended\n                    that the liquidator and/or the secured creditors had breached ss 2.1 and/or\n                    7.2 and/or 7.3 of the APA “in respect of the loss or absence of ownership\n                    of the lands under or in respect of [the Celeborn Claim] and [the Lorien Claim],\n                    and/or in failing to fully discharge such Claims for\n                Settlement”. 221    The defendants argued that because of the\n                    Celeborn Claim and/or the Lorien Claim and/or the decision of the Morian Supreme\n                    Court, they had lost approximately 9.5 hectares of land (which they later\n                    reduced to 6.05 hectares instead) that should have been transferred to it under\n                    the APA. On the defendants’ case, that land was lost because the Celeborn\n                    Claim and/or the Lorien Claim and/or the Morian Supreme Court’s decision\n                    meant that that land could not be transferred to it. 222    The defendants further asserted that it was\n                    entitled to be indemnified by the secured creditors, pursuant to s 6.8 of\n                    the APA in the sum of about US$23.7m for the loss of the 6.05 hectares of\n                    land.",
        "Summary of the tribunal’s decision on the Lost Land\n                Claims": "223    The tribunal found in favour of the\n                    defendants and ordered that the secured creditors pay to the defendants the sum\n                    of about US$23.7m in respect of the Lost Land Claims by way of an\n                    indemnity. 224    The tribunal’s decision on this issue\n                    can be summarised as follows: (a)     the relevant provisions of the APA\n                        in relation to the Lost Land Claims are s 6.8 and Schedule VI\n                        (paragraphs 469 to 473 of the award); (b)     Under s 6.8 and Schedule VI of the APA, the secured\n                        creditors undertook to “sort out the position” in relation to\n                        the Lost Land Claims or indemnify the defendants in respect of it. As a\n                        result of the Morian Supreme Court’s decision, the secured creditors\n                        are not in a position to sort out the position and must therefore indemnify\n                        the defendants (paragraph 476 of the award); (c)     The secured creditors’ submission that\n                        the Lost Land Claims is premature must fail because “[t]he fact that\n                        the APA gives the Secured Creditors until October 2012 to transfer the\n                        [Celeborn] Land is of no consequence in thelight of the\n                            acceptance by both[the\n                            defendants]and the Secured Creditors,\n                            that there is no prospect of the Secured Creditors being able to make\n                            the transfer” [emphasis added] (paragraph 477 of the\n                        award); (d)     The\n                        secured creditors’ submission that the Lost Land Claims is premature\n                        must also fail because “[i]t is not open to the Secured Creditors to\n                        contend, on the one hand, that the claim for indemnity is“dead”, and, on the other hand, that it is\n                        premature” (paragraph 477 of the award); and (f)     The tribunal accepted the\n                        defendants’ valuation expert’s evidence that the “full\n                        value of the freehold interest in the [Celeborn] Land” was about\n                        US$23.7m and used that as the measure of the defendants’ loss\n                        (paragraph 483 of the award).",
        "The secured creditors’ submissions": "225    Mr Singh contends that the tribunal erred in\n                    the manner in which it construed s 6.8 and Schedule VI of the APA because\n                    the clear language of the provisions (i) limited the scope of the indemnity\n                    obligations to the settlement of the Celeborn Claim and the Lorien Claim and\n                    these claims no longer existed by virtue of the Morian Supreme Court’s\n                    decision and (ii) s 6.8 requires the secured creditors to indemnify the\n                    defendants only to the extent that the defendants incurred any obligations,\n                    liabilities, damages or costs or expenses as a result of the Celeborn Claim and\n                    Lorien Claim. It does not require the secured creditors to “sort out the\n                    position” in relation to these two claims. Mr Singh however rightly\n                    concedes that this court does not exercise an appellate function over the merits\n                    of the tribunal’s decision. Thus the parties will have to live with the\n                    decision of the tribunal even if it erred in law in its construction of\n                    s 6.8 and Schedule VI.[note: 20] 226    Mr Singh asserts that the tribunal’s\n                    award on the Lost Land Claims should be set aside because the tribunal failed to\n                    consider the secured creditors’ evidence and arguments on three\n                    sub-issues: (a)     What exactly comprised the land\n                        “lost” by the defendants that formed the subject of their Lost\n                        Land Claims? (b)     Whether the land that was the subject of the Lost Land Claims were indeed\n                        “lost”? (c)     Whether the Lost Land Claims were\n                    premature? 227    In doing so, Mr Singh focused most of his\n                    submissions (rightly in my view) on the fact that the tribunal proceeded on the\n                    basis that the secured creditors had “accepted” that there was no\n                    prospect of them being able to transfer the relevant land to the defendants\n                    prior to 15 October 2012. He argues that there is no support for this acceptance\n                    in anything in the record. This was an acceptance which cut across the secured\n                    creditors’ contention that the Celeborn land was not lost (because there\n                    was still a chance that the land could be conveyed) and that any claim was\n                    premature (because the secured creditors had until 15 October 2012 to make good\n                    on their promise to settle the claims over the land). 228    Mr Singh argued that as was the case inFront Row Investment Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd v\n                        Daimler South East Asia Pte Ltd[2010] SGHC 80 (“Front Row”) where the arbitrator there mistakenly\n                    thought that one party had abandoned one part of its claim because of a\n                    concession which did not in fact take place, the tribunal here had mistakenly\n                    assumed that the secured creditors had conceded the point when it in fact had\n                    not.",
        "Did the secured creditors accept that it would be impossible to\n                transfer the land to the defendants following the Morian Supreme Court\n                decision?": "229    Mr Yeap makes several arguments to show why\n                    the tribunal was justified in stating that the secured creditors accepted that\n                    it would be impossible to transfer the land to the defendants following the\n                    Morian Supreme Court’s decision. 230    First, he argues that the secured creditors\n                    in their submissions in the arbitration never took the position that there was\n                    any prospect of transferring title to the Celeborn land to the\n                        defendants.[note: 21]He says it was not disputed by the\n                    liquidator and the secured creditors that the results of (i) the Celeborn Claim,\n                    (ii) the Lorien Claim, (iii) Mdm Vaire’s claim and/or (iv) the Morian\n                    Supreme Court’s decision were that the relevant land (which formed part of\n                    the Plant Land Assets which were to be conveyed to the defendants) had\n                    effectively been lost. He also maintains that the tribunal on several occasions\n                    put forward the proposition that the secured creditors were not in a position to\n                    transfer title in respect of the Celeborn land and that secured creditors’\n                    lead counsel in the arbitration (not Mr Singh) did not challenge that\n                    proposition on any of those occasions. 231    I cannot agree. In their initial closing\n                    submissions filed in the arbitration on 23 May 2011, the secured creditors\n                    contended expressly that there remained a chance that the Celeborn land could be\n                    transferred to the defendants: 283. Moreover, whilst the issue of ownership may have been settled between\n                        [Mdm Vaire] … on the one hand, and [Celeborn] and [Lorien] on the\n                        other hand, there are neverthelesstwo sets of\n                            proceedingsbrought by the Government of [Moria], namely, the\n                        Expropriation Proceedings, as well as the Reversionary Proceedings, which\n                        have been reinstated by reason of the Appeal Judgment. 284. The Expropriation Proceedings was originally filed on 15 August 1983,\n                        by Government of [Moria], through [the predecessor of the Corporation]. The\n                        original aim was to obtain part of the [Celeborn] Land, measuring 30.25\n                        hectares, for the use by [the Corporation] to operate the [the\n                        Corporation’s Mithril plant]. Logically, there is a possibility that,\n                        should the Expropriation Proceedings brought by the Government of [Moria] be\n                        successful, then the title to [the Plant Land Assets], insofar as they are\n                        the subject of the Expropriation Proceedings, would vest in [the defendants]\n                        (as successors in title of [the Corporation]) … 285. As for the Reversionary Proceedings, these were filed on 13 October\n                        2004, for a reversion of parcels of land … which form part of the\n                        [Celeborn] Land. 286. Given that the Expropriation Proceedings and the Reversionary\n                        Proceedings remain pending, the net effect on [the defendants] is uncertain.\n                        Therefore, it remains clear that their claim is wholly premature. 232    Mr Yeap says that these arguments were\n                    speculative and that the tribunal agreed with that view. However, he was unable\n                    to point to anywhere in the award where the tribunal agreed that it was\n                    speculative. 233    It appears that it was in fact the\n                    defendants who (incorrectly) suggested at paragraphs 327 to 331 of their initial\n                    written submissions on liability dated 23 May 2011 that the secured creditors\n                    did not challenge that the defendants had lost the Celeborn land: 327.The[secured creditors and liquidator]do not challenge that[the defendants]have indeed lost the Lost Landbut simply\n                        assert that the Lost Land claim is rendered moot by the [Morian Supreme\n                        Court Decision], as [Celeborn] was found not to be an heir of … the\n                        original owner of [the relevant parcel of land]. [The Morian Supreme Court]\n                        instead affirmed the 17 July 2004 decision of the [Morian] Regional Trial\n                        Court that a [Mdm Vaire] was the rightful heir. … 328.  It bears highlighting that the result of the\n                            aforesaid proceedings is that [the defendants] have most certainly lost\n                            such part of [the Plant Assets] whether by reason of the [Morian Supreme\n                            Court Decision] or otherwise … 329. In their cross-examination of [Mr Y, one of the defendants’\n                        witnesses], [the secured creditors’] solicitors did not challenge [Mr\n                        Y’s] evidence on the issue of Lost Land … 330. The Liquidator’s counsel also did not cross-examine [Mr Y] on\n                        the issue. 331.  In view of the fact that the [secured\n                            creditors’ and liquidator’s] counsel both did not challenge\n                            [Mr Y’s] evidence on this issue, [the defendants] humbly submit\n                            that [the defendant’s] claim in this regard should be admitted in\n                            full. 234    In their further written submissions on\n                    liability filed on 4 July 2011, the secured creditors took issue with the\n                    defendants’ “gross mischaracterisations of the Secured\n                    Creditors’ position”. Referring to the extracts from the\n                    defendants’ initial written submissions above, the secured creditors\n                    submitted at paragraphs 174 to 180: 174. Contrary to [the defendants’] misstatements … [t]he\n                        Secured Creditors have never waived their right to insist that [the\n                        defendants] do so to establish their claim. … 175. Indeed, the Secured Creditors had expressly sought to cross-examine\n                        [Mr Y] on the issue of actual loss, by reference to the fact that [the\n                        defendants] have been successfully leasing out [a shop situated on the land\n                        subject to the Lost Land Claims] to a third party without any disturbance,\n                        and in fact continue to do so. ... 176. It is therefore patently inaccurate for [the defendants] to assert\n                        that the Secured Creditors have never disputed or challenged that the land\n                        alleged to be lost was indeed lost. 177. It is also patently inaccurate for [the defendants] to assert that\n                        [Mr Y] was never cross-examined by the Secured Creditors ... ... 180. [The defendants’] flawed submissions, viz. “In view of\n                        the fat that [the secured creditors’ and liquidator’s] counsel\n                        both did not challenge [Mr Y’s] evidence on this issue, [the\n                        defendants] humbly submit that [the defendants’] claim in this regard\n                        should be admitted in full”, should therefore be firmly\n                        rejected. [emphasis in original omitted] 235    The position taken by the secured creditors\n                    in both their written submissions was entirely consistent with the position\n                    taken by the secured creditors’ lead counsel during the arbitration where\n                    he maintained that there was still a possibility that the defendants could\n                    receive title to the land.[note: 22] 236    I am therefore satisfied from the objective\n                    record that the secured creditors never conceded that there was no prospect of\n                    transferring the land to the defendants. By failing to consider the arguments\n                    which the secured creditors made in this respect, I am satisfied that the\n                    tribunal breached the rules of natural justice. 237    In the circumstances, if the tribunal had\n                    not assumed that the secured creditors accepted that there was no prospect of\n                    transferring the land subject to the Lost Land Claims to the defendants, this\n                    couldreasonablyhave made a difference to the\n                    outcome of the case since it was possible and plausible for the tribunal to\n                    conclude otherwise: that the Lost Land Claims were indeed premature or that the\n                    land was indeed not “lost”. The breach of natural justice here was\n                    therefore not of a trivial and technical nature. The tribunal’s failure to\n                    consider the secured creditors’ clearly-stated position caused prejudice\n                    to them. In any event, the defendants did not dispute that the secured creditors\n                    had suffered prejudice if I found that there was a breach of natural justice in\n                    relation to Issue 5. 238    In light of my decision, I do not have to go\n                    on to decide if Mr Singh is correct in contending that the tribunal failed to\n                    consider the secured creditors’ submissions on what exactly comprised the\n                    land “lost” by the defendants that formed the subject of the Lost\n                    Land Claims. 239    I do, however, make one observation. The\n                    tribunal noted that there was a dispute between the defendants and the secured\n                    creditors on how to value the land subject to the Lost Land Claims should\n                    liability for the indemnity be established and that “[t]he difference\n                    between the two valuations was very substantial. [The defendants’]\n                    valuation was [about US$23.7m] whereas [the secured creditors’] valuation\n                    was that the ownership interest in the [relevant parcel of land] as at [31]\n                    December 2010 was [about US$16,300]” (see paragraphs 479 and 482 of the\n                    award). 240    From the objective record it is clear that\n                    one of the key areas of disagreement was whether the “loss” should\n                    be calculated on the basis of 6.05 hectares of land (which was what the\n                    defendants contended) or based on 3.4071 hectares of land (which was what the\n                    secured creditors contended in light of the provisions in Schedule VI of the APA\n                    (reproduced at [216] above)). 241    In spite of this, the tribunal simply stated\n                    its conclusion that it preferred the defendants’ evidence over the secured\n                    creditors’ evidence and that “[t]he indemnity must be the full\n                    value of the freehold interest in the [Celeborn] Land, that is, [about\n                    US$23.7m]” (see paragraph 483 of the award). The tribunal gave no reasons\n                    for its conclusion. In those circumstances, even though I do not have to decide\n                    the point, I had much sympathy for the secured creditors’ contention that\n                    it was not given a fair hearing on the matter because the tribunal gave no\n                    indication that it had even applied its mind to the language of Schedule VI of\n                    the APA and how it ought to be construed when it came to quantifying the\n                    loss.",
        "Conclusion on Issue 5": "242    To summarise the discussion from [213] to\n                    [241] above, I am satisfied that the tribunal breached the rules of natural\n                    justice and failed to give the secured creditors a fair hearing on the issue of\n                    the defendants’ Lost Land Claims and that the parties who were jointly and\n                    severally liable under the indemnity in s 6.8 of the APA had suffered\n                    prejudice as a result.",
        "Issue 6: did the tribunal act in excess of its jurisdiction contrary\n                to Art 34(2)(b)(iii) of the Model Law by granting relief under and in respect of the\n                OMNA and the notes?": "243    My holdings thus far mean that it is\n                    strictly unnecessary to consider Issue 6. I go on to consider it nonetheless in\n                    light of the extensive submissions of the parties on this point. 244    The secured creditors and the Funds accept\n                    that the defendants’ claim for damages against the liquidator and the\n                    secured creditors for failing to deliver clean title to the Plant Assets fell\n                    within the scope of the arbitration agreement in the APA. Their complaint here\n                    is that thereliefsought by the defendants in\n                    relation to its payment obligations under the notes amountedin substanceto a pre-emptive declaration that the defendants\n                    were not liable under the OMNA and the notes. They submit further that if that\n                    is the relief that the defendants wanted, they should have sought that relief in\n                    accordance with the separate dispute resolution provision in the OMNA and not\n                    that in the APA. Therefore, in granting the relief sought by the defendants at\n                    [76(b)] and [76(c)] above, the complaint is that the tribunal exceeded its\n                    jurisdiction under the arbitration agreementin the\n                        APA. 245    Issue 6 concerns the situation where the\n                    dispute referred to the arbitrators is one that is not within the parties’\n                    arbitration agreement or that goes beyond the scope of that agreement. In this\n                    situation, the arbitral tribunal’s decision as to its own jurisdiction can\n                    be challenged afresh by the court in exercise of its original jurisdiction\n                        (cfthe court’s limited role in a\n                    challenge on the basis of natural justice):Insigma\n                        Technology Co Ltd v Alstom Technology Ltd[2009] 1 SLR(R) 23 at\n                    [21] and [22]. 246    The starting point of the analysis must be\n                    the express wording of the dispute resolution provisions in the APA and in the\n                    OMNA. Before I turn to those provisions, I should also mention as a preliminary\n                    point that it is undisputed that these provisions, like the contracts in which\n                    they are found, are governed by Morian law. Having said that, I have considered\n                    both experts’ evidence on Morian law I am satisfied that the applicable\n                    principles are not materially different from those under Singapore\n                law.",
        "The relevant provisions of the APA and the OMNA": "247    The APA’s dispute resolution provision\n                    is found in s 10, which states: DISPUTE\n                        RESOLUTION 10.1 Amicable Settlement Any dispute or controversy of any kind whatsoever arising between or among\n                        the Parties (such dispute or controversy being referred to herein as a\n                        “Dispute”) in respect of all matters relating to or in\n                        connection with this APA and also in all matters concerning the provisions\n                        of this APA and the performance of the obligations provided herein, shall be\n                        settled amicably by mutual consultations between or among the Parties as far\n                        as practicable. 10.2 Arbitration If the Dispute cannot be settled amicably within thirty (30) days by\n                        amicable settlement, the same shall be resolved through arbitration in\n                        accordance with the arbitration rules of the Singapore International\n                        Arbitration Centre (the “Centre”) for the time being in\n                        force. … 10.3 Other Defaults Notwithstanding anything herein, the provisions of Sections 10.1 and 10.2\n                        of this APA shall not apply to any default under the [OMNA], the Tranche A\n                        Note, the Tranche B Note, any of the [SLCs], the [new mortgage indenture],\n                        or any contract, agreement or document supplemental or accessory\n                        thereto.

        "The tribunal’s findings": "249    The tribunal concluded that it had the\n                    jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the defendants for the following\n                    reasons. It first decided at paragraph 85 of the award that the APA was the\n                    principal agreement governing the relationship between the parties. Thus, the\n                    tribunal held, the legal basis of the defendants’ payment obligations\n                    under the notes arose under theAPA, as the\n                    parties’ principal agreement, andnotunder\n                    the OMNA: 85. There is, in the Tribunal’s view, no doubt that the APA was the\n                        principal agreement. Nor, as will be illustrated, is there any doubt that\n                        [the defendants’] payment obligation arose under the APA and not under\n                        the [OMNA]. 86. Section 3.1 of the APA provides that “… for and in\n                        consideration of the transaction [the defendants] shall pay the Purchase\n                        Price within a period of eight (8) years from the Closing Date (the\n                        “Payment Period”,) as follows: ...”. It can, therefore,\n                        readily be seen that the obligations of [the defendants] (on the one hand)\n                        and the Liquidator and the Secured Creditors (on the other hand) were\n                        reciprocal. In exchange for the payment of the Purchase Price in the\n                        stipulated manner the Liquidator and the Secured Creditors were to transfer\n                        and deliver [the Plant Assets] free of encumbrances and [the\n                        Corporation’s Liabilities] were to be discharged. This is also evident from paragraph 88 of the award where the\n                        tribunal held: 88. ... a dispute which arises from an alleged breach by the Secured\n                        Creditors of their obligations under Section 2 of the APA requires [the\n                        tribunal] to consider whether [the defendants were] obliged to perform its\n                        reciprocal obligation and make payment of the Purchase Price. ... 250    At paragraph 99 of the award, the tribunal\n                    then held that s 10.3 of the APA properly construed meant that the dispute\n                    resolution provisions of the APA take precedence over any other dispute\n                    resolution mechanism so long as any obligation of the secured creditors’\n                    under the APA is involved: 99. … if any dispute arises between [the defendants] and the\n                        Secured Creditors relating to the alleged breach of an obligation by [the\n                        defendants] under the … Notes, the SLCs or the [OMNA] itself,which does not relate to the rights and obligations\n                            of the parties under the APA, such a matter would be excluded\n                        from the arbitration agreement in the APA notwithstanding the fact that the\n                        … Notes and the SLCs had been issued pursuant to the APA. ... [emphasis added]",
        "My decision on Issue 6": "251    With respect, I am unable to agree with the\n                    tribunal’s construction of the dispute resolution\n                provisions. (1) “Notwithstanding anything herein” and “For\n                the avoidance of doubt” 252    In my view, the phrase\n                    “notwithstanding anything herein” in the first paragraph of\n                    s 10.3 of the APA makes it clear that the parties contemplated a potential\n                    overlap between matters which would constitute a “Dispute” in\n                    s 10.1 and s 10.2 of the APA and a “default” in\n                    s 10.3. If this were not the case, s 10.3 would be completely otiose.\n                    The second paragraph of s 10.3, which begins with “[f]or the\n                    avoidance of doubt”, reinforces this construction of\n                s 10.3. 253    Further, s 10.1 and s 10.2 of the\n                    APA appeared in the parties’ transaction as early as the MOA. Section\n                    10.3, however, was introduced later, only when the dispute resolution mechanism\n                    in the MOA was migrated into the APA. To my mind, this suggests that s 10.3\n                    of the APA was inserted onlywhenthe terms and\n                    conditions of the notes were finalised and embodied in the OMNA and onlybecauseit became apparent to the parties that\n                    there might be a situation in which obligations under the APA and the OMNA might\n                    overlap. In that way, s 10.3 of the APA served to break a deadlock by\n                    directing parties to the OMNA. 254    That being the case, the question which the\n                    tribunal asked itself – that is, whether the dispute falls within the\n                    scope of the APA – is in my respectful view the wrong question. The\n                    express wording of s 10.3 of the APA requires the tribunal instead to ask\n                    itself whether this “dispute” is also a “default”\n                    within the scope of the OMNA. If it is, then under s 10.3 of the APA, this\n                    dispute ought to be decided in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions\n                    in the OMNA. 255    For the reason above, I cannot accept Mr\n                    Yeap’s submission that the tribunal was correct in finding that the APA\n                    was the principal and overarching document because it provided for the creation\n                    of the OMNA and the notes. I also cannot accept the submission that because the\n                    defendants’ payment and security obligations arose under the APA, the\n                    disputes in respect of those obligations were rightly referred to arbitration\n                    under the APA. For the same reasons, I also reject his related argument that the\n                    tribunal had the jurisdiction to deal with a matter which constitutes a breach\n                    both under the APA and the OMNA under s 10.2 of the APA. To my mind, that\n                    ignores the clear meaning and intent of s 10.3 of the APA. (2) “a default under the Omnibus Agreement” 256    But what is a default under the OMNA? A\n                    “Default” is defined in s 1.01 of the OMNA as an\n                    “Event of Default” or an event which following the lapse of a\n                    notice period would become an Event of Default. The Events of Default are set\n                    out at s 8.01 of the OMNA. They include,inter\n                        alia, (i) the failure to pay sums due under the OMNA (which would\n                    be sums due under the notes) (s 8.01(a) of the OMNA) and (ii) the failure\n                    to comply with the terms of the OMNA, the notes, the new mortgage indenture and\n                    the SLCs (s 8.01(c) of the OMNA). Therefore, by seeking the relief that it\n                    did in relation to its payment obligations under the notes, I agree with Mr\n                    Singh that the defendants were effectively and in substance seeking a\n                    prospective determination that it would not be liable for an “Event of\n                    Default” (or that it would not be in default) if it did not pay the next\n                    instalment on the notes because of the breaches of the APA by the liquidator and\n                    the secured creditor. In my view, this was a matter which fell squarely within\n                    the express carve-out in s 10.3 of the APA. 257    Mr Yeap argues (in the alternative) that the\n                    carve-out in s 10.3 of the APA, properly construed, applies only to what he\n                    calls a “pure default”. He submits that a “pure\n                    default” is different from a “dispute” under s 10.1\n                    and s 10.2 of the APA. According to Mr Yeap, a “pure default”\n                    occurs if the defendants simply refuse to meet their obligations under the\n                    notes, the new indenture or SLCs. On the other hand, it is a\n                    “dispute” and not a “pure default” if the\n                    defendants’ refusal to make payment under the notes is in some way linked\n                    to the secured creditors’ obligations under the APA. Seen in that light,\n                    Mr Yeap submits that s 10.3 of the APA is intended to break a deadlock by\n                    diverting parties to the OMNA only in the very limited situation of a\n                    “pure default”. I do not agree. I fail to see why\n                    “default” under the OMNA includes only uncontentious defaults but\n                    not defaults that were “contentious”. 258    In fact, Mr Yeap’s interpretation\n                    would lead to absurd commercial results. The defendants assumed almost all of\n                    the obligations under the OMNA. His interpretation would mean that it would have\n                    the unilateral power to dictate whether a disagreement regarding its payment\n                    obligation under the notes was to be resolved by the dispute resolution\n                    mechanism under the APA or the OMNA. Upon a default, all it would have to do is\n                    simply allege that it was relieved of its obligation to pay under the notes by a\n                    breach of the secured creditors’ obligations under the APA (however\n                    spurious). That would automatically render the matter a “dispute”\n                    and remove it from the dispute resolution mechanism in the OMNA. In my view,\n                    that could not have been the intention of the parties. That interpretation would\n                    denude s 10.3 of the APA of all practical significance. (3) Commercial considerations 259    Further, in my view, it made perfect\n                    commercial sense for the parties to have structured their dispute resolution\n                    mechanism in the manner described above. The purpose of the APA was to ensure\n                    that the Plant Assets were transferred to the defendants in exchange for the\n                    issuance of the notes. As part of the commercial transaction, these notes were\n                    meant to be (and indeed were) traded and on-sold to third parties (such as the\n                    Funds and the parties who held the notes before them) who would have absolutely\n                    no interest or involvement in the actual sale process of the Plant Assets. In\n                    fact, this was expressly contemplated by s 9.04 of the OMNA which permits a\n                    noteholder to assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the\n                    OMNA, the notes, the SLCs and the new mortgage indenture (but not under the APA)\n                    to anyone save for direct competitors of the defendants. 260    Indeed, this was the manner in which (at\n                    least some of) the original secured creditors of the Corporation managed to exit\n                    as creditors of the Corporation. The payments were thus structured to ensure\n                    that a noteholder was entitled to transfer its rights and obligations under the\n                    notes without any reference to the underlying transaction documented by the APA.\n                    I should add here that Mr Yeap’s argument that the notes were technically\n                    non-negotiable instruments does not address the real point here: that the\n                    commercial intention of the parties was plainly for the notes to be on-sold to\n                    third parties. Such third parties should not have to be, and would not want to\n                    be, concerned with any dispute arising out of the APA.[note: 24] 261    I am thus satisfied that the contractual\n                    intention of the original parties to the transaction was for the notes to be\n                    detached entirely from the APA and to take on a legal life of their own\n                    following closing. Put another way, the dispute resolution mechanism in the OMNA\n                    was the mechanism chosen by the parties to resolve all matters concerning the\n                    payment and security obligations under the notes following closing. In my\n                    respectful view, the tribunal’s construction of s 10.3 of the APA\n                    would turn the commercial rationale of the entire transaction on its head. It\n                    makes the notes a highly unattractive proposition for anyone to acquire in the\n                    secondary market. That would in turn defeat the entire purpose of structuring\n                    the transaction in the manner that the parties did. At least part of that\n                    purpose was to allow secured creditors who did not wish to be tied to the\n                    defendants for the long term to exit as creditors through the secondary market\n                    rather than through some sort of accelerated repayment, in order not to disrupt\n                    the defendants’ business or cash flow. (4) The “non-exclusive jurisdiction” of the Morian\n                courts 262    Mr Yeap argues in the alternative that\n                    s 9.08(b) of the OMNA is a permissive and not a mandatory provision. In\n                    other words, the secured creditors may choose to but, are not obliged to, go to\n                    the Morian courts to enforce their rights under the OMNA. If s 10.3 of the\n                    APA is seen in that light, Mr Yeap argues, it is not attempting to break any\n                    deadlock between the two dispute resolution provisions whenever there was an\n                    overlap. 263    This argument is, with respect, a complete\n                    non-starter. 264    The “non-exclusiveness” of\n                    s 9.08(b) of the OMNA concerns the non-exclusiveness of the Morian courtsas a forumas opposed to the non-exclusiveness\n                    of court proceedingsas the only dispute resolution\n                        mechanism. In fact, the non-exclusive nature of s 9.08(b)\n                    undermines Mr Yeap’s argument rather than supporting it. Section 9.08(b)\n                    gives the Corporation’s creditors (in this context, the noteholders) the\n                    ability to commence proceedings against the defendants in any other forum\n                        (ie, any other court) outside Moria where the\n                    defendants have assets. To my mind, this only goes to show that the dispute\n                    resolution mechanism was drafted to facilitate noteholders’ rights of\n                    recovery in the event of default. This, in my view, is entirely consistent with\n                    the construction of s 10.3 of the APA described above.",
        "Conclusion on Issue 6": "265    To conclude on Issue 6, I find that the\n                    tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by granting the relief set out at [76(b)] and\n                    [76(c)] above. Therefore, even if I am wrong on Issues 1 to 5, I would have set\n                    aside those heads of relief which the tribunal granted and which pertain to the\n                    defendants’ payment and security obligations under the OMNA and the\n                    APA.",
        "Issue 7: Did the tribunal act in excess of its jurisdiction or in\n                breach of natural justice by holding the Funds, as assignees under the OMNA and the\n                notes, liable alongside the rest of the secured creditors for breaches of the\n                APA?": "266    My findings thus far are sufficient for the\n                    Funds’ application to be allowed in its entirety. It is therefore not\n                    strictly necessary for me to determine Issue 7. I nevertheless consider Issue 7\n                    in light of the importance of this issue and the parties’ extensive\n                    submissions on this point. The issue here is whether the Funds, who purchased\n                    the right to receive payments under the notes in the secondary market and who\n                    applied voluntarily to join the arbitration as parties, can now complain that\n                    the tribunal acted in excess of its jurisdiction in finding them liable under\n                    the APA when they were: (i) not parties to the APA; and (ii) the defendants\n                    advanced no positive case against them throughout the arbitration.",
        "The background to the Funds’ involvement in the\n                arbitration": "267    As mentioned above, s 9.04 of the OMNA\n                    gave the original secured creditors of the Corporation the right to assign their\n                    rights and obligations under the Relevant Documents (which included the OMNA and\n                    the notes but crucially not the APA (see [248] above)). 268    In a series of trades between 2005 and 2008,\n                    the Funds purchased the right to receive payments under the notes on the\n                    secondary market as distressed debt. The Funds’ counterparties in these\n                    trades were not the original holders of the notes but were parties who were\n                    themselves purchasers of rights from the original noteholders. 269    The operative documents in each of these\n                    trades includes (i) a transfer agreement (which in two instances are called\n                    “assignment agreements” and in one instance is called a\n                    “sale agreement”) as well as (ii) a notice of assignment which is\n                    addressed to the facility agent for the notes (ie,\n                    AKP) and the defendants. It also appears that all the transfer agreements are\n                    governed by English law. 270    Mr Jeyaretnam maintains that these trades\n                    did not have the effect of constituting the Funds parties to the APA. Thus, he\n                    argues, the Funds were not subject to any of the obligations under the APA,\n                    including the obligation to transfer clean title to the defendants, nor were\n                    they party to the arbitration agreement contained in s 10 of the APA.\n                    According to Mr Jeyaretnam (and related to his argument on Issue 6 above which I\n                    have accepted), the entire commercial purpose of structuring notes in the way\n                    the parties did was to ensure that they could be traded on the secondary market\n                    independently of the underlying transaction comprised in the APA. 271    Although Mr Yeap contends otherwise, his\n                    contention lacks any conviction and appears to be an afterthought. The\n                    defendants did not name the Funds in their notice of arbitration in 2008.\n                    Instead, the defendants named only the original noteholders (together with the\n                    rest of the secured creditors of the Corporation). The defendants did so even\n                    though they had by then already been served notice that the relevant notes had\n                    been acquired by the Funds. 272    The Funds were formally joined as a party to\n                    the arbitration only some two and a half years later on 22 March 2011 when they\n                    volunteered to be so joined. If the defendants believed that this joinder meant\n                    that non-parties to the APA were volunteering to be liable under the APA, one\n                    would have expected them to welcome the joinder. Instead, the defendants asked\n                    for evidence that the Funds were in fact transferees or assignees before\n                    informing the tribunal that they would not object to the joinder. As I will\n                    explain, the circumstances leading up to the Funds’ joinder application\n                    are of central importance to the determination of this issue. 273    The tribunal’s award was issued in May\n                    2012. To the Funds’ dismay, the tribunal permitted the defendants to\n                    suspend without consequence their payment and security obligations under the\n                    OMNA and notes. To the Funds’ surprise, the tribunal also found the\n                    “Secured Creditors” (which the tribunal listed in Annex A to the\n                    award) to be jointly and severally liable with the liquidator to the defendants\n                    for US$80m in damages for breaches of the APA. To the Funds’ horror, they\n                    found themselves named in Annex A alongside the rest of the secured creditors\n                    (including the original noteholders) as parties liable to the defendants. In\n                    other words, the defendants achieved a thorough windfall: although they had\n                    commenced arbitration against all of the original 23 secured creditors of the\n                    Corporation, they had been given far more than they asked for. They were now\n                    able to look to the Funds in addition to these 23 secured creditors to recover\n                    under the award. 274    On 3 July 2012, the Funds applied separately\n                    from the rest of the secured creditors to set aside the award.",
        "The Funds’ submissions": "275    Mr Jeyaretnam first contends that the\n                    transfers could not and did not constitute the Funds a party to the APA. Since\n                    the Funds were not a party to the APA, they could not have incurred any\n                    obligations under the APA and ought never to have been held liable for damages\n                    arising from breaches of obligations under the APA. This argument is\n                    superficially attractive. But in my judgment, it conceals the real issue at\n                    stake on the Funds’ application which, after all, is an application to set\n                    aside the award. If the Funds became a party to the arbitration by virtue of a\n                    joinder application and if the terms of reference of the tribunal include the\n                    issue of whether the Funds are liable under the APA, Mr Jeyaretnam’s\n                    argument serves merely to attack the tribunal’s decision on the merits. It\n                    does not undermine the tribunal’s jurisdiction to hold the Funds liable\n                    under the APA. 276    On the merits, I have much sympathy for the\n                    Funds’ position. It is indeed odd that a mere assignee of rights under the\n                    notes who joins an arbitration voluntarily can end up being held to have\n                    incurred obligations to the defendants under an agreement to which it was never\n                    a party, and therefore to be jointly and severally liable to pay the defendants\n                    US$80m. Instinctively it appears to me that the tribunal’s award is wrong,\n                    at the very least because it cannot be that the original noteholdersandthe Funds are both liable at the same time. But all\n                    of this is beyond the remit of the court in a setting aside application. The\n                    Funds have to live with the tribunal’s decision, however surprising or\n                    erroneous, unless a ground for setting aside is made out. 277    The outcome of this issue therefore hinges\n                    on Mr Jeyaretnam’s alternative contention, which is that the Funds joined\n                    themselves to the arbitration only for a limited purpose, which was because they\n                    were affected by the relief sought by the defendants under the OMNA: (a)     The defendants had (wrongly)\n                        commenced the arbitration to seek to avoid its payment obligations under the\n                        notes and to prevent all noteholders from declaring an event of default. The\n                        Funds joined the arbitration only as a party affected by the relief sought\n                        by the defendants; and (b)     In its notice of arbitration, the defendants’\n                        allegations of breaches of the APA were limited to the original secured\n                        creditors (including the original noteholders) and not to assignees of\n                        entitlements under the OMNA or the notes. 278    While Mr Jeyaretnam agrees that the Funds\n                    are bound by the decision of the tribunal, he maintains that they are bound only\n                    to the extent that the decision falls within the tribunal’s terms of\n                    reference in relation to the Funds. After the Funds joined the arbitration, the\n                    defendants did not amend their notice of arbitration to assert a claim that the\n                    original noteholdersandtheir assignees and\n                    successors-in-interest wereallto be heldsimultaneouslyliable for breaches of the APA.\n                    In light of this, Mr Jeyaretnam contends that the defendants’ case for\n                    liability under the APA was asserted against only the original secured creditors\n                    (including the original noteholders). So, he submits, the question of whether\n                    the Funds (as an assignee of the notes) ought to be liable for obligations under\n                    the APA falls entirely outside the tribunal’s terms of\n                reference. 279    Mr Jeyaretnam relies on this submission to\n                    assert that the tribunal breached the rules of natural justice by not giving the\n                    Funds an opportunity to present their case on why assignees in their position\n                    should not be held liable under the APA before holding that they were so\n                    liable.",
        "My decision on Issue 7": "281    In my judgment, the resolution of this issue\n                    requires careful consideration of the manner in which the parties conducted\n                    themselves, starting with the events leading up to the Funds’ joinder\n                    application all the way until the award was issued. (1) The notice of arbitration 282    I turn first to the foundational document:\n                    the defendants’ notice of arbitration. The Funds rely on paragraph 9 of\n                    the notice of arbitration to support their argument that the defendants’\n                    presented their case as being against only the original secured\n                    creditors: 9. The Liquidator, the Secured Creditors, and/or [the shareholders of the\n                        Corporation] stand in material breach of their obligations under the APA.\n                        ... Furthermore, one or more of the Secured Creditors may have assigned or\n                        transferred their entitlements under the Tranche A Note, the Tranche B Note\n                        and/or the [OMNA] (all of which are referred to and elaborated upon\n                        hereinafter)but such assignment and/or transfer ought\n                            not derogate from the obligations and liabilities undertaken by the\n                            Secured Creditors under the APA for which there is no right of\n                            assignment on the part of the Secured Creditors. [emphasis added] 283    Mr Yeap argues that this paragraph does not\n                    mean that the defendants took the position that assignees like the Funds could\n                    never be liable under the APA. Instead, he contends that paragraph 9 is simply\n                    the defendants’ explanation as to why it believes that the original\n                    secured creditors who may have assigned or transferred their entitlements\n                        (ie, the original noteholders) nevertheless\n                    remain liable under the APA and are properly named as parties to the\n                    arbitration. In my judgment, such an interpretation of paragraph 9 is completely\n                    untenable in its context. The defendants must have believed that either the\n                    original secured creditors or the assignees (but not both) were liable. Given\n                    that the defendants would have received the notices of assignment from the Funds\n                    by the time the notice of arbitration was issued, I am satisfied that the\n                    defendants presented its case on the basis that only the original secured\n                    creditors – and not the Funds – were liable under the\n                APA. (2) A&G’s letter 3 November 2010 and the parties’\n                memorials 284    The next significant event occurred on 3\n                    November 2010 when Allen & Gledhill LLP (“A&G”) (then\n                    counsel for the secured creditors in the arbitration) wrote to the tribunal as\n                    follows: Whereas we previously acted exclusively for [AKP], we wish to inform that\n                        we have been appointed to acton the collective behalf of\n                            the Secured Creditors.A list of specific\n                            parties for whom we act is enclosedfor your\n                        reference. The 1st Memorial that we will shortly circulate is submittedon their behalf. [emphasis added] 285    The “list of Secured\n                    Creditors” which A&G enclosed included the Funds. Whatever the Funds\n                    might have intended, the letter did suggest that the Funds saw their legal\n                    position as indistinguishable from the rest of the secured creditors’ and\n                    that they adopted all the arguments in the secured creditors’ 1st Memorial\n                    which were of common application. 286    The secured creditors’ 1st Memorial\n                    contained both the secured creditors’ case in relation to the\n                    tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction to halt payment under the notes as well as\n                    its case in relation to clean title. The clean title argument, however, would\n                    not have been available to an assignee in the position of the Funds unless it\n                    was made in the alternative (ie, in the event that\n                    an assignee could also be potentially be liable under the APA). But this is not\n                    how it was presented to the tribunal. When the secured creditors’ 2nd\n                    Memorial was presented to the tribunal, the Funds’ case was once again\n                    presented without drawing any distinction between the Funds’ liability and\n                    the secured creditors’ liability. 287    Despite this, and consistent with their\n                    notice of arbitration, the defendants’ two memorials continued to present\n                    their case on the basis that only the secured creditors who were party to the\n                    APA could be held liable under the APA (to the exclusion of parties to whom the\n                    original noteholders had assigned or transferred their entitlements under the\n                    OMNA and notes). (3) A&G letters on 22 February 2011 and 11 March 2011 288    On 22 February 2011, A&G wrote to the\n                    defendants’ solicitors to inform them that it would be applying formally\n                    for the Funds to be joined as parties to the arbitration. In this letter,\n                    A&G describes the Funds as a “Secured Creditor, who was not\n                    previously named in the Notice of Arbitration” and as\n                    “[s]uccessor-in-interest” to the original\n                noteholders. 289    While I agree with Mr Jeyaretnam that it is\n                    possible to read the phrase “successor-in-interest” as suggesting\n                    that the Funds held by way of assignment only the right to be paid and did not\n                    incur any obligations, I agree with Mr Yeap that the phrase in its context\n                    suggested that the Funds were holding themselves out to be in the same position\n                    in all respects as the original noteholders. (4) The exchange with the tribunal on 22 March 2011 290    About a week into the substantive hearing on\n                    liability issues, the tribunal asked for an update on the joinder application.\n                    The defendants’ counsel informed the tribunal that the defendants wished\n                    to clarify if the Funds would be bound by the decision of the\n                        tribunal:[note: 25] Chairman:    ... So far as outstanding housekeeping\n                            matters are concerned, there’s the issue of joinder. Mr Yeap:    Yes. We’ve looked at the documents and\n                            in principle we have no objections, but I just wanted to clarify two\n                            things. Number one is that presumably, they would agree to be bound by\n                            the decision. Chairman:    If they have become parties to the\n                            arbitration then they have very little choice, having\n                        applied. Mr Yeap:    I would have thought so, yes. Presumably in the context of the application that is being made, Allen\n                        & Gledhill would be considered as representing them in the proceedings?\n                        I just wanted clarity on that point, that’s all. A&G:  Yes, we are representing the applicants to be\n                            joined. Mr Yeap:    Very well then. Yes. 291    Mr Jeyaretnam does not deny that the Funds\n                    agreed to be bound by the tribunal’s decision. He contends instead that\n                    “agreeing to be bound” means agreeing to be bound by the\n                    tribunal’s findings made “for the purpose of other proceedings\n                    … and having to take account of those and not reopen those\n                        [findings]”[note: 26]. However, while accepting that the\n                    Funds were willing to “take the rough with the smooth and would be bound\n                    by the findings of the arbitrators”, Mr Jeyaretnam maintains that this\n                    does not imply that the Funds had, by joining themselves as parties to the\n                    arbitration, signed up to being held liable for damages on a claim that was made\n                    against only the original secured creditors under an agreement to which the\n                    Funds were never a party. 292    While I have no doubt that this may have\n                    been what the Funds thought at the time (why would they otherwise volunteer to\n                    join an arbitration they need not be part of?), in my judgment, this did not\n                    appear to be the objective message that they were sending to either the tribunal\n                    or to the defendants. In the exchange above, when Mr Yeap used the phrase\n                    “bound by the decision” it was obvious that he was referring to\n                    the entire decision on the merits. The chairman’s response that\n                    “[i]f they have become parties to the arbitration then they have very\n                    little choice, having applied” showed that his underlying assumption too\n                    was that having voluntarily applied to join the arbitration in the capacity of\n                    “successor-in-interest” of a secured creditor, the Funds’\n                    joinder application was unqualified and they agreed to be treated just like the\n                    rest of the secured creditors. At no point in this exchange did counsel then\n                    representing the funds suggest that their application to be joined as a party\n                    was qualified in any way or that their position was distinct from the secured\n                    creditors’ position. 293    As a follow up to the exchange above,\n                    A&G on 24 March 2011 handed to the tribunal a document which the tribunal\n                    described as “a list of secured creditors, both under the notice of\n                    arbitration, and those represented by Allen & Gledhill and joined as\n                    parties”. This again suggested that the Funds were content with being\n                    treated as if they were in the same legal position as the rest of the secured\n                    creditors. (5) The agreed memorandum of issues 294    On 18 May 2011, after the Funds had been\n                    formally joined to the arbitration, the parties submitted an agreed memorandum\n                    of issues. Mr Jeyaretnam argues that the liability issues here were framed as\n                    being solely between the defendants and “the [Corporation’s]\n                    secured creditors” and that this made it clear that the defendants’\n                    claim was against the original secured creditors as opposed to assignees such as\n                    the Funds. 295    The problem with this construction of the\n                    memorandum of issues is that it completely undermines the Funds’ position\n                    in respect of the secured creditors’ arguments which they now say were the\n                    only arguments they aligned themselves with. For example, the following issue\n                    was stated at paragraph 6: 6. Whether [the Corporation’s] Secured Creditors are entitled to an\n                        order that [the defendants] pay [the Corporation’s] Secured\n                        Creditors: (a) the balance of the outstanding Purchase Price (in the event that the\n                        Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over the issue); and/or (b) damages for losses caused by the interim injunction ordered by the\n                        Singapore High Court and continued by the Tribunal by Procedural Order No. 5\n                        dated 7 July 2010 (in the event the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this\n                        issue). It was thus clear from an objective reading of the agreed\n                        memorandum of issues that the Funds had aligned themselves completely and\n                        without distinction with position of the secured\n                creditors.",
        "Conclusion on Issue 7": "296    In light of the above, I am satisfied from\n                    the conduct of the Funds that they joined the arbitration on the basis that they\n                    were content to be treated just like the other secured creditors, without\n                    distinction and for all purposes. Whatever may be the merits of the\n                    tribunal’s decision, I am satisfied that the tribunal acted within the\n                    scope of its jurisdiction in finding the Funds liable under the APA. Further,\n                    having aligned themselves with the position of the secured creditors, the Funds\n                    are not entitled to complain on a setting aside application that: (a)     the position of the Funds as\n                        assignees was not put squarely in issue; (b)     the tribunal dealt with the identity of the\n                        parties in only one paragraph (ie, paragraph 4\n                        of the award) without any consideration of whether the Funds ought to be\n                        treated differently from the rest of the secured\n                    creditors; (c)     that\n                        the agreed memorandum of issues did not contain the issue of the unique\n                        position of the Funds; and (d)     as a result of (a) to (c) above, it was denied natural\n                        justice because the Funds had no opportunity to present any arguments as to\n                        why their position was different from the rest of the secured\n                        creditors. Despite this, as I have\n                        already mentioned above, my decision on Issue 7 is strictly moot in light of\n                        my decision in relation to the rest of the issues.",
        "Conclusion": "297    To conclude, for the reasons given above, I\n                    allow all three applications in their entirety. 298    I shall hear the parties on costs and on any\n                    consequential orders which may need to be made.
