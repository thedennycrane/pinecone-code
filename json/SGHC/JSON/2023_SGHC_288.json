        "Introduction": "1 This case turns on a single question of fact: what was the understanding of the parties in relation to the distribution of the assets in their joint account in HSBC (“the Joint Account”) when it was closed in 2018? 2 The claimant (“Alan”) maintains that half of the assets distributed to the defendant (“Joyce”) was for her, and the other half (“the Trust Portion”) was to be held on trust for him, and that this arrangement was reached in 2018 when the parties agreed to close the Joint Account.1Foot Note 1×1st Affidavit of Chan Wei Meng (17 Jul 2023) (“A-1”) at para 48; Statement of Claim (“SOC”) at para 15.Joyce’s case is that all the assets distributed to her was for her unconditionally pursuant to an agreement reached between the parties in or around end 2007 to early 2008 when the Joint Account was opened, namely that the assets therein would be distributed equally between them.2Foot Note 2×1st Affidavit of Chan Lai Wan Joyce (17 Jul 2023) (“J-1”) at paras 29–30; Defence at para 8(b). 3 Both parties’ evidence was unsatisfactory in various aspects. Nonetheless, the legal burden is on Alan to establish his claim, and I find that he has failed to do so.",
        "The opening of the Joint Account": "4 I first turn to the opening of the Joint Account, and in particular, its purpose. I will not set out the parties’ respective cases in detail. In essence, Alan’s case is that the Joint Account was opened to “stash” Joyce’s bonus payment away from her (then) husband, Mark,3Foot Note 3×A-1 at para 23.while Joyce’s case is that the Joint Account was opened for Alan and Joyce to “pool [their] assets for investment purposes”.4Foot Note 4×J-1 at para 29. 5 Both these explanations were problematic: (a) According to Alan, Joyce approached him in May or June 2007 to say that Mark had learned of the bonus and was “pestering” her for it.5Foot Note 5×A-1 at para 20.But it is undisputed that Mark was aware of the bonus payment when it was paid in 2006.6Foot Note 6×A-1 at paras 19–20; J-1 at paras 25–26.Further, the bonus moneys were deposited, and remained, in Joyce’s POSB account for about two years.7Foot Note 7×Transcript (6 Oct 2023) at p 19 lines 2–16.It is therefore unclear how placing the bonus in the Joint Account two years later was effective or necessary to shield it from Mark. (b) On the other hand, it is undisputed that Alan was a wealthy man, certainly far wealthier than Joyce, and there was no reason why he needed to “pool” his assets with Joyce for investments. Further, he effectively had sole control over the Joint Account – only he could give instructions for making withdrawals.8Foot Note 8×A-1 at para 27.Joyce says that she was unaware of those instructions,9Foot Note 9×J-1 at para 36.but that only underscores that she left the management of the Joint Account entirely to Alan. Indeed, it is not Joyce’s evidence that she ever made any investment decision in respect of the Joint Account.10Foot Note 10×J-1 at paras 36, 38, 40. 6 It was nonetheless clear from the evidence that Alan was doing Joyce a favour. She had received a sizeable bonus of about $211,000 from her employer, and he wanted her to invest and grow it.11Foot Note 11×J-1 at paras 25, 27.The documentary evidence suggests he was teaching her about investments.12Foot Note 12×J-1 at para 28; pp 43–67.I find that it is likely that the Joint Account was opened, not to “pool” their assets as Joyce claims, but to enable her to benefit from Alan’s investment expertise and receive a better return on her bonus moneys. In this regard, I accept Alan’s evidence, which was not challenged, that he needed to put his own assets into the Joint Account to meet the minimum sum of US$1m to open such an account,13Foot Note 13×A-1 at para 30.and that he had effective control over the Joint Account. Indeed, Joyce acknowledged that all statements and correspondence relating to the Joint Account were sent only to Alan, he managed the investment portfolio under the Joint Account, and he carried out all communications with HSBC for this purpose.14Foot Note 14×J-1 at paras 34–35, 38 7 Joyce’s evidence is that there was an oral agreement between the parties – at or around the time the Joint Account was opened – that the assets (and profits generated) would be shared equally between them regardless of their initial contributions (“the Agreement”).15Foot Note 15×J-1 at paras 29–30; Defence at para 8(b).I note that in her lawyer’s letter dated 21 April 2021 (“the First QWP Letter”), sent in response to Alan’s lawyer’s letter of 9 April 2021 (“the First HEP Letter”), there was no mention of the Agreement – rather, the First QWP Letter stated that “[i]t was during the discussions concerning the closure of [the Joint Account] that parties reached an agreement on how the assets therein would be divided … in the way discussed and agreed”.16Foot Note 16×J-1 at p 110.It was only in her lawyer’s second letter dated 4 August 2022 (“the Second QWP Letter”) that she referred to the Agreement.17Foot Note 17×J-1 at p 117. 8 Alan’s counsel suggested that Joyce’s failure to mention the Agreement in the First QWP Letter indicated that the Agreement did not exist.18Foot Note 18×Transcript (6 Oct 2023) at p 13 lines 8–15.However, the First QWP Letter must be read in context. It was sent in response to the First HEP Letter, in which Alan had demanded the return of 67,500 SPH and 400,000 Genting shares, which he claimed were held on trust by Joyce for him. I discuss this demand in detail below (at [23]–[26]) as it is inconsistent with Alan’s case. Given the specific nature of this demand (for the two lots of shares), it was reasonable for Joyce not to refer to the Agreement (which was generally for the Joint Account assets and profits to be split equally and not in relation to particular assets), and to refer instead to the agreement reached between the parties in 2018 on how the specific assets in the Joint Account would be distributed.19Foot Note 19×J-1 at para 45.On Alan’s current case, about half of the 67,500 SPH and 400,000 Genting shares he was claiming to be held by Joyce on trust were agreed by the parties to belong to her. 9 Thus, although Joyce could have done so, her failure to mention the Agreement in the First QWP Letter did not necessarily indicate that it did not exist. Having said that, I note that Joyce could not offer a satisfactory explanation for what was stated in the First QWP Letter – when questioned on it during cross-examination, she responded irrelevantly that she “didn’t put everything in” and “[t]his was only the first letter”.20Foot Note 20×Transcript (6 Oct 2023) at p 11 lines 23–24. 10 Alan’s counsel suggested that Joyce’s evidence was also not credible because it made no sense (a) for her to enter the Agreement when she did not know what Alan would contribute;21Foot Note 21×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 160 lines 13–25.and (b) for Alan to enter the Agreement when he had contributed substantially more to the Joint Account.22Foot Note 22×Transcript (6 Oct 2023) at p 4 line 5–p 5 line 20.Both arguments however ignore the context: the parties were on good terms at the time, Joyce had been working for Alan in Kinetic Energy Pte Ltd (“Kinetic Energy”) for a number of years and Alan had received, or was going to receive, a substantial payout from Sumitomo Corporation (which purchased his shares in Kinetic Energy) running into the millions.23Foot Note 23×J-1 at paras 14–19, 21; A-1 at para 13.The evidence suggests that Alan was generous to his family, and it is conceivable that he would agree to help Joyce financially.24Foot Note 24×J-1 at para 8; 1st Affidavit of Justin Ho (17 Jul 2023) (“JH-1”) at para 4; 1st Affidavit of Jamie Ho (17 Jul 2023) (“JH-2”) at para 4; 1st Affidavit of Chan Lai Peng (17 Jul 2023) (“E-1”) at para 5.Further, his conversation with Joyce’s children and text message to his other sister (see [27]–[28] below) suggests that he also intended to benefit Joyce’s children, whom he was very close to. All these explain why Joyce trusted Alan and Alan’s generosity towards Joyce.",
        "The closure of the Joint Account and the distribution of assets": "11 I now turn to the evidence relating to the closure of the Joint Account and the distribution of assets, which I found more relevant to the dispute. 12 Joyce’s case was that the assets were distributed equally as per the Agreement.25Foot Note 25×J-1 at para 44.Alan’s counsel pointed out that the distribution was not equal in that Alan received about $77,000 more than Joyce, and Joyce did not question this.26Foot Note 26×Transcript (6 Oct 2023) at p 6 lines 5–16.I do not find that this is inconsistent with or undermines Joyce’s evidence. When the Joint Account was closed, it had about $2.8m worth of assets.27Foot Note 27×J-1 at para 42.Joyce was receiving just under $1.4m from a contribution of $250,000.28Foot Note 28×J-1 at para 45.The $77,000 difference was therefore insignificant – a difference of under 3% of the total value of the assets in the Joint Account. More importantly, it is undisputed that most of the assets in the Joint Account were contributed by Alan. Joyce testified that Alan had given her other moneys, and she therefore saw no reason to question why it was not an equal split.29Foot Note 29×Transcript (6 Oct 2023) at p 7 lines 3–6.I accept her explanation. Indeed, to question the relatively small difference in the split as suggested by Alan’s counsel would have been churlish and ungrateful. 13 Further, the manner of the division supports Joyce’s case. She explained that the local shares in the Joint Account were transferred to her as she had no account to hold the foreign shares.30Foot Note 30×J-1 at para 44(a).Significantly, Alan then made up the difference in value between the foreign and local shares by transferring $400,000 in cash to Joyce.31Foot Note 31×J-1 at paras 44–45; Transcript (6 Oct 2023) at p 6 lines 17–23.A precise 50–50 split would require him to transfer about $438,000 to her. It was therefore reasonable that he would round down (in his favour) the cash figure to $400,000. 14 The deliberate allocation of the assets in the Joint Account was therefore consistent with Joyce’s case that the parties had agreed to split the assets in the Joint Account equally. 15 In contrast, Alan offered no explanation for the way the assets were divided –ie, why the amount he decided to give Joyce, together with the Trust Portion, came up to half of the total value of the assets in the Joint Account. His explanation for giving Joyce much more than her contribution was also not supported by the facts. I found this a serious deficiency in his case. 16 Alan’s case was that he decided to transfer about $700,000 to Joyce, comprising her initial investment of $250,000 plus some funds to “assist her and/or her children financially”.32Foot Note 32×A-1 at para 43.However: (a) he offered no explanation in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) as to how or why he arrived at the figure of $700,000; nor was any explanation put to Joyce; (b) he offered no explanation at all why the division of the Joint Account roughly corresponded to a 50–50 split, although he was aware that was Joyce’s case which he needed to respond to. In particular, he did not explain why he decided to transfer Joyce $400,000 in cash; (c) his case that he decided to help Joyce financially partly because she had informed him that she might have cancer was contradicted by the evidence.33Foot Note 33×A-1 at para 41(a).According to Joyce, she only discovered the tumour in or around January 2019, well after the Joint Account was closed, and that evidence was not challenged;34Foot Note 34×J-1 at para 65.and (d) significantly, Alan entirely failed to put to Joyce his case as to why he was giving her more than the amount she had contributed to the Joint Account (plus returns). 17 During oral closing submissions, Alan’s counsel submitted that the eventual 50–50 split had been arrived at as a “coincidence”, after Alan had calculated the respective amounts that he wanted to give Joyce.35Foot Note 35×Transcript (11 Oct 2023) at p 47 line 16–p 48 line 1.However, this explanation did not appear in his AEIC. Given that it was Joyce’s case that the 50–50 split was arrived at as a result of the Agreement, it was incumbent on Alan to provide his own explanation for the 50–50 split in order to show why Joyce’s case was false. His failure to do so left Joyce’s account as the only explanation for the 50–50 split. I also find it doubtful that such a close 50–50 split was arrived at coincidentally. 18 Further, Alan failed to put to Joyce his case as to why he decided to have her hold the Trust Portion for his wife and children. It was Alan’s evidence that this was done at the suggestion of Joyce to protect his wife and children, but this was not put to Joyce.36Foot Note 36×A-1 at para 45. 19 Further, Alan’s case that he wanted Joyce to hold the Trust Portion to protect his wife and children did not make sense: (a) it is undisputed that the Trust Portion (valued at about $700,000) was a fraction of Alan’s assets at the time. It was therefore unclear why he would be concerned about the interests of his family only with respect to the Trust Portion. No evidence was led as to how he had protected his family with respect to his other assets; (b) Alan did not explain why he wanted Joyce to hold the Trust Portion when she was not experienced in investment or managing financial assets. Further, Alan was a customer of HSBC Private Banking and would no doubt have had access to their trust services; (c) it made no sense for Alan to entrust Joyce with the Trust Portion to protect his family when one of his stated reasons for closing the Joint Account was that Joyce may have cancer and needed money;37Foot Note 37×A-1 at paras 41, 43. (d) it is odd that Alan would protect his family without the alleged trust being evidenced in writing. Alan says that no written confirmation was needed because he trusted Joyce and she was family.38Foot Note 38×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 69 line 5–p 71 line 7.But Alan’s evidence is that his own wife did not know the details of the trust until 2019.39Foot Note 39×A-1 at para 59.While he claims Joyce told him she would inform their sister, Chan Lai Peng (“Elsie”) and Joyce’s children, Justin Ho (“Justin”) and Jamie Ho (“Jamie”) about the trust,40Foot Note 40×A-1 at para 48.that would not avoid difficulties should Joyce pre-decease him or something unexpected happens to him. In that event, he or his family may have difficulties reclaiming the Trust Portion. It is therefore difficult to see how an oral arrangement protected his family; (e) even worse, Alan claims that Joyce had told him in late 2017 that she was afraid Mark and his children would “harass” her for her bonus.41Foot Note 41×A-1 at para 41(b).If so, his or his family’s claim over the Trust Portion would be vulnerable should something happen to Joyce; and (f) in February or March 2020, Alan learned that Joyce had divorced Mark,42Foot Note 42×A-1 at para 55.which would have made any assets in her name vulnerable to matrimonial distribution. Yet, he made no effort to recall the trust or confirm it in writing. He only sent his lawyer’s demand (ie, the First HEP Letter)a year later in April 2021,43Foot Note 43×A-1 at para 75.and even then, took an inconsistent position as to what comprised the assets under the trust (see [23] below). 20 Alan’s counsel highlighted that Joyce had also failed to put her case to Alan that (a) she did not ask for additional funds from him; and (b) she did not suggest holding assets on trust for him as he claimed. I disagree that Joyce’s failure to do so warrants the same consequences – these were positive averments made by Alan which Joyce was simply denying; further, the burden was on Alan to prove the trust, and he must therefore put his factual assertions with respect to the trust, including its formation, to Joyce. He failed to do so. 21 Alan’s subsequent conduct was also inconsistent with his case on the Trust Portion. 22 First, he sent Joyce a WhatsApp message dated 11 March 2021 asking for the return of “at least $1,000,000 that [she] took from [him]”,44Foot Note 44×A-1 at para 74, p 183.which was plainly inconsistent with his case. Alan explained that this was a test – he had deliberately exaggerated the figure so that if Joyce responded to correct him by saying that the Trust Portion was only about $700,000, he would have secured evidence in writing of the trust; if she denied the request altogether, then he would know her position.45Foot Note 45×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 31 line 10–p 32 line 8.This explanation did not appear in his AEIC. In fact, in his AEIC, he referred to the message as “regarding [Joyce] returning me the assets held under trust” when that was plainly not the case.46Foot Note 46×A-1 at para 74.In any event, this appeared a peculiar way to test Joyce. Alan could simply have asked for the Trust Portion directly – Joyce’s answer to this direct question would have given him the same results as under the two scenarios for the “test” question. In the event, Joyce did not respond. Even if I were to grant Alan the benefit of the doubt on this incident, the other matters below weaken his case. 23 Second, in the First HEP Letter,47Foot Note 47×A-1 at pp 187–188.Alan asserted that the trust comprised 67,500 SPH and 400,000 Genting shares48Foot Note 48×A-1 at p 187.– that is different from what he now claims comprises the trust.49Foot Note 49×A-1 at para 50.This position was only corrected more than a year later in his lawyer’s second letter dated 8 July 2022.50Foot Note 50×A-1 at para 81, pp 209–213.Alan’s explanation for the inconsistent position was convoluted. He testified that before coming to the decision to ask Joyce to hold some assets on trust for him, the assets from the Joint Account which he planned to give Joyce were $400,000 in cash, 20,000 SGX shares, and 80,000 Genting shares (“Joyce’s Original Portion”),51Foot Note 51×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 40 lines 7–11.which was worth $670,000 at the time.52Foot Note 52×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 40 lines 8–11.After deciding to ask Joyce to hold some assets on trust for him, he added 67,500 SPH and 400,000 Genting shares to the assets to be transferred to her (“the Additional Portion”).53Foot Note 53×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 40 lines 16–20.The Additional Portion was worth slightly more than $700,000 at the time.54Foot Note 54×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 40 lines 18–20.He then claimed that out of the total group of assets to be transferred to Joyce (ie, Joyce’s Original Portion and the Additional Portion combined), they simply agreed that half of it (without specifying which components) would be the Trust Portion.55Foot Note 55×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 40 lines 20–22. 24 In April 2021, when Alan decided to issue the First HEP Letter, he demanded the return of the 67,500 SPH and 400,000 Genting shares (ie, the Additional Portion), rather than half of all the assets transferred to Joyce, because the value of the Additional Portion had dropped from $700,000 to $450,000.56Foot Note 56×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 41 lines 2–10.Meanwhile, the value of Joyce’s Original Portion had remained at around $670,000. He was willing to only take back the Additional Portion as by doing so, he thought Joyce would acknowledge that he was absorbing most of the loss in the value of the assets, and would therefore agree to return the Additional Portion.57Foot Note 57×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 41 lines 10–21. 25 Alan’s demand for the Additional Portion could be consistent with two scenarios – (a) a trust arrangement over vaguely “half” of the assets (which in the First HEP Letter, allegedly out of magnanimity, he decided to claim the Additional Portion as); or (b) simply demanding back from Joyce a portion of the assets which he had given her when the Joint Account was closed, which would be contrary to his case. 26 Nonetheless, I do not accept Alan’s explanation: (a) Alan testified that he did not tell his lawyers about the actual trust arrangement as he hoped that Joyce would accept his gesture and the dispute would be quickly resolved.58Foot Note 58×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 41 lines 11–21, p 47 lines 19–25, p 48 lines 16–20.It is unclear to me how telling his lawyers the reason for asking for the Additional Portion would have disadvantaged him or delayed the resolution of the dispute; (b) Alan could have set out the terms of the trust as he now claims in the First HEP Letter, and explicitly stated that he was offering to dissolve it on terms beneficial to Joyce. That would have been a more effective gesture. Instead, in the First HEP Letter, he threatened to sue Joyce if she did not give in to his demand;59Foot Note 59×A-1 at p 187.and (c) most importantly, he did not include the above explanation in his AEIC. During cross-examination, his response was that he knew he would be asked about this at trial – this was a weak riposte given that the First HEP Letter contained a clearly inconsistent demand which called for an explanation.60Foot Note 60×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 44 lines 16–24. Hence, I find his account to be an after-thought. 27 Third, on 12 February 2021, Alan met with Justin and Jamie at his home.61Foot Note 61×A-1 at para 66.He testified that he told them that Joyce took $1.6m from him and that some of it was given by him to Joyce for them,62Foot Note 62×A-1 at para 67.although he did not mention the amount. He claimed that this was to test whether the children, specifically Justin, had been told by Joyce of the trust arrangement.63Foot Note 63×Transcript (5 October 2023) at p 87 lines 19–25. 28 Alan claimed that after this conversation with the children, he wanted to find out if Joyce had told Elsie about the trust arrangement.64Foot Note 64×A-1 at para 71.Hence, he sent a WhatsApp message to Elsie to say that he had transferred $1.6m to Joyce and that this was mainly for her children.65Foot Note 65×A-1 at para 71, pp 174–175.Again, Alan described this as a test to check whether Joyce had informed Elsie of the trust.66Foot Note 66×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 36 line 21–p 37 line 11.This explanation was more puzzling than the previous “test”. Alan could have simply asked Elsie if Joyce had informed her of the trust. He claimed under cross-examination that he could not do so because Joyce’s children were with him at the time.67Foot Note 67×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 90 lines 11–18, p 94 lines 17–23.But this was a text message to Elsie, which he did not have to show, and which he did not claim to have shown, the children. Further, if it was a test to see if Elsie was aware of the trust, there would be no need for him to add the line “[k]indly noted that this money are [sic] mainly for her 2 kids”.68Foot Note 68×A-1 at p 176.In fact, he did not respond when Elsie simply replied, “[o]k noted”,69Foot Note 69×A-1 at p 176.which did not address what Elsie may or may not have been told by Joyce. He then claimed he called Elsie about a month after the text exchange but admitted that he still did not mention the trust in that conversation.70Foot Note 70×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 91 line 24–p 92 line 3, p 95 lines 20–24.I note that he did not mention calling Elsie in his AEIC,71Foot Note 71×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 92 lines 4–10.nor was such a conversation put to her. 29 I note that one aspect of Justin and Jamie’s evidence which was not challenged was that Alan had explained that the reason he was telling them about the Joint Account was because he wanted them to be aware of the existence of the Joint Account and the moneys therein, that the Joint Account was a good investment decision, and that they should not let it go to waste and use the moneys for their education.72Foot Note 72×JH-1 at para 14; JH-2 at para 16.On his own evidence, he informed the children that Joyce had taken $1.6m from him. Put together, this suggested thatallthe monies transferred to Joyce was to benefit her and the children, which is also consistent with his text to Elsie. 30 If Alan wanted to find out if Joyce had informed Elsie and the children of the trust, which she allegedly had promised to do,73Foot Note 73×A-1 at para 48.there was no reason why he could not have asked them about it directly. He did not. Instead, the impression he gave is one consistent with Joyce’s story – that the assets in the Joint Account distributed to her were unconditionally hers. 31 For completeness, I do not place weight on the children’s evidence that Alan had informed them that he had a “secret” account with Joyce and that they had agreed to close the account and split the assets “equally”.74Foot Note 74×JH-1 at paras 11,13; JH-2 at paras 13, 15.Under cross-examination, they both confirmed that Alan did not actually say those words, and that it was an impression they formed.75Foot Note 75×Transcript (6 Oct 2023) at p 28 lines 2–8, p 34 lines 4–6.",
        "Miscellaneous issues – the cheques": "32 Both parties devoted some attention to certain cheques issued by Alan in favour of Joyce. Joyce claimed that after the Joint Account was opened, Alan “would periodically issue [her] cheques for [her] share of the profits under the Joint Account”.76Foot Note 76×J-1 at para 39.In so far as this was meant to bolster the existence of the Agreement, Joyce’s testimony under cross-examination contradicted her claim – she admitted that Alan did not tell her that the cheques were her investment earnings, and simply said that they were “for her”.77Foot Note 77×Transcript (6 Oct 2023) at p 17 line 13–p 18 line 2. 33 Alan’s account in relation to the cheques was also unsatisfactory. Counsel for Joyce pointed to a cheque book entry recorded by Alan on 2 January 2008 showing that $15,000 was provided to “CHAN LAI WAN [ie, Joyce] (PROFIT ON SHARES)”.78Foot Note 78×Agreed Bundle of Documents (19 Sep 2023) at p 119.Alan also exhibited this cheque book entry in his AEIC, but the “PROFIT ON SHARES” portion of the entry was redacted.79Foot Note 79×A-1 at p 223.His explanation was that he paid the $15,000 to Joyce to compensate her for taking care of their mother, Mdm Oi Joh Chan (“Mdm Oi”), and he did not want the cheque book entry to reflect that purpose.80Foot Note 80×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 126 line 14–p 129 line 12.He said that he redacted the entry because it had “nothing to do with this case”.81Foot Note 81×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 130 line 20–p 131 line 3.I reject this explanation – it did not make sense for Alan to record the payment to be specifically for “profit on shares” in order to hide the fact that it was actually moneys for Mdm Oi’s maintenance. Any other description, or simply an omission of one, would have sufficed. Further, the chequebook was Alan’s and it was unclear, and he did not explain, why he would need to disguise the entry. The subsequent redaction of the entry was also suspect. 34 Joyce’s counsel also pointed out that Alan’s explanation of the origin of the unredacted cheque book entry was false.82Foot Note 82×Defendant’s Written Submissions (“DWS”) at para 14.Alan had explained that he adduced the redacted cheque book entry but not the unredacted copy,83Foot Note 83×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 132 lines 3–13.and that it was Joyce who had obtained the unredacted copy from previous Tribunal of Maintenance of Parents proceedings involving Mdm Oi.84Foot Note 84×Transcript (5 Oct 2023) at p 132 line 14–p 133 line 8.However, Alan’s counsel subsequently explained that the unredacted copy was in fact disclosed by Alan, not Joyce.85Foot Note 85×Letter from Harry Elias Partnership to the Court (9 Oct 2023).In so far as Alan’s explanation appeared to be an attempt to cover up the fact that the redaction was done during the course of preparation for this action, I find this aspect of his testimony to be suspect as well. 35 In any case, it was unclear to me how this cheque book entry related to the profits from the Joint Account investments. The Joint Account was opened in March 2008,afterthe cheque book entry which was dated 2 January 2008.86Foot Note 86×A-1 at para 27.Joyce claimed that pending the opening of the Joint Account, Alan had in or around end 2007 or early 2008 begun making investments on behalf of Joyce and himself jointly, pursuant to the Agreement.87Foot Note 87×J-1 at para 32.It was therefore her case that the cheque book entry related to profits from these investments. But it was Joyce’s testimony that her bonus moneys were kept in her POSB bank account from when she received them in 2006, and were not touched until they were applied to the Joint Account in 2008.88Foot Note 88×Transcript (6 Oct 2023) at p 19 lines 2–16.Hence, the investments made by Alan prior to the opening of the Joint Account could not have involved any of her moneys, and could not be said to have been “joint” investments. Indeed, on Joyce’s own case, the Agreement related only to assets and profits of the Joint Account.89Foot Note 89×J-1 at para 30.Finally, I note that even if Alan had given Joyce some investment earnings from time to time (whether from the Joint Account or not), it does not mean that he did so pursuant to an agreement to split the assets and profits from the Joint Account equally. I therefore placed no weight on the said cheque payment.",
        "Conclusion": "36 For the above reasons, I do not find that the Trust Portion was transferred to Joyce to hold on trust for Alan. I also dismiss the claim for a resulting trust – the evidence suggests that parties intended an equal and unconditional split of the assets in the Joint Account and for the Trust Portion to belong to Joyce. Alan also ran a case on a constructive trust, but that was not pleaded. In any event, based on my findings of fact, no constructive trust was formed. 37 I therefore dismiss the claim with costs to Joyce. Parties are to file their submissions on costs within seven days. For completeness, the time for appealing runs from the date of this judgment. 38 I close on this observation. On my findings and taking Joyce’s evidence at its highest, Alan had made a very generous gift to her. She must accept that the $1.4m she received was largely contributed by Alan. This appears in keeping with Alan’s nature – there is evidence that he routinely made gifts to family members, including to Joyce and her children.90Foot Note 90×J-1 at para 8; JH-1 at para 4; JH-2 at para 4; E-1 at para 5.Yet, Joyce ran her case based on what she says she is entitled to, without any acknowledgment of the generosity shown to her. This is unfortunate, and a matter which I hope will be acknowledged and addressed in time. Hri Kumar NairJudge of the High Court Tan Chau Yee, Kok Yee Keong and Toh Ming Wai (Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the claimant; Derek Tan Chang Shen, Tan Jee Ming and Chow Ee Ning (Quahe Woo & Palmer LLC) for the defendant."
