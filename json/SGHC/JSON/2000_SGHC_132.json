        "Advances": "25. On 3 November 1993 Mr Lee wrote to\n\nBeng Tiong:\"This is the written request pursuant\n\n  to clause 2.3 of the agreement between us dated 10th August 1993. In order to enable me to\n\n  perform work and pay expenses to ensure the sale of the Properties referred to in the\n\n  agreement to your Company, please pay to me the balance of the advances referred therein.\n\n  As you have already advanced to me the sum of $110,000, the balance of the advances which\n\n  is the subject of this request is $40,000.\"It is not disputed that Beng Tiong had\n\nadvanced $110,000 and that there was a balance of $40,000 to be advanced under cl 2.3.\n\nBeng Tiong did not respond to this request.26. On 14 January 1994 Mr Lee wrote to\n\nBeng Tiong:\"I refer to my letter dated 3rd\n\n  November 1993 and note that you have, to date, not responded to my request to pay to me\n\n  the balance of the advance requested.This letter is to request and demand that\n\n  you comply with the provisions of clause 2.3 of our agreement dated 10th August 1993 and\n\n  pay the balance of the advance stipulated in the agreement to me within a period of seven\n\n  days from the date of this letter.\"It is not disputed that no part of the\n\n$40,000 requested was advanced in response to either of these letters or at all.27. What cl 2.3 provides is an undertaking\n\nby Beng Tiong to make the advance \"if [Mr Lee] requests in writing (strictly for\n\npurpose of enabling [Mr Lee] to ensure the sale of the Properties to [Beng Tiong]\".\n\nThe only condition for the advance is Mr Lee’s written request. The defence is that\n\nMr Lee mustsatisfyBeng Tiong as to the purposebeforeBeng Tiong was\n\nobliged to make any advance. That is quite simply not what cl 2.3 provides. Mr Lee has\n\nmade a written request for the advance under cl 2.3. He specifically referred to this\n\nclause. He went on to say what the purpose was and the purpose was well within the terms\n\nof cl 2.3.28. I see no reason to construe cl 2.3 in\n\nthe way pleaded in Beng Tiong’s defence. No mention is made anywhere in the agency\n\nagreement as to any requirement to satisfy Beng Tiong as to the purpose of the advance and\n\nto do so before it was obliged to make the advance. I see no reason to imply such a term.\n\nThe agency agreement will not be unworkable without it. Such a term is contrary to the\n\nexpress provisions of cl 2.3.29. In my judgment Beng Tiong failed,\n\nrefused or otherwise neglected to effect payment of the balance of $40,000 as an advance\n\nin breach of cl 2.3 of the agency agreement as alleged in the statement of claim.Non-interaction30. Mr Lee said in his affidavit:\"On or about November 1993, Ms Maggie\n\n  Chiang, in the presence of Ms Patricia Lim and one Ricky Chua, the Managing Director of\n\n  Property Workshop Pte Ltd admitted to me in the offices of Property Workshop Pte Ltd that\n\n  she had met with some of the beneficiaries on or about November 1993 together with Ms\n\n  Patricia Lim and the Managing Director of Property Workshop.\"He was not cross-examined on this but Ms\n\nChiang said under cross-examination that she disagreed with this.31. Ms Chiang said in her affidavit:\"I did meet a few of the alleged\n\n  beneficiaries, including the one named Quresh. However, this was a purely social\n\n  engagement and was arranged by [Mr Lee’s] agent, Ms Patricia Lim. I had met the said\n\n  person together with the other alleged beneficiaries in Indonesia through the arrangement\n\n  of [Mr Lee] and had been invited to a meal with them. When some of the alleged\n\n  beneficiaries were in Singapore towards the end of 1993, I returned the courtesy by\n\n  inviting them to a meal at an Indonesian restaurant at Centrepoint ....During the meeting, Quresh openly told me,\n\n  through a member of my staff I invited along as interpreter, that the beneficiaries or, at\n\n  least, the majority, for whom he claimed to speak, had no intention of agreeing to sell\n\n  the shophouses to [Beng Tiong].\"Under cross-examination she said she met\n\nMr Quresh and another person whose name she did not know. She said she only met two of the\n\nbeneficiaries and what she said in her affidavit about having metsomeof the\n\nbeneficiaries was not correct.32. Ms Chiang said:\"Q: When you met these two\n\n  beneficiaries. Patricia Lim present?A: Yes.Q: Ricky Chua present?A: Yes.....Q: You first obtained prior consent of\n\n  plaintiff before meeting them?A: No.\"Neither Ms Lim nor Mr Chua was called to\n\ngive any evidence.33. \"To interact\" is to act\n\nreciprocally or to act on each other. Ms Chiang invited Mr Quresh and another beneficiary\n\nto a meal at a restaurant in a public place. She made no secret of it. Mr Chua and Ms Lim\n\nwere present. Upon that occasion Mr Quresh told her that the beneficiaries or the majority\n\nhad no intention of agreeing to sell the properties to Beng Tiong. I think Ms Chiang did\n\nact on Mr Quresh and the other beneficiary whom she invited to the restaurant. I think it\n\nwas the occasion that prompted Mr Quresh to say what he did.34. Ms Chiang went on to say under\n\ncross-examination:\"Q: Meeting with two beneficiaries.\n\n  You subsequently informed plaintiff of this meeting?A: No.Q: AB-236. You received?(Note: AB-236 is Mr Lee’s letter of 3\n\n    November 1993 requesting the advance of $40,000.)A: Yes.Q: After receiving what you did?A: Contacted plaintiff.Q: What you said to him?A: I told him I already paid him $110,000.\n\n  However he did nothing and now he was asking another $40,000. How I was to explain to my\n\n  company.Q: What he said in response?A: Said he needed this money so that he\n\n  could liaise with beneficiaries.\"Ms Chiang had paid $110,000. She had also\n\npaid $250,000 when the agency agreement was signed. Until she received the request for\n\nanother $40,000 there is no evidence that she thought Mr Lee had done nothing. I think\n\nwhen Ms Chiang told him that she had by then met Mr Quresh in Singapore. She would have\n\nbeen influenced by what Mr Quresh had told her when she told Mr Lee that he had done\n\nnothing.35. I think Ms Chiang did interact with Mr\n\nQuresh and I find accordingly. She did not obtain Mr Lee’s prior consent to do so. In\n\nmy judgment Beng Tiong has by its managing director as its agent or employee interacted\n\nwith Mr Quresh and another beneficiary in breach of cl 2.2 of the agency agreement.Damages36. There is no allegation in the\n\nstatement of claim that Mr Lee has suffered any loss or incurred any expense as a\n\nconsequence of the breach of cl 2.2 or cl 2.3. However there is a claim for damages apart\n\nfrom a claim for damages for repudiatory breaches.37. Mr Lee’s primary obligation was\n\nto secure the execution by the estate of Shaik Ahmad of the agreement for the sale of the\n\nproperties to Beng Tiong. See cl 3.8 of the agency agreement. Although cl 3.8 refers to\n\nthe estate it is not disputed that the agreement would have to be signed by the persons in\n\nwhom the properties were vested whether as legal personal representatives or as trustees.\n\nWhen the agency agreement was signed the properties were vested in the Public Trustee but\n\nit is clear that the intention of the parties as appears from the agency agreement was\n\nthat the agreement for sale of the properties was to be signed by new trustees.38. As recited in the agency agreement the\n\nagreement for the sale of the properties by the estate was to be signed \"upon the\n\nEstate’s successful application in Originating Summons No 489 of 1993 for\n\nsubstitution of the trustees of the Estate\". As noted above that was an application\n\nto appoint Syed Ali and Mr Ng to be trustees in place of the Public Trustee. Unless these\n\ntwo new trustees were appointed in place of the Public Trustee there would be no agreement\n\nfor sale of the properties to Beng Tiong to be secured by Mr Lee.39. The proceedings in Originating Summons\n\nNo 489 of 1993 have not been produced before me but Mr Lee said under cross-examination:\"Q: Lee (2). Para 42. By time you\n\n  asked for $40,000 true beneficiaries already turned hostile to whole deal?A: Yes.Q: True by then application OS 489 of 1993\n\n  to appoint new trustees unsuccessful? By time you first asked for $40,000?A: To best of my recollection, no. Believe\n\n  application withdrawn between 3/11/93 and 14/1/94.Q: True application withdrawn due to\n\n  opposition by some beneficiaries?A: True. By two beneficiaries who did not\n\n  sign agreement.\"The \"agreement\" which two of the\n\nbeneficiaries did not sign is the document dated 12 August 1993 signed by 12 of the\n\nbeneficiaries expressing their consent to the sale of the properties by the proposed new\n\ntrustees to Beng Tiong. Mr Lee’s evidence here is that the application was withdrawn\n\nbetween 3 November 1993 and 14 January 1994.40. In his affidavit filed on 4 April 1995\n\nin Suit No 1550 of 1994 he said:\"On or about September 1993, Quraisj\n\n  [also spelt ‘Quresh’] and four of the defendants: Harits, Abu Bakar, Ishak and\n\n  Abdul Azis began taking various steps to cancel the appointment of the Attorneys, the\n\n  proposed Trustees and withdraw Originating Summons No 489 of 1993. Quraisj also wrote a\n\n  letter dated 14 August 1993 dismissing the appointment of [Mr Ng] and [Syed Ali].\"The evidence in this affidavit appears to\n\nbe that in or about September 1993 Mr Quresh and four of the defendants had begun taking\n\nsteps to withdraw the application.41. In the same affidavit Mr Lee also\n\nsaid:\"On 3 August 1994, Quraisj on behalf\n\n  of the defendants, instituted proceedings by way of Originating Summons No 745 of 1994\n\n  seeking inter alia to appoint the 6th, 7th, 8th and 10th defendants as proposed new\n\n  trustees of the Will of the Testator in place of the Public Trustee ....\"There were 11 defendants in the action and\n\nall of them including the four proposed new trustees were 11 of the 12 beneficiaries who\n\nhad signed the document dated 12 August 1993. Mr Quresh was one of the defendants.42. In Originating Summons No 745 of 1994\n\nMs Animah bte A Gani said in her affidavit filed on 19 October 1994:\"The [Public Trustee] would agree to\n\n  relinquish its duty as trustee of the Testator’s estate only upon the following:-a. Grant of Letters of Administration must\n\n  be taken out for the estates of the deceased immediate beneficiaries of the Testator.b. The duly appointed administrators of\n\n  the estates of the deceased immediate beneficiaries of the Testator to obtain the consent\n\n  of all the beneficiaries that they are in agreement to the appointment of new trustees for\n\n  the estate of the Testator.\"She pointed out in her affidavit that\n\neight of the immediate beneficiaries had died and letters of administration had been\n\ngranted in respect of the estates of only two of them but the grant had not been extracted\n\nand in respect of the estates of five no application had been made for a grant of\n\nrepresentation and in the case of the remaining one a limited grant had been made to Syed\n\nAli as attorney but his appointment as attorney had been revoked.43. I come back now to Originating Summons\n\nNo 489 of 1993 for the appointment of Syed Ali and Mr Ng in place of the Public Trustee.\n\nBy the time the agency agreement was signed the application was not going to be\n\nsuccessful. It was not only opposed by the two beneficiaries who had not signed the\n\ndocument dated 12 August 1993. Eleven of those who had signed the document had supported\n\nthe application to appoint four of themselves as trustees in place of the Public Trustee\n\nin Originating Summons No 745 of 1994.44. There is no evidence that anything had\n\nbeen done to have legal personal representatives in place in respect of the eight deceased\n\nimmediate beneficiaries of Shaikh Ahmad. There is no evidence that anything had been done\n\nto identify the ultimate beneficiaries upon the death of the eight deceased immediate\n\nbeneficiaries. An inquiry may well be required to ascertain these later beneficiaries and\n\nthere may well be minority interests. There is no evidence that anything had been done to\n\nsatisfy the Public Trustee’s conditions. If Originating Summons No 489 of 1993 was\n\nproceeded with the Public Trustee would have taken the same position.45. On 14 August 1993 all the 11\n\nbeneficiaries who were the defendants in Suit No 1550 of 1994 wrote to the Public Trustee.\n\nThey referred to documents signed by them and another beneficiary for the appointment of\n\nSyed Ali and Mr Ng as trustees and said:\"We hereby certify that all\n\n  statements of PROXY / TRUSTEE APPOINTMENT, dated April 30, 1993 (the real date is February\n\n  8, 1993), therewith all the documents relating to such appointed, are CANCELLED and VOID;\n\n  commencing from Saturday, August 14, 1993. We also herewith dismiss and revoke, commencing\n\n  from August 14, 1993, all prior statements, one and others related to the aforesaid\n\n  private trusteeship.\"There were documents consenting to the\n\nappointment of Syed Ali and Mr Ng as trustees signed prior to 12 August 1993.\n\nNotwithstanding the difficulty with the language of the letter I think it is clear that\n\nall documents consenting to the appointment of Syed Ali and Mr Ng signed prior to 14\n\nAugust 1993 were \"cancelled\" and \"void\".46. The letter continued:\"After due consideration, eleven (11)\n\n  of us, the heirs of the deceased, REQUEST that anything dealing with the estate of the\n\n  deceased [SHAIK AHMAD], for the time being is still held by the PUBLIC TRUSTEE, NOT TO BE\n\n  assigned to other people (private trustee), prior to our new, clear, and affirmed\n\n  statement.\"Copies of the letter appear to have been\n\nsent to this court and to several persons including Syed Ali and Mr Ng.47. The application in Originating Summons\n\nNo 489 of 1993 was opposed. The Public Trustee would have raised the same concerns as were\n\nraised in a similar application filed later. It was an application that was doomed to\n\nfailure from the moment it was filed and certainly by 14 August 1993. It may or may not\n\nhave been withdrawn only \"between 3 November 1993 and 14 January 1994\" as Mr Lee\n\nsaid under cross-examination but what is relevant is that the court has not appointed\n\neither Syed Ali or Mr Ng to be a trustee or trustees together with or without any other\n\nperson and whether in Originating Summons No 489 of 1993 or in any other application. The\n\nfailure occurred before the breaches of the agency agreement by Beng Tiong and not in\n\nconsequence of any such breach.48. The document dated 12 August 1993 has\n\nattached to it a draft agreement for sale of the properties. The draft agreement contains\n\nthis term:\"The sale herein is conditional upon\n\n  the Trustees having obtained approval from the High Court of the Republic of Singapore to\n\n  the appointment of the Trustees as the legal personal representatives of the Estate\n\n  (hereinafter referred to as ‘the said Order of Court’).PROVIDED ALWAYS that the Trustees shall do\n\n  all in their means and powers to obtain the same and in the event that such approval are\n\n  not obtained then this Agreement shall be null and void and of no effect and each party\n\n  shall have no claim against the other. All monies paid to account of the sale herein shall\n\n  be refunded to the Purchaser herein free from interest.\"The \"Trustees\" are Syed Ali and\n\nMr Ng. Even if the agreement for sale had been \"secured\" it would have failed as\n\nit was bound to and it would have been \"null and void\". There appears to be a\n\nconfusion as the application to court is for the appointment of trustees and not legal\n\npersonal representatives but the result would have been the same in any case. Neither Syed\n\nAli nor Mr Ng would have acquired any right to sell the properties.49. The sale would have to be sanctioned\n\nby the court if the sellers are selling as legal personal representatives of Shaikh Ahmad\n\nwho died more than six years ago. If the sellers are selling as trustees upon trust for\n\nsale and one or more of the beneficiaries opposes the sale or is otherwise not competent\n\nto express his consent to it then an application to court would have to be made. In either\n\ncase evidence of the value of the properties at the date of the hearing would have to be\n\nadduced and I cannot see that an order can be obtained either to sanction the sale or to\n\nempower the trustees to sell the properties to Beng Tiong for $8.26m when Beng Tiong is\n\nwilling to pay that price and another $4.64m to Mr Lee to buy these properties.50. In my judgment Mr Lee has not suffered\n\nany loss or incurred any expense in consequence of any of the breaches of the agency\n\nagreement by Beng Tiong or any loss or expense in respect of which he is entitled to\n\ndamages.Quantum meruit51. Paragraph 12 of the statement of claim\n\nstates:\"Alternatively to paragraphs 9 and 10\n\n  herein, notwithstanding the work done and services performed by [Mr Lee] pursuant to the\n\n  Agent’s Works Term as particularized in paragraph 11 herein, [Beng Tiong] [has]\n\n  failed and refused to pay [Mr Lee] a reasonable sum or any sum at all. In the premises,\n\n  [Beng Tiong] [is] in breach of the Reasonable Sum Term.\"The \"Reasonable Sum Term\" is\n\nalleged in para 5. Paragraphs 9 and 10 contain allegations as to repudiatory breaches and\n\ntheir acceptance which have already been considered.52. Counsel included in the bundle of\n\nauthoritiesGold Coin Ltd v Tay Kim Wee[1986] SLR 68. I heard no submissions on it\n\nbut in that case thequantum meruitclaim was contractual in nature. See at p 72.\n\nLai Kew Chai J (delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal) referred toWay v\n\nLatilla[1973] 3 All ER 759 and cited this passage from the speech of Lord Atkin at p\n\n763:\"But, while there is, therefore, no\n\n  concluded contract as to the remuneration, it is plain that there existed between the\n\n  parties a contract of employment under which Mr Way was engaged to do work for Mr Latilla\n\n  in circumstances which clearly indicated that the work was not to be gratuitous. Mr Way,\n\n  therefore, is entitled to a reasonable remuneration on the implied contract to pay him\n\n  quantum meruit.\"Thequantum meruitclaim as pleaded\n\nis of a different nature. It is alleged to arise upon repudiatory breaches which have been\n\naccepted so that the agency agreement has been put at an end. SeeLuxor (Eastbourne) Ld\n\nv Cooper[1941] AC 108. Lord Wright said at p 141:\"Such a claim is in the nature of a\n\n  quasi-contractual claim. It is properly made in cases of contracts for work and labour and\n\n  the like, where the employer,who has got the benefit of part performance but before\n\n  full completion has repudiated the contract(emphasis added), may be sued either for\n\n  damages for breach or for restitution in respect of the value of the part performance\n\n  which he has received.\"The claim as pleaded is of this nature.53. What Beng Tiong contracted to get\n\nunder the agency agreement was an agreement for the purchase of the properties. It is\n\nplainly stated in para (b) of the recitals that Beng Tiongexpectedto enter into\n\nthe agreement. Even if it has repudiated the agency agreement and the repudiation has been\n\naccepted it has not in the circumstances of this case got any benefit from any partial\n\nperformance by Mr Lee. But as I have found Mr Lee affirmed the agency agreement and\n\nallowed time to expire without \"securing\" the agreement for sale and purchase of\n\nthe properties.54. Mr Lee has attempted to plead the\n\nclaim as a contractual claim founded upon an implied term. I see no ground for implying\n\nsuch a term. The agency agreement is not unworkable without it. There is nothing in the\n\nagency agreement pointing to any obligation to pay Mr Lee anything other than the agreed\n\nfee for securing the agreement for sale and purchase of the properties. In my judgment\n\nthere was no implied term as alleged and Beng Tiong was not in breach of any such term.",
        "Counterclaim": "55. The counterclaim is for the return of\n\nthe money advanced. It is not in dispute that Mr Lee has received from Beng Tiong a total\n\nof $360,000. Clause 3.8 clearly provides that Mr Lee was to secure the execution by the\n\nestate of the agreement for sale of the properties to Beng Tiong not later than 15 July\n\n1994 failing which the agency agreement was to be null and void and he should refund to\n\nBeng Tiong all moneys paid to him under the agency agreement. It is alleged that time was\n\nextended to 31 December 1994.56. Mr Lee’s defence is that by\n\nreason of the breach of the terms as to advances and non-interaction he was \"hindered\n\nand prevented\" from securing the execution of the agreement by the estate for sale of\n\nthe properties. I have found that the failure to secure the execution of the sale\n\nagreement was not caused by or consequent upon any such breach but by the failure of the\n\napplication to appoint Syed Ali and Mr Ng as trustees in place of the Public Trustee and\n\nother circumstances before any such breach.57. The defence also alleges that Beng\n\nTiong cannot take advantage of its own repudiatory breaches. These are the same breaches\n\nof the terms as to advances and non-interaction but as characterised it appears that a\n\ndistinct defence may have been intended. However I have found that the repudiation was not\n\naccepted and as noted above the breaches did not cause the failure to secure the execution\n\nof the sale agreement.58. In my judgment the defence fails and\n\nBeng Tiong is entitled to recover the money it has advanced to Mr Lee.59. For these reasons I dismissed Mr\n\nLee’s claim and gave judgment for Beng Tiong on its counterclaim.Lim Teong QweeJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
