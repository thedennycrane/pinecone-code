        "(i) Counterclaim, set-off or cross demand": "4 Rule 98(2) of the Bankruptcy Rules sets out the grounds for setting aside a\n\nstatutory demand and provides as follows:(2) The court shall set aside the statutory demand if --(a) the debtor appears to have a valid counterclaim, set-off or cross demand\n\n    which is equivalent to or exceeds the amount of the debt or debts specified in the statutory\n\n    demand;(b) the debt is disputed on grounds which appear to the court to be\n\n    substantial;(c) it appears that the creditor holds assets of the debtor or security in\n\n    respect of the debt claimed by the demand, and either rule 94 (5) has not been complied with, or\n\n    the court is satisfied that the value of the assets or security is equivalent to or exceeds the\n\n    full amount of the debt;(d) rule 94 has not been complied with; or(e) the court is satisfied, on other grounds, that the demand ought to be set\n\n    aside.5 Goh relied on ground (a) of rule 98(2) and claimed that he had a counterclaim,\n\nset-off or cross demand against the Bank which is equivalent to or exceeds the sum in the SD. In his\n\naffidavit, Goh deposed that on 15 September 2000, Grandlink, Goh and one Sim Chui Chu commenced Suit\n\nNo 740/2000 against the Bank for damages arising from the Banks breach of their duties as\n\nmortgagees in possession of 2 properties. The plaintiffs in that action alleged that the Bank had\n\nfailed to sell those properties at their true market value. Three months after the Bank had become\n\nmortgagees in possession of the properties, their solicitors wrote to Grandlinks solicitors to\n\nadvise that the Bank was considering an offer of $12.05 million. They gave Grandlink 6 days to\n\nrevert should they be able to procure any higher offer. The deadline was subsequently extended to 1\n\nSeptember 2000 but Grandlink was unable to notify the Bank of any better offer by that date. However\n\nthe following day, 2 September, Grandlinks solicitors faxed a letter to the Banks solicitors\n\nstating that they had procured an offer for $12.2 million. The Bank replied that they had already\n\nsold the properties to the purchaser who had offered the $12.05 million. Grandlink subsequently\n\nobtained a valuation report which stated that the properties were worth $17.2 million. In that\n\naction the plaintiffs ask for an injunction to restrain the Bank from completing the sale and\n\ndamages in the alternative. The plaintiffs in that action also applied for an interim injunction\n\nagainst the sale pending trial but it was refused on the ground that damages would be an adequate\n\nremedy. Although the amount of damages claimed is not specified in the statement of claim, Goh\n\ncontended that it would amount to $5.15 million (the difference between the valuation of $17.2\n\nmillion and the sale price of $12.05 million) and therefore he had a counterclaim, set-off or cross\n\ndemand that exceeded the amount specified in the SD.6 The following are the features of Gohs counterclaim, set-off or cross\n\ndemand:(a) It concerns 2 properties mortgaged to the Bank to secure the facilities\n\n  granted to Grandlink and has no connection with the SD which relates to the debt owed by\n\n  Galleries.(b) Goh does not deny that after deducting the valuation amount of the 13thproperty which remains unsold, he still owes the Bank in excess of $11.5 million. Even if he\n\n  succeeds in that action, he can only recover a maximum of $5.15 million which is less than half of\n\n  the sum he still owes.(c) It is not clear how he can claim damages on the basis of the valuation of\n\n  $17.2 million when the offer he procured, one day after the extended deadline, was only $12.2\n\n  million. If it is assessed at the lower value, the damages would only amount to $150,000.(c) Even the issue of liability is doubtful in the circumstances, given the law\n\n  on the duties of a mortgagee in possession.7 Although Gohs action in Suit No 740/2000 is clearly not a counterclaim in\n\nrelation to the debt the subject of the SD, I shall assume it to be a set-off or cross demand for\n\nthe purposes of my analysis. Rule 98(2)(a) provides that the court shall set aside the SD if the\n\ndebtor appears to have avalidcounterclaim, set-off or cross demand which exceeds the amount\n\nof the debts in the SD. The word \"valid\" is placed there for good reason. It requires the\n\ncourt to examine the alleged counterclaim, set-off or cross demand to see if the debtor has abona\n\nfideclaim against the creditor that, if successful, would enable him to pay the debt the\n\nsubject of the statutory demand. If all that rule 98(2)(a) requires were the mere existence of such\n\na claim, no matter how spurious, then it will be only too easy for a debtor to make such a claim in\n\norder to stave off bankruptcy proceedings. Indeed the Supreme Court Practice Directions (1997 Ed)\n\nNo.66 provides that where this ground is raised, the court will normally set aside a statutory\n\ndemand if satisfied that there is a genuine triable issue.In re A Debtor, No.991 of 1962[1963] 1 WLR 51 was a case decided under the English Bankruptcy Act, 1914, which provided that an\n\nact of bankruptcy would be committed if the debtor failed to satisfy a bankruptcy notice unless he\n\ncould:\" satisfy the court that he has a counterclaim set-off or cross-demand\n\n  which equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt \"The English Court of Appeal held that where the debtor claims that he has such a\n\ncounterclaim, set-off or cross demand, the court ought to determine whether the claim is genuine in\n\nthat there is a triable issue on the affidavits.8 In view of the foregoing, I find that the mere existence of the action in Suit\n\n740/2000 is not sufficient ground to set aside the SD. This is because even if Goh could succeed in\n\nthat action, the maximum amount he could have recovered would have been $5.15 million. As the Bank\n\nis being sued for breach of duty as mortgagee-in-possession such a judgment would be set-off against\n\nthe outstanding debt in that matter which is in excess of $11.5 million. There would therefore be\n\nnothing available to satisfy the debt in the SD. For these reasons, I would hold that that action\n\ndoes not constitute a valid counterclaim, set-off or cross demand under rule 98(2)(a).",
        "(ii) Non-compliance with rule 94(5)": "9 Gohs second ground is that the SD did not comply with rule 94(5) and\n\ntherefore it must be set aside in accordance with rule 98(2)(d). Rule 94(5) provides as follows:If the creditor holds any property of the debtor or any security for the debt,\n\n  there shall be specified in the demand(a) the full amount of the debt; and(b) the nature and value of the security or the assets.Goh stated that the Bank were holding 4 of his properties and that they should\n\nhave been specified in the SD. These 4 properties were among the 13 mortgaged to the Bank in respect\n\nof the loan facilities granted to Grandlink. At the time of the SD, they were not yet sold. The Bank\n\nadmitted that these properties were not specified in the SD but contended that they need not be\n\nspecified as they related to a different debt, i.e. the loan facilities granted to Grandlink, and\n\nnot the debt the subject of the SD, i.e. the banking facilities granted to Galleries.10 The question is whether rule 94(5) requires the Bank to specify property of\n\nthe debtor held by the Bank as security for another debt which is not the subject matter of the SD.\n\nNone of the parties could cite any authority dealing with this point and it is necessary to consider\n\nthe construction of the provision to determine its scope. Rule 94(5) by itself appears to be wide\n\nenough to include all property of the creditor held by the Bank, including any property held as\n\nsecurity in respect of another debt. This is because the term \"any property of the debtor\"\n\nis not qualified. And rule 98(2)(d) appears to make any non-compliance with rule 94 a ground for\n\nsetting aside the SD. However in the present case the 4 properties were mortgaged to the Bank as\n\nsecurity for an entirely separate loan to a different party. As the outstanding amount of that debt\n\nfar exceeds the value of those properties there would not be any surplus left after realisation of\n\nthose properties. Absolutely no purpose would be served by the inclusion of those properties in the\n\npresent case. It is therefore necessary to divine the objective of the requirement in rule 94(5).11 Rule 98(2)(c) provides some guidance. It prescribes a separate ground which\n\npertains to rule 94(5) specifically. This provides that the court shall set aside the SD if either\n\nrule 94(5) is not complied with, or the court is satisfied that the value of the assets or security\n\nis equivalent to or exceeds the full amount of the debt. From this it can be seen that the intent of\n\nrule 94(5) is to make a creditor declare that he holds any asset of the debtor or any security in\n\nrespect of the debt claimed so that the court may ascertain whether the creditor has sufficient\n\nsecurity or assets of the debtor that will satisfy the debt in full. However in the present case,\n\nthe assets held by the Bank are not available to satisfy the debt the subject of the SD. No purpose\n\nis served in requiring the Bank to specify the 4 properties as they were held as security in respect\n\nof a different debt and there is no surplus accruing to Goh.12 In the circumstances I would hold that in the present case, where a creditor\n\nholds property of the debtor as security for another debt which is not the subject matter of the SD\n\nand such security is insufficient to satisfy that other debt, the creditor is not required under\n\nrule 94(5) to specify such property in the SD.",
        "Conclusion": "13 In the event, I dismissed Gohs appeal in respect of his application to set\n\naside the SD. I should add that it appears to me that this action is one borne out of desperation\n\nrather than just cause. Goh is already heavily indebted in respect of the Grandlink facilities. Even\n\nif he succeeds in his action against the Bank for selling the properties at an undervalue and\n\nrecovers in full the amount he claims, he would still be indebted to the Bank for more than $6\n\nmillion. If he fails, it would balloon to $11.5 million. This is in addition to the $3.5 million in\n\nthe SD in question. No purpose whatsoever is achieved in setting aside the SD on account of the\n\nfailure to specify the properties held because it will be a simple matter for the Bank to serve\n\nanother SD containing the information. As for the claim against the Bank in relation to the alleged\n\nsale at an undervalue, the circumstances in which this action arose draw me inexorably to the\n\nconclusion that it was commenced in order to generate a ground for setting aside the SD rather than\n\non account of anybona fidebelief in the probability of success. While it is understandable\n\nthat Goh would clutch whatever straw he can, to prolong this matter further would only postpone the\n\ninevitable and incur greater cost to all concerned.",
