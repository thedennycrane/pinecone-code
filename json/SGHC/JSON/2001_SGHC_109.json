        "Whether the letter defamed F & N": "13.    At the outset, it ought to be\n\nreiterated that in an action for defamation, the plaintiff must establish that the\n\noffending words are defamatory of him. InGatley onLibel and Slander,9thed,the position is stated at p 161 as follows:To succeed in an action for defamation the plaintiff\n\n  must not only prove that the defendant published the words and that they are defamatory:\n\n  he must also identify himself as the person defamed.……. The question in all cases is whether the words\n\n  might be understood by reasonable people to refer to the plaintiff, subject to the\n\n  qualification that where the words are published to persons who have special knowledge the\n\n  issue will be decided by reference to what reasonable persons possessing that knowledge\n\n  would understand by them.14.    Mr Khwaja submitted that F\n\n& N had no cause of action against his clients because the letter did not put them in\n\na bad light. He explained in para 6 of his written submissions as follows:The thrust of the article is in respect of good\n\n  corporate governance and specifically the duties owed by the board of CMB Asia towards its\n\n  minority shareholders. The only reference to the 1stPlaintiffs is of a purely\n\n  factual nature: that CMB Asia is part of the restructuring of the F & N Group and that\n\n  the 1stPlaintiffs agreed to sell their shares to CCS at the offered price.\n\n  With regard to the latter, all the readers of the letter would know that and that the 1stPlaintiffs owed no duty to the shareholders of CMB Asia. Moreover, the 1st Plaintiffs were\n\n  free to sell their shares in CMB Asia to whomsoever, whenever and whatever price they\n\n  chose. Consequently there cannot be nor was there any defamatory imputation against the 1stPlaintiffs.15.    A perusal of the opening\n\ntwo sentences of the letter will show that the scope of the letter is wider than that\n\nsuggested by Mr Khwaja. The sentences are as follows:Hot on the heelsof Times Publishing, we have\n\n  another case of minority shareholders beingkept in the darkand not having\n\n  sufficient time to consider an offer for a company.Again, the company in question,\n\n  CMB Asia, is part of the restructuring of theFraser and Neave group.16.    Even if the thrust of the letter\n\nconcerned good governance, there is clearly an insinuation that F & N is involved in\n\nkeeping minority shareholders in the dark. It must not be overlooked that the CMB is first\n\nreferred to in the letter as a part of the F & N group. \"Kept in the dark\"\n\nhas negative connotations and suggests that minority shareholders have deliberately been\n\ndenied information to which they are entitled with respect to the proposed takeover. The\n\nterm \"again\" was obviously a carefully chosen word. Coming after the use of the\n\nwords \"hot on the heels\" and \"another case\", the reader must think\n\nthat there is a connection between the restructuring of the F & N group and the\n\nkeeping of minority shareholders in the two restructured companies in the dark.17.    The insinuation that F & N did\n\nsomething wrong continues in the following paragraph. It states that \"Fraser and\n\nNeave, with 34 per cent,readily assented\" to a price which was at a \"heavily\n\nwritten-down book valueandnot much above the company’s holding of cash in\n\nthe bank\". Read with the rest of the letter, the impression given is that F &\n\nN was so keen to have the deal done that it was willing to accept an inadequate price for\n\nits shares and at the expense of not giving minority shareholders enough time to consider\n\nthe offer or sufficient information to make an informed choice.18.    The following sentence from\n\nthe letter rings the death knell for the assertion that the letter does not have any\n\nreference to F & N:Once again, as in the case of Times Publishing … minority\n\n  shareholders risk fallingvictimto an \"inside job\".19.    In the above sentence, the\n\nreader is reminded once again of the Times Publishing case, which also involved F & N.\n\nAn allegation was made that in both cases, minority shareholders risked falling\n\n\"victim\" to an \"inside job\". The terms \"victim\" and\n\n\"inside job\" have negative connotations. The term \"inside job\" refers\n\nto a crime or wrongdoing against anyone by an affiliated person or someone working for or\n\ntrusted by the victim. As F & N was involved in both cases and there was an inside job\n\nin the two cases, the reader would think that F & N is party to the \"inside\n\njob\", and especially so since they \"readily\" assented to selling their\n\nshares at a very low price. The word \"victim\" certainly suggests that the\n\nminority shareholders have been wronged by F & N as well.20.    In view of the aforesaid, I\n\nhad no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that F & N had reason to feel aggrieved\n\nby the letter and that there was a case for determining the natural and ordinary meaning\n\nof the words in the letter.My construction of the letter21.    I accepted that there was an\n\ninsinuation in the letter that F & N acted improperly by agreeing with CCS and CMB to\n\nensure that minority shareholders had no real alternative but to accept an inadequate\n\nprice for their shares by ensuring that they were not given material information in\n\nrespect of the takeover and that they were not given enough time to consider the offer. In\n\nthat sense, they were \"forced\" to accept the offer. However, I was not satisfied\n\nthat an ordinary reader of theBusiness Timeswould, without more, have assumed\n\nthat there was a \"conspiracy\". I also found it unnecessary to add the words\n\n\"readily assenting in the sale of its shares to CCS at a heavily written down book\n\nvalue\" to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, as proposed by F & N.\n\nFinally, I modified the words \"suppressing material information with respect to the\n\ntakeover\" in the Assistant Registrar’s ruling. In view of the aforesaid, I ruled\n\nthat the allegedly defamatory words in the letter were meant and were understood to mean\n\nthat:[F & N] acted improperly by agreeing with Crown Cork & Seal\n\n  (\"CCS\") and CMB Asia Ltd in relation to the takeover of CMB Asia Ltd by CCS, to\n\n  force the minority shareholders to accept an inadequate price for their shares by:(a) ensuring that material information was not provided to the minority\n\n    shareholders in respect of the said take over; and/or(b) ensuring that there was insufficient time for the minority\n\n    shareholders to consider the offer.Sgd:TAN LEE MENGJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
