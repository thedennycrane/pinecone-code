The\n\nplaintiffs had sued the defendants for conversion of Central Bank of Nigeria promissory\n\nnotes (\"CBN notes\") which were placed as security with them by the first\n\nplaintiffs. The first plaintiffs were the original owners who subsequently assigned the\n\nnotes to the second plaintiffs. The defendants were found liable by the trial judge. The\n\ncourt held that the second plaintiffs were entitled to damages. The defendants’\n\ncounterclaim was dismissed and costs awarded against them to both plaintiffs. The judgment\n\nwas handed down on 17 October 2001 and the defendants’ appeal to the Court of Appeal\n\nwas subsequently dismissed. The conversion was committed on 19 March 2001.2.        The assistant registrar\n\nassessed damages at US$2,380,000.00 as well as US$839,407.82 (quarterly payments) due\n\nunder the CBN notes from the date of conversion to the date of assessment. The assessment\n\nwas adjudged on 17 July 2002.3.        Mr Tan submitted on appeal\n\nthat the assistant registrar was wrong in assessing the value of the CBN notes as at the\n\ndate of judgment instead of the value as at the date of conversion. As an ancillary\n\nargument, he submitted that there was no evidence upon which the assistant registrar would\n\narrive at the value of 34% of the face value of the notes. Secondly, Mr Tan submitted that\n\nthe assistant registrar was wrong to award the quarterly payments to the second\n\nplaintiffs.4.        A brief account of the CBN\n\nnotes is useful for a proper understanding of the nature of this appeal. The Nigerian\n\ngovernment issued the CBN notes which would expire in 2010 and, therefore, by that time\n\nthe notes would be valueless. In the meantime, quarterly payments (also referred to as\n\n‘instalment payments’) would be made by the Nigerian government to holders of\n\nthe notes. The quarterly payments are at attractive interest rates, and hence, the notes\n\nhave a secondary market.5.        CBN notes owned by the\n\nfirst plaintiffs had a face value of US$7m. These notes were assigned to the second\n\nplaintiffs. Meanwhile the first plaintiffs offered their CBN notes to the defendants as\n\nsecurity in respect of debts owing to the latter. The defendants sold the CBN notes on 19\n\nMarch 2001 at 32% of the face value (the act of conversion). The plaintiffs sued,\n\ncontending that the defendants had no right to dispose of the security because by that\n\ntime the plaintiffs’ liability to them had been discharged. The trial judge found in\n\nfavour of the plaintiffs.6.        Mr Tan’s main\n\nargument before me was that the date for ascertaining damages was the date of conversion\n\nand not the date of judgment, relying onMcGregor On Damages, 16thEd,\n\npage 912. It is clearly acknowledged in this authoritative text that the market value\n\nshould be ascertained as at the time of the conversion. Various authorities were cited as\n\nleaning one way or the other.Mercer v Jones(1825) 1 C&P 625; andSachs v\n\nMiklos[1948] 2 KB 23 in favour of a discretion to assess the market value at the date\n\nof judgment. Mr Sandrasegara referred me to the passage inHalsbury’s Laws of\n\nEngland618 as follows:-\"Time by reference to which value of goods assessed. Where\n\n    damages in conversion fall to be awarded according to the value of the goods converted,\n\n    the time by reference to which that value is to be assessed is that time which is most\n\n    appropriate to do justice between the parties and to compensate the claimant for the loss\n\n    sustained. The abolition of the tort of detinue does not inhibit the court from granting\n\n    in conversion a measure of damages traditionally granted in detinue, namely the value of\n\n    the goods at the date of judgment, rather than their value at the date of conversion. The\n\n    court’s ability to award damages according to value at the date of judgment may\n\n    either increase or reduce the sum awarded, accordingly to whether the market has risen or\n\n    fallen since the conversion.\"7.        Mr Sandrasegara also\n\nrelied onIBL Ltd v Coussens[1991] 2 AER 133. The principle which he wished me to\n\nconsider and apply is set out in the head note as follows:-\"Damages awarded under s 3 of the 1977 Act for conversion as an\n\n    alternative to the return of the goods were not to be arbitrarily assessed as at either\n\n    the date of the conversion or the date of judgment but ought to be such as fairly\n\n    compensated the owner for the loss of the goods, taking into account such matters as to\n\n    whether the owner would have kept the goods if they had not been converted, if not, when\n\n    he would have sold or replaced them, if they were kept, whether they had increased in\n\n    value, and whether the owner had suffered damage for loss of use.\"He submitted that the cost of the CBN notes had risen from 32% as at\n\nthe date of conversion, to 35% as at the date of judgment. He thus argued that the latter\n\nshould therefore be the measure of damages.8.        TheCoussenscase\n\nwas decided under the English Tort (Interference With Goods) Act, 1977. The Act did not,\n\nas Neill LJ, observed, give any guidance as to the date at which the goods is to be\n\nassessed. Hence, the Court of Appeal there reverted to the general principles at Common\n\nLaw. Neill LJ concurred with the following passage from the judgment of Brandon LJ inBrandeis\n\nGoldsmidt & Co v Western Transport Ltd[1981] QB 864, 870:\"Damages in tort are awarded by way of monetary compensation for\n\n    loss or losses which a plaintiff has actually sustained, and the measure of damages\n\n    awarded on this basis may vary infinitely according to the individual circumstances of any\n\n    particular case.\" [1991] 2 AER 133, 139.9.        The basic premise,\n\ntherefore, is to compensate the plaintiff as best as possible for the loss or damage he\n\nsuffers by reason of the conversion. The loss or damage ought, therefore, as far as\n\npossible to determine as at the date of the conversion because that would be the fairest\n\nand most accurate measure. Thus, the courts in England and the Court of Appeal here have\n\napplied the corollary principle that the plaintiff is obliged to purchase his damaged\n\ngoods in the market if there is a market. As Karthigesu JA held inThe Endurance[1991] 1 SLR 661, 663:-\"Where there is a market the charterers are expected to diminish\n\n    the damage by going into the market and buying the water-makers in the market, so as to\n\n    put themselves in the position they would have been if they had not suffered any wrong at\n\n    all. If there is no market for the goods converted, the measure of damages would be the\n\n    cost of replacement and the charterers must go to their suppliers to purchase the\n\n    water-makers so as to put themselves in the same position as they would have been if not\n\n    for the conversion. There was no evidence before the judge that there was no market for\n\n    the water-makers.\"10.        The last line of the\n\nabove passage clearly underlined the point that the burden of proving the absence of\n\nshowing that there was no market was on the plaintiff, and, that the plaintiff had to act\n\nquickly to diminish his loss. In the present case, the evidence appears to be to the\n\ncontrary, namely, that there was a market. The only reason, it appears, that the\n\nplaintiffs did not go to the market, was that, as Mr Sandrasegara submitted, they wanted\n\nto recover the CBN notes from the defendants. But, if there was a ready market, the\n\nplaintiffs ought to purchase their notes from the market and sue for the difference in\n\nprice if any.11.        I am in full agreement\n\nwith judicial statements in cases such asIBL Ltd v Coussensespousing the view\n\nthat the courts should retain the flexibility of assessing damages at the date of\n\njudgment. But that flexibility must be exercised as an exception to the rule; to provide\n\nrelief in circumstances where the normal rule proves deficient. For example, if the\n\nplaintiff is able to show that he had made reasonable efforts to purchase from the market\n\nbut, owing to unforeseen circumstances, was unable to buy within a reasonable time from\n\nthe date of conversion. There is no evidence in the present appeal before me that the\n\nnormal rule (that damages for conversion be assessed as at the date of conversion) should\n\nnot apply.12.        For the reasons above,\n\nthe appeal is allowed. The plaintiffs’ damages should be assessed as at the date of\n\nconversion at the rate of 32% of the face value of the notes; that being the known\n\ntransacted price for the said notes on that day. The plaintiffs would also be entitled to\n\nsuch quarterly payments but only as may be due at the date of the conversion.13.        The appellants’\n\nappeal against the order to pay the costs of Mr Horne was dismissed. In my view, the\n\nevidence of Mr Horne was necessary for the assessment. The main appeal before me was\n\nessentially on a very narrow issue, namely whether damages ought to be assessed as at the\n\ndate of conversion or the date of judgment. An offer was also made to have the evidence of\n\nMr Horne agreed but that was not accepted by the appellants.14.        Finally, I upheld the\n\naward of costs by the assistant registrar below, fixed at $10,000, in favour of the\n\nrespondents for the assessment of damages. The costs of the appeal before me was fixed at\n\n$5,000 in favour of the appellant for the main appeal; $500 in favour of the respondent in\n\nrespect of the costs of appeal against the award of costs for the attendance of Mr Horne\n\nat the assessment.Sgd:Choo Han TeckJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
