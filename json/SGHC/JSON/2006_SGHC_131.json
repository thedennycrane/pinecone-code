        "Whether the plaintiff is a moneylender": "17        This is the main issue. But before attempting to answer the question, a basic question must be addressed – was the plaintiff lending money? In a typical case of moneylending,A, a borrower gets a loan of money fromB, a lender.Amay receive the money in cash or he may receive a cheque for that amount, but it does not matter as that is readily convertible into cash. The purpose for the loan, say to pay a hospital bill, may be made known toB, , or it may not. Again, it does not matter if the purpose is disclosed or approved as money is undoubtedly lent in either event. V K Rajah J stated inCity Hardware(at [24]) that a loan need not be given directly to the borrower, and that it suffices that the borrower gives directions on the disbursement of the money. That must be so, for in the example I use, it cannot make a difference ifAhad requestedBto send a cheque directly to the hospital. 18        The illegal moneylending defence has been raised against a variety of underlying transactions in which one party offers financial assistance to another party. The lending of money is a common form of financial assistance, but it is by no means the only form of financial assistance, and not all forms of financial assistance involves the lending of money. 19        To cite two leading cases as examples, inLitchfield v Dreyfus[1906] 1 KB 584, Farwell J held that financing by taking and discounting bills is not moneylending, and inOlds Discount Co Ltd v John Playfair Ltd[1938] 3 All ER 275, Branson J held that the purchase of book debts is not moneylending. 20        There is a decision which is more directly relevant to the present case. This isNissho Iwai International (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kohinoor Impex Pte Ltd[1995] 3 SLR 268(“Nissho”). In this case, the plaintiff agreed with the first defendant to arrange for the plaintiff’s bankers to issue letters of credit and performance bonds for the first defendant to enable the first defendant to purchase timber and the first defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff a commission, interest and the bank charges and the debits made against the plaintiff’s accounts with its bankers for the letters of credit and performance bonds issued. 21        This is essentially the same arrangement between the present plaintiff and the first defendant. Some businessmen who do not have their own funds or banking facilities to pay for their purchases to rely on such arrangements to finance the purchases, and businessmen with ready facilities offer the service for a profit. 22        Is this moneylending? As far as I know, the authorities administering the Act have not prosecuted any such operators for any offence under the Act. InNissho, Lim Teong Qwee JC stated at 274, [18]: This is a practice well known to those concerned with the import and export trade and I think not a few importers who use the available letter of credit lines of banking facilities of their business associates from time to time would be surprised if they were told that they were borrowing money by doing that and that their business associates would require a licence under the Moneylenders Act … In my judgment there is no loan here at all … [Such] transactions are not loans in nature or in form. 23        I agree with his conclusion. Like the purchase of book debts and the discounting of bills, the provision of letters of credit facilities is distinct from moneylending. It is a form of financial assistance that one party offers to another, usually for a profit, but unless we take all forms of financial assistance for a profit as moneylending, the arrangement between the plaintiff and the first defendant is not moneylending because no money is lent. 24        Upon the finding that the plaintiff is not a moneylender, there is no strict necessity to determine the second preliminary issue. I will, however, deal with it just in case I am wrong that there was no moneylending.",
        "Whether the plaintiff is an unlicensed moneylender": "25        Not everyone who carries on the business of moneylending is a moneylender for the purpose of the Act. 26        “Moneylender” is defined in s 2 of the Act thus: “moneylender” includes every person whose business is that of moneylending or who carries on or advertises or announces himself or holds himself out in any way as carrying on that business whether or not that person also possesses or earns property or money derived from sources other than the lending of money and whether or not that person carries on the business as a principal or as an agent but does not include — (a)        any body corporate, incorporated or empowered by a special Act of Parliament or by any other Act to lend money in accordance with that Act; (b)        any society registered under the Cooperative Societies Act; (c)        any person bona fide carrying on the business of banking or insurance or bona fide carrying on any business not having for its primary object the lending of money in the course of which and for the purposes whereof he lends money; (d)        any pawnbroker licensed under the provisions of any written law in force in Singapore relating to the licensing of pawnbrokers; (e)        any finance company licensed under the Finance Companies Act; and (f)        any person licensed under the Securities and Futures Act 2001. 27        The Act assists the borrower on this issue. Section 3 provides that any person who lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be a moneylender. 28        As it was not disputed that the first defendant had to pay the plaintiff sums higher than the amounts of the letters of credit, the plaintiff comes within the presumption. 29        When a person comes within the presumption, he has to show that he is not in the business of moneylending in order to rebut the presumption. One way for that to be done is to show that loans were not offered to anyone who wants to borrow. This form of rebuttal is related to the thinking reflected in Farwell J’s judgment inLitchfield v Dreyfus(supra[19]), where he stated at 589: Speaking generally, a man who carries on a money-lending business is one who is ready and willing to lend to all and sundry, provided that they are from his point of view eligible. 30        The presumption may also be rebutted by showing that there is no system and continuity in the lending, as indicated inSubramaniam Dhanapakiam v Ghaanthimathi[1991] SLR 432, where Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) held at 434, [10]: The settled law is that what is prohibited by the Act was not moneylending but the business of moneylending. This is a question of fact. It is also settled law that the giving of a number of loans to friends does not constitute the business of moneylending, unless there is a system and continuity about the transactions. 31        While one can readily understand that someone who is prepared to lend to everyone is in the business of moneylending, one may ask whether that is a requisite element of the business of moneylending. A person may not be prepared to lend to everyone, and may be selective of his clients, and be content with lending on a commercial basis to a few or even only one regular borrower whom he trusts. This person is nevertheless carrying on moneylending as a business. 32        On the facts of this case, the plaintiff was dealing with the first defendant from mid 1998 to October 2000 at the earliest (the plaintiff’s case was that the transactions carried on till February 2002, but the defendants denied this). 33        The plaintiff pleaded in his reply that the transactions with the first defendant were business transactions. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief he stated that he issued invoices and maintained an accounting ledger. The invoices would be for the principal amounts of the letters of credit issued, the 1.5% commission and the bank commission. The interest would not be payable until the principal sum was paid, and the period and the applicable rate of the interest are ascertained. He repeated that the transactions were “pure business transactions where an agreed fee is charged for the risk and exposure I undertook with my bank to allow [the second defendant] to use my credit facilities for [his] business”. On the evidence there was system and continuity in the transactions. 34        However, not everyone who carries on the business of moneylending is a moneylender for the purposes of the Act. There are five classes which are expressly stated in the definition of “moneylender” to be excluded, the third of which has to be considered in this case: (c)        any person bona fide carrying on the business of banking or insurance or bona fide carrying on any business not having for its primary object the lending of money in the course of which and for the purposes whereof he lends money. 35        If loans were made under the arrangement, were they made in the course of and for the purpose of carrying on the plaintiff’s business? 36        The plaintiff had pleaded that Topbottom Impex was dealing primarily in the import and export of textiles, and that the first defendant was a trader and manufacturer of basic precious and non-ferrous metal. 37        As it was not the plaintiff’s case that he made the arrangement with the first defendant in the course of and for the purpose of Topbottom Impex’s business, that exception does not apply. 38        Consequently, if the arrangement constituted moneylending, the plaintiff was an unlicensed moneylender.",
        "Whether the defendants have a complete defence": "39        In the manner the issue was framed, there was no uncertainty over the third issue. If the plaintiff was a moneylender who did not hold a moneylending licence, then s 15 of the Act which provides that “[n]o contract for the repayment of money lent by an unlicensed moneylender shall be enforceable” must apply; and the defendants would have a defence. 40        However, as I have found that the plaintiff was not engaged in moneylending and was not an unlicensed moneylender, this issue must be answered in the negative."
