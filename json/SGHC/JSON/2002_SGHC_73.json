        "Legislative and Administrative Background": "8 The primary governing legislation is the Planning Act (\"the\n\nAct\") which seeks, as its long title states:\"… to provide for the planning and improvement of Singapore\n\n  and for the imposition of development charges on the development of land and for purposes\n\n  connected therewith.\"Rules have been made by the Minister pursuant to powers granted under s\n\n61 in relation to a wide range of matters but the only relevant one is the Planning (Use\n\nClasses) Rules which will be dealt with in detail below. I now set out the provisions of\n\nthe Act and rules, as well as the HDB administrative requirements, that are relevant to\n\nthe matter before me.Master Plan9 Section 6 of the Act defines the Master Plan as follows (hereafter\n\nall emphases have been added unless otherwise stated):\"The Master Plan means the Master Plan that was originally\n\n  submitted to and approved by the Governor in Council on 5th August 1958 under the\n\n  provisions of Part IV of the Singapore Improvement Ordinance (Cap. 259, 1955 Ed.) as\n\n  subsequently amended under the repealed Act or this Act, and includes theapproved mapsandwritten statement.\"The term \"approved map\" is not defined while \"written\n\nstatement\" is defined in s 2 as:\"… that part of the Master Plan which includes a summary of\n\n  the main proposals of the Master Plan with such descriptive matter as the competent\n\n  authority considers necessary to illustrate the proposals of the Master Plan or as the\n\n  Minister may, from time to time, direct for that purpose.\"10 The Government has published a document entitledMaster Plan\n\nWritten Statement 1998(\"the Written Statement\"). The parties agree that\n\nthis is the written statement under s 6 of the Act. I set out below relevant paragraphs of\n\nthe Written Statement:\"2.2 From the effective date (being the date of the\n\n  Minister’s approval) of the amendment to the Master Plan, all applications in respect\n\n  of land within the demarcated area to which the Amendment Plan applies … shall be\n\n  considered in accordance with the Amendment Plan and this Written Statement and not the\n\n  Master Plan prior to the effective date of the amendment. …3.1 The contents and provisions of the Amendment Plan and this Written\n\n  Statement are intended to guide and control the physical development of the demarcated\n\n  area. …4.0 The zoning and plot ratio parameters referred to in the Amendment\n\n  Plan prescribe the land use and development intensity permissible within the demarcated\n\n  area. …5.1 The zoning notations in the Amendment Plan reflect the permissible\n\n  predominant use of land within the demarcated area. …5.2The competent authority may consider and approve uses (other\n\n  than those permissible for the zoning) which are ancillary, related or compatible with the\n\n  permissible predominant use. The type and quantum of uses that may be regarded as\n\n  compatible with the predominant use shall be determined by the competent authority. The\n\n  type and quantum of all ancillary or related uses that may be allowed for the support or\n\n  management of the predominant use shall be determined by the competent authority having\n\n  regard to the nature and scale of the development.5.3 Land within an area indicated in the Amendment Plan as being\n\n  zoned for General Industry or Light Industry use but with an existing approved warehouse\n\n  development or a valid permission granted for a warehouse development shall, despite the\n\n  zoning depicted in the Amendment Plan, be deemed to be zoned for Warehouse use with a\n\n  maximum permissible intensity as that prescribed for the General Industry or Light\n\n  Industry zone, as the case may be. …5.5 The interpretations of zonings are given in Table 15.6 Within the zones indicated in the Amendment Plan, the competent\n\n  authority shall control developments in such a manner as to preserve or promote the\n\n  character of the area as indicated by the notations in the Amendment Plan and any\n\n  development control plans as may be published by the competent authority from time to\n\n  time.11 Table 1 of the Written Statement sets out 26 zones, the principal\n\nones being \"Residential\", \"Commercial\", \"Residential with\n\ncommercial at 1ststorey only\", \"Commercial & Residential\",\n\n\"Commercial\", \"Hotel\", \"Business Park\", \"Light\n\nIndustry\", \"General Industry\", \"Warehouse\",\n\n\"Residential/Institution\", \"Health & Medical Care\",\n\n\"Educational Institution\", \"Place of Worship\" and \"Civic &\n\nCommunity Institution\". There is a zone called \"White Site \" which is a\n\nsort of wild card in which two or more of the following uses, viz. commercial, hotel\n\nresidential or other compatible use, may be combined. The other categories relate to\n\npublic amenities, examples being \"Open Space\", \"Park & Garden\",\n\n\"Roads\", \"Utility\", etc.12 The zones relevant to the present suit are \"Warehouse\" and\n\n\"Light Industry\". Under the Warehouse zone, the uses are prescribed as follows:\"These are areas used or intended to be used mainly for the\n\n  storage of goods.\"And the following examples of developments are listed:\"1. General Warehouse2. Open Storage3. Central Distribution Centre.\"The last column of this entry contains the following remarks:\"The warehouse use quantum must not be less than 60% of the total\n\n  floor area. The type of warehouse that may be allowed is subject to control by the\n\n  competent authority and other relevant authorities. Not more than 40% of the total area\n\n  shall be used for other permitted ancillary, related or compatible uses.\"It can be seen that the permitted uses under the Warehouse zone relates\n\nto storage of materials. Up to 40% of the total area of land falling under this zone may\n\nbe used for ancillary, related or compatible uses. Examples would be offices or workshops\n\nancillary or related to the permitted uses.13 In the entry under the Light Industry zone, the uses are expressed\n\nas follows:\"These are areas used or intended to be used mainly for clean or\n\n  light industrial purposes.\"Examples of developments are given as follows:\"1. Assembly and repair of computer hardware and electronic\n\n  equipment2. Printing, publishing and allied industries3. Packing of dried foodstuff\"And the following paragraph is found in the remarks column:\"The industrial use quantum must not be less than 60% of the total\n\n  floor area. The type of industry that may be allowed is subject to control by the\n\n  competent authority and other relevant authorities. Not more than 40% of the total floor\n\n  area may be used for other permitted ancillary, related or compatible uses.\"Similarly up to 40% of the total area may be used for ancillary,\n\nrelated or compatible uses. The parties agree that this includes warehousing needs in\n\nrespect of the assembly, repair, printing or packing activities.Planning Permission14 The relevant operational provision of the Act is s 12(1). It\n\nprovides as follows:\"No person shall withoutplanning permissioncarry out anydevelopmentof any land …\"Section 3 contains the definition of \"development\". It is a\n\nrather complex definition, but one activity falling within its ambit is:\"… the making of any material change in theuseof any\n\n  building or land …\"However there is no useful definition of the term \"use\".\n\nSection 2 provides that the expression \"use\", in relation to land, does not\n\ninclude the use of land by the carrying out of any building or other operations on the\n\nland. This merely removes from the ambit of the term, activities pertaining to the\n\nconstruction of the building. The meaning of the term \"use\" in that provision\n\nwill have to be determined from its ordinary and natural meaning in the context of the\n\nAct.15 Section 12(1) therefore requires that planning permission be\n\nobtained before any person may make a material change in the use of any building or land.\n\nSection 13 makes provision for applications for such planning permission to be made to the\n\ncompetent authority. Section 5 provides that the competent authority shall be appointed by\n\nthe Minister by notification in theGazette. In GN No S 173/98, the Minister\n\nappointed the Chief Planner of the Urban Redevelopment Authority as the competent\n\nauthority.16 Section 14 sets out the considerations for the approval of an\n\napplication for planning permission. Section 14(1) contains the general criterion for\n\ndetermination of written applications (defined in s 2 to include planning permission) and\n\nstates as follows:\"14.-(1) Subject to subsection (2), in determining an application\n\n  forwritten permission, the competent authorityshall act in conformity with the\n\n  provisions of the Master Planand any Certified Interpretation Plan in so far as they\n\n  may be relevant.\"The Master Plan is defined to include the Written Statement, of which I\n\nhave set out the relevant contents above. What s 14(1) means is that a person who desires\n\nto make any material change in the use of any building or land will require planning\n\npermission from the competent authority. In determining such an application, the competent\n\nauthority is required to act in conformity with what is prescribed in the Written\n\nStatement. Therefore if the Master Plan provides that the building in question is zoned\n\nunder \"Warehouse\" then, as stated in the Written Statement, it must be used\n\nmainly for the storage of goods. However, pursuant to the statement in the remarks column\n\nof Table 1 of the Written Statement, the competent authority may permit up to 40% of the\n\ntotal area to be used for ancillary, related or compatible purposes.17 There is an exception to this in s 14(2). This subsection permits\n\nthe competent authority, with the Minister’s approval, to deviate from the\n\nrequirement in subsection (1) under certain circumstances. Section 14(2) provides as\n\nfollows:\"(2) Where the Minister approves, the competent authority need not\n\n  act in accordance with subsection (1) in any of the following circumstances:(a) the land to which the application relates (referred to in this\n\n    subsection as the relevant land) is or will be required for any public purpose or for the\n\n    provision of any utility services or infrastructural, social or transportation facility;(b) the relevant land, or its locality, is the subject of a planning,\n\n    transportation, conservation or preservation study being carried out by the competent\n\n    authority or any other public authority;(c) the provisions of the Master Plan in so far as it relates to the\n\n    relevant land, or its locality, is being reviewed by the competent authority;(d) a proposal to amend the provisions of the Master Plan in so far as\n\n    it relates to the relevant land, or its locality, has been submitted to the Minister for\n\n    approval under section 8; or(e) the competent authority is of the view that the development\n\n    proposed in the application is incongruent with the developments on land adjoining the\n\n    relevant land or other land in the locality.\"Section 14(3) provides that should any of the circumstances listed in\n\nsub-paragraphs (a) to (e) exist then he need not act in accordance with s 14(1) and may\n\ndetermine the application in the manner as the Minister may approve. It would follow that\n\notherwise, he must act in accordance with s 14(1).Planning (Use Classes) Rules18 The Planning (Use Classes) Rules (\"the Use Classes Rules\")\n\npromulgated on 9 January 1981 were revoked and replaced by the Planning (Use Classes)\n\nRules 2001 (No. S 371/2001) on 1 August 2001. At the material time, before the acceptance\n\nof the Option on 26 March 2001, the Use Classes Rules were in effect. The material rule is\n\nr 3(1) which provides as follows:\"Where a building or land has anexisting usefalling\n\n  within any class specified inthe Scheduleand is not subject to any restriction\n\n  imposed by the competent authority under section 10 of the Act, the use of such building\n\n  or land for any other purpose of the same class shall not be deemed for the purposes of\n\n  Part III of the Act to involve development of the land.\"Under r 2, \"existing use\" is defined as meaning:\"the use to which a building was put on 1st February 1960, or a\n\n  use approved under section 10 of the Act\"And the Schedule to the Use Classes Rules provides as follows:\"(a) Class I Use as a shop or a food-shop.(b) Class II Use as an office.(c) Class III Use as a light industrial building.(d) Class IV Use as a general industrial building.(e) Class V Use as a warehouse.(f) Class VI Use as a building for public worship.\"19 The effect of r 3 is best illustrated by an example and I take Class\n\nIII, \"Use as a light industrial building\". In the Written Statement, examples of\n\nuses under \"Light Industry\" zone include assembly of electronic equipment and\n\nprinting. Say a particular building has an existing use (either that to which it was put\n\non 1 February 1960 or a use approved under s 10 of the old Act) as a printing press. This\n\nbrings it within Class III. Pursuant to r 3(1), if the building were now used for assembly\n\nof electronic equipment it would not be deemed to involve development of the land because\n\nthe new use falls within the same class as the existing use, and which is a class\n\nspecified in the Schedule. Part III of the Act contains s 12. As such, this change from\n\nprinting press to assembly of electronic equipment is deemed not to involve development of\n\nland by operation of r 3(1) and would not require the planning permission specified in s\n\n12 of the Act.HDB requirements20 The Property is a leasehold granted by the HDB and one of the terms\n\nof the lease is that HDB approval is required for any assignment of the lease. The HDB\n\nIndustrial Properties Department issues a form for the assignment of the industrial leased\n\nland, into which category the Property falls. This form is entitled \"General\n\nGuidelines on Assignment of Industrial Leased Land\" and section (A) thereof lists the\n\nfollowing procedure:\"Assignment of theremaining term of the original leaseis\n\n  allowed subject to the following procedures, terms and conditions.A)Procedures:1) The proposed assignee is required to complete (i) Form A\n\n    – the Application for Assignment and (ii) Form 1A – Application Form for\n\n    Proposed Use of Industrial Premises (Clearance from Pollution Control Department (PCD)).2) The proposed assignee is to obtain clearance from the Pollution\n\n    Control Department (PCD), Ministry of the Environment, and the Urban Redevelopment\n\n    Authority (URA) on the proposed use at the following address: …3) To submit Form A – Application for Assignment to theINDUSTRIAL\n\n    PROPERTIES DEPARTMENTat the following address so to allow us to forward to the\n\n    Economic Development Board/ Land Office for their approval on the proposed assignment.\n\n    Please note that the HDB shall only proceed to evaluate the assignment application upon\n\n    the receipt of PCD’s and URA’s approvals on the proposed use by the assignee:…\"21 In Form 1A the applicant is required to provide details of the\n\npremises to be assigned. The first information asked for appears in the following manner:\"Type of Factory : Flatted/Standard/Terrace Workshop/Industrial\n\n  Land\"Presumably the applicant is required to delete the inapplicable\n\ndescriptions. Another item of information required falls under the rubric \"Proposed\n\nActivities\". The rest of the form provides for information on (a) the\n\napplicant’s particulars; (b) sub-tenancies; (c) nature of raw materials and chemicals\n\nto be stored and their control measures; (d) manufacturing processes; (e) sources of air\n\npollutants; (f) water consumption and effluent discharge; (g) industrial wastes, both\n\nsolid and toxic; and (h) sources of noise pollution.22 It would appear from these documents that HDB requires the proposed\n\nassignee of an industrial property first of all to obtain the clearance of the PCD and URA\n\nin relation to the proposed use of the property.",
        "Factual Background": "23 With the legislative and administrative background in mind, I turn\n\nto the facts of the matter before me. The Property is a 3-storey industrial building\n\nsituated at 8 Aljunied Avenue 3. The building was erected by Pico Art International Pte\n\nLtd (\"Pico\") in the early 1980s on Lot 6023 of Mukim 24 which PICO leased from\n\nthe HDB for a period of 30 years from 1 September 1983. The land is sited within an area\n\nzoned ‘Light Industry’ in the Master Plan. 1(ix) of the Special Covenants and\n\nConditions of the Lease states as follows:\"Not to use or to permit or suffer the said land or any building\n\n  thereon to be used otherwise than as a factory to provide a complete range of artistic\n\n  design, fabrication and assembly of signboards, advertisements and exhibition stands\n\n  subject to the approval of the Competent Authority appointed under Section 3 of the\n\n  Planning Act.\"The Defendant purchased the lease from Pico in 1989 having successfully\n\nobtained the requisite approvals in respect of that assignment. In late 2000 the Defendant\n\ndecided to sell the Property to ease its cash flow problems.24 The Plaintiff is the holding company of United Lifestyle Pte Ltd\n\n(\"UL\") and owns 75% of the share of United BMEC Pte Limited (\"BMEC\").\n\nThe Plaintiff is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hotel Plaza Limited, a public listed company\n\nand is related to United B&B Italia (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\"B&B\") and\n\nUnited Venture Furnishings Pte Ltd (\"Venture\"). UL is in the business of trading\n\nin used and new exercise equipment and BMEC is in the business of selling\n\nmedical/biomedical health products and equipment. B&B is in the business of selling\n\nimported Italian furniture and Venture is in the business of selling furniture and\n\ncontracting for built-in furniture and interior decoration work. In September 2000, the\n\nPlaintiff first considered the purchase of space for the use by UL, B&B and BMEC due\n\nto the expansion and growth of their businesses. Also, for operational efficiency and\n\nbetter control, it was deemed necessary to consolidate these spaces and operations under\n\none roof. The Plaintiff estimated that UL would need about 8,700 square feet of space for\n\nstorage of heavy equipment and for workshop and showroom purposes, B&B would need\n\nabout 8,000 square feet for storage of ready made imported furniture, and BMEC would need\n\nabout 6,000 square feet for storage, testing labs and offices. However to allow for future\n\nexpansion, the Plaintiff targeted the net area of the new property to be between 30,000\n\nand 50,000 square feet. On 6 October 2000, the Plaintiff contacted the Defendant’s\n\nestate agent, Colliers Jardine (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\"Colliers\"), who recommended\n\nthe Property for the Plaintiff’s consideration. Around 24 October 2000 Wey Kim Long\n\n(\"Wey\"), the Deputy President of the Plaintiff’s parent company Hotel Plaza\n\nLtd, went to view the Property with two of his staff. The following day, 25 October 2000,\n\nthe Plaintiff wrote to Colliers expressing interest in purchasing the Property at S$5.7\n\nmillion, subject to contract.25 On 27 October the Plaintiff received from the HDB Industrial\n\nProperties Department the form for the assignment of the Property. I have described above\n\nthe relevant contents of this form. On the same day, Colliers wrote to the Defendant to\n\nadvise the Plaintiff was keen to purchase the Property but this was subject to the\n\napproval of the Plaintiffs’ board of directors and due diligence checks. The\n\nparties’ representatives met on 2 November 2000 to discuss the sale. On 7 November\n\nthe Defendant's solicitors handed the first draft of the Option to the Plaintiff's\n\nsolicitors. The final version of the Option was settled on 9 March 2001. The\n\nDefendant’s representative signed it on 12 March and the Plaintiff’s\n\nrepresentative signed the acceptance on 26 March.26 The Plaintiff proceeded to make the requisite applications to the\n\nHDB in respect of the proposed assignment. On 12 April 2001 the Plaintiff’s\n\narchitects submitted to the HDB, on the Plaintiff’s behalf, plans for additions and\n\nalterations, and change of use in respect of the Property. Those plans indicated that\n\n60.88% of the gross floor area of the Property would be used as for warehousing with the\n\nremainder for ancillary office and showroom. The HDB replied on 18 April and stated as\n\nfollows in paragraph 2:\"2 We wish to highlight that the subject premises is designated\n\n  for light industrial use only. As such, we are not able to consider your application for\n\n  change of use from light industrial use to warehouse use.\"The Plaintiff attempted to get the HDB to change its mind about the\n\napplication. On 4 May 2001, the Plaintiff appealed to the HDB to re-consider approval\"to\n\nchange the designated use of the subject premise of light industrial to warehousing\n\nuse\". Form A – Application for Assignment was resubmitted. Under the item\n\n(1)(E) of that form, marked\"Proposed Trade Activities At The Purchased\n\nProperty\", the Plaintiff filled in\"WAREHOUSING (60/40% RULING)\".\n\nBy its letter dated 23 May 2002, the HDB rejected the appeal saying as follows at\n\nparagraph 2:\"2 We have considered your appeal carefully and regret to inform\n\n  that we are not able to accede to your request to change the use of the subject premises\n\n  to warehousing as the subject site is designated for light industrial use only. Thank\n\n  you.\"27 It is agreed between the parties that all reasonable efforts had\n\nbeen made by the Plaintiff in respect of this application and the only issue is whether\n\ncondition (ii) of term 7.1 envisages that the Plaintiff had the right to apply for change\n\nof use to \"warehousing\". It is the Defendant’s case that the Plaintiff is\n\nnot entitled under the terms of the Agreement to apply to change the use of the Property\n\nto one that fell outside one of the uses within which it was zoned under the Master Plan,\n\ni.e. \"Light Industry\". It is the Plaintiff’s case that it is within the\n\ncontemplation of the Option that it is entitled to apply for a change of use to\n\n\"warehousing\". The case turns entirely on this issue.",
        "Construction of term 7.1": "28 Condition (ii) of term 7.1 bears repeating. It goes as follows:\"The sale and purchase herein shall be subject to and conditional\n\n  upon theapproval in writing of the [HDB]…for(ii)the change of\n\n  the use by the Purchaser of the Property(in this Option called \"HDB’s\n\n  Approval\", which expression shall, unless the context otherwise requires, include the\n\n  approval of any other relevant government or competent authority).\"29 The term refers to \"approval of the HDB for the change of use\n\nby the purchaser\". This envisages that the purchaser would make an application to the\n\nHDB for change of the use of the Property. On the face of it, there are two possibilities\n\nto the scope of this application:(i) the Plaintiff is entitled to apply to change to any use without\n\n  restriction; or(ii) the Plaintiff is only entitled to apply to change to a restricted\n\n  category of uses.Counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Tan, concedes that the first\n\ninterpretation cannot be the correct one. No doubt he would have difficulty in supporting\n\nsuch a position. For this would mean that, if the Plaintiff had made an application to\n\nchange the use to one that is totally incongruent with the surrounding land, e.g.\n\nresidential use or hotel use, and which, clearly, would be disallowed by the competent\n\nauthority, the Plaintiff would be entitled to back out of the purchase without incurring\n\nany liability. Such an agreement would give the Plaintiffcarte blancheto change\n\nits mind about the purchase, so long as it makes an application within the time frame\n\nprescribed. InWickman Machine Tools Sales Ltd v L.G. Schuler AG[1974] A.C.235 at\n\n251, Lord Reid said as follows:\"The fact that a particular construction leads to a very\n\n  unreasonable result must be a relevant consideration. The more unreasonable the result,\n\n  the more unlikely it is that the parties can have intended it, and if they do intend it\n\n  the more necessary it is that they shall make their intention abundantly clear.\"30 Such an approach was taken by Warren Khoo J inSingapore Airlines\n\nLtd v Ahlmark[2000] 1 SLR 603. The plaintiff, Ahlmark, was employed by the defendant,\n\nSIA, as a pilot under a collective agreement. Clause 31 of the collective agreement\n\nprovided for two modes of termination of employment by SIA: (i) under clause 31(1),\n\nwithout cause and with by three months’ written notice or payment of three\n\nmonths’ salary in lieu of notice; and (ii) under clause 31(2), for misconduct or\n\ndereliction of duty after due inquiry. Ahlmark had also signed a separate training\n\nagreement with SIA under which he was given a course of training to enable him to qualify\n\nto fly a Boeing 747. In return he was to remain in the service of SIA for at least five\n\nyears. Clause 3(g) of the training agreement provided as follows:\"It is further agreed and declared that if the trainee in the sole\n\n  opinion of SIA: …(g) is dismissed or has his services terminated for any reason\n\n    whatsoever either during the course of training or during the period of five (5) years\n\n    referred to in clause 4 of this Agreement;then and in every such case the trainee shall be liable for himself,\n\n  his heirs, executors or assigns to pay SIA on demand as liquidated damages the amounts set\n\n  out in Schedule A to this Agreement.\"While travelling as a passenger on an SIA flight from Los Angeles to\n\nSingapore, Ahlmark became drunk and made a nuisance of himself. He was off-loaded in Tokyo\n\nand had to continue his flight the following day. SIA subsequently asked him to give a\n\nwritten explanation for his behaviour and he complied. About a week after that, SIA wrote\n\nto him to terminate his employment pursuant to clause 31(1), with immediate effect with\n\nthree months’ pay in lieu of notice. However SIA also invoked clause 3(g) of the\n\ntraining agreement and claimed liquidated damages on the ground that he had his services\n\nterminated within the five-year period.31 Warren Khoo J did not agree with the submission made by SIA that the\n\nliteral meaning of clause 3(g) should prevail. This was because it would lead to the\n\nabsurd result that SIA would be able to recover liquidated damages from Ahlmark by\n\nexercising its right of termination without cause. He reasoned as follows, at 19-22:\"19 … the clause must be construed in such a way as not to\n\n  give rise to an absurd result. It would be utterly absurd if the company could terminate\n\n  without cause and then claim to be entitled to liquidated damages from the trainee. The\n\n  redundancy example cited by plaintiff’s counsel is a good one. Interpreting the\n\n  clause in the broad way suggested is plainly against common sense and reason. It can be\n\n  assumed that no such absurd result was intended.20 The court should try to uphold an agreement rather than to undo it.\n\n  If a sensible meaning could be given to a provision so as to uphold it, the court should\n\n  try to do so. The learned editors of Chitty on Contracts (27th Ed) para 12-069 put the\n\n  position correctly thus:If the words used in an agreement are susceptible of two meanings, one\n\n    of which would validate the instrument or the particular clause in the instrument, and the\n\n    other render it void, ineffective or meaningless, the former sense is to be adopted. This\n\n    rule is often expressed in the phraseut res magis valeat cum pereat. Thus, if by a\n\n    particular construction the agreement would be rendered ineffectual and the apparent\n\n    object of the contract would be frustrated, but another construction, thoughper seless appropriate looking to the words only, would produce a different effect, the latter\n\n    interpretation is to be applied, if it can possibly be supported by anything in the\n\n    contract.\"32 Returning to the present case, the scope of term 7.1 must therefore\n\nbe that envisaged under the second possibility, i.e. that the Plaintiff is only entitled\n\nto apply to change to a restricted category of uses. The question then turns to the scope\n\nof this restricted category. There is a covenant in the lease restricting the use to which\n\nthe Property may be put. This is found in 1(ix) of the Special Covenants and Conditions\n\nto the Lease which states as follows:\"Not to use … the said land or any building thereon …\n\n  otherwise than as a factory to provide a complete range of artistic design, fabrication\n\n  and assembly of signboards, advertisements and exhibition stands subject to the approval\n\n  of the Competent Authority appointed under section 3 of the Planning Act;\"In addition, 1(vii) obliges the lessee to obtain the written consent\n\nof the HDB before it can transfer the Property to another party. Read together, it would\n\nmean that, unless the purchaser intends to use the Property in exactly the manner\n\nspecified in 1(ix) of the lease, he would need to obtain permission from the HDB for the\n\nnew use. In considering such an application, the HDB would no doubt have its internal\n\ncriteria. No evidence was adduced as to what these criteria are, but I do not understand\n\nany party to dispute that they exist. I can therefore safely infer their existence from\n\nthe fact that there is a requirement in the lease for permission to be obtained from the\n\nHDB for any change of use.33 On those premises, term 7.1 is clearly intended to cover this HDB\n\ninternal criteria and aimed at ensuring that the parties would not be in breach of the\n\nrestrictive covenants that ran with the Property. From the manner in which term 7.1 (set\n\nout in full in 1 above) is formulated, it exists for the benefit of both parties and not\n\njust the Plaintiff. Condition (i) relates to HDB approval for the sale and condition (ii)\n\nto HDB approval for change of use. Term 8.3 (reproduced in 1 above) provides that in the\n\nevent that there is no HDB approval, and this is not caused by the default of any party,\n\neither side has the opportunity to terminate the Agreement without liability. Hence it\n\nwould protect the vendor as much as the purchaser against any refusal on the part of the\n\nHDB to grant the approvals in question. There could not be an unconditional sale because\n\nof the restrictive covenants, and it was necessary for the parties to obtain the approval\n\nof the HDB before the sale could proceed.34 Mr Tan submits that it covers more than this HDB internal criteria.\n\nHe suggests that it must include uses that are related or ancillary to the zone which is\n\n\"light industry\". He submits that \"warehousing\" is sufficiently\n\nrelated or ancillary to \"light industry\". It is also related to the businesses\n\nand operations of the Plaintiff’s subsidiaries and related companies who were the\n\nintended occupiers of the Property. Therefore, he argues, the scope of term 7.1 should\n\ncover an application for change of use to \"warehousing\".35 There are two problems to this submission. The first is that if his\n\nposition is that it covers more than the HDB criteria, there is nothing in the Agreement\n\nthat suggests any limitation to its scope. The court cannot save the clause by imputing a\n\nlimit where there is none on the face of it. InSingapore Airlines Ltd v Ahlmark[2000] 1 SLR 603, Warren Khoo J was also faced with a similar submission and he said as\n\nfollows (at 21).\"21 It is suggested that in the general context of the clause as a\n\n  whole, the words ‘terminated for any reason whatsoever’ can be given a sensible\n\n  meaning if one thinks of it as referring to termination for a reason akin to dismissal or\n\n  for something that connotes a degree of fault or wrongful commission or omission on the\n\n  part of the trainee, rather than termination for the convenience or at the will of the\n\n  company. I must say it is an attractive suggestion in that it would help to save the\n\n  clause. However, although I was attracted to the idea right up to the last minute in the\n\n  writing of this judgment, I think I must resist it. The suggestion itself shows how\n\n  uncertain and ambiguous the phrase is. To accept the suggestion is to give validity to a\n\n  contractual provision which should in all conscience be struck down as void for\n\n  uncertainty. …\"36 Secondly, as the following analysis would show, any application to\n\nthe competent authority for change of use to \"warehousing\" was bound to fail. I\n\nhave set out the relevant provisions of the Planning Act above. If the Defendant were to\n\nuse the Property as a warehouse it would constitute a material change in its use as it is\n\ncurrently used for special industry and light industry with ancillary office. The Property\n\nis zoned \"light industry\" and in Table 1 of the Written Statement,\n\n\"warehousing\" is not one of the uses. Such a change would constitute development\n\nunder s 3 of the Act and require planning permission pursuant to s 12(1). Under s 14(1),\n\nin considering an application for planning permission, the competent authority must act in\n\nconformity with the provisions of the Master Plan (which includes the Written Statement)\n\nexcept under the circumstances listed in s 14(2). None of the five circumstances listed in\n\ns 14(2) is germane to this action. Therefore the competent authority would be bound by law\n\nto reject an application for change of use of the Property to \"warehousing\".37 Mr Tan submits that this cannot be the construction in view of the\n\nPlanning (Use Classes) Rules 1981. Those rules render it unnecessary for planning\n\npermission to be obtained from the competent authority in respect of the Property where\n\nthe proposed change is to a use within Class III: Use as a light industrial building.\n\nTherefore, Mr Tan argues, there is no question of applying to the competent authority if\n\nthe new use is within Class III as the construction requires. As this renders term 7.1\n\notiose, this cannot be the correct construction. The response to that submission is really\n\nquite simple: the approval in term 7.1 is to be obtained from the HDB and not the\n\ncompetent authority. Indeed, the existence of the Use Classes Rules could also strengthen\n\nthe Defendant’s position as it highlights the need for approval from the HDB for\n\nchange of use notwithstanding that no planning permission may be needed from the competent\n\nauthority.",
        "Conclusion": "38 The matter basically turns on the intention of the parties when they\n\nentered into the Agreement as to the meaning of term 7.1. As Lord Wilberforce said inReardon\n\nSmith Line Ltd v Yngvar Hansen-Tangen[1976] 1 WLR 989 at p 996:\"… When one speaks of the intention of the parties to the\n\n  contract, one is speaking objectively - the parties cannot themselves give direct evidence\n\n  of what their intention was - and what must be ascertained is what is to be taken as the\n\n  intention which reasonable people would have had if placed in the situation of the\n\n  parties. Similarly when one is speaking of aim, or object, or commercial purpose, one is\n\n  speaking objectively of what reasonable persons would have in mind in the situation of the\n\n  parties. …… what the court must do must be to place itself in thought in the\n\n  same factual matrix as that in which the parties were. All of these opinions seem to me\n\n  implicitly to recognise that, in the search for the relevant background, there may be\n\n  facts which form part of the circumstances in which the parties contract in which one, or\n\n  both, may take no particular interest, their minds being addressed to or concentrated on\n\n  other facts so that if asked they would assert that they did not have these facts in the\n\n  forefront of their mind, but that will not prevent those facts from forming part of an\n\n  objective setting in which the contract is to be construed. …\"39 From the context of the Agreement, including the genesis and\n\ncommercial purpose of the transaction as well as the legislative and administrative\n\nbackground, I would hold that term 7.1 relates to HDB approval in relation to its internal\n\ncriteria. It was not envisaged by the parties that the Agreement would be conditional upon\n\nthe Plaintiff obtaining planning permission from the competent authority for change to a\n\nuse falling outside what it is zoned in the Master Plan, whether to warehousing or any\n\nother use. I should add that as such an application is a major matter, if the parties had\n\nintended the sale to be conditional upon planning permission being obtained under the\n\nPlanning Act, their solicitors would have drafted the Agreement on much clearer terms.40 The Plaintiff’s action is therefore dismissed. The Defendant is\n\nentitled to the deposit, amounting to $537,660, that has been paid into court and there\n\nshall be an order for payment out of this sum to the Defendant's solicitors. There shall\n\nbe an order for the Plaintiff to pay the Defendant’s costs on a standard basis.Sgd:LEE SEIU KINJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
