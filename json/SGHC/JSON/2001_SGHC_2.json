        "[Emphasis added]": "18. The above letter was accompanied by a detailed site plan, containing\n\n    technical specifications. Notably, this was the first time that EMS forwarded any plans to TF\n\n    which even represented engineering plans concerning earthworks. As mentioned earlier, the\n\n    original contractual documents certainly did not contain any engineering drawings on earthworks\n\n    which one would normally expect to accompany contracts calling for land-filling. EMSs second\n\n    witness, Mr Ling Lee Teck (Ling), whom I found to be a credible and reliable expert witness,\n\n    testified that a land-filling operation, being a potentially complex project, would require\n\n    proper engineering drawings on earthworks, with detailed specifications as to performance\n\n    standards, as well as technical data, such as the angles of the terrain and slopes before and\n\n    after the land-filling, the gradient, and the final platform levels to be achieved. In my\n\n    opinion, the absence of such drawings prior to 29 September 1995 supported the plaintiffs' case\n\n    that the contract had never called for any land-filling activity.19. It was also significant that under the Urban Redevelopment Authority\n\n    planning guidelines, land-filling operations involving more than 2,000 sq.m of land (as was the\n\n    situation in the present case) require a special planning permission. In the present case,\n\n    neither EMS nor TF had applied for such a permit in relation to the site at any point in time.\n\n    The requirement of a special permit from the relevant authorities was something which TF should\n\n    have been aware of. Tan himself admitted in cross-examination that he had carried out\n\n    land-filling projects before, and was aware that a permit was required in such instances. EMS\n\n    claimed that they had not even been aware at the material time that TFs activities amounted\n\n    to land-filling. It was only when their representatives met with officers from the HDB\n\n    some time in November 1995 that they were informed of this. The absence of the requisite permit\n\n    reinforced the plaintiffs' case.20. Apart from the significant absence of technical specifications,\n\n    engineering drawings or plans and planning permit, there had also been no discussion between the\n\n    parties as to the contractual price due to TF for land-filling works. The breakdown of TFs\n\n    tender contract price in relation to Hume Heights Estate simply stated:1 Clearance of trees/ shrubs/saplings/vegetation etc.: $20,0002 Repairs to boundary fencing: NIL3 Other works which are incidental to the foregoing or are contingently\n\n            necessary for the completion of the project: NILTotal: $20,000The above quotation was prepared by TF themselves. It was not their case that\n\n    there was any subsequent oral agreement between the parties as to the contractual price due for\n\n    the land-filling operation. Although the failure to state the contractual price was not a bar to\n\n    the formation of a contract, I found that in the present case, this fact was indicative that\n\n    there was no agreement between the parties to begin with.21. It was also pertinent that despite the claims of TF that they had\n\n    received verbal instructions from EMS, specifically, from Lee Hak Jin in April 1995 and from\n\n    Ganesan in June 1995, to carry out the land-filling operation, they had not mentioned those\n\n    verbal instructions in any of their correspondences to EMS before September 1995. This was\n\n    despite the fact that EMS had sent many letters to TF stating that they had never requested for\n\n    land-filling to be carried out. The first mention of such 'verbal instructions' was made in a\n\n    letter from TF to EMS dated 19 September 1995. This rather lengthy letter addressed several\n\n    issues and objections which had been raised in EMSs earlier letters. In particular, TF stated\n\n    that their labourers, machine operators, sub-contractors and site foremen had been instructed by\n\n    Ganesan to carry on with the land-filling operation at Hume Heights. They also stated:Please appreciate that it is inequitable for you now to insist that we\n\n      remove the earth,particularly when we have already acted upon the approval/ representation\n\n      given to us to fill the area.If indeed, there was objection to the earth filling in this area, then the\n\n      objection from you should have been forthcoming immediately after our filling work at the site\n\n      and letter of 14/6/94. Yet, your first letter of 30/6/95 merely mentioned that we reduce/grade\n\n      the level of the earth fill..You will agree that provision of levels must be a matter within your\n\n      purview. Yet, at no time were levels given to us.Since the levels were for you to decide and you were fully aware that earth\n\n      filling works were in progress, we merely continued with the earth filing until you decided\n\n      when the earth filling was sufficient.Further, your\n\n      representatives, Mr Ganesan, has visited and inspected the site everyday. There was no mention\n\n      of any overfilling or any discrepancy to the works at all times despite he did the site\n\n      inspections everyday.In the case of Hume Heights Estate, we carried out earth filling works from\n\n      1/6/95 to 30/6/95 for one whole month. It was only on 30/6/95 that we received your first\n\n      letter of 30/6/95, which incidentally did not require us to remove any alleged \"excessive\n\n      earth\".If indeed there was excessive earth, we must passed that limit level\n\n      sometime between 1/6/95 and 30/6/95. Yet, we did not receive any instructions from you until\n\n      30/6/95. By this time, we were already at the stage with the final levels as they are now.[Emphasis added]This letter was one in a series of letters written by TF, all dated 19\n\n      September 1995 but which were sent out only much later; this was admitted by TF. In fact, EMS\n\n      only received the above letter on 17 October 1995. When cross-examined as to the discrepancies\n\n      in the date, Tans only explanation was that he was very busy at the relevant time and had\n\n      no time to fax the letter to EMS. I did not find this to be an adequate explanation at all.\n\n      Having expended much time meeting up with his consultant Oh Joo Huat (Oh) and having made the\n\n      effort to draft such lengthy letters to EMS, it was illogical that Tan did not bother to take\n\n      a little more time to fax out these letters. The natural inference to be drawn was, that the\n\n      letter was not drafted on the date stated but its contents might have been formulated by TF\n\n      retrospectively, in an effort to refute EMSs assertions on the record. For this reason, I\n\n      found this particular piece of documentary evidence to be suspect and of little probative\n\n      value.22. The evidence of Tans consultant Oh, did not go very far in helping\n\n      TFs case. Oh, who was TFs second witness, testified that he had helped Tan to draft\n\n      letters to EMS from around August 1995, as Tans command of English was poor. Oh said that\n\n      the letters dated 19 September 1995 were probably drafted in September, but he could not\n\n      confirm this absolutely. Nor could he say with certainty that the letters were not drafted in\n\n      October instead. On the whole, Ohs testimony failed to add to the evidence already before\n\n      the court. When asked for his opinion on the scope of the contract, Oh said that it probably\n\n      called for land-filling, but he could not substantiate this statement with any concrete\n\n      reasoning. In fact, he conceded that the contractual documents did not indicate the precise\n\n      levels to be achieved by the land-filling operation, nor were there any drawings which could\n\n      indicate to him how much earthworks was called for.23. Having taken all the relevant evidence into account, I find on a\n\n      balance of probabilities, that EMS and TF had never contracted, either in written terms or\n\n      verbally, for the latter to carry out land-filling at Hume Heights. Those activities were\n\n      unsolicited and unauthorised, and probably resulted from either miscommunication within TFs\n\n      own ranks or (more likely), from Tan's own interpretation of the contract between the parties.\n\n      He had revealed under cross-examination (N/E111) that he had obtained the earth (removed from\n\n      basement and bored piling) for the land fill, from a site in Bukit Batok, for which he charged\n\n      the supplier $30 per lorry load. That would explain the unsolicited and 'complimentary' land\n\n      fill of 1,000-2,000 lorry loads done on site no. 2 by TF. The more excavated construction\n\n      material (which was what TF provided to EMS despite Tan's denial) that the defendants dumped\n\n      on Hume Heights, the more Tan was paid. Indeed, he admitted (when cross-examined at N/E 112),\n\n      that he received around $100,000 from the supplier.Use of unacceptable earthwork materials24. The second issue for my determination was whether TF had used soil of\n\n      unacceptable quality in their earthworks, and had also dumped the same on the Hume Heights\n\n      site without authorisation. To support their case, EMS adduced the reports of two companies,\n\n      LT Ling Consulting Engineers (LTL) and Geotechnique Pte Ltd (GT), whom they had engaged to\n\n      carry out investigations and soil tests at the Hume Heights site.25. GT was engaged by EMS in or around November 1995, for the purposes of\n\n      conducting soil tests on the soil on the Hume Heights site. According to expert witness Lim\n\n      Beng Tiat (Lim), soil samples taken randomly from the Hume Heights Estate site contained an\n\n      assortment of impurities such as rock fragments, decomposed wood, hardened cement mortars,\n\n      decayed roots and plastic. In addition, all the soil samples taken from the site were tested\n\n      and found to be in a loose state and were not properly compacted.26. Counsel for TF sought to cast doubt on GTs reports by suggesting,\n\n      first, that there could have been some tampering or manipulation of the tests to yield results\n\n      in favour of EMSs case. Next, he submitted that the fact that GT had not acted\n\n      independently in collecting the samples, but had merely followed the directions and plans\n\n      supplied by EMS, meant that the results of the tests were not completely reliable. I was not\n\n      convinced by these submissions. There was nothing to indicate that GT had not acted\n\n      independently in gathering the soil samples, or in conducting the laboratory tests on those\n\n      samples. The samples had been gathered randomly from the site. The plans and instructions\n\n      supplied by EMS merely indicated the general locations where the land-filling activities had\n\n      taken place. The soil tests carried out by GT were, by all accounts, standard and normal soil\n\n      tests. There was no evidence to indicate that anything was amiss or irregular in the conduct\n\n      of these tests. TFs counsel also suggested that GTs tests were not reliable as Lim had\n\n      not been personally present at the time the soil samples were gathered from the Hume Heights\n\n      site, and no photographs of the ground surface had been taken during the tests. Again, I was\n\n      not convinced. There was no evidence to support the suggestion that GTs field employees had\n\n      erred in any way whilst collecting the soil samples. The fact that Lim was himself absent from\n\n      the site at the relevant time was not enough on its own, to convince me that the test results\n\n      were unreliable. Since the tests carried out were in relation to the quality of the soil, I do\n\n      not find the absence of photographs of the surface terrain to be a crucial factor. On the\n\n      whole, I find Lim to be a consistent, independent and reliable witness. There is no reason to\n\n      doubt the reliability or independence of the reports made by GT.27. Detailed analysis of the soil at the Hume Heights site was also carried\n\n      out by LTL, who were engaged by EMS in or around October 1995. Three (3) reports made by LTL\n\n      were adduced as evidence in the trial. LTLs first report, dated 26 February 1996, concerned\n\n      the stability of the slopes on the Hume Heights site. This report concluded that the slopes\n\n      were safe and stable, since tests based on the slip-circle method, showed a safety\n\n      factor of 3.0, which was over and above the minimum acceptable slope safety factor of 2.0. LTLs\n\n      second report, dated 29 February 1996, contained results from tests of four (4) factors\n\n      affecting the quality of the soil, being: slope stability; the liquid limit and plasticity of\n\n      the soil; the requirement of clean soil; and soil bearing capacity. The tests were based on\n\n      the basic standards laid down by the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research\n\n      (SISIR) and the Public Works Department (PWD). In making their second report, LTL also took\n\n      into account GTs reports. LTLs second report stated:In Singapore, the standard and quality of backfill earthwork materials\n\n        (soil) and workmanship at site must meet and satisfy all the following criteria, which are\n\n        based on in-situ soil tests data and related engineering calculations:(a) Slope stability  safety factor must be greater than 2.00;(b) Soil with low water retention  liquid limit (LL) and plasticity\n\n        index (PL) of backfill earth work materials (soil) must not exceed 70 and 30 respectively;(c) Clean soil  backfill earthwork materials (\"soil\") must\n\n        be free from impurities such as construction waste and debris, material from swamps, peat,\n\n        logs, stumps and perishable material, material susceptible to spontaneous combustion. The\n\n        soil must be free from toxic material;(d) Soil bearing capacity  the safe soil bearing capacity calculated\n\n        based on appropriate method must not be less than 100 KN/M2.The report concluded that the soil used by TF at the Hume Heights site\n\n      failed two (2) out of the four (4) tests: the minimum standard set for slope stability was\n\n      met; the liquid limit and plasticity index for soil samples collected at the site was also\n\n      within acceptable limits; however, the soil contained various impurities, and did not qualify\n\n      as clean soil, nor did it pass the minimum standard set for safe soil bearing capacity,\n\n      which was 100 KN/M2.28. Ling from LTL, testified in the capacity of an expert for EMS. With\n\n      regards to the 'clean soil' factor, Ling testified that 'clean soil' was soil which was 'free\n\n      from impurities such as construction waste and debris, material from swamps, peat, logs,\n\n      stumps and perishable material, and free from toxic material.' Based on LTLs second report,\n\n      Ling testified that all the soil samples collected by LTL from Hume Heights contained an\n\n      assortment of impurities such as rock fragments, decomposed wood, hardened cement motors,\n\n      decayed roots and plastic. In relation to soil bearing capacity, LTLs second report stated\n\n      that the guidelines set by PWD considered a soil bearing capacity of not less than 100 KN/M2\n\n      as reasonably strong soil for supporting economical and safe footing foundation. Usually, a\n\n      well compacted backfill earth work materials would easily achieve safe soil bearing capacity\n\n      of more than 100 KN/M2. Based on the second report, Ling testified that all the soil samples\n\n      from the Hume Heights site had been found to be in a loose state and were not properly\n\n      compacted. Moreover, all the soil samples had failed to achieve acceptable soil bearing\n\n      capacity of 100 KN/M2. In the event, the minimum safety standard set by PWD for soil bearing\n\n      capacity had not been reached. The report also cautioned that the loose state of the soil\n\n      would lead to undesirable settlement in future, and there was a high possibility that soil\n\n      erosion and landslides would occur. Thus, EMS were strongly advised to undertake the turfing\n\n      of the sites in order to prevent soil erosion and landslides.29. LTLs third and final report was dated 12 April 1996. That report,\n\n      which was based primarily on GTs test results, stated:Based on the Report on the soil investigation carried out by M/s\n\n        Geotechnique Pte Ltd, the quality of the earthwork materials used to fill the above site at\n\n        Hume Heights was within the industrial acceptable limit.These backfill earthwork material used can be classified and considered\n\n        as the suitable fill material because the liquid limit of the above soil did not exceed 70\n\n        and/ or plasticity index did not exceed 35.The soil bearing capacity of the above backfill earthwork material was\n\n        estimated to be in the region of slightly below 100 KN/M2 which was much greater than the\n\n        industrial acceptable minimum allowable soil bearing capacity of 50 KN/M2.There was no \"unsuitable material\" such as material from swamps\n\n        and peat used as backfill earthwork material.Although small traces of metal were detected in soil samples, there was\n\n        no toxic material present in the backfill earthwork materialThere were small amount of impurity such as decomposed wood present in\n\n        the backfill earthwork material which is unacceptable. We recommend that these undesirable\n\n        material must be removed whenever possible.",
        "We strongly recommend that all the exposed earth in the above sites to be\n\n        covered with turf to prevent soil erosion": "Our report on the slope stability analysis for works at Hume Heights\n\n        Estate dated 26 February 1996 showed that the summary for analysis of the stability of\n\n        slopes based on slip circle method have safety factor against slip, F of at least greater\n\n        than 3.0 even for most critical condition. The acceptable factor of safety of slope\n\n        stability for building project is usually taken as 2.Therefore in my professional opinion, the said slopes at Hume Heights\n\n        Sites are safe and stable.\"30. Cross-examined on the third report, Ling maintained that this report\n\n      was consistent with LTLs previous two reports in all material aspects. He explained that\n\n      when the third report stated that the soil was 'within the industrial acceptable limit', that\n\n      was strictly with reference to the liquid limit and plasticity of the soil only. The quality\n\n      of the soil was still considered 'unacceptable' in that it failed the standard set for 'clean\n\n      soil', as the samples contained unacceptable and undesirable impurities such as decomposed\n\n      wood. In relation to the soil bearing capacity factor, Ling conceded that the acceptable\n\n      minimum industrial standard was 50 KN/M2, and not 100 KN/M2, as stated previously in the\n\n      second report. However, he maintained that the soil samples taken from the Hume Heights site\n\n      had still tested below the minimum standard. He explained that when the third report estimated\n\n      the soil bearing capacity to be 'slightly less than 100 KN/M2', the reference was not to the\n\n      immediate soil bearing capacity of the soil found on the Hume Heights site in 1995 or 1996.\n\n      Instead, that referred to the long term bearing capacity of the soil, which would be achieved\n\n      after some 50 years when the land settled naturally.31. Ling emphasised that his conclusion in the third report on the soil\n\n      bearing capacity factor was only a theoretical estimation, based on soil test results and long\n\n      term analysis. Such theoretical estimation did not include the compaction factor. 'Soil\n\n      bearing capacity' was the soils capacity as a material to carry a load directly placed on\n\n      it vertically, and the more compact the soil in question was, the higher its bearing capacity.\n\n      If the material was sandy or not well-compacted, the bearing capacity would be poor or low. In\n\n      the long term, however, certain materials like sand, could achieve a maximum stability. In\n\n      reply to a query from counsel for TF of what the actual soil bearing capacity of the soil was\n\n      in 1995, Ling replied that the test result was Value 3, which meant only 30 KN/M2. This\n\n      was well below the acceptable minimum industrial standard of 50 KN/M2.32. Counsel for TF sought to convince me that Ling was a biased and\n\n      unreliable witness who had tailored the LTL reports and his evidence, to support EMSs case;\n\n      I find no merit in these submissions. Indeed, having observed his demeanour and having heard\n\n      his testimony in the witness box, I consider Ling to be a reliable and consistent witness, who\n\n      was unswerving in his testimony despite being subjected to rigorous cross-examination. On the\n\n      whole, the language, tone and conclusions of his reports were fair and objective. Moreover, he\n\n      was an independent witness giving his expert opinion with no motive to lie. His testimony was\n\n      consistent with the reports that LTL had made back in 1995. The explanations that he provided\n\n      in relation to the conclusions in LTLs third report were credible and logical.33. TFs expert witness, Chong Kee Sen (Chong) testified that LTL and GTs\n\n      method of testing the soil for impurities, namely, the 'bore hole sampling' method, was not\n\n      adequate, and that results yielded by using such a method were inaccurate. According to him,\n\n      impurities in the soil were most likely to be seen by visual inspection through digging of\n\n      trial pits on the site, rather than based solely on a few small diameters of soil samples\n\n      taken from bore holes made in the site. However, during his cross-examination, Chong conceded\n\n      that he had studied the log borings recorded by GT, and that the records showed that the same\n\n      sort of impurities had been founded by GT in all the four (4) bore holes. He conceded that the\n\n      bore holes had been randomly made by GT on the site, and that they were quite a distance away\n\n      from one other. He agreed that the samples collected from those bore holes were a good\n\n      representation of the soil that was randomly found at the site. In view of this evidence, I am\n\n      not minded to discredit the methods adopted by GT and LTL, who after all, had expertise in\n\n      this domain. In my judgment, the defence has not succeeded in casting a doubt on this part of\n\n      the plaintiffs' evidence. In the event, based on GT and LTLs reports, I find that the soil\n\n      deposited and used by TF in their earthworks at the Hume Heights site was of unacceptable\n\n      quality, in that, first, it did not meet the standard set for clean soil, and, secondly,\n\n      it had failed the minimum acceptable industrial standard set for soil bearing capacity.",
        "Particulars of defendants failure to carry out other duties, and the\n\n      resulting damage caused": "34. EMS also alleged that TF had failed to perform the various other\n\n      obligations under the contract. I will now set out each allegation in turn, as well as the\n\n      relevant contractual provisions pertaining to each allegation.35. First, it was alleged that TF had failed to reinstate and clear surface\n\n      drains which had been choked up and damaged in the course of their works. The duty of the\n\n      contractor to maintain surface drains, and to repair and reinstate such drains was set out\n\n      clearly in the contract. Clause 11.5 of the Technical Specifications stated:DIVERSION OF EXISTING DRAINS AND SUBSOIL DRAINSThe Contractor shall be responsible and bear all the costs for the\n\n        diversion of the existing drains. Before the existing drains are cut off, the Contractor\n\n        shall submit his proposal for the diversion and maintenance of the existing drains during\n\n        the whole period of construction to the Superintending Officer for approval.The Contractor shall be responsible for the maintenance of the free flow\n\n        of the drains at all times. At no times shall the Contractor obstruct or reduce the free\n\n        flow area of the existing drain without the prior approval of the Superintending OfficerIf, in the opinion of the Superintending Officer, the Contractor has not\n\n        carried out or ie. unable to carry out all such maintenance of temporary drain diversion to\n\n        the Superintending Officers satisfaction, the Superintending Officer reserves the right\n\n        to employ separate Contractor to carry all such works to ensure the proper maintenance of\n\n        all such temporary works and deduct the cost of all such works plus administrative charge\n\n        from any money due to or become due to the Contractor.The Contractor shall remove all such temporary works as soon as those are\n\n        no longer required and reinstate the site to its original condition to the complete\n\n        satisfaction of the Superintending Officer.Another relevant clause would be cl 19 of the Supplementary Specifications,\n\n      which stated:MAINTENANCE OF DRAINSThe Contractor shall maintain existing open drains on site to ensure\n\n        regular and smooth flow of the waste or drainage water in raining days or seasons.36. Second, EMS alleged that the excessive earthworks dumped by TF had\n\n      suffocated trees on the site, which they had to uproot and replant at their own cost. The\n\n      Technical Specifications in the contract contained detailed instructions as to the contractors\n\n      duties and obligations to preserve existing mature trees, exceeding 600mm in girth. In\n\n      particular, cl 14 (iv)(c) stated:If the growth of the preserved trees is stifled, the Contractor shall\n\n        inter alia bear the cost of making good and charges shall be imposed against the Contractor,In addition, cl 18 of the Supplementary Specifications stated:18 REMOVAL OF TREESThe Contractor shall remove cleared trees/shrubs/vegetation/saplings on\n\n        site from time to time as the works progress. All chokages in existing drains caused by or\n\n        arising out of the works shall be cleared at the Contractors costs and expenses.37. Third, EMS alleged that TF had failed to clean up and reinstate roads\n\n      surrounding, adjoining and leading to the site, which they had dirtied and damaged in the\n\n      course of their works. TFs duties in this regard were set out in the following clauses :CLAUSE 1.2.3 (GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS)CLEANING OF PUBLIC AND EMPLOYER MAINTAINED ROADS AND DRAINSThe Contractor shall ensure that all vehicles used by him, his servants\n\n        or agents, or by his sub-contractors or suppliers, their servants or agents (hereinafter\n\n        referred to as \"the Contractors vehicles\") do not dirty the public and Employer\n\n        maintained roads (and drains) used by these vehicles. In this respect, it is the Contractors\n\n        responsibility to ensure that all such vehicles are properly cleaned before they move onto\n\n        the public or Employer maintained roadsCLAUSE 11.6 (TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS)BACKFILL AND REINSTATEMENT",
        "The existing carriageway, centre island, hard shoulder, side-table, kerbs\n\n        and drains etc. shall be reinstated to their original condition to the satisfaction of the\n\n        Superintending Officer. The Contractor shall make good any depression of the carriageway\n\n        arising as a result of settlement of backfill material and other defects due to\n\n        unsatisfactory reinstatement immediately and as directed by the Superintending Officer.": "38. Next, it was alleged that due to excess amount of earthworks at site\n\n      and defendants failure to properly compact soil, plaintiffs had to undertake turfing to\n\n      stabilise the soil and prevent soil erosion and water stagnation and to lessen possibility of\n\n      landslides.39. Fifth, EMS sought to claim the cost of engaging pest control services\n\n      to eliminate and prevent the breeding of mosquitoes due to water stagnation and defendants\n\n      filling up of Septic Tanks and various pot holes, not properly compacting the soil. Clause 10\n\n      of the General Specifications was relevant in this regard:PEST CONTROLThe Contractor shall ensure minimum collection of rainwater or water\n\n        pools at sites. Comprehensive pest control and surveillance programme shall be implemented\n\n        on site to prevent breeding or harbouring of vectors, all to comply with the requirements of\n\n        ENV40. Finally, EMS alleged that TF had negligently or wrongfully caused\n\n      damage to public and private property in the course of their works. The particulars were as\n\n      follows:(a) due to the unauthorised landfilling activities, the height of lamp\n\n        posts and cable posts had to be raised as they were a safety hazard;(b) TF had damaged an electrical cable in the course of their work;(c) TF had removed without authorisation certain metal bollard posts and\n\n        barricades at a slip road, which EMS have had to replace;(d)due to the excessive and unauthorised earthworks, EMS have had\n\n        to relocate sewer lines and an active manhole which had been buried under the earthworks;(e) TF had, in the course of their works, caused damage to tenants\n\n        property.The relevant contractual clauses were:Clauses 1.1.8 of the General Specifications :In the event that damage is done to public/private services or property\n\n        such as cables, pipes, etc. by the Contractor whether by accident or otherwise causing\n\n        black-out or other nuisance or inconvenience to the public or which is likely to bring the\n\n        Employer into disrepute, all expenditure for such necessary reinstatements or repairs\n\n        incurred shall be recoverable by the Employer from the Contractor by direct payment or by\n\n        deduction from monies due or becoming due to the Contractor or as a debt due by the\n\n        Contractor to the Employer.Clause 1.1.15 of the General Specifications :The work shall be carried out without damage to the adjoining part of the\n\n        structure, adjoining roofing, adjoining pavement and property. The Contractor shall\n\n        reinstate and make good at his own expense any damage caused as a result of the works. Such\n\n        repairs made good are to be properly executed with materials and workmanship to match in\n\n        every respect with the surrounding work.Clause 43:1.5.5 The Contractor shall be responsible for :(a)(b) any injury or damage to property of every kind of the Employer or of\n\n        any other person or corporation or(c) any damage to the works the subject of this Contractfrom any cause whatsoever arising directly or indirectly out of or in\n\n        relation to or in connection with the works under the contract.Clause 4 of the Supplementary Specifications para 2:-The Contractor shall take every preventive measure including timber\n\n        propping to prevent any trees/shrubs/saplings to damage existing boundary, fencing, open\n\n        drains and surrounding school and residential buildings. Any damage done or reinstatement\n\n        works expenses incurred shall be borne by him.Evidence of the defendants failure to carry out other duties, and the\n\n      damage caused41. There was ample evidence before me to support all of the above\n\n      allegations against TF. As a start, EMSs many letters to TF, dating from 30 June 1995 to 25\n\n      September 1995, showed that they had made repeated requests to TF to rectify and reinstate the\n\n      damage caused by the latter. EMS also produced several photographs, taken in or around\n\n      September and October 1995, showing the damage caused by TF. Two (2) photographs showed lamp\n\n      posts which had been reduced from their original heights of 6 to 2 or 4.5 metres. There were\n\n      also photographs showing that the lowest sag points of existing electrical cables had been\n\n      reduced from 2 to 0.5 metres. Other photographs evidenced the fact that existing mature trees,\n\n      which should have been preserved in the course of TFs works, had dried up and died. Still\n\n      other photographs revealed damaged and dirtied roads, submerged roads or sewer lines and\n\n      buried manholes, damaged and choked surface drains and stagnant water pools. EMS also adduced\n\n      in evidence various letters written by several disgruntled tenants living in the vicinity, in\n\n      the months of July, August and September 1995 complaining, inter alia, of black-outs,\n\n      short-circuits, dirtied and damaged roads, soil erosion, breeding of pests and damage to their\n\n      property. There were also letters from the Ministry of Environment and the HDB recording\n\n      complaints of damaged and choked surface drains and dirtied and damaged roads in or around the\n\n      Hume Heights site.42. TF denied the above allegations; they claimed that they had carried out\n\n      reinstatement and repair works before leaving the site, and that they had restored the site,\n\n      including the drains and the roads, to a satisfactory condition. Other than that assertion,\n\n      they had no concrete answer to this part of EMSs case. The only argument they made was in\n\n      relation to the damage of the roads  they alleged that EMS had allowed other contractors\n\n      access to the site, and that those other contractors were the ones who had caused the damage\n\n      to the roads. Kua, however, testified on behalf of EMS that the only other parties who had\n\n      access to the site at the relevant time were contractors employed by the developer of a\n\n      neighbouring site, namely Hillside Condominium, and some contractors engaged by Singapore\n\n      Broadcasting Corporation (SBC). The developers of the Hillside Condominium had obtained the\n\n      permission of EMS to store some pre-cast drains on the Hume Heights site in July 1995. As for\n\n      the contractors engaged by SBC, they had merely entered the site in late 1995 to do some work\n\n      on SBCs transmission tower. He disagreed that these were the parties responsible for the\n\n      damage to the roads surrounding, adjoining or leading to the Hume Heights site.43. In relation to all the allegations of damage caused on the Hume Heights\n\n      site, except for damage to the roads, I find that the said damage must have been caused by TF\n\n      as they were the only parties who had access to the site, and who were carrying out any\n\n      substantial construction activities there at the relevant time. They were the only party whose\n\n      activities could have resulted in the said damage. In relation to the damage to the roads, I\n\n      find on a balance of probabilities, that it was more likely than not that TF were the parties\n\n      responsible for the damage. It was highly unlikely that the vehicles or contractors from the\n\n      Hillside Condominium had caused the said damage to the road, as evidenced in the photographs,\n\n      simply by transporting pre-cast drains for storage on the site. In any event, these\n\n      contractors had entered the site in July 1995, while TF were still on the site and, if they\n\n      had damaged the roads, TF would clearly have raised this fact to EMSs attention somewhere\n\n      in the contemporaneous correspondence. It was also unlikely that the contractors engaged by\n\n      SBC had caused the said damage. The works that they were carrying out on SBCs transmission\n\n      tower were confined to the area immediately surrounding the tower in question, and there is no\n\n      evidence indicating that such activities had affected the Hume Heights site or the roads in\n\n      question. In any event, the photographs taken by TF relating to the work carried out by SBCs\n\n      contractors were dated July 1996, which was some time after the relevant period in which the\n\n      damage to the roads had occurred, namely late 1995.The defendants counterclaims44. I will now turn to consider TFs counterclaims against EMS. TF sought\n\n      to claim the sum of $69,125.00, being the total tender contract price under the original\n\n      contract for the three projects at Hume Heights, Kay Siang Road and Ridout Road. In addition,\n\n      TF sought to claim the sum of $147,459.95 for additional works which they had allegedly\n\n      carried out at the request of EMS.45. I allow TFs first counterclaim for $69,125.00. It is a well\n\n      established contractual principle that so long as there is substantial performance of a\n\n      contract, the contractor is entitled to the stipulated price, subject only to a cross-action\n\n      or counter-claim for the omissions or defects in execution (Bolton v Mahadeva[1972] 2       All ER 1322). In the present case, I find that TF had substantially performed the contract\n\n      which fact was not seriously disputed by EMS.46. In the course of the trial, counsel for TF pointed out that the sum of\n\n      $69,125.00 comprised of $20,000.00 for work done at the Hume Heights site, $14,000.00 for work\n\n      done at Ridout Road and $35,125.00 for work done at Kay Siang Road. The gist of his submission\n\n      appeared to be that there were three (3) separate contracts between TF and EMS, in relation to\n\n      the works done at each of the three (3) sites, and that only the price due for work done at\n\n      the Hume Heights site (that is $20,000.00), could be off-set from EMSs successful claims.\n\n      There was no merit at all in this argument. As the tender and contractual documents covered\n\n      the work to be done by TF atallthree (3) sites, there was clearly only one contract\n\n      existing between the two parties, and not three (3) separate contracts. Under cl 38 of the General\n\n      Conditions of the contract, EMS were entitled to set off any amounts due to TF under the\n\n      contract. Clause 38 stated:All damages (including liquidated damages), costs, charges, expenses,\n\n        debts or sums for which the Contract is liable to the Employer under any provision of this\n\n        Contract between the Employer and the Contractor may be deducted by the Employer from monies\n\n        due or becoming due to the Contractor under the Contract, including any financial indemnity\n\n        or security deposits or bonds.In any event, TF had pleaded the sum of $69,125.00 as a counterclaim\n\n      against EMS, and not strictly as a set-off. Although a set-off and a counterclaim are both\n\n      cross-claims, they are distinguishable from each other. The true nature of a set-off , unlike\n\n      the counterclaim, is that of a defence. Being a defence, a claim in the nature of a set-off\n\n      must, as a general rule, be between the same parties and be made in the same capacity. A\n\n      counterclaim however, is treated as a separate action within the proceedings. Order 15 rule\n\n      2(1) of the Rules of Court provides that:Subject to Rule 5(2), a defendant in any action who alleges that he has\n\n        any claim or is entitled to any relief or remedy against a plaintiff in the actionin\n\n        respect of any matter (whenever and however arising)may, instead of bringing a separate\n\n        action, make a counterclaim in respect of that matter; and where he does so he must add the\n\n        counterclaim to his defence.[Emphasis added]Under O 15 r 2(4), where a defendant establishes a counterclaim against the\n\n      claim of the plaintiff, and there is a balance in favour of one of the parties, the Court may\n\n      give judgment for the balance. The implication of this is that even if there were three (3)\n\n      separate contracts, TFs successful counterclaims would still be counterbalanced or off-set\n\n      against EMSs successful claims. Thus, there was no basis for the submission by TF, that EMS\n\n      should only be allowed to off-set $20,000.00 from its claims, and not the total sum of\n\n      $69,125.00.47. TFs other counterclaim for $147,459.95 was for additional work done,\n\n      the particulars being:(a) clearance of 35 trees of girth exceeding 600 mm;(b) desilting of a drain requiring manpower of 10 men for 20 days on nine\n\n        hour shifts;(c) compensation for inability to carry out earth-filling works at Hume\n\n        Heights site in accordance with the initial boundary marks in the tender drawings as a\n\n        result of incorrect boundary demarcations;(d) mobilization of equipment for works at Hume Heights for 15 days when\n\n        access was denied due to an official ceremony;(e) change of method of clearance at Kay Siang site from machinery to\n\n        manual, claim for down-tool time;(f) additional clearance and turfing work done at Ridout Road;(g) change of method of clearance at Ridout Road site from machinery to\n\n        manual and claim for down tool time.48. EMS disputed liability to pay TF for any of the above additional works.\n\n      They denied that they had at any time requested the additional work done by TF, or that any of\n\n      their representatives had ever issued any instructions for the additional work to be done.\n\n      Thus, the issue was a question of fact, with Kua testifying on behalf of EMS against the word\n\n      of Tan testifying on behalf of TF. Having considered the evidence before me, I find that TF\n\n      had not adduced sufficient evidence to prove its counterclaim for additional works. Indeed,\n\n      there was hardly any evidence at all to substantiate this counterclaim. There were no records\n\n      whatsoever of any requests made by EMS for the additional works. The entire project was\n\n      completed in September 1995. Yet, the only quotation sent by TF for the additional works was a\n\n      statement of claim dated 12 December 1995. Notably, the dispute between the parties had\n\n      already become full-blown by that date. TF adduced one document showing a request by the\n\n      organisers of an official ceremony in the vicinity of Hume Heights for land fill work to\n\n      be suspended at the Hume Heights site from 7 to 9 July 1995. This did not substantiate their\n\n      claim that they had incurred costs for mobilizing their equipment for 15 days. In any event,\n\n      the document stated that land-fill work (as opposed to all activities) should be\n\n      suspended between 7 and 9 July 1995, and TF themselves had said that all earthworks at Hume\n\n      Heights were completed by the end of June 1995. The other evidence adduced by TF was various\n\n      photographs, which I do not find sufficient to prove their counterclaim for additional works.Conclusion49. Accordingly, I award interlocutory judgment to EMS with costs on their\n\n      claim against TF, with damages to be assessed at a later date; the costs of such assessment\n\n      shall be reserved to the Registrar. I allow TFs first counterclaim for $69,125.00, being\n\n      the contract price due to them, with interest at 6% from the date of filing (25 February 2000)\n\n      of the counterclaim until this date and costs. However, their second counterclaim in respect\n\n      of additional work done, is dismissed with costs. The costs awarded to the defendants for\n\n      their first counterclaim shall be set-off against the costs dismissing their second\n\n      counterclaim; as the former would likely be cancelled out by the latter in effect, it means no\n\n      order for costs on the entire counterclaim. Finally, as the plaintiffs' claim after assessment\n\n      may well exceed the defendants' first counterclaim, there shall be a stay on the defendants'\n\n      receipt of the latter sum until after the assessment of the damages due to the plaintiffs.\n\n      There will be no prejudice caused to the defendants thereby as the interest awarded continues\n\n      to run on the sum of $69,125.00 until their receipt of the same or, until the date of set-off\n\n      against the plaintiffs' claim or costs (when taxed) as the case may be.",
