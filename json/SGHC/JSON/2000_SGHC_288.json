        "Conclusion": "19          As regards the figure of $177,000 which was in contention before me, there was little dispute that this sum indeed featured in an invoice dated 27 August 1990 from one Thai-Pore Enterprises Pte Ltd (page 65 of the Bundle of Documents). This is the very invoice which details the purchase of 20,000 cartons of beer referred to in paragraph 15 of the learned assistant registrar's grounds of decision. The said invoice states that the price of the 20,000 cartons of beer is $310,000. Immediately beneath this entry there is a reference to a sum of $177,000 as being payment to be made in Phnom Penh to one Chief Engineer of Mekong Express, Mr Tan. This document, I was informed, was at all times in the possession of the plaintiffs and consequently produced by the plaintiffs as part of their exhibits at the inquiry below. 20          Counsel for the defendant submitted that the issue as respects this sum was specifically raised before the learned assistant registrar but unfortunately there was no specific finding on this by the learned assistant registrar. Counsel's submission was that the defendant at all times maintained that this sum of $177,000 was paid for the beer directly to the supplier Thai-Pore Pte Ltd (para 16 of counsel’s submission). 21          Defendant’s counsel then highlighted the aspect (paragraph 17 of his submission) that it was never suggested or put to the defendant during the inquiry hearing that the amount of $177,000 was never paid to the supplier of beer for account of the plaintiffs. Counsel went on to submit (paragraphs 18 and 19 of his submission) that the invoice bespoken was in fact produced by the plaintiffs in their affidavit and curiously the defendant was never at any stage of the hearing challenged on this. The omission to croo-examine the defendant on this very aspect was conceded by plaintiffs’ counsel in his submission (paragraph 2.2 (c)). 22            In the main, the arguments by both counsel revolved around the question as on whom the burden of proof lay. Plaintiffs’ counsel contended that it lay on the defendant. The defendant’s counsel’s reply was that the defendant had discharged his onus by relying on the entry in the said invoice which was produced by the plaintiffs and had been in their possession for a very long period of time on which there was no query raised by the plaintiffs all this while. Counsel for the defendant also argued that at any rate, the plaintiffs’ failure to challenge the claim of the defendant effectively prevented the plaintiffs from raising this issue any further. Implicit in this argument was the submission that had the defendant been challenged, he might well have been in a position at the trial to offer an acceptable explanation or alternatively would have attempted to produce additional material or offered a plausible explanation to support his case. 23            It should be observed at the outset that it was on account of the unsatisfactory state of accounts kept by the parties, Khoo J in the first instance rejected the claim of the plaintiffs based on account stated and ordered the taking of accounts. 24            The learned assistant registrar who conducted the inquiry had indeed a difficult task before him, which I would say had been carried out by him admirably and with great competence. The only missing item in his findings was the averment of the defendant as respects this sum of $177,000. Despite a positive averment by the defendant on which there was neither cross-examination nor any challenge by the plaintiffs, this item seemed to have eluded the scrutiny. When the matter came up on appeal, I was at the outset minded to remit the matter to the learned assistant registrar for re-evaluation. But then I was prevailed upon by counsel that all that needed to be presented was on the record and the court hearing the appeal was well entitled to draw proper inferences and arrive at a conclusion based on available evidence. 25            In my view, the submission on behalf of plaintiffs’ counsel that the defendant had not discharged his onus seemed to ignore the reliance by the defendant on the plaintiffs’ own document. Also, to the detriment of the plaintiffs there was no cross-examination on this. 26          It is perhaps instructive at this point to make reference to the rule inBrowne v Dunn(1894) 6 R 67 (HL) which is well-entrenched in our jurisprudence – both in the realm of criminal law and civil proceedings.   It should be remembered that the said rule has two aspects. In its first aspect the rule inBrowne v Dunnis a rule of practice or procedure designed to achieve fairness to witnesses and a fair trial between the parties. In its second aspect it is a rule relating to weight or cogency of evidence (seeBulstrode v Trimble[1970] VR 840at 843 – per Newton J). The said rule has been well-formulated by Hunt J inAllied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation[1983] 44 ALR 607at 623 as follows: It has in my experience always been a rule of professional practice that, unless notice has already clearly been given of the cross-examiner’s intention to rely upon such matters, it is necessary to put to an opponent’s witness in cross-examination the nature of the case upon which it is proposed to rely in contradiction of his evidence, particularly where that case relies upon interferences to be drawn from other evidence in the proceedings. Such a rule of practice is necessary both to give the witness the opportunity to deal with that other evidence, or the inferences to be drawn from it, and to allow the other party the opportunity to call evidence either to corroborate that explanation or to contradict the inference sought to be drawn. 27          Later on Hunt J at page 630 (supra) added: … Secondly, and far more significantly, it gives the party calling the witness the opportunity to call corroborative evidence which in the absence of such a challenge is unlikely to have been called. Thirdly, it gives the witness the opportunity both to explain or to qualify his own evidence in the light of the contradiction of which warning has been given and also, if  he can, to explain or to qualify the other evidence upon which the challenge is to be based … 28            As I see it, the question as to on whose shoulders the burden lay in civil proceedings becomes somewhat academic when one contestant leads his opponent to believe that the former does not intend to challenge the assertion of the other. 29In my opinion, the plaintiffs by their failure to challenge or cross-examine the defendant on his averments as to the sum of $177,000 in a way lulled the defendant into believing that the claim for such sum was not put in issue. Had there been a challenge, as had been done apparently rather spiritedly in regard to other items, it might well be that the defendant would have called for additional ammunition to fight his cause. The failure by the plaintiffs, doubtless, represented the sort of conduct described byAlexander Popein the well-known passage in which he criticised those who were willing to wound and yet afraid to strike. 30            This is a case where an inquiry was being held to determine the credit and debit sides of each parties. Strictly speaking in an inquiry of this nature the plaintiffs and the defendants bear an equal burden in establishing their respective standpoints and the standard of proof is one of balance of probabilities. 31          In my determination, the non-cross-examination of the defendant on this matter most certainly weakened the plaintiffs' claim for the credit claimed. Moreover, the plaintiffs who had this particular invoice with them for quite sometime - bearing in mind the invoice dated back to a transaction in 1990 - should have been prompt in seeking clarification or raised a query over this item much earlier had they wanted to. Such a failure on the part of the plaintiffs indeed affected the overall weight to be given to the plaintiffs' evidence and tended to tilt the scale now in favour of the defendant. The learned assistant registrar unfortunately had omitted to deal with this aspect in his ground. Having regard to the material placed before me and the arguments presented, I am of the view that the plaintiffs are not entitled to the credit of $177,000. 32A postcript is perhaps warranted at this stage. In this appeal the only matter which was in issue before me was in relation to a credit entry of $177,000. After considering all the arguments, the issue was decided by me in favour of the defendant. The plaintiffs being dissatisfied with my decision have filed a notice of appeal. Section 34 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act provides that except with the leave of the Court of Appeal or a Judge, no appeal shall be brought to the Court of Appeal (amongst other things) when the amount or value of the subject matter at the trial is $250,000 or less. Although the said section bespeaks the value ofsubject matter at the trialit is also in my view intended to refer to the amount of thesubject matter on appealas well. Since the appeal before me was limited only to a sum of $177,000 it would appear to me that leave is a pre-requisite to an appeal to the Court of Appeal. However, at the time of my releasing my grounds of decision, I am not made aware of any such leave being obtained."
