        "Introduction": "1 HC/SUM 4434/2022 (“SUM 4434”) is an application by the defendant (“the Defendant”) to (a) stay the Singapore proceedings on the ground offorum nonconveniensin favour of court proceedings in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) (“Stay Application”), (b) set aside the warrant of arrest against the Defendant’s vessel due to alleged material non-disclosures by the plaintiff (“the Plaintiff”) when the warrant of arrest was obtained, (c) for the partial security furnished by the Defendant to the Plaintiff by way of payment of S$ 8,846,383 into Court be returned to the Defendant, and (d) for the partial security furnished in the form of a Letter of Undertaking dated 17 November 2022 be returned to the Defendant for cancellation. 2 On 3 November 2023, I saw the parties and made the following orders in SUM 4434, with brief grounds provided: (a) the Stay Application is granted, (b) the application to set aside the warrant of arrest is dismissed, (c) the partial security furnished by the Defendant to the Plaintiff by way of payment of S$ 8,846,383 into Court be returned to the Defendant, and (d) the partial security furnished by the Defendant to the Plaintiff by way of a Letter of Undertaking is to be returned to the Defendant for cancellation. 3  I now set out my full grounds below.",
        "Facts": "4 On 27 April 2021, a collision between two shipping vessels, i.e. the “A Symphony” and the “Sea Justice” occurred off the coast of Qingdao, PRC (the “Collision”). The Collision substantially damaged the hull, cargo, and equipment of the “A Symphony” and led to a significant marine pollution incident.1Foot Note 1×Plaintiff’s written submissions dated 28 February 2023 (“Plaintiff’s Written Submissions”) at [13] to [14].",
        "The parties": "5 The Plaintiff, Symphony Shipbuilding SA, is a company incorporated in the Republic of Liberia. They were the owner of the vessel “A Symphony”.2Foot Note 2×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [11]. 6 The Defendant, Sea Justice Ltd, is a company incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. It was the owner of the Panamanian-flagged vessel “Sea Justice” at the time of the collision.3Foot Note 3×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [12]. 7 For completeness, and as submitted by the parties, I note that both the “A Symphony” and the “Sea Justice” were, at different times, sold and renamed after this Admiralty action, HC/ADM 61/2021 (“ADM 61”) was filed.4Foot Note 4×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [11] and [12].Both parties are pursuing their claims as the former owners of the two vessels.",
        "Background to the dispute": "8 On 28 April 2021, the Plaintiff filed ADM 61 against the Defendant in Singapore, claiming that the Collision was caused by the negligent navigation, control, and/or management of the Defendant and/or their servants or agents of the “Sea Justice”.",
        "Procedural history": "9 Apart from filing ADM 61 in Singapore, legal proceedings were also commenced in Qingdao, PRC, as well as in the Marshall Islands (which was an action by the Plaintiff against the Defendantinpersonam, since the Defendant was incorporated there).5Foot Note 5×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [16] to [19]; Defendant’s written submissions dated 28 February 2023 (“Defendant’s Written Submissions”) at [7] to [18].To better understand the present claim, I set out the salient facts relating to the Qingdao proceedings and the Marshall Islands proceedings, as well as what led to the arrest of the “Sea Justice” in Singapore. The proceedings in Qingdao, PRC 10 On 30 April 2021, the Defendant applied to the Qingdao Maritime Court (“Qingdao Court”) in the PRC to constitute a limitation fund for all maritime claims arising from the Collision (the “187 Application”).6Foot Note 6×Defendant’s Written Submissions at [7]. 11 On 8 May 2021, the Defendant commenced a claim against the Plaintiff to determine the Collision liability between the parties, and for the Plaintiff to compensate the Defendant’s loss as per the apportioned collision liability (the “Defendant’s Inter-Ship Claim”).7Foot Note 7×Defendant’s Written Submissions at [8]. 12 From 27 to 29 May 2021, the Qingdao Court published notices in the People’s Court Daily calling for interested parties to object to the 187 Application within 30 days of the Notices or, for those who have received a written notice from the Qingdao Court, within 7 days upon receipt of such written notice, in accordance with Article 106.1 of the Special Maritime Procedure Law of China. No objections were filed, whether by the Plaintiff or any other parties.8Foot Note 8×Defendant’s Written Submissions at [9]. 13 On 25 June 2021, the Plaintiff’s North of England Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) Club (“NEPIA”) commenced proceedings in the Qingdao Court to constitute a limitation fund for its own liability arising out of the Collision. This limitation fund was constituted to protect the Plaintiff against third-party claims for damages caused by the oil spill, under the 1992 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (to which the PRC is a contracting state) (“AS CLC Limitation Fund”).9Foot Note 9×Defendant’s Written Submissions at [10]. 14 On 12 July 2021, the Qingdao Court issued a civil ruling and approved the 187 Application creating what parties refer to as the “SJ Limitation Fund”. The SJ Limitation Fund was constituted for all maritime claims arising from the Collision.10Foot Note 10×Defendant’s Written Submissions at [11]. 15 On 26 or 27 July 2021, the Plaintiff and NEPIA applied to register its claims against the SJ Limitation Fund,11Foot Note 11×2nd Affidavit of Eleftherios Tsouris at [20]; 1st Affidavit of Corinne Lam at p. 27 to 29.and this application was granted by the Qingdao Court on 27 August 2021.12Foot Note 12×2nd Affidavit of Eleftherios Tsouris at [20]. 16 On 18 August 2021, the Qingdao Court approved the AS CLC Limitation Fund, which, as alluded to above was constituted to protect the Plaintiff from third-party claims for damages caused by the oil spill.13Foot Note 13×Defendant’s Written Submissions at [13]. 17 On 6 September 2021, the Plaintiff and NEPIA jointly commenced an action against the Defendant in the Qingdao Court to determine the collision liability between the parties and to compensate the losses and costs suffered by the Plaintiff (the “Plaintiff’s Inter-Ship Claim”).14Foot Note 14×Defendant’s Written Submissions at [15]. 18 On 18 April 2022, the Plaintiff and the Defendant filed their evidence in respect of the Plaintiff’s Inter-Ship Claim and the Defendant’s Inter-Ship Claim.15Foot Note 15×Defendant’s Written Submissions at [16]. 19 On 19 April 2022, the Court heard and directed the Inter-Ship Claims to be consolidated. At the said hearing, the Plaintiff’s PRC lawyers made oral submissions on the Plaintiff’s defence on the liability for the Collision and on the evidence tendered by the Defendant (the “19 April 2022 Hearing”).16Foot Note 16×Defendant’s Written Submissions at [17]. 20 On 27 May 2022, the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s lawyers conferred on the evidence tendered by the parties and jointly confirmed in writing to the Qingdao Court on the authenticity of the evidence.17Foot Note 17×Defendant’s Written Submissions at [18]. The proceedings commenced in the Marshall Islands 21 The Plaintiff also commenced an actioninpersonamagainst the Defendant in the Marshall Islands on 6 May 2021 (the “Marshall Islands Claim”).18Foot Note 18×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [16].The Defendant applied to stay the Marshall Islands proceedings on the grounds offorum nonconveniensand its application was granted.19Foot Note 19×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [17].At the hearing on 16 August 2023, the Defendant’s counsel informed me that the Plaintiff’s appeal against the stay order was dismissed. Application for a world-wide behaviour preservation order in the Qingdao Court 22 On 12 October 2021, the Defendant applied to the Qingdao Court for a worldwide behaviour preservation order against the Plaintiff (the “ASI Application”).20Foot Note 20×The translated version of the application can be found in the 2nd Affidavit of Tam Kin Man.This order is, in essence, similar to an anti-suit injunction,21Foot Note 21×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [19].and I will refer to it as such. The ASI Application contained,inter alia,prayers that the Plaintiff be prohibited from initiating any form of legal proceedings against the Defendant in the courts of the PRC or other countries and regions, and that the Plaintiff withdraw, terminate, or not proceed with the claims filed against the Defendant in the Marshall Islands. 23 The ASI Application was dismissed by the Qingdao Court on 17 February 2022. The Court held that the act of first filing a lawsuit in the Marshall Islands did not violate the laws and regulations of the PRC, and in any case, found that there was no evidence to show that the Plaintiff’s behaviour had made it difficult to enforce the judgment of the Chinese court or to cause the legal rights and interest of the Defendant to be violated.22Foot Note 22×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [105]. The warrant of arrest and release of the “Sea Justice” in exchange for security being put up in Singapore 24 On 19 October 2022, the Plaintiff got wind that the “Sea Justice” was about to enter Singapore waters. On the same day, the Plaintiff applied for a warrant of arrest against the “Sea Justice” under s 4(3) High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (“HCAJA”), based on a maritime lien arising out of the Collision (“Lien”). The Plaintiff’s application was granted on 19 October 2022.23Foot Note 23×Defendant’s Written Submissions at [19].The “Sea Justice” was arrested on 20 October 2022 after entering Singapore port limits.24Foot Note 24×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [15]; Defendant’s Written Submissions at [20]. 25 The “Sea Justice” was released on 19 November 2022,25Foot Note 25×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [22]; Defendant’s Written Submissions at [21].following an agreement between the parties that the Defendant would provide security for the claim in Singapore. The parties agreed on the form and quantum of security to be provided as follows:26Foot Note 26×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [21]; Defendant’s Written Submissions at [2.3] to [2.4]. (a) partial security in the form of a Letter of Undertaking issued by The Swedish Club dated 17 November 2022 as security for the maximum aggregate sum of US$ 13.5 million; and, (b) partial security by way of payment into the Court on 30 November 2022 of the SGD equivalent of US$ 6.5 million.",
        "The parties’ positions": "26 The Defendant’s case, in a nutshell, is that the Stay Application ought to be granted because the Collision took place off the coast of Qingdao, PRC, and Chinese law ought to be thelex loci delicti. The PRC should therefore be the natural forum. Further, save for the fact that the “Sea Justice” was arrested in Singapore, there are no other connecting factors to Singapore such that the dispute over liability (and damages) should be heard here. The Defendant further contends that there were material non-disclosures made by the Plaintiff in its application for the warrant to arrest of the “Sea Justice”, and the said warrant should accordingly be set aside. For the two reasons mentioned above, the Defendant submits that the security obtained in exchange for the release of the “Sea Justice” should therefore be returned in full. 27 In response, the Plaintiff contends that the Stay Application should not be granted as, amongst other arguments made, the Defendant has not shown that the PRC is clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum such that substantial justice cannot be obtained by the Plaintiff in the PRC, and that there are, in any case, no concerns of infringing international comity since the Qingdao Court has denied the Defendant’s application for a worldwide behaviour preservation order to restrain parties like the Plaintiff from commencing legal proceedings against the Defendant in a foreign jurisdiction. 28 As regards the alleged material non-disclosures, the Plaintiff submitted that full and frank disclosure has been made and the warrant of arrest should not be set aside. Accordingly, the Plaintiff should not be ordered to return the security obtained from the Defendant. 29 During the course of hearings, the Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Timothy Tan, made an alternative submission. He submitted that should the Court decide to grant the Stay Application, the Court should also grant a “case management stay” or a “conditional stay”. The gist of such a stay is as follows: The proceedings in Singapore be stayed in favour of Qingdao Court on condition that (a) the security obtained from the Defendant remains with the Plaintiff, and (b) liberty be granted to the Plaintiff to lift the stay to enforce the Chinese judgment (assuming it prevails in Qingdao Court), to claim damages it could not have claimed against the security obtained from the Defendant. The Plaintiff argued that it would not be doubly compensated because the amount which the Plaintiff had claimed against the Defendant was over US$ 112.3m, and the SJ Limitation Fund was only just over US$ 6.1m.",
        "Issues to be determined": "30 The issues that the Court have to determine are as follows: (a)First,whether the Court should grant a stay of the Singapore proceedings in favour of the proceedings in the Qingdao Court? (b)Second, whether the warrant of arrest granted on 19 October 2022 should be set aside for material non-disclosure? (c)Third, if the Court decides to grant a stay of the Singapore proceedings, what order should the Court make with respect to the security that was furnished by the Defendant to secure the release of the “Sea Justice”? Should a “case management stay” or a “conditional stay” be ordered?",
        "Issue 1: Whether Singapore or the PRC is the more appropriate forum for the dispute": "",
        "The parties’ cases": "122 In respect of the application to set aside the warrant of arrest, the Defendant argued that the Plaintiff had failed to disclose four material facts at the Duty Registrar hearing, i.e., when the Plaintiff applied for the warrant of arrest. These are: (a) The failure to disclose that the Plaintiff had relied on an erroneous translation of its affidavit in relation to the Plaintiff’s reservation of its rights to submit to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court. The Plaintiff had misrepresented to the Duty Registrar that it had reserved its right to challenge the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court by adding the non-existent phrase “or acceptance of jurisdiction of your court or application of law” in its in-house English translation of its application to the Qingdao Court to register its claims against the SJ Limitation Fund. This phrase was however never in the original Chinese language document and it was only after the Defendant highlighted the glaring mistranslation that the Plaintiff admitted the error. The Defendant assert that the misrepresentation the Plaintiff made was a deliberate attempt by the Plaintiff to portray to the Court that the Plaintiff has not accepted and/or submitted to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court even though it has registered its claims against the SJ Limitation Fund (“Material Fact 1”). (b) The failure to disclose that the Plaintiff did not file any objection to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court within the statutory time limit (“Material Fact 2”). (c) The failure to disclose that it had taken part in a Qingdao Court hearing which was related to the Inter-Ship Claims (“Material Fact 3”); and. (d) The failure to disclose that the AS CLC Limitation Fund had been constituted in the Qingdao Court, and that the Plaintiff had brought an indemnity claim against that fund in the Plaintiff’s Inter-Ship Claim (“Material Fact 4”). 123 The Plaintiff’s response to Material Fact 1 was that they made full and sufficient disclosure of the existence of the two Inter-Ship claims in its affidavit filed in support of the application for the warrant of arrest, and at the arrest hearing itself. The Plaintiff also took pains to point out, in its written submissions and at the hearings, that the translation error was innocent and inadvertent. They submitted that the translation error was due to the Plaintiff’s PRC solicitors having inadvertently provided their Singapore counsel with an outdated in-house translation of the Plaintiff’s Application for Registration of Claim, at the time when the application for a warrant of arrest in Singapore was filed.57Foot Note 57×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [30].Upon realising the error, they raised and explained the above by way of affidavit.58Foot Note 58×1st Affidavit of Wang Yongli. 124 Regardless, the Plaintiff submitted that all four alleged material facts are not relevant as the minutia of their claims were not relevant to the Duty Registrar’s assessment of whether the warrant of arrest should have been granted. In their view, only the fact that proceedings were commenced in the PRC, and what those proceedings are, were relevant to the Duty Registrar’s assessment. In any case, the Plaintiff’s solicitors had brought the attention of the Duty Registrar to the proceedings in the Qingdao Court, including the Qingdao Court hearing relating to the Inter-Ship Claims, and the constitution of the AS CLC Limitation Fund. I pause here to highlight that having gone through the records, the Plaintiff’s solicitor did not allude to the Inter-Ship Clams and the constitution of the AS CLC Limitation Fund at the hearing before the Duty Registrar.",
        "The law onforum nonconveniens": "35 It is trite that a stay on the ground offorum nonconvenienswill only be granted if the two-stage test inSpiliadaMaritime Corporation v Cansulex[1987] AC 460 (the “Spiliadatest”) is satisfied. 36 Briefly, stage 1 requires the Court to determine whether,prima facie,there is some other available forum that is “clearly or distinctly more appropriate” for the case to be tried. At this stage, the burden of proof is on the party seeking the stay,ie, the Defendant in the present case. If the court concludes that there is aprima faciemore appropriate alternative forum, the analysis moves to stage 2. At stage 2, the Court will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nonetheless not be granted. At this stage, the burden of proof is on the party resisting the stay application (seeBest Soar Ltd v Praxis Energy Agents Pte Ltd[2018] 3 SLR 423 (“Best Soar v Praxis Energy Agents”) at [15], citingRappo, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal[2017] 2 SLR 265 (“Tania Rappo”) at [68]–[69] andRickshaw Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron vonUexkull[2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“Rickshaw Investments”) on the application of theSpiliadatest). 37 I now summarise the factors that the court must consider at each stage. Stage 1 38 While not cited by the parties, I find that it is useful to consider the factors listed inThe Eleftheria[1969] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 237 (the “Eleftheriafactors”). TheEleftheriafactors remain both relevant and good law in Singapore when deciding whether to grant a stay application on the ground offorum nonconveniens(seeBunge SA and another v Indian Bank[2015] SGHC 330 at [35]). TheEleftheriafactors are as follows: (a) in what country is the evidence on the issues of fact situated or more readily available, and the effect of that on the relative convenience and expense of the trial as between the Singapore and the foreign court; (b) whether the law of the foreign court applies, and, if so, whether it differs from Singapore law in any material respects; (c) with what country either party is connected, and if so, how closely; (d) whether the defendants genuinely desire trial in the foreign country, or are only seeking procedural advantages; and (e) whether the plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in the foreign court because they would: (i) be deprived of security for their claim; (ii) be unable to enforce any judgment obtained; (iii) be faced with a time bar not applicable here; or (iv) for political, racial, religious or other reasons be unlikely to get a fair trial. 39 Other general factors the Court should consider are the personal connections of the parties and witnesses, connections to relevant events and transactions, applicable law,lisalibi pendens(through the risk of overlapping judgments), and the shape of litigation, though these factors should not be applied mechanically (seeTania Rappoat [71]). As a general principle, the place where a tort was committed isprima faciethe natural forum for that tortious claim (seeThe“Reecon Wolf”[2012] 2 SLR 289 (“TheReecon Wolf”) at [16] andJIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd[2011] 1 SLR 391 (“JIO Minerals”) at [106], citingRickshaw Investmentsat [39]). 40 Furthermore, in an admiralty claim, the nature and existence of multiple or concurrent proceedings and the weight to be given to this factor will depend on all the circumstances of the case, including how advanced the other foreign action is, consequences of ongoing proceedings in terms of inconvenience, expenses, and other matters such as the risk of conflicting judgments (seeTheReecon Wolfat [17]). The risk of conflicting judgments arising from concurrent proceedings is not necessarily a decisive factor in determining whether a stay should be ordered, and this must be weighed against the other factors in the overallforum nonconveniensanalysis (seeRickshaw Investmentsat [90]). Stage 2 41 At the second stage, the main consideration is whether substantial justice can be obtained in the foreign court (seeJIO Mineralsat [43]). The question is whether the foreign court would be able to try the dispute in a manner which is procedurally and substantively fair (seeTania Rappoat [110]). The burden lies on the plaintiff to establish “objectively by cogent evidence” that there is some personal or juridical advantage available to the plaintiff in the Singapore proceedings, and that it is of such importance that it would cause injustice to the plaintiff to deprive the plaintiff of it (seeTheReecon Wolfat [18]). 42 As to what constates a personal or juridical advantage, the High Court inTheReecon Wolfheld (at [37]) that “[i]t would be contrary toTheSpiliadaprinciples to look favourably upon a party who selected a forum based solely upon the level of damages that could be awarded or higher limits of liability”. The court therefore concluded (at [55]) that the existence of different limitation regimes is not considered a personal or juridical advantage under Stage 2. This is important and I will come back to this in my analysis.",
        "Analysis": "137 As a starting point, whether the Plaintiff raised the issue of a reservation of rights when it registered its claim against the SJ Limitation Fund is relevant when considering granting a warrant of arrest. The reservation of rights signals to both the Qingdao Court and the Singapore court that the Plaintiff is intent to proceed with the legal action in the Singapore court and not the Qingdao Court. The fact that the Plaintiff had participated in the legal proceedings commenced in the Qingdao Court without any express reservation or objection to the Qingdao Court’s jurisdiction is therefore inconsistent with what the Plaintiff told the Court during the warrant of arrest application. 138 Further, I note that by 19 October 2022 (which was when the application for a warrant of arrest was made), apart from the fact that the SJ Limitation Fund had been constituted and that the Plaintiff had registered its claim against the Fund, other proceedings in the Qingdao Court have also by then commenced and they are as follows: (a) the Inter-Ship Claims on liability had been filed by both parties; (b) NEPIA had filed, and the Qingdao Court had approved, for a limitation fund to be set up to protect the Plaintiff from 3rd party claims (Material Fact 4); (c) parties have filed their evidence in relation to their respective Inter-Ship Claims (Material Fact 3); and (d) the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s lawyers had conferred on the evidence tendered by the parties and jointly confirmed in writing to the Qingdao Court on the authenticity of the evidence. 139 For reasons only known to the Plaintiff, these were not disclosed to the Duty Registrar. 140 The picture that was painted to the Duty Registrar was that (a) a SJ Limitation Fund was set up in the Qingdao Court, (b) the Plaintiff has registered its claims against the said fund albeit with a reservation of rights, and (c) the Defendant’s ASI Application was rejected, and therefore the Plaintiff can continue with proceedings commenced in Singapore. 141 This was somewhat different from what had transpired in reality, i.e. that the Plaintiff did not object to the jurisdiction to the Qingdao Court in not one but four applications, and that proceedings in the Qingdao Court had begun and progress more than just the fact that the SJ Limitation Fund had been constituted and the Plaintiff registering their claims against the said fund had been made. 142 While I was not entirely convinced with the Plaintiff’s argument that the application should still be construed as one which was made with a strict reservation of rights as to jurisdiction even without the Missing Words (since no reasons were proffered to explain why the Missing Word had to be included in the first place if that was the case), the Defendant had offered no expert opinion to rebut the Prof Chu’s opinion on this. Accordingly, the court only has Prof Chu’s opinion to rely on. 143 Since it was still possible, in substance, for the Plaintiff not to submit to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court under Chinese law by challenging its jurisdiction by making a “procedural defence”, and that the Plaintiff did draw the Duty Registrar’s attention to fact that the Defendant’s ASI Application was denied by the Qingdao Court, I find that the lack of the Missing Words in the reservation of rights clause was, in the overall circumstance, not material to the granting of the warrant of arrest. 144 As alluded to above, the Court always retains an overriding discretion whether or not to set aside a warrant of arrest (seeTheFierbintiat [41]). In exercising this discretion, the Court often applies the principle of proportionality in assessing the sin of omission against the impact of such default. 145 The “sin” in the present case is the limited extent of the disclosure made by the arresting solicitor at the hearing before the Duty Registrar. In my view, every proceeding before the Qingdao Court preceding the hearing before the Duty Registrar should have been disclosed. That said, the impact of not disclosing more was not significant considering that the Plaintiff would still be able to challenge the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court even if it did not expressly reserve its rights on jurisdiction. I therefore exercise my discretion not to set aside the warrant of arrest. For completeness, I note that a reservation of rights on jurisdiction is not the same as a rejection of jurisdiction. Had the Plaintiff stated on its affidavit accompanying the application for the warrant of arrest that it had rejected the Qingdao Court’s jurisdiction even though it applied to register its claims against the SJ Limitation Fund, the outcome would have been different.",
        "Issue 2: Whether the warrant of arrest should be set aside": "",
        "The law on setting aside a warrant of arrest": "125 When applying for a warrant of arrest, the Plaintiff is under a duty to disclose to the court hearing that application all matters within their knowledge which might be material, even if it may be prejudicial to their claim (seeThe\"Vasiliy Golovnin”[2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 (“TheVasiliy Golovnin”) at [83]). Whether a fact is material or not is an objective test of whether it is relevant (seeTheVasiliy Golovninat [87];The “Rainbow Spring”[2003] 3 SLR(R) 362 at [33]). The Plaintiff must draw the attention of the judge to the relevant papers, and it is not sufficient to produce exhibits which contain the papers if no specific reference is made to them; a failure to refer to material documents is a failure to disclose (seeTheVasiliy Golovninat [94]). 126 However, as restated inThe“Jeil Crystal”[2021] SGHC 292 at [69] and [70], when the Court condemns material non-disclosure by setting aside the warrant of arrest obtainedexparte, it is doing so in the public interest to discourage the abuse of the procedure. It is therefore important whether the warrant of arrest was done in good faith (seeTreasure Valley Group Ltd v Saputra Teddy and another (Ultramarine Holdings Ltd, intervener)[2006] 1 SLR(R) 358 at [23]). 127 Furthermore, the warrant of arrest need not always be set aside in cases of material non-disclosure. The Court always retains an overriding discretion whether or not to set aside a warrant of arrest (seeThe“Fierbinti”[1994] 3 SLR(R) 574 (“TheFierbinti”) at [41]). In exercising this discretion, the Court often applies the principle of proportionality in assessing the sin of omission against the impact of such default, which requires an assessment of the material facts and the circumstances in which the application was made (seeTheVasiliy Golovninat [84]). 128 What then is the test for materiality for non-disclosure? The test was summarised inThe“Damavand”[1993] 2 SLR(R) 136 at [30] (cited with approval inTheVasiliy Golovninat [85]): ... [T]he test of materiality is whether the fact is relevant to the making of the decision whether or not to issue the warrant of arrest, that is, a fact which should properly be taken into consideration when weighing all the circumstances of the case, though it need not have the effect of leading to a different decision being made. ... 129 InThe Eagle Prestige[2010] 3 SLR 294 (“The Eagle Prestige”), Belinda Ang J (as she then was) commented on the process of obtaining a warrant of arrest and observed that (seeThe Eagle Prestigeat [74]): …The concerns of the court at the application stage are firstly, with considerations of jurisdiction in rem (and generally not the merits of the claim) and secondly, disclosure of material facts which are germane to considerations of jurisdiction in rem and overlaying that is the absence of facts and circumstances suggesting an abuse of the arrest process. [emphasis in original]",
        "Facts brought to the attention of the Duty Registrar": "130 A summary of the pertinent facts which the Plaintiff had informed the Duty Registrar at the warrant of arrest application on 19 October 2022 whether through the supporting affidavit or at the Duty Registrar hearing are as follows: (a) The Collision took place of the port of Qingdao, PRC; (b) “A Symphony” was damaged as a result of the Collision and details of the damage can be gleaned from the Marine Accident Report dated 27 April 2021 which was annexed to the supporting affidavit; (c) A writ in rem against the “Sea Justice” was filed on 28 April 2021 in respect of the Collision, which was renewed for 12 months from 28 April 2022; (d) The arrest was pursuant to s 4(3) of the HCAJA as the Plaintiff’s claim is found on a Collision maritime lien over the “Sea Justice”, which is the ship or vessel directly connected to the Plaintiff’s claim. (e) The Plaintiff’s claim also falls within s 3(1)(d) or in the alternative, s 3(1)(e) of the HCAJA, being a claim for damage done or received by a ship respectively. (f) The Plaintiff’s claim for the loss of damage arising out of the Collision has not been satisfied and it has also not obtained security for the claim. (g) On 30 April 2021, the Defendant had applied to the Qingdao Court to establish the SJ Limitation Fund and the Qingdao Court had approved the constitution of that fund on 12 July 2021. The total funds paid into court was RMB 39,536,501 (or approximately US$ 6,088,500); (h) On 27 July 2021, the Plaintiff had registered its claims against the SJ Limitation Fund and sought a declaration that they are entitled to the claim against that fund, albeit with a reservation of rights; and (i) There was nothing preventing the Plaintiff from bringing a suit anywhere else other than the PRC in light of the Defendant’s unsuccessful ASI Application.",
        "Parties’ arguments": "131 As a preliminary matter, I note that the Defendant has not challenged thein remjurisdiction which the Plaintiff had relied on when applying for the warrant of arrest. 132 The crux of the Defendant’s submission in respect of Material Fact 1 is the Plaintiff’s misrepresentation to the Duty Registrar that the Plaintiff had reserved its right to challenge the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court when it did not in fact do so. At the hearing, the Plaintiff’s counsel presented to the Duty Registrar its application for a warrant of arrest and a supporting affidavit which was made under the cover of a solicitor’s affidavit.59Foot Note 59×2nd Affidavit of Liao Yanting.At paragraphs 20 and 21 of the said affidavit, the Plaintiff stated that on 27 July 2021, it had applied to register a claim against the SJ Limitation Fund in the Qingdao Court and the application was made with a strict reservations of rights. It then quotes the relevant portion of the application to show this which is as follows: [t]his Application for Registration of Claim is a procedural application made in response to the application from Sea Justice Ltd for the constitution of a limitation fund for maritime claims. The Applicant hereby declares that all the matters described herein or referred heretoshall not be construed as the Applicant’s acknowledgement of any facts or liabilities, or acceptance of jurisdiction of your court or application of law, or waiver of any substantial or proceduraldefenses. The Applicant also reserves the right to object to the right of the Respondent to limit its liabilities and the limitation amounts. [emphasis in original] 133 It subsequently transpired (and this is undisputed by parties) that the words “or acceptance of jurisdiction of your court or application of law” [emphasis in original] (collectively referred to as the “Missing Words”) was never on the said application. The Plaintiff explained that translator it had engaged had made a mistake and that these words were included inadvertently. Further, that they only knew of this error in December 2022. 134 The Defendant submits that the inclusion of the Missing Words was a “deliberate attempt to portray to this Honourable Court that the Plaintiff has not accepted or submitted to the jurisdiction of the Chinese Courts”. Further, they highlight the fact that even though the Plaintiff claimed to have found out about the mistake in December 2022, they said or did nothing. It was only after the discrepancy was pointed out vide an affidavit by one of the Defendant’s PRC lawyers filed on 18 January 202360Foot Note 60×1st Affidavit of Yu Changqing.that the Plaintiff filed an affidavit on 25 January 202361Foot Note 61×4th Affidavit of Liao Yanting.in response acknowledging the discrepancy. 135 In response, the Plaintiff submits that even without the Missing Words, the application should still be construed as one which was made with a strict reservation of rights as to jurisdiction. This is because the reservation of rights, without the Missing Words, allowed the Plaintiff to raise a “procedural defence”. According to Prof Chu, the Plaintiff may challenge the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court and choose not to submit to it by making a “procedural defence” under Chinese law.62Foot Note 62×1st Affidavit of Chu Beipeing; Expert Opinion at [37] to [41].Prof Chu made two further points. 136 First, even if an express reservation of jurisdiction was included in the Plaintiff’s application to register its claim against the SJ Limitation Fund, it remains unclear under Chinese procedural law what legal effect that has on the exclusion of a foreign court from exercising jurisdiction based on its own laws.63Foot Note 63×1st Affidavit of Chu Beipeing; Expert Opinion at [40].Second, the Plaintiff’s application to register its claim against the SJ Limitation Fund does not constitute submitting to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court.64Foot Note 64×1st Affidavit of Chu Beipeing; Expert Opinion at [38].",
        "Issue 3: Whether the security should be returned to the Defendant": "146 As I have decided not to set aside the warrant of arrest, it remains for me to determine whether (a) the two partial securities furnished to the Plaintiff in exchange for the release of the “Sea Justice” should be returned to the Defendant, and (b) in the alternative, the Court should grant a case management stay or a conditional stay on the terms proposed by the Plaintiff.",
        "Security should be returned to the Defendant": "147 In my judgment, granting the Stay Application necessarily requires that the security should be returned to the Defendant, as there would no longer be a basis for maintaining the security in Singapore without a pending claim against the Defendant in this jurisdiction. 148 As a starting point, the UK Court of Appeal inThe“Putbus”[1969] P 136 (“ThePutbus”) ruled that a shipowner, having limited his liability by constituting a limitation fund to answer collision claims, should not be compelled to put up further security in another country for the same collision claims. The following extract at 149E is apposite: “…If a ship is involved in a collision in circumstances to which the owner is entitled to limit his liability, then he should only be compelled to provide a limitation fund once and for all. If he makes it available in one country to meet all the limited claims, he should not be compelled to put up security for those claims in another country: or if he is compelled to do so, he should be able to get the additional security released…” 149 This is consistent with the position in Singapore. InThe Ever Glory, the court endorsed the starting position that a limitation decree not set aside is good against the world (at [44]): Sheen J inTheFalstria[1988] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 495 at 497 explained that “[t]he essence of a limitation action is that the plaintiffs in that action seek a decree, which is valid against all possible claimants, that a limit is set upon the eventual liability of the plaintiffs to all those claimants.”A limitation decree not set aside, as was the case here, is good against the world: SeeTheVolvox Hollandia[1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 361;The Happy Fellow. [Emphasis added] 150 In the present case, the SJ Limitation Fund has not been set aside and is good against the world. Further, as I had explained above (at [117]–[120]), the Defendant retains the inalienable right to choose the forum to limit its liability. To allow the security to be retained in Singapore is to allow the Plaintiff to usurp the Defendant’s choice of forum for its limitation action. As such, upon the Stay Application being granted, the security ought to be returned to the Defendant in full.",
        "A case management stay or conditional stay should not be granted": "151 The Plaintiff had suggested a form of a case management stay or a conditional stay to be imposed should this Court take the view that the issue of liability and damages should dealt with by the Qingdao Court. I disagree. Ordering a case management stay or conditional stay is, in substance, allowing the Plaintiff to be doubly secured, which goes against international comity and should not be allowed. 152 The Plaintiff relied onSpiliada, specifically where the court there held that a plaintiff should not be deprived the benefit of security in a country, even though proceedings should be stayed on the ground offorum nonconveniens,to do “practical justice” by the plaintiff. In my view,Spiliadacan be distinguished. 153 Lord Goff of Chieveley was writing inobiter dicta,and in any case,TheReecon Wolfshowed that the tide has turned against this “practical justice” approach. Belinda Ang J inTheReecon Wolfat [37] noted the turn from judicial chauvinism towards judicial comity, which based on the force of case law and public policy, should prevail in this case. 154 Even though the Plaintiff has argued at lengths that there is no double security as the SJ Limitation Fund in the PRC was constituted pursuant to a domestic decree, respectfully, that argument misses the point. To allow the security to subsist in Singapore would effectively allow the Plaintiff to be doubly secured in Singapore and the PRC. 155 Similar to what I explained above (at [118]) regardingThe Ever GloryandThe Bramley Moore,allowing the Plaintiff to maintain its security in Singapore and claim against it at a later date would go against considerations of comity. By ordering that security be maintained here, it would be tantamount to making a finding that the legislative provisions in the PRC – which it had every sovereign entitlement to enact – were inadequate in comparison with our local legislation. 156 This is the exact situation thatTheReecon Wolfforesaw, and the court very prudently closed the door on such situations (seeThe Ever Gloryat [62]). Quoting the decision of GP Selvam J inThe Herceg Novi(unreported decision dated 10 September 1998 in Admiralty in Rem No. 514 of 1996) with approval, the Court cannot stay an action legitimately brought before it on the ground that there is “something wanting in its system of justice and that better justice will be done in another jurisdiction”. 157 Applying this to the present case, where the PRC legislature had deemed it just to impose a regime that provided for a lower limitation as compared to Singapore, the Singapore court must give effect to that legislation. The merits of that legislation cannot be justiciable before this court.",
        "Indemnity for oil pollution": "158 For completeness, the Plaintiff argued that it is unclear whether indemnity for oil pollution, which makes up the bulk of their claim in damages against the Defendant, should fall within the limitation fund. They submit that if it does not, they should be allowed to come to Singapore to claim against the local security for this. 159 Again, the issue is whether the Plaintiff would be doubly secured. In my view, they would be, and this should not be allowed. Furthermore, they have not discharged their burden of proving that these claims are not subject to the SJ Limitation Fund in the PRC; their argument, without the requisite evidence, was speculative at best. In any case, they have already registered this claim against the SJ Limitation Fund.",
        "Conclusion": "160 In conclusion, as (a) the PRC is the natural forum, (b) that legal proceedings have commenced by both parties in the Qingdao Court and are in a more advanced stage than proceedings in the Singapore Courts which include the constitution of two limitation funds, (c) that there would be a risk of multiplicity of proceedings which would offend the principle of international comity since parties remain resolute in litigating their claims filed before the Qingdao Court, and (d) that the Plaintiff having to return the security is not a juridical advantage it would lose, I find that the Qingdao Court is “clearly or distinctly more appropriate” a forum for this case to be tried. I therefore order that the present proceedings be stayed unconditionally. 161 Further, as I have also found that the non-disclosures by the Plaintiff were, although relevant, were immaterial, I dismiss the Defendant’s application to set aside the warrant of arrest. 162 Finally, I am of the view that the security should be returned to the Defendant in full and that no case management stay in the terms proposed by the Plaintiff ought to be granted. 163 It leaves me to thank counsel from both sides for their arduous work, both written and oral, from which I greatly benefitted from.   Nicholas Lai Assistant Registrar     Timothy Tan, Gho Sze Kee and Liao Yanting (AsiaLegal LLC) for the Plaintiff; Tan Xue Ting, C Sivah and Loh Wai Yue (Incisive Law LLC) for the Defendant."
