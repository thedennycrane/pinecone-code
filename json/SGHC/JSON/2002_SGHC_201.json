        "The facts": "1.        Fu Hai Construction Pte\n\nLtd (the plaintiffs) were incorporated in Singapore on 31 August 1998 as building\n\ncontractors. The plaintiffs' managing-director is one Qiu Chang Hai (Qiu) who is a\n\nmainland Chinese national with permanent residence status in Singapore. Econ Corporation\n\nLimited (the defendants) are also in the construction business and it is one of many\n\nsubsidiaries of, Econ International Limited, which is a public listed company in\n\nSingapore. The defendants are more diverse than the plaintiffs in their activities; they\n\nnot only construct buildings but also build sewerage treatment plants, roads, mass rapid\n\ntransit (MRT) stations and carry out land reclamation works at Southern Islands.2.        Sometime in late November\n\nor early December 2000, their ex-employee (chief designer) Dr Jeffrey Wang (Wang) offered\n\nto introduce Qiu to the defendants. The defendants were then looking for a subcontractor\n\nfor a project. Qiu indicated his interest which Wang duly conveyed to T C Chua, the\n\ndefendants' director of construction. As a result, Qiu met up with Ms Sim Peck Hoon (Sim)\n\nand Lai Leong Chong (Lai) the assistant contracts manager and senior projects manager\n\nrespectively, of the defendants.3.        According to Qiu, he was\n\ninformed by Sim/Lai that the defendants had been awarded a contract for $13,717,986.05\n\n(the contract sum) by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) for construction of Punggol\n\nEast contract 23 shopping centre cum branch office (the project) and the defendants would\n\nconsider appointing the plaintiffs as their subcontractor for the same. Qiu alleged that\n\nat the meeting (which took place on or about 5 December 2000), the following\n\nrepresentations were made to him if the plaintiffs agreed to be the main subcontractor for\n\nthe project:i. there would be three (3) omissions from the contract sum namely, (i)\n\n    the M&E works of the value of $4,618,097.64; (ii) the supply of materials for\n\n    concreting works (but the plaintiffs would provide labour and ancillaries); (iii) the\n\n    supply of pre-cast items. The plaintiffs would be the subcontractor for the balance works\n\n    in the sum of $5,340,906.23;ii. the contract period was two (2) years from 3 August 2000 to 2\n\n    August 2002 and the balance 20 months (from January 2001) were more than sufficient for\n\n    the project, which was not too big/difficult to complete;iii. the soil condition was normal and there was nothing difficult\n\n    about excavation although substantial excavation was involved in relation to the basement\n\n    for the shopping centre (which occupied a large portion of the project site);iv. there were no adverse or unusual factors which would require the\n\n    plaintiffs to expend money, effort, manpower or equipment that would likely result in the\n\n    plaintiffs being subject to the penalty of liquidated damages for delay;v. the defendants would support the plaintiffs' request for 250 foreign\n\n    workers (from China) but would only assist the plaintiffs to apply for 180 foreign workers\n\n    initially, leaving the balance 70 for later consideration.4.        Qiu further alleged that\n\nhis request for an increase of $500,000 in the subcontract sum was rejected; he was told\n\nthe defendants had themselves under-provided for M&E works (at $4.618m) when they\n\ntendered for the project and would incur a loss as a result of overruns ($5.1m) in\n\nexpenditure for that item.5.        On or about 19 December\n\n2000, Qiu was handed a contract by the defendants for his signature. Qiu (who is not\n\nliterate in English) was told by his staff that the contract stated:a. the contract was a lump sum contract at the price of $5,443,524.23\n\n    (the subcontract sum);b. the scope of works was not spelt out but was referred to in an\n\n    annexure which was not attached;c. the plaintiffs were to supply labour (and tools) for all structural\n\n    works and supply labour, tools and materials for the completion of architectural and\n\n    external works;d. the plaintiffs were required to deposit a performance bond with the\n\n    defendants within 14 days, in the sum of $1,371,798.60;e. the plaintiffs were deemed to have knowledge of the defendants' main\n\n    contract with HDB as well as of the defendants' construction schedule; andf. the plaintiffs would not assign or subcontract out the works under\n\n    the subcontract.6.        Qiu eventually refused to\n\nprovide the performance bond requested which, based on $5,443,524.23, amounted to 25%\n\nthereof; he was aware that the standard performance bond was for 10% of the contract sum.\n\nIn February 2001, the defendants agreed to reduce the performance bond from the plaintiffs\n\nto 10% ($544,353) of the subcontract sum; the same was provided on 15 February 2001 by Tai\n\nPing Insurance Co Ltd (Tai Ping). The plaintiffs then signed the (revised) subcontract\n\n(the subcontract) with the defendants on 28 February 2001. However, even prior thereto (on\n\n30 January 2001), the plaintiffs' representatives had attended the first site meeting with\n\nrepresentatives of the defendants. Indeed, by 28 February 2001, the plaintiffs had\n\napparently attended four (4) site meetings.7.        Qiu alleged that the\n\ndefendants breached the representations set out in para 3 above. He realised (on\n\nhindsight) that the defendants had made scapegoats of his company as, the defendants\n\nthemselves (inter alia), could not have completed the contract within the completion\n\nperiod of two (2) years. The defendants countered that the plaintiffs failed to carry out\n\nthe subcontract works regularly and diligently in particular the excavation works (which\n\nshould have been completed by 27 February 2001), despite numerous reminders. Consequently,\n\nafter giving the plaintiffs three (3) days' notice by their letter dated 18 May 2001, the\n\ndefendants terminated the plaintiffs' contract on 23 May 2001.",
        "The pleadings": "8.        In the statement of claim,\n\nthe plaintiffs pleaded that the representations set out in para 3 above were breached by\n\nthe defendants. The plaintiffs further alleged that the defendants purported to hold the\n\nplaintiffs responsible for the delay in works by a letter dated 27 February 2001, evenbeforethe plaintiffs had signed the subcontract. The plaintiffs cited numerous instances of the\n\ndefendants' breach of the terms of the subcontract. There was also an allegation that the\n\ndefendants deliberately concealed a soil report prepared by their subsidiary ECON GEOTECH\n\nPte Ltd (ECON GEOTECH) dated 9 September 1999 which showed that the soil conditions\n\ncontained backfill (of rubbish) of 6-9m, contrary to the defendants' representation that\n\nthe soil condition was not unusual; soil (and dumping of the excavated rubbish) was a\n\nmajor factor which resulted in delays to the project and caused the plaintiffs to be\n\nsubjected to the penalty of liquidated damages. Delay was compounded by the defendants'\n\nfailure to provide the plaintiffs with 180 foreign workers and by the late supply of shop\n\ndrawings. In addition, the plaintiffs discovered inter alia, three (3) other\n\nsubcontractors on site doing bored and soldier piles and excavations which works were\n\nwithin the scope of the subcontract. The defendants also failed to pay the plaintiffs on\n\ntheir first and second progress claims (submitted in March and April 2001) promptly or at\n\nall.9.        The plaintiffs alleged\n\nthat the defendants wrongfully terminated the subcontract on or about 23 May 2001 and took\n\npossession of the site. Further, on or about 25 July 2001, the defendants wrongfully\n\ncalled on the performance bond by making a demand on Tai Ping. The plaintiffs prayed inter\n\nalia for, a rescission of the subcontract, cancellation of the performance bond and or\n\ndamages pursuant to s 2 of the Misrepresentation Act Cap 390.10.        In the defence filed, the\n\ndefendants admitted they had informed Qiu/the plaintiffs of certain omissions from the\n\nmain contract and that the subcontract was in the sum of $5,443,524.23; they also admitted\n\nreceiving a performance bond for $544,353. However, the defendants denied they had made\n\nthe representations set out in para 3(i) to (iv). As for the representation alleged in\n\npara 3(v), the defendants averred that they had only agreed to support/assist the\n\nplaintiffs' application for 180 foreign workers in consideration of the plaintiffs\n\nfurnishing a bond of $2,000/- for each foreign worker (which the plaintiffs did not). If\n\nthe representations as alleged were made, the defendants denied they were made with the\n\nintention of inducing the plaintiffs to enter into the subcontract. The defendants\n\ncontended that the plaintiffs could not have been induced by the alleged representations\n\nas, the plaintiffs attended site meetings/inspections and could have ascertained for\n\nthemselves the scope/nature of the subcontract works. The plaintiffs were therefore aware\n\nof the presence of other subcontractors on site and the nature of the works they carried\n\nout.11.        The defendants admitted\n\nreceiving the plaintiffs' first and second progress claims but denied the plaintiffs were\n\nentitled to any payment thereon. They also admitted they had given notice of termination\n\nof the subcontract on 23 May 2001 and had demanded payment (on 25 July 2001) from Tai Ping\n\non the performance bond. The defendants counter-claimed against the plaintiffs for the\n\nadditional costs ($752,665.79) they incurred in re-awarding the subcontract to other\n\nsubcontractors to complete the works.12.        I should point out that\n\nthe plaintiffs obtained from this court an exparte injunction on 22 August 2001, to\n\nrestrain the defendants from calling on Tai Ping for payment on the performance bond; the\n\ndefendants failed in their subsequent application to discharge the injunction.",
        "The evidence": "(i)        the plaintiffs' case13.        Qiu was the plaintiffs'\n\nonly witness; I shall now consider his evidence, some portions of which have already been\n\nset out in earlier paragraphs. I should at this stage point out that apart from a bare\n\nstatement in his affidavit (para 8.3) that he was familiar with HDB contracts, Qiu did not\n\nexpand on his/the plaintiffs' experience with HDB contracts nor did he give details of\n\nwhat jobs the plaintiffs had previously undertaken. It was only in cross-examination that\n\nhe revealed the plaintiffs had undertaken HDB projects previously as a subcontractor but\n\nagain gave no details; neither did he volunteer any details as to his own background. As\n\nthe plaintiffs were only incorporated on 31 August 1998, they could not in any event have\n\nhad that much experience in the 2 year interval between their date of incorporation and\n\nthe project, bearing in mind the slump in the construction industry in recent years.14.        In his written testimony,\n\nQiu expanded on how the plaintiffs had acted on the defendants' representations to their\n\ndetriment. On the first and second representations (omissions from and the value of, the\n\nsubcontract), Qiu alleged that he was shown a set of drawings and asked by the defendants\n\n(Sim and Lai) if the plaintiffs would agree to a lump sum of about $5.4m to carry out the\n\nworks reflected in those drawings. Qiu calculated that $5.4m was equivalent to the balance\n\nof the contract less the three (3) items omitted, without factoring in the cost ($500,000)\n\nof supplying labour for concreting works, which works Qiu estimated would cost about\n\n$3.54m. As far as the plaintiffs were concerned, it was their prerogative whether they\n\nwished to subcontract out any of the works in the subcontract or do the works themselves.\n\nHowever, when the plaintiffs came onto the site, they found other subcontractors doing\n\nworks which werewithinthe plaintiffs' scope of works. For these subcontracted\n\nworks (bored/soldier piles, instrumentation, erection of site office and excavations)\n\nwhich were carried out without the plaintiffs' consent, the plaintiffs were entitled to\n\npayment from the defendants (inclusive of 15% for profit and attendance) and in turn the\n\nplaintiffs would pay the defendants' subcontractors. However, the defendants not only did\n\nnot pay the plaintiffs their two (2) progress payments in that regard but went further to\n\ndeduct from the plaintiffs' subcontract, the price for the works carried out by the\n\ndefendants' subcontractors.15.        On the second\n\nrepresentation, Qiu explained that as the plaintiffs' contract period would be four (4)\n\nmonths less than the defendants' 24 months from the HDB, it was essential that the\n\nplaintiffs were apprised of any problems which could affect the plaintiffs' ability to\n\ncomplete the project within 20 months, especially when the plaintiffs were liable for\n\nliquidated damages in the event of delay. Instead of the initial impression given to the\n\nplaintiffs that they would have sufficient time to complete the project, the defendants\n\ntook the view from the start after the subcontract was signed, that the plaintiffs were\n\nlate in executing the works under the subcontract. Unbeknownst to the plaintiffs, the\n\ndefendants were already behind schedule for the project and had received written warnings\n\n(3) in that regard from HDB. Had the plaintiffs known of these warnings Qiu testified,\n\nthey would not have accepted the subcontract.16.        As for the third\n\nrepresentation, Qiu testified that soon after (on 23 March 2001) the plaintiffs'\n\nsubcontractor had commenced excavating the basement for the shopping centre, it was\n\ndiscovered that the soil contained backfill of 6-9m which comprised of rubbish. Although\n\nexcavating the rubbish was not a problem, disposal was – there were no dumping\n\ngrounds for the rubbish and the more the plaintiffs excavated, the more the rubbish\n\naccumulated. Eventually, the plaintiffs (in April/May 2001) were given permission to\n\ntemporarily store the rubbish on nearby state land; the permission was subsequently\n\nrevoked and the problem of disposal arose once again. When Qiu obtained (in April 2001) a\n\ncopy of the soil report dated 9 September 1999 by ECON GEOTECH (see 1AB74-108), he\n\ndiscovered that all the boreholes revealed backfill of 6-9m in depth, contrary to the\n\ndefendants' representation that there was nothing unusual about the soil. The report was\n\nin the possession of the defendants at all material times but they never gave it to the\n\nplaintiffs.17.        On the fourth\n\nrepresentation, Qiu testified the plaintiffs were only offered a full set of drawings on\n\n27 February 2001, one day before they signed the subcontract. On 7 March 2001, Qiu said he\n\nwas surprised to receive a letter from the defendants requiring the plaintiffs to produce\n\nshop drawings for six (6) items (including skylight and glazier), which responsibility he\n\nasserted was that of the defendants, not the plaintiffs.18.        In regard to the\n\nfifth/last representation, Qiu testified that the plaintiffs' representatives requested\n\nthe defendants in April 2001 to let the plaintiffs have their Man Year Entitlement for 180\n\nforeign workers. Despite several reminders from him and their assurance that they would so\n\nprovide, Qiu claimed that the defendants did not give the plaintiffs the man years\n\nentitlement for 180 foreign workers.19.        As this item has a\n\nsignificant impact on my findings, more need to be said about this alleged representation\n\nand Qiu's testimony in this regard. Under cross-examination, Qiu admitted quite candidly\n\nthat the defendants' initial agreement to allocate 180 foreign workers to the plaintiffs\n\nparticularly from mainland China, was the factor which prompted him to enter into the\n\nsubcontract.20.        Under the foreign\n\nworkers' scheme implemented by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), all building\n\ncontractors/developers (who rely essentially on skilled/unskilled foreign workers) are\n\ngiven a quota of the number of foreign workers they can bring into Singapore; this is\n\nbased on the value of the contracts/projects pursuant to which the contractors/developers\n\napply for such workers. Apparently, the higher the value of the projects, the higher the\n\nquota the foreign workers allocated by MOM.21.        Cross-examined, Qiu\n\nrevealed that mainland Chinese construction workers in Singapore pay (through their\n\nrecruitment agency) to their employers between $6,000 to $8,000 each. Consequently, for\n\n200 Chinese workers, an employer could receive upfront between $1.2m to $1.6m, which sums\n\nQiu acknowledged were very good profits indeed, more so if there were 250 workers, which\n\nwas the number he had requested of the defendants. Qiu further revealed that he had\n\ncounted on receiving such sums for the initial funding of the project until the plaintiffs\n\nreceived progress payments from the defendants. Further, had the defendants given him 250\n\nworkers, he would have arranged for two (2) shifts of workers in June 2001 to complete the\n\nwork. Questioned, Qiu admitted that he did not provide (under cl 14.3 of the subcontract)\n\nletters of guarantee to indemnify the defendants at $2,000 per worker; he said no approval\n\nhad yet been given by MOM without which (he claimed) insurance companies would not provide\n\nthe security bond. However, he also admitted that the defendants signed the form (1A)\n\nwhich would have enabled the plaintiffs to apply to MOM for 50 foreign workers, even\n\nthough the plaintiffs did not provide the security bond of $100,000 ($2,000 x 50) for\n\nthem; he offered no explanation why the plaintiffs did not submit the form to MOM.22.        Further cross-examination\n\nof Qiu extracted the following evidence:-(i) the plaintiffs did not/never provided the defendants with any work\n\n    schedule (although they had one for their own use) despite having been requested to do so\n\n    since the first site meeting. It was the defendants who provided the work schedules\n\n    produced in court (see 2AB481-483 and 2AB477-480) to the plaintiffs, which however, he did\n\n    not accept;(ii) although he claimed his company had experience in doing such works\n\n    for the HDB, the plaintiffs subcontracted out the excavations (at $580,000 against the\n\n    plaintiffs' price of $412,851.28 from the defendants). He admitted that the plaintiffs\n\n    were sued (in DC Suit No. 3111 of 2001) by System Holdings Pte Ltd who obtained judgment\n\n    in the sum of $180,000 (not including interest and costs) for carrying out the excavations\n\n    works and for the plaintiffs' breach of contract (in subcontracting those works to yet\n\n    another subcontractor);(iii) he did not learn about the soil condition untilafterhis\n\n    subcontractor had commenced excavations and had requested him to obtain a soil report from\n\n    the defendants; he denied being given a copy of the soil report by the defendants at their\n\n    first meeting on 5 December 2000. However, he was aware that HDB had provided a soil\n\n    report to all prospective tenderers (including the defendants) to enable them to come up\n\n    with their tenders for the project;(iv) he maintained that the defendants knew there was rubbish in the\n\n    soil as, they had completed 70-80% of the piling works before the plaintiffs signed the\n\n    contract. However Qiu admitted that the plaintiffs themselves had written to the\n\n    defendants on 11 April 2001 (see 2AB81) stating that'the excavated earth is full of\n\n    debris' which problem was unforeseeable'while looking through the soil report';(v) he admitted that as at 18 April 2001 (see minutes at 2AB121), the\n\n    defendants were pressing the plaintiffs to put more workers on site as work was very much\n\n    behind schedule — strutting works (which should be in tandem with excavations) had\n\n    not commenced, there were only 7 workers on site, huge quantities of excavated materials\n\n    were not removed and, excavation works had stopped;(vi) he eventually found a dumping ground for the excavated soil but\n\n    not the rubbish. Hence, the rubbish was dumped on the state land next to the site, as a\n\n    temporary measure until a proper dumping ground could be found, which the plaintiffs never\n\n    did find;(vii) in February 2001, the plaintiffs requested the defendants' help\n\n    as they had difficulties in obtaining supplies of timber and in April 2001, they requested\n\n    the defendants for permission to use the defendants' name to place orders for materials\n\n    and to rent machines. However, he denied the plaintiffs did not have enough resources to\n\n    perform the subcontract;(viii) he admitted that at the first meeting with the defendants, he\n\n    was informed the project had been on-going for four (4) months;(ix) he explained that although the defendants had carried out the\n\n    piling works by the time the plaintiffs took on the project, he nonetheless included\n\n    piling works ($1,346,327) in the plaintiffs' first progress claim because it was within\n\n    the plaintiffs' scope of works under the subcontract and, they were entitled to profit and\n\n    attendance for supervision of these items (although not stated in the subcontract);(x) temporary works (soldier piles) were done by Zap Piling Pte Ltd\n\n    (Zap Piling), instrumentation (calibration) was carried out by AL Technologies (S) Pte Ltd\n\n    (AL Technologies) but the plaintiffs charged for both items in the first progress claim,\n\n    for the same reason;(xi) despite the requirement in cl 15 of the subcontract (that progress\n\n    claims must be accompanied by measurement records and or delivery orders duly endorsed by\n\n    the defendants' authorised site staff), the plaintiffs did not submit such documents with\n\n    their progress claims;(xii) out of the total claim of $1,430,071.64, the only item\n\n    ($12,385.54) of work in the plaintiffs' first progress claim which they actually carried\n\n    out was excavation;(xiii) he admitted the site office was not erected by the plaintiffs\n\n    but by Cape Engineering Construction Pte Ltd (Cape Engineering) for which the defendants\n\n    were entitled to backcharge the plaintiffs as minuted in site meetings;(xiv) claimed the plaintiffs could not manage the site properly because\n\n    the defendants did not accede to the plaintiffs' request to call all subcontractors for\n\n    site meetings to ensure proper co-ordination of works;(xv) claimed the defendants did not give the plaintiffs the requisite\n\n    three (3) days' notice under cl 17.2 of the subcontractbeforethey terminated the\n\n    contract by their letter dated 18 May 2001; he received the said letter on 19 May 2001\n\n    whereas on 16/17 May 2001, the defendants had told him at a meeting to stop work\n\n    immediately. However, he admitted that earlier (on 15 May 2001) the defendants had already\n\n    warned the plaintiffs' project manager of the plaintiffs' shortcomings/slow progress and\n\n    the defendants' subsequent letter dated 21 May 2001 (2AB320) confirmed that their earlier\n\n    notice dated 18 May 2001 remained valid. Qiu blamed the rainy weather for the plaintiffs'\n\n    slow progress of work;(xvi) admitted that the performance bond was a demand bond regardless\n\n    of any dispute between the plaintiffs and the defendants.23.        In re-examination, Qiu\n\ntestified that had he known that the defendants would not pay the plaintiffs anything for\n\nthe works done by Zap Piling and AL Technologies, he would not have signed the\n\nsubcontract. Their presence on site was also a factor which slowed the plaintiffs'\n\nprogress because the site was small and Zap Piling had a lot of equipment on site. The\n\nplaintiffs on their part needed to have three (3) excavators and more than ten (10) trucks\n\non site. He said the plaintiffs would have applied for an extension of time in April-May\n\n2001, relying on the soil condition as the main reason. Indeed, the defendants themselves\n\napplied to HDB for extension of time (seeD1) in September 2001 (and succeeded),\n\nciting the'quick sand like'soil as the reason.",
        "The defendants' case": "24.        The defendants called two\n\n(2) witnesses to refute Qiu's evidence, the first was Sim who is a qualified quantity\n\nsurveyor. Sim (DW1) only became involved in the project after the HDB awarded the\n\ndefendants the contract on 3 April 2000; she said works commenced on 3 August 2000,\n\nstarting with bored piles (about 300 pieces) by the defendants' geotechnic division, which\n\nwork was completed on 9 February 2001.25.        In her written testimony,\n\nSim explained that before the plaintiffs were appointed the defendants' main\n\nsubcontractor, the defendants had many subcontractors on site including Zap Piling, AL\n\nTechnologies, Cape Engineering, Lee Welded Mesh Singapore Pte Ltd (Lee Welded), Hor Kew\n\nPte Ltd, Supermix Concrete Pte Ltd and Hoe Seng Huat Hardware Co Pte Ltd.26.        When the plaintiffs\n\napproached the defendants through Wang to do the project, she had prepared (on the\n\ninstructions of T C Chua) a general budget for the proposed main subcontracting contract,\n\nwhich she handed to Wang. As neither party chose to call Wang as a witness although his\n\nevidence would have been material, it serves no purpose to speculate whether Wang in turn\n\nhanded the general budget to Qiu or what he said to Qiu in that regard. Neither did the\n\ndefendants call T C Chua to testify. Sim explained that the general budget only provided a\n\nbroad overview of the components of work required to complete the project (including the\n\nbored piling then in progress), the subcontractors already appointed, as well as the\n\naggregate costs the defendants were prepared to incur until completion. It was onlyafterT C Chua received Wang's telephone confirmation of the plaintiffs' interest in taking on\n\nthe project and she was asked by T C Chua to attend a meeting with Qiu, that she prepared\n\na proper budget which expanded on the earlier general budget. The previous general budget\n\nfor $13,717,986.05 comprised the following breakdown:-1.Piling works$1,923,324.282.Temporary works685,794.363.Excavations412,851.284.Concrete works3,545,142.075.Waterproofing to basement117,420.496.Instrumentation27,796.627.Structural steel29,322.958.Precast items213,840.119.Architectural works1,747,672.4910.M & E works4,618,097.6411.External works396,723.76Total subcontract for C23:$13,717,986.0527.        At that meeting with Qiu\n\non 5 December 2000, Sim said she presented the proper budget for discussion. As compared\n\nwith the earlier general budget, Sim said it should have been obvious to anyone that the\n\nresiduary value of the contract (less the work for the various subcontractors and less\n\nbored piling) was very much less than the contract sum (see 1AB2) stated in the general\n\nbudget. The residuary value ($5,443,524.23) which would form the plaintiffs' subcontract\n\nis arrived at as follows:-General budget sum$13,717,986.05Less:Materials$3,017,097.94Precast items239,102.00M & E works5,018,261.88($ 8,274,461.82)Residuary value:$ 5,443,524.23Sim pointed out that in accepting the subcontract, the plaintiffs\n\nshould have been prepared to manage and supervise the work of the other subcontracts\n\nalready appointed and, should have realised that the value of whose works would be\n\nbackcharged to the plaintiffs and deducted from the subcontract sum. She claimed she had\n\nreminded Qiu that the works had commenced since August 2000. Qiu apparently had told her\n\nhe had vast experience in HDB projects but, Sim warned him that this was no ordinary HDB\n\nproject but, a shopping centre with a basement. Sim had also rejected Qiu's request that\n\nthe defendants improve on the subcontract sum (by $500,000). She explained that the\n\ndefendants themselves had a tight budget as their tender to HDB was $6m lower than the\n\nnext lowest tender. Even if Qiu did not understand the difference between the general\n\nbudget and the residuary value, Sim deposed that at a meeting she attended (in late April\n\n2001) with Qiu and other representatives from the plaintiffs, she had reminded Qiu of the\n\nresiduary value for the subcontract. He did not protest but turned his attention to man\n\nyear entitlements asking the defendants for 250 workers.28.        Sim had also told Qiu\n\nthat the plaintiffs must provide a performance bond of 10% of the contract sum even though\n\nthe actual residuary value of the subcontract was $5,443,524.23. When Qiu asked for man\n\nyear entitlements, she had told him that the defendants were amenable to give the\n\nplaintiffs their balance quota (180) of man year entitlements provided the plaintiffs\n\nfurnish a bond/guarantee of $2,000 for each worker. Sim deposed she had extended to Qiu\n\ndocuments which included the main contract with HDB, the soil report given by HDB,\n\ndrawings and plans and advised him to study them carefully before making his decision. Qiu\n\nhad subsequently reverted (on or about 12 December 2000) to say he was interested and\n\ncould work within the general budget sum and residuary value of the contract; he then\n\nasked for a letter of award which she prepared. She told him to get someone conversant in\n\nEnglish and Mandarin to explain the subcontract terms to him, when the subcontract\n\nagreement was subsequently prepared.29.        Qiu told the defendants\n\nhe was unable to provide a performance bond at 10% ($1,371,798.60) of the contract sum.\n\nConsequently, towards end January 2001, the defendants agreed to reduce the amount to 10%\n\n($544,353) of the residuary value of the subcontract. Although the subcontract was only\n\nsigned on 28 February 2001, Sim said she considered the subcontract a'done deal'as, the plaintiffs had prepared their detailed work schedule on or about 5 January 2001\n\nand had attended site meetings commencing 31 January 2001.30.        Sim denied that the\n\ndefendants had made misrepresentations and or fraudulent misrepresentations to the\n\nplaintiffs. She pointed out that negotiations and discussions were conducted in Mandarin;\n\nhence, Qiu could not use the excuse he did not understand what transpired. As regards the\n\nalleged second representation, she had made it clear to Qiu that four (4) months of the\n\ncontract period had lapsed, since the defendants' commencement of the project. The alleged\n\nthird representation was not sustainable either as, she had given Qiu a copy of HDB's soil\n\nreport which did not suggest rubbish in the backfill.31.        As for the plaintiffs'\n\nfirst progress payment, Sim explained that it included works not carried out by the\n\nplaintiffs (bored piles and instrumentation); hence these items had to be deducted or\n\nbackcharged to the plaintiffs. The only item in the claim attributable to the plaintiffs\n\nwas excavations which sum of $12,385.54 was valued at $8,257.03 by the defendants.\n\nHowever, the plaintiffs were not paid at all because of deductions totalling $1,463,340.15\n\nfor works done by Zap Piling, AL Technologies and the defendants' geotechnic division.32.        Similarly, the only item\n\nattributable to the plaintiffs in the second progress claim ($1,612,900.58 at 2AB63) was\n\n$41,285.13 for excavations. Like the first progress claim, the defendants did not pay the\n\nplaintiffs any sum because the deductions of $1,556,218.60 far exceeded the plaintiffs'\n\npayment entitlement. Payment was also withheld because the plaintiffs owed the defendants\n\nthe sum of $100,000/- for the security bond for 50 foreign workers for whom the defendants\n\nhad signed Form 1A [see 2AB552-554] which the plaintiffs for their own reasons failed to\n\nsubmit to MOM for processing. After making all the deductions (including deductions for\n\nrental of equipment and supply of materials to the plaintiffs), not only did the\n\ndefendants not owe any monies to the plaintiffs but the latter in fact owed the defendants\n\n$28,894.11 on the two (2) progress claims.33.        In addition to\n\n$28,894.11, Sim deposed that the plaintiffs were liable to the defendants for liquidated\n\ndamages for delay and or damages for failing to provide shop drawings for architectural\n\nworks, despite repeated reminders from the defendants/the HDB, over a period of four (4)\n\nmonths.34.        As for excavation works,\n\nSim pointed out that the plaintiffs' own work schedule stated such works would commence on\n\n12 February 2001 and would be completed by 27 February 2001. As early as 6 February 2001,\n\nthe defendants had written to the plaintiffs requiring them to submit the name(s) of their\n\nexcavation subcontractor(s). Despite numerous site meetings however, the plaintiffs failed\n\nto commence excavation works by their own schedule. Moreover, the excavations works when\n\nthey finally started, were unsatisfactory so much so that the defendants were obliged to\n\ncommit their own resources to carry out those works, on or about 26 February 2001. Unless\n\nthe excavation works were completed, other works such as exposing the pile caps could not\n\nproceed.35.        Moving next to the issue\n\nof removing the excavated material, Sim pointed out that it was the plaintiffs'\n\ncontractual responsibility to remove such materials. However, the plaintiffs breached that\n\nduty as they did not have a proper dumping ground for such materials — instead, they\n\ndumped the same on the adjoining State Land despite warnings of the consequences of such\n\nencroachment from the defendants/the HDB. Indeed, the HDB went further and warned the\n\ndefendants that the plaintiffs' slow progress may cause the defendants to be debarred from\n\nfuture public sector projects.36.        Due to their tardiness,\n\nlack of progress and total disregard for their own work schedule, the defendants by their\n\nlatter dated 18 May 2001, gave the plaintiffs three (3) days' notice to proceed with the\n\nworks diligently failing which, notice of termination would be given. The plaintiffs\n\nfailed to respond to the letter and notice of termination was given by the defendants on\n\n23 May 2001. As a consequence of the plaintiffs' breach, the defendants suffered loss and\n\ndamage. Hence, they called on the performance bond which demand for payment was not met by\n\nTai Ping despite three (3) reminders. Ultimately, the defendants were restrained by an\n\norder of court from receiving payment thereon, on an application filed by the plaintiffs.\n\nResulting from the plaintiffs' breach of contract, Sim deposed that the defendants had\n\nsustained losses in excess of $2m.37.        Cross-examined, Sim\n\nrevealed that the defendants did not show to the plaintiffs their contract from the HDB\n\nsave for the specifications; it was a matter of strategy. However, the defendants left a\n\ncopy of their main contract (with pricing omitted) with their architects for\n\nsubcontractors to check if the latter wished to do so. She further revealed that the\n\ndefendants' geotechnic division did the piling works at cost. She agreed that the\n\ndefendants' tender price of $4,618,097.64 for M&E works fell short of what the\n\ndefendants had to pay subcontractors to get the work done — the best price the\n\ndefendants could obtain was $5.1m. In order to cover the shortfall for M&E works, the\n\ndefendants reduced the budget for architectural works by $400,000/- to $1,347,508.25.38.        Sim admitted that by end\n\n2000, the defendants' piling works were 1-2 months behind schedule; she agreed that\n\npiling works are crucial and unless completed, no other construction work can begin. Even\n\nso, the defendants did not apply to the HDB for extension of time. It was much later (in\n\nJanuary 2002), that extension of time was granted by the HDB,but notin relation\n\nto piling works. However, the plaintiffs' subcontract did not contains provisions similar\n\nto the defendants' contact with HDB, for extensions of time. Hence, even if the HDB\n\ngranted extensions of time to the defendants, the plaintiffs would not benefit therefrom;\n\nthe defendants could still hold the plaintiffs to the completion date in the subcontract.39.        Notwithstanding that the\n\nplaintiffs' subcontract excluded piling and M&E works, Sim explained that the\n\ndefendants' management still wanted the plaintiffs to co-ordinate those works,\n\nparticularly on the supply of materials, so as to ensure that all work was completed on\n\nschedule. She denied that the motive was to have another contractor take the blame because\n\npiling works were already delayed. It was similarly on management's (TC Chua's)\n\ninstructions that Sim requested the plaintiffs initially for a performance bond at 10% of\n\nthe contract sum even though it amounted to 25% of the subcontract.40.        Sim maintained that\n\nduring negotiations she had told Qiu three (3) items of work were taken out of the\n\nsubcontract namely: (i) materials ($3.017m); (ii) pre-cast elements ($239,000) and (iii) M\n\n& E works ($5.018m), thereby reducing the plaintiffs' subcontract to the value of\n\n$5.4m. She had also informed him that although bored piling and instrumentation works were\n\ntaken out of the plaintiffs' contract, they were required to co-ordinate the works to\n\nwhich (she claimed), Qiu did not object, before or at any time after, the subcontract was\n\nsigned. In reality however (Sim acknowledged), instrumentation being so highly\n\nspecialised, the plaintiffs were unlikely to be able to interpret the readings in relation\n\nto the soil condition, nor would they have any role to play as regards bored piling. She\n\ndid not deny counsel's suggestion that the motive for including these two (2) items in the\n\nplaintiffs' subcontract was to obtain a higher performance bond from the plaintiffs.41.        In cross-examination Sim\n\nrevealed that she had told Qiu the defendants had 120 not 180, man year entitlements. She\n\ndenied she had agreed to give him 180 initially followed by 70 later, on his request for\n\n250 workers. Qiu and Sam Yong had told her 180 was the minimum figure the plaintiffs could\n\naccept but to her, it was the maximum. She had told Qiu the defendants could only afford\n\nto give him 180 (although her computerised records showed the defendants had 120 left, out\n\nof 370 MOM approved man year entitlements). Sim said she was aware that such entitlement\n\nwas a good source of revenue for local contractors who engage mainland Chinese workers and\n\nwas an important factor to them. However, it was not the defendants' practice to insert a\n\nclause on man year entitlements into their subcontracts. She was also aware that the\n\nplaintiffs raised the issue in their letters to the defendants in April 2001. The\n\ndefendants' practice was to give man year entitlements to subcontractors in batches (but\n\nadmittedly this was not told to Qiu). Hence, in Form 1A which the defendants signed as the\n\nmain contractor to support the plaintiffs' application, the number stated was 50. In any\n\ncase, Qiu had told her/the defendants (sometime in April-May 2001), that the plaintiffs\n\nthemselves had 100-200 workers and hence man year entitlement was not a critical factor,\n\ncontrary to his testimony.42.        Re-examined, Sim\n\nexplained the defendants' rationale for agreeing to give the plaintiffs only 50 foreign\n\nworkers initially – from past experience, the defendants were afraid that if the\n\nplaintiffs were unable to continue with and or to complete, the project, it meant that the\n\nman year entitlements would all be wasted. In any case, excavation works are not labour\n\nintensive.43.        Sim contended that the\n\ndefendants' geotechnic division did not reveal to her the condition of the material they\n\ncored out while installing bored piles; she said she was only given a monthly summary of\n\nthe lengths of piles installed. She added that the geotechnic division would not know what\n\nwas cored out asthey didn't see.44.        Sim admitted that the\n\ndefendants’ successful tender was $6m lower than the next lowest price. She said that\n\nhad the defendants split up the architectural works amongst the various trades; her\n\ncompany would have had to pay more than $3.3m for the works instead of the budgeted $1.34m\n\ninserted in the subcontract. She further revealed that the defendants did not require\n\nperformance bonds from any of their other subcontractors (save for their glazier) as she\n\nhad the security of their retention sums. She agreed that the performance bond originally\n\nrequested from the plaintiffs ($1.37m) was more than the defendants' own performance bond\n\n($1.1m) furnished to HDB.45.        Sim disagreed with Qiu's\n\ntestimony on the issue of drawings and plans. She contended that during negotiations (19\n\nDecember 2000) she had handed him a full set of the drawings (including specifications and\n\nsoil report) which documents Qiu did not return until the subcontract was signed; Sim\n\nhowever, did not make Qiu acknowledge the documents she handed over nor did she sign for\n\nthose he returned. Qiu on the other hand claimed that it was Wang not Sim, who lent him a\n\nset of plans before the parties met on 5 December 2000. Leaving aside the dispute of how\n\nthe documents came to be in Qiu's possession, it is common ground that the plaintiffs were\n\naware from the drawings, of the defendants' scope of works,beforeQiu signed the\n\nsubcontract on the plaintiffs' behalf (28 February 2001).46.        Although she had informed\n\nQiu that the defendants would engage labour from Zap Piling to do the soldier piles (at\n\nthe perimeter of the site), Sim admitted that she did not inform him that the defendants\n\nwould also be providing the materials for the work and would be deducting the costs\n\nthereof from the subcontract price. (It was subsequently clarified in re-examination that\n\nthe materials would not have added to the costs of soldier piling because the defendants\n\nused materials left over from their other projects). Apparently, Zap Piling did not\n\ncomplete their work and demobilise their equipment (including two [2] rigs) until 23 March\n\n2001; however, Sin denied that it resulted in the plaintiffs being delayed in their\n\nexcavation works. It was drawn to her attention that even before that, on 12 March 2001,\n\nthe defendants had given written notice to the plaintiffs that if they did not mobilise\n\ntheir excavation teamby that very afternoon, the defendants would engage another\n\ncompany Midas-Bilt Pte Ltd to do the work immediately, which costs would be backcharged to\n\nthe plaintiffs. Sim insisted that Qiu was told verbally at site meetings of the\n\nparticulars of other subcontractors on site notwithstanding that the defendants did not\n\nreply to the plaintiffs' several letters on such queries.47.        Sim did not deny that the\n\ndefendants' intention was to subcontract out theentireproject. Save for their\n\nproject team headed by Ho Hin Sing and subsequently by June Tan, she revealed that the\n\ndefendants had no staff or site personnel (other than a safety officer) apart from the\n\ndefendants' bored piling workers.48.        What emerges from Sim's\n\ntestimony is, that the defendants not the plaintiffs, dictated how the plaintiffs should\n\ncarry out the works in the subcontract. What is even more remarkable is the fact that the\n\nplaintiffs or more correctly Qiu, seemed to accept the situation. Further, where there\n\ncould be savings in the final price charged by subcontractors appointed for the plaintiffs\n\nby the defendants, those savings were not passed onto the plaintiffs, However, where the\n\nother subcontractors' final pricing exceeded the defendants' budget and in turn the\n\nprovision for that item in the subcontract, the defendants had to absorb the excess cost.\n\nAn illustration of cost-saving was the budget for piling whilst an example of overrun in\n\ncosts would be architectural works, where the budgeted sum of $1,347,508.25 was less than\n\nhalf of the actual sum ($3,383,362.39) the defendants claimed they eventually expended. In\n\nher written testimony (para 64), Sim provided $1,923,342.28 for bored piling in the\n\nsubcontract but the final sum for the item was $281,798.27 less, at $1,641,526.01. Sim\n\nsought to justify the defendants' actions by explaining that the defendants (and in turn\n\nthe plaintiffs) were paid for bored piles according to the lengths and number of piles\n\ninstalled. It was also clear from Sim's testimony that the project was loss-making for the\n\ndefendants. I shall return to these observations later in my judgment.49.        Although the defendants'\n\nstand was that the plaintiffs should have been aware of the soil condition and the same\n\ndid not excuse them from completing the excavation works on time, it was noted (and\n\nadmitted by Sim) from the defendants' letters [seeD1] to the HDB that the\n\ndefendants themselves used thequick sand likecondition of the soil to justify\n\ntheir application for 40 days' extension of time from the HDB, stating the soil\n\ncharacteristic was very rare and remote in Singapore; hence, it was not foreseeable or\n\nexpected at the tender stage. HDB (on 2 October 2001) acceded to the defendants' request\n\nand granted extensions of time up to 20 September 2002, for different stages of work. What\n\nis revealing is, that the defendants' letter (dated 8 September 2001) to the HDB stated\n\nthat the defendants discoveredthe unexpected bad soil conditionduring excavation\n\nworks to basement 2 around 28 July 2001. Sim had also conceded that if the plaintiffs had\n\ncontinued with the subcontract, she would have passed on to them the same extensions of\n\ntime granted by the HDB, notwithstanding that there was no provision for such in the\n\nsubcontract. Although she had asserted (in para 53 of her affidavit) that the defendants'\n\nnew subcontractor was able to find a dumping ground for the excavated rubbish without the\n\ndefendants' assistance, Sim could not name the dumping ground and could not comment on\n\ncounsel's suggestion that the defendants' new excavation subcontractor had actually dumped\n\nthe rubbish on the adjoining state land, then levelled and concealed the rubbish with\n\nearth.50.        I turn now to the\n\ntestimony of the defendants' second and last witness Tan Yew Eing, who is also known as\n\nJune Tan (June). June's written testimony basically corroborated Sim's evidence.\n\nCross-examined and subsequently re-examined, June:a.        said she assumed the post\n\n    of project manager in January 2000 and asked to be released in June 2001 as she found the\n\n    jobtoo stressful;b.        admitted she had pressed\n\n    the plaintiffs to accelerate the works even before they had signed the subcontract\n\n    (because the project was then on a critical path) as by then they had attended site\n\n    meetings. Indeed, the plaintiffs’ site supervisor/engineer Lee Zhong (who has since\n\n    returned to China) used to be on site until 5pm everyday, before 28 February 2000;c.        said although she was aware that Jalan\n\n    Halus (an official dumping ground for rubbish) was nearby, she did not inform the\n\n    plaintiffs asit was not for her to advise, it was for the plaintiffs’ excavation\n\n    contractor to decide where to dump the rubbish.In any event, the rubbish was\n\n    localised and had been dumped on one area of the site only, due to inadequate security\n\n    personnel;d.        explained that Zap Piling’s work\n\n    would not in any case have delayed or prevented the plaintiffs from commencing excavation\n\n    works because, the former installed soldier piles in rows. After each row was completed,\n\n    the plaintiffs could have installed timber laggings in between for shoring purposes in\n\n    preparation for excavation works.June was not questioned on any of the five (5) representations pleaded\n\nin the statement of claim.",
        "The findings.": "51.        At the conclusion of the\n\ntrial, counsel for the plaintiffs informed the court that his clients were relying on\n\nthree (3) representations only for their case, namely:(a)    man year entitlements;(b)    soil condition;(c)    scope of the plaintiffs' contractthereby abandoning representations (ii) and (iv) set out in para 3\n\nabove. I should point out however that representation (iv) [on the absence of adverse or\n\nunusual factors] is merged in the complaint on the unexpected soil condition.\n\nConsequently, I will confine my findings to the three (3) 'live' representations. Counsel\n\nfurther submitted that the three (3) representations were more than negligent, they were\n\ntantamount to fraudulent misrepresentations, from the evidence adduced. I shall now\n\naddress each representation in turn.",
        "(i)    man-year entitlements": "52.        I have already dealt with\n\nthis subject in some detail (paras 19-21supra) as to the plaintiffs' reasons for\n\nwanting 250 or at the very least 180, mainland Chinese workers. Indeed, counsel for the\n\nplaintiffs candidly submitted that this requirement was a critical condition to his\n\nclients. Consequently, if not for Sim's representation to Qiu that she would give him 120\n\nman year entitlements followed by 60 more from the defendants' other projects, the\n\nplaintiffs would not have accepted the subcontract. The plaintiffs did not receive even\n\nthe initial 180 foreign workers, let alone the second lot of 70. He argued that their\n\ncash-flow problem was exacerbated by the defendants' non-payment of the plaintiffs' first\n\ntwo (2) progress claims which counsel described as,the lifebloodof a construction\n\ncompany.53.        However, the plaintiffs'\n\nabove submission has to be viewed against the actual evidence adduced in court. It was\n\nSim's unchallenged testimony that the defendants did sign an application form for 50\n\nforeign workers on the plaintiffs' behalf, on or about 2 May 2001. It was also not\n\ndisputed that the plaintiffs failed or refused to submit the application form (IA). Qiu's\n\nexcuse that he did not provide to the defendants a bond of $2,000 per worker (as which\n\nresult the defendants eventually cancelled the application) because the application had\n\nfirst to be approved by MOM before an insurance company would furnish the security, did\n\nnot explain his failure to submit the Form in the first place. Consequently, the\n\nplaintiffs only have themselves to blame for not getting any man year entitlements. It\n\ndoes not lie in their mouths to complain that the defendants did not give them 250 man\n\nyear entitlements when the latter's offer of 50 workers first (for reasons which I accept)\n\nwas not even taken up by the plaintiffs. It is therefore irrelevant whether the defendants\n\n(through Sim) initially promised the plaintiffs 180 or 250 foreign workers; the question\n\nof breach of this representation did not even arise.",
        "(ii)    soil condition": "54.        The nature of the soil\n\nexcavated was not in dispute (although it was the defendants' contention that it was\n\nlocalised), it comprised of rubbish. The plaintiffs contended that the defendants (who\n\ndenied) knew of the soil condition and failed to disclose to the former; the plaintiffs\n\nrelied on the soil report of ECON GEOTECHNIC dated 9 September 1999 and the fact that it\n\nwas the defendants' own geotechnic division which installed over 300 bored piles. Qiu had\n\nalso alleged that at the meeting with the defendants on 5 December 2000, he had been given\n\nthe impression by Lai that the soil condition was normal. The defendants did not call Lai\n\nto rebut Qiu's allegation but Sim had denied that her geotechnic division would have known\n\nbeforehand of the rubbish, claiming theydid not seewhist the soil report only\n\nstatedbackfill.55.        I disbelieve and reject\n\nSim's testimony in this regard. The defendants must have known or ought to have known, the\n\nnature of the material they excavated; how can their geotechnic division not have seen\n\nwhat they cored out? Yet they kept the information away from the plaintiffs. It is\n\nnoteworthy that the defendants themselves wrote to the HDB much later (on 8 September\n\n2001) using the soil condition as a ground for applying for extension of time.56.        I am mindful of the\n\ndefendants' closing submission that non-disclosure of the soil condition does not amount\n\nto a misrepresentation relying on the following extract fromChitty on Contracts(28 ed vol 1 para 6-013 at p 343) which was also repeated inHudson's Building and\n\nEngineering Contracts(11 ed vol 1 at para 1.145 p 73):-Non-disclosure. The general rule is that mere non-disclosure does not\n\n    constitute misrepresentation, for there is, in general, no duty on the parties to a\n\n    contract to disclose material facts to each other, however dishonest such non-disclosure\n\n    may be in particular circumstances.However, further down in the same passage fromChitty's,the\n\nfollowing extract also appears:-……Tacit acceptance in another's self-deception\n\n    does not itself amount to a misrepresentation, provided that it has not previously been\n\n    caused by a positive misrepresentation. But there are exceptions to the general rule that\n\n    there is no duty to disclose, namely where the contract is within the class of contractsuberrimae\n\n    fidei, where there is fiduciary relationship between the parties, and where failure to\n\n    disclose some fact distorts a positive representation.57.        Granted, a construction\n\ncontract is not within the class of contracts of the utmost good faith but where, as in\n\nthis instance, Qiu had actually inquired from the defendants whether there were any\n\nadverse factors he should know about and was assured there were none, the defendants are\n\ncaught by the second passage I have cited above from para 6-013 ofChitty's.58.        Before I address the\n\nthird misrepresentation, I wish to make some general comments first. There is little doubt\n\nfrom the evidence adduced from both sides' witnesses, of the parties' unequal bargaining\n\nposition. Contrary to the defendants' closing submissions, I did not find Qiu to be\n\nbusiness-savvy at all; he was a babe in the woods and was no match for them when it came\n\nto negotiating with the defendants. Moreover, the plaintiff company was barely three (2)\n\nyears old as at December 2000. Qiu was incredibly nave and if I may add, utterly foolish\n\nas can be seen from two (2) instances: firstly, his misguided optimism that the initial\n\ncash flow for his company (before progress payments from the defendants [which never\n\nmaterialised in any case]) would come from the premium (in excess of $1m) payable by\n\nforeign workers employed by his company. Secondly, his optimism that the plaintiffs' delay\n\nin the subcontract works could be remedied eventually by employing more workers and\n\nputting them to work in two (2) shifts. Thirdly, his foolhardiness in sub-subcontracting\n\nout the excavation works to System Holdings Pte Ltd at $580,000 when the plaintiffs'\n\nsubcontract provided $412,851.28 for that item.59.        Granted, Qiu's testimony\n\nwas inconsistent on the issue of when and what documentation he received from the\n\ndefendant on 5 December 2000 and what exactly he was told about the defendants' contract\n\nfrom HDB for the project, the contract sum and, the omissions therefrom for the\n\nsubcontract. Further, no other witness corroborated his evidence; his 'investor' Sam Yong\n\ndid not testify, neither did his site supervisor/engineer (Lee Zhong) or project manager\n\n(Ma Jun). Whilst the court was told that Lee Zhong had returned to China, nothing was said\n\nabout Sam Yong's or Ma Jun's whereabouts. The court was also not told if any attempts had\n\nbeen made by either side to procure Wang's attendance in court, notwithstanding his having\n\nleft the defendants' services. Despite the shortcomings in his testimony however, I find\n\nthat Qiu was not an untruthful witness. Rather, he came across as foolish, confused and\n\ninexperienced although he flattered himself by telling counsel for the defendants he was a\n\ncareful man. Based on his company's short existence, he could not have had much\n\nexperience. It was mainly due to his inexperience (and perhaps lack of understanding of\n\nwhat Sim told him) that he did not fully comprehend the enormity of the task he had\n\nundertaken on the plaintiffs’ behalf. If indeed he was as experienced in construction\n\nas he claimed to be, Qiu would not have taken on the project based on the residual value\n\nof $5,443,524 offered by the defendants; any experienced contractor would have realised\n\nthat the budget was impossible to achieve, without incurring huge overruns in costs.60.        Unlike the plaintiffs\n\nhowever, the defendants were well aware of the financial risks; their agenda (admitted by\n\nSim) was therefore to pass on to a third party the burden of not only an unprofitable but\n\nmost certainly a loss-making, project. Sim had readily admitted that the defendants were\n\nanxious to look for a main contractor to take over the entire project, on the instructions\n\nof her director of constructions T C Chua. There is no question that the defendants would\n\nhave lost money on the project. Just on two (2) items alone, M & E and architectural\n\nworks, they had under-provided by $2m not to mention the gulf of $6m between their tender\n\nprice and the second lowest tender. The plaintiffs' willingness to accept the project was\n\ntherefore a godsend to the defendants, although the plaintiffs' counsel described his\n\nclients as scapegoats.",
        "(iii)    the scope of the contract": "61.        Despite their\n\nprotestations to the contrary and their repeated assertions that they were only doing\n\ntheir best to help the plaintiffs to finish the project, I have no doubt from the\n\ndefendants' conduct that they did the exact opposite. I say this based on evidence adduced\n\nfrom the defendants' own witnesses.62.        First, there is June's\n\nconduct. It was reprehensible that knowing Jalan Halus dumping ground was nearby, she\n\ndeliberately withheld such information from the plaintiffs when they were desperately\n\nlooking for a place to dump the rubbish they had excavated. Secondly, Sim had testified\n\nthat the plaintiffs would be the subcontractor for the entire project save for three (3)\n\nomissions, which drastically reduced the contract value from $13.7m to $5.4m. True, that\n\nwas known to and accepted by Qiu, who also admitted that he attempted to ask the\n\ndefendants for another $500,000 for the subcontract sum, which request was rejected. What\n\nthe plaintiffs could validly complain was, how the defendants dictated to the plaintiffs\n\nwho the latter should employ as specialist subcontractors and how much those\n\nsubcontractors should be paid. As Qiu explained, this arrangement could be highly\n\ninequitable to the plaintiffs because, the total charges of the subcontractors may even\n\nexceed the subcontract sum and caused the plaintiffs to incur losses; yet, the plaintiffs\n\nhad no say whatsoever on the choice of subcontractors and subcontract sums awarded to them\n\nnot to mention the value of materials supplied by the defendants. Even worse, the\n\ndefendants (according to Sim) expected the plaintiffs to co-ordinate the works of such\n\nother subcontractors without any charge (for profit and attendance). Thirdly, there was\n\nthe defendants' attempt to procure a performance bond for 25% of the subcontract value\n\nfrom the plaintiffs, instead of the usual 10% in the construction industry. It reinforced\n\nmy finding of Qiu's naivete; he did not provide a performance bond in the larger amountnotbecause he realised it was outside industry practice but because the plaintiffs' insurance\n\ncompany (presumably Tai Ping) refused to do so.63.        Consequently, the\n\nsubcontract was not only entirely one-sided in the defendants' favour but the scope had\n\nbeen changed; it wasnotfor the subcontract value of $5,443,524.23 and for the\n\nscope of works represented to and accepted by the plaintiffs/Qiu, but was whittled down\n\nfurther to exclude bored piling, temporary works/instrumentation and soldier piles. The\n\nbreakdown for the subcontract is as follows:(i)bored piling$1,923,324.28(ii)temporary works/instrumentation713,590.98(iii)excavation/earthworks412,851.28(iv)structural works528,044.13(v)waterproofing to basement117,420.49(vi)structural steel works29,322.95(vii)architectural works1,347,508.25(viii)external works (soldier piles)371,461.87$5,443,524.23Excluding those three (3) items, the value of the subcontract was\n\nreduced to $2,435,147.74 ($5,443,524.23 - $1,923,324.28 + $713,590.98 + $371,461.87). In\n\ntheir final submissions, the defendants pointed out (in para 22 of the statement of claim)\n\nthat the plaintiffs had stated they knew of the presence of a bored piling contractor and\n\nZap Piling on site. That may be so but, the plaintiffsdid not know the value or scope\n\nof worksof the two (2) and other subcontractors as, their repeated written inquiries\n\nof the defendants in that regard met with no response. Even if Qiu, as the defendants\n\ncontended, knew the subcontract value to the plaintiffs was actually $3.2m, that was not\n\nthe same as saying that the plaintiffs' subcontract would be $2.4m. If the other\n\nsubcontractors were nominated by the defendants, then industry practice entitled the\n\nplaintiffs to profit and attendance for co-ordinating their works with those of the\n\nsubcontractors. If the subcontractors were not nominated subcontractors but domestic\n\nsubcontractors of the plaintiffs, only the plaintiffs could select and negotiate the terms\n\nand conditions of, their appointment. The defendants however wanted to have their cake and\n\neat it. On the one hand, they told the plaintiffs they would appoint the other\n\nsubcontractors. On the other hand however, they would not allow the plaintiffs to charge\n\nany attendance fee to co-ordinate the works of their appointees. Far worse, copies of the\n\ndefendants' various contracts with numerous subcontractors (signed before as well as after\n\nthe subcontract) were never extended to the plaintiffs at the material time.64.        There is one other small\n\nissue that needs to be dealt with before I turn to the law and the defendants'\n\ncounterclaim – when did the subcontract come into existence? Was it on the date of\n\nexecution (28 February 2001) as the plaintiffs contended or, much earlier as the\n\ndefendants asserted? It was not disputed that the plaintiffs (Qiu and or Lee Zhong) had\n\nattended site meetings since 30 January 2001 as which result, the defendants considered\n\nthe subcontracta done dealwell before 28 February 2001. It bears recapitulating\n\nthat the parties first met on 5 December 2000 and Qiu was handed the subcontract agreement\n\ndated 19 December 2000 about that date. It should be further noted that the plaintiffs\n\nprovided the performance bond for the subcontract on 15 February 2001. Applying cl 20.0 of\n\nthe subcontract, which states:Within 14 days of the letter of acceptance, the\n\n    subcontractor shall deposit with the contractor an amount of $544,351.42 as and by way of\n\n    security for the due performance of and observance by the sub-contractor of his\n\n    obligations under the contract or a demand bond in an approved formulacan it be said that the subcontract was actually concluded on 1\n\nFebruary 2001 by the plaintiffs' conduct in furnishing the performance bond? I think not.\n\nIn the statement of claim, the plaintiffs explained (in para 20) that they had sent a\n\nrepresentative (presumably Lee Zhong) to the site in January 2001 purely to do preparatory\n\nwork; Qiu had alleged that it was the defendants who invited the plaintiffs to visit the\n\nsite. The defendants (June) on the other hand gave written notice to the plaintiffs (on 20\n\nFebruary 2001 at 2AB202) that they would start imposing a penalty if the plaintiffs'\n\nworkers failed to show up at site. This was followed by another letter from June dated 27\n\nFebruary 2001 (2AB196) pointing out to the plaintiffs that the defendants wereso\n\nbehind time. The second letter explains the defendants' eagerness to hold the\n\nplaintiffs to the subcontract even before the execution date of 27 February 2001 and\n\nthereafter to terminate the same due to the plaintiffs' alleged breaches – the\n\ndefendants themselves were behind schedule on the project, which fact they did not\n\ndisclose to Qiu on 5 December 2000. It would be wholly unjust and inequitable to hold that\n\nthe plaintiffs were bound by the subcontract before they signed it on 28 February 2001.",
        "The law": "65.        In the statement of\n\nclaim, the plaintiffs had prayed for rescission of the subcontract pursuant to s 2 of the\n\nMisrepresentation Act Cap 390 (the Act) which reads as follows:-(1) Where a person has entered into a contract after a\n\n    misrepresentation has been made to him by another party thereto and as a result thereof he\n\n    has suffered loss, then, if the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to\n\n    damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently, that person\n\n    shall be so liable notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently,\n\n    unless he proves that he had reasonable ground to believe and did believe up to the time\n\n    the contract was made that the facts represented were true.(2) Where a person has entered into a contract after a\n\n    misrepresentation has been made to him otherwise fraudulently, and he would be entitled,\n\n    by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract, then, if it is claimed, in\n\n    any proceedings arising out of the contract, that the contract ought to be or has been\n\n    rescinded, the court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages\n\n    in lieu of rescission, if of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to\n\n    the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the\n\n    contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other\n\n    party.",
        "The decision": "66.        On the evidence, I find\n\nthat the plaintiffs have succeeded in their claim on misrepresentations (ii) and (iii) but\n\nfailed on misrepresentation (i). In the light of my findings on the defendants' conduct,\n\nit can hardly be said that the misrepresentations were made innocently. I very much doubt\n\nthat the defendants can claim (under s 2(1) of the Act) that they had reasonable grounds\n\nto believe and did believe up to the time the subcontract was made, that the facts told to\n\nthe plaintiffs under misrepresentations (ii) and (iii) were true. Are the plaintiffs\n\ntherefor entitled to rescission of the contract under s 2(1) of the Act or, would damages\n\nbe an adequate remedy, under s 2(2) thereof? Even if the misrepresentations had been made\n\ninnocently, s 1 of the Act makes it clear that the plaintiffs are not thereby precluded\n\nfrom having the subcontract rescinded, notwithstanding that the contract has been\n\nperformed.67.        In this regard, I note\n\nthat the plaintiffs' position on their pleadings is ambivalent. In paras (a) and (b) of\n\nthe reliefs claimed, they had prayed forboth rescission and damages for rescissionrespectively.\n\nAt law, rescission means that the plaintiffs are entitled to be restored to the position\n\nthey would have been in had the contract not been made. Effectively, that would mean that\n\nthe plaintiffs would recover back all the sums they had expended for working on the\n\nproject, including the amount ($30,100) paid to Tai Ping for issuance of the performance\n\nbond.68.        It has to be borne in\n\nmind that the plaintiffs did not succeed on misrepresentation (i) and their conduct was\n\nnot entirely blameless. One clear example would be Qiu's folly in engaging System Holdings\n\nPte Ltd to do excavations works at a higher amount than that provided for the item in the\n\nsubcontract, and then attempting (unsuccessfully) to switch subcontractors. The court\n\ncannot relieve the plaintiffs and the defendants should not have to pay for the\n\nconsequences, of Qiu's folly, namely the judgment sum of $180,000. Another instance of the\n\nplaintiffs' fault would be Qiu's decision not to proceed to apply for 50 man year\n\nentitlements, without valid reasons. It is a moot point whether the plaintiffs would have\n\nbeen entitled to extensions of time due to the soil condition, and claim the benefit of\n\nthe extensions of time granted to the defendants by the HDB; we will never know.",
        "The counterclaim": "69.        The maxim he who comes to\n\nequity must come with clean hands is well known and does not bear repetition. Rescission\n\nis an equitable remedy and the defendants cannot rely on their own misrepresentations as a\n\nbasis to found a counterclaim for damages. Consequently, their counterclaim is dismissed\n\nwith costs to the plaintiffs.",
        "Conclusion": "70.        I award judgment to the\n\nplaintiffs with costs. I hold that the subcontract is rescinded, the defendants are\n\ndirected to deliver up Tai Ping's performance bond for cancellation and, the interim\n\ninjunction granted on 22 August 2001 to the plaintiffs to restrain the defendants from\n\ncalling for payment on the performance bond is affirmed. The Registrar is directed to\n\nassess the expenses incurred by the plaintiffs consequent on rescission, such sums to\n\nexclude reimbursement/payment of the judgment sum awarded to System Holdings Pte Ltd, with\n\nthe costs of such assessment reserved to the Registrar.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
