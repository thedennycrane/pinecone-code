        "Forgery": "5 We first deal with the allegation that the appellants’ signatures on the 2004 mortgage instrument were forged. This is a serious allegation. The burden of proof of forgery in law lies squarely on the appellants’ shoulders. They did not produce any forensic evidence to prove that the impugned signature was forged and not their own. To support this allegation, the appellants relied on a police report that they filed in March 2021, eight days prior to the hearing before the Judge. We agree with the Judge that the report was a bare assertion, self-serving and plainly unsatisfactory. 6 This is also a most improbable allegation. The appellants do not, indeed they cannot, argue that they did not take out a loan to purchase the property. They do not say they had enough funds to purchase the property from their own resources or that they had taken out a loan with another bank or from another source. Further, this mortgage was signed, as noted above, in March 2004 and in the presence of a solicitor. They had been making the instalment payments for many years before they fell behind in their payments. The appellants cannot deny that they had an account with the bank and that they had been making their instalment payments from that account. They even drew down on their CPF accounts towards these mortgage instalment payments. For them to ignore all this evidence, including alleged discrepancies which we deal with below, and say their signatures were forged on the 2004 mortgage instrument is something that cannot be believed.",
        "Inconsistencies and errors": "7 The appellants refer to purported inconsistencies and errors in the mortgage instrument, the SSCT and the insurance policy. They also claim that the bank erred in making excess deductions under the facility. The Judge found that these allegations were without merit, and we agree with the Judge’s findings here: (a) The discrepancy between the 1999 mortgage document and the 2004 mortgage instrument regarding the bank’s name was simply the result of the respondent changing its name from “The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd” to “DBS Bank Ltd”. (b) The formatting issues and discrepancies as to the mortgagors’ address between the 1999 mortgage document and 2004 mortgage instrument were not material. The legal details of the property were left blank because the legal title of the property had not been issued at the time of the 1999 housing loan. (c) The discrepancy in signatures in the appellants’ and respondent’s copy of the 2004 mortgage instrument was the result of the need to hold duplicate copies of that document. The differences appear minor and, as noted above, the burden of proof fell on them to prove, usually by expert forensic evidence, that the signatures were not their signatures. They have failed to prove this allegation. (d) The SSCT document was correct. This was supported by a Lot History Search, a letter from the Building & Construction Authority dated 22 November 2000, and an email from the Singapore Land Authority dated 5 February 2021. This submission, with respect, shows a complete misunderstanding of how a plot of land is eventually subdivided into strata title for the individual apartments in a development. That same basic ignorance of how the share value of a unit in a development is derived and indeed fixed by the Building & Construction Authority is also exhibited in the submission of the appellants. In any case, this cannot prevent the enforcement of the bank’s rights under the mortgage. (e) The insurance policy was alleged to have been varied without permission, but this was not raised before the Judge below. In any case it is irrelevant and cannot be a basis to bar the bank’s right to enforce the terms of their mortgage. (f) The bank accepted that it did receive CPF Board remittances in excess of the monthly instalment payments, but the onus was on the appellants to instruct CPF Board not to do so. In any event, the payments were taken into account for the purposes of reducing the outstanding amount payable.",
        "Undue influence": "8 Finally, the appellants again rely ondictuminMalayan Banking Berhad vSivakolunthu Thirunavukarasu and others[2008] 1 SLR(R) 149 at [35] for the proposition that, where the same lawyers act for purchaser and vendor in a conveyance, the presumption of undue influence could arise. However, that case is distinguishable; the representation of both mortgagor and mortgagee by a common solicitor in the present case (particularly where standard mortgages and standard mortgage terms and conditions for private residences are concerned) is very different from a situation where the purchaser and vendor are represented by the same solicitor (in which case the parties may have opposing interests). In any event, the appellants do not state how they were unduly influenced. Notwithstanding this alleged undue influence, the appellants continued to make monthly mortgage payments and the passage of time undermines their assertion here.",

        "Conclusion": "9 For the above reasons, this appeal is dismissed. 10 Costs must follow the event. The bank is entitled to indemnity costs. We fix costs at $30,000 all in to be paid by the appellants jointly and severally to the respondent bank. There will be the usual consequential orders.
