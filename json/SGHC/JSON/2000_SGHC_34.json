        "Denial of liability for damages": "11.    The arguments for\n\nthe defendants were advanced by the lawyers of the Club’s insurers. On the issue of\n\ndamages their submission went as follows : The plaintiff’s office at the Club as its\n\nVice-President and a general committee member was not an office of profit. Accordingly he\n\nhad not suffered any pecuniary loss as a result of his wrongful removal. In any case, the\n\nplaintiff had not pleaded any pecuniary loss. The plaintiff was claiming damages for\n\nbreach of contract for embarrassment, humiliation and damage to his reputation and\n\nstanding. Save in very exceptional cases (of which this was not one), such damages were\n\nnot recoverable for breach of contract. The plaintiff’s claim for damages for loss of\n\nreputation and standing could have been brought in defamation. In that situation the\n\ndefendants would have had their defences available. He had not pursued that course of\n\naction. He had endorsed such a claim against the sixth defendant on the writ of summons\n\nbut decided to abandon it. The plaintiff had also indicated at the start of the trial that\n\nhe might amend his statement of claim to allege conspiracy and add parties. That, too, he\n\nhad decided not to proceed with. In the premises, the plaintiff was, at most, entitled to\n\nnominal damages, which the defendants submitted should be limited to a sum of $1.00 each,\n\nmaking a total of $6.00.",
        "A trilogy of Singapore decisions": "12.    I shall preface the\n\nanalysis of the law on the issue before me by bethinking a trilogy of Singapore decisions\n\non the matter. InHaron Mundir v Singapore Amateur Athletic Association[1992] 1 SLR 18I rejected a claim for general damages for mental distress in a club case.\n\nI did so on the basis ofAddis v Gramophone Co Ltd[1909] AC 488. InHaron\n\nMundir,I attempted to explain one facet of the underlying reason\n\nfor the rule. Unbeknown to me, the law had turned a full circle. I shall explain this\n\nlater. Next,Hua Khian Ceramics Tiles Supplies Pte Ltd[1992] 1 SLR 884I\n\nrefused a claim for general damages for injury to reputation in a breach of contract case.\n\nFinally, in the case ofLee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong[1999] 3 SLR 630ruled that the law will not award general damages for mental distress when damages are to\n\nbe assessed on a breach of contract basis. In that case, I made a further attempt to\n\nexplain another facet of the underlying reason for the rule. The last of the trilogy was\n\naffirmed by the Court of Appeal inTeo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew.",
        "Analysis of the law - Mental Distress": "13.    I now commence an\n\nanalysis of the law on the issue. Historically speaking, English law acted on the\n\napriorism that pure mental suffering without physical injury was an inevitable fact of\n\ninterpersonal relationships in private and public life alike. Unlike actionable physical\n\ninjury, which arises from an external cause, mental distress stems from inherent\n\npredisposition of the individual. As it arose from the constitution and circumstances of\n\nthe individual it did not traditionally give a cause of action. After all, people must\n\nlearn to accept with a certain degree of stoicism the slings and arrows of this vale of\n\ntears. In such instances, they should be slow to rush to the law with a tale of tears and\n\nfears save in certain recognised circumstances. It makes no difference whether the event\n\ncausing such suffering was the commission of a tort or the breaking of a contract. In the\n\ntime-honoured language of the law, such suffering is too remote for recompense at law: seeVictorian Railways Commissioners v Coultas(1888) 13 AC 222. At one time, it\n\nwas thought that this was not a desirable situation because it failed to deter the callous\n\nconduct of irresponsible people. So an attempt was made to move the boundary by Wright J\n\ninWilkinson v Downton(1897) 2 QB 57. Notably, that was not a contract\n\naction. Even in tort the novelty failed to flourish. It is settled law that mental\n\ndistress by itself does not constitute sufficient damage to found a cause of action. In\n\n1957, Devlin J stated the correct position inBehrens v Bertram Mills Circus Ltd[1957] 2 QB 1 at 28 : \"The general principle embedded in the common law that mental\n\nsuffering caused by grief, fear, anguish and the like is not assessable.\" It is apt\n\nfor me to repeat here what I said inHaron Mundir v Singapore Amateur Athletic\n\nAssociation[1992] 1 SLR 18at p 31 :The object of awarding damages in contract\n\n  is different from tort. The underlying logic for the difference is that the law of\n\n  contract is concerned with a defendant’s failure to improve the claimant’s\n\n  position by his failure to keep a promise. In contract the loss is monetary and, being\n\n  measurable in terms of money, is therefore special. The law of tort, on the other hand, is\n\n  concerned with the plaintiff’s position made worse by a wrongdoing of the defendant.\n\n  The damage is in the main non-economic and, being immeasurable, is general. Damages must\n\n  be assessed.14.    Furthermore, inLonrho\n\nv Fayed(No 5)[1993] 1 WLR 1489, the English Court of Appeal emphatically stated\n\nthat damages for injury to reputation and injury to feelings, though recoverable in an\n\naction for defamation, could not be recovered in an action for conspiracy. To sustain a\n\nclaim for conspiracy, actual financial loss must be proved. The bottom line position is\n\nthat in tort damages for mental suffering became a subsidiary element in the assessment of\n\ndamages.Present authorities15.    The position in\n\ncontract is very circumscribed. The present state of the law is stated clearly and\n\nconcisely inChitty On Contracts28thEdition, Para 27-069 as\n\nfollows :27-069 - Normally, no damages in contract\n\n  will be awarded for injury to the claimant’s feelings, or for his mental distress,\n\n  anguish, annoyance, loss of reputation or social discredit by the breach of contract; as\n\n  where an employee is wrongfully dismissed in a humiliating manner.16.Halsbury’s\n\nLaws of England, 4thEdition, Vol 12(1) encapsulates the current law in\n\nthese words :957-Whether damages are\n\n  recoverable in contract for loss of enjoyment, loss of amenity, disappointment, vexation,\n\n  distress or similar suffering caused by breach depends on the nature of the contract\n\n  broken and on whether the innocent party suffers any accompanying physical discomfort or\n\n  inconvenience. Such damages are awarded only exceptionally and awards are traditionally\n\n  modest.958 - The general rule is that a contract\n\n  breaker is not liable for distress, frustration, anxiety, displeasure, vexation, tension\n\n  or aggravation caused to the innocent party by the breach of contract. The rule is one of\n\n  policy and applies notwithstanding the foreseeability of the distress or other adverse\n\n  event.17.    The American wisdom\n\non the matter is accurately articulated inModern Law of Contracts, 1999\n\nRevised Edition, by Howard O. Hunter at p 18-12 :Recovery for mental distress,\n\n  disappointment, and anguish is inappropriate in contract actions for four reasons : (1) it\n\n  is not directly related to the economic effect of the breach; (2) it is open to\n\n  speculation; (3) it may be the subject of frivolous claims; and (4) it is not reasonably\n\n  within the contemplation of the breaching party.Damage to reputation18.    Closely related to\n\nthe problem of awarding damages for mental distress is the problem of damage to\n\nreputation. As far back as English legal history can go, English law has recognised damage\n\nto one’s reputation as a cause of action. This was because reputation carries greater\n\nvalue than material wealth. This justification was well expressed in these words inOtello\n\nAct III Scene 3.Good name in man and woman,Is the immediate jewel of their souls:Who steals my purse steals trash;\n\n  ’tis something, nothing;’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has\n\n  been slave to thousands;But he that filches from me my good nameRobs me of that which not enriches him,And makes me poor indeed.It is on that moral fundament that the\n\ntorts of libel and slander were founded. Since, save in certain exceptional circumstances,\n\nno general damages would be awarded in breach of contract cases, financial loss resulting\n\nfrom damage to reputation must be proved in contract cases.19.    Para 27-071Chitty\n\nOn Contractsstates the true principle that \"Damages for loss of reputation\n\nas such are not normally awarded for breach of contract, since protection of reputation is\n\nthe role of the tort of defamation\". See alsoMalik v Bank of Credit And\n\nCommerce International SA[1998] AC 20 where at page 40 Lord Nicholls said :\n\n\"I agree that the cause of action known to the law in respect of injury to reputation\n\nis the tort of defamation.\"",
        "The Malik case": "20.    (i) However, that\n\nrecent decision ofMalik v Bank of Credit And Commerce International SAmade\n\na slight variation to the above rule. This case made it possible to recover financial\n\nloss, that is special damages, where breach of a contract damages one’s reputation\n\nwhich in turn causes foreseeablefinancial lossto the claimant. The claim is\n\nsubject to the established limiting principles of remoteness causation and mitigation.(ii) TheMalikcase arose\n\nout of a contract of employment and the disastrous collapse of the infamous bank –\n\nBank of Credit and Commerce International SA (\"BCCI\") (\"the bank\").\n\nMalik was the head of deposit accounts and customer services at a branch office of the\n\nbank. When the bank was ordered to be wound up he was dismissed by the provisional\n\nliquidators on the ground of redundancy. He brought an action asserting that he had lost\n\nmore than his job. He said that by reason of the corrupt and/or dishonest manner in which\n\nthe bank operated and the consequential collapse of the bank he was at a handicap on the\n\nlabour market because he was stigmatised by reason of his employment by the bank. He\n\nclaimed £50,000 based on some \"table of service\". His claim was based on an\n\nimplied term in his contract of employment that \"the employer will not, without\n\nreasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner calculated or likely to destroy or\n\nseriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust between employer and\n\nemployee.\" The liquidators rejected the claim.(iii) On appeal Evans-Lombe J refused to\n\nimply the term contended for. The Judge foundAddis v Gramophone Co Ltdthe\n\nprincipal stumbling block. On appeal the Court of Appeal was prepared to imply a term to\n\nthe effect that the bank was under a duty not, without reasonable and proper cause, to\n\nconduct itself in a manner calculated or likely to destroy or seriously damage the\n\nrelationship of confidence and trust between employer and employee. Nevertheless,\n\n\"stigma damage\" as a head of compensation was not recoverable in law. Once againAddis v Gramophone Co Ltdprovided the justification for the decision. Malik\n\nappealed to the House of Lords. His appeal was allowed. The House of Lords ruled that the\n\nbank had broken its implied obligation of trust and confidence. Accordingly Malik was\n\nentitled to damages for the financial loss suffered by him upon proof and to the extent\n\nthat his future employment prospects were prejudiced by the stigma of his employment with\n\nthe eggregious employer.(iv) TheMalikcase does\n\nnot, however, affect the law relating to general damages for breach of contract. It must\n\nat once be appreciated that this was not a case of wrongful termination of employment. The\n\nbreach there related to an independent implied term. Next, it was not a claim for general\n\ndamages but special damages – that is to say financial loss. DespiteMalik’s\n\ncase, the general rule remains that for breach of contract, the compensation is for proven\n\nfinancial loss and not general damages",
        "The Ruxley Electronics case": "21.    It is now necessary\n\nto consider another House of Lords decision, namely,Ruxley Electronics and\n\nConstruction v Forsyth[1996] AC 344. This case gives effect to the ancient Greek\n\nwisdom : \"Nothing too much\". That saying was transformed into a rule of law by\n\nthe great American judge – Cardozo J. In the leading case ofJacob & Youngs\n\nInc v Kent(1921) 129 N.E. 889 Cardozo J, delivering the judgment of the majority\n\nof the Court of Appeals of New York, held that the court will not award damages which\n\nwould be grossly and unfairly out of proportion to the good to be obtained. In theRuxley\n\nElectronicscase, the defendant had contracted to build a swimming pool with a\n\ndiving area 7 feet 6 inches deep. On completion the diving area was only 6 feet deep. The\n\nowner claimed £21,500 being the estimated cost of rebuilding it to the contractual dept\n\nof 7 feet 6 inches. The plaintiff had no intention of reconstructing the pool to the\n\ncontractual depth. Judge Diamond QC rejected the claim of special damages and awarded\n\ngeneral damages in the sum of £2,500 for loss of pleasurable amenity. The Court of Appeal\n\nreversed the decision. The House of Lords restored the decision of Judge Diamond QC. The\n\nHouse of Lords held that the plaintiff was entitled to something for loss of amenity. The\n\nclaim for the estimated cost of reinstatement in the circumstances of the case was\n\nunreasonable.",
        "The plaintiff’s arguments": "22.    The present\n\nplaintiff pitched his case at a high level. It was postulated to depend on the proposition\n\nthat general damages would be awarded for mental distress and its cognates arising from\n\nbreach of contract if that was within the contemplation of the parties. The plaintiff\n\nrelied onCox v Philips Industries Ltd[1976] 1 WLR 638 which first\n\narticulated the proposition in 1975.23.    Another case relied\n\non by the plaintiff wasTippett v International Typographical Union(1976)\n\n71 DLR (3D) 146. In that case, it was held that general damages within reasonable bounds\n\nwere recoverable for loss of reputation and mental distress arising from breach of\n\ncontract. The case applied the test of foreseeability. The court sidesteppedAddis v\n\nGramophone Co Ltdon the understanding that in that case the mental distress was\n\nnot foreseeable.24.    The plaintiffs\n\nfurther citedBrown v Waterloo Regional Board of Commissioners of Police(1982)\n\n136 DLR (3d) 49. The case stated, inter alia, the following at p 56 :It is now clear that damages are\n\n  recoverable for mental suffering flowing from a breach of contract if such damage is\n\n  within the contemplation of the parties at the time they enter the contract. Normally, in\n\n  ordinary commercial contract situations, it is not contemplated that mental suffering will\n\n  result from a breach of contract; however, where the contract affects \"personal,\n\n  social and family interests\", the likelihood of mental suffering in the event of a\n\n  breach may be foreseen. There has been a dramatic breakthrough in the law in this area in\n\n  recent years. The earlier law as set out inAddis v Gramophone Co Ltdis being\n\n  abandoned.25.    In the above case,\n\nthe Court relied onMcGregor on Damages13thEd (1972) and the\n\nfollowing proposition of Lord Denning MR inCook v S[1967] 1 All ER 299 at\n\np 303 \"I think that, just as in the law of tort, so also in the law of contract,\n\ndamages can be recovered for nervous shock or anxiety state if it is a reasonably\n\nforeseeable consequence\".26.    Great reliance was\n\nplaced by the plaintiff on a New Zealand case :Whelan v Waitaii Meats Ltd[1991] 2 NZLR 74. In that case the New Zealand High Court awarded $50,000 as general\n\ndamages in a wrongful dismissal case. The principal reason the court gave for not\n\nfollowingAddis v Gramophone Co Ltdwas that the proposition that the law\n\ndid not permit general damages for breach of contract was no longer the law as the House\n\nof Lords itself had departed from it inWilson v United Counties Bank Ltd[1920] AC 102.27.    After reviewing the\n\nrelevant authorities, I concluded that the plaintiff relied on outdated law based on\n\noutdated cases and books.Cox v Philips Industries Ltdwas overruled byBliss\n\nv South East Thames Regional Health Authority[1987] 1 C.R. 700. The 16thedition ofMcGregor On Damageshas abandoned the purported changes in law\n\nstated in earlier editions. By 1991, attempts to put an end to the conventional wisdom had\n\ndied a silent death. The law had turned a full circle. In 1991, in the case ofWatts\n\nv Morrow[1991] 1 WLR 1421, Bingham L.J. lucidly put the point and purpose of the\n\ncorrect rule at 1445 :A contract-breaker is not in general\n\n  liable for any distress, frustration, anxiety, displeasure, vexation, tension or\n\n  aggravation which his breach of contract may cause to the innocent party. This rule is\n\n  not, I think, founded on the assumption that such reactions are not foreseeable, which\n\n  they surely are or may be, but on considerations of policy.But the rule is not absolute. Where the\n\n  very object of a contract is to provide pleasure, relaxation, peace of mind or freedom\n\n  from molestation, damages will be awarded if the fruit of the contract is not provided or\n\n  if the contrary result is procured instead. If the law did not cater for this exceptional\n\n  category of case it would be defective.InLee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong[1999] 3 SLR 630, counsel for the claimant declared with great fanatical force that it was\n\na monstrous principle and vowed to have it reversed on appeal. The case went on appeal.\n\nThe Singapore Court of Appeal, on the basis ofAddis v Gramophone Co Ltd,as\n\nfurther amplified inJarvis v Swans Tours Ltd[1973] 1 All ER 71 andMalikcases, held that general damages are not recoverable for mental distress arising from\n\nbreach of contract. SeeTeo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew(Civil Appeal No 303 of\n\n1998)[1999] 4 SLR 560.Conclusion28.    On the basis of the\n\nabove discourse I have no alternative but to dismiss the claim for substantial general\n\ndamages. I award nominal damages of $1 against each defendant. In doing so I should make\n\nit clear that the disallowance of the plaintiff’s extra relief for damages does not\n\nin any way discount the exculpation he has been given with the agreement of his opponents.29.    Had the plaintiff\n\nbeen suspended from or deprived of his Club membership I would have given general damages\n\nunder the exception of loss of amenities. In this case the plaintiff remained a member at\n\nall times.Dated this 10thday of March\n\n2000.G P SELVAMJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
