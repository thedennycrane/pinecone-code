        "The background": "4        On 31 May\n\n2001 Far East Packaging commenced winding up proceedings to wind up the Joint Venture\n\nCompany on a judgment debt which it had obtained. The plaintiffs looked into the matters\n\nand came to the conclusion that the Joint Venture Company had substantial cross claims\n\nagainst Far East Packaging which would overtop the judgment debt.5        First, the\n\nplaintiffs assert that Far East Packaging had dishonestly assisted Mr Wu and Mr Lim in the\n\nlatters’ breaches of their fiduciary duties and/or breaches of trusts. These two\n\nexecutives had misrepresented to Quanzhou Hengwei and the Joint Venture Company that\n\nvarious trade debtors of Quanzhou Hengwei amounting to the total value RMB5.7 million had\n\nnot paid those debts, when in truth and in fact these debts had been paid to Quanzhou\n\nHengwei. The plaintiffs further claim that Far East Packaging had knowingly received\n\nRMB1,244,108.45 as constructive trustee of the Joint Venture Company and/or Quanzhou\n\nHengwei. In this connection, the plaintiffs allege that Far East Packaging and Mr CC Thing\n\nhad through their representatives Mr Wu and Mr Lim fraudulently misrepresented to the\n\nJoint Venture Company and Quanzhou Hengwei that Quanzhou Hengwei were liable in the said\n\nsum for \"handling fees\" and/or \"general fees\" when in fact all of them\n\nknew that the representations were false. They all knew that the said sum should not have\n\nbeen paid.6        In\n\namplifying the allegations, it is alleged that Far East Packaging had in connection with\n\nits management of Quanzhou Hengwei appointed one Mr Zhu Yi Qing (\"Mr Zhu\") as a\n\nsales manager of the factory. At that time, Mr CC Thing, Mr Wu and Mr Lim were authorised\n\nto run the day to day business of Quanzhou Hengwei. Accordingly, Mr Zhu owed the following\n\nfiduciary duties to Quanzhou Hengwei, namely: (1) to collect debts from the trade debtors\n\nof Quanzhou Hengwei and hand them to the accounts department; (2) to act in good faith and\n\nin the best interests of the company; (3) not to place himself in a position in which his\n\npersonal interests did or might conflict with the interests of the company; and (4) to\n\nhold whatever monies and property collected from the trade debtors on trust for Quanzhou\n\nHengwei. In addition, Far East Packaging and Mr CC Thing, according to the plaintiffs also\n\nowed the last three named fiduciary duties to the Joint Venture Company and Quanzhou\n\nHengwei.7        Mr Zhu had\n\nin a statement in Chinese disclosed what had transpired. He said that he was appointed as\n\nmanager of the business department of Quanzhou Hengwei in March 1996. He was responsible\n\nfor marketing and for the collection of debts from customers. Mr Lim as representative of\n\nFar East Packaging was appointed executive director and general manager of Quanzhou\n\nHengwei. Mr Wu assisted Mr Lim in the management of Quanzhou Hengwei. Mr Zhu alleges that\n\nin 1998 Mr CC Thing, one Mr Teng Chiang Keow, Mr Wu and Mr Lim had conspired with him (Mr\n\nZhu) to hatch a plan. Under it, it was agreed that monies collected from trade debtors\n\nwould be paid into their individual personal accounts and the proceeds would be used to\n\nincorporate and fund a new company to be set up to compete with the business of Quanzhou\n\nHengwei. Mr CC Thing promised that Mr Zhu and Mr Wu would be allotted 10% of the\n\nshareholdings of the new company. Mr CC Thing promised that he would incorporate the\n\ncompany in Singapore which would be used, in turn, to form a company in Quanzhou, PRC. The\n\ncompany formed in Singapore was, in the event, Sin Quan Packaging Pte Ltd which was\n\nincorporated on 18 May 1998. In fact, according to the plaintiffs, at a manager’s\n\nmeeting at the end of 1999 Mr Zhu admitted in the presence of Mr CC Thing, Mr Wu and the\n\nrepresentatives of the plaintiffs, one Mr Dai Zhi Xin, a sales representative of Quanzhou\n\nHengwei and Mr Go Twan Heng (\" Mr Go\") that Far East Packaging had instructed\n\nhim to divert funds from Quanzhou Hengwei to Far East Packaging. The total amount diverted\n\nwas approximately RMB2.4 million. At that meeting, Mr CC Thing told Mr Go that Mr Wu had\n\n\"taken\" RMB2.4 million from the trade debtors and that Far East Packaging would\n\nrepay this sum. According to Mr Go, Mr CC Thing had at the same time promised that he (Mr\n\nCC Thing) would be personally liable for the RMB2.4 million.8        In the\n\nstatement, Mr Zhu also referred to various payments from his personal account into which\n\nthe funds collected from the trade debtors of Quanzhou Hengwei had been deposited. He had\n\non Mr Wu’s instructions paid RMB20,000 to one Cheng Xiang, the driver of Mr CC Thing.\n\nAccording to Mr Zhu, Mr Wu had said that the money was meant for the girlfriend of Mr CC\n\nThing. On another occasion, Mr Zhu had paid Mr Wu RMB20,000 at the latter’s request.9        Mr Zhu in\n\nthe statement further alleged that he had handed over to Mr Wu the sum of RMB350,000 which\n\nMr Wu had paid over to the Shanghainese girlfriend of Mr Teng. He further alleged that Mr\n\nWu had instructed one Mr Li Po and one Mr Lin Lian Fang to collect monies from the trade\n\ndebtors of Quanzhou Hengwei and that Mr Wu had received about RMB300,000 to RMB400,000\n\nfrom these collectors.10      Mr Go in his affidavit\n\nin support of the plaintiffs’ application herein asserts that Mr Zhu and Mr Wu had\n\ncollected from trade debtors of Quanzhou Hengwei the approximate sum of RMB5.7 million. In\n\nseveral sub-paragraphs under para 19 of his affidavit Mr Go listed the breakdown.11       Another head of\n\nclaim is in relation to the sum of RMB1,244,108.45 which were paid out by Quanzhou Hengwei\n\nfor \"handling fees\" or \"general fees\" which the plaintiffs assert were\n\nnot genuine liabilities at all. They were paid out against 9 vouchers issued in 1997. In\n\n1997 the total import of paper to Quanzhou Hengwei was 1089.66 metric tons. According to\n\nthe customs documents the import and export of the paper was tax exempted. There could not\n\nhave been such substantial, extraordinary and apparently unexplained liabilities. The\n\nplaintiffs assert that Far East Packaging caused these payments to be made by Mr Lim and\n\nMr Wu to themselves or to third parties when there was no justification for such payments.12        By a letter\n\nof 22 June 2001 a director of the Joint Venture Company appointed by the plaintiffs under\n\nthe Joint Venture Agreement called for the convening of the Directors’ Meeting and an\n\nExtraordinary General Meeting of the Joint Venture Company to consider the commencement of\n\nlegal proceedings to claim against Far East Packaging and Mr CC Thing for the recovery of\n\nmonies of Quanzhou Hengwei which were dishonestly retained or diverted by them. In July\n\n2001 the directors of the Joint Venture Company who were appointed by Far East Packaging\n\nreplied to the effect that they were abstaining to vote. Those directors did not turn up\n\nat the scheduled meetings. They also failed to attend the adjourned meetings. As clause\n\n4.5 of the Joint Venture Agreement dated 27 March 1996 stipulated that the quorum for any\n\ndirectors’ meeting shall be at least one director of the Joint Venture Company\n\nappointed by the plaintiffs and one director appointed by Far East Packaging, no valid\n\nmeeting was convened and there was no corporate approval to commence the legal\n\nproceedings. The plaintiffs contend that Far East Package had unreasonably refused to\n\nattend the directors’ meeting and authorised the commencement of the legal\n\nproceedings.13        In response\n\nto the contention of the first three defendants that Quanzhou Hengwei, and not its parent\n\n(the Joint Venture Company), has the locus standi to commence legal proceedings against\n\nFar East Packaging, Mr CC Thing and others, the plaintiffs through their solicitors sought\n\nthe opinion on Chinese law in relation to three questions. The first question is whether\n\nthere is any equivalent of s 216A of the Act in Chinese Company law that gives a\n\nshareholder of a company the right to sue in the name of the company. The second question\n\nis whether, under the law of China concerning enterprises with Sole Foreign Investment and\n\nDetailed Rules for the implementation of the Law of China on Sole Foreign Investment\n\nEnterprises, there are equivalent provisions similar to s 216A of the Act. The third\n\nquestion is this: if there is a deadlock between the shareholders of a company in not\n\nbeing able to procure or cause the company to sue the debtors, how would the Courts in\n\nChina deal with the situation. In December 2001 Mr Wan Hailong, a licensed practising\n\nlawyer in the PRC, of 9 years’ standing gave his opinion on the 3 legal questions. He\n\nopined that under the Companies Act and the Foreign Capital Enterprises Act and their\n\nrelevant rules and regulations, there is nothing that is similar to those of section 216A\n\nof the Act. He further stated in his opinion that if there are two camps of shareholders\n\nwith conflicting views resulting in a situation where the company cannot pass a resolution\n\nto sue in the name of the company, then the Court will not deal with the company’s\n\nclaims against its debtors. These views were not challenged by the first three defendants\n\nand no contrary opinions on the relevant Chinese laws were proffered. Accordingly, the\n\nconclusion is that in a stalemate, such as the one in this instant case, Quanzhou Hengwei\n\nwill have no recourse and will be unable to enforce its rights against Far East Packaging\n\nand its appointed directors in the Joint Venture Company and Quanzhou Hengwei would not\n\napprove of any such legal action. In those circumstances, it seems to me that there must\n\nbe very compelling reasons why the Joint Venture Company should be refused any leave to\n\ncommence legal proceedings against the wrongdoers and allegedly bad fiduciaries.",
        "Section 216A of the Act": "14        Ordinarily,\n\na company by its majority members or its Board should decide whether to prosecute or\n\ndefend a claim. Occasionally, it is not possible to obtain Board’s approval because\n\nthe potential defendant’s approval is required and it is withheld. That is to be\n\nexpected because a person would not ordinarily authorise its company to sue him. A member\n\nof the company, if he has a legitimate claim, may apply for leave to bring an action in\n\nthe name and on behalf of the company. Under subsection 216A(3) of the Act, however, it\n\nmust be shown that the complainant is acting in good faith and that it appears to be prima\n\nfacie in the interest of the company that the action be brought.15        In this\n\ncase, the first three defendants contend that the ability of the Joint Venture Company to\n\nbring action to recover reflective losses had been authoritatively restated by the House\n\nof Lords inJohnson v Gore Wood & Co (a firm)[2001] 2 WLR 72. Counsel for the\n\nfirst three defendants points out that the alleged losses and damages suffered by the\n\nJoint Venture Company were essentially (if proven) a reduction in the value of its\n\nshareholdings in Quanzhou Hengwei. Such reduction in the value of the shares is a\n\nreflection of the loss suffered by Quanzhou Hengwei. If Quanzhou Hengwei sues and\n\nsuccessfully recovers the losses and damages, then the Joint Venture Company will be fully\n\ncompensated and the value of its shares will remain intact. The House of Lords decided\n\nthat as a matter of policy a shareholder should be precluded from recovering a reflective\n\nloss. As Lord Millet explained, disallowing a corporate claim would prejudice the\n\ncompany’s creditors if the company becomes insolvent as a result of the wrongdoing.\n\nThe interests of other shareholders would also be adversely affected. In addition, the\n\nHouse of Lords disapproved of Johnson challenging ‘in one capacity the adequacy of\n\nthe terms he had agreed in the other’.16        The facts\n\ninJohnson v Gore Wood & Comay be stated briefly. Gore Wood, a firm of\n\nsolicitors, had acted for Johnson’s company, in which he held all but two shares. It\n\nwas alleged that the solicitors had acted negligently and had failed to exercise an option\n\nto purchase the land for Johnson’s company. The company sued the solicitors and it\n\nwas settled by the payment of a large sum to that company. After the payment, Johnson also\n\nclaimed damages for negligence on the ground that the solicitors had also assumed certain\n\nduties towards him as the substantial shareholder. As some of the losses claimed by\n\nJohnson were also losses which his company had suffered and which had been settled, the\n\nsolicitors applied to strike out those claims on the ground that they were reflective\n\nlosses and Johnson was not entitled personally to recover them. The House of Lords struck\n\nout those claims which were reflective losses but allowed the others to go to trial.17        The issue\n\nraised in this case has implications both in principle and in terms of policy. The\n\nprinciples of corporate identity and autonomy are established inSalomon v Salomon[1896] AC 22 andFoss v Harbottle(1843) 2 Hare 461 which decided respectively the\n\ncardinal principles that a duly incorporated company is separate in law from its members\n\nand that the majority of members is entitled to exercise its powers and control its\n\noperations generally. The notable exception to the last named principle is that the\n\nmajority cannot by those powers and control commit a fraud on the minority nor oppress it\n\nby the exercise of those powers and control. The question is under what circumstances it\n\nis right to make an exception and effectively lift the corporate veil with the effect that\n\ninterests of shareholders are identified with those of the company. The New Zealand Court\n\nof Appeal inChristensen v Scott[1996] 1 NZLR 273 and the English Court of Appeal\n\ninBarings plc v Coopers & Lybrand[1997] 1 BCLC 427 had made exceptions to\n\nthose principles of keeping separate a company from its shareholders. In those cases, it\n\nwas respectively decided, inter alia, that a loss suffered by a company could also be\n\nsuffered by an individual shareholder and that a reflective loss may be recoverable by a\n\nshareholder. But the House of Lords inJohnson v Gore Wood & Cohas decided\n\nonly a company can maintain an action to recover reflective losses and that a shareholder\n\nis precluded from doing so.18        Lord\n\nBingham in his leading Speech consideredPrudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman\n\nIndustries Ltd[1982] 1 All ER 354,Barings plc v Coopers & Lybrand and\n\nChristensen v Scottand stated at pp 94E-95B:\"These authorities support the following\n\n    propositions. (1) Where a company suffers loss caused by a breach of duty owed to it, only\n\n    the company may sue in respect of that loss. No action lies at the suit of a shareholder\n\n    suing in that capacity and no other to make good a diminution in the value of the\n\n    shareholder’s shareholding where that merely reflects the loss suffered by the\n\n    company. A claim will not lie by a shareholder to make good a loss which would be made\n\n    good if the company’s assets were replenished through action against the party\n\n    responsible for the loss, even if the company, acting through its constitutions organs,\n\n    has declined or failed to make good that loss. So much is clear fromPrudential\n\n    Assurance Co Ltd v. Newman Industries Ltd (No. 2)[1982] Ch 204, particularly at pp\n\n    222–223,Heron International, particularly at pp 261-262,George Fischer,\n\n    particularly at pp 266 and 270-271, Gerber and Stein v Blake, particularly at pp\n\n    726-729. (2) Where a company suffers loss but has no cause of action to sue to recover\n\n    that loss, the shareholder in the company may sue in respect of it (if the shareholder has\n\n    a cause of action to do so), even though the loss is a diminution in the value of the\n\n    shareholding. This is supported byLee v Sheard[1956] 1 QB 192, 195-196,George\n\n    Fischer and Gerber.(3) Where a company suffers loss caused by a breach of duty to it,\n\n    and a shareholder suffers a loss separate and distinct from that suffered by the company\n\n    caused by breach of a duty independently owed to the shareholder, each may sue to recover\n\n    the loss caused to it by breach of the duty owed to it but neither may recover loss caused\n\n    to the other by breach of the duty owed to that other. I take this to be the effect ofLee\n\n    v Sheard,at pp 195-196,Heron International,particularly at p 262,R P\n\n    Howard,particularly at p 123,Gerber and Stein v Blake,particularly at p 726.\n\n    I do not think the observations of Leggatt LJ inBaringsat p 435 and of the Court\n\n    of Appeal of New Zealand inChristensen v Scottat p 280, lines 25-35, can be\n\n    reconciled with this statement of principle.\"19        Lord\n\nBingham summarised the reasoning at p 95C as follows:\"On the one hand the court must respect the\n\n    principle of company automony, ensure that the company’s creditors are not prejudiced\n\n    by the action of individual shareholders and ensure that a party does not recover\n\n    compensation for a loss which another party has suffered. On the other, the court must be\n\n    astute to ensure that the party who has in fact suffered loss is not arbitrarily denied\n\n    fair compensation. The problem can be resolved only by close scrutiny of the pleadings at\n\n    the strike-out stage and all the proven facts at the trial stage: the object is to\n\n    ascertain whether the loss claimed appears to be or is one which would be made good if the\n\n    company had enforced its full rights against the party responsible, and whether (to use\n\n    the language ofPrudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd (No 2)[1982]     Ch 204, 223) the loss claimed is \"merely a reflection of the loss suffered by the\n\n    company\".In some cases the answer will be clear, as where the shareholder claims\n\n    the loss of dividend or a diminution in the value of a shareholding attributable solely to\n\n    depletion of the company’s assets, or a loss unrelated to the business of the\n\n    company. In other cases, inevitably, a finer judgment will be called for. At the\n\n    strike-out stage any reasonable doubt must be resolved in favour of the claimant.\"20        The\n\nprinciple inJohnson v Gore Wood & Cowas applied recently inShaker v\n\nMohammed Al-Bedrawi[2001] EWHC Ch 159. Mr Justice Lawrence Collins said at paras 28\n\nand 29:\"InJohnson v Gore Woodthe House of Lords\n\n    disapproved the approach of the New Zealand Court of Appeal inChristensen v Scott[1996] 1 NZLR 273 (applied by the Court of Appeal inBarings plc v Coopers &\n\n    Lybrand[1997] 1 BCLC 427) in allowing a personal claim for diminution in the value of\n\n    shares allegedly caused by the negligence of accountants and solicitors in advising on the\n\n    company taking a lease of farm land ... These decisions are disapproved inJohnson v\n\n    Gore Woodby all the members of the House (except Lord Cooke of Thorndon), although it\n\n    is apparent that Lord Hutton did so with some reluctance.\"21        The same\n\nissue arose for consideration inEric Terence Day v James Thomas Gregory Cook[2001] EWCA Viv 592. The question in that case was whether Day could recover damages\n\nagainst his solicitor, Cook, for the loss in value of his shareholding in his principal\n\ntrading company caused by his solicitor’s breach of duty. Lady Justice Arden referred\n\nto Lord Bingham’s speech inJohnsonand said at para 36:\"Lord Goff gave a concurring speech, and\n\n    agreed with Lord Millett’s analysis (below) of the earlier case law. Lord Cooke of\n\n    Thornden concurred in the result, but considered in some cases it was possible that the\n\n    shareholder would suffer additional loss. He cited the case ofChristensen v Scott[1996]     1 NZLR 273, where a shareholder was permitted to pursue a claim for reflective loss after\n\n    the company’s claim had been settled. Lord Hutton agreed with the result, holding\n\n    that the approach inPrudential Assurance v Newmanshould be preferred to that inChristensen\n\n    v Scottas it had stood for almost 20 years.\"Lady Justice Arden continued at paras 38 to 40 as\n\nfollows:\"It will thus be seen from the speeches inJohnson\n\n    v Gore Woodthat where there is a breach of duty to both the shareholder and the\n\n    company and the loss which the shareholder suffers is merely a reflection of the\n\n    company’s loss there is now a clear rule that the shareholder cannot recover. That\n\n    follows from the graphic example of the shareholder who is led to part with the key to the\n\n    company’s money box and the theft of the company’s money from that box. It is\n\n    not simply the case that double recovery will not be allowed, so that, for instance if the\n\n    company’s claim is not pursued or there is some defence to the company’s claim,\n\n    the shareholder can pursue his claim. The company’s claim, if it exists, will always\n\n    trump that of the shareholder. Accordingly the court has no discretion. The claim cannot\n\n    be entertained. The English rule is therefore different from the position in New Zealand:\n\n    seeChristiansen (sic) v Scott,above. Even in the case of owner-managed companies,\n\n    there is no discretion.\"22        Counsel for\n\nthe plaintiffs submitted, in rebuttal, that the facts of the instant case fall within\n\npropositions (2) and (3) of Lord Bingham’s summary inJohnson v Gore Wood & Co.\n\nHe relies on the fact that Quanzhou Hengwei has no cause of action or is unable to enforce\n\nits full rights, for which he relies on the evidence of the expert on Chinese law. I find\n\nconsiderable force behind these submissions, which I accept. The facts in the instant case\n\nfalls within propositions (2) and (3) of Lord Bingham. A litigant is not to be lightly\n\nturned away from bringing a genuine cause before our Courts. A fortiori, if there is no\n\nrisk of double recovery and there is no prejudice to the creditors or shareholders of the\n\ncompany, which has no remedy in any event under Chinese law, the policy reasons behind the\n\ndecision inJohnson v Gore Wood & Codo not apply. Accordingly, the Joint\n\nVenture Company as the sole shareholder of Quanzhou Hengwei has the right and title to\n\nbring the action to recover the claims. Whether it succeeds or not depends on the evidence\n\nit can gather and present to Court. There is a prima facie case. The application is\n\nallowed. There will be an order in terms of prayers 1, 2, 3 and 5 set out in the\n\nOriginating Summons. Other prayers regarding the future conduct and costs of the\n\nproceedings are adjourned for further consideration. Parties are also directed to settle\n\nthe draft orders of Court for my approval.Sgd:Lai Kew ChaiJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
