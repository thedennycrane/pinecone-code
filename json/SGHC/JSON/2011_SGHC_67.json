        "Introduction": "1       The first accused (“Somchit”) and\n                    second accused (“Quek”) were jointly charged with an offence under\n                    s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185,\n                    2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). The charge (“First\n                    Charge”) read as follows: That you,1.    Phuthita\n                                                Somchit3.    Quek\n                                                Hock Lye,   on or about the 3rd day of October 2008 in Singapore, together with one\n                        Winai Phutthaphan, were parties to a criminal conspiracy, and in such\n                        capacity, agreed and engaged with one another to do an illegal act, namely,\n                        to traffic in diamorphine, a controlled drug specified in Class A of the\n                        First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the\n                        Act”), without any authorization under the Act or the Regulations\n                        made thereunder, whereby the said Phuthita Somchit was in possession ofnot less than 62.14 grams of diamorphineat Block 21 Bedok Reservoir View #01-02, Aquarius by the Park, Singapore,\n                        for the purpose of trafficking in pursuance of the said conspiracy, an\n                        offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Act, and you\n                        have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 120B of the Penal\n                        Code (Cap 224) read with section 33 of the Act. 2       At the commencement of the trial, the\n                    prosecution applied to stand down a second charge against Quek under the same\n                    provisions of the Act, which I allowed. The prosecution and both counsel for\n                    Somchit and Quek tendered a statement of agreed facts (“SAF”)\n                    pursuant to s 376(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev\n                    Ed) (“CPC”). The effect of this was that the facts stated in the\n                    SAF were conclusively proved in this trial. I set out below the SAF in its\n                    entirety (incorporating amendments made at the end of the first day of the\n                    trial): THE ACCUSED PERSONS 1.    The accused persons are: (a)    Phuthita Somchit, a female Thai National / 34\n                            years old, FIN No. G9046929R (“Somchit”); and (b)    Quek Hock Lye, a male Singaporean / 44 years old,\n                            NRIC No. S1680916J (“Quek”). 2.    The accomplice is Winai Phutthaphan, a male Thai\n                            National / 25 years old, FIN No. G9046933P (“Winai”). 3.    Somchit is Quek’s girlfriend.

He\n                            had done this by using his forged driving licence under the name of\n                            “Lim Chay Yong”. He had also informed the landlord that\n                            Somchit and one Wannarat Tancharoen will also be staying at the unit. He\n                            had produced photocopies of their passports as well as his forged\n                            driving licence, which were then attached to the lease\n                        agreement. 6.    Investigations further revealed that Quek had asked\n                            Winai to move into Block 21 Bedok Reservoir View #01-02 on the day\n                            before 3 October 2008. EVENTS LEADING TO THE ARREST 7.    On 3 October 2008, at about 7.45 p.m., a team of\n                            officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”)\n                            consisting of Assistant Superintendent of Police Tai Kwong Yong\n                            (“ASP Tai”), Station Inspector Neo Han Siong (“SI\n                            Neo”), Senior Staff Sergeant Pang Hee Lim Joe (“SSSgt Joe\n                            Pang”) and Staff Sergeant Yeo Kheng Wei Daniel (“SSgt\n                            Daniel Yeo”) arrestedQueknext to\n                            his rented vehicle, a red colour car SJJ 2514A (“the\n                            car”), which was parked next to the badminton hall along Pine\n                            Lane, Singapore. 8.    AfterQuekwas\n                            arrested, ASP Tai opened the rear left door of the car and saw a\n                            “Nokia” handphone box on the floor mat on the floorboard.\n                            ASP Tai then placed it back on the floor mat. The team of CNB officers\n                            then escortedQuekto the multi-storey car\n                            park at Block 56A, Cassia Crescent, to conduct a search on him and the\n                            car.

ASP Tai and SI Neo recovered, amongst other things,\n                            cash amounting to a total of S$5948.00, from various parts of the\n                            car. 10.    SSSgt Joe Pang also searched and recovered one (1)\n                            bunch of four (4) keys attached to a key tag with the words “21\n                            Aquarius #01-02” written on it fromQuek’strousers’ pocket.Quekwas questioned on the exact address to which the\n                            keys belonged, but he did not reveal the address. SSSgt Joe Pang then\n                            handed the keys over to ASP Tai, who reported to CNB Headquarters\n                            (“HQ”) about the keys. ASP Tai’s team of CNB\n                            officers subsequently received instructions to proceed to Block 21,\n                            Bedok Reservoir View, #01-02, Aquarius by the Park (“the\n                            unit”) to conduct a raid. 11.    Other CNB officers consisting of Woman Assistant\n                            Superintendent of Police Tan Siew Fong (“W/ASP Tan”),\n                            Senior Staff Sergeant Chong Wee Loong Henry (“SSSgt Henry\n                            Chong”) and Sergeant Low Yew Weng James (“Sgt James\n                            Low”) had also arrived at the multi-storey car park at Block 56A,\n                            Cassia Crescent, to provide reinforcement to ASP Tai’s\n                            team. 12.    On the same day (3 October 2008), at about 8.45\n                            p.m., the CNB officers escortedQuekand\n                            reached Block 21, Aquarius by the Park, Bedok Reservoir View. Thereat,\n                            ASP Tai tasked SI Neo and SSSgt Joe Pang to proceed to check out the\n                            unit discreetly. SSSgt Joe Pang subsequently spottedWinaiat the door to the unit. However, when Winai saw\n                            SSSgt Joe Pang, Winai quickly turned and walked away from the door of\n                            the unit. SSSgt Joe Pang and SI Neo Han Siong (“SI Neo”)\n                            then proceeded to follow Winai, and they reported this over the radio\n                            set. 13.    ASP Tai then proceeded to raid the unit with W/ASP\n                            Tan, SSSgt Henry Chong and Sgt James Low. They gained access to the unit\n                            by using the bunch of keys that had been recovered fromQuekearlier. SSgt Daniel Yeo was guardingQuekin the car during this\n                            time. 14.    After entering the unit, the CNB officers arrestedSomchit, as well as one Wannarat\n                            Tancharoen (FIN No.: G9046930X) and one Samruai Phutthawan (FIN No.:\n                            G9046931U) within the unit. 15.    Meanwhile, SSSgt Joe Pang and SI Neo had arrestedWinainear the poolside.

The urine samples of all\n                            three of them were tested negative for morphine. 3       The prosecution called a total of 45 witnesses\n                    to give evidence on its behalf. At the end of the prosecution’s case, I\n                    found that aprima faciecase had been made\n                    against Somchit and Quek and called upon them to give evidence in their defence.\n                    Somchit elected to give evidence as well as call witnesses to give evidence in\n                    her defence. Quek elected to remain silent. Before going further, it should be\n                    clarified that Somchit also refers to Quek as “Wan” and Winai\n                    Phutthaphan (“Winai”) as “Od”.",
        "The case for and against Somchit": "4       The following were the evidence against Somchit.\n                    124 packets of white granular substance comprising not less than 62.14 grams of\n                    diamorphine (“the seized drugs”) were found at Block 21 Bedok\n                    Reservoir View #01-02 Aquarius by the Park (“Bedok Condominium”),\n                    where Somchit resided. Somchit admitted to being in possession of the seized\n                    drugs, and in any event, that was clear from the evidence. Not only did Somchit\n                    know of the existence of the seized drugs, she was also the one who handed the\n                    Nokia Speaker Box (A1) to Winai and the one who kept the white bag (B1). By\n                    operation of s 18(2) of the Act, Somchit was “presumed to have known\n                    the nature” of the seized drugs. As far as trafficking was concerned,\n                    Somchit readily admitted her involvement with Quek’s drug\n                        dealings[note: 1]. She\n                    was involved in the packing process, took orders from customers, instructed\n                    Winai to deliver packets of drugs to customers, and kept records of the sales.\n                    However Somchit denied knowledge that the seized drugs were diamorphine. The\n                    sole issue, as far as Somchit was concerned, was whether she had rebutted the\n                    presumption in s 18(2) of the Act.",
        "Somchit’s statements to the Central Narcotics Bureau\n                (“CNB”)": "5       Somchit made a number of statements to the CNB\n                    officers from the time she was arrested. On the night of the arrest\n                    (3 October 2008), W/ASP Tan Siew Fong (“W/ASP Tan”)\n                    questioned her on various items in the Bedok Condominium. A Thai interpreter,\n                    Orawan Triteeyaprasert (PW40), interpreted from English to Thai and vice versa.\n                    The following is an extract from the question and answer record, which was given\n                    within three hours of her apprehension: Q6:What do the customer(s) buy from\n                            ‘Wan’? A6:White-colour Q7:What do you mean by white colour? A7:I do not know what is the white colour.\n                            ‘Wan’ only engage me to help him pack into smaller packets\n                            and he will pay me for the work. 6       At 6.31am on 4 October 2008, at the\n                    CNB headquarters, after she was charged, Somchit said as follows in answer to\n                    it: I know the white colour item is one kind of drug which is controlled.\n                        However I do not know what is the effect of the drug and I also do not know\n                        how heavy of the sentence for the offence. My boyfriend told me if anything\n                        happen regarding the drug it will have no problem for me, the worst they\n                        will just send me back to Thailand and he will admit that all the drug\n                        belong to him. This is the reason why I help him. 7       Somchit subsequently gave a number of long\n                    statements to the CNB, all of which she agreed to admit in evidence. In relation\n                    to the issue of her knowledge of the nature of the seized drugs, the following\n                    are relevant: (a)    Statement recorded on 6 October 2008 at\n                            3.30pm 5    … I do know that the white substance are\n                            drugs but I do not know exactly what type of drugs it is. I ever asked\n                            my boyfriend what drug is that but my boyfriend told me that I do not\n                            need to know. (b)    Statement recorded on 7 October 2008 at\n                            10.55am 15    … When I saw the white colour substance, I\n                            asked ‘Wan’ what it is the white colour substance and he\n                            answered me that this is his job … 16    … ‘Wan’ did not tell me what the\n                            white colour substance is but I think it is drugs because once\n                            ‘Wan’ came home, he asked me to closed [sic] up everything.\n                            I suspect the reason for doing this is that substance he brought back is\n                            illegal. (c)    Statement recorded on 7 October 2008 at\n                            2.45pm 18    After the first time I saw ‘Wan’ packed\n                            the white substance, he did not bring home anymore white substance until\n                            2 days later. About 2 days later ‘Wan’ came home with a\n                            shopping bag … I asked ‘Wan’ if he need me to help\n                            him pack white substance and he say ‘Ok’. I know that the\n                            white substance is a kind of drug because when ‘Wan’ brought\n                            home this kind of white colour substance the first time, I did ask him\n                            if it is drugs and he say ‘Yes’. … 23    … When I came to know that the white\n                            substance is drugs, I did inform ‘Od’ that what he is\n                            carrying is drugs. I told him to finish up his visa make some money for\n                            the time being and go back to Thailand when his visa\n                        expired. (d)    Statement recorded on 16 January 2009 at\n                            10.00am 42    I am asked with regards to paragraph 16, what do I\n                            mean by close everything when Wan comes home with the white colour\n                            substance. I mean to say he will ask me to close the curtains and check\n                            that the main door was locked. In the same paragraph, I had also said\n                            that I suspected that the reason that he did this was because the\n                            substance was illegal. I am asked why I had not left him, left the place\n                            or reported to the police if I had suspected that the things were\n                            illegal. Actually, I wanted to leave him. However, I had no money and I\n                            still depended on him for my livelihood. Secondly, I still loved him.\n                            Thirdly, I thought it was not a very serious matter as Wan did not\n                            appear that he was afraid. He behaved normally. 43    I am asked if I had suspected that the white\n                            substance were drugs. I suspected that they were because Wan always told\n                            [me] not to let anybody see the white substances. But I do not know what\n                            time of drugs they were… 44    With regards to paragraph 23 of my statement, I\n                            said that I had told Od that he was carrying drugs. I decided to tell\n                            him as I wanted to let him make his own decision as to whether to\n                            continue working or to stop, and I will respect his decision. He was\n                            surprised when I told him that he was carrying drugs, but he was not\n                            angry. Od did ask me if they are really drugs, and I replied that I\n                            think so. He then told me to let him continue working till his visa\n                            expired and he will go back. He told [me] that at least he can have some\n                            money to return home. He also told me to go back together with him as he\n                            was worried about me. I had intended to go back with him and not return\n                            to Singapore anymore. He also asked me if I was scared and I said I was.\n                            When he said scared, he meant how are our families to survive if\n                            something happened to us. … 49    I am asked if I had I [sic] ever told Od that what\n                            he was carrying were herbs. I am not sure, but I am very sure that\n                            eventually, I had told him that the white substance are drugs\n                            …",
        "Somchit’s evidence at trial": "8       Somchit related her background[note: 2].\n                    She was born in 1975 and had only completed primary school after which she went\n                    out to work. She first worked as a masseuse and then turned to prostitution. She\n                    had married a man but subsequently divorced him. She has two sons, presently\n                    aged 19 and 17. This meant that she became a mother at the age of 15 or 16\n                    years. She had at some stage visited London for a short period, where she worked\n                    as a prostitute. Around 2004, she came to Singapore, also to work as a\n                    prostitute. She would remain here for two weeks to a month each time, until her\n                    social visit pass expired. She plied the alleys of Geylang, earning about $2,500\n                    to $3,000 per month. This was her source of income out of which she supported\n                    her mother, two sons, a niece and nephew. Her family members were not aware that\n                    she was working as a prostitute. Quek was one of her clients; she had first met\n                    him around June 2007. Shortly thereafter, they took a liking to each other\n                    and Somchit stopped working as a prostitute when Quek offered to take care of\n                    her. Since then, Somchit would travel back and forth from Thailand and live with\n                    Quek whenever she was in Singapore. Quek was supportive both of Somchit and her\n                    family in Thailand – he gave her an average of $2,000 a month and even\n                    conversed over the telephone with the members of her family. Their relationship\n                    progressed to the point where they discussed marriage. Sometime in the middle of\n                    August 2008, Somchit arranged for her nephew, Winai, to come to Singapore\n                    to work for Quek. Quek agreed to pay him 25,000 baht (equivalent to S$1,000) a\n                    month. Winai came to Singapore on 24 August 2008[note: 3](Somchit was not in\n                    Singapore at that time). 9       Somchit recounted her first encounters with\n                    Quek’s drug dealings[note: 4]. She returned to Singapore on\n                    28 August 2008. The first time she saw the drugs Quek dealt with\n                    (which turned out to be diamorphine) was a few days after moving into the Bedok\n                    Condominium on 6 September 2008. Quek asked her to close the door and\n                    windows. They then went into the study room and Quek took a black bundle out of\n                    a plastic bag. Quek walked to the kitchen, and cut open the black bundle which\n                    contained a white substance which he then poured into a bowl and started\n                    repacking into other packets. Due to the surreptitious circumstances, Somchit\n                    suspected that the white substance was illegal and asked Quek if it was a drug\n                    and he admitted that it was. Somchit then contacted Winai and informed him that\n                    Quek was dealing with “yaaseptit”\n                    (which she understood to mean narcotic or illegal drug). Somchit told Winai that\n                    they should go back to Thailand after their visa expired. Subsequently, on a\n                    second occasion, Somchit again questioned Quek if the white substance was a drug\n                    and Quek again admitted that it was. Somchit asked Quek what type of drug it\n                    was. Quek did not tell her the name of the drug, but told her it was a\n                    “not serious drug” and that if anything were to happen, she would\n                    be sent back to Thailand. Upon hearing Quek’s assurance, Somchit\n                    volunteered her help with the packing of the drugs. 10     When asked by counsel why she believed\n                    Quek’s representations, Somchit stated the following[note: 5]: QOkay. When he told you it was not a serious drug and\n                            he said won’t have serious effect on you, did you trust\n                            him? AYes, I believe him. QWhy did you believe him? ABecause the first time when I asked him, he told me\n                            it’s yaaseptit. Second time, he also answered me yaaseptit. He\n                            never lie to me. That’s why I trust him. ... QIf your boyfriend has told you this was medicine ---\n                            ... or flour --- ... would you have believed him? AI --- I won’t believe him. Somchit also answered to the following when asked by\n                        counsel[note: 6]: QIf your boyfriend ... had told you, “No, this\n                            is a serious drug” ... would you have volunteered to help him\n                            pack? ANo, I--- I don’t think so. ... Q... And if it was --- he told you it was serious\n                            drug, what would you have told him? AIf he were to --- told me that this was a serious\n                            drug, I would tell him to stop and talk about it, “since you have\n                            future with me”. Finally, Somchit testified that while she had heard of other drugs\n                    which in Thai she referred to as “Yaba” and “Ganja”,\n                    she had no knowledge of “Phong Khaou”, which the Thai interpreter\n                    explained was the Thai term for heroin[note: 7].",
        "Winai’s evidence": "11     The third person to the alleged conspiracy,\n                    Winai, gave evidence for the prosecution. Having heard his evidence which was\n                    also tested during cross-examination, I found it to be inconsistent in parts.\n                    For example, Winai initially testified that Somchit never told him that the\n                    drugs wereyaaseptit(the Thai interpreter\n                    explained that this was a general term for narcotic or illegal drug). However,\n                    subsequently, he claimed that he could not remember if she did[note: 8]. Another\n                    example related to whether Winai made any drug deliveries for Quek between\n                    26-28 August 2008,iethe two days\n                    during which Winai was alone in Singapore with Quek. Winai stated in his\n                    statement to the CNB[note: 9](dated\n                    8 October 2008) that because he could not understand Quek’s\n                    instructions, he refused to make any deliveries. At trial, Winai testified that\n                    in fact, he did make deliveries when he understood Quek’s instructions or\n                    when Somchit translated Quek’s instructions to him by phone.[note: 10]When\n                    cross-examined on the apparent inconsistency, Winai explained that when his\n                    statement was being recorded, he informed the interpreter and recording officer\n                    that he did make deliveries.[note: 11]Nevertheless, even taking\n                    Winai’s statement at its highest, two points may be noted. The first was\n                    that at no time did Winai allege that Somchit knew that the drugs they dealt\n                    with were heroin. The second was that Winai consistently stated that he was\n                    asked to make drug deliveries by Quek. These points will be further discussed\n                    below.",
        "The prosecution’s submissions": "12     The prosecution submitted that Somchit had\n                    failed to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the Act. Firstly, the\n                    prosecution submitted that the relevant authorities supported the first\n                    interpretation ofTan Kiam Peng v Public\n                        Prosecutor[2008] 1 SLR(R) 1(“Tan Kiam Peng”)iethat the prosecution need only to prove that the accused knew that he or she was\n                    in possession of a controlled drug (see below at[19]). Since Somchit admitted that she knew the seized drugs\n                    were illegal, on this interpretation, the prosecution would have proven the\n                    charge beyond reasonable doubt. 13     Secondly, in any case, Somchit had actual\n                    knowledge that she was dealing in diamorphine: (a)     Somchit knew and referred to the\n                        seized drugs as the “white substance” or “white\n                        one”, which were common parlance for diamorphine. (b)     When Somchit informed Winai that they\n                        were dealing with drugs, he asked her if she was scared and she said that\n                        she was; this suggested that Somchit knew that the drugs she was dealing in\n                        attracted severe penalties under the law. (c)     Somchit was intimately involved with the\n                        trafficking process. Not only did she pack the drugs into 8-gram packets, as\n                        was the market practice for selling diamorphine, she also dealt directly\n                        with customers. Furthermore, she knew that the drugs were sold at a high\n                        price (between S$240 to S$320 per packet) and she was remunerated\n                        lucratively for her work. (d)     Somchit was not a stranger to controlled drugs. She\n                        consumed methamphetamine (“Ice”) and was introduced to\n                        nimetazepam (“Erimin 5”) by Quek. It would have been odd that\n                        when it came to diamorphine, Quek did not even mention its name to her. She\n                        had also witnessed firsthand the way by which it was consumed by Quek and\n                        the effects it had on him. Given the intimacy of their relationship, as\n                        Somchit had claimed, there was no reason why Quek would refrain from\n                        referring to the drugs as “peh\n                        hoon” or withhold from her the fact that it was\n                        diamorphine. (e)     It\n                        was inconceivable that during the period in which she assisted Quek, which\n                        lasted almost one month, Somchit had never heard Quek refer to the drugs as\n                            “peh\n                    hoon”. From the above, the prosecution\n                    submitted that Somchit was not an innocent courier in a one-off transaction.\n                    Instead, she was intimately involved in the entire transaction and her behaviour\n                    suggested that she must have known the nature of the seized drugs. Furthermore,\n                    the prosecution submitted that Somchit’s claim that Quek had told her that\n                    the drugs he dealt with were “not serious” drugs was an\n                    after-thought, which she did not mention in any of her nine statements to the\n                    CNB officers (comprising of contemporaneous statements, cautioned statement and\n                    long statements). Likewise, it was not apparent from Winai’s evidence that\n                    Somchit thought that the drugs were “not serious”. 14     Thirdly, even if she did not have actual\n                    knowledge that the seized drugs were diamorphine, she was at least wilfully\n                    blind as to its nature. In particular, the circumstances surrounding the drug\n                    dealings were suspicious. For example, Quek had asked her to lock the doors,\n                    close the windows and draw the curtains when he packed drugs in the Bedok\n                    Condominium. Furthermore, Somchit was not a stranger to drugs, and knew that it\n                    was illegal to deal in controlled drugs. In fact, she was worried when she first\n                    learnt that Quek dealt with controlled drugs. Against this backdrop, although\n                    she had opportunities to probe furtheregby\n                    asking Quek or the customers, she chose to turn a blind eye and was content to\n                    rely on Quek’s answers without attempting further to ascertain the true\n                    nature of the drugs.",
        "The defence’s submissions": "15     The defence submitted that Somchit had\n                    rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the Act. Firstly, the defence\n                    submitted that Somchit did not have actual knowledge of the nature of the seized\n                    drugs. In her statements to the CNB officers and her testimony in court\n                    subsequently, Somchit freely and readily admitted to her involvement in the\n                    trafficking process, but did not at any point concede that she knew that the\n                    drugs she dealt with was diamorphine. In fact, Somchit’s statements to the\n                    CNB were consistent with her defence at trial. Furthermore, neither\n                    Winai’s evidence nor Quek’s statements to the CNB suggested that\n                    Somchit was aware of the nature of the seized drugs. Secondly, the defence\n                    submitted that Somchit was not “wilfully blind” but\n                    “rendered blind” by her trust in Quek and her belief in the\n                    representations made by Quek. Somchit had no reason to disbelieve Quek as he\n                    treated her well, and did not conceal the fact that the drugs he dealt with were\n                    a controlled drug.",
        "The law": "16     Subsections (1) and (2) of s 18 of the\n                    Act provide as follows: (1)    Any person who is\n                            proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control\n                            — (a)    anything containing a controlled\n                            drug; (b)    the keys of anything containing a controlled\n                                drug; (c)    the keys of any place or premises or any part\n                                thereof in which a controlled drug is found; or (d)    a document of title relating to a controlled\n                                drug or any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled\n                                drug, shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug\n                            in his possession. (2)    Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a\n                            controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved,\n                            be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. These provisions establish two presumptions in the law. The first\n                    is the presumption of possession in s 18(1) of the Act. Any person who is\n                    proved to have in his possession, custody or control anything containing a\n                    controlled drug or the keys to anything, place or premises which contain a\n                    controlled drug, shall be presumed to have had that drug in his possession. This\n                    presumption extends to possession of any document intended for delivery of a\n                    controlled drug. The second is the presumption of knowledge – once\n                    possession is proved or presumed under s 18(1), s 18(2) of the Act\n                    operates to presume that the person knew the nature of that drug. The effect of\n                    this is to place on the accused the burden of proving, on a balance of\n                    probability, that he did not know the “nature of the\n                drug”. 17     I first consideredWarner v\n                        Metropolitan Police Commissioner[1969] 2 AC 256(“Warner”), the English\n                    authority that had spawned the precedents in Singapore on s 18 of the Act.\n                    The appellant inWarnerhad picked up two parcels\n                    from a cafe which he believed had contained scent. However one parcel contained\n                    amphetamine sulphate tablets, a substance specified in the Schedule to the Drugs\n                    (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964 (c 64) (“the 1964 Drugs Act”)\n                    and possession of which would, without lawful authority, be an offence under\n                    s 1(1). The point of law that was stated by the English Court of Appeal to\n                    the House of Lords was: [w]hether for the purposes of section 1 of the [1964 Drugs Act], a\n                        defendant is deemed to be in possession of a prohibited substance when to\n                        his knowledge he is in physical possession of the substance but is unaware\n                        of its true nature. The House ruled, by a majority, that s 1 of the 1964 Drugs Act\n                    was an absolute offence and a person in possession of any of the scheduled drugs\n                    without lawful authority commits an offence even if he had no knowledge that it\n                    was a scheduled drug. In his judgment, Lord Pearce said (at 304–306) that\n                    parliamentary intention in the 1964 Drugs Act was to prevent or curtail the drug\n                    traffic and the term “possession” must not be construed so\n                    narrowly “as to stultify the practical efficacy of the Act or so broad\n                    that its creates absurdity or injustice.” He reasoned that it could not\n                    have been intended to be a defence for an unauthorised person to show that he\n                    possessed the drugs for a laudable purpose but on the other hand, it could not\n                    have been the intention that a person would be guilty if he did not know he had\n                    the thing at all. Lord Pearce concluded that “possession” would\n                    exclude the situation where the thing had been planted on him without his\n                    knowledge, but it would cover one in which the person had knowledge of the\n                    existence of the thing itself but not its qualities. In relation to things in\n                    containers, Lord Pearce said as follows at 305-306: The situation with regard to containers presents further problems. If a\n                        man is in possession of the contents of a package, prima facie his\n                        possession of the package leads to the strong inference that he is in\n                        possession of its contents. But can this be rebutted by evidence that he was\n                        mistaken as to its contents? As in the case of goods that have been\n                        \"planted\" in his pocket without his knowledge, so I do not think that he is\n                        in possession of contents which are quite different in kind from what he\n                        believed. Thus the prima facie assumption is discharged if he proves (or\n                        raises a real doubt in the matter) either (a) that he was a servant or\n                        bailee who had no right to open itandno\n                        reason to suspect that its contents were illicit or were drugs or (b) that\n                        although he was the owner he had no knowledge of (including a genuine\n                        mistake as to) its actual contents or of their illicit nature and that he\n                        received them innocently and also that he had had no reasonable opportunity\n                        since receiving the package of acquainting himself with its actual contents.\n                        For a man takes over a package or suitcase at risk as to its contents being\n                        unlawful if he does not immediately examine it (if he is entitled to do so).\n                        As soon as may be he should examine it and if he finds the contents\n                        suspicious reject possession by either throwing them away or by taking\n                        immediate sensible steps for their disposal. So to read the Act would, I think, accord with what Parliament intended\n                        and would give it a sense which would accord with the practical views of a\n                        jury, although I realise that a deeper investigation of the legal\n                        implications of possession might support various differing views. It would\n                        leave some unfortunate victims of circumstances who move innocently but\n                        rashly in shady surroundings and who carry packages or tablets for strangers\n                        or unreliable friends. But I think even they would have an opportunity of\n                        ventilating their story and in some cases, if innocent of any knowledge and\n                        bad motives, obtaining an acquittal. Some of the persons in some of the\n                        rather far-fetched circumstances which have been envisaged in argument would\n                        still be left in difficulties. But I do not think that Parliament intended\n                        to cater for them in its efforts to stop a serious evil. [emphasis in original] 18     InTan Ah Tee and another v\n                        Public Prosecutor[1979-1980] SLR(R) 311\n                        (“Tan Ah Tee”), the second\n                    appellant claimed that she did not know that the contents of the plastic bag she\n                    was carrying were diamorphine. Her contention before the Court of Appeal\n                    (“CA”) was that she had proved, on a balance of probabilities,\n                    that “she did not have possession under the Act of the contents of the\n                    plastic bag and did not know the nature of its contents” (at[18]). A major issue before the CA was the\n                    presumption of possession in s 16(1) of the Act (now s 18(1)). The\n                    court referred to the speech of Lord Pearce inWarnerand concluded as follows at [25]-[26]: 25    In our opinion the word “possession”\n                            in the Act should be construed as that word has been construed by Lord\n                            Pearce and we would respectfully adopt his reasons as contained in his\n                            speech. There is, however, one qualification because of the statutory\n                            presumptions in the Act. Under our Act where a person is in possession\n                            of a bag or package which contains in fact a controlled drug it is\n                            presumed that he is in possession of and knows the nature of the\n                            controlled drug unlike in the United Kingdom where there is only aprima faciestrong inference that he\n                            is in possession of its contents. Thus under our Act the burden rests on\n                            him to prove on a balance of probabilities that he was not in possession\n                            of and did not know the nature of the controlled drug which was\n                            contained in the package or bag. 26    For all these reasons the appeals of both\n                            appellants are dismissed. 19     It should be noted that the CA inTan Ah Teedealt only with the presumption of possession\n                    in s 18(1) of the Act. There was no discussion on the nature of the\n                    presumption in s 18(2) andTan Ah Teeis not\n                    authority on this presumption. InTan Kiam Peng,\n                    the CA discussed the interpretation of s 18(2). The court set out, at [80]\n                    and [81] of the grounds of decision, the two possibilities as to the nature of\n                    the knowledge that the accused is presumed to have,viz: (a)     the accused is presumed to have\n                        known that the drug concerned was a controlled drug (“the first\n                        interpretation”); or (b)     the accused is presumed to have known that the drug\n                        concerned was not only a controlled drug, but was the specific drug for\n                        which he was charged (“the second\n                    interpretation”). 20     The CA noted that the decided cases supported\n                    the first interpretation, and made the following observations at [85]-[87] of\n                    the grounds of decision: 85    Let us, however, now\n                            turn to thecase lawwhich, as we shall\n                            see, supports the first interpretation - especially when viewed inthe context of the underlying policy of the Act\n                                itself. 86    In this\n                            court's decision inFun Seong Cheng… the following passage from Lord Pearce's judgment inWarner(… at 305) was cited …\n                            : One may, therefore, exclude from the ‘possession’ intended\n                            by the Act the physical control of articles which have been\n                            ‘planted’ on him without his knowledge.But how much further is one to go? If one goes to the extreme\n                                length of requiring the prosecution to prove that\n                                ‘possession’ implies a full knowledge of the name and\n                                nature of the drug concerned, the efficacy of the Act is seriously\n                                impaired, since many drug pedlars may in truth be unaware of this. I\n                                think that the term ‘possession’ is satisfied by a\n                                knowledge only of the existence of the thing itself and not its\n                                qualities... 87    The above\n                            observations by Lord Pearce, cited and adopted by this court inFun Seong Cheng, clearlyexcludethe need by the prosecution to prove\n                            that the accused knew of theprecise\n                                natureof the drug; the prosecution need only prove that\n                            the accused knew that the drug is (in the Singapore context) a\n                            controlled drug. This would, in fact, be an appropriate juncture to\n                            emphasise that this basic approach was not only embodied within the\n                            quotation above but generally withinWarneritself - a point which emerges from our analysis\n                            ofWarnerabove … Indeed, the court\n                            inFun Seong Chengproceeded to point out\n                            … thatthisparticular meaning of\n                            possession (enunciated by,inter alia,\n                            Lord Pearce inWarner) had in fact been\n                            adopted by this court as well in the earlier decision ofTan Ah Tee …see also the decision of\n                            this court inGulam bin Notan Mohd Shariff Jamalddin\n                                v PP[1999] 1 SLR(R) 498 at [66]).Tan Ah Teeis, in fact, a seminal decision where\n                            the court cited, in addition to the observations quoted above,in extensofrom the judgment of Lord Pearce inWarner. As we have already emphasised\n                            … to the extent that the court inWarnerwas dealing with thegeneral\n                                conceptofpossession, thenthatapproach (adopted, as we have just seen, inTan\n                                Ah Teeas well as other Singapore decisions) clearly\n                            supports the view that s 18(2)doesnot\n                            refer to thespecificdrug in question\n                            but, rather, simply to controlled drugs generally. Indeed, Lord Pearce's\n                            views inWarner… find a similar\n                            expression in Lord Guest's observations in the same case, as follows\n                            (… at 301): If the correct interpretation of section 1 [of the 1964 UK Act] is\n                            that the prosecution are required to prove knowledge by the accused of\n                            the existence of the substance this will be, in my view,a drug pedlar's charter in which a successful prosecution\n                                will be well-nigh impossible in the case of the trafficker who\n                                conceals the drugs and on questioning remains silent or at any rate\n                                refuses to disclose the origin of the drug. ... If, therefore, this\n                                is not an absolute offence the prosecution will, in my view, require\n                                to establish knowledge by the accused not only of possession of the\n                                actual substance but also knowledge of the nature of the substance,\n                                namely, that it is a prohibited drug under the Act. This would, in\n                                my view, lead to wide-scale evasion of the Act. Interestingly and perhaps even significantly, this particular approach\n                        towards the concept of possession has apparently beenretained in the UK context, despite the presence of a quite\n                        different statutory regime to that which existed at the timeWarnerwas decided: see, for example, the English\n                        Court of Appeal decisions ofMcNamara…\n                        at 251-252;R v Gareth Edmund Lewis(1988) 87\n                        Cr App R 270 at 276 andJohn A Leeson v R[1999] EWCA Crim 2176 (\"Leeson\"); as well as the House of Lords decisions ofR v Boyesen[1982] AC 768 at\n                        773-774 andRegina v Lambert[2002]\n                        2 AC 545, especially at [16], [56]-[59], [61]-[71], [120]-[123] and [126] (cfalso s 28(3)(a) of the 1971 UK Act itself as well asFortson… especially at paras 3-67-3-76) and Robert\n                        Ribeiro & John Perry, ”Possession and Section 28 of the Misuse of\n                        Drugs Act 1971” [1979] Crim LR 90, especially at 100-101). [emphasis in original] 21     However, the CA inTan Kiam\n                        Pengalso observed (at [84]) that simply looking at the ordinary\n                    meaning of the words “the nature of that drug” in s 18(2) of\n                    the Act, the second interpretation must prevail. Although the CA did not make a\n                    conclusive finding on the interpretation of s 18(2), it made clear that it\n                    preferred the second interpretation,iethat the\n                    accused must have knowledge of the nature of the drug. The CA said as follows at\n                    [90]-[93] and [95]: (c)The second interpretation 90    As already mentioned above, the key argument in\n                            favour of the second interpretation (that the reference to knowledge in\n                            s 18(2) of the Act is to knowledge that the drug concerned isnot onlya controlled drugbut is alsothespecific\n                                drugwhich it turns out the accused was in possession of)\n                            is theliteral wordingof s 18(2) itself.\n                            However, as we have also seen, the literal wording of this provision is\n                            also (at least arguably) consistent with acontraryinterpretation ... More importantly, we have\n                            also referred to the fact that the second interpretation would tend tounderminethe general policy of the\n                            Act itself. 91    In summary, it would appear that there are fewer\n                            arguments that support the second interpretation. The fact that an\n                            accused charged under the Act might receive very harsh punishments is,in and of itself, not conclusive.\n                            However, it does not thereby follow that this particular fact is wholly\n                            irrelevant. Whatisofdirectrelevance for the purposes of the present issue\n                            is this: That where the possible punishments are harsh and may even\n                            result in the imposition of the death penalty, the fact that anambiguity in the statutory languageexists (thus giving rise to these two possible interpretations) does\n                            tend to suggest that the benefit of the doubt ought to be given to the\n                            accused in the light of the fact that adoption of the first\n                            interpretation would tend, on balance, to work against him or her\n                            … Indeed, the present appeal is precisely one such instance. In\n                            this regard, it is important to note that the very strict approach inWarner, albeit general in nature, was\n                            adopted in the context of punishments that were less harsh than those\n                            under the Act, and which certainly did not include the death penalty. In\n                            our view, this particular argument appears to be the strongest in so far\n                            as support for the second interpretation is concerned. Indeed, it might\n                            even be argued that there is no ambiguity in the statutory language and\n                            that the literal language is, instead and in addition to the argument\n                            just mentioned, the strongest argument in favour of the second\n                            interpretation. We also pause to observe that there has been, to the\n                            best of our knowledge, no local decision that has in fact adopted the\n                            first interpretation. (d)Conclusion 92    Unfortunately, no detailed argument with respect to\n                            which of these two interpretations was to be preferred was proffered by\n                            counsel before this court. 93    In the circumstances, we cannot - and ought not to\n                            - express a definitive conclusion. This being the case, and in fairness\n                            to the appellant, our analysis and decision will proceed on the footing\n                            that the second interpretation applies (which interpretation in fact\n                            constituted the nub of his argument before this court). ... 95    However, given the specific language of s 18(2) of\n                            the Act, the need (given the extreme penalties prescribed by the Act) to\n                            resolve any ambiguities in interpretation (if they exist) in favour of\n                            the accused, as well as the fact that no case has (to the best of our\n                            knowledge) adopted the first interpretation, it would appear, in our\n                            view, that (whilst not expressing a conclusive view in the absence of\n                            detailed argument) the second interpretation appears to be the more\n                            persuasive one and … will in fact be adopted in the present\n                            appeal ... [emphasis in original] 22     As is clear from the foregoing, the CA inTan Kiam Pengdeclined to rule definitively on\n                    the interpretation of s 18(2) of the Act because counsel had not made\n                    detailed submissions on that issue. The CA proceeded on the basis that the\n                    second interpretation (iethat knowledge that the\n                    drug was the specific drug the subject matter of the charge) was the correct one\n                    and dismissed the appeal on the ground that the appellant had actual knowledge\n                    of the nature of the drug he was in possession of. 23     I observe that the CA inTan Kiam Penghad held at [84], and reiterated at [90], that the\n                    ordinary meaning of the words in s 18(2) of the Act pointed to the second\n                    interpretation. In my opinion, this alone ought to have determined the issue.\n                    However the CA felt constrained by earlier decisions and by the view that the\n                    first interpretation is consistent with the general policy of the Act whereas\n                    the second would undermine it (see [85], [88] and [90] ofTan\n                        Kiam Peng). Unfortunately the CA did not proceed to consider what\n                    the underlying policy of the Act is in order to test this proposition. I will\n                    attempt to do so now. 24     The long title to the Act states that it is\n                    “for the control of dangerous or otherwise harmful drugs and substances\n                    and for purposes connected therewith”. Part II of the Act establishes\n                    offences of trafficking, manufacture, import and export, possession and\n                    consumption of controlled drugs specified in the First Schedule. Part III\n                    contains rules of evidence pertaining to prosecutions under the Act, provisions\n                    pertaining to enforcement and forfeiture and sets out the punishments for\n                    various offences. There are several sections setting up presumptions, including\n                    s 18. Part IV deals with treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts. Part\n                    V contains provisions empowering the taking of photographs of and body samples\n                    from persons under supervision. Part VI deals with the establishment of\n                    committees of inquiry for matters connected with discipline and other functions\n                    of any approved institution for rehabilitation of drug addicts. Considering the\n                    Act as a whole, and the parliamentary debates dealing with its enactment in\n                    1973, it is clear that the Act was enacted to deal with the problem of narcotic\n                    drug abuse and addiction. It punishes persons not only for trafficking, but also\n                    for consumption of controlled drugs. It provides for incarceration for the\n                    purposes of rehabilitation of drug addicts. It would not be inaccurate to state\n                    that the general policy underlying the Act is that of reducing and even\n                    eradicating narcotic drug abuse in Singapore. The next question is whether\n                    taking the first interpretation or the second would further the policy or\n                    undermine it. There is no doubt that adopting the first interpretation would\n                    make it much easier for the prosecution to secure a conviction in cases where\n                    the presumption in s 18(2) of the Act is required to be invoked. But it is\n                    quite a different thing to say that making it easier for the prosecution to\n                    secure a conviction would promote the general policy of the Act whereas making\n                    it more difficult to do so would undermine it. Our system of criminal justice\n                    requires the prosecution to prove an accused person’s guilt beyond\n                    reasonable doubt in order to secure a conviction. The presumption in\n                    s 18(2) of the Act shifts the burden of proof of knowledge to the accused\n                    person once the conditions therein are met. The legislature had decided where\n                    the line should be drawn in relation to that burden. If, as the CA inTan Kiam Pengheld, the ordinary meaning of the words in\n                    s 18(2) point to the second interpretation, then it is my respectful\n                    opinion that there cannot be room for any consideration as to whether this\n                    meaning “undermines the general policy” of the Act as Parliament\n                    had decided on this line as the appropriate balance between burden on the\n                    prosecution and on the accused. 25     Even if there is an ambiguity in s 18(2)\n                    of the Act, it should be noted that this is a criminal provision. The CA inTan Kiam Pengstated at [91] that, as the\n                    punishments for offences under the Act are harsh and even encompass the death\n                    penalty, any ambiguity in the statutory language ought to be resolved in favour\n                    of the accused. I would point out that this is a principle of statutory\n                    interpretation of great antiquity in the common law. In Francis Bennion,Bennion on Statutory Interpretation(LexisNexis, 5thEdition, 2008), the writer put it in\n                    the following manner at s 271, p 825: It is a principle of legal policy that a person should not be penalised\n                        except under clear law ... The court, when considering, in relation to the\n                        facts of the instant case, which of the opposing constructions of the\n                        enactment would give effect to the legislative intention, should presume\n                        that the legislator intended to observe this principle. It should therefore\n                        strive to avoid adopting a construction which penalises a person where the\n                        legislator’s intention to do so is doubtful, or penalises him or her\n                        in a way which was not made clear … 26     InTuck & Sons v\n                        Priester(1887) 19 QBD 629, the plaintiffs entered into a\n                    contract with the defendant to make copies of a drawing which belonged to the\n                    plaintiffs. The plaintiffs subsequently registered their copyright. Without the\n                    consent of the plaintiffs, the defendant made additional copies in a foreign\n                    country with the intention of selling them for his own profit. An issue before\n                    the court was whether under the Fine Arts Copyright Act 1862 (25 & 26 Vict.\n                    c. 68) (“the Victorian Act”) the defendant made copies of the work\n                    unlawfully and was therefore subjected to additional penalties pursuant to\n                    s 6 of the Victorian Act. Lord Esher MR held that (at 638): … We must be very careful in construing that section, because it\n                        imposes a penalty. If there is a reasonable interpretation which will avoid\n                        the penalty in any particular case we must adopt that construction. If there\n                        are two reasonable constructions we must give the more lenient one. That is\n                        the settled rule for the construction of penal sections … 27     This decision was followed inTeng Lang Khin v Public Prosecutor[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1040, an appeal to the High Court from the\n                    Magistrate’s Court. The appellant there was convicted under s 101(2)\n                    of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1985 Rev Ed) (“RTA”) for causing\n                    a vehicle registered for private use to be used as a public service vehicle\n                    without there being in force a public service licence in respect of the vehicle.\n                    She had rented to customers cars registered for private use. At issue was what\n                    constituted a “public service vehicle” under the RTA.\n                    Section 2 of the RTA stated: ‘public service vehicle’ means a vehicle used or kept for use\n                        for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward, other than a vehicle\n                        constructed for use on fixed rails or specially prepared ways ... Yong Pung How CJ (“Yong CJ”) held, albeit\n                    “not without some reluctance”, that the literal construction of\n                    s 2 of the RTA was that the cars hired out by the appellant did not\n                    constitute “public service vehicles” since they were hired out as\n                    self-drive cars and there was no evidence that they had been used for carriage\n                    of passengers for hire or reward. Yong CJ cited with approval the passage\n                    fromTuck & Sons v Priesterreproduced above\n                    at[26]and also made the following\n                    statement (at [18]): ... in the present case the definition of \"public service vehicle\" in s 2\n                        of the Road Traffic Act appeared to me to be quite clear. The deputy public\n                        prosecutor did not attempt to suggest that there might be some underlying\n                        ambiguity to s 2; and wisely so, for any suggestion that ambiguity existed\n                        would only have led to the alleged ambiguity being resolved in favour of the\n                        person otherwise liable under s 101(2) - in this case, the appellant.\n                        Indeed, in view of the draconian penalty prescribed in s 101(6) of\n                        forfeiture of an accused's vehicles, I would have had no hesitation in\n                        resolving any obscurity in favour of the appellant, unmeritorious though her\n                        conduct might have been … 28     This rule has been attenuated in recent times\n                    and the courts adopt a more pragmatic purposive approach to statutory\n                    interpretation especially after the enactment of s 9A of the Interpretation\n                    Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed). InPublic Prosecutor v\n                        Low Kok Heng[2007] 4 SLR(R) 183, V K\n                    Rajah JA opined at [38]: 38     The modern local position on\n                        the construction of penal statutes is appositely summarised by Yong Pung\n                        How CJ in [Forward Food Management Pte Ltd and\n                            another v Public Prosecutor[2002] 1 SLR(R) 443]\n                        … at [26] in the following\n                        terms: [T]he strict construction rule is only applied to ambiguous statutory\n                            provisions as a tool of last resort. The proper approach to be taken by\n                            a court construing a penal provision is to first consider if the literal\n                            and purposive interpretations of the provision leave the provision in\n                            ambiguity. It is only after these and other tools of ascertaining\n                            Parliament's intent have been exhausted, that the strict construction\n                            rule kicks in in the accused person's favour. To my mind, this is decidedly the most appropriate approach to adopt,\n                        particularly in the light of the principle of statutory construction of\n                        statutes endorsed by Parliament in the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev\n                        Ed), as discussed below. ... The general position in Singapore with respect to the construction of\n                    written law should be the same whether the provision is a penal or civil one.\n                    Purposive interpretation in accordance with s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act is\n                    the paramount principle of interpretation even with respect to penal statutes;\n                    it is only in cases where penal provisions remain ambiguous notwithstanding all\n                    attempts at purposive interpretation that the strict construction rule\n                    applies. 29     However this rule is nevertheless germane in\n                    capital cases. InForward Food Management Pte Ltd and another\n                        v Public Prosecutor[2002] 1 SLR(R) 443, Yong CJ\n                    said at [21]: To my mind, it was therefore important to consider the theoretical basis\n                        of the rule and its applicability in the modern legal environment, where\n                        courts are more disposed to applying the purposive approach to statutory\n                        interpretation. The origins of the strict construction rule can be found in\n                        capital cases where the courts construed ambiguous statutory provisionsin favorem vitaeas this was regarded as a\n                        form of fairness to the individual. According to Prof Andrew Ashworth,\n                        “Interpreting Criminal Statutes: A Crisis of Legality?” (1991)\n                        LQR 419 at 432, the principle was subsequently carried over into other areas\n                        of criminal law, probably because criminal proceedings were viewed as an\n                        unequal contest between the individual and the State. This seems to be\n                        supported by thedictaof Wilson J inR v Paré(1987) 60 CR (3d) 346\n                        at 368. Furthermore, the editors ofCross on Statutory\n                            Interpretation(3rd Ed) opined, at p 173, that the\n                        application of this rule in earlier cases likeRex v\n                            Harris, Balls, and Moses(1835) 7 Car & P 416\n                        was justified on humanitarian grounds because of the manifest injustice\n                        brought about by other interpretations of a statute. These, however, have\n                        been rendered unnecessary by the mitigation of the rigours of the criminal\n                        law. Moreover, courts have increasingly taken the view that an extreme slant\n                        in favour of the accused is not always desirable because it often defeats\n                        the purposes of the legislation and this in turn leads to some other form of\n                        injustice. 30     Therefore, if there is an ambiguity in\n                    s 18(2) of the Act, as the CA inTan Kiam\n                        Pengput in at [91], “the benefit of the doubt ought to be\n                    given to the accused”. There is a further reason for doing so. Under\n                    s 18(1), an accused is presumed to have possession of the controlled drug\n                    if it is proved that he had possession of the keys to a place or premises or\n                    even a document intended for delivery. Under s 18(2), once this presumption\n                    of possession is operative, the presumption of knowledge is invoked.\n                    Section 18(2) therefore involves a presumption upon a presumption, a\n                    further reversal of the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused. In\n                    my opinion, “the second interpretation” of s 18(2) that the\n                    CA inTan Kiam Penghad considered (at [95] of\n                    their judgment) to be “the more persuasive” one must be the\n                    correct one in law.",
        "My finding in relation to Somchit": "31     From both her demeanour in the witness box and\n                    the consistency of her evidence, I found Somchit to be a witness of truth.\n                    Somchit gave evidence over almost three days. She came across as a person of\n                    average intelligence and displayed a level of street smart savvy that can be\n                    expected from her background. I had noted that throughout her testimony, she\n                    answered questions without hesitation and in a forthright manner. She admitted\n                    to every question put to her save on the issue of her knowledge that the drugs\n                    she was dealing with were heroin. Somchit had maintained this position right\n                    from the time of her arrest in the Bedok Condominium. There, W/ASP Tan had\n                    asked, through an interpreter, what Quek’s customers bought from him. She\n                    said that it was the “white colour”. To the follow-up question,\n                    she had said: “I do not know what is the white colour. ‘Wan’\n                    only engage me to help him pack into smaller packets and he will pay me for the\n                    work.” Somchit was then taken to CNB headquarters and questioned through\n                    the night. In the morning, at around 6.30am on 4 October 2008, Somchit\n                    was charged with trafficking heroin and that was when it was brought to her\n                    attention that she was facing a capital offence in relation to that drug. In her\n                    statement in response to the charge, she said that she knew that it was a\n                    controlled drug, but she did not know its effect nor the severity of the\n                    punishment. She said that Quek told her that if anything happened, she would not\n                    get into serious trouble; and at worst, she would be deported. It can be seen\n                    that her reactions in the hours after the shock of arrest, and when faced with a\n                    capital charge, are consistent with what she maintained in her defence. Over\n                    several months she gave a number of statements to the CNB. There were no\n                    significant inconsistencies there with her defence. Finally, the evidence given\n                    at the trial by Winai and Somchit herself were also consistent with her defence.\n                    I took into consideration Somchit’s background. She had only completed\n                    primary school in Thailand and thereafter had gone to work, first as a masseuse\n                    before resorting to prostitution. Her life had been a constant struggle, and she\n                    stooped to the lowliest occupation a woman could take to support her sons and an\n                    extended family. Therefore when Quek rescued her from this life and not only\n                    placed her in comfortable surroundings, treated her well and provided for her\n                    family, but also professed his love for her and intention to marry her, it is\n                    not surprising that she trusted him and took his words literally. Having had the\n                    opportunity to observe her demeanour in the witness box, I found her evidence to\n                    be truthful. 32     For completeness, I will now deal with what\n                    the prosecution has submitted are the weaknesses in Somchit’s\n                    defence. 33     The first point highlighted by the prosecution\n                    was that the circumstantial evidence,iethe money\n                    she received, the packing, Quek’s method for consuming the drugetcpoints to the conclusion that Somchit knew that the\n                    seized drugs were diamorphine. However, given the nature of their relationship,\n                    I accepted Somchit’s evidence that Quek would have given her money whether\n                    or not she helped him in his drug dealings. More importantly, Somchit had\n                    admitted that she knew that the substance was some kind of illegal drugs, and\n                    therefore it would not be surprising to her that there would be money in the\n                    operation. 34     The second point was that Somchit did not\n                    mention in her statements to the CNB that Quek told her the drug he dealt with\n                    was a “not serious drug”; on the contrary, she stated then that\n                    Quek told her she did not need to know what the drug was. When cross-examined on\n                    this apparent omission from her statements to the CNB, Somchit stated\n                        that[note: 12]: My understanding at that time was not serious of my doing and not serious\n                        about the drug that he sell. That is why I thought --- I never think of the\n                        words “serious drug”. In my view, Somchit’s evidence to this court was consistent with\n                    her statements to the CNB. Firstly it must be emphasised that s 122(6) of\n                    the CPC does not require the accused person to minutely detail the defence he\n                    will be relying on at the trial: seeRoshdi v Public\n                        Prosecutor[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1 at [21]. More importantly, I found that although\n                    Somchit did not state specifically that Quek told her the drugs were “not\n                    serious”, her statements had in fact alluded to it. As noted above, from\n                    the moment she was arrested, Somchit had denied knowledge of the nature of the\n                    seized drugs. In her cautioned statement, she stated that she did not know the\n                    effect of the drug or the severity of the penalty. I noted that Somchit’s\n                    statement to the CNB was slightly different from her evidence in trial,iein her cautioned statement, she denied\n                    knowledge of the severity ofthe penalty, and notthe drugitself. However in the context, I was\n                    of the view that the two are connected. Taking into account Somchit’s\n                    background, I found that it was reasonable that when laying out the material\n                    aspect of her defences in her statement, she did not appreciate the difference.\n                    I therefore found her cautioned statement to be consistent with her evidence at\n                    trial, and that by stating that Quek told her that the worst that would happen\n                    would be for her to be sent back to Thailand, Somchit alluded to the fact that\n                    Quek told her that the drugs he dealt with were “not serious”. The\n                    prosecution submitted that the reason why Somchit thought that the worst that\n                    would happen to her was being sent back to Thailand was because Quek told her\n                    that he would admit that all the drugs belonged to him. While that is a\n                    plausible interpretation, in my view, it was necessary to consider her evidence\n                    in its totality. Again, here I noted the consistency of her statements and her\n                    defence at trial. 35     The third point raised was that when Somchit\n                    learnt that Quek was dealing with drugs, and Winai asked her if she was scared,\n                    she said she was[note: 13]. In Somchit’s statements to the CNB,\n                    she stated the following: 23    ... When I came to know that the white substance is\n                            drugs, I did inform [Winai] that what he is carrying is drugs. I told\n                            him to finish up his visa make some money for the time being and go back\n                            to Thailand when his visa expired.[note: 14] ... 44    With regards to paragraph 23 of my statement, I\n                            said that I had told [Winai] that he was carrying drugs. I decided to\n                            tell him as I wanted to let him make his own decision as to whether to\n                            continue working or to stop, and I will respect his decision. He was\n                            surprised when I told him that he was carrying drugs, but he was not\n                            angry. [Winai] did ask me if they are really drugs, and I replied that I\n                            think so. He then told me to let him continue working till his visa\n                            expired and he will go back. He told [me] that at least he can have some\n                            money to return home. He also told me to go back together with him as he\n                            was worried about me. I had intended to go back with him and not return\n                            to Singapore anymore. He also asked me if I was scared and I said I was.\n                            When he said scared, he meant how are our families to survive if\n                            something happened to us.[note: 15] As for what would happen to her, Somchit agreed with the\n                    prosecution that she thought she may be imprisoned[note: 16]. Thus, she wanted to go back to Thailand\n                    when her visa expired. The prosecution submitted that these suggested that she\n                    knew the seriousness of the drugs Quek dealt with. Somchit testified that she\n                    had two conversations with Winai. The first conversation took place after she\n                    first found out that Quek dealt with drugs when he brought the drugs to the\n                    Bedok Condominium. Somchit called Winai to inform him that Quek dealt with drugs\n                    and that Winai and her should return to Thailand after their visa\n                        ended[note: 17]. It was\n                    during this conversation with Winai where Somchit expressed that she was\n                        “scared”[note: 18]. The second conversation with Winai,\n                    where Somchit told Winai that at the very most, they would be sent back to\n                    Thailand, took place subsequently after she began to help Quek with the packingieafter Quek had told her that the drugs were\n                    not serious.[note: 19]Thus, the defence submitted that although\n                    Somchit was initially “scared”, her fears were removed when Quek\n                    represented to her that the drugs were “not serious”, and she\n                    therefore decided to help him as well as extend her visa. I accepted\n                    Somchit’s explanation as to the apparent inconsistency in her evidence. In\n                    my view, it was consistent with her explanation as to why she chose to extend\n                    her visa although she initially stated that she wanted to return to Thailand\n                    with Winai after their visas were expired. I also noted that para 44 of\n                    Somchit’s statement (see above at[35]) related to the events which took place after the first time\n                    she saw Quek bringing the drugs back to the Bedok Condominium. 36     The fourth point was that even if Somchit did\n                    not haveactual knowledgeas to the nature of the\n                    drugs, she was at least wilfully blind as to its nature. As for what amounted to\n                    “wilful blindness”, the prosecution relied on the CA’s\n                    decision inTan Kiam Peng, which states the\n                    following: 104    ... The proof of an\n                            actual situation of actual knowledge is, in the circumstances, going to\n                            be equally rare. This is afortiorithe\n                            case in so far as offences under the Act are concerned. Accused persons\n                            are hardly likely to admit to possessing actual knowledge and can\n                            (indeed, will) easily disavow such knowledge even if it existed, given\n                            the surreptitious nature inherent in drug offences as well as the\n                            draconian penalties that are imposed on conviction. In any event, as we\n                            have already noted, wilful blindness has, in any event, always been\n                            treated, in law, asactualknowledge. In\n                            this regard, Yong CJ, inKoo Pui Fong,\n                            observed that the “concept of wilful blindness does not introduce\n                            a new state of mind to that of knowing” and that “[i]t is\n                            simply a reformulation of actual knowledge” … the learned\n                            Chief Justice then proceeded to observe as follows\n                        …: It seems to me that it is wholly in keeping with common\n                            sense and the law to say that an accused knew of certain facts if he\n                            deliberately closed his eyes to the circumstances, his wilful blindness\n                            being evidence from which knowledge may be inferred. Thus I fully agree\n                            with the following passage of Lord Bridge inWestminster City Council v Croyalgrange Ltd(1986) 83 Cr\n                            App R 155 at 164: ... it is always open to the tribunal of fact, when knowledge on\n                                the part of a defendant is required to be proved, to base a finding\n                                of knowledge on evidence that the defendant had deliberately shut\n                                his eyes to the obvious or refrained from inquiry because he\n                                suspected the truth but did not want to have his suspicion\n                                confirmed. [emphasis in original] 37     It should also be observed that the CA\n                    distinguished betweenwilful blindnessandconstructive knowledgein the following\n                    manner: 116    InRoper… although the court arrived at its decision on\n                        a comparatively narrow ground to the effect that the court below had taken\n                        into account inadmissible evidence and that the defendants’ appeal had\n                        therefore to be allowed, Devlin J (as he then was) nevertheless proceeded to\n                        make the very pertinent observations, which merit quotation in full, as\n                        follows (at 288-289): There are, I think, three degrees of knowledge which it may be\n                            relevant to consider in case[es] of this kind. Thefirstisactualknowledge,\n                            which the justices may find because they infer it from the nature of the\n                            act done, for no man can prove the state of another man’[s] mind;\n                            and they may find it even if the defendant gives evidence to the\n                            contrary. They may say, “We do not believe him; we think that\n                            that was his state of mind.” They may feel that the evidence\n                            falls short of that, and if they do they have then to consider what\n                            might be described as knowledge of theseconddegree;whether the defendant\n                                was, as it has been called, shutting his eyes to an obvious means of\n                                knowledge. Various expressions have been used to describe\n                            that state of mind. I do not think it necessary to look further,\n                            certainly not in cases of this type, than the phrase which Lord Hewart,\n                            C.J., used in a case under this section,Evans v.\n                                Dell((1937) 53The TimesL.R. 310), where he said (at p. 313): “... the respondent\n                            deliberately refrained from making inquiries the results of which he\n                            might not care to have.” Thethirdkind of knowledge is what is\n                            generally known in the law asconstructiveknowledge:it is what is encompassed by the words\n                                “ought to have known” in the phrase “knew or\n                                ought to have known”. It does not mean actual knowledge at\n                                all; it means that the defendant had in effect the means\n                            of knowledge. When, therefore, the case of the prosecution is that the\n                            defendant fails to make what they think were reasonable inquiries it is,\n                            I think, incumbent on them to make it plain which of the two things they\n                            are saying.There is a vast distinction between a\n                                state of mind which consists of deliberately refraining from making\n                                inquiries, the result of which the person does not care to have, and\n                                a state of mind which is merely neglecting to make such inquiries as\n                                a reasonable and prudent person would make. If that\n                            distinction is kept well in mind I think that justices will have less\n                            difficulty than this case appears to show they have had in determining\n                            what is the true position.The case of shutting [the]\n                                eyes is actual knowledge in the eyes of the law; the case of merely\n                                neglecting to make inquiries is not knowledge at all - it comes\n                                within the legal conception of constructive knowledge, a conception\n                                which, generally speaking, has no place in the criminal\n                                law. [emphasis in original] The above observations - quoted at length because, as we shall see\n                    below, of their signal importance - are instructive. Although the learned judge\n                    spoke of “three degrees of knowledge”, there are, in point of\n                    fact, onlytwo distinct categories,viz, actual knowledge and constructive knowledge,\n                    respectively. The former, however, comprises two sub-categories - first, actual\n                    knowledge in (for want of a better way of putting it) an actual sense and,\n                    secondly, actual knowledge in the form ofwilful\n                        blindness. And, as Devlin J aptly put it, the other main category\n                    of knowledge,viz, constructive knowledge\n                    “has no place in the criminal law”. However, as we shall see below\n                    at[38](especially at [133] ofTan Kiam Peng), the line between actual and constructive\n                    knowledge is not always that clear, owing to the very factual nature of the\n                    inquiry. 38     The CA went on to state the general principles\n                    relating to the concept of wilful blindness: 123    The first is that wilful blindness is treated,\n                        in law, as being theequivalentofactualknowledge ... 124    What is clear from the above observations is\n                        that the accused is under no legal obligation not to turn a blind eye.\n                        However, if he does in fact turn a blind eye, that could, on the facts, be\n                        taken to be wilful blindness on his part. If so, this would be tantamount to\n                        actual knowledge in law, and the accused would have failed to have rebutted\n                        the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the Act ... 125    The second central principle is thatsuspicion islegally sufficient to ground a finding\n                        of wilful blindness provided the relevant factual matrix warrants such a\n                        findingandthe accused deliberately decides\n                        to turn a blind eye ... What is of vital significance, in our view, is the\n                        substance of the matter which (in turn) depends heavily upon theprecise factsbefore the court. It is equally\n                        important to note that in order for wilful blindness to be established, the\n                        appropriate level of suspicion (as just discussed) is a necessary, but not\n                        sufficient, condition, inasmuch as that level of suspicionmust then lead to a refusal to investigate further,\n                        thus resulting in \"blind eye knowledge\" (see also the second quotation from\n                        the article by Wasik & Thompson at [127] below). 126    That having been said, the requirement ofsuspicionis nevertheless a vital (and,\n                        indeed, threshold) one. So, for example, if the accused makes merely token\n                        inquiries because he suspects that making more substantive inquiries might\n                        lead him to the truth which he does not want to know, that is wilful\n                        blindness. If the factual matrix was such that the accused ought to have\n                        been suspicious, the court must then consider the accused's reasons for not\n                        making further inquiries. We will come to this point below but it suffices\n                        to state at this juncture that a court would be well justified in thinking\n                        that the reason why an accused refused to make further inquiries may be\n                        because he or she was virtually certain that if further inquiries were made,\n                        his or her suspicions would be confirmed ... 127    We would venture to state a third central\n                        principle... is imperative, in order to avoid any unnecessary confusion,\n                        that we emphasise, once again, that wilful blindness is a combination of\n                        suspicioncoupled withadeliberatedecision not to make further inquiries, whereas\n                        the recklessness that has been referred to by Prof Williams refers to\n                        recklessness in terms of the accused’s conduct in the context of\n                        circumstanceswhich would not otherwise have aroused\n                            suspicionon the part of the accused … 128    Finally, a fourth central principle is that\n                        whether or not a presumption (here, of knowledge) under the Act isrebutted(on a balance of probabilities …\n                        depends, in the final analysis, onthe precise factual\n                            matrixconcerned ... 129 Indeed, in the context of the doctrine of wilful blindness, while some\n                        illustrations may be helpful, it is nevertheless imperative to note that,\n                        owing to the intensely factual nature of the inquiry, they cannot be\n                        representative, let alone comprehensive. Generally speaking, if an accused\n                        has had his or her suspicions aroused in the manner set out at [125] above,\n                        the accused can still rebut the relevant presumption under s 18 of the Act\n                        by demonstrating that he or she took reasonable steps to investigate by\n                        making further inquiries that were appropriate to the circumstances ...\n                        However, to the extent that the Judge later suggests that it would be wrong\n                        to convict accused personssolelyon the basis\n                        that they had failed to make proper inquiries … we would respectfully\n                        disagree with such a suggestion ... Wilful blindnesscannotbe equated with virtual certainty for, as already\n                        explained above, this would be to equate wilful blindness with actual\n                        knowledge in its purest form. The result would be to erase the doctrine of\n                        wilful blindness from the legal landscape altogether ... 130    Situations such as that which exists on the\n                        facts of the present appeal underscore this point since the accused already\n                        knows that he or she is carrying controlled drugs and surely cannot relymerelyon the fact that he or she had\n                        asked for assurances that the controlled drugs concerned were not of a\n                        nature which carried the death penalty. If the accused chooses to take an\n                        enormous (indeed, deadly) risk and proceed without establishing the true\n                        nature of the drugs he or she is carrying, that constitutes, in our view,\n                        wilful blindness ... … 132    However, as we have\n                            emphasised, the possible factual scenarios are far too many to admit of\n                            blanket propositions and, hence, the decision of the court in a given\n                            case will have to depend on the precise facts, the evidence adduced as\n                            well as the credibility of the witnesses themselves (not least the\n                            accused) (this was also, as we have seen in the preceding paragraph, the\n                            apparent position ultimately adopted by the Judge in the court below).\n                            To reiterate an obvious (but important) example, where the accused has\n                            had the controlled drugs slipped into a bag without his or her\n                            knowledge, it is clear that no offence under the Act would have been\n                            committed (see, once again, the passage by Lord Parker CJ inLockyer v Gibb… ). Where, to\n                            take another example, the accused is asked by a close family member to\n                            carry a box containing controlled drugs on the understanding that the\n                            box (wrapped up, say, in ribbons) contains a cake which is to be\n                            delivered to another close relative, there might be a strong case for\n                            arguing that the accused could not be said to be wilfully blind because\n                            the circumstances ought not to have aroused his or her suspicions, let\n                            alone entailed further investigation. Again, however, much would (to\n                            reiterate an extremely important point) depend on the precise facts,\n                            evidence as well as credibility of the witnesses (especially the\n                            accused). 133    Given our views on\n                            actual knowledge as well as wilful blindness (which is, in law, a form\n                            of actual knowledge), it is unnecessary, in our view, to consider other\n                            forms of knowledge. In particular, and here we agree with the Judge, it\n                            isinappropriateto includeconstructiveknowledge as falling within the\n                            ambit of s 18(2) of the Act. However, given the objective approach\n                            that this (indeed, any) court must adoptas well\n                                asthe very factual nature of the inquiry itself, we\n                            should emphasise thatthere might be occasions when\n                                the line between actual and constructive knowledge might be\n                                blurred(this may particularly be the case in so far as\n                            (in the nature of things) the application of the doctrine of wilful\n                            blindness is concerned). Indeed, as Scott LJ (as he then was)\n                            perceptively observed in the English Court of Appeal decision ofPolly Peck International plc v Nadir (No\n                                2)[1992] 4 All ER 769 (at 777): The various categories of mental state identified inBaden’scase are not rigid categories with\n                            clear and precise boundaries.One category may merge\n                                imperceptibly into another. [emphasis in original] 39     It is clear that the CA considered wilful\n                    blindness to be thelegalbut notactualequivalent to actual knowledge. In any case, I\n                    was of the view that Somchit was not wilfully blind as to the nature of the\n                    drug. I noted that Somchit had asked Quek what the drug was, to which he replied\n                    that it was a “not serious” drug. I further noted that Somchit had\n                    testified that, had Quek told her that the drugs were medicinal, or not illegal,\n                    she would not have believed him. This showed that Somchit was not blindly\n                    willing to accept anything Quek said – she had considered his\n                    representations, and given the nature of their relationship, I found that\n                    Somchit had agenuine beliefthat the drugs she\n                    dealt with were “not serious”. This was therefore different from a\n                    situation where there was “suspicioncoupled\n                        withadeliberatedecision not to\n                    make further inquiries” (see [127] ofTan Kiam\n                        Peng). I found that although Somchit was initially suspicious of\n                    the nature of the drugs Quek dealt with, her suspicions were allayed when Quek\n                    told her that the drugs were “not serious”. The decision not to\n                    make further inquiries was therefore a result of her trust in Quek (along with\n                    her reasonable belief that Quek had no reason to lie to her since he had already\n                    readily admitted to her that the white substance was an illegal drug), and not a\n                    refusal to investigate further to avoid her suspicions being\n                confirmed. 40     In view of the foregoing, I believed\n                    Somchit’s defence that she believed that the drug was a “not\n                    serious drug” and therefore found that Somchit had succeeded in proving,\n                    on a balance of probability, that she did not know the nature of the drug the\n                    subject of the charge against her. I therefore acquitted her of the\n                    charge. 41     However, as Somchit had intended to traffic in\n                    a “not serious drug”, and the evidence supported it, I exercised\n                    my power under s 175(2) of the CPC and convicted Somchit of the following\n                    charge: That you, Phuthita Somchit, on or about the 3rdday of October 2008 in Singapore, did attempt to traffic in a controlled\n                        drug under Class C of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap\n                        185) (“the Act”), without any authorisation under the Act or\n                        the Regulations made thereunder, to wit, by having in your possession of not\n                        less than 62.14 grams of diamorphine at Block 21 Bedok Reservoir View\n                        #01-02, Aquarius by the Park, Singapore, which you believed was a controlled\n                        drug as defined in section 2 of the Act, for the purpose of trafficking, an\n                        offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) and section 12 of the\n                        Act, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 33\n                        of the Act. 42     In my view, although Somchit admitted to an\n                    intention to traffic a “not serious drug”, it could not be proven\n                    beyond a reasonable doubt that the “not serious drug” she intended\n                    to traffic was a Class A or Class B drug. However, since Somchit admitted to her\n                    intentions and her knowledge that the white substance was an illegal drug, I\n                    found that she must have intended, at the very least, to traffic a Class C\n                    drug. 43     After hearing counsel’s submissions on\n                    sentencing, I sentenced Somchit to 9 years’ imprisonment, for the reason\n                    that Somchit had participated in the offence over a period of a month and was\n                    actively involved in packing the drugs, taking orders and had not only recruited\n                    Winai for the operation but had also directed him in conducting\n                it.",
        "The case for and against Quek": "",
        "Evidence against Quek": "44     I now turn to the evidence against Quek. Quek\n                    was arrested on 3 October 2008 at about 7.45pm. At about 8.45pm, CNB\n                    officers raided the Bedok Condominium using keys that had been found on\n                    Quek’s person. As noted above, the seized drugs were found in the Bedok\n                    Condominium (also see SAF above at[2]). 45     Quek made the following statements to the CNB,\n                    which were admitted into evidence: (a)     Contemporaneous statement taken on\n                        the 3 October 2008 at 2140h: Q:Whose heroin are those in the cupboard belonged\n                            to? A:Mine ... Q:There is any box containing heroin in the hall next\n                            to the television. Whose heroin are those belonged to? A:Mine (b)     Cautioned statement taken on 4\n                        October 2008 at 0646h: All these things belong to me. It has nothing to do with the rest. They\n                        are only staying at my place. The things are referring to drugs. (c)     Statement recorded on 8 October 2008\n                        at 1450h: 30    ... I am now shown another photo of [a\n                            “Nokia” box] and 3 plastic packets containing smaller\n                            packets of white granular substance ... I recognize that the white\n                            substance is heroin and I think they belong to me ... 31    I am now shown a photo of a white bag and the\n                            contents inside and told that the bag was found inside the cupboard in\n                            the store ... I recognize the bag and I wish to say that it belongs to\n                            me ... 32    There is a yellow plastic bag in the white bag. In\n                            the yellow plastic bag, I am told that there is a plastic box containing\n                            11 packets, 1 big packet and 1 packet containing 5 packets of granular\n                            substance. I wish to say they are heroin. I wish to say that out of the\n                            11 packets of heroin, some are meant for selling while some are meant\n                            for own consumption ... 33    ... In the white bag, there is a paper carton box.\n                            Inside the paper box, I am told there are 2 packets of granular\n                            substance and 17 plastic packets each containing 5 packets of granular\n                            substance. These are all heroin and I wish to say that these heroin are\n                            meant for sale ... 46     The Bedok Condominium was tenanted to one\n                    “Lim Chay Yong”, who was in fact Quek (Quek also stated in his\n                    statement recorded on 7 October 2008 that at the time of his arrest,\n                    he was staying at a Bedok Condominium which he rented). By virtue of\n                    s 18(1)(c) of the Act, Quek was presumed to have the seized drugs in\n                    possession. In any case, it was not necessary to rely on the presumption under\n                    s 18(1)(c). Quek admitted in his statements that the drugs belonged to him.\n                    By virtue of s 18(2), Quek would be presumed to have known the nature of\n                    the drugs. However, again it was unnecessary to rely on this presumption. It was\n                    clear from his statements that Quek knew that the drugs were heroin. Likewise,\n                    from his statements, Quek’s intention to traffic the drugs was\n                    apparent. 47     The evidence against Quek was corroborated by\n                    both Somchit and Winai. Somchit testified that she resided in the Bedok\n                    Condominium with Quek[note: 20]. Somchit also testified that it was Quek who\n                    procured the seized drugs[note: 21]and that she had packed the drugs found\n                    in the Nokia Box for Quek’s customers[note: 22]. Likewise, Winai testified that Quek had\n                    instructed him to deliver white substances to customers.[note: 23]",
        "My finding in relation to Quek": "48     Quek elected to remain silent upon his defence\n                    being called and did not call any witness to give evidence on his behalf.\n                    Evidence of possession and knowledge by prosecution witnesses and Somchit were\n                    not disputed by Quek’s counsel in cross-examination. From the evidence of\n                    the events from the time of Quek’s arrest to the search in the Bedok\n                    Condominium, I found that there was sufficient evidence to prove beyond\n                    reasonable doubt that Quek had possession and knowledge. Counsel for Quek\n                    submitted that there was no evidence before the court that showed that Quek had\n                    possession of the drugs the subject of the charge for the purpose of\n                    trafficking. Counsel argued that while there was evidence that Quek had sold\n                    drugs in earlier transactions, those drugs were not the subject of the charge. I\n                    did not agree with this submission for two reasons. Firstly, the presumption of\n                    trafficking in s 17 of the Act was available to the prosecution as the\n                    amount in question, 62.14 grams of diamorphine, was more than the threshold of 2\n                    grams under that provision. Secondly and more importantly, Quek had packed the\n                    drugs in question for the purpose of selling them. The drugs in question were\n                    his stocks in his continuing narcotic drug retailing operation. There was\n                    therefore ample basis for finding that Quek had intended to traffic the drugs\n                    the subject of the charge. 49     However, in view of my finding that Somchit\n                    did not have knowledge, I exercised my power under s 163(1) of the CPC to\n                    amend the charge against Quek to the following: That you, Quek Hock Lye, on or about the 3rdday of October 2008 in Singapore, together with one Winai Phutthaphan, were\n                        parties to a criminal conspiracy, and in such capacity, agreed and engaged\n                        with one another to do an illegal act, namely, to traffic in diamorphine, a\n                        controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of\n                        Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“the Act”), without any authorisation\n                        under the Act or the Regulations made thereunder, whereby you were in\n                        possession of not less than 62.14 grams of diamorphine at Block 21 Bedok\n                        Reservoir View #01-02, Aquarius by the Park, Singapore, for the purpose of\n                        trafficking in pursuance of the said conspiracy, an offence under section\n                        5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Act, and you have thereby committed an\n                        offence punishable under section 120B of the Penal Code (Cap 224) read with\n                        sections 12 and 33 of the Act. 50     Pursuant to s 163(2) of the CPC, this\n                    altered charge was read and explained to Quek. Pursuant to s 164(1), Quek\n                    was called upon to plead thereto and to state whether he was ready to be tried\n                    on the altered charge. He claimed trial and stated that he was ready to be tried\n                    on the altered charge. Pursuant to s 167 of the CPC, I invited Quek and the\n                    prosecution to state whether they wished to recall or re-summon and examine with\n                    reference to the altered charge any witness who may have been examined. Both\n                    responded that they did not require to recall any witness. I asked Quek if he\n                    wished to call any new witnesses and whether he wished to give evidence in\n                    relation to the altered charge and he replied to both in the negative. I was of\n                    the view that, as there was no material difference between the altered charge\n                    and the original charge that would require recalling any witness or calling any\n                    new witness, the trial on the altered charge could proceed without any prejudice\n                    to Quek. 51     I proceeded to examine the evidence against\n                    Quek on the altered charge and upon evaluating all the evidence in the trial and\n                    submissions of counsel, I found that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond\n                    reasonable doubt his guilt in relation to the altered charge, convicted him and\n                    sentenced him to death, which is the mandatory punishment under the\n                    charge.
