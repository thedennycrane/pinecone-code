        "i.   Loss of security": "The plaintiffs’ original (and pleaded) case was that Silverlink failed\n                    to take steps to ensure that the SAP Notes would be secured by the Security\n                    Documents (see para 49(c)). They now contend that Silverlink had breached\n                    condition 10(A) of the SAP Notes by agreeing to the novation of the Security\n                    from AVL to OHL, causing them to lose the security. The plaintiffs claimed for\n                    costs of enforcement which they would now have to incur for having lost the\n                    Debenture and Share Pledge Agreement as security[note: 4]. The said condition 10(A) provided as\n                    follows: The Company may not assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any\n                        part of its rights or obligations under the Note without the prior written\n                        consent of the Noteholder. In my view, the submission advanced by the plaintiffs was predicated\n                    on the assumption that AVL held the Security Documents for the benefit of the\n                    SVAPF Note as well as the SAP Notes. As I have indicated earlier, this issue was\n                    beyond the court’s jurisdiction because AVL had not been subject to any\n                    claim from the plaintiffs. While it appeared that the Security Documents were\n                    intended to cover both the SVAPF Note and the SAP Notes, the questions of\n                    whether the documentation in fact provided for them (which AVL disputes) and\n                    whether AVL had agreed to hold the Security as trustee for the plaintiffs were\n                    not issues in this action. In view of the aforesaid, I make no finding as to\n                    whether the defendants are liable for wrongful novation.",
        "ii.   Loss of chance to exit the investment": "The plaintiffs sought damages arising from their loss of chance to exit\n                    their investment in Silverlink together with SVAPF and Lee Hing in November\n                    2007. They averred that SVAPF would not have been able to sell the SVAPF Note to\n                    OHL without SAP’s consent to the novation, and SAP could have made it a\n                    condition of their consent that OHL purchase the SAP Notes at face value and\n                    buy-out Asia Atlas’ and Rockline’s shares in Silverlink. The\n                    plaintiffs claim herein was essentially one for the loss of chance to sell their\n                    shares (or those of entities related to them) in Silverlink. InAuston International Group Ltd and another v Ng Swee Hua[2009] 4 SLR(R) 628, the Court of Appeal reaffirmedAllied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons & Simmons[1995]\n                    1 WLR 1602 in relation to loss of chance. In my opinion, the\n                    plaintiffs’ claim for loss of chance failed as no evidence was led on the\n                    issue, notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiffs already had the benefit of\n                    counsel at the point OHL appeared. This strongly suggested that the\n                    “chance” was a speculative one (as opposed to a substantial\n                    one).",
        "iii.   Loss of rights under the SAP Notes": "There was no doubt that the SAP Notes conferred a range of rights to their\n                    holder. The plaintiffs averred that the loss of the general undertakings had\n                    rendered them “financially blind”, while the loss of the veto\n                    rights denied them the opportunity to influence Silverlink’s business\n                    decisions and to protect their investment in Silverlink. Damages were also\n                    sought for the loss of conversion rights. The loss of a right or undertaking\n                    does not in itself entitle a party to substantial damages. One must prove, on a\n                    balance of probabilities, that he or she had suffered damage as a result of the\n                    breach. For instance, the loss of conversion rights must be attended by proof\n                    that the plaintiffs would have exercised those rights if not for the breach, and\n                    have incurred a loss for not being able to do so. Likewise, the loss of\n                    “veto rights” resulting in an inability to influence business\n                    decisions must also be matched with evidence of actual damage. As in the claim\n                    for loss of chance, the plaintiffs did not lead any evidence to prove that they\n                    had incurred any damage. 10     There was, however, an instance of loss of an\n                    undertaking which entails greater attention. This relates to the US$40m pro-rata\n                    rights issue at US$1 per share. It is the plaintiffs’ case that they have\n                    the right to veto any Silverlink rights issue by virtue of Condition\n                    9(B)(ii)(dd) of the SAP Notes, which essentially required the plaintiffs’\n                    prior written consent. The plaintiffs submitted that they had been massively\n                    diluted and that the defendants ought to pay damages on the basis that their\n                    Silverlink shares were worth US$10 apiece (which was the price OHL paid earlier)\n                    if not for the rights issue. The plaintiffs’ claim in this respect was\n                    essentially one for minority oppression masquerading as a claim for loss of veto\n                    right. It is clear that a separate claim ought to have been filed in which the\n                    plaintiffs ought to have explained,inter alia,\n                    why they did not take up their entitlement of the pro-rata rights. As far as the\n                    SAP entitiesquacreditors (vizthe SAP Notes) were concerned, the rights issue was no doubt\n                    a positive development as US$40m had been injected into Silverlink by way of\n                    additional share capital, thereby improving the prospects of recovery for all\n                    creditors. No loss could possibly have flown from the rights issue to SAP in its\n                    capacity as creditor. 11     For the above reasons, I find that that the\n                    plaintiffs’ losses have not been proved, and they did not suffer any\n                    damages beyond the value of the principal, interest and redemption premium. They\n                    are each therefore entitled to only nominal damages of $100. 12     The last substantive issue pertains to whether\n                    the defendants should be ordered to issue the SAP Notes. Specific performance is\n                    an equitable remedy that is usually granted only when damages would not be\n                    adequate. In the present instance, the plaintiffs contended that without the SAP\n                    Notes, it would,inter alia, be difficult for them\n                    to enforce the Security as a court is “not likely to be able to interpret\n                    the provisions of the Debenture and Share Pledge Agreement”.[note: 5]The plaintiffs also claimed that\n                    without the SAP Notes, they remained unsecured creditors of\n                Silverlink. 13     First there was no reason to suggest that the\n                    Security Documents could not be understood without the SAP Notes. Secondly, the\n                    plaintiffs’ assertion that they would be rendered unsecured without the\n                    SAP Notes was not consistent with the position they had taken against the third\n                    parties. Their position against AVL was that the latter held the Security\n                    Documents as trustee for the plaintiffs, notwithstanding that it was common\n                    ground among all parties that the SAP Notes had never been issued. As such,\n                    based on the plaintiffs’ own case, I saw no necessity in making any orders\n                    in relation to the SAP Notes. Lastly, it had emerged that the defendants had\n                    made an offer to pay the plaintiffs the principal sums on the SAP Notes as well\n                    as furnish a bank guarantee for the contractual interest and redemption premium.\n                    If the plaintiffs had accepted the defendants’ offer of security and\n                    part-payment, which appeared wholly reasonable, the issue of security today\n                    would largely be moot. 14     Pre-judgment interest (see s 12 of the\n                    Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)) and post-judgment interest (see\n                    O 42 r 12 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev\n                    Ed)) are at the discretion of the court. The defendants submitted that\n                    pre-judgment interest (from 30 June 2008 onwards) should not be awarded as\n                    they had earlier offered to pay the plaintiffs the outstanding principal sums as\n                    well as furnish a bank guarantee for the interest and redemption premium. The\n                    utility of bank guarantees in relation to pre-judgment interest was somewhat\n                    limited as a party would still be kept out of his or her monies. However, the\n                    offer to pay the principal sums upfront should entail a significant reduction on\n                    the pre-judgment interest. In the circumstances, it would be fair to fix\n                    pre-judgment interest for the principal sums at 2% per annum computed from\n                    1 July 2008 to the day immediately prior to this judgment (based on a rough\n                    estimate of the average 6-month US$ LIBOR from July 2008 to July 2010).\n                    Pre-judgment interest for the contractual interest and redemption premium shall\n                    be fixed at 5.33% per annum for the same stated period, while post-judgment\n                    interest shall stand at 5.33%. 15     In conclusion, the following orders are\n                    made: a.For the Superon Note, Silverlink and/or Argent are\n                            to pay Superon the principal sum of US$6,391,182.00, interest at 5% per\n                            annum and redemption premium at 10% per annum computed from 15 July\n                            2003 to 30 June 2008. Simultaneous to the payment, Silverlink,\n                            Argent and Superon are to complete the transfers of shares as agreed in\n                            the Superon Repurchase.b.For the Rockline Note, Silverlink is to pay\n                            Rockline the principal sum of US$11,120,800.00, interest at 5% per annum\n                            and redemption premium at 10% per annum computed from 17 August\n                            2003 to 30 June 2008.c.Pre-judgment interest on the principal sums at\n                            2.00% per annum, and on the contractual interest and redemption premium\n                            at 5.33% per annum. The pre-judgment interest shall run from 1 July\n                            2008 to the day immediately prior to this judgment.d.Nominal damages of $100 are awarded to each of the\n                            two plaintiffs.e.Post-judgment interest on items (a)–(d)\n                            above are to run at 5.33% per annum.I will hear parties, including OHL, on costs at a later\n                date.[note: 1]Pg 30 of\n                                Plaintiffs’ submissions on Remedies[note: 2]Pg 26 and 76 of Plaintiffs’ submissions on\n                                Remedies[note: 3]Pg 34of the Defendants’ reply submissions on\n                                Remedies[note: 4]Pg 92 and 116\n                                of Plaintiffs’ submissions on\n                        Remedies[note: 5]Pg 50 of the Plaintiffs’ submissions on\n                            Remedies"
