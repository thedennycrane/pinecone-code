        "THE PLAINTIFFS’ CASE": "1 The Plaintiffs were the Defendants’ subcontractors appointed for\n\nthe purpose of supplying labour and equipment for carpentry and steel benders work,\n\ninstallation of pre-cast components and concreting works. These works will be referred to\n\nas structural works. The project in question was a public housing estate in Jurong West\n\ntermed N2C6. The Defendants were the main contractors appointed by the Housing &\n\nDevelopment Board (\"HDB\") on 30 May 1998 for this project.2 The project comprised one multi-storey carpark block (Block 276) and\n\nfive blocks (Blocks 274C, 276A, B, C and D) of residential units. The commencement date\n\nwas 22 June 1998 except for Block 276B whose commencement date was 6 July 1998. The\n\nstructural works of the entire project were initially subcontracted by the Defendants to\n\nKent Loong Construction Pte Ltd which commenced works in June 1998. In that same month,\n\nthe Defendants decided to take three blocks (Blocks 276B, C and D) out of Kent\n\nLoong’s scope of works and requested the Plaintiffs to give a quotation for doing the\n\nstructural works in respect of these three blocks.3 By a letter of award dated 16 July 1998, the Defendants awarded the\n\nsaid works for the three blocks including five linkways to the Plaintiffs. The period of\n\ncontract was stated as 22 June 1998 to 8 February 2000 although the Plaintiffs commenced\n\nwork only in July 1998. The contract sum was $3,250,000 on a lump sum basis except for\n\nvariations required by the HDB which shall be based on the Standard Schedule of Rates less\n\n10%. The Plaintiffs were required to provide 6,000 certified mandays and if monies were\n\ndeducted by the HDB for any shortfall, they shall be deducted from the Plaintiffs’\n\nentitlement. In respect of payment, the Plaintiffs were required to submit progress claims\n\nby the 29thand the 12thdays of each month and payments would be\n\nmade on the 3rdand the 18thdays respectively. If the submission\n\ndate was not met, payment in respect of that particular claim would only be made on the\n\nnext date of payment.4 As Kent Loong still could not cope with its remaining scope of works,\n\nthe Defendants awarded the works for the carpark block to the Plaintiffs as well on 30\n\nSeptember 1998. It was agreed that the value of the works for the carpark block would be\n\n$860,000, raising the entire subcontract sum to $4,110,000. The commencement date for this\n\nblock was stated as 1 September 1998 and the completion date as 25 November 1999.5 On 22 December 1998, the parties agreed to vary the dates for the\n\nsubmission of claims and payment. The fax from the Defendants to the Plaintiff dated 26\n\nDecember 1998 stated:\"We refer to our meeting on 22 December 1998.As agreed by both parties your payment shall be released on the 17thand 30thof every month. In view of this, you are requested to submit your\n\n  progress claim (for work done as at 12thand 25th) on every 12thand 25thof the month.Thank you.\"The Plaintiffs averred that the Defendants were obliged to pay on the\n\n17thand 30thdays for claims submitted within a reasonable time\n\nbefore those days and that the submission dates provided by the Defendants were only by\n\nway of request and were not pre-conditions for payment on the next payment dates.6 By a fax dated 2 February 1999, the Defendants required the\n\nPlaintiffs to increase the certified mandays from 6,000 to 7,560 in view of the additional\n\nblock (carpark) undertaken by the Plaintiffs. The fax also expressed the Defendants’\n\nconcern about the prevailing number of certified mandays as at the end of November 1998,\n\nreminded the Plaintiffs that \"the cost is $50 for every manday not provided\" and\n\nstated that they foresaw that the cost would be in the region of $250,000 (i.e. about\n\n5,000 mandays) at the conclusion of the Plaintiffs’ scope of works. The Defendants\n\nadded that that was \"the reason why we are still imposing a 10% retention on your\n\nvalue of work done\".7 The retention of 10% of the value of work done was objected to by the\n\nPlaintiffs.8 On 26 March 1999, the Plaintiffs submitted their 16thprogress claim for $404,501.60 for work done up to 25 March 1999. The Defendants failed to\n\npay that amount or any part thereof by 30 March 1999. On 10 April 1999, the\n\nPlaintiffs’ solicitors sent a letter of demand to the Defendants demanding payment of\n\nthis amount.9 On 12 April 1999, the Plaintiffs submitted their 17thprogress claim for $507,522.20. The Defendants’ Steven Soh reviewed their Quantity\n\nSurveyor’s certification of this progress claim and varied the amount due to\n\n$419,055.50.10 On 17 April 1999, the Defendants paid $128,230.88 on the 16thProgress Claim.11 On 19 April 1999, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors sent a letter of\n\ndemand to the Defendants’ solicitors demanding payment of $290,824.62, the balance\n\ndue under the certified 17thprogress claim. That same day, the Defendants sent\n\nby fax to the Plaintiffs a Variation Order omitting from their scope of works the\n\nstructural works to the lift motor room of the three residential blocks and to the motor\n\nroom of the carpark block, the installation of pre-cast parapet wall and the five\n\nlinkways, valued at $323,600. This was not accepted by the Plaintiffs. The omitted works\n\nwere given to Kent Loong to perform.12 The Plaintiffs averred that they had not been paid $290,824.62 (for\n\nwork done up to 12 April 1999) and another $113,588.40 for further work done up to 25\n\nApril 1999 when they left the project site. They only received a total of $3,206,826.00\n\nfrom the Defendants.13 On 23 April 1999, the Defendants’ solicitors wrote to the\n\nPlaintiffs’ solicitors that the payment of $128,230.88 had been agreed to be full and\n\nfinal payment of the 16thprogress claim and that the amount verified under the\n\n17thprogress claim amounted to a negative sum of $15,207.95. They also claimed\n\nthat the Plaintiffs had completed 89% of the contract but provided only 13.58% of the\n\nrequisite certified mandays. The Defendants therefore demanded the return of $128,230.88\n\n(if the Plaintiffs denied that that amount was full and final payment of the 16thprogress claim) and the said $15,207.95.14 On 24 April 1999, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to the\n\nDefendants’ solicitors to deny all their allegations and to state that the Plaintiffs\n\naccepted the Defendants’ repudiation of the contract.15 The Plaintiffs averred that it was within the contemplation of the\n\nparties and therefore a term of the agreement that the maximum retention sum was to be 5%\n\nof the contract sum of $4,110,000, which would be $205,500. Instead the Defendants held\n\nback 10% of the value of works as the retention sum without regard to the 5% overall\n\nlimit.16 The Plaintiffs therefore claimed $404,413.02 (i.e. $290,824.62 +\n\n$113,588.40 as indicated in paragraph 12 above) or, alternatively, quantum meruit. This\n\nwas revised at the trial to $405,443.02 because of an erroneous belief by the Plaintiffs\n\nthat the total contract sum was slightly higher. They also claimed the value of the\n\nomitted works ($323,600) or loss of profits or damages for wrongful repudiation. They\n\nfurther claimed the retention sum held by the Defendants or, alternatively, damages.17 The Plaintiffs called five witnesses and one expert. Teo Tian Yeo,\n\nthe Project Co-ordinator of the Plaintiffs, testified that he was involved in the\n\nadministrative aspects of the N2C6 project. He was not on site but the Plaintiffs’\n\nsite engineer, Thuan Khac Nguyen, would show him all the correspondence between the\n\nPlaintiffs and the Defendants. Initially, the working relationship between the parties was\n\ngood.18 In late August 1998 or so, Lawrence Soh, the Managing Director of\n\nthe Defendants, informed the Plaintiffs’ Managing Director (Phua Choon Seng), Kent\n\nLoong’s Managing Director and Teo to attend a meeting which was held at about 8 pm at\n\nthe Defendants’ office. At this meeting, Lawrence Soh said that the Defendants were\n\nunable to pay the monies due to the Plaintiffs and to Kent Loong on time as the HDB had\n\nnot paid the Defendants and told them to anticipate such delays in payment. He also told\n\nthem not to divulge this information to other subcontractors. No minutes of the meeting\n\nwere taken.19 Since that meeting in August 1998, the Defendants had been irregular\n\nin payment and had totally refused to pay on the 16thand 17thprogress claims. As a result, the Plaintiffs experienced great financial difficulty and\n\nwere unable to pay their workers and their subcontractors, who, although unhappy, carried\n\non with their work according to schedule after the Plaintiffs persuaded them to. However,\n\nthe Plaintiffs could not proceed any further and had to accept the Defendants’ breach\n\nof contract or face further financial losses.20 Wong Kim Yong, the Plaintiffs’ foreman, joined the N2C6 project\n\nin August 1998. He would accompany the representatives from the Defendants and the HDB on\n\njoint inspections held about once every two weeks. Whenever there were complaints of\n\ndefects, he would instruct the Plaintiffs’ workers or subcontractors to rectify them.21 The HDB would give a progress report after each inspection to the\n\nDefendants indicating whether they could proceed to the next stage of work. Although the\n\nPlaintiffs were not given a copy of such reports, the Defendants would notify Wong if\n\nthere was a negative report and the Plaintiffs would have to rectify the defects before\n\nproceeding further. Between August 1998 to March 1999, there were only complaints of minor\n\ndefects, expected in any construction project.22 In about March 1999, the Defendants started withholding payment to\n\nthe Plaintiffs resulting in the Plaintiffs being unable to pay their workers and\n\nsubcontractors. Inspite of that, the work progressed without delay.23 Thuan Khac Nguyen was the Plaintiffs’ site engineer from mid\n\nAugust 1998 to June 1999. He testified via video-conferencing facilities from Victoria,\n\nAustralia. In his statement of intended evidence-in-chief, he said that he prepared the 16thprogress claim on 25 March 1999 with a letter accompanying the same. He then approached\n\nthe Defendants’ site manager to verify the claim and to get feedback from him. Some\n\ndifferences and typographical errors were discovered and, as a result, he had to amend the\n\nprogress claim and submit it formally the next day. Since the spreadsheet programme he was\n\nusing had an auto-date function, the print-out showed the date as 26 March 1999.\n\nEssentially the new print out showed the claim was increased by some $20,000.24 When the expected payment did not arrive on 30 March 1999, the\n\nPlaintiffs waited a few more days before checking with the Defendants’ head office.\n\nWhen they contacted the Defendants’ Project Director, Steven Soh, he told them that\n\nthe cheque had been issued but was awaiting the signature of the Defendants’ other\n\ndirector who was then overseas.25 The Plaintiffs waited another week and when that other director\n\nreturned, Thuan asked Steven Soh repeatedly about the payment. Each time, Steven Soh would\n\nask him to wait. In the meantime, the Plaintiffs’ workers were getting frustrated and\n\nangry as they had been receiving late and partial payments. Steven Soh raised some concern\n\nabout the workers’ unwillingness to take instructions and to work overtime and Thuan\n\nexplained to him that the Plaintiffs must receive payment on their 16thprogress claim.26 Steven Soh then told Thuan that if they could finish the casting for\n\nthe roof slab of Block 276C, he would release the payment for the 16thprogress\n\nclaim. Thuan then urged the workers to speed up and they managed to complete the work.\n\nHowever, Steven Soh did not keep his promise.27 Steven Soh then asked them to complete the carpark roof, again\n\npromising payment on the 16thprogress claim thereafter. The Plaintiffs did\n\nthat but Steven Soh reneged on his promise again and asked them to carry out another job.28 When that was completed, Steven Soh handed a cheque to Thuan on 17\n\nApril 1999, more than two weeks past the due date of 30 March 1999, but only for\n\n$128,230.88. Thuan was also shown a letter from the Defendants which he was asked to sign.\n\nAs he thought it was only an acknowledgment of receipt of the said letter, Thuan signed.\n\nThat letter dated 17 April 1999 on the Defendants’ letterhead stated:\"We acknowledge receipt for the payment of $128,230.88 for\n\n  progress payment No. 16 and agreed that it is the agreed valuation of work done as at 25\n\n  Mar’ 99.\"29 After Thuan had signed that letter, the Defendants asked him to\n\nplace the Plaintiffs’ company stamp on it. He then realized that the reason for that\n\nrequest was to make that letter appear as the Plaintiffs’ and that the Defendants\n\nwere attempting to use underhanded tactics to extract an agreement from the Plaintiffs\n\nregarding the payment. He then told the Defendants that he could not accede to their\n\nrequest as he had not agreed that the said amount was to be the valuation or the full and\n\nfinal payment for the 16thprogress claim.30 Thuan added in oral testimony that the Plaintiffs’ workers and\n\nsubcontractors were on site in April 1999 and that all the roof slabs of the blocks in\n\nquestion had been cast. Most of the defects were minor. He was confident that the\n\nPlaintiffs would have finished the entire works by August 1999 if they did not have to\n\nleave the site. He estimated that it would have taken the Plaintiffs 12 to 14 months to\n\ncomplete the blocks in question. He did not remember anyone telling him that the\n\nstructural works had to be completed by June 1999.31 Thuan did not know who filled in the number of workers in the\n\nDefendants’ daily manpower record. He did not recall the number of workers from the\n\nPlaintiffs to be as low as the records indicated.32 Although the progress claim was to document all work done up to the\n\nday of submission, Thuan would have preferred that the cut-off date for works done be at\n\nleast a day before the submission date. Thuan prepared the 16thprogress claim\n\nalthough he did not sign it. He had discovered that the amount paid by the Defendants was\n\nusually less than what the Plaintiffs had claimed and so he tried to check with the\n\nDefendants’ engineer before formally submitting the 16thprogress claim as\n\nhe wanted to minimize the discrepancies. It was already past 5 pm on 25 March 1999 when\n\nthe difference and errors were noted and the Defendants asked him why not bring the\n\nprogress claim the next day. He did not think that if he submitted on 26 March 1999, the\n\npayment would not be made on 30 March 1999.33 Thuan reiterated that when he was told to sign the acknowledgment\n\nletter on 17 April 1999, he had not received his March salary which was usually paid at\n\nthe end of the month. Since he was a foreigner working here, he needed the money to pay\n\nhis rent. The Plaintiffs’ workers wanted their salaries too. The Defendants’\n\nrepresentative – he was not sure whether it was Steven Soh – told him that he\n\nwould hand over the cheque only if he signed that letter. Therefore, although he knew it\n\nwas not merely an acknowledgment of receipt, he signed it. He thought it was alright\n\nanyway as the 16thprogress claim was for works done up to 25 March 1999 and\n\nthe Plaintiffs could claim progressively in the next claim.34 Thuan agreed that the first few progress claims were paid promptly\n\nbut commented that the time of payment lengthened and the discrepancy between the amounts\n\npaid and the amounts claimed increased in respect of the later progress claims.35 He left the Plaintiffs at the end of his one-year employment pass.\n\nHe and his wife decided to return to Australia because the economic climate there looked\n\nbrighter than that for Asia then. He was currently working for an Australian local council\n\ncalled Wyndham City Council. He could not take leave to come to Singapore to testify as he\n\nhad taken two and a half weeks of leave during the New Year season and to do so again\n\nmight affect his career prospects. Asked whether his reason for not returning to Singapore\n\nwas due to a bankruptcy order made against him on 10 December 1999, Thuan claimed that he\n\nwas not aware of such order. He acknowledged that he and his wife had several credit cards\n\nand owed money on them but both of them were working to pay off the credit card debts.36 Thuan added in re-examination that the Defendants had not intimated\n\nthat the 16thprogress claim was submitted one day late and had not discussed\n\nwith him the quantum of payment at all. After he was told to sign the letter dated 17\n\nApril 1999, he was actually told to sign another letter with the same content but, as he\n\nremembered it, without any letterhead. He refused to sign the second letter. It was\n\nbecause of this that he felt something was wrong or unusual and that caused him to look at\n\nthe wording again and he noticed that it forced him to accept the valuation.37 Mock Sang Shen was the Plaintiffs’ site supervisor. He was\n\nassigned to the N2C6 project around October 1998. He would accompany Thuan and Wong (the\n\nforeman) on the joint inspections with HDB and the Defendants. He was also responsible for\n\nensuring that the works progressed according to the Defendants’ schedule provided to\n\nall the Defendants’ subcontractors during the weekly site meetings. The rest of his\n\ntestimony was essentially the same as Wong’s.38 Asked what minor defects they had to rectify, Mock explained that\n\nthey were things such as non-alignment of the formwork and some gaps. These were rectified\n\nimmediately.39 Mock agreed that it would take about five to six months to complete\n\none block of 16 floors on an average of two to three floors per month. Thuan would give\n\nthe detailed instructions on the time-cycle for casting.40 Phua Choon Seng was the Project Manager and effective head of the\n\nPlaintiffs. He stated that the Defendants persistently breached their payment obligations\n\nby paying late or making only partial payments. As this caused unhappiness among the\n\nPlaintiffs’ workers, Phua protested frequently to the Defendants, in particular\n\nSteven Soh. As a result, Lawrence Soh (Steven’s brother) proposed that the submission\n\ndates be brought forward by a few days so as to give the Defendants more time to pay the\n\nPlaintiffs. The Plaintiffs were in fact disadvantaged by the new arrangements as their\n\ncut-off date for claims would be the 25thday while they had to pay their\n\nworkers up to the end of the month. The change was meant to accommodate the Defendants. It\n\nwas impracticable to evaluate the work done up to the day of submission as there would\n\nusually be overtime work up to 10 pm. The Plaintiffs could therefore submit their claims\n\nthe following day only.41 In respect of the 16thprogress claim, Phua was handed a\n\ncopy of the table, containing the computation of the work done, by Thuan. The table also\n\ncontained the assessment done by Steven Soh and countersigned by him. Steven Soh would\n\nadjust the percentages of the work done. It was in keeping with past experience that the\n\nDefendants would under-evaluate the progress claim. However, as such claims were interim\n\nin nature and to avert unnecessary arguments, the Plaintiffs would not normally dispute\n\nthe Defendants’ adjustments.42 Even if the percentages adjusted by Steven Soh were correct, the\n\namount due on the 16thprogress claim would be $282,549.60. It was therefore\n\nnot true that the Plaintiffs had agreed the value of the 16thprogress claim\n\nwas to be $128,230.88. There were also fundamental differences between the parties\n\nconcerning the retention sum held back by the Defendants.43 The Defendants had also breached their payment obligations by\n\nfailing to pay the 17thprogress claim by 17 April 1999 when that claim was\n\nsubmitted on 12 April 1999 as stipulated.44 Phua denied any delay on the part of the Plaintiffs in performing\n\ntheir scope of works. After the Plaintiffs’ solicitors’ letter of demand dated\n\n10 April 1999, the Defendants unilaterally and wrongfully engaged Kent Loong to take over\n\nthe remaining works while the Plaintiffs were still carrying out the works on site. Phua\n\nwas confident that the works would have been completed in another four months (i.e. by\n\nAugust 1999) if the Defendants had not repudiated the contract and that would be way\n\nbefore the completion date of 8 February 2000 stipulated. The Plaintiffs had therefore\n\nlost profits on the remaining works which Phua estimated to be about 15% of the value of\n\nsuch works.45 Phua went on to state that it was the usual practice in the\n\nconstruction industry to have a retention sum of 10% of the value of the works done\n\nsubject to a maximum of 5% of the contract sum (which would work out to $206,500). Phua\n\nwas wrong in computing this figure as he thought the total contract sum was somewhat more\n\nthan the said $4,110,000. However, the Defendants deducted a retention sum of $366,314.00\n\nin their 16thprogress payment despite the Plaintiffs’ oral and written\n\nprotests.46 In respect of the revision of the number of certified mandays from\n\n6,000 to 7,560 on 2 February 1999, the Plaintiffs had not been informed of the increase\n\nuntil then. In any event, the Plaintiffs replied on 4 February 1999 to state that they\n\nwere confident they would be able to meet the target by the time the works were completed.\n\nIt was unfair to deduct alleged penalties when the contract had provided that deduction\n\nwould only be made if HDB did so from the Defendants. Even if there was a shortfall in the\n\nmandays, the Defendants would have to prove that it was attributable to the Plaintiffs and\n\nnot to the other subcontractor involved in the project.47 Phua elaborated on how he estimated profits to be 15% of the value\n\nof the works. The overheads for salaries (for him, his employees and his labourers) would\n\nbe about $30,500 per month. Divided by four blocks, that would work out to be $7,625 per\n\nblock. If two floors were cast each month, each floor would incur overheads of almost\n\n$4,000 per month. He paid his subcontractors slightly more than $41,000 per floor. The\n\nDefendants would however pay the Plaintiffs $57,600 per floor (although it was a lump sum\n\ncontract). The Plaintiffs would therefore make about $12,600 in profit per floor (i.e.\n\n$57,600 minus $4,000 and $41,000). $12,600 out of $57,600 would be 21.8% profit. Therefore\n\nhis claim of 15% profit was reasonable. It was clarified later that his computation of\n\nsalaries did not take into account CPF contributions.48 Where the wastage of concrete alleged by the Defendants was\n\nconcerned, Phua testified that the Defendants, as the main contractors, did the ordering\n\nof concrete and had never complained of any wastage by the Plaintiffs. The wastage, if\n\nany, would be half to one cubic metre of concrete in any event. The Defendants’ other\n\nsubcontractors (e.g. for sanitary works, for drainwork and the apron slab) would also use\n\nconcrete. Even the Defendants themselves would use concrete for the base of the tower\n\ncrane. No record of concrete usage was given by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs.49 Phua said in cross-examination he did not know that the completion\n\ndate (8 February 2000) for the Plaintiffs’ works was the same as that in the main\n\ncontract between the HDB and the Defendants. The non-structural works (architectural,\n\nplumbing and M & E) did not need to wait until all the structural works were\n\ncompleted. They could follow the Plaintiffs upwards as they completed each floor.50 The Plaintiffs had about 40 skilled labourers capable of logging\n\nabout 1200 mandays per month. Phua was therefore certain that the Plaintiffs would be able\n\nto meet the requisite mandays requirement by the end of the contracted works.51 Phua was then referred to the subcontract wherein wastage of\n\nconcrete was to be limited to 3%. Phua said that not every slab casting used the same\n\nquantity of concrete. The Plaintiffs had never checked the exact quantity of concrete\n\nused.52 For the pre-cast slab at the carpark block, the Plaintiffs would\n\nhoist up the pre-cast plans and then do the steel work and casting. The pre-cast\n\nrectangular plans would be joined one after the other. If there was leakage, that would be\n\nthe manufacturers’ fault. Shown photographs taken of the carpark, Phua agreed that\n\nthere were small ponding problems.53 As for the bulging concrete, Phua explained that there were bound to\n\nbe some problems in casting concrete and that the bulging concrete problems here were\n\nsmall. It was not necessary to use skilled workers to erect the formwork.54 The required number of certified mandays was met cumulatively month\n\nto month although the figures were submitted each month for the previous month. The\n\nPlaintiffs had submitted the necessary documents for certifying mandays to the Defendants\n\nby fax. When the Plaintiffs left the site in April 1999, no submission was made in May\n\n1999 by the Defendants to the HDB.55 Asked whether there was an advance payment of $222,665.40 on 9\n\nOctober 1998 for the 5thprogress claim, Phua said there was none. The payment\n\nwas actually made in two instalments. From this claim onwards, the Defendants asked Phua\n\nto change the dates of submission to the 5thand 20thdays of the\n\nmonth with the respective payment dates also changed to 10thand 25th.\n\nPhua did not mention this in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief as the only progress\n\nclaims in issue then were the 16thand the 17thprogress claims. He\n\ndisagreed that there were other advance payments.56 In December 1998, there was another change in the dates for\n\nsubmission and payment. Phua insisted that the Defendants give him a letter which they did\n\non 26 December 1998. Phua maintained that the submission date did not need to be strictly\n\nadhered to as delays of a few days were quite common.57 The 13thprogress claim dated 5 February 1999 was in\n\nrespect of works done up to 10 February 1999 because that was an exceptional case. Chinese\n\nNew Year was round the corner and the Defendants wanted the Plaintiffs to make an estimate\n\nof the work done until they stopped work before the festivities.58 Asked whether the Plaintiffs’ workers would work overtime if\n\nthe works were proceeding according to schedule, Phua said that the earlier the work was\n\ndone, the earlier the subcontractors would be paid. He would therefore always press his\n\nsubcontractors to work longer hours.59 In respect of the letter dated 17 April 1999 which Thuan had signed\n\nwhen he received the Defendants’ cheque for $128,230.88, Phua explained that Thuan\n\nhad told him that the Defendants wanted him to sign a letter failing which they would not\n\nrelease the cheque to the Plaintiffs. Thinking that it was only an acknowledgment of\n\nreceipt, Phua told Thuan to go ahead and sign. It was only later when Phua saw the letter\n\nbrought back by Thuan to the office for the company’s stamp to be affixed that he\n\nrealized what the contents were. Phua did not accept that letter and therefore refused to\n\naffix the company’s stamp on it. Subsequently, the Defendants asked Thuan to sign\n\nanother letter but he refused to do so.60 Phua insisted that the Plaintiffs’ workers were on site until\n\n24 April 1999 although the Defendants’ manpower record showed otherwise from 12 April\n\n1999. Phua conjectured that it could have been due to the Plaintiffs’ foreman failing\n\nto report the daily workforce on site. He pointed out that Steven Soh’s Affidavit of\n\nEvidence-in-Chief acknowledged that the Plaintiffs left the site \"sometime about 20\n\nApril 1999\" and also produced some job cards of the Plaintiffs’ workers which\n\nindicated that they were on site until 24 April 1999. The Plaintiffs’ subcontractors\n\nhad also made claims for payment on 13 April 1999 and 22 April 1999.61 Phua was then referred to the Defendants’ draft letter dated 16\n\nApril 1999 which was not sent out. That letter, addressed to the attention of Phua, read:\"Further to meeting with yourself, Mr Raymond and Mr Thuan K. N.\n\n  on the 14thApr 99, we tabulate the following as discussed:Jia Chen Constn PL will continue to complete all outstanding works with\n\n  diligent.1. The following will be omitted from work as omission variations:• Lift motor room• Installation of precast parapet wall• Linkways• Roof fascia…\"Phua denied having attended any meeting on 14 April 1999 or giving any\n\nconsent to have the works omitted. It was also the first time he was looking at this\n\nletter (which was tendered only during the trial).62 In re-examination, Phua explained that the practice on retention\n\nsums was as follows. For external subcontractors, after the plastering work was completed,\n\n2.5% would be released by the main contractors. After the paintwork was completed, the\n\nother 2.5% would also be released. For labour subcontractors, the retention sum of 5%\n\nwould be released after the external plastering work was completed.63 The final witness for the Plaintiffs was Francis Teo Teng Siu, a\n\nQuality Surveyor and the sole proprietor of a firm engaged in quantity surveying and\n\ncontractual claims for construction projects. In his report, Francis Teo stated that he\n\nwas instructed by the Plaintiffs to review the valuation carried out by the\n\nDefendants’ expert, Paul Tan Keng Hoon, on the outstanding works and rectification of\n\ndefective works as at 26 April 1999.64 The first comment that Francis Teo had on Paul Tan’s report was\n\nthat the latter’s list of items of outstanding and defective works was too brief.\n\nSizes and quantities of works, necessary for accurate pricing, were omitted. No drawings,\n\nplans and photographs were annexed to that report. The report was therefore subjective and\n\nunreliable.65 Paul Tan adopted the HDB’s Standard Schedule of Rates for the\n\npricing of the outstanding works and the rectification of defective works but added 15% as\n\nestablishment charges and profit. That was tantamount to saying that a main contractor and\n\nnot a subcontractor, would be engaged in place of the Plaintiffs.66 The valuation method adopted by Paul Tan was, in Francis Teo’s\n\nopinion, wrong. The subcontract stipulated that variations shall be valued based on the\n\nstandard schedule of rates less 10%.67 Paul Tan’s pricing was inconsistent. For instance, the rate for\n\nrectification of bulging concrete beams at various locations was $145.44 throughout\n\nirrespective of the number of defective concrete beams. Similarly, for bulging concrete\n\nbeams, the rate adopted varied from $18.18 to $96.96. The valuation should be based on the\n\nlower rates worked out by Paul Tan. There was therefore an over-pricing of some 51.08%.68 The valuation of the outstanding works should be $314,791.75 and\n\nthat for the rectification works was $15,016.66, making a total of $329,808.41. The value\n\nof the Plaintiffs work as at 26 April 1999 was therefore $4,110,000 minus $329,808.41,\n\nwhich was $3,780,191.59.69 In cross-examination, Francis Teo agreed that his valuation of the\n\ndefects was based on Paul Tan’s report only and not on site visits. Asked whether a\n\npremium had to be paid to a subcontractor brought in to replace the original\n\nsubcontractor, Francis Teo replied that that was the general belief but the market\n\nconditions in Singapore were very important factors. From January 1998 to January 1999,\n\nconstruction costs had gone down 20%. Paul Tan stated that his pricing reflected the\n\nmarket price but he used the HDB rates as at January 1998. The labour-rate method should\n\nnot be used for the outstanding works. Instead, the volume of concrete work should be\n\ncalculated and the market rate for labour per cubic metre applied. Rectification of\n\ndefective works would always cost 50% or even 100% more than new or outstanding work. The\n\nrates for rectification works could not therefore be used for outstanding works.70 Francis Teo disagreed with the suggestion that skilled labour was\n\nrequired for hacking works. He stated that only one labourer and one skilled worker were\n\nneeded.THE DEFENDANTS’ CASE71 Steven Soh, the Project Director and a shareholder of the\n\nDefendants, affirmed two Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief. After setting out the terms of\n\nthe subcontract awarded to the Plaintiffs, Steven Soh said that by virtue of the letter\n\ndated 26 December 1998, confirming the agreement made on 22 December 1998, the parties\n\nagreed to a variation of the submission and payment dates (i.e. 12thfor\n\npayment on 17th, 25thfor payment on 30th). Since the 16thprogress claim was submitted on 26 March 1999, payment was due only on 17 April 1999 and\n\nthe Defendants did pay $128,230.88 on that date.72 The Defendants would not pay the full amount claimed in each\n\nprogress claim but would have their site engineers assess the value of work done at the\n\nsite and pay accordingly. The Plaintiffs had accepted the Defendants’ assessments all\n\nalong. The Plaintiffs were therefore not entitled to claim a breach of agreement when the\n\nDefendants paid only $128,230.88 on the 16thprogress claim on 17 April 1999.\n\nThe Plaintiffs’ Thuan had accepted the cheque for that amount and acknowledged it as\n\nthe agreed valuation of work done as at 25 March 1999.73 Steven Soh denied that he had certified the amount due to the\n\nPlaintiffs as $419,055.50 as at 12 April 1999. The Defendants had assessed the value of\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ work as $3,663,280.00 in their 17thprogress claim and,\n\nafter accounting for all requisite payments and deductions, there was an overpayment of\n\n$15,207.95. The Defendants had also deducted $285,505.00 as provision for shortage of\n\ncertified mandays.74 Any contractor involved in HDB projects would know the requirement\n\nof the HDB for certified mandays and that a penalty of $50 would be deducted for each\n\nshortfall of one manday. This was provided in the main contract with the HDB. The records\n\nsubmitted by the Plaintiffs to the Defendants showed that the Plaintiffs provided only\n\n1,371 certified mandays between August 1998 to December 1998. The Plaintiffs would\n\ntherefore have had to provide another 6,189 certified mandays to meet the requirement of\n\n7,560 within the next four months as that was the end of the period by which the\n\nPlaintiffs must complete their works. At the end of December 1998, the Plaintiffs had been\n\npaid some 45% of the total contract value but had provided only 18% of the manday\n\nrequirement.75 The Defendants were extremely anxious about this shortfall and hence\n\nwrote to the Plaintiffs on 2 February 1999 and 9 September 1999 to highlight the issue.\n\nOral reminders were also given. The Defendants had a right to retain any monies due on the\n\nshortfall. The HDB would not recognize the mandays of workers whose CPF or levy had not\n\nbeen paid by the Plaintiffs and a number of the Plaintiffs’ workers’ CPF and\n\nlevy were not paid.76 On 19 April 1999 or so, when Steven Soh noted that the Plaintiffs\n\nhad made no attempts to increase their certified mandays, he instructed his engineer to\n\nwithhold $285,050.00 being the estimated shortfall of 5,701 mandays as at 24 April 1999.\n\nAs a result of this deduction from the 17thprogress claim, the Plaintiffs were\n\noverpaid by $15,207.95.77 After the Plaintiffs started work at the site, problems began to\n\nsurface. In October and in November 1998, two of the Plaintiffs’ workers were found\n\nto have forged work permits. From January 1999, the Defendants complained in writing about\n\nthe slow progress of works. On 25 March 1999, the Defendants wrote to record a meeting\n\nwith the Plaintiffs’ Mock on 17 March 1999 where it was agreed that the Defendants\n\nwould provide their own men to carry out housekeeping works.78 Steven Soh went on to state that sometime around 20 April 1999, the\n\nDefendants realized that the Plaintiffs had practically stopped all work on site. They had\n\nalso received the Plaintiffs’ solicitors’ letter dated 10 April 1999 demanding\n\npayment on the 16thprogress claim even though it was not due. As the\n\nPlaintiffs were in a litigious mood and did not wish to mobilize their workers to fulfil\n\ntheir contractual obligations, the Defendants had no choice but to engage Kent Loong to\n\nhelp out in providing labour. The Defendants then instructed their solicitors to write to\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ solicitors that the Defendants accepted the Plaintiffs’\n\nrepudiation of the contract by abandoning the works and a letter dated 26 April 1999 was\n\nsent accordingly.79 When the letter of demand dated 10 April 1999 was received in\n\nrespect of the 16thprogress claim, the Defendants were very busy trying to\n\ncomplete the project in view of the delays caused by the Plaintiffs. Instead of engaging\n\nin litigation, Steven Soh authorized payment of $128,230.88 to the Plaintiffs being the\n\nvalue of the work assessed by the Defendants. He took the precaution of getting the\n\nPlaintiffs’ Thuan to sign the letter dated 17 April 1999 because of the\n\nPlaintiffs’ solicitors’ letter of demand. Thuan was the Plaintiffs’ site\n\nengineer and was expected to have full authority to acknowledge payment and to agree on\n\nthe value of the work done.80 That same day (17 April 1999), the Defendants’ solicitors wrote\n\nto the Plaintiffs’ solicitors to inform them that the 16thprogress claim\n\nhad been settled.81 Steven Soh was shocked when the Plaintiffs’ solicitors replied\n\non 19 April 1999 denying that the payment was full and final payment of the 16thprogress claim and went on to demand payment on the 17thprogress claim. By\n\nthat time, he was certain that the Plaintiffs were no longer interested in carrying on\n\nwith the contract and, being concerned about the shortfall in the number of mandays,\n\ninstructed that $285,050 be held back. He also instructed that the variation order dated\n\n19 April 1999 be issued to omit the uncompleted works (mentioned earlier) from the\n\nPlaintiffs’ scope of works.82 The Plaintiffs’ work was assessed at $3,663,280 by the\n\nDefendants. That meant that they had not completed works to the value of $446,720 (i.e.\n\n$4,110,000 minus $3,663,280). The Defendants then engaged their expert, Paul Tan, to\n\nevaluate the costs of completing the outstanding works and of rectification of the\n\ndefective works. The total indicated was $1,138,787.72. From the report, the Defendants\n\nwould need to pay $1,101,559.88 to Kent Loong just to finish up the uncompleted works.\n\nAfter deducting the retention sum and the value of the uncompleted works left by the\n\nPlaintiffs, the Defendants would have to pay an extra $368,000 or so to Kent Loong.83 Besides incurring this amount of damages, the Defendants would also\n\nhave to pay the costs of rectification of defective works estimated at some $37,000 as at\n\n15 June 1999. More defects had surfaced between then and October 1999 and the Defendants\n\nwould be asking Paul Tan to assess the costs of the additional defects when the project\n\nwas ready to be handed over to the HDB. Further, the Plaintiffs had provided only 4,584\n\nmandays, a shortfall of 2,976, the penalty for which would be $148,800. There were also\n\npotential liquidated damages resulting from the delays caused by the Plaintiffs. The total\n\nquantifiable losses would therefore be more than $550,000 (excluding the additional\n\ndefects and the possible liquidated damages and the retention sum held by the Defendants).\n\nSuch retention sum would be held back until after the expiry of the defects liability\n\nperiod of one year after hand over to the HDB. The Plaintiffs had also not constructed the\n\nheight of the kitchens according to specifications, resulting in insufficient floor\n\nclearance to install the door frames. The length of the kitchens was also 7,100 mm for\n\nBlocks 276B and 276D instead of the stipulated 7,000 mm. The Defendants were concerned\n\nthat further damages would be imposed on them as a result of all this.84 The above stated losses formed the subject of the Defendants’\n\nCounterclaim against the Plaintiffs. In the course of the trial, the Defendants added a\n\nfurther Counterclaim for concrete wastage beyond the 3% allowance in the agreement.\n\nAccordingly, the Defendants asked that Judgment be given to them with damages to be\n\nassessed after the completion of the N2C6 project.85 In oral testimony, Steven Soh corrected his first Affidavit of\n\nEvidence-in-Chief by adding that there were two new subcontractors who replaced the\n\nPlaintiffs – Kent Loong did the formwork and steel work while Goh Beng Huat did the\n\nconcreting work. In respect of the draft letter dated 16 April 1999 to the Plaintiffs\n\nconcerning the omitted works, Steven Soh explained that it was drafted by Koh Lee Seng,\n\nthe Defendants’ Contracts Manager, who asked for his comments and approval but the\n\nletter was not sent due to an oversight on the part of the Defendants.86 In his second Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief filed in response to\n\nPhua’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief, Thuan’s Statement of Intended Evidence\n\nand the amendments made to the Statement of Claim, Steven Soh stated that the Defendants\n\nhad made advance payments to the Plaintiffs on 23 December 1998, 18 January 1999, 1 and 13\n\nFebruary 1999. He denied that Phua had made many complaints about alleged late payments to\n\nhim. The parties only held informal discussions on payment issues. The Defendants had\n\nnumerous other projects and numerous subcontractors and the Defendants had proposed the\n\nchanges to the dates of submission and payment only as an administrative and procedural\n\nmeasure to lighten the burden on their quantity surveyors who had to deal with all the\n\nclaims of the various subcontractors at the same time previously. The Plaintiffs had never\n\ndenied that they had consented to the variation.87 Steven Soh also denied using \"underhanded tactics\" as\n\nalleged by the Plaintiffs to create the acknowledgment signed by Thuan on 17 April 1999.\n\nSince Thuan was authorised to act for the Plaintiffs and he had agreed on the valuation,\n\nit was logical to require the Plaintiffs’ company stamp to be placed on the document.88 As at the date of his testimony in Court, the rectification works\n\nwere still proceeding.89 In cross-examination, Steven Soh said he was in charge of two HDB\n\nprojects at the material time and that he was stationed on site. The contract value of the\n\nproject in question between the Defendants and the HDB was $42,644,444.00. Initially, Kent\n\nLoong was the subcontractor for all the structural works but it could not cope due to lack\n\nof manpower and after discussions, it was agreed that the Defendants subcontract some of\n\nthe blocks to others and that was done on 16 July 1998. Kent Loong’s subcontract\n\nwould be similar to that of the Plaintiffs. The carpark block was likewise removed from\n\nKent Loong’s scope of works and given to the Plaintiffs on 30 September 1998.\n\nAlthough time was lost, Kent Loong had in fact done some of the works by the relevant\n\ndates.90 The \"Standard Schedule of Rates\" mentioned in the\n\nsubcontract referred to rates fixed as between the Defendants and the HDB. The\n\nsubcontractor’s rates would be 10% less. Asked whether the works omitted from the\n\nPlaintiffs’ scope in April 1999 would therefore be given to Kent Loong for the same\n\nvalue, Steven Soh said that because of time constraints then, he gave an assurance to Kent\n\nLoong that he would reimburse Kent Loong for any extra expenses incurred which could be\n\nworked out at a later date.91 As at August 1999, the requirements on mandays had been met. This\n\nwas confirmed in a report by the HDB received by the Defendants on 29 November 1998. The\n\nDefendants had retained 10% of the value of works done in respect of both Kent Loong and\n\nthe Plaintiffs and all other subcontractors because of the projected shortfall in mandays,\n\nwhich were cumulative figures until the end of the subcontract. There was no specific\n\ntarget per month for the number of mandays. While Steven Soh agreed that the Plaintiffs\n\ncould have complied with the mandays requirement if they had carried on for another four\n\nmonths or so, he said that was premised on the proper signing in of the records and the\n\npayment of CPF and levy by the Plaintiffs.92 As experienced subcontractors, the Plaintiffs should know when they\n\nmust complete their works although the subcontract stated the completion date as 8\n\nFebruary 2000. This date was inserted because the Plaintiffs had to build the linkways as\n\nwell and it was difficult to estimate when they would be constructed. The Plaintiffs\n\nshould know that there would be a time gap between the structural works and the building\n\nof the linkways during which they could do rectification works.93 Progress claims would have to be vetted by the Project Manager of\n\nthe Defendants first, then by Steven Soh before they were submitted to the\n\nDefendants’ Quantity Surveyor together with his comments for processing. Steven Soh\n\nwould have the same intimate knowledge of the work done as the Project Manager as he would\n\nwalk around the site. He disagreed with Phua’s evidence that the submission dates\n\nwere changed from the 12thand 29thdays to the 5thand\n\n20thdays from progress claim number 4 onwards. There was no discussion to\n\naffect such a change between Phua and Steven Soh’s brother (Lawrence) as Lawrence\n\nwould have informed him about it.94 The advance payments were made out of goodwill by the Defendants as\n\nPhua had appealed to them for help. They were also conditional upon the good progress of\n\nthe works.95 Asked whether the Defendants had defaulted in paying on the 8thprogress claim by paying in three instalments, Steven Soh disagreed and said there was no\n\nproblem at that time and no complaint was raised by the Plaintiffs. He pointed out that\n\nsome payments were made on the very day of the submission of the claims. The Plaintiffs\n\ncould not expect the full claim to be paid each time as the HDB also deducted from the\n\nDefendants’ claims. He also maintained that some were advance payments as stated in\n\nthe Payment Vouchers and were not part payments. In fact, payment number 13A was a\n\nseparate deal between the Defendants and the Plaintiffs’ subcontractor whereby the\n\nDefendants agreed to reward the latter $30,000 if they could complete the carpark slab and\n\nthey did. However, $20,000 out of the $30,000 were taken by the Plaintiffs who paid only\n\n$10,000 to their subcontractor.96 Asked whether he constantly under-certified the amounts payable,\n\nSteven Soh explained that the valuation given by the Defendants’ site staff was still\n\nsubject to his scrutiny. The Defendants’ site engineer could have made some errors in\n\nthe certification. Steven Soh said he might have made some adjustments which he has\n\nforgotten about now.97 Steven Soh disagreed that the letter dated 26 December 1998 changing\n\nthe dates of submission and payment did not make compliance with the submission deadlines\n\na pre-condition for payment on the next available date. He also disagreed that Thuan could\n\nexpect payment on the 16thprogress claim by 30 March 1999 and not 17 April\n\n1999 based on the previous conduct of the parties. The Defendants’ directors could of\n\ncourse waive strict compliance with the submission deadlines if the Plaintiffs were doing\n\ntheir work well and they were not.98 Steven Soh said there was no contractual document between the\n\nDefendants on the one hand and Kent Loong and Goh Beng Huat on the other in respect of the\n\nworks omitted from the Plaintiffs’ scope in April 1999. The agreement was verbal only\n\nbecause of the time constraints. Asked when the new subcontractors were engaged to do the\n\nomitted works, Steven Soh could only remember that it was not long after the Plaintiffs\n\nhad left the site around 24 April 1999. Asked whether Kent Loong had been paid for the\n\nomitted works done by them, Steven Soh said they had been but could not recall the amount.99 Steven Soh disagreed that unskilled labour could be employed for\n\nhacking works which would use air or electrical breakers. They would not know how deep\n\ninto the structure to hack and if they hacked too deep, that might cause problems to the\n\nstructure. He could not confirm whether all the defects indicated in the Defendants’\n\nexpert’s report had been rectified. Asked how the door frames could have been\n\ninstalled already if the clearance from the floor was insufficient, Steven Soh said they\n\neither had to cut the bottom of the doors or hack off the concrete floor underneath. Such\n\nrectification was still going on. They could not hack the floor before installing the door\n\nframes because inspection was going on for the more than 500 units which had three doors\n\neach and this could not be done in one day.100 The photos taken in September 1999 tendered by the Defendants were\n\nmerely to illustrate the kinds of defects at the carpark block. They did not show every\n\ndefect. The photos showed ponding or stagnant water problems because there was no gradient\n\nleading to the drainage points.101 Steven Soh maintained that the 1,600 bags of Smartscreed ordered by\n\nthe Defendants were used for the carpark block’s rectification works. Each bag of 25\n\nkg would cover one square metre at a minimum thickness of 20 mm. There were therefore some\n\n1,600 square metres of defects in the carpark block.102 In respect of the concrete wastage, Steven Soh agreed that concrete\n\nwould also be used for other works such as the plumbing and sanitary but a lower grade\n\nwould be used. Building structures would require a higher grade of concrete. The\n\nDefendants did not produce the invoices for supply of concrete from one of their two\n\nsuppliers. The invoices tendered in respect of the other supplier were not complete –\n\nthere should be more. There was also a third supplier at the latter part of the\n\nconstruction.103 Asked how the Defendants managed to differentiate the amounts of\n\nconcrete used by the Plaintiffs and by Kent Loong, Steven Soh referred to the remarks\n\ntyped in at the bottom of the invoices which indicated the block that each particular load\n\nwas meant for. A table comparing the actual quantity of concrete used with the measured\n\nquantity was relied upon by the Defendants to illustrate that there was wastage beyond the\n\nallowed 3% without attempting to quantify all the wastages (DB 441). The measured\n\nquantity, taking into account the 3% allowance, was taken from the drawings.104 The concrete which was sent to the site by the suppliers would be\n\nacknowledged by the Defendants’ foreman. The Defendants did the ordering of concrete\n\nbased on their estimated needs. The invoices of the suppliers were not given to the\n\nPlaintiffs and the Defendants did not inform the Plaintiffs if there was wastage. Steven\n\nSoh reiterated that it was the Plaintiffs’ responsibility under the subcontract to\n\ncheck on the amounts supplied.105 In re-examination, Steven Soh explained that the extra expenditure\n\npaid to other subcontractors was in respect of outstanding works and not the omitted\n\nworks. The Plaintiffs had a complete set of drawings from which they should be able to\n\ncalculate the quantity of concrete to be used.106 The only other witness for the Defendants was Paul Tan Keng Hoon, a\n\nQuantity Surveyor, engaged by the Defendants to inspect the site and to report on the\n\noutstanding works and the costs of completing such works and the defects and the costs of\n\nrectification thereof. He inspected the site on 6, 10 and 13 May 1999.107 Paul Tan estimated the costs of completing the outstanding works at\n\n$1,101,599.88 and the costs of rectification at $37,187.84 (revised during his testimony\n\nto $34,901.68 because of the calculation error pointed out earlier by the Plaintiffs’\n\nexpert witness). The outstanding works based on the contract, according to Paul Tan, were\n\nworth $645,363.20. Based on his evaluation and after adding approximately $285,000 for the\n\nshortfall of 3,932 certified mandays and another $1,619.20 for removal of debris, he\n\narrived at the said $1,101,599.88. The amount of costs for rectification included $5,000\n\nas \"Preliminary Costs (Provision to tools and equipment by main contractor)\".108 As the subcontract here was a lump sum one, and as a third party\n\nwas required to complete the works abandoned by the Plaintiffs, the rates should not be\n\nthe same as those in the original subcontract but should be based on a fair market value\n\n(i.e. rates used in HDB building projects and a commonly accepted 15% mark up for the\n\ncontractor’s establishment charges and profits). He therefore used the average hourly\n\nrate for skilled workers (carpenter, concretor and steel bender/fixer) plus 15% which\n\nworked out to $9.09 per hour. For unskilled labour and plasterer, he used an hourly rate\n\nof $5.06 and $10.47 respectively.109 For the defective works, the rectification of which involved mainly\n\nhacking off excess concrete, Paul Tan calculated the costs based on a gang of two men\n\nmultiplied by the aforesaid average skilled labour rate of $9.09 per hour.110 Paul Tan filed a second Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief in reply to\n\nthe Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of the Plaintiffs’ expert witness. His reply was\n\nset out in a letter dated 11 January 2000 to the Defendants’ solicitors as follows:\"1.PricingIn our professional point of view, the 15% markup for Contractor’s\n\n    establishment Charges, tools and equipment and Profit as stated in our report reference\n\n    PT/JW/6/99 dated 15.06.1999 is a necessity which is required to offset the administrations\n\n    costs incurred by the Main Contractor for the urgency of another sub-contractor to\n\n    complete the remaining works in such a short period.2.Omission According to ContractWe are aware that the sub-contract states that all variations shall be\n\n    based on the Standard Schedule of Rates less 10%. But in our professional point of view,\n\n    this method applies only to variation works and shall not applies to cases when another\n\n    sub-contractor is to be engaged to salvage and complete remaining works.3.Costing on the rectification of defective worksThe quantity were actually given in our report as inspected on site.\n\n    Sizes were not given in our report because bulging of concrete is always in irregular\n\n    shapes. The different rates applied reflect the difference in sizes of defects as\n\n    inspected on site.4.PhotographsWe wish to highlight that all defective works had been seen on the site\n\n    and shown in photographs and a copy of all photographs had been passed to the Main\n\n    Contractor.Lastly in our opinion, the method of assessment by the Plaintiff’s\n\n    expert is considered to be illogical without referring to actual site conditions of\n\n    defects and without giving establishment charges to the Main Contractor.\"111 In cross-examination, Paul Tan clarified that he was not at the\n\nsite for the entire three days of inspection. He was there with his staff and would leave\n\nif he had a meeting elsewhere to attend. He had however seen all the outstanding and the\n\ndefective works because photographs were taken on site. For the defects listed in his\n\nreport to which he ascribed the costs of rectification, he had looked at every individual\n\nitem on site. He bore the following factors in mind:(1) The nature of the defects – whether they were external and\n\n  therefore requiring the workers to be on the scaffolding, resulting in more time being\n\n  needed;(2) The size and regularity of the defects;(3) The thickness of the bulging concrete – if it was very thin,\n\n  the repairs would take less time.The rectification would include the patching up of the hacked surface.\n\nThe red lines marking the bulging concrete in the photographs were not placed by him but\n\nby the plastering subcontractors who found those marked areas unacceptable.112 Paul Tan explained that it was very easy to hack past the concrete\n\nto the steel reinforcement and that was why skilled labour was required. If the hacking\n\nwas not level, patch up work, not plastering, would be necessary. Unskilled labour could\n\nonly do hacking if the intention was to break up the whole thing and discard it, or if the\n\nthing to be hacked would not affect the structure or the aesthetics of the building.113 Asked whether Steven Soh briefed him on the subcontractor who was\n\nto take the Plaintiffs’ place, Paul Tan said he did not. His report was premised on\n\nthe open market tender basis. The outstanding works comprised not the standard repetitive\n\nfloors but things like the motor room, watertank, the apron works and the linkways.\n\nTherefore a new set of formwork was necessary. It was only for standard items that the\n\nStandard Rates minus 10% could be used. For such \"leftover\" items, one could not\n\nuse the rate per cubic metre to work out the costs. Paul Tan also explained that the 15%\n\nmark-up was not all profit. It included the work of four persons – the project\n\nmanager showing the works to all the tenderers, the Quantity Surveyor preparing a\n\ncontractual document, the secretarial staff typing out the contract and Steven Soh\n\nspending time negotiating with the tenderers.114 Paul Tan went on to say that he did not look at the claims of the\n\nPlaintiffs and what percentage of the work they claimed to have completed. He only looked\n\nat where the outstanding works were. He said he could have been misled by Steven Soh that\n\nthe Plaintiffs did not challenge the works allegedly not done.115 Asked whether there was a general drop in construction prices of\n\n20% in June 1999 when the outstanding works were supposed to have been carried out, Paul\n\nTan agreed that there was a drop in prices in June 1999 although he could not say by how\n\nmuch. In any event, he had to look at the contractual date between the parties and that\n\nwas 1998. He therefore based his assessment on the original contract.",
        "THE DECISION OF THE COURT": "116 I accepted the Plaintiffs’ evidence that there were changes to\n\nthe submission and payment dates in the course of the works culminating in the final\n\narrangement on 26 December 1998. I could not accept, however, the Plaintiffs’\n\ncontention that the deadline for submission therein was not a pre-condition to payment on\n\nthe immediate next payment date and that submission within a reasonable time before the\n\nnext payment date would suffice. It was meant to be a pre-condition but the course of\n\ndealings between the parties did show that the deadlines were not strictly enforced in\n\npractice and the Defendants could not insist now on strict compliance without first having\n\ngiven reasonable notice of their change in stance. That was why, when the 16thprogress claim was submitted formally on 26 March 1999 instead of 25 March 1999 and when\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ Thuan pressed for payment well before 17 April 1999, Steven Soh did\n\nnot retort by telling him that he was seeking payment prematurely. Instead, and I so\n\nfound, Steven Soh was trying to fend Thuan off with excuses such as the unavailability of\n\nhis brother to sign the payment cheque. The Defendants also failed to state their\n\npurported position when the first letter of demand dated 10 April 1999 was sent to them.\n\nThe Defendants ought to have paid up by 30 March 1999 but did not.117 In any event, the Defendants failed to make proper payment of the\n\n16thprogress claim by 17 April 1999. Steven Soh was disingenuous in making a\n\nhuge deduction in the claim unjustifiably and then trying to make it appear that the\n\nPlaintiffs had agreed to accept the much reduced amount as complete satisfaction of the\n\nclaim. I accepted Thuan’s evidence that the Plaintiffs were practically held to\n\nransom by Steven Soh’s promise upon promise which he obviously did not intend to or\n\ncould not fulfil.118 I did not think that the letter of acknowledgment dated 17 April\n\n1999 signed by Thuan extinguished the Plaintiffs’ 17thprogress claim at\n\nall. The progress claims were meant to be cumulative in nature subject to final\n\nadjustments. Steven Soh could not and did not claim to have made the final adjustments as\n\nat 17 April 1999. Indeed, he was to allege six days later that he had overpaid the\n\nPlaintiffs. Even if they did pay on the 16thprogress claim, what about the 17thprogress claim which was undeniably submitted on time? The Defendants’\n\nsolicitors’ letter dated 17 April 1999, while alleging that the Plaintiffs had\n\naccepted $128,230.88 as full and final payment of their 16thprogress claim\n\n(i.e. for work done as at 25 March 1999), did not allude to the 17thprogress\n\nclaim which became due the same day.119 I found the Defendants breached their payment obligations for both\n\nthe 16thand 17thprogress claims. They had also made late or only\n\npartial payments on the various earlier claims. I rejected Steven Soh’s evidence that\n\nthere were advance payments made to help out the Plaintiffs. They were nothing more than\n\nmoney which was due to the Plaintiffs. The payment vouchers that purported to show that\n\nthe payments were advances carried very little weight when the overall scheme of payments\n\nwas looked at.120 It was not disputed that the Defendants could hold a retention sum.\n\nThe Plaintiffs said it should not be more than 5% of the total contract sum (i.e. a\n\nmaximum of $205,500 based on the total contract sum of $4,110,000). The Plaintiffs had\n\nbeen protesting against a larger retention sum since early February 1999 but their\n\nprotests had fallen on deaf ears. It was still early in the contract and the Defendants\n\nhad no real grounds for projecting a breach of contract in respect of the required\n\nmandays. After all, the total number of mandays was supposed to be cumulative and was not\n\nreckoned on a month-by-month basis. The Plaintiffs had shown credibly that they could have\n\ncompleted all the contracted works by August 1999 or so and there was no good reason to\n\nassume that the 7,560 mandays would not be fulfilled. If the Defendants were seeking to\n\nimpose a deadline for the completion of the works different from that stated in the\n\nsubcontract, they had only themselves to blame for inserting 8 February 2000 as the\n\ncompletion date in their own document. If they had intended 8 February 2000 to apply to\n\nthe linkways only, why did they not say so? After all, they were quite careful to state a\n\ndifferent completion date (25 November 1999) when they took the carpark block out of Kent\n\nLoong’s scope and gave it to the Plaintiffs on 30 September 1998.121 Whatever the position might have been, it was clear by August 1999\n\nthat the requisite number of mandays had been complied with and there was no further\n\njustification, assuming there was previously, for holding any money in excess of the said\n\n5%. Yet the Defendants adamantly refused to change their blinkered outlook.122 The Plaintiffs submitted that they were entitled therefore to the\n\ninterest that would have accrued to them in respect of the excess retention sum as\n\ndamages. As this was not pleaded or alluded to during the trial, I did not allow the claim\n\nfor such interest.123 Where the omitted works were concerned, the Defendants appeared to\n\nme to be running inconsistent arguments. Steven Soh insisted that the Plaintiffs had\n\nagreed to the \"variations\", relying as proof thereof on the draft letter dated\n\n16 April 1999 which he acknowledged was never sent to the Plaintiffs due to the\n\nDefendants’ oversight and which emerged from the files of the Defendants only during\n\nthe trial. Leaving aside the sheer incredibility of this part of his evidence, if the\n\nparties had agreed as alleged, on what basis were the Defendants claiming damages from the\n\nPlaintiffs for having to engage other subcontractors to do the omitted works, assuming for\n\nthe moment that those other subcontractors extracted a higher contract price from the\n\nDefendants? By the same token, why did the Defendants not sue Kent Loong for the agreed\n\nvariations first for the three residential blocks and then for the carpark block? If their\n\nanswer was that they did not have to pay the Plaintiffs anything over and above what they\n\nhad contracted to pay Kent Loong for the same works, it would be interesting to know why\n\nthey alleged to the contrary when these omitted works were reverted to Kent Loong (and\n\nalso Goh Beng Huat, as claimed by Steven Soh in his oral testimony).124 It should also be noted that variations were permitted under the\n\nsubcontract only \"where there are variations issued by the client\" (HDB). That\n\nprovision could not possibly be stretched in meaning to encompass the juggling acts\n\nperformed by the Defendants between the Plaintiffs and Kent Loong. Clearly, the Defendants\n\nbreached the subcontract by wrongfully subtracting from the Plaintiffs’ scope of\n\nworks without their consent.125 The omitted works, as valued by the Defendants, were worth\n\n$323,600. I accepted Phua’s estimate of profits at 15% of the value of works.\n\nAlthough he did not factor in the employer’s CPF component for the salaries, which\n\nincidentally was reduced in April 1999, I was satisfied that the CPF element was\n\ncompensated for by his reduced claim of 15%. I also accepted that apart from the\n\noccasional hiccups, understandable in any construction project lasting more than half a\n\nyear, there was no delay on the part of the Plaintiffs in progressing with the works.126 By virtue of all the above, the Defendants had repudiated the\n\nsubcontract with the Plaintiffs. In particular, the Defendants’ conduct in the month\n\nof April 1999 was oppressive and appeared calculated to bring the subcontract to a\n\npremature end.127 The evidence pointed to the reality that works were still being\n\ndone by the Plaintiffs between 12 April until about 24 April 1999. The Plaintiffs’\n\nown subcontractors had submitted claims for this period. Steven Soh had agreed that there\n\nwas casting of the roof slab during this period. The Defendants’ records that there\n\nwere none of the Plaintiffs’ workers on site must therefore be wanting in accuracy. I\n\naccepted that the Plaintiffs were therefore entitled to the full value of works performed\n\nup to the roof level of all the blocks in question and to 20% of the value of the works\n\ndone for the motor rooms of Blocks 276 and 276B. The value of works done by the Plaintiffs\n\nup to the date they left the site would therefore be $3,805,960 (as shown in the annexures\n\nto Phua’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief at pages 91 and 92 of the Plaintiffs’\n\nBundle of Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief). Deducting from this the amount of $3,206,826.00\n\nalready paid to them and the 5% retention sum of $205,500 and adding thereto the 3% Goods\n\nand Services Tax of $11,809.02, the Plaintiffs were entitled to another $405,443.02. It\n\nfollowed from the above that there was no overpayment of $15,207.95 as alleged by the\n\nDefendants.128 I have already indicated that the Defendants were not entitled to\n\nremove the omitted works from the Plaintiffs’ scope and that if the parties did agree\n\nto the omission, there was no basis for the Defendants to make any claim for having to\n\nengage other subcontractors at an allegedly higher price. Assuming the Defendants had the\n\nright to make such a claim, they failed miserably to prove their allegations that they had\n\nto pay more to the substitute subcontractors. More than ten months after the tumultuous\n\nevents in April 1999, and the omitted works must have been completed some time ago since\n\nthe blocks were almost ready now to be handed over to HDB, Steven Soh still could not\n\nquantify what he had paid Kent Loong and Goh Beng Huat for those omitted works. It will be\n\nremembered that he managed to recall he had another subcontractor (Goh Beng Huat) only\n\nwhen he took the witness stand. He was also completely nebulous about what he had promised\n\nKent Loong for the omitted works. He appeared to be saying in Court that he would pay\n\nwhatever Kent Loong wanted if they did the works. There was no written agreement, or any\n\nagreement for that matter, on what was to be paid to the subcontractors who took over the\n\njob. It was completely ironical that in the year 2000, the Defendants were still relying\n\non Paul Tan’s projection of what the Defendants needed to pay other subcontractors to\n\ntake over the job when those subcontractors had already started work since April 1999,\n\neven before Paul Tan’s site inspections.129 The issue of defects had the same unsatisfactory features. Whatever\n\ndefects caused by the Plaintiffs would surely have been rectified by now, bearing in mind\n\nthe common ground of both parties that the other trades could not proceed with the\n\nsubsequent stages of construction until after the Plaintiffs had finished their work, the\n\nPlaintiffs stating of course that the other trades could move up the block after the\n\nPlaintiffs as each level was progressively completed. The Defendants must have the amounts\n\nexpended on rectification two months before handover to the HDB, especially when the\n\nexpert engaged by them had given them all the photographs and a complete list of alleged\n\ndefects by July 1999. Again, the evidence was not forthcoming. Despite Steven Soh’s\n\nclaim that 1,600 square metres of the carpark block were defective, he could only say that\n\nthe photographs adduced in Court were only illustrative of the defects and did not purport\n\nto show all of them.130 Accepting, like the Plaintiffs did, that no construction job could\n\nbe 100% perfect, I was prepared to make some deductions in favour of the Defendants. I\n\naccepted the Plaintiffs’ expert’s opinion that a gang of one skilled worker and\n\none unskilled labourer could do the hacking needed and accepted his and Phua’s\n\nestimates of what the rectification of the defects alleged by the Defendants would cost.\n\nThe total came up to slightly more than $22,000 but I rounded the figure up to $23,000.131 In respect of the alleged concrete wastage beyond the permitted\n\nlevel of 3%, the Defendants fell far short of proving that there was such wastage and that\n\nthe appropriate amounts were attributable to the Plaintiffs. Steven Soh appeared unsure on\n\nthe method of apportionment of the amount of concrete used by the subcontractors – it\n\nwas first apportioned according to contract value, then according to the number of blocks\n\nwithin their respective purview. In any event, Steven Soh could not even show the total\n\namount of concrete ordered by the Defendants for the site.THE ORDERS132 I therefore gave judgment for the Plaintiffs for:(1) $405,443.32 (being the value of work done and not paid for);(2) $48,540 (for loss of profits on the omitted works); and(3) $205,500 (being the 5% retention sum).The retention sum was ordered to be returned to the Plaintiffs on 24\n\nApril 2000, which would be one year after the repudiation was accepted by the Plaintiffs.\n\nIn the absence of an express term, the Defendants’ contention that it should be\n\nretained until after the expiry of the Defects Liability Period (of 12 months from the\n\nhandover to HDB) could not be correct. If the subcontract had been allowed to run its full\n\ncourse, the retention sum could rightly be withheld for 12 months after the completion of\n\nthe works under the subcontract. Since it was prematurely terminated, it was only logical\n\nthat the 12 months commenced from the date of termination.133 I gave judgment for the Defendants’ Counterclaim in respect of\n\nthe defects, the verification of which I quantified at $23,000. It followed that the rest\n\nof the Counterclaim was dismissed.134 Other than the retention sum, all the above sums would carry\n\ninterest at 6% per annum from the date of the writ of summons to the date of judgment.135 As the Plaintiffs had succeeded on practically all counts, I\n\nthought it just that the Defendants should pay the Plaintiffs 95% of the costs of the\n\nentire action, the deducted 5% being attributable to the limited success of the\n\nCounterclaim. There should be only one set of costs.TAY YONG KWANGJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
