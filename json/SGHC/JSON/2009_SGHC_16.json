        "The pleadings": "14  Shortly thereafter (on 28 May 2007), the plaintiff commenced this suit. In the (amended) statement of claim, the plaintiff relied on certain clauses in the sublease (see 1AB27-30) to say it had duly performed its obligations thereunder. It relied in particular on the renewal clause under cl 5(d) for its right to continue to occupy the sub-premises and alleged that the defendants had breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under cl 4(a) thereof when the plaintiff was told by Chou that it had to vacate the sub-premises by 21 December 2006. 15  The plaintiff claimed $605,068.39 against the defendants representing wasted expenditure, costs and expenses incurred as a result of the premature termination of the sublease, as well as a claim for refund of the security deposit for the sublease amounting to $12,000. In the alternative, the plaintiff claimed damages to be assessed. 16  Separate defences were filed by the two defendants who were also separately represented at the trial. In its defence and counterclaim, the first defendant denied that the plaintiff had properly exercised the option to renew clause. The first defendant alleged that the renewal notice was insufficient to constitute a valid notice to renew the sublease for a further period of one year as the parties had not agreed on the revised rental and the plaintiff had at no time indicated it was prepared to pay the maximum sum of $6,500 per month, as provided for under cl 4(a) of the sublease. The first defendant alleged that through its previous solicitors’ letters dated 29 January and 13 February 2007, the plaintiff had unequivocally withdrawn the renewal notice. 17  Consequently, the defendants’ purported breach of cl 4(a) of the sublease (which was denied) was no longer a live issue to be determined by the court and the first defendant put the plaintiff to strict proof it had breached the main agreement. 18  In the alternative, the first defendant contended that the defendants had validly exercised its right to renew the main agreement and the landlord’s notice of eviction was invalid. 19  The first defendant averred that the plaintiff continued to enjoy quiet possession of the sub-premises on the terms and conditions of the sublease until sometime in February 2007 when it chose of its own accord to vacate the sub-premises. Consequently, the defendants’ breach of the main agreement (which was not admitted) did not prevent the plaintiff from peaceably holding and enjoying the sub-premises for the whole of the original term under the sublease. The first defendant denied that its alleged breach of the main agreement caused the plaintiff’s alleged wasted expenditure and costs which would have to be incurred in any event when the plaintiff reinstated the sub-premises after expiry of the sublease. 20  In the alternative, the first defendant alleged that the plaintiff’s right to renew under cl 5(d) of the sublease was conditional upon the defendants validly renewing the main agreement with the landlord by exercising the defendants’ own right of renewal. If the defendants had not validly exercised that right, then the plaintiff was incapable of exercising its right of renewal either. Accordingly, the sublease expired on 31 December 2006 and the plaintiff continued thereafter to be a tenant of the defendants on a month to month basis from 1 January 2007 to 28 February 2007. The plaintiff had on 13 February 2007 through its former solicitors requested an extension of time until 10 March 2007 to remove its furniture and fittings from the sub-premises which it eventually removed between 28 February and 1 March 2007. 21  The first defendant contended that the plaintiff was not entitled to a refund of the security deposit of $12,000 as it failed to pay the rent arrears and utilities for the months of January and February 2007 and it caused damage upon dismantling of the fittings and fixtures at the sub-premises. 22  The first defendant counterclaimed rent of $12,000 and the costs of making good the damage caused by the plaintiff. 23  In his defence, the second defendant averred that he retired from the partnership of V4X on 29 March 2006. Consequently the second defendant was unaware and was not involved with V4X when the plaintiff exercised the option on 14 September 2006 to renew the sublease. He had no commercial dealings with the plaintiff and denied he had breached the main agreement and/or the sublease. The second defendant denied he was liable in law or in fact for the plaintiff’s alleged losses although he was aware that the plaintiff operated an entertainment establishment known as “The Roxy”. 24  In the reply and defence to the counterclaim, the plaintiff denied it had not agreed to the revised rent of $6,500. It relied on the defendants’ solicitors’ letter dated 12 February 2007 in this regard confirming the revised rent had been agreed. The plaintiff contended that its solicitors’ letters dated 29 January and 13 February 2007 had been taken out of context and it had not withdrawn the renewal notice.",
        "The evidence": "",
        "The issues": "60  The main issue for determination is did the renewal notice validly renew the sublease under cl 5(d) of the sublease?  If it did, the first defendant would be in breach of the failure to renew unless this court accepts its argument that it had no obligation to renew the sublease unless it was able to renew the main agreement. The other issue for determination is, would the second defendant still be liable to the plaintiff (if the first defendant was found to be liable) notwithstanding the fact he had withdrawn from the business of V4X on 29 March 2006?  A peripheral issue to be determined is, was the second defendant obliged to inform the plaintiff of his retirement from the partnership in order to escape liability should the court find in favour of the plaintiff?",
        "The decision": "",
        "The claim against the first defendant and the first defendant’s counterclaim": "61  On the evidence, I accept that the renewal notice set out in [29] was valid and effective. Although the first defendant’s’ two witnesses (Fabian and Ramu) sought to say otherwise, I dismiss their objections as frivolous and unmeritorious. The fact that the plaintiff did not specify that the renewal would be at a revised rent of $6,500 is not a valid ground to reject the renewal notice when the first defendant’s solicitors’ letter dated 12 February 2007 at [33] confirmed Seah’s testimony that $6,500 was the agreed rent. The other contention by the two witnesses that the renewal notice was not sent by registered mail to the first defendant is too frivolous to deserve any consideration. 62  As the renewal notice was valid, the first defendant on its part should have (which it did on 3 August 2006 at [48]) applied to the landlord to renew the main agreement. The landlord did not accede to the request for two reasons: (a) V4X was alleged to have breached the main agreement by converting its constitution from a partnership to that of a limited liability company (ie the Company) without notice to or prior approval from the landlord; and (b) it decided to sell the premises to the purchasers and the latter gave the landlord an incentive totalling $200,000 (see [37]) if the landlord could deliver vacant possession of the premises at the time of completion of the sale. 63  Counsel for the plaintiff had objected (N/E 52 on 21 July 2008) as speculative the question put by counsel for the first defendant to Seah, that Chou was motivated by greed when the landlord wanted to evict the defendants from the premises. Although Chou did not testify, there is little doubt in my mind that the landlord’s move to evict V4X from the premises (using (a) above as the reason) was primarily if not solely motivated by the incentive of an extra $200,000 from the purchasers in return for vacant possession at the time of completion. 64  It cannot be a coincidence that the plaintiff was purportedly told to vacate the premises on the completion date of the sale to the purchasers (viz21 December 2006). Further, in the letter from the landlord’s solicitors dated 15 December 2006 (at 2AB158) to the Company demanding vacant possession of the premises, the landlord requested the Company to sign a settlement deed and return the document by close of business that same day. The landlord had offered the Company a sum of $10,000 “purely on a goodwill basis and with no admission as to liability” (see cll 2 and 3 of the settlement deed in exhibit BFP-7 of Fabian’s AEIC) in exchange for vacant possession of the premises by 5pm of 19 December 2006. 66  The question this court has to determine is, did V4X breach the main agreement by having the Company take over the premises as the tenant?  In this regard it is necessary to look at cl 2 of the main agreement; it states: The tenant hereby covenants with the landlords: (q)  not to assign, sublet or part with the possession of the demised  premises or any part thereof to any third party without the written consent of the landlords, such consent not to be vexatiously withheld. 67  It is noted that neither V4X nor the Company produced (as the plaintiff demanded) evidence of renewal of the main agreement by the landlord. By the same token, neither did the plaintiff produce any evidence of a notice to quit to V4X from the landlord. However, in the light of the letter dated 15 December 2006 in [64] from the landlord’s solicitors to the Company and Fabian’s admission in [47], the fact that a notice to quit had been issued by the landlord to V4X cannot be disputed. 68  It is however noteworthy that there was no evidence before the court (apart from Seah’s bare allegation which was not substantiated in the absence of Chou as a witness) that the landlord had given the plaintiff notice to quit the sub-premises. There was also no evidence before the court that the landlord had notified the plaintiff or V4X that there had been a breach of the main agreement by V4X. As the first defendant rightly submitted, the plaintiff through Seah wanted V4X to prove a negative – that it hadnotbreached the main agreement when the burden at law was on the plaintiff to prove (which it could not/did not) that there was indeed such a breach. 69  Lay persons do not normally appreciate the legal niceties at law between unincorporated bodies and corporate entities. While the partnership/the sole-proprietorship of V4X may share the same name as the Company, the constitution of the former was vastly different from the latter. Consequently, the landlord was entitled at law to take the stand if it did (even if it was technical and/or unmeritorious) that when V4X was deregistered on 30 September 2006, the tenancy under the main agreement terminated without more. In the light of cl 2(q) of the main agreement set out in [66], it was not possible for the Company to have succeeded V4X as the tenant without the landlord’s prior consent and without a formal assignment. 70  Consequently, V4X was in no position after 30 September 2006 to offer a renewal of the sublease to the plaintiff. That did not mean as the first defendant’s witnesses sought to argue, that the inability of V4X to renew the main agreement under cl 4(d) of the main agreement meant that it was not liable to the plaintiff for the failure to renew the sublease. Common sense if not the law dictates that if the  inability of V4X to renew the sublease was due to its breach of the main agreement, it would be liable to the plaintiff if the plaintiff had given a valid notice of renewal (which I have held in [61] it did). I accept the plaintiff’s closing submission that the defendants cannot take advantage of their own wrong to avoid their legal obligations to the plaintiff (seeAlghussein Establishment And Eton College[1988] 1 WLR 587 followed inEvergreat Construction Co Pte Ltd v Presscrete Engineering Pte Ltd[2006] 1 SLR 634at [51] and see alsoChitty on Contractsvol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 30thEd, 2008 at para 1-031 p 27). 71  I turn next to the first defendant’s secondary defence on the renewal notice – that it was not valid because the increased rent of $6,500 had not been agreed. The short answer to this argument is that the first defendant cannot maintain this defence in the light of the Company’s solicitors’ letter dated 12 February 2007 which relevant text set out in [33], clearly stated that the plaintiff had agreed to the revised rent of $6,500. 72  Another peripheral defence raised by the defendants was that the Company’s solicitors’ reference in the same letter (at [33]) to ‘previous rate’ on the rent meant $6,000 and not $6,500. I reject this argument as in the context of the paragraph, the sentence We are instructed by our clients that they are not prepared to maintain the rental amount at the previous rate as the new landlords have imposed a higher rental in respect of the main tenancy. can only mean $6,500 was the previous rate not $6,000. 73  Another related and more crucial issue the court has to determine is, was the renewal notice withdrawn by the plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter dated 29 January 2007 (at [31]) as the first defendant pleaded in its defence?  In its closing submissions (paras 68-70), the plaintiff argued that a plain reading of the said letter and its context made it clear that the plaintiff did not withdraw the renewal notice. The plaintiff relied on the testimony and concessions made by Fabian and Ramu in that regard. 74  I reject the plaintiff’s submissions. With respect, it is for the court not witnesses of fact, to interpret para 9 of the letter dated 29 January 2007 written not by a layperson but by the plaintiff’s solicitors. The entire paragraph is reproduced below: 9   In respect of the above Sub-Tenancy Agreement and in view of the matters stated above, we are instructed by our clients to inform Messrs RS and PHPL and/or yourselves (subject to you being able to properly justify yourselves as the new Main Tenant of the premises) that our clients no longer wish to lease the said premises which is referred to in the above Sub-Tenancy Agreement. Any previous renewals sent by our clients to Messrs RS and/or PHPL is hereby withdrawn. In this connection, we are further instructed to request and/or demand for the following:- (a)  The immediate return of our clients’ deposit in the sum of S$12,000 which we understand is now held by you in trust for our clients. (b)  That you allow our clients a reasonable period (ie 30 days) for our clients to remove all renovations that they have done onto the said premises and/or remove all furniture and added fixtures. Alternatively, should you wish for our clients not to remove the said renovations and/or furniture and/or fixtures, we are instructed to propose that our clients are prepared to sell the same to you for a reduced sum of S$400,000.00 [our clients had spent S$600,000.00 on renovations/furniture/fixtures]. The above letter was headed “SUB-TENANCY AGREEMENT DATED 27 SEPTEMBER 2005 (‘The SUB-TENANCY AGREEMENT”). 75  Read with the heading, what could be clearer than the unequivocal language used in the second last sentence of para 9 as italicised?  The renewal notice dated 14 September 2006 was indeed addressed to the second and first defendants (referred to as RS and PHPL respectively in the letter). No other renewal notice was ever sent by the plaintiff to the defendants that could have been the subject of withdrawal in para 9. Any doubts that the plaintiff did not intend by para 9 above to renew the sublease were removed by the plaintiff’s solicitors’ subsequent letter dated 13 February 2007 (see [32]) where it was stated: Our clients do not wish to renew the Tenancy of the premises 76  In addition, why would the plaintiff give notice of its intention to vacate the premises if it did not intend to withdraw the renewal notice, even if its demand for refund of the rental deposit can be explained on the basis it had no contractual relationship with the Company?  It bears repeating that the plaintiff did not produce any independent evidence to support Seah’s claim that Chou/the landlord gave the plaintiff notice to quit the sub-premises. Chou did not testify and the plaintiff offered no explanation why he was not called as a witness. 77  Consequently, the renewal notice having been withdrawn by its solicitors, the plaintiff cannot maintain its claim for breach of the sublease by the defendants’ failure to renew the same. The plaintiff occupied the sub-premises on a month-to-month tenancy after expiry of the sublease on 31 December 2006. The plaintiff’s claim that it did not have quiet enjoyment of the sub-premises is frivolous and unfounded as were Seah’s allegations of other breaches of the sublease set out in [35] above. So long as the plaintiff occupied the sub-premises, rent was payable. The question is to who?  It could not be to the defendants as V4X ceased to exist as of 30 September 2006. The rent if at all payable was due to the Company. Consequently, the first defendant’s counterclaim for arrears of rent is unsustainable. This was conceded by the first defendant’s witness Fabian and the counterclaim was subsequently withdrawn by its counsel (see [55]). 78  In the light of my finding that the plaintiff withdrew its renewal notice, it must follow that it moved out voluntarily from the sub-premises on or about 28 February 2007. 79  The first defendant’s closing submission highlighted the fact that the plaintiff’s demand for refund of the deposit by its solicitors’ letters dated 29 January 2007 and 13 February 2007 were addressed to the Company and not to V4X. Hence, the first defendant submitted, the plaintiff were aware that the deposit had been transferred to the Company from the first defendant and the plaintiff should pursue its claim against the Company subject to the Company’s right of setoff for arrears of rent. In this connection, Seah had not denied that he had signed cheques on the plaintiff’s behalf in favour of the Company in payment of rent (see [36]) although his excuse was he did not pay attention to such matters which were left to the plaintiff’s accountant. Even so, I cannot overlook the fact that the plaintiff’s solicitors made a demand not of V4X but of the Company for the return of the deposit. Having paid rent in October 2006 to the Company (for whatever the reason), then disputing the quantum of rent payable to the Company for January and February 2007 and subsequently demanding refund of the deposit from the Company, the plaintiff cannot blow hot and cold at the same time. It had implicitly accepted the Company as its landlord and should not be allowed to claim the deposit from the defendants who said the deposit had been transferred to the Company. 80  Consequently, the plaintiff’s claim against the first defendant like the first defendant’s counterclaim has no merit and is dismissed.",
        "The claim against the second defendant": "81  It is clear on the evidence that the second defendant could not have been liable to the plaintiff on its claim in any event as he was no longer a partner of V4X after 29 March 2006. It was also in evidence from the plaintiff’s witnesses that they did not see the second defendant at the premises after May 2006. It should be noted (as was submitted by the second defendant) that as of May 2006, there was no breach of the sublease by the defendants. Similarly, there was no breach of the sublease when the business of V4X was terminated on 30 September 2006. 82  The plaintiff sought to argue in its closing submissions that it was unaware of the second defendant’s withdrawal from the partnership. That submission cannot stand in the light of the evidence adduced from Seah and Ho. They admitted they had not seen the second defendant on the premises after May 2006. Thenceforth, they dealt only with Fabian and Ramu. Moreover, it is more likely than not that when Ramu was introduced to Seah by Fabian, Seah would have been told that Ramu had bought out the second defendant’s shares in V4X. The change in the partnership and subsequent sole-proprietorship was reflected in the records filed with ACRA while the change in the constitution of V4X to a limited company was notified to the plaintiff on or about 28 September 2006. What the plaintiff should have done but failed to do, was to conduct a search in ACRA and it could have ascertained therefrom whether the second defendant was still a partner in V4X at the time of the alleged breach of the sublease (September 2006) and at the time of commencement of these proceedings. 83  On the evidence and contrary to Seah’s denial, I find on a balance of probabilities that the plaintiff was told of the second defendant’s withdrawal from V4X when Ramu was introduced to the plaintiff. If the second defendant remained a partner as Seah claimed he thought, why did the plaintiff deal with Ramu thenceforth and not with the second defendant?  Should Seah not have questioned Ramu’s status?  The fact that Seah did not can only mean that he knew Ramu had taken over from and stepped into the shoes of the second defendant. Moreover, even one of the purchasers (Lim) had requested Seah to refer to Ramu [38] on the issue of the defendants’ tenancy. Why would Lim do that unless Ramu was either a partner or the sole-proprietor of V4X? 84  As the second defendant rightly submitted, s 36(1) of the Partnership Act Cap 391 1994 Rev Ed (“the Act”) merely states that where a person deals with a firm after a change in its constitution, he is entitled to treat all apparent members of the old firm as still being members of the firm until he has notice of the change. The manner of notification was not spelt out in the Act. Here, there was oral notification of the change in the business of V4X by the first defendant’s representative Fabian to Seah. 85  Consequently, the plaintiff’s claim against the second defendant is also dismissed. As I understand from the plaintiff’s solicitors that it had made Offers To Settle to the defendants pursuant to O 22A of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5 2006 Rev Ed), I will hear parties on the issue of costs on another day."
