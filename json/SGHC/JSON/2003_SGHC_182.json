        "Appeal against conviction": "13        The main thrust of the appellant’s appeal was that the learned district judge had erred in preferring the prosecution’s version of events over his own. 14        It is trite law that an appellate court, which does not have the advantage of hearing the witnesses and observing their demeanour, will not disturb a lower court’s findings of fact unless they are plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence.  InTuen Huan Rui Mary v PP[2003] SGHC 157, I repeated the observations I had made earlier inPP v Azman bin Abdullah[1998] 2 SLR 704 at p 710: It is well-settled law that in any appeal against a finding of fact, an appellate court will generally defer to the conclusion of the district judge who has had the opportunity to see and assess the credibility of the witnesses.  An appellate court, if it wishes to reverse the district judge’s decision, must not merely entertain doubts about whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong.  15        The appellant highlighted three main weaknesses in the prosecution’s case: (a) the lapse of 22 months between the incident and the police report; (b) Stanley’s lack of credibility as a witness; and (c) certain inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses. I shall now deal with each of these arguments in turn. Lapse of 22 months 16        The district judge accepted that the lapse of 22 months was excessive.  She rejected the prosecution witnesses’ evidence that the delay was due to the fact that Goh only came to know about the events in March or April 2002.  Goh had become a director of Seven Entertainment on 15 March 2001, and another Club 7 employee Irwan bin Ismail and Ng himself had both testified that Goh was always actively involved in the running of Club 7.  Therefore, there was no reason for him to recheck the accounts for the year of 2000 in January 2002.  Given the circumstances, I found that the district judge was justified in finding that the police report was lodged at the instigation of Ng, as a direct response to the appellant’s threats to expose Ng to the CPIB.  While this meant that the testimonies of those involved in the CPIB case should be treated with caution, it did not mean that their evidence had no probative force at all.  In any case, the prosecution’s case was supported by the evidence of Stanley, who was a credible and independent witness. Stanley's lack of credibility 17        The appellant’s attempts to undermine the credibility of Stanley consisted of nothing more than bare allegations.  The appellant alleged that Stanley had attended several Club 7 functions as Ng’s guest.  However, he could not provide any evidence of such alleged connections between Stanley and Ng, and also admitted that he had no personal knowledge that Ng and Stanley had unofficial dealings.  Before me, the appellant also alleged that Stanley may have been bribed by Ng.  However, this new allegation was again completely unsubstantiated.  Given the complete lack of basis for the appellant’s wild allegations against Stanley, I found that the district judge was justified in finding Stanley to be a credible witness. Inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses 18        Also, while there were minor inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, these were not fatal to the prosecution’s case.  Bearing in mind that almost two years have passed since the events occurred, it is understandable that the parties involved may not remember every single detail perfectly:PP v Gan Lim Soon[1993] 3 SLR 261;Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP[1997] 3 SLR 464; andHon Chi Wan Colman v PP[2002] 3 SLR 558.Moreover, the points of divergence were irrelevant to the material elements of the charge, which was that the appellant had dishonestly converted the $7,000 which he was given to pay the security deposit for Seven Entertainment’s cess application.  It was beside the point that Christine could not remember how and when she first received the letter from IRAS that stated that the security deposit was payable.  The appellant placed great emphasis on how Christine and Ng found out about the non-payment of the deposit, when this was really of no consequence to the prosecution’s case.  Whether Stanley called Christine or Christine called Stanley certainly did not give credence to his allegations of a conspiracy to frame him. 19        The appellant submitted that the district judge had “erred in law” by giving the prosecution witnesses the benefit of the doubt when the burden of proof was clearly on the prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  This argument is clearly without merit.  The district judge was aware at all times of the burden and standard of proof required for a finding of guilt on a criminal charge.  The existence of minor inconsistencies in the evidence of some of the prosecution’s witnesses did not inexorably lead to the creation of reasonable doubt. The district judge was also perfectly entitled to disregard the discrepancies pointed out by the appellant for they were minor inconsistencies that did not detract from the value of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses:Chean Siong Guat v PP[1969] 2 MLJ 63;PP v Kalpanath Singh[1995] 3 SLR 564; andSundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP[1997] 3 SLR 464.  In any case, the court is entitled, for good and cogent reasons, to accept one part of the testimony of a witness and to reject the other:PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2)[1977] 1 MLJ 15;Ng Kwee Leong v PP[1998] 3 SLR 942; andHon Chi Wan Colman v PP[2002] 3 SLR 558. 20        After carefully reviewing the Record of Proceedings, I found that the district judge’s findings of fact were amply supported by the evidence.  The version of events presented by the prosecution’s witnesses was cogent and consistent in the material aspects of the prosecution’s case.  Stanley’s testimony of the appellant’s suspicious behaviour at IRAS on 5 December 2000 was especially important, given that he was an independent witness with no motive to embellish his evidence. 21        In contrast, I found the appellant’s evidence completely unpersuasive.  His insistence that Ng was an illegal moneylender did not aid him in proving that the $7,000 in this case was a loan. His story that Ng had agreed to loan him $5,000, then later refused to accept the excess $2,000 which the appellant claimed he offered to return, was simply implausible.  At the end of the day, all the appellant could do was make completely baseless allegations against all the prosecution witnesses in a vain attempt to support his conspiracy theory.  Besides his attempts to attack Stanley’s credibility, he also claimed that the charge was originally framed under s 409 because Ng had connections with the police and had consulted a police officer in order to “secure the highest charge”.  This was, like most of his other allegations, not supported by a shred of evidence. 22        The appellant’s vague and contradictory evidence in the district court surrounding the repayment of the alleged loan only served to further undermine his version of events.  He initially claimed to have repaid the sum between December 2000 and January 2001, then later changed his mind and said he was unable to say exactly when he had repaid the loan.  His claim that he did not know how much he had paid Ng in total, and that he had only paid whatever Ng had asked for, was simply incredible.  The appellant was obviously astute, and given that he was “financially weak”, would surely not have been so careless with any money he had. 23        Therefore, I found that the appellant was rightly convicted.",
        "Appeal against sentence": "24        For a s 408 offence, the maximum term of imprisonment is seven years.  The district judge considered the case ofSim Yeow Seng v PP[1995] 3 SLR 44, where the accused, who had an antecedent for criminal breach of trust with another charge of cheating taken into consideration, pleaded guilty to a s 408 charge involving $7,777.27 and was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment.  After taking into account the appellant’s more serious antecedents, his lack of remorse, the absence of any real mitigating factors and the manner in which he committed the offence, she sentenced him to 20 months’ imprisonment. 25        I could not agree with this aspect of the trial judge’s decision.  It is true that in cases involving criminal breach of trust, the value of the property misappropriated is a relevant consideration:Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP[1990] SLR 1011.  However, the court’s sentencing discretion is never restricted by the amount involved:Amir Hamzah bin Berang Kuty v PP[2003] 1 SLR 617.  While past cases are no doubt helpful guidelines, care must be taken to avoid sacrificing justice at the altar of blind consistency.  Each case which comes before the courts must be looked at on its own facts, each particular accused in his own circumstances:Soong Hee Sin v PP[2001] 2 SLR 253. 26        I noted that this particular case is striking for its lack of any mitigating circumstances whatsoever.  The appellant does not have the benefit of a guilty plea.  He has shown no remorse nor made any restitution.  His claim that he is the sole breadwinner who needs to take care of his ill and aged parents cannot hold much weight, for it is settled law that any hardship caused to the offender’s family as a result of the imprisonment of the offender has little mitigating value save in very exceptional or extreme circumstances:Ng Chiew Kiat v PP[2000] 1 SLR 370.  This is an unavoidable consequence occasioned by the offender’s own criminal conduct and should not affect what would otherwise be the proper sentence:Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP[1993] 3 SLR 305;PP v Tan Fook Sum[1999] 2 SLR 523;PP v Yap Koon Mong[1999] 4 SLR 257.  The appellant has failed to point to any exceptional circumstances in this case to warrant a departure from this established principle. 27        In contrast, the list of aggravating factors here clearly justifies the imposition of a long deterrent sentence.  The appellant has a long list of antecedents, most of which involve dishonesty.  In March 1995, he was convicted of three charges of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code, with six similar charges taken into consideration.  In December 1995, he was convicted of giving false information under s 26(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).  In May 2003, he was convicted of forgery for the purpose of cheating under s 468 of the Penal Code (although he is appealing against this conviction).  He also had other prior convictions for careless driving and for providing public entertainment without a licence. 28        Besides his poor record, the circumstances of the present charge also show the appellant to be a shrewd and scheming rogue.  He attempted to cover up the misappropriation of the money with a series of lies and deceptions.  Even when discovered, he continued to concoct ever more elaborate stories designed to cover his tracks and cast the blame on others.  Not only has he shown no remorse for his actions, he has also continued to make baseless allegations against all the prosecution witnesses, most notably against Stanley, who clearly has no personal interest in the case. 29        Taking into account all the aggravating factors, and the appellant’s long list of antecedents, I was of the view that the sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment was not only not manifestly excessive, but was instead manifestly inadequate. Conclusion 30        For the reasons above, I dismissed the appeals against conviction and sentence, and enhanced the appellant’s sentence to 36 months’ imprisonment, to commence upon the expiry of the present sentence he is serving. Appeals against conviction and sentence dismissed; sentence enhanced to 36 months’ imprisonment, to commence upon expiry of the present sentence the appellant is serving."
