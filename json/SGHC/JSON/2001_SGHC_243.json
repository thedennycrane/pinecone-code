This\n\nwas paid ‘early’ but only because AL had re-submitted an amended claim after 25\n\nMay 1999. Wei Sin took advantage of this and treated it as having been made for June 1999\n\nwhereupon the due date for payment became 25 July 1999 instead.56.        It can also be seen that Progress Claims\n\nNo 3, 4A and 5A under N2 and Progress Claim No 4 and 5A under N6 were not paid at all. In\n\nfairness, I should mention that as at the date of purported termination i.e 10 September\n\n1999, only Progress Claim No 3 for N2 and No 4 for N6 were due for payment. However, even\n\nthough the others were not due for payment yet, they subsequently became due but were not\n\npaid.57.        As regards Progress Claim No 5A, Mr\n\nShetty said that his instructions were that Wei Sin did not receive it for each of the\n\nsub-contracts until after the action was commenced (para 5 of the Defence and Counterclaim\n\nrefers wrongly to Progress Claim No 5). However, he did not question PW1 Mr Sim about No\n\n5A. While DW2 Mr Soh had alleged in his AEIC that the last progress claims dated 30 August\n\n1999 (i.e No 5A) for each of the sub-contracts was not even forwarded to Wei Sin prior to\n\nthe action, he did not elaborate as to when they were received.58.        Besides, in evidence, Wei Sin did not\n\ndispute receiving Progress Claim No 5 for each of the sub-contracts. Each of the Progress\n\nClaims No 5A is not significantly different from No 5 in dollar value.59.        Furthermore, I note that when B T Tan\n\n& Co sent its fax demand dated 4 September 1999, it referred to five progress claims\n\nfor each sub-contract, the last ones being numbered ‘5’ in its letter. The error\n\nis repeated in the Statement of Claim. However, from the date and the amount of each of\n\nthe fifth claims, it seems to me that B T Tan & Co’s reference for that claim\n\nshould actually be to 5A and not 5.60.        Also, when HEP replied, HEP did not\n\ndispute that Wei Sin had received five progress claims from AL for each sub-contract.\n\nNeither did HEP say that the amounts claimed were incorrectly stated by B T Tan & Co.61.        As for the differences between AL’s\n\nprogress claims and the payments by Wei Sin, the differences were larger for N2.Did Wei Sin agree on 11 August 1999 to make some payment to ALfor\n\nN2? If so, why was the payment withheld?62.        As can be seen from the above tabulation\n\nat para 54, as at 11 August 1999, Wei Sin had paid AL less than half of what AL had\n\nclaimed for N2. I also stress that although Wei Sin had made three payments for N2, there\n\nwas no payment in respect of Progress Claim No 3 contrary to the assertion in para 142 of\n\nMr Shetty’s Closing Submission. Although AL’s statement of account (at BAEIC 49)\n\nand PW1 Mr Sim had assumed that the third payment from Wei Sin was for Progress Claim No\n\n3, the fact of the matter is that the third payment was in respect of Progress Claim No 2\n\nas was the second payment. This is evident from the documentary evidence i.e Progress\n\nPayment No 2 (at BAEIC 156) which was confirmed by DW2 Mr Soh during cross-examination\n\n(see NE 163 line 14 to NE 164 line 11). That is why I grouped the second and third\n\npayments as payments for Progress Claim No 2 in the tabulation for N2 at para 54 above.63.        On 11 August 1999, there was a meeting\n\nbetween PW1 Mr Sim, representing AL and Lawrence Soh (the CEO of Wei Sin), Steven Soh,\n\nMark Koh and one Ms L F Yip representing Wei Sin. I was informed that DW2 is also known as\n\nSteven Soh.64.        Mr Sim alleged that at this meeting,\n\nLawrence Soh had agreed to pay AL $90,000 for Progress Claim No 3 within the next one or\n\ntwo days. However when AL did not receive such payment, he contacted Mr Soh’s office\n\nand spoke to Ms Yip who informed him that the figure would be $70,000. The $70,000 would\n\nbe paid between 16 to 25 August 1999.65.        According to DW2 Mr Soh, Wei Sin did not\n\nagree to pay AL $90,000 but only $70,000 and this payment would be made between 16 and 25\n\nAugust 1999. However, he also said that Wei Sin did not pay the $90,000 (which had been\n\nrecommended by the QS for N2 Progress Claim No 3, see para 41 above) because Wei Sin\n\nwanted to make provision for liquidated damages for AL’s delay in N2.66.        In the context of Progress Claim No 4, he\n\ngave additional reasons. He said that Wei Sin had to take into account the additional\n\ncosts of rectifying defects and completing outstanding work, if AL did not do these works\n\n(NE 155 line 12 to 157 line 23). Progress Payment No 4A was not due for payment until 25\n\nSeptember 1999 (NE 158 line 5 to line 16).67.        The faxes on the subject are stated\n\nbelow.68.        On 12 August 1999, Wei Sin sent a fax to\n\nAL’s Mr Sim (AB 172) stating:‘Jurong West N2C6We refer to the meeting between your goodself, our Mr Lawrence Soh,\n\n    Steven Soh, Mark Koh and the undersigned on 11 August 1999.We would like to place on record that we had clarified to you on the\n\n    following matters:-1.    There is no outstanding amount due to you for\n\n    Jurong West N6C28.2.    As for Jurong West N2C6, the outstanding amount\n\n    due to you (for work done in June ’99 which is due in end July ’99) is S$90,000\n\n    instead of a few hundred thousands as alleged by your goodself.3.    We will inform you on the dates where you could\n\n    expect the payment of S$90,000.Thanks & regards.’69.        On 15 August 1999, Wei Sin sent a fax to\n\nAL’s Mr Sim (AB 173) stating:‘Jurong West N6C28I would like to highlight to you that the following issues:-1.Blk 656DI am surprise to see that till today, there is not much progress\n\n    for the balcony railing and cloth drying racks which has jammed up the progress of\n\n    plastering work. ….2.Blk 656A[which should\n\n    read 657A]Please note that the plastering work will commence on 16 August 1999\n\n    and there will be about 60 plasterers carrying out the work. With your progress for Blk\n\n    656D, I foresee the same thing like Blk 656D will happen to this block unless extra effort\n\n    are put in by your company.I was informed that you are chasing my office everyday for the payment\n\n    after since the meeting on 11 August 1999 and I understand my office had committed a\n\n    schedule to you. With this, I hope you could spend more time on site to supervise the work\n\n    since you are more familiar with the site progress. It will then be beneficial to both\n\n    parties when your progress of work are back to track.I reiterate that I want to see all your necessary works to be completed\n\n    in order not to cause any delays to other trades before we talk about the next payment.Your immediate action will be necessary.Thanks & regards.Lawrence Soh’70.        On 16 August 1999, AL’s Mr Sim sent\n\na fax to Wei Sin’s Lawrence Soh (AB 175) stating:‘1. ….2. ….3. ….4.         As agreed on meeting\n\n    11thAug 99 on the following:a)     Progressive payment for 24thJun\n\n      99 shall be S$90,000.00 instead of S$70,000.00b)     You promised to inform us in one to two day\n\n      time, I was informed on third day and we supposed to get payment between 16thAug 99 to not later by 25thAug 99 and it S$70,000.00 (Ms Yip informed)c)     As our contract have indicated clearly that\n\n      we supposed to get progressive payment for every month for the two sitesd)     With the above progressive payment it will\n\n      relay (sic) our payment by another two or three week (submission end of every month\n\n      & payment immediate end the month)e)     The relay (sic) progressive payment\n\n      caused us the overhead of our company, such as paying salaries to employee, purchasing of\n\n      materials & consumable itemsf)     We hopefully that we would very much\n\n      continue to work with your company and complete all the work in timeg)     We hope you will expedite on our progressive\n\n      payment in time as we require to pay our salaries, suppliers and to purchase other\n\n      materials for other fabrication works (Sun breaker, Sun Lourve, Car-park Mesh, Parapet\n\n      materials)’71.        On the same day, Wei Sin replied (BAEIC\n\n331):‘JURONG WEST N6C28 AND N2C6METAL WORK SUB-CONTRACTWe refer to your fax F001-0899WSN6C28 dated 16 Aug 99.We like to clarify that in the meeting we have never promise you a\n\n    payment of $90,000.00. We only agreed to inform you on the payment as soon as possible. We\n\n    stress again your workmanship for the two projects is not acceptable and we have to retain\n\n    monies for future rectification work. Your work is also way behind sites work schedules\n\n    despite of reminders.….….WE ARE VERY CONCERN ON THE STATUES (sic) OF THE\n\n    SUNBREAKER AND SUN-LOUVRES. YOU ARE TO WRITE TO US BY TOMORROW ON YOUR DECISION AND YOUR\n\n    PROPOSAL TO CATCH UP ON THE DELAY CAUSED.WE MAY, OUT OF NO CHOICE BUT TO RESORT TO OTHER\n\n    ALTERNATIVES TO MITIGATE THE DELAY CAUSED TO OUR PROJECTS.’72.        Then on 18 August 1999, Wei Sin sent a\n\nfax to AL’s Mr Sim (BAEIC 335 to 336). It complained about slow progress of works for\n\nN2 and for N6. The penultimate paragraph states:‘As our projects are been delayed by you (and may suffer\n\n    liquidated damages as a result) and the higher cost of completing your outstanding work,\n\n    the outstanding payment of $90,000.00 will be withhold until the project is\n\n    completed.’73.        Having considered the oral and the\n\ndocumentary evidence, I find that Wei Sin did agree on 11 August 1999 to pay AL $90,000\n\nand AL was to be informed in one or two days as to when it could collect payment.74.        This was not a situation where Wei Sin\n\nwould inform AL within one or two days as to how much Wei Sin would pay as was suggested\n\nby Mr Shetty during cross-examination of Mr Sim.75.        Wei Sin then changed its mind and on or\n\nabout 14 August 1999, informed AL that it would pay $70,000, instead of $90,000, and this\n\nwould be paid between 16 and 25 August 1999.76.        Wei Sin then changed its mind again and\n\ndecided to withhold payment even of the $70,000 primarily because of its concern about the\n\nslow progress of work by AL.77.        However, Wei Sin did not adduce any\n\nevidence as to just how much AL’s works in N2 had delayed the main contract works as\n\nat 18 August 1999, or even thereafter up to 10 September 1999 (which is the date of\n\ntermination of the sub-contracts).78.        Neither did it adduce any evidence as to\n\nits own assessmentat the material timeof the costs of rectifying defects for N2.79.        It is clear to me that, again, Wei Sin\n\nhad acted in an arbitrary manner in withholding payment for N2 Progress Claim No 3 which\n\nwas already due to be paid by 25 July 1999.80.        I would add that the agreement on 11\n\nAugust 1999 and Wei Sin’s failure to pay the $90,000, or even the $70,000, might have\n\nprovided AL with a separate defence to any allegation of slow progress of work or of\n\nfailure to rectify defective work for N2 subsequent to 11 August 1999. However, as this\n\nwas not pleaded as a separate defence, I need not say anything more about it.81.        I have already mentioned, in the earlier\n\npart of my judgment, the fax demand sent by AL’s solicitors B T Tan & Co dated 4\n\nSeptember 1999, the purported termination of the sub-contracts for N2 and N6 by Wei\n\nSin’s solicitors HEP on 10 September 1999 and the purported termination of the\n\nsub-contracts for N2 and N6 by B T Tan & Co on 10 September 1999 (see paras 8, 9 and\n\n10 above).82.        I will elaborate on the fax demand and\n\neach of the purported notices of termination later. Suffice it to say for now, that, by 10\n\nSeptember 1999, the sub-contracts for N2 and N6 were terminated.The amount to be paid to AL for N2 and N683.        Leaving aside the counter-claims of Wei\n\nSin for the time being, it was clear that AL was entitled to further payment.84.        Indeed, Wei Sin conceded the following:(a)    For N2, the 95% payment to AL should be\n\n    $307,604.99 (including GST) although AL claimed $389,876.28. As AL has received\n\n    $91,705.02, AL is entitled to be paid at least another $215,899.97.(b)    For N6, the 95% payment to AL should be\n\n    $103,474.50 (including GST), although AL claimed $146,838.87. As AL has received\n\n    $47,946.50, AL is entitled to be paid at least another $55,528.85.        On the differences, AL relied on the\n\ndetails forwarded with its progress claims which were attached to the AEIC of Mr Sim and\n\nthe evidence of PW2 Mr Teo, its expert witness. However, Mr Teo did not go to the site to\n\ncheck the actual work done and his evidence was really a commentary on the valuations\n\ndone.86.        As for Wei Sin, it relied on the evidence\n\nof DW2 Mr Poon. It will be recalled that he is a Senior Manager (Contracts) of Wei Sin. He\n\nis in charge of all the quantity surveyors of Wei Sin but he was not the quantity surveyor\n\nwho did the valuations for N2 and for N6.N2 – 1stitem of dispute87.        The 1stitem of dispute for N2\n\nwas the barricade railing.88.        In AL’s Progress Claim No 5A, BAEIC\n\n142, items 15 and 16, AL had claimed 70% of 705 metres for this item, i.e 494.2 metres.89.        Mr Poon’s valuation at BAEIC 625,\n\nS/No A item 6, alleged that only 345.8 metres of this item had been done by AL.90.        However, the measurements of Wei Sin for\n\nthis item as at 30 July 1999, i.e one month earlier than the date of Progress Claim No 5A,\n\nhad already stated the total measurement of barricade railing done by AL to be 423.6\n\nmetres, see BAEIC 171 items 6 and 7. This was a point made by Mr Teo at NE 124 line 1 to 4\n\nand he was not challenged on it.91.        Furthermore, when Mr Poon gave evidence\n\nfor Wei Sin, he did not explain how it was that Wei Sin had stated the total measurement\n\nfor barricade railing to be 423.6 metres at BAEIC 171, items 6 and 7, but yet had come up\n\nwith 345.8 metres in his subsequent report at BAEIC 625 item 6.92.        Indeed, he did not give any explanation\n\nas to how he had come up with 345.8 metres for this item.93.        Accordingly, I find that there is no\n\nbasis for Wei Sin’s measurement of 345.8 metres which is in any event contradicted by\n\nits earlier measurement of 423.6 metres.94.        In addition, its earlier measurement of\n\n423.6 metres was for work done as at 30 July 1999 and this is not inconsistent with\n\nAL’s claim of 494.2 metres under No 5A which is for work done as at 30 August 1999.95.        Furthermore, Mr Sim who gave evidence for\n\nAL was not challenged on AL’s measurement for this item.96.        Accordingly, I find for AL for this item.\n\nThe difference in the respective measurements in BAEIC 625 is 494.2 metres – 345.8\n\nmetres = 148.4 metres x $150.45 per metre (which rate is not disputed ) = $22,326.78,\n\nbefore taking into account the 5% to be retained and GST.N2 – 2nditem of dispute97.        The 2nditem of dispute is the\n\nAir-condition Ledge Railings and Cloth Drying Racks ‘L-shaped’.98.        AL claims that 406 sets were supplied and\n\ninstalled but Wei Sin alleges that 303.9 sets were installed, see BAEIC 625 S/No A item\n\n18.99.        While DW3 Mr Poon accepted that 406 sets\n\nwere installed by AL, he alleged that the sets installed were not complete. He said that\n\neach set was made up of three parts, i.e:Part 1 - cow hornPart 2 - air-con ledgePart 3 - aluminium clothes rack100.        He said that the percentage of work done\n\nfor each part was:Part 1 - 30%Part 2 - 45%Part 3 - 20%101.        Based on this, he then came up with the\n\nfigure of 303.9 sets. Further details are in BAEIC 627 which is part of his report.102.        However, he also said that the quantity\n\ndone for each part was told to him. In other words, he had no personal knowledge of the\n\nwork done or not done (NE 179 line 11 and 12).103.        In re-examination at NE 187 line 15 to\n\n21, he further said:‘Q     You mentioned you were provided with\n\n    information. Who provided the information?A     For N2, Daniel Chong, the QS of the project\n\n    at the material time. Ms Rogelita, the Project Co-ordinator of N2. Soh Eng Chong, the\n\n    Project Director of N2.For N6, Daniel Chong, the QS and Soh Eng Chong, the Project Director.For the valuations in my affidavit, Daniel Chong and Soh Eng Chong went\n\n    to the site to do physical measurement.’104.        As I have previously said, Daniel Chong\n\nis the QS for N2 only. The QS for N6 is Sim Poh Chuan. Neither was called to give evidence\n\non this item or on any other point for that matter. I draw an adverse inference against\n\nWei Sin for this omission.105.        Ms Rogelita was called to give evidence\n\nas DW1 but not on the valuation of this item.106.        Mr Soh was called to give evidence as\n\nDW2 but also not on the valuation of this item.107.        Furthermore, there was a discrepancy on\n\nWei Sin’s side. The total number of sets under AL’s sub-contract for N2 for this\n\nitem was 518. If only 303.9 sets were supplied and installed by AL, then the remaining\n\nquantity to be supplied and installed by another sub-contractor would be 214.1 sets.108.        However item 3 of BAEIC 630, which is\n\npart of Mr Poon’s own report, shows that the remaining quantity to be supplied and\n\ninstalled was 112 sets only and not 214.1 sets.109.        The 112 sets tally with AL’s claim\n\nof 406 sets as the two quantities added together make up the 518 sets required under\n\nAL’s sub-contract before termination.110.        Accordingly, I find for AL for this\n\nitem. The difference in BAEIC 625 is 406 – 303.9 sets = 102.1 sets x $433.65 per set\n\n(which rate is not disputed) = $44,275.67, before taking into account the 5% to be\n\nretained and GST.N2 – 3rditem of dispute111.        The 3rditem of dispute is\n\nSS304 Pipe Sockets (for Ground Floor Unit only), see BAEIC 625 S/No B, item 7.112.        AL claimed seven sockets at the rate of\n\n$140 per socket.113.        Wei Sin alleged only five sockets were\n\nsupplied and installed and the correct rate was $130 per unit.114.        AL did not pursue the quantity of seven\n\nin cross-examination.115.        As for the rate, BAEIC 171 at Variation\n\nWork Order Ref No 8 indicates the rate to be $140 per unit. BAEIC 171 is part of the\n\nvaluation by Wei Sin’s QS.116.        However, BAEIC 300 which is a document\n\nfrom Wei Sin entitled ‘Breakdown of Variation Work’ shows the rate to be $130\n\nper unit. The rate of $140 per unit used by the QS was probably an error.117.        Accordingly, I reject AL’s claim\n\nfor the difference both in terms of quantity and rate.N2 – 4thitem of dispute118.        The 4thitem of dispute is\n\nLong Galvanised Steel Railing.119.        AL’s sub-contract had originally\n\nprovided for the installation of this item which is identified at BAEIC 625 S/No A items\n\n8, 11 and 12.120.        However as the items were subsequently\n\ntaken out from the sub-contract (and replaced by other items), AL did not claim payment\n\nfor the omitted items.121.        Notwithstanding this, Wei Sin proceeded\n\nto deduct the dollar value of these items from AL’s claim.122.        I do not agree that Wei Sin is entitled\n\nto make the deductions. The issue is not what the value of AL’s sub-contract is but\n\nthe value of AL’s works done. As AL had not claimed payment for these items in the\n\nfirst place, Wei Sin was wrong to make deductions for them.123.        The deductions for these items total\n\n$10,089 which should be added back to the monies payable to AL. This does not yet take\n\ninto account the 5% to be retained and the GST.N2 – 5thitem of dispute124.        The 5thitem of dispute is\n\nGalvanised Steel Railing below ramp at Deck 1A.125.        AL claims $1,520 for this item.126.        Wei Sin says it was not done by AL.\n\nHowever, this item is not reflected as an outstanding item which had to be done by another\n\nsub-contractor of Wei Sin in BAEIC 630 and there was no suggestion that this item was\n\ntaken out from the main contract altogether. So it must have been done by AL.127.        Accordingly, I find for AL for this item\n\nof $1,520 before taking into account the 5% to be retained and GST.Summary for N2128.        Although Mr Shetty submitted that Wei\n\nSin’s valuation for N2 was largely unchallenged, this was not true. Mr Quek had\n\nchallenged the valuation for the items in dispute.129.        Indeed, the shoe is on the other foot,\n\nMr Shetty did not challenge Mr Sim on AL’s claims for N2 as to whether certain work\n\nhad in fact been done by AL.130.        The further sum to be paid to AL for\n\nwork done under N2 taking into account the 5% to be retained and adding GST would be:(a)    Amount conceded by Wei Sin: $215,899.97(this amount already takes into account the 5% retention and GST)(b)    Add the following:-    Under para 96      :\n\n          $22,326.78-    Under para 110    :\n\n          $44,275.76-    Under para 123    :\n\n          $10,089.00-    Under para 127    :\n\n          $ 1,520.00_________$78,211.45Less 5%, so 95%       :\n\n          $74,300.88Add 3% GST\n\n                  :\n\n          $ 2,229.03__________$76,529.91   \n\n                       $ 76,529.91___________$292,429.88___________N6 – 1stand only item of dispute131.        The 1stand only item of\n\ndispute for N6 is the Air-Condition Ledge Railings and Cloth Drying Racks\n\n‘L-shaped’. This is the same item as the 2nditem of dispute in N2.132.        For N6, AL were claiming for the supply\n\nand installation of 282 sets whereas Wei Sin said only 179.81 sets were supplied and\n\ninstalled, see BAEIC 639 S/No A item 7.133.        It is true that Mr Quek did not\n\nchallenge DW3 Mr Poon on this item. However, in his report at BAEIC 103, PW2 Mr Teo had\n\nalready challenged the quantity alleged by Wei Sin by pointing out a discrepancy on Wei\n\nSin’s side. I will elaborate on the discrepancy later.134.        Secondly, the basis for Wei Sin’s\n\narriving at 179.81 sets for N6 was not explained by Mr Poon at trial. He gave an\n\nexplanation for this item only in the context of N2. Nor was any supporting document for\n\nthis figure found with his AEIC, although one is found in an earlier affidavit of one Tan\n\nBeng Choo filed in Order 14 proceedings. Tan Beng Choo was not called as a witness.135.        Thirdly, if I were to apply Mr\n\nPoon’s evidence for N2, I would conclude infer that Mr Poon also did not have\n\npersonal knowledge about how much was done or omitted for this item in N6.136.        Fourthly, there was a discrepancy on Wei\n\nSin’s side as pointed out by Mr Teo. The total number of sets under AL’s\n\nsub-contract for N6 for this item was 334. If only 179.81 sets were supplied and installed\n\nby AL, then the remaining quantity to be supplied and installed by another sub-contractor\n\nwould be 154.19 sets.137.        However, item 1 of BAEIC 641, which is\n\npart of Mr Poon’s own report, shows that the remaining quantity was 51 sets and not\n\n154.19 sets.138.        The 51 sets just about tallies with\n\nAL’s claim of 282 sets as the two quantities added together make up 333 sets, just\n\none short of the 334 sets required under AL’s sub-contract before termination.139.        Mr Teo’s point about the\n\ndiscrepancy was not challenged by Mr Shetty (see NE 124 line 20 to NE 125 line 8). Neither\n\ndid Mr Shetty challenge PW1 Mr Sim on the number of sets claimed by AL for this item.140.        Accordingly, I find for AL for this\n\nitem. The difference is 282 – 179.81 sets = 102.19 sets x $433.65 per set (which rate\n\nis not disputed) = $44,314.69 before taking into account the 5% to be retained and GST.141.        The further sum to be paid to AL for\n\nwork done under N6 taking into account the 5% to be retained and adding GST would be:(a)    Amount conceded by Wei Sin: $55,528.00(this amount already takes\n\n    into account the 5% retention and GST)(b)    Add the following:-    Under para 140    :\n\n          $44,314.69Less 5%, so 95%       :\n\n          $42,098.96Add 3% GST\n\n                   :\n\n          $ 1,262.97__________$43,361.93\n\n                          $43,361.93__________$98,889.93__________WHETHER WEI SIN OR AL HAD VALIDLY TERMINATED THE N2 AND THE N6\n\nSUB-CONTRACTS142.        Clause 1 of each Letter of Award states:‘1. PROGRAMME OF WORKTime is the essence of this contract. The Sub-Contractor shall execute\n\n    his work on strict compliance with the agreed schedule and programme.’143.        However this provision must be read in\n\nthe context of the rest of the terms.144.        As I have mentioned, each Letter of\n\nAward incorporated the Standard Conditions.145.        Clause 7 of the Standard Conditions\n\nstates:‘7. TERMINATION OF CONTRACTThis Sub-contract shall be terminated in the event the Sub-Contractor\n\n    default in the followings:(a)     fails to proceed with the sub-contract\n\n    works with due diligence and expedition after being required in writing to do so by the\n\n    Main Contractor, or(b)     refuses or neglects to remove defective\n\n    materials or make good defective work after being directed in writing to do so by the Main\n\n    Contractor, or(c)     fails to perform his obligations in\n\n    accordance with the sub-contractor (sic) after being required in writing to do so\n\n    by the Main Contractor(d)     commits an act of bankruptcy or goes into\n\n    liquidation.For items (a) to (c), the Sub-Contractor will be given three (3) days\n\n    to comply. Upon such determination, the rights and liabilities of the Main Contractor\n\n    shall be the same as if the Sub-Contractor have repudiated this contract. The Main\n\n    Contractor reserve the right to recover all loss and cost from the Sub-Contractor.’146.        Wei Sin’s case was that for each of\n\nthe sub-contracts, it was entitled to terminate and did terminate the sub-contract under\n\nClause 7(a), (b) and (c) of the Standard Conditions.147.        However, there was no discrete\n\nallegation of breach under Clause 7(c) which was not already supposed to be covered by\n\nClause 7(a) or 7(b).148.        Wei Sin relied on various minutes and\n\ncorrespondence and faxes in which AL was told of delay and defects in its works for each\n\nsub-contract.149.        AL’s position was that it had not\n\nbeen paid on its progress claims and because of this its works had progressed more slowly\n\nand defects were not rectified.150.        AL also took the position that there was\n\nno written schedule for its work and that the schedules were orally given. However, the\n\ncorrespondence and faxes appeared to refer to written schedules and some also contained\n\nwritten schedules. Eventually, AL’s Mr Sim had to concede that some of the schedules\n\nwere in writing although some were oral.151.        Although Mr Sim also suggested that the\n\nmanner in which Wei Sin co-ordinated the works was haphazard, nothing material turns on\n\nthis allegation as he did not elaborate with specifics.152.        I will deal with the sub-contracts\n\nseparately as they are two different contracts in law.153.        However, unless it is material, I will\n\nnot regurgitate the contents of all the minutes, correspondence and faxes which I was\n\nreferred to. For N2, I will refer to the dates of these documents with a brief\n\nelaboration. For N6, I will summarise the documentary evidence since the material evidence\n\nfor N6 is the same documents as pertain to N2.154.        References in the documents to\n\n‘GI’ means galvanised iron, ‘MS’ means mild steel and ‘SS’\n\nmeans stainless steel.Termination of N2 sub-contract155.    (a)     April 1999 (BAEIC 317).

However the fax assumes that the dates of the claims are also\n\n    the due dates for payment which is not correct.]You will no doubt appreciate that progress payments form the\n\n    life-blood of any contractor and our clients are no exception. In view of your failure to\n\n    pay the progress payments punctually or in full, and thereby in breach of the contract,\n\n    our clients are unable to continue to supply and carry out the contractual works when\n\n    payment is not forthcoming.Despite promises on your part to pay our clients the arrears owing on\n\n    the progress payments, you have not done so todate.By reason of your breach of contract, you have left our clients with no\n\n    alternative but to insist that the arrears owing on the progress payments under both\n\n    contracts and totalling $397,063.62 are to be paid in full by 9th September 1999.

We set out our clients’ substantive reply to\n\n    your letter.2.     We confirm that the Contracts were awarded\n\n    to your clients on 15thMarch 1999 and were in fact only accepted by your\n\n    clients on 20thApril 1999.3.     Our clients wholly deny any breach of the\n\n    Contracts as alleged by you or at all.4.     We are instructed that shortly after the\n\n    appointment of your clients as the metal works sub-contractor for the above captioned\n\n    projects, your clients fell into severe delay in respect of their scheduled installation\n\n    works. Further, your clients were haphazard in the installation of their metal works\n\n    resulting in numerous defects in the said installation. Despite repeated written and\n\n    verbal notifications and reminders from our clients, your clients failed and/or refused to\n\n    expedite their work so as to meet the schedule and rectify the defective works.5.     In fact as early as 14thApril\n\n    1999, our clients had written to your clients in respect of a considerable number of\n\n    defects in the sample unit (N6 C28 project). Enclosed in our clients’ letter to your\n\n    client was a copy of the Architect’s comments with respect your clients’\n\n    defective works.6.     Following this, our clients had written to\n\n    your clients on numerous occasions concerning their slow and tardy work and the resultant\n\n    defects in the same. On 12thAugust 1999, your clients submitted to our clients\n\n    a revised works schedule which your clients had promised would be fulfilled. Despite their\n\n    promise, the said works schedule was not fulfilled. On 18thAugust 1999, our\n\n    clients’ Contracts Manager had again written to your clients setting out a detailed\n\n    list of our clients’ previous correspondence to your clients concerning their slow\n\n    and defective work. To date, this situation has not been rectified by your clients.7.     Insofar as you alleged that our clients have\n\n    breached the Contracts by failing to pay progress payments promptly, we would highlight\n\n    Clause 4 of the Contracts and Clauses 1, 12 and 13 of the our clients’ Standard\n\n    Conditions of Contract for Supply and Install Sub-Contract (\"the Standard\n\n    Conditions\"). Pursuant to the terms of the Contracts, your clients work is subject to\n\n    the approval of HDB’s representatives and all relevant authorities. Needless to say,\n\n    your clients’ work has not been approved by the relevant authorities.8.     We would also highlight that despite the\n\n    considerable amount of correspondence from our clients to your clients concerning their\n\n    defective and slow progress of works, your clients have failed to put forward any remedial\n\n    plan of action as required under Clause 7 of the Standard Conditions.9.     In light of the above, we, for and on behalf\n\n    of our clients, hereby give your clients notice of termination of the Contracts pursuant\n\n    to Clauses 7(a), 7(b) and 7(c) of the Standard Conditions.10.     Our clients hereby reserve their rights to\n\n    look to your clients for all costs, loss and damage which are incurred or will be incurred\n\n    by our clients as a result of your clients breaches of their obligations under the\n\n    Contracts.Yours faithfully(Michael Palmer)cc. clients’(y)10 September 1999(AB 213).

Accordingly, I am of the view that\n\nit is not every written notice about the same that will constitute a written notice\n\npursuant to a provision for termination. If that were the case, life would be impossible\n\nfor the recipient of the written notice.158.        It is incumbent on a party who wishes to\n\nexercise its right to terminate a contract or sub-contract to make it clear that the\n\nwritten notice is being given pursuant to the provision for termination.159.        Ideally, the written notice should\n\nidentify the provision that it is issued pursuant to, although I do not say that this is\n\nalways necessary (seeSupamarl Ltd v Federated Homes Ltd[1981] 9 Con LR 25).\n\nHowever the recipient must be left in no doubt that the notice was sent pursuant to a\n\nparticular provision since complaints or chasers in the construction industry are not\n\nuncommon.160.        AL have admitted to some delay but have\n\nnot conceded that they would have been unable to catch up with the delay.161.        As for defects, Wei Sin has a few photos\n\nof defective works for N2 but they are by no means comprehensive. AL have admitted to the\n\nexistence of defects but said they were minor.162.        Prior to 2 August 1999 there were\n\nvarious faxes or letters from Wei Sin primarily about delay, although concern was also\n\nexpressed about the adequacy of expansion bolts and workmanship. However, none of the\n\ndocuments from Wei Sin referred to Clause 7. Neither was there any intimation therein that\n\nany was sent pursuant to Clause 7 or any other provision.163.        It was only in the letter dated 2 August\n\n1999 that a reference is made to one of the terms in the Standard Conditions (see para\n\n155(m) above). Even then, the reference was to Clause 13 and not Clause 7. Secondly the\n\nreference to Clause 13 then was in the context of the aluminium sunbreakers only.164.        Clause 13 states:‘13. FAILURE TO PERFORMIf the Sub-Contractor should fail to carry out any part of the work\n\n    under this contract, the Main Contractor reserve the right to engage others or carry out\n\n    the work himself and recover from the Sub-Contractor all additional cost and any loss\n\n    suffered as a result.’165.        In the next notice i.e the fax dated 16\n\nAugust 1999 from Wei Sin, the primary concern was about delay, although unacceptable\n\nworkmanship was also mentioned (see para 155(o) above).166.        However, the concern about delay was\n\nfocussed on the sunbreakers and sun louvres. The threat to resort to other alternatives\n\nwas, in my view, also in the context of the delay in respect of these items.167.        I find that the 16 August 1999 notice\n\nwas also sent pursuant to Clause 13 coming as it did after the notice dated 2 August 1999\n\nand in view of the substance of the 2 and 16 August 1999 notices. The threat was not to\n\nterminate the sub-contract but to engage other sub-contractors for certain specific areas\n\nof work supposed to be done by AL.168.        In the fax dated 18 August 1999, Wei Sin\n\ninformed AL that it was engaging others to complete outstanding MS and galvanised steel\n\nwork. Sunbreakers and sun louvres would be taken out from AL’s sub-contract. AL was\n\nto carry on with stainless steel work and given a week’s grace period to complete all\n\noutstanding stainless steel work (see para 155(q) above).169.        This fax also does not refer to any\n\nparticular provision of the Standard Conditions. Again, I find that Wei Sin was in fact\n\nacting pursuant to Clause 13 and not Clause 7.170.        Finally, I revert to HEP’s fax\n\ndated 10 September 1999 which was sent pursuant to Clause 7(a), (b) and (c) of the\n\nStandard Conditions.171.        There are various errors in that fax.172.        For example, it is not true that\n\nAL’s work is subject to approval of HDB so that absence of such approval would\n\ndisentitle AL to payment. Clause 12 of the Standard Conditions refers not to approval for\n\nthe purpose of paying progress claims but that final acceptance of AL’s works would\n\nbe subject to approval by HDB and all relevant authorities. Secondly, Clause 7 does not\n\nrequire a remedial plan from AL.173.    In any event, under Clause 7, AL was to be given three days to\n\ncomply with a prior written notice before Wei Sin can terminate the sub-contract.174.        In response to my question as to whether\n\nthe prior notice under Clause 7 had been given, Mr Shetty referred to the one week grace\n\nperiod given in Wei Sin’s fax dated 18 August 1999. He submitted that this was more\n\nthan the three days prior written notice required under Clause 7.175.        I have the following observations about\n\nthis response.176.        First, Wei Sin’s Defence and\n\nCounterclaim does not identify the 18 August 1999 telefax as the prior notice under Clause\n\n7.177.        Secondly, as I have mentioned, that fax\n\ndid not refer specifically to Clause 7. Mr Shetty had assumed it was sent pursuant to\n\nClause 7. He had not taken into account that it might have been sent pursuant to Clause 13\n\ninstead. Neither did he take into account the earlier notice dated 2 August 1999 from Wei\n\nSin which specifically refers to Clause 13 and not Clause 7.178.        Thirdly the fax dated 18 August 1999 had\n\npurported to tell AL that other sub-contractors had been engaged for mild steel and\n\ngalvanised steel work. The one week grace period was given only in relation to stainless\n\nsteel work and not in relation to the entire sub-contract for N2.179.        Fourthly, none of the witnesses for Wei\n\nSin had alleged that the intention was to send the 18 August 1999 fax pursuant to Clause\n\n7. For example, DW1 Ms Rogelita said that she had drafted most of Wei Sin’s\n\ncorrespondence for N2 but she did not say that the 18 August 1999 fax was sent pursuant to\n\nClause 7.180.        I find that the fax dated 18 August 1999\n\nwas not the prior three day notice required under Clause 7.181.        The truth is that Wei Sin had never\n\nintended to terminate the sub-contract prior to HEP’s fax dated 10 September 1999.\n\nThis is reinforced by its faxes subsequent to 18 August 1999 which I have referred to\n\nabove.182.        However after Wei Sin was faced with the\n\ndemand fax dated 4 September 1999 from B T Tan & Co, it decided on a pre-emptive\n\nstrike. That is why the fax dated 10 September 1999 from HEP was sent before B T Tan &\n\nCo acted to terminate the sub-contract.183.        Had HEP given the three day prior\n\nwritten notice instead, B T Tan & Co would have terminated the sub-contract before the\n\nexpiry of the three day notice.184.        I find that the purported termination\n\nnotice by HEP pursuant to Clause 7 was not a valid one.185.        As Wei Sin have not pleaded or submitted\n\nthat AL’s conduct or the fax demand dated 4 September 1999 from B T Tan & Co\n\nconstituted a repudiatory breach by AL in any event, I need not consider this point any\n\nfurther.186.        I come back to the fax dated 10\n\nSeptember 1999 from B T Tan & Co (see para 155(y) above).187.        It refers to HEP’s letter dated 7\n\nSeptember 1999. There is no such letter before me, only the one from HEP dated 10\n\nSeptember 1999. There is, however, a 7 September 1999 fax from Wei Sin (see para 155(w)\n\nabove). The reference to 7 September 1999 was probably an inadvertent error.188.        However, I also note that B T Tan &\n\nCo’s fax dated 10 September 1999 does not specify whether Wei Sin’s breach of\n\ncontract is only as regards the failure to pay the progress claims or it includes the\n\ninvalid notice from HEP dated 10 September 1999. The Statement of Claim seems to refer to\n\nboth as repudiatory breaches by Wei Sin but again this is not clear.189.        As for the closing submissions, para 120\n\nof Mr Quek’s Closing Submission submits that the HEP notice was an anticipatory\n\nbreach and Mr Shetty’s Closing Submission at para 2(ii) and 8(2) assumes that AL have\n\nraised the argument that the HEP notice was a repudiatory breach.190.        Accordingly, I will deal with both\n\npoints, i.e whether Wei Sin’s failure to pay and whether HEP’s notice each\n\nconstituted repudiatory breaches.191.        As regards the question whether delay in\n\npayment would constitute a repudiatory breach, I need refer to the following authorities\n\nonly.192.        Hudson’s Building and Engineering\n\nContracts 1995 Eleventh Edition states at p 622 to 623:‘(e) Payment obligations and set-offMere breach of a payment obligation does not constitute a common\n\n    law repudiation. The principle is to consider whether the circumstances of the non-payment\n\n    show an intention not to be bound: \"The principle to be applied in these cases is\n\n    whether the non-delivery or the non-payment amounts to an abandonment of the contract or a\n\n    refusal to perform it on the part of the person making the default\". Thus inMersey\n\n    Steel & Iron v. Naylorwhere a supplier of steel to be delivered by instalments\n\n    was not entitled to refuse to deliver a late delivery on the ground of non-payment of the\n\n    instalment for an earlier delivery, Lord Blackburn said:\"There was a statement that for reasons which they thought\n\n      sufficient, they were not willing to pay for the iron at present, and if that statement\n\n      had been an absolute refusal to pay … I will not say it might not have been evidence\n\n      to go to the jury, for them to say whether it would not amount to a refusal to go on with\n\n      the contract, for a man might reasonably so consider it. But there is nothing of that kind\n\n      here.\"So a clear indication of refusal or inability to pay future instalments\n\n    will be a repudiation, as also a repeated failure to pay on time in response to warnings,\n\n    if raising the inference of an intention to pay late habitually so as to derive financial\n\n    advantage, it is submitted. Generally, delay in making payments, if sufficiently serious\n\n    and persisted in after warnings, may, after a suitable notice, justify rescission, the\n\n    more so in the absence of provisions for interest on late payment in the contract.’193.        Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore Volume\n\n2 p 374 to 375 states:‘[30.290] Repudiation in generalThe defaulting party repudiates the contract when he intimates by\n\n    words or conduct that he does not intend to honour his obligations under the contract when\n\n    they fall due. A repudiation can be made explicitly or implicitly. A breach of contract\n\n    can also be anticipatory and the innocent party would be entitled to treat it as\n\n    repudiated if the threatened non-performance has the effect of depriving him ‘of\n\n    substantially the whole benefit which it was the intention of the parties that he should\n\n    obtain from the primary obligations of the parties under the contract’. There can be\n\n    repudiation where one party insists on carrying out his obligations in his own way that is\n\n    substantially inconsistent with his obligations under the contract. Not every refusal to\n\n    proceed with the contract can be regarded as a repudiation. If the decision is taken bona\n\n    fide based on an erroneous interpretation of the contract, put in a way that is open to\n\n    correction, it may not necessarily be regarded as repudiation.[30.291] Repudiation by employerInstances of repudiatory breaches include the employer’s\n\n    failure to give possession of the site to the contractor or where the contractor is\n\n    wrongfully ejected from the site and where the architect or contract administrator refuses\n\n    to certify payment at the appropriate time or constantly under-certifies the amount due\n\n    arising from undue interference by the employer. A mere failure or delay by the employer\n\n    in making payment per se would not amount to a repudiation. However, the position would be\n\n    different if it can be demonstrated that the employer was ‘not merely stalling for\n\n    time to make payment’ to the contractor but that he did not intend to pay the\n\n    contractor ‘at all and perform the contract’. It is possible that a general and\n\n    consistent refusal to pay instalments for goods on the due dates or make interim payments\n\n    may be considered either as a demonstration of such a intention or by itself suffice to\n\n    constitute repudiatory conduct. ….’194.        Law and Practice of Construction\n\nContract Claim by Chow Kok Fong, Second Edition, states at p 264:‘A party to a building contract may find it necessary to bring his\n\n    involvement in the contract to an end where the other party has committed a breach of\n\n    contract and this breach is so serious as to undermine the fundamental commercial\n\n    objectives of the innocent party under the contract. In deciding to resort to this\n\n    recourse, the innocent party will take into account both the magnitude and nature of the\n\n    breach. Thus a single instance of late payment may not be sufficient to warrant\n\n    termination, but a persistent course of payment delays or a protracted delay in the\n\n    payment of a very substantial amount may lead a contractor to contemplate termination as a\n\n    means of mitigating his loss.’At p 277:‘It is suggested that it would not be sufficient if the\n\n    non-payment arises only from the employer’s belief that the amount due to the\n\n    contractor should be set off against the contractor’s liability for liquidated\n\n    damages or defective work. On the other hand, clearly, non-payment becomes a serious\n\n    breach if it intimates an intention by the employer not to be bound by the payment terms\n\n    of the contract regardless of how well the contractor fulfilled his obligations under the\n\n    contract.’195.        InBrani Readymixed Pte Ltd v Yee\n\nHong Pte Ltd[1995] 1 SLR 205, the Court of Appeal recognised that the mere failure or\n\ndelay in making payment per se would not amount to a repudiation. However, on the facts in\n\nthat case, the Court of Appeal found that there was repudiation.196.        I have already set out above in detail\n\nthe extent of the arbitrary conduct of Wei Sin regarding the progress claims by AL for N2\n\nresulting not only in delay in payment but also in under-paying AL even when payment was\n\npaid. Indeed, initially, AL did not know that Wei Sin had been paying less than what its\n\nown QS had recommended as there was no indication from Wei Sin that it was withholding\n\nsums, beyond the 5% retention, for delay or defects. This culminated in Wei Sin\n\nwithholding the entire $90,000 for Progress Claim No 3 even after it was (a) recommended\n\nfor payment by the QS, (b) due for payment and (c) after Wei Sin had agreed to pay the\n\nsame.197.        The entire $90,000 was withheld without\n\nany attempt by Wei Sin to assess at the material time the impact of AL’s delay on the\n\nmain contract works or the cost of rectifying defects.198.        I find that while Wei Sin wanted AL to\n\ncarry out its obligations, it was content to exercise its obligations in its own way\n\nsubstantially inconsistent with such obligations. Wei Sin had acted in an arbitrary and,\n\nindeed, oppressive manner and was quite content not to abide by such obligations as and\n\nwhen they fell due if this suited its purpose.199.        I find that Wei Sin’s conduct prior\n\nto HEP’s notice dated 10 September 1999 was repudiatory in nature.200.        As regards the question whether an\n\ninvalid notice of termination may constitute repudiation, Halsbury’s Laws of\n\nSingapore Vol 2 states at p 381:‘[30.300] Procedural requirementsMost standard form contracts specify a procedure for the party\n\n    seeking termination to carry out. To avoid any sudden and unexpected termination or any\n\n    uncertainty as to whether a termination has taken place, most of these procedures laid out\n\n    require the party seeking termination to go through at least two stages where certain\n\n    specific actions must be taken or notices given. The SIA form (5th Ed), for instance,\n\n    provides for the issuance of a termination certificate by the architect and a notice of\n\n    termination by the employer. Similarly the PSSCC95 provides for the issuance of a\n\n    termination certificate by the superintending officer. On the issuance of such a\n\n    certificate and the occurrence of certain specified events, the employer ‘may give to\n\n    the contractor notice in writing of the termination of the employment of the\n\n    contractor’. An employer’s purported termination that did not comply with the\n\n    procedural requirements or which is found to be invalid for other reasons may amount to a\n\n    repudiation of the contract that the contractor is entitled to accept. …[30.303] Wrongful exercise of purported right to terminateA party who asserts a right to terminate that is later found to be\n\n    unjustified or wrong may find his own conduct held to be repudiatory. This can occur where\n\n    some procedural requirement has not been complied with, where the grounds of termination\n\n    are not made out, where the party alleged to be in breach has in fact been released from\n\n    its obligations, where termination was made on the basis of a purported fundamental breach\n\n    or breach of a fundamental term that was later found to be not fundamental or where the\n\n    party seeking termination has himself caused the alleged defaulting act.’201.        I am of the view that Wei Sin did not\n\ngenuinely believe that it was entitled to terminate the sub-contract for N2. It was trying\n\nto prevent AL from exercising its right to terminate first. I find that the invalid notice\n\nby HEP also constituted a repudiatory breach by Wei Sin.202.        Each of these repudiatory breaches has\n\nbeen accepted by B T Tan & Co and the sub-contract for N2 has been terminated by AL.Contractor’s right to suspend work or go slow203.        On another point, Mr Quek had submitted\n\nin para 18 of his Closing Submission that one of the main issues was whether any act of\n\nprevention by Wei Sin had resulted in the delay of the work by AL.204.        However, this allegation was not\n\npleaded.205.        Secondly, the evidence of PW1 Mr Sim on\n\nthis point was general and vague. It seems to me that the failure by Wei Sin to pay on\n\ntime and to make full payment had caused a cash-flow problem for AL but not something more\n\ndesperate. Certainly there was no concrete evidence about financial impossibility.206.        Thirdly, while Mr Quek mentioned the\n\nargument as to whether there was any act of prevention by Wei Sin in his Closing\n\nSubmission, Mr Quek did not develop this argument.207.        Therefore, it is not necessary for me to\n\ndeal with this argument any further save that I should mention a point of law that Mr\n\nShetty had raised in connection with it.208.        Mr Shetty sought to persuade me that\n\neven if Wei Sin had defaulted in its payment obligations, this did not entitle AL to\n\nsuspend its work or to go slow. He cited the following passage from the judgment of\n\nWoodhouse and Cooke JJ, delivered by Cooke J, in the New Zealand case ofCanterbury\n\nPipe Lines Ltd v The Christchurch Drainage Board[1979] 16 BLR 76at p 95:‘… we are against recognising such a right [to stop work by\n\n    reason of substantial default by the employer in paying a certified progress payment] when\n\n    the architect or engineer has declined to issue the certificate stipulated for by the\n\n    contract as the condition precedent to the employer’s duty to pay. It would disrupt\n\n    the scheme of the contracts. It could encourage contractors to take the law into their own\n\n    hands…. In such cases, if the contractor cannot prove impossibility or its\n\n    equivalent, he will be left with whatever remedies regarding the recovery of progress\n\n    payments may be available to him under the contract.’209.        I have read the judgment delivered by\n\nCooke J. It is not authority for the wide proposition that Mr Shetty was advocating and\n\nthe passage that he had cited was taken out of context by him.210.        The judgment makes it clear that it is\n\nconfined to the situation where a consultant has declined to issue a certificate as a\n\ncondition precedent to the obligation to pay and left the issue open as regards other\n\nsituations where, as in the case before me, the obligation to pay is not dependent on such\n\na certificate.211.        Indeed, the judgment of McMullin J in\n\nthe same case seems to favour a right on the part of a contractor not to proceed with work\n\nif the party obliged to pay withholds and continues to withhold payment, and thereby makes\n\nit financially impossible for the contractor to carry on.212.        At p 119, McMullin J said:‘Although I have been unable to find any case where the wrongful\n\n    withholding of a progress payment has been held to be a breach of the rule that a party to\n\n    a contract shall not profit by his own wrong and, to that extent the judgment may appear\n\n    to be breaking new ground, there would seem to be no difference in principle between an\n\n    employer who keeps a contractor out of his land (Holme v Guppy), or fails to supply\n\n    the requisite plans (Roberts v Bury Commissioners), or unjustifiably interferes in\n\n    the course of building (Russell v Bandeira), and an employer who keeps his\n\n    contractor out of payment for work already done, declares his intention to keep him out of\n\n    payments in the future, denies him arbitration on these very matters and requires him to\n\n    continue with the work. The differences go only to the means by which the wrongs were\n\n    done, not to their effect. The Board’s acts were such as to prevent and make\n\n    impossible the performance of the contract as effectively as if it had denied appellant\n\n    access to the works. …’213.        Mr Shetty also relied on a passage in\n\nthe judgment of Judge Hawser QC in the case ofSupamarl Ltd v Federated Homes Ltd[1981] 9 Con LR 25 at p 28:‘Even if Federated were in breach of contract in failure to pay, I\n\n    do not think that this would exercise or justify failure by Supamarl to proceed with their\n\n    work in a proper manner.’214.        However, Judge Hawser did not cite any\n\nauthority for the proposition he had mentioned.215.        Therefore, I will say only that the\n\nquestion whether a contractor or sub-contractor may suspend work or go slow if there is\n\ndefault in payment to it and this has rendered its performance financially impossible is\n\nnot a simple one.Other arguments by Mr Shetty216.        Mr Shetty had various other arguments.217.        He submitted that AL was incapable of\n\nfulfilling its obligations for two reasons: (a) financial incapability and (b) lack of\n\nmaterials.218.        As regards the first reason, there is\n\ninsufficient evidence to establish that AL was financially incapable of carrying out its\n\nobligations even if Wei Sin had not withheld payment.219.        As for the second reason, PW1 Mr Sim has\n\nexplained and I accept that there was a shortage of material on AL’s part because Wei\n\nSin withheld payment from AL.220.        In any event, these two reasons do not\n\nadvance Wei Sin’s case much as I have found HEP’s termination notice to be\n\ninvalid.221.        Mr Shetty also suggested that AL was\n\ntrying to put pressure on Wei Sin by going slow as AL knew that Wei Sin would be liable\n\nfor liquidated damages to HDB. He relied on a sentence in the evidence of PW1 Mr Sim at NE\n\n65 line 5 to 12:‘Q Instead of Plaintiffs’ increasing manpower on site for N6\n\n    and improving progress, Plaintiffs’ lawyers sent a letter of demand 4 days later?A Yes. But for more than one month there was all talk of payment.\n\n    Defendants also asked us to do additional work. We bought material.We felt that if\n\n    they keep delaying it will ultimately affect the Defendants having to pay LD to HDB.\n\n    If Defendants keep delaying and we continue doing the work, for new work there would be a\n\n    problem, no money coming in for us to buy material and pay workers. For touch up, no\n\n    problem.’[Emphasis added.]222.        I do not think that the isolated\n\nsentence which Mr Shetty was relying on shows that AL was trying to put pressure on Wei\n\nSin by going slow. AL was aware that if Wei Sin is faced with a claim for liquidated\n\ndamages due to AL’s delay, Wei Sin would in turn claim the same liquidated damages\n\nagainst AL.223.        The totality of Mr Sim’s evidence\n\nduring the trial was that AL was concerned that if they did the work, Wei Sin would still\n\nwithhold payment.Summary on termination of N2 sub-contract224.        In summary, the termination of the\n\nsub-contract for N2 by HEP on behalf of Wei Sin is not valid. On the other hand, B T Tan\n\n& Co have validly terminated the sub-contract on behalf of AL.Main claims by Wei Sin for N2225.        Accordingly, Wei Sin is not entitled to\n\nclaim damages for engaging other sub-contractors to complete the outstanding work of AL in\n\nrespect of N2. However, Mr Quek has conceded in para 95 of his Closing Submission that Wei\n\nSin may claim damages for engaging other sub-contractors to rectify AL’s defective\n\nwork, subject of course to Wei Sin proving the nature and extent of defective work and the\n\nquantum of rectification.226.        As for damages for delay, Wei Sin did\n\nnot claim it is entitled to this even if its termination for N2 is invalid. As its\n\ntermination is not valid, it is not entitled to claim damages for delay. However, for\n\ncompleteness, I will deal with this claim on the assumption that Wei Sin’s\n\ntermination is valid.227.        Under Clause 8 of the Standard\n\nConditions, AL is to pay liquidated damages payable for delay to Wei Sin at rates which\n\nare pegged to the rates payable by Wei Sin to HDB. For N2, Wei Sin is claiming $1,412,670\n\nas liquidated damages against AL.228.        However, I had ascertained from DW2 Mr\n\nSoh that HDB was not making any claim for liquidated damages against Wei Sin for N2 as\n\nsufficient extension of time had been granted by HDB to Wei Sin.229.        Subsequently, I asked Mr Shetty why Wei\n\nSin was claiming liquidated damages for N2.230.        He said that he was of the view that Wei\n\nSin was entitled to claim the theoretical maximum. He suggested that Wei Sin had claimed\n\ndamages to be assessed and not liquidated damages as such. He also said that Wei Sin had\n\ngiven up something to HDB in exchange for HDB not claiming liquidated damages for N2.231.        I am of the view that this is an\n\nunsatisfactory explanation. AL is liable to pay liquidated damages to Wei Sin only if Wei\n\nSin is liable for liquidated damages to HDB for delay caused by AL. That is why the rates\n\nof liquidated damages which may be payable by AL are identical to that which may be\n\npayable by Wei Sin to HDB. As HDB is not claiming any liquidated damages against Wei Sin\n\nfor N2, Wei Sin cannot claim any liquidated damages against AL.232.        Although the Defence and Counterclaim\n\nhad claimed damages generally, the Voluntary Particulars thereof had mentioned\n\nspecifically liquidated damages and the sum claimed under this head.233.        I am of the view that Wei Sin’s\n\nclaim for about $1.4m liquidated damages was a fraudulent claim. Wei Sin had included this\n\nclaim for two reasons.234.        First, if this claim had not been made,\n\nthe quantum of the rest of Wei Sin’s counterclaim would have been less than the\n\nbalance amount which Wei Sin had conceded was to be paid to AL. The claim for liquidated\n\ndamages was therefore to justify Wei Sin’s withholding any further payment to AL in\n\nthe meantime.235.        Secondly, the huge sum claimed for\n\nliquidated damages was to put undue pressure on AL.236.        If indeed Wei Sin had to give up\n\nsomething to HDB in exchange for an extension of time to avoid liquidated damages, that is\n\na different matter altogether which must be pleaded but was not. Neither was there any\n\nevidence alluding to it.237.        Accordingly, even if Wei Sin’s\n\ntermination of the sub-contract for N2 is valid, Wei Sin is not entitled to claim any\n\ndamages, whether liquidated or not, for alleged delay by AL in respect of N2. It is not a\n\nquestion of leaving this head of claim to be assessed.Termination of N6 sub-contract238.        As in N2, there were faxes or letters\n\nfrom Wei Sin to AL in respect of N6 complaining about delay and poor workmanship.239.        There were also minutes of meetings\n\nraising these points but it was not suggested that these constitute written notification\n\nunder Clause 7 of the Standard Conditions.240.        I do not intend to list out the faxes or\n\nletters as I did for N2.241.        Suffice it for me to say that, as in N2,\n\nnone of the faxes or letters from Wei Sin prior to 2 August 1999 referred to Clause 7 of\n\nthe Standard Conditions. Neither was there any intimation in any of them that it was sent\n\npursuant to Clause 7 or any other provision.242.        As in N2, there was a similar letter\n\nfrom Wei Sin for N6 dated 2 August 1999 (but this is at BAEIC 511) referring to Clause 13.\n\nFurthermore, the contents of Wei Sin’s fax dated 16 August 1999 and 18 August 1999\n\nand HEP’s fax dated 10 September 1999, which I have referred to above, apply both to\n\nN2 and to N6.243.        Accordingly, the views I have expressed\n\non the letter dated 2 August 1999, and the faxes dated 16 August, 18 August and 10\n\nSeptember 1999 also apply in the context of N6.244.        The correspondence and faxes between Wei\n\nSin and AL for N6 between 2 August 1999 and 10 September 1999 which I have not\n\nspecifically identified in my judgment but which I have read, do not alter the views I\n\nhave expressed on the material letter and faxes identified above.245.        Accordingly, I find that the purported\n\ntermination notice by HEP pursuant to Clause 7 in the context of N6 was also not valid.246.        Again, Wei Sin has not pleaded or\n\nalleged AL’s conduct or the fax demand dated 4 September 1999 from B T Tan & Co\n\nas constituting a repudiatory breach of the sub-contract for N6 and I need not consider\n\nthis point any further.247.        My views in paras 186 to 195 on the fax\n\ndated 10 September 1999 from B T Tan & Co and the law on delay in payment as a\n\nrepudiatory breach also apply to N6.248.        However the question is still whether\n\nthe conduct of Wei Sin regarding the progress claims for N6 was also repudiatory in\n\nnature.249.        On this point, I note that both AL and\n\nits solicitors often treated the sub-contracts for N2 and N6 as one, although they are\n\nseparate contracts. A repudiatory breach by Wei Sin of the sub-contract for N2 does not\n\nnecessarily mean that Wei Sin had also been guilty of a similar breach for N6.250.        As at 16 August 1999 (i.e when Wei Sin\n\nhad sent its fax to say that other sub-contractors had been engaged for some of the work\n\nand to give one week for the stainless steel work to be completed), the difference between\n\nAL’s Progress Claim Nos 1 to 3 and Wei Sin’s payment was only $8,400.251.        PW1 Mr Sim accepted that this did not\n\nevince an intention by Wei Sin not to make further payments to AL (NE 34 line 21 to 23).252.        I also recall that payment for Progress\n\nClaim No 2 for N6 was made ‘early’ although this was because of the reason I\n\nhave mentioned in para 55 above.253.        However, the position as at 4 September\n\n1999, i.e the date of the fax demand from B T Tan & Co, was quite different. By then,\n\nthe difference between the amount claimed by AL and due for payment on the one hand and\n\nthe amount paid by Wei Sin on the other hand had increased to $30,495.79 (see the\n\ntabulation in para 54 above). This was because no payment was made for Progress Claim No 4\n\nwhich was due for payment on 25 August 1999.254.        The reason given for non-payment was one\n\nof the same general reasons given for N2 i.e concern that AL’s ‘work was very\n\nslow and may delay completion of project’ (see NE 149 line 19).255.        However, again, Wei Sin did not adduce\n\nany evidence as to how much AL’s works in N6 had delayed the main contract works to\n\njustify withholding every cent from Progress Claim No 4.256.        I am of the view that the although the\n\namount that has been withheld and the frequency of delay or withholding of payment are\n\nrelevant, I should also take into account the motive or reason behind Wei Sin’s\n\nconduct in withholding payment.257.        I find that as in N2, Wei Sin was\n\ncontent to exercise its obligations for N6 in its own way substantially inconsistent with\n\nsuch obligations. Wei Sin was content not to abide by such obligations as and when they\n\nfell due if this suited its purpose. Wei Sin was in repudiatory breach.258.        As regards the question whether\n\nHEP’s invalid notice was also a repudiatory breach, my views in para 200 to 201 above\n\nalso apply to N6.Summary on termination of N6 sub-contract259.        In the circumstances, I find that Wei\n\nSin was also in repudiatory breach of contract for N6 in withholding payment of Progress\n\nClaim No 4 and also in respect of HEP’s invalid notice. The repudiation has been\n\naccepted.260.        My views in paras 203 to 223 above on a\n\ncontractor’s right to suspend work or go slow and on Mr Shetty’s other arguments\n\nalso apply for N6.Main claims by Wei Sin for N6261.        Accordingly, Wei Sin is not entitled to\n\nbe paid the additional costs in engaging other sub-contractors to complete outstanding\n\nwork of AL for N6 but is entitled, in the light of Mr Quek’s concession in para 95 of\n\nhis Closing Submission, to claim damages for engaging other sub-contractors to rectify\n\ndefects in AL’s work, subject to proof of the same.262.        As for damages for delay, Wei Sin did\n\nnot claim it is entitled to this if its termination for N6 is invalid. As its termination\n\nis not valid, it is not entitled to claim damages for delay. However, for completeness, I\n\nwill deal with this claim on the assumption that Wei Sin’s termination is valid.263.        As in N2, Clause 8 of the Standard\n\nConditions for N6 allows Wei Sin to claim liquidated damages for delay at rates which are\n\npegged to the rates payable by Wei Sin to HDB.264.        Wei Sin is claiming $2,158,650 as\n\nliquidated damages against AL for N6.265.        However, DW2 Mr Soh said that for N6,\n\nHDB had claimed about $400,000 as liquidated damages against Wei Sin. Mr Soh also admitted\n\nthat Wei Sin did not take into account the liquidated damages sought by HDB when Wei Sin\n\nclaimed liquidated damages against AL (NE 168 line 21 to 23).266.        In my view, the quantum of Wei\n\nSin’s claim of about $2.15m as liquidated damages was therefore yet another\n\nfraudulent claim by Wei Sin to put undue pressure on AL, although Wei Sin might have been\n\nable to claim a lesser sum, subject to proof, if it had validly terminated the N6\n\nsub-contract.267.        As regards any suggestion that Wei Sin\n\nmight have given up something to reduce the liquidated damages claimed by HDB in N6 and\n\nthat AL should bear what Wei Sin had to give up, this must be pleaded but was not. There\n\nwas also no evidence on it. Accordingly, AL is also not liable for such damages.AL’S CLAIMS FOR LOSS OF PROFIT (N2 AND N6)268.        As regards AL’s claims for loss of\n\nprofit for N2 and for N6, I note that inCanterbury, the New Zealand Court of\n\nAppeal decided that the contractor should not be entitled to loss of profits because it\n\nhad wrongly withheld its work even though the notice of termination from the developer was\n\ninvalid.269.        Although no authority was cited for this\n\napproach and the decision may have been because the contractor had not terminated the\n\ncontract, AL also has not established that it was entitled to go slow.270.        I am of the view that where it is\n\nfortuitous as to who first terminates the sub-contracts, a claim for loss of profit should\n\nnot be allowed.271.        Accordingly, I will disallow AL’s\n\nclaims for loss of profit for each of the sub-contracts.OTHER CLAIMSAL’s claims for retention sums (N2 and N6)272.        As for the retention sums for N2 and N6,\n\nMr Quek made a claim for them in his oral reply.273.        In view of my findings above, the\n\nquantum of the retention sums (including GST) are:(a)    For N2, 95%\n\n                = (already paid)\n\n        $ 91,705.02(to be paid)\n\n                    $292,429.88 +__________$384,134.90___________5%\n\n                       \n\n        =\n\n                                  \n\n        $ 20,217.63___________(b)    For N6, 95%\n\n                = (already paid)\n\n        $ 47,946.50(to be paid)\n\n                    $ 98,889.93 +__________$146,836.43___________5%\n\n                       \n\n        =\n\n                                   \n\n        $ 7,728.23___________274.        However, Mr Shetty has objected to the\n\nretention sums being claimed as they were not sought in the Statement of Claim or in\n\nevidence. Accordingly, I will not grant judgment in respect of these sums and AL will have\n\nto sue afresh for them if it thinks it is entitled to payment of the same.Wei Sin’s claims for fines (N2 and N6)275.        Wei Sin also claimed $10,000 and $2,000\n\nbeing fines imposed by HDB for failure of anchor bolts in pull out tests for N2 and N6\n\nrespectively. I am of the view that unless HDB has a contractual basis to impose these\n\nfines, it is not entitled to do so and correspondingly Wei Sin is not entitled to claim\n\nthem against AL. If Wei Sin is prepared not to challenge the imposition of such fines for\n\ncommercial reasons, then Wei Sin must bear such fines.276.        There was no evidence before me that HDB\n\nis contractually entitled to impose such fines. Therefore I disallow Wei Sin’s claim\n\nagainst AL for such fines.Wei Sin’s claims for re-test on anchor bolts (N2 and N6)277.        I will, however, allow Wei Sin’s\n\nclaim for cost of re-test on anchor bolts for N2 and N6 in principle since AL has accepted\n\nthat it is partially responsible for the failure of such bolts. This is subject to proof\n\nas to how much AL was to blame for the failure and the quantum of such loss.Wei Sin’s claim for mobilisation (N2)278.        Wei Sin’s claim for $60 for\n\nmobilisation of personnel and equipment on site for N2 is disallowed. It is a general\n\nclaim and there is inadequate evidence to establish that it was incurred because of AL.Wei Sin’s claim for administrative charge (N6)279.        Wei Sin’s claim for $2,000 as\n\nadministrative charge imposed by HDB for non-compliance of Sunbreaker dimension in N6 is\n\nalso disallowed. There was no evidence before me that HDB was contractually entitled to\n\nimpose such a charge.OVERALL SUMMARY280.        I make the following orders:For N2(1)     Wei Sin is to pay AL $292,429.88 (under\n\n    para 130 above) for N2 forthwith with interest thereon at 6% per annum from the date of\n\n    the Writ of Summons to the date of payment.(2)     AL’s claim for damages in the form of\n\n    loss of profit is dismissed.(3)     AL is to pay Wei Sin damages to be assessed\n\n    by a person to be determined by the court for (a) the rectification of AL’s defective\n\n    work and (b) the cost of re-test of anchor bolts in N2.(4)     The rest of Wei Sin’s counterclaim is\n\n    dismissed.For N6(5)     Wei Sin is to pay AL $98,889.93 (under para\n\n    141 above) for N6 forthwith with interest thereon at 6% per annum from the date of the\n\n    Writ of Summons to the date of payment.(6)     AL’s claim for damages in the form of\n\n    loss of profit is dismissed.(7)     AL is to pay Wei Sin damages to be assessed\n\n    by a person to be determined by the court for (a)     the\n\n    rectification of AL’s defective works and (b) the cost of re-test of anchor bolts in\n\n    N6.(8)     The rest of Wei Sin’s counterclaim is\n\n    dismissed.281.        I will hear the parties\n\non (a) the person who should assess the damages and (b) costs of the action.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
