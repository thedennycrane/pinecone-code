        "Facts": "4       The facts of this case are not in dispute. The\n                    Deceased was employed as a general manager by the 1st Respondent since\n                    2 January 1987. As a general manager, he reported directly to the managing\n                    director of the company, one Mr Ong Ban Leong (“Ong”). The\n                    Deceased was required in the course of his employment to work outside Singapore\n                    periodically. Ong confirmed that he had travelled many times with the Deceased\n                    on business trips. 5       Ong gave evidence that the Deceased’s\n                    travelling itinerary for this particular trip included travelling to Phnom Penh,\n                    Bangkok, Hanoi and Ho Chih Minh City. Phnom Penh, Cambodia was the first stop of\n                    the business trip which was scheduled to last from 31 August 2008 to\n                    5 September 2008. The Deceased was in Phnom Penh to attend, among other\n                    things, an anniversary dinner of Khmer Electrical Power (“KEP”) on\n                    31 August 2008 (as representative of the 1st Respondent) and more\n                    importantly, a meeting on 1 September 2008 to discuss a debt owed by KEP to\n                    the 1st Respondent. Upon arrival in Phnom Penh on 31 August 2008, the\n                    Deceased was met by the 1st Respondent’s representative in Cambodia,\n                    Mr Jonathan Lim Balayan (“Lim”). Lim and the Deceased parted\n                    ways at the airport, agreeing to meet at the anniversary dinner later that\n                    evening. From the airport, the Deceased drove a company car (owned by the 1st\n                    Respondent) to Phnom Penh Hotel. 6       At the anniversary dinner, Lim suggested that\n                    the Deceased meet with Cambodia Brewery Ltd (“CBL”) as it could be\n                    a potential client of the 1st Respondent. The Deceased agreed to meet CBL the\n                    next day before the scheduled meeting with KEP at 11am. Lim arranged to pick up\n                    the Deceased from Phnom Penh Hotel at 9am the next morning for the meeting with\n                    CBL. The hotel’s Surveillance Department’s report showed that the\n                    Deceased returned to his room alone at 1.31am on 1 September 2008 and that\n                    no one else entered the room from then until 10.58am. 7       On the morning of 1 September 2008, Lim was\n                    in office completing a report for his superior. As a result, Lim was late in\n                    leaving his office to pick up the Deceased from Phnom Penh Hotel. At about\n                    9.45am, after Lim had left his office, he received a call from the Deceased but\n                    hung up on the call as he did not hear any voice on the line. At about 10.20am,\n                    when Lim was already driving towards Phnom Penh Hotel, he received another call\n                    from the Deceased asking for medical assistance as the Deceased was having\n                    difficulty breathing. Sometime between 10.30am and 10.45am, Lim reached Phnom\n                    Penh Hotel and subsequently managed to open the Deceased’s room door with\n                    the assistance of the hotel staff. Upon entry into the room, the Deceased was\n                    found dead. He was clad in shorts and an undershirt with his upper body on the\n                    bed and his legs on the floor at the end of the bed. A pair of trousers was hung\n                    on the chair next to a table. A laptop was found on that table, although Lim\n                    could not confirm whether the laptop was turned on at that time. Lim also\n                    testified that there were no personal items around the room and suggested that\n                    it appeared as if the Deceased was ready to check out of the room.",
        "The Commissioner’s findings": "8       After hearing the evidence adduced at the\n                    hearing, the Commissioner found that the Deceased’s death did not arise\n                    out of and in the course of his employment with the 1st Respondent.[note: 1]According to the\n                    Commissioner, there was no evidence that the Deceased was involved in any work\n                    prior to his death.[note: 2]The Commissioner took into\n                    consideration the following: (a)No work-related emails were received that\n                                morning;[note: 3](b)Although the Deceased had made phone calls\n                            requesting medical assistance, these phone calls did not seem to arise\n                            out of any work related to any of the meetings that the Deceased was to\n                            attend that morning;[note: 4](c)There was no evidence on any presentation or\n                            preliminary discussion with regard to the intended meeting with the\n                            potential client, CBL;[note: 5]and(d)If the Deceased had been working, he would\n                            probably have prepared the documents necessary for discussion with KEP.\n                            The fact that there was no evidence of any of these documents present\n                            when the Deceased was found in the hotel room suggested that he had not\n                            been working at the material time.[note: 6]9       Based on the above evidence, the Commissioner\n                    held that the Deceased was merely waiting for Lim to pick him up for the\n                    meetings with CBL and KEP.[note: 7]The Commissioner was\n                    accordingly of the view that the Deceased was in a position similar to someone\n                    waiting at home for transport to arrive to bring him to office.[note: 8]The Commissioner held that\n                    this wasnotto be considered as being in the\n                    course of employment, referring to the decision of Lai Siu Chiu JC inQBE Insurance (International) Ltd v Julaiha Bee Bee and\n                        others[1992] 1 SLR 406 (“QBE\n                        Insurance”) at [23]:The paramount rule is that an employee travelling on the highway will be\n                        acting in the course of his employment if, and only if, he is at the\n                        material time going about his employer’s business.One must not confuse the duty to turn up for one’s work with the\n                            concept of already being ‘on duty’ while travelling to\n                            it. [emphasis added]10     The Commissioner also pointed out that inMa Kit Ching Veronica v Attorney General[1983] 1 HKC 470, Deputy Judge Grindey held that an employee cannot\n                    claim compensation if at the time of the accident he had finished his duty for\n                    the day, in other words, when he had “clocked off”.[note: 9]In the Commissioner’s\n                    view, the Deceased would have “clocked on” only when he was\n                    present at a work-related meeting, not when he was waiting for transport\n                        (ieLim) to arrive.[note: 10]11     The Commissioner further considered the\n                    presumption provided in s 3(6) of the WICA and found that it was not\n                    applicable and therefore the burden of the Appellant to prove the claim did not\n                    shift to the 2nd Respondent.[note: 11]Section 3(6) provides:For the purposes of this Act, an accident arising in the course of an\n                        employee’s employment shall be deemed, in the absence of evidence to\n                        the contrary, to have arisen out of that employment.In the Commissioner’s view, s 3(6) may only be invoked\n                    where it is certain that the accident occurredin the course\n                        of employment, but it was uncertain as to whether theaccident arose out of that employmentin this\n                        case.[note: 12]In a case where there was\n                    uncertainty as to whether the accident even occurred in the course of employment\n                    in the first place, s 3(6) of the WICA would not apply.[note: 13]In making this decision, the\n                    Commissioner relied on the decision of Kan Ting Chiu J inKaruppiah Ravichandran v GDS Engineering Pte Ltd and\n                        another[2009] 3 SLR(R) 1028 (“Karuppiah”) at [24]:The presumption in s 3(6) does not arise whenever a worker is injured\n                        in an accident. It applies to accidents arising in the course of his\n                        employment. When the Commissioner found that the accident did not arise in\n                        the course of the applicant’s employment, the presumption in\n                        s 3(6) did not apply.On the facts as found by the Commissioner, the Commissioner held that\n                    the presumption in s 3(6) did not arise because the accident could not be\n                    said to have arisen in the course of the Deceased’s\n                employment.Issues before this court12     An employer’s liability for compensation\n                    is imposed by s 3(1) of the WICA, which reads:Employer’s liability for\n                            compensation3. —(1) If in any employmentpersonal\n                            injurybyaccident arising out of and in\n                            the course of the employmentis caused to an employee, his\n                        employer shall be liable to pay compensation in accordance with the\n                        provisions of this Act.…[emphasis added]By virtue of s 2(4), the WICA applies to an accident happening to\n                    an employee outside Singapore where the employee is ordinarily resident in\n                    Singapore and is employed by an employer in Singapore but is required in the\n                    course of his employment to work outside Singapore.13     Under s 3(1), an employee has to prove\n                    three elements before establishing an employer’s liability for\n                    compensation: (a) the employee sufferedpersonal\n                        injury; (b) the injury was caused by anaccident; and (c) the accident arose out of and in thecourse of his employment(Allianz\n                        Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte and others v Ma Shoudong and another[2011] SGHC 106 (“Allianz\n                        Insurance”) at [11], citingNTUC Income Insurance\n                        Co-operative Ltd and another v Next of kin of Narayasamy s/o Ramasamy,\n                        deceased[2006] 4 SLR(R) 507 (“Narayasamy”) at [20]).14     The first element (“personal\n                    injury”) was not disputed by the parties, since the personal injury\n                    suffered by the Deceased was his death. The latter two elements\n                    (“accident” and “course of… employment”)\n                    reflect the two main issues on appeal before this court:(a)Whether there was an “accident” for\n                            the purposes of s 3(1) of the WICA; and(b)Whether the accident arose out of and in the\n                            course of employment for the purposes of s 3(1) of the\n                        WICA.15     Before turning to address the issues proper,\n                    however, it is prudent to first address the preliminary point on whether the\n                    Appellant has a right to appeal to the High Court on the two main\n                issues.Preliminary issue: appeals from the Commissioner16     An appeal to the High Court from a decision of\n                    the Commissioner made under the WICA is possible only where a\n                    “substantial question of law is involved in the appeal” and\n                    “the amount in dispute is not less than $1,000” (s 29(2A) of\n                    the WICA). Section 29 of the WICA is reproduced here for\n                    convenience:Appeal from decision of\n                            Commissioner29. —(1) Subject to section 24(3B), any person aggrieved by any\n                        order of the Commissioner made under this Act may appeal to the High Court\n                        whose decision shall be final.(2) Subject to the Rules of Court, the procedure in an appeal to the High\n                        Court shall be the procedure in a civil appeal from a District Court with\n                        such modifications as the circumstances may require.(2A) No appeal shall lie against any order unless asubstantial question of lawis involved in the appeal and\n                        theamount in dispute is not less than\n                        $1,000.(3) Notwithstanding any appeal under this section, the employer shall\n                        deposit with the Commissioner the amount of compensation ordered by the\n                        Commissioner under section 25B, 25C or 25D within 21 days from the date of\n                        the Commissioner’s decision, and the deposit shall be held by the\n                        Commissioner pending the outcome of the appeal.[emphasis added]17     The parties in the present case did not raise\n                    any issues regarding s 29(2A), implying that they agreed that substantial\n                    questions of law were involved in the present appeal. Nonetheless, for\n                    completeness, I turn to make some brief observations on the right of appeal to\n                    the High Court from a decision of the Commissioner and to assess whether there\n                    were indeed substantial questions of law raised in the present\n                appeal.18     Several precedent decisions of this court have\n                    elaborated on the requirement of a “substantive question of law”\n                    in s 29(2A). Section 29(2A) reflects the policy that decisions of the\n                    Commissioner are not to be examined as though they are decisions of a court of\n                    law (Karuppiahat [9]), as evinced through Parliamentary debates which state the\n                    intention of the WICA is to provide “a simpler and quicker way to settle\n                    compensation claims by avoiding protracted legal proceedings” (Allianz Insuranceat [20]).19     It should be noted that the “question\n                    of law” test for appeals from decisions of statutory tribunals (such as\n                    the Commissioner in the present case) is different from that for appeals from\n                    arbitrators, since as a matter of policy, there must be a greater degree of\n                    judicial supervision over the former (Ng Swee Lang v Sassoon\n                        Samuel Bernard[2008] 1 SLR(R) 522 (“Ng Swee Lang”) at [24] and [25],Karuppiahat [14] andSelvam Raju v Camelron General\n                        Contractors and another[2010] 2 SLR 1113\n                        (“Selvam Raju”) at [7]). In determining the range of errors of law\n                    that may provide grounds for appeal under s 29(2A), the courts have\n                    accepted the full range of errors of law listed inHalsbury’s Laws of Englandvol 1(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed\n                    Reissue, 1989) at paragraph 70:... misinterpretation of a statute or any other legal document or a rule\n                        of common law; asking oneself and answering the wrong question, taking\n                        irrelevant considerations into account or failing to take relevant\n                        considerations into account when purporting to apply the law to the facts;\n                        admitting inadmissible evidence or rejecting admissible and relevant\n                        evidence; exercising a discretion on the basis of incorrect legal\n                        principles; giving reasons which disclose faulty legal reasoning or which\n                        are inadequate to fulfil an express duty to give reasons, and misdirecting\n                        oneself as to the burden of proof.20     In addition, the courts have accepted Lord\n                    Radcliffe’s statement inEdwards (Inspector of Taxes) v\n                        Bairstow[1956] AC 14 at 36 that a factual finding\n                    which was such that “no person acting judicially and properly instructed\n                    as to the relevant law could have come to the determination upon appeal”\n                    amounted to a misconception or error in point of law (Karuppiahat [13],Selvam Rajuat [7]). However, not every wrong finding of fact would amount to a\n                    substantial question of law. In the final analysis, the nature and effect of the\n                    error will be considered and such errors must have a bearing on the ultimate\n                    decision (Karuppiahat [15]).21     Turning to the two main issues on appeal in\n                    the present case (see above at[14]), it is\n                    clear that both involve “substantial questions of law” as defined\n                    in[19]and[20]above. Both issues involve statutory interpretation of\n                    s 3(1) of the WICA (especially the terms “accident” and\n                    “course of employment”). They also deal with inferences drawn by\n                    the Commissioner from the facts that the Commissioner had found. While the court\n                    will not generally disturb findings of facts unless they are such that\n                    “no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant\n                    law could have come to the determination upon appeal” (Karuppiahat [13]),\n                    there is no similar rule precluding courts from assessing the robustness of\n                    inferences drawn from the facts as found by the Commissioner.22     Having stated that this is a case where the\n                    issues raised are appealable to the High Court, I turn now to address the two\n                    issues involved in this appeal.Whether there was an “accident” for the purposes of\n                s 3(1)23     On the issue of whether there was an\n                    “accident” for the purposes of s 3(1), it is apposite to\n                    refer toNarayasamy, where Menon JC\n                    interpreted the meaning of “accident” by drawing from the House of\n                    Lords’ interpretation of the equivalent English statute (which isin pari materiawith s 3(1) of the WICA).\n                    The relevant passages fromNarayasamyare\n                    reproduced here:23 Lord Loreburn LC, speaking in the majority, first\n                        considered whether this could be described as an accident and held that it\n                        could following the decision of the House of Lords inFenton v Thorley & Co\n                        Ltd[1903] AC 443. His Lordship noted as follows\n                        at 245-246:The first question here is whether or not the learned judge was\n                            entitled to regard the rupture as an \"accident\" within the meaning of\n                            this Act. In my opinion, he was so entitled. Certainly it was an\n                            \"untoward event.\" It was not designed. It was unexpected in what seems\n                            to me the relevant sense, namely, that a sensible man who knew the\n                            nature of the work would not have expected it. I cannot agree with the\n                            argument presented to your Lordships that you are to ask whether a\n                            doctor acquainted with the man's condition would have expected it. Were\n                            that the right view, then it would not be an accident if a man very\n                            liable to fainting fits fell in a faint from a ladder and hurt himself.\n                            No doubt the ordinary accident is associated with something external;\n                            the bursting of a boiler, or an explosion in a mine, for example. But it\n                            may be merely from the main's own miscalculation, such as tripping and\n                            falling. Or it may be due both to internal and external conditions, as\n                            if a seaman were to faint in the rigging and tumble into the sea. I\n                            think it may also be something going wrong within the human frame\n                            itself, such as the straining of a muscle or the breaking of a blood\n                            vessel. If that occurred when he was lifting a weight it would be\n                            properly described as an accident. So, I think, rupturing an aneurism\n                            when tightening a nut with a spanner may be regarded as an\n                            accident.24 It is thus apparent that an \"accident\" within the meaning of the\n                        English statute (which is inpari materiawith\n                        s 3(1) of the Act)would include an internal\n                            medical condition that caused an unexpected injury while the workman was\n                            carrying out his work.[emphasis added in bold italics]24     The parties agreed on the interpretation of\n                    “accident” as adopted inNarayasamy,viz, that it would “include an internal\n                    medical condition that caused an unexpected injury while the workman was\n                    carrying out his work”. The parties agreed that the Deceased had died\n                    from circumstances that resembled a cardiac arrest and further agreed that if\n                    the death wasindeedcaused by cardiac arrest, it\n                    would be considered, on the authority ofNarayasamy, to be caused by an “accident” within\n                    the meaning of s 3(1). The only dispute concerning the requirement of an\n                    “accident” stemmed from the 2nd Respondent’s argument that\n                    since theprecise cause of deathwas not proved by\n                    the Appellant, it could not be said that the Deceased’s death had been\n                    caused by an “accident”.25     Considering the circumstantial evidence that\n                    is available, namely, the phone calls made by the Deceased and, in particular, a\n                    phone call seeking medical assistance for breathing difficulties (see[7]above), I am of the view that the death was, on\n                    a balance of probabilities, caused by cardiac arrest. Accordingly, I find that\n                    the Deceased’s death was caused by an “accident” within the\n                    meaning of s 3(1).26     At this juncture, I pause to record several\n                    observations on the use of the term “accident” in s 3(1). The\n                    word “accident” is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary to\n                    mean “anunfortunate incidentthat happensunexpectedlyandunintentionally, typically resulting in damage or injury”\n                    (emphasis added).[note: 14]This definition would, at\n                    least on a literal reading, allow the word “accident” to include\n                    – as the court inNarayasamyheld – an\n                    internal medical condition that caused an unexpected injury while the workman\n                    was carrying out his work”. It could of course be argued that it is not\n                    in line with the common understanding of the word “accident” to\n                    include something which happens as a result of a person’s “internal\n                    medical condition”. Some may accordingly viewNarayasamyas providing an overly broad interpretation of\n                    “accident”.27     I sympathise with those who think that the\n                    word “accident” had been stretched beyond its common usage inNarayasamy. Nonetheless, in my view, the\n                    liberal interpretation of “accident” adopted inNarayasamyis justified. It is clear that s 9A of the\n                    Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) enjoins courts to prefer an\n                    interpretation that would promote the purpose underlying any particular\n                    legislation. The WICA describes itself as being “[a]n Act relating to the\n                    payment of compensation to employees for injury suffered in the course of their\n                    employment”. Being a piece of social legislation, the WICA should be\n                    interpreted purposively in favour of employees who have suffered injury during\n                    their employment. TheNarayasamyinterpretation is\n                    therefore entirely in line with the purpose of the WICA.28     An interesting point to note is the\n                    relationship between ss 3(1) and 3(5) of the WICA, stemming from the use of\n                    the word “accident” in the former. Section 3(1) has been set\n                    out at[12]above. Section 3(5) of the\n                    WICA provides:(5) An employer shall not be liable to pay compensation in\n                        respect of —(a) any injury to an employee resulting from an accident if it is\n                            proved that the injury to the employee is directly attributable to the\n                            employee having been at the time thereof under the influence of alcohol\n                            or a drug not prescribed by a medical practitioner; or(b) any incapacity or death resulting from a deliberate self-injury or\n                            the deliberate aggravation of an accidental injury.29     To recap, s 3(1) is the gateway to\n                    liability under s 3 of the WICA; the three elements of s 3(1), the\n                    second of which being that the injury must have been caused by an\n                    “accident”, must be fulfilled before an employer is liable to pay\n                    compensation to an employee. However, s 3(5)(b) excludes an\n                    employer’s liability for “any incapacity or death resulting from adeliberate self-injury…”\n                    (emphasis added). It is difficult to see how a particular claim could pass\n                    through the s 3(1) gateway but subsequently be excluded by virtue of\n                    s 3(5)(b), since a “deliberate self-injury” could hardly be\n                    considered an “accident” in the first place. Of course, one way to\n                    rationalise the provisions is to interpret the “deliberate\n                    self-injury” component of s 3(5)(b) as dealing with a class of cases\n                    that does not fall within s 3(1) in the first place but if that were the\n                    case, then s 3(5)(b) would not be necessary since there is no liability\n                    apart from s 3(1). An “accident” which is proved to have been\n                    faked or planned would be no accident at all.30     The situation in relation to ss 3(1) and\n                    3(5) may be avoided if the term “accident” (which already connotes\n                    something unintentional) is replaced by a more general term, for instance,\n                    “incident” (which is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary to\n                    mean “an instance of something happening; an event or\n                        occurrence”).[note: 15]The “deliberate\n                    self-injury” (referred to in s 3(5)(b)) would be an\n                    “incident” although it is not an\n                “accident”.31     In addition, replacing the word\n                    “accident” in the WICA with “incident” (or some\n                    other suitable term) would, I think, be more palatable to linguistic purists who\n                    may object quite legitimately to describing someone who suffered a heart attack\n                    as having had an “accident”. It would obviate the need for an\n                    expansive or over liberal meaning to be given to the word\n                    “accident”.Whether the accident arose out of and in the “course of the\n                employment”32     The next issue (which is also the main issue\n                    in dispute in the present case) is whether the accident arose in the\n                    “course of the employment”. This is a requirement to be met before\n                    liability can be established under s 3(1) of the WICA. The parties agreed\n                    that if the accident was found to have arisen in the “course of\n                    employment”, then it would, pursuant to s 3(6) of the WICA, be\n                    deemed to have arisen out of that employment. To repeat, s 3(6)\n                    provides:For the purposes of this Act, an accident arising in the course of an\n                        employee’s employment shall be deemed, in the absence of evidence to\n                        the contrary, to have arisen out of that employment.In other words, the parties are agreed that all that is required in\n                    the present case is to determine whether the accident arose in the\n                    “course of employment” since there is no contradicting\n                    evidence.33     As noted at[9]above, the Commissioner relied on the case ofQBE Insurancein determining that the Deceased, while\n                    waiting for Lim’s transport, was not in the course of employment. The\n                    House of Lords’ decision inCharles R Davidson and\n                        Company v M’Robb or Officer[1918] AC 304\n                        (“Davidson”) is instructive and\n                    it is apposite to reproduce extracts of the judgments of three of the learned\n                    Law Lords in that case. I begin with the dissenting opinion of Lord\n                    Finlay LC (at 314-315):“In the course of the employment” must mean, similarly, in\n                        thecourse of the work which the man is employed to do,\n                            and what is incident to it– in other words, in the\n                        course of his service. In the case of a domestic servant who sleeps and\n                        takes his meals in his master’s house he is in the course of his\n                        service all the time – his service is interrupted if he goes out on\n                        his own business or pleasure. A workman who by the terms of his employment\n                        takes his meals on his employer’s premises is in the course of his\n                        service in being there at meal-times. In either case the master or employer\n                        would be liable for damage caused by such an accident……“In the course of the employment” does\n                            not mean during the currency of the time of the engagement.\n                        If the words meant this they would be useless, and would add nothing to the\n                        words “arising out of the employment,” while to interpret them\n                        in this sense would let in the possibility of a number of claims of the\n                        nature above indicated which the words “in the course of the\n                        employment” rightly read as meaning in the course of the work or\n                        service would exclude. If “in the course of the employment”\n                        meant during the currency of the engagement a sailor engaged for a round\n                        voyage would be in the course of his employment while in a public-house in\n                        any port where he had leave to go on shore.“Course” is more applicable to work or service than to\n                            the currency of the engagement. Leave on shore on the sailor’s own\n                            business or pleasure is an interruption of his employment, not in the\n                            course of it.[emphasis added]Lord Dunedin noted (at 321) that:… In my view “in the course of employment” is a\n                        different thing from “during the period of employment.” It\n                        connotes, to my mind, the idea that the workman or servant is doing\n                        something which is part of his service to his employer or master.No doubt it need not be actual work, but it must, I think, be\n                            work, or the natural incidents connected with the class of\n                            work– e.g., in the workman’s case the taking of\n                        meals during the hours of labour; in the servant’s, not only the\n                        taking of meals, butresting and sleeping,\n                        which follow from the fact that domestic servants generally live and sleep\n                        under the master’s roof. … [emphasis added]Lord Atkinson provided further guidance on determining whether an\n                    employee was “in the course of employment” at the material time\n                    (at 327):… The words “in course of his employment” mean, I\n                        think, while the workman is doing something he is employed to do. In the\n                        case of a sailor who lives on board his ship, or an indoor servant who lives\n                        in his master’s house, these words would of course cover and include\n                        thingsnecessarily incidental to his service there\n                            – such as taking his meals, sleeping, resting, &c.\n                        In satisfying these demands of nature the sailor is as truly doing something\n                        within the course of his employment as he would be in keeping a look-out or\n                        going aloft. … [emphasis added]34     It should be noted that inAllianz Insurance, Lai JC cited Lord\n                    Findlay LC’s dicta inDavidsonwith\n                    approval and went on to find that the deceased inAllianz\n                        Insurancewas within the course of his employment despite being\n                    on a break after his shift had ended and despite there being no evidence that he\n                    was actually doing work at the time of death. The present case is concerned with\n                    a situation in which an employee is sent overseas on a business trip.\n                    Accordingly, I limit my observations to the context of employees going on\n                    overseas working trips. One possible interpretation is that an employee on an\n                    overseas working trip is considered to be in the “course of\n                    employment” for theentire periodthat he\n                    is overseas. Another possible interpretation is that the employee is considered\n                    to be in the “course of employment” only during the time that he\n                    is actively at work, and not, for instance, when he is having meals or sleeping.\n                    To my mind, however, both interpretations are extreme and cannot represent the\n                    law with regard to the “course of employment” under s 3(1) of\n                    the WICA. The former interpretation is clearly too broad. It would, for\n                    instance, render an employer liable for an employee’s injury where the\n                    employee chooses to do extreme sports on a free day between business meetings.\n                    Such an action by the employee would, to borrow Lord Finlay LC’s words, be\n                    “aninterruptionof his employment, not in\n                    the course of it” (emphasis added). In contrast, the latter\n                    interpretation is clearly too narrow. It would, for instance, render an employee\n                    without compensation simply because he had been taking a breather from work when\n                    tragedy struck. Such an interpretation would starkly contradict the opinions of\n                    Lords Dunedin and Atkinson, that “natural [or necessary]\n                    incidents” connected to work would fall within the course of employment\n                    as well.35     In my opinion, the proper approach to take\n                    falls somewhere between the extreme approaches outlined in the preceding\n                    paragraph. Some examples will be useful to illustrate the necessity of a\n                    fact-sensitive approach in determining whether an employee was in the\n                    “course of employment” at the material time. In some cases, it is\n                    reasonably clear that the employee is not in the course of employment when he\n                    suffered the injury. For instance, if an employee travels on a working trip to\n                    London and thereafter heads to Paris for a vacation before returning, any injury\n                    occasioned during the period of time when he is in Paris would not be in the\n                    course of employment – his presence in Paris cannot generally be said to\n                    beincidentalto his work. There are, however,\n                    situations which are less clear. Take the example of an employee who travels for\n                    a working trip that involves numerous meetings and little time for leisure\n                    activities;prima facie, the entire trip would be\n                    considered to be in the course of employment, since his presence overseas may be\n                    said to be “necessarily incidental” to his work. However, if the\n                    employee chooses to go bungee jumping during a period of free time between\n                    meetings and injures himself in the process, this would probably not be\n                    sufficientlyincidentalto the course of work and\n                    accordingly constitutes a “frolic of the employee’s own”, a\n                    “deviation” from or an “interruption” to the course\n                    of employment. On the other hand, if there was evidence that the employee had\n                    gone bungee jumping for the purposes of building business relations with a\n                    particular client, then it could conceivably be argued that the injury from\n                    bungee jumping was caused in the course of employment.36     The process of determining whether an employee\n                    was, at the material time of suffering injury, in the “course of\n                    employment”, is ahighly factual inquiry.\n                    An analogy may be made with tort cases relating to whether an employer is\n                    vicariously liable for acts done by an employee in the course of employment.\n                    From those cases, it is clear that whether a detour by an employee is a\n                    “frolic of his own” or is conversely in the course of employment,\n                    is a matter of fact and degree (seeeg Joel v\n                        Morison(1834) 6 C&P 501,Whatman v Pearson(1868) LR 3 CP 422 andStorey v Ashton(1869)\n                    LR 4 QB 476). In my view, the factual nature of the test applies\n                    equally in the context of determining whether, for purposes of work injury\n                    compensation, the employee concerned was “in the course of\n                    employment” when injury was suffered. It is neither helpful nor\n                    appropriate for courts to attempt to phrase a precise legal test to govern all\n                    situations, given that the question whether an employee was in the\n                    “course of employment” is essentially a fact-specific inquiry.\n                    Indeed, this brings to mind a recent exhortation of the Court of Appeal inShadrake Alan v PP[2011] SGCA 26 at[29], albeit in a very different\n                    context, that “seeking to elaborate upon a legal test whose efficacy is\n                    to be demonstrated more in itsapplicationrather\n                    than its theoretical elaboration is, with respect, perhaps an approach that\n                    should be avoided” (emphasis in original).37     I would specifically mention one consideration\n                    to be taken into account when determining whether, as a matter of fact, the\n                    employee was in the “course of employment” at the material time. I\n                    have earlier (at[27]above) alluded to the\n                    fact that the WICA is social legislation which should be interpreted purposively\n                    in favour of employees who have suffered injury during their employment. The\n                    WICA must continue to be relevant to the realities of contemporary working\n                    environments and conditions. Increasingly, work is no longer confined to\n                    specific places and times, especially for white-collar employees (such as the\n                    Deceased). Accordingly, the concept of being in the “course of\n                    employment” must accommodate and reflect these changes in modern working\n                    life.38     Returning to the facts of the present case, it\n                    should be noted that it was undisputed that theentire trip\n                        was a working trip. No leisure activities were planned. Indeed,\n                    on the very day that the Deceased landed in Phnom Penh, he attended KEP’s\n                    anniversary dinner as a representative of the 1st Respondent. The next morning,\n                    he was going to meet with CBL for business matters and thereafter with KEP for\n                    an important meeting to resolve financial issues. The very afternoon after the\n                    meeting with KEP, the Deceased was scheduled to fly to Bangkok for further\n                    work-related purposes. There was no “interruption” whatsoever that\n                    brings the case outside theprima facieposition\n                    that the Deceased was in the “course of employment” at the\n                    material time. Indeed, the Deceased’s being in his hotel room on the\n                    fateful morning wasnecessarily incidentalto his\n                    work for the 1stRespondent.39     Even if leisure activities were included as\n                    part of the programme, so long as they were sanctioned by the employer, they\n                    would not amount to a break in employment. This accords with present day working\n                    life where leisure, team-building and morale-boosting activities are part and\n                    parcel of employment.40     I accept the Commissioner’s findings\n                    that there was no evidence of work-related emails or that the Deceased had\n                    prepared the documents necessary for discussion with KEP when he was found at\n                    11am that fateful morning. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the fact that\n                    there was noactual workat that point in time\n                    does not mean that the Deceased could not be considered to have been in the\n                    course of employment (see the judgments of Lords Dunedin and Atkinson inDavidson, reproduced at[33]above). Indeed, I note that the\n                    Deceased’s employers fully recognised and accepted that the Deceased died\n                    in the course of employment. Ong gave uncontroverted evidence that the Deceased\n                    was “a very disciplined and professional man” and that from his\n                    experience of working with the Deceased for over 20 years, including travelling\n                    with him on several business trips, he was certain that the Deceased would have\n                    spent the morning of 1 September 2010 preparing himself for the meeting\n                    with KEP. That is something entirely reasonable in the circumstances of this\n                    case and perhaps in most cases of overseas work trips as well, especially those\n                    with a demanding schedule.41     In the circumstances, I find that the Deceased\n                    suffered what appeared highly likely to be a cardiac arrest in the\n                    “course of employment”. By virtue of s 3(6), the accident\n                    would be deemed to have arisen out of the Deceased’s employment (see[32]above).Conclusion42     For the reasons given above, I find that the\n                    requirements under s 3(1) of the WICA were made out and the\n                    employer’s liability was established. The application for the\n                    Commissioner’s decision to be reversed is therefore granted. Costs are\n                    awarded to the Applicant to be taxed or agreed between the\n                parties.[note: 1]Phang Chiew Kim (NOK of Poon Wai Tong) v\n                                    Wartsila Singapore Pte Ltd and India International Insurance Pte\n                                    Ltd, Case No 0820791E, Grounds of Decision of\n                                Assistant Commissioner (Work Injury Compensation) Jimmy Khoo Lian\n                                Wai (“GD”) at [5].[note: 2]GD at [11]-[24][note: 3]GD at [25][note: 4]GD at\n                                            [25][note: 5]GD at\n                                            [25][note: 6]GD at\n                                            [28][note: 7]GD at [28][note: 8]GD at [28][note: 9]GD at [29][note: 10]GD at [29][note: 11]GD at\n                                    [5][note: 12]GD at [5][note: 13]GD at [5][note: 14]Oxford Dictionaries.

        "Issues before this court": "12     An employer’s liability for compensation\n                    is imposed by s 3(1) of the WICA, which reads: Employer’s liability for\n                            compensation 3. —(1) If in any employmentpersonal\n                            injurybyaccident arising out of and in\n                            the course of the employmentis caused to an employee, his\n                        employer shall be liable to pay compensation in accordance with the\n                        provisions of this Act. … [emphasis added] By virtue of s 2(4), the WICA applies to an accident happening to\n                    an employee outside Singapore where the employee is ordinarily resident in\n                    Singapore and is employed by an employer in Singapore but is required in the\n                    course of his employment to work outside Singapore. 13     Under s 3(1), an employee has to prove\n                    three elements before establishing an employer’s liability for\n                    compensation: (a) the employee sufferedpersonal\n                        injury; (b) the injury was caused by anaccident; and (c) the accident arose out of and in thecourse of his employment(Allianz\n                        Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte and others v Ma Shoudong and another[2011] SGHC 106 (“Allianz\n                        Insurance”) at [11], citingNTUC Income Insurance\n                        Co-operative Ltd and another v Next of kin of Narayasamy s/o Ramasamy,\n                        deceased[2006] 4 SLR(R) 507 (“Narayasamy”) at [20]). 14     The first element (“personal\n                    injury”) was not disputed by the parties, since the personal injury\n                    suffered by the Deceased was his death. The latter two elements\n                    (“accident” and “course of… employment”)\n                    reflect the two main issues on appeal before this court: (a)Whether there was an “accident” for\n                            the purposes of s 3(1) of the WICA; and(b)Whether the accident arose out of and in the\n                            course of employment for the purposes of s 3(1) of the\n                        WICA.15     Before turning to address the issues proper,\n                    however, it is prudent to first address the preliminary point on whether the\n                    Appellant has a right to appeal to the High Court on the two main\n                issues.Preliminary issue: appeals from the Commissioner16     An appeal to the High Court from a decision of\n                    the Commissioner made under the WICA is possible only where a\n                    “substantial question of law is involved in the appeal” and\n                    “the amount in dispute is not less than $1,000” (s 29(2A) of\n                    the WICA). Section 29 of the WICA is reproduced here for\n                    convenience:Appeal from decision of\n                            Commissioner29. —(1) Subject to section 24(3B), any person aggrieved by any\n                        order of the Commissioner made under this Act may appeal to the High Court\n                        whose decision shall be final.(2) Subject to the Rules of Court, the procedure in an appeal to the High\n                        Court shall be the procedure in a civil appeal from a District Court with\n                        such modifications as the circumstances may require.(2A) No appeal shall lie against any order unless asubstantial question of lawis involved in the appeal and\n                        theamount in dispute is not less than\n                        $1,000.(3) Notwithstanding any appeal under this section, the employer shall\n                        deposit with the Commissioner the amount of compensation ordered by the\n                        Commissioner under section 25B, 25C or 25D within 21 days from the date of\n                        the Commissioner’s decision, and the deposit shall be held by the\n                        Commissioner pending the outcome of the appeal.[emphasis added]17     The parties in the present case did not raise\n                    any issues regarding s 29(2A), implying that they agreed that substantial\n                    questions of law were involved in the present appeal. Nonetheless, for\n                    completeness, I turn to make some brief observations on the right of appeal to\n                    the High Court from a decision of the Commissioner and to assess whether there\n                    were indeed substantial questions of law raised in the present\n                appeal.18     Several precedent decisions of this court have\n                    elaborated on the requirement of a “substantive question of law”\n                    in s 29(2A). Section 29(2A) reflects the policy that decisions of the\n                    Commissioner are not to be examined as though they are decisions of a court of\n                    law (Karuppiahat [9]), as evinced through Parliamentary debates which state the\n                    intention of the WICA is to provide “a simpler and quicker way to settle\n                    compensation claims by avoiding protracted legal proceedings” (Allianz Insuranceat [20]).19     It should be noted that the “question\n                    of law” test for appeals from decisions of statutory tribunals (such as\n                    the Commissioner in the present case) is different from that for appeals from\n                    arbitrators, since as a matter of policy, there must be a greater degree of\n                    judicial supervision over the former (Ng Swee Lang v Sassoon\n                        Samuel Bernard[2008] 1 SLR(R) 522 (“Ng Swee Lang”) at [24] and [25],Karuppiahat [14] andSelvam Raju v Camelron General\n                        Contractors and another[2010] 2 SLR 1113\n                        (“Selvam Raju”) at [7]). In determining the range of errors of law\n                    that may provide grounds for appeal under s 29(2A), the courts have\n                    accepted the full range of errors of law listed inHalsbury’s Laws of Englandvol 1(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed\n                    Reissue, 1989) at paragraph 70:... misinterpretation of a statute or any other legal document or a rule\n                        of common law; asking oneself and answering the wrong question, taking\n                        irrelevant considerations into account or failing to take relevant\n                        considerations into account when purporting to apply the law to the facts;\n                        admitting inadmissible evidence or rejecting admissible and relevant\n                        evidence; exercising a discretion on the basis of incorrect legal\n                        principles; giving reasons which disclose faulty legal reasoning or which\n                        are inadequate to fulfil an express duty to give reasons, and misdirecting\n                        oneself as to the burden of proof.20     In addition, the courts have accepted Lord\n                    Radcliffe’s statement inEdwards (Inspector of Taxes) v\n                        Bairstow[1956] AC 14 at 36 that a factual finding\n                    which was such that “no person acting judicially and properly instructed\n                    as to the relevant law could have come to the determination upon appeal”\n                    amounted to a misconception or error in point of law (Karuppiahat [13],Selvam Rajuat [7]). However, not every wrong finding of fact would amount to a\n                    substantial question of law. In the final analysis, the nature and effect of the\n                    error will be considered and such errors must have a bearing on the ultimate\n                    decision (Karuppiahat [15]).21     Turning to the two main issues on appeal in\n                    the present case (see above at[14]), it is\n                    clear that both involve “substantial questions of law” as defined\n                    in[19]and[20]above. Both issues involve statutory interpretation of\n                    s 3(1) of the WICA (especially the terms “accident” and\n                    “course of employment”). They also deal with inferences drawn by\n                    the Commissioner from the facts that the Commissioner had found. While the court\n                    will not generally disturb findings of facts unless they are such that\n                    “no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant\n                    law could have come to the determination upon appeal” (Karuppiahat [13]),\n                    there is no similar rule precluding courts from assessing the robustness of\n                    inferences drawn from the facts as found by the Commissioner.22     Having stated that this is a case where the\n                    issues raised are appealable to the High Court, I turn now to address the two\n                    issues involved in this appeal.Whether there was an “accident” for the purposes of\n                s 3(1)23     On the issue of whether there was an\n                    “accident” for the purposes of s 3(1), it is apposite to\n                    refer toNarayasamy, where Menon JC\n                    interpreted the meaning of “accident” by drawing from the House of\n                    Lords’ interpretation of the equivalent English statute (which isin pari materiawith s 3(1) of the WICA).\n                    The relevant passages fromNarayasamyare\n                    reproduced here:23 Lord Loreburn LC, speaking in the majority, first\n                        considered whether this could be described as an accident and held that it\n                        could following the decision of the House of Lords inFenton v Thorley & Co\n                        Ltd[1903] AC 443. His Lordship noted as follows\n                        at 245-246:The first question here is whether or not the learned judge was\n                            entitled to regard the rupture as an \"accident\" within the meaning of\n                            this Act. In my opinion, he was so entitled. Certainly it was an\n                            \"untoward event.\" It was not designed. It was unexpected in what seems\n                            to me the relevant sense, namely, that a sensible man who knew the\n                            nature of the work would not have expected it. I cannot agree with the\n                            argument presented to your Lordships that you are to ask whether a\n                            doctor acquainted with the man's condition would have expected it. Were\n                            that the right view, then it would not be an accident if a man very\n                            liable to fainting fits fell in a faint from a ladder and hurt himself.\n                            No doubt the ordinary accident is associated with something external;\n                            the bursting of a boiler, or an explosion in a mine, for example. But it\n                            may be merely from the main's own miscalculation, such as tripping and\n                            falling. Or it may be due both to internal and external conditions, as\n                            if a seaman were to faint in the rigging and tumble into the sea. I\n                            think it may also be something going wrong within the human frame\n                            itself, such as the straining of a muscle or the breaking of a blood\n                            vessel. If that occurred when he was lifting a weight it would be\n                            properly described as an accident. So, I think, rupturing an aneurism\n                            when tightening a nut with a spanner may be regarded as an\n                            accident.24 It is thus apparent that an \"accident\" within the meaning of the\n                        English statute (which is inpari materiawith\n                        s 3(1) of the Act)would include an internal\n                            medical condition that caused an unexpected injury while the workman was\n                            carrying out his work.[emphasis added in bold italics]24     The parties agreed on the interpretation of\n                    “accident” as adopted inNarayasamy,viz, that it would “include an internal\n                    medical condition that caused an unexpected injury while the workman was\n                    carrying out his work”. The parties agreed that the Deceased had died\n                    from circumstances that resembled a cardiac arrest and further agreed that if\n                    the death wasindeedcaused by cardiac arrest, it\n                    would be considered, on the authority ofNarayasamy, to be caused by an “accident” within\n                    the meaning of s 3(1). The only dispute concerning the requirement of an\n                    “accident” stemmed from the 2nd Respondent’s argument that\n                    since theprecise cause of deathwas not proved by\n                    the Appellant, it could not be said that the Deceased’s death had been\n                    caused by an “accident”.25     Considering the circumstantial evidence that\n                    is available, namely, the phone calls made by the Deceased and, in particular, a\n                    phone call seeking medical assistance for breathing difficulties (see[7]above), I am of the view that the death was, on\n                    a balance of probabilities, caused by cardiac arrest. Accordingly, I find that\n                    the Deceased’s death was caused by an “accident” within the\n                    meaning of s 3(1).26     At this juncture, I pause to record several\n                    observations on the use of the term “accident” in s 3(1). The\n                    word “accident” is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary to\n                    mean “anunfortunate incidentthat happensunexpectedlyandunintentionally, typically resulting in damage or injury”\n                    (emphasis added).[note: 14]This definition would, at\n                    least on a literal reading, allow the word “accident” to include\n                    – as the court inNarayasamyheld – an\n                    internal medical condition that caused an unexpected injury while the workman\n                    was carrying out his work”. It could of course be argued that it is not\n                    in line with the common understanding of the word “accident” to\n                    include something which happens as a result of a person’s “internal\n                    medical condition”. Some may accordingly viewNarayasamyas providing an overly broad interpretation of\n                    “accident”.27     I sympathise with those who think that the\n                    word “accident” had been stretched beyond its common usage inNarayasamy. Nonetheless, in my view, the\n                    liberal interpretation of “accident” adopted inNarayasamyis justified. It is clear that s 9A of the\n                    Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) enjoins courts to prefer an\n                    interpretation that would promote the purpose underlying any particular\n                    legislation. The WICA describes itself as being “[a]n Act relating to the\n                    payment of compensation to employees for injury suffered in the course of their\n                    employment”. Being a piece of social legislation, the WICA should be\n                    interpreted purposively in favour of employees who have suffered injury during\n                    their employment. TheNarayasamyinterpretation is\n                    therefore entirely in line with the purpose of the WICA.28     An interesting point to note is the\n                    relationship between ss 3(1) and 3(5) of the WICA, stemming from the use of\n                    the word “accident” in the former. Section 3(1) has been set\n                    out at[12]above. Section 3(5) of the\n                    WICA provides:(5) An employer shall not be liable to pay compensation in\n                        respect of —(a) any injury to an employee resulting from an accident if it is\n                            proved that the injury to the employee is directly attributable to the\n                            employee having been at the time thereof under the influence of alcohol\n                            or a drug not prescribed by a medical practitioner; or(b) any incapacity or death resulting from a deliberate self-injury or\n                            the deliberate aggravation of an accidental injury.29     To recap, s 3(1) is the gateway to\n                    liability under s 3 of the WICA; the three elements of s 3(1), the\n                    second of which being that the injury must have been caused by an\n                    “accident”, must be fulfilled before an employer is liable to pay\n                    compensation to an employee. However, s 3(5)(b) excludes an\n                    employer’s liability for “any incapacity or death resulting from adeliberate self-injury…”\n                    (emphasis added). It is difficult to see how a particular claim could pass\n                    through the s 3(1) gateway but subsequently be excluded by virtue of\n                    s 3(5)(b), since a “deliberate self-injury” could hardly be\n                    considered an “accident” in the first place. Of course, one way to\n                    rationalise the provisions is to interpret the “deliberate\n                    self-injury” component of s 3(5)(b) as dealing with a class of cases\n                    that does not fall within s 3(1) in the first place but if that were the\n                    case, then s 3(5)(b) would not be necessary since there is no liability\n                    apart from s 3(1). An “accident” which is proved to have been\n                    faked or planned would be no accident at all.30     The situation in relation to ss 3(1) and\n                    3(5) may be avoided if the term “accident” (which already connotes\n                    something unintentional) is replaced by a more general term, for instance,\n                    “incident” (which is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary to\n                    mean “an instance of something happening; an event or\n                        occurrence”).[note: 15]The “deliberate\n                    self-injury” (referred to in s 3(5)(b)) would be an\n                    “incident” although it is not an\n                “accident”.31     In addition, replacing the word\n                    “accident” in the WICA with “incident” (or some\n                    other suitable term) would, I think, be more palatable to linguistic purists who\n                    may object quite legitimately to describing someone who suffered a heart attack\n                    as having had an “accident”. It would obviate the need for an\n                    expansive or over liberal meaning to be given to the word\n                    “accident”.Whether the accident arose out of and in the “course of the\n                employment”32     The next issue (which is also the main issue\n                    in dispute in the present case) is whether the accident arose in the\n                    “course of the employment”. This is a requirement to be met before\n                    liability can be established under s 3(1) of the WICA. The parties agreed\n                    that if the accident was found to have arisen in the “course of\n                    employment”, then it would, pursuant to s 3(6) of the WICA, be\n                    deemed to have arisen out of that employment. To repeat, s 3(6)\n                    provides:For the purposes of this Act, an accident arising in the course of an\n                        employee’s employment shall be deemed, in the absence of evidence to\n                        the contrary, to have arisen out of that employment.In other words, the parties are agreed that all that is required in\n                    the present case is to determine whether the accident arose in the\n                    “course of employment” since there is no contradicting\n                    evidence.33     As noted at[9]above, the Commissioner relied on the case ofQBE Insurancein determining that the Deceased, while\n                    waiting for Lim’s transport, was not in the course of employment. The\n                    House of Lords’ decision inCharles R Davidson and\n                        Company v M’Robb or Officer[1918] AC 304\n                        (“Davidson”) is instructive and\n                    it is apposite to reproduce extracts of the judgments of three of the learned\n                    Law Lords in that case. I begin with the dissenting opinion of Lord\n                    Finlay LC (at 314-315):“In the course of the employment” must mean, similarly, in\n                        thecourse of the work which the man is employed to do,\n                            and what is incident to it– in other words, in the\n                        course of his service. In the case of a domestic servant who sleeps and\n                        takes his meals in his master’s house he is in the course of his\n                        service all the time – his service is interrupted if he goes out on\n                        his own business or pleasure. A workman who by the terms of his employment\n                        takes his meals on his employer’s premises is in the course of his\n                        service in being there at meal-times. In either case the master or employer\n                        would be liable for damage caused by such an accident……“In the course of the employment” does\n                            not mean during the currency of the time of the engagement.\n                        If the words meant this they would be useless, and would add nothing to the\n                        words “arising out of the employment,” while to interpret them\n                        in this sense would let in the possibility of a number of claims of the\n                        nature above indicated which the words “in the course of the\n                        employment” rightly read as meaning in the course of the work or\n                        service would exclude. If “in the course of the employment”\n                        meant during the currency of the engagement a sailor engaged for a round\n                        voyage would be in the course of his employment while in a public-house in\n                        any port where he had leave to go on shore.“Course” is more applicable to work or service than to\n                            the currency of the engagement. Leave on shore on the sailor’s own\n                            business or pleasure is an interruption of his employment, not in the\n                            course of it.[emphasis added]Lord Dunedin noted (at 321) that:… In my view “in the course of employment” is a\n                        different thing from “during the period of employment.” It\n                        connotes, to my mind, the idea that the workman or servant is doing\n                        something which is part of his service to his employer or master.No doubt it need not be actual work, but it must, I think, be\n                            work, or the natural incidents connected with the class of\n                            work– e.g., in the workman’s case the taking of\n                        meals during the hours of labour; in the servant’s, not only the\n                        taking of meals, butresting and sleeping,\n                        which follow from the fact that domestic servants generally live and sleep\n                        under the master’s roof. … [emphasis added]Lord Atkinson provided further guidance on determining whether an\n                    employee was “in the course of employment” at the material time\n                    (at 327):… The words “in course of his employment” mean, I\n                        think, while the workman is doing something he is employed to do. In the\n                        case of a sailor who lives on board his ship, or an indoor servant who lives\n                        in his master’s house, these words would of course cover and include\n                        thingsnecessarily incidental to his service there\n                            – such as taking his meals, sleeping, resting, &c.\n                        In satisfying these demands of nature the sailor is as truly doing something\n                        within the course of his employment as he would be in keeping a look-out or\n                        going aloft. … [emphasis added]34     It should be noted that inAllianz Insurance, Lai JC cited Lord\n                    Findlay LC’s dicta inDavidsonwith\n                    approval and went on to find that the deceased inAllianz\n                        Insurancewas within the course of his employment despite being\n                    on a break after his shift had ended and despite there being no evidence that he\n                    was actually doing work at the time of death. The present case is concerned with\n                    a situation in which an employee is sent overseas on a business trip.\n                    Accordingly, I limit my observations to the context of employees going on\n                    overseas working trips. One possible interpretation is that an employee on an\n                    overseas working trip is considered to be in the “course of\n                    employment” for theentire periodthat he\n                    is overseas. Another possible interpretation is that the employee is considered\n                    to be in the “course of employment” only during the time that he\n                    is actively at work, and not, for instance, when he is having meals or sleeping.\n                    To my mind, however, both interpretations are extreme and cannot represent the\n                    law with regard to the “course of employment” under s 3(1) of\n                    the WICA. The former interpretation is clearly too broad. It would, for\n                    instance, render an employer liable for an employee’s injury where the\n                    employee chooses to do extreme sports on a free day between business meetings.\n                    Such an action by the employee would, to borrow Lord Finlay LC’s words, be\n                    “aninterruptionof his employment, not in\n                    the course of it” (emphasis added). In contrast, the latter\n                    interpretation is clearly too narrow. It would, for instance, render an employee\n                    without compensation simply because he had been taking a breather from work when\n                    tragedy struck. Such an interpretation would starkly contradict the opinions of\n                    Lords Dunedin and Atkinson, that “natural [or necessary]\n                    incidents” connected to work would fall within the course of employment\n                    as well.35     In my opinion, the proper approach to take\n                    falls somewhere between the extreme approaches outlined in the preceding\n                    paragraph. Some examples will be useful to illustrate the necessity of a\n                    fact-sensitive approach in determining whether an employee was in the\n                    “course of employment” at the material time. In some cases, it is\n                    reasonably clear that the employee is not in the course of employment when he\n                    suffered the injury. For instance, if an employee travels on a working trip to\n                    London and thereafter heads to Paris for a vacation before returning, any injury\n                    occasioned during the period of time when he is in Paris would not be in the\n                    course of employment – his presence in Paris cannot generally be said to\n                    beincidentalto his work. There are, however,\n                    situations which are less clear. Take the example of an employee who travels for\n                    a working trip that involves numerous meetings and little time for leisure\n                    activities;prima facie, the entire trip would be\n                    considered to be in the course of employment, since his presence overseas may be\n                    said to be “necessarily incidental” to his work. However, if the\n                    employee chooses to go bungee jumping during a period of free time between\n                    meetings and injures himself in the process, this would probably not be\n                    sufficientlyincidentalto the course of work and\n                    accordingly constitutes a “frolic of the employee’s own”, a\n                    “deviation” from or an “interruption” to the course\n                    of employment. On the other hand, if there was evidence that the employee had\n                    gone bungee jumping for the purposes of building business relations with a\n                    particular client, then it could conceivably be argued that the injury from\n                    bungee jumping was caused in the course of employment.36     The process of determining whether an employee\n                    was, at the material time of suffering injury, in the “course of\n                    employment”, is ahighly factual inquiry.\n                    An analogy may be made with tort cases relating to whether an employer is\n                    vicariously liable for acts done by an employee in the course of employment.\n                    From those cases, it is clear that whether a detour by an employee is a\n                    “frolic of his own” or is conversely in the course of employment,\n                    is a matter of fact and degree (seeeg Joel v\n                        Morison(1834) 6 C&P 501,Whatman v Pearson(1868) LR 3 CP 422 andStorey v Ashton(1869)\n                    LR 4 QB 476). In my view, the factual nature of the test applies\n                    equally in the context of determining whether, for purposes of work injury\n                    compensation, the employee concerned was “in the course of\n                    employment” when injury was suffered. It is neither helpful nor\n                    appropriate for courts to attempt to phrase a precise legal test to govern all\n                    situations, given that the question whether an employee was in the\n                    “course of employment” is essentially a fact-specific inquiry.\n                    Indeed, this brings to mind a recent exhortation of the Court of Appeal inShadrake Alan v PP[2011] SGCA 26 at[29], albeit in a very different\n                    context, that “seeking to elaborate upon a legal test whose efficacy is\n                    to be demonstrated more in itsapplicationrather\n                    than its theoretical elaboration is, with respect, perhaps an approach that\n                    should be avoided” (emphasis in original).37     I would specifically mention one consideration\n                    to be taken into account when determining whether, as a matter of fact, the\n                    employee was in the “course of employment” at the material time. I\n                    have earlier (at[27]above) alluded to the\n                    fact that the WICA is social legislation which should be interpreted purposively\n                    in favour of employees who have suffered injury during their employment. The\n                    WICA must continue to be relevant to the realities of contemporary working\n                    environments and conditions. Increasingly, work is no longer confined to\n                    specific places and times, especially for white-collar employees (such as the\n                    Deceased). Accordingly, the concept of being in the “course of\n                    employment” must accommodate and reflect these changes in modern working\n                    life.38     Returning to the facts of the present case, it\n                    should be noted that it was undisputed that theentire trip\n                        was a working trip. No leisure activities were planned. Indeed,\n                    on the very day that the Deceased landed in Phnom Penh, he attended KEP’s\n                    anniversary dinner as a representative of the 1st Respondent. The next morning,\n                    he was going to meet with CBL for business matters and thereafter with KEP for\n                    an important meeting to resolve financial issues. The very afternoon after the\n                    meeting with KEP, the Deceased was scheduled to fly to Bangkok for further\n                    work-related purposes. There was no “interruption” whatsoever that\n                    brings the case outside theprima facieposition\n                    that the Deceased was in the “course of employment” at the\n                    material time. Indeed, the Deceased’s being in his hotel room on the\n                    fateful morning wasnecessarily incidentalto his\n                    work for the 1stRespondent.39     Even if leisure activities were included as\n                    part of the programme, so long as they were sanctioned by the employer, they\n                    would not amount to a break in employment. This accords with present day working\n                    life where leisure, team-building and morale-boosting activities are part and\n                    parcel of employment.40     I accept the Commissioner’s findings\n                    that there was no evidence of work-related emails or that the Deceased had\n                    prepared the documents necessary for discussion with KEP when he was found at\n                    11am that fateful morning. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the fact that\n                    there was noactual workat that point in time\n                    does not mean that the Deceased could not be considered to have been in the\n                    course of employment (see the judgments of Lords Dunedin and Atkinson inDavidson, reproduced at[33]above). Indeed, I note that the\n                    Deceased’s employers fully recognised and accepted that the Deceased died\n                    in the course of employment. Ong gave uncontroverted evidence that the Deceased\n                    was “a very disciplined and professional man” and that from his\n                    experience of working with the Deceased for over 20 years, including travelling\n                    with him on several business trips, he was certain that the Deceased would have\n                    spent the morning of 1 September 2010 preparing himself for the meeting\n                    with KEP. That is something entirely reasonable in the circumstances of this\n                    case and perhaps in most cases of overseas work trips as well, especially those\n                    with a demanding schedule.41     In the circumstances, I find that the Deceased\n                    suffered what appeared highly likely to be a cardiac arrest in the\n                    “course of employment”. By virtue of s 3(6), the accident\n                    would be deemed to have arisen out of the Deceased’s employment (see[32]above).Conclusion42     For the reasons given above, I find that the\n                    requirements under s 3(1) of the WICA were made out and the\n                    employer’s liability was established. The application for the\n                    Commissioner’s decision to be reversed is therefore granted. Costs are\n                    awarded to the Applicant to be taxed or agreed between the\n                parties.[note: 1]Phang Chiew Kim (NOK of Poon Wai Tong) v\n                                    Wartsila Singapore Pte Ltd and India International Insurance Pte\n                                    Ltd, Case No 0820791E, Grounds of Decision of\n                                Assistant Commissioner (Work Injury Compensation) Jimmy Khoo Lian\n                                Wai (“GD”) at [5].[note: 2]GD at [11]-[24][note: 3]GD at [25][note: 4]GD at\n                                            [25][note: 5]GD at\n                                            [25][note: 6]GD at\n                                            [28][note: 7]GD at [28][note: 8]GD at [28][note: 9]GD at [29][note: 10]GD at [29][note: 11]GD at\n                                    [5][note: 12]GD at [5][note: 13]GD at [5][note: 14]Oxford Dictionaries.

        "Preliminary issue: appeals from the Commissioner": "16     An appeal to the High Court from a decision of\n                    the Commissioner made under the WICA is possible only where a\n                    “substantial question of law is involved in the appeal” and\n                    “the amount in dispute is not less than $1,000” (s 29(2A) of\n                    the WICA). Section 29 of the WICA is reproduced here for\n                    convenience: Appeal from decision of\n                            Commissioner 29. —(1) Subject to section 24(3B), any person aggrieved by any\n                        order of the Commissioner made under this Act may appeal to the High Court\n                        whose decision shall be final. (2) Subject to the Rules of Court, the procedure in an appeal to the High\n                        Court shall be the procedure in a civil appeal from a District Court with\n                        such modifications as the circumstances may require. (2A) No appeal shall lie against any order unless asubstantial question of lawis involved in the appeal and\n                        theamount in dispute is not less than\n                        $1,000. (3) Notwithstanding any appeal under this section, the employer shall\n                        deposit with the Commissioner the amount of compensation ordered by the\n                        Commissioner under section 25B, 25C or 25D within 21 days from the date of\n                        the Commissioner’s decision, and the deposit shall be held by the\n                        Commissioner pending the outcome of the appeal. [emphasis added] 17     The parties in the present case did not raise\n                    any issues regarding s 29(2A), implying that they agreed that substantial\n                    questions of law were involved in the present appeal. Nonetheless, for\n                    completeness, I turn to make some brief observations on the right of appeal to\n                    the High Court from a decision of the Commissioner and to assess whether there\n                    were indeed substantial questions of law raised in the present\n                appeal. 18     Several precedent decisions of this court have\n                    elaborated on the requirement of a “substantive question of law”\n                    in s 29(2A). Section 29(2A) reflects the policy that decisions of the\n                    Commissioner are not to be examined as though they are decisions of a court of\n                    law (Karuppiahat [9]), as evinced through Parliamentary debates which state the\n                    intention of the WICA is to provide “a simpler and quicker way to settle\n                    compensation claims by avoiding protracted legal proceedings” (Allianz Insuranceat [20]). 19     It should be noted that the “question\n                    of law” test for appeals from decisions of statutory tribunals (such as\n                    the Commissioner in the present case) is different from that for appeals from\n                    arbitrators, since as a matter of policy, there must be a greater degree of\n                    judicial supervision over the former (Ng Swee Lang v Sassoon\n                        Samuel Bernard[2008] 1 SLR(R) 522 (“Ng Swee Lang”) at [24] and [25],Karuppiahat [14] andSelvam Raju v Camelron General\n                        Contractors and another[2010] 2 SLR 1113\n                        (“Selvam Raju”) at [7]). In determining the range of errors of law\n                    that may provide grounds for appeal under s 29(2A), the courts have\n                    accepted the full range of errors of law listed inHalsbury’s Laws of Englandvol 1(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed\n                    Reissue, 1989) at paragraph 70: ... misinterpretation of a statute or any other legal document or a rule\n                        of common law; asking oneself and answering the wrong question, taking\n                        irrelevant considerations into account or failing to take relevant\n                        considerations into account when purporting to apply the law to the facts;\n                        admitting inadmissible evidence or rejecting admissible and relevant\n                        evidence; exercising a discretion on the basis of incorrect legal\n                        principles; giving reasons which disclose faulty legal reasoning or which\n                        are inadequate to fulfil an express duty to give reasons, and misdirecting\n                        oneself as to the burden of proof. 20     In addition, the courts have accepted Lord\n                    Radcliffe’s statement inEdwards (Inspector of Taxes) v\n                        Bairstow[1956] AC 14 at 36 that a factual finding\n                    which was such that “no person acting judicially and properly instructed\n                    as to the relevant law could have come to the determination upon appeal”\n                    amounted to a misconception or error in point of law (Karuppiahat [13],Selvam Rajuat [7]). However, not every wrong finding of fact would amount to a\n                    substantial question of law. In the final analysis, the nature and effect of the\n                    error will be considered and such errors must have a bearing on the ultimate\n                    decision (Karuppiahat [15]). 21     Turning to the two main issues on appeal in\n                    the present case (see above at[14]), it is\n                    clear that both involve “substantial questions of law” as defined\n                    in[19]and[20]above. Both issues involve statutory interpretation of\n                    s 3(1) of the WICA (especially the terms “accident” and\n                    “course of employment”). They also deal with inferences drawn by\n                    the Commissioner from the facts that the Commissioner had found. While the court\n                    will not generally disturb findings of facts unless they are such that\n                    “no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant\n                    law could have come to the determination upon appeal” (Karuppiahat [13]),\n                    there is no similar rule precluding courts from assessing the robustness of\n                    inferences drawn from the facts as found by the Commissioner. 22     Having stated that this is a case where the\n                    issues raised are appealable to the High Court, I turn now to address the two\n                    issues involved in this appeal.",
        "Whether there was an “accident” for the purposes of\n                s 3(1)": "23     On the issue of whether there was an\n                    “accident” for the purposes of s 3(1), it is apposite to\n                    refer toNarayasamy, where Menon JC\n                    interpreted the meaning of “accident” by drawing from the House of\n                    Lords’ interpretation of the equivalent English statute (which isin pari materiawith s 3(1) of the WICA).\n                    The relevant passages fromNarayasamyare\n                    reproduced here: 23 Lord Loreburn LC, speaking in the majority, first\n                        considered whether this could be described as an accident and held that it\n                        could following the decision of the House of Lords inFenton v Thorley & Co\n                        Ltd[1903] AC 443. His Lordship noted as follows\n                        at 245-246: The first question here is whether or not the learned judge was\n                            entitled to regard the rupture as an \"accident\" within the meaning of\n                            this Act. In my opinion, he was so entitled. Certainly it was an\n                            \"untoward event.\" It was not designed. It was unexpected in what seems\n                            to me the relevant sense, namely, that a sensible man who knew the\n                            nature of the work would not have expected it. I cannot agree with the\n                            argument presented to your Lordships that you are to ask whether a\n                            doctor acquainted with the man's condition would have expected it. Were\n                            that the right view, then it would not be an accident if a man very\n                            liable to fainting fits fell in a faint from a ladder and hurt himself.\n                            No doubt the ordinary accident is associated with something external;\n                            the bursting of a boiler, or an explosion in a mine, for example. But it\n                            may be merely from the main's own miscalculation, such as tripping and\n                            falling. Or it may be due both to internal and external conditions, as\n                            if a seaman were to faint in the rigging and tumble into the sea. I\n                            think it may also be something going wrong within the human frame\n                            itself, such as the straining of a muscle or the breaking of a blood\n                            vessel. If that occurred when he was lifting a weight it would be\n                            properly described as an accident. So, I think, rupturing an aneurism\n                            when tightening a nut with a spanner may be regarded as an\n                            accident. 24 It is thus apparent that an \"accident\" within the meaning of the\n                        English statute (which is inpari materiawith\n                        s 3(1) of the Act)would include an internal\n                            medical condition that caused an unexpected injury while the workman was\n                            carrying out his work. [emphasis added in bold italics] 24     The parties agreed on the interpretation of\n                    “accident” as adopted inNarayasamy,viz, that it would “include an internal\n                    medical condition that caused an unexpected injury while the workman was\n                    carrying out his work”. The parties agreed that the Deceased had died\n                    from circumstances that resembled a cardiac arrest and further agreed that if\n                    the death wasindeedcaused by cardiac arrest, it\n                    would be considered, on the authority ofNarayasamy, to be caused by an “accident” within\n                    the meaning of s 3(1). The only dispute concerning the requirement of an\n                    “accident” stemmed from the 2nd Respondent’s argument that\n                    since theprecise cause of deathwas not proved by\n                    the Appellant, it could not be said that the Deceased’s death had been\n                    caused by an “accident”. 25     Considering the circumstantial evidence that\n                    is available, namely, the phone calls made by the Deceased and, in particular, a\n                    phone call seeking medical assistance for breathing difficulties (see[7]above), I am of the view that the death was, on\n                    a balance of probabilities, caused by cardiac arrest. Accordingly, I find that\n                    the Deceased’s death was caused by an “accident” within the\n                    meaning of s 3(1). 26     At this juncture, I pause to record several\n                    observations on the use of the term “accident” in s 3(1). The\n                    word “accident” is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary to\n                    mean “anunfortunate incidentthat happensunexpectedlyandunintentionally, typically resulting in damage or injury”\n                    (emphasis added).[note: 14]This definition would, at\n                    least on a literal reading, allow the word “accident” to include\n                    – as the court inNarayasamyheld – an\n                    internal medical condition that caused an unexpected injury while the workman\n                    was carrying out his work”. It could of course be argued that it is not\n                    in line with the common understanding of the word “accident” to\n                    include something which happens as a result of a person’s “internal\n                    medical condition”. Some may accordingly viewNarayasamyas providing an overly broad interpretation of\n                    “accident”. 27     I sympathise with those who think that the\n                    word “accident” had been stretched beyond its common usage inNarayasamy. Nonetheless, in my view, the\n                    liberal interpretation of “accident” adopted inNarayasamyis justified. It is clear that s 9A of the\n                    Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) enjoins courts to prefer an\n                    interpretation that would promote the purpose underlying any particular\n                    legislation. The WICA describes itself as being “[a]n Act relating to the\n                    payment of compensation to employees for injury suffered in the course of their\n                    employment”. Being a piece of social legislation, the WICA should be\n                    interpreted purposively in favour of employees who have suffered injury during\n                    their employment. TheNarayasamyinterpretation is\n                    therefore entirely in line with the purpose of the WICA. 28     An interesting point to note is the\n                    relationship between ss 3(1) and 3(5) of the WICA, stemming from the use of\n                    the word “accident” in the former. Section 3(1) has been set\n                    out at[12]above. Section 3(5) of the\n                    WICA provides: (5) An employer shall not be liable to pay compensation in\n                        respect of — (a) any injury to an employee resulting from an accident if it is\n                            proved that the injury to the employee is directly attributable to the\n                            employee having been at the time thereof under the influence of alcohol\n                            or a drug not prescribed by a medical practitioner; or (b) any incapacity or death resulting from a deliberate self-injury or\n                            the deliberate aggravation of an accidental injury. 29     To recap, s 3(1) is the gateway to\n                    liability under s 3 of the WICA; the three elements of s 3(1), the\n                    second of which being that the injury must have been caused by an\n                    “accident”, must be fulfilled before an employer is liable to pay\n                    compensation to an employee. However, s 3(5)(b) excludes an\n                    employer’s liability for “any incapacity or death resulting from adeliberate self-injury…”\n                    (emphasis added). It is difficult to see how a particular claim could pass\n                    through the s 3(1) gateway but subsequently be excluded by virtue of\n                    s 3(5)(b), since a “deliberate self-injury” could hardly be\n                    considered an “accident” in the first place. Of course, one way to\n                    rationalise the provisions is to interpret the “deliberate\n                    self-injury” component of s 3(5)(b) as dealing with a class of cases\n                    that does not fall within s 3(1) in the first place but if that were the\n                    case, then s 3(5)(b) would not be necessary since there is no liability\n                    apart from s 3(1). An “accident” which is proved to have been\n                    faked or planned would be no accident at all. 30     The situation in relation to ss 3(1) and\n                    3(5) may be avoided if the term “accident” (which already connotes\n                    something unintentional) is replaced by a more general term, for instance,\n                    “incident” (which is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary to\n                    mean “an instance of something happening; an event or\n                        occurrence”).[note: 15]The “deliberate\n                    self-injury” (referred to in s 3(5)(b)) would be an\n                    “incident” although it is not an\n                “accident”. 31     In addition, replacing the word\n                    “accident” in the WICA with “incident” (or some\n                    other suitable term) would, I think, be more palatable to linguistic purists who\n                    may object quite legitimately to describing someone who suffered a heart attack\n                    as having had an “accident”. It would obviate the need for an\n                    expansive or over liberal meaning to be given to the word\n                    “accident”.",
        "Whether the accident arose out of and in the “course of the\n                employment”": "32     The next issue (which is also the main issue\n                    in dispute in the present case) is whether the accident arose in the\n                    “course of the employment”. This is a requirement to be met before\n                    liability can be established under s 3(1) of the WICA. The parties agreed\n                    that if the accident was found to have arisen in the “course of\n                    employment”, then it would, pursuant to s 3(6) of the WICA, be\n                    deemed to have arisen out of that employment. To repeat, s 3(6)\n                    provides: For the purposes of this Act, an accident arising in the course of an\n                        employee’s employment shall be deemed, in the absence of evidence to\n                        the contrary, to have arisen out of that employment. In other words, the parties are agreed that all that is required in\n                    the present case is to determine whether the accident arose in the\n                    “course of employment” since there is no contradicting\n                    evidence. 33     As noted at[9]above, the Commissioner relied on the case ofQBE Insurancein determining that the Deceased, while\n                    waiting for Lim’s transport, was not in the course of employment. The\n                    House of Lords’ decision inCharles R Davidson and\n                        Company v M’Robb or Officer[1918] AC 304\n                        (“Davidson”) is instructive and\n                    it is apposite to reproduce extracts of the judgments of three of the learned\n                    Law Lords in that case. I begin with the dissenting opinion of Lord\n                    Finlay LC (at 314-315): “In the course of the employment” must mean, similarly, in\n                        thecourse of the work which the man is employed to do,\n                            and what is incident to it– in other words, in the\n                        course of his service. In the case of a domestic servant who sleeps and\n                        takes his meals in his master’s house he is in the course of his\n                        service all the time – his service is interrupted if he goes out on\n                        his own business or pleasure. A workman who by the terms of his employment\n                        takes his meals on his employer’s premises is in the course of his\n                        service in being there at meal-times. In either case the master or employer\n                        would be liable for damage caused by such an accident… … “In the course of the employment” does\n                            not mean during the currency of the time of the engagement.\n                        If the words meant this they would be useless, and would add nothing to the\n                        words “arising out of the employment,” while to interpret them\n                        in this sense would let in the possibility of a number of claims of the\n                        nature above indicated which the words “in the course of the\n                        employment” rightly read as meaning in the course of the work or\n                        service would exclude. If “in the course of the employment”\n                        meant during the currency of the engagement a sailor engaged for a round\n                        voyage would be in the course of his employment while in a public-house in\n                        any port where he had leave to go on shore.“Course” is more applicable to work or service than to\n                            the currency of the engagement. Leave on shore on the sailor’s own\n                            business or pleasure is an interruption of his employment, not in the\n                            course of it. [emphasis added] Lord Dunedin noted (at 321) that: … In my view “in the course of employment” is a\n                        different thing from “during the period of employment.” It\n                        connotes, to my mind, the idea that the workman or servant is doing\n                        something which is part of his service to his employer or master.No doubt it need not be actual work, but it must, I think, be\n                            work, or the natural incidents connected with the class of\n                            work– e.g., in the workman’s case the taking of\n                        meals during the hours of labour; in the servant’s, not only the\n                        taking of meals, butresting and sleeping,\n                        which follow from the fact that domestic servants generally live and sleep\n                        under the master’s roof. … [emphasis added] Lord Atkinson provided further guidance on determining whether an\n                    employee was “in the course of employment” at the material time\n                    (at 327): … The words “in course of his employment” mean, I\n                        think, while the workman is doing something he is employed to do. In the\n                        case of a sailor who lives on board his ship, or an indoor servant who lives\n                        in his master’s house, these words would of course cover and include\n                        thingsnecessarily incidental to his service there\n                            – such as taking his meals, sleeping, resting, &c.\n                        In satisfying these demands of nature the sailor is as truly doing something\n                        within the course of his employment as he would be in keeping a look-out or\n                        going aloft. … [emphasis added] 34     It should be noted that inAllianz Insurance, Lai JC cited Lord\n                    Findlay LC’s dicta inDavidsonwith\n                    approval and went on to find that the deceased inAllianz\n                        Insurancewas within the course of his employment despite being\n                    on a break after his shift had ended and despite there being no evidence that he\n                    was actually doing work at the time of death. The present case is concerned with\n                    a situation in which an employee is sent overseas on a business trip.\n                    Accordingly, I limit my observations to the context of employees going on\n                    overseas working trips. One possible interpretation is that an employee on an\n                    overseas working trip is considered to be in the “course of\n                    employment” for theentire periodthat he\n                    is overseas. Another possible interpretation is that the employee is considered\n                    to be in the “course of employment” only during the time that he\n                    is actively at work, and not, for instance, when he is having meals or sleeping.\n                    To my mind, however, both interpretations are extreme and cannot represent the\n                    law with regard to the “course of employment” under s 3(1) of\n                    the WICA. The former interpretation is clearly too broad. It would, for\n                    instance, render an employer liable for an employee’s injury where the\n                    employee chooses to do extreme sports on a free day between business meetings.\n                    Such an action by the employee would, to borrow Lord Finlay LC’s words, be\n                    “aninterruptionof his employment, not in\n                    the course of it” (emphasis added). In contrast, the latter\n                    interpretation is clearly too narrow. It would, for instance, render an employee\n                    without compensation simply because he had been taking a breather from work when\n                    tragedy struck. Such an interpretation would starkly contradict the opinions of\n                    Lords Dunedin and Atkinson, that “natural [or necessary]\n                    incidents” connected to work would fall within the course of employment\n                    as well. 35     In my opinion, the proper approach to take\n                    falls somewhere between the extreme approaches outlined in the preceding\n                    paragraph. Some examples will be useful to illustrate the necessity of a\n                    fact-sensitive approach in determining whether an employee was in the\n                    “course of employment” at the material time. In some cases, it is\n                    reasonably clear that the employee is not in the course of employment when he\n                    suffered the injury. For instance, if an employee travels on a working trip to\n                    London and thereafter heads to Paris for a vacation before returning, any injury\n                    occasioned during the period of time when he is in Paris would not be in the\n                    course of employment – his presence in Paris cannot generally be said to\n                    beincidentalto his work. There are, however,\n                    situations which are less clear. Take the example of an employee who travels for\n                    a working trip that involves numerous meetings and little time for leisure\n                    activities;prima facie, the entire trip would be\n                    considered to be in the course of employment, since his presence overseas may be\n                    said to be “necessarily incidental” to his work. However, if the\n                    employee chooses to go bungee jumping during a period of free time between\n                    meetings and injures himself in the process, this would probably not be\n                    sufficientlyincidentalto the course of work and\n                    accordingly constitutes a “frolic of the employee’s own”, a\n                    “deviation” from or an “interruption” to the course\n                    of employment. On the other hand, if there was evidence that the employee had\n                    gone bungee jumping for the purposes of building business relations with a\n                    particular client, then it could conceivably be argued that the injury from\n                    bungee jumping was caused in the course of employment. 36     The process of determining whether an employee\n                    was, at the material time of suffering injury, in the “course of\n                    employment”, is ahighly factual inquiry.\n                    An analogy may be made with tort cases relating to whether an employer is\n                    vicariously liable for acts done by an employee in the course of employment.\n                    From those cases, it is clear that whether a detour by an employee is a\n                    “frolic of his own” or is conversely in the course of employment,\n                    is a matter of fact and degree (seeeg Joel v\n                        Morison(1834) 6 C&P 501,Whatman v Pearson(1868) LR 3 CP 422 andStorey v Ashton(1869)\n                    LR 4 QB 476). In my view, the factual nature of the test applies\n                    equally in the context of determining whether, for purposes of work injury\n                    compensation, the employee concerned was “in the course of\n                    employment” when injury was suffered. It is neither helpful nor\n                    appropriate for courts to attempt to phrase a precise legal test to govern all\n                    situations, given that the question whether an employee was in the\n                    “course of employment” is essentially a fact-specific inquiry.\n                    Indeed, this brings to mind a recent exhortation of the Court of Appeal inShadrake Alan v PP[2011] SGCA 26 at[29], albeit in a very different\n                    context, that “seeking to elaborate upon a legal test whose efficacy is\n                    to be demonstrated more in itsapplicationrather\n                    than its theoretical elaboration is, with respect, perhaps an approach that\n                    should be avoided” (emphasis in original). 37     I would specifically mention one consideration\n                    to be taken into account when determining whether, as a matter of fact, the\n                    employee was in the “course of employment” at the material time. I\n                    have earlier (at[27]above) alluded to the\n                    fact that the WICA is social legislation which should be interpreted purposively\n                    in favour of employees who have suffered injury during their employment. The\n                    WICA must continue to be relevant to the realities of contemporary working\n                    environments and conditions. Increasingly, work is no longer confined to\n                    specific places and times, especially for white-collar employees (such as the\n                    Deceased). Accordingly, the concept of being in the “course of\n                    employment” must accommodate and reflect these changes in modern working\n                    life. 38     Returning to the facts of the present case, it\n                    should be noted that it was undisputed that theentire trip\n                        was a working trip. No leisure activities were planned. Indeed,\n                    on the very day that the Deceased landed in Phnom Penh, he attended KEP’s\n                    anniversary dinner as a representative of the 1st Respondent. The next morning,\n                    he was going to meet with CBL for business matters and thereafter with KEP for\n                    an important meeting to resolve financial issues. The very afternoon after the\n                    meeting with KEP, the Deceased was scheduled to fly to Bangkok for further\n                    work-related purposes. There was no “interruption” whatsoever that\n                    brings the case outside theprima facieposition\n                    that the Deceased was in the “course of employment” at the\n                    material time. Indeed, the Deceased’s being in his hotel room on the\n                    fateful morning wasnecessarily incidentalto his\n                    work for the 1stRespondent. 39     Even if leisure activities were included as\n                    part of the programme, so long as they were sanctioned by the employer, they\n                    would not amount to a break in employment. This accords with present day working\n                    life where leisure, team-building and morale-boosting activities are part and\n                    parcel of employment. 40     I accept the Commissioner’s findings\n                    that there was no evidence of work-related emails or that the Deceased had\n                    prepared the documents necessary for discussion with KEP when he was found at\n                    11am that fateful morning. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the fact that\n                    there was noactual workat that point in time\n                    does not mean that the Deceased could not be considered to have been in the\n                    course of employment (see the judgments of Lords Dunedin and Atkinson inDavidson, reproduced at[33]above). Indeed, I note that the\n                    Deceased’s employers fully recognised and accepted that the Deceased died\n                    in the course of employment. Ong gave uncontroverted evidence that the Deceased\n                    was “a very disciplined and professional man” and that from his\n                    experience of working with the Deceased for over 20 years, including travelling\n                    with him on several business trips, he was certain that the Deceased would have\n                    spent the morning of 1 September 2010 preparing himself for the meeting\n                    with KEP. That is something entirely reasonable in the circumstances of this\n                    case and perhaps in most cases of overseas work trips as well, especially those\n                    with a demanding schedule. 41     In the circumstances, I find that the Deceased\n                    suffered what appeared highly likely to be a cardiac arrest in the\n                    “course of employment”. By virtue of s 3(6), the accident\n                    would be deemed to have arisen out of the Deceased’s employment (see[32]above).",
        "Conclusion": "42     For the reasons given above, I find that the\n                    requirements under s 3(1) of the WICA were made out and the\n                    employer’s liability was established. The application for the\n                    Commissioner’s decision to be reversed is therefore granted. Costs are\n                    awarded to the Applicant to be taxed or agreed between the\n                parties.
