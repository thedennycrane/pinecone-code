        "Introduction": "1 The plaintiffs sued the defendant for trade mark infringement under the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“Trade Marks Act”), passing off, and copyright infringement under the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Copyright Act”). In gist, the plaintiffs pleaded that, without their consent, the defendant had modified and sold machines bearing the plaintiffs’ “ApeosPort”, “DocuCentre” and/or “Fuji Xerox” marks in Singapore. The plaintiffs specifically referred to six photocopiers which had originally been manufactured by the 3rd plaintiff or its subsidiaries in countries other than Singapore and were not intended for any market outside of those countries. 2 On 30 July 2021, I allowed the plaintiffs’ claims in respect of trade mark infringement, passing off, secondary copyright infringement and rights management information infringement under s 260 of the Copyright Act. I rejected the plaintiffs’ claim for primary copyright infringement. The defendant filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision on 30 August 2021, and I now give my reasons for my decision.",
        "The facts": "",
        "The parties": "3 Shortly before I gave my decision, the plaintiffs were granted leave in HC/SUM 3049/2021 to amend their names in this action. In these written grounds, I will refer to the plaintiffs by their amended names. 4 The 1st plaintiff, FUJIFILM Business Innovation Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, is a company incorporated in Singapore in the business of,inter alia, manufacturing and importing printing and media equipment under the “Fuji Xerox” mark (“Fuji Xerox Equipment”) in the Asia Pacific region. It has been carrying on business in Singapore using the “Fuji Xerox” mark since its incorporation in 1991, in connection with the provision of the said goods and services.1Foot Note 1×Statement of Claim dated 11 December 2018 (“SOC”) at para 1. 5 The 2nd plaintiff, FUJIFILM Business Innovation Singapore Pte Ltd, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the 1st plaintiff. It is also incorporated in Singapore and has been carrying on business in Singapore using the “Fuji Xerox” mark since its incorporation in 1985, in connection with the provision of goods and services of,inter alia, importing, distributing and marketing Fuji Xerox Equipment in Singapore.2Foot Note 2×SOC at para 2. 6 The 3rd plaintiff, FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp, is a company incorporated in Japan. The 1st plaintiff is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the 3rd plaintiff, and the 3rd plaintiff is a joint venture between Fujifilm Holdings in Japan and Xerox Corporation in the USA.3Foot Note 3×SOC at para 3.In 2019, Fujifilm Holdings bought over the Xerox Corporation shares in the 3rd plaintiff.4Foot Note 4×Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) of Caron Batchelor Veronica dated 22 June 2020 (“Batchelor AEIC”) at para 11. 7 The defendant, PTC Business Systems Pte Ltd, is a company incorporated in Singapore selling,inter alia, office equipment and stationery.5Foot Note 5×AEIC of Poh Beng Leong dated 22 June 2020 (“Poh AEIC”) at para 4.It is mot disputed that the defendant is not an authorised dealer of Fuji Xerox Equipment in Singapore. It does, however, claim to be in the business of parallel importing and exporting various office equipment, including photocopiers and printing machines.6Foot Note 6×Defence (Amendment No. 2) dated 13 July 2020 (“Defence”) at para 6.",
        "Background": "The marks 8 Among the Fuji Xerox Equipment, the plaintiffs sell (inter alia) two series of multifunction photocopiers under the mark “DocuCentre” and under the mark “ApeosPort”. These multifunction photocopiers are equipped with various capabilities, including colour printing and copying. Fuji Xerox Equipment under the mark “ApeosPort” have functions that are not found in Fuji Xerox Equipment under the mark “DocuCentre” and are sold at higher prices.7Foot Note 7×SOC at para 4.“ApeosPort” Fuji Xerox Equipment will have product names starting with “AP”, while “DocuCentre” Fuji Xerox Equipment will have product names starting with “DC”.8Foot Note 8×Batchelor AEIC at paras 18–19.Each product has an accompanying 4-digit code that denotes the printing speed of the machine:ega “5575” model will print 55 pages per minute. Larger digits denote a higher function machine that will carry a higher price.9Foot Note 9×Batchelor AEIC at para 21.Each machine that carries the “ApeosPort” or “DocuCentre” mark also carries the “Fuji Xerox” trade mark.10Foot Note 10×Batchelor AEIC at para 30. 9 The 3rd plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trade mark “ApeosPort” (TM No. T0513649E) in respect of products in Class 9, which includes facsimile machines, printers for use with computers and computer software.11Foot Note 11×SOC at para 6.The 1st and 2nd plaintiffs are licensees of the “ApeosPort” registration.12Foot Note 12×SOC at para 7; Batchelor AEIC at para 24.Xerox Corporation owns the “DocuCentre” and “Fuji Xerox” trade marks, and all three plaintiffs pay royalties to Xerox Corporation for the use of these marks.13Foot Note 13×Transcript, 14 July 2020 at p 15, line 13–p 16, line 29; p 72, lines 16–28. 10 According to the 1st plaintiff’s head legal counsel Caron Batchelor Veronica (“Ms Batchelor”), all the Fuji Xerox Equipment in this case was manufactured and branded by the 3rd plaintiff in Japan with Xerox Corporation’s express or implied consent. All the Fuji Xerox Equipment was installed with licensed software/firmware owned by the 3rd plaintiff, which was required to run and operate the Fuji Xerox Equipment. While the media on which the software/firmware is installed may be sold, the software/firmware itself (including intellectual property rights like copyright) is only licensed.14Foot Note 14×Batchelor AEIC at paras 13–14.For Fuji Xerox Equipment marketed and sold in Singapore, the 2nd plaintiff (under the authority of the 1st and 3rd plaintiffs) imports the Fuji Xerox Equipment from the 3rd plaintiff.15Foot Note 15×Batchelor AEIC at para 15. Terms of sale and lease in the 2nd plaintiff’s contracts 11 The 2nd plaintiff’s contracts with its customers for the sale of “DocuCentre” or “ApeosPort” goods list the “Software / FXS Licensed Software” separately from the machine.16Foot Note 16×Agreed Bundle of Documents dated 29 June 2020 (“AB”) Vol 2 at pp 476–478.The contracts include certain standard clauses: 3. FXS, its related company or licensor (as the case may be) shall at all times remain the absolute owner of all rights, title and interest in the FXS Licensed Software. The License is non-exclusive and non-transferable, and is solely for use in conjunction with the Equipment in which installation is first made by FXS. … 3.2 Customer will not do or allow any act or thing which is likely to jeopardise or invalidate any of the intellectual property rights in the FXS Licensed Software and will not copy, reproduce or in any other way alter, modify, duplicate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the FXS Licensed Software. According to Ms Batchelor, “FXS” refers to the 2nd plaintiff, while “its related company or licensor” refers to the 3rd plaintiff.17Foot Note 17×Batchelor AEIC at paras 36–37. 12 Software/firmware for leasing arrangements is treated in a similar manner.18Foot Note 18×Batchelor AEIC at para 39; AB Vol 8 at pp 2089–2096.For example, one of the contracts between the 3rd plaintiff (the “Seller”) and a leasing company (“Party A”) provides: Article 6 Transfer of ownership (1) The ownership of the Machines/Software will transfer from the Seller to Party A once delivered. (2) The copyrights of the program installed in the Machines and the program installed in the Software (collectively referred to as “Program”) will NOT transfer from the Seller to Party A. Article 7 Setting of License … (2) Party A shall not use the Program for its own purpose. (3) Party A shall not duplicate or modify the Program. (4) Party A shall not disclose or provide the Program to any party other than the Customer of the third party that signed the Lease Contract with Party A. … Article 14 Measures to take when Lease Contract expires … (2) … if Party A and the Customer were not going to renew the lease, Party A will abandon ownership of the Machines and transfer it to the Seller, unless specified otherwise. The Seller will then re-use the Machines or recycle them. (3) … in case re-leasing will not be carried out between Party A and the Customer, yet Software is included in the Lease Contract, the Seller would collect back the Software, and the technician of the Seller will delete or destroy the Program in the floppy discs or other media used… … [emphasis in original] 13 The plaintiffs also provided a template Dealership Agreement that the 2nd plaintiff would enter into for dealerships in Singapore.19Foot Note 19×Batchelor AEIC at para 47; AB Vol 8 at pp 2173–2203.The template Dealership Agreement states,inter alia: 9.2 The Dealer shall not without the prior written consent of FXS: (a) sell directly or indirectly any of the products outside [Singapore], or to any person in [Singapore], when it knows or has reason to believe that the Products would be resold outside [Singapore]. 15.2  The Dealer further undertakes: (a) not to cause or permit anything which may damage or endanger the intellectual property rights of FXS or FX, or assist or allow others to do so; … (h) not to tamper with any markings or name plates or other indication of the source or origin of the Products which may be placed by FXS on the Products; (i) not to use the intellectual property unless it is permitted under this Agreement; … (n) to refrain from engaging and to procure its sub-Dealer(s) (if any) not to engage in any parallel import activities. 14 It is apparent that under the 2nd plaintiff’s Dealership Agreements, a reseller cannot sell Fuji Xerox Equipment outside the territory:egif the reseller is in China, they may only sell the Fuji Xerox Equipment within China. This was confirmed by Ms Batchelor under cross-examination.20Foot Note 20×Transcript, 14 July 2020 at p 19, lines 10–16. Software/firmware 15 I now turn to the software/firmware that was installed in the Fuji Xerox Equipment. According to the plaintiffs, the Fuji Xerox Equipment is inoperable without this software/firmware.21Foot Note 21×Batchelor AEIC at para 58.While the physical machine of the Fuji Xerox Equipment may be leased or sold, this software/firmware is only licensed, and no end-user is granted a right to sub-license the software/firmware.22Foot Note 22×Batchelor AEIC at paras 60–61.An end-customer who has bought a Fuji Xerox Equipment may sell the equipment, but the software/firmware will “automatically become an unlicensed copy upon any such sale”.23Foot Note 23×Batchelor AEIC at para 62. 16 Within the software/firmware, relevant rights management information in electronic form is embodied in it. This rights management information is unique to each Fuji Xerox Equipment machine. It includes the serial number, machine model, machine name and product code. The plaintiffs can track every item or component of a Fuji Xerox Equipment by way of this information, through its traceability system. The plaintiffs will also affix a physical label on every Fuji Xerox Equipment machine, where the said rights management information is incorporated into the surface of the Fuji Xerox Equipment: this is intended to be a permanent part of the machine.24Foot Note 24×Batchelor AEIC at paras 64–66. Investigation reports and letters of demand 17 From 2014, the plaintiffs conducted various investigations into the defendant’s business. I summarise these as follows. (1) April 2014: Acquiring Offending Machine 4 18 Around 15 April 2014, the 2nd plaintiff acquired one of the Offending Machines (Offending Machine 4) from S M Compass Enterprise Pte Ltd (“S M Compass”),25Foot Note 25×Batchelor AEIC at para 169; AB Vol 9 at pp 2323 and 2328.which S M Compass had bought from the defendant about two weeks earlier26Foot Note 26×AB Vol 9 at pp 2321–2322.. The 2nd plaintiff stored the machine at the 1st plaintiff’s premises in Singapore.27Foot Note 27×Batchelor AEIC at para 178.That same month, one Doi Kensuke, an employee of the 3rd plaintiff, examined Offending Machine 4 and prepared the Seito Investigation report.28Foot Note 28×AB Vol 3 at pp 716–722; AEIC of Minako Morimoto dated 19 June 2020 (“Morimoto AEIC”) at para 6.This report stated,inter alia, that this machine, which had an original serial number of 312708, “might be sold to Singapore Dealer from Malaysia”.29Foot Note 29×AB Vol 3 at p 717. 19 The 2nd plaintiff, through its solicitors, subsequently sent letters to the defendant on 20 June 2014 (“June 2014 Letter”),30Foot Note 30×AB Vol 3 at pp 724–725.3 July 2014 (“July 2014 Letter”)31Foot Note 31×AB Vol 3 at p 726., and 1 August 2014 (“August 2014 Letter”).32Foot Note 32×AB Vol 3 at pp 728–732.In the June 2014 Letter, the 2nd plaintiff’s then-solicitors stated that “[the defendant] [had] changed the label and the serial number of the FujiXerox photocopiers that you are marketing and selling”, and such conduct amounted “to a misrepresentation of the true identity of the subject product”.33Foot Note 33×AB Vol 3 at p 724.In the August 2014 Letter, the 2nd plaintiff’s new solicitors stated that this “change of serial number in the display of our client’s product…entails unauthorized alteration of our client’s proprietary, embedded software program for operation of the product”.34Foot Note 34×AB Vol 3 at p 729, para 7(c). (2) November 2014: Acquiring Offending Machines 5 and 6 20 Around November 2014, the 2nd plaintiff acquired Offending Machine 5 from Focus Art Pte Ltd (“Focus Art”), which had bought it from the defendant around 21 October 2014.35Foot Note 35×Batchelor AEIC at para 173; AB Vol 3 at pp 752–756.The 2nd plaintiff also acquired Offending Machine 6 from Raymond Ng & Associates Pte Ltd (“Raymond Ng & Associates”), which had bought it from the defendant around 5 November 2014.36Foot Note 36×Batchelor AEIC at para 174; AB Vol 3 at pp 757–759.Offending Machines 5 and 6 were stored at the 1st plaintiff’s premises.37Foot Note 37×Batchelor AEIC at para 178. 21 Subsequently, one Minako Morimoto (“Morimoto”), a staff member of the Customer Satisfaction Quality Assurance Group of the 3rd plaintiff, examined Offending Machines 5 and 6 and prepared the Seito Investigation for Changed Serial No. dated 26 November 2014 (the “26 November 2014 Report”).38Foot Note 38×Morimoto AEIC at para 8; AB Vol 3 at pp 760–779.Morimoto found,inter alia, that the serial numbers of both the machines (455024 and 455224) were not “[the] original one[s] in the factory”, which were 440578 and 840161 respectively.39Foot Note 39×AB Vol 3 at p 761. 22 On 22 May 2015, the 2nd plaintiff’s solicitors sent a letter to the defendant’s solicitors with its investigative findings on Offending Machines 4, 5 and 6.40Foot Note 40×AB Vol 4 at pp 861–864.The letter stated that “these actions render these illegally modified products non-genuine”, and that the “practical effect” of the defendant’s sale of these products was to “deprive the end-customer of product warranty, maintenance and after-sales services, normally associated with a genuine product”.41Foot Note 41×AB Vol 4 at p 863, paras 7 and 9.The letter also demanded that the defendant provide the 2nd plaintiff with the defendant’s supplier information.42Foot Note 42×AB Vol 4 at p 863, para 13. (3) June and July 2017: Further investigations by the plaintiffs 23 Subsequently, in June 2017, the 2nd plaintiff engaged Covert Investigation Pte Ltd (“Covert Investigation”) to conduct surveillance on the defendant. Covert Investigation prepared an investigation report dated 30 June 2017 (the “Covert Investigation Report”).43Foot Note 43×Batchelor AEIC at para 179; AB Vol 5 at pp 1072–1217; AEIC of Lee Sing Ling Wendell Dennis dated 22 June 2020 (“Dennis Affidavit”) at paras 8–9.As stated in the Covert Investigation Report, the investigators observed the delivery of various Fuji Xerox Equipment to different locations in Singapore, including a delivery of toners to Grace Management & Consultancy Services Pte Ltd (“GMC”) on 16 June 2017.44Foot Note 44×AB Vol 5 at pp 1078 and 1162. 24 Subsequently, Ai Yasuda (“Ms Yasuda”), a Quality Management Executive of the 3rd plaintiff, prepared a Parallel Import Investigation Report dated 25 July 2017 (the “July 2017 Report”).45Foot Note 45×AB Vol 5 at pp 1218–1235; AEIC of Ai Yasuda dated 19 June 2020 (“Yasuda AEIC”) at para 27.The July 2017 Report detailed a visit to Rooftop Recruiters Pte Ltd on 12 July 2017 and showed,inter alia, that instead of a valid machine name, the machine name had been changed to an individual person’s name.46Foot Note 46×Yasuda AEIC at para 33.However, this was not one of the six Offending Machines referred to in the Statement of Claim.47Foot Note 47×Yasuda AEIC at para 38. (4) November 2017: Acquiring Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 25 The 1st plaintiff reviewed the list of places which the defendant’s staff were observed visiting in the Covert Investigation Report – and which included GMC.48Foot Note 48×Batchelor AEIC at para 187.Around November 2017, a representative from the 1st plaintiff visited GMC, together with Ms Yasuda and the 2nd plaintiff’s engineer. They found that Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 had been modified and reported this to the directors of GMC. The directors were not aware of the modifications, and they exchanged Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 with Fuji Xerox Equipment supplied by the 2nd plaintiff.49Foot Note 49×Batchelor AEIC at paras 187–189; AB Vol 9 at pp 2329–2330. 26 The 2nd plaintiff took possession of Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 around 12 December 2017 and stored them at the premises of SG Investigators Pte Ltd (“SG Investigators”) that same day.50Foot Note 50×Batchelor AEIC at para 188; AEIC of Kang Chor Hee dated 22 June 2020 (“Kang AEIC”) at paras 5–6. (5) Events of 2018 27 On 4 June 2018, the 1st plaintiff was granted leave in HC/OS 226/2018 to commence proceedings against the defendant for,inter alia, infringement of the registered “ApeosPort” mark. 28 On 3 September 2018, SG Investigators transported Offending Machines 4, 5 and 6 from the 1st plaintiff’s premises to its own office.51Foot Note 51×Kang AEIC at para 7.All six Offending Machines continue to be stored at SG Investigators under constant video surveillance.52Foot Note 52×Kang AEIC at para 8.Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 (the “GMC Machines”) were inspected by Ms Yasuda on 18 December 2017, and again by Ms Yasuda and one Ronald Glico, a Customer Service Engineer of the 2nd plaintiff, on 28 August 2018.53Foot Note 53×Kang AEIC at para 9; Yasuda AEIC at para 41. 29 After the inspections, Ms Yasuda prepared a Parallel Import Investigation Report dated 7 September 2018 (the “September 2018 Report”).54Foot Note 54×AB Vol 6 at pp 1355–1416.In the September 2018 Report, Ms Yasuda detailed her findings in respect of each Offending Machine:55Foot Note 55×Yasuda AEIC at paras 40, 45–49. (a) Offending Machine 1, sold under the name “ApeosPort”: This machine had its copy speed (and corresponding product name), product code and serial number changed.56Foot Note 56×AB Vol 6 at pp 1357–1365. (b) Offending Machine 2, sold under the name “ApeosPort”: This machine had its product name changed from the lower-priced “DocuCentre” model to the higher-priced “ApeosPort” model. It also had its serial number changed.57Foot Note 57×AB Vol 6 at pp 1366–1376. (c) Offending Machine 3, sold under the name “ApeosPort”: According to the plaintiffs, the serial number of this machine had been changed when it was in the defendant’s possession, but had reverted to the original, genuine serial number by the time the 3rd plaintiff’s representative examined the machine.58Foot Note 58×AB Vol 6 at pp 1377–1389; Yasuda AEIC at para 48. (d) Offending Machine 4, sold under the name “DocuCentre”: This machine had its copy speed (and corresponding product name) and serial number changed.59Foot Note 59×AB Vol 6 at pp 1390–1397. (e) Offending Machine 5, sold under the name “DocuCentre”: This machine had its copy speed (and corresponding product name), product code, and serial number changed.60Foot Note 60×AB Vol 6 at pp 1398–1406. (f) Offending Machine 6, sold under the name “DocuCentre”: This machine had its copy speed (and corresponding product name) and serial number changed.61Foot Note 61×AB Vol 6 at pp 1407–1415. 30 On 11 December 2018, the plaintiffs filed HC/S 1252/2018 (“Suit 1252”) in respect of the six Offending Machines. The 3rd plaintiff gave an undertaking not to commence legal proceedings in its own name against the defendant for trade mark infringement. It remained a party to the passing off, copyright and rights management information infringement claims.62Foot Note 62×SOC at para 8.",
        "The plaintiffs’ case": "Trade mark infringement 31 The plaintiffs pleaded that the defendant infringed the ApeosPort registration by using in the course of trade and without the 3rd plaintiff’s consent a mark which was identical to the “ApeosPort” mark in relation to goods which were \"identical to those for which the “ApeosPort” mark is registered.63Foot Note 63×SOC at para 9.In particular, the plaintiffs claimed – under s 27(1) of the Trade Marks Act – that the defendant had been selling, offering or exposing for sale, leasing, servicing, importing and/or advertising photocopiers, printers and facsimile machines bearing the mark “ApeosPort” to members of the public in Singapore, on the defendant’s website and at the defendant’s registered business address.  According to the plaintiffs, the defendant had been affixing the mark “ApeosPort” to its photocopiers, printers and facsimile machines and/or their packaging; as well as using the “ApeosPort” mark on catalogues, price lists and other documents. 32 Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that around 2015 to 2016, the defendant sold Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 bearing the “ApeosPort” mark to GMC. These could be traced to machines which were originally put on the market in Japan by the 3rd plaintiff or its subsidiaries in Japan in 2010, 2012 and 2013 respectively, and which were not intended for any market outside Japan: these machines had been designated as scrap and were to have been destroyed in Japan. The GMC Machines had their conditions altered from the original machines,inter alia, with altered firmware, the incorporation of a step-down transformer, and altered print-speed configuration.64Foot Note 64×SOC at para 9(d). 33 Alternatively, the plaintiffs relied on section 27(2) of the Trade Marks Act. They pleaded that the defendant had infringed the ApeosPort registration by using in the course of trade without the consent of the 3rd plaintiff a mark, where – because the mark was identical with or similar to the ApeosPort mark in relation to goods which were identical with or similar to those for which the ApeosPort mark is registered – there existed a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.65Foot Note 65×SOC at para 11. Passing off 34 The plaintiffs also alleged passing off by the defendant in respect of the “ApeosPort”, “DocuCentre” and “Fuji Xerox” marks. In gist, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant’s acts of,inter alia, importing and selling photocopiers and other printing equipment under each of those marks to members of the public in Singapore, when these were not unmodified photocopiers or other printing equipment, amounted to a misrepresentation to members of the public and was likely to cause confusion to the relevant public by leading them to believe that machines affixed with those marks and sold by the defendant were those manufactured by the plaintiffs or connected to/associated with the plaintiffs.66Foot Note 66×SOC at paras 16, 18, 24, 26, 32 and 34. 35 The plaintiffs referred to the defendant’s sale of three machines (Offending Machines 4, 5 and 6), bearing the “DocuCentre” mark, as “BRAND NEW” in 2014. These could be traced to machines originally manufactured and put on the market in Malaysia and China by the 3rd plaintiff or its subsidiaries in 2014, and were not intended for any market outside those countries.67Foot Note 67×SOC at para 24(d).Offending Machines 4, 5 and 6 had their conditions altered from the original machines:inter alia, the firmware had been altered and the print-speed configuration had been altered to an increased setting. Copyright infringement 36 In respect of copyright infringement, the plaintiffs pleaded:68Foot Note 68×SOC at para 41. (a) primary infringement pursuant to s 26(1)(a)(v) of the Copyright Act by the making of an unlicensed adaptation of the plaintiffs’ software/firmware; (b) secondary infringement pursuant to s 32 of the Copyright Act, by importing an article into Singapore for the purpose of selling, letting for hire, offering or exposing for sale or hire, distributing itetcwithout the licence of the 3rd plaintiff when it knew or ought reasonably to have known that the making of the article was carried out without the consent of the 3rd plaintiff; and (c) secondary infringement pursuant to s 33 of the Copyright Act, by selling, letting for hire, offering or exposing for sale or hireetcwithout the licence of the 3rd plaintiff when it knew or ought reasonably to have known that the making of the article was carried out without the consent of the 3rd plaintiff. 37 Lastly, the plaintiffs pleaded their reliance on s 260 of the Copyright Act, alleging that the defendant had:69Foot Note 69×SOC at para 43. (a) knowingly removed or altered the rights management information embodied in the software/firmware without the 3rd plaintiff’s consent when it knew or ought reasonably to have known that the removal or alteration of the said rights management information would induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement; (b) distributed or imported for distribution the said rights management information which had been altered without the 3rd plaintiff’s consent, when the defendant knew that such alteration had been done without the 3rd plaintiff’s consent and when the defendant knew or ought reasonably to have known that the distribution or importation of the altered rights management information would induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement; and (c) distributed or imported for distribution copies of computer software/firmware in respect of which the rights management information had been removed or altered without the 3rd plaintiff’s consent, when the defendant knew that such removal or alteration had been done without the 3rd plaintiff’s consent and the defendant knew or ought reasonably to have known that the distribution or importation of the altered rights management information would induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement.",
        "The defendant’s case": "38 First, the defendant claimed that those of its photocopiers, printers and facsimile machines which bore the mark “ApeosPort” were imported into Singapore as parallel imports and that it was therefore entitled to rely on s 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act.70Foot Note 70×Defence at para 10.In response to the plaintiffs’ passing off claims, the defendant also raised the argument that these machines were parallel imports purchased from third party suppliers.71Foot Note 71×Defence at paras 27 and 37. 39 Next, the defendant claimed that the “ApeosPort” mark found on all its advertisements, catalogues and other commercial documents was “used to indicate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose or other characteristic of the photocopiers or any products bearing the mark “ApeosPort”, and that such use of the “ApeosPort” mark was “in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters” for the purposes of s 28(1) of the Trade Marks Act.72Foot Note 72×Defence at para 10. 40 As for the plaintiffs’ claims of copyright infringement, the defendant’s position was that it was not required to check or to know about the software installed in the machines it dealt with, nor did it have the technical know-how or means to modify any software/firmware. It denied making any adaption of the software/firmware or authorising anyone to do so, and said that it had no knowledge of – and no reason to know of – whether the adaptation was made and whether the article was made without the 3rd plaintiff’s consent. Lastly, the defendant alleged that the 3rd plaintiff had exhausted its rights to any copyright allegedly subsisting in the software/firmware when the machines containing that software/firmware were first put in the market by the 3rd plaintiff.73Foot Note 73×Defence at para 46.",
        "The issues to be determined": "41 The following issues arose for my determination: (a) Whether the defendant had infringed the registered trade mark “ApeosPort”; (b) Whether the defendant had passed off the “ApeosPort”, “DocuCentre” and “Fuji Xerox” marks as its own marks; and (c) Whether the defendant had infringed copyright under ss 32, 33 and/or 260 of the Copyright Act.",
        "Infringement of the registered “ApeosPort” mark": "42 I address first the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendant for infringement of the registered trade mark “ApeosPort”, in relation to Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3.",
        "Section 27(1) of the Trade Marks Act": "43 In order to establish the claim under s 27(1) of the Trade Marks Act, the plaintiffs have to prove that not only are their registered “ApeosPort” mark and the defendant’s mark identical, but that the goods in question are also identical.  Similarity in either aspect is not enough: anything less than complete identity will fail to satisfy the strict requirement of “double identity” under s 27(1) (see egthe judgment of the Court of Appeal (the “CA”) inCity Chain Stores (S) Pte Ltd v Louis Vuitton Malletier[2010] 1 SLR 382 (“City Chain Stores”) at [39]). 44 I found that although the plaintiffs’ “ApeosPort” mark and the mark used by the defendant were clearly identical, the parties’ photocopiers and other machines were not. The plaintiff’s counsel stated in the course of the trial that “[the defendant] is not selling the exact same machine because they have been modified.”74Foot Note 74×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 67, lines 10–11.This was also attested to by the defendant’s director, Poh Beng Leong (“Poh”).75Foot Note 75×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 52, lines 11–13.On the evidence adduced, it appeared that there were differences between the physical nature of the plaintiffs’ machines and the defendant’s, including up-speeding of machines, installation of step-down transformers, and replacement of original serial numbers with false serial numbers.76Foot Note 76×SOC at para 9(d). 45 In light of what the plaintiffs and the defendant both said, I did not find that the “double identity” required by s 27(1) of the Trade Marks Act had been established.",
        "Section 27(2) of the Trade Marks Act": "46 In the alternative, the plaintiffs relied on s 27(2) of the Trade Marks Act. Under s 27(2), it is enough for the plaintiffs to show that their registered mark is identical with or similar to the defendant’s mark, and that the defendant’s mark is used in relation to goods that are identical with or similar to those for which the plaintiffs’ trade mark was registered. 47 On the evidence adduced, including the various investigative reports put forward by the plaintiffs, I was satisfied that the plaintiffs were able to prove that their registered “ApeosPort” mark was identical with the mark used by the defendant; that the machines in question were similar, even if not identical; that the defendant was using its mark in the course of trade,ieas a badge of origin and not merely for descriptive purposes as it claimed in its amended defence; that the defendant was acting without the consent of the trade mark owner (the 3rd plaintiff); and that taking into account all the circumstances of the case, there existed a likelihood of confusion on the part of members of the public as to the origin of the machines. 48 First, the registered “ApeosPort” mark was clearly identical with the mark used by the defendant and the defendant admitted to using the “ApeosPort” mark in the course of trade.77Foot Note 77×Defence at para 10.This was also acknowledged in cross-examination by Poh, who stated that the defendant used the name “ApeosPort” because the machines “were named like this” and the defendant “just followed” to “call it by such because the machine is as such”.78Foot Note 78×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 51, lines 6–10; Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 67, lines 3–7. 49 Second, as to similarity of goods, section 27(2)(a) of the Trade Marks Act requires similarity between the goods or services for which the offending sign is used and those for which the trade mark is registered. InSarika ConnoisseurCafe Pte Ltd v Ferrero SpA[2013] 1 SLR 531 (“Sarika”), the appellant was sued by the respondent for infringement of the latter’s “Nutella” trade marks; in particular, the “Nutella” word mark in Class 30 of the International Classification Goods and Services in Singapore (“ICGS”). The respondent brought suit after the appellant introduced a gourmet coffee beverage, under the “Nutello” sign, which was made with ingredients that included the cocoa-based hazelnut spread marketed by the appellant under the brand name “Nutella”. The CA held that for the purpose of determining similarity of goods under section 27(2)(b) of the Trade Marks Act, the court needed to compare the appellant’s product not only with the actual Nutella product (iethe Nutella hazelnut spread), but also with the specification of the registration (ie“chocolate products”) (at [52]). In making a comparison between the appellant’s “Nutello” beverage and the “chocolate products” registration specification, the CA held that although the appellant’s “Nutello” beverage was introduced as a hot coffee beverage, it could be considered to fall within the “chocolate products” specification in view of evidence that various consumers had commented on its chocolate nature (at [53]). 50 In the present case, there was no dispute between the parties as to the similarity between the defendant’s Offending Machines and the products in the registration specification in which the “ApeosPort” trade mark is registered (which includes facsimile machines, printers for use with computers and computer softwareetc). 51 As for the comparison between the Offending Machines and the plaintiff’s actual goods, the original machines and the Offending Machines were both for the same use of photocopying, and the users of the original machines were in Japan, while the users of the Offending Machines were different parties in Singapore. I also found that Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 were of a similar physical nature to the original machines. Ms Yasuda’s September 2018 Investigation Report (see [29] above) foundinter aliathat each of these machines bore different machine labels from the original machine, had modified serial numbers, and were installed with step-down transformers. Despite these modifications, however, the Offending Machines still had the same characteristics and features as the original machines:eglike the original machines, they had a serial number, product code, and machine name, although these were modified, and they had the same components as the original machines,ega fuser assembly, although the genuine labels had been removed from those components.79Foot Note 79×AB Vol 6 at pp 1363, 1372 and 1383.The trade channels by which the original machines and the Offending Machines reached the market were of course different; the original machines were sold or leased by the plaintiffs to users in Japan, while the Offending Machines were sold by the defendant, who was not an authorised dealer of Fuji Xerox Equipment, to users in Singapore. Lastly, the defendant’s sale of these machines made it a “direct competitor[]” of the plaintiffs”, as stated by Poh himself.80Foot Note 80×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 54, lines 1–4. 52 Overall, I found that Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 were similar to the original machines. The fact that the users and trade channels for the Offending Machines differed from the users and trade channels for the original machines did not detract from my conclusion: in my view, this did not arise from the fact that the Offending Machines were dissimilar to the original machines, but from the defendant’s own acts of selling the Offending Machines to users in Singapore when the plaintiffs had never authorised these machines for sale in Singapore in the first place.81Foot Note 81×Yasuda AEIC at para 49. 53 Third, the defendant admitted in its Defence that it had been using the “ApeosPort” mark in the course of trade, including in advertising on its website and in its catalogues.82Foot Note 82×Defence at para 10.This was evidenced by the printouts and screenshots of the defendant’s website, which showed it offering machines for sale, lease or rent under the name “ApeosPort”.83Foot Note 83×AB Vol 5 at pp 1288–1290 (2 October 2017); AB Vol 9 at p 2273 (29 July 2019).The defendant’s website also stated,inter alia, that its “major products supplied include the FUJI Xerox ApeosPort series”.84Foot Note 84×AB Vol 9 at p 2271. 54 Fourth, I found that the defendant was using the “ApeosPort” mark in the course of trade without the consent of the 3rd plaintiff. Poh admitted this under cross-examination: “I didn’t get permission [from Fuji Xerox] because I will not be able to get permission from them.”85Foot Note 85×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 63, lines 29–31. 55 Lastly, on the element of likelihood of confusion, I note that the CA has made it clear that evidence of actual confusion is not required, and that the question of whether there is likely to be confusion is “ultimately one for the court rather than for witnesses” (Hai Tong Co (Pte) Ltd vVentree Singapore Pte Ltd and another and another appeal[2013] 2 SLR 941 (“Hai Tong”) at [99]). InHai Tong,which was a case involvinginter aliaa claim of secondary trade mark infringement under section 27(2)(b) of the Trade Marks Act, the CA noted that “finding and producing actual evidence of confusion may be difficult as members of the public are generally reluctant to attend proceedings in court”, and held that “while evidence of actual confusion can be very helpful, its absence should not be accorded undue significance” (at [100]). In assessing the likelihood of confusion, there are “three specific elements that plainly must be considered” (at [85(c)], in view of the express terms of section 27(2): … These are: (i) the similarity between the registered mark and the allegedly infringing mark; (ii) the similarity or identity between the goods or services in relation to which the marks are used; and (iii) the relevant segment of the public in relation to whom the court must consider the likelihood of confusion.  Each of these elements can vary. The marks may be identical or similar, and if the latter, they can vary in their degree of similarity. In the same way, the goods or services in relation to which the marks are used may be identical or similar, and again, if the latter, they may vary in the degree or extent to which they are similar. In assessing the degree of similarity, it may be appropriate to have regard to steps that have been taken to differentiate the goods or services. And as to the relevant segment of the public, there may be characteristics that are particular to the group in question. Each of these factors will have a bearing on the likelihood of confusion. As an illustrative proposition, the likelihood of confusion must be greater where, say, the contesting marks are similar to a high degree, the goods are identical in nature and the segment of the public in question is undistinguished in its attention than would be the case if the marks and the goods are somewhat similar but not exceedingly so, and the relevant segment of the public happens to be highly knowledgeable and very fastidious. … 56 In the present case, the marks used by the plaintiff and the defendant were identical, and their machines were highly similar. As to the relevant segment of the public, I did not think there was any real dispute that this would mainly be comprised of businesses and commercial entities requiring office equipment of a not particularly specialised nature: the machines in question are not, after all, sophisticated scientific or medical equipment or specialised tools.  It did not appear to me that the relevant segment of the public in this case would be “highly knowledgeable and very fastidious”. In the circumstances, I found that the likelihood of confusion would be high. 57 Given that the competing marks were identical and the competing goods sufficiently similar such that having regard to the characteristics of the likely consumer, there would be a likelihood of confusion, it was not necessary – and indeed, it would not be permissible – to have regard to yet further extraneous considerations that might have the effect of diminishing the likelihood of confusion:perthe CA inStaywell Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Starwood Hotels& Resorts Worldwide, Inc and another and another appeal[2014] 1 SLR 911 (at [85]–[86]). 58 For the reasons set out above at [46] to [57], I was satisfied that the plaintiffs had made out their case of infringement of the “ApeosPort” mark under section 27(2)(a) of the Trade Marks Act.",
        "Section 28(1) of the Trade Marks Act: Descriptive marks": "59 In arriving at these conclusions, I considered the defendant’s attempt to invoke s 28(1) of the Trade Marks Act. The defendant submitted that its use of the “ApeosPort” mark on advertisements and other commercial document was “in a purely descriptive manner” in relation to the series and model of the machines to better enable the machines to be distinguished and identified, that its use of the “ApeosPort” mark was in accordance with honest practices to indicate to the public that it sold, repaired or maintained certain machines and that it had never informed customers it was an authorised reseller of the plaintiffs’ or that it was in any way connected to the plaintiffs.86Foot Note 86×Defendant’s Closing Submissions dated 26 February 2021 (“DCS”) at paras 100, 104–106. 60 I found the defendant’s reliance on s 28(1) to be entirely baseless and without merit. 61 First, it was telling that even in its amended Defence, the defendant pleaded its reliance on s 28(1) in the broadest and vaguest of terms, without even trying to particularise those characteristics of its machines which it claimed the mark was descriptive of. It merely asserted that the mark “ApeosPort” was used to indicate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose or other characteristic of the products bearing the mark “ApeosPort”.87Foot Note 87×Defence at para 10. 62 Second, in the evidence put forward by the defendant, there was similarly no coherent effort to flesh out its attempt to invoke s 28(1). 63 Third, as the plaintiffs pointed out, “ApeosPort” is an invented set of words: it is difficult, if not impossible, to see how it is descriptive of a characteristic such as kind, quality, quantity, or intended purpose.88Foot Note 88×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions dated 26 February 2021 (“PCS”) at paras 9 and 32.In any event, the defendant appeared to me to have made little – if any – genuine effort to substantiate its purported reliance on s 28(1) of the Trade Marks Act. In fact, the defendant stated in its written submissions that it did not dispute the plaintiff’s “ApeosPort” mark was distinctive.89Foot Note 89×DCS at para 111.Having accepted this, and having stated that it was using the mark to “better enable the machines to be distinguished and identified”, the defendant could not maintain that its use of the mark was “purely descriptive in nature”. 64 Lastly, having invoked s 28(1), the defendant also had the onus of satisfying me that its allegedly descriptive use of the “ApeosPort” mark was “in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters”. In this connection, the CA has held inThe Audience Motivation Company Asia Pte Ltd v AMC Live Group China (S) Pte Ltd[2016] 3 SLR 517 (“AMC Live”) that the “honest practices” proviso “calls for an objective inquiry that examines and assesses the defendant’s conduct in the light of standards and practices commonly applied in the business or industry”, while at the same time also examining “whether the particular motivations and intentions of the defendant were honest”. In its judgment, the CA emphasised that “as an evidentiary matter, each element must be weighed, on a balance of probabilities, on the basis of a reasonable evaluation of the evidence and not on the subjective and inevitably self-serving pronouncements of the defendant” (at [57]). That last reminder by the CA is highly useful in this case because, on the subject of “honest practices”, the defendant also failed entirely to adduce any evidence, let alone any credible evidence. I would add that Poh’s bare assertions about industry practice counted for nothing90Foot Note 90×SeeegTranscript, 6 January 2021 at p 56, lines 19–28; Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 26, lines 9–20 and p 52, line 29–p 53, line 19.as they plainly fell into the category of “subjective and inevitably self-serving pronouncements of the defendant”.",
        "Section 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act: Parallel imports defence": "65 As to the defendant’s attempt to invoke s 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act, I found this to be equally baseless and without merit. The parties’ submissions 66 The defendant submitted that Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 were parallel imports, and that accordingly it could rely on the defence under s 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act.91Foot Note 91×DCS at para 49.Section 29 states: Exhaustion of rights conferred by registered trade mark 29.—(1) Notwithstanding section 27, a registered trade mark is not infringed by the use of the trade mark in relation to goods which have been put on the market, whether in Singapore or outside Singapore, under that trade mark by the proprietor of the registered trade mark or with his express or implied consent (conditional or otherwise). (2) Subsection (1) does not apply where — (a) the condition of the goods has been changed or impaired after they have been put on the market; and (b) the use of the registered trade mark in relation to those goods has caused dilution in an unfair manner of the distinctive character of the registered trade mark. 67 The defendant argued that Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 had been put on the market by the 3rd plaintiff or with its express or implied consent,92Foot Note 92×DCS at paras 52, 56–57.and that the plaintiffs had not provided evidence of changes to the conditions of these machines after they had been put on the market.93Foot Note 93×DCS at para 59.While the defendant accepted that the original Japanese-language front operation panel and precautions label had been removed and replaced with a non-original English language panel and label, and that rear data plates bearing,inter alia, the original serial number had been removed and a step-down transformer had been incorporated, it said there was no clear evidence that the firmware, print-speed configuration, and rights managements information had been altered.94Foot Note 94×DCS at para 61.The defendant argued that the plaintiffs had incorrectly determined the original conditions of these machines by deriving the serial number from replaceable and interchangeable parts of the Offending Machines such as the fuser assembly, and that it was possible that the fuser assembly components on these machines were not original parts but had come from other machines.95Foot Note 95×DCS at paras 66–67.Lastly, it submitted that the use of the “ApeosPort” mark had not caused dilution in an unfair manner either by “blurring” or “tarnishment”.96Foot Note 96×DCS at paras 83 and 85. 68 The plaintiffs, for their part, submitted that the defendant traded in machines where the conditions were extensively changed or altered after they were first put on the market.97Foot Note 97×PCS at para 237.No independent third party had acquired the right of disposal of the plaintiffs’ goods in the market where the machines were put: for used Fuji Xerox Equipment, once the machines were withdrawn from the market, they were to be destroyed.98Foot Note 98×PCS at para 238.The defendant offered no evidence at all that its alleged suppliers had acquired the right of disposal of the plaintiffs’ goods in the market where the machines were put.99Foot Note 99×PCS at para 239. The law 69 Under section 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act, goods are “put on the market” when an “independent third party has acquired the right of disposal of the goods bearing the trade mark”, and this must be an act that simultaneously allows the proprietor of the trade mark to realise the commercial or economic value of the trade-marked goods, and deprives him of the right to control the subsequent exploitation of the goods. Such an act includes, but is not limited to, a sale of the goods by the proprietor to the third party (Samsonite IP HoldingsSarl v An Sheng Trading Pte Ltd[2017] 4 SLR 99 (“Samsonite”) at [100]). The goods must have been first put on the market with the consent of the proprietor of the trade mark. Even if the proprietor’s consent to the first putting on the market is conditional and not unqualified, it will still be treated as valid consent under s 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act (Samsoniteat [140]). Applying the law to the facts 70 I found the defendant’s account of the sources from which it allegedly acquired its machines as parallel imports to be glib, riddled with inconsistencies, and frankly unbelievable. (1) The defendant’s lack of supplier information and purchase orders 71 First, I found it highly suspicious – and quite telling – that despite its repeated claims about being a genuine parallel importer, the defendant gave discovery of only a very small number of documents allegedly related to its purchase and importation of the machines – none of which I found in the least credible or helpful in shoring up its defence of parallel imports. Poh’s various explanations under cross-examination only added to these suspicions. For example, Poh claimed that he had communicated with the suppliers via WhatsApp messages – but no such WhatsApp messages were disclosed. This total lack of supporting evidence was then said by Poh to be due to his having changed his mobile number and his purported ignorance that “such messages could be used or disclosed”.100Foot Note 100×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 44, lines 15–17.When asked to disclose the identity of the defendant’s current supplier, Poh was evasive: he would not disclose any supplier details and would only say that the defendant had stopped purchasing Fuji Xerox photocopiers in 2019. He even claimed that he “did not import but [he] had businesses with local leasing companies like Oryx and Ethos” and would “purchase when it’s necessary” – a claim which had never been mentioned in his AEIC.101Foot Note 101×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 72, line 32–p 73, line 20. 72 Further, when asked to describe how the defendant would conduct the “detailed supplier evaluations” mentioned in his AEIC,102Foot Note 102×Poh AEIC at para 9.Poh’s reply was:103Foot Note 103×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 51, line 31–p 52 line 3. I don’t know how to answer. In the normal circumstances, the suppliers will come through referrals. We will establish contact and then give them a contract with a small-scale purchase, and then verify that the company is existent, and then pay them. That’s about it. Having made these claims about giving potential suppliers “a contract with a small-scale purchase”, Poh then claimed that he had not disclosed any documentation in respect of these “supplier evaluations” because he “didn’t know that this small trial order had to be disclosed”.104Foot Note 104×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 53, line 13.Poh’s excuses were unbelievable because the court order dated 7 August 2019 in HC/SUM 3440/2019 specifically ordered the defendant to give discovery of “all correspondences between the supplier(s) and PTC” and “invoices between the supplier(s) and PTC”. 73 Despite being one of the defendant’s directors, and, on his own evidence, the person who oversaw the defendant’s business operations,105Foot Note 105×Poh AEIC at para 5; Supplementary AEIC of Poh dated 28 July 2020 (“Poh Supplementary AEIC”) at para 19.Poh was similarly unable to give a coherent explanation of whether, when the defendant ordered Fuji Xerox photocopiers, it had issued documentary purchase orders – or not. Initially, Poh asserted that there “ought to be documents when purchasing Fuji Xerox copiers”. After making this assertion, however, he quickly backpedaled and said: “Sometimes we would not use purchase orders. In fact, we don’t use purchase orders, because we would discuss, and then come to an agreement…”106Foot Note 106×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 58, lines 22–23 and p 58 line 31–p 59 line 2. 74 I found Poh to be a shifty and deceitful witness. His inability to give any coherent evidence about the defendant’s supplier information and its operations was highly damaging to the credibility of its parallel importing claim. This impression was only strengthened by Poh’s evidence on each of the Offending Machines. (2) Evidence on Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 75 The defendant allegedly bought Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 on 5 February 2016, 4 March 2016 and 13 May 2016 respectively from Digital Junction OA Solution (“Digital Junction”), a Malaysian company – as can be seen from the invoices and payment vouchers.107Foot Note 107×AB Vol 21 at pp 5615–5616 (February 2016), 5617–5618 (March 2016) and 5619–5620 (13 May 2016); Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 62, lines 4–10.However, as attested to by Ms Batchelor,108Foot Note 108×Transcript, 15 July 2020 at p 19, lines 31–32.and as shown by the company searches, there were no company or business records to be found for Digital Junction.109Foot Note 109×AB Vol 30 at p 8101; Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 9, lines 16–20.Poh admitted that he also had not found any company registry records for Digital Junction, although he insisted – without offering any reasons – that “[b]y me not finding about the company, it does not mean that the company does not exist”.110Foot Note 110×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 69, lines 7–13. 76 The plaintiffs also referred to several invoices dated 9 October 2014, 21 November 2015, 4 May 2017 and 6 November 2017 from Fortune OA Solution (“Fortune OA”), which – based on the address on the invoice – was apparently located next door to Digital Junction.111Foot Note 111×AB Vol 21 at pp 5611–5612 (9 October 2014), 5613–5614 (21 November 2015), 5621–5622 (4 May 2017) and 5623–5624 (6 November 2017); compare address with AB Vol 21 at p 5615.Based on the Malaysian company registration documents, Fortune OA was registered on 6 April 2015, and the registration expired on 5 April 2018.112Foot Note 112×AB Vol 9 at p 2268.Poh conceded that this meant Fortune OA was not officially registered in Malaysia at the time the defendant purportedly transacted with it in 2014, but claimed that he “didn’t take note” of this at the time.113Foot Note 113×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 74, line 14. 77 Again, I found Poh’s evidence about Digital Junction and Fortune OA to be entirely unbelievable, especially considering his own testimony that part of the defendant’s “supplier evaluations” involved “verify[ing] that the company is existent”.114Foot Note 114×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 52, line 2.I did not accept that Digital Junction and Fortune OA were legitimate third-party suppliers from whom the defendant had purchased the machines. 78 Poh was also referred to several invoices from Nagatomo Co Ltd (“Nagatomo”), a Japanese company, which he claimed had sold some items to Quest Tech International (“Quest Tech”), a Singapore company, which had in turn sold them to the defendant.115Foot Note 115×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 75, lines 14–15; p 76, lines 12–15.Poh was referred to a Nagatomo invoice to Quest Tech with a printed date of 26 November 2013 and a handwritten date of 17 December 2013 (which showed that a total of $16,559.30 was paid by Quest Tech to Nagatomo116Foot Note 116×AB Vol 23 at p 6077.), as well as a corresponding Quest Tech invoice to the defendant dated 17 December 2013 (which showed that a total of $16,559.30 was paid to Quest Tech by the latter).117Foot Note 117×AB Vol 21 at p 5609.There was also another invoice from Nagatomo to Quest Tech with a printed date of 21 April 2014 and a handwritten date of 9 May 2014, showing that Quest Tech paid Nagatomo $86,475.60,118Foot Note 118×AB Vol 23 at p 6078.and a corresponding invoice from Quest Tech to the defendant dated 9 May 2014, showing the latter had paid $86,475.60 to Quest Tech.119Foot Note 119×AB Vol 21 at p 5610.It was evident from a comparison of the invoices that Quest Tech had not made any profit from either transaction, since PTC paid Quest Tech exactly the same amount as the amount paid by Quest Tech to Nagatomo. 79 When asked if he agreed that Quest Tech had not made any profit at all from these transactions, Poh’s reply was again revealing in its evasiveness:120Foot Note 120×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 77, lines 4–9. A: That could be the case. What I can imagine is that sometimes a customer made---might have made an order, but in the end decided not to carry on with the order. Sothey just decided to sell the machines. Ct:Who decides just to sell the machine? Who are you talking about? A:I don’t know. [emphasis added] It was only when Poh was pressed further in cross-examination that it emerged that Quest Tech was actually a company set up by his wife Png Beng Kuan (“Png”) and her friend, and that his wife Png had also become a director of the defendant on 27 April 2015.121Foot Note 121×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 78, line 6–p 79, line 1.Astonishingly, Poh had not seen fit to disclose in his AEIC that the director of Quest Tech was his wife.122Foot Note 122×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 78, line 25–p 79, line 1; Poh Supplementary AEIC at para 19; AB Vol 30 at pp 8097–8098. 80 Poh’s belated admission in cross-examination about Quest Tech having been established by his wife supported the inference that Quest Tech was – as the plaintiffs’ counsel put it – a “puppet” for the defendant.123Foot Note 123×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 78, lines 4–5; AB Vol 30 at pp 8097–8098.As Poh himself said (rather ironically): “If PTC were the real purchasers, then Nagamoto [sic] could have just directly issued invoices to PTC. Why go through Quest Tech?”124Foot Note 124×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 79, lines 10–11.Plainly, the defendant went through Quest Tech to obfuscate its shady dealings in respect of the Offending Machines. As with Digital Junction and Fortune OA, therefore, I rejected the defendant’s assertion that Quest Tech was a legitimate third-party supplier. (3) Whether goods had been put on the market with the plaintiffs’ consent 81 Having regard to my assessment of the evidence adduced, I rejected the defendant’s assertion that Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 had been put on the market under the “ApeosPort” mark with the express or implied consent of the plaintiffs (s 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act). 82 First, for the reasons set out in [71] to [80] above, I did not believe that the defendant’s alleged suppliers even existed at the time the defendant purportedly transacted with them. If they were not in existence, then they could not have been the “independent third parties” who “acquired the right of disposal” of the relevant Offending Machines (Samsoniteat [100]). I also did not accept that the defendant’s purported suppliers had done any acts to allow the plaintiffs to realise the commercial or economic value of the machines. It was not shown, for instance, that the plaintiffs had sold Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 to these alleged suppliers for a profit (Samsoniteat [104]). 83 Second, the plaintiffs clearly did not consent to Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 being diverted to the defendant (Samsoniteat [142]). In this regard, the restrictions imposed by the plaintiffs were highly relevant to determining the relevant market, and the question of consent (express or implied) must be related to the market (Samsoniteat [146]). In the present case, the plaintiffs’ account was that Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 were originally sold or leased in Japan; none of them were authorised for sale in Singapore (see [14] above).125Foot Note 125×AB Vol 6 at p 1356; Yasuda AEIC at para 49.Ms Yasuda similarly testified that sales offices and authorised dealers of Fuji Xerox Equipment were not permitted to sell their machines beyond their own countries.126Foot Note 126×Transcript, 5 January 2021 at p 9, lines 24–25.Ms Batchelor also testified:127Foot Note 127×Transcript, 15 July 2020 at p 11, line 27–p 12, line 2. … So majority of our machines, once when the customer returns or if we upgrade to a higher machine,the machines are taken back and disposed of. But for certain---if there is a requirement for these machines to be refurbished, we have a very high, stringent standard and quality to meet to refurbish the machines that we think can be or would be refurbished. But our policy mer---is to actually dispose the machines. [emphasis added] Based on the restrictions imposed by the plaintiffs, I found that the putting of the goods on the market didnotoccur when the plaintiffs supplied Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 to their authorised dealers in Japan: the plaintiffs could, and did, legitimately impose restrictions on its Japanese dealers as to how the machines were to be distributed (Samsoniteat [146]). Nor could it be said that the machines were put on the market when they came into the hands of the defendant’s alleged suppliers, since (as I have said earlier) there was no evidence that these alleged suppliers were legitimate independent third parties who had acquired the right of disposal of the goods, nor evidence that profits from these transactions were passed on to the plaintiffs as the proprietor of the “ApeosPort” mark (Samsoniteat [104]). 84 In the circumstances, I found that the defendant could not rely on the defence of parallel imports under s 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act in relation to Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3. Section 29(2) of the Trade Marks Act 85 Further, even if Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 had been put on the market, I accepted the plaintiffs’ evidence about the changes made to the Offending Machines; and I was satisfied that the proviso in s 29(2) would apply so as to preclude the defendant from relying on s 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act in relation to Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3. I accepted that the condition of these machines had been changed after they had been put on the market, and the use of the “ApeosPort” mark in relation to those goods had caused dilution in an unfair manner of the distinctive character of the registered “ApeosPort” mark. (1) The condition of Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 had been changed 86 First, as noted earlier, the defendant did not dispute that the original Japanese-language front operation panel and precautions label had been removed and replaced with a non-original English-language panel and label, that rear data plates bearing,inter alia, the original serial number had been removed, and that a step-down transformer had been incorporated. The defendant sought to argue, however, that there was no clear evidence that the firmware, print-speed configuration, and rights managements information had been altered.128Foot Note 128×DCS at paras 60–61. 87 In this regard, the defendant submitted that the plaintiffs’ investigative methods were unreliable. The plaintiffs had ascertained the original information of Offending Machines 1 and 2 with reference to the barcodes found on the fuser assembly, while for Offending Machine 3, this was ascertained with reference to the barcodes on the power supply board assembly.129Foot Note 129×AB Vol 6 at pp 1363, 1372 and 1384; Yasuda AEIC at paras 58, 73, 89 (for Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3), 107, 119 and 133 (for Offending Machines 4, 5 and 6); Transcript, 5 January 2021 at p 21, lines 15–18.In gist, the defendant argued that the plaintiffs had incorrectly determined the original conditions of these machines by deriving the serial number from replaceable and interchangeable parts of the Offending Machines: it was possible (or so the defendant claimed) that these were not original parts but came from other machines.130Foot Note 130×DCS at paras 66–67. 88 In respect of Offending Machine 1, the defendant’s counsel suggested during the trial that the “fuser assembly” or “heater unit” from another machine (the “Saitama Machine”) had been placed into Offending Machine 1, and that the Saitama Machine had been destroyed.131Foot Note 131×Transcript, 5 January 2021 at p 27, lines 9–25; DCS at paras 186 and 188.Counsel also suggested that since Ms Yasuda had not requested for the scrapping records of the Saitama Machine, and there was no report of any thefts, the Saitama Machine must have been decommissioned and destroyed.132Foot Note 132×Transcript, 5 January 2021 at p 25, line 11–p 26, line 10.I did not see any evidential basis for this suggestion. While the defendant argued that it was “possible”that the fuser assembly on the Saitama Machine had been removed and attached to Offending Machine 1,133Foot Note 133×DCS at paras 67 and 188–189.this was mere speculation on its part. Further, Ms Yasuda testified that Fuji Xerox and its dealers would use “brand new” parts for any replacement,134Foot Note 134×Transcript, 5 January 2021 at p 19, lines 22–32.and that while it was physically possible to swap the fuser assemblies of two identical machines, this was not a practice that was recognised.135Foot Note 135×Transcript, 4 January 2021 at p 22, lines 7–15.I found that the findings in the September 2018 Report in respect of Offending Machine 1 were reliable:ie,the product name for Offending Machine 1 had in fact been changed from AP4C2270 to AP4C3370, the product code had been changed from NC100342 to NC500341, and the serial number had been changed from 788168 to 855300.136Foot Note 136×AB Vol 6 at p 1356. 89 As for Offending Machine 2, the defendant’s counsel suggested that the “heater unit” in the machine, also known as the fuser assembly unit, had in fact been changed by the defendant. He referred to a service history report dated 4 April 2018 that stated “REPLACED HEATER UNIT”.137Foot Note 137×AB Vol 10 at p 2469.However, as Ms Yasuda pointed out, there was no indication whether the “HEATER UNIT” mentioned in the report was in fact the fuser assembly which the plaintiffs referred to in deriving the machine’s original information.138Foot Note 138×Transcript, 5 January 2021 at p 42, lines 17–30.The technician who was said to have replaced this heater unit was not called as a witness by the defendant.139Foot Note 139×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 59, lines 28–30.As Poh himself acknowledged, “many components [in the Fuji Xerox Equipment] are related to heaters”.140Foot Note 140×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 60, lines 1–14.Lastly, as the plaintiffs pointed out, this was also an admission by the defendant that it had indeed changed components in Offending Machine 2.141Foot Note 141×Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions dated 26 March 2021 (“PRS”) at para 37.In the circumstances, I accepted the plaintiffs’ findings in the September 2018 Report that the product name had indeed been changed from DC4C4475 to AP4C4475 (ieit was changed from a DocuCentre machine to an ApeosPort machine), and the serial number had been changed from 310612 to 302040.142Foot Note 142×AB Vol 6 at p 1356. 90 Finally, for Offending Machine 3, the defendant conceded that referring to the barcodes on the Power Supply Board Assembly was a reliable method of investigation, as this was a part that was not easily interchangeable or subject to common wear-and-tear.143Foot Note 143×DCS at para 180.In the defendant’s configuration report dated 16 May 2016, the defendant recorded that the machine model was ApeosPort-IV C5575, the serial number was 607738, the product code was NC100426, and the Controller ROM was “Ver 1.31.14”.144Foot Note 144×AB Vol 10 at p 2440.In the plaintiffs’ September 2018 Report, they recorded the machine model as ApeosPort-IV C5575, the serial number as 629586 and the product code as NC100411.145Foot Note 145×AB Vol 6 at p 1382.According to Ms Yasuda, by the time the 1st plaintiff acquired Offending Machine 3 from GMC around 12 December 2017, the serial number had reverted to the original, genuine serial number of 629586: this “could probably be due to the software having been reset.146Foot Note 146×Yasuda AEIC at para 190.Her evidence was that the software version “Ver 1.31.14” as stated in the defendant’s configuration report from 16 May 2016 did not exist at the time: this software version was only released in August 2016. As such, the machine must have been tampered with.147Foot Note 147×Transcript, 5 January 2021, at p 61, lines 23–32; Plaintiffs’ Further Submissions dated 12 May 2021 (“PFS”) at p 15, para 36(c)(iii).Based on Ms Yasuda’s evidence, which I found credible, I accepted that the serial number of the machine had been changed, that the Controller ROM software version “Ver 1.31.14” reflected in the defendant’s configuration report from May 2016 did not in fact exist at that time, and that the software must therefore have been modified. (2) Dilution in an unfair manner 91 Lastly, I found that the use of the “ApeosPort” mark on Offending Machines 1 to 3 had caused dilution in an unfair manner of the distinctive character of the “ApeosPort” mark. 92 “Dilution” refers to the lessening of the capacity of the trade mark to identify and distinguish goods or services, regardless of whether there is any competition between the plaintiffs and defendant or any likelihood of confusion on the part of the public (s 2(1) of the Trade Marks Act). In this regard, the CA inSarikahas said that the essence of dilution is “the weakening of the mark’s ability to identify goods” (at [96]), and that it is sufficient to show a real or serious probability of damage to the mark’s advertising quality or symbolic function to establish a dilution claim (at [94]). 93 I found that dilution by blurring was made out on the facts, as the relevant public would make a connection or establish a “link” between the defendant’s use of the “ApeosPort” mark and the plaintiffs’ “ApeosPort” mark (Sarikaat [99]–[100]). In fact, the defendant’s own submissions stated that the public would have “no difficulty” associating the machines sold by the defendant with the plaintiffs.148Foot Note 148×DCS at para 83.First, given the invented nature of the word “ApeosPort” and its distinctive quality, it would be easier to establish such a link. Second, there was reproduction to a substantial extent of the word “ApeosPort” in the defendant’s use of the mark – either in whole (“ApeosPort”) or with minimal variation (“Apeosport”/“ApoesPort”). Lastly, as the defendant’s Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 were similar to the plaintiffs’ original machines, it was extremely likely that consumers would draw a “mental link” between the defendant’s use of the sign and the plaintiffs’ “ApeosPort” mark. 94 In summary, the plaintiffs were successful in making out their claim of trade mark infringementvis-à-visthe “ApeosPort” registration.",
        "Passing off": "",
        "ApeosPort mark": "95 I next address the plaintiffs’ claim of passing-offvis-à-visthe “ApeosPort” mark, in relation to Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3. To succeed in its claim of passing-off, the plaintiffs must prove the classic trinity of goodwill, misrepresentation and damage (perthe CA inAMC Liveat [80]). Goodwill 96 On the element of goodwill, “[t]he court’s concern is whether there exists any attractive force in the plaintiff’s business that brings in custom”; and at this stage of the inquiry, the court does not inquire whether the plaintiff’s goodwill is associated with a name or mark (AMC Liveat [81]–[82]). As the CA observed inAMC(at [83]), “if the inquiry as to whether the plaintiff’s goodwill is associated with a name or mark is analysed at the goodwill stage, there is a risk of conflating the issue of goodwill with the separate issue of whether there has been misrepresentation and consequently, damage to the goodwill of the plaintiff’s business”. 97 In the present case, the defendant did not mount any challenge to the plaintiffs’ assertion of the existence of goodwill. In any event, there was more than enough evidence to establish such goodwill: seeegthe plaintiffs’ evidence of the sales revenue149Foot Note 149×SOC at para 15(b); AEIC of Sim Seok Seah dated 22 June 2020 (“Sim AEIC”) at paras 7–8; AB Vol 9 at pp 2345–2359.and marketing expenditure for Fuji Xerox Equipment in Singapore between 2010 and 2017.150Foot Note 150×SOC at para 15(c); Sim AEIC at para 26. 98 Goodwill can be limited to particular sections of the public:perthe CA inNovelty Pte Ltd vAmanresorts Ltd and another[2009] 3 SLR(R) 216 (“Amanresorts(CA)”) at [44]. In the present case, I did not understand the plaintiffs to be claiming goodwillvis-à-visthe public at large in Singapore: rather, the relevant sector of the public in Singapore would be actual and potential customers of the plaintiffs’ machines, who would primarily come from businesses and commercial entities that had need of office equipment such as printers, facsimile machines and other such goods – businesses much like GMC, Raymond Ng & Associates, and the other companies which featured in the plaintiffs’ investigations. Misrepresentation 99 As to the element of misrepresentation, this would be established by proof that the defendant’s machines were held out to be, or to be connected with, those of the plaintiff’s business (AMC Liveat [86]). The primary question was whether the defendant’s use of the “ApeosPort” mark would lead the relevant segment of the public to believe that the machines supplied by the defendant were actually machines supplied by the plaintiffs (or machines supplied with the plaintiffs’ authorisation and consent), or that the defendant was economically related to the plaintiffs. 100 The defendant argued that it had never advertised or informed customers that it was an authorised reseller of the plaintiffs’ or that it was connected to the plaintiffs.151Foot Note 151×DCS at para 113.Its company name (PTC) and contact details could be found on its machines and its tax invoices. This indicated that the defendant was the party supplying the machines. Conversely, there was nothing to indicate that it was acting on behalf of the plaintiffs.152Foot Note 152×DCS at paras 117–118. 101 The plaintiffs submitted, however, that the defendant used business identifiers that were identical to the inherently distinctive badges of origin belonging to the plaintiffs, and that there was accordingly a likelihood of confusion.153Foot Note 153×PCS at paras 109–110. 102 Having regard to the evidence before me, I also found the element of misrepresentation to be proven. In this connection, “the court must, at a threshold level, consider whether the [plaintiffs’] goodwill is sufficiently associated with its name or the marks that it uses” (AMCLiveat [87]). The defendant in this case did not seriously dispute that the plaintiffs’ goodwill was sufficiently associated with its “ApeosPort” mark. Indeed, Poh agreed in cross-examination that the plaintiffs have goodwill in Singapore in the “ApeosPort” mark154Foot Note 154×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 64, lines 12–15.; and there was in any event ample evidence of the plaintiffs’ sales revenue from their “ApeosPort” machines in Singapore between 2006 and 2017.155Foot Note 155×SOC at para 15(b); PCS at para 46; AB Vol 9 at pp 2345–2348. 103 Next, the alleged misrepresentation “must be analysed from the perspective of those who have goodwill in the plaintiff’s get-up” (City Chainat [73]); and it must be asked whether those people in Singapore with goodwill towards the plaintiffs’ machines believed that the defendant’s machines were those manufactured, imported, distributed, sold, leased, serviced or marketed by the plaintiffs, and/or were connected to or associated with the plaintiffs. As I noted earlier (at [98]), the specific section of the public which had goodwill towards the “ApeosPort” mark would be potential and actual customers –iebusinesses and commercial entities – who required the photocopiers, printers and other machines for their office use. The misrepresentations must be analysed from their perspective. Based on the evidence adduced, I was satisfied that there was misrepresentation to the relevant section of the public. 104Inter aliaand in particular, as I noted earlier, the screenshots of the defendant’s website showed that it was offering machines for sale, lease or rent under the name “ApeosPort”.156Foot Note 156×AB Vol 5 at pp 1288–1290 (2 October 2017); AB Vol 9 at p 2273 (29 July 2019).The defendant’s website also stated that its “major products supplied include the FUJI Xerox ApeosPort series”.157Foot Note 157×AB Vol 9 at p 2271.It is trite that a misrepresentation is actionable under the law of passing off only if it gives rise to confusion:Amanresorts(CA)at [77]. While there was no evidence that persons in Singapore with goodwill towards the plaintiffs’ machines were confused in actual fact by the defendant’s use of the “ApeosPort” mark on its machines, the lack of such evidence was not fatal to the plaintiffs’ claim.  Instead, “the court is entitled to consider whether the average reasonable person, with characteristics reflective of the relevant section of the public as identified under the examination of goodwill, is likely to be confused by the [defendant’s] misrepresentation” (City Chainat [79]). Given that the sign used by the defendant wasidenticalto the plaintiffs’ mark, and the fact that the plaintiffs and defendant were in the same business of selling photocopiers (Amanresorts(CA)at [82] and [84]), I found that the average reasonable person would likely be confused, as he or she would form the impression that the defendant was offering machines supplied by the plaintiffs or was related to the plaintiffs’ business. Damage 105 As to the element of damage, the test for damage in passing off cases is either actual or probable damage to the plaintiff’s goodwill (Amanresorts(CA) at [94]). 106 The plaintiffs submitted that they had been damaged by both “blurring” and “tarnishment”. “Blurring” would mean that the plaintiffs’ get-up had become indicative of the defendant’s goods or services, resulting in a diversion of sales from the plaintiffs to the defendant: this could be inferred if the parties were in direct competition. “Tarnishment” would mean that the defendant’s goods and services were of a worse quality than the plaintiff’s, and customers would think the plaintiff was the source of those poor quality goods: this too could be inferred if the defendant sold heavily modified, refurbished, old and obsolete machines more prone to wear and tear (Amanresorts(CA)at [97]–[98]).158Foot Note 158×PCS at paras 155 and 157. 107 The defendant claimed that its practice was to “check the photocopiers for functionality and errors for used machines”: if the machines were beyond repair, it would scrap the machine and salvage the spare parts. According to the defendant, there was no evidence that Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 were more prone to wear and tear.159Foot Note 159×DCS at paras 89–90.The get-up remained indicative of the plaintiffs’ goods, and not that of the defendant’s, so there was no damage by blurring.160Foot Note 160×DCS at para 124. 108 On the basis of the evidence adduced, I found that the element of damage too was made out. 109 A likelihood of blurring is readily inferred where parties are in direct competition with each other:Allergan, Inc and another vFerlandz Nutra Pte Ltd[2016] 4 SLR 919 at [210]. In this regard, Poh admitted that the defendant was a direct competitor of the plaintiffs.161Foot Note 161×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 54, lines 1–4.In the circumstances, I accepted that there had been dilution by “blurring”. Poh also testified that the defendant dealt with “second-hand machines” which had been used for three to five years and which were then refurbished by the defendant.162Foot Note 162×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 55, lines 20–23.He admitted that old used machines would generally be more prone to wear and tear, technical faults and errors than new machines.163Foot Note 163×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 40, lines 19–22.He further admitted that the defendant would repair these second-hand machines using spare parts from other used machines – and it would not tell its customers that it had done so.164Foot Note 164×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 39, line 24–p 40 line 12.Given these facts, it could be inferred that the machines sold by the defendant were of lower quality than the plaintiffs’ original machines, since, on Poh’s own admission, they were more prone to breaking down. Moreover, due to the defendant’s use of the “ApeosPort” mark, buyers of those machines would think the plaintiffs were the source of those low-quality goods. In the circumstances, I also found for the plaintiffs on their claim of tarnishment. Parallel imports 110 In arriving at these conclusions, I considered the defendant’s attempt to rely on the defence of parallel imports in relation to the plaintiffs’ passing off claims for the “ApeosPort” mark.165Foot Note 165×Defence at para 19.The parallel importation of genuine goods does not constitute passing off:SinHeak Hin Pte Ltd and another v Yuasa Battery Singapore Co Pte Ltd[1995] 3 SLR(R) 123 at [82]. 111 For reasons similar to those I alluded to earlier in dealing with the defendant’s reliance on s 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act (see [70] to [94] above), I found that there was no basis for the defendant’s reliance on the defence of parallel imports. I was satisfied, therefore, that the plaintiffs had made out their claim of passing-offvis-à-visthe “ApeosPort” mark.",
        "DocuCentre mark and Fuji Xerox mark": "112 For similar reasons, I also found that the plaintiffs had made out their claims of passing-offvis-à-visthe “DocuCentre” and “Fuji Xerox” marks. Goodwill 113 On the element of goodwill, the defendant argued that the plaintiffs did not own the goodwill in the “DocuCentre” or “Fuji Xerox” mark.166Foot Note 166×DCS at paras 128 and 136. 114 As I noted earlier, at the goodwill stage of the inquiry, the court does not inquire whether the plaintiff’s goodwill is associated with a name or mark (AMC Liveat [81]–[83]). The question the court asks itself at this stage of the inquiry is whether there exists any attractive force in the plaintiff’s business that brings in custom; and in this connection, there was considerable evidence to establish “attractive force in the [plaintiffs’] business that brings in custom”: seeegthe plaintiffs’ evidence of the sales revenue and marketing expenditure for Fuji Xerox Equipment in Singapore between 2010 and 2017.167Foot Note 167×SOC at para 15; AB Vol 9 at pp 2345–2359; Sim AEIC at paras 7–8 and 26. Misrepresentation and damage 115 The element of misrepresentation is shown by proof that the defendant’s goods or services were held out to be, or to be connected with, those of the plaintiff’s business. The primary question then is whether the defendant’s use of the “DocuCentre” and “Fuji Xerox” marks would lead the relevant segment of the public to believe that the machines provided by the defendant were actually machines provided by the plaintiffs or that the defendant was economically related to the plaintiffs (AMCLiveat [86]). In connection with this, the court must, at a threshold level, consider whether the plaintiffs’ goodwill is sufficiently associated with the “DocuCentre” and “Fuji Xerox” marks that they use, or, framed in another way, whether these marks are distinctive of the plaintiffs’ machines (AMCLiveat [87]). 116 The defendant argued that the plaintiffs could not claim any goodwill associated with the “DocuCentre” and “Fuji Xerox” marks because both these marks are owned by Xerox Corporation and the plaintiffs pay royalties to Xerox Corporation for the trade mark use. According to the defendant, the plaintiffs had stated there was a licence agreement between Xerox Corporation and the 3rd plaintiff, although they had not adduced evidence of this;168Foot Note 168×DCS at paras 130, 132 and 137.and the “default position” in the case of a licensor-licensee relationship is that the licensor – in this case, Xerox Corporation – is the owner of the goodwill (Harvard Club of Singapore v President and Fellows of Harvard College[2020] 4 SLR 1378 (“Harvard Club”) at [88]).169Foot Note 169×DCS at para 131.Ms Batchelor had also agreed that Xerox Corporation owned the goodwill.170Foot Note 170×Transcript, 14 July 2020 at p 18, lines 11–13. 117 In response, the plaintiffs submitted – citingHan’s (F&B) Pte Ltd vGusttimo World Pte Ltd[2015] 2 SLR 825 (“Han’s”) – that Xerox Corporation and the plaintiffs were part of the same group of companies, and the goodwill in the “DocuCentre” and “Fuji Xerox” marks was associated with the business of the group.171Foot Note 171×PRS at paras 48 and 51–52. 118 InHan’s, the issue was whether the plaintiff – the parent company of the subsidiary that operated the Han’s restaurant and the registered owner of the Han’s trade mark – owned the goodwill in the Han’s mark when the plaintiff had not itself operated the business of the Han’s restaurant (at [187]). The defendant inHan’sargued that since goodwill was not in the Han’s trade mark, logo or get-up but in the carrying on of business, and since the plaintiff (an investment holding company) had never carried on the business of the Han’s restaurants, the plaintiff could have no goodwill to speak of. The High Court rejected the defendant’s arguments. The court found that the plaintiff owned the goodwill jointly and severally with the subsidiary, because the Han’s mark was used by the subsidiary for the benefit of the Han’sgroupwhich was headed by and under the control of the plaintiff; the goodwill in the mark was connected to the Han’s group, and in any event was enjoyed by both the plaintiff and the subsidiary (at [190], [194]). 119 It should be noted that inHarvard Club, the High Court expressly cautioned that “in a case where there is no express contract or agreement as to the ownership of the goodwill, it is especially important that one does not end the inquiry by employing a “default position” analysis. Rather, one must have regard to the full factual matrix of a case to determine ownership in an implied licence situation” (Harvard Clubat [90]). InQB Net Co Ltd vEarnson Management (S) Pte Ltd and others[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“QB Net”, cited by the court inHarvard Club), the High Court observedobiterthat goodwill could be jointly owned by the foreign licensor and the domestic licensee (QB Netat [30]), even though there were two licence agreements between them which gave the licensee the right to open 10-minute haircut salons under the trade names “QB House” and “QB Shell”, and to adopt the foreign licensor’s QB house system, get-up, and house marks (QB Netat [4], [6]). The High Court inQB Netfound that the licensee had contributed significantly to publicity efforts in Singapore and also substantially modified the licensor’s instruction manuals to make them suitable for use here (QB Netat [37]–[39]). In contrast, inHarvard Clubthe court found that ownership of the goodwill resided in the University as the evidence showed that the success and continuing operation of the Club would not have been possible without the help and support of the University; and also because events post the University’s revocation of the Club’s status as the official Harvard Club showed that the attractive force in the activities and function of the Club was actually rooted in the connection to the University (Harvard Clubat [93]–[96]). 120 In the present case, bearing in mind the court’s injunction inHarvard Clubto have regard to the full factual matrix of the case, I accepted the plaintiffs’ submission that they and Xerox Corporation were clearly part of the same group of companies engaged in the same areas of business. As noted earlier (at [6]), the 1st plaintiff is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the 3rd plaintiff which in turn is a joint venture between Xerox Corporation and Fujifilm Holdings in Japan (with the latter buying over Xerox Corporation’s shares in the 3rd plaintiff in 2019). I also accepted the plaintiffs’ submission that the goodwill in the “DocuCentre” and “Fuji Xerox” marks was (as inHan’s), associated with the business of both the plaintiffs and Xerox Corporation.172Foot Note 172×PRS at para 51.The marks were used by the plaintiffs, with Xerox Corporation’s consent, for the benefit of the plaintiffs themselves and Xerox Corporation –iein similar fashion to the subsidiary inHan’swhich used the Han’s trade marks, with the parent company’s consent, for the benefit of the Han’s group (Han’sat [188], [190]). In short, I was satisfied that the goodwill in the “DocuCentre” and “Fuji Xerox” marks wasjointlyowned by both Xerox Corporation and the plaintiffs. 121 In this case, the Offending Machines were offered for sale, lease or rent on the defendant’s website under the names “DocuCentre” and “Fuji Xerox”.173Foot Note 173×AB Vol 5 at pp 1288–1290; AB Vol 9 at pp 2270–2275, 2284–2285, 2287–2290.The defendant’s website stated that the defendant’s “major products supplied include the FUJI Xerox … DocuCentre series”.174Foot Note 174×AB Vol 9 at p 2271.It had also used the “DocuCentre” mark and “Fuji Xerox” mark in its brochures and pamphlets.175Foot Note 175×AB Vol 9 at pp 2207–2247; Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 63, lines 14–16.Given the identity between the defendant’s signs and the plaintiffs’ marks, and the fact that they were in the same business of selling photocopies and other office machines, I found that the average reasonable person with characteristics reflective of the relevant segment of the public (as earlier identified under the examination of goodwill, at [98]), was likely to be confused by the defendant’s misrepresentation. 122 Adopting the reasoning set out earlier at [104]–[109], I found the elements of misrepresentation and damage to be made out. Parallel imports 123 The defendant also pleaded that Offending Machines 4, 5 and 6, which bore the “DocuCentre” mark, were sold and/or imported into Singapore as parallel imports, and were all purchased from third party suppliers.176Foot Note 176×Defence at para 27.For reasons similar to those I set out earlier (at [70]–[84]) in dealing with the defendant’s reliance on s 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act for Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3, I found no basis for the defendant’s reliance on the defence of parallel imports in the context of these passing-off claims. (1) Evidence on Offending Machine 4 124 In respect of Offending Machine 4, the defendant’s explanation was that Fairmont Office Equipment (“Fairmont”), a Malaysian company, had received Offending Machine 4 from another Malaysian company, Kim Fook Engineering (“Kim Fook”); that Fairmont had made changes in machine information and print speed upon receipt; and that the defendant had thereafter taken delivery of a DocuCentre VC 3375 from Fairmont on 27 March 2014.177Foot Note 177×DCS at para 210.This purchase, according to Poh, was made “through a recommendation by Starcopy Co. Ltd” and payment was made directly to Starcopy Co. Ltd (“Starcopy”).178Foot Note 178×Poh AEIC at para 24, pp 314 and 316.Kim Fook was an authorised reseller of Fuji Xerox Equipment in Malaysia.179Foot Note 179×AB Vol 6 at p 1397; Transcript, 17 July 2020 at p 7, line 22. 125 First, I noted that according to the Malaysian company registration records, Fairmont was registered as a business on 24 April 2009, and its registration had expired on 23 April 2010.180Foot Note 180×AB Vol 30 at p 8099.This meant that Fairmont was not registered as a company in Malaysia at the time of the purported transaction with the defendant on 27 March 2014. Poh’s explanation at trial – that “perhaps [Fairmont] forgot to renew after the registration expired” – was unbelievable, in light of what I have earlier found at [77] above.181Foot Note 181×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 9, lines 9–12. 126 Second, Poh failed to offer any intelligible explanation for the role of Kim Fook or how payment was made for Offending Machine 4. 127 In his AEIC, Poh adduced an invoice dated 27 March 2014 that showed a total amount of RMB 44,000 due from the defendant to Starcopy (“Starcopy Invoice”) for a machine “DCVC3375”.182Foot Note 182×Poh AEIC at pp 314 and 316.Poh also adduced a payment voucher dated 9 May 2014 ostensibly issued by the defendant, showing payment of RMB 44,000 had been made to Starcopy for “DCVC3375” (“PTC-Starcopy Payment Voucher”).183Foot Note 183×Poh AEIC at p 318.In his supplementary AEIC, Poh adduced a delivery order issued by Fairmont to the defendant purporting to record Fairmont’s sale and delivery of Offending Machine 4 to the defendant on 27 March 2014 (“Fairmont-PTC Delivery Order”).184Foot Note 184×Poh Supplementary AEIC at p 10.This document recorded that the machine “DCVC3375” had a serial number of 611106, and indicated a “Debit” of RMB 44,000 – a handwritten note appeared to make reference to the Starcopy Invoice. The Fairmont-PTC Delivery Order also stated that Fairmont’s address was in Johor Bahru, Malaysia (the “Jalan Kempas Address”). 128 The plaintiffs adduced a receipt from Kim Fook dated 12 February 2014, which recorded that Kim Fook had received MYR 21,000 from Q Tech International (“Q Tech”) for Q Tech’s purchase of a new machine, DC-VC2275 with a serial number of 312708 (“Kim Fook-Q Tech Receipt”).185Foot Note 185×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents (Volume 1) dated 15 July 2020 (“1 PB”) at p 7.The plaintiffs also adduced an invoice dated 14 February 2014 issued by Kim Fook to Q Tech for the same sum of MYR 21,000, for a machine with the same serial number of 312708 (“Kim Fook-Q Tech Invoice”).186Foot Note 186×1 PB at p 5.The Kim Fook-Q Tech invoice showed that Q Tech International had the same address in Singapore as Quest Tech – which was Poh’s wife’s business.187Foot Note 187×See the address of Quest Tech at AB Vol 23 at p 6077; Supplementary AEIC of Batchelor dated 15 July 2020 (“Batchelor Supplementary AEIC”) at para 10.Lastly, the plaintiffs adduced a delivery order from Kim Fook to Q Tech (“Kim Fook-Q Tech Delivery Order”) dated 14 February 2014, which stated that delivery of this machine “DCVC2275” with serial number 312708 was to be made to the Jalan Kempas Address in Malaysia – which was Fairmont’s address (see [126] above).188Foot Note 188×1 PB at p 6. 129 At trial, Poh accepted that the delivery address shown in the Kim Fook-Q Tech Delivery Order was the same as Fairmont’s Jalan Kempas Address in the Fairmont-PTC Delivery Order.189Foot Note 189×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 8, lines 5–9.Poh also conceded that the serial number of the machine had changed from 312708 in the Kim Fook-Q Tech Delivery Order to 611106 in the Fairmont-PTC Delivery Order.190Foot Note 190×1 PB at p 6 (serial number of 312708), compare with Poh Supplementary AEIC at p 10 (serial number of 611106); Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 8, lines 10–15.Lastly, Poh accepted that Q Tech had the same address as Quest Tech, which was solely owned by his wife.191Foot Note 191×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 4, lines 1–4.As mentioned earlier at [79], Poh’s wife was also appointed a director of the defendant on 27 April 2015. 130 The documentary evidence, and Poh’s testimony, led to the following findings. Around 14 February 2014, Q Tech, a Singapore company which shared the same address as a business solely owned by Poh’s wife, paid Kim Fook (the plaintiffs’ authorised reseller in Malaysia) MYR 21,000 for a machine “DCVC2275” with a serial number 312708, to be delivered to Fairmont in Malaysia at the Jalan Kempas Address. About a month later, around 27 March 2014, Fairmont then delivered a machine “DCVC3375” to the defendant with a serial number of 611106. Starcopy received payment of RMB 44,000 for arranging this transaction between Fairmont and the defendant around 9 May 2014, some two months after the delivery – despite the Starcopy Invoice stating that payment was to be made “in Advance”, with “Cash before delivery”. 131 These findings raised a host of questions. Why did Q Tech – allegedly a different business from the Quest Tech company owned by Poh’s wife – share the same address as Quest Tech? Why would Q Tech deliver a machine to Fairmont if Fairmont was not even a registered company at the time? Did Fairmont pay Q Tech for the delivery, and if so, how much? Why did the defendant pay Starcopy rather than paying Fairmont directly? Why did Starcopy apparently allow payment to be made two months after delivery? 132 Poh’s evidence in response to these questions came across as contrived and – again – frankly unbelievable. 133 First, in his supplementary AEIC, Poh claimed that the defendant was not aware of Q Tech (even though it shared the same address as his wife’s company Quest Tech and had a highly similar name to Quest Tech). Poh pronounced himself surprised by the plaintiffs’ claim that Offending Machine 4 had been sold to Q Tech.192Foot Note 192×Poh Supplementary AEIC at para 7.According to Poh, “there is no existence of this company called Q Tech”.193Foot Note 193×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 79, lines 9–10.He also claimed that Kim Fook’s boss (“Chin”) had told him that Kim Fook had never sold any machine to Q Tech, and that the manager “might have made a mistake in this document”.194Foot Note 194×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 5, lines 1–9.Having given this testimony, however, Poh then went further to allege that the Kim Fook-Q Tech Delivery Order, Kim Fook-Q Tech Receipt and Kim Fook-Q Tech Invoice were not just incorrect but werefabricated.195Foot Note 195×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 11, line 27; p 78, lines 22–26; p 79, lines 8–12.In his supplementary AEIC, he claimed that these documents departed significantly from Kim Fook’s own practice or from the industry practice.196Foot Note 196×Poh Supplementary AEIC at paras 12, 14, 16 and 17; pp 19–20, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30–43. 134 Despite the obviously serious nature of his allegations about fabricated Kim Fook documentation, Poh did not call Chin as a witness to testify to any of these allegations.197Foot Note 197×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 6, lines 8–17.Instead, he adduced two letters dated 16 July 2020 in his supplementary AEIC, purportedly from Chin, as well as two “draft statements” of Chang Swee Keong (“Chang”), the alleged sales manager of Kim Fook.198Foot Note 198×Poh Supplementary AEIC at paras 8 and 10.The two letters from Chin had largely the same content, save for the differences I have emphasised below:199Foot Note 199×Poh Supplementary AEIC at pp 12–13. The first letter: … Mr. Chang [the sales manager] cannot recall if there has been mix up on the invoice to Singaporeas we did not send/sold anything to the Singapore address [of Q Tech].We are not sure if the invoice address correct or there may be an error or miscommunication on the address. We also did not check or verify the background of this company in JB. We only followed the instructions to deliver the copier to [the Jalan Kempas Address]. … The second letter: … Mr. Chang [the sales manager] cannot recall if there has been mix up on the invoice to Singapore.The invoice (PI-14/02/14) was for our own internal records only.We are not sure if the invoice address correct or there may be an error or miscommunication on the address. We also did not check or verify the background of this company in JB. We only followed the instructions to deliver the copier to [the Jalan Kempas Address]. … [emphasis added] 135 As for Chang’s “draft statements”, which were purportedly sent by email from Chang to Chin on 7 May 2014,200Foot Note 200×Poh Supplementary AEIC at pp 15–17.the first of these “draft statements” said: Some where January this year : I can’t really recall the actual date. A Singapore lady so call Miss Koh from Q TECH INTERNATIONAL , she call me up to request for the Color Machine proposal, After did some enquiries ,I proposed to her the Newest Model that we have ( The DC-VC 2275 .) February this year : She call me up again said her boss already confirmed to buy the Color Machine… Just after 2 days, she call me to install the machine in Kempas , I do asked for the Installation Address but she failed to reply me. She call me up again the next day … She want to collect the machine by themselves first and install whenever their Network Is ready. … The second “draft statement” said: …I consulted my boss , he said ,since it is a first time we deal with this customer we want cash before installation. They agreed and provide us the Address in JB. And mentioned that the installation will be somewhere in mid of Feb. 2014. Before the installation date , they came and want to pick up the copier and do the installation themselves. … 136 Given that no one from Kim Fook (and indeed, no one besides Poh) was called by the defendant to testify about the “fabrication” of the Kim Fook documents and/or supposed errors in them, Kim Fook’s practices and/or “industry practice”, Poh’s claims about the documents amounted to nothing more than bare – and plainly self-serving – assertions. Further, even if one could accept the authenticity of Chin’s purported letters and Chan’s purported “draft statements” (and the defendant offered no objective evidence to establish their authenticity), these documents actually contradicted each other. Chin’s first letter stated that Kim Fook had not sold anything to “the Singapore address [ieQ Tech]”, but Chang’s “draft statement” identified Q Tech as having purchased the machine “for [a] customer in JB”.201Foot Note 201×Poh Supplementary AEIC at pp 13 and 16–17. 137 Second, since Poh insisted that “there is no existence of this company called Q Tech”, he had to explain why Kim Fook would deliver the machine to the Jalan Kempas Address if it had not received any payment from Q Tech.202Foot Note 202×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 79, lines 9–10.Once again, his explanation made no sense:203Foot Note 203×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 11, line 28–p 12 line 8. Kim Fook and Star Copy knew each other and had dealings with each other. So sometimes, they might give money from one person to another. Many of these companies do it this way. The assertion that Kim Fook and Starcopy knew each other was not in Poh’s AEIC: it was made for the first time in cross-examination.204Foot Note 204×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 12, line 18.Poh also did not adduce any evidence to show that someone else besides Q Tech –egStarcopy or Fairmont – had paid Kim Fook, nor did he explain why either Starcopy or Kim Fook would have “[done] it this way”. Lastly, I also did not believe Poh’s claims that Q Tech did not exist: given that it shared the same address as his wife’s company Quest Tech, and had a very similar name, it would seem reasonable to infer that Q Tech and Quest Tech were more probably than not one and the same company. 138 Lastly, Poh claimed that it was Fairmont that had made modifications to Offending Machine 4.205Foot Note 205×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 8, lines 20–23.Poh adduced a letter dated 26 June 2015, supposedly from Fairmont’s manager, one Shirley Koh.206Foot Note 206×AB Vol 23 at p 6086.The letter stated: … This is to certify that one unit of Fuji Xerox DCVC3375 (serial number 611106) was sold by us to a Singapore buyer. This machine was purchased in Malaysia through an authorised Fuji Xerox reseller channel and we got the machine as DCVC2275 (serial number 312708) and through our IT friend, we managed to upgrade the machine from Fuji Xerox DCVC2275 to Fuji Xerox DCVC3375 … Payment was made to my friend Mr Xu (a Taiwanese) who knows the buyer and ordered the machine through our company. 139 I was not persuaded by this letter. Apart from the fact that it was hearsay (since no one from Fairmont was called to attest to the authenticity of this letter), Fairmont was not even a registered company in Malaysia at the time of the alleged transaction. In any event, the defendant’s case appeared to be internally inconsistent: it was not explained how the defendant could on the one hand submit that the machine mentioned in the various Kim Fook-Q Tech documents (with a serial number of 312708) wasnotthe Offending Machine 4 (with a serial number of 611106) sold by Fairmont to the defendant, and at the same time rely on this letter to argue that Fairmont was responsible for the modifications tothis machine.207Foot Note 207×DCS at para 210. 140 The convoluted route by which the defendant obtained Offending Machine 4 – and Poh’s inability to provide any coherent explanation for the various discrepancies – pointed to duplicity on the defendant’s part. Having regard to my findings on the evidence adduced, I rejected the defendant’s claim that it acquired Offending Machine 4 from a legitimate third-party supplier. 141 In any event, to rely on the defence of parallel imports in response to a passing off claim, the defendant must have imported and resoldgenuine goods(see [110] above]. Offending Machine 4 was not resold as a genuine good, given that it had been modified. I return to this issue at [176]–[181] below. (2) Evidence on Offending Machines 5 and 6 142 In his AEIC, Poh claimed that the defendant had bought Offending Machines 5 and 6 from Shanghai Quanle Office Equipment Operations Co Ltd (“Shanghai Quanle”), a Chinese company.208Foot Note 208×Poh AEIC at paras 28 and 30.Shanghai Quanle is an authorised reseller of the plaintiffs in China.209Foot Note 209×AB Vol 8 at pp 2119–2152 (English translation); pp 2153–2170 (Chinese version). 143 Poh produced two invoices – one dated 13 August 2014 (the “13 August 2014 Invoice”) which showed the alleged purchase by the defendant of a “Xerox DC VC3375 + Duplex + Fax” for RMB 46,080, and another dated 16 September 2014 (the “16 September 2014 Invoice”) which showed the purchase by the defendant of,inter alia, a “Xerox DC VC3375 + Duplex + Fax”, for a total of RMB 83,520.210Foot Note 210×Poh AEIC at pp 337 and 339.As with Offending Machine 4, Poh claimed that he had obtained clarification from Shanghai Quanle in June 2015 that the modifications to Offending Machines 5 and 6 were done by the shipper when they left Shanghai.211Foot Note 211×Poh AEIC at paras 32 and 34; pp 346 and 348.Poh also produced an alleged certificate of authorisation from Fuji Xerox (“Authorisation Certificate”).212Foot Note 212×AB Vol 23 at pp 6117–6118. 144 Poh’s evidence in this regard was again full of anomalies and discrepancies. First, the company name on the Authorisation Certificate, “Shanghai Quanle Office Equipment Operations Co. Ltd”, did not match any of the three company names stated on the 13 August 2014 Invoice and the 16 September 2014 Invoice. Poh’s initial explanation was that the names on the two invoices were a “short-form”.213Foot Note 213×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 21, lines 8–13.When probed further on how he knew this, he admitted: “I came up with that myself.”214Foot Note 214×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 21, line 26.This initial explanation was then jettisoned in favour of another story –iethat the name “SHANGHAI QUANLE” in the invoices was the “name of the authorised reseller”.215Foot Note 215×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 22, lines 6–15.From the manner in which Poh glibly shifted from one story to another, it appeared to me he was simply making up his answers on the fly. It should also be highlighted that a search of the China National Company Registration Database showed the company “Shanghai Xerox Office Equipment Operation Co Ltd” (the first company name stated in Mandarin at the top of the two invoices) did not even exist.216Foot Note 216×AB Vol 9 at pp 2360–2361; Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 23, lines 14–19. 145 Second, Poh accepted that the description of the products sold in both the 13 August 2014 Invoice and the 16 September 2014 Invoice did not match the description in the shipment proofs.217Foot Note 217×AB Vol 31 at pp 8097–8098 (shipment proof dated 13 August 2014), compare with AB Vol 10 at pp 2391 (13 August 2014 Invoice); AB Vol 31 at pp 8099–8100 (shipment proof dated 15 September 2014), compare with AB Vol 10 at p 2395 (16 September 2014 Invoice); Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 24, line 27 –p 25, line 31.His explanation was that the Chinese parties’ “proficiency of the English is limited, so when they typed it out, this is how they do it” – it did not mean “that the products are different”.218Foot Note 218×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 26, lines 9–20.His evidence appeared to be pure conjecture, since the defendants failed to call any witnesses from the Chinese company to testify about this.219Foot Note 219×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 27, lines 5–8. 146 Third, Poh produced a letter purporting to be from Shanghai Quanle, an authorised reseller of the 3rd plaintiff, dated 19 June 2015.220Foot Note 220×AB Vol 23 at pp 6084–6085.The letter stated: These 2 machines – DocuCentre-V C2275 CPS of serial no. 840161; 440578 – are confirmed to have been shipped from our company’s warehouse. Based on investigation of the 2 machines, they have been upgraded to DocuCentre-V C3375 CPS by the shipper when they left Shanghai. … Quite apart from the doubtful authenticity of this letter, it did not in any event assist to shed light on the defendant’s case.221Foot Note 221×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 31, lines 21–29.Oddly, in particular, the “shipper” who was said to have “upgraded” Offending Machines 5 and 6 “when they left Shanghai” was not even named or identified; nor was any explanation offered as to why the “shipper” should have taken it upon themselves to effect such “upgrading” when the defendant itself claimed not to have known of the “upgrading”, much less asked for it. Lastly, I note that the defendant didnotpursue this point about the shipper performing the upgrades in its closing submissions. Instead, in its closing submissions, the defendant contended – rather startlingly and without any apparent evidential basis – that the changes in the software/firmware were made byShanghaiQuanleand that Shanghai Quanle had a “clear motivation to alter the Machine Information of [Offending] Machines 5 and 6 to avoid detection from the [p]laintiffs”.222Foot Note 222×DCS at paras 212 and 215. 147 Lastly, I note that the plaintiffs provided a copy of the distribution agreement between the plaintiff’s Chinese office and Shanghai Quanle dated 26 July 2018 (the “Shanghai Quanle Agreement”).223Foot Note 223×AB Vol 8 at pp 2119–2152.The Shanghai Quanle Agreement provided,inter alia, that it was “prohibited to make any substitution or modification to the products or packaging … provided by the Supplier without the prior written consent of the Supplier”.224Foot Note 224×AB Vol 8 at p 2123.It also stated that “Without the consent of the Supplier, the Dealer shall not directly or through a third person sell the products … outside the mainland of China.”225Foot Note 225×AB Vol 8 at p 2124. 148 Although the plaintiffs originally tendered a statement from Shanghai Quanle dated 7 November 2019 stating “[o]ur company has not sold any modified equipment to PTC Business System Pte Ltd”226Foot Note 226×AB Vol 8 at pp 2171–2172., Ms Batchelor testified at trial that Shanghai Quanle had supplied Offending Machines 5 and 6 in breach of its distribution agreements with the plaintiffs. However, Shanghai Quanle was not the one who made the modifications.227Foot Note 227×Transcript, 14 July 2020 at p 42, line 4–p 43 line 7 and p 45, line 12; Transcript, 17 July 2020 at p 41, lines 3–6.The defendant argued that this proved it must have obtained the machines from the same Shanghai Quanle that was the plaintiffs’ authorised reseller.228Foot Note 228×DCS at para 214.In their reply submissions, the plaintiffs pointed out that this did not mean Shanghai Quanle had “directly sold” to the defendant: it only meant that Shanghai Quanle was the ultimate source upstream of the machines that ended up with the defendant.229Foot Note 229×PRS at para 69. 149 I was not persuaded by the defendant’s arguments.Even ifShanghai Quanle had, in breach of its agreement with the plaintiffs, resold Offending Machines 5 and 6 directly to the defendant, this would not allow the defendant to invoke the defence of parallel imports in response to the passing off claim. This was because Offending Machines 5 and 6 had been modified and were not resold as genuine goods in Singapore (see [182]–[191] below).",
        "Copyright infringement": "150 I next address the 3rd plaintiff’s claim of copyright infringement, which was the subject of the further submissions I requested from parties. I examined the evidence adduced in the light of the parties’ closing submissions as well as their further submissions and further reply submissions.",

According to the defendant, the plaintiff had to establish that copyright subsisted under Japanese law as the software/firmware was first published in Japan.241Foot Note 241×DCS at paras 141 and 144.The defendant also argued that while the plaintiffs alleged numerous instances where the serial numbers were altered, the plaintiffs had not produced evidence to prove that the defendant was the party who did so.242Foot Note 242×DCS at para 20(b).Further, even if the defendant had made any alleged alterations to the software/firmware, these alleged alterations did not amount to an adaptation of the copyright in the software/firmware.243Foot Note 243×DCS at paras 222 and 241. Subsistence of copyright 155 Having considered the evidence and parties’ submissions, I found that copyrightdidsubsist in the software/firmware and that it was owned by the 3rd plaintiff. 156 First, I disagreed with the defendant’s submission that Regulation 5(b)(i) of the Copyright (International Protection) Regulations (Cap 63, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Copyright (International Protection) Regulations”) was applicable to ascertain whether protection under the Copyright Act should be granted to the software/firmware.244Foot Note 244×DCS at paras 142–143.Regulation 5 refers to a “published edition of a work or works”. Copyright in published editions of works, under s 86 and s 91 of the Copyright Act, is popularly known as a publisher’s right or a copyright in the layout or typeset of a published work (Global Yellow Pages Ltdv Promedia Directories Pte Ltd and another matter[2017] 2 SLR 185at [92]–[93]). 157 Software/firmware, however, is a “literary work” (s 7A(1)(b) of the Copyright Act). In this regard, the Copyright Act shall apply in relation to the plaintiffs’ software/firmware that was first published in Japan (or Malaysia or China) in like manner as it would apply in relation to software/firmware first published in Singapore (Regulation 3(1)(a) of the Copyright (International Protection) Regulations). Japan, Malaysia, and China are all members of the World Trade Organisation and are parties to the Berne Convention.245Foot Note 245×PCS at para 185.Thus, the software/firmware in the present case enjoyed copyright protection in Singapore, as if it had been published in Singapore. The plaintiffs did not need to establish that the software/firmware enjoyed copyright protection under Japanese copyright law.246Foot Note 246×DCS at paras 144–145. 158 It should be noted, moreover, that the plaintiffs in this case relied on s 130 of the Copyright Act for the presumption as to subsistence and ownership of the copyright in the 3rd plaintiff (s 130(1)(a) of the Copyright Act).247Foot Note 247×PCS at para 169.Insofar as the defendant apparently refused to admit the subsistence of copyright in the software/firmware or the 3rd plaintiff’s ownership of such copyright, there was no evidence adduced by the defendant to satisfy me that it was putting these matters in issue in good faith: s 130(1A) of the Copyright Act. The 3rd plaintiff’s Katsumi Kizaki had also filed an affidavit stating that the 3rd plaintiff was the owner of the software/firmware, and this stood asprima facieproof of the matters stated therein (s 130(1B) of the Copyright Act,NanofilmTechnologies International Pte Ltd v Semivac International Pte Ltd and others[2018] 5 SLR 956at [57]).248Foot Note 248×AEIC of Katsumi Kizaki dated 18 June 2020 at paras 14–15.The defendant did not adduce any evidence to prove the contrary. Adaptation 159 In relation to computer programs, s 7(1)(c) of the Copyright Act defines an “adaptation” as a version of the work (whether or not it is in the language, code or notation in which the work was originally expressed), not being a reproduction of the work. Section 17 of the Copyright Act states that references to an adaptation of a work to a material form includes references to the storage of that adaptation in,inter alia, a computer or on any medium by electronic means. 160 The plaintiffs submitted that the “adaptation” made by the defendant could be found,inter alia, in the following ways: the Offending Machines had object code embodied in the ROM where the functions they produced were identical to that found in original Fuji Xerox Equipment, the version numbers on some of the Offending Machines did not make chronological sense to the plaintiffs, the Offending Machines had altered or modified rights management information, there were Offending Machines that had been up-speeded (which could only be achieved by modifying the software/firmware), and there were Offending Machines that used to be “DocuCentre” Fuji Xerox Equipment, but later contained “ApeosPort” object code.249Foot Note 249×Plaintiffs’ Further Submissions dated 12 May 2021 (“PFS”) at para 36. 161 The defendant, for its part, argued that the plaintiffs had not provided any evidence of the similarities and differences between their proprietary source code and the allegedly infringing code, and that there was no evidence to support a finding that the object code in the ROM was an adaptation of the plaintiffs’ source code.250Foot Note 250×Defendant’s Reply Submissions to the Plaintiffs’ Further Submissions dated 21 May 2021 (“DRS 2”) at paras 5 and 7.There was also no evidence that the defendant had access to the plaintiffs’ source code which would enable it to adapt the said code to the allegedly infringing object code.251Foot Note 251×DRS 2 at para 8. 162 Taking into consideration the available evidence, I was satisfied that the software/firmware came within the definition of an unlicensed adaptation. I was also satisfied that the original software/firmware in each Offending Machine had been altered. I set out below my findings in respect of the evidence for each machine. (1) Offending Machine 1 163 According to the plaintiffs, the original product name for Offending Machine 1 was changed from AP4C2270 to AP4C3370, the original product code was changed from NC100342 to NC500341, and the original serial number was changed from 788168 to 855300.252Foot Note 252×AB Vol 6 at p 1356. 164 From the plaintiffs’ investigations, Offending Machine 1 was manufactured on 7 November 2010, sold by Fuji Xerox Saitama in Japan and installed on 26 November 2010, and later removed from the client’s location on 24 June 2015.253Foot Note 253×AB Vol 6 at pp 1363–1364; Transcript, 5 January 2021 at p 21, lines 19–23. 165 The defendant acquired Offending Machine 1 on 5 February 2016.254Foot Note 254×AB Vol 10 at p 2403 (Fuji Xerox APIVC3370).On 15 February 2016, the defendant recorded its serial number as 884121, and gave it the reference number 801964.255Foot Note 255×AB Vol 10 at p 2404.The defendant’s configuration report dated 15 February 2016 (with a timestamp of 2:27pm) showed that the Controller ROM version was “Ver 1.1.22”, the serial number was 884121, the product code was NC100354, and the machine model was ApeosPort-IV C3370.256Foot Note 256×AB Vol 10 at p 2407.Offending Machine 1 was then sold by the defendant to GMC around 23 June 2016.257Foot Note 257×AB Vol 10 at pp 2454–2455; Yasuda AEIC at para 149. 166 The plaintiffs acquired Offending Machine 1 from GMC on or around 12 December 2017.258Foot Note 258×Yasuda AEIC at para 154.The plaintiffs used the serial number of the fuser assembly unit to derive the original serial number of the machine, which was 788168.259Foot Note 259×Transcript, 5 January 2021 at p 18, lines 23–27; p 19, lines 6–10; p 26, lines 28–29.The plaintiffs’ September 2018 Report recorded the Controller ROM version as “Ver 1.2.4”, the serial number as 855300, the product code as NC500341 and the machine model as ApeosPort-IV C3370.260Foot Note 260×AB Vol 6 at p 1362.Ms Yasuda’s evidence – which was not refuted – was that this installed software version was only released in March 2012 for the Fuji Xerox domestic region.261Foot Note 261×Yasuda AEIC at para 57; AB Vol 6 at p 1362. 167 I accepted that the version number of the software/firmware on Offending Machine 1 recorded by the plaintiffs in 2018 (“Ver 1.2.4”) could not have been present in Offending Machine 1 at the time it was manufactured in Japan in November 2010, since this version was only released for the Japanese market in March 2012.262Foot Note 262×Yasuda AEIC at para 57; AB Vol 6 at p 1362.This meant that the software/firmware must have been modified from the original version at the time of manufacture. I also accepted that based on the September 2018 Report, the product name, product code and serial number of Offending Machine 1 had been changed from the original machine information. (2) Offending Machine 2 168 For Offending Machine 2, the plaintiffs asserted that the original product name was changed from DC4C4475 to AP4C4475 (ieit was changed from a DocuCentre to an ApeosPort machine), and the original serial number was changed from 310612 to 302040.263Foot Note 263×AB Vol 6 at p 1356. 169 Offending Machine 2 was manufactured on 30 October 2012, sold on 15 November 2012 by Fuji Xerox Chiba, and removed from the client’s premises in Japan on 27 August 2015.264Foot Note 264×AB Vol 6 at pp 1372–1373.It was acquired by the defendant on 4 March 2016.265Foot Note 265×AB Vol 10 at p 2418.On 7 March 2016, the defendant recorded that this machine had the serial number 309583, and assigned it the reference number of 802064.266Foot Note 266×Yasuda AEIC at para 163; AB Vol 10 at pp 2419–2420.The defendant’s configuration report dated 7 March 2016 (with a timestamp of 2:28pm) showed the “Controller ROM” version as “Ver 1.71.15”, the serial number as 309583, the product code as NC100411, and the machine name as ApeosPort-IV C4475.267Foot Note 267×AB Vol 10 at p 2422. 170 The defendant sold Offending Machine 2 to GMC around 22 March 2016.268Foot Note 268×Yasuda AEIC at para 166; AB Vol 10 at p 2430.The plaintiffs acquired Offending Machine 2 from GMC around 12 December 2017. The plaintiffs’ September 2018 Report showed the “Controller ROM” version as “Ver 1.31.12”, the serial number as 302040, the product code as NC100426, and the machine name as ApeosPort-IV C4475.269Foot Note 269×AB Vol 6 at p 1371. 171 Ms Yasuda testified that Offending Machine 2 must have been tampered with at some point before 7 March 2016 because, as of 7 March 2016, the software version “1.71.15” recorded in the defendant’s configuration report did not exist; this version was only released in October 2017.270Foot Note 270×Transcript, 4 January 2021 at p 8, lines 28–31; Transcript, 5 January 2021 at p 45, lines 18–22; p 55, line 27–p 56, line 9.In addition, the September 2018 Report stated that the installed software version “Ver 1.31.12” at that date was released in May 2015271Foot Note 271×AB Vol 6 at p 1371; Yasuda AEIC at para 72.– about three years after the manufacture of the machine. Ms Yasuda’s evidence in this respect was not refuted. From the evidence, I accepted that the software versions in the machine must have been altered from the original version. I also accepted that the serial number and product code had been altered. 172 For completeness, the plaintiffs said in the September 2018 Report that Offending Machine 2 contained “SSL/TLS Settings” which DocuCentre machines do not have, and also contained an application called “BMLinkS”, which was not a genuine Fuji Xerox application.272Foot Note 272×AB Vol 6 at p 1375; AB Vol 31, at pp 8101–8369.Ms Yasuda initially testified that this application was “not an officially directly provided item by Fuji Xerox”.273Foot Note 273×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 2, lines 4–5.Subsequently she clarified that the “connectivity function from BMLinkS is a function that is offered by Fuji Xerox” and that these were “standard functions” for “ApeosPort4C4475 and DocuCentre4C4475”.274Foot Note 274×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 5, lines 15–16 and p 6, lines 2–4.Given her clarification that it was in fact a genuine Fuji Xerox application that was standard for both the modified machine model and for the original machine model, I did not find that the BMLinkS function on Offending Machine 2 was evidence of an unlicensed adaptation of the software/firmware. (3) Offending Machine 3 173 Offending Machine 3 was manufactured on 2 July 2013, installed on 30 August 2013 and removed from the client’s premises in Japan on 5 February 2016.275Foot Note 275×AB Vol 6 at pp 1384–1385.The defendant acquired Offending Machine 3 on 13 May 2016.276Foot Note 276×AB Vol 10 at p 2436.On 16 May 2016, the defendant assigned it a reference number of 802219, and recorded its serial number as 607738.277Foot Note 277×Yasuda AEIC at para 179; AB Vol 10 at pp 2437–2438.The defendant’s configuration report dated 16 May 2016 (with a timestamp of 11:31am) recorded the Controller ROM as “Ver 1.31.14”, the machine model as “ApeosPort-IV C5575”, the serial number as 607738, and the product code as NC100426.278Foot Note 278×AB Vol 10 at p 2440.The defendant sold this machine to GMC on 30 May 2016.279Foot Note 279×Yasuda AEIC at para 182; AB Vol 10 at p 2448.It was acquired by the plaintiffs around 12 December 2017. 174 In the plaintiffs’ September 2018 Report, they recorded the machine model as ApeosPort-IV C5575, the serial number as 629586 and the product code as NC100411.280Foot Note 280×AB Vol 6 at p 1382.According to Ms Yasuda, this serial number 629586 was the correct and genuine serial number, which had probably reappeared upon the software being reset.281Foot Note 281×Yasuda AEIC at paras 189–190.Ms Yasuda’s evidence – which was not refuted - was that the software version “Ver 1.31.14” as stated in the defendant’s configuration report from 16 May 2016 did not exist at the time of May 2016 (it was only released in August 2016), and hence that machine must have been tampered with.282Foot Note 282×Transcript, 4 January 2021 at p 9, lines 10–12; Transcript, 5 January 2021, at p 61, lines 31–32. 175 Based on the evidence, I accepted that the serial number of Offending Machine 3 had been changed from 629586 to 607738, and then reverted to 629586 by the time of the plaintiffs’ September 2018 Report. I also accepted that the Controller ROM software version “Ver 1.31.14” reflected in the defendant’s configuration report from May 2016 did not exist at that time, and so the software must have been modified either before that time or upon delivery. Similarly,perthe plaintiffs’ investigations in the September 2018 Report, the software version “Ver 1.31.8” was only released for the Fuji Xerox domestic region in June 2014,afterthe manufacture of Offending Machine 3 in July 2013, so the software in Offending Machine 3 must have been modified at some point between the defendant acquiring Offending Machine 3 in May 2016 and the plaintiffs acquiring Offending Machine 3 in December 2017.283Foot Note 283×AB Vol 6 at p 1382. (4) Offending Machine 4 176 According to the plaintiffs, the original product name for Offending Machine 4 was changed from DC5C2275 to DC5C3375, and the original serial number was changed from 312708 to 611106.284Foot Note 284×AB Vol 6 at pp 1356, 1395. I have referred to the serial number of 611106 based on the configuration report at p 1395, although the summary at p 1356 states that the serial number is 611105. 177 Offending Machine 4 was manufactured on 27 December 2013.285Foot Note 285×AB Vol 6 at p 1396.It was sold by Fuji Xerox Malaysia to Kim Fook, an authorised reseller, on 28 January 2014, with a serial number of 312708.286Foot Note 286×AB Vol 6 at p 1397.Ms Yasuda testified that Fuji Xerox knew about this sale to Kim Fook as at 2014, but did not know what happened after that.287Foot Note 287×Transcript, 5 January 2021 at p 69, lines 19–31. 178 From the evidence set out earlier, Kim Fook had sold Offending Machine 4 to Q-Tech in February 2014 with the original serial number of 312708. The machine was delivered to Fairmont, and then sold to the defendant on 27 March 2014 with a different serial number of 611106. Around 15 April 2014, the 2nd plaintiff acquired Offending Machine 4 from S M Compass.288Foot Note 288×Yasuda AEIC at para 201; Batchelor AEIC at para 169; AB Vol 9 at pp 2323 and 2328. 179 From the plaintiffs’ September 2018 Report, they found that the Controller ROM was “Ver 1.1.6”, the machine model was DocuCentre-V C3375, the serial number was 611106, and the product code was TC100705.289Foot Note 289×AB Vol 6 at p 1395.The Seito Investigation report from April 2014 also recorded the same information.290Foot Note 290×AB Vol 3 at pp 716–722. 180 Based on the documentary evidence available, I was satisfied that the machine sold by Kim Fook to Q-Tech/Fairmont and subsequently to the defendant was the same Offending Machine 4, and that its original serial number and product name had been changed. 181 For completeness, I noted that the Controller ROM version number “Ver 1.1.6” as found by the plaintiffs in the September 2018 Report was released in December 2013 for the Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific region, including Fuji Xerox Malaysia.291Foot Note 291×AB Vol 6 at p 1395.I did not think that this indicated the software/firmware in Offending Machine 4 was an unlicensed adaptation. Since the machine was manufactured in December 2013, it was plausible that the software version released in December 2013 was incorporated into Offending Machine 4 from the time of manufacture and was not subsequently modified. (5) Offending Machine 5 182 According to the plaintiffs, for Offending Machine 5, the product name was changed from DC5C2275 to DC5C3375, the original product code was changed from TC100757 to TC100760, and the original serial number was changed from 440578 to 455024.292Foot Note 292×AB Vol 6 at p 1356. 183 Offending Machine 5 was manufactured on 19 February 2014.293Foot Note 293×AB Vol 6 at p 1404.It was sold by Fuji Xerox in China to Shanghai Quanle, an authorised reseller of Fuji Xerox Equipment within China, on 27 March 2013.294Foot Note 294×Yasuda AEIC at para 205; AB Vol 6 at p 1405.It was acquired by the defendant around August/September 2014,295Foot Note 295×Poh AEIC at pp 337 and 339.and subsequently sold by the defendant to Focus Art around 21 October 2014.296Foot Note 296×Yasuda AEIC at para 209; AB Vol 10 at p 2397; AB Vol 3 at pp 752–756.The plaintiffs acquired Offending Machine 5 from Focus Art around November 2014.297Foot Note 297×AB Vol 3 at pp 752–756.The 19 June 2015 statement from Shanghai Quanle refers to the original serial number of the machine, 440578.298Foot Note 298×AB Vol 23 at p 6085. 184 From the plaintiffs’ investigations in the September 2018 Report, the Controller ROM version was “Ver 1.1.9”, the machine model was DocuCentre-V C3375, the serial number was 455024, and the product code was TC100760.299Foot Note 299×AB Vol 6 at p 1403.The changes from the original serial number of 440578 to 455024, change in product code (from TC100757 to TC100760) and print speed (from 2275 to 3375) were also recorded in Morimoto’s 26 November 2014 Report.300Foot Note 300×AB Vol 3 at pp 760–779, at p 764. 185 Based on the documentary evidence available, I accepted that the original product code, product name and serial number for Offending Machine 5 had been changed and this was an unlicensed adaptation. 186 As for the Controller ROM version number “Ver 1.1.9” found by the plaintiffs in the September 2018 Report, the plaintiffs said this was released in February 2014 only for the Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific region.301Foot Note 301×AB Vol 6 at p 1403.However, I did not think this pointed towards the software/firmware in Offending Machine 5 being an unlicensed adaptation: since the machine was manufactured in February 2014, it was plausible that the software released in February 2014 was incorporated into Offending Machine 5 from the time of manufacture, and was not subsequently modified. (6) Offending Machine 6 187 As for Offending Machine 6, the plaintiffs alleged that the product name was changed from DC5C2275-T2 to DC5C3375-T2, and the serial number was changed from 840161 to 455224.302Foot Note 302×AB Vol 6 at p 1356. 188 Offending Machine 6 was manufactured on 18 June 2014.303Foot Note 303×AB Vol 6 at p 1413.It was sold by Fuji Xerox in China to Shanghai Quanle on 26 September 2014.304Foot Note 304×AB Vol 6 at p 1414.The defendant’s records for the deliveries from Shanghai Quanle are dated 13 August 2014 and 16 September 2014.305Foot Note 305×Poh AEIC at pp 337 and 339.The 19 June 2015 statement from Shanghai Quanle referred to the original serial number of the machine, 840161.306Foot Note 306×AB Vol 23 at p 6085.The labels on the packaging of the machine (which Poh testified was what the defendant had received from Shanghai Quanle) indicated the modified serial number of 455224 and the modified product name of C3375.307Foot Note 307×AB Vol 23 at pp 6119–6120; Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 28, lines 18–30 and p 29, lines 8–16.These labels also indicated a date of 4 November 2013. As Ms Yasuda stated in her AEIC, there was inconsistency in these dates as the machine was sold to Shanghai Quanle on 26 September 2014 – yet the defendant’s documents purported to show that it had made the purchases from Shanghai Quanle from 13 August 2014 or 16 September 2014, while the delivery labels indicated that the defendant had received it around 4 November 2013.308Foot Note 308×Yasuda AEIC at para 215. 189 The defendant assigned Offending Machine 6 a reference number of 226081.309Foot Note 309×Yasuda AEIC at para 217.The defendant then sold this machine to Raymond Ng & Associates on 5 November 2014, with a handwritten reference number 226081.310Foot Note 310×Yasuda AEIC at para 218; AB Vol 10 at pp 2400–2402.The plaintiffs acquired Offending Machine 6 around November 2014 (see [20] above).311Foot Note 311×AB Vol 3 at pp 757–759. 190 From the plaintiffs’ September 2018 Report, Offending Machine 6 had a Controller ROM version “Ver 2.0.9”, machine model DocuCentre-V C3375 T2, and serial number 455224.312Foot Note 312×AB Vol 6 at p 1412.The change in the serial number from 840161 to 455224 and the change in the print speed (from 2275 to 3375) was also confirmed by Morimoto’s 26 November 2014 Report.313Foot Note 313×AB Vol 3 at pp 760–779, at p 772.From the evidence, I accepted that the original serial number and the original product name of Offending Machine 6 had been changed. 191 I noted that the Controller ROM version “Ver 2.0.9” was released in February 2014 for the Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific region, including China.314Foot Note 314×AB Vol 6 at p 1412.However, since the machine was manufactured on 18 June 2014ie afterthe software version was released, and hence it was plausible it would have had that version installed; this did not indicate that the software/firmware in the machine was an unlicensed adaptation. (7) Summary of findings 192 In summary, I found that Offending Machines 1 to 6 contained software/firmware that had been modified from the original version, as evidenced by the various changes in serial numbers, product codes and machine models. I accepted the plaintiffs’ submission that the altered rights management information showed that the object code in the Offending Machines was an “altered version” that was an unlicensed adaptation.315Foot Note 315×PFS at para 36(d). 193 The question, though, for the purposes of the primary infringement claim, was whether it wasthe defendantwho made the unlicensed adaptation, as the 3rd plaintiff claimed. Whether it was the defendant who made the unlicensed adaptation 194 Under s 31(1) of the Copyright Act, the defendant would be liable for copyright infringement if it had made the unlicensed adaptation or authorised the making of the unlicensed adaptation. 195 I found Poh’s attempts to downplay the technical skills of the defendant’s staff to be self-serving316Foot Note 316×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 32, lines 2–5; p 69, lines 1–3 and 7–10; p 70, lines 28–31., but even if I accepted that the defendant’s staff had some degree of technical proficiency, it would be a very different thing to say firstly that they must have the level of technical expertise required to carry out a range of changes to the software/firmware, including changes to allow for up-speeding (which the plaintiffs acknowledged to be a highly sophisticated process that they themselves had not engaged in);317Foot Note 317×PCS at paras 419, 421; Transcript, 16 July 2020 at p 29, lines 2–13 and p 34, lines 3–8; Transcript, 5 January 2021 at p 70, lines 22–25.and secondly, that the defendant’s staff were in fact the ones who made these changes. 196 I did not find that the evidence before me was enough for me to conclude that the defendant was the one who made the unlicensed adaptation of the software/firmware. In the circumstances, I found that the 3rd plaintiff was not able to prove its claim of primary infringement.",
        "Secondary infringement": "197 The plaintiffs had, however, another string to their bow. They pleaded in the alternative a claim of secondary infringement by importation for sale or hire. Under s 32 of the Copyright Act, there is secondary infringement where the article in question is an infringing copy. The plaintiffs submitted that under ss 32 and 33, all they were required to establish was that the defendant knew or ought reasonably to have known that the making of the article was carried out without the consent of the 3rd plaintiff.318Foot Note 318×PFS at para 38.The “making of the article” could be discerned from the fact that the defendant extensively refurbished the “used” machines which were intended to be destroyed by the plaintiff, the fact there were Offending Machines that had been up-speeded, modification of some Offending Machines from “DocuCentre” equipment to have “ApeosPort” functions and capabilities, and the probability that all the Offending Machines had altered or modified rights management information.319Foot Note 319×PFS at para 58.In this case, the “article” would be considered to be the whole of each of the Offending Machines.320Foot Note 320×PFS at para 62.The defendant was aware that the owner of the software/firmware was the plaintiffs and that the defendant was not licensed.321Foot Note 321×PFS at para 69. 198 The defendant submitted that there was no infringing article, but that if the court disagreed, then its position was that the making of the allegedly infringing article had been carried out with the consent of the 3rd plaintiff.322Foot Note 322×DCS at para 251.The “making” of an article under ss 32 and 33 of the Copyright Act referred to the process of manufacturing the article, which was substantially done by the plaintiffs.323Foot Note 323×DCS at para 266.In the alternative, the defendant submitted that it did not possess the requisite knowledge regarding the 3rd plaintiff’s lack of consent.324Foot Note 324×DCS at para 284.The defendant claimed, in addition, that the alleged software installations could not amount to a “making of the article”.325Foot Note 325×DRS 2 at para 17. 199 I reproduce below the relevant provisions of the Copyright Act: Infringement by importation for sale or hire 32.The copyright in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is infringed by a person who, without the licence of the owner of the copyright, imports an article into Singapore for the purpose of — (a) selling, letting for hire, or by way of trade offering or exposing for sale or hire, the article; (b) distributing the article — (i) for the purpose of trade; or (ii) for any other purpose to an extent that will affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright; or (c) by way of trade exhibiting the article in public, where he knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the making of the article was carried out without the consent of the owner of the copyright. Infringement by sale and other dealings 33.—(1) The copyright in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is infringed by a person who, in Singapore, and without the licence of the owner of the copyright — (a) sells, lets for hire, or by way of trade offers or exposes for sale or hire, an article; or (b) by way of trade exhibits an article in public, where he knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the making of the article constituted an infringement of the copyright or, in the case of an imported article, the making of the article was carried out without the consent of the owner of the copyright. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the distribution of any articles — (a) for the purpose of trade; or (b) for any other purpose to an extent that affects prejudicially the owner of the copyright concerned, shall be taken to be the sale of those articles. 200 Secondary infringement would be established if the defendant had (inter alia) without the licence of the plaintiffs, imported an article into Singapore for the purpose of selling the article, where it knew or ought reasonably to know that the making of the article was carried out without the consent of the plaintiffs. The rights of the copyright owner of the plaintiffs’ software/firmware include the right of adaptation; and I found in this case (as explained above at [159]–[192]) that the software/firmware found in the Offending Machines constituted an unlicensed adaption. I agreed with the plaintiffs that the “article” in this case refers to the whole of each of the Offending Machines.326Foot Note 326×PFS at para 62.Thus, the “making of the article” referred to the “making” of each Offending Machine, which was done by modifying the plaintiffs’ original machines without its consent. It was also clear that the defendant, who was not an authorised reseller, had – without the licence of the plaintiffs – imported the articles (the Offending Machines) into Singapore for the purpose of selling them, or had sold the Offending Machines in Singapore. 201 Lastly, the plaintiffs submitted that the defendant knew – and indeed, required – that its suppliers modify and alter the machines they imported, including installing step-down transformer plugs, upgrading software, and removing or changing serial numbers.327Foot Note 327×PCS at para 576.The defendant, for its part, countered that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of any software alterations made to the Offending Machines.328Foot Note 328×DCS at para 288. 202 While I was not able to conclude that it was thedefendantwho had modified the software/firmware on the Offending Machines, I was satisfied that the defendant knew or ought reasonably to have known that modifications had been made to the Offending Machines, and that this was done without the plaintiffs’ consent. I explain below my reasons for coming to this conclusion. 203 For a defendant to be found liable for secondary infringement under s 32 of the Copyright Act, it must be shown that the defendant “knows, or ought reasonably to know” that the making of the article he imports or offers for sale was carried out without the consent of the copyright owner. The same formulation – “knows, or ought reasonably to know” – appears in s 136 in the context of copyright infringement offences. InPublic Prosecutor v TeoAi Nee and another[1995] 1 SLR(R) 450 (“Teo Ai Nee”) at [45], the High Court considered the meaning of the phrase “knows, or ought reasonably to know” in the context of s 136 of the Copyright Act. The court held that the word “know” meant that a defendant would need to possess actual knowledge. The phrase “ought reasonably to know”, on the other hand, contemplated knowledge of circumstances which would put an honest and reasonable man on inquiry: this  would encompass (i) wilfully shutting one’s eyes to the obvious, (ii) wilfully and recklessly failing to make such inquiries as an honest and reasonable man would make, and (iii) knowledge of the circumstances which would indicate the facts to an honest and reasonable man. 204 The phrase “ought reasonably to know” was also considered by the CA inSingsungPte Ltd v LG 26 Electronics Pte Ltd (trading as L S Electrical Trading)[2016] 4 SLR 86 at [116] (“Singsung”), in the context of a secondary copyright infringement claim. There, the CA held that the relevant knowledge for this purpose “is not knowledge, as a matter of legal conclusion, that [the defendant] might be infringing copyright but knowledge, as a matter of fact, that [the defendant] might be using something that belonged to [the plaintiff] without its consent”. The CA held that the burden was on the defendant to show that it had conducted sufficient inquiries to dispel the prospect that it was about to use the copyrighted material without the copyright owner’s consent. 205 In this case, I found that the defendant knew, or ought reasonably to have known, about the modifications to the Offending Machines,at the timeit purchased the Offending Machines, and it also knew that the modifications to the Offending Machines were made without the plaintiffs’ consent. Even if I were to be wrong about this, I found nevertheless that the defendant knew about the modifications when the plaintiffs sent their letters of demand – and despite this knowledge, it persisted in selling the Offending Machines. 206 First, I found that the defendant had actual knowledge of the modifications to the Offending Machines at the time it purchased the Offending Machines. I noted that in cross-examination, Poh stated – in relation to Offending Machines 4, 5 and 6 – that “It was the same machine put up on the market. How can I…explainthat they have made changesto the machine? They are selling second-hand machines.” [emphasis added].329Foot Note 329×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 47, lines 4–6.In similar vein, Poh also testified that the defendant normally sold Fuji Xerox photocopiers without serial number labels on them; he conceded that Fuji Xerox would be able to “close off” the defendant’s “source of supply” from its suppliers if it were able to trace the exporters using the serial numbers, andthat was “why the exporterswould remove the serial numbers” [emphasis added].330Foot Note 330×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 68, lines 16–29.This showed that the defendant was well aware that there had been modifications to the Offending Machines at the time of purchase. 207 Even if I were wrong in coming to the above conclusion, I found in any event that the defendantought reasonably to haveknown about the modifications to the Offending Machines at the time it purchased them. Poh admitted in cross-examination that while he did not “tell” the defendant’s suppliers to modify the Fuji Xerox machines to be suitable for use in Singapore, “transformers would then have to be installed” [emphasis added]. He was extremely evasive about who would be doing the installation.331Foot Note 331×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 56, lines 1–28.Similarly, when asked about the sticker labels on the machines, Poh said: “The sticker label is just a piece of paper…If let’s say the film was originally written in the Japanese language and we had to use the machines in Singapore,we would have to change the sticker labels to English.” [emphasis added]332Foot Note 332×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 56, lines 12–15.In other words, Poh was actually admitting that the sticker labels on the machineswould have tobe changed– whether or not it was done directly by the defendant itself. Thus, at the very least, the defendant was shutting its eyes to the obvious. 208 Alternatively, the evidence before me was also sufficient to support a conclusion that the defendant had wilfully and recklessly failed to “make such inquiries as an honest and reasonable man would make” (Teo Ai Neeat [45]). Poh admitted that the defendant would not ask the supplier to verify whether the machines to be supplied were designated for decommissioning or destruction in their home countries.333Foot Note 333×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 55, lines 26–32.This showed that the defendant had conducted no inquiries “as to the provenance and ownership” of the Offending Machines (Singsungat [116]). In other words, not only did the defendant fail to ensure the veracity of its suppliers, it also failed to enquire into whether the machines it received were genuine, unmodified versions. 209 Further, I found that the defendant had actual knowledge that any modifications to the Offending Machines were carried out without the plaintiffs’ consent. This was admitted by Poh himself in cross-examination:334Foot Note 334×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 53, line 28–p 54, line 4. Ct: Counsel says that clearly Fuji Xerox did not authorise the installation of transformers on its copiers to change the voltage from 100V to 220V; agree or disagree? Poh: I agree but I need to explain. Ct: Yes. Poh: We, as parallel importers, are direct competitors of Fuji Xerox so why would Fuji Xerox authorise us to do such things? In fact, what Fuji Xerox wanted was to monopolise the market; why would they authorise such things? Similarly, Poh conceded that any up-speeding done by someone who was not from Fuji Xerox would be an unauthorised modification of the software in the photocopier.335Foot Note 335×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 69, lines 24–27. 210 For the reasons set out above, I found that at the time of purchase, the defendant knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the Offending Machines had been modified and that this had been done without the plaintiffs’ consent. 211 Lastly, even if the defendant was genuinely unaware of the modifications made to the Offending Machinesat the time of purchase, it would have been alerted to these modifications by 20 June 2014 (see [19] above) when it received the plaintiffs’ first letter of demand (the June 2014 Letter).336Foot Note 336×PCS at para 580; Poh AEIC at para 27.In his AEIC, Poh acknowledged that the defendant had received the June 2014 Letter and August 2014 Letter from the plaintiffs, and adduced a copy of each letter.337Foot Note 337×Poh AEIC at para 27; pp 320–321 (June 2014 Letter) and pp 323–327 (August 2014 Letter).Under cross-examination, Poh stated that in the letters of demand, the plaintiffs had said that the defendant was not allowed to use the plaintiffs’ photos on the defendant’s website, had mentioned “many other things such as, about trademarks and some changes”,338Foot Note 338×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 64, lines 22–28; at p 65, line 30–p 66 line 30.and had referred to “some changed serial numbers” in the machines sold by the defendant.339Foot Note 339×Transcript, 7 January 2021 at p 46, lines 17–25.As set out at [19] above, in the June 2014 Letter, the 2nd plaintiff’s then-solicitors stated,inter alia, that “[the defendant] [had] changed the label and the serial number of the FujiXerox photocopiers that you are marketing and selling”, and such conduct amounted “to a misrepresentation of the true identity of the subject product”,340Foot Note 340×AB Vol 3 at p 724.while in the August 2014 Letter, the 2nd plaintiff’s new solicitors stated that this “change of serial number in the display of our client’s product…entails unauthorized alteration of our client’s proprietary, embedded software program for operation of the product”.341Foot Note 341×AB Vol 3 at p 729, para 7(c).Despite receiving such notice, the defendant sold Offending Machines 5 and 6 in November 2014, and sold Offending Machines 1, 2 and 3 to GMC in 2016. 212 In summary, based on the evidence adduced, I was satisfied that the 3rd plaintiff had made out its case of secondary infringement under ss 32 and 33 of the Copyright Act.",
        "Section 260 of the Copyright Act: Rights management information": "213 I address next the 3rd plaintiff’s claim against the defendant in respect of infringement of its rights in rights management information which has been altered without its consent pursuant to s 260 of the Copyright Act. 214 The plaintiffs submitted that the computer software/firmware that is on the ROM of the Offending Machines is in the form of object code protected as a literary work under the Copyright Act, and the rights management information encoded in this computer software/firmware was the subject of the s 260 causes of action.342Foot Note 342×PFS at para 75.The rights management information includes the serial number, machine model, machine name and product code.343Foot Note 343×PCS at para 197.The plaintiffs can track every item or component of a Fuji Xerox Equipment using this information through its Traceability System.344Foot Note 344×PFS at para 78.The plaintiffs also affix a physical label on every machine where the said rights management information is incorporated into the surface of the Fuji Xerox Equipment, which is intended to be a permanent part of the machine.345Foot Note 345×PFS at para 79.These pieces of information constitute rights management information as they represent information which identifies the work or subject-matter, being numbers or codes that represent the information (s 258(d) of the Copyright Act).346Foot Note 346×PFS at para 80.Lastly, the defendant knew that the rights management information had been removed or altered without the 3rd plaintiff’s consent, and knew or ought reasonably to know that removal or alteration of the said rights management information would induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement (ss 260(2) and (3) of the Copyright Act).347Foot Note 347×PFS at para 108.Alternatively, the defendant had distributed or imported for distribution the rights management information relating to the 3rd plaintiff’s software/firmware, which had been altered without the 3rd plaintiff’s consent.348Foot Note 348×PCS at para 598(b). 215 The defendant argued that the information did not fall within the definition of rights management information under s 258 of the Copyright Act as it did not identify the author of the work,349Foot Note 349×DCS at para 295.did not identify the allegedly copyrighted works,350Foot Note 350×DCS at para 301.and did not contain information about the terms of use of the works.351Foot Note 351×DCS at para 310.Further, the defendant argued that it had not made changes to the alleged rights management information,352Foot Note 352×DCS at para 314.nor did it have actual or constructive knowledge that such alteration would induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement.353Foot Note 353×DCS at para 316. Whether information fell within definition of rights management information 216 I accepted the submission that the serial number, machine model, machine name and product code comprised part of the relevant rights management information in this case, as they constitute information whichinter aliaenables the copyright owner to track usage of its works, gives users confidence in the authenticity of the source of the work and certainty as to the conditions of its use, and prevents distribution of copies where such information has been removed or manipulated in order to induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement.354Foot Note 354×PFS at para 83.In my view, this information fell within s 258(d) of the Copyright Act as “any numbers or codes representing the information referred to”. Whether act of infringement made out 217 On the whole, as I stated at [196] above, I was not convinced that there was enough evidence to say that it wasthe defendantwho had made the unauthorised removal or alteration of rights management information in this case (s 260(2)(a) of the Copyright Act). However, I was satisfied that the 3rd plaintiff had made out the alternative claim against the defendant of distributing and/or importing for distribution rights management information which has been altered without the copyright owner’s consent under s 260(3) of the Copyright Act. 218 First, the rights management information had clearly been altered without the plaintiffs’ consent (s 260(3)(a) of the Copyright Act). The defendant had also distributed, or imported for distribution, the rights management information relating to the 3rd plaintiff’s software/firmware by importing and selling the Offending Machines containing this altered rights management information without the plaintiffs’ consent (s 260(3)(b) of the Copyright Act), and knowing that this rights management information had been altered without the plaintiffs’ consent (s 260(3)(c) of the Copyright Act; see [205]–[211] above). 219 Additionally, I found that the defendant must have known, or ought reasonably to have known, that the distribution or importation of the rights management information would induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement of the copyright in the software/firmware to which the rights management information related (s 260(3)(d)(i) of the Copyright Act). I found that the defendant knew its distribution of the altered rights management information would enable an infringement of the copyright in the software/firmware since, every time the Offending Machine was turned on, either by the defendant or its customers, the unlicensed adaptation of the software/firmware would be reproduced.355Foot Note 355×PFS at paras 94 and 97.Even if that was wrong, however, I found that the defendant at least knew that its distribution of the altered rights management information wouldconcealan infringement of the copyright in the software/firmware, because the altered information would make it harder for the plaintiffs to trace each machine in its traceability system. As I have noted, Poh testified that the defendant normally sold Fuji Xerox photocopiers without serial number labels on them, precisely because otherwise Fuji Xerox would be “able to trace the exporters” and “close off” the defendant’s “source of supply”: as Poh himself conceded, this was why “the exporterswould remove the serial numbers” [emphasis added].356Foot Note 356×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 68, lines 16–29.Poh thus knew only too well that the serial numbers on the machines were a means for the plaintiffs to trace the origin of the machines, and that removing the serial numbers would hamper the plaintiffs’ efforts in detecting whether there had been any infringement of its copyright in the software/firmware. 220 I add that while the defendant sought to argue that it was not required to check on or know anything about the software/firmware required to operate the machines and that it knew nothing about the changes made to the said software/firmware, I found the evidence proffered by the defendant to be entirely unbelievable; and I reiterate in particular that I found Poh to be a shifty and deceitful witness. Parallel imports 221 I also rejected the defendant’s belated attempt to rely on a defence of parallel imports in relation to the 3rd plaintiff’s claims of copyright infringement.357Foot Note 357×Defence at para 46.I agree with the 3rd plaintiff that in this connection, the defendant has presented (with respect) a distorted and misconceived interpretation of the concept of parallel imports. 222Inter alia, as the plaintiffs pointed out in their first set of reply submissions, the defendant stands on a totally different footing from a legitimate parallel importer who can show that its source (whether in Japan or elsewhere) purchased a machine legitimately and that the software/firmware on that machine is exactly that which was installed by the copyright owner or its licensor.358Foot Note 358×PRS at para 28.Not only did the defendant produce no such evidence, the testimony of its sole witness Poh – and in particular his admissions under cross-examination, alongside the obvious lies strewn throughout his testimony – led me to infer that the defendant was at all material times well aware of the unauthorised changes made to the 3rd plaintiff’s software/firmware (including the rights management information).",
        "Reliefs granted": "223 In summary, I found that the plaintiffs had made out their claims of trade mark infringement of the “ApeosPort” mark, passing off in respect of the “ApeosPort”, “DocuCentre” and “Fuji Xerox” marks, secondary infringement under ss 32 and 33 of the Copyright Act, and infringement of rights in their rights management information under s 260 of the Copyright Act. 224 Having regard to those of the plaintiffs’ claims which were made out, I found that the plaintiffs were entitled to the reliefs prayed for as follows: (a) 1st plaintiff: the order for an injunction; the order for delivery up and forfeiture or destruction; and the order for an inquiry as to damages, or, at the plaintiffs’ election in the alternative, an account of profits in respect of the infringement of the “ApeosPort” registration.359Foot Note 359×SOC at p 30, paras 1–3. (b) 3rd plaintiff: the order for an injunction; the order for delivery up and forfeiture or destruction; and the order for an inquiry as to damages, or at the plaintiffs’ election in the alternative, an account of profits, or statutory damages in lieu of damages, in respect of the infringement of the copyright in the 3rd plaintiff’s computer software/firmware in the relevant Fuji Xerox Equipment and the infringement of the 3rd plaintiff’s rights in the rights management information in such computer software/firmware.360Foot Note 360×SOC at pp 31–32, paras 4–6. (c) In respect of all the plaintiffs: the order for an injunction; the order for delivery up and/or destruction upon oath; and the order for an inquiry into damages or, at the plaintiffs’ election in the alternative, an account of profits for the passing-off by the defendant.361Foot Note 361×SOC at pp 32–33, paras 8–10. 225 I ordered the defendant to pay all sums which may be found to be due to the plaintiffs, with interest to run on such sums as may be found due at the rate of 5.33% from the date of judgment till payment. 226 As this trial was bifurcated, I ordered that the Registry was to conduct pre-trial conferences for the purpose of following up on the subsequent proceedings in respect of any inquiry into damages or account of profits. The Registrar conducting these pre-trial conferences shall give directions and timelines for the plaintiffs to make the necessary election in respect of the orders for an inquiry into damages or in the alternative an account of profits (and as another alternative, statutory damages in lieu of damages in the case of the infringement of the 3rd plaintiff’s copyright in the software/firmware and rights management information).",
        "Additional damages": "227 In respect of the 3rd plaintiff’s claim for additional damages under s 119(4) of the Copyright Act,362Foot Note 362×SOC at p 32, para 7.it was not disputed that the aim of an award of additional damages is punishment and deterrence, rather than to benefit the plaintiff, and such an award should not translate into an extraordinary profit for the plaintiff: see the judgment of Judith Prakash J (as she then was) inLotus Development Corpand another v Ong Seow Pheng and others[1996] 2 SLR(R) 514 (“Ong SeowPheng”) at [45]; and also the judgment of Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) inNew Line Productions, Incand another v Aglow Video Pte Ltd and others and other suits[2005] 3 SLR(R) 660 (“New Line Productions”) at [110]. 228 The plaintiffs submitted that it would be appropriate to fix a dollar sum per machine for which the number of machines could be the midpoint of the defendant’s estimate of 500 to 600 Fuji Xerox branded machines that it had imported in the last five years,ie550 machines;363Foot Note 363×PFS at para 123.and that additional damages should be at least $2.2 million (550 machines x $4,000).364Foot Note 364×PFS at para 128.The defendant countered that there was no basis for awarding statutory damages, and that even if there were such basis, the extent of infringement in the present case was much narrower compared to the cases cited by the plaintiffs.365Foot Note 365×DRS 2 at para 29. 229 Having considered the evidence and parties’ further submissions, I accepted the 3rd plaintiff’s submission that there was sufficient evidence of the scale and flagrancy of the defendant’s operations and its deplorable conduct to warrant an award of additional damages.Inter alia, on the defendant’s own admission, it had imported 500 to 600 Fuji Xerox branded machines over the last five years alone,366Foot Note 366×Transcript, 6 January 2021 at p 39, line 30–p 40, line 6.and the evidence showed that it had blatantly advertised these as “new” Fuji Xerox machines367Foot Note 367×AB Vol 5 at p 1289; AB Vol 9 at pp 2284, 2287–2288.despite its own admission at trial that at least some of the machines it imported were used machines (see [109] above). I have also found that the evidence showed the defendant to have gone through extremely circuitous and convoluted routes to obtain the machines, which included making use of companies whose existence appeared suspect (to say the least) (see [75]–[80] and [125] above) – in order, no doubt, to obfuscate its trail. Even after receiving letters from the plaintiffs’ solicitors in 2014, the defendant continued to market and sell its offending machines. 230 However, I did not accept the 3rd plaintiff’s submission that the additional damages should be computed by reference to the defendant’s profit per sale of Offending Machine and quantified globally at $2.2 million. There appeared to me to be no basis for the proposition that additional damages be quantified in this manner. I reiterate that additional damages are punitive in nature and are not meant to benefit a plaintiff by way of extraordinary profit. I also note that in the CA’s decision on the appeal inOng SeowPheng(inOng SeowPheng and othersvLotus Development Corpand another[1997] 2 SLR(R) 113 at [56]), the CA reduced the additional damages awarded to the plaintiffs from US$200,000 to US$100,000 after finding that, although the defendants had dealt in 6,720 infringing copies of the plaintiffs’ manuals and 31 infringing copies of their software programmes, there was no evidence of the defendants having further authorised retailers to make copies of the plaintiffs’ computer programmes (at [36]). InNew Line Productions, Tay J (as he then was) awarded the plaintiffs additional damages in the total sum of $99,940, being 9,994 sets of imported VCDs multiplied by $10 – but this was not a computation which he tied to any profits shown to be made by the defendants (at [112]). 231 In the present case, I was of the view that taking into account the factors considered by the courts inOng SeowPhengand inNew Line Productions(including the scale of the defendant’s operations, the lengths it went to in order to avoid detection of its wrongful activities, and the extent to which it had enriched itself at the expense of the copyright owner), a sum of $100,000 should be awarded to the 3rd plaintiff as additional damages under s 119(4) of the Copyright Act.",
        "Conclusion": "232 The plaintiffs having succeeded on most of their claims on liability, I was of the view that the costs of the plaintiffs obtaining judgment on liability (including the costs of the trial before me) should follow the event. I ordered that costs were to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiffs, to be taxed if not agreed within two weeks from the date of my decision. The costs of any subsequent inquiry into damages or account of profits were reserved to the court having conduct of such inquiry or accounting.
