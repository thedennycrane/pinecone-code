        "The claim": "14. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants were obliged under the\n\nbills of lading to discharge the entire Cherry cargo at Fujairah and alternatively, that\n\nthey were liable in tort for conversion of the oil.",
        "The defence": "15. The defendants denied the plaintiffs’ claims and made a\n\ncounterclaim which was subsequently withdrawn. At the end of the case, the main points of\n\nthe defence were identified as(a) the plaintiffs had no title to sue on the bills of lading because\n\n  they were not holders of the bills of lading as defined in the Bills of Lading Act (Cap\n\n  384) (\"the Act\");(b) the plaintiffs had no title to sue in conversion as they did not\n\n  have the immediate right of possession of the oil when the alleged conversion took place\n\n  in December 1997;(c) the defendants were not in breach of contract because they had\n\n  delivered the cargo to Metro, the plaintiffs’ agents, at Fujairah;(d) the defendants had acted on the instructions of the\n\n  plaintiffs’ agents, Metro at Fujairah;(defences (c) and (d) will be dealt with together under \"Delivery to Metro\")(e) the plaintiffs had clothed Metro with all the appearances of being\n\n  the owner of the cargo, and were bound by Metro’s acts, and(f) the plaintiffs had failed to prove that the defendants’ acts\n\n  caused their loss.Title to sue on the bills of lading16. Section 5 of the Act refers to a holder of a bill of lading as a\n\nperson \"with possession\" of the bill. This provision does not refer to physical\n\npossession specifically. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs cannot sue as the\n\nholders of the bill of lading because they were not in physical possession of the bill\n\nwhich was with Glencore UK. They contended that a holder of the bill of lading under the\n\nAct must have physical possession of the bill because the rights under the bill are only\n\npassed by the act of physically transferring the bill to the transferee.17. This line of defence called for an examination of the relationship\n\nbetween the plaintiffs and Glencore UK which led to the bill of lading going into the\n\nphysical possession of the latter.18. Glencore UK is a wholly owned subsidiary of the plaintiffs. The two\n\ncompanies are parties to a consulting and management agreement dated 1 January 1991 when\n\nthe plaintiffs were known as Marc Rich & Co AG and Glencore UK was known as Marc Rich\n\n& Co Ltd. Under the agreement Marc Rich & Co Ltd was to act,inter alia, as\n\na correspondent of Marc Rich & Co AG for the transmission of information,\n\ncorrespondence and documents and serve as the latter’s London liaison with bankers,\n\nfinanciers and charterparties. When Glencore UK gave written instructions to Banque Trad\n\nCredit Lyonnais on 2 February 1998 to forward the bill of lading to themselves the\n\ninstructions were expressly stated to be issued pursuant to that agreement. When the bill\n\nof lading was sent to Glencore UK, they received it as the agent of the plaintiffs with no\n\ninterest in it of their own.19. Defence counsel referred to\"The Shravan\"[1999] 4 SLR 194 where it was held that a party suing on a bill of lading as holder must be in\n\npossession of the bill at the time of the commencement of the action. The decision was of\n\nlittle assistance to the defendants’ contention because the questions whether\n\npossession for that purpose means physical possession and whether possession through an\n\nagent puts the principal in possession were not considered.20. There is a discussion on this point inCarver on Bills of Lading(1stEdn) at para 5-017 in the context of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act,\n\n1992 which is equivalent to the Bills of Lading Act:Possession held by agent. Where a bill of lading is transferred, e.g.\n\n  by a seller who has shipped goods in pursuance of a contract for the sale of those goods,\n\n  the actual possession of the bill may be acquired, not by the buyer himself, but by a\n\n  person who acts as his agent for the purpose of taking delivery of the goods from the\n\n  carrier. Under the 1855 [Bills of Lading] Act, contractual rights were not normally\n\n  transferred to the agent since property would not normally have passed to him. This\n\n  reasoning is obsolete now that the \"property gap\" of the 1855 Act has been\n\n  closed by the 1992 [Carriage of Goods by Sea] Act. But the question can now arise whether\n\n  it is the agent or his principal (the buyer) who is the \"holder\" of the bill for\n\n  the purposes of the 1992 Act.Where the person who receives the bill acts in a purely\n\n  ministerial capacity, there can be little doubt that possession of the bill will be\n\n  regarded as having been transferred to the buyer: this would be so in the common case\n\n  in which possession is acquired on behalf of a corporate buyer by a member of its staff.\n\n  It is less clear who is the \"holder\" of a bill which is transferred to an agent\n\n  who has been engaged as an independent contractor by the buyer for the purpose of taking\n\n  delivery of the goods from the ship. This was, for example the position inThe Aramis[1989] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 213, where the bills were \"indorsed by the shippers and by\n\n  … forwarding agents appointed by [the buyers] to obtain delivery of the goods and, in\n\n  the case of one consignment, to arrange for their onward carriage. The purpose of the\n\n  second of these indorsements (i.e. of that by the agents) is far from clear since the\n\n  bills were not transferred to any further parties by the agents but were simply presented\n\n  by the agents to the ship’s agents to claim delivery. It does not appear that the\n\n  bills were ever in the possession of the buyers themselves. Even where a bill of lading is\n\n  transferred to a buyer, that buyer may take delivery of the goods as agent for the seller.\n\n  This was the position inThe Aliakmon[1986] A.C. 785, where a c. & f. seller\n\n  sent to the buyer a bill of lading which named the buyer as consignee and which had\n\n  (unnecessarily, it seems) also been indorsed to the buyer, and the buyer, being unable to\n\n  pay in accordance with the originally agreed terms, agreed to take delivery of the goods\n\n  as agent of the seller. The actual decision was that the buyer had no cause of action\n\n  against the carrier either in contract or in tort in respect of damage done to the goods\n\n  by the carrier’s breach of the contract of carriage, even though the resulting loss\n\n  fell on the buyer, the risk having passed to him on shipment. In a later case [White v.\n\n  Jones[1995] 2 A.C. 207 at 265], Lord Goff has said that such a situation would now be\n\n  covered by the 1992 Act, and this seems to mean that the buyer could now sue the carrier\n\n  in contract as lawful holder of the bill, even if he held it as agent of the seller. It\n\n  would seem to follow that, on facts such as those inThe Aramis,the\n\n  \"forwarding agents\" could likewise now acquire contractual rights against the\n\n  carriers, and that under section 2(4) of the Act they could exercise these rights for the\n\n  benefit of their principals, the buyers. But it is submitted that this does not exclude\n\n  the possibility of such rights being acquired also by the principal.The Act does not\n\n  define \"possession,\" which is a sufficiently flexible concept to allow for the\n\n  possibility of actual possession being held by one person and constructive possession\n\n  being held, at least for some purposes, by another.(Emphasis added)21. There is no justification to confine possession to physical\n\npossession in this case. The rights of the holder cannot be diminished because it had\n\narranged for the bill to be kept by its agent which has no separate interest in it.22. Counsel for the defendants went further and argued that\n\n\"(e)ven if the Court is of the view that an agent may hold a bill of lading on behalf\n\nof his principal under the Act for the purpose of suit, it is our submission that Glencore\n\nU.K. were not agents of the Plaintiffs for such purpose.\" This suggestion that the\n\nagent must not only be an agent, but be an agent for the purpose of the suit was wholly\n\nwithout authority, and the argument was not developed beyond the sentence set out. There\n\nis no justification for this additional requirement that I can see.23. Another line of argument taken was that Glencore UK cannot be the\n\nplaintiffs’ agents because the agreement between the companies specified that it\n\nshall not be construed to establish a partnership, association or joint venture between\n\nthe parties, or constitute Marc Rich & Co Ltd an employee of Marc Rich & Co AG,\n\nand the former was to retain its capacity as an independent contractor. This does not\n\nfollow because there is nothing to prevent an independent contractor from being an agent.\n\nThe agreement clearly established Glencore UK as the plaintiffs’ agent for the\n\npurposes stated.24. I found that Glencore UK was holding the bill of lading simply as\n\nthe agent of the plaintiffs for the transmission of documents with bankers, financiers and\n\ncharterparties, and the plaintiffs were the holder of the bill for the purposes of the\n\nAct. This finding also addressed the defendants’ complaint that agency was not\n\npleaded by the plaintiffs. Since a holder of a bill of lading can be holding it while it\n\nis in the physical possession of its agent, that is a matter of evidence that need not be\n\npleaded. The plaintiffs had made clear in their evidence that the bill was in the physical\n\npossession of Glencore UK pursuant to the agreement.25. Counsel for the defendants also referred to the joint report of the\n\nLaw Commission and Scottish Law Commission entitled \"Rights of Suit in respect of\n\nCarriage of Goods by Sea\" which contributed to the enactment of the Carriage of Goods\n\nby Sea Act 1992. Counsel noted that the Commission proposed that agents should be entitled\n\nto sue as holders of bills of lading even if they did not suffer any loss. He went on to\n\nsubmit that where the holder of a bill of lading is the agent, the principal has no title\n\nto sue since these rights vest in the agent. The first proposition that an agent is\n\nentitled to sue presented no difficulty, but the second proposition that the principal\n\nshould not be entitled does not follow. The principal has the right to sue already. The\n\nlaw was changed to empower the agent who hitherto cannot sue to sue. The change did not\n\nconfer the right to sue on the agent in substitution for the principal’s right. The\n\nagent’s new right runs with the principal’s, not in its place.",
        "Title to sue in conversion": "26. It is generally accepted that for a person to sue in conversion he\n\nmust have actual possession or the immediate right of possession of the goods alleged to\n\nbe converted at the time of conversion (seeClerk & Lindsell on Torts18thEdn paras 14-46 & 14-48). The defendants’ argument was that the defendants did\n\nnot have either of that when the \"Cherry\" was in Fujairah in December 1997.27. The rule is not inflexible, and the title to sue may be transferred\n\nfrom a preceding party. InBristol & West of England Bank v Midland Railway Co[1891] 2 QB 653 cheese was sold and shipped from Canada to England under bills of lading\n\nwhich provided that the goods were to be delivered to the order of the consignor or his\n\nassigns. The consignor drew bills of exchange on the consignee and sold the bills of\n\nexchange with the bills of lading endorsed in blank annexed, to the Toronto Bank in\n\nCanada. The Toronto Bank then sent the bills of exchange and bills of lading to the City\n\nBank, their agents in London. On arrival in England cheese was delivered to the defendants\n\nto the order of the shipowners who were induced by the consignee to deliver the cheese to\n\nhim without producing a delivery order from the shipowners. When the bills of exchange\n\nbecame due the consignee requested the plaintiff bank to advance him the money to take up\n\nthe bills. The plaintiff bank advanced the money and received the bills of exchange and\n\nbills of lading from City Bank, and then they obtained the delivery order from the\n\nshipowner in exchange for the bills of lading. When they presented the delivery order to\n\nthe defendants, they could not collect the cheese which had already been taken by the\n\nconsignee. The plaintiff bank sued the defendants for conversion. The defence raised was\n\nthat the plaintiffs’ action could not be maintained because the cheese was released\n\nto the consignee before the plaintiffs acquired any title to them. The defence was\n\nrejected by the Court of Appeal. Fry LJ held that Toronto Bank’s right of property on\n\nthe goods as pledgees was transferred to City Bank and then to the plaintiff bank, which\n\nthen had the right to sue, although it became the pledgee after the goods were released to\n\nthe consignee.28. The case dealt with the plaintiff bank’s title to the goods,\n\nand not to its immediate right of possession, but that is not a material difference. The\n\nissue was the title to sue, and the reasoning would be the same whether it is title to sue\n\nby having title in the goods or having the immediate right of possession. In December 1997\n\nBanque Trad-Credit Lyonnais held the bills of lading and had the immediate right of\n\npossession. When they endorsed it to Credit Lyonnais which then endorsed and delivered\n\nthem to the plaintiffs’ agent Glencore UK, that right was passed to the plaintiffs,\n\nand like the plaintiffs in the case discussed, the title to sue in conversion was\n\ntransferred.",
        "Delivery to Metro": "29. The defendants contended that they had fulfilled their obligation\n\nto deliver the oil by complying with the instructions of Metro. They drew a distinction\n\nbetween the term \"discharge\" used in the instructions and the term\n\n\"deliver\" used in the bill of lading and contended that delivery occurs not upon\n\ndischarge of the cargo, but when the cargo is placed in the control of the cargo receiver.30. They referred to a discourse on the duty to deliver under a bill of\n\nlading at p 142 ofVoyage Chartersby Julian Cooke and others:(D)elivery of the cargo is the final obligation of the shipowner under\n\n  the charterparty. It brings about the termination of the bailment and therefore, generally\n\n  speaking, it makes the point of time at which the carrier’s responsibility for safe\n\n  custody of the goods comes to an end. However, the general rule may be varied by special\n\n  terms of the contract of affreightment, frequently found in bills of lading, which provide\n\n  that the carrier’s responsibility shall cease as soon as the goods are discharged\n\n  from the ship, and before they are delivered to the consignee.What constitutes deliveryIt has been said that delivery occurs when \"the goods are so\n\n  completely under the control of the consignee that he may do what he likes with them\"\n\n  (British Shipowners v. Grimon(1876) 3 Rett. 968, 972), or when they are\n\n  \"placed under the absolute dominion and control of the consignees\" (Chartered\n\n  Bank v. British India S.N. Co.[1909] A.C. 369, 375). In practice, upon the discharge\n\n  of the goods from the ship they are frequently in the custody of agents or contractors\n\n  rather than the shipowner or consignee themselves, and in those circumstances delivery\n\n  will occur when the goods are placed in the hands of an agent of the consignee. Thus, inBritish\n\n  Shipowners v. Grimondand inKnight v. Fleming(1898) 25 Rett. 1070, it was\n\n  held that delivery occurred and the shipowner'’ responsibility for the goods\n\n  therefore ceased when they had been passed over the ship’s raid into the hands of\n\n  harbour porters employed by the consignee. The same contractor may initially take\n\n  possession of the goods as agent of the shipowner and later, when the shipowner’s\n\n  obligations as regards discharge had been fulfilled, remain in possession thereafter as\n\n  agent of the consignee. …The effect of the requirement that delivery involves the placing of the\n\n  goods under the complete control of the consignee is that, even when the shipowner’s\n\n  obligations regarding discharge are complete, and the goods are in the hands of an\n\n  independent warehouse, delivery will not be regarded as complete so long as the shipowner\n\n  is maintaining any lien or right of disposition over the goods, and the bill of lading\n\n  remains in force as a document of title until all the shipowner’s rights of\n\n  disposition have ceased to exist.31. Reliance was also placed on Lord Hobhouse’s judgement inThe\n\n\"Berge Sisar\"[2001] 1 LLR 663 where he said in para 36Taking delivery in pars. (a) and (c) [of s 3(1) Carriage of Goods by\n\n  Sea Act 1992] means, as I have said, the voluntary transfer of possession from one person\n\n  to another. This is more than just co-operating in the discharge of the cargo from the\n\n  vessel. Discharge and delivery are distinct aspects of the international carriage of\n\n  goods…. Although the normal time for delivering cargo to the receiver may be at the\n\n  time of its discharge from the vessel, that is not necessarily so. There may be a through\n\n  contract of carriage. The goods may need to be unpacked from a container. The vessel may\n\n  need to discharge its cargo without delay into a terminal. … The delivery to which\n\n  s.3 is referring is that which involves a full transfer of the possession of the relevant\n\n  goods by the carrier to the holder of the bill of lading. The surrender of the relevant\n\n  endorsed bill of lading to the carrier or his agent before or at the time of delivery will\n\n  ordinarily be an incident of such delivery.32. It is clear that delivery of a cargo does not necessarily include\n\nits discharge from the vessel, although that may often be the case. If the carrier is\n\ninstructed to retain the cargo on board at the discharge port so that it can be on-carried\n\nto another destination, the carrier would have delivered the cargo by keeping the cargo on\n\nboard so that it can proceed on the next voyage. The instructions received by the carrier\n\nmust be considered to determine whether delivery is made.33. The plaintiffs’ instructions to Metro were specific, to\n\n\"discharge into M.T. Metrotank and or any other vessel and or shoretanks on\n\ninstructions by Metro local representative.\"34. These discharge instructions to Metro did not reach the\n\n\"Cherry\". Metro issued separate voyage instructions of their own to the vessel.\n\nOn 24 November 1997, before the receipt of the plaintiffs’ discharge instructions,\n\nMetro instructed the \"Cherry\" that \"If Fujairah will be declared as final\n\ndischport [discharge port]cargo will bedischargedaccording to\n\ninstructions of‘Metro storage’ coordinator\" (emphasis added) and on\n\n6 December, after Fujairah was confirmed to be the discharge port, they issued further\n\ninstructions that \"You are kindly requested to followlocal instructionsfrom\n\n‘Metro storage’coordinator\" (Emphasis added)35. While delivery need not involve discharge in every case, in this\n\ncase it clearly did. The defendants claimed that they had received and acted in compliance\n\nwith the discharge instructions. The plaintiffs disputed that and maintained that their\n\ninstructions were to discharge the fuel oil into the storage facilities at Fujairah. On\n\nthe face of the plaintiffs’ instructions the carrier was to discharge all the oil\n\ninto the facilities, and anything short of that would not constitute full delivery\n\naccording to their instructions.36. The defence relied on the concluding words in the discharge\n\ninstructions to ‘discharge into M.T. Metrotank and or any other vessel and or\n\nshoretank as instructed by Metro local representative\" as evidence that Metro were\n\nthe plaintiffs’ agents for the receipt of the cargo. The argument was that the\n\ndefendants had acted on the instructions of Metro representatives at Fujairah when they\n\nunloaded part of the Cherry cargo, took on more oil, and carried on with her voyage from\n\nFujairah.37. The master of the \"Cherry\" knew that Metro operated the\n\nstorage facilities at Fujairah. The vessel must liase with the Metro representatives on an\n\noperational level to discharge oil into the facilities. The master has to be told of the\n\nplace, time, rate, etc of discharge. When the plaintiffs issued the instructions for the\n\ndefendants to comply with Metro’s instructions they were not constituting the Metro\n\nrepresentatives their agents for issuing or changing discharge instructions. They were\n\ndirecting the \"Cherry\" to work with those representatives to carry out their\n\ndischarge instructions.38. The instructions received by the master of the \"Cherry\"\n\nfrom Metro were to comply with the \"local instructions\" of the Metro storage\n\ncoordinator. That would be instructions in connection with the storage of the oil at the\n\nfacilities because the storage coordinator has control over the facilities. It cannot be\n\nhis role to determine for the vessel or the cargo owners whether to discharge, or to\n\ndecide how much to discharge when a vessel had arrived at Fujairah. When instructions were\n\nreceived from the discharge coordinator to discharge only a part of the cargo the\n\ndefendants should be aware that if they accepted them without question, they may be blamed\n\nfor failing to discharge. In such a situation, they should seek confirmation whether the\n\nobligation to discharge was varied, or to give notice that compliance is not possible\n\nbecause of the storage coordinator’s instructions.39. Instead of doing that, the defendants became parties to reports and\n\ndocuments put up to represent that full discharge had actually taken place. These include\n\na Dry Tank Certificate, a OBQ (On Board Quantity) Report, Tank Inspection Certificate,\n\nwhich the chief officer signed with the knowledge that they were untrue and a Discharge\n\nTime Sheet the master signed which was also untrue. The master and chief officer explained\n\nthat false documents were necessary to \"close the account for the previous\n\nvoyage\" and to protect the vessel from claims on the vessel and defence counsel\n\nsuggested that Metro wanted the documents, and the defendants were happy to oblige.\n\nApparently little thought was given to their contractual obligations as carriers.",
        "The plaintiffs were bound by the fraudulent acts of Metro": "40. The defendants contended that(T)he Defendants should not be liable for the balance of the oil\n\n  cargoes.The Instructions given by Metro to the Defendants were given by Metro as\n\n  agents acting on behalf of and within the scope of the authority conferred by their\n\n  principal, the Plaintiffs who had delegated to them the task of dealing with the\n\n  Defendants and taking delivery of the goods.The fact that this task was performed by\n\n  Metro contrary to the instructions of their principal or even in fraud of their principal\n\n  would not take their acts outside the scope of their employment, based on the classic\n\n  principles stated by the House of Lords inLloyd v. Grace Smith[1912] A.C. 716.(Emphasis added)41. The principle inLloyd v Grace, Smith & Cothat a\n\nprincipal is liable for the fraud of his agent acting within the scope of his authority\n\nwhether the fraud is committed for the benefit of the principal or the benefit of the\n\nagent is settled law. To avail themselves to the protection offered by the principle, the\n\ndefendants have to establish that Metro’s instructions were issued within the scope\n\nof their authority. They faced two difficulties here.42. First, in the voyage instructions, the Metro representatives at\n\nFujairah were characterised as storage coordinators. By the instructions their role was to\n\ncoordinate the storage of the oil at the facilities, not decide whether and how much of\n\nthe oil is to be discharged. If they purported to do that, it was outside their authority\n\nas storage coordinators. Second, the defendants did not regard Metro as anyone’s\n\nagents. Their case was that they believed that Metro were the owners of the cargo, and\n\ndealt with them on that basis. The principle inLloyd v Grace, Smith & Codoes\n\nnot operate on these facts.",
        "The plaintiffs had clothed Metro with the appearance of ownership of the cargo": "43. The defendants complained that the plaintiffs did not reveal to\n\nthem that they were the sub-charterers. They alleged that the plaintiffs wanted to hide or\n\nconceal their identity as sub-charterers.44. While it is true that the plaintiffs did not notify the defendants\n\ndirectly of their interest in the cargo (their explanation being that they directed their\n\ncommunications on the shipment to Metro with whom they had the voyage charterparty), they\n\ndid not conceal their interest. In the discharge instructions, they directed that they\n\nwere to be identified as the receivers of the cargo.45. In any event, the defendants knew of the plaintiffs’\n\nsub-charter. This came out through the evidence of Odisseas Valatsas, in-house chartering\n\nbroker of DynacomQ. If there is a subcharter from your time charterer to a subcharterer,\n\n  is it also not uncommon that you, as a head owner, will not be aware of the identity of\n\n  the subcharterer?A. No, your Honour. We would always know about that.There are no really secretive subcharters in this market.Q. Can you tell us how you would know of the identity of the\n\n  subcharterer?A. Our charterer would know this.Q. Your charterer would tell you?A. Yes.Q. Are they obliged to tell you?A. They are, of course they are, because you are carrying somebody\n\n  else’s cargo, so you must be aware of that.",
        "The defendants did not cause the plaintiffs’ loss": "46. The defendants contended that even if they were in breach of the\n\ncarriage contract, they were not accountable for the plaintiffs’ loss. They asserted\n\nthat the plaintiffs’ case must be that the defendants had discharged all the oil at\n\nFujairah, they would not have suffered loss. They went on to say that if all the oil was\n\ndischarged at Fujairah, Metro would have sold the oil to other parties and shipped it out\n\nby other vessels. That being the case, the plaintiffs’ loss was\n\n\"inevitable\", and cannot be said to be caused by the defendants.47. The whole argument was flawed. The onus on the plaintiffs was to\n\nprove that the oil was lost, and that the defendants caused the loss. They did not have to\n\nestablish that they would not have suffered loss through other causes. No support was\n\ncited for this proposition. There is no basis for it because no one can tell that the oil\n\nwould not be lost in other ways if it was discharged at Fujairah. It could, for example,\n\nbe stolen or delivered to a wrong party. If the defendants assert that the oil would be\n\nlost, they have to establish that. There was also no basis for assuming that the oil would\n\nbe sold and shipped by Metro if it was stored in the facilities. While that may happen,\n\nits fate in storage is entirely a matter of conjecture, and it was by no means inevitable\n\nthat the oil would be lost.48. There is another objection to the argument. Assuming that if the\n\noil was discharged into the facilities, it would be sold and shipped by Metro, the\n\nplaintiffs would have recourse against Metro. When the oil was lost as it happened without\n\nbeing sold or shipped by them, there is no recourse against them. By the defendants’\n\nargument the plaintiffs’ oil disappeared into a legal black hole with no recourse\n\nagainst the defendants or Metro.49. The plaintiffs have established their claims against the defendants\n\non the bills of lading and in conversion in relation to the Cherry cargo that was not\n\ndischarged at Fujairah.",
        "The \"Epic\" and \"Addax\" actions": "50. The facts, issues and arguments discussed in the \"Cherry\"\n\naction were similar to those in the \"Epic\" and \"Addax\" actions. The\n\nfindings I have made in the \"Cherry\" action apply to these two actions. There\n\nare factual differences, principally that 75,779 mt of oil was carried on the\n\n\"Addax\" and none of it was discharged at Fujairah, while 81,395 mt was carried\n\non the \"Epic\", of which 30,000 mt was discharged, but they are not material to\n\nthe resolution of the issues raised.51. In line with my findings, the plaintiffs have established their\n\nclaims on the bills of lading and in conversion for the undischarged cargoes on the\n\n\"Epic\" and the \"Addax\".52. I therefore order that judgment be entered for the plaintiffs in\n\nthese three actions for the cargoes which were not discharged or not fully discharged with\n\ncosts, with damages to be assessed by the Registrar.",
        "The Hyperion cargo": "53. The plaintiffs had purchased another quantity of 72,781 mt of oil\n\nfrom Metro. They entered into a voyage charterparty with Metro to carry the oil from\n\nBandar Mahshahr, Iran to Fujairah on the \"Hyperion\". After the\n\n\"Hyperion\" arrived at Fujairah on 4 December 1997 32,635 mt of the oil was\n\ndischarged from the \"Hyperion\" and loaded on the \"Cherry\", was carried\n\non to Pork Dickson, Malaysia and was lost to the plaintiffs. As in the case of the Cherry\n\ncargo, the bill of lading was not with the plaintiffs when the oil was lost, but was\n\ntransferred to them later, before the action was commenced. The plaintiffs claimed in\n\nconversion for the transhipped oil, but they did not claim as holders of the bill of\n\nlading as the \"Hyperion\" was a Metro vessel.54. The circumstances of the transhipment were not disclosed. The\n\ndefendants admitted that they carried the oil from Fujairah to Port Dickson on the\n\n\"Cherry\" but did not explain whether it was carried by them as carriers, owners\n\nor in any other capacity.55. When a party interferes with the goods of another, his intention in\n\nso acting may be relevant when he has dealt with the goods as an agent or bailee, but it\n\nis not relevant if he took or used the goods as his own. As Atkin J explained inLancashire\n\nand Yorkshire Railway Company, London and North Western Railway Company, and Graeser Ltd v\n\nMacNicoll(1918) 118 LT 596 at 598 –It appears to me plain that dealing with goods in a manner inconsistent\n\n  with the right of the true owner amounts to a conversion, providing it is also established\n\n  that there is an intention on the part of the defendant in so doing to deny the\n\n  owner’s right or to assert a right which is inconsistent with the owner’s right.\n\n  But that intention is conclusively proved if the defendant has taken the goods as his own\n\n  or used the goods as his own. …The cases wherethe intention of the\n\n  defendant becomes material are cases where the goods have come into the possession of\n\n  somebody who acts as an agent orbailee, and where the dealing with the goods\n\n  is a transfer of the custody from himself to somebody else, and where it may well be that\n\n  the intention is not to exercise any right inconsistent with the right of the true owner.\n\n  In those cases the question of intention becomes material. In a case where a man deals\n\n  with goods as his own, no such question can arise.(Emphasis added)56. This reflected Blackburn J’s statement inHollins v Fowler(1875) LR 7 HL 757 at pages 766-7 that(O)n principle, one who deals with goods at the request of the person\n\n  who has the actual custody of them, in thebona fidebelief that the customer is\n\n  the true owner, or has the authority of the true owner, should be excused for what he does\n\n  if the act is of such a nature as would be excused if done by the authority of the person\n\n  in possession57. The facts before me were that oil from the \"Hyperion\"\n\nbelonging to the plaintiffs was carried on the defendants’ vessel \"Cherry\"\n\nfrom Fujairah to Port Dickson without their consent, resulting in the loss of the oil.\n\nThat isprima faciea case of conversion. If the defendants had dealt with the oil\n\ninnocently as contractual carriers, that could exonerate them from liability, but that was\n\nnot raised or proved, and the defence is not available. Consequently the plaintiffs are\n\nalso entitled to judgment and costs in this claim, with damages to be assessed by the\n\nRegistrar.",
        "Costs": "58. In view of the length of the hearing, the multitude of issues\n\nraised and the exceptional number of documents involved, I certify that the\n\nplaintiffs’ costs are to be taxed for two counsel.Sgd:Kan Ting ChiuJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
