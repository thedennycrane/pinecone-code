        "Analysis": "24     I shall start by considering the opposing views of counsel as to the effect of the Court of Appeal’s decision inCentrepoint Shopping Centre([20(c)]supra). In that case, the management corporation of a shopping complex (“the MCST” or “the appellant”) licensed various parties to use certain areas in the common property (“the Spaces”) for a fee. The Chief Assessor included the Spaces in the Valuation List for the assessment of property tax and the Comptroller of Property Tax duly issued notices of assessment in respect of each of those Spaces. The MCST appealed without success to the Valuation Review Board and thence to the High Court where it fared no better. Upon the MCST’s further appeal, the question to be considered by the Court of Appeal was, as below, whether the Spaces in the shopping complex were exigible to property tax. This involved an interpretation of s  2(7) of the PTA which provides: In assessing the annual value ofany property which comprises a lot the title of which is issued under the Land Titles (Strata) Act(Cap.  158) – (a)    the subsidiary proprietor of the lot shall be deemed to be the owner thereof; (b)    the annual value of the lot shall be determined as if that lot comprised a freehold estate in land; and (c)    no separate annual value shall be attributed to the land upon which the subdivided building stands. [emphasis added] 25     Counsel for the MCST argued that on a true construction, the subject matter of s  2(7),ie, “property which comprises a lot the title of which is issued under the Land Titles (Strata) Act” was not limited to a strata lot. He contended that the property whose annual value was to be assessed was property which included the relevant share of the common property owned by the subsidiary proprietor of the lot. If counsel was correct, it would have meant that once all the strata lots within the shopping complex had been assessed to property tax, the common property would also have been assessed to property tax indirectly under the assessment of the strata lots. Therefore no further assessment could be raised against the Spaces. The Court of Appeal rejected that contention and held after comparing s  2(7) of the PTA with s  3(1) of the LTSA that the strata lot and the common property were mutually exclusive so that there was no impediment to raising the assessments against the Spaces. It reasoned at [6]: “Common property” as defined in s 3(1) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap  158, 1999  Rev Rd) (“LTSA”) means: (a)    in relation to any land and building comprised or to be comprised in a strata title plan, such part of the land and building — (i)not comprised in any lotor proposed lot in that strata title plan … The similarity in the language of s  2(7) of the PTA and this definition rules out the construction advanced by counsel for the appellant. In the same way that the definition of “common property” excludes property comprised in any lot, “property which comprises a lot” in s  2(7) of the PTA excludes common property; they are mutually exclusive. [emphasis added] 26En passant, the Court of Appeal did allow that it was unrealistic to suggest that (following the definition of “annual value” in s  2(1) of the PTA) “the gross amount at which [a lot] can reasonably be expected to be let” will not have taken into account the enjoyment to be derived from facilities and amenities afforded by the common property. However, that was far from supporting the contention of the appellant in that case that the annual value of each strata lot included a proportion of the gross amount at which the common property could be let. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal held that property tax was chargeable where, instead of being held for enjoyment in common by all occupants of strata lots, parts of the common property were let or licensed for a fee. 27     In the light of the above, the reasoning of the Board (that “[t]o differentiate the maintenance of the common parts from that within the four walls of the strata unit would be out of sync with the approach of the LTSA, PTA and the Court of Appeal”) is, with respect, inconsistent with the decision of the Court of Appeal inCentrepoint Shopping Centre([20(c)]supra). 28     The Chief Assessor’s argument (that since “each individual subsidiary proprietor has ownership over the common property, they should also bear any maintenance or repair to such areas, andtherefore such costs ought to be included in the assessment of the annual value of the individual strata lots”) [emphasis added] is similarly untenable. That all subsidiary proprietors have to bear their share of maintenance and repair costs for the common property is a truism; it is specifically provided for in the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act  2004 (“BMSM Act”). What is difficult to understand is how the italicised conclusion follows from that premise. It appears to me to be anon sequitur. Ironically, such a contention also appears similar to the argument of the Appellant ([25] above) inCentrepoint Shopping Centre([20(c)]supra) which the Chief Assessor successfully resisted. 29     With regard to the reasoning of the Board in [20(b)] above, I do not thinkBell Property Trust([10]supra) can be said to be inapplicable in the context of our strata titles system. It was followed by our High court inBCH No1([12]supra) and referred to by our Court of Appeal inBCH No2([14]supra) as being consonant with the principle of exclusion enunciated in their judgment. The fact that under the strata titles system, the common property is owned by all the subsidiary proprietors as tenants-in-common in proportion to their respective share value does not, to my mind, blur the distinction between the tenanted premises (ie, the strata lot) and the common property. As we earlier noted from s 2(7) of the PTA and the decision of the Court of Appeal inCentrepoint Shopping Centre([20(c)]supra), the “annual value” of the strata lot still refers only to the gross amount at which that strata lot can reasonably be expected to be let; the expenses of repair, insurance, maintenance or upkeep,etc, which may be included in such gross amount, all relate to the strata lot. I move on to consider the Board’s reasoning in [20(a)]. 30     In my opinion, the Board took too restrictive a view when it limited allowable “deductions” to what it called the “service charge exception” established byChartered Bank([9]supra) andBCH No1([12]supra). At the time of its decision, it did not have the benefit of the Court of Appeal’s decision inBCH No2([14]supra) which came later. That decision, as I earlier noted, makes clear that what is to be excluded in the determination of annual value is remuneration of any kind paid by the tenant which is unrelated to the elements of rent or letting. 31     On that basis, it ought to follow that no principled distinction could be drawn between contributions to the management fund or (as the parties call it) maintenance contributions (which the Chief Assessor allowed to be excluded) and those to the sinking fund or the special levy (which he disallowed). All of them are unrelated to the elements of rent or letting of the property,ie, the strata lot. But, as was discussed earlier ([13] and [16] above), there is the further requirement that the payment by the tenant must, incharacterandquantum, bebona fidein return for something other than the use and occupation of the property; if the payment, or any part of it, is not, then there is no justification for excluding the payment or (as the case may be) the relevant part from the gross rental in arriving at the annual value. This calls for some elaboration. 32     With regard to thecharacterof the contribution borne by the tenant, the management fund, the sinking fund and special levy must be collected for purposes which may reasonably be said to be of service or benefit to the tenant before their exclusion from the gross rental is permitted. The difficulty is that the funds may not be exclusively for such purposes. Take, for example, the management fund. Under s  39(1) of the BMSM Act, one of the purposes for which moneys in the management fund may be used is the payment of insurance premiums. As can be seen from s  71 of the BMSM Act, the management corporation is required to effect insurance – (a)    in respect of any occurrence against which it is required by law to insure, including that required under the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Cap  254, 1998  Rev Ed); (b)    in respect of damage to property, death or bodily injury occurring upon the common property for which the management corporation could become liable in damages; and (c)    against the possibility of the subsidiary proprietors becoming jointly liable by reason of a claim arising in respect of any other occurrence against which the management corporation, pursuant to a resolution, decides to insure. It can be seen that such insurance benefits the management corporation and the subsidiary proprietors but not the tenant. Strictly, therefore, any part of the contribution to the management fund that is applied towards the payment of the insurance premium should not be excluded from the gross rental. 33     Consider also s  70 of the BMSM Act. This section requires the management corporation to keep every subdivided building insured under a “damage policy” to provide for its rebuilding and replacement or repair in the event of its destruction or damage. To the extent that such insurance is for the benefit of the strata lot and therefore within the definition of annual value, it ought not to be excluded. 34     Be that as it may, since the Chief Assessor has allowed the exclusion of contributions to the management fund, I need go no further. I therefore go on to consider the sinking fund. 35     Section  29(1)(b) of the BMSM Act imposes a duty on the management corporation to “properly maintain and keep in a state of good and serviceable repair” (and, where reasonably necessary, renew or replace wholly or in part) the common property and,inter alia: (i)     any fixture or fitting comprised or fitting comprised in the common property; or (ii)    any fixture or fitting comprised in any strata lot but intended to be used for the servicing or enjoyment of the common property. Section  29(1)(d), however, goes beyond maintenance and repair, and obliges the management corporation, when directed by a special resolution, [T]o install or provideadditionalfacilities or makeimprovementsto the common propertyfor the benefit of the subsidiary proprietorsconstituting the management corporation. [emphasis added] 36     In line therewith, under s  38(4) read with s  39(2) of the BMSM Act, the contributions towards the sinking fund may be used forimprovementsto the common property and theacquisition of movable property. Unlike painting, repairs to the common property or renewal or replacement of fixtures and fittings where necessary (as envisaged in s  29(1)(b) of the BMSM Act), expenditure from the sinking fund could extend to the installation of additional facilities or the making of improvements to the common property for the benefit of the subsidiary proprietors constituting the management corporation (as envisaged in s  29(1)(d) of the BMSM Act). Contributions towards expenditure for the former would qualify for exclusion in the same way that (a)    inBell Property Trust([10]supra) the cost of repairs to and maintenance of the parts of the building not demised to the tenants were allowed; and (b)    inChartered Bank([9]supra) depreciation of the air-conditioning plant and ducting and the lift and fire extinguishers were allowed. 37     On the other hand, contributions towards expenditure for the latter (ie, additional facilities and improvements) would, in my view, not qualify for exclusion as they are, principally at least, for the benefit of the subsidiary proprietors. The burden of such capital outlay is properly that of the subsidiary proprietor (ie, the landlord) rather than the tenant. Except where such additional facilities and improvements were installed or effected promptly so that the tenant derived some benefit (which in any event would be small compared to what the subsidiary proprietor gained), the tenant would receive no consideration in respect of his contribution to such expenditure; the contribution would therefore be referable to the use and occupation of the tenanted property. It follows that his contribution towards such expenditure ought rightly to be included in the gross rental. 38     Even where the sinking fund is to be used for a purpose for which exclusion is permissible, thequantumof the contribution attributable to such purpose must be reasonable. I shall illustrate by reference toChartered Bank([9]supra). In that case, depreciation for the lift was allowed on the basis that its estimated useful life of 15 years was reasonable. Therefore, the cost of the lift was amortised over a 15-year period. If the landlord had sought depreciation on the basis of an unreasonably short useful life of, say, only five years thus resulting in a larger sum being claimed for depreciation each year, it would have been disallowed. 39     In summary, on principle, contributions to the sinking fund borne by the tenant may be excluded from the gross rental provided that, incharacterandquantum, they arebona fideunrelated to the elements of rent or letting,ie, that they are in return for something other than the use and occupation of the tenanted strata lot. It is for the Appellant to show to the reasonable satisfaction of the Chief Assessor which parts of the contribution to the sinking fund are intended for purposes for which exclusion is permissible on the basis I have outlined. 40     The same reasoning applies to the special levy. The collection of this levy over a period of three years, from July 2005 to June 2008, is for externalupgradingworks. Capital outlay for upgrading works enure to the benefit of the subsidiary proprietor and ought properly to be borne by the landlord rather than the tenant. Although the tenant bears the contribution to the special levy, he receives no consideration other than the use and occupation of the tenanted property. Even if such upgrading is completed during the term of the tenancy, the benefit the tenant derives therefrom would be insignificant compared to the lasting benefit gained by the landlord. As such, it is appropriate that the gross rental includes such contribution. In other words, no exclusion should be allowed. 41     For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs."
