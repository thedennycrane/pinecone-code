        "Issue 1: Sale of entire business or assets only": "5It is tempting for witnesses to angle their oral evidence in the most favourable light to suit their version of the case. But often the documentary evidence in a commercial case like the present offer a more reliable guide to the parties’ intentions. To this I shall now turn. 6It was not disputed that there was a lunch meeting on 18 June 2012 at Riverview Hotel, with Mr Teo, Mr Peh, Ms Ng Lei Kim (“Ms Ng”) and Mr Tan present.3Foot Note 3×Mr Teo’s AEIC at para 37; Ms Ng’s AEIC at para 22; Plaintiff’s 1st WS at para 47.A record of that meeting was captured in a letter dated 25 June 2012 drafted by Mr Teo and hand-delivered by Ms Ng to Mr Tan.4Foot Note 4×Mr Teo’s AEIC at para 45; Ms Ng’s AEIC at para 23; Plaintiff’s 1st WS at para 51.It was entitled, “LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING/AGREEMENT” (hereinafter, “25 June Letter”) and stated:5Foot Note 5×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 255. … To recapitulate and thereby set on records, the following items [1] to [5] had been duly accepted and agreed between Fu Loong Lithographer Pte Ltd [ Fu Loong ] and ISO Industry Pte Ltd [ISO]. The said agreement becomes operative with effect from 1/6/12. [1] Fu Loong had takenfull charge of the workers’ dormitory. All clients / rental income yield be transferred to Fu Loong. Cheque payment of rental income to be made payable to Fu Loong. Fu Loong will arrange to open bank account to facilitate deposit of cheques. … [4] Fu Loong will deal directly with ATI Architects Pte Ltd in conjunction to the renewal application for the continued of use of the premises as workers’ dormitory. … [6] ISO had substantiated in detail to Fu Loong thetotal investment cost. ISO had proposed to Fu Loong a“take over” costat the sum of S$150,000.00. In this connection, it will be well appreciated Fu Loong to confirm acceptance of the proposed sum … [emphasis added] 7The 25 June Letter clearly supported the Plaintiff’s case. The Defendant was taking over the entirety of the Plaintiff’s dormitory business. There was no need to “set on records” the other details of the dormitory business if the agreement was just about the sale of the assets only. Paragraph 6 of the 25 June Letter even mentioned the “total investment cost” before the proposal for the “take over” at $150,000 (although Mr Tan denied that the Plaintiff had substantiated the cost to the Defendant).6Foot Note 6×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 17, line 1.I found that this was clearly not a note for the sale and purchase of the assets only, or as an extension of the Defendant’s case, the sale of the Plaintiff’s entire business for only the price of the assets. 8There was another meeting between the same four persons on 13 August 2012 at the Riverview Hotel.7Foot Note 7×Mr Teo’s AEIC at para 48.The minutes of this meeting (“Minutes of 13 August Meeting”) recorded that:8Foot Note 8×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 256. [1] Mr Tan of Fu Loong has given full permission to ISO Industry Pte Ltd to appoint certified international valuer in order to obtain the valuation report for the purpose ofdetermining the value of the said workers’ dormitory. Mr Tan of Fu Loong - will pay the fee for the full valuation report - will accept the final valuation sum as assessed by the valuer as “Take Over” Fee due payable to ISO Industry Pte Ltd. At the material point of time, ISO Industry Pte Ltd has make known to Mr Tan of Fu Loong the “Take Over” Fee to be S$150,000.00 after factoring deprecation cost. ... [emphasis added] On its own, the minutes showed that it was clear as day that the parties’ agreement was for the “Take Over” of the entire “workers’ dormitory” business. 9The Defendant however latched on to the “FOLLOW-UP OF THE MINUTES PER MEETING OF AUGUST 13, 2012” (“Follow-up Minutes”)9Foot Note 9×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 257.wherein it was stated that the Plaintiff was tasked to appoint “certified international valuer to ascertain the value of thepre-existing fixtures and fitting of the workers’ dormitoryat 2 Kampong Ampat.”10Foot Note 10×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 257 at para 1.It will be recalled that Mr Tan had denied ever seeing or receiving these Follow-up Minutes, yet he chose to rely on them. Be that as it may, it was argued that the emphasised phrase showed that the agreement was for the Defendant to pay for the physical assets only.11Foot Note 11×Defendant’s 1st WS at paras 31 and 32. 10I found that the Follow-up Minutes should be understood in context together with the two preceding documents. The 25 June Letter12Foot Note 12×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 255.and Minutes of 13 August Meeting13Foot Note 13×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 256.had already made clear (see above) that the agreement was for the sale of the whole dormitory business (notwithstanding the absence of the words,14Foot Note 14×Defendant’s 1st WS at para 34.“sale of the business”). It was unfortunate that the Defendant had not given Mr Teo an opportunity during cross-examination to explain the specific mention of “pre-existing fixtures and fitting” (see Plaintiff’s argument at para 12 of Plaintiff’s 2nd WS). Giving the Defendant’s argument such weight as it deserved, I did not find it persuasive. The first point was that the valuation of the entire business must necessarily include the “pre-existing fixtures and fitting” as a component of the business. More pertinently, since the thrust of paras 1 and 2 of the Follow-up Minutes was to highlight the Plaintiff’s inability to find a valuer and that the ball was then in the Defendant’s court, it was understandable that the Plaintiff was highlighting the fact that the two “internationalvaluers” they (the Plaintiff) had approached were not in a position to value the physical assets. Paragraph 2 of the Follow-up Minutes concluded (again) with the “‘Take Over’ fee”, which was the common thread of all three documents and must mean the same thing. 11Once more, like the preceding two documents, the ventilation of the other matters connected with the dormitory business reinforced my view that the “‘Take Over’ fee” at para 2 of the Follow-Up Minutes was for the entire business and not the physical assets only. 12The Defendant submitted15Foot Note 15×Defendant’s 1st WS at para 34.that the documents16Foot Note 16×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, pp 255 to 257.do not “set out that there was a sale of the business” and that the words “take over” in inverted commas “may not accurately describe the situation”. I was of the considered view, after observing Mr Teo (who had drafted all three documents),17Foot Note 17×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, pp 255 to 257.that he was not using the inverted commas to indicate that the “take over” was not what it said. If anything, it was intended to emphasise the situation of the Defendant assuming full control of the dormitory and the sale of the entire business. 13In my judgment, the three documents18Foot Note 18×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, pp 255 to 257.were tolerably clear as a signpost of the parties’ intentions when examined against the factual matrix, including my findings with respect to the witnesses’ credibility. I evaluated the evidence of Mr Teo, Mr Peh and Ms Ng about the agreement at the 18 June 2012 lunch meeting and found that despite cross-examination, the gist of their evidence that the agreement was for the sale of the entire business “remained intact”: see para 48, and also para 47 of Plaintiff’s 1st WS. 14The bigger picture was that it did not make sense for a “certified international valuer” to be appointed if the agreement was, in Mr Tan’s words, “to buy over the asset such as the scrap metals”.19Foot Note 19×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 58, lines 1 to 7.It was amazing that para 47 of the Defendant’s 1st WS confirmed this fact by stating, “[t]he assets left behind by ISO and the entire dormitory were in very poor condition and could not be worth much.” I agreed with the Plaintiff’s submission20Foot Note 20×Plaintiff’s 1st WS at paras 55 and 56.that the valuation was intended for the entire dormitory business, which was why this issue featured in the documentation and Mr Tan was even prepared to bear the fees for the valuation.21Foot Note 21×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 54, line 25 and Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 256. 15Also, Mr Tan admitted that the figure of $150,000 had been mentioned at the meeting of 18 June 2012.22Foot Note 22×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 16, lines 18 to 21 and Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 255.I found that if Mr Tan had regarded the assets as no more than “scrap metals”,23Foot Note 23×Plaintiff’s 1st WS at para 56.he would have rejected the proposed amount of $150,000 outright. Yet this figure of $150,000 persisted throughout,24Foot Note 24×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 257 at para 2.indicating that the parties clearly intended that the sale was of the entire dormitory business but reserved the exact price pending valuation. 16On Mr Tan’s testimony, I found that he knew what was happening and what was involved in the deal. He was particularly evasive when the questions came near to whether he expected to get all the benefit of the contracts (with the existing 16 customers)25Foot Note 25×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 7, lines 15 to 17.and the dormitory business without paying anything for them.26Foot Note 26×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 6, line 12 to p 13, line 3.He took a long time to answer that he was getting the contracts for free because he knew that this would make his case untenable. 17Mr Tan was also careful to distance himself from the documentation. He did not reply to the 25 June Letter;27Foot Note 27×Plaintiff’s 1st WS at para 53.at first he denied receiving it.28Foot Note 28×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 13, lines 23 to 26; Plaintiff’s 1st WS at para 51.When he was asked whether he had “seen this document”, he replied, “I’ve forgotten;I’ve not seen this.”29Foot Note 29×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 13, line 24.It was only when he was confronted with his lawyer’s letter dated 18 June 2015 confirming that he had received the 25 June Letter that he confirmed that he had received the 25 June Letter.30Foot Note 30×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 14, line 7. 18Regarding the Minutes of 13 August Meeting, when asked whether he had received them,31Foot Note 31×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 17, lines 28 to 31.his answer was, “Well, I’m frequently not at home and my maid might have received this andI don’t know.”32Foot Note 32×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 17, line 30.He was still “not sure” whether he received the minutes.33Foot Note 33×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 17, line 32 to p 18, line 5. 19As for the Follow-up Minutes,34Foot Note 34×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 257.Mr Tan “did not see this document” and “had not received” it.35Foot Note 35×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 18, lines 10 to 17.And his reply to Ms Ng’s sending the two documents by registered post?36Foot Note 36×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, pp 260 and 261.He stated that he had two houses.37Foot Note 37×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 18, line 23.I found that Mr Tan obviously knew that the documents were damaging to his case. Hence he blatantly denied receipt or knowledge of the documents. 20I do not propose to deal with the Defendant’s arguments at paras 16 to 30; 39 to 49 of the Defendant’s 1st WS point by point. The arguments range over a wide field and at times did not distinguish between submissions based on evidence and hypothetical speculation based on the Defendant’s theory of the case. An example of such speculation was thequid pro quoargument at para 46 of the Defendant’s 1st WS: that the agreement was only for the sale of the assets because the Plaintiff wished to reciprocate the Defendant for the rent-free period from 2005 to 2007.38Foot Note 38×Plaintiff’s 2nd WS at para 18.  21I will analyse and answer the Defendant’s key arguments in this way. In the main, they fell into two categories: (a) The reasons for suggesting that the Defendant would not have bought the entire dormitory business; and (b) Why would the Plaintiff give away the dormitory business for free and charge only for the physical assets? 22As for the first category, the Defendant submitted that Mr Tan had plans to redevelop the entire building; he did not wish to renew the lease and he did not want the dormitory business.39Foot Note 39×Defendant’s 1st WS at paras 16 to 19.It is clearer to see the other arguments as falling under the second category. The Defendant had launched into a rationalisation of why it made sense that the agreement was for the Defendant to buy the assets only. 23The arguments in the first category ran up against a brick wall. The irrebuttable fact was that Mr Tan was persuaded and agreed to go into the dormitory business; he took over the Plaintiff’s business, collected rent from the existing tenants and was still running a profitable business. The short answer to the arguments in the second category was that the question for the court’s decision was what the parties had in fact intended and agreed to at the material time, and not what was possible, or rational, or even plausible by a process ofex post factorationalisation. Some of the matters argued by the Defendant were not even in the parties’ minds at the material time, or proved to be so. 24Paragraphs 20 to 30 of Defendant’s 1st WS aggregated the reasons under the second category and led to the neat reasoning process posited in para 27. But this was never the Defendant’s case, nor did they adduce the necessary evidence to prove this theory or that the Plaintiff’s representatives went through the reasoning process in para 27. It is sufficient for me to evaluate and answer two key planks in the Defendant’s case, the reasoning of which will also deal with the other more minute arguments. The Defendant made much of (i) the reinstatement costs and (ii) the renewal of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) licence to operate the dormitory. Taking the Defendant’s case at the highest, and assuming that the Plaintiff recognised these and other factors as their weaknesses, I found on the evidence that they did not lead to two broad conclusions which were critical  to the Defendant’s case. 25First, it did not mean that the Plaintiff’s bargaining position was so badly undercut that they could get no value for the business, or that the business was worthless. Even Mr Tan felt this way because he entertained the $150,000 proposal while awaiting the valuation, and gave the Plaintiff a management contract worth $8,000 per month. That also explained Mr Tan’s palpable evasiveness about getting the existing rental contracts free.40Foot Note 40×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 6, line 12 to p 13, line 3. 26Second, from my assessment of the witnesses, Mr Teo and Mr Peh were commercial men obviously guarding their commercial interests. As hardnosed businessmen, they would of course want to avoid the disadvantages (for example, they would wish to save the reinstatement costs), but that did not mean that they were not trying to get the best deal in the circumstances, by whatever means possible. It was just ridiculous to suggest that they would let the more valuable parts (the goodwill, the contracts and other constituent elements) of the business go for free. In short, the Defendant’s case fell flat because the Plaintiff was neitherunablenorunwillingto negotiate hard to secure the best agreement in their interests. 27To be fair to the Defendant, I had considered all their submissions (even when they were clearly counsel’s rationalisation) from the perspective of showing that it was more probable that the parties’ agreement was for the sale of the assets only. But in the end I was not persuaded at all.",
        "Issue 2: Double rent": "28The Defendant’s claim for double rent was specifically pleaded in paras 15 and 16 of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 3) (“Defence and Counterclaim”).41Foot Note 41×Setting Down Bundle, p 23.Reliance was placed on cl 2(27) of the 2009 Tenancy Agreement signed on 13 May 2009,42Foot Note 42×Defendant’s 1st WS at paras 5 and 6, see original agreement in Defendant’s Bundle of Documents, pp 53 to 54.which read: If the Tenant continues to occupy the Demised Premises beyond the expiration or determination of the Term or fails to deliver vacant possession thereof to the Landlord after the expiration or determination of the Term,with the Landlord’s acquiescence but without any express agreementbetween the Landlord and Tenant, the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord for every month or part thereof such holding overdoublethe amount of the Rent and such holding over shall not constitute a rental of this Tenancy Agreement by operation of law or pursuant to the provisions of this Tenancy Agreement. During the period of any such holding over all other provisions of this Tenancy Agreement shall be and remain in effect. The provisions herein shall not be construed as the Landlord’s consent for the Tenant to hold over after the expiration or determination of the Term. [emphasis in original] 29The Defendant had argued extensively on this issue43Foot Note 43×See Defendant’s 1st WS at paras 50 to 71; Defendant’s 2nd WS at paras 18 to 20; and Defendant’s 3rd WS.but many of the arguments fell away or were rejected by the court’s finding of fact that at the expiry of the 2009 Tenancy Agreement, the parties had expressly agreed to a monthly tenancy at the same monthly rent of $22,000 (as the 2009 Tenancy Agreement). The claim for double rent was therefore misconceived; and para 15 of the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No. 3) (“Reply and Defence to Counterclaim”)44Foot Note 44×Setting Down Bundle, p 44.succeeded in this regard. 30I shall now explain why I reached that determination. 31To start off, it was telling that there was no formalwrittennotice to the Plaintiff to vacate the premises, whether before or after the expiry of the 2009 Tenancy Agreement.45Foot Note 45×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 26, lines 10 to 12 and lines 18 to 21; Plaintiff’s 1st WS at para 66.1.Mr Tan alleged that he hadorallyasked Mr Peh and Mr Teo to vacate and reminded them about the clause on double rent.46Foot Note 46×Mr Tan’s AEIC at paras 10 to 11.I was of the view that Mr Tan’s evidence on this issue was clearly an afterthought. Even his own Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief hinted at the truth (at para 10): … Instead they took me out to dinner and invited me to social events and to karaoke sessions with them. At that time our relationship was very good and because of their friendliness and outwardly generous gestures, I felt obliged to them and did not give them formal notice to vacate the Premises. … 32I did not believe that the rosy relationship between the parties was something that would have prevented Mr Tan from enforcing his rights. If he had this issue in mind, and had even orally reminded the Plaintiff to vacate on pain of paying double rent, the situation would not have persisted for so long. 33I found that the real situation was that Mr Tan did not intend to take back possession at the expiry of the 2009 Tenancy Agreement and had agreed to allow the Plaintiff to remain as a tenant at the same rent until he reached a firm decision as to what to do with the premises. I have seen Mr Tan give evidence. He is not a man toacquiescein silence. When he thought that the Plaintiff did not manage the dormitory business properly, he terminated their services “immediately”47Foot Note 47×Defence and Counterclaim at para 18; para 36 of Mr Tan’s AEIC.(without formal notice of termination),48Foot Note 48×Mr Teo’s AEIC at para 57; Mr Peh’s AEIC at para 41; Plaintiff’s 1st WS at para 66.4.and withheld the management fees for September 2012.49Foot Note 49×Mr Tan’s AEIC at para 36. The management fee for September 2012 was subsequently resolved: see Order of Court dated 28 October 2015 at para 5.2.Further, I agreed with the Plaintiff that Mr Tan portrayed himself as still agitated by the double rent issue during his testimony.50Foot Note 50×Plaintiff’s 1st WS at para 66.6.If this was the case, it was incredible that he allowed thestatus quoto continue between March 2011 and May 2012 and did nothing to claim double rent until proceedings started. I could not therefore believe that the Plaintiff was in possession for a period of 15 months without his express agreement. To try to characterise Mr Tan’s behaviour as mere “acquiescence” is to engage in semantics. 34On top of that, the Defendant accepted rent at $22,000 per month,unconditionallyandwithoutany reservationof their rights. This wasfor theentire 15-month periodbefore the Plaintiff handed over possession when the Defendant took over the dormitory business pursuant to their agreement. The rent was either paid into the Defendant’s account or collected by Mr Tan personally on two occasions.51Foot Note 51×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, pp 178 and 182; para 15 of Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (at p 44 of Setting Down Bundle).Mr Tan even had lunch with the Plaintiff’s representatives after collecting the cheques.52Foot Note 52×Notes of Evidence dated 27 July 2015 p 19, lines 30 to 31 and p 74, lines 9 to 10; Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 58, lines 29 to 31. 35I agreed with the Plaintiff’s submission53Foot Note 53×Para 66.5 of Plaintiff’s 1st WS.that during the 15-month period, the parties’ conduct was consistent with the existence of an agreement for a periodic tenancy. The Defendant was reimbursed for the sub-let fee collected by the Housing and Development Board54Foot Note 54×See for example, Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, pp 171-173.and the application for renewal of the URA permission to continue to operate the workers’ dormitory was done with Mr Tan’s “blessing”.55Foot Note 55×Notes of Evidence dated 27 July 2015 p 19, lines 1 to 8.Thestatus quohad persisted. If Mr Tan had any misgivings about the Plaintiff’s continued possession, he would have sought legal advice to enforce his rights. But he was perfectly happy with the situation, which in accordance with my finding and the law, had given rise to a monthly tenancy. 36Beyond the 15-month period, Mr Tan did not mention the double rent issue after taking over the dormitory business in June 2012, andeven afterhe sacked the Plaintiff as managing agent. I was driven to the inevitable conclusion that Mr Tan (despite his protestations to the contrary) never intended to claim double rent. 37On cl 2(27) of the 2009 Tenancy Agreement, the Defendant submitted valiantly on the distinction between “acquiescence” and “express agreement”. I can understand that there is an appreciable difference but on our facts, the conduct of the parties, like that inKhng Thian Huat and another v Riduan bin Yusof and another[2005] 1 SLR(R) 130, had unequivocally “acknowledged and accepted the existence of” (at [8]) the monthly tenancy. In finding that there was express agreement for the tenancy, I categorically rejected the proposition that the agreement must be in writing.56Foot Note 56×Defendant’s 1st WS at para 60. 38Given my finding that at the expiry of the 2009 Tenancy Agreement, a new periodic tenancy had been created,ie,a monthly tenancy with rent at $22,000 per month, it was not necessary to consider the issue of promissory estoppel,ie,that the Defendant was estopped from relying on cl 2(27) of the 2009 Tenancy Agreement.",
        "Miscellaneous issues": "39The remaining issues which arose from the Defendant’s counterclaims related to the Plaintiff’s management of the dormitory business for the Defendant. This was for a short period from 1 June 2012 to September 2012 when the Plaintiff’s services were terminated by the Defendant.57Foot Note 57×Mr Teo’s AEIC at paras 56 to 57; Mr Tan’s AEIC at para 36.Before dealing with the specific complaints in respect of specific entities (indicated inthe abbreviated form in the headings), it bears reminding that the terms of the management contract were contained in a letter dated 24 May 2012.58Foot Note 58×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 254; Plaintiff’s 1st WS at para 96.The Plaintiff promised to carry out the following services:59Foot Note 59×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 254. 1. Issuing of sales invoices. 2. Preparing of payment vouchers to creditors (All cheque payments to creditors will be issue by Fu Loong Lithographer Pte Ltd) 3. Keeping records of receipts and payments … 40As such, while the core functions (like the Plaintiff was bound to collect the rent from the workers and pay them over to the Defendant) could be sensibly implied, it was not for the court to write all the terms of the management contract for the parties.",
        "New Tokyo": "41The Defendant claimed that: (a)  “in breach of the Plaintiff’s duties as manager, the Plaintiff had, without the Defendant’s consent, charged New Tokyo $155 per bed instead of the usual rate of $240 per bed”;60Foot Note 60×Para 19 of Defence and Counterclaim, found at p 25 of Setting Down Bundle.and (b) “[t]he Plaintiff had also undercharged New Tokyo for the number of beds taken up by them.”61Foot Note 61×Para 19 of Defence and Counterclaim, found at p 25 of Setting Down Bundle.This claim was not pursued further.62Foot Note 62×Para 34 of Defendant’s 2nd WS. 42The Defendant’s claim herein can be answered briefly. To begin, it was not proved that the Plaintiff had any motive to benefit New Tokyo by giving them a discounted rate. Further, it was not challenged that Mr Teo had not been instructed by Mr Tan to increase the bed rate from what was previously charged ($155)63Foot Note 63×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 308; Plaintiff’s 1st WS at para 102.to $240 (which was the bed rate for the other workers).64Foot Note 64×Notes of Evidence dated 27 July 2015 p 48, line 12; para 97 of Plaintiff’s 1st WS.It could not be assumed or implied that the Plaintiff was bound to check with Mr Tan and review every aspect of the business. If anything the converse was the position: the previous practice would prevail until changed by Mr Tan.  Also, there were no terms in the management contract that imposed this obligation of checking and reviewing on the Plaintiff. The Defendant had also not pleaded, or proven, any implied term or fiduciary duty to this effect.65Foot Note 65×Paras 18 and 19 of Defence and Counterclaim (Setting Down Bundle, pp 24 to 25). 43Finally, I also noted that the sum of $23,123 paid over to the Defendant corresponded with the invoices issued to New Tokyo for the relevant months.66Foot Note 66×Defendant’s Bundle of Documents, pp 150 and 174; see also para 20.1 of Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Setting Down Bundle, p 46).The Defendant simply failed to prove the loss.",
        "Doka": "44The Defendant’s case was that the Plaintiff failed to invoice Doka for the rental of the dormitory.67Foot Note 67×Para 19 of Defence and Counterclaim (p 25 of Setting Down Bundle); para 116 of Plaintiff’s 1st WS.To be sure, the Defendant’s case should have been specifically pleaded as being for a net amount of $5,025, which the Defendant said the Plaintiff owed them by not collecting the same amount as rent from Doka. This final amount was derived from the Plaintiff’s records68Foot Note 68×Defendant’s Bundle of Documents, p 105.and covered the rent payable by Doka for the period June 2012to November 2012.69Foot Note 69×Mr Tan’s AEIC at para 59; para 117 of Plaintiff’s 1st WS. 45I had no doubt dismissing this claim because Ms Ng had convincingly answered that Doka had at the same time “provided regular maintenance work and daily cleaning services”70Foot Note 70×Para 46 of Ms Ng’s AEIC.and after setting off Doka’s invoices (for such services) to the Defendant (for September 2012 and October 2012)71Foot Note 71×Defendant’s Bundle of Documents, pp 200 and 203. See 2nd column of Defendant’s Bundle of Documents, p 105.against the rent payable by Doka, the Defendant owed Doka $975.72Foot Note 72×Paras 46 and 47 of Ms Ng’s AEIC and p 268 of Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents. 46The Defendant then took issue with the work done by Doka, Mr Tan complaining that, “I do not know what works were done or whether any work was even done”.73Foot Note 73×Para 44 of Mr Tan’s AEIC; and also para 120 of Plaintiff’s 1st WS.By the time of the written final submissions, the Defendant’s complaint had evolved to there being no sub-contract between the Plaintiff and Doka.74Foot Note 74×Para 89 of Defendant’s 1st WS. 47I found the Defendant’s case to be disingenuous and rejected it. Agreeing with the Plaintiff’s submissions at para 120 of the Plaintiff’s 1st WS, and adopting the language of the arguments, my reasons were: (a) Mr Tan’s answers during cross-examination75Foot Note 75×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 pp 37 to 42.and the documentary evidence76Foot Note 76×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, pp 203 to 204.showed that he had approved and paid Doka for its invoice for August 2012 whose description of work was identical to that in the September and  October 2012 invoices; (b) Mr Tan had signed a letter dated 16 November 2012 on the Defendant’s behalf addressed to Doka where he informed Doka that its workers had “failed to perform their duties (clean the premises and do the laundry)”;77Foot Note 77×Plaintiff’s Supplementary Bundle of Documents, p 278.and (c) Mr Charles’ testimony78Foot Note 78×Notes of Evidence dated 28 July 2015 p 66, lines 6 to 20.under cross-examination that he had drafted the said letter of 16 November 2012 and that Doka’s workers, prior to 16 November 2012 and since October 2012, had provided cleaning and laundry services at the dormitory. 48To make a parting point: as the managing agent with the responsibility of preparing payment vouchers to creditors,79Foot Note 79×See Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, p 254.the Plaintiff was entitled – on the Defendant’s pleaded case – to rely on Doka’s invoices to the Defendant80Foot Note 80×Defendant’s Bundle of Documents, pp 200 and 203.and set off those amounts against the rent payable. Otherwise, the Plaintiff would be put in the invidious position of running a defence for Doka, and justifying Doka’s work.",
        "Chin Ping": "49The Defendant’s counterclaim here was that the Plaintiff failed to invoice or hand over monies collected from Chin Ping.81Foot Note 81×Para 19A of Defence and Counterclaim (p 25 of Setting Down Bundle).Essentially, the Defendant relied on the Plaintiff’s “out Records” (Defendant’s Bundle of Documents pp 91 and 92) which showed that six of Chin Ping’s workers had been staying at the dormitory between 1 June 2012 and August 2012.82Foot Note 82×Para 95 of Defendant’s 1st WS.The total amount claimed under this head was $4,103.22. 50I accepted the Plaintiff’s case that the invoices were issued to and handled by Chin Kiat Construction Pte Ltd (“Chin Kiat”) for Chin Ping (Paragraph 20A of Reply and Defence to Counterclaim).83Foot Note 83×Found at pp 46 to 47 of Setting Down Bundle; para 75 of Plaintiff’s 2nd WS.The Plaintiff showed that Chin Kiat (tenant) and Chin Ping (non-tenant) shared the same address and had related owners (Tan Buck Yong and Tan Buck Hong).84Foot Note 84×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents, pp 285 to 288 and pp 306 to 307.Mr Teo explained that the practice was for one company to sign the tenancy agreement with the Plaintiff and the workers from their affiliated company will come under the same agreement, and be paid for by the first company.85Foot Note 85×Notes of Evidence dated 27 July 2015 p 44, lines 11 to 32 and para 66 of Mr Teo’s AEIC.Further, Mr Teo explained in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief that the “out Records” showed the workers’ company asreflected in his work permit, and not the company that signed the tenancy agreement.86Foot Note 86×Para 66 of Mr Teo’s AEIC. 51I found that the Defendant failed to prove their case in respect of the six workers under Chin Ping.",
        "LV Automation": "52The counterclaim in respect of LV Automation boiled down to a claim for $596.13 for one worker who stayed in the dormitory from June 2012 to 15 August 2012.87Foot Note 87×Defendant’s 1st WS at para 101; Defence and Counterclaim at para 19A.The Defendant’s 2nd WS at para 31 made it clear that they were relying on the Plaintiff’s “out Records” as well. But there was a clear notation of “Gower” against the worker’s name.88Foot Note 88×Defendant’s Bundle of Documents, p 91.I accepted the Plaintiff’s case (including the relationship between Gower Pte Ltd (“Gower”) and LV Automation)89Foot Note 89×Para 134 of Plaintiff’s 1st WS.that the worker’s rent was paid under Gower’s account. The Defendant failed to show that the worker’s rent was not paid to them.",
        "Conclusion": "53In summary, my decision was as follows (the details were in the Order of Court dated 28 October 2015): (a) I allowed the Plaintiff’s main claim and found that the agreement between the parties was for the sale of the Plaintiff’s entire dormitory business to the Defendant, with the value of the business to be separately assessed. (b)  I dismissed the Defendant’s counterclaims concerning double rent, New Tokyo, Doka, Chin Ping and LV Automation.
