        "1. The Claims and Defences": "6. The 1stPlaintiffs' claim is against both defendants for\n\ninfringement of copyright. The 1stPlaintiffs claim that they are the owners of\n\nthe copyright in certain documents containing drawings and notes in relation to the\n\nPlaintiffs' machine. They say that these documents contain original literary and artistic\n\nworks. They claim that both defendants, by copying such works on paper and by\n\nmanufacturing the Defendants' machine, had reproduced those original works in\n\ntwo-dimensions and three-dimensions.7. In their joint Amended Defence, the defendants put the plaintiffs to\n\nstrict proof of their claim to copyright in the works. The 1stDefendant denied\n\ncopying the Plaintiffs' machine or any of the plaintiffs' works. The defendants also\n\ndenied that the Defendants' machine was a reproduction of such works. In the alternative,\n\nthey also rely on the provision in section 69 of the Copyright Act (\"the Act\").8. The 2ndPlaintiffs' claim is against the 1stDefendant. The first part of their claim is for breach of an express term in his contract\n\nof employment prohibiting the 1stDefendant from revealing any trade secrets\n\nand confidential information. The second part of the claim is for breach of an implied\n\nterm in the contract of employment, viz. that he owed a duty of good faith and fidelity to\n\nthe 2ndPlaintiffs. Both these claims relate to the disclosure by the 1stDefendant to the 2ndDefendants of the following information:(i) the 1stPlaintiffs' literary and artistic works the\n\n  subject matter of their claim in copyright;(ii) the names and addresses of the 2ndPlaintiffs'\n\n  customers;(iii) the usual requirements of the 2ndPlaintiffs'\n\n  customers both as to quantity and quality;(iv) the prices charged to individual customers of the 2ndPlaintiffs.9. The 1stDefendant denied disclosing the 1stPlaintiffs' works to the 2ndDefendants. He denied ever having possession of\n\nthem. As for the information relating to the 2ndPlaintiffs' customers, viz.\n\ntheir names and addresses and their usual requirements, the 1stDefendant\n\ndenied ever receiving or having access to such information in the course of his\n\nemployment. The 1stDefendant also denied using the information on prices.",
        "2. Claim in Copyright": "10. In order to succeed in the claim in copyright, the 1stPlaintiffs have to establish that:(i) copyright subsists in Singapore in the artistic or literary works\n\n  concerned and is owned by the 1stPlaintiffs; and(ii) the defendants have infringed their copyright.I shall examine in turn each of these issues, which spawn further\n\nsub-issues, in respect of each document the literary or artistic content of which the 1stPlaintiffs claim copyright over. Although failure by the plaintiffs to prove any single\n\nsub-issue would mean that the claim fails in respect of that document, I would, both for\n\ncompleteness and in case I am wrong on that sub-issue, make findings on every sub-issue\n\nfor every document. As there are 15 separate documents and 4 sub-issues, I have summarised\n\nmy findings in a Table of Findings at the end of this part of the judgment.",
        "2.1 Subsistence and ownership of copyright": "11. Section 27 of the Act sets out the conditions under which copyright\n\nmay subsist in Singapore in an original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work.\n\nSection 30 deals with ownership of copyright in such works. In the present action, the\n\nliterary and artistic works concerned are claimed to be created in Australia. Section 184\n\nof the Act provides for the application of the Act to other countries. To this end, the\n\nCopyright (International Protection) Regulations were promulgated on 10 April 1987. The\n\nrelevant parts of regulation 3 are paragraphs (3) and (4), which provide as follows:(3) Subject to these Regulations, the provisions of the Act relating to\n\n  works and other subject-matter shall apply in relation to persons who, at a material time,\n\n  are citizens or nationals of a country specified in the Schedule in like manner as those\n\n  provisions shall apply in relation to persons who, at a material time, are citizens of\n\n  Singapore.(4) Subject to these Regulations, the provisions of the Act relating to\n\n  works and other subject-matter shall apply in relation to persons who, at a material time,\n\n  are resident in a country that constitutes, or forms part of, the territory of a country\n\n  specified in the Schedule in like manner as those provisions shall apply in relation to\n\n  persons who, at a material time, are resident in Singapore.Australia is one of the countries specified in the Schedule.\n\nAccordingly, regulation 3(3) and 3(4) make the provisions in the Act relating to works\n\napplicable in respect of persons who are citizens, nationals or residents of Australia in\n\nlike manner as those provisions apply in relation to persons who are citizens or residents\n\nof Singapore.12. Section 27 deals with two types of works, viz. unpublished works in\n\nsub-section (1), and published works in sub-section (2). Section 24 deems a literary or\n\nartistic work to be published if, but only if, reproductions of the work or an edition of\n\nit have been supplied, whether by sale or otherwise, to the public. The plaintiffs do not\n\nallege that this has been done; therefore the works concerned are unpublished works and\n\nfall to be considered under section 27(1). That provision, and section 27(4), state as\n\nfollows:27. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, copyright shall subsist\n\n  in an original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work that is unpublished and of\n\n  which the author -(a) was a qualified person at the time when the work was made; or(b) if the making of the work extended over a period - was a qualified\n\n    person for a substantial part of that period.â€¦(4) In this section, \"qualified person\" means a citizen of\n\n  Singapore or a person resident in Singapore.Applying regulation 3, the copyright in the works would subsist in the\n\nauthors of such works if they were Australian citizens, nationals or residents \"at a\n\nmaterial time\". The term \"at a material time\" is defined in regulation 2(1)\n\nas the time when the work in question was made, or over a substantial part of the period\n\nover which it was made.13. The plaintiffs claim that the authors of the works were employees\n\nof the 1stPlaintiffs at the time and they created the works concerned pursuant\n\nto their terms of employment. Section 30(6) provides that in such a situation, the\n\nemployer shall be entitled to any copyright subsisting by virtue of Part III of the Act.14. Therefore, the questions to be determined under this head are as\n\nfollows:(a) the identity of the authors of the literary or artistic works;(b) whether the authors were citizens or residents of Singapore or\n\n  Australia when the works were created; and(c) whether the authors were employees of the 1stPlaintiffs\n\n  at the time and had created the works pursuant to the terms of their employment.15. Before proceeding to the first question, I set out below the\n\ndocuments containing the artistic and literary works over which copyright is claimed by\n\nthe 1stPlaintiffs. They had exhibited various documents at the outset but\n\neventually narrowed their copyright claim to the works contained in the following\n\ndocuments:(i) ABD81-82, which contain specifications for the material and\n\n  dimensions of the bellows.(ii) ABD83, which is a table of bellows ring sizes. Bellows rings are\n\n  steel rings used in the bellows forming process and are an element in the Plaintiffs'\n\n  machine.(iii) ABD84, which is a set of instructions on the preliminary set-up\n\n  of the Plaintiffs' machine.(iv) ABD85-88, which is a set of operating instructions for the\n\n  Plaintiffs' machine.(v) ABD89, which is a schematic drawing of the Plaintiffs' machine.(vi) ABD90, which is another schematic drawing of the Plaintiffs'\n\n  machine but which is supposed to show it in the course of performing a\n\n  \"re-rolling\" function.(vii) ABD91, which is a simple line drawing of the cross-section of a\n\n  single \"upper wheel\", twin \"lower wheels\" and half of a tube with a\n\n  convolution. The purpose of this drawing is apparently to show the alignment of the wheels\n\n  in relation to the previous convolution in order to form the next one.(viii) ABD92, which is also a simple line drawing showing the\n\n  measurement of convolution height using an adjustable square.(ix) ABD93, which is a simple line drawing of an element of the\n\n  Plaintiffs' machine.(x) ABD94, which is a detailed drawing of an element of the Plaintiffs'\n\n  machine called the \"cylinder support arm\".(xi) ABD95, which is a detailed drawing of the cross-section of an\n\n  element of the Plaintiffs' machine called the \"top wheel\", with a part view of\n\n  that element showing locations of a series of holes on the wheel.(xii) ABD96, which is a detailed drawing of the cross-section of an\n\n  element of the Plaintiffs' machine called the \"wheel assembly\" comprising the\n\n  top wheel and twin bottom wheels.(xiii) PSBD8, which is the perspective view of an element of the\n\n  Plaintiffs' machine called the \"pivot plate\".(xiv) PSBD11, which is a detailed drawing of an element of the\n\n  Plaintiffs' machine, a shaft holding up the steel bellows rings, along with a\n\n  cross-section of such rings.(xv) PSBD13, which is a detailed drawing of an element of the\n\n  Plaintiffs' machine, the twin lower wheels, showing the manner in which those wheels are\n\n  held in position and connected to a hydraulic jack.2.1.1 Authors16. I now turn to consider the evidence on authorship. Counsel for the\n\ndefendants, Mr Lee, made certain concessions. In respect of ABD81-82, he conceded in his\n\nwritten submission that the author was one Ken Holzapfel (\"Holzapfel\"). As for\n\nABD83, Mr Lee doubted that the identity of the author had been established, but did not\n\npursue the point as he submitted that nothing turned on the document. I took this to mean\n\nthat he did not dispute the plaintiffs' evidence of authorship of this document. Later, in\n\nthe course of his oral submissions, Mr Lee said that he was prepared to concede that the 1stPlaintiffs owned the copyright to ABD81-82 and ABD83 because he was of the view that these\n\ndocuments did not affect his case. In relation to ABD94, Mr Lee said in his written\n\nsubmission that he was prepared to concede that the 1stPlaintiffs enjoyed\n\ncopyright \"as this drawing is not relevant to their case.\" In view of these\n\nconcessions, I find that copyright subsists in the literary and artistic works in\n\nABD81-82, ABD83 and ABD94 and that the 1stPlaintiffs owns such copyright.17. I now turn to the contested documents. In relation to ABD81-96, the\n\nonly evidence of authorship is paragraph 6 of Robinson's affidavit evidence-in-chief which\n\nstates as follows:The 1stPlaintiffs' work was created in Australia sometime\n\n  on or about 9thApril 1991 and was completed in Singapore on 30thJuly 1993. The 3 authors of the work were Mr. Ray Lind, Mr. Ken Holzapfel and myself, all\n\n  employees of the 1stPlaintiffs at that time. By virtue of the copyright laws\n\n  of Australia, the copyright in the 1stPlaintiffs' work belongs to the 1stPlaintiffs. A copy of the Plaintiffs' work comprising the drawing, specifications,\n\n  operating instructions and standard bellows dimension are collectively annexed hereto as\n\n  exhibit 'IRR-3'.Exhibit 'IRR-3' comprises the documents ABD81-96 (and two other\n\ndocuments which the plaintiffs did not proceed on). It is not clear from this paragraph\n\nalone whether it is alleged (i) that the 3 persons were joint authors of all the documents\n\nin ABD81-96; or (ii) that one or more of them was involved in each of the documents. An\n\ninspection of some of the documents would support the second interpretation. For instance,\n\nABD83 appears to be a memorandum from the Manufacturing Branch of the Energy Engineering\n\nDivision addressed to Holzapfel. The logical inference would be that Holzapfel could not\n\nbe a joint author of this document. And ABD81-82 appear to be produced by Holzapfel\n\nbecause they have his initials on them. Finally, ABD95 is prima facie Lind's because his\n\nname is recorded in the title block as the person who drew it. From this, and from the\n\nevidence that Robinson gave in cross-examination which I will set out below, I conclude\n\nthat the second interpretation is the correct one.18. In cross-examination, Robinson said that he was the author of\n\nABD94. As for the rest, although he had stated in his affidavit that ABD81-96 were\n\nauthored by the 3 of them, when asked in cross-examination who prepared ABD 84, he said\n\nthat he presumed it was Holzapfel. When questioned on ABD85-88, he said that he believed\n\nit was Holzapfel, but he was not sure. In relation to ABD 95-96, Robinson said that these\n\nwere drawn by Lind, whose name is recorded in the title blocks as the person who drew them\n\non 4 September 1991. Robinson said that Lind was an employee of the 1stPlaintiffs at the time. In view of Robinson's answers in cross-examination, I find that\n\nthe plaintiffs have not proved the authorship of ABD 84 and ABD85-88. However I find that\n\nthey have proved that Lind was the author of ABD95 and ABD96.19. The evidence in respect of ABD89-93 is less straightforward. On the\n\none hand, Robinson had made the blanket statement in paragraph 6 of his affidavit that\n\nthese were created by the 3 of them, i.e. himself, Holzapfel and Lind. As I had reasoned\n\nabove, I interpret this to mean that one or more of them authored each of the documents.\n\nUnfortunately Mr Lee did not attempt to clarify the exact nature of the authorship of\n\nthese particular documents in cross-examination. Since this must be taken to be acceptance\n\nof Robinson's evidence on these particular documents, I find that the plaintiffs have\n\nproved that each of the documents in ABD89-93 was authored by either Robinson, Holzapfel\n\nor Lind, or any combination of them jointly.20. There are 3 further documents, viz. PSBD8, PSBD11 and PSBD13. When\n\nasked whether there was any evidence of their authorship, counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr\n\nSivakuamar, referred to paragraphs 22 to 25 of Robinson's supplementary affidavit. But\n\nafter it was pointed out to him that those paragraphs did not contain any such evidence,\n\nMr Sivakumar conceded that there was prima facie no evidence of the authors of PSBD8 and\n\nPSBD11. As the burden of proof in this respect rests on the plaintiffs, I find that the\n\nauthorship of PSBD8 and PSBD11 have not been proved.21. In relation to PSBD13, Mr Sivakumar pointed out that although there\n\nwas no oral evidence of authorship, Lind's signature appears on it along with the date, 14\n\nOctober 1991. Presumably he is relying on the presumption in section 131(1) of the Act\n\nwhich provides as follows:Where a name purporting to be that of the author of a literary,\n\n  dramatic, musical or artistic work appeared on copies of the work as published or a name\n\n  purporting to be that of the author of an artistic work appeared on the work when it was\n\n  made,the person whose name so appeared, if it was his true name or a name by which\n\n  he was commonly known,shall, in an action brought by virtue of this Part,be\n\n  presumed, unless the contrary is established,to be the author of the work and to\n\n  have made the work in circumstances to which section 30 (4), (5) and (6) does not apply.As PBSD13 is an unpublished artistic work, the criterion is whether the\n\n\"name purporting to be that of the author of an artistic work appeared on the work\n\nwhen it was made\". The signature on PSBD13 does not appear in a formal title block in\n\na box headed by the words \"Drawn by\". It appears at the bottom right corner of\n\nthe document encircled in a wavy line under the words \"BOTTOM FORMING ASSEMBLY\"\n\nwith a date. There is the question whether the name appeared on PSBD13 when it was made.\n\nThere is no evidence that this was the case. Therefore the presumption cannot be invoked.22. Even if the presumption can be invoked, there is the question as to\n\nits scope. The words in section 131(1) underlined above provide for a two-fold\n\npresumption, i.e. (i) the person named is presumed to be the author of the work; and (ii)\n\nhe made the work in circumstances in which section 30 (4), (5) and (6) do not apply.\n\nSection 30(6) provides that where a literary, dramatic or artistic work (to which section\n\n30(4) and (5) do not apply) is made by the author in pursuance to the terms of his\n\nemployment, his employer shall be entitled to any copyright subsisting under Part III of\n\nthe Act. This is the provision on which the 1stPlaintiffs rely in their claim\n\nof ownership of the copyright in PSBD13. The presumption of authorship in section 131(1)\n\nis invoked only along with the presumption that the author did not create the work\n\npursuant to the terms of his employment. It would follow that this presumption of\n\nownership is not available where the author's employer is the person who is bringing the\n\naction as copyright owner.23. I next consider whether, even without the benefit of the\n\npresumption, there is evidence that Lind is the author of PSBD13. As stated above, if his\n\nname appeared in a title box headed \"drawn by\", I might infer that he is the\n\nauthor because there is such an assertion on the face of the document. However in the\n\npresent circumstance, there can be a number of reasons why his signature appears other\n\nthan because he was the maker. Furthermore, this document was not in the agreed bundle.\n\nThis means that the defendants have not made an admission as to its authenticity.\n\nTherefore it was for the plaintiffs to prove it by calling the maker or some person who\n\ncan attest to the fact that Lind made it. I should think that, at the very least, there\n\nmust be a positive statement from someone that Lind was the maker instead of relying on\n\nthe fact that his signature appears on the document. That is a simple assertion and the\n\nfact that it cannot be made could mean that the truth is something else. While there can\n\nbe a wholly innocent explanation for this omission, it would be unfair to the defendants\n\nto hold as proved a fact that none of the plaintiffs' witnesses have asserted. Therefore I\n\nfind that the plaintiffs have not proved the authorship of PSBD13.2.1.2 Citizenship or residency24. Beyond proving the identity of the authors, the plaintiffs must\n\nalso prove that they were citizens of or resident in Australia at the time the documents\n\nwere made, or possessed that status for a substantial part of any period over which the\n\nworks were created: see section 27(1) and 27(4) of the Act, read with regulation 3(3) and\n\n3(4).25. Some of the documents are dated and others are not. ABD81-82 are\n\ndated November 1991. ABD83 is dated 31 May 1982. ABD84-93 are not dated. However Robinson\n\nhad stated in paragraph 6 of his affidavit that these were made between 9 April 1991 and\n\n30 July 1993 and I accept that evidence. ABD94 is dated 16 March 1993. ABD95 and ABD96 are\n\nboth dated 4 September 1991. I accept these to be the dates of creation of those documents\n\nand find accordingly. PSBD8 and PSBD11 have no date and there is no evidence of when they\n\nwere made. The date \"4 September 1991\" appears on PSBD13. But as there is no\n\nevidence that this is the date of creation, I find that there is no evidence of that date.26. Where there is a date specified in respect of a particular document\n\n(as opposed to the period April 1991 to July 1993), the plaintiffs should give evidence as\n\nto whether the document was created on that date or over a particular period. They have\n\nnot done so, but I am prepared to hold that the documents concerned were made on the dates\n\nspecified because the nature of the documents do not suggest that any of them would\n\nrequire more than a day to be made. However for the documents for which the plaintiffs\n\ncould only say that they were made between April and July 1993, I can only hold that they\n\nwere created over that period.27. Next the plaintiffs have to show that the authors were citizens of\n\nor resident in Australia on those dates or over a substantial part of that period. There\n\nis no direct evidence of the citizenship or residency status of the 3 authors, namely\n\nRobinson, Holzapfel and Lind. I have carefully perused the affidavits of the plaintiffs'\n\nwitnesses and their answers in cross-examination and am unable to find any such evidence.\n\nMr Lee had studiously avoided asking such questions in his cross-examination, as was his\n\nright so to do. Mr Sivakumar concedes that there is no direct evidence but submits that\n\nthere is circumstantial evidence of their residency status. This comes from evidence given\n\nby Robinson that all 3 of them were employed by the 1stPlaintiffs and their\n\nbusiness cards exhibited in ABD99 had Australian addresses. He argued that as the\n\ndefendants did not produce any evidence to the contrary, on a balance of probability, they\n\nwere residents of Australia at the time. Mr Lee said that residence in Australia was not\n\nnecessarily the only conclusion to be drawn from the fact of their employment by the 1stPlaintiffs. He pointed out that the 1stPlaintiffs had offices overseas and,\n\nlike Robinson who was posted to Singapore, Lind and Holzapfel could have been posted and\n\nresident overseas at the time the works were made.28. In my view, what is relevant is residency status at the time of\n\ncreation of the documents. While one can say that the business cards show that they were\n\nbased in Australia at one time, there is no evidence that they were based there at the\n\ntime of creation of the documents. Take Robinson for example. His business card shows an\n\nAustralian office address, telephone and fax numbers. But he also said that he had\n\nobtained a Singapore employment pass 7 or 8 years ago. He had exhibited a business card\n\nshowing an Australian address and yet he was resident in Singapore for a number of years.\n\nSection 3(3) of the Evidence Act provides as follows:A fact is said to be \"proved\" when, after considering the\n\n  matters before it, the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so\n\n  probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act\n\n  upon the supposition that it exists.In the present case, the same possibility cannot be ruled out in\n\nrespect of Holzapfel and Lind in the absence of evidence to that effect. Therefore I\n\ncannot consider the residency status at the material time of Lind and Holzapfel to be so\n\nprobable under the circumstances as would cause a prudent man to act on the supposition\n\nthat it is true. Accordingly I find that the plaintiffs have not proved that Lind and\n\nHolzapfel were residents of Australia at the material time.29. Robinson, who gave oral evidence in court, did not disclose his\n\ncitizenship status. He even quoted his passport number but did not state the country of\n\nissue. Had he simply stated that it was an Australian passport, I would have been able to\n\ninfer that he was an Australian citizen, although there is still the question of whether\n\nhe possessed that status at the time he made the documents concerned. Bluntly put, there\n\nis simply no evidence that he was an Australian citizen or was resident in Australia at\n\nthe material time. Although it would appear that he had been resident in Singapore for the\n\nlast 7 or 8 years, there is no evidence that he created the documents in question while he\n\nwas resident here. Therefore I find that the plaintiffs have not proved that Robinson was\n\nresident in Australia or Singapore at the time he created the documents in question.30. If I were wrong about Robinson, and ought to find that he was\n\nresident either in Australia or Singapore at the time of creation of the documents in\n\nquestion, it would then be necessary to consider documents ABD89-93 in respect of which I\n\nhave found that the plaintiffs have proved that each of these 5 documents was made by\n\nRobinson, Holzapfel or Lind individually or in any combination. The question is whether it\n\ncan be said that the plaintiffs have proved, in respect of these documents, that the\n\nauthor or authors were citizens or residents of Australia. In respect of each document\n\nthere is the possibility that Robinson was not involved in its creation. Therefore the\n\nplaintiffs cannot be taken as having proved that the author, or one of the authors, of\n\neach document was a resident of Australia or Singapore at the time of its creation. The\n\nburden of proving authorship of a document over which copyright is claimed rests on the\n\nplaintiffs and it cannot be said that they have discharged this burden by proving that\n\nRobinsoncouldbe its author.31. Perhaps the lack of evidence of citizenship or residency may be\n\nattributable to the position taken by Mr Sivakumar as to the law. In paragraph 3.14 of his\n\nwritten closing submission, he argued as follows:The Defendants have further contended that there has been no evidence\n\n  that the 3 authors of the 1st Plaintiffsâ€™ Work were citizens or residents of\n\n  Australia at the time the work was created. This is not necessary as by virtue of\n\n  Regulation 3(5) of the Copyright (International Protection) Regulations, (PBA-28) the\n\n  Singapore Copyright Act shall apply to bodies incorporated under the laws of Australia in\n\n  the like manner as to bodies incorporated under the laws of Singapore and by virtue of\n\n  Section 30(6) of the Copyright Act (PBA-1) all works done in the course of employment by\n\n  an employee belongs to the employer so that in the present case the connecting factor is\n\n  whether the 1st Plaintiffs were a body corporate incorporated under the laws of Australia\n\n  and were the employers of the authors. This the 1st Plaintiffs have shown.32. With respect, I do not agree with Mr Sivakumar that it was not\n\nnecessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the 3 authors were citizens or residents of\n\nAustralia. Section 30(6) provides as follows (emphasis added):Where a literary â€¦ or artistic work to which subsections (4) and\n\n  (5) do not apply, â€¦ is made by the author in pursuance of the terms of his employment\n\n  by another person under a contract of service or apprenticeship, that other person shall\n\n  be entitled toany copyright subsisting in the work by virtue of this Part.Counsel were unable to produce any authority on the interpretation of\n\nthis provision. Nevertheless, in my view it is clear enough. The words of the provision\n\nunderlined above refer to copyright subsisting by virtue of Part III of the Act. Section\n\n30(6) itself does not establish any copyright. It provides that in the situation where\n\nsubsections (4) and (5) do not apply to the work concerned, the employer shall be entitled\n\nto any copyright that subsists by virtue of Part III of the Act. Indeed the section\n\nheading to section 30 states \"ownership of copyright in original works.\" This\n\nsuggests that it relates to ownership and not to subsistence of copyright. The other\n\nsubstantive subsections of section 30, namely (2), (4) and (5), also refer to \"any\n\ncopyright subsisting in the work by virtue of this Part\".33. In the present case copyright must first of all subsist by virtue\n\nof section 27(1). If the author had made the work in pursuance of the terms of his\n\nemployment by the 1stPlaintiffs under a contract of service or apprenticeship,\n\nthen the 1stPlaintiffs would, by operation of section 30(6), be entitled to\n\nsuch copyright. Therefore it is still necessary to establish that copyright subsists in\n\nthe work pursuant to section 27(1). One necessary element is citizenship or residency at\n\nthe time or a substantial part of the period of the making of the literary or artistic\n\nwork.34. Mr Sivakumar had invoked regulation 3(5). I find that this has no\n\nrelevance in question before me on the operation of section 30(6) and it is incumbent upon\n\nme to explain the scope of this regulation. Regulation 3(5) provides as follows:Subject to these Regulations, the Act shall apply in relation to bodies\n\n  incorporated under the law of a country that constitutes, or forms part of, the territory\n\n  of a country specified in the Schedule in like manner as those provisions shall apply in\n\n  relation to bodies incorporated under the law of Singapore.What this provision does is to treat corporations in the countries\n\nspecified in the Schedule as if they were incorporated in Singapore for the purposes of\n\nthe Act. Hence, in Part IV of the Act, a body incorporated in Australia would enjoy the\n\nsame treatment as one incorporated in Singapore in relation to copyright in sound\n\nrecordings, cinematograph films and the other matters provided for in that Part.35. However regulation 3(5) has no relevance to the present case.\n\nSection 27 and 30 are in Part III of the Act which is concerned only with authors who are\n\nnatural persons. This is evident from section 27 where, for copyright to subsist, the\n\nauthor has to be a \"qualified person\". That term is defined in section 27(4) to\n\nmean a citizen of Singapore or a person resident in Singapore. The term \"citizen of\n\nSingapore\" is not defined in the Act but is defined in the Interpretation Act as\n\n\"any person who, under the provisions of the Constitution, has the status of a\n\ncitizen of Singapore\". Those provisions of the Constitution relate only to natural\n\npersons. As for the term \"person resident in Singapore\", section 8 of the Act\n\nprovides that such term shall include a person who does so by virtue of a valid pass under\n\nthe Immigration Act. Furthermore, section 28 provides that the duration of copyright\n\nsubsisting by virtue of Part III of the Act shall continue to subsist until the expiration\n\nof 50 years after the death of the author. For these reasons, the term \"author\"\n\nin Part III refers only to a natural person. This may be contrasted with Part IV where the\n\nterm \"qualified person\" is defined in section 81 as (a) a citizen of or an\n\nindividual resident in Singapore or (b) a body corporate incorporated under any written\n\nlaw in Singapore.36. In the result, I find that the plaintiffs have not proved that the\n\nauthors of the works were citizens or residents of Australia at the material time.",
        "2.1.3 Whether employees of 1stPlaintiffs": "37. Robinson had said in paragraph 7 of his affidavit that he,\n\nHolzapfel and Lind were employees of the 1stPlaintiffs for, respectively, more\n\nthan 35 years, 10 years and 4 years. He also exhibited business cards of the 3 of them\n\nunder the 1stPlaintiffs' name. Mr Lee disputed that this constituted evidence\n\nthat Holzapfel and Lind were employed at the material time but was not in a position to\n\ngive evidence to the contrary. However the defendants had in their Defence, not admitted\n\nthe plaintiffs' ownership to the copyright and had put them to strict proof thereof.38. In my view, it is necessary for the plaintiffs to produce\n\ndocumentary evidence of employment, such as the employment contract or letter of\n\nappointment. A mere assertion by Robinson that Holzapfel and Lind were employees would not\n\nsuffice to satisfy the burden of proof in the present case. This is because section 30(6)\n\nprovides that for the employer to be entitled to copyright in works created by an\n\nemployee, that employee must have made the work in pursuance of the terms of his\n\nemployment under a contract of service or apprenticeship. There is a difference between a\n\ncontractof serviceand a contractfor serviceand it would be necessary for\n\nthe plaintiffs to produce evidence of the nature of such employment. It is not for\n\nRobinson to determine whether their employment contract was a contractof serviceorfor service. Further, as this fact is not admitted, the production of such\n\ndocuments would enable the defendants to cross-examine the witnesses on this issue or to\n\npoint to anything in the documents that may be in their favour. Accordingly I find that\n\nthe plaintiffs have not satisfied the burden on them to prove this fact.2.2 Infringement39. On the assumption that the 1stPlaintiffs own the\n\ncopyright to the literary and artistic works in the documents in question, I now turn to\n\nthe question of infringement. The 1stPlaintiffs alleged that the defendants\n\ninfringed their copyright in their works by reproducing them in a material form in the\n\nfollowing 3 ways:(a) by making unauthorised photocopies of ABD81-96;(b) by making unauthorised sketch copies of PSBD8, PSBD11 and PSBD13;\n\n  and(c) by making the Defendants' machine without authorisation.2.2.1 Photocopies40. The 1stDefendant denied making photocopies of ABD81-96.\n\nThe plaintiffs were unable to produce any witness who could say that he had seen the 1stDefendant make the copies or in possession of such copies. All that Mr Sivakumar could do\n\nwas to point to the affidavit evidence-in-chief of one Victor Goh (\"Goh\"),\n\nparagraph 7 of which goes as follows:[The 1stDefendant] confided in me by telling me that he had\n\n  secretly returned to the 2ndPlaintiffs' office after working hours to\n\n  photocopy documents in order to design his machine and to secure customers. He said that\n\n  he was collecting information progressively.Even if this is evidence of an admission, it fails to identify the\n\ndocuments that the 1stDefendant had admitted photocopying. In\n\ncross-examination Goh said that the 1stDefendant did not tell him what\n\ndocuments he had photocopied. He also said that when he was at the 2ndDefendants' factory, he did not see anything that could be construed as the property of\n\nthe 2ndPlaintiffs.41. To prove infringement by photocopying, the plaintiffs must prove\n\nthat the 1stDefendant had made the photocopies of the documents over which\n\ncopyright is claimed. Clearly there is no evidence of this before me and I must find that\n\nthe plaintiffs have not proved that the defendants had photocopied ABD81-96.2.2.2 Sketch copies42. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants had made sketches that are\n\nunauthorised copies of:(i) PSBD8 in the defendants' document ABD366-367(ii) PSBD11 in the defendants' document ABD375;(iii) PSBD11 in the defendants' document ABD376; and(iv) PSBD13 in the defendants' document ABD381.I shall examine each pair of drawings in turn.",
        "2.2.2.1 PSBD8 and ABD366-367": "43. The plaintiffs' document, PSBD13, is a sketch of an element of the\n\nPlaintiffs' machine, a triangular steel plate called the pivot plate. Its function is to\n\ntransfer the direction and magnitude of a force from a hydraulic jack onto the top wheel\n\nwhich presses on the tube to form the convolution. The sketch itself is a line\n\nrepresentation of the side view of the pivot plate, showing essentially a triangle with\n\nrounded and bulging corners and holes at each of the 3 corners for the pins. The distances\n\nbetween the 3 holes are 250, 500 and 574mm. The sketch shows 2 of the 3 angles of the\n\ntriangle as 34.5oand 59.5oand from this the third angle may be\n\ncomputed to be 86o.44. The defendants' ABD376 is a sketch of the corresponding pivot plate\n\nin the Defendants' machine. It is also essentially a triangle with 3 holes at the corners.\n\nTwo of the holes are also 250mm apart. However the differences are as follows:(i) the 3 corners appear different, in particular there is no bulge in\n\n  the defendants' drawing;(ii) only one angle of the defendants' triangle is given, making the\n\n  other 2 indeterminate. However this angle, 46o, corresponds to the corner in\n\n  the plaintiffs' sketch which is marked as 59.5o.Visually, because of these 2 differences, the triangles look different.\n\nI find that there is no substantial reproduction in ABD366-367 of the drawing in PBD8.",
        "2.2.2.2 PSBD11 and ABD375": "45. The plaintiffs' drawing, PSBD11, is a side view cross-section of\n\nanother element of the Plaintiffs' machine, a device used to hold the bellows rings. It\n\nalso contains a cross-section of the bellows rings. The defendants' ABD375 is a drawing of\n\nthe corresponding device in the Defendants' machine. However it is a top view of the\n\ndevice. In terms of appearance, the 2 drawings are dissimilar, mainly because one is a\n\nside view cross-section and the other is a view from the top. I find that there is no\n\nsubstantial reproduction in ABD375 of PSBD11.",
        "2.2.2.3 PSBD11 and ABD376": "46. The defendants' document, ABD376, is a rough sketch of the same\n\nbellows rings holding device in the Defendants' machine. This time it is a side view\n\ncross-section as in the plaintiffs' PSBD11. The similarities are as follows:(i) both feature a 90mm square bar, the plaintiffs' is 354mm long and\n\n  the defendants' is 360mm;(ii) both feature a 50mm diameter shaft at the end of the 90mm square\n\n  bar, of length 270mm.47. The dissimilarities are as follows:(i) The defendants' drawing features two triangles that are hatched\n\n  adjoining the entire length of the 90mm square bar. There is no such feature in the\n\n  plaintiffs' drawing;(ii) The defendants' drawing comprises entirely of the 90mm square bar,\n\n  the 50mm shaft, the 2 hatched triangles and a 25mm-thick plate at one end. The plaintiffs'\n\n  drawing has the 90mm square bar and the 50mm shaft, no triangles and the plate at the end\n\n  is 20mm thick. But it also has details of other parts of the device, including the\n\n  important part which shows how the bellows rings sit on it. This comprises a pair of 40mm\n\n  shafts with bearings for the rings to roll over. And the cross-section of the bellows\n\n  rings are drawn on the plaintiffs' drawing.48. In view of the simplicity of the defendants' drawing, the amount of\n\ndetails in the plaintiffs' drawing which is left out in the defendants' drawing, and the\n\nfact that the 2 triangles in the defendants' drawing are striking features which do not\n\nappear in the plaintiffs' drawing, I find that there is no substantial reproduction in\n\nABD376 of PSBD11.2.2.2.4 PSBD13 and ABD38149. The plaintiffs' drawing, PSBD13 is a drawing of an element of the\n\nPlaintiffs' machine, the bottom wheel assembly. It shows how the pair of bottom wheels is\n\nmounted on a shaft which in turn is mounted on a series of steel plates welded in a\n\nbox-shaped assembly. This assembly is bolted to the shaft of a hydraulic cylinder. The\n\ndefendants' drawing, ABD381, comprises 2 parts and the similarity only concerns the\n\ndrawing on the left. That is a drawing of the corresponding element of the Defendants'\n\nmachine. It also shows the pair of bottom wheels mounted on a shaft which is in turn\n\nmounted on a box-like plate assembly.50. The following are the points of similarity:(i) the general layout are similar, although some dimensions differ;(ii) both pairs of wheels are 25mm thick;(iii) both wheel shafts have substantially the same thickness\n\n  (plaintiffs' is 66mm and defendants' is 65mm);(iv) plates used in both box-assemblies are 40mm thick;(v) the internal widths of both box assemblies are substantially the\n\n  same (plaintiffs' is 156mm and defendants' is 158mm);(vi) the distance between the shaft and the base of the box-assembly is\n\n  230mm in both drawings.51. The following are the points of difference:(i) the diameter of the plaintiffs' wheels is 250mm whereas the\n\n  defendants' is 300mm;(ii) the gap between the wheels is 37mm in the plaintiffs' drawing and\n\n  30mm in the defendants';(iii) the lengths of the wheel shafts are different, 360mm in the\n\n  plaintiffs' and about 250mm in the defendants';(iv) the defendants' drawing features slide bearings which are not\n\n  found in the plaintiffs', and various other details of bushes are different;(v) the defendants' drawing features two bolts connecting the 2 wheels\n\n  which is not featured in the plaintiffs' drawing;(vi) The plaintiffs' drawing shows a bolt and nut connecting the\n\n  assembly to the hydraulic cylinder. No such features are in the defendants' drawing.52. Whether one drawing amounts to a substantial reproduction of\n\nanother does not depend solely on a comparison of the number of similarities and\n\ndifferences. It is the quality of what is copied that matters. InLadbrooke (Football)\n\nLtd v William Hill (Football) Ltd[1964] WLR 273, Lord Reid said at p. 276:Copyright gives the exclusive right to do certain things including\n\n  \"reproducing the work in any material form\" â€¦ and reproduction includes\n\n  reproduction of a substantial part of the work â€¦ Broadly, a reproduction means\n\n  copying, and does not include cases where an author or compiler produces a substantially\n\n  similar result by independent work without copying. And, if he does copy, the question\n\n  whether he has copied a substantial part depends much more on the quality than on the\n\n  quantity of what he had taken.From a cursory glance of the 2 drawings one could easily conclude that\n\nthey refer to the same contraption and it is only in a detailed study that the differences\n\nare observed. This is because the striking feature of the drawings are the twin wheels,\n\nthe wheel-shaft and the box-like assembly. On balance, I would find that the drawing in\n\nABD381 is of a degree of similarity to PBSD13 as would make it a substantial reproduction\n\nthereof if ABD381 had been copied from PBSD13.53. The remaining question is whether it was copied from PSBD13. There\n\nis no allegation that the 1stDefendant had access to PSBD13. Indeed there is\n\nno evidence as to where PSBD13 was kept within the 2ndPlaintiffs' premises, if\n\nat all it was kept there. The only mention of this document is in paragraph 25 of\n\nRobinson's supplementary affidavit where he said:[ABD381] is a copy of the Defendants' drawing and I identify it as a\n\n  Bottom Wheel Assembly. The Plaintiffs' drawing of the same can be found at [PSBD13]. The\n\n  function of the Bottom Wheel is to form convolutions on the bellow tube. I note that the\n\n  height measuring from â€¦As was the case with regard to the issue of authorship, there was no\n\nevidence on the role that PSBD13 played in the making of the ABD381. The 1stDefendant denied having seen PSBD13 before. Even if the 1stDefendant had to\n\ncopy the drawing in ABD381 from somewhere, as I shall find below, he could have done so\n\nfrom looking at the Plaintiffs' machine or from some other document. As there is no causal\n\nlink between the 2 documents, I cannot find ABD381 to be a reproduction of PSBD13.2.2.3 Defendants' machine54. The plaintiffs claim that the Defendants' machine is a reproduction\n\nin 3-dimensions of their artistic works in the following documents: ABD89, 95 and 96, and\n\nPSBD8, 11 and 13. Before embarking on a consideration of those documents in relation to\n\nthe Defendants' machine, it is necessary to set out the facts relating to its\n\nconstruction.2.2.3.1 Construction of Defendants' machine55. The 1stDefendant claimed that he designed and built the\n\nDefendants' machine with the help of one Ong Beng Sim (\"Ong\"), the foreman of\n\nthe 2ndDefendants. Ong gave evidence that he had worked for more than 30 years\n\nin the mechanical engineering industry. He was a machinist for more than 10 years and had\n\nextensive experience as a machine fitter and in pipe fabrication and welding work. The 1stDefendant said in cross-examination that the machine at the 2ndPlaintiffs'\n\npremises was located at a place where all persons working there, whether on the shop floor\n\nor at the office upstairs (where he was) had to pass it in order to go to the toilet. To\n\nthat extent he had access to the machine. But he said that he was not shown, nor had he\n\nseen, any of the drawings of the Plaintiffs' machine. He said that as a sales engineer he\n\nwas not involved in the manufacture of the bellows. He gave evidence of his background: he\n\nobtained a technician's certificate from the Industrial Training Board in 1979. In 1983 he\n\nattended courses in Tool and Die Making at the Vocational and Industrial Training Board.\n\nHe had worked as a machinist in various companies. Thereafter he worked at various marine\n\ncompanies before enrolling at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 1992 for a course in Electrical\n\nPlant Maintenance. He said that as a result of his training and work experience, he was\n\nqualified to design and build machine tools.56. Robinson gave evidence that he held a Certificate of Mechanical\n\nEngineering III from Sydney Technical College. He had experience in the field of flexible\n\ntechnology and in the manufacture of flexible metal expansion joints. He said that\n\nHolzapfel held a civil engineering degree and was employed by the 1stPlaintiffs as a Technical Applications Engineer for 10 years. Lind had a degree in\n\nMechanical Engineering and was the 1stPlaintiffs' design engineer for 4 years.\n\nThe 3 of them had designed and built the Plaintiffs' machine, expending approximately\n\n1,500 hours and relying on their skill, experience and extensive research on bellows form\n\nand design criteria.57. Having heard the oral evidence and having seen both the Plaintiffs'\n\nmachine and the Defendants' machine, I find that neither the 1stDefendant nor\n\nOng possessed the technical expertise to design and build a machine of this nature. I am\n\nsatisfied that the Plaintiffs' machine merits the 1,500 hours that Robinson claimed were\n\nspent by the 3 of them in designing and building it. Robinson said that as an engineer who\n\nhad been intimately involved in this area, it was apparent from the defendants' drawings\n\nand photographs of their machine that they had taken all the essential elements of the\n\nPlaintiffs' machine. I accept his evidence because from the 1stDefendants'\n\nanswers in cross-examination, it was clear that he had sized the structural elements of\n\nthe Defendants' machine based, not on his own calculations, but on the corresponding\n\nelements in the Plaintiffs' machine. I am satisfied that the 1stDefendant was\n\nnot capable of building his machine without considerable information coming from the\n\nplaintiffs, whether by way of documents or measurements of the Plaintiffs' machine.58. Obviously the plaintiffs cannot claim infringement of copyright\n\nover documents not proved before me. The plaintiffs' claim is based purely on the\n\ndocuments ABD89, 95 and 96, and PSBD8, 11 and 13. Mr Sivakumar submits that the 1stDefendant had access to these documents. I had dealt earlier with the documents PSBD8, 11\n\nand 13 and have found that there was no evidence that the 1stDefendant had\n\naccess to them nor even as to where they were kept. The plaintiffs' evidence only shows\n\nthat he had access to ABD81-96. I accept the evidence in this regard and accordingly find\n\nthat the 1stDefendant had access to ABD89, 95 and 96, but not to PSBD8, 11 and\n\n13.",
        "2.2.3.2 Was Plaintiffs' machine based on ABD89, 95 and 96?": "59. I now turn to consider the nature of the 3 documents, ABD89, 95 and\n\n96. ABD89 is a \"general arrangement\" drawing of the Plaintiffs' machine. It is\n\nnot to scale and does not contain any dimensions. It essentially shows the locations of\n\nthe various elements of the machine. Robinson said that ABD89 was part of the operating\n\ninstructions for a re-rolling process and not a drawing based on which the Plaintiffs'\n\nmachine was built. His evidence in cross-examination was as follows:Q No, I'm referring to the two drawings, the two sketches, [ABD] 89 and\n\n  90.A 89 and 90 is part of the machine of the Radcoflex RF-2 machine.Q Are these blue print drawings?A No.Q They don't have dimensions in them?A Obviously, no.Q The person who drew these two sketches, the name is not there?A No. It's a general arrangement drawing.Q So you cannot build a machine based on these two sketches?A No.Q Therefore, the RF-2 machine could not have been built based on these\n\n  two sketches, it follows.A The machine was not built with those two drawings. If you refer to a\n\n  part of the drawings---Q Thank you.A ----you will see that the machine was built from engineering\n\n  drawings.Accordingly I find that the Plaintiffs' machine was not built based on\n\nABD89. I should state that ABD90 contains a drawing similar in all respects save in one\n\ndetail. The plaintiffs do not appear to base their case on this document, but in any event\n\nall the considerations for ABD89 apply in relation to ABD90.60. As for ABD95, it is a drawing entitled \"Top Wheel\" and\n\nshows the cross-section of a wheel 420mm in diameter and 25mm thick. It has a 60mm\n\ndiameter hole in the centre and 8 smaller holes at a radius of 130mm from the centre.\n\nRobinson could not say for sure that the corresponding element on the Plaintiffs' machine,\n\ni.e. the top wheel, had the same dimensions. However he believed that it did. Robinson\n\nalso was not able to assert that the top wheel of the Plaintiffs' machine was based on\n\nABD95. Therefore I find that the plaintiffs have not proved that the top wheel on the\n\nPlaintiffs' machine was built based on that document.61. ABD96 is a drawing entitled \"Wheel Assembly\" and shows\n\nthe cross-section of the top wheel mounted on a shaft and the 2 bottom wheels mounted on\n\nanother shaft. The components of this assembly are set out in a table in the document but\n\nthe dimensions of the top and bottom wheels are not given. Robinson explained that this\n\nwas an assembly drawing, i.e. one which showed how each part fitted in the assembly. The\n\ndetailed dimensions of each part would be specified in other drawings. He said that he\n\npresumed that this drawing related to the Plaintiffs' machine but could not be sure\n\nbecause there was no indication as such on the document. He also agreed with Mr Lee that\n\nit was not possible to construct a wheel assembly based on ABD96. As Robinson could not\n\nstate with certainty that the wheel assembly on the Plaintiffs' machine is based on ABD96,\n\nI also cannot find that the plaintiffs have proved this.",
        "2.2.3.3 The law on indirect copying": "62. By virtue of section 15(3) of the Act, an artistic work in\n\n2-dimensions is deemed to be reproduced if a version of it is produced in a 3-dimensional\n\nform (subject to section 69, which is considered later in this judgment). There is no\n\nevidence that the plaintiffs' drawings were used to build the Defendants' machine. But I\n\nhave found that the 1stDefendant had used information either from the\n\nplaintiffs' drawings of their machine or directly obtained from the Plaintiffs' machine.\n\nThe latter situation is described as indirect copying of the drawing and I turn to examine\n\nthe law in this respect.63. Where a 3-dimensional object, \"A\", is copied from another\n\n3-dimensional object which is a copy of a drawing, \"A\" is a reproduction of that\n\ndrawing for the purposes of copyright infringement. InKing Features Syndicate Inc v O.\n\nand M. Kleeman Ltd[1941] AC 417 the plaintiffs sued for infringement of copyright in\n\nrespect of the comic strip figure \"Popeye, the Sailor\". The plaintiffs had\n\nlicensed third parties to reproduce toys and figurines based on the \"Popeye\"\n\ncharacter. The defendants had in fact negotiated with the plaintiffs for such a licence\n\nbut the parties could not agree to the terms. Without authorisation of the plaintiffs, the\n\ndefendants bought toys and brooches resembling the character for sale and the plaintiffs\n\ncommenced the action. Because the number of drawings of \"Popeye\" was large, the\n\nplaintiffs restricted themselves to proving ownership of copyright in respect of only 55\n\ndrawings. The licensees' figures were made based on one or other of the drawings. The\n\ndefendants' brooches were copied not from the drawings but from the licensees' figures.\n\nThe defendants submitted that as their brooches were copied from the licensees' figures\n\nand not from the plaintiffs drawings, they were not reproductions of the drawings. The\n\nratio of the decision of the House of Lords is accurately summarised in the following\n\npassage from the headnote:Held, that the defendants' dolls and brooches were reproductions\n\n  in a material form of the plaintiffs' original artistic work and were not the less so\n\n  because they were copied, not directly from any sketch of the plaintiffs, but from a\n\n  reproduction in material form derived directly or indirectly from the original work â€¦64.Â Â Â  The \"Popeye\" case involved drawings that had eye appeal\n\nand were of a non-functional nature. The same principle applies in respect of drawings\n\nthat are purely functional in nature.L.B. (Plastics) Ltd v Swish Products Ltd[1979] RPC 551concerns plastic components of knock-down drawers. The plaintiffs produced\n\nsuch components and were the owners of the copyright in the drawings of such components.\n\nThe trial court found that the defendants produced their components by using a sample of\n\nthe plaintiffs' components as a model. The House of Lords affirmed the court's finding\n\nthat such indirect copying amounted to production of a version of the drawings.65. The House of Lords re-affirmed the principle of indirect copying inBritish Leyland Motor Corp Ltd v Armstrong Patents Co Ltd[1986] 2 WLR 400. In that\n\ncase, the defendants made exhaust pipes by copying the shape and dimensions of pipes made\n\nby the plaintiffs, a process known as \"reverse engineering\". The plaintiffs\n\nbrought an action for infringement of copyright in their drawings of the exhaust pipes.\n\nThe House of Lords unanimously held that on the basis of the line of authorities leading\n\nup to theSwishcase, indirect copying of a drawing relating purely to a functional\n\ndesign constitutes infringement of copyright in the drawing. Lord Templeman said (at\n\np.427):The decision of this House in L.B. (Plastics) Ltd. v. Swish Products\n\n  Ltd. [1979] R.P.C. 551 shows clearly that as the law now stands the first argument put\n\n  forward by Armstrong namely that copyright does not apply to prevent the indirect copying\n\n  of drawings of functional articles cannot be sustained.66. In all the 3 cases discussed above, the 3-dimensional objects which\n\nwere copied by the defendants were themselves copies of drawings over which copyright was\n\nestablished. In the present case, the plaintiffs have not proved that the drawings over\n\nwhich copyright is claimed were the ones used to construct the Plaintiffs' machine. Indeed\n\nRobinson had said that their machine could not have been constructed from ABD89. Although\n\nthere are similarities between the Defendants' machine and the drawings in ABD89, 95 and\n\n96, the question is whether, if the Defendants' machine had been directly copied from the\n\nPlaintiffs' machine, it would amount to indirect copying of those drawings as they were\n\nnot used to construct the Plaintiffs' machine. For my part, the answer is clear. If a\n\n3-dimensional object was not made based on a drawing, a second 3-dimensional object which\n\nwas copied directly from the first cannot be an indirect copy of the drawing\n\nnotwithstanding any similarity between that second object and the drawing. It would be a\n\ntravesty of logic if it were otherwise.67. Quite apart from logic, to hold otherwise would result in an\n\nunjustified extension of the principle of indirect copying. The law of copyright is\n\nintended to protect the skill and labour of the maker of the artistic work and not that of\n\nthe person who undertook the engineering design constituting the technical basis for the\n\nartistic work. In theBritish Leylandcase, Lord Templeman said (at p.419):BL's engineering drawings are artistic works but they are only original\n\n  in so far as they represent the skill and labour of the draughtsman. The shape,\n\n  configuration, dimensions and exact measurements of the exhaust pipe were contributed by\n\n  the skill and labour of the design engineer not by the draughtsman. By directly copying\n\n  the exhaust pipe Armstrong make use of the work of the design engineer but do not make use\n\n  of the work of the author of the drawing. BL's exhaust pipe could have been made without\n\n  BL's drawing. Armstrong's exhaust pipe was made without BL's drawing. BL's object in these\n\n  proceedings is not to prevent reproduction of the drawing which is protected by copyright\n\n  but to prevent reproduction of the exhaust pipe which is not entitled to any protection\n\n  whatsoever.68. Indeed the House of Lords wrestled with the notion that copyright\n\ncould subsist in a purely functional design but concluded that such was the state of the\n\nlaw. As Lord Griffiths said (at p.434):It might at one stage in the history of artistic copyright have been\n\n  possible to argue that Parliament only intended copyright to extend to paintings or\n\n  drawings which could fairly be described as works of fine art; indeed, when Parliament\n\n  first gave the protection of copyright to artists by the Fine Arts Copyright Act 1862 (25\n\n  & 26 Vict. c. 68) I believe that it was probably so limited. But, whatever may have\n\n  been the position in the past, Parliament when it enacted the Copyright Act 1956 followed\n\n  the advice of the Gregory Report (Report of the Copyright Committee (1952) (Cmd. 8662))\n\n  and conferred copyright on any drawing irrespective of artistic quality and included in\n\n  the definition of drawing any diagram, map, chart or plan. Thus, Parliament made clear, to\n\n  my mind beyond argument, that the draughtsman is entitled to the copyright in every\n\n  original mechanical drawing that he produces and if he does so in the course of his\n\n  employment the copyright is that of his employer.69. Lord Griffiths had taken a different tack from the other 4 members\n\nof the House in this decision and said that the decision in theSwishcase\n\nupholding the principle of indirect copying should be reversed. Although the other judges\n\ndid not resort to this drastic step, they nevertheless expressed their dissatisfaction\n\nwith the direction that the law had taken in respect of artistic works which were simply\n\nfunctional designs. This is because the protection given in respect of artistic works is\n\nto the skill of the author whereas the protection sought in the case of functional design\n\ndrawings is over the work of the designer and not that of the draughtsman who put that\n\noutput on paper. The remedies for this in copyright law are quite inappropriate. As Lord\n\nBridge of Harwich said (at p.413):But I must add that I regard the present law as highly unsatisfactory\n\n  in at least two respects. First, copyright protection for functional designs, as extended\n\n  to articles of functional utility manufactured in accordance with those designs, would\n\n  certainly seem to be capable of abuse as a means of obtaining many of the advantages\n\n  conferred by patent monopoly while circumventing the many stringent conditions and\n\n  safeguards to which patent protection is subject. Secondly, whatever protection the\n\n  industrial designer may need to safeguard the product of his skills against piracy, I find\n\n  it difficult to suppose that a rational legislator, devising a comprehensive code ab\n\n  initio for the protection of intellectual property, would deliberately include a provision\n\n  for the recovery of conversion damages in respect of industrial products which infringe\n\n  the protection accorded to industrial designs. In the field of fine arts substantially the\n\n  entire value of a copy accrues from the work of the original artist. This is surely the\n\n  rationale of the provision for conversion damages for infringements of copyright. In the\n\n  field of industrial design the designer contributes only a modest fraction of the value of\n\n  the product. Thus, to award conversion damages for infringing industrial copies of a\n\n  protected industrial design is irrationally generous to the designer and punitive of the\n\n  infringer.70. Lord Templeman, with whom Lord Scarman agreed, expressed the same\n\nsentiments (at p.420):An article embodying an invention which is not patented does not enjoy the 20 years\n\n  restriction on use of the invention afforded by patent law. An article embodying a design\n\n  which is not registrable does not attract the 15 years restriction on reproduction\n\n  afforded by design copyright. An article which is not an artistic work does not attract\n\n  the life plus 50 years restriction on reproduction afforded by copyright law to artistic\n\n  works. But if BL are right, an article which is not patented, not registered and is not an\n\n  artistic work acquires the life plus 50 years restriction on reproduction afforded by\n\n  copyright to an artistic work.71. I therefore hold that where a 3-dimensional object is copied from\n\nanother 3-dimensional object, the scope of the principle of indirect copying does not\n\nextend to drawings which were not the basis of the construction of the object copied from.\n\nIn the present case, even if it can be said that the Defendants' machine is substantially\n\nsimilar to the drawings in question, it cannot amount to a reproduction of those drawings\n\nmerely because it is copied directly from the Plaintiffs' machine.",

Mr Lee submitted that even if the court found that the Defendants'\n\nmachine is a reproduction of the drawings over which copyright subsists and the plaintiffs\n\nprove that they own such copyright, the defendants have not infringed the copyright by\n\noperation of section 69 of the Act. In view of the findings that I have made, this defence\n\nis a minor point and I do not propose to examine it in detail. A discussion of the origin\n\nof the English equivalent of this provision, viz. section 9(8) of the English Copyright\n\nAct 1956, appears in the speech of Lord Templeman in theBritish Leylandcase (at\n\npp.424-428).74. Section 69 provides as follows:69. For the purposes of this Act -(a) the making of an object of any kind that is in 3 dimensions does\n\n    not infringe the copyright in an artistic work that is in 2 dimensions; and(b) the making of an object of any kind that is in 2 dimensions does\n\n    not infringe the copyright in an artistic work that is in 3 dimensions,if the object would not appear to persons who are not experts in\n\n  relation to objects of that kind to be a reproduction of the artistic work.75. This provision has prompted comment in theSwishandBritish\n\nLeylandcases in relation to the manner in which evidence is to be brought. It appears\n\nto have been accepted that the trial judge would make the assessment, putting himself in\n\nthe shoes of \"persons who are not experts in relation to objects of that kind\"\n\nand deciding whether the object appears to such persons to be a reproduction of the\n\nartistic work. Lord Wilberforce said in theSwishcase (at p.622):[Section 9(8)] introduces, in the context of reproduction in another\n\n  dimension, a test which may be described as a test of lay recognition - one well known and\n\n  applied in many different contexts in American law - for example in relation to dolls or\n\n  toys made after comic strip characters, or in relation to musical reproductions. It\n\n  inevitably gives rise to difficulties as to the nature of the evidence which may be\n\n  received, and as to the degree of non-expertise to be attributed to the judge. The\n\n  subsection applies by way, and only by way of defence, i.e. after the issue of copying has\n\n  been decided, and on the assumption that it has been decided in favour of the plaintiff.\n\n  It is for the defendant to make it good. In relation to the subject-matter, it was, as\n\n  both sides seem to have accepted, for the judge, placing himself in his position of a\n\n  non-expert in relation to extruded or moulded components (see the wording of the\n\n  subsection), to decide whether the respondents' components appeared, or rather did not\n\n  appear, to be reproductions of the appellants' drawings. For this purpose he must be\n\n  entitled to compare the objects with the drawing, and, in my opinion, to take account of\n\n  any written matter on the drawing. â€¦ In performing this task the judge must also be\n\n  credited with some ability to interpret design drawings: the subsection does not say the\n\n  contrary, and without it the comparison could not be made. But the comparison to be made\n\n  is, as I understand it, a visual comparison. The (non-expert) judge should not repeat the\n\n  process which, as judge with the assistance of expert and other witnesses, he has gone\n\n  through in deciding whether there has been copying or not.76. In the present case, I have viewed the Defendants' machine.\n\nComparing it with the ABD89, which is a schematic drawing of the machine, I find that\n\nthere are similarities in the major features, viz. the motor, the wheel assembly, the long\n\nbeam running from the base of the motor to the bottom wheel assembly, the shaft connecting\n\nthe motor to the top wheel, the top wheel housing, the pneumatic jacks, and the\n\n\"pendulum bar\" which connects one of the jacks to the top wheel. There is also\n\nsubstantial similarity in the co-location of these features. I would hold that the\n\nsimilarities are so substantial that a non-expert of such objects would conclude that the\n\nDefendants' machine is a reproduction of ABD89. Therefore, if this defence applies - and I\n\nhave found that it does not - it would fail.77. ABD95 is an outline drawing of a wheel which the plaintiffs say is\n\nreproduced in the top wheel on the Defendants' machine. Although the drawing shows the\n\ndimensions of the wheel and its various features, there is no evidence that the top wheel\n\non the Defendants' machine has similar dimensions or similar relative dimensions. I am of\n\nthe view that in relation to a drawing of a common shape such as a wheel, in order to\n\nsatisfy the test of similarity, it is not sufficient to prove that the infringing object\n\nis of a similar shape. Otherwise there would be a great number of copyright infringements.\n\nIn such cases it would be necessary to show that some other unique features, such as\n\ndimensions, have been followed. Accordingly, in the present case, I find that the top\n\nwheel in the Defendants' machine would not appear to a non-expert to be a reproduction of\n\nABD95.78. ABD96 shows the top and bottom wheel assembly. The top wheel bears\n\nno resemblance to the corresponding feature in the Defendants' machine. As for the bottom\n\nwheel assembly, that shown in the drawing has a long shaft going through it whereas that\n\nin the Defendants' machine has a much shorter shaft which extends only just outside the\n\nwheels. In addition the thickness to diameter ratio of the wheels appear different, the\n\nwheels in the drawing appear to be thicker in relation to the diameter. I find that the\n\nbottom wheel of the Defendants' machine would not appear to a non-expert to be a\n\nreproduction of ABD96.3. Claim under Employment Contract79. The 2ndPlaintiffs' offer of employment to the 1stDefendant is dated 31 March 1998. He signed it on 1 April 1998 to signify his acceptance.\n\nClause 9.0 of this letter, which constitutes a term of the employment, states as follows:NON-DISCLOSURE OF TRADE SECRETSYou shall not, during your employment or afterwards, except as\n\n  authorised by the Company or required by your duties, reveal to any person any trade\n\n  secrets or confidential information concerning the business or affairs of the Company or\n\n  any of its related companies or customers which may come to your acknowledge [sic] by\n\n  reason of your employment and shall keep with complete secrecy all confidential\n\n  information entrusted to you.Mr Lee attempted to challenge the validity of this clause on the ground\n\nthat there is no time or geographic limitation but conceded that he had no authority that\n\nsuch limitations are necessary in a clause such as this in order for it to be enforceable.\n\nFurthermore the 2ndPlaintiffs contend that the 1stDefendant owed\n\nthem a duty of good faith and fidelity. This duty was breached when the 1stDefendant divulged trade secrets and confidential information to the 2ndDefendants.80. The plaintiffs contend that the trade secrets and confidential\n\ninformation that have been divulged by the 1stDefendant to the 2ndDefendants were as follows:(i) the 1stPlaintiffs' literary and artistic works the\n\n  subject matter of their claim in copyright;(ii) the names and addresses of the 2ndPlaintiffs'\n\n  customers;(iii) the usual requirements of the 2ndPlaintiffs'\n\n  customers both as to quantity and quality;(iv) the prices charged to individual customers of the 2ndPlaintiffs.3.1 Literary and artistic works81. I accept the plaintiffs' evidence that the 2ndPlaintiffs kept copies of the drawings of the Radcoflex RF-2 drawings in Singapore in an\n\nunlocked metal container which was clearly marked as containing confidential information\n\nand the 1stDefendant by virtue of the nature of his job had access to the\n\ndrawings and other confidential information of the 2ndPlaintiffs. However the\n\nplaintiffs have only exhibited ABD81-96 and PSBD8, 11 and 13. There is no evidence of any\n\nother documents and I need only to consider these. Furthermore, the evidence does not show\n\nthat PSBD8, 11 and 13 were stored in the metal container nor that they were confidential.\n\nTherefore the plaintiffs' evidence in this respect is restricted only to ABD81-96.82. There is the question of the nature of the information. Mr Lee\n\nconceded that ABD81-83 was necessary to be disclosed to the 1stDefendant in\n\nhis capacity as a sales engineer. These documents relate to the sizes of the bellows and\n\nthe convolutions. However he submitted that it was not necessary to disclose to the 1stDefendant ABD84-96, which relate to the operation of the Plaintiffs' machine, as he was\n\nnot involved in production. If the plaintiffs chose to disclose these documents to the 1stDefendant when there was no necessity to do so, they cannot be confidential information or\n\ntrade secrets. In support of this contention he citedFaccenda Chicken Ltd v Fowler[1986] 1 All ER 617. In that case the English Court of Appeal held that in the absence of\n\nan express term, there was an implied term of non-disclosure of information which is of a\n\nsufficiently high degree of confidentiality as to amount to a trade secret. In considering\n\nwhether any information fell within the scope of protection of this implied term, the\n\ncourt would consider the nature of the employment, the nature of the information and the\n\nmanner in which the employer treated the information. Mr Lee submitted that the\n\ninformation in ABD84-96 could not be confidential information as the plaintiffs had given\n\nthe 1stDefendant access to it although it was not necessary for his work.\n\nHowever in this case there is an express term, clause 9.0, which prohibits disclosure of\n\nconfidential information. The documents concerned were stored in a location clearly marked\n\nas containing confidential information. In the circumstances I would hold that such\n\ninformation would fall within the scope of clause 9.0.83. However there is no direct evidence that the 1stDefendant had actually used or made copies of ABD81-96. As explained earlier, although he\n\nmust have obtained information from the plaintiffs in order to build the Defendants'\n\nmachine, there is no evidence of the exact source of such information. More importantly,\n\none possible and likely source would be the Plaintiffs' machine. Therefore I cannot infer\n\nthat ABD81-96 was used. Accordingly, I am unable to find that the plaintiffs have proved\n\ntheir claim under this head.",
        "3.2 Names and addresses of customers": "84. The plaintiffs did not exhibit any document containing the names\n\nand addresses of customers that they claim the 1stDefendant had divulged to\n\nthe 2ndDefendants. Robinson said in cross-examination that there was a name\n\nlist but failed to produce it when asked to do so. He said that there was a set of\n\ncustomers' business cards but he was not sure if he had given this to the 1stDefendant. No other witness gave evidence that this was given to him. The 1stDefendant denied receiving such information from Robinson or anyone else. Mr Sivakumar\n\nconceded that the plaintiffs have not proved this fact. Therefore this aspect of the claim\n\nmust fail.3.3 Customers' usual requirements85. The same situation obtains here. Robinson said that there was a\n\nlist of usual requirements of the plaintiffs' customers. But he was not the one who gave\n\nthis list to the 1stDefendant. He said that his product manager, Ng, would\n\nknow about this. However Ng did not say anything about this. I should add that the list\n\nwas not produced. Mr Sivakumar makes the same concession that there is no evidence in\n\nrespect of this breach. Accordingly this claim also fails.3.4 Prices86. The evidence on this is equally scarce. Again nobody gave any\n\nevidence of the existence of a list of prices and that these were given to the 1stDefendant. However I accept that, from the nature of his employment as a sales engineer, I\n\ncan infer that the 1stDefendant knew the 2ndPlaintiffs' prices for\n\ntheir bellows. I also accept that the information on prices is confidential information.\n\nHowever there is no evidence of disclosure by the 1stDefendant to the 2ndDefendants. Of course the information is inside the 1stDefendants' head and he\n\nis capable of memorising it. As he is the person behind the 2ndDefendants it\n\nwould be a simple matter for him to use it. However at the very least, there should be\n\nevidence that the 1stDefendant had made use of his knowledge of the 2ndPlaintiffs' prices, whether by way of undercutting his former employer or in any other\n\nmanner. The plaintiffs had access to the 2ndDefendants' documents through the\n\npre-trial discovery process and yet no evidence is adduced on how the 2ndDefendants priced their products. Indeed the 1stDefendant had given evidence\n\nthat he priced his products according to what the market could bear, it being a quite\n\nimperfect market. I therefore cannot find that the 1stDefendant had disclosed\n\nthe 2ndPlaintiffs' confidential information relating to prices to the 2ndDefendants.4. Conclusion87. I have no doubt that the 1stDefendant had made use of\n\ninformation from the plaintiffs in constructing the Defendants' machine. In all\n\nlikelihood, he had used either the engineering drawings based on which the Plaintiffs'\n\nmachine was built - and which were not exhibited by the plaintiffs - or he had somehow\n\ntaken the dimensions off the Plaintiffs' machine. The difficulty faced by the plaintiffs\n\nis to prove exactly what he had used. However the plaintiffs' problem is not\n\ninsurmountable. They could simply have exhibited the engineering drawings of their machine\n\nand proved that copyright subsists and that they are the owners. If the drawings do relate\n\nto their machine, and are not of a nature as would afford the defendants a defence under\n\nsection 69 of the Act, then I would have no difficulty in holding for the plaintiffs on\n\nthe question of infringement by indirect copying. It baffles me that they have chosen not\n\nto exhibit and prove copyright in the engineering drawings and instead used ABD81-96. Be\n\nthat as it may, I have to decide the case on the evidence before me and the plaintiffs\n\nhave to live with the consequences of their decision. As for their case in breach of the\n\nemployment contract, the lack of evidence was equally stark. But I suspect that their\n\nprimary complaint is in relation to the copyright infringement and this part of their\n\nclaim was only included for good measure.88. I accordingly dismiss the plaintiffs' claims against the defendants\n\nin their entirety. I will hear counsel on the question of costs.LEE SEIU KINJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERSUPREME COURTCopyright Â© Government of Singapore."
