        "The conviction": "12With regard to the 83 Packets, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had established the following elements of the offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA: (a)possessionof a controlled drug; (b)knowledgeof the nature of the drug; and (c) possession ofthe drug for thepurpose of traffickingwhich was notauthorised:52Foot Note 52×Prosecution’s Closing Submissions at para 21.seeMuhammadRidzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters[2014] 3 SLR 721 at [59]. 13First, the element of possession was established beyond contest. The 83 Packets were recovered from the Sin Ming Unit which the accused had rented, and the accused admitted that he had possession of the 83 Packets.53Foot Note 53×Transcript, Day 8, pp 56–57.He also did not challenge the HSA’s analysis that the 83 Packets collectively contained not less than 45.58g of diamorphine.54Foot Note 54×Transcript, Day 8, p 56. 14Second, it was also clear that the accused had known that the 83 Packets contained diamorphine. On the stand, the accused admitted to knowing that the substance which he had repacked into the 83 Packetswasheroin55Foot Note 55×Transcript, Day 8, pp 3 and 7.because the people who passed him thebatustold him so.56Foot Note 56×Transcript, Day 7, p 26; Transcript, Day 8, p 58.Although the accused was unaware that heroin was a street name for diamorphine,57Foot Note 57×Transcript, Day 8, p 58.I agreed with the Prosecution that this was not an obstacle to a finding of knowledge on the accused’s part:58Foot Note 58×Prosecution’s Closing Submissions at paras 36–38.seeNagaenthrana/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor[2011] 4 SLR 1156 at [23]–[24]. 15Third, the accused had undoubtedly possessed the 83 Packets for the purpose of trafficking without authorisation. The lack of authorisation was not (and could not be) challenged by the Defence.59Foot Note 59×Transcript, Day 8, p 60.As for purpose, under s 2 of the MDA: “traffic” means — (a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or (b) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a), otherwise than under the authority of this Act, and “trafficking” has a corresponding meaning. 16The accused admitted that he was given instructions to deliver the diamorphine to various people60Foot Note 60×P72 in Statements of the Accused at p 211, paras 35–37.and that the diamorphine was for “selling”.61Foot Note 61×P70 in Statements of the Accused pp 177–178, paras 2–5.He said in his contemporaneous statement as follows:62Foot Note 62×P67 in Statements of the Accused at p 119. Q8 All the heroin claimed by you that you say is heroin were meant for what purpose? AnsFor delivery. Q9 For delivery to who? AnsFor my customers. [emphasis added] 17It was therefore patent that the accused had intended to traffic in the 83 Packets and would have delivered the drugs as instructed. In any event, the accused’s possession of not less than 45.58g of diamorphine also triggered the presumption under s 17(c) of the MDA, which read: Presumption concerning trafficking 17. Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than — … (c) 2grammes of diamorphine; … whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation or mixture, shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose. 18The onus was thus on the accused to rebut the presumption on a balance of probabilities. However, apart from his assertions, he did not adduce any evidence to do so. While the accused agreed with the Prosecution that he was in possession of the 83 Packets, he disagreed that he had possessed them for the purposes of trafficking63Foot Note 63×Transcript, Day 8, p 58.or that he was a distributor of diamorphine for Siva.64Foot Note 64×Transcript, Day 8, pp 40–41.Such baseless denials were insufficient to rebut the presumption under s 17(c) of the MDA, given the overwhelming objective evidenceand the accused’s own admissions that he was only a mere courier65Foot Note 65×Transcript, Day 7, pp 7 and 10.helping to “send” the 83 Packets.66Foot Note 66×Transcript, Day 7, p 3. 19I therefore found that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA. Accordingly, I convicted the accused on the charge.",
        "The sentence": "20Pursuant to s 33(1) and the Second Schedule of the MDA, the accused faced the death sentence for trafficking in excess of 15g of diamorphine. The Defence did not contest that the elements of the offence were made out.67Foot Note 67×Transcript, Day 10, pp 2–3.Instead, the main issue on which the Defence sought the court’s determination was whether the accused had met the conditions of s33B(2)(a) of the MDA(“Courier Exception”).68Foot Note 68×Defence’s Closing Submissions at pp 5–7, paras 1–5.In other words, the principal finding sought by the Defence was whether the accused’s role was that of a mere courier. 21Under s 33B of the MDA, an accused who had been convicted of an offence under s 5(1) and who faced the death sentence may instead be sentenced to life imprisonment and caning of not less than 15 strokes if the requirements of s 33B(2) were met. The requirements were as follows: (a) the person convicted proves, on a balance of probabilities, that his involvement in the offence under section 5(1) or 7 was restricted — (i) to transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug; (ii) to offering to transport, send or deliver a controlled drug; (iii) to doing or offering to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of his transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug; or (iv) to any combination of activities in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii); and (b) the Public Prosecutor certifies to any court that, in his determination, the person has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. 22In short, there were two requirements that had to be satisfied before the accused could avoid the death sentence. First, the accused had to show on a balance of probabilities that he fell within the Courier Exception because his involvement was restricted to the acts set out under s 33B(2)(a). Second, the Public Prosecutor must certify under s 33B(2)(b) that he had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities (“Certificate of Substantive Assistance”). Both requirements must be satisfied, and the issue of whether an offender was a mere courier under s 33B(2)(a) was distinct from whether he had rendered substantive assistance to the CNB: seePublic Prosecutor vChristeen d/o Jayamany and another[2015] SGHC 126 (“Christeen”) at [46]. 23I begin by first setting out the law on the Courier Exception. InPublic Prosecutor v Chum TatSuan and another[2015] 1 SLR 834 (“Chum TatSuan”) at [63]–[66], the Court of Appeal noted that Parliament intended for the Courier Exception to apply only invery narrow circumstanceswhere the offender’s involvement was limited to “transporting, sending or delivering the drugs”. Hence, acts such as packing of drugs would bring the offender out of the Courier Exception. The Court of Appeal explained as followsat [68]: …packing is not a necessary element of moving an object from one point to another.Simply put, a courier is someone who receives the drugs and transmits them inexactly the same formin which they were received without any alteration or adulteration. [emphasis added] Ultimately, however, “whether an offender [was] a courier necessarily involve[d] a highly fact-specific inquiry”: seePublic Prosecutor vRanjit Singh Gill Menjeet Singh and another[2017] 3 SLR 66 (“RanjitSingh”) at [58]. 24In this regard, I was referred toChristeen, which provided invaluable guidance at [68]–[73] on the key factors to consider when determining whether an offender was a mere courier. These non-exhaustive factors could be distilled as follows: (a)Was the role a common and ordinary incident of transporting, sending or delivering a drug?To qualify as a mere courier, an offender must not have been involved in “any other type of activity associated with drug supply and distribution”: seeSingapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(9 July 2012)vol 89 (Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs).Thus, acts ofstorage or safekeepingdid not bring an offender out of the Courier Exception if such acts were merely incidental to the transporting of the drugs: seeChristeenat [68(a)] and [69]. (b)Were such acts necessary to deliver the drugs?This would involve considering the degree to which the drugs werealteredand the extent to which an offender’s involvementlooked beyond his immediate recipient of the drugs. Hence, an offender would not be a mere courier if his acts ofpackingwere not necessary to move the drugs from point A to point B: seeChristeenat [68(b)] and [70]. (c)What was the extent in scope and time of the functions which the offender performed?An offender who had numerous functions going beyond transportation over an extensive period of time was less likely to be a mere courier than an offender who performed such functions on a one-off basis: seeChristeenat [68(c)] and [71]. (d)What was the degree of executive decision-making powers given to the offender?An offender who intended toselldrugs for profit and who had the ability to make executive decisions was not a mere courier. In contrast, an offender who could exercise no discretion and could only carry out instructions given to him was more likely to be within the Courier Exception:seeChristeenat [68(d)] and [72]. (e)Did the offender receive a distinct form of benefit for performing his extra functions?An offender who regularly performed extra functions and was rewarded for such functions was more likely to fall outside the Courier Exception:seeChristeenat [68(e)] and [73]. 25With the above considerations in mind, I examined the accused’s “involvement in the offence” (see s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA) of trafficking in the 83 Packets. 26The Defence urged me to find that the accused was a mere courier within the meaning of s 33B(2)(a) because the accused onlyhad the intention todeliver(as opposed tosell) the 83 Packets.69Foot Note 69×Defence’s Closing Submissions at p 18, paras 32-33.Presumably, the Defence was attempting to overcome the holding inChum TatSuanat [62] that an offender was not merely a courier if he had the intent to sell controlled drugs.70Foot Note 70×Transcript, Day 10, p 10; Prosecution’s Closing Submissions at para 45.To this end, the Defence challenged the accuracy of the recording done by CNB officer Nicholas Quah Chee Fook (“Quah”) with the aid of an interpreter, Mr Mohammad Farhan Bin Sani (“Farhan”). In view of the parties’ decision to confine their submissions only to evidence relating to the 83 Packets, my analysis is similarly restricted to references in the statements with regard to the 83 Packets.  There were multiple instances of the word “sell” in P70 suggesting that the accused had intended to sell the 83 Packets. P70 also recorded the accused as having stated that “[a]ll the heroin recovered from [the] black sling bag belongs to [him] and is meant forselling”[emphasis added].71Foot Note 71×P70 in Statements of the Accused at p 177, para 2.Levelling two main arguments, the Defence challenged the accuracy of the instances where the word “sell” or its different forms appeared. 27First, the Defence submitted that the accused did not tell Quah or Farhan that he had intended to sell the drugs, and that “[t]he words ‘sell’ [and] ‘sold’ were misunderstood and/or misconstrued by [Farhan]”.72Foot Note 72×Defence’s Closing Submissions at pp 18–19, paras 33–34.It was alleged that Farhan had incorrectly interpreted the Malay words “menghantar” (which means “deliver”) and “menjual” (which means “sell”).73Foot Note 73×Transcript, Day 4, p 64.The accused also gave evidence that he did not use the words “sell” or “sold”. Instead, according to the accused, he only said that he would send the diamorphine and collect money.74Foot Note 74×Transcript, Day 6, p 54. 28Second, relying on the “Interpreter’s Notes” taken by Farhan during and after the recording of P70,75Foot Note 75×Transcript, Day 4, p 52.the Defence averred that the accused was prevented from clarifying in his statements that he did not intend to sell the diamorphine.76Foot Note 76×Defence’s Closing Submissions at p 19, para 35.The notes indicated that the accused had informed Farhan that “he did not have the intention to sell and was only helping to send the drugs” (“the Exculpatory Statement”).77Foot Note 77×P152 at note dated 23 June 2014.The Exculpatory Statement was made after the recording of P70,78Foot Note 78×Transcript, Day 4, p 16.and it was the Defence’s position that Quah had deprived the accused of a chance to clarify by failing to take an additional statement immediately.79Foot Note 79×Defence’s Closing Submissions at p 19, para 35. 29In my judgment, the accused had intended to use the word “sell” (or its different forms) where it had been so recorded. I found that the contention that the accused’s words were incorrectly interpreted and recorded was incredible and self-serving. To begin with, the Defence could not show that Quah or Farhan had any reason to incriminate the accused, and the accused also admitted that he did not know Quah or Farhan prior to his arrest.80Foot Note 80×Transcript, Day 8, pp 45–46.On the contrary, the fact that Farhan recorded the Exculpatory Statement in the Interpreter’s Notes showed that he had no motive to incriminate the accused and that he was dutifully carrying out his role as an interpreter. I also disagreed with the Defence’s submission that the accused was prevented from clarifying what he had said. Both Quah and Farhan testified that the accused was informed that he could make the necessary clarifications in his further statements.81Foot Note 81×Transcript, Day 4, pp 10 and 63.This fact was also recorded in Farhan’s Interpreter’s Notes.82Foot Note 82×P152 at note dated 23 June 2014.Accordingly, the Defence’s contentions were far-fetched, and it was always open to the accused to make any necessary clarifications in his later statements. 30Putting aside deliberate acts, I also considered whether there could have been mistakes. Having heard and seen Farhan giving his testimony, I did not believe that he could have been mistaken about the two Malay words “menghantar” and “menjual”. These were common words that anyone familiar with the Malay language would have readilyknown and understood. Indeed, Farhan was unequivocal in his position that he understood both words, and that they did not have any other possible meanings.83Foot Note 83×Transcript, Day 5, p 25.I did not doubt his competence or veracity on this point. 31In the light of the foregoing, including considering the Exculpatory Statement, I found that the accused had deliberately used the word “sell” (or its other forms) as recorded, indicating how he had perceived his role.  I should add that even if I had taken into account references in the statements with regard to the Collateral Evidence, my conclusions on this issue would have remained unchanged. In any case, the accused’s choice of words in his statements was not determinative of the issue of whether he was a mere courier on our facts. Ultimately, the court still had to decide, on a holistic assessment of the facts, whether the accused’s involvement in the offence was restricted to the acts set out under s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA. 32Certainly, while the Defence harped on the question of whether the accused had intended to “sell” the 83 Packets or whether he would have merelydeliveredthem andcollectedmoney (seeChristeenat [72]and [77]),84Foot Note 84×Defence’s Closing Submissions at pp 18–21, paras 32–37 andpp 22–23, para 43; Transcript, Day 10, p 8.this issue was overshadowed by the fact that he had repacked the 83 Packets. The accused’s act of repacking turned out to be the decisive point on the question of whether he met the conditions of the Courier Exception. 33In this regard, recalling the considerations inChum TatSuanandChristeenas canvassed above at[23]–[24], alongside the principle that an offender’s act must be assessed cumulatively (seeChristeenat [87]),I noted that the accused had been arrested with a digital weighing scale and numerous empty plastic packets.85Foot Note 85×P70 in Statements of the Accused at p 178, para 5.These were paraphernalia used by the accused to weigh and repack the twobatus, and his statement set out in detail how hehad actually repacked them:86Foot Note 86×P72 in Statements of the Accused at p 212, paras 38–42. I then took out the digital weighing scale and started repacking the heroin. I had opened up 2 ‘batu’ and repack it into 90 smaller packets of heroin. I had a remaining half ‘batu’ which I had used a black sticky tape to tape up the plastic packet so as to prevent the heroin from spilling out. … I then place [sic] 10 packets of heroin into one white envelope. I had a total of 9 white envelopes each containing 10 packets of heroin. … All the heroin that I had surrendered from the unit #09-138 was packed by me. … 34In submitting that the accused was a mere courier, the Defence argued that not all instances of repacking would preclude an offender from falling within the Courier Exception.87Foot Note 87×Defence’s Closing Submissions at pp 16–18, paras 24–31; Transcript, Day 10, pp 20–21.However, in my view it was clear from the case authorities that acts of repacking had to benecessary fororincidental tothedelivery (and other statutory acts)if the accused were to be a mere courier: seeChum TatSuanat [68];RanjitSinghat [64]; andChristeenat [68]. In this regard,RanjitSinghwas especially instructive given its close similarities with thepresent case. Therein, the second accused (“Farid”) was charged for possessing 35.21g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. Weighing scales and empty plastic bags were found in Farid’s rented apartment, which Farid had intended to use to repackage the diamorphine into smaller packets each containing 7.7–7.9g of the drug. In rejecting Farid’s submission that such acts of repacking were that of a mere courier, the High Court found that Farid’s role of weighing and repacking the drugs “was essentially a matter of convenience forfacilitating distribution or sale; it was not necessary for or incidental to enabling the drugs to be transported”[emphasis added] (at [64]). The High Court therefore imposed the mandatory death sentence on Farid. 35The facts ofRanjitSinghwere much like those in the present case, and in the circumstances, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused fell outside the Courier Exception.88Foot Note 88×Prosecution’s Closing Submissions at para 48.It was apparent from the above facts that one of his core functions was toweighandrepackthebatusinto small packets after he had collected them from the drug suppliers.  As the Prosecution highlighted, the accused’s act of repacking had substantially altered the form of the drugs.89Foot Note 89×Transcript, Day 10, p 33.Such repacking was neither necessary for nor incidental to the acts listed under s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA. Instead, one could fairly describe what the accused did as “breaking bulk” for his suppliers. Certainly, the twobatuswere broken down into small packets of retail size, and this act of repacking was done “essentially [as] a matter of convenience for facilitatingdistribution or sale” [emphasis added]: seeRanjitSinghat [64]. In my view, this formulation inRanjitSinghwas most apposite forthe present case. It applieda fortiorito the present case given that the accused hadalreadyrepacked thediamorphine unlike Farid inRanjitSinghwho had notactually repacked the diamorphine at the time of his arrest. 36With regard to the contention that the accused was merely carrying out Siva’s and the drug suppliers’ instructions and had no executive decision-making powers (seeChristeenat [68(d)] and [72]),90Foot Note 90×Defence’s Closing Submissions at pp 15–16, para 23 and pp 20–21, para 37; Transcript, Day 10, p 5.I was of the view that this was insufficient to show that the accused was a mere courier. While I accepted that the lack of executive discretion was a relevant indicator (see [24(d)] above), this was only one of the many factors which the court had to consider. As was the case inRanjitSingh, even if an offender was acting on instructions, “the fact that his role with regard to the offence charged would have included non-incidental repacking was sufficient to show that he was not a mere courier” (at [65]). Therefore, given my finding that the accused’s repacking of thediamorphine was not necessary for or incidental to the transporting, sending, delivery, or the other acts under s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA,the fact that the accused was executing instructions did not change the conclusion that he was not a mere courier: seeRanjitSinghat [65]. 37In conclusion, based on a common sense reading of the MDA and the guidance of the relevant precedents, the facts led me inescapably to the finding that the accused was not a mere courier. This wasa fortioriwhen theMDA placed the burden on the Defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the accused was a mere courier.  In this connection, it ought to be mentioned that even if the Collateral Evidence had been considered, it would not have made a difference to my finding bearing in mind that the accused had already repacked the drugs in our case. 38Finally, the Defence also sought to impugn the Prosecution’s decision not to issue a Certificate of Substantive Assistance under s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA. However, aside from assertions that the Prosecution had not been transparent in its refusal to issue a Certificate of Substantive Assistance, the Defence did not adduce any evidence to suggest that the Prosecution had acted without propriety.91Foot Note 91×Defence’s Closing Submissions at pp 28–29, paras 1–4.I therefore dismissed the Defence’s challenge for want of merit. In any event, this issue was ultimately immaterial to the sentence, as acknowledged by the Defence, in the light of my finding that the accused fell outside the Courier Exception. 39In the premises, I imposed the mandatory sentence of death.
