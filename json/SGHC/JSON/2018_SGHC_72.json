        "Medical evidence": "28 The Defence argued that the lack of physical injuries militated against a finding of sexual assaults. I acknowledged that there were no physical injuries. However, I was not convinced that this was fatal to the Prosecution’s case. Dr Tan testified that the absence of injuries on the Victim did not mean that she had not been sexually assaulted67Foot Note 67×Transcript, Day 6, pp 4–5 and 27.and satisfactorily explained why this could be so.68Foot Note 68×Transcript, Day 6, p 5.Separately, the Defence’s own expert, Associate Professor Peter George Manning (“AP Manning”), conceded that he could not, based on the medical evidence, conclude “withconfidencewhether or not sexual intercourse took place between [the Victim] and the [A]ccused” [emphasis added].69Foot Note 69×D3, para 23; Transcript, Day 14, p 53.AP Manning’s opinion of theunlikelihoodof any occurrence of sexual assault70Foot Note 70×DCS, paras 105–110.was based on his view that Dr Tan had not documented that the Victim suffered any tenderness,71Foot Note 71×Transcript, Day 14, p 44.or in his words, the absence of “appropriate documentation”,72Foot Note 72×Transcript, Day 14, p 48.or “documentation that is insufficient”.73Foot Note 73×Transcript, Day 14, p 53.AP Manning fairly conceded that he would “think twice” about his opinion if there were some documentation of tenderness.74Foot Note 74×Transcript, Day 14, p 54. 29 The Defence also took issue with the fact that the Victim had not verbalised any pain or discomfort to Dr Tan during her medical examination after the incident.75Foot Note 75×DCS, para 99.I accepted the Victim’s evidence that she wasexperiencingpain during the medical examination but did not convey this to Dr Tan.76Foot Note 76×Transcript, Day 3, p 51.I also noted that she felt embarrassed during the examination.77Foot Note 77×Transcript, Day 3, pp 46, 56–57.This accorded with Dr Tan’s observations of the Victim as being “reticent” and “rather reserved” during the examination because Dr Tan thought that the Victim probably felt “very upset and embarrassed” after what had happened.78Foot Note 78×Transcript, Day 6, p 3.The Prosecution also suggested, based on the evidence of Dr Tan,79Foot Note 79×Transcript, Day 6, p 49.that different victims may have different pain thresholds.80Foot Note 80×Transcript, 14 March 2018, p 13. The Accused’s intoxicated state 30 The Defence cited Dr Derrick Yeo Chen Kuan’s (“Dr Yeo”) testimony81Foot Note 81×DCS, para 118.and relied on the intoxicated state of the Accused to say that it was “more likely than not” that the Accused would have suffered some impairment to his muscle coordination and balance such that it was “highly improbable” that he would have been able to carry out the acts as the Victim had claimed.82Foot Note 82×DCS, para 119. 31 I was not persuaded by this argument for several reasons. First, considering the materiality of this contention, the Accused did not give evidence in court to such effect. Indeed, the Accused did not report to Dr Yeo of having “incoordination or motor problems after his drinking session”.83Foot Note 83×Transcript, Day 15, p 22.Ironically, it was the Accused’s own admission that he could hold his liquor very well.84Foot Note 84×Transcript, Day 7, pp 69–70; see also Transcript, Day 15, pp 21–22. 32 Second, Dr Yeo’s diagnosis was based essentially on the Accused’s self-reporting.85Foot Note 85×Transcript, Day 15, p 8.Dr Yeo also testified that it was difficult to comment on whether a seasoned drinker would have any or some of the features of acute alcohol intoxication,86Foot Note 86×Transcript, Day 15, p 22.such as impaired muscle coordination and balance. 33 Third, the Victim’s evidence was that the Accused forced himself on her even though he was drunk.87Foot Note 87×Transcript, Day 2, p 30.Last, the Accused was much younger and stronger than the Victim and I could not believe that he was prevented from committing the offences because of his alcohol consumption. Lack of corroboration by family members 34 The Defence submitted that the Victim’s version of the events was not corroborated by the evidence provided by the Victim’s family members given that the precise words in describing the sexual offences were not articulated and the key aspects of the sexual offences were not disclosed to them.88Foot Note 88×DCS, paras 120–132. 35 I found that this was an exercise by the Defence in splitting hairs. As noted by theamicus, Ms Tan Li Jen (“Ms Tan”), it was typical that victims of sexual assault would not be able to verbalise every detail of the assaults.89Foot Note 89×Transcript, Day 17, pp 38–39; see also PCS, paras 79–91 and Amicus Brief (“P52”), paras 18–20.In referencing Ms Tan’s expert opinion, I admitted her evidence with respect to rape myths and on rape victims generally, which I relied upon where relevant as discussed in this Grounds of Decision. In doing so, I was cognisant of the recent pronouncement by the Court of Appeal inPublic Prosecutor v MohdAriffan bin Mohd Hassan[2018] SGCA 10 (in the context of adduction of further evidence on appeal) that a psychological expert’s opinion with respect to the specific victim ought not to be considered where the expert had not personally interviewed the victim and had an incomplete picture of the facts (at [98]). Ms Tan likewise had no opportunity to interview the Victim or her family members and as such I had not relied on her opinion of this specific Victim in my reasoning. 36 Returning to the issue of corroboration, I found that the Victim would naturally have felt distressed and embarrassed at having to disclose details of the offences to her family members. Whilst the Victim gave inconsistent evidence on the issue of whether she told her family members that she was raped,90Foot Note 90×Transcript, Day 3, pp 19 and 32.the Victim maintained consistently that she never went into the precise details with her family members because she was too embarrassed about the incident.91Foot Note 91×Transcript, Day 1, pp 80–81; Transcript, Day 3, pp 25–26 and 30–32.Any expected disclosure92Foot Note 92×DCS, para 131.must also be seen in the light of the specific victim here, who was a conservative, religious and illiterate lady in her fifties. 37 Despite the lack of details conveyed by the Victim to her family members, taking their evidence as a whole, I found that their evidence provided corroboration of the Victim’s account. All of them unanimously testified that the Victim was visibly shaken and genuinely distraught when she spoke to them, just hours after the incident.93Foot Note 93×Transcript, Day 4, pp 5 and 43–44.In particular, the eldest daughter-in-law recounted that the Victim was“crying very badly, like a little girl. I have never seen her crying this badly”.94Foot Note 94×PS16, paras 4 and 6; Transcript, Day 4, p 3.Further, the eldest daughter-in-law testified that the Victim had said to her that, “Boy want to fuck me”.95Foot Note 95×Transcript, Day 4, p 8.The Victim’s utterance of the actual word representing sexual intercourse out of desperation because the eldest daughter-in-law was not conversant in Malay,96Foot Note 96×Transcript, Day 4, p 5.answered the Defence’s argument (at [34] above) and indicated that the Accused had sexual intercourse with the Victim. No attempt by the Victim to escape 38 The Defence argued that it was “illogical” and “improbable” that the Victim did not scream or shout for help at various points during the ordeal, and was willing to just lie and sleep on the bed without attempting to escape even while the Accused was in the shower.97Foot Note 97×DCS, paras 148–160. 39 In my judgment, this assessment failed to recognise that such rational and logical reactions would only appear with the benefit of hindsight. As noted by Ms Tan, “passive responses” are quite common amongst rape victims and factors such as “power disparity” and “perception of threat” may influence a victim’s responses during the incident.98Foot Note 98×P52, paras 9–13.The Prosecution urged the court to view the Victim’s behaviour and evidence through a “trauma-informed lens”.99Foot Note 99×PCS, para 14.On the present facts, I was prepared to find that the Victim was stunned and horrified by the entire incident and needed some time to formulate the least risky course of action. There was no standard “reasonable” yardstick to judge the responses of rape victims and each case had to be decided on its specific facts. 40  In the present case, one had to consider the effect of fear on the Victim and her calculation that reacting and escaping might antagonise the Accused further.100Foot Note 100×Transcript, Day 2, pp 34–35.The Victim also did not try to use her phone to reach the police as she was afraid of her son.101Foot Note 101×Transcript, Day 3, pp 40–41.Notably, the Victim testified,“I love him, butI fear him too.” [emphasis added].102Foot Note 102×Transcript, Day 2, p 19, line 29.In the circumstances, the Victim only sought to escape at an hour which would not have raised the Accused’s suspicions to avoid any further repercussions. The Victim’s behaviour was consistent with my finding that the Victim had a passive personality. The fact that she left the house one hour earlier (at 6.00am instead of the usual 7.00am) also signified a heightened level of urgency and need to escape from the Accused. 41 Lastly, the Victim explained that she did not leave the Flat while the Accused was showering because she needed to perform her ablutions (she wanted to bathe to cleanse her body) in order to carry out her daily morning prayers.103Foot Note 103×Transcript, Day 1, p 64; Transcript, Day 3, pp 59–60.She explained that she would not be able to get out of the house if she had not showered before.104Foot Note 104×Transcript, Day 2, p 38.I accepted this explanation given how important her religion was to her life.105Foot Note 105×Transcript, Day 1, p 65. Motive to frame the Accused 42 The Defence attempted to impute possible motives to explain the Victim’s desire for the Accused to be prosecuted. The Defence disparaged the Victim by saying that she was “not a loving and compassionate mother”.106Foot Note 106×DCS, paras 164–165.The Accused testified that when he was just 15 years old, the Victim had turned the Accused away when he sought motherly care and attention from her (“Past Incident”).107Foot Note 107×Transcript, Day 7, pp 63–64.Based on this, the fact that the Accused was a troublemaker at home by virtue of his drug and alcohol consumption, and the claim that there was bad blood between the Accused and the Husband, the Defence asserted that the Victim had fabricated the rape as she could not tolerate the Accused’s behaviour anymore, and her evidence to the police was thus a ruse to chase him out of the Flat.108Foot Note 108×DCS, paras 217–228. 43 I agreed with the Prosecution that the Past Incident was not put to the Victim during her testimony in accordance with the rule inBrowne v Dunn(1893) 6 R 67 (“Browne v Dunn”). Instead, it was only volunteered by the Accused in his examination-in-chief.109Foot Note 109×PCS, para 208.In any event, reliance on the Past Incident as evidence of motive was wholly insufficient. 44 As for the Defence’s argument that the Victim had fabricated the rape to chase the Accused out of the Flat, I found that this was an unreal proposition – it would have been wholly disproportionate for a biological mother to accuse her own son of rape just to achieve that purpose. Whilst mother and son may have their quarrels, I did not see anything that would impel the Victim to undertake such a drastic and devious course of action. In fact, on 3 October 2013, both of them had gone out together to meet the Husband and their relationship appeared normal and cordial.110Foot Note 110×Transcript, Day 7, p 69.The Accused had also been consistently paying rent on a monthly basis of at least $300.111Foot Note 111×Transcript, Day 7, p 66.The argument that the Victim had fabricated the rape also underestimated how embarrassing it would be for the Victim to express such allegations and follow through with the charade.112Foot Note 112×PCS, para 147.If the Victim wished the Accused to leave her Flat, she or her Husband113Foot Note 113×Transcript, Day 4, p 27.could have reported the Accused to the authorities for consuming drugs or simply turned to her family members to convince him to leave, instead of going down a path where she would have to keep up the lie for as long as the investigations took, undergo stressful and embarrassing investigations, invasive medical procedures and court proceedings.114Foot Note 114×PCS, para 147.Most pertinently, by the time the Audio Recording was made, the Accused had already informed the Victim that he was willing to leave the Flat.115Foot Note 115×Audio Recording (“P36”) at 03.40.He did not appear to resist the idea of leaving the Flat. Given the above, there was to my mind no extant reason for the Victim to continue (based on the Defence’s argument) to allege that the Accused had sexually assaulted her. 45 To round up on all the Defence’s arguments above, if there were unusual features in relation to timings, lapses of memories and aspects of the Victim’s behaviour, I noted as a general observation that this was an unusual case to begin with. While the Defence left no stone unturned, highlighting every conceivable shortcoming, in challenging the Prosecution’s case, it must be reiterated that the Defence’s mainstay was to establish the fact that the offences never took place – the Accused’s case was that nothing happened save for the Lifting of the blouse. This defence was positively and thoroughly debunked when the totality of the evidence weighed in, including specifically the following. Incriminating evidence against the Accused 46 In my judgment, I found that there was more than sufficient corroboration as well as evidence to support a conviction on the Charges based,inter alia, on the following: (a) the Audio Recording; (b) the Accused’s statements made on the day of the incident (P45 and P46); and (c) my finding that the Accused was not a witness of truth. 47 These interlocking and mutually reinforcing points led to an irrefutable inference and finding of guilt. Not one of the Defence’s arguments was able to cast any doubt on the Accused’s guilt. Audio Recording 48 The most damning piece of evidence, which also corroborated the Victim’s evidence, was none other than the Audio Recording. This was a contemporaneous recording of the telephone conversation (undisputed by the Accused)116Foot Note 116×Transcript, Day 8, pp 19–20.between the Victim and the Accused on the morning following the incident. As explained by the Victim (see [13] above), after parting from the Accused and alighting from the bus three bus stops before her usual bus stop, she headed to a void deck and called the Accused on one of her mobile phones, and then used another mobile phone to record this conversation.117Foot Note 117×Transcript, Day 1, p 76–77. 49 The Victim’s explanation as to why she had recorded the conversation was simply the fear that “no one would believe [her]” if she had said that her son had raped her.118Foot Note 118×Transcript, Day 1, p 77.In my view, this need to gather proof was intensified in the Victim because of her age and relationship to the Accused. The embarrassment and shame for someone in her position could not be understated. 50 There was no doubt to my mind that the Audio Recording was highly probative of the Accused’s guilt. 51 First, the Accused had never rebutted the Victim each time references were made by her to the specific incident that morning. The Defence emphasised that the Victim did not expressly use the precise word “rape” but instead used the word “kacau” (which translated to mean “disturb” in Malay) in describing the incident, and therefore the Accused had not confessed to the sexual assaults.119Foot Note 119×DCS, paras 204 and 208.However, a careful examination of the actual contents of the Audio Recording demonstrated that this argument was flawed. 52 The Victim’s own descriptions strongly pointed to rape and acts which were forced upon her, as follows [emphasis added]: (a)  “Why did you come anddisturbme”;120Foot Note 120×P36 at 00.40. (b) “Why youforceme”;121Foot Note 121×P36 at 03.58.and (c) “With me you want tosleeplike this”.122Foot Note 122×P36 at 05.31. 53 Other statements plainly manifested that the acts involved were of an amorous and sexual nature [emphasis added]: (a) “I love you as my son.You love me in a different way.” The Accused, instead of denying this disturbing statement, simply said, “now you want the whole world to know”.123Foot Note 123×P36 at 02.16. (b) “Why? There are a lot of women there you came to me and you disturb me. Why?”124Foot Note 124×P36 at 02.51. (c) “I cannot, I have a husband”. The Accused responded by saying, “You divorce him first”.125Foot Note 125×P36 at 01.39 to 01.43. (d) “My [H]usband do me like this, you do this to me”.126Foot Note 126×P36 at 02.05. (e) “You are my son, you know,not my boyfriend. You are my son”.127Foot Note 127×P36 at 03.09. (f) “[I] remember everything Mother. I didn’t forget. I remember … I like, I want again”.128Foot Note 128×P36 at 00.33. Given these statements, I found that the use of the word “kacau” instead of “rape” did not blunt the probative force of the Audio Recording. The Defence’s arguments premised on the possible literal meanings of “kacau”129Foot Note 129×DCS, paras 191–207; Transcript, 14 March 2018, pp 7–8.were entirely artificial. Moreover, at trial, the Victim was plainly uncomfortable with usingexplicitlanguage, especially when pressed to describe the incident in detail. Hence, the fact that she did not use the precise word “rape” in the Audio Recording was consistent with this. 54 Second, I found that there was palpable emotional distress in the Victim’s voice on the phone which confirmed that she was very emotionally distraught by what had happened to her in the morning. She was struggling with her feelings even as she was trying to find the words. This level of distress was also observed by the family members whom the Victim had approached after the incident.130Foot Note 130×Transcript, Day 1, pp 79–81; Transcript, Day 4, pp 5, 45 and 57.The Defence’s argument that the Audio Recording was a calculated tactic by the Victim to concoct proof of an alleged rape implied a vengeful and sophisticated lady who would have planned this meticulously down to the tee and executed this with first class acting in the Audio Recording, in front of her family members, and in court. I found that the Victim, who appeared to be obviously still struggling with the trauma of the incident, was incapable of such a level of cunning or textured behaviour, all of which (the Defence argued) was to achieve the goal of ensuring that the Accused would leave the Flat. 55 Third, the Accused sought to explain away the Audio Recording by arguing that the conversation was mainly about the Lifting of the blouse. Notably, such an important plank of his defence was never raised in P45 and P46, the statements taken on the day of his arrest. After listening to the Audio Recording, which was played in court in full on four separate occasions,131Foot Note 131×Transcript, Day 1, p 85; Transcript, Day 4, pp 46 and 57; Transcript, Day 5, p 4.the Accused must have heard the Victim mention a past occasion concerning pulling up her skirt.132Foot Note 132×P36 at 0.40 and 00.51.The Accused also realised that his initial defence that “nothing happened that morning” was hopeless. He had to come up with some incident that could explain away what happened in the morning that: (a) was not denied by the Accused; (b) both the Victim and the Accused were aware of; (c) caused the Victim tremendous distress; and (d) was shameful when broadcasted to the world. In fact, it was obvious that this was the first time he adopted this position. He even took his own counsel by surprise given that the Lifting of the blouse was never put to the Victim; all that was put to the Victim was that nothing happened that night.133Foot Note 133×Transcript, Day 3, pp 52–53.I thus agreed with the Prosecution that this was all a belated afterthought.134Foot Note 134×PCS, para 131. 56 The Defence’s argument that the Accused had mentioned the Lifting of the blouse earlier in the Audio Recording was totally off the mark and anon sequitur. In my judgment, I found that the Victim’s reference to the pulling up of the skirt in the Audio Recording was only made as a prelude to what she really wanted to confront the Accused about – which were the sexual assaults that had happened that early morning. 57 Further, the contents of the Audio Recording (as stated at [52(b)] and [52(c)] above) which referred to forcing the Victim and sleeping with the Victim, firmly put paid to any suggestion that the conversation was about the Lifting of the blouse. 58 The Accused was also exceptionally concerned about what his mother would tell other people about the incident.135Foot Note 135×P36 at 04.58I found that his concern was unduly disproportionate if all he had done was the Lifting of the blouse. 59 I also agreed with the Prosecution’s arguments that the explanations provided by the Accused to the Audio Recording were not exculpatory and were in fact incredible:136Foot Note 136×PCS, para 124. (a) The Accused explained that his comment “I like, I want again” in the Audio Recording137Foot Note 137×P36 at 00.33.was a “sarcastic” remark in relation to having cursed the Victim at the Coffee Shop.138Foot Note 138×Transcript, Day 8, pp 24–27; DCS, paras 190 and 192.This explanation was a fabrication and clearly contradicted by the entire context of the conversation.139Foot Note 139×P36 at 00.40 and 01.32. (b) The Accused initially claimed that the Victim was describing emotional, non-bodily pain in their conversation.140Foot Note 140×P36 at 01.21 and 01.28; Transcript, Day 8, pp 28–29.However, he later admitted that the word “sakit” in the Audio Recording referred to physical pain.141Foot Note 141×Transcript, Day 8, p 29. (c) The Accused explained that he did not make a denial when the Victim accused him of “sleeping” with her because he wanted to confront her in person.142Foot Note 142×Transcript, Day 8, p 46.However, this was contradicted by the subsequent exchange of words between them, in particular, where he inexplicably expressed “I am the one who should be embarrassed not you [ie, the Victim]”.143Foot Note 143×P36 at 05.43 to 06.05. The Accused’s Statements 60 Apart from the Audio Recording, the Victim’s evidence and the Accused’s accounts detailed in P45 and P46 were consistent (save for the issue of consent) in the relevant aspects, and confirmed the specific acts of masturbation, kissing, sucking of breasts and sexual intercourse. The uncanny similarities led to the inference that far from his claim that nothing had occurred, the Accused was narrating in his statements what had transpired that morning (leaving aside the issue of consent). 61  The Accused said that he fabricated the account in P45 based on a pornographic show he had watched: “the porn style version”.144Foot Note 144×Transcript, Day 13, p 50.However, I found that this was patently untruthful, as it assumed the ludicrous coincidence that the Victim had also watched the same pornographic show.145Foot Note 145×PCS, para 137. 62 I also accepted DSP Burhan’s unchallenged evidence that during his interview with the Accused on 4 October 2013 – before the recording of P45 – the Accused had stated that “he wanted to apologise to [his] mother”. In particular, DSP Burhan testified that the Accused “was quite insistent on meeting [his] mother to apologise. He wanted to even kiss her feet.”146Foot Note 146×Transcript, Day 9, pp 9–11. The Accused was not a witness of truth 63 In my judgment, the Accused gave patently untruthful evidence on several aspects of the facts in issue both at trial and the ancillary proceedings. Some lies were outright and outrageous. At certain points his attempts at covering up were also blundering and transparent. As I had expatiated, a clear example was his abrupt claim, after asserting nothing had happened, that (only) the Lifting of the blouse had occurred that morning (see [55] above). This was one of the Accused’s three contradictory accounts of what had occurred on the day of the incident (see [17] above). Another instance was his explanation that parts of the Audio Recording related to the altercation with the Victim at the Coffee Shop (see [59(a)] above). A further example would be the Accused’s blatant lies regarding the number of medical examinations conducted by Dr Wong, the presence of the police officers and the alleged assaults in his effort to get out of his statements in P45 and P46. 64 In a desperate attempt to buttress his defence, the Accused even gave evidence that the Victim had smiled at him moments after the incident.147Foot Note 147×Transcript, Day 8, pp 49–50.However, the CCTV footage did not shore this up. 65 The Defence’s main response to these lies was that the Victim had also lied (summarised at Section 4 of the Defence’s Chart tendered to the court).148Foot Note 148×Transcript, 14 March 2018, p 8.The Prosecution had provided reasoned answers to explain why several of these allegations were neither lies nor constituted material inconsistencies.149Foot Note 149×PCS, paras 57–60.In any case, even if there were discrepancies, they were either not material or did not affect my assessment of the Victim’s credibility as an honest witness. For instance, the Defence harped on the fact that the Victim had testified that she had only three children when she in fact had four.150Foot Note 150×Transcript, 14 March 2018, p 8.This was easily explicable because one of her children had passed on long before the trial151Foot Note 151×Transcript, Day 2, pp 12–13.and her mind could have been focused on the children who were alive. Further, the Victim’s version of events was sufficiently corroborated by her family members, the Audio Recording and the Accused’s statements in P45 and P46 (save for the issue of consent). 66 For the foregoing reasons, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the Charges. Appropriate sentence 67 For the offence of rape in C2, following the guidelines set by the Court of Appeal inNg Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor[2017] 2 SLR 449 (“Terence Ng”) at [73], I found that the present case fell within Band 2 of the sentencing bands. Of the offence-specific aggravating factors highlighted by the Prosecution (breach of trust, severe harm to the Victim and deliberate infliction of special trauma by the Accused),152Foot Note 152×Transcript, 14 March 2018, pp 33–36.I found that two factors were present in this case: (1) breach of trust by the Accusedvis-à-vishis own mother and (2) harm caused to the Victim (Terence Ngat [44]). The first offence-specific aggravating factor of breach of trust was not disputed by the Defence.153Foot Note 153×Transcript, 14 March 2018, p 44. 68 A related factor was that this case would and did shock the conscience of the community, raising the issue of public disquiet. The very offences against his own biological mother boggled the mind. As the Prosecution put it: “We could label it as depraved, unfathomable, unthinkable. But for all the vastness of the English language, there [was] simply no word that [came] even remotely close to capturing the horror that would have no doubt washed over the [V]ictim as she was cruelly and relentlessly sexually assaulted by the very son she gave life to 30 year[s] earlier.”154Foot Note 154×Transcript, 14 March 2018, p 28. 69 Coming back to the breach of trust, the Accused was supposed to look after his mother as there was no one in the Flat when the Husband left for work in the early morning but yet aided by Dutch courage, he had succumbed to his depraved desires and sexually assaulted the Victim in the sanctity of her own home. 70 In respect of the second offence-specific factor of harm caused to the Victim, the Defence took issue with the absence of long-term harm suffered by the Victim.155Foot Note 155×Transcript, 14 March 2018, pp 44–45.In my judgment, there was no such requirement. As stated by the Court of Appeal inTerence Ng, what mattered was whether there was any serious physical harm or mental effects suffered by the victim and apsychiatric illnesswould be one such example (at [44h]). In the present case, the IMH psychiatrist had found that the Victim was suffering from “Acute Stress Disorderprecipitatedby the sexual assault incident on 4 October 2013” [emphasis added; emphasis in original omitted].156Foot Note 156×Agreed Bundle, p 33, para 12.The psychological harm caused to the Victim was patent and she would have to live with the trauma and shame. 71 However, contrary to the Prosecution’s submission, I was not convinced that the third offence-specific factor (deliberate infliction of special trauma) was made out. There was no evidence of the Accused’s intention to inflict any such trauma on the Victim (Terence Ngat [44i]) apart from what had been mentioned under the factor of “severe harm”. 72 Since there were at least two offence-specific aggravating factors for the offence in C2, this fell within Band 2 of the sentencing bands and required a sentence in the range of 13 to 17 years’ imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane (Terence Ngat [53]–[56]). Taking into account the gravity of the mentioned aggravating factors, I found a sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane to be the indicative starting point for the offence. 73 At the second stage of the inquiry, the Prosecution emphasised the offender-specific aggravating factor of evident lack of remorse – manifested in the unfounded allegations launched by the Defence at the Victim throughout the trial.157Foot Note 157×Transcript, 14 March 2018, pp 37–38.As perTerence Ng(at [64(c)]), I agreed with the Prosecution that there was evident lack of remorse by the Accused. During the trial, the Accused had portrayed the Victim as a whore and tried to cast aspersions on her morality and character, both as a mother and a woman. The Defence suggested that she had affairs with other men158Foot Note 158×Transcript, Day 2, p 13; Transcript, Day 4, pp 30–31.and attacked her character by pointing out irrelevantly that her son in India was illegitimate.159Foot Note 159×Transcript, Day 2, p 13; Transcript, 14 March 2018, p 37.The Accused also personally maligned the Victim by relying on the Past Incident (see [42] above). He elaborated and claimed to have visited her once as a teenager looking for motherly attention, only to be given $2 and turned away by the Victim who appeared at the door dressed only in her brassiere.160Foot Note 160×Transcript, Day 7, pp 63–64.As mentioned, the Past Incident was never put to the Victim. The Defence had also made the “outrageous submission”161Foot Note 161×Transcript, 14 March 2018, p 37.that the Victim “could have easily avoided [the Accused’s penetration of his penis into her vagina] by not parting her legs”.162Foot Note 162×DCS, paras 139–140.As the Prosecution pointed out, this submission was bizarrely based on the “antediluvian notion that a woman [could] resist a rapist if she really want[ed] to”.163Foot Note 163×Transcript, 14 March 2018, p 37.Lastly, the Defence also alleged various heinous motives on the part of the Victim that disparaged her character. These factors demonstrated that this was one of the worst cases of lack of remorse. The trial further humiliated the Victim and impeded any progress for her recovery. There were also no relevant mitigating factors in the Accused’s favour – he was not a first-time offender as he had antecedents for,inter alia, housebreaking and robbery.164Foot Note 164×Criminal Records (Exhibit “E”).Weighing these factors, I found a sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane apposite for C2. 74 For C1, which involved the Accused outraging the Victim’s modesty, for reasons similar to C2 and for the additional offence-specific aggravating factor of high degree of sexual exploitation (placing the Victim’s “hands onto [the Accused’s] bare, exposed penis”),165Foot Note 165×Transcript, 14 March 2018, pp 39–40.this would also fall within Band 2, leading to a starting point of five to 15 months’ imprisonment (Kunasekarans/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor[2018] SGHC 09 at [49]). In my judgment, taking into account both the offence-specific and offender-specific factors, a sentence between the mid-point and the high end of the Band, of one year’s imprisonment for C1 was justified. Whilst the Prosecution additionally submitted for one stroke of the cane for C1,166Foot Note 166×Transcript, 14 March 2018, p 40.I did not impose any caning in view of my decision on sentence for C2 and C3. 75 For C3, which involved aggravated outrage of modesty, the mandatory minimum sentence was two years’ imprisonment with mandatory caning under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”). Before me, unlike the earlier two offences, there were no applicable sentencing guidelines for this offence and as such the Prosecution invited me to set out new guidelines,167Foot Note 167×Transcript, 14 March 2018, p 46.based on an extrapolation of the sentencing framework laid out inGBR v Public Prosecutor[2017] SGHC 296 (“GBR”). The Defence had no issue with the proposed guidelines.168Foot Note 168×Transcript, 14 March 2018, p 46. 76 InGBR, See Kee Oon J transposed the sentencing framework fromTerence Ngto offences under s 354(2) of the Penal Code (outrage of modesty of a minor under 14 years old), which had a maximum imprisonment term of five years with no mandatory caning (at [26]–[27]). See J’s proposed bands were as follows: (a) Band 1: less than one year’s imprisonment; (b) Band 2: one to three years’ imprisonment; and (c) Band 3: three to five years’ imprisonment. 77 Based on this approach, the Prosecution proposed the following guidelines for offences under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code: (a) Band 1: two to four years’ imprisonment, three strokes; (b) Band 2: four to seven years’ imprisonment, six strokes; and (c) Band 3: seven to 10 years’ imprisonment, 12 strokes. I found these guidelines to be appropriate given that they cohered with the sentencing guidelines that have been laid down for other sexual offences and promoted a measure of consistency in this area.  They would also enable the utilisation of the full range of the possible sentences to avoid “a clustering of sentencing outcomes” (Terence Ngat [14];GBRat [26]), which had indeed happened with 30 months’ imprisonment as the typical sentence for an offence under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code.169Foot Note 169×Transcript, 14 March 2018, pp 46 and 57. 78 Applying this framework, for reasons similar to C1, this case would fall within Band 2 and a sentence of five years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane was justified for C3. Whilst I was mindful of See J’s observation inGBR, that the higher end of the Band 2 framework for a s 354(2) offence was apt for skin-to-skin contact (at [34]), taking into account the strong case for prospective overruling (seePublic Prosecutor v Hue An Li[2014] 4 SLR 661 at [126]–[131]), I declined to impose a sentence in the range of six years’ imprisonment for C3 because it would have been significantly higher than the typical cluster of 30 months’ imprisonment that had erstwhile existed for this offence. 79 Under s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), two of the imprisonment terms in the present case had to run consecutively. In line with the totality principle and the one-transaction rule (seeMohamedShouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor[2014] 2 SLR 998 at [27]–[82]) and as was common ground for both parties,170Foot Note 170×Transcript, 14 March 2018, pp 40 and 48.I decided to run the imprisonment terms for C1 and C2 consecutively with effect from 4 October 2013, the date on which the accused was remanded. I ordered the imprisonment term for C3 to run concurrently with the other two imprisonment terms in C1 and C2. This resulted in the global sentence of 16 years’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane.
