        "Arguments": "6.    Clause 24 of the Guarantee\n\n    states:24. This Guarantee and all rights obligations and\n\n  liabilities arising hereunder shall be construed and determined under and be\n\n  enforced in accordance with the laws of Malaysia and we agree that the Courts\n\n  of Malaysia shall have jurisdiction over all disputes arising under this\n\n  Guarantee.7.    Clause 28 of the Guarantee\n\n    states:28. [I/We] shall at all times maintain an agent for\n\n  services of process in Singapore. Such agent shall be [MEASUREX ENGINEERING\n\n  PTE TD] and [I/we] undertake not to revoke the authority of the above agent\n\n  and if for any reason such agent no longer serves as [my/our] agent to receive\n\n  service of process in the manner provided in clause 22 hereof or such other\n\n  manner provided by law, [I/We] shall appoint another such agent, shall (sic)\n\n  advice you thereof and deliver promptly to you the acceptance by the agent of\n\n  its appointment.8.    It is clear that the terms of\n\n    cl 24 of the Guarantee do not specifically state that the jurisdiction of\n\n    the Malaysian courts is an exclusive one. Neither do they state specifically\n\n    that it is non-exclusive.9.    Mr Stephen Soh, acting for MCB,\n\n    submitted that under cl 24, the determination of ones rights and\n\n    enforcement thereof were separate. The former was to be construed by the\n\n    governing law and the latter was to be governed by rules of procedure\n\n    according to the lex fori but in the present case, cl 24 had already\n\n    stipulated that enforcement was to be in accordance with the laws of\n\n    Malaysia. According to him, therefore, the governing law and the procedural\n\n    law was Malaysian law and this could only work if cl 24 is construed such\n\n    that the parties had agreed that the Malaysian courts have exclusive\n\n    jurisdiction.10.    Mr Soh also submitted that even\n\n    though the word exclusive is not found in cl 24, I should nevertheless\n\n    construe cl 24 as a provision providing for the exclusive jurisdiction of\n\n    the Malaysian courts. He relied onContinental Bank NA v Aeokos Cia\n\n    Naviera SA & others[1994] 2 All ER 540 for this proposition.11.    The relevant provision in theContinental\n\n    Bankcase is cl 21 of the loan agreement. It states:21.01 This agreement shall be governed by and construed\n\n  in accordance with English law. 21.02 Each of the borrowers  hereby\n\n  irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts and hereby\n\n  irrevocable nominates Messrs Aegis (London) Ltd of 197 Knightsbridge, London\n\n  SW7, England, to receive service of proceedings in such courts on is behalf\n\n  but the bank reserves the right to proceed under this agreement in the courts\n\n  of any other country claiming or having jurisdiction in respect thereof.12.    Mr Soh pointed out that in that\n\n    case, the bank had specifically reserved the right to proceed in the courts\n\n    of another country, whereas in the present case, MBB had not done so.13.    As regards cl 28 of the\n\n    Guarantee, Mr Soh argued that cl 28 could apply to proceedings commenced in\n\n    Singapore against MEPL or proceedings commenced in Malaysia against MEPL but\n\n    to be served on MEPL in Singapore.14.    As there was ambiguity, the two\n\n    provisions should be construed against MBB such that cl 24 provides for the\n\n    exclusive jurisdiction of the Malaysian courts and cl 28 only applies if\n\n    Malaysian proceedings are commenced against MEPL but to be served on MEPL in\n\n    Singapore.15.    Mr Soh accepted that even if cl\n\n    24 were construed as an agreement to let the Malaysian courts have exclusive\n\n    jurisdiction, MBB could still show why cl 24 should not be applied but the\n\n    burden was on it to do so.16.    If, however, cl 24 were not an\n\n    exclusive jurisdiction clause, Mr Soh accepted that the burden was on MCB to\n\n    show why a stay should be ordered.17.    In that event, Mr Soh argued\n\n    that I should nevertheless still order a stay of the action against MCB on\n\n    the ground of forum non conveniens. On this point, he relied onThe\n\n    Eleftheria[1970] P.94.18.    The principles for a stay were\n\n    summarised by Brandon J inThe Eleftheria(from p 99 to 100) as\n\n    follows:The principles established by the authorities can, I\n\n  think, be summarised as follows: (1) Where plaintiffs sue in England in breach\n\n  of an agreement to refer disputes to a foreign court, and the defendants apply\n\n  for a stay, the English court, assuming the claim to be otherwise within its\n\n  jurisdiction, is not bound to grant a stay but has a discretion whether to do\n\n  so or not. (2) The discretion should be exercised by granting a stay unless\n\n  strong cause for not doing so is shown. (3) The burden of proving such strong\n\n  cause is on the plaintiffs. (4) In exercising its discretion the court should\n\n  take into account all the circumstances of the particular case. (5) In\n\n  particular, but without prejudice to (4), the following matters, where they\n\n  arise, may properly be regarded: - (a) In what country the evidence on the\n\n  issues of fact is situated, or more readily available, and the effect of that\n\n  on the relative convenience and expense of trial as between the English and\n\n  foreign courts. (b) Whether the law of the foreign court applies and, if so,\n\n  whether it differs from English law in any material respects. (c) With what\n\n  country either party is connected, and how closely. (d) Whether the defendant\n\n  genuinely desire trial in the foreign country, or are only seeking procedural\n\n  advantages. (e) Whether the plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in\n\n  the foreign court because they would: (i) be deprived of security for their\n\n  claim; (ii) be unable to enforce any judgment obtained; (iii) be faced with a\n\n  time-bar not applicable in England; or (iv) for political, racial, religious\n\n  or other reasons be unlikely to get a fair trial.19.    Mr Soh sought to persuade me\n\n    that there was no dispute of fact which required evidence to be given from\n\n    witnesses in Singapore as the credit facilities and the Guarantee were not\n\n    in dispute.20.    He also argued that although\n\n    the loan was made by the Singapore branch of MBB, this did not mean that\n\n    payment had to be made in Singapore. If MCB had tendered payment in\n\n    Malaysia, MBB would have accepted such payment. Therefore the breach by MCB\n\n    in failing to pay could easily have taken place in Malaysia.21.    Mr Soh also submitted that the\n\n    Guarantee was probably signed in Malaysia and was stamped in Malaysia.22.    Aside from procedural disputes\n\n    as to whether the claim was sufficiently particularised and whether a\n\n    judgment against MCB must be broken into various components, the main\n\n    dispute by MCB was on the default interest claimed by MBB. Mr Soh said as\n\n    Malaysian law governed, s 75 of the Malaysian Contracts Act of 1950 would\n\n    apply and this section may prevent MBB from claiming default interest if\n\n    such interest were to be construed as a penalty or if MBB failed to prove\n\n    that its loss would amount to the equivalent of the default interest.\n\n    Although Mr Soh accepted that the Singapore courts were capable of hearing\n\n    Malaysian expert evidence on this section, he submitted that it was\n\n    preferable for the Malaysian courts to do so.23.    Mr Soh further argued that\n\n    there was no suggestion of injustice or detriment to MBB if a stay was\n\n    ordered.24.    His position, in summary, was\n\n    that the connecting factors point more to Malaysia than Singapore.25.    Mr Herman Jeremiah, acting for\n\n    MBB, also relied on theContinental Bankcase. He said that it\n\n    supported MBBs position rather than MCBs. He argued that in that case,\n\n    the provision also stipulated that the borrower nominate someone to receive\n\n    service of proceedings in the English courts on its behalf, just like cl 28\n\n    of the Guarantee and the English court took this into account in concluding\n\n    that the parties there had agreed to the jurisdiction of the English courts.26.    Mr Jeremiah also submitted that\n\n    even if cl 24 provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Malaysian\n\n    courts, I was not obliged to order a stay of the present action in Singapore\n\n    against MCB as a Malaysian court would not have been under a similar\n\n    obligation. He relied onInter Maritime Management Sdn Bhd v Kai Tai\n\n    Timber Company Ltd, Hong Kong[1995] 4 CLJ 164.27.    Mr Jeremiah submitted that\n\n    there were more connecting factors with Singapore.28.    The loan was made by a\n\n    Singapore branch of MBB to MEPL which is a company incorporated in\n\n    Singapore.29.    The claims against MEPL and MCB\n\n    arose because of MEPLs failure to pay the monies due and owing by it to\n\n    MBB.30.    Payment was to be made in\n\n    Singapore since the Singapore branch of MBB disbursed the loan, seeMalacca\n\n    Securities Sdn Bhd v Loke Yu[1999] 6 MLJ 112andBank Bumiputra\n\n    Malaysia Berhad v Melewar Holdings Sdn Bhd & 4 Ors[1990] 1 CLJ 1246.31.    Action had been commenced\n\n    against MEPL in Singapore.32.    There is no material difference\n\n    between Malaysian law and Singapore law on guarantees and contracts and even\n\n    if there were such a difference, there was no reason why the Singapore\n\n    courts would not be able to apply Malaysian law."
