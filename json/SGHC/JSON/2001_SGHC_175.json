        "Sentence": "22        The law provides in Section 376 (1) of the Penal Code that whoever commits rape shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning. The Accused, being 55 years of age, is not liable to be caned. 23        The Accused has violated a 33-year-old body in which resides a 2-year-old mind. Sexual assault by a stranger is a nasty experience. To be raped by one’s uncle must be ghastly. When the victim in question is a lady who cannot fend for or defend herself because of her unfortunate mental condition, the rapes are nothing short of dastardly. 24        The Accused caused the victim to be pregnant and to undergo the risks of an abortion after more than 20 weeks of pregnancy. 25        The fact that no violence was used is of no mitigating effect at all here as absolutely no physical force was necessary to coerce or to subdue the victim. 26        He has pleaded guilty and that is of some mitigating force. However, the Prosecution would have little difficulty proving the crimes against the Accused in view of the DNA report and the Accused’s admission to his wife. 27        The only voice that this victim has is that of the Court and this Court must speak to the Accused in words which make it manifestly clear that people who take advantage of vulnerable and defenceless victims will be severely punished by the law. The Accused is 55 years old. If he were below 50 years of age, I would most certainly have sentenced him to at least eight strokes of the cane for each Charge. Bearing in mind the totality principle in sentencing, I sentence the Accused to 10 years imprisonment on each of the two Charges, with both sentences to run consecutively with effect from 2 February 2001, making a total of 20 years imprisonment.
