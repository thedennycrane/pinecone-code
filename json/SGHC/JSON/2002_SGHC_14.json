        "The facts": "3 The appellant, a 34 year old Bangladeshi national, was granted an\n\nemployment pass to work in Singapore on 17 April 1996. From 17 April 1996 to 15 April\n\n1998, he worked as a purchasing officer in Arc Marine Pte Ltd. From 1998 to 2001, he\n\nworked at Unimarine Shipping Services Pte Ltd (‘Unimarine’), first as a\n\npurchasing officer, and later as a purchasing manager from 1 January 2000.4 During this five year period, the appellant made five applications to\n\neither apply for or renew his employment pass. These applications formed the subject\n\nmatter of the charges under s 57(1)(k). The offence under s 57(1)(k), read together with s\n\n57(1)(iv), states as follows:Any person who\n\n  …by making a false statement obtains or attempts to obtain an entry or re-entry\n\n  permit, pass or certificate for himself or for any other person … shall be guilty of\n\n  an offence and - … shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $4,000 or to\n\n  imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both …5 The five charges against the appellant cover the period from 1997 to\n\n2001 and were nearly similar in content. It suffices to relate the first of the charges\n\nproceeded with, which stated:You … are\n\n  charged that you applied for renewal of an Employment Pass in Form 8R, which application\n\n  was received by the Employment Pass Department on 23.2.1999, to work for Unimarine\n\n  Shipping Services Pte Ltd (RCB No.: 199201449N) as a Purchasing Officer, for which an\n\n  Employment Pass was issued on 27.4.1999, on the basis of your declaration in the\n\n  application form that you graduated from University of Dhaka with a Bachelor of Science, a\n\n  statement which you declared to be true to the best of your knowledge, when the\n\n  application form contained facts which you knew to be false. You have thereby committed an\n\n  offence under Section 57(1)(k), of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) and punishable under\n\n  Section 57(1)(iv) of the said Act.6 The other two charges to which the appellant pleaded guilty related\n\nto similar applications to renew his employment pass, made on 1 March 2000 and 3 March\n\n2001 respectively. In a similar vein, the two charges taken into consideration averred to\n\nsimilar applications made on 22 February 1997 and 15 April 1998.7 The common thread in these applications was the appellant’s\n\nfalse declaration that he had graduated from the University of Dhaka in 1986 with a\n\nBachelor of Science degree. Each application was supported by a copy of a forged\n\ngraduation certificate to this effect. Verification from the University of Dhaka confirmed\n\nhowever that the certificate was bogus and that the appellant was not a graduate of the\n\nUniversity. Nor, for that matter, did he hold the degree in question. He had in fact\n\npurchased the forged certificate in Indonesia sometime in 1988 or 1989, for the price of\n\nabout US$100. In this manner, he had thereby induced the Employment Pass Department of the\n\nMinistry of Manpower to issue as well as renew his employment passes annually from 1997 to\n\n2001.",
        "The mitigation plea": "8 In mitigation, the appellant pleaded several factors which can be\n\nsuccinctly stated as follows.9 First, he claimed to be a victim of circumstance and poor advice. He\n\nhad apparently paid a Bangladeshi agent US$3,000 to travel to Australia for employment,\n\nbut was tricked and left stranded in Jakarta. Sometime in 1988 or 1989, he claimed to have\n\nmet a second Bangladeshi agent, who took pity on him and offered to sell him the false\n\ndegree certificate in order to obtain an employment pass in Singapore. This unnamed agent\n\nfurther provided him with the air fare to fly to Singapore.10 Secondly, he pleaded that he had lived as a virtuous, law-abiding\n\nand productive resident in Singapore. He had paid all his taxes and had never given\n\ntrouble to the authorities. His employers considered him an employee of high calibre and\n\nwrote testimonials in his favour. Notably, his present employer also stood as his bailor\n\nfor the present charges. He also pleaded that he did not cynically extract the full\n\nbenefits of his deception – for example, he did not purchase an HDB flat, nor did he\n\nenjoy medical benefits at a subsidized rate. He also claimed to be a ‘pious and\n\ndevout resident’ who rendered both time and money to charitable organisations.11 Thirdly, he asked for recognition to be given to his full\n\nco-operation with the authorities. Upon commencement of investigations, he had admitted to\n\nhis wrongdoing and subsequently pleaded guilty in court.12 Finally, he pleaded for leniency on the basis that he was married\n\nwith two young and dependent children. He claimed to have come from a well-respected\n\nfamily in Bangladesh dealing in the clothing business, and submitted that a custodial\n\nsentence would ruin his family reputation as well as his personal life.",
        "The decision below": "13 The judge in arriving at his decision considered that there was a\n\npatent and inexplicable disparity in sentencing precedents at the district courts. Turning\n\nto the available appellate decisions for guidance, he found the facts ofRivera Eleazar\n\nP v PP(MA 308 of 1997, unreported) directly applicable to the present case and\n\nsentenced the appellant accordingly. Significantly, he also expressed the opinion that a\n\ncustodial sentence should be the norm for an offence under s 57(1)(k), and that a fine\n\nshould only be granted under exceptional circumstances.",
        "The appeal": "14 Counsel for the appellant, Mr S K Kumar, submitted that a blanket\n\ncustodial sentence should not be applied to this particular offence. He argued that to\n\nadopt such a ‘benchmark’ would unnecessarily fetter the discretion of the judge\n\nunder s 57(1)(iv) to impose either a fine or a custodial sentence. He further contended\n\nthat, given the various mitigation factors in this particular case, the discretion of the\n\ncourt should be exercised in favour of a fine only.15 At the outset, I dispensed with Mr Kumar’s concern about the\n\nundesirability of a ‘benchmark’ tariff as opposed to absolute sentencing\n\ndiscretion. This was simplistic argument which missed the point of a ‘benchmark’\n\ntariff. A ‘benchmark’ is a sentencing norm prevailing on the mind of every\n\njudge, ensuring consistency and therefore fairness in a criminal justice system. It is not\n\ncast in stone, nor does it represent an abdication of the judicial prerogative to tailor\n\ncriminal sanctions to the individual offender. It instead provides the focal point against\n\nwhich sentences in subsequent cases, with differing degrees of criminal culpability, can\n\nbe accurately determined. A good ‘benchmark’ decision therefore lays down\n\ncarefully the parameters of its reasoning in order to allow future judges to determine\n\nwhat falls within the scope of the ‘norm’, and what exceptional situations\n\njustify departure from it.16 Having perused the authorities on s 57(1)(k), I found it unfortunate\n\nthat some of the preceding cases in the district courts were inconsistent and could not\n\nprovide a clear sentencing regime for this area of law. For example, in cases with\n\nmaterially similar facts, the punishments given in the lower courts varied between fines\n\nand custodial sentences. Moreover, although five cases have come up for consideration on\n\nappeal, they unfortunately did not merit written decisions, and therefore lacked\n\nprescriptive force. I was therefore grateful to the learned district judge for grasping\n\nthe nettle and bringing this issue to the forefront. The time is ripe for a robust\n\nreassessment of the applicable sentencing principles and to set a firm benchmark for cases\n\nof false representation punishable under s 57(1)(iv).",
        "The sentencing precedents relating to s 57(1)(k) offences": "17 In this regard, I shall first review the five Magistrate’s\n\nAppeal cases which have come before this court. To my mind they illustrate a clear\n\nsentencing principle which will be evident upon a comparison of their facts.18 In two of the five cases, the appellate court decided that fines\n\nwere sufficient punishment. InGoh Chuay Fern v PP(MA 344 of 1999, unreported),\n\nthe appellant falsely declared in her application for an entry permit that she had never\n\nbeen convicted in a court of law in any country. She had, however, been previously\n\nconvicted for an offence of theft-in-dwelling. She pleaded guilty to one charge under s\n\n57(1)(k) of the Act, and on appeal successfully reduced the initial sentence of six\n\nweeks’ imprisonment to a fine of $1,000 in default one month’s imprisonment.19 InNg Kar Weng v PP(MA 300 of 1997, unreported), the\n\nappellant attempted to obtain an entry permit for his wife, a Chinese national. He had\n\nmade a false statement in the application that she had not previously been convicted in a\n\ncourt of law in any country. In fact, she had been convicted and fined previously in\n\nSingapore for working illegally while on a social visit pass. He pleaded guilty and was\n\nsentenced to imprisonment for two months. On appeal, the sentence was reduced to a fine of\n\n$2,500 in default two months’ imprisonment.20 In the remaining three appellate decisions, the court found it fit\n\nto impose a custodial sentence on the offenders. InLi Hong Wei v PP(MA 236 of\n\n2001, unreported), the appellant, a Chinese national, had obtained a social visit pass by\n\nfalsely declaring on her disembarkation form that she had never been prohibited from\n\nentering Singapore. In truth, she had been banned from re-entering Singapore after being\n\nconvicted for illegally overstaying in 1997. She pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to two\n\nmonths’ imprisonment. On appeal, her sentence of two months’ imprisonment was\n\naffirmed.21 InKesorn Yuangtan v PP(MA 250 of 1999, unreported), the\n\nappellant, in her application to obtain an entry permit, had failed to declare that she\n\nfaced a permanent ban from entering Singapore, following her arrest in 1992 for engaging\n\nin prostitution. Her sentence of two months’ imprisonment was affirmed on appeal.22 The final appellate case wasRivera Eleazar P v PP(MA 308 of\n\n1997, unreported). This case was closest on point to the present facts and therefore most\n\npersuasive in authority. The appellant in this case was a 29 year-old Filipino national,\n\nwho had bought a forged Bachelor of Science in Commerce (Marketing) degree certificate in\n\n1993. He subsequently tendered it in his application for an employment pass in 1996 to\n\nwork as a website engineer. In March 1997, he made the same false declaration in a second\n\napplication for an employment pass to work as a managing director in his own company. In\n\nmitigation, he pleaded that he had married a Singaporean wife who was gainfully employed\n\nas a senior medical representative, and that they had two young children who were\n\nSingapore citizens. He was also the director and 25% shareholder of the company with a\n\npaid-up capital of $100,000. He pleaded guilty to one charge and was sentenced to two\n\nmonths’ imprisonment. His appeal against sentence was subsequently dismissed.23 The above cases provide a valuable insight into a key sentencing\n\nprinciple in offences under s57(1)(k), which is that the severity of the punishment\n\ndepends on the nature and extent of the deceit employed by the applicant. In this regard,\n\nthe act of tendering a forged certificate inRivera Eleazarwas the most culpable\n\namong the above instances of deception due its active and deliberate nature. There, as in\n\nthe present case, the applicant had gone beyond making a false declaration. He had\n\nactively procured and submitted a forged certificate for the sole purpose of corroborating\n\nhis falsehood, thereby boosting his chances of hoodwinking the authorities. Similarly, the\n\noffenders inLi Hong WeiandKesorn Yuangtanmerited custodial sentences\n\nbecause their false declarations were made in active defiance of an entrance ban by the\n\nimmigration authorities. This was unlike the offenders inGoh Chuay FernandNg\n\nKar Weng, who, although having made a false declaration on a material fact, did not do\n\nso with the knowledge that they would be thwarting a previous adverse finding made against\n\nthem by the immigration authorities.24 Admittedly, the five appellate decisions cited above have limited\n\nprescriptive force as they do not set down a clear sentencing norm. Neither do they inform\n\nof the relevant sentencing principles applicable to an offence as wide in scope and as\n\nprevalent in practice as that under s 57(1)(k). It is therefore appropriate at this\n\njuncture to consider a clear re-statement of the sentencing regime that should apply to\n\nsuch cases.",
        "The sentencing norm and principles for false representations under s 57": "25 I turn first to legislative history to discern parliamentary\n\nintention behind the promulgation of the offence under s 57. Notably, the maximum\n\npunishment prescribed under s 57(1)(iv) was doubled by Parliament in amendments to the Act\n\nmade in 1995, when the maximum fine was increased from $2,000 to $4,000, and the maximum\n\nterm of imprisonment was increased from six months to 12 months. This was due to concern\n\nover the increase in offences of false representation under the Immigration Act, as\n\nrepresented by s 57(1)(f) to (l) and punishable under s 57(1)(iv). On 1 November 1995, the\n\nMinister for Home Affairs had this to say in Parliament, during the second reading of the\n\nAmendment Bill:Mr Speaker, Sir, we\n\n  have also taken the opportunity to enhance the penalty under section 57(1)(iv) from a\n\n  maximum fine of $2,000 to $4,000 and from six months’ jail to one years’ jail to\n\n  deal with the increase in the number of offences of false representations under section\n\n  57(1)(f). The penalties for other offences listed under section 57(1)(iv) have also been\n\n  raised to maintain parity with the new penalty under section 57(1)(f).Parliament had therefore espoused its intention to take a tougher stand\n\nagainst such offenders, presumably to stem the tide of illegal immigrants awash on our\n\nshores in the wake of the regional economic downturn. It therefore behoves the judiciary\n\nto adopt a similar mindset when enforcing the law in immigration cases.26 For this reason, I intend to lay down a firm sentencing benchmark in\n\norder to send a strong message of deterrence to immigration offenders. Where a false\n\nrepresentation is made under the various limbs of s 57(1) that are punishable by s\n\n57(1)(iv), a custodial sentence should be the applicable norm, and a fine should only be\n\nwarranted under exceptional circumstances. This is because a mere fine of up to $4,000\n\nwould be insufficient deterrence when weighed against the pecuniary benefits of working in\n\nSingapore. To some economic migrants, such a fine would merely represent a slap on the\n\nwrist, a cynically calculated cost of breaking the law for personal profit. I do not think\n\nthat the immigration policies of a country, and the welfare of its citizen employees,\n\nshould be held ransom by such profiteers. Accordingly, custodial sentences must be imposed\n\nto send out the firm signal that gaining entrance to Singapore by deception simply does\n\nnot pay.27 A benchmark is however imperfect without clear guidance as to its\n\nunderlying sentencing principles. This guides the judge as to the length of the custodial\n\nsentence, as well as to the existence of special circumstances which exceptionally warrant\n\na fine only. In this exercise, I do not find it useful to make tortuous distinctions\n\nbetween individual cases. Instead, the following four considerations should prevail on the\n\njudicial mind in applying the sentencing norm.28 The first consideration should be the materiality of the false\n\nrepresentation on the mind of the decision-maker. The greater the impact of the falsehood\n\nin inducing the grant of the application, the more severe should be the sentence imposed.\n\nConversely, a false declaration as to a fact which makes little difference to the\n\napplication might exceptionally give grounds for leniency to be granted.29 The next consideration would be the nature and extent of the\n\ndeception, as discussed in the above authorities. An applicant who goes to greater lengths\n\nto deceive the authorities, or who acts in conscious defiance of the authorities, merits\n\nmore severe punishment. Moreover, a deception which by nature is more difficult to detect,\n\nor which, as in the present case, is aided by the production of forged corroborating\n\ndocuments, should likewise deserve a heftier punishment. Offenders should not be allowed\n\nto exploit the evidential difficulties inherent in certain types of declarations, whose\n\nverification would otherwise take up valuable time and resources on the part of the\n\nimmigration authority.30 The third factor to take into consideration should be the\n\nconsequences of the deception. In the present type of case, the court should consider\n\nwhether the employer suffered any detriment as a result of the false declaration.\n\nAdditionally, it should also consider the wider implications of the deception –\n\nwhether, for example, the offender had effectively deprived a potentially better-qualified\n\napplicant of the job opportunity; or worse, put others at risk of adverse consequences by\n\nperforming a job without the requisite skills.31 The final factor to be considered relates to the personal mitigation\n\nfactors applicable to the offender. In this regard, I would add the rider that little\n\nweight should be accorded to those hardships which arise only as a result of the\n\noffender’s illegal entrance to the country. Often in such cases, the offender starts\n\na family in Singapore, despite the knowledge of his illegal entry and the sufferings they\n\nwould face if he were caught and punished. To that extent I would consider such hardships\n\nto be self-induced and carrying little mitigation value. He who lives on borrowed time\n\ncannot complain when the clock runs out.",
        "The appropriate sentence": "32 In the present case, a substantial custodial sentence is therefore\n\nappropriate, unless there exist exceptional circumstances which justify a departure from\n\nthe norm. Applying the four sentencing considerations above, I found no reason to depart\n\nfrom this norm, for the following reasons.33 The first is that the deception was clearly material. Put another\n\nway, but for the appellant’s purported educational qualifications, the Employment\n\nPass Department would not have granted him entry into Singapore. The next consideration I\n\ntook into account was that the deception on the part of the appellant was conscious and\n\ndeliberate. The forged certificate was obtained as early as 1988 or 1989, yet he had the\n\npresence of mind to retain it at least until 1996 to support his false declaration. In\n\nthis light I found his account of being a victim of circumstance and of having been led\n\nastray by an unnamed agent to be highly dubious. This deception seemed to my mind to be a\n\nplanned and conscious act, and was hardly the product of a moment of weakness. The third\n\nconsideration related to the substantive consequences of the deception. While his\n\nemployers were not prejudiced by the appellant’s lack of qualifications, the fact\n\nremained that, by his deception, he had deprived a better-qualified candidate of entry\n\ninto the country. Finally, I did not find the personal mitigation factors in this case\n\nexceptional enough to grant only a fine or a token custodial sentence. While his early\n\nplea of guilt had some mitigatory effect, I was not inclined to give it much weight, for\n\nthe reason that the prosecution would have had no difficulty in proving the charge against\n\nhim, per Chan Sek Keong J inWong Kai Chuen Philip vPP[1991] 1 MLJ 321, 322-23;\n\nsee alsoSim Gek Yong v PP[1995] 1 SLR 537. The disruption to the appellant’s\n\nfamily life was likewise not a good mitigating factor, for, as mentioned above, he had\n\nbrought the plight upon his family with full knowledge of the attendant risks. Balanced\n\nagainst these factors were the countervailing aggravations that the offence was motivated\n\npurely by personal benefit, and that it had involved a five year long period of deception,\n\nwith every likelihood that the appellant would have made further false declarations had he\n\nnot been caught.34 Accordingly, having considered that a substantial custodial sentence\n\nwas appropriate, I saw no reason to depart from the tariff of two months’\n\nimprisonment set out inRivera Eleazar P v PP, whose facts were materially similar\n\nto the present appeal. I therefore enhanced the sentences to two months’ imprisonment\n\non each charge, with two of the sentences to run consecutively.",
