        "Events prior to the arrests": "4 The facts pertaining to Mazlan’s activities prior to his arrest were mostly not in dispute. Kay Yong was, for the most part, not in a position to dispute these facts. Sometime before 20 July 2015, Mazlan became acquainted with a person called Mani through a friend. According to Mazlan, Mani was also known by the name of Ah Boy.1Foot Note 1×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 45 (lines 18–19).The said friend recommended Mani to Mazlan as a drug supplier because Mazlan wanted to obtain drugs for his own consumption.2Foot Note 2×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 39 (lines 29–31).This friend then gave Mazlan’s phone number to Mani.3Foot Note 3×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 40 (lines 10–11).Prior to 20 July 2015, Mazlan never met Mani in person. 5 About three to four weeks before 20 July 2015, Mani called Mazlan several times and asked Mazlan to help him make drug deliveries. Mazlan initially refused these requests.4Foot Note 4×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 40 (line 27). 6 Sometime in the afternoon of 20 July 2015, Mani called Mazlan again and asked him for help with sending drugs to someone called “Botak”. At the time, Mazlan did not know who Botak was.5Foot Note 5×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 42 (lines 25–26).At trial, however, he identified Kay Yong as Botak.6Foot Note 6×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 42 (lines 29–30).Although Mazlan had previously refused Mani, he agreed to assist Mani in delivering the drugs this one time.7Foot Note 7×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 41 (lines 5–7).Mani then instructed Mazlan to meet him that same day at the end of Tuas Avenue 11 in a red car. 7 At around 4pm that afternoon, Mazlan went to Tuas Avenue 11, where Mani was waiting in a red car which bore a Malaysian registration plate.8Foot Note 8×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, pp 42 (lines 18–32) and 43 (lines 1–32).When Mazlan approached the car, Mani rolled down the window and handed Mazlan a 7-Eleven plastic bag containing two packets of granular substance.9Foot Note 9×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, pp 42 (lines 18–32) and 43 (lines 1–32).Mani told Mazlan to deliver one packet to Botak,10Foot Note 10×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 44 (lines 21–32) and 45 (line 1).and added that Botak would give him a sum of money. He did not, however, specify how much money Mazlan should expect.11Foot Note 11×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 63 (lines 2–6).Mani also told Mazlan the number of Botak’s mobile phone, which the latter wrote on a piece of paper.12Foot Note 12×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 45 (lines 6–8).Mazlan’s evidence was that Mani then told him to expect a call from Botak later on.13Foot Note 13×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 45 (lines 4–5).Kay Yong disagreed that Mani could have told Mazlan to expect a call from him because Mani (known by Kay Yong as Ah Boy) had said that Mazlan would call him first14Foot Note 14×First accused’s closing submissions, para 35 and 38.. However, little turned on this dispute of fact. 8 Mazlan then parted ways with Mani and walked towards a nearby bus stop where he waited for a taxi. At about 5.40pm,15Foot Note 15×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 48 (lines 8–13).while he was still at Tuas Avenue 11, Mazlan received a phone call from Kay Yong, whose number matched that which Mani had given to him as Botak’s number (see [7] above).16Foot Note 16×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 47 (lines 20 – 22).Mazlan’s testimony in court was that Kay Yong spoke to him in Malay and asked, “Barangada pada lu?”17Foot Note 17×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 47 (lines 5–6).At trial, the interpreter for Mazlaninformed the court that this can either mean “Is the stuff with you?” or “Is the thing with you?”.18Foot Note 18×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 47 (lines 17–18)After Mazlan answered in the affirmative, Kay Yong told Mazlan to meet him at Blk 31 Bendemeer Road.19Foot Note 19×ABD, p 283 (para 7) and Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 46 (lines 10–21).Kay Yong’s evidence, which was unchallenged, was that Mazlan also told him to bring a bag with him.20Foot Note 20×ABD, p 341 (para 5). 9 Subsequently, Mazlan received a call from his girlfriend, Suhana binte Noordin (“Suhana”),21Foot Note 21×Second accused’s closing submissions, para 8(g).who asked to meet up with Mazlan. Mazlan asked Suhana to pick him up from Tuas Avenue 11.22Foot Note 22×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 46 (lines 7–9).Sometime later, Suhana and another friend of Mazlan’s, Nur Aida Binte Borhan (“Aida”), fetched Mazlan from Tuas Avenue 11 in a yellow car bearing registration number SJH 1649L (“the Car”). Aida was the driver,23Foot Note 23×Certified Transcript, 25 July 2017, pp 3 (lines 28–33) and 4 (lines 1–5 and 9–10).while Suhana sat in the front passenger seat. Mazlan boarded the Car and sat in the rear passenger seat behind Suhana.24Foot Note 24×Certified Transcript, 25 July 2017, p 4 (lines 10–14).He told Suhana that he wanted to meet a friend at Bendemeer Road. The three of them proceeded to Bendemeer Road in the Car.25Foot Note 25×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 47 (lines 29–32) and Certified Transcript 25 July 2017, p 4 (lines 15–16).",
        "Kay Yong’s arrest": "10 At about 6.15pm that same day, 20 July 2015, a party of Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) Special Task Force (“STF”) officers arrived in the vicinity of Blk 31 Bendemeer Road. At about 6.40pm, Senior Staff Sergeant Wong Kah Hung Alwin (“SSS Alwin”) spotted Kay Yong near the fourth floor lift lobby of Blk 31 Bendemeer Road. He reported this through radio set communications. Shortly thereafter, Senior Station Inspector Ng Tze Chiang Tony (“SSI Tony”) reported that he saw Kay Yong at the ground floor of Blk 31 Bendemeer Road, walking in the direction of Blk 30 Bendemeer Road.26Foot Note 26×ABD, p 195. 11 At about 7.05pm, SSI Tony observed the Car moving towards the rubbish collection area near Blk 31 Bendemeer Road. SSI Tony also saw Kay Yong walking towards the same rubbish collection area.27Foot Note 27×ABD, pp 171–172. 12 At the rubbish collection area where the Car had stopped, Kay Yong approached the passenger side.28Foot Note 28×Certified Transcript, 25 July 2017, p 5 (lines 19–20).He was carrying a black bag (“the Black Bag”).29Foot Note 29×Certified Transcript, 25 July 2017, p 5 (line 24).As the Car only had two doors, when Suhana opened her door she had to hunch forward so that the backrest of her seat could be pushed forward, to allow Mazlan to pass what he was conveying to Kay Yong.30Foot Note 30×Certified Transcript, 25 July 2017, p 5 (lines 13–17). 13 What occurred next was a matter of contention. Suhana testified that there was no conversation between Mazlan and Kay Yong, and that the only thing she heard was Kay Yong saying to Mazlan, “Just put inside here,” in English.31Foot Note 31×Certified Transcript, 25 July 2017, pp 4 (lines 30–32); 5 (lines 7–8) and 14 (line 12).She also did not see anything being exchanged between Mazlan and Kay Yong, because she was hunched forward and her head was down.32Foot Note 32×Certified Transcript, 25 July 2017, p 5 (lines 9–13)Mazlan’s evidence was that Kay Yong did not say anything apart from “Masukkandalam beg”, which in Malay means “Put it in the bag”.33Foot Note 33×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 51 (lines 5–18).Kay Yong’s evidence was that he could not remember if he had said anything to the effect of “Just put inside here”.34Foot Note 34×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, p 78 (lines 22–32).Defence counsel for Kay Yong, Mr Low Cheong Yeow and Mr Loo Khee Sheng, took the position that Suhana and Mazlan’s evidence was unreliable, and that Kay Yong never said “just put inside here” either in English or in Malay.35Foot Note 35×First accused’s closing submissions, paras 60–69. 14 Whatever Kay Yong and Mazlan may have said to each other, it was not in dispute that some words were spoken after which Kay Yong opened the Black Bag.36Foot Note 36×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 50 (lines 30–31).Mazlan placed one of the packets of granular substance he had received from Mani in a reddish-orange plastic bag (“the Plastic Bag”),37Foot Note 37×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 52 (lines 3–26).which he identified in court to be the item marked as Exhibit A1A,38Foot Note 38×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 52 (lines 23–25).and placed the Plastic Bag inside Kay Yong’s Black Bag.39Foot Note 39×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 52 (lines 5–7).Kay Yong then handed Mazlan a stack of money, and walked away.40Foot Note 40×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, pp 50 (lines 31–32) and 51 (lines 1–2). 15 A short while after Kay Yong and Mazlan had met at the rubbish collection area, SSI Tony saw Kay Yong walking away from the Car towards Blk 31 Bendemeer Road, while the Car drove off. Kay Yong then proceeded to the fourth floor of Blk 31 Bendemeer Road. When Kay Yong was near the ‘lift lobby A’ area on the fourth floor, SSI Tony, Senior Staff Sergeant Chew Thye Kwang @ Jordi (“SSS Jordi”), Staff Sergeant Norizan Binte Merabzul (“SS Norizan”) and Staff Sergeant Muhammad Helmi Bin Abdul Jalal (“SS Helmi”) moved in to arrest him.41Foot Note 41×ABD, p 172, para 6.SSS Jordi remained on the ground floor, while SSI Tony, SS Norizan and SS Helmi proceeded to the fourth floor.42Foot Note 42×Certified Transcript, 20 July 2017, pp 3 (line 32) and 4 (lines 1–2) and 5 (lines 27–28).The officers were in plain clothes.43Foot Note 43×Certified Transcript, 20 July 2017, p 8 (lines 15–17).When they reached the fourth floor, SSI Tony testified that they saw Kay Yong “face to face”.44Foot Note 44×Certified Transcript, 20 July 2017, p 8 (line 18)It was undisputed that when Kay Yong noticed SSI Tony, SS Norizan and SS Helmi approaching him, he fled and ran in the opposite direction.45Foot Note 45×Certified Transcript, 20 July 2017, p 8 (lines 29–32)SSI Tony, SS Norizan and SS Helmi gave chase.46Foot Note 46×Certified Transcript, 20 July 2017, p 9 (line 1).Kay Yong then ran down the staircase located near lift lobby C. When Kay Yong was at the landing immediately preceding the ground floor, he jumped from the landing,47Foot Note 47×Certified Transcript, 20 July 2017, p 9 (lines 14–16).landing on the ground floor in a fall which fractured his leg.48Foot Note 48×Certified Transcript, 20 July 2017, p 30 (lines 12–13); ABD, p 344, para 16.As Kay Yong fell, the Black Bag was released from his hand and landed a short distance away from him.49Foot Note 49×Certified Transcript, 20 July 2017, p 32 (line 29) 16 SSI Tony, SSS Jordi, SS Helmi and SS Norizan arrested Kay Yong while he was prone on the ground. At about 7.25pm, SSS Jordi recovered the Black Bag. Inside the Black Bag was a reddish-orange plastic bag, Exhibit A1A, which contained one clear plastic packet, Exhibit A1A1, which contained one packet of grey granular substance, Exhibit A1A1A. 17 The packet of grey granular substance, Exhibit A1A1A, forms the subject matter of both the charges against Kay Yong and Mazlan. It was eventually sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”). HSA Analyst Koh Hui Boon analysed the exhibit and found that the packet contained not less than 459.4g of granular substance, containing not less than 18.71g of diamorphine.50Foot Note 50×AB, p 96.",
        "Mazlan’s arrest": "18 After SSI Tony reported that the Car had moved off from the rubbish collection area near Blk 31 Bendemeer Road (see [15] above), another party of CNB STF officers boarded several CNB operational cars and trailed the Car. 19 According to Mazlan, after he had left Blk 31 Bendemeer Road, and while he was in the Car, he received a call from Mani, who asked him whether he had counted the money he had received from Kay Yong. Mazlan answered that he had yet to count the money, in response to which Mani said that he would call Mazlan later.51Foot Note 51×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 54 (lines 25–28). 20  Eventually, at about 7.30pm, the Car stopped in front of Mufiz Eating House along Kitchener Road.52Foot Note 52×ABD, p 226, para 5.After Mazlan, Suhana and Aida alighted from the car, they were arrested by CNB officers. The police report filed in respect of the arrests noted that when Mazlan was searched, a stack of money amounting to $3,000 which was tied with a rubber band was seized from the pocket of his jeans.53Foot Note 53×ABD, p 200.",
        "Events subsequent to Kay Yong’s arrest": "Recording of the contemporaneous statement 21 Shortly after his arrest, the CNB officers escorted Kay Yong into a CNB operational car. Inside the car, SSI Tony recorded a contemporaneous statement from Kay Yong, who spoke in Mandarin.54Foot Note 54×ABD, p 172, para 8.SSI Tony recorded both the questions and answers in Mandarin which he also translated into English.55Foot Note 55×ABD, p 178.The material portions of Kay Yong’s translated contemporaneous statements are as follows: Q Who do these two packets belong to? A The person in the car passed it to me Q Which person, which car A Yellow car, I do not know the license plate number, the person at the back of the car handed it to me Q What is inside A I do not know, I handed money to him and he threw the things into my bag Q What money did you give him A Gambling money Q Do you know what he threw for you? A I don’t know Search of the Bendemeer Flat 22 At about 8.10pm, the CNB officers escorted Kay Yong to his mother’s flat, where he was living at the time, at Blk 31 Bendemeer Road, #04-865 (“the Bendemeer Flat”).56Foot Note 56×ABD, p 172, para 10; Certified Transcript, 20 July 2017, p 81 (lines 17–19).SSI Tony’s evidence was that they searched the Bendemeer Flat for drug paraphernalia as well as items relating to gambling, since Kay Yong had mentioned gambling in his contemporaneous statement.57Foot Note 57×Certified Transcript, 20 July 2017, p 12 (lines 16–31).However, neither any drug paraphernalia nor any gambling-related items were found.58Foot Note 58×Certified Transcript, 20 July 2017, p 13 (lines 1–3). Visit to the Ang Mo Kio Flat 23 At about 8.50pm, the CNB officers left the Bendemeer Flat with Kay Yong and proceeded to Blk 123 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, #12-4023 (“the Ang Mo Kio Flat”). According to SSI Tony, this was Kay Yong’s “official address”, presumably referring to the addressstated in his NRIC. SSI Tony and Kay Yong gave differing accounts of what transpired at the Ang Mo Kio Flat. SSI Tony’s evidence was that Kay Yong had informed the CNB officers that he was no longer staying at this address. SSI Tony thus went to the Ang Mo Kio Flat in order to “verify Kay Yong’s claim”59Foot Note 59×ABD, p 173, para 13.. He knocked on the door several times and left as there was no response60Foot Note 60×ABD, p 173, paras 13–14.. SSI Tony’s conditioned statement did not mention that Kay Yong had handed over the keys to the Ang Mo Kio Flat at any point and indeed, the tenor of SSI Tony’s evidence was that he did not have those keys because if he had them he would not need to knock on the door. SSI Tony was not challenged on this version of the events when he gave evidence at the trial. 24 Kay Yong’s evidence was that he gave SSI Tony the keys to the Ang Mo Kio Flat, and that upon reaching Blk 123 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, the CNB officers “went up to check [Kay Yong’s] flat” while he remained in the CNB operational car. Kay Yong claimed that when the CNB officers returned, they “said that nothing was found in [Kay Yong’s] flat.”61Foot Note 61×ABD, p 344, para 14. Kay Yong’s admission to Changi General Hospital 25 After leaving the Ang Mo Kio Flat, the CNB officers escorted Kay Yong to the CNB office at Police Cantonment Complex, where SSI Tony lodged a police report concerning Kay Yong’s arrest, and also procured a urine sample from Kay Yong.62Foot Note 62×ABD, p 173, paras 16–18.Later that night, the CNB officers escorted Kay Yong to Changi General Hospital (“CGH”) to be examined by a doctor, as he had complained of pain in his leg.63Foot Note 63×ABD, p 174, para 20.Kay Yong was found to have suffered a fracture, and was admitted and warded until 27 July 2015.64Foot Note 64×ABD, p 162. Kay Yong’s statements 26 Apart from the contemporaneous statement recorded by SSI Tony on the day of his arrest, Kay Yong also provided the following statements to CNB: (a) A cautioned statement recorded by the investigating officer, Woman Inspector Elizabeth Zachariah (“IO Elizabeth”) on 27 July 2015 pursuant to s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”).65Foot Note 65×ABD, pp 334–335. (b) Three long statements recorded by IO Elizabeth between 27 July 2015 and 31 July 2015 pursuant to s 22 of the CPC.66Foot Note 66×ABD, pp 340–343, 344–346 and 347–361 respectively. (c) A fourth long statement recorded by Inspector Huang Yixia (“IO Huang”) on 3 March 2016 pursuant to s 22 of the CPC.67Foot Note 67×ABD, pp 398–404. 27 In Kay Yong’s cautioned statement, he stated the following:68Foot Note 68×ABD, p 335. Actually I was there to repay a debt. I saw a Malay who I did not know and told him to pass the $3600 to ‘Boy’. The Malay told me, ‘Boy’ ask me to open my handbag. I asked him why and he said just open it. I opened my handbag and he threw a packet into my handbag and told me ‘Boy’ asked me to do it. I left with my handbag and felt something was wrong when I was near the staircase. I started running and this was the reason why I jumped. When they held me down and told me about a packet of powder, I then realized what happened and that ‘Boy’ had set me up. That is all. 28 In Kay Yong’s first long statement, he gave the following account: On the day of his arrest, he received a call from “Ah Boy” at around noon. Ah Boy was a Malaysian man who had first contacted him over the phone about two years earlier. Ah Boy said that he was a friend of “Ah San”, whom Kay Yong had met in prison five or six years earlier. Over those two years, Ah Boy had gotten Kay Yong involved in online gambling activities, including betting on horses and on football. Ah Boy and Ah San also recruited him to help them run their online betting activities by collecting bets from others in return for a commission. Kay Yong said that when Ah Boy called him at noon on the day of his arrest, he instructed Kay Yong to prepare $3,800, which was what he owed Ah Boy for bets placed during the 2014 World Cup. However, Kay Yong only managed to gather $3,600 from his own salary and by borrowing money from other people. At about 5pm, Kay Yong received a call from a Malay man (ie,Mazlan), and arranged to meet him at Blk 31 Bendemeer Road. When he met up with Mazlan, Kay Yong handed him the money and told him to pass it to Ah Boy. Kay Yong said that Mazlan then asked him to open his bag. He asked why, but Mazlan told him to “just open [his] bag”. Mazlan then threw something inside the bag. Feeling that “something was wrong”, Kay Yong quickly turned away and walked towards his block. While he was at his block, he had started running when he heard “running sounds” because he “felt something wrong”.69Foot Note 69×ABD, p 342, paras 6–7. 29 It should be noted that it was in this first long statement that Kay Yong mentioned for the first time that he thought that the Malay guy “had passed [him] either a debt book or ‘pei hoon’”.70Foot Note 70×ABD, p 342, para 6.Peihoonis a street name for heroin. When questioned about why he thought someone might have passed him heroin, Kay Yong stated the following: I heard a plastic sound when the Malay guy threw the item in my bag. I suspected it could also be ‘pei hoon’ because ‘Ah Boy’ had asked me to help him with his drug business many times before. I had never agreed to it so he might have decided to just push it to me directly and make me do it. … About a year ago, ‘Ah Boy’ has ever talked to me about starting a drug syndicate here. He wants me to push a variety of drugs. … ‘Ah Boy’ kept calling me on this issue because I have a gambling debt with him. I always reject ‘Ah Boy’ whenever he calls me to start a drug syndicate because my mum is old and I am not interested in doing this. 30 The pertinent aspect of Kay Yong’s second long statement is that this is where he mentioned for the first time that he himself smokedpeihoon. Kay Yong stated that he had smokedpeihoonat about noon on the day of his arrest, and had been regularly smoking about two straws a day since May 2015. He would purchase a packet ofpeihoonabout once a week from different suppliers at Toa Payoh Lorong 5. Each packet ofpeihoonweighed about 8g and cost him about $180. Kay Yong also said in this statement that he had “relapsed” into smokingpeihoonbecause of the pressure and stress he felt as a result of owing money to Ah Boy. He claimed he still owed Ah Boy $30,000 out of an original debt of $50,000 accumulated from horse and soccer betting, and from other people who had failed to pay him after placing bets.71Foot Note 71×ABD, pp 345–346. 31 Kay Yong’s third long statement elaborated on his interactions with Ah Boy. In particular, he claimed that after the 2014 World Cup ended, Ah Boy had repeatedly asked him to repay $58,000 which he owed for soccer bets. Kay Yong further asserted that, in response to these repeated requests, he had repaid Ah Boy as and when he was able to do so.72Foot Note 72×ABD, p 348, para 29.He said that he had never met Ah Boy personally. Rather, Ah Boy would call him two to three times a week to chase him for payment. If Kay Yong had some money, he would agree to pay. When this happened, on the following day, he would receive a call from a stranger, who would arrange to meet him at the void deck of Blk 31 Bendemeer Road to collect the money. Each time a different person would call him and meet him to collect the payment from him. After payment was made, Ah Boy would call him and acknowledge receipt of the payment.73Foot Note 73×ABD, pp 348–349, paras 31–32. 32 Kay Yong surmised that Ah Boy may have gotten Mazlan to send him drugs to push him into dealing in drugs because he had failed to make any debt repayment since the start of the year.74Foot Note 74×ABD, p 349, paras 34–35.He further alleged that there had been six to seven occasions in which Ah Boy had previously sent people to knock on the door of the Bendemeer Flat at 3am in the morning. On one of these occasions, he had opened the door to find three strangers, one of whom handed him a mobile phone. Ah Boy was on the line and told Kay Yong “not to run away if not [Ah Boy] will burn [Kay Yong’s] house down”.75Foot Note 75×ABD, p 349, para 32. 33 In his third long statement, Kay Yong was asked what he would have done with the packet of drugs (Exhibit A1A1A) if he had not been caught by the CNB. He gave the following answer: “I would have smoked a bit and flush the rest down the toilet. I may contact ‘Ah Boy’ and ask him about this but I will not take the risk to return it to him because he was the one who forced it upon me. If he wants to play rough, I will just stop paying him the rest of the debt. I will not keep the packet with me as my mother may find out and it is never safe to have drugs at home.”76Foot Note 76×ABD, p 350, para 36. 34 The material aspects of Kay Yong’s fourth long statement were as follows: Kay Yong stated “the Malay man” (ie,Mazlan) had asked him to bring a bag, and had told him that Ah Boy had “something to give [him]”. He alleged that he “did not know what the thing [was]”, and thought that it was a debt book for online bets”. He reiterated that he had run when he heard CNB officers approaching “because [he] thought [he] was carrying a debt book which is also illegal”. Again, he stated that he had thought that the “thing” Mazlan had passed him might bepeihoonbecause Ah Boy had previously offered himpeihoonand asked him to help him sell it.77Foot Note 77×ABD, pp 399–400. 35 It was clear from Kay Yong’s oral testimony that the statements which he gave to the CNB were recorded in a question and answer format.78Foot Note 78×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, pp 59 (lines 23, 29–30) and 65 (lines 18–19, 31); Certified Transcript, 12 October 2017, p 52 (lines 12–15).As we shall see, Kay Yong has emphasised this point several times to explain why he did not mention certain facts which were key to his defence. 36 For completeness, I note that Mazlan provided a contemporaneous statement,79Foot Note 79×ABD, p 243–245.a cautioned statement,80Foot Note 80×ABD, pp 305–307.and six long statements to various CNB Officers.81Foot Note 81×ABD, pp 371–378, 282–285, 286–300, 379–387, 411–416 and 417–420 respectively.However, for present purposes it was unnecessary to delve into the contents of these statements because, as I explain below, Mazlan did not challenge the Prosecution’s version of events, nor did he challenge the position he had taken in the long statements which he provided to CNB.82Foot Note 82×Certified Transcript, 19 July 2017, p 4 (lines 15–17).",
        "The Prosecution’s case": "",
        "The case against Kay Yong": "37 Bearing in mind that the presumptions in ss 17 and 18 of the MDA could not be applied conjunctively (Tang Hai Liang v Public Prosecutor[2011] SGCA 38 at [18]–[19], the Prosecution advanced two alternative cases for making out the offence of possession for the purpose of trafficking against Kay Yong. The primary case 38 The Prosecution’s primary case was that it had proven beyond reasonable doubt that Kay Yong was in possession of the drugs and knew their nature, without any need to rely on the presumptions in s 18 of the MDA. The Prosecution then sought to rely on the presumption in s 17(c) of the MDA –ie, that Kay Yong was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, since he was in possession of more than 2g of diamorphine. 39 With regard to the element of possession, the Prosecution argued that Kay Yong had physical custody of the Plastic Bag. It cited the case ofWarner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner[1969] 2 AC 256 (“Warner”) for the proposition that “[a person] who receives physical custody of a package or container has possession of its contents if he does not dispose of the contents after having had a reasonable opportunity to examine them.”83Foot Note 83×Prosecution’s closing submissions, paras 25–26.Kay Yong had a “reasonable opportunity” to examine the contents of the Plastic Bag, and did not dispose of them. Therefore, he was in possession of the Plastic Bag and its contents.84Foot Note 84×Prosecution’s closing submissions, para 29. 40 The Prosecution further argued that Kay Yong had knowledge of the contents of the Plastic Bag, and knew that Exhibit A1A1A contained diamorphine. In this regard, the Prosecution argued that Kay Yong knew that the Plastic Bag contained “the packet of heroin thathe hadordered from Ah Boy,” [emphasis added] in light of the following facts:85Foot Note 85×Prosecution’s closing submissions, paras 34–35. (a) Kay Yong expected to receive “stuff” from Mazlan. (b) There was no reason for Ah Boy to send the drugs to Kay Yong if he had not ordered them. (c) The circumstances in which Kay Yong received the Plastic Bag were highly suspicious. (d) Kay Yong had ample time to check the contents of the Plastic Bag. (e) Kay Yong had attempted to flee when he saw the CNB officers. 41 The Prosecution also contended that Kay Yong’s exculpatory claims relating to his gambling debts and debt collection activities were not credible. Thus his explanation as to why he had met Mazlan, paid Mazlan a sum of money, and received the drugs should be disbelieved.86Foot Note 86×Prosecution’s closing submissions, paras 54–67. 42 As for the element of possession for the purpose of trafficking, the Prosecution relied on the presumption in s 17(c) of the MDA and averred that Kay Yong had adduced no evidence to rebut the presumption. That is, there was no evidence that the drugs were intended for Kay Yong’s own consumption or for any purpose other than trafficking. It was further argued that the presumption was reinforced by two facts:87Foot Note 87×Prosecution’s closing submissions, para 72. (a)  First, Kay Yong had received 459.4g of heroin, which was a large quantity of drugs far in excess of the 8g of heroin he claimed to have been consuming on a weekly basis at the time. (b) Secondly, the drugs were very costly relative to Kay Yong’s legitimate sources of income. He had spent at least $3,000 to purchase the drugs, which was 2.4 times his monthly take-home pay. It was implausible that Kay Yong would have spent such a large sum of money on the drugs if he did not intend to sell them. Further, based on the retail value of the drugs, he stood to gain a profit in excess of $7,000 if he sold the drugs. The alternative case 43 The Prosecution’s alternative case was that it could rely on the presumptions in ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA to establish Kay Yong’s possession of the drugs and his knowledge of their nature. On this case, the Prosecution could not rely on the presumption in s 17(c) of the MDA. The Prosecution contended that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Kay Yong was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking.88Foot Note 88×Prosecution’s closing submissions, para 22.This was based on the same two facts said to “reinforce” the presumption of trafficking (see [42(a)] and [42(b)] above).89Foot Note 89×Prosecution’s closing submissions, para 83 read with paras 71–72.",
        "The case against Mazlan": "44 The Prosecution’s case against Mazlan was straightforward. Mazlan had admitted that he was in possession of the drugs from the time that he collected them from Mani at Tuas Avenue 11 until he delivered them to Kay Yong at Blk 31 Bendemeer Road. He had also admitted that he knew that the drugs were heroin, and that he delivered the drugs to Kay Yong. There was no evidence to show that he was authorised under the MDA to deliver the drugs to Kay Yong. Thus, the Prosecution argued that the elements of the offence of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA – possession, knowledge of the nature of the drugs, trafficking and the absence of authorisation – were all made out.",
        "Kay Yong’s defence": "45 Broadly speaking, Kay Yong’s defence was in line with the narrative he had given in his various statements to the CNB. He claimed that he had met Mazlan on 20 July 2015 to repay a debt to Ah Boy.90Foot Note 90×First accused’s closing submissions, paras 3 and 24; Certified Transcript for 12 October 2017, p 82 (lines 14–15).Ah Boy had called him on 17 July 2015 to chase him for an instalment of $3,800,91Foot Note 91×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, pp 22 (line 32) and 23 (lines 2–4).which was meant to be a partial payment of the $38,000 that Kay Yong still owed to Ah Boy from bets he had placed during the 2014World Cup.92Foot Note 92×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, pp 19 (lines 5–7) and 20 (lines 6–7) and 24 (lines 1–5).By 20 July 2015, Kay Yong had only managed to raise $3,000 to repay Ah Boy.93Foot Note 93×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, p 23 (lines 8–12).In the morning of 20 July 2015, Ah Boy asked Kay Yong to raise an additional “$500 plus $100 as transport expenses” for the person who would be coming to collect the debt.94Foot Note 94×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, p 23 (lines 14–15).At 5pm that day, Kay Yong called Ah Boy and informed him that he had raised the money, and told him to send someone to collect the money.95Foot Note 95×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, p 24 (lines 4–5). 46 During this phone call, Ah Boy told Kay Yong that he “[needed] [Kay Yong] to do something” and that “a guy [would] tell [him] what to do”.96Foot Note 96×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, p 24 (lines 20–21)He also told Kay Yong to call a Malay man (ie, Mazlan) to pass him the money and for the “Malay man” to “give [Kay Yong] the job”.97Foot Note 97×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, p 25 (lines 15–20).At trial, Kay Yong stated that based on his previous debt collection activities for Ah Boy,98Foot Note 98×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, p 50 (lines 29–31).he understood what Ah Boy had said to mean that Ah Boy wanted him to collect debts,99Foot Note 99×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, p 24 (lines 20–30).and that he should expect to receive a debt book.100Foot Note 100×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, p 25 (lines 3–5). 47 Based on Kay Yong’s version of events, the Defence contended that Kay Yong was not liable for the offence of possession for the purpose of trafficking. 48 In response to the Prosecution’s primary case, the Defence argued that, without relying on the presumption in s 18(1) of the MDA, the Prosecution could not establish that Kay Yong was in possession of the drugs.101Foot Note 101×First accused’s closing submissions, para 97.In this regard, the Defence citedTanKiam Peng v PP[2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“TanKiam Peng”) for the proposition that a person is not in possession of a thing if he or she believes it “to be something of a wholly different nature” (at [50]). The Defence submitted that, since Kay Yong had met with Mazlan expecting to repay a debt and to receive a debt book, Kay Yong believed that the Plastic Bag contained a debt book. The most that could be said was that he may have suspected that the Plastic Bag contained drugs, but suspicion was insufficient to establish the mental element of possession.102Foot Note 102×First accused’s closing submissions, paras 101–103.For similar reasons, the Defence argued that Kay Yong also did not have the requisite knowledge of the nature of the drugs. It was further submitted that even on the Prosecution’salternativecase – which relied on the presumptions in ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA, Kay Yong had raised sufficient evidence to rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge on a balance of probabilities. 49  The Defence further argued that Kay Yong was not in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. It was emphasised that no drug trafficking paraphernalia was found, whether in the Bendemeer Flat or the Ang Mo Kio Flat, and that the only evidence going towards whether Kay Yong intended to traffic the drugs was the sheer quantity of heroin found in his possession.103Foot Note 103×Certified Transcript, 12 October 2017, p 21 (lines 13–16).Responding to the Prosecution’s alternative case (which required the Prosecution to prove that the accused possessed the drugs for the purposes of trafficking without relying on the presumption concerning trafficking in s 17 of the MDA), the Defence took the position that, in the absence of other evidence, the sheer quantity of the drugs can never be sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused possessed the drugs for the purpose of trafficking.104Foot Note 104×Certified Transcript, 12 October 2017, pp 21 (lines 26–31) and 25 (lines 9–13). 50 The Defence argued that even if I were to accept the Prosecution’s primary case and find that possession and knowledge of the drugs were established beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore the Prosecution could avail itself of the presumption in s 17 of the MDA, Kay Yong had rebutted that presumption. To that end, the Defence highlighted the evidence concerning Kay Yong’s own consumption of heroin at the time of his arrest, and his diagnosis of “severe opioid disorder”.105Foot Note 105×First accused’s closing submissions, para 122.Based on this evidence, the Defence urged me to believe Kay Yong’s oral evidence that he would have kept about a third of the drugs for his own consumption, and discarded the rest.106Foot Note 106×First accused’s closing submissions, para 122. 51 In the alternative, the Defence submitted that even if I did not believe that Kay Yong would have discarded the bulk of the drugs, Kay Yong should be given “the benefit of the doubt” that he would have smoked about one third and sold the remainder of the drugs. The Defence thus argued that I should convict Kay Yong on the basis that he possessed for the purpose of trafficking onlytwo thirdsof the 18.71g of diamorphine found in his possession.",
        "Mazlan’s defence": "52 Mazlan’s evidence was comparatively straightforward. His version of events was that, after Mani had “pestered” him to assist in making drug deliveries several times, he eventually agreed to help Mani deliver two pounds of heroin to Mani’s customers in return for a reward.107Foot Note 107×Second accused’s closing submissions, para 8(j).He told Mani that this would be the first and last time that he would assist Mani. Mazlan collected two pounds of heroin from Mani, one of which he delivered to Kay Yong. He kept the other pound of heroin with him and was awaiting Mani’s instructions in relation to this second pound of heroin at the point when he was arrested.108Foot Note 108×Second accused’s closing submissions, para 8(b). 53 Mazlan did not dispute that his transporting and delivering the drugs to Kay Yong were acts constituting “trafficking” within the definition in s 2 of the MDA.109Foot Note 109×Second accused’s closing submissions, para 20.His defence was essentially that he was a mere courier and was, at all times, acting under Mani’s instructions. In this regard, the Defence emphasised the following points: (a) Mazlan’s activities were restricted to acts “preparatory to or for the purpose of transporting, sending or delivering” the drugs.110Foot Note 110×Second accused’s closing submissions, para 19.There was no evidence that Mazlan had been involved in any repacking of the drugs, or any activities other than moving the drugs from point A to point B.111Foot Note 111×Second accused’s closing submissions, para 13. (b) Although Mazlan had been involved in collecting money from Kay Yong, this did not take him outside of the role of a “courier”, because the collection of such money was merely incidental to the delivery of the drugs.112Foot Note 112×Second accused’s closing submissions, para 15.",
        "Decision with respect to Kay Yong": "",
        "The law on possession of a controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking": "54 InMasoudRahimi bin Mehrzad v PP and another appeal[2017] 1 SLR 257 at [28], the Court of Appeal noted that the elements of the offence of possession of a controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking are as follows: (a) Possession of a controlled drug – which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(1) of the MDA. (b) Knowledge of thenatureof the drug – which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA. (c) Proof that possession of the drug was for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised. 55 The final element of the offence –ie,that the accused must have possessed the drugs for the purpose of trafficking – may also be established pursuant to the presumption concerning trafficking in s 17 of the MDA (“the presumption concerning trafficking”). I note that the quantity of diamorphine in issue was 18.71g, which is clearly in excess of the 2g of diamorphine required to raise the presumption concerning trafficking in s 17(c) of the MDA. However, as the Prosecution readily acknowledged (see [37] above), whether the Prosecution could avail itself of the presumption concerning trafficking was subject to the rule that the Prosecution may not rely on both the presumptions in ss 17 and 18 of the MDA conjunctively (Tang Hai Liang v PP[2011] SGCA 38 at [18]–[19]).",
        "Was Kay Yong in possession of the drugs?": "Actual possession 56 I first address the Prosecution’s primary case, which was that the evidence was sufficient to prove that Kay Yong was in possession of the drugs without relying on the presumption in s 18 of the MDA. 57 As noted by the Court of Appeal inHishamrudinbin Mohd v PP[2017] SGCA 41(“Hishamrudin”) at [18], two elements must be satisfied in order to prove actual possession: (a) that the accused person had physical control over the controlled drugs; and (b) that the accused person knew of the nature of the controlled drugs. Knowledge of “the nature of the controlled drugs” in this context refers to knowledge that the itemswere controlled drugs, and not knowledge of thespecific natureof the drug in question (Hishamrudinat [18], citingFunSeong Cheng v PP[1997] 2 SLR 796 at [53]–[56] andTanKiam Peng v PP[2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 at [87]). It is trite that if the Prosecution does not avail itself of the presumption of possession in s 18(1) of the MDA, it must prove the elements of possession beyond reasonable doubt (see for instanceHishamrudinat [16]). 58 The Defence did not dispute, and I was satisfied, that Kay Yong was in physical control of the drugs.113Foot Note 113×Certified Transcript, 12 October 2017, p 30 (lines 30–31).Mazlan had delivered the Plastic Bag to Kay Yong. From the point where he had met Mazlan, Kay Yong had carried the Black Bag containing the Plastic Bag as he walked to the fourth floor of Blk 31 Bendemeer Road.114Foot Note 114×Certified Transcript, 20 July 2017, p 9 (lines 2–8).He also continued to carry the Black Bag containing the Plastic Bag as he fled from the CNB officers,115Foot Note 115×Certified Transcript, 20 July 2017, pp 9 (lines 2) to 11 (line 25).releasing it only after he landed in a fall (see [16] above). Thus, the first element of physical control was made out. 59 The key question concerned the second element of possession –ie, whether the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Kay Yong knew that the contents of the Plastic Bag consisted of controlled drugs. Having weighed the evidence, I was of the view that this question should be answered in the affirmative. 60 The Court of Appeal recently made the following observations inHarvena/l Segar v PP[2017] 1 SLR 771 (“Harven”)at [17]: In every instance where an accused claims that he did not know that what he was carrying contained drugs, the court will have to carefully scrutinise all the pertinent facts – this being a highly fact-sensitive inquiry – in determining whether he has discharged the burden of rebutting the presumption of knowledge, including (inter alia) his background, how he received the drugs, how they were packed and how he handled or dealt with them. Ultimately, what the court is concerned with is the credibility and veracity of the accused’s account and how believable that account is. 61 The above remarks were clearly made in a different context where the Court of Appeal was concerned with whether or not the accused had managed to rebut thepresumption of knowledgeunder s 18(2) of the MDA. Nevertheless, I consider that the same principles are applicable where the Prosecution seeks to prove that the accused hadactualknowledge that an item in his physical control was a controlled drug, and the accused claims that he did not know that what he was carrying contained a controlled drug. That is, the court must “scrutinise all the pertinent facts”, including the accused’s background and how he received the drugs, to assess “the credibility and veracity of the accused’s account”. These principles are applicable to my assessment of whether the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Kay Yong knew that the Plastic Bag he was carrying contained a controlled drug. 62 Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not require the Prosecution to meet a standard of absolute certainty (Mohammed Ali binJohari v PP[2008] 5 SLR(R) 1058 (“Mohammed Ali BinJohari”) at [84], citingJagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45). However, the evidence must be such that it excludes “material” or “real” doubts. “Merely fanciful” doubts or “fanciful or remote possibilities” may be disregarded (Mohammed Ali BinJohariat [82] and [83]). 63 I was essentially faced with two different narratives. The first narrative was the Prosecution’s case that Kay Yong hadorderedthe drugs from Ah Boy (see [40] above). On this version of events, Kay Yong knew that the Plastic Bag contained drugs because that was exactly what he had expected to receive upon meeting Mazlan. The second, competing narrative was Kay Yong’s case that he had met with Mazlan expecting to pay a gambling debt and to receive a debt book for the purpose of carrying out debt collection activities for Ah Boy (see [45]–[46] above). The question was whether, on the evidence, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Prosecution’s narrative represented the truth. 64 I was of the view that the evidence overwhelmingly supported the Prosecution’s narrative, while Kay Yong’s competing narrative was unsubstantiated and insufficient to ground a “reasonable” doubt. This was based on the following factors. 65 The first factor was this. There was no credible reason why Mani (or Ah Boy) would have instructed Mazlan to deliver to Kay Yong a packet of drugs worth thousands of dollars if Kay Yong had not ordered them. The Prosecution highlighted Kay Yong’s statement that he was regularly purchasing, for his own consumption, 8g packets of heroinfor about $180 (see [30] above). Based on these figures, the 459.4g of heroin found in Kay Yong’s possession would have yielded about 57 of such 8g packets, which would have had a value in excess of $10,000.116Foot Note 116×Prosecution’s closing submissions, para 40. 66 The Defence took issue with the Prosecution’s reliance on this extrapolation, arguing that Kay Yong’s evidence concerning the value of heroin he was purchasingapplied to “different suppliers figure and a different context”, and could form no basis for determining the value of the drugs which were the subject of the charge.117Foot Note 117×Certified Transcript, 12 October 2017, p 59 (lines 5–14).It was suggested that the drugs found in Kay Yong’s possession may have been of a very different market value because they were of a “low purity”, given that over 400g of granular substance only yielded 18.71g of diamorphine.118Foot Note 118×Certified Transcript, 12 October 2017, p 59 (lines 15–17).I was not persuaded by this. No evidence was led concerning the purity of the heroin concerned relative to what is normally available in Singapore. I took judicial notice of the fact that heroin is normally sold as a mixture of diamorphine and other substances. The purity of the heroin found in Kay Yong’s possession was about 4.07%. From the table below of reported recent cases involving heroin, such a level of purity is not at all incongruous with the norm: Case NameWeight of drug mixtureWeight of pure diamorphinePurity1PP v Pandian a/l Subramaniam[2017] SGHC 551,152.10g40.53g3.52%2PP v Abdul Wahid bin Ismail[2017] SGHC 871343.40g46.64g3.47%3PP v Suhaimi bin Said[2017] SGHC 861747.04g45.58g2.61%4PP v Ng Peng Chong and another[2017] SGHC 99902.80g21.58g2.39%5PP v Zamri Bin Mohd Tahir[2017] SGHC 791835.50g40.37g2.20%6PP v Abd Helmi bin Ab Halim[2017] SGHC 134452.00g16.56g3.66%7PP v Pannir Selvam Pranthaman[2017] SGHC 1441833.20g51.84g2.83%8PP v Dominic Martin Fernandez and another[2017] SGHC 226906.40g35.41g3.91% 67 There was, of course, no evidence before me concerning the purity of the diamorphineKay Yonghad been purchasing for his own consumption. I accept that there wassomedoubt over the precise market value of the drugs in this case. Nevertheless, even though it was not possible to ascertain the value of the drugs with mathematical precision, Kay Yong’s statement concerning the price at which he was purchasingpeihoonoffered ample evidence to support a finding that the drugs found in his possession were highly valuable. They would have been worth thousands of dollars. The inference that the drugs were very valuable was buttressed by the fact that Mani had offered Mazlan $200 simply to transport and deliver one pound of the drugs.119Foot Note 119×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 41 (lines 10–14). 68 Given that the drugs were highly valuable, I agreed with the Prosecution that it was extremely unlikely that Mani would have handed them to Kay Yong if the latter had not ordered them. As against that, Kay Yong’s version of events would require me to accept that, notwithstanding the fact that he owed Ah Boy some $38,000 in gambling debts and Ah Boy had not only refused to extend credit to him,120Foot Note 120×ABD, p348, para 29 to 31but was hounding him for repayment, Ah Boy would be willing to foist upon him thousands of dollars’ worth of drugs on credit, in the hope that Kay Yong would sell them to raise cash to repay Ah Boy.121Foot Note 121×First accused’s closing submissions, para 78.Indeed, according to Kay Yong, the purpose of meeting up with Mazlan was to repay part his debt to Mani. In those circumstances, I find it highly unlikely that Mani would further extend credit to Kay Yong as he claimed. 69 The second factor concerned the inconsistencies between Kay Yong’s statements to the CNB and his oral evidence. 70 Kay Yong did not dispute that he spoke to Mazlan over the phone prior to their meeting.122Foot Note 122×First accused’s closing submissions, para 41.Kay Yong’s own evidence was that during this phone call, he had asked Mazlan if the latter had anything to pass to him.123Foot Note 123×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, p 79 (line 11).In his second long statement, recorded on 25 July 2015, Mazlan said that Kay Yong had “asked if I got the stuff and if I am sending it to him”.124Foot Note 124×ABD, p 283, para 7.On the other hand, in cross-examination, Kay Yong was adamant that he had not used the word “stuff”.125Foot Note 125×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, p 79 (lines 15–17).Yet whatever the exact words spoken may have been, the evidence demonstrated that Kay Yong met Mazlan with the Black Bag expecting to receivean item. I saw no reason to disbelieve the evidence of Suhana and Mazlan that Kay Yong had said “Just put inside here” when he met up with Mazlan (see [13] above). Such evidence was consistent witheitherthe Prosecution’s narrative that Kay Yong was expecting to receive drugs,orthe Defence’s narrative that he was expecting a debt book. The question was what Kay Yong actually expected to receive. 71 Kay Yong’s position in oral evidence was clearly that, after speaking to Ah Boy at about 5pm on 20 July 2015, he was expecting to receive a debt book. Indeed, his evidence was that even though Ah Boy did not actuallysaythat he should expect a debt book, he simply understood, based on his previous experiences collecting debts for Ah Boy, that this was what Ah Boy was referring to by saying things such as “a guy will tell you what to do” and Ah Boy’s instruction that he should call a Malay man “for him to give [Kay Yong] the job”.126Foot Note 126×Certified transcript, 27 July 2017, p 25 (lines 3–5, 16–18).Having regard to Kay Yong’s statements, however, I concluded that his claim that he was expecting to receive a debt book was a mere afterthought. The relevant parts of Kay Yong’s statements are as follows: (a) In his contemporaneous statement, when Kay Yong was asked what was inside “these two packets”, his answer was: “I don’t know. I handed money to him and he threw things inside my bag.” [emphasis added] (see [21] above). There was no mention of any debt book, or indeed, of expecting to receive anything at all. (b) In his cautioned statement, Kay Yong stated that when “the Malay” had asked him to open his handbag, he had “asked…why”. Again, the impression given by this statement was that Kay Yong was not expecting to receive anything at all (see [27] above). (c) In his first long statement, Kay Yong again asserted that when Mazlan asked him to bring a bag down, he had “asked him why”.  Notably it was in this statement, recorded some ten days after his arrest, that Kay Yong mentioned a “debt book” for the first time, and said, “Ithinkthe Malay guy had passed me either a debt book or ‘peihoon’” (see [29] above).127Foot Note 127×ABD, p 342, para 6. (d) In his fourth long statement, Kay Yong mentioned that the “Malay man” had told him that “Ah Boy had something to give [him]”, but he went on to say that he “did not know whatthe thing [was]and thought it was a debt book for online bets” [emphasis added] (see [34] above). 72 The impression given by Kay Yong’s first and fourth long statements is that he was not expecting to receive anything, but hesuspectedthat Mazlan may have passed him a debt book.  This differed from the position he had taken in oral evidence, which was that he had understood, even without explicit mention from Ah Boy, that he should expect to receive a debt book for the purpose of carrying out debt collection activities. 73 In view of Kay Yong’s shifting positions between his statements and his oral evidence, I was unable to accept Kay Yong’s claim that he was expecting to receive a debt book when he met with Mazlan. Crucially, the following passage from Kay Yong’s cautioned statement showed that he knew,at the point of his arrest, that he had been found in possession of “a packet of powder”: “When they held me down and told meabout a packet of powder, I then realized what happened and that ‘Boy’ had set me up.” [emphasis added].128Foot Note 128×ABD, p 633. 74 Seen in this context, Kay Yong’s explanation that he may not have mentioned the debt book to SSI Tony because when he was arrested he had been shown the white powder and he was “not thinking about the debt books”129Foot Note 129×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017 p62 (lines 9–10).beggared belief. On the contrary, one would have thought that if Kay Yong had expected to receive a debt book but had realised upon his arrest that what he was carrying was actually a “packet of powder”, he would have taken the first opportunity to offer this exculpatory explanation in his contemporaneous statement. That is all the more so given that Kay Yong was a person who has had dealings with drugs (see [30] above) and, based on his statements, obviously understood the gravity and possible implications of being found in possession of the drugs. For example, in his third long statement, Kay Yong stated the following: Qns: If CNB had not arrested you that day, what would you have done with the packet of drug? Ans: I would have smoked a bit and flush the rest down the toilet. I may contact ‘Ah Boy’ and ask him about this butI will not take the risk to return it to himbecause he was the one who forced it upon me. … I will not keep the packet with me as my mother may find outand it is never safe to have drugs at home. [emphasis added] 75 Yet instead of explaining that he had expected to receive a debt book, in his contemporaneous statement, Kay Yong simply stated that he “[did not] know” what was inside the packet. Similarly, in his cautioned statement, which was recorded some seven days after his arrest, Kay Yong did not state that he was expecting to receive a debt book. 76 Even when Kay Yong eventually mentioned a “debt book” in his first and fourth long statements, he didnotsay that this was what he had been expecting to receive from Mazlan based on Ah Boy’s instructions. These statements suggested instead that Kay Yong was either not expecting to receive anything at all, or that he was at least unclear about what he should expect to receive. 77 I therefore found that Kay Yong’s claim that he had met with Mazlan expecting to receive a debt book from Ah Boy was not credible. 78 The third reason that I was unable to accept Kay Yong’s version of events had to do with his lack of credibility as a witness. I found that his evidence was fraught with significant inconsistencies. A key plank of Kay Yong’s defence was that he had a laptop in the Bendemeer Flat which he used for online gambling. Kay Yong claimed that this laptop would have supported his claim that he had met Mazlan in the evening of 20 July 2015 for the purpose of repaying a gambling debt owed to Ah Boy.130Foot Note 130×First accused’s closing submissions, para 4; Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, pp 47 (line 9)–48 (line 11).However, this laptop was not mentioned in any of the statements which Kay Yong had provided to the CNB, despite the fact that IO Huang had specifically questioned Kay Yong about his online gambling activities when he recorded Kay Yong’s fourth long statement on 3 March 2016.131Foot Note 131×Certified Transcript, 21 July 2017, p 79 (lines 26–27)This was another factor which led me to disbelieve Kay Yong’s exculpatory claims. 79 To support the claim that Kay Yong knew that he was carrying drugs at the point of his arrest, the Prosecution has cited two other factors:132Foot Note 132×Prosecution’s closing submissions, para 35. (a) The fact that Kay Yong had desperately attempted to flee upon noticing the CNB officers. (b) The fact that, despite having received the Plastic Bag under suspicious circumstances, Kay Yong had “ample time” to check the contents of the Plastic Bag but did not do so. 80 With regard to Kay Yong’s attempt to flee, I agreed with the Defence that this was arguably consistent with Kay Yong’s claim that he believed that he was carrying a debt book, which was also an illegal item.133Foot Note 133×First accused’s closing submissions, para 81.Nevertheless, I noted that Kay Yong had fled immediately upon noticing the CNB officers despite the fact that they were in plain clothes, and that he also went as far as to leap from the staircase landing immediately preceding the ground floor in his attempt to escape the CNB officers (see [15] above). Taken alongside the other evidence, I agreed that the desperate manner in which Kay Yong fled did support the inference that he knew that he was carrying a controlled drug rather than a mere debt book. 81 As for the argument that Kay Yong had “ample time” to check the contents of the Plastic Bag but did not do so, I did not agree with the Prosecution that this supported a finding that Kay Yong had knowledge that he was carrying controlled drugs. To begin with, by the Prosecution’s own evidence, it would have taken Kay Yong at most three to four minutes to walk from the point where he had met Mazlan to the fourth floor of Blk 31 Bendemeer Road.134Foot Note 134×Prosecution’s closing submissions, para 29.This was an extremely short period of time, and I failed to see what could be made of the fact that Kay Yong did not check the contents of the Plastic Bag during those several minutes. 82 Nevertheless, based on the other factors I have mentioned at [65]–[80] above, I was satisfied that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Kay Yong had met with Mazlan expecting to receive the drugs because he had ordered them from Ah Boy. I therefore found that the second element of possession,viz, knowledge that the item contained a controlled drug, was made out. Presumed possession and knowledge 83 Although it was not necessary, in light of my findings on actual possession, to consider the question of the presumption in s 18(1)(a) of the MDA on the Prosecution’s alternative case, for completeness, I should state that the presumption of possession clearly did arise in the present case, and was not successfully rebutted. 84 Under s 18(1)(a) of the MDA, a person who is proved to have had in his possession, custody or control “anything containing a controlled drug” is presumed to have had that drug in his possession until the contrary is proved. As noted by the Court of Appeal inObengComfort v PP[2017] 1 SLR 633 (“ObengComfort”) at [34], in order to raise the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA, two elements must be satisfied: (a) the “container containing a controlled drug” must exist; and (b) the accused must have had possession, control or custody of such container. The accused need not know that the item is a controlled drug (ObengComfortat [34]). Once the accused is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession, he is then presumed to know thenatureof that drug under s 18(2) of the MDA – which refers to the nature of the specific controlled drug found in his possession (ObengComfortat [35], citingNagaenthrana/l K Dharmalingam v PP[2011] 4 SLR 1156 (“Nagaenthran”) at [23]–[24]). 85 There was no doubt that the Plastic Bag was a “container containing a controlled drug” and that it was within Kay Yong’s possession, custody and control (for the reasons stated at [58] above, concerning Kay Yong’s physical control of the Plastic Bag). For the same reasons stated at [65]–[80] above, the presumption of possession was not rebutted. Thus, on the Prosecution’s alternative case, Kay Yong would be presumed to be in possession of the drugs and to have knowledge of their specific nature.",
        "Did Kay Yong have actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs?": "86 As the Prosecution had accepted,135Foot Note 135×Prosecution’s closing submissions, para 31without the presumptions in s 18(2) of the MDA, the element of knowledge of the nature of the drug requires proof that the accused knew of the nature of the actual drug in his possession – for instance, that it was diamorphine or methamphetamine (Nagaenthranat [24] andObengComfortat [35]). In this case, the question was whether Kay Yong knew that the packet which he received in the Plastic Bag contained diamorphine. 87 I found that the same evidence which established Kay Yong’s knowledge that he was carrying controlled drugs (for the purpose of establishing possession) also led to the conclusion that Kay Yong knew that he was in possession of diamorphine specifically. Apart from the evidence discussed at [65]–[80] above, the finding that Kay Yong specifically knew that he was receiving heroin which he had ordered from Ah Boy through Mazlan was buttressed by the following factors: (a) Kay Yong was familiar with, and had many previous dealings with heroin. He admitted that he had about five to tenpeihoonclients in the past.136Foot Note 136×ABD, p 342, para 10.He was also regularly purchasing and consumingpeihoonon a weekly basis at the time of his arrest (see [30] above). (b) Kay Yong had stated in his first and fourth long statements that he suspected that the item he received from Mazlan may have beenpeihoon(see [28] and [34] above). When questioned about why he thought Mazlan may have passed himpeihoon, Kay Yong stated the following in his first long statement: I suspected it could be ‘peihoon’ because ‘Ah Boy’ had asked me to help him with his drug business many times before. I had never agreed to it so he might have decided to just push it to me directly and make me do it. 88 The above factors supported the conclusion that Kay Yong knew that Ah Boy dealt inpeihoon, and that, having ordered the drugs from Ah Boy, he knew and expected that he would be receivingpeihoonwhen he met with Mazlan on 20 July 2015.",
        "Was Kay Yong in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking?": "89 I turn now to address the final element of the offence –ie,that the accused must have been in possession of the controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking. Since I have found that the Prosecution had proven the elements of possession and knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt, the Prosecution was able to rely on the presumption concerning trafficking. As mentioned above, the quantity of 18.71g in question was far in excess of the 2g of diamorphine required to raise the presumption in s 17(c) of the MDA. The question was whether or not Kay Yong had managed to rebut the presumption concerning trafficking on a balance of probabilities. 90 The Defence argued that Kay Yong would have consumed a third of the drugs and discarded the rest –ie, thatnoneof the drugs were intended for the purpose of trafficking. In the alternative, the Defence argued that Kay Yong would have consumed a third of the drugs andtraffickedthe rest, and should be convicted on the basis that he only possessed two-thirds of the total 18.71g quantity for the purpose of trafficking.137Foot Note 137×Certified Transcript, 12 October 2017, p 139 (lines 25–32).Having found that Kay Yong hadorderedthe drugs from Ah Boy (see [82] above), I was not persuaded that Kay Yong would have smoked a third and simply flushed the remainder down the toilet, as he had claimed in his third long statement. The only issue was whether he had proven on a balance of probabilities that he would have consumed one third and only possessed two thirds of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. 91 For the reasons that follow, I was of the view that Kay Yong had failed to rebut the presumption concerning trafficking. 92 As noted by the Court of Appeal inMuhammad bin Abdullah v PP and another appeal[2017] 1 SLR 427 (“Muhammad bin Abdullah”) at [29], where an accused relies on the defence of own consumption to rebut the presumption of possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court considers the overall circumstances of the case.  The factors which the courts have taken into account include: (a) Evidence concerning the accused’s rate of consumption and the number of days the supply is meant for (Jusribin Mohamed Hussain v PP[1996] 2 SLR(R) 706 at [62]–[63]). (b) The frequency of supply available to the accused (PP v Muhammad bin Abdullah[2015] SGHC 231 (“Muhammad bin Abdullah HC”) at [19]). (c) Whether the accused had the financial means to purchase the drugs for himself (Muhammad bin Abdullahat [31] citingPP v KwekSeow Hock[2009] SGHC 202 at [73]). 93 It was clear that Kay Yongwasconsuming heroin at the time of the offence. The IMH psychiatrist who examined Kay Yong, Dr Ng Lin Chieh, diagnosed him as suffering from Severe Opioid Use Disorder.138Foot Note 138×ABD, p 143.Kay Yong’s urine tested positive for morphine shortly after his arrest,139Foot Note 139×ABD, p 130.and the Prosecution did not dispute his claim that he had smokedpeihoonon the day of his arrest (see [30] above).140Foot Note 140×ABD, p 345.The Prosecution also did not dispute Kay Yong’s evidence that he was consuming about 8g of heroin a week,141Foot Note 141×Prosecution’s closing submissions, para 72(a).and was paying about $180 for each 8g packet. 94 At trial, Kay Yong testified that he would have taken one-third of the drugs found in his possession “because it would save [him] a lot of money.”142Foot Note 142×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, p 45 (line 5).At first blush, this was not inconceivable. The evidence showed that Kay Yong paid $3,000 to Mazlan for 459.4g of heroin (see [20] above). If Kay Yong had kept a third of the drugs for his own consumption, he would have 153g of heroin – which would have yielded about 19 8g packets – for about $1,000. If Kay Yong had bought 19 8g packets of heroin from his usual suppliers for $180 each, this would have cost him $3,420. Thus, Kay Yong stood to save a substantial sum of $2,420 from keeping a third of the drugs for his own consumption. Further, it was not implausible that a person of Kay Yong’s financial means would have spent a sum of $1,000 on this quantity of drugs. He was earning a gross pay of $1,500 a month, with a take-home salary of $1,231.50.143Foot Note 143×Certified Transcript, 27 July 2017, p 67 (lines 2–3).This was not a situation where the value of the drugs was so out of proportion to the accused’s limited financial means as to make it unlikely that he would have held, for his own consumption, the amount of drugs which he claimed that he would. 95 However, taking the evidence in the round, I found that Kay Yong had not proven that it was more likely than not that he would have kept a third of the drugs for his own consumption. This was in view of the fact that Kay Yong’sown evidencesuggested that he was not in the habit of stockpiling large quantities of drugs. In fact, in his long statement Kay Yong stated that he would not have kept the packet of drugs with him “as [his] mother may find outand it is never safe to have drugs at home” [emphasis added] (see [74] above). Unlike inMuhammad bin Abdullah HC, this was not a situation where the accused had adduced any evidence to suggest that he was usually in the habit of keeping and storing a certain quantity of drugs. Indeed, despite the fact that Kay Yong had smokedpeihoonon the day of his arrest, no drugs were found inside of the Bendemeer Flat.144Foot Note 144×ABD, p 175.I further noted that Kay Yong had given inconsistent evidence concerning the amount of drugs that he would have retained for his own consumption. While in oral evidence he said that he would have kept a third of the drugs, in his third long statement he said that he would have smoked only “a bit” and discarded the remainder. 96 Thus, I found that on the evidence, Kay Yong had failed to rebut the presumption concerning trafficking in respect of the full quantity of drugs found in his possession. 97 For completeness, I should add that with regard to the Prosecution’salternativecase, I would not have found that this element had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Given that no drug paraphernalia was found in either the Bendemeer Flat or the Ang Mo Kio Flat, and having regard to Kay Yong’s pattern of consumption and financial means, there was a “reasonable doubt” as to whether Kay Yong had intended to traffic the entire 459.4g of heroin found in his possession. However, that point is academic, since I had found that the Prosecution’s primary case was made out. 98 As the elements of the charge against Kay Yong had been made out, I convicted him of the charge and imposed the mandatory sentence of death.",
        "Decision with respect to Mazlan": "99 The elements of the offence of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA are as follows: (a) Possession of the drugs;(b) Knowledge of the nature of the drugs;(c) Trafficking; and(d) The absence of authorisation. 100 As I have mentioned, Mazlan did not dispute the Prosecution’s version of events, and I was satisfied that each of the elements was made out. Mazlan had admitted that he knowingly collected heroin from Mani at Tuas Avenue 11. He clearly had physical custody of the drugs from the time that he collected the drugs from Mani to the time he delivered them to Kay Yong. He also delivered the drugs to Kay Yong, which came within the definition of trafficking in s 2 of the MDA. 101 Accordingly, I convicted Mazlan on the charge. The only issue was whether or not Mazlan was eligible to be sentenced under s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA, which affords the court the discretion to impose the sentence of life imprisonment and caning in lieu of the death penalty. 102 Both the requirements in s 33B(2)(a) and s 33B(2)(b) must be satisfied in order for an accused to be eligible to be sentenced under s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA (PP vChristeen d/o Jayamany and another[2015] SGHC 126 (“Christeen”) at [46]). 103 Under s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA, Mazlan would have to prove on a balance of probabilities that his involvement in the offence under s 5(1) of the MDA was restricted to transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug – in other words, that he was a mere courier. The factors relevant to the analysis of whether an accused is a mere courier were summarised by Tay Yong Kwang J inChristeenat [68]: (a) Whether the accused’s role is a common and ordinary incident of transporting, sending, or delivering a drug. (b) Whether such involvement is necessary to deliver the drugs, including (i) the degree of alteration to the drugs and (ii) the extent to which such involvement looks beyond his immediate recipient of the drugs. (c) The extent in scope and time of the functions which the offender performs. (d) The degree of executive decision-making powers which the accused has. (e) Whether the offender receives a distinct form of benefit for performing his extra functions. 104 Having regard to these factors, I was satisfied that Mazlan was a mere courier. Mazlan’s unchallenged evidence was that he did not even count the money he received from Kay Yong,145Foot Note 145×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 54 (line 25–26).and the Prosecution did not dispute the Defence’s position that Mazlan was intending to hand over the money he received from Kay Yong to Mani.146Foot Note 146×Second accused’s closing submissions, para 14.It was clear that Mazlan was notsellingthe drugs to Kay Yong. His role in the transaction between Mani (or Ah Boy) and Kay Yong was simply to deliver the drugs from Mani to Kay Yong. His involvement did not involve “any other type of activity associated with drug supply and distribution” (seeChristeenat [69]) apart from transporting the drugs from one party to another. It was undisputed that Mazlan also was not entrusted with any decision-making powers and was acting, at all times, under Mani’s instructions. Finally, Mazlan’s unchallenged evidence was that he had agreed to deliver the drugs for Mani “once and for all”.147Foot Note 147×Certified Transcript, 28 July 2017, p 40 (line 29).Thus his involvement was of a short duration, and was limited in time and scope (Christeenat [68(c)] and [71]). 105 The Prosecution had issued a Certificate of Substantive Assistance under s 33B(2)(b) of the MDA. As s 33B(2)(a) was also fulfilled, I imposed the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. As mentioned, Mazlan was more than 50 years old at the time of sentencing and could not be caned pursuant to s 325(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).
