        "Section 21 of the Legal Profession Act": "2        Section 21\n\nof the Act states as follows:\"(1)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act,\n\nthe court may, for the purposes of any one case where the court is satisfied that it is of\n\nsufficient difficulty and complexity and having regard to the circumstances of the case,\n\nadmit to practise as an advocate and solicitor any person who -(a)    holds Her Majesty’s Patent as\n\n  Queen’s Counsel(b)    does not ordinarily reside in\n\n  Singapore or Malaysia but who has come or intends to come to Singapore for the purpose of\n\n  appearing in the case; and(c)    has special qualification or\n\n  experience for the purpose of the case.\"3        Mr Sher\n\nobtained the degree of Bachelor of Commerce followed by an LL.B at the University of\n\nWitwaterstrand, Johannesburg in 1964. He was awarded the degree Cum Laude and was awarded\n\nthe Society of Advocates’ prize for the best law student over the three years of the\n\nLL.B course. He was called to the Bar in South Africa. He took the post-graduate Bachelor\n\nof Civil Law at Oxford University, New College, in 1967 and was called to the Bar of\n\nEngland and Wales in 1968 by the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple. He has practiced\n\nat the Bar of England and Wales since then. In 1981 he was appointed one of Her\n\nMajesty’s Counsel. He is a member of the Chancery Bar Association and the Commercial\n\nBar Association. In 1987 he was appointed a Recorder and a Deputy High Court Judge in the\n\nChancery Division in 1989 and more recently in the Queen’s Bench Division, Commercial\n\nCourt.4        Mr Sher has\n\nappeared as counsel in several cases in Singapore. At the time of his application he was\n\ninstructed in a very large scale litigation in the Cayman Islands and in Hong Kong and\n\nother jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom he has appeared regularly in the High Court,\n\nthe Court of Appeal, the Privy Council and the House of Lords, both as junior and in silk.\n\nHe appeared inWilliam Sindall plc v Cambridgeshire County Councilin the Court of\n\nAppeal [1994] 1 WLR 1016 which was a case involving mistake in the realm of contract and\n\nof relevance at the trial of the suit. He also appeared inSouth Tyneside Metropolitan\n\nBorough Council v Svenska International plc[1995] 1 All ER 545 which involved the law\n\nof contract and restitution and the defence of change of position, and which would also be\n\nrelevant to the issues in the suit.5        In the light\n\nof the very impressive credentials of Mr Sher, it was obvious that the requirements of\n\nspecial qualifications and experience under s 21(1) of the Act were not in issue before\n\nme.6        For more\n\nthan 10 years our courts have been dilating on s 21(1) of the Act. It was noted that the\n\nsection was aimed at specifying some guidelines in the ad hoc admission of Queen’s\n\nCounsel. The objective was to help develop a strong core of good advocates at the local\n\nBar, but it was also recognized that in the appropriate cases litigants would be allowed\n\nto avail themselves of the services of QCs. The guidelines were most usefully set out by\n\nYong Pung How CJ inRe Caplan Jonathan Michael QC(No 2)[1998] 1 SLR 440[para 11]:At the first stage, the applicant must demonstrate that\n\n  the case in which he seeks to appear contains issues of law and/or fact of sufficient\n\n  difficulty and complexity to require elucidation and/or argument by a Queen’s\n\n  Counsel. Such difficulty or complexity is not of itself a guarantee of admission, for the\n\n  decision to admit is still a matter of the court’s discretion. At the second stage,\n\n  therefore, the applicant must persuade the court that the circumstances of the particular\n\n  case warrant the court exercising its discretion in favour of his admission. Finally, he\n\n  has to satisfy the court of his suitability for admission.7In Re\n\nFlint Charles John Raffles QC[2001] 2 SLR 276I had occasion to consider the import\n\nof s21(1) of the Act. Mr Flint applied for ad hoc admission to appear for a Malaysian\n\ncompany to recover substantial damages of about US$75 million against each of the then 30\n\ndefendants for, inter alia, conspiracy to defraud, equitable compensation and/or damages\n\nfor breaches of contract of employment, fiduciary duties or inducement of breaches of\n\ncontract and for dishonest assistance or as recipients of trust moneys. Local counsel in\n\nthat case had played prominent roles in the pre-trial preparation of the case and had\n\nconvincingly demonstrated before me in many interlocutory matters that he would ably\n\nassist the plaintiffs and the court. Much of the crucial leg-work had been done and such\n\ntrial advocacy as would be required was well within the abilities of local counsel. I\n\nformed the view that the opportunity must be offered to the local Bar to take up the\n\nchallenge and appear at the trial and conduct it. The nurturing of the local Bar was\n\nendorsed by Yong Pung How CJ inRe Howe Russell Thomas QC[2001] 3 SLR 575para 7.\n\nYong CJ in that case stated clearly that that application \"did not pass the first\n\nstage of the test\" which he laid down inRe Caplan Michael QC.8        In the light\n\nof the pronouncements of our courts I went on to analyse the nature of the suit to\n\nconsider if it merited the ad hoc admission of a Queen’s Counsel.",
        "The Facts": "9        The\n\nplaintiff (\"IDA\") in the suit is a body corporate established pursuant to the\n\nInfo-Communications Development Authority of Singapore Act (Cap 137A). Its predecessor in\n\ntitle and power was the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore (\"TAS\"), which\n\nwas established under the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore Act (Cap 323)\n\n(\"the TAS Act\"), and which had made the payment in question. SingTel is a public\n\ncompany incorporated in Singapore and is engaged in, among other things, the business of\n\nproviding telecommunication services in Singapore.10        On 1 April\n\n1992 TAS granted SingTel a licence under the TAS Act to provide telecommunication services\n\nto Singapore until 2017 with monopoly rights for the provision of basis telecommunication\n\nservices until 2007. In October 1993 SingTel’s licence was amended to provide that\n\nTAS would have the right to licence additional operators to provide basic\n\ntelecommunication services from 1 April 2002 \"provided those services were ancillary\n\nand incidental to the principal services\" provided by those operators (\"the 1993\n\namendment\").11        By a letter\n\nto SingTel dated 11 May 1996, TAS gave notice pursuant to s 28 of the TAS Act of its\n\nintention to modify a condition of SingTel’s licence. TAS stated that the\n\ncompensation payable for any damage caused by this modification was assessed by TAS to be\n\n$1.5 billion and that SingTel was given 28 days from the date of service of that letter to\n\nmake representations to the proposed modification.12        SingTel\n\nreplied and stated that they confirmed their acceptance of the proposed modification\n\nreferred to in TAS’s letter and the compensation of $1.5 billion for the damage to\n\nSingTel, being SingTel’s \"loss of profits in each of the years from 2000 to\n\n2007, caused by the proposed modification.\" The quoted words reflected, evidently, a\n\ndesire to spread the losses over those years and reduced the quantum of income tax, if\n\nany.13        On receipt\n\nof the letter, TAS by its Director-General called SingTel’s officers and said that\n\nTAS was not agreeable to the form in which the letter was couched and requested that the\n\nwords \"in each of the years from 2000 to 2007\" be deleted. SingTel agreed to the\n\ndeletion. On the same day, TAS wrote to SingTel as follows:\" We refer to the letter …dated 30 May 1996\n\n    and Singapore Telecom’s decision to delete the words‘in each of the years\n\n    from 2000 to 2007,’ from paragraph 2 thereof.2     We note Singapore Telecom’s acceptance\n\n    of  the proposed modification in our letter of 11 May 1996 and acceptance of the\n\n    compensation amount of $1.5 billion for damage caused by the modification.3     This amount will be full and final\n\n    payment.\"14        On or about\n\n31 March 1997 TAS paid the compensation sum of $1.5 billion to SingTel.15        On 4\n\nOctober 2000, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore informed IDA and SingTel that no\n\ntax would be payable on the compensation amount received by SingTel.16        By a letter\n\ndated 14 March 2001 IDA as the successor in title requested SingTel to repay the amount\n\nallegedly overpaid by TAS of $388 million. SingTel rejected the claim and refused to pay\n\nthe same. IDA commenced the suit in July 2001. The pleadings were exhibited in the\n\nproceedings before me. The following issues arose from the pleadings and they were\n\nsummarised as follows:\"a.    Did TAS make a mistake of\n\n    including in the compensation sum of S$1,500,000,000.00 a tax provision of S$388,000,000\n\n    or did TAS assume the risk that tax may not be payable.b.    Did the Defendants\n\n    likewise make the same mistake or did they assume the risk that tax would be payable and\n\n    if so at what rate and in over what timescale.c.    What was the state of the law as at\n\n    the time the compensation sum was proposed with regards to the taxability of the\n\n    compensation sum.d.    If TAS did make a mistake, was it a\n\n    mistake of fact or law, or mixed fact and law.e.    If it was a mistake of law (whether\n\n    wholly or in part), does that entitle the Plaintiffs to seek restitution of the\n\n    S$388,000,000, i.e. is restitution for mistake of law a valid cause of action in\n\n    Singapore. TAS followed the statutory procedure laid down in section 28 of the TAS Act in\n\n    sending its letter of 11 May 1996 which embodied the statutory notice referred to in\n\n    sub-section (2) of that section. That notice stated the proposed modifications to the\n\n    Defendants’ licence and that the compensation payable would be S$1,500,000,000.00 to\n\n    be paid on 31 March 1997. The Defendants had 28 days to object. Had they objected and had\n\n    TAS either not changed its mind or amended the proposed modifications\n\n    or compensation, the Defendants would have had 14 days to appeal to the Minister. As\n\n    the Defendants did not object, TAS became statutorily obliged to carry out the\n\n    modifications and statutorily obliged on 31 March 1997 to pay the Defendants the sum of\n\n    S$1,500,000,000.00 being the sum specified in the statutory notice emobided in the letter\n\n    of 11 May 1996. In the circumstances, even assuming there was a mistake in the original\n\n    calculation of the S$1,500,000,000.00 inserted in the letter of 11 May 1996, the issue is\n\n    whether TAS were statutorily obliged to pay that sum on the 31stMarch 1997.f.     In the events that happened,\n\n    as pleaded by the Defendants, was TAS contractually obliged to pay the Defendants\n\n    S$1,500,000,000.00 on 31 March 1997, on the basis that that sum would be a full and final\n\n    settlement of the claim for compensation so that neither the Defendants nor TAS would be\n\n    able to reopen the sum whether or not any one or more of the many assumptions of present\n\n    and future fact and law that lay behind the determination of the compensation turned out\n\n    to be erroneous.g.    If so, is a valid compromise a\n\n    defence to a claim for restitution for mistake of law, such that the\n\n    Plaintiffs cannot claim repayment of the compensation or any part thereof without\n\n    obtaining from the Court rescission of the contract embodying the compromise. If so, can\n\n    the contract in pursuance of which compensation was paid, be rescinded by the court.h.    On the basis of the facts as\n\n    pleaded by the Defendants, in particular, that the Defendants reasonably proceeded on the\n\n    basis that the offer of S$1,500,000,000.00 by TAS would on acceptance result in a full and\n\n    final settlement of the Defendants’ entitlement to compensation arising from the\n\n    modification of their licence, and accordingly refrained from making representations with\n\n    regard to TAS’s letter of 11 May 1996 within the statutory 28 day period, are the\n\n    Plaintiffs estopped from claiming restitution of the S$388,000,000.00.i.    On the basis of the facts as\n\n    pleaded by the Defendants, in particular, that following payment of the compensation on 31\n\n    March 1997, the Defendants declared on 9 July 1999 a special interim dividend of 12 cents\n\n    per share for the financial year 1999/2000 (the nett dividend payout of which was in the\n\n    sum of  S$1,374,040,751.02) is the defence of change of position available to the\n\n    Defendants.\"17        These\n\nissues would span the law of restitution and contract and they raised important, difficult\n\nand complex questions, amongst others, as to what would be the operative mistakes of law\n\nwhich would kick in the restitutionary reliefs and the defences available in the light of\n\nthis newly recognized cause of action in the laws of Singapore. Several questions would\n\narise for the first time, which would require treatment by our courts.18        Counsel for\n\nthe Law Society of Singapore submitted that the High Court had recently ruled that unjust\n\nenrichment under a payment made under a mistake of law was reversible: seeManagement\n\nCorporation Strata Title No 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd[2001] 4 SLR 90. He\n\nexpressed the view that Mr Shanmugam SC could with equal facility appear for SingTel and\n\nwould appear on its behalf and pursue with equal vigour the rights of SingTel as any QC\n\nwould.19        In\n\nresponse, Mr Shanmugam SC observed that the law bearing on a restitutionary claim based on\n\nmistake of law and the defences was obviously evolving. Many of the issues on what would\n\namount to an operative mistake of law and the defences would be new and had not been dealt\n\nwith in any jurisdiction in the world. The new cause of action would require delineation\n\nand further amplification. Equally, the defences available to meet this restitutionary\n\nclaim, as foreshadowed by the issues outlined, would require careful consideration and\n\nexposition. Elucidation and arguments by a Queen’s Counsel well versed in this new\n\nbranch of the law would be most desirable. That would be of great assistance to our\n\ncourts. Secondly, he pointed out that the Government of Singapore was a substantial\n\nshareholder of SingTel. SingTel was concerned to ensure that the international investing\n\ncommunity, its shareholders, amongst whom were fund-managers, must be demonstrably\n\nsatisfied that the prosecution of its defence was being pursued with vigour and\n\ndetermination.20        Having\n\nconsidered the matter carefully, I formed the view that SingTel’s concern was\n\nunderstandable. Like it or not, we had to address the perceptions (whether well-founded or\n\nnot) of the international and local market place. Whilst it was true that local counsel\n\ncould appear for SingTel adequately, that was one relevant factor to be considered in the\n\nentire balancing exercise. I was also very mindful of the seminal issues which would\n\nprobably arise in this relatively new and evolving areas of the law of restitution which I\n\nhad personally followed with great interest over the last decade generally and\n\nparticularly since the decision handed down by the House of Lords inKleinwort Benson v\n\nLincoln City Council[1998] 4 All ER 513, [1999] 2 AC 349. In my view, the three-fold\n\ntest referred to earlier was fulfilled and in the exercise of my discretion I allowed the\n\napplication.Sgd:Lai Kew ChaiJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
