        "Held": ":A solicitor is entitled to caution his counterpart when he believes\n\nthat a conflict of interest situation looms in the distance. Whether or not the solicitor\n\nconcerned agrees with that perception, he must decide whether he is comfortable in\n\ncontinuing so to act. If he decides to continue acting for the client he must be prepared\n\nto justify his conduct if necessary. The question as to whether he is right or not may\n\nonly be determined after a full inquiry; but this court, at this juncture, is not the\n\nproper forum to conduct such an inquiry. Following the applicant firm’s statement\n\nthat the firm could not continue to act without a resolution of the allegations, the\n\napplication was allowed.Judgment(Application for Discharge)GROUNDS OF DECISION1. This was an application by Tan Kok Quan Partnership as solicitors\n\nfor the first defendant (Lim Lie Hoa) for an order declaring that Tan Kok Quan Partnership\n\nhas ceased acting for the first defendant, and for the provision of costs although the\n\nprayer ought more accurately be for leave to be discharged as solicitors for the first\n\ndefendant. The application was taken out on 8 April 2002. From the outset, it was a most\n\npeculiar application, but I shall have to set out the background leading to the\n\napplication for a better understanding as to why that is so. The plaintiff is\n\nunrepresented in these, as well as the previous proceedings. The second defendant is now\n\nrepresented by Mr. Arul Chandran while the new parties, the third and fourth defendants\n\nare represented by Mr. Devinder Rai.2. In 1991 the plaintiff (Jane Rebecca Ong) sued Lim Lie Hoa and the\n\nsecond defendant (Ong Siauw Tjoan) in this action, that is, Originating Summons 939 of\n\n1991. Ong Siau Tjoan was her estranged husband, and Lim Lie Hoa her mother-in-law (Ong\n\nSiau Tjoan's mother). The assets (generally believed to be substantial - declared at one\n\npoint to be $5,117,269 - by the parties concerned) of Lim Lie Hoa's deceased husband (Ong\n\nSeng King) lie at the heart of the dispute because Jane Rebecca Ong claimed that her\n\nrights to matrimonial assets included her husband's share in his father's estate. At all\n\nmaterial times, Lim Lie Hoa and Ong Siauw Tjoan were the administrators of the said\n\nestate. Matters proved far more complicated than it appeared. The first defendant was\n\nclearly and, it seems, intractably antagonistic towards the plaintiff and all that she\n\nproposed or said. Wavering between his wife and mother, the second defendant agreed to,\n\nand did, execute a deed of assignment of half his share of his father's estate to the\n\nplaintiff. However, he subsequently executed a deed of release in favour of the estate. In\n\nthe deed of release he accepted that he had already taken and enjoyed what was, as he\n\ndescribed in a letter he wrote, his \"fair share\" of the assets of the estate.3. This Originating Summons was taken out by the plaintiff for a court\n\ndeclaration that the deed of release was void and unenforceable, and for an order for an\n\ninquiry into the estate of Ong Seng King so as to determine its true assets. At the end of\n\nthe trial in 1996, Justice Chao Hick Tin granted the plaintiffs the orders sought.\n\nConsequently, the parties began to set in motion the steps necessary for the inquiry into\n\nthe assets of the estate and the plaintiff's share of it. The inquiry proper has not\n\ncommenced but the parties have been busy with various ancillary proceedings such as the\n\njoinder of the third and fourth defendants as parties, naming the first defendant as a\n\nthird party, applications for interim payments, mareva injunctions, and now, this\n\napplication for an order that the solicitors for the first defendant to cease acting for\n\nher.4. The grounds of the application are set out in the affidavit of Choo\n\nChen Chen, a solicitor of Tan Kok Quan Partnership. The affidavit drew reference to a\n\nletter of 4 April 2002 by C Arul & Partners the current solicitors for the second\n\ndefendant addressed to the first defendant's solicitors. The letter reminded the firm that\n\nTan Kok Quan SC, who is the principal partner in Tan Kok Quan Partnership, was a partner\n\nin the firm of Lee & Lee which acted for the estate of Ong Seng King. Consequently,\n\nthe writer of this letter takes the view that Tan Kok Quan Partnership cannot now act for\n\nthe first defendant in the current proceedings against the second defendant because the\n\nlatter was a co-administrator of Ong Seng King's estate since that will require the firm\n\nto act against one of its former clients, and be thus in breach of r 29 of the Legal\n\nProfession (Professional Conduct) Rules (the Rules). Secondly, as the assets of the estate\n\nare being questioned, Tan Kok Quan SC may have to give evidence himself, and on that\n\naccount, he will be in breach of r 31 of the Rules. Tan Kok Quan Partnership then wrote to\n\nthe first defendant by telefax dated 5 April stating that in view of the second\n\ndefendant's objections it would be prudent for the firm to cease acting for her. The first\n\ndefendant sent a curt reply stating: \"I do not wish to discharge M/s Tan Kok Quan\n\nPartnership.\"5. Mr. Ramesh, from Tan Kok Quan Partnership, making the application on\n\nbehalf of his firm expressed the opinion of his firm that they do not think that there is\n\nany merit in Arul Chandran's assertions of conflict of interests. He initially took the\n\nview that the firm was \"neutral\" on the question posed in this application as to\n\nwhether or not they should continue to act for the first defendant and decided to leave it\n\nto the court to make whatever order it deems fit. He added that the first defendant does\n\nnot wish to discharge them. He then asked for the matter to be stood down so that the\n\nfirst defendant could appear in person or engage an independent solicitor to advise her on\n\nthis matter of discharging her present solicitors. Before adjourning I indicated to\n\ncounsel that in such circumstances the applicant (the solicitors) cannot take a neutral\n\nposition. When the hearing resumed on 19 April Mr. Ramesh retracted from his neutral\n\nposition and submitted that although he disputes the allegations of conflict of interests,\n\nhis firm cannot, in the meantime, continue to act without a resolution of the allegations.\n\nIn the circumstances, I granted an order in terms of their application and the proceedings\n\nwere explained to the first defendant who asked for, and was given, one month to engage\n\nanother firm of solicitors to take over her case. I now give my reasons.6. I am mindful of the history of the personal relationship of the\n\nparties in this action is steeped in acrimony and shall hope to be alert against any\n\ncreeping shadow of mischief from the parties. There are already several pending\n\napplications that seems to me to be steps in the wrong direction. Some of them may be\n\nnecessary, but they must be dealt with swiftly by all concerned because everyone must\n\nfocus on proceeding as expeditiously as possible to get the inquiry underway. One of the\n\nabovementioned applications is this application by Tan Kok Quan Partnership to be\n\ndischarged as solicitors for the first defendant. The application was precipitated by the\n\nletter from Arul Chandran that I had referred to above. A solicitor is entitled to caution\n\nhis counterpart when he believes that a conflict of interest situation looms in the\n\ndistance, if it was not already upon the other. The solicitor concerned may or may not\n\nagree with that perception. But he must decide whether he is comfortable in continuing so\n\nto act. If he decides to continue acting for the client he must be prepared to justify his\n\nconduct if necessary. The question as to whether he is right or not may only be determined\n\nafter a full inquiry; but this court, at this juncture, is not the proper forum to conduct\n\nsuch an inquiry. The judge in any proceedings before him, sits as an adjudicator, not as\n\nan advisor. That is why I indicated to Mr. Ramesh that he cannot take a neutral position\n\nin the circumstances. He must decide whether he can continue to act for the first\n\ndefendant. If he believes so he ought to withdraw his firm's application. If he does not\n\nfeel that he or his firm can continue under the circumstances, it will only be fair to\n\nallow the application, and not compel him or his firm to carry on under the threat of\n\ndisciplinary or other proceedings against them. But the court cannot make that election on\n\nthe firm's behalf. Neither can it declare the propriety or otherwise of the firm should\n\nthey decide to carry on because a declaration of this nature can only be made, as I have\n\nsaid, after a full inquiry into a specific complaint. It is not the function of this court\n\nto usurp the role an inquiry or disciplinary committee who would ordinarily be the\n\nappropriate body to determine questions of the kind that have arisen here.7. In view of Mr. Ramesh’s statement that his firm cannot continue\n\nto act in the face of the assertions being made against them, I granted Tan Kok Quan\n\nPartnership the discharge prayed for.Sgd:Choo Han TeckJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
