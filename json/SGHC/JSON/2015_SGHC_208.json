        "Introduction": "1       This is a dispute between sisters. The first plaintiff, Lim Giok Boon (“Una”), is the older sister of the defendant, Lim Geok Cheng (“Lena”). Una’s husband, Hiew Yee Choong (“Ah Choong”), is the second plaintiff. The facts relevant to the dispute between the sisters go back almost 15 years and cut across various aspects of the parties’ lives. 2       The plaintiffs’ claim rests on certain factual premises that were directly undermined by Lena’s defence and by her counterclaim. In the end, while I have accepted Lena’s version of events over that of the plaintiffs, I have nevertheless allowed part of the plaintiffs’ claim and have dismissed Lena’s counterclaim. 3       Lena has appealed against my decision. I now set out my grounds.",
        "Overview of the case": "",
        "The parties": "4       I begin by setting out the brief background of the parties to the suit. Una, Lena and Ah Choong are all now Singapore citizens who came here from Malaysia to find work. Una and Lena come from a large family which still has its roots in Muar in Malaysia.[note: 1] 5       Ah Choong first came to Singapore in or around 1975. He found work as a tailor.[note: 2]Una came to Singapore in 1986. She found work in a factory. Ah Choong and Una met that same year. By that time, Ah Choong was working as a renovation contractor. Una and Ah Choong registered their marriage in 1989. They also successfully applied for a HDB flat in the same year.[note: 3] 6       Lena’s work history was a matter of some contention. Specifically, there was a dispute, which I analyse and resolve below, about where she lived and worked from 1991 to 1994. It was undisputed, however, that from the end of 1994 onwards, Lena lived and worked in Singapore.[note: 4]In fact, she lived with the plaintiffs, even as they moved homes, and continued to do so up to about 2006.[note: 5]In 2007, she moved into a flat in a development known as Edelweiss Park (“the Edelweiss Property”).[note: 6] 7       Another prominent figure that features in many of the issues before the court is Lena’s boyfriend, Chew Chong Khay (“Frank”). Frank and Lena’s relationship began some time in 2005.[note: 7]It is noteworthy that Lena did not call Frank as a witness.",
        "Candace, Canary and C&C": "8       A threshold issue which cuts across all the plaintiffs’ claims and the Lena’s counterclaim relates to the beneficial ownership of certain businesses in which both Lena and Una were involved. The plaintiffs’ position is that they are the sole owners of these businesses. Lena’s case is that she and her step-sister, Ng Siew Lian (“NSL”), are part-owners of these businesses. 9       The first of these businesses is Candace Unisex Beauty & Hair Salon (“Candace”). Candace was set up in September 1994[note: 8]at Bedok North.[note: 9]As its name suggest, it is a hair salon. In December 1995, Candace opened a second salon at Loyang Point.[note: 10]In June 1997, Candace’s salon at Bedok North closed, leaving only the salon at Loyang Point in operation.[note: 11] 10     Although the ownership of Candace is a matter of contention, it is a matter of record that Candace was initially registered on 27 September 1994 in Una’s name. On 5 September 1995, Ah Choong became the second registered owner of Candace. Two weeks later, Una withdrew, leaving Ah Choong as the sole registered owner.[note: 12] 11     The second of these businesses is Canary Beauty Centre (“Canary”). Canary was set up in 12 September 1998. As its name suggests, Canary was a beauty salon. Its place of business is at Loyang Point, on the same floor as Candace.[note: 13]It was registered in Una’s name.[note: 14] 12     In 2007, a company, Candace and Canary Beauty Pte Ltd (“C&C”), was incorporated to take over the businesses of Candace and of Canary. Una, Ah Choong and Lena were the directors of C&C. Una held 50% of C&C while Lena held 47.5% and Ah Choong held 2.5%.[note: 15] 13     Towards the end of 2007, the parties’ shareholding in C&C changed. Sometime between late November 2007 and early December 2007, Lena agreed to sell her shareholding in C&C to the plaintiffs and to step down as a director of C&C.[note: 16]It is also undisputed that the plaintiffs paid Lena four different sums around that time. These four sums were:[note: 17] (a)     $133,000 for the transfer of Lena’s 47.5% shareholding in C&C to the plaintiffs; (b)     $32,084.32 for Lena’s share of C&C’s profits for the period of time that she was a director and shareholder; (c)     $1,990.70 for share investments that Lena had made with the plaintiffs; and (d)     $8,420.90 for share investments that Lena had made in Ah Choong’s account. 14     In 2008, Lena opened her own hair salon, called Lena L Aoyama Tokyo, at Loyang Point. Her salon operated from premises next to Candace’s premises.[note: 18]",
        "The plaintiffs’ claims": "15     The plaintiffs commenced this action against Lena on 7 May 2012. In it, they allege that they advanced money over the years to Lena which she is obliged to repay them or to account to them for in some other way. Lena’s defence, broadly speaking, is that most of the sums which she received from the plaintiffs were either salary due to her as an employee of the businesses or a share of the profits due to her as a part-owner of the businesses. The plaintiffs’ position is that they own the entirety of the businesses, to the exclusion of any claim by Lena to be part-owner. I now summarise the respective heads of the plaintiffs’ claim. 16     The first head of the plaintiffs’ claim relates to a joint account (“the Joint Account”) held by Una and Lena with United Overseas Bank (“UOB”).[note: 19]In March 2006, Lena withdrew $203,040.46 (“the UOB Money”) from the Joint Account. Una claims that the money in the Joint Account came entirely from her and did not belong to Lena. She seeks a declaration that Lena held the UOB Money, upon withdrawing it, on trust for her. Lena’s defence to this head of the plaintiffs’ claim is simply that the UOB Money was hers. 17     The second head of the plaintiffs’ claim is that they have a beneficial interest in the Edelweiss Property, even though it is registered in Lena’s sole name. It is the plaintiffs’ case that between 2003 and 2007, they contributed at least $502,172.42 (“the Edelweiss Money”) to help Lena pay for the Edelweiss Property. In response, Lena contends that the money given to her by the plaintiffs and applied towards the Edelweiss Property was her salary and share of profits from the businesses. 18     The third head of the plaintiffs’ claim is for repayment of certain loans extended to Lena for her to invest in shares (“Share Acquisition Loans”). They claim to have lent Lena various sums of money from 1998 to 2007. Their case is that $258,000 of that money now remains outstanding. Again, Lena denies that she has any obligation to repay this money because these advances were not in fact loans but were instead her salary and share of the profits from the businesses. 19     Finally, Ah Choong seeks to recover $150,000 from Lena. His case is that he lent her the sum over time for her to gamble with on board cruise ships (“the Gambling Loans”) and she has yet to repay it. He advanced these sums to her either by cheque or in cash. Lena’s defence to this claim is that the cheques she received from Ah Choong were Ah Choong’s repayments either to Frank or to her for credit which they had extended to the plaintiffs on those same gambling cruises. As for the loans which the plaintiffs allege to have advanced to her in cash, Lena points out that the plaintiffs have no documentary evidence to prove that any such loans were ever made. 20     Lena’s counterclaim against Una is founded on breach of fiduciary duty. Her case is that Una held 85% of all the profits received from the businesses on trust for her. She therefore seeks an account of profits from Una, and from Una alone.[note: 20] 21     From the summary of the claims and counterclaims provided above, the broad issues which fall for determination are: (a)     Whether Lena was a part-owner of the businesses. (b)     Whether Lena held any part of the UOB Money on constructive trust for Una and, if so, whether they have to be repaid. (c)     Whether Lena is liable to repay the Share Acquisition Loans. (d)     Whether the plaintiffs have a beneficial interest in the Edelweiss Property. (e)     Whether Lena is liable to repay the Gambling Loans. 22     Lena’s assertion that she was a part-owner of the businesses is critical to her defence on each of these claims. A finding that Lena was indeed a part-owner of the businesses will bolster her defence because it explains how Lena had access to the substantial sums necessary for her defence to be accepted. If, on the other hand, Lena was not a part-owner of the businesses, she would have earned a salary as an employee but would have had no right to a share of the businesses’ profits. This would reduce substantially the amount of money she would have been entitled to receive from the businesses and to claim as her own. This, in turn, would undermine significantly the credibility of her defence. 23     Before analysing each of the plaintiff’s five heads of claim, therefore, I begin by considering Lena’s claim to be a part-owner of the businesses. That considers assessing, first, Lena’s explanation of how she earned the capital which she invested in the business to be a part-owner of it.",
        "Lena’s claim to be a part-owner of the businesses": "",
        "Lena’s case": "140    Lena’s case is that Una and Ah Choong forced her to accompany them on the gambling cruises. It was on one of these cruises that Lena met Frank in 2005. Between 2006 and 2007, Una, Ah Choong, Lena and Frank regularly patronised overnight gambling cruises.[note: 118] 141    The plaintiffs and Frank had a practice whereby Frank would extend credit to the plaintiffs for gambling on board these cruises. Pursuant to this practice, Frank lent Una money on a few occasions, when Una ran out of money to gamble with while at sea. Frank had credit on these cruises and would simply extend this credit to Una.[note: 119]The cheques which the plaintiffs claim are Gambling Loans and which were cashed by a Junket Operator (Heng Heng Pte Ltd) and by one Lim Hock Hoe, were actually the plaintiffs’ repayment of loans extended to them by Frank.[note: 120] 142    In respect of the cash amounts advanced, Lena argues the plaintiffs have failed to discharge their burden of proof because there is no documentary evidence to show that these sums were ever advanced. In particular, the defendant singled out for attention the two alleged loans of $30,000 in cash: (i) the payment to the casino junket operator at the IMM Building; and (ii) the payment in February 2007 given partly in cash ($3,000) and partly by way of cheque ($27,000) to strangers in a car at the Mobil petrol station. 143    Further, the $30,000 in cash which Jenny gave Lena at the Changi Ferry terminal was taken from Lena’s own safe and not from that of the plaintiffs.[note: 121]That occurred on an occasion where she and Frank decided to stay an additional night on the cruise. Lena, however, did not have any more money on her. While the ship was on its way to the jetty, Lena called Jenny to give her the password to Lena’s safe at home so that Jenny could retrieve $30,000 and bring it to the ferry terminal for Lena. 144    Finally, Lena also claims that the money she received from the plaintiffs may have been due to her, either because they represented her salary, her share of profits from the businesses or both.",
        "Plaintiffs’ case": "122    The plaintiffs’ case is that they began investing in shares in 1998. Lena noticed the plaintiffs making profits and expressed a desire to invest in shares as well. Lena started borrowing money from the plaintiffs in order to invest in shares. These were interest-free loans with no fixed repayment date.[note: 100] 123    From 1998 to 2007, the plaintiffs lent Lena various sums of money in order for her to invest in shares. Between 1998 and 2000, Lena repaid all the sums which she borrowed from the plaintiffs in these years.[note: 101]In 2002, Lena wanted to borrow $10,000 a month from the plaintiffs to invest in shares. The plaintiffs agreed to lend her only $6,000 a month. In 2002, the plaintiffs lent Lena $66,000 through 11 payments of $6,000 each. Lena returned a sum of $60,000 in cash that same year.[note: 102]Again over the course of 2003, the plaintiffs lent a total of $80,000 to Lena, mostly through monthly payments of $6,000 each. In that same year, Lena returned $18,000 in cash.[note: 103] 124    From 2004 to May 2007, the plaintiffs lent a substantial sum of money to Lena, again mostly in payments of $6,000 each time.[note: 104]Lena did repay a certain amount of the money. However, the plaintiffs claim that a sum of $258,000 remains outstanding even after taking into account the sums that Lena has repaid over the years.[note: 105]The plaintiffs therefore seek to recover this sum of $258,000 from Lena. 125    At trial, the plaintiffs did, however, recognise that a substantial portion of the sum claimed is time-barred.[note: 106]The writ of summons was issued in May 2012. The plaintiffs have therefore abandoned their claim for repayment of money lent to Lena before May 2006. They seek repayment only of $78,000, which is the amount said to have been advanced after May 2006.[note: 107] 126    I set out the breakdown of these amounts and the relevant details pertaining to each sum lent to Lena[note: 108]: AmountDateSource$6,0008 May 2006Candace$6,0008 May 2006Candace$6,0008 May 2006Candace$6,0008 June 2006Candace$6,00024 July 2006Canary$6,00013 September 2006Canary$6,00013 September 2006Plaintiffs’ Joint Account$6,00020 November 2006Plaintiffs’ Joint Account$6,0004 January 2007Candace$6,00015 February 2007Candace$6,00015 March 2007Canary$6,00010 April 2007Canary$6,0008 May 2007Canary",
        "My decision": "145    I do not accept that the advances which the plaintiffs characterise as Gambling Loans could have been part of Lena’s salary or her share of profits from the businesses. As I have noted, it is not likely that any distributions of her share of profits would be in round numbers. Furthermore, I doubt that Lena’s salary from the businesses would be paid in lump sums in the manner the Gambling Loans were advanced. 146    All in all, I prefer the plaintiffs’ account of the events surrounding the Gambling Loans. First, the plaintiffs’ statement of claim particularises each Gambling Loan. In response, Lena’s defence merely asserts baldly that these sums were her share of profits and her salary from the businesses. It is only in Lena’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief that she alleges for the first time that: (i) the money which Jenny brought to the Changi Ferry terminal was from Lena’s own safe; and (ii) that Frank extended credit to the plaintiffs on the gambling cruises. She does not make either assertion in her pleadings. This, when juxtaposed against the fact that the plaintiffs’ statement of claim is particularised, leads to me infer that Lena’s account of events is an afterthought and to prefer the plaintiffs’ account over Lena’s. 147    Second, I draw an adverse inference against Lena for failing to call Frank as a witness at trial. Illustration (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) gives the court the discretion to presume “that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it”. InCheong Ghim Fah and another v Murugian s/o Rangasamy[2004] 1 SLR(R) 628 (“Cheong Ghim Fah”), V K Rajah JC (as he then was) agreed with the principles distilled inWisniewski v Central Manchester Health Authority[1998] 5 PIQR P324(“Winiewski”). The relevant principles as set out inCheong Ghim Fahare (at [42], citingWiniewskiat P340): (1)    In certain circumstances a court may be entitled to draw adverse inferences from the absence or silence of a witness who might be expected to have material evidence to give on an issue in an action. (2)    If a court is willing to draw such inferences, they may go to strengthen the evidence adduced on that issue by the other party or to weaken the evidence, if any, adduced by the party who might reasonably have been expected to call the witness. (3)    There must, however, have been some evidence, however weak, adduced by the former on the matter in question before the court is entitled to draw the desired inference: in other words, there must be a case to answer on that issue. (4)    If the reason for the witness’s absence or silence satisfies the court, then no such adverse inference may be drawn. If, on the other hand, there is some credible explanation given, even if it not wholly satisfactory, the potentially detrimental effect of his/her absence or silence may be reduced or nullified. 148    Lena could have called Frank to give evidence of his practice of extending credit to the plaintiffs and to deny that the cash amounts given on two occasions at the IMM Building were for him. His evidence would have been directly relevant to Lena’s defence for at least four of the five sums claimed as Gambling Loans. Yet, Lena chose not to call Frank. Her sole reason for not doing so was that it would be unfair to him and she wanted to protect his feelings. I do not think this is a good reason in the circumstances of the case. I thus draw an adverse inference against Lena. I infer that she did not call Frank because his evidence would be unfavourable to her and show that the amounts given by the plaintiffs’ were in fact loans to Lena. 149    Having accepted the plaintiffs’ version of events I find that Lena has to repay $150,000 to the plaintiffs since they were indeed loans extended to her.",
        "The Joint Account": "",
        "Una’s case": "77     On 8 July 2003, Una opened the Joint Account with an initial deposit of $202,000.[note: 71]The money in the Joint Account could be withdrawn by either Una or Lena alone. 78     Una’s position was that the money in the account came entirely from her. There was an understanding between Lena and Una that Lena could not use the money in the account as she wished.[note: 72]Una always intended that the money in the Joint Account would remain her own.[note: 73] 79     Una withdrew $101,738 from the Joint Account on 10 November 2004.[note: 74]About half a year later, on 6 July 2005, Una deposited a sum of $100,000 into the Joint Account.[note: 75] 80     Lena withdrew the UOB Money from the Joint Account in March 2006. After the withdrawal, she closed the Joint Account. Una came to know all of this only much later, when Lena told Una in 2007, after the Chinese New Year holidays. Lena also said that she needed the money but would return it.[note: 76]Una was surprised and angry because she never intended for Lena to withdraw money from the Joint Account. 81     Lena has never repaid this money. Una thus claims that Lena holds the UOB Money on trust for her and is liable to account for it.",
        "The Edelweiss Property": "",
        "The Share Acquisition Loans": "",
        "The Gambling Loans": "",
        "Ah Choong’s case": "133    The plaintiffs seek to recover a total of $150,000 which they lent over a period of time to Lena for gambling on board cruise ships (“the Gambling Loans”). These Gambling Loans were interest-free loans with no specific repayment date. 134    In June 2006, when the plaintiffs, Lena and Frank were on a gambling cruise, Lena asked the plaintiffs if she could borrow money. Lena knew that the plaintiffs kept cash at home. Lena made a phone call to Jenny Loo (“Jenny”) who was at home. Jenny is Una’s and Lena’s niece. Una told Jenny to open the safe in the plaintiffs’ room and take out 30 $1,000 notes from an envelope inside. Lena arranged for a taxi to pick Jenny up and to take her to Changi Ferry Terminal where Lena collected the $30,000.[note: 113] 135    In October 2006, Lena called Ah Choong to ask if he had $30,000 to lend her. Lena told Ah Choong that Frank wanted to borrow the money from her and that he would pay off all the loans. Ah Choong agreed. Lena told Ah Choong to take the money to a unit in the IMM Building and to give it to a casino junket operator. Ah Choong gave $30,000 in cash to the casino junket operator.[note: 114] 136    In November 2006, Ah Choong again gave $30,000 to a casino junket operator at the IMM Building at Lena’s request.[note: 115] 137    In February 2007, Lena persuaded Ah Choong to lend her another $30,000. Ah Choong informed her that he only had $3,000 cash on hand and would write a cheque for $27,000. On Lena’s instructions, Ah Choong went to the Mobil petrol station near the plaintiffs’ home and handed the cheque and $3,000 cash to unknown men in a car. Lena had given him the license plate number of the car he should look out for.[note: 116] 138    On 27 June 2007, Lena called Ah Choong again asking if she could borrow $30,000. Ah Choong reluctantly agreed and issued a cheque for $30,000. Lena told him that someone would come in a taxi to pick up the cheque. She gave Ah Choong the taxi’s license plate number and told him to pass the cheque to the passenger of the taxi. He did so.[note: 117] 139    All in all, Ah Choong claimed $150,000 from Lena.",
        "Lena’s counterclaim for breach of fiduciary duty": "150    Lena’s counterclaim is simply that Una has repudiated the settlement agreement reached in Muar during the bidding exercise. That entitles Lena to claim all of the money which Una owes her.[note: 122]In addition, because Una failed to put in the capital of $53,100, as promised when Candace was first set up (see [28] above), Lena’s claims that the plaintiffs hold 85% of all profits received from the businesses and from C&C on constructive trust for her and are liable to account to her for those profits.[note: 123] 151    I reject Lena’s counterclaim. There is absolutely no evidence to support the claim that Una repudiated the agreement reached in Muar. It seems patent to me that the parties intended the settlement agreement in Muar and the four cheques transferred pursuant to that agreement to be full settlement of all possible claims relating to their ownership and share of profits in businesses of Candace and Canary and of C&C. Una is therefore bound by this settlement. 152    I therefore dismiss the counterclaim.",
        "Conclusion": "153    Given all my findings, I have entered judgment on the claim and counterclaim as follows: (a)     I have declared that Lena is a constructive trustee for Una in respect of $100,000 out of the UOB Money. She is liable to account to Una for that sum by paying it to her together with interest for the period from 6 July 2005 to 23 March 2006. (b)     I have dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim that they have a beneficial interest in the Edelweiss Property. (c)     I have dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim to recover the Share Acquisition Loans. (d)     I have allowed the plaintiffs’ claim to recover $150,000 in respect of the Gambling Loans extended. (e)     I have dismissed Lena’s counterclaim. 154    I have also ordered that Lena pay to the plaintiffs 50% of the combined costs of and incidental to both the claim and the counterclaim in these proceedings. Those costs shall be taxed if not agreed.  [note: 1]Una’s AEIC 23/12/2013 at paras 4–7 and Lena’s AEIC 23/12/2013 at para 5.
