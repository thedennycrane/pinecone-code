        "The applications": "2 Summons No 2929 of 2017 (“SUM 2929”) is the Plaintiff’s application for further and better particulars of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 3) (“the Defence and Counterclaim”) and the Particulars of Objection (Amendment No 3) (“the Particulars of Objection”). SUM 2929 is made pursuant to O 18 r 12 and O 87A r 3 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”), and consists of 165 sets of requests (each with numerous sub-requests). 3 Summons No 2935 of 2017 (“SUM 2935”) is the Defendant’s application for further and better particulars of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) (“the Statement of Claim”), the Particulars of Infringement (Amendment No 1) (“the Particulars of Infringement”) and the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) (“Reply and Defence to Counterclaim”). SUM 2935 is made pursuant to O 18 r 12 and O 87A r 2 of the Rules of Court, and consists of 15 sets of requests (each with numerous sub-requests). 4 I heard the SUM 2929 and SUM 2935 together on 4 August 2017 and 21 September 2017. Further submissions were tendered to court on 5 October 2017. On 19 October 2017, I rendered oral judgment for both applications, and supplemented the oral judgment with this written judgment in relation to three specific groups of requests. The three groups of requests are: (a) the Plaintiff’s requests, in SUM 2929, for the Defendant to provide particulars of the combinations of prior art and/or user (collectively referred to as “prior art”) relied on to invalidate the patents in question (“the Combination Requests”); (b) the Plaintiff’s requests, in SUM 2929, for the Defendant to provide particulars of specific passages of certain prior art relied on to invalidate the patents in question (“the Passage Requests”); and (c) the Defendant’s requests, in SUM 2935, for the Plaintiff to provide particulars of the alleged commercial success of one of the patents in question (“the Commercial Success Requests”).",
        "Background facts": "5 The Plaintiff is the proprietor of two Singapore Patents, namely Singapore Patent Numbers 115872 (“the ‘872 Patent”) and 110508 (“the ‘508 Patent”). (a) The ‘872 Patent is in respect of an optical quality synthetic single crystal chemical vapour deposition (“CVD”) diamond material and the method for its production. The CVD diamond material produced in relation to the ‘872 Patent allegedly has lower optical birefringence and optical absorption than conventional diamond material, allowing it to be used in a variety of industrial applications and also for lab-grown synthetic diamond gems for the jewellery industry. (b) The ‘508 Patent is in respect of a method of producing CVD diamonds of a desired colour, including the steps of heat treating the diamond under conditions suitable to produce the desired colour. This includes converting the colour of a CVD diamond from an undesirable colour, such as brown, to a near colourless or colourless form. 6 The Defendant is a company incorporated in Singapore. It deals in the manufacture and growth of CVD diamonds which are used in the mechanical, manufacturing, gems and jewellery industries. 7 In the following paragraphs, I set out aspects of the various pleadings that are of relevance to the three groups of requests addressed in this judgment. 8 In the Statement of Claim and Particulars of Infringement, the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant had infringed 33 claims in the ‘872 Patent and 24 claims in the ‘508 Patent. 9 In the Defence and Counterclaim, the Defendant averred that its business and acts relating to the manufacture and growth of CVD diamonds do not constitute infringement of the claims in the Patents. The Defendant further counterclaimed to revoke the Patents, on the basis that the inventions disclosed in the Patents lacked novelty, inventive step and/or were insufficiently disclosed in their specifications to be performed by a person skilled in the art. 10 Of particular relevance to the Combination Requests and the Passage Requests is the fact that the Defendant raised separate lists of prior art to challenge each of the asserted claims in the Patents. The lists of prior art were of varying length and composition (comprising 70 pieces of prior art in all), and some of the prior art were of considerable length (with eight pieces of prior art ranging from 22 pages to 248 pages each). As a sample list of prior art cited, the particulars supporting the Defendant’s attack on Claim 19 of the ‘872 Patent are as follows (this sample is subsequently referred to for the purposes of illustrations in [17] and [19(b)(i)] below): Particulars (a)  The alleged invention in Claim 19 of the ‘872 Patent involved no inventive step in that it was obvious to a person skilled in the art, having regard to the matter which formed part of the state of the art before the priority date of the alleged invention in Claim 19 of the ‘872 Patent. Hereunder the Defendant will rely upon the following, including but not limited to: (i)  All the documents and prior users referred to in paragraphs 25(a)(i) and 25(a)(ii) above; [These comprise the following: (i) Documents published in various scientific publications, journals and patent documents, such as: (A)  A paper entitled: ‘Status of the R&Ds on Diamond Particle Detectors’ – Mara Bruzzi; given at the 11th International Workshop on Vertex Detectors at the Ohana Keauhou Beach Resort 78-6740, Alii Drive, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii was presented between the 4 - 8 November 2002; (B)  A paper entitled ‘Analysis of Large Single Crystal CVD Diamond’ – J.E. Butler, T.A. Kennedy, J.S. Colton, S. Qadri, R. Linares, P. Doering, M. Newton, C. Glover, H. Smith & A.

Of particular relevance to the Commercial Success Requests is the Plaintiff’s averment that the ‘872 Patent’s inventiveness was evidenced,inter alia, by the commercial success of the Plaintiff’s single crystal CVD diamond products. The Plaintiff’s pleading in relation to commercial success is as follows: 42. The Plaintiff avers that the ‘872 Patent’s inventiveness is evidenced,inter alia, by the commercial success of the Plaintiff’s single crystal CVD diamond products which are used in optical and mechanical applications. Such products include, but are not limited to, attenuated total reflection prisms and blanks for high precision cutting applications.  Particulars a)  After the filing of the ‘872 Patent and with the production of the single crystal CVD diamond material made in accordance with the invention disclosed in the ‘872 Patent, the Plaintiff acquired a global market share of greater than 80% for single crystal CVD diamond material for use in optical products. b)  The market share for single crystal CVD diamond material for use in optical products sold by the Plaintiff is currently around 50% of total global sales. c)  The invention of the ‘872 Patent allowed the production of a single crystal CVD diamond material that had low optical birefringence. This product material was found to be advantageous for optical applications such as etalons and [attenuated total reflection] prisms when compared with prior art single crystal CVD diamond material.",
        "Legal principles on pleadings": "12 The key legal principles on pleadings are set out briefly in the following sub-paragraphs. (a) Each party must plead the “necessary particulars” of any claim, defence or other pleaded matter (O 18 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court). The Court may order a party to serve particulars of any pleading (O 18 r 12(3) of the Rules of Court). As explained inSingapore Civil Procedure 2017vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock JC gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2017) (“Singapore Civil Procedure”) at paragraph 18/12/2, the requirement to provide necessary particulars reflects the overriding principle that litigation between the parties should be conducted fairly, openly, without surprises and, as far as possible, to minimise costs. Particulars therefore serve to: (i) inform the opposing party of the nature of the case that it has to meet (contrathe mode by which the case is to be proved; see [12(b)] below);(ii) prevent the opposing party from being taken by surprise at trial;(iii) enable the opposing party to know what evidence they ought to prepare for trial;(iv) limit the generality of the pleadings, the claim, or the evidence;(v) limit and define the issues to be tried, and as to which discovery is required; and(vi) tie the hands of the pleading party, so that it cannot, without leave of court, go into any matters not pleaded. (b) Pleadings should state, and state only, thematerial factsrelied on, and not theevidenceby which these facts are to be proved (O 18 r 7 of the Rules of Court; and seeSingapore Civil Procedureat paragraph 18/7/1). An important factor that determines whether a request for further and better particulars will be granted is whether the particulars requested relate to material facts or evidence (SharikatLogistics Pte Ltd v Ong Boon Chuan and others[2011] SGHC 196 (“Sharikat”) at [8]). Material facts are the facts that are necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action, so that the opposing party is given fair notice of the case to be met and may direct his evidence to the relevant issues (EA Apartments Pte Ltd v TanBek[2017] 3 SLR 559 at [21]). In contrast, evidence refers to the “supporting facts” or “subordinate facts” that are means of proving the material facts. (c) Pleadings are to be drafted succinctly, and should be as brief as the nature of the case permits. However, a lengthy pleading will not be considered unnecessarily prolix if it merely states material facts (Singapore Civil Procedureat paragraph 18/7/6). 13 In the context of patent proceedings, it is necessary to further consider O 87A of the Rules of Court and other legal principles that apply specifically to this area. I will touch on these as and when they arise for consideration in the course of this judgment.",
        "The Combination Requests": "14 The Combination Requests are the Plaintiff’s requests for the Defendant to specify the combinations of prior art relied on to invalidate the Patents. These requests each relate to specific paragraphs in the Particulars of Objection, and take the following form: … Please specify each combination of the prior art/users that the Defendant is relying on in relation to the [novelty / inventive step] of Claim [number] of the [‘872 / ‘508] Patent. 15 The Combination Requests are premised on the possibility of a defendant combining various pieces of prior art to show that the invention is obvious in the light of the relevant state of the art; and in so doing, to invalidate the patent (see,eg,DienGhin Electronic (S) Pte Ltd v Khek Tai Ting (trading as Soon Heng Digitax)[2011] 3 SLR 227 (“DienGhin”)at [54]). This concept is commonly referred to as “mosaicking” (Mills & Rockley (Electronics)Limited v Technograph Printed Circuits Limited[1971] FSR 188 (“Mills”) at 193). A defendant wishing to rely on a “mosaic” to invalidate a patent must show that the “mosaic” can be put together by an “unimaginative man with no inventive capacity” (Millsat 193). 16 I note, parenthetically, that some of the Combination Requests related to the Defendant’s attack on “novelty” rather than “obviousness”. Mosaicking is generally permitted only in relation to the latter (see,eg,DienGhinat [29]contra[54], andMillsat 193). However, it appears that there may be an exception to this rule under English law (seeTerrell on the Law of Patents(Sweet & Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2017) at paragraph 11-63, citingSharpe &Dohme Inc v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd(1927) 44 RPC 367; (1928) 45 RPC 153), and in any event, I did not have to deal with this issue because the Defendant did not raise any objection on this ground.",
        "Parties’ arguments": "47 Defendant’s counsel cited O 87A r 3(5) of the Rules of Court as the justification for the Commercial Success Requests. O 87A r 3(5) of the Rules of Court provides as follows: Objections to validity of patent (O. 87A, r. 3) … (5) In any action or other proceedings relating to a patent in which the validity of the patent has been put in issue on the ground of obviousness, a party who wishes to rely on the commercial success of the patent must state in his pleadings thegroundsupon which he so relies. … [emphasis added] 48 She argued that the Commercial Success Requests fell within the ambit of the “grounds” referred to in O 87A r 3(5) of the Rules of Court, and are the “bare minimum particulars” that must be provided in order to fully plead such “grounds”. She cited the following authorities to buttress her argument: (a) First,Singapore Court Practice 2017(Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2017) (“Singapore Court Practice”) at paragraph 87A/3/2: … [a patentee relying upon the commercial success of his invention] must plead the grounds upon which he so relies. The word ‘grounds’ in O 87A r 3(5)does not merely refer to identifying the product and setting out thenumber of sales. It has been held that the patentee is required to identify the defect in the prior art (if any), how it was overcome, whether long-felt want was sought to be established and, if so, how it was to be established (JohnDeks v Azler Washer[1989] RPC 413; see alsoMuhlbauerAG v Manufacturing Integration Technology Ltd[2010] 2 SLR 724 (CA), at [104]-[107]… where the Court of Appeal makes important observations on the role of commercial success in patent disputes). … [emphasis added] (b) Second, the English decision ofJohnDeks Limited v Aztec Washer Company[1989] RPC 413 (“JohnDeks”). Defendant’s counsel contended that the particulars ordered inJohnDekswere no different from the particulars sought in the Commercial Success Requests, and indeed, the court inJohnDekswent even further to order particulars despite the plaintiff having already provided a schedule of the sales of the plaintiff’s patented product. Defendant’s counsel also citedSchlumberger Holdings Ltd v ElectromagneticGeoservices AS[2010] EWCA 819 (“Schlumberger”), where the English Court of Appeal set out a detailed and non-exhaustive list of matters that are relevant to a commercial success claim. These related to defects in prior art and long-felt want (Schlumbergerat [80]). AlthoughSchlumbergerwas not concerned with what “grounds” ought to be pleaded, Defendant’s counsel submitted that the fact that these matters are necessary for succeeding in a claim of commercial success, must mean that they are material facts which must be pleaded. (c) Third, the relevant pleading precedent inBullen& Leake & Jacob’s Singapore Precedents of Pleadings(Jeffrey Pinsler SC gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2016) (“Singapore Precedents of Pleadings”). Defendant’s counsel submitted that the Commercial Success Requests should be allowed as they mirrored the first four sets of particulars in the relevant precedent (Singapore Precedents of Pleadingsat 995): 4.  Without prejudice to the general denial that the patent is invalid on the grounds of obviousness alleged or at all, the Plaintiff will rely upon the commercial success of the invention the subject matter of the patent, [both in Singapore and abroad]. Particulars (1)  The Plaintiff’s [products bearing the product codes or process used to manufacture [product]] since [date] were made in accordance with the claims of the Patent. (2)  A summary of [the sales of each such product or the annual revenues received by the Plaintiff from the use of the process] is set out in the Schedule [A] annexed hereto for each year since [date]. (3)  A summary of sales for the [equivalent product marketed before the patented products or prior equivalent process used by the Plaintiff to manufacture [product]] is set out in Schedule [B] annexed hereto. (4)  A summary of the Plaintiff’s expenditure which supported the [marketing of the products or process] mentioned is contained in Schedule [C] annexed here to. (5)  The defects in the existing art were [particulars]. These defects were overcome by the Patent by [particulars]. (6)  As to the existence of long felt want, the Plaintiff will rely upon [particulars]. [emphasis added] 49 Plaintiff’s counsel objected to the Commercial Success Requests on the basis that these requests sought information that was, pursuant to the Rules of Court, properly intended for the discovery stage. He pointed out that the Commercial Success Requests sought precisely the same information required in the schedule mentioned in O 87A r 5(3) of the Rules of Court (“the O 87A r 5(3) schedule”). As such, allowing the requests would render O 87A r 5(3) of the Rules of Court nugatory. He also emphasised that, in any event, the Plaintiff had already provided the Defendant with the O 87A r 5(3) schedule, and therefore that the Defendant already had the necessary information on hand. 50 Defendant’s counsel counter-argued that there was a functional difference between discovery and particulars. Specifically, the latter would tie the hands of the pleading party and prevent him from going into matters not pleaded. As such, despite the fact that the O 87A r 5(3) schedule had already been provided, this did not absolve the Plaintiff of the need to provide the information by way of particulars. Defendant’s counsel further submitted that the Commercial Success Requests should be granted, in view that the Plaintiff’s O 87A r 5(3) schedule was insufficient (for failing to show the sales of the Plaintiff’s products prior to 2005 and the money spent on advertising the Plaintiff’s products).",
        "Decision": "51 In determining whether the Commercial Success Requests should be ordered, it is necessary to consider the scheme relating to the provision of information on commercial success, as envisaged in O 87A rr 3(5) and 5 of the Rules of Court. 52 I first briefly sketch the discovery regime established by O 87A r 5 of the Rules of Court (“the Commercial Success Discovery Regime”). In essence, documents relating to commercial success are exempted from the usual general discovery process (O 87A r 5(1) and (2) of the Rules of Court). Instead, such documents only have to be stated in the O 87A r 5(3) schedule. The relevant provisions are as follows: Discovery of documents (O. 87A, r. 5) 5.—(1) Order 24 shall apply in an action for infringement of a patent or a declaration of non-infringement of a patent or any proceedings where the validity of a patent is in issue, except that documents from the exempt classes shall not be listed. (2)   The exempt classes are — … (c)  documents relating to the issue of commercial success. (3)  Where the issue of commercial success arises in any proceedings specified in paragraph (1), the proprietor of the patent shall serve a schedule containing the following details: (a)  where the commercial success relates to an article or product — (i)  an identification of the article or product (for example by product code number) which the proprietor asserts has been made in accordance with the claims of the patent; (ii)  a summary by convenient periods of sales of any such article or product; (iii)  a summary for the equivalent periods of sales, if any, of any equivalent prior article or product marketed before the article or product mentioned in sub‑paragraph (i); and (iv)  a summary by convenient periods of any expenditure on advertising and promotion which supported the marketing of the articles or products mentioned in sub‑paragraphs (i) and (iii); (b)  where the commercial success relates to the use of a process — (i)  an identification of the process which the proprietor asserts has been used in accordance with the claims of the patent; (ii)  a summary by convenient periods of the revenues received from the use of such process; (iii)  a summary for the equivalent periods of the revenues, if any, received from the use of any equivalent prior art process; and (iv)  a summary by convenient periods of any expenditure which supported the use of the process mentioned in sub‑paragraphs (i) and (iii). 53 I next turn to consider the ambit of the “grounds” referred to in O 87A r 3(5) of the Rules of Court. The Rules of Court do not elaborate on what the required “grounds” are, and there is no Singapore case authority on this point. The only case authority submitted to me was that ofJohnDeks, which has also been cited inSingapore Court Practice(see [48(a)] above).JohnDeksisprima facieof persuasive value, given that the decision was premised on the English precursor to O 87A r 3(5) of the Rules of Court (viz,O 104 r 6(5) of the UK Rules of the Supreme Court (“UK RSC”)). 54 InJohnDeks, the defendants requested for particulars of the plaintiff’s commercial success claim. The plaintiff provided a schedule of the “best record of such sales at present available to the plaintiffs and examples of the plaintiffs’ said products are available for inspection…” (JohnDeksat 414). Dissatisfied with this, the defendant sought further and better particulars relating to alleged defects in the prior art, as well as the plaintiff’s claim that a long-felt want had been answered by the plaintiff’s products. The requests made were as follows: (1) State whether it is alleged that the alleged commercial success is due to the fact that the patented product overcame some defect in the prior art and if so, what that defect was. (2) Specify what attributes of the patented product it is alleged overcame the alleged defect if any. (3) State whether it is alleged that there was a demand in the United Kingdom at or before the priority date of the patent in suit for seal devices which overcame this defect, and if so, give particulars of all facts and matters relied on in support of such allegation and identify all material documents. (4) If it is alleged that such demand existed, state how long it is alleged that such demand existed before the priority date of the patent in suit, giving particulars of all facts and matters relied on in support of such allegation and identifying all material documents. 55 The court allowed these requests and ordered the plaintiff to furnish the relevant particulars. In arriving at its decision, the court stated that a commercial success pleading required “more than just setting out the sales and identifying the products”; specifically, the pleading should identify the patentee’s case (JohnDeksat 416): … with sufficient particularity to enable the defendants to know the case they have to meet and in particular what is the defect, if there be one, how it was overcome and whether long-felt want is being sought to be established and, if so, how the plaintiffs are going to say they are going to establish it. 56 On its face, the decision ofJohnDeksappears to suggest that identification of products and setting out sales and expenditure on advertising should generally be granted, or, as Defendant’s counsel put it, a “bare minimum” (see [48] above). Indeed, the court had gone further, to require particularisation of any alleged defects in the prior art and any claim relating to a long-felt want being answered by the plaintiff’s products. 57 However, the analysis is not quite as straightforward. At the timeJohnDekswas decided (ie12 December 1988), the English precursor to Singapore’s Commercial Success Discovery Regime had not yet been introduced. 58 It was onlysubsequentto the decision inJohnDeks, on 1 October 1995, that the UK RSC was amended to introduce the Commercial Success Discovery Regime (ieO 104 rr 11(2)(c) and 11(3) of the UK RSC, which are the English precursors to O 87A rr 5(2)(c) and 5(3) of the Rules of Court). The Regime was introduced to address the problem of potentially prolix discovery in relation to commercial success, which is brought about by the fact that virtually every commercial document produced relating to a product or process may be relevant to the success of that product or process (seeCivil Procedure 2016at paragraph 2F-10.4; for an illustration of voluminous discovery potentially required in relation to commercial success prior to the introduction of the Commercial Success Discovery Regime see,eg,MolnyckeA B and Another v Procter & Gamble Ltd and another[1990] RPC 498). Limiting discovery to the matters specified in the schedule would save considerable time and expense (see,eg,LillyIcos Limited v Pfizer Limited[2002] EWCA at [14]). Today, a similar Commercial Success Discovery Regime continues to apply under the UK Civil Procedure Rules (Practice Direction 63 paragraphs 6.1(3) and 6.3). 59 The Commercial Success Discovery Regime has been described by commentators as envisaging a framework within which there isdistinct and detailedparticularisation of issues relating to commercial success, butlimiteddiscovery of material relevant hereto (see,eg,UK Supreme Court Practice 1999at paragraphs 104/6/10 (“in many cases… [discovery will] be replaced by much more detailed pleadings”) and 104/11/1 (“[discovery as to commercial success] will not be given, but instead detailed particulars must be given by the party alleging it”). 60 However, the question that remains is this: what is the ambit of “grounds” in O 87A r 3(5) of the Rules of Court, subsequent to the introduction of the Commercial Success Discovery Regime? 61 To the extent that the court inJohnDekscould be understood as having accepted that product identification and setting out the number of sales should be particularised (although this was not actually in issue before the court, given that those information had already been provided by the plaintiff – see [54] above), this proposition must now be considered in the light of the Commercial Success Discovery Regime. 62 As a matter of logic and statutory interpretation, the “grounds” in O 87A r 3(5) of the Rules of Court should not be interpreted to require information that is identical to the information required in the O 87A r 5(3) schedule; otherwise, O 87A r 5(3) of the Rules of Court would be rendered otiose. Instead, the “grounds” referred to in O 87A r 3(5) of the Rules of Court should be interpreted to relate to other important matters that ought to be pleaded in relation to a commercial success claim, including, for instance, particulars relating to defects in prior art and long-felt want. These were, indeed, the precise particulars that the court inJohnDekswas concerned with. The factors enumerated inSchlumbergeralso related to defects in prior art and long-felt want (Schlumbergerat [80]). Such particulars are also captured at paragraphs 5 and 6 of the relevant pleading precedent inSingapore Precedents of Pleadings(see [48(c)] above). 63 In view that the Commercial Success Requests are targeted entirely at material properly reserved for discovery pursuant to O 87A r 3(5) of the Rules of Court, I disallow the Commercial Success Requests. For completeness, I will also address Defendant’s counsel’s submission that the Plaintiff’s O 87A r 5(3) schedule did not provide sufficient information (see [50] above). The sufficiency of the Plaintiff’s O 87A r 5(3) schedule isnotbefore me, as SUM 2935 relates to the Defendant’s application for further and better particulars. The provision of particulars is not an appropriate avenue for supplementing or supplanting allegedly defective discovery.",
        "The Passage Requests": "31 The Passage Requests are the Plaintiff’s requests for the Defendant to pinpoint specific passages of certain prior art relied on by the Defendant. These requests each relate to specific paragraphs in the Particulars of Objection, and take the following form: … (b) For each combination containing the prior art [name of prior art], please specify the passage(s) therein relied on by providing page, paragraph and/or line numbers. (c) For each combination containing the prior art [name of prior art], please specify the passage(s) therein relied on by providing page, paragraph and/or line numbers. [thesame form is repeated for each asserted piece of prior art]…",
        "The Commercial Success Requests": "46 The Commercial Success Requests are the Defendant’s requests for the Plaintiff to provide particulars of the alleged commercial success of the ‘872 patent. The Defendant sought the following particulars: (i)  Where the commercial success relates to article(s) or product(s), including but not limited to the alleged products which are used in optical and mechanical applications:- a.  A specific identification of all and each such article or product which the Plaintiff asserts has been made in accordance with the claims of the ‘872 Patent, specifying the article or product that was made for use in optical applications and that was made for use in mechanical applications; b.  A summary by convenient periods of sales of each such article or product; c.  A summary for the equivalent periods of sales, if any, of all and each equivalent prior article or product sold/marketed before the article or product mentioned in sub-paragraph (i)(a); and d.  A summary by convenient periods of any expenditure on advertising and promotion which supported the marketing (for sale or otherwise) of the articles or products mentioned in sub-paragraphs (i)(a) and (i)(c). (ii)  Where the commercial success relates to the use of a process, including but not limited to the process, if any, that synthesized the alleged products which are used in optical and mechanical applications:- a.  A specific identification of the process, including but not limited to growth, post process annealing, cutting, shaping, polishing, doping, irradiation and/or any intentionally imposed conditions, the patentee asserts has been used in accordance with the claims of the ‘872 Patent; b.  A summary by convenient periods of the revenues received from the use of such process; c.  A summary for the equivalent periods of the revenues, if any, received from the use of any equivalent prior process; and d.  A summary by convenient periods of any expenditure which supported the use of the process mentioned in subparagraphs (ii)(a) and (ii)(c).",
