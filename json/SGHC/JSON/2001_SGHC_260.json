        "Off-Shore Accounts": "2. It is not in dispute that money deposits are normally deposited in accounts in their\n\nrespective countries of origin. Such accounts are known as on-shore accounts. An off-shore\n\naccount, on the other hand, is an account opened with and operated by a bank (the\n\noff-shore bank) to carry out money transactions on behalf of the customer outside the\n\ncountry of origin of the currency in question. In 1997 the Malaysian government imposed\n\nexchange control restrictions. This led to a scarcity of MYR. As a consequence, off-shore\n\nbanks were offering substantially higher interest rates for the deposits of MYR in\n\noff-shore accounts. The plaintiffs legitimately took advantage of this and placed deposits\n\nof MYR with the defendants. At the same time, they entered into forward contracts to sell\n\nMYR to the Public Bank in Malaysia. In the absence of any default or intervening events,\n\nthe plaintiffs expected to make some profit from this back-to-back exercise. The off-shore\n\nbank on its part, would utilize the deposits of foreign currencies in the foreign exchange\n\nmarket; in the buying and selling of the currencies on the sage principle of \"buying\n\nlow and selling high\". Invariably, the banks adopt various counter-measures to\n\nminimise the effects of drastic swings in the prices of the currencies due, for example,\n\nto currency devaluation or some other phenomenon. Thus, foreign exchange markets and\n\noff-shore deposits are capable of spewing generous profits in a process that is laced with\n\nrisks that commensurating with profits.",
        "The Claim And Defence": "3. The nature and basis of the plaintiffs claim are straightforward. They say that when\n\ntheir MYR deposits matured on 3 September 1998 they were entitled to withdraw them in MYR.\n\nPayment was, however, made by the defendants on 8 September, not in MYR but in US dollars\n\nat the rate of MYR4.00 to US$1.00. The plaintiffs had their own commitments to fulfil,\n\nnamely to pay various sums in ringgits to the Public Bank in Kuala Lumpur. They were,\n\ntherefore, obliged to purchase MYR in Malaysia to make good that commitment. Unfortunately\n\nfor them the exchange rate they paid was MYR3.80 to US$1.00. Their claim in this suit was\n\nthe difference of 0.20 cents between the rate used by the defendants in payment to the\n\nplaintiffs and the rate the plaintiffs had to pay on the re-conversion in Malaysia. This\n\ndifference amounted to the sum of US$162,401.79 the sum claimed by the plaintiffs in their\n\nstatement of claim.4. The defendants resisted the claim with the alternative defences of payment under an\n\nexpress, alternatively, an implied term of the contract, and frustration of the contract.\n\nBy their first defence (the express term defence), the defendants averred that by cl 12 of\n\nthe contract with the plaintiffs the defendants were not obliged to effect payment in any\n\nspecific currency if that currency was not available. Under their second alternative\n\ndefence (the implied term defence), they averred that the plaintiffs knew or ought to have\n\nknown that if the defendants were unable to deliver MYR off-shore they were entitled to\n\ndeliver payment in an alternative currency, in this case, in United States dollars.\n\nThirdly, (the frustration defence) they averred that by reason of exchange control\n\nmeasures instituted by the Malaysian government on 1 September 1998 and subsequently\n\nmodified, the contract of deposit between the parties was frustrated in law.",
        "The Exchange Control Measures": "5. It was common knowledge that in 1998 the MYR as well as some other Asian currencies\n\nwere subject to substantial capital outflows. If that continued unchecked, the foreign\n\nexchange reserves of the country in question would be greatly reduced and,\n\ncorrespondingly, the pressure to devalue that currency would have increased. It is not\n\nunusual for governments of an embattled currency to impose exchange control restrictions\n\nin its efforts to stabilize the situation. In the present case, however, the exchange\n\ncontrol measures of the Malaysian government imposed on 1 September 1998 was described as\n\n\"sudden, draconian, wide-sweeping in timing and effect, and unprecedented\" by\n\nProf. Heinz Riehl an expert witness for the defendants. I refer to \"measures\" in\n\nthe plural form because various announcements and clarifications were shortly and\n\nsubsequently issued thereafter in response to enquiries from the frenzied market\n\ninstitutions. According to the defendants and their experts, the clarifications and\n\nsubsequent announcements only exacerbated the confusion prevailing in the financial\n\nmarkets after the initial announcement declared by Bank Negara with the heading:\n\n\"Measures To Regain Monetary Independence\". The relevant regulation was\n\nstipulated as follows:\"Approval is required for transfer of funds between External Accounts. Transfer to\n\n  residents accounts are permitted only until 30 September 1998; thereafter, approval is\n\n  required. Withdrawal of ringgit from External Accounts require approval, except for the\n\n  purchase of ringgit assets.\"It is true that economic measures are not uncommon, but the term \"economic\n\nmeasures\" is a general term and is of little significance in itself. It is the\n\nspecific measures themselves that is vital. For example, a government may declare that as\n\nan economic measure it will suspend the import of potatoes. That may have little or no\n\nimpact on private contracts unless the parties, for example, are potato traders, and even\n\nso, much depends on what the measures to be implemented were.6. An External Account strictly speaking, is a MYR account opened by a non-resident in\n\nMalaysia with on-shore banks. However, in practice, MYR accounts opened by non-residents\n\nwith off-shore banks are also regarded as \"External Accounts\" in the present\n\ncontext because they are affected in the same way by the exchange control notifications;\n\nthat is because the off-shore bank will have to open an External Account, principally for\n\nsettlement purposes, with an on-shore bank.7. On 2 September, Bank Negara announced that the exchange rate for MYR was fixed at\n\nMYR3.80 to US$1.00. A further statement of the same date announced that: \"All\n\nsettlement for transactions executed prior 1st September 1998 will only be allowed to be\n\neffected until 4th September 1998. Authorised dealers must verify evidences of all\n\ntransactions before effecting the settlement on behalf of their customers\" sic. A\n\nthird notification was issued also within the day, stating:\"All foreign exchange contracts, contracts for the sale and purchase of securities\n\n  entered into prior to 1300 hours on 1 September 1998, transfers between External Accounts\n\n  for settlement of such contracts would be allowed until 9 September 1998. For contracts\n\n  that are due for settlement after 9 September 1998, Bank Negara Malaysia would be\n\n  introducing mechanisms to ensure that the ability of market players to fulfil their\n\n  Ringgit obligations would not be jeopardised following the implementation of the new\n\n  rules. Bank Negara Malaysia will issue another circular on this matter by the end of the\n\n  week\".It transpired that no further circulars were issued but a further clarification was\n\nmade. In this clarification dated 4 September the relevant portion was set out under item\n\n7 as follows:\"All settlement for forex transaction and contracts for the sales of securities\n\n  executed prior to 1300 hours on 1 September 1998 will only be allowed to be effected until\n\n  9 September 1998. Authorised dealers must verify evidences before effecting settlement on\n\n  behalf of their customers. Settlement through transfers between external accounts will be\n\n  allowed during this period.\"",
        "Effect And Response Generally": "8. The purpose of the 1 September regulation was to put an end to the activities of\n\n\"currency speculators\". I am using this term in parenthesis because it is\n\ndifficult to define, more so identify, a currency speculator; but it was the term in use\n\nat that time as a general reference to people and institutions whose market activities\n\nwere destabilizing the MYR. Because of the difficulty of definition and identification,\n\nthe term could be applied indiscriminately to all, including the plaintiffs and defendants\n\nalike. The initial announcement on 1 September 1998 put an end to the liberty of foreign\n\nexchange market participants to settle their accounts on maturity date because the\n\nmechanism of transfer - the External Account - was broken and cannot be used without the\n\napproval of Bank Negara. Mr. Fong Kwok Jen, counsel for the plaintiffs, constantly\n\nreminded the defendants' witnesses that the Malaysian measures on 1 September did not\n\nirremediably prevent transfers between External Accounts. Each time the answer was, either\n\ndirectly or to the effect, that free transferability of funds was crucial in the viability\n\nof the off-shore foreign money market. The mere requirement that approval has to be sought\n\ndestroys the certitude of settlement essential to the market. Prof. Heinz Riehl said that\n\nit was not a case of changing the rules of the ball game. He emphasized that the measures\n\nof 1 September removed the ball altogether. The gush of anxiety from committed players may\n\nhave led to the subsequent clarifications from Bank Negara. The evidence of Prof. Riehl,\n\nMr. Rolf Willi (another expert witness for the defendant and the then Managing Director of\n\nTreasury in the Dresdner Bank in South East Asia), and Mr. Foo Soo Liang the Senior\n\nManager of the defendants were of the view that given the varying degrees and stages of\n\ncommitments made by the off-shore banks, the announcements by Bank Negara made it\n\nimpossible for the banks to settle their commitments as they mature. In the off-shore\n\nmoney market almost no single transaction stands by itself. Every transaction creates a\n\ncascade of other transactions or what the defendants describe as \"inter-locking\n\ntransactions\". Thus Prof. Riehl deposed that the economic measures of September 1998\n\neliminated the off-shore market for MYR interest rates and US dollar v MYR exchange rates.\n\nThe foreign exchange committees, traders, and institutions all over the world held\n\nemergency meetings to deal with the chaos from the destruction of the off-shore MYR\n\nmarket. ( 82-84 Riehl)9. Mr. Fong summed up the three critical issues very neatly before me. First, whether\n\nthere was an express term of the deposit contract between the plaintiffs and defendants\n\nthat the defendants are \"absolved from liability\" to deliver MYR to the\n\nplaintiffs when MYR became subject to exchange control measures such as those imposed in\n\nSeptember 1998. Secondly, whether there is an implied term to the effect that should the\n\ndefendants be unable to deliver MYR off-shore, they are entitled to effect delivery in an\n\nalternative currency; in this case, in US dollar. Thirdly, whether the deposit contract\n\nwas frustrated by the exchange control measures imposed by the Malaysian government in\n\nSeptember 1998.",
        "The Express Term": "10. The express term in question was cl 12 of the Terms and Conditions issued by the\n\ndefendants. The relevant portions namely 12(a), (b) and (c) are set out as follows:\"12. (a) If the Bank concludes a transaction with the Customer (e.g. a forward\n\n  exchange transaction), as a result of which it owes the Customer an amount of foreign\n\n  currency, it shall meet its foreign-currency liability by means of a credit entry on the\n\n  account of the Customer in this currency (foreign-currency account), unless an arrangement\n\n  exists to the contrary.(b) Drawings on credit balances on foreign-currency accounts (e.g. by means of transfer\n\n  orders to the debit of the foreign-currency balance) shall be handled directly or, with\n\n  the involvement of intermediate offices, through banks in the native country of the\n\n  currency, if the Bank is unable to execute them completely within its own institution.(c) The obligation of the Bank to meet a foreign-currency liability (para. 1) or to\n\n  execute a drawing to the debit of a foreign-currency balance (para. 2) shall be suspended\n\n  to the extent that and for such time as the Bank, on account of politically related\n\n  measures or events in the country of this currency, is unable to draw in the currency in\n\n  which the claims or the foreign-currency balance is denominated, or only to a limited\n\n  degree. Nor shall the Bank, to the extent that and for such time as these measures or\n\n  events last, be obliged to perform at another location outside the country of the\n\n  currency, in another currency (including Singapore dollars) or by the procurement of cash.\n\n  However, the obligation of the Bank to perform drawings to the debit of foreign-currency\n\n  balances (para. 2) shall not be suspended if the Bank is able to execute them completely\n\n  within its own institution.\"11. Clause 12 is straightforward. The main contention here is whether the Malaysian\n\neconomic control measures of 1 September 1998 falls within the definition of the phrase\n\n\"on account of politically related measures\". I think that it does. In my view,\n\nthe natural meaning to be given to this phrase, in particular, the word\n\n\"political\", must include any matter that pertains to policy or government. Such\n\nwas the approach by McCullough J in R v Radio Authority, ex parte Bull [1969] QB 169. The\n\neconomic control measures of 1 September 1998 were instituted by the Malaysian government\n\nin the interests of its national economy. In a business report admitted by the parties in\n\nthe agreed bundle, the Malaysian Prime Minister stated to the effect that it was this\n\ngovernment's objective to render the off-shore ringgit valueless through the imposition of\n\nthe economic measures. Under such circumstances, I think that it is fair and natural to\n\ndescribe the economic control measures to be a politically related event or measure within\n\nthe meaning of cl 12. On the basis of that clause alone the plaintiffs case would fail.\n\nThe plaintiffs' counsel Mr. Fong submitted that cl 12(c) does not apply because \"the\n\ndefendants have no obligations save to repay Ringgit obligations save in Malaysia.\"\n\nHowever, I do not see this alleged term anywhere in the contract and there is no basis to\n\nimply such a term.",
        "Implied Term": "12. The defendants submit that the following terms should be implied in the contract:\"(a) that the delivery of MYR depended on the continuing free and unimpeded\n\n  operation of the off-shore market;(b) that in the event that MYR could not be delivered because the off-shore market for\n\n  that currency had been eliminated or ceased to exist, an alternative currency could be\n\n  delivered through the off-shore market; and(c) that the US$ was an acceptable alternative currency for that purpose.\"The classic propositions as to when a court would imply a term into a contract are set\n\nout in an assembly of well known cases including The Moorcock (1889) 14 PD 64, and Shirlaw\n\nv Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd [1939] 2 KB 206 with MacKinnon LJ's \"officious\n\nbystander test\", at p.227. Naturally, the more complex the term, the less likely it\n\nwill be to cajole the officious bystander into the resounding \"but of course\"\n\nreply that is so essential to the application of that test. Consequently, there appears to\n\nbe another test, sometimes referred to as an alternative test, based on the interests of\n\n\"business efficacy\". There are also distinguished authorities such as Lister v\n\nRomford Ice & Cold Storage Co Ltd [1957] 1 AER 125,133 and Liverpool City Council v\n\nIrwin & Anor[1977] AC 239, 254 which draw a distinction between implying a term on the\n\nbasis of business efficacy and implying a term from the nature of the contract itself. And\n\nit will be seen from the opinion of Lord Bridge in Scally v Southern Health & Social\n\nServices Board [1992] 1 AC 294, 307 that the two forms are clearly separate and distinct.\n\nFinally, Chao Hick Tin JA in Hiap Hong & Co Pte Ltd v Hong Huat Development Co (Pte)\n\nLtd[2001] 2 SLR 458emphasized that \"in considering the question of implied terms,\n\nit must be borne in mind that the touchstone is necessity and not merely\n\nreasonableness.\" Karthigesu JA in an earlier decision in Bethlehem Singapore Pte Ltd\n\nv Ler Hock Seng[1995] 1 SLR 1was of the same view. I need not refer to the numerous\n\nother authorities on this point save to say that general point is that the courts do not\n\nimply a term merely because it is reasonable, but because the necessity of doing so was so\n\nobviously necessary.13. Mr. Ang submitted on behalf of the defendants that the accounts of the plaintiffs\n\nwith the defendants were expressed in their respective contracts to be\n\n\"multi-currency\" and \"various currency\" accounts. As such, he\n\nsubmitted that this \"is one factor in favour of an implied term that performance of\n\nthe obligation to pay the currency obligation can be undertaken in an alternative\n\nacceptable currency.\"(sic) I am unable to agree with that. In the absence of evidence\n\nexplaining what those words mean, the reference to \"multi-currency\" and\n\n\"various currency\" in such accounts must mean that the plaintiffs may deposit\n\nvarious currency in the one account. If there is any implied term it is probably more\n\nlikely that one should imply that the payment should be in the same currency. In an\n\nordinary case, when a depositor makes a foreign currency deposit he would expect to be\n\nrepaid in that currency unless there is prior agreement to the contrary. I think that that\n\nwould be the reasonable response of MacKinnon LJ's officious bystander. If the bank is\n\npermitted to pay out in a different currency the exchange rate must have been agree before\n\nhand otherwise disputes are likely to arise. The customer may also have personal reasons\n\nwhy he wants payment in the same currency; for example, he may, as in this case, have\n\ncommitted himself in a forward contract elsewhere. Therefore, I am of the view that the\n\nlaw and the facts do not sustain a defence based on the implied terms as pleaded.",
        "Frustration Of Contract": "14. I now come to the third and final defence, that is, frustration of the contract by\n\nreason of the Malaysian economic control measures of 1 September 1998. The doctrine of\n\nfrustration of contract is a well-developed and matured principle. In its basic form the\n\ndoctrine appears to arise by way of an implied term, but the inadequacy of this basis is\n\nneatly exposed by the \"escaped tiger\" illustration in Lord Sands' judgment in\n\nJames Scott & Sons Ltd v Del Sel [1922] S.C. 592, 597. Lord Reid in Davis Contractors\n\nLtd v Fareham Urban District Council [1956] AC 696, 720 was equally emphatic that it would\n\nhardly be reasonable to imply a term into a milk contract that the milkman is not obliged\n\nto deliver milk in the event of an escaped tiger, or as he puts it, \"tiger days\n\nexcepted\". The better approach, in my view, is to regard it as a question of\n\nconstruction. Lord Reid was of the view that \"frustration depends, at least in most\n\ncases, not on adding an implied term, but on the true construction of the terms which are\n\nin the contract read in the light of the contract and of the relevant surrounding\n\ncircumstances when the contract was made.\" Ibid, p.721. Lord Radcliffe gave a broad\n\nworking definition in these general words: \"frustration occurs whenever the law\n\nrecognizes that without default on either party a contractual obligation has become\n\nincapable of being performed because the circumstances in which performance is called for\n\nwould render it a thing radically different from that which was undertaken by the\n\ncontract.\" p.729. He went on to emphasize that \"it is not hardship or\n\ninconvenience or material loss itself which calls the principles of frustration into\n\nplay\". It is clear that the Law Lords preferred to keep the doctrine of frustration\n\nwithin very narrow limits, and I humbly believe that good sense requires that to be so.15. In classic cases of frustration a specific article under contemplation by the\n\ncontracting parties becomes unavailable through no fault of either party. Such cases are\n\nmore conducive to the application of the doctrine than cases, for example, where a seller\n\nhas promised to deliver general goods. In the latter situation, it will obviously be\n\ndifficult for the seller to claim that his inability to deliver was due to an unexpected\n\ncatastrophic destruction of the goods leading to a worldwide shortage, whether or not he\n\nwas at fault. But all contracts turn on their own terms and circumstances. In this case,\n\none of the unchallenged facts is that the money in questioned were deposited in MYR in an\n\noff-shore account with the defendant bank. It is not an ordinary deposit account. One of\n\nthe unusual features of this case is that although the subject matter appears ostensibly\n\nas just a sum of money in Malaysian denomination, the truth, from the unchallenged\n\nevidence of the experts, is that the real subject matter is the MYR in the off-shore\n\nmarket - not MYR in Malaysia or MYR in a moneychanger's counter at Robinson Road. That\n\nbeing the case, the fact (unchallenged) established by the experts, is that the entire\n\noff-shore market for MYR was wiped out by the announcement of the ECMs of 1 September\n\n1998. I should point out that the \"fact\" of market destruction is well within\n\nthe purview of Prof. Riehl and Mr. Rolf Willi. The evidence which I also accept is that\n\nthe subsequent announcements increased the uncertainty rather than allay them. The one\n\nstark fact therefore, was that when the plaintiffs' deposits matured there were no MYR\n\navailable for payment. That situation was brought about directly by the economic control\n\nmeasures of the Malaysian government in pursuing its legitimate national objective. The\n\nfall-out effect, however, affected parties like the plaintiffs and the defendants in this\n\ncase, but the situation cannot be regarded as a fault attributable to either party to the\n\ncontract, and in such circumstances, I am inclined to find that the contract was\n\nfrustrated. I accept that this consequence came about as the end of a spectrum but the\n\nevidence so ably led by Prof. Riehl and Mr. Rolf Willi put it beyond doubt that if this\n\nwas a question of degree, it could not have been any worse. Hence, this is not a case of a\n\nforeseeable risk come to pass by reason of a government action in which an off-shore\n\ncurrency becomes depleted and scarce but the complete eradication of the off-shore market\n\nin MYR at that time..",
        "The Rate Fixed By the SFEMC": "16. Having found as I do above, I ought for completeness, now consider whether the\n\nexchange rate of MYR 4.00 to one US$ a fair and reasonable rate. This rate was recommended\n\nby the Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee after consultation with the\n\nrepresentatives of the major banks as well as the Monetary Authority of Singapore. It was\n\nnot the plaintiffs' case that the recommendation was unfair, but that it resulted in a\n\nloss to them. As Mr. Ang pointed out, what one customer loses, another gains. The SFEMC\n\nintervened in order to re-stabilize the market, and its recommendation was based on the\n\nneed to find a fair rate all-round. And consequently, the Committee in its wisdom\n\nconcluded that the rate of MYR 4.00 to the US$ was fair. Individual redress for everyone\n\nadversely affected was obviously impossible. In the circumstances, the can be no question\n\nthat the rate used by the defendants to settle the plaintiffs' accounts was correct.17. For the reasons above, the plaintiffs' claim fails and is accordingly dismissed. I\n\nshall hear the question of costs at a later date if the parties are unable to agree\n\nbetween themselves.- Sgd -",
