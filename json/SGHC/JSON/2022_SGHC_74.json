        "Introduction": "1 From 1 April 2018 to 26 June 2019, the defendant, Mr Pawan Kumar Jagetia (“Mr Jagetia”), was employed as the Senior Vice President (“SVP”) of the plaintiff, Carlsberg South Asia Pte Ltd (“CSAPL”). Following the termination of Mr Jagetia’s employment, CSAPL claims against him for a purported breach of his employment contract (the “CSAPL SVP Contract”). Mr Jagetia denies the claim, and counterclaims for various sums allegedly owing to him. Having considered the evidence before me and the parties’ submissions, I dismiss CSAPL’s claim, and allow Mr Jagetia’s counterclaim in part. These are my reasons.",
        "Facts": "",
        "The parties and other personalities": "2 CSAPL is a Singapore-registered holding company which owns 100% of another Singapore-registered company, South Asian Breweries Pte Ltd (“SOAB”) and 90% of a Nepal-registered company, Gorkha Brewery Pvt Ltd (“GBPL”). In turn, SOAB owns 99.99% of an India-registered company, Carlsberg India Pvt Ltd (“CIPL”). CIPL and GBPL sell beverages in India and Nepal respectively.1Foot Note 1×Troels Libak Stollberg’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) (“TLSA”) at para 6. 3 CSAPL is a joint venture between Carlsberg Breweries A/S (“CBAS”) and CSAPL (Singapore) Holdings Pte Ltd (“CSAPLH”). CBAS is part of the global brewery group to be referred to as the “Carlsberg Group”. CSAPLH is owned and controlled, through a series of trust companies, by Mr Chandra Prakash Khetan, a Nepali businessman.2Foot Note 2×TLSA at para 7. 4 As CSAPL is owned by CBAS and CSAPLH with a two-thirds and one-third shareholding respectively, its board consists of directors nominated by CBAS and CSAPLH in proportion to their respective shareholdings. Two-thirds of CSAPL’s board (ie, 4 persons) are nominated by CBAS while one-third (ie, 2 persons) is nominated by CSAPLH.3Foot Note 3×TLSA at para 8; Pawan Kumar Jagetia’s AEIC (“PKJA”) at para 5; Yeo Soon Keong’s AEIC (“YSKA”) at para 4. 5 In support of its claim, CSAPL called four witnesses. Mr Graham Fewkes (“Mr Fewkes”) was the Executive Vice President, Asia Region for CBAS from September 2015 to March 2021.4Foot Note 4×Graham Fewkes’ AEIC (“GFA”) at para 1.Mr Low Chong Lim (“Mr Low”) was a director of CSAPL between March 2015 and October 2018. Mr Low also oversaw the human resources matters for CBAS in Asia.5Foot Note 5×Low Chong Lim’s AEIC (“LCLA”) at para 1.The other two witnesses were Mr Troels Libak Stollberg (“Mr Stollberg”)6Foot Note 6×TLSA at p 1.and Mr Peter Steenberg (“Mr Steenberg”),7Foot Note 7×Peter Steenberg’s AEIC (“PSA”) at para 1.who are CBAS nominated directors of CSAPL. 6 Mr Jagetia is a director of CSAPL, nominated by CSAPLH. From 26 September 2014 to March 2018, he was the Deputy Managing Director (“DMD”) of CIPL under an employment contract which I shall refer to as the “CIPL DMD Contract”.8Foot Note 8×Agreed Bundle of Documents (“AB”) Vol 5 (“5AB”) at pp 2008–2017.Thereafter, he moved to be CSAPL’s SVP. 7 Apart from himself, the defendant called one other witness, Mr Yeo Soon Keong (“Mr Yeo”). Mr Yeo is a director of CSAPL, nominated by CSAPLH. At the relevant time, he was also a member of its Remuneration Committee.9Foot Note 9×YSKA at para 1.",
        "The employment contract with CSAPL": "8 Mr Fewkes, Mr Low and Mr Jagetia were actively involved in the negotiations for the CSAPL SVP Contract, while Mr Yeo had knowledge of the discussions during the process. The CSAPL SVP Contract, signed by Mr Jagetia on 19 April 2018, lies at the heart of this dispute, and I now set out the material clauses.10Foot Note 10×5AB at pp 2258–2264. 9 Pursuant to cl 1.2, the CSAPL SVP Contract “supersedes” the CIPL DMD Contract. Although the CSAPL SVP Contract is dated 14 March 2018, it commences on 1 April 2018 while Mr Jagetia’s length of employment is backdated to 26 September 2014 (ie, the date of the CIPL DMD Contract) as follows: 1.1 The employment contract will commence as of1 April 2018conditional to obtaining the relevant Singapore visa/work-permits. 1.2  This contract supersedes the current employment contract dated 24 September 2014 [sic]11Foot Note 11×This appears to be a typographical mistake within the CSAPL SVP Contract.and any addendum employment agreements signed between [Mr Jagetia] and [CIPL]. In the event of any inconsistency between this contract and previous employment contract or other documents, this contract will prevail. 1.3  [Mr Jagetia]’s length of employment will count from26 September 2014. [emphasis in original] 10 Under cl 2.2, Mr Jagetia was to report directly to the board of CSAPL with “daily oversightby Executive Vice President, Asia” [emphasis in original]. As mentioned at [5], at the material time, the position was held by Mr Fewkes. 11 Under cl 5.1, Mr Jagetia was to “devote most of his working capacity to the employment with [CSAPL] and can use some of his time to support the activities of [CSAPLH]”. 12 The CSAPL SVP Contract also addresses Mr Jagetia’s move from India to Singapore with his family. That said, it is common ground between parties that the contract stops short of expressly requiring Mr Jagetia and his family to move to Singapore: 1 COMMENCEMENT … 1.4 This contract shall come into force subject to [Mr Jagetia] being granted residence and work permit in Singapore. [CSAPL] is responsible for assisting [Mr Jagetia] and accompanying family, if any, in obtaining proper documentation (passport, visa, work permit, residence permit etc.) prior to the start of this role. For reasons beyond [CSAPL’s], [Mr Jagetia’s] and his family's control to secure work and residency permit in Singapore, [CSAPL] shall provide alternative employment arrangements which will allow the employee to perform same duties and receive similar remuneration under this contract. … 4 PLACE OF WORK 4.1 The position will be based at a designated Service Office and/or home office in Singapore. 4.2 Travel activities within the country and abroad must be expected to a certain extent for periods of time, as must temporary stays abroad in connection with work related to the role. 13 Clauses 6.5, 6.6 and 6.9 provide for the related expenses of relocation (the “Relocation Allowance”), repatriation (the “Repatriation Allowance”), telecommunication and tax as follows: 6 COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS … 6.5 Upon relocation to Singapore, aRelocation Allowance of Gross SGD 5,000will be paid with the first available payroll. At the end of this Contract, a repatriation allowance equalling to Gross SGD 5,000 is paid to [Mr Jagetia] together with the last salary payout. 6.6 Expenses for installation of telephone in the accommodation in Singapore will be reimbursed. … 6.9 [Mr Jagetia] is entitled to tax consultancy and assistance for the filing of Personal Income taxes in Singapore from income derived from this Employment Contract. [emphasis in original] 14 The remaining sub-clauses of cl 6 set out Mr Jagetia’s compensation and benefits, including his gross annual base salary (the “Gross Annual Base Salary”) and gross annual benefits package (the “Annual Benefits Package”): 6.1 TheGross Annual Base Salary is Singapore Dollars (“SGD”) 410,000 per annumpayable in 12 equal instalments at the end of each month. Mandatory labour law requirements in Singapore may prescribe a different pattern of payment, which is respected by this contract. 6.2 The Gross Base Salary shall be reviewed once a year leading to a revised “Compensation” compromising [sic] of Gross Base Salary and its corresponding Short-Term Incentive (“STI”) target. The revised Compensation will be effective retroactively as of 1 January in the said year. The first review takes place inApril 2019. 6.3 The Employee shall receive aGross Annual Benefits Package of SGD 290,000 per annumpayable on payable on [sic] 1st April 2018. This annual Gross Benefits Package covers housing, children's education, pension, life & accident/disability insurance, transport allowances, home leave travel and miscellaneous benefits. 6.4 The Company shall provide [Mr Jagetia] and his legal dependents with an international health care plan to cover outpatient medical treatment, appropriate accidental and death insurance and inpatient hospitalization. [emphasis in original] 15 In relation to the short-term incentive (“STI”) mentioned in cl 6.2, cl 7 provides very broadly as follows: 7 INCENTIVES 7.1 [Mr Jagetia] will participate in the Short-Term Incentive Plan (STI Plan) with a target bonus of40%of the Gross Annual Base Salary. STI mechanics and calculations will be discussed each year with the Board of CSAPL with oversight by EVP, Asia. For base assumption, the STI structure will reflect financial performance of [CIPL] and [GBPL] and CSAPL priorities in equal proportions. 7.2 The Actual STI payment (if any) will be paid out once a year – typically in April. … [emphasis in original] 16 This brings me to cl 11, the last clause I wish to highlight, which provides that the contract may be terminated by either Mr Jagetia or CSAPL as follows:12Foot Note 12×5AB at p 2261. 11 DURATION AND TERMINATION 11.1 The Employment period is ongoing and shall be terminated with notice from either [Mr Jagetia] or [CSAPL] as per the notice period served. … 11.4 [CSAPL] may at any time terminate this contract in accordance with applicable law in Singapore. If no other legal regulations prevail, the notice period is three months starting from the last working day of the month such notice is given. All expenses in connection with return journey and transport of [Mr Jagetia’s] belongings etc. will be paid by [CSAPL] 11.5 In case of breach of this contract - including gross non-fulfilment of duties – [CSAPL] reserves the right to dismiss [Mr Jagetia]. In the event of dismissal this shall also be regarded termination/dismissal of any employment with [CSAPL] or other Carlsberg associated company. All expenses in connection with return journey and transport of [Mr Jagetia’s] belongings are to be borne by [Mr Jagetia]. 17 I pause to highlight that arising from the contractual provisions set out at [12] and [13], CSAPL contends that there is an implied term under the CSAPL SVP Contract for Mr Jagetia to relocate with his family to Singapore (the “Relocation Obligation”). Mr Jagetia contends, however, that he was merely given the option to relocate with his family to Singapore. As it transpired, Mr Jagetia’s family did not relocate to Singapore. As to whether Mr Jagetia could be said to have relocated to Singapore, parties differ.",
        "Management issues": "18 During Mr Jagetia’s employment, four issues were brewing in respect of the management of CSAPL. Operating in the background seems to be a disagreement between the two shareholders, CBAS and CSAPLH. Indeed, on most of the resolutions in relation to these matters, the CBAS nominated directors and the CSAPLH nominated directors appear to have taken opposite sides. I summarise the parties’ perspectives on these issues. The financing efforts 19 The first, and probably most significant of the four issues, concerns the refinancing of a loan facility granted by CBAS to CSAPL (the “CBAS Loan Facility”).13Foot Note 13×5AB at pp 2025–2124. 20 As set out in the CSAPL SVP Contract, one of Mr Jagetia’s responsibilities was to “lead … financial management” so as to “lower financial cost … within CSAPL”.14Foot Note 14×5AB at p 2264.According to Mr Jagetia, he had attempted to reduce CSAPL’s interest expenses arising from the CBAS Loan Facility by refinancing it. In that regard, Mr Jagetia attempted to obtain a loan from third-party banks at more competitive interest rates (the “Financing Efforts”).15Foot Note 15×PKJA at para 17(b).In particular, Mr Jagetia’s position is that he secured an offer from Rabobank for a US$350m loan facility (the “Rabobank Loan Facility”) in which CSAPL “stood to save up to US$123,000 per week or US$6,388,000 per annum in interest costs” compared to the CBAS Loan Facility.16Foot Note 16×PKJA at paras 41–42.However, Mr Jagetia was of the view that he was “met with blocking and delaying tactics” from CBAS nominated directors because CBAS “would lose the windfall it had been earning”.17Foot Note 17×PKJA at para 43. 21 According to CSAPL, the issue of refinancing was an important one. More information would have been needed on the financing options, and the board would only have acted after a review of all the relevant information and an analysis of the same. At a series of board meetings from 30 January 2019 to 4 June 2019, the Rabobank Loan Facility was discussed. Various members of the board had reservations about the key terms of the Rabobank Loan Facility, including the financial covenants and repayment schedule, and they wanted an understanding of CSAPL’s financial position. Mr Jagetia failed to address the concerns of the board which, as SVP of CSAPL, was for him to do. Mr Jagetia was not blocked in the Financing Efforts.18Foot Note 18×TLSA at paras 40–43. The whistleblowing efforts 22 Next, according to Mr Jagetia, sometime in 2017, when he was DMD of CIPL, he had discovered trade practices which were allegedly “improper” within CIPL. Although he attempted to investigate the matter while he was CSAPL SVP, the directors nominated by CBAS prevented him from doing so.19Foot Note 19×PKJA at para 11.Specifically, Mr Jagetia raised concerns of “illegal trade practices and anti-competitive behaviour” to the CIPL Audit Committee (the “Whistle-Blowing Efforts”).20Foot Note 20×PKJA at para 17(a).However, Mr Fewkes and the CBAS nominated directors considered the Whistle-Blowing Efforts to be detrimental to CBAS and did not want any publicity or investigation in relation to the matters.21Foot Note 21×PKJA at para 18. 23 CSAPL contends that these matters are irrelevant to the contractual dispute at hand. In particular, Mr Stollberg highlights that Mr Jagetia “never brought it to [CSAPL’s] attention at the time when the matter surfaced in CIPL” but had instead “considered the whistle-blowing issues … a matter for CIPL to deal with”. According to Mr Stollberg, the issue of illegal trade practices was first brought to the attention of the CSAPL’s board of directors only on 23 June 2019.22Foot Note 22×TLSA at paras 175–176.However, CSAPL did not hamper Mr Jagetia’s efforts in relation to the matters. The initial public offering efforts 24 Another of Mr Jagetia’s responsibilities was to “actively drive the IPO in close cooperation with Carlsberg representatives”.23Foot Note 23×5 AB at p 2264 (Appendix to the CSAPL SVP Contract).Mr Jagetia is of the view that CBAS nominated directors had been “obstructing [his] efforts” to “work towards” the initial public offering of CIPL and GBPL (the “IPO Efforts”).24Foot Note 24×PKJA at para 67.Again, CSAPL disputes Mr Jagetia’s narrative of the events.25Foot Note 25×TLSA at para 248; PSA at paras 45–48.CSAPL highlights that at a board meeting on 23 October 2018, the CBAS nominated directors decided that they could not approve a mandate to proceed without “a complete understanding of the pros and cons for CSAPL of the IPO and restructuring” as they needed “an aligned input from the IPO Committee”.26Foot Note 26×4AB at p 1579. The planning efforts 25 Lastly, Mr Jagetia is of the view that the CBAS nominated directors “frustrated” his attempts to participate in the business planning of CSAPL’s subsidiaries (the “Planning Efforts”).27Foot Note 27×PKJA at paras 17(d) and 74.For instance, they did not support Mr Jagetia’s efforts to get the management of CIPL and GBPL to engage him to manage short term and long range business such that he would be privy to the communications with the subsidiaries.28Foot Note 28×4AB at pp 1693–1694.Also, they did not advise the Carlsberg Group and CSAPLH employees to (a) work with Mr Jagetia and (b) not communicate directly with CIPL and GBPL in relation to areas for which Mr Jagetia was responsible.29Foot Note 29×PKJA at para 74(b)(2); 4AB at pp 1694–1695 (CSAPL’s Board Meeting Minutes of 9 April 2019 at point 10). 26 Again, CSAPL disagrees with Mr Jagetia’s narrative. When Mr Jagetia brought up the issues at a board meeting, Mr Steenberg mentioned that there is no mention in the CSAPL SVP Contract or the CSAPL’s shareholders agreement that all information “needs to go through [the] SVP”. In any case, it would be “entirely unpractical as it will create an unnecessary bottle neck to make one person the sole contact for all information”. As a multinational corporation, “nowhere in the company is there one person that all communications go through”.30Foot Note 30×4AB at p 1693–1694 (CSAPL’s Board Meeting Minutes of 9 April 2019 at point 9).",
        "Remuneration issues": "27 Apart from the management issues, disagreements soon emerged with respect to Mr Jagetia’s remuneration. 28 In relation to the STI for 2018, there are two disputes. For context, it is not seriously disputed that the STI from January 2018 to March 2018 while Mr Jagetia was DMD of CIPL (the “CIPL STI”) is still due to him. The first dispute is over which entity is liable to make the payment (whether CSAPL or otherwise). Mr Jagetia takes the view that CSAPL should pay him S$114,800 for the CIPL STI.31Foot Note 31×PKJA at para 14(v).Second, the parties disagree on the computation of the STI from April 2018 onwards (the “CSAPL 2018 STI”). While CSAPL approved a sum of S$135,500 for the CSAPL 2018 STI, Mr Jagetia claims that it should have been S$192,363.80. 29 As reproduced above at [14], cl 6.2 of the CSAPL SVP Contract provides that Mr Jagetia’s Gross Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed “once a year”, for which the first review was to take place in April 2019. Mr Jagetia’s view is that he should have received a salary increment similar to that enjoyed by the senior management in CIPL and GBPL (ie, about 5%). However, CSAPL disagrees, and Mr Jagetia received no such increment.",
        "Mr Jagetia’s termination": "30 By June 2019, things had come to a head. At a board meeting on 26 June 2019, Mr Stollberg highlighted the following matters which purportedly supported an “immediate termination” of Mr Jagetia’s employment under cl 11.5 of the CSAPL SVP Contract, as reproduced at [16] above:32Foot Note 32×TLSA at para 85; AB Vol 4 at pp 1776–1779 (CSAPL’s Board Meeting Minutes of 26 June 2019 at point 6). (a) failure and refusal to answer direct questions posed to him by the CSAPL board in breach of cl 2.2 of the CSAPL SVP Contract (see [10] above) especially in respect of the Financing Efforts;(b) failure to relocate to Singapore even as of 26 June 2019 (ie, the date of termination as decided at that board meeting) with his family in breach of cll 6.1, 6.3, 6.5 and 6.9 of the CSAPL SVP Contract;(c) retention of the Annual Benefits Package paid to him from 1 April 2018 to 30 June 2019 despite not having relocated to Singapore with his family; and(d) failure to devote most of his working capacity to CSAPL in breach of cl 5.1 of the CSAPL SVP Contract (see [10]) by instead devoting most of his time to further the interests of CSAPLH. 31 In contrast, the other CSAPLH nominated director, Mr Yeo, stated that Mr Jagetia should be “given adequate opportunity to respond”. Despite Mr Yeo’s objections, the board nevertheless voted to terminate Mr Jagetia. Mr Fewkes then formally terminated Mr Jagetia’s employment as SVP of CSAPL.33Foot Note 33×TLSA Exhibit TLS-78 at pp 586–587.",
        "The parties’ cases": "",
        "The plaintiff’s claim": "32 Following the termination, CSAPL claims against Mr Jagetia for sums which it had allegedly paid in consideration of the Relocation Obligation. In this regard, the plaintiff pleads that it is an implied term of the CSAPL SVP Contract that Mr Jagetia was obligated to relocate to Singapore with his family.34Foot Note 34×Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) (“SOC”) at para 25. 33 The plaintiff avers that the Annual Benefits Package of S$290,000 per annum under cl 6.3 is attributable to the Relocation Obligation. In this connection, CSAPL has paid Mr Jagetia the sum of S$290,000 for the period from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019, as well as the sum of S$72,500 for the period from 1 April 2019 to 30 June 2019.35Foot Note 35×SOC at paras 22(b), 25(d)(ii) and 32.CSAPL also avers that it paid the Relocation Allowance of S$5,000 under cl 6.5 as a one-off allowance to off-set Mr Jagetia’s costs of relocating himself and his family to Singapore.36Foot Note 36×SOC at para 33. 34 CSAPL claims damages from Mr Jagetia arising from his breach of the Relocation Obligation by failing to relocate himself and his family to Singapore. Alternatively, Mr Jagetia has been unjustly enriched as a result of the failure of the basis for the Annual Benefits Package and the Relocation Allowance. CSAPL is, therefore, entitled to recover the payments.37Foot Note 37×SOC at paras 32–37. 35 Accordingly, CSAPL claims S$232,000 against Mr Jagetia, calculated as follows: ItemAmount / S$Annual Benefits Package (From 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019)290,000Annual Benefits Package (From 1 April 2019 to 30 June 2019)72,500Relocation Allowance5,000Less: CSAPL 2018 STI (withheld from Mr Jagetia)- 135,500Total232,000",
        "The defendant’s defence and counterclaim": "36 Mr Jagetia avers that there is no basis to imply the Relocation Obligation under the CSAPL SVP Contract. There is thus no breach of such term or any unjust enrichment arising from failure of basis. 37 The CSAPL SVP Contract does not provide that CSAPL could vary or stipulate Mr Jagetia’s place of residence.38Foot Note 38×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at para 14.In contrast, under the CIPL DMD Contract, CIPL had the right to vary his “place or work and/or require [him] to serve, visit or reside in such city/town as the scope of the work required or CIPL directed”. Nevertheless, CIPL never exercised such right. Further, CSAPL had no right to “designate where Mr Jagetia’s family resided”.39Foot Note 39×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at para 8(a)–(c). 38 Relatedly, cl 6.3 of the CSAPL SVP Contract does not state that the Annual Benefits Package is conditional upon Mr Jagetia and his family being resident in Singapore.40Foot Note 40×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at para 16.As such, no payments were made in consideration of such Relocation Obligation.41Foot Note 41×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at para 26.The Relocation Allowance was intended to cover the inconvenience of Mr Jagetia changing his place of work. It was to be paid automatically, without showing that he had in fact relocated or incurred any costs in doing so.42Foot Note 42×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at para 27. 39 Further, Mr Jagetia pleads that he was being punished by the CBAS nominated directors for the Financing Efforts, Whistle-Blowing Efforts, IPO Efforts and Planning Efforts (the “Collateral Purposes”). Therefore, CSAPL wrongfully denied Mr Jagetia the full entitlement to his CSAPL 2018 STI.43Foot Note 43×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at para 80(b).In particular, Mr Jagetia avers that CSAPL breached the implied term of mutual trust and confidence in the CSAPL SVP Contract by failing to “exercise its discretion as to the STI in a rational and non-capricious manner” and depriving him of the opportunity to earn his STI. CSAPL is “bound to” compensate him $192,363.80 for the CSAPL 2018 STI.44Foot Note 44×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at para 81. 40 CSAPL also failed to pay other contractual entitlements to Mr Jagetia, including the remainder of the Annual Benefits Package for 1 July 2019 to 31 March 2020 under cl 6.3 (see [14] and [30(c)] above), the CIPL STI (see [27] above), and the Repatriation Allowance under cl 6.5 (see [13] above).45Foot Note 45×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at para 87.Specifically, Mr Jagetia avers that cll 7.1, 1.2 and 1.3 of the CSAPL SVP Contract contractually entitle him to claim his CIPL STI from January to March 2018 from CSAPL.46Foot Note 46×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at para 82. 41 In relation to the termination, Mr Jagetia pleads that it is “wrongful and without adequate cause”.47Foot Note 47×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at para 29.In Mr Jagetia’s earlier version of his Counterclaim, he pleaded that CSAPL wrongfully dismissed him “in order to” stop and “punish” him for the Financing Efforts, Whistle Blowing Efforts, IPO Efforts and Planning Efforts.48Foot Note 48×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) at para 66 and para 87.In the second round of amendments to the Defence and Counterclaim, Mr Jagetia instead included his claim for three months’ salary in lieu of notice on the basis of CSAPL’s contractual obligation under cl 11.4 of the CSAPL SVP Contract.49Foot Note 49×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at para 87. 42 Accordingly, Mr Jagetia claims S$632,163.80 against CSAPL as follows:50Foot Note 50×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at paras 81, 83 and 87. Item/ CSAPL SVP Contract ReferenceAmount / S$Remainder of the Annual Benefits Package under cl 6.3 (From 1 July 2019 to 31 March 2020)217,500Repatriation Allowance under cl 6.55,000Salary In Lieu of Notice under cl 11.4102,500CIPL STI (From 1 January to 31 March 2018)114,800CSAPL 2018 STI (From 1 April to 31 December 2018)192,363.80Total632,163.80 43 I note that Mr Jagetia pleads that CSAPL is “bound to provide an annual increment for 2019 of 5% on gross annual base salary and gross annual benefits package”.51Foot Note 51×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) at para 86.The computation above does not account for such increment. In his closing submissions, Mr Jagetia instead claims for a “4% increment on the Gross Annual Base Salary in the sum of $8,200” and a “4% increment on the [Annual Benefits Package] in the sum of $14,500” making the total value of the claim S$654,863.80.",
        "Issues to be determined": "44 From the foregoing, the issues to be determined are: (a) whether the Relocation Obligation is to be implied,ie,whether there is an implied term requiring Mr Jagetia to relocate with his family to Singapore; (i) if so, whether CSAPL is entitled to recover S$367,500 (for the Annual Benefits Package from 1 April 2018 to 30 June 2019 plus the Relocation Allowance) in damages for breach of such an implied term or, in the alternative, for unjust enrichment owing from a total failure of consideration; (ii) if not, whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to claim S$222,500 for the Annual Benefits Package from 1 July 2019 to 31 March 2020 plus the Repatriation Allowance; (b) whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to S$192,363.80 as his CSAPL 2018 STI Claim (ie, from April to December 2018) instead of S$135,500;(c) whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to claim S$114,800 from CSAPL instead of CIPL for the CIPL STI (ie, from January to March 2018);(d) whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to an annual increment of 4% of his Gross Annual Base Salary and Annual Benefits Package from January to June 2019 and July 2019 to March 2020 totalling S$22,700; and(e) whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to three months’ salary in lieu of notice pursuant to cl 11.4 of the CSAPL SVP Contract. 45 I consider each issue in turn.",
        "Whether Mr Jagetia breached an implied Relocation Obligation or was otherwise unjustly enriched": "",
        "The applicable legal principles": "123 Given the dearth of local authorities on claims in employment law for increments, I turn to consider the English authorities which Mr Jagetia relies on and CSAPL does not refute. 124 InClark v BETplc and another[1997] IRLR 348 (at 349), the employment contract provided that the employee’s salary “shall be reviewed annually and be increased by such amount if any as the board shall in its absolute discretion decide”. Such a clause was held to mean that there is “an obligation to review the salary every year”. Furthermore, despite the purported “absolute discretion”, “if the board had capriciously or in bad faith exercised its discretion so as to determine the increase at nil and therefore to pay [the employee] no increase at all, that would have been a breach of contract”. As such, the court went on to hold that the question to be answered on the facts is “what position [the employee] would have been in had [the employer] performed this obligation”. 125 In undertaking such inquiry, the increment offered to other employees in a similar position (if any) is a relevant consideration. In that regard, it was held inTransco plc v O’Brien[2002] ICR 721 (“Transco”) that to “single out an employee on capricious grounds and refuse to offer him the same terms as were offered to the rest of the workforce is … a breach of the implied term of trust and confidence”. This is because a “capricious refusal … to offer the same terms to a single employee” is likely to cause serious damage to the relationship of trust between an employer and employee (at [17]). I caveat, however, thatTranscoconcerned a large workforce consisting of 75 workers whereas the present case concerns mainly two other persons – the CIPL MD and GBPL MD. 126 What is clear from the foregoing cases is that an employee has no automatic right to an increment. Rather, the rights and obligations of parties concerning increments ultimately depend on the employment contract in question. As such, whether an employee iscontractually entitledto an increment depends on a proper interpretation the clauses in the employment contract between the parties, bearing in mind theZurich Insuranceprinciples. Where an employment contract provides for a discretionary increment, such discretion must be exercised inbona fide,rationally, and not arbitrarily or capriciously. These principles are consistent with the English cases above and draw upon the principles relating to bonuses (as mentioned at [85]). 127 I should add that byTransco,the proposition relating to the fetters on discretion in relation to awarding increments appears to hinge on the implied term of mutual trust and confidence in the employment context. I am mindful that the Appellate Division of the High Court inDong Wei(at [70]–[93]), when discussing the issue of limits to the contractual right to terminate without cause, casted some doubt on the existence of an implied term of mutual trust and confidence in the employment context (albeit only asobiterdictum). However, at [91], the Appellate Division of the High Court also acknowledged that in relation to “contractual discretions” which relate to rights subsisting within the contracts (eg,discretionary bonusesinLeiman), there may be “restrictions … to ensure that a party’s contractual discretion [is] not exercised in a manner which deprived its counterparty of its contractual rights, or which warped their contractual bargain”. Thus, I proceed on the position set out at [126] above.",
        "The parties’ positions": "136 CSAPL’s position is that it was entitled to terminate Mr Jagetia’s employment under cl 11.5 of the CSAPL SVP Contract.124Foot Note 124×PWS at para 171.CSAPL argues that given the phrasing of cl 11.5 (ie, “[i]n case of breach of this contract”), “any breachof the [CSAPL SVP Contract]” [emphasis in original] is “sufficient to entitle [CSAPL] to exercise its right of termination”. 137 According to CSAPL, Mr Jagetia’s “various breaches” which entitled it to terminate the CSAPL SVP Contract are as follows: (a) breach of the Relocation Obligation; (b) breach of cl 2.2 of the CSAPL SVP Contract by refusing to report to CSAPL’s board on all matters concerning the Rabobank Loan Facility, including lying about the same as Mr Stollberg alleges; (c) breach of cl 2.2 of the CSAPL SVP Contract by blatantly disregarding the board’s instructions; and (d) breach of cl 5.1 by spending more than some of his working time to further the interest of CSAPLH, based on his work calendar.125Foot Note 125×PWS at paras 172–180, 78–95, 25–35, and 32–34; TLSA Exhibit TLS-120 at pp 1723–1789. 138 Mr Jagetia’s position is that CSAPL is not entitled to rely on cl 11.5 to dismiss him. Clause 11.5 must be interpreted to apply to repudiatory breach only.126Foot Note 126×PWS at paras 171–172.In any event, Mr Jagetia denies the alleged breaches. As such, in lieu of three months’ notice, he is entitled to three months’ salary under cl 11.4.127Foot Note 127×DWS at para 124.",
        "Findings": "139 The crux of the issue is thus whether CSAPL is entitled to rely on cl 11.5 to terminate Mr Jagetia for breach of the CSAPL SVP Contract. The factual circumstances surrounding Mr Jagetia’s termination have been set out earlier and will not be repeated here. However, it is worth mentioning at the outset that Mr Jagetia’s position that he was being punished for the Collateral Purposes is not determinative of the issue. 140 I am wholly unconvinced by CSAPL’s submission that cl 11.5 of the CSAPL SVP Contract entitles it to terminate the same on any breach. While the phrase “including gross non-fulfilment of duties” may suggest that it is “not limited togross non-fulfilment of duties” [emphasis in original] as CSAPL contends, such a phrase clearly does not go so far as to suggest that any breach would entitle CSAPL to terminate the CSAPL SVP Contract under cl 11.5. 141 On the contrary, it is trite that not every breach of contract entitles the innocent party to terminate the contract. Even where a term in the contract expressly provides that “any breach” would entitle a party to terminate the contract at hand, such a phrase has been interpreted to mean “any repudiatory breach” where the contract concerns a “myriad of obligations of differing importance and varying frequency” (Rice v Great Yarmouth Borough Council[2000] All ER (D) 902 at [18] and [24];Dominion Corporate Trustees Ltd and others v Debenhams Properties Ltd[2010] EWHC 1193 at [25] and [32]). This is because to read “any breach” literally flies in the face of commercial and business common sense. 142 InRDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltdand another appeal[2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 (“RDC Concrete”), the Court of Appeal set out four situations which would amount to a repudiatory breach: (a) Situation 1: where the contract clearly and unambiguously states that in the event of a certain event or events occurring, the innocent party will be entitled to terminate the contract (at [91]);(b) Situation 2: where a party, by his words or conduct, simply renounces his contract inasmuch as he clearly conveys to the other party to the contract that he will not perform his contractual obligations at all (at [93]);(c) Situation 3(a): the condition/warranty approach where the focus is on the nature of the term breached and, in particular, whether the intention of the parties to the contract was to designate that term as one that is so important that any breach, regardless of the actual consequences of such a breach, would entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract (at [97]); and(d) Situation 3(b): where the focus is on the nature and consequences of the breach, in particular, where the breach in question will give rise to an event which will deprive the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract (at [99]). 143 Turning to the four alleged breaches now relied on by CSAPL, I agree with Mr Jagetia’s position that only the justification put forth by CSAPL at the material time would be relevant to the inquiry of whether CSAPL was entitled to so terminate him under cl 11.5. Lying and subordination were not among the reasons that the CSAPL board had actually put forth at the board meeting on 26 June 2019 (see [30] above). It would be incorrect to consider these belated grounds that surfaced after the CSAPL board had already come to its decision, because they could not possibly have been part of the actual reasons for which CSAPL terminated Mr Jagetia’s employment. 144 I turn to the four grounds which were raised in the board meeting on 26 June 2019, upon which the CSAPL board resolved to terminate Mr Jagetia’s employment as SVP (see [30] above). In this regard, I have already found that there is no Relocation Obligation under the CSAPL SVP Contract and that the purpose of the Annual Benefits Package is not remuneration for the fulfilment of any Relocation Obligation. This deals with two of the grounds. I turn now to deal with the two remaining grounds (which are also allegations CSAPL now relies on). First, that Mr Jagetia breached cl 2.2 by refusing to answer the CSAPL board. Second, that Mr Jagetia failed to devote most of his working capacity to CSAPL in breach of cl 5.1. 145 In my judgment, the incidents which the CSAPL board relies on (ie, the discussion over the Rabobank Loan Facility at the board meeting on 7 February 2019 and, allegedly, correspondence over e-mail) do not amount to repudiatory breach within Situations 1–3(b) ofRDC Concrete. In that regard, cl 2.2 provides that Mr Jagetia “will report to theBoard of CSAPLwithdaily oversightby Executive Vice President, Asia” [emphasis in original] (see [10] above). On the evidence before me, it is not the case that Mr Jagetia failed to report to the CSAPL board. Indeed, the minutes of the board meeting on 7 February 2019 state:128Foot Note 128×4AB at p 1636. … Mr Troels Libak Stollberg asked Mr Pawan Jagetia if the latest 2018 CSAPL financial statement including of its subsidiaries have been provided to the banks. Mr Pawan Jagetia said that he would not answer any more questions from the board members, before he had legal advice if he had to answer questions from the Board of every detail on his daily work. Mr Troels Libak Stollberg pointed out that he was not asking for details on the daily work but very specific on which banks Mr Pawan Jagetia has been in contact with regarding the refinancing which material has been shared with these banks. Mr Pawan Jagetia replied that he has already shared with the Board, why RABOBANK was the most attractive bank to consider. Mr Troels Libak Stollberg asked Mr Pawan Jagetia what the urgency is to push for the loan refinancing. Mr Pawan Jagetia commented that we are incurring 100,000 USD extra interest per week under the CBAS loan facility as compared to the more attractive rate from RABOBANK. … Mr Peter Steenberg could not give Mr Pawan Jagetia mandate to continue negotiation with RABOBANK before certain material was presented, discussed and agreed to in the Board. This included the comparison between the current facility and the one currently being proposed by RABOBANK in their draft term sheet … Mr Pawan Jagetia agreed to prepare this material with the help from the external counsel … In conclusion … it was agreed that Mr Pawan Jagetia together with the legal counsel should work on the internal lines preparing the legal and financial material for the Board for the next meeting… 146 From the foregoing, it is plain that Mr Jagetia did not fail to report to the board but rather insisted that he had “already shared with” the board about the Rabobank Loan Facility. Also, Mr Jagetia continued to work with the CSAPL board in respect of the Financing Efforts. After the meeting, Mr Jagetia followed up with external counsel and reported back to the board on the same.129Foot Note 129×PKJA at paras 53–54.In that regard, Mr Jagetia’s response in the midst of the heated exchange, cannot be objectively construed to be a failure to report to the CSAPL board in the totality of the circumstances. As such, Mr Jagetia’s conduct does not fall within Situation 2, Situation 3(a) or Situation 3(b) in theRDC Concreteframework. For completeness, Situation (1) plainly does not apply in the present case since the CSAPL SVP Contract does not clearly and unambiguously stipulate that the innocent party will be entitled to terminate the contract upon a certain event occurring. 147 As regards the alleged breach of cl 5.1, the CSAPL board was of the view that he was “devoting most of his time to further the interests of CSAPLH” such as his involvement in a “potential investment” project as well as “being named as the representative of CSAPLH as the claimant in the ongoing SIAC arbitration commenced by CSAPLH against [CBAS]”.130Foot Note 130×4AB at p 1777.In my judgment, such an assessment is not borne out by the objective contemporary evidence before me. The CBAS nominated directors were aware of Mr Jagetia’s role in the potential investment project as early as September 2018, but did not raise an issue with the amount of time Mr Jagetia was spending on such project at that material time.131Foot Note 131×PKJA Exhibit PKJ-145 at p 1450.Furthermore, by the time Mr Jagetia received feedback from the board on his SVP performance on 6 May 2019, the board would have been well aware of both the arbitration proceedings. Nevertheless, the feedback did not mention that the board considered Mr Jagetia’s conduct to be in breach of cl 5.1. 148 Accordingly, CSAPL is not entitled to rely on cl 11.5 to terminate Mr Jagetia without notice. In this regard, Mr Stollberg agreed that if there were no grounds to terminate Mr Jagetia under cl 11.5, he should have been served with three months’ notice under cl 11.4.132Foot Note 132×Transcript dated 13 September 2021 at p 151, line 8.In lieu of such notice, Mr Jagetia is entitled to three months’ salary.",
        "Whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to the Repatriation Allowance": "79 I now turn to Mr Jagetia’s counterclaims. Mr Jagetia submits that if there is no Relocation Obligation, then CSAPL’s claim on the Relocation Allowance should be dismissed while his counterclaim on the Repatriation Allowance should be allowed without more.81Foot Note 81×DWS at para 42.CSAPL submits that the Repatriation Allowance under cl 6.5 of the CSAPL SVP Contract does not apply in the present circumstances as Mr Jagetia’s employment was terminated. Under cl 11.5, all “expenses in connection with return journey and transport of the Employee’s belongings are to be borne by the Employee”.82Foot Note 82×PWS at para 187.In response, Mr Jagetia submits that CSAPL’s argument is neither pleaded nor applicable on the facts since CSAPL was not entitled to terminate him under cl 11.5. For the reasons which I shall elaborate below, I agree with Mr Jagetia that CSAPL was not entitled to terminate him under cl 11.5 of the CSAPL SVP Contract. As the flip side to the Relocation Allowance, I am also satisfied that Mr Jagetia is likewise entitled to the Repatriation Allowance under cl 6.5 at the end of the CSAPL SVP Contract.",
        "Whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to the Annual Benefits Package from 1 July 2019 to 31 March 2020": "80 Mr Jagetia submits that the Annual Benefits Package is “payable in full on 1st April every year” having regard to cl 6.3 of the CSAPL SVP Contract and not every quarter of the year.83Foot Note 83×DWS at paras 35–40.CSAPL submits that the logical conclusion of such a position is that even if Mr Jagetia had resigned on 2 April, he would be able to retain the full amount which “cannot be right” and is “legally unsustainable”.84Foot Note 84×PWS at paras 188–189.In response, Mr Jagetia submits that there is no “clawback” for the Annual Benefits Package which could possibly apply. As such, he is entitled to the full sum on 1 April every year.85Foot Note 85×DRS at para 71. 81 While it is not disputed that cl 6.3 stipulates the mechanics for the payment of the Annual Benefits Package (ie, promptly on 1 April as a one-time lump payment for the year), such mechanism does not and cannot in any way lead to the conclusion that Mr Jagetia is entitled to the full sum of the Annual Benefits Package for as long as the contract ends after 1 April of the year. On the contrary, cl 6.5 clearly stipulates that the figure of S$290,000 is “per annum” and as such appropriately called theAnnualBenefits Package. Furthermore, Mr Jagetia’s position on this part of his Counterclaim is contradicted by his own position (which I have found earlier) that his remuneration package is to be considered as a wholeso as to justifiably peg it to the “10% delta difference” compared to the CIPL MD. Such remuneration package is clearly in respect of Mr Jagetia’s annual remuneration. 82 Furthermore, even if CSAPL’s failure to pay the full sum of the Annual Benefits Package on 1 April constitutes a breach of cl 6.5, in the present circumstances, I am not satisfied that Mr Jagetia has shown any loss for the period from 1 July 2019 to 31 March 2020. In that regard, I also rely on my decision to allow Mr Jagetia’s three months’ salary in lieu of notice (see [148] below). Accordingly, I dismiss Mr Jagetia’s counterclaim for the remainder of the Annual Benefits Package.",
        "The quantum of the CSAPL 2018 STI": "83 Turning to the CSAPL 2018 STI Claim, parties disagree on the quantum payable to Mr Jagetia. In this connection, cl 7.1 of the CSAPL SVP Contract only provides for a “a target bonus of 40% of the Gross Annual Base Salary”. As for “mechanics and calculations”, the contract leaves it open for yearly discussion with the board, with oversight by Mr Fewkes. Nonetheless, cl 7.1 provides that as a “base assumption”, “the STI structure will reflect financial performance of [CIPL] and [GBPL] and CSAPL priorities in equal proportions”.",

        "Whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to an annual increment": "",
        "Whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to salary in lieu of notice": "",
        "Conclusion": "149 By the above, I dismiss CSAPL’s claim against Mr Jagetia in its entirety. 150 I allow Mr Jagetia’s counterclaim in part, as follows: (a) S$5,000 in respect of the Repatriation Allowance;(b) S$171,864.21 in respect of the 2018 CSAPL STI;(c) S$114,800 for the CIPL STI; and(d) S$102,500 in lieu of three months’ notice. I dismiss Mr Jagetia’s counterclaim for the remainder of the Annual Benefits Package and the annual increments. 151 On the sums awarded, I also award interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of counterclaim to date of judgment.
