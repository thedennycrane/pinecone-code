The matter was only of interest to the plaintiffs and the\n\ndefendants, not the general public. Further, it would be straining the language of s 37(a)\n\nof the Copyright Act to say that the incidents of confusion alleged by the defendants\n\ncould qualify as current events. As the Work is not a literary but an artistic work, the\n\ndefence of fair dealing was not available to the defendants (see  34 to 36).(4)    Having considered\n\nthe conduct of the defendants, the court held that they had not established the second\n\ndefence either (see  37).(5)    As no defence or any\n\ntriable issue was raised against the plaintiff’s claim, the court granted the\n\napplication to restrain the defendants from repeating the mischief committed by their\n\nadvertisements/notices (see  38).",

        "Legislation referred to": "Copyright Act (Cap 63), ss 7, 26, 31 &\n\n37Trade Marks Act (Cap 332), s 27[Editorial note: The defendants' appeal in\n\nCA 43 of 2002 is pending]JudgmentGROUNDS OF DECISIONThe facts1.        Fragrance Foodstuffs Pte\n\nLtd (the plaintiffs) were incorporated on 12 April 1990 Singapore and since that date have\n\nbeen (and even prior thereto under its predecessors in title) in the business of\n\nmanufacturing and selling food items such as titbits, fried cuttlefish, mooncakes and,\n\nbarbecued pork/meat more commonly known by its Hokkien description \"bakwa\".2.        Bee Cheng Hiang Hup Chong\n\nFoodstuff Pte Ltd (the defendants) are in a similar business of manufacturing and selling\n\nbarbecued meats as well as related products such as pork floss and fish floss. However,\n\nthey/their predecessors have been in the business considerably longer than the defendants,\n\nnamely from about the 1930s and, unlike the plaintiffs, the defendants do not sell\n\ncrocodile \"bakwa\". The defendants have more outlets (about 22) than the\n\nplaintiffs (16-17) and target a slightly different market from the latter. According to\n\nthe plaintiffs, the defendants have a more upmarket customer base, as their outlets are\n\nlocated in shopping centres whereas the plaintiffs' outlets are situated in public housing\n\n(HDB) estates.3.        Sometime in October 1994,\n\nthe plaintiffs commissioned (and paid) a Singapore citizen and designer, one Chionh Cher\n\nTin (Chionh) to create a logo for their business, on the understanding that the copyright\n\nfor the same would belong to the plaintiffs. Chionh created a logo (the Work) which\n\ncomprised of the English word \"Fragrance\" with its Mandarin equivalent \"\n\n\" (pronounced \"Xiang\") and a stylised representation of the tongue coming\n\nout of the mouth and licking lips, as reproduced below:According to the plaintiffs, the tongue licking the lips was meant to\n\nemphasise the quality and tastiness of the plaintiffs' products. The Work was first\n\npublished in Singapore in or about January 1995. The plaintiffs gradually used the Work on\n\nall their products, signage, packing, advertisements and other promotional materials. In\n\nJuly 1995, they applied to and did register, a mark comprising the Work in class 30 for\n\nbiscuits, cakes, pastry and confectionery under T95/06325E which registration is still\n\nvalid and subsisting. At the same time they also applied to register the Work as a mark in\n\nclass 29 (for dried minced pork, pork floss, chicken floss, snack foods, preserved,\n\njellies, dried and cooked fruits and vegetables).4.        The plaintiffs'\n\napplication under class 29 is still pending due to the defendants' opposition on the\n\nground inter alia, that the Work is identical to or nearly resembles the defendants' logo\n\nwhich (since 1985) is a single calligraphic Mandarin character \"Xiang\" meaning\n\n'fragrant'; the parties are waiting for a hearing date for the opposition proceedings.5.        Ten (10) days before this\n\nyear's Lunar New Year festival, namely on 2 and 3 February 2002, the defendants caused to\n\nbe published in the local English and Chinese newspapers the following half-page\n\nadvertisement:At the same time, the defendants also distributed to the public\n\npamphlets/notices similar to their advertisements; these were handed out at the\n\ndefendants' outlets, to passers-by near the plaintiffs' outlets and were even placed under\n\nthe windshield wipers of parked vehicles.6.        Apparently, the defendants\n\nwere prompted to place the advertisements as a result of two incidents (according to their\n\naffidavits). The first occurred in 1988 when Bloomdale (S) Pte Ltd, a gift/hamper company,\n\nin its Lunar New Year catalogue, mistakenly advertised as part of its hamper offerings,\n\npork/fish floss of the plaintiffs as the defendants' products. The company was required by\n\nthe defendants to tender in a press advertisement an apology for its unfortunate error and\n\nto correct its catalogue.7.        The second incident of\n\nmistaken identity between the parties occurred in the February 2002 issue of the monthly\n\nperiodicalSingapore Women's Weeklywhere (at p 43) headed WATCH there appeared the\n\nfollowing comments against a picture of packaged products:FRAGRANCE YOU'LL LOVEThink bak kwa and pork floss, and Fragrance Foodstuff comes to\n\n    mind. Its bak kwa stays fresh for two weeks without refrigeration, and there's s whole\n\n    range of floss, lup cheong and even crocodile bak kwa that promises to be a tasty snack.\n\n    Get your fill of sweet meats this festive season at one of their 16 outlets. For\n\n    inquiries, call 2984020.There was no confusion in the advertisement itself but, the telephone\n\nnumber stated was the defendants', not the plaintiffs'. This advertisement prompted the\n\ndefendants' solicitors to write to the magazine's publishers who apologised for their\n\nmistake; the publishers claimed it resulted from the fact that the magazine had sent an\n\n'intern' to the press conference organised by the plaintiffs, who subsequently did the\n\nabove write-up. The publishers explained that after the press conference, the intern had\n\nchecked the telephone number of the plaintiffs using the Chinese character\n\n\"Xiang\", not realising that the defendants used the same logo. The intern\n\nassumed (wrongly) that the defendants' telephone number was that of the plaintiffs.8.        It did not help matters\n\nthat on 3 February 2002, a report in the Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao quoted the\n\ndefendants' general manager Daniel Wong (Wong) as saying that the defendants may continue\n\nto publish notices similar to that set out in para 5 above, in order to dispel the\n\npublic's confusion that the plaintiffs and the defendants are one and the same\n\ncompany/management.9.        By an agreement dated 5\n\nFebruary 2002, Chionh formally assigned to the plaintiffs all his rights and interest in\n\nthe Work, including the right to commence action for any infringement of the copyright in\n\nthe Work. On the following day, the plaintiffs' solicitors wrote to the defendants\n\npointing out that the newspaper notices using the Work had been placed without the\n\nplaintiffs' consent and hence constituted an infringement of the plaintiffs' copyright in\n\nthe Work. The solicitors demanded: (i) a written undertaking from the defendants that they\n\nwould not reproduce the Work or deal with it in any form or manner, (ii) costs and (iii)\n\ncompliance with certain other conditions, by 1pm of 7 February 2002.10.        The defendants'\n\nsolicitors replied to the above demands on 7 February requesting more time (until 8\n\nFebruary 2002) in which to render a substantive response. However, this was past the\n\nplaintiffs' solicitors' deadline. Consequently, the plaintiffs issued this writ on 8\n\nFebruary 2002, alleging that the defendants had infringed their copyright in the Work as\n\nwell as, the trademark.The applications11.        At the same time that\n\nthey commenced this action, the plaintiffs applied by way of summons in chambers no. 417\n\nof 2002 for an ex-parte injunction (the injunction application) to inter alia, restrain\n\nthe defendants (whether acting by their directors, officers, servants or agents or any of\n\nthem) until after the trial or until further order, from infringing the plaintiffs'\n\ncopyright in the Work and the trademark. Hearing of the injunction application on 8\n\nFebruary 2002 was postponed to be dealt with inter-partes at a later date, on the\n\ndefendants' voluntary undertaking not to further infringe the copyright in the Work.12.        Shortly after the\n\ndefendants' solicitors had filed a memorandum of appearance and the plaintiffs had filed\n\ntheir statement of claim, the plaintiffs applied by way of summons in chambers no. 626 of\n\n2002 (the O 14 application) for summary judgment on the following prayers:-(i)        the defendants, whether\n\nacting by their directors, officers, servants or agents or any of them or otherwise\n\nhowsoever, be restrained and an injunction be hereby granted restraining them from\n\ninfringing the plaintiffs' copyright in the Work,in particular from\n\nreproducing the Work (or any substantial part thereof) by way of trade, exhibiting and\n\nissuing to the public copies of the Work and authorising the reproduction, exhibition or\n\nissuing to the public copies of the Work without the licence of the plaintiffs;(ii)        there be an inquiry as\n\nto damages or at the plaintiffs' option, an account of profits for infringing the\n\nplaintiffs' copyright in the Work and an order for the payment of all sums found due and\n\nowing upon taking such inquiry or account together with interest thereon at such rate as\n\nthe court deems just;(iii)        costs.13.        Both applications\n\neventually came up for hearing before me on 10 April 2002. I granted the plaintiffs an\n\norder in terms of prayer 1 of the O 14 application for infringing copyright in the Work\n\n(but not for the trademark) and awarded costs (agreed between the parties) of $10,000.\n\nPrayer 1 was subject to the condition that until trial or further order, the plaintiffs\n\nwould not take any further steps or execution proceedings. However, on the injunction\n\napplication, I made no orders on condition the defendants undertook not to repeat their\n\nadvertisements in any shape or form using the plaintiffs' trademark, until trial or\n\nfurther order. I further gave leave to the defendants to file their defence by certain\n\ndeadlines with liberty to the plaintiffs to file their Reply and Defence to the\n\ndefendants' Counterclaim (if there be one). Finally, I ordered early trial dates. The\n\ndefendants have now appealed (in Civil Appeal No. 43 of 2002) against the orders I made in\n\nthe O 14 application.Preliminary issues14.        Before I refer to the\n\naffidavits filed by the parties to support their respective stands, I need to first\n\naddress a preliminary issue which was raised by counsel for the defendants.15.        Counsel pointed out that\n\nthe two (2) applications were inconsistent, the plaintiffs must elect which one they\n\nwished to proceed with. The O 14 application required the plaintiffs to affirm on\n\naffidavit that the defendants have no defence to their claim. At the same time the\n\nplaintiffs were applying to court for an injunction which was premised on there being a\n\nserious issue to be tried. Counsel for the plaintiffs countered that he was not\n\napprobating or reprobating. He submitted on the O 14 application that the defendants had\n\nno defence on the issue of copyright infringement. On the other hand, the injunction\n\napplication related to infringement of trademarks and copyright. Questioned by the court,\n\ncounsel confirmed that the plaintiffs elected to proceed with the injunction application\n\nfor trademark infringement only, while the O 14 application would be for copyright\n\ninfringement.16.        Counsel for the\n\ndefendants attempted (as a second preliminary argument) to persuade the court that the\n\nrequirements under s 27 of the Trade Marks Act Cap 332 had not been satisfied by the\n\nplaintiffs. Consequently, there was no infringement by the defendants. Section 27 reads as\n\nfollows:(1)        A person\n\n  infringes a registered trade mark if, without the consent of the proprietor of the trade\n\n  mark, he uses in the course of trade a sign which is identical with the trade mark in\n\n  relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which it is registered.(2)        A person infringes a\n\n  registered trade mark if, without the consent of the proprietor of the trade mark, he uses\n\n  in the course of trade a sign where because —(a)        the sign is identical\n\n    with the trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services similar to those for\n\n    which the trade mark is registered; or(b)        the sign\n\n    is similar to the trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services identical\n\n    with  or similar to those for which the trade mark is registered,there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of\n\n  the public.(3)        A person infringes a\n\n  registered trade mark which is well known in Singapore if —(a)        without\n\n    the consent of the proprietor of the trade mark, he uses in the course of trade a\n\n    sign  which is identical with or similar to the trade mark, in relation to goods or\n\n    services which are not similar to those for which the trade mark is registered;(b)        the use of the trade mark\n\n    in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or\n\n    services and the proprietor;(c)        there exists a likelihood\n\n    of confusion on the part of the public because of such use; and(d)        the interests of the\n\n    proprietor are likely to be damaged by such use.(4)        For the\n\n  purposes of this section, sections 28 and 29, a person uses a sign if, in particular, he\n\n  —(a)        applies it\n\n    to goods or the packaging thereof;(b)        offers or exposes goods\n\n    for sale, puts them on the market or stocks them for those purposes under the sign,\n\n    or offers or supplies services under the sign;(c)        imports or exports goods\n\n    under the sign;(d)        uses the sign on an\n\n    invoice, wine list, catalogue, business letter, business paper, price list or  \n\n    other commercial document; or(e)        uses the sign in\n\n    advertising.(5)        \n\n  Notwithstanding subsection (4), a person who —(a)        applies a\n\n    sign to any material used or intended to be used for labelling or packaging goods; or(b)        uses it on any document\n\n    described in subsection (4)(d) or in advertising,is deemed not to use the sign if, at the time of such application or\n\n    use, he does not know nor has reason to believe that the proprietor or a licensee of the\n\n    registered trade mark did not consent to such application or use of the sign.(6)        Nothing in\n\n  subsections (1) to (5) shall be construed as preventing the use of a registered trade mark\n\n  by any person for the purpose of identifying goods or services as those of the proprietor\n\n  or licensee, but any such use otherwise than in accordance with honest practices in\n\n  industrial or commercial matters shall be treated as infringing the registered trade mark\n\n  if the use without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the\n\n  distinctive character or repute of the trade mark.17.        The defendants' argument\n\nwas that there had been no 'use' of the trademark as such (under classification 30) since,\n\nthe defendants' advertisement did not refer to any goods let alone cakes, biscuits, pastry\n\nor confectionery. I did not accept this argument. It seems to me that the defendants'\n\nadvertisement and pamphlets clearly made use of the Work within the ambit of s 27(4)(e) of\n\nthe Trade Marks Act; there was no requirement or limitation, that usage must be in\n\naccordance with the trademark's registration under class 30 thereof.The affidavits18.        I shall now touch on the\n\naffidavits filed by the parties. As the affidavits were filed for both applications, I\n\nshall only refer to those portions which are relevant to the O 14 application. The\n\nplaintiffs' managing-director (since April 1990) Tan Tiong Hwa (Tan) who is also a\n\nshareholder, was the deponent for the plaintiffs' affidavits whilst Wong filed affidavits\n\non the defendants' behalf.19.        The contents of Tan's\n\nfirst affidavit have more or less been set out in the above narrative. Tan explained the\n\nreasons for prayer 1 of the O 14 application. Quite apart from the issue of copyright\n\ninfringement (which was clearly in favour of the plaintiffs as they had not consented to\n\nthe defendants' use of the Work), he deposed that damages would be an inadequate remedy\n\nas, the purpose of the defendants' advertisement was not only to promote their products\n\nbut to do so by making unfair use of the Work — the defendants were extolling the\n\nqualities of their products by suggesting that the defendants' goods have been confused\n\nwith those of the plaintiffs. This was supported by the defendants'/Wong's self-serving\n\ncomments to Lianhe Zaobao citing instances of confusion. The effect was that the public\n\nwould think that the plaintiffs were responsible for the confusion and, that the\n\nplaintiffs' products were either inferior to the defendants' or not on par. Such\n\nperception was highly damaging to the plaintiffs and the harm done was not compensatable\n\nin monetary terms.20.        Tan added that the\n\ndefendants' notice/advertisement was designed to achieve the maximum impact and inflict\n\nthe maximum damage on the plaintiffs coming as it did, just ten (10) days before the\n\nChinese New Year on 12 February 2002; during the period, the demand for \"bakwa\"\n\nand other seasonal products was very high. Hence, the defendants' advertisement (with the\n\nhidden agenda set out above) was not only aimed at luring away the plaintiffs' customers\n\nbut was used by the defendants as an opportunity to sully the plaintiffs' goodwill and\n\nreputation.21.        In response, Wong's first\n\naffidavit (filed on 22 February 2002) sought to justify the defendants' advertisements and\n\nusage of the Work by referring to the two incidents set out in paras 6 and 7 above. To\n\nreinforce his allegation of confusion on the part of the public (over the use of the\n\nChinese character \"Xiang\" by the plaintiffs since the introduction of the Work\n\nas their brand in 1995), Wong exhibited (inDW-5) statutory declarations which the\n\ndefendants filed in the opposition proceedings to the plaintiffs' registration of the Work\n\nas a mark under class 29. All sixteen (16) statutory declarations were sworn by\n\nsupervisors or other employees of the defendants' outlets; they alleged that customers had\n\ncome to their outlets stating they thought the plaintiffs' and the defendants' brands were\n\nunder the same company or management. There had even been instances where customers\n\nproduced the plaintiffs' discount card thinking it could be used at the defendants'\n\noutlets. I should add that in the statement he gave to the press on 3 February 2002, Wong\n\nhad also cited two (2) other instances of confusion -- customers brought the plaintiffs'\n\nproducts to the defendants' outlets for exchange and, customers also made inquiries of\n\ncrocodile barbecued meat at the defendants' outlets.22.        Tan refuted Wong's\n\nallegation of confusion over the parties' respective marks. He too exhibited (to his\n\nsecond affidavit filed 1 March 2002) statutory declarations (10) sworn by proprietors of\n\nshops (not the plaintiffs' outlets) selling barbecued meats, which the plaintiffs had\n\nfiled in the opposition proceedings. The deponents swore there had been no confusion over\n\nthe parties' marks on the part of their customers. On the contrary Tan stated, the only\n\nconfusion that arose related to the defendants' name. He pointed out that in the market,\n\nthere is more than one company with the defendants' name. Besides the defendants, Tan was\n\naware of four (4) other companies bearing the defendants' name, all in the business of\n\nmanufacturing/selling \"bakwa\". He named them (supported by searches from the\n\nRegistry of Companies and other documents) as follows:(a)        a sole proprietorship\n\ncalled Bee Chun Heng;(b)        a partnership called Bee\n\nChun Heng(c)        Bee Chun Heng Keng Kee;(d)        Bee Chung Heng Lau Po.Tan deposed that the above firms are all offshoots from the same family\n\nwhich started the original business in the 1930s. He added that the three (3) rival\n\nfactions continue to deal in the same business and compete with one another strenuously.23.        Tan (in his second\n\naffidavit) also questioned the veracity of the explanation given by the publishers ofSingapore\n\nWomen's Weekly, for printing the defendants' telephone number instead of the\n\nplaintiffs' in their article. He recalled that the plaintiffs had invited the magazine to\n\na press conference (on 15 November 2001) in conjunction with the opening of their new\n\noutlet at Bugis Junction. Attendees were given a press kit comprising inter alia, of\n\nmaterials (which clearly showed the plaintiffs' addresses and telephone numbers) as well\n\nas samples of the plaintiffs' products, again with the plaintiffs' addresses/telephone\n\ncontacts on most of the packaging. Miss Beverly Gomez (presumably the 'intern' referred\n\nto) attended on the magazine's behalf. If indeed she had wanted to check the\n\nplaintiffs’ telephone numbers, she need only have contacted the plaintiffs at the\n\nnumber(s) stated on their products/materials; why did she have to use the Chinese\n\ncharacter \"Xiang\" as a guide? I note from Tan's exhibitTTH-22that the\n\nplaintiffs had faxed their invitation to the magazine on their letterhead which contained\n\ntheir fax as well as telephone numbers and, the invitation also stated the telephone and\n\nhand-phone numbers of one Joanne Ho, should the magazine wish to contact the plaintiffs.\n\nOne would have thought that if indeed Beverly Gomez (or anyone else) needed to verify the\n\nplaintiffs' contact numbers, she would logically have calledeitherJoanne Ho or\n\nthe plaintiffs, not look at the \"Xiang\" logo (if indeed it was published) in the\n\ntelephone directory.24.        I should add that Tan\n\nalso cast doubts on the veracity of Wong's claim that the plaintiffs' customers attempted\n\nto exchange products at the defendants' outlets or asked to purchase barbecued crocodile\n\nmeat. I share Tan's scepticism on the former instance of confusion as Wong did not\n\nelaborate on the kind of products sought to be exchanged by 'confused' customers; I cannot\n\nimagine how customers of perishable products like barbecued pork would be allowed to\n\nexchange what they had purchased unless the packaging contained expiry dates and their\n\npurchases had indeed expired at the time they bought the same.The decision25.        As there is only one\n\nappeal by the defendants against my decision in granting the O 14 application, I shall\n\nconfine my grounds to that application, bearing in mind that:(i)        I had declined to grant\n\nthe injunction application;(ii)        the opposition\n\nproceedings relating to the plaintiffs' application to register the trademark in class 29\n\nis still pending and I should not prejudge the issue.26.        It was not disputed by\n\nthe defendants (according to Wong's affidavits and their counsel's submissions) that they\n\ndid not have the plaintiffs' consent to reproduce the Work or the plaintiffs' trademark\n\nT95/06325E (the trademark) in the defendants' advertisement and other notices.\n\nConsequently, there was infringement within s 31(1) of the Copyright Act Cap 63 (the\n\nCopyright Act); the section states:Subject to the provisions of this Act, the copyright in\n\n    a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is infringed by a person who, not being the\n\n    owner of the copyright, and without the licence of the owner of the copyright, does in\n\n    Singapore, or authorises the doing in Singapore of, any act comprised in the copyright.27.        I shall now refer to some\n\nother provisions of the Copyright Act, which had led me to conclude there was infringement\n\nby the defendants of the Work.28.        I start with s 7 which\n\nstates:(1)\n\n          \"Artistic work\" means —(a)        a\n\n  painting, sculpture, drawing, engraving or photograph, whether the work is of artistic\n\n  quality or not;(b)        a\n\n  building or model of a building, whether the building or model is of artistic quality or\n\n  not; or(c)        a work\n\n  of artistic craftsmanship to which neither paragraph (a) nor (b) applies;but does not include a layout-design or an\n\n  integrated circuit within the meaning of section 2 of the\n\n           Layout-Design of Integrated Circuits Act\n\n  1999 (Act 3 of 1999).29.        Other provisions of the\n\nCopyright Act which are relevant for our purpose are the following:-26 — (1) For the purposes of this Act, unless the\n\n  contrary intention appears, copyright, in relation to a work, is the exclusive right\n\n  —(a)        \n\n    .......................(i)        to reproduce the work in a material form;(ii)        to publish the work if the work is\n\n  unpublished ;(b)        in the\n\n    case of an artistic work, to do all or any of the following acts:(i)        to reproduce the work in a material form;(ii)        to publish the work in Singapore or any\n\n  country in relation to which this Act applies, if the work is unpublished;27. — (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, copyright shall\n\n  subsist in an original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work that is unpublished\n\n  and of which the author —(a)        was a qualified person at the time when the\n\n  work was made; or(b)        if the making of the work extended over a\n\n  period — was a qualified person for a substantial part of that period.(4)        In this\n\n    section, \"qualified person\" means a citizen of Singapore or a person resident in\n\n                  Singapore.30.        There is no question that\n\nthe Work created by Chionh comes within the definition of \"artistic work\"\n\nunder s 7(a) of the Copyright Act. Equally, it cannot be disputed that Chionh comes within\n\nthe definition of \"qualified person\" under s 27(1)(a) and (4) of the same\n\nAct as, he holds a Singapore identity card. If he is not a citizen, then he must be at\n\nleast a permanent resident. In any case, the assertion by Tan (in his first affidavit)\n\nthat Chionh is a Singapore citizen was not challenged by the defendants. Further, the\n\nassignment agreement in exhibitTTH2of Tan's first affidavit indicated that Chionh\n\nresides in Singapore. As the defendants have not made any issue of the assignment\n\nagreement, I assumed that the same was/is both valid and subsisting.31.        The defendants also did\n\nnot dispute that the Work has indeed been published by the plaintiffs. Over the years\n\nsince the Work was created in 1994, the plaintiffs have used the same extensively on their\n\nproducts. The defendants did not have the plaintiffs' permission to reproduce the Work in\n\na material form under s 26(b)(i) when they advertised the same on 2 and 3 February 2002.32.        Based on the sections of\n\nthe Copyright Act set out above, it appeared to me that all the ingredients to found\n\nliability on the part of the defendants for copyright infringement had been satisfied.33.        On their part, although\n\nthey did not deny infringement, the defendants raised a number of defences, some of which\n\nwere so completely unmeritorious (implied licence, s 74 of the Copyright Act) that I shall\n\nnot refer to them. I shall only refer to two (2) of the defences which warranted\n\nconsideration.34.        The first defence raised\n\nwas the question of fair dealing, under s 37 of the Copyright Act; that section states:-A fair dealing with a literary, dramatic, musical or\n\n    artistic work, or with an adaptation of a literary, dramatic or musical work, shall not\n\n    constitute an infringement of the copyright in the work if it is for the purpose of, or is\n\n    associated with, the reporting of current events —(a)        in a\n\n    newspaper, magazine or similar periodical and a sufficient acknowledgement of the work is\n\n    made or(b)        by means\n\n    of broadcasting, or a cable programme service or in a cinematograph film.Counsel for the defendants had argued that the Copyright Act provides\n\nfor certain common law defences, one of which was fair dealing in the public interest.\n\nCitingHubbard & Anor v Vosper & Anor[1972] 2 QB 84,Beloff v Pressdram\n\nLtd[1973] 1 All ER 241 andLion Laboratories Ltd v Evans & Others[1985] 1 QB 526, counsel submitted that the Copyright Act should not be used as a mechanism to\n\nsuppress information which the public has a right as well as an interest, to know. I was\n\nnot persuaded by this argument. Firstly, the matter was only of interest to the plaintiffs\n\nand the defendants, not to the general public. Further, it seemed to me to be straining\n\nthe language of s 37(a) of the Copyright Act to say that the incidents of confusion\n\nalleged by the defendants could qualify ascurrent eventswhen, the first instance\n\nof confusion (on the part of Bloomdale) took place in 1988 while the press conference (out\n\nof which confusion on the part of theSingapore Women's Weeklyarose) took place on\n\n15 November 2001. These events can hardly qualify ascurrent.35.        Counsel's reliance on the\n\nthree (3) authorities was misconceived. To elaborate, inHubbard v Vosper, the\n\nEnglish Court of Appeal (per Denning MR) spoke of \"fair dealing\" under s 6(2) of\n\nthe Copyright Act 1956 (which wording is similar to s 37 of our Act) in the following\n\nterms (pp 94-95):It is impossible to define what is \"fair\n\n    dealing\". It must be a question of degree. You must consider first the number and\n\n    extent of the quotations and extracts. Are they altogether too many and too long to be\n\n    fair? Then you must consider the use made of them. If they are used as a basis for\n\n    comment, criticism or review, that may be fair dealing. If they are used to convey the\n\n    same information as the author, for a rival purpose, that may be\n\n    unfair…………….……………………………………………………….Although a literary work may not be published to the\n\n    world at large, it may, however, be circulated to such a wide circle that it is \"fair\n\n    dealing\" to criticise it publicly in a newspaper, or elsewhere. This happens\n\n    sometimes when a company sends a circular to the whole body of shareholders. It may be of\n\n    such general interest that it is quite legitimate for a newspaper to make quotations from\n\n    it and to criticise them – or review them – without thereby being guilty of\n\n    infringing copyright.As the Work isnota literary but an artistic, work, I did not\n\nthink the defence of fair dealing was available to the defendants. In this regard, I\n\ndisagreed with the submission of counsel for the plaintiffs, who relied onAnacon\n\nCorporation Limited v Environmental Research Technology Limited[1994] FLR 659 for his\n\nproposition that the Work was a literary work. Applying Jacob J's conditions for a\n\nliterary work (holding no. 5) in that case, whilst I agree Chionh's logo was written down,\n\nI cannot say it contained information which could be read by someone, as opposed to being\n\nappreciated simply with the eye, unlike circuit diagrams (which was the subject matter of\n\ninfringement in that case).36.        I turn now to the other\n\ntwo (2) cases cited by the defendants. The court (Ungoed-Thomas J) inBeloff v\n\nPressdram Ltdrelied on the definition of \"fair dealing\" inHubbard v\n\nVosperwhen it dismissed the plaintiff's claim for copyright infringement of a\n\nmemorandum dated 17 February 1971 which she had written to the editor of The Observer\n\nnewspaper, while employed as its correspondent.Lion Laboratories Ltd v Evanswas\n\nan action for infringement of copyright, by manufacturers of an electronic computerised\n\ninstrument known as the Lion Intoximeter 3000, which was used to test the breath of\n\nmotorists suspected of driving after consuming alcohol beyond the statutorily prescribed\n\nlimit. The plaintiffs sought an injunction and damages for breach of confidence and\n\ncopyright against their former employees/technicians, who had taken away (without\n\nauthority) the company's confidential internal memoranda, which cast doubt on the accuracy\n\nof the functioning of the instrument. The appellate court held that there was a conflict\n\nbetween two public interests namely, the plaintiffs' right to protect their internal,\n\nconfidential information and their copyright in them and, the public's entitlement to\n\ninformation which raised serious doubts about the reliability of an instrument which was\n\nproviding the sole evidence on which members of the public had been or were being\n\nprosecuted. The court went on to hold that the information contained in the documents was\n\nso important to the public as to outweigh the plaintiffs' interests and accordingly, the\n\ncourt would (overruling the decision below) permit publication of specified documents.\n\nThese two (2) cases are far removed from the facts of our case.37.        I had briefly addressed\n\n(para 16supra) the preliminary issue raised by counsel for the defendants, that\n\nthe requirements of s 27 of the Trademarks Act had not been satisfied. Counsel relied on s\n\n27(6) for his submission that his clients' use of the Work wasfor the purpose of\n\nidentifying goods or services as those of the proprietor or licensee. This submission\n\ndid not find favour with me either. I accepted the plaintiffs'/Tan's interpretation of the\n\nadvertisement/notices as containing a subtle suggestion that the defendants' goods had\n\nbeen confused with those of the plaintiffs' which were inferior to the defendants', that\n\nthe plaintiffs were responsible for such confusion and, that the plaintiffs copied the\n\ndefendants' logo. The situation was aggravated by Wong's subsequent press statement. The\n\nparties had exhibited in their clients' respective affidavits, their own translations of\n\nthat press statement. I have considered both translations and there is little difference\n\nbetween the two (2). In essence, both versions said that Wong had stated that both\n\ncompanies used the Chinese character \"Xiang\" in their logos. What was\n\nobjectionable about the defendants' advertisement and Wong's press statement was, that the\n\ndefendants did not disclose (nor in their submissions) that the Chinese character\n\n\"Xiang\" had been expressly disclaimed by the defendants; the certificate for\n\ntheir mark No. T91/10763J registered under class 29 (exhibitTTH-4in Tan's first\n\naffidavit filed 8 February 2002) stated:Registration of this mark shall give no right to the\n\n    exclusive use of the Chinese character(s) of which the hanyu pinyin is \"Xiang\"\n\n    except in the form as represented.Their mark was protected only in respect of theformin which\n\nthe character was represented. Yet, knowing that and, that the registration of the\n\nplaintiffs' mark under class 29 was still pending due to their opposition (alleging\n\nsimilarity and confusion with the defendants' mark), the defendants placed the\n\nadvertisement in the manner they did and Wong spoke to the press, giving the impression\n\nthat the defendants had first use of the Chinese character \"Xiang\" and the\n\nplaintiffs were a ‘newcomer’. Why else would the press report that the following\n\nquestion was asked of Wong?Will the ‘Fragrance’ brand/logo affect the revenue/turnover of [the defendants]?Conclusion38.        The defendants had\n\nadmitted infringing the copyright in the Work while the plaintiffs had fulfilled all the\n\nrequirements under the Copyright Act for their claim. As no defence or any triable issue\n\nwas raised against the plaintiffs' claim, I granted an order in terms of prayer 1 of the O\n\n14 application, so as to restrain the defendants from repeating the mischief committed by\n\ntheir advertisement/notices.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
