        "The Plaintiffs’ case": "11. The Plaintiffs’ case is that they\n\nwanted to buy a property for their home. They were looking for a house of about $400,000,\n\nwhich was what they could afford. Their brother Bala learnt that the property was\n\navailable and persuaded them to buy it although the price was $630,000. Bala promised to\n\nhelp them get a housing loan, and also to assist them with the mortgage repayments.12. Bala played an active role in the\n\npurchase. He made the arrangements with Citibank, and appointed the solicitors who acted\n\nin the purchase.13. The Plaintiffs were obliged to make\n\nmonthly repayments to Citibank. They intended to do that by making withdrawals from their\n\nCPF accounts, by monthly $800 cash payments they handed to Bala, then Bala would help to\n\ntop up the shortfall. The payments Bala made were to be considered as loans which had to\n\nbe repaid.14. Bala did not sustain his assistance\n\nwith the mortgage payments and the Plaintiffs fell behind in the payments. Bala found a\n\nsolution for the Plaintiffs. He arranged for them to repay Citibank with a loan from UMBC\n\nFinance. Bala made the arrangements and appointed the solicitors for these transactions.15. The relief was short-lived and soon\n\nthe Plaintiffs were having difficulties in servicing the UMBC Finance loan. Bala arranged\n\nanother change of lenders, this time to OCBC Finance. This was accomplished on 23 December\n\n1992 when the UMBC Finance mortgage was discharged with the help of a $485,000 loan from\n\nOCBC Finance secured on the property. On this occasion Bala also requested the Plaintiffs\n\nto help him obtain a loan for Seawell by offering the property as security.16. The First Plaintiff alleged that the\n\nDefendant did not explain to him and the Second Plaintiff the terms of the mortgage\n\ndocuments they executed or advise them on their liability and obligations thereunder. The\n\nsame complaint was made in respect of the second collateral mortgage they executed\n\nsubsequently.17. The First Plaintiff referred to an\n\noccasion in February 1996 when the Defendant and Sharon Lee-Tay, Assistant General Manager\n\nof OCBC Finance came to the property. They told him that the shipping loans were not paid,\n\nand that OCBC Finance may sell that property to recover the loans. He told them that he\n\nand the Second Plaintiff could not repay the shipping loans and suggested that OCBC\n\nFinance look to Bala and his associates for payment.18. He told Bala about the visit and Bala\n\npromised to do something. In May or June 1996 Bala brought an option for him and the\n\nSecond Plaintiff to sign. Bala told them the option was prepared by the Defendant and was\n\nfor the sale of the property for $2.5 million to Yeo Holdings. They signed the option and\n\nhanded it back to Bala. A few days before the completion Bala saw them again with a letter\n\nof authority. He told them that the letter was needed to allow repayments to be made to\n\nOCBC Finance and the CPF, and they signed the letter. The First Plaintiff deposed that\n\nBala also told them that after buying the property,… the Purchasers were going to\n\n  redevelop the property soon after the completion of the purchase, and the Purchasers would\n\n  sell one unit in the redevelopment to us.They signed the letter of authority on the\n\nstrength of the assurance.19. The letter is an important document in\n\nthese proceedings. It readsLetter of AuthorityTo: Yeo Holdings Private Limited9 Pandan RoadSingapore 609257re:70 Hythe Road SingaporeWe, the undersigned Subramaniam s/o\n\n  Kalimuthu and Kandasamy Ambualagan, the registered proprietors and vendors of the above\n\n  referred property on behalf of ourselves and the beneficial owners of the property hereby\n\n  irrevocably request and authorise you to pay the full proceeds of sale of Dollars Two\n\n  Million and Five Hundred Thousand ($2,500,000.00) for the said property in full and final\n\n  discharge of your liability thereunder as follows:1. Yeo Holdings Private Limited\n\n  $760,000.00 (being moneys advanced and paid by you to OCBF Finance Singapore Limited on\n\n  behalf of Balakrishnan s/o Kandasamy @ Mohd Feroz Bin Abdullah for his share in the\n\n  outstanding loan account on the mortgages of \"Seawell Sapphire\" and\n\n  \"Seawell Success\").2. Yeo Holdings Private Limited $28,531.25+ $781.95 = 29,313.20(being reimbursement of interest ( up to 15.6.96) on the sum\n\n  of $760,000.00 paid to OCBC Finance Singapore Limited).3.

OCBC Finance$538,473.62(signed)Subramaniam s/o Kalimuthu(signed)Kandasamy Ambualagan(The words and figures in bold appear in\n\n  handwriting)20. It is the evidence of the First\n\nPlaintiff that the handwritten words and figures were not inserted when the letter of\n\nauthority was produced for him and his brother to sign.21. Their next dealing with the property\n\nwas in 18 June when Bala took them to the Defendant’s office. After they arrived at\n\nher office they were taken to another office to execute a statutory declaration before\n\nthey were brought back to the Defendant’s office to execute the transfer instrument.22. The First Plaintiff deposed thatI asked the Defendant about the balance of\n\n  the purchase price. The Defendant then replied that after paying the mortgage loan of OCBC\n\n  Finance and the outstanding of CPF Board, the balance of the purchase price would be kept\n\n  by her in order to pay on our behalf for the semi-detached house to be built on the\n\n  redevelopment of the property by the Purchasers. The Defendant told us that Balakrishnan\n\n  would have told us about the redevelopment and we confirmed. The Defendant told the 2ndPlaintiff and me that the Purchasers were going to build two semi-detached houses by\n\n  redeveloping the property, and one semi-detached house would be sold to us. We accepted\n\n  what the Defendant had told. The Defendant did not provide any advice on the need to have\n\n  some agreement in writing in order to protect our interest in the alleged redevelopment of\n\n  property.23. They did not hear about the transfer\n\nagain until they received the Defendant’s letter of 4 July 1996. The letter reads\n\n–4thJuly 1996Mr. Subramaniam s/o Kalimuthu70 Hythe RoadSingapore 557551Mr. Kandasamy Ambualagan70 Hythe RoadSingapore 557551Mr. Balakrishnan s/o Kandasamy@ Mohd Feroz bin Abdullah70 Hythe RoadSingapore 557551Yeo Holdings Private Limited9 Pandan RoadSingapore 609257Dear Sirs,re:70 Hythe Road SingaporeAccording to your instructions the\n\n  redemption and sale and purchase of the above referred property has been completed (in\n\n  accordance with the Option dated 2ndMay 1996 exercised by the purchaser on 10thJune 1996) on 18thJune 1996, as scheduled.The Discharge of CPF Charge, Total\n\n  Discharge of Mortgage and the Transfer thereof have been dated 18thJune 1996\n\n  and provisionally registered at the Registry of Titles on 20thJune 1996 as\n\n  Instruments Nos.

The Plaintiffs said they glanced\n\nthrough the letter but did not understand it. They vacated the property in March 1997\n\nwithout protest.25. In March 1998, they went to see the\n\nDefendant to enquire about the redevelopment of the property. The Defendant told them that\n\nBala had received $929,800 of the sale proceeds.26. They were unhappy with the situation\n\nand consulted their current lawyers, Palakrishnan & Partners in April 1998.\n\nPalakrishnan & Partners wrote to the Defendant on 16 November 1998, informing herWe act for Mr Subramaniam s/o Kalimuthu\n\n  and Mr Kandasamy Ambualagan, …We are further instructed by our clients,\n\n  to categorically and unequivocally, deny paragraph 4 of your letter of 4 July 1996,\n\n  addressed to our clients (copy enclosed).We have been informed, that no\n\n  instructions whatsoever, were ever given by our clients to you, as their Solicitors,\n\n  authorising you to deduct in particular the sum of $948,591.50 mentioned in your said\n\n  letter.We are instructed that you have\n\n  unlawfully, transferred the said sum of $948,591.50 to Yeo Holdings Pte Ltd, without any\n\n  authority whatsoever from our clients.It is our considered opinion, that this\n\n  sum of monies should have been paid to our clients, as the Vendors of the property, at the\n\n  completion of their sale. Our clients, have lost the benefits of receiving this sum of\n\n  money, thereby causing great hardship and financial loss to them.We hereby do and demand from you, payment\n\n  of the sum of $948,591.50 with interest from date of completion of sale to date of payment\n\n  within seven (7) days from the date hereof.27. That remained as the Plaintiffs’\n\nclaim till they filed these proceedings and enlarged the claim.",
        "The Defendant’s case": "28. The Defendant’s case is that Bala\n\ninformed her that although the property was registered in the name of the Plaintiffs, it\n\nbelonged to him and she accepted and acted on this representation.29. She did not seek confirmation of that\n\nin writing from Bala or the Plaintiffs. She explained thatWhen the Plaintiffs attended before me to\n\n  execute the Mortgage and Collateral Mortgage of the Property in favour of OCBC Finance,\n\n  they confirmed that I was to act for them and that the Property was beneficially owned by\n\n  Captain Bala. They said that the Property belonged to Captain Bala and that they would act\n\n  in accordance with his instructions. Further, all correspondence pertaining to the\n\n  Property was to be sent to Captain Bala. In any event, before they signed the Mortgage and\n\n  Collateral Mortgage, I explained the contents and implications to them.30. With regard to the sale of the\n\nproperty, the Defendant deposed thatSometime before 2 May 1996, Captain Bala\n\n  told me that he intended to sell the Property to settle the debt owing to OCBC Finance and\n\n  Yeo. He asked me to prepare an Option to Purchase the Property and gave instructions to me\n\n  for the preparation of a letter of authority as regards the distribution of the sales\n\n  proceeds. On or before 2 May 1996, I gave him a copy of the Option and letter of authority\n\n  which I had prepared on his instructions.31. On 10 June when Yeo Holdings exercised\n\nthe option, she received the Plaintiffs’ letter of authority which was signed but\n\nundated. She sent it back to the Plaintiffs with a request for them to date it. At the\n\nsame time, she also informed them that she had requested OCBC Finance for a rebate on the\n\nredemption amount. The next day she wrote to them again with a revised letter with a\n\ncorrection of the figure in item 2 of the letter.32. She saw the Plaintiffs again on 18\n\nJune when the sale was completed. They brought back to her the letter of authority in its\n\noriginal form. She inserted the words in handwriting and added in the date. She explained\n\nto them the transfer and statutory declaration that they executed that day. The sale was\n\ncompleted that day, with payment made in accordance with the terms of the letter of\n\nauthority, and on 4 July she wrote to the Plaintiff, Bala and Yeo Holdings to report on\n\nthe completion.33. Nothing happened till March 1998 when\n\nthe Plaintiffs went to her office and asked her for Bala’s whereabouts and told her\n\nthat he had absconded, and had not fulfilled his promise to give them a share of the sale\n\nproceeds. She contacted Yeo Chong Lin and obtained from him Bala’s last-known\n\ntelephone number and a copy of his accounts with Bala and gave them to the Plaintiffs.\n\nThey returned a few days later because they were unable to contact Bala and said that they\n\nwill engage a lawyer to sue Bala. She next heard from them through Palakrishnan &\n\nPartner’s letter.",
        "The issues to be determined": "34. At the end of the hearing, I found\n\nthat the issues to be determined are(i) Was the Defendant negligent in acting\n\n  on Bala’s instructions?(ii) Was Bala the beneficial owner of the\n\n  property?(iii) Did the Defendant explain the\n\n  mortgages to the Plaintiffs? and(iv) Had the Defendant handled the sale of\n\n  the property properly?",
        "Was the Defendant negligent in acting on\n\nBala’s instructions?": "35. The Defendant was careless in\n\naccepting Bala as the beneficial owner of the property. Bala’s claim that he was the\n\nbeneficial owner of the property was self-serving. The certificate of title did not\n\nsupport his claim as the Plaintiffs were registered as the proprietors, and there was no\n\ncaveat lodged to give notice of his interest. Bala did not support his claim with any deed\n\nof trust in his favour. The Defendant should not act on Bala’s assertion without\n\ngetting written instructions from him and the Plaintiffs, and to ensure that the proper\n\ndocumentation is done.36. Her knowledge that the Plaintiffs had\n\nused their CPF funds to pay for the property should have raised doubts whether they were\n\nbare legal owners; she should be aware that the CPF Board would not release CPF monies for\n\nthe acquisition of the legal title in a property when the beneficial interest is vested in\n\nanother party. Although she did not act for the CPF Board she should consider these\n\nmatters when they came to her attention.37. In any event, she acted for the OCBC\n\nFinance in the mortgage and the two collateral mortgages. In each of these, the Plaintiffs\n\nmortgaged to OCBC Finance \"all the Mortgagor’s registered estate or\n\ninterest\" in the property. The Plaintiffs were registered as the tenants in common\n\nand equal shares in the certificate of title. That was clearly inconsistent with\n\nBala’s claim that he was the beneficial owner, yet the Defendant did not bring this\n\nto OCBC Finance’s attention. If Bala’s claim was true, she may have put OCBC\n\nFinance at risk when they made the loans on the assurance of the security offered.38. Even if Bala was the sole beneficial\n\nowner of the property, the Defendant should nevertheless take instructions from the\n\nPlaintiffs because they were the legal owners. Bala’s claimed beneficial interest did\n\nnot entitle him or her to ignore their legal interests.39. There is further basis for criticism.\n\nThe letter of authority she prepared on Bala’s instruction referred to \"the\n\nbeneficial owners of the property\" in plural. Her evidence was that she was informed\n\nthat the beneficial owners were Bala and his wife. If that was right, it would be another\n\nreason for her not to act on instructions issued by Bala alone.",
        "Was Bala the beneficial owner of the\n\nproperty?": "40. This issue is relevant because\n\nBala’s claim may be true even if the Defendant did not verify it. The Plaintiffs were\n\nnot Bala’s nominees. They had invested their CPF monies in the property which became\n\ntheir home. In all the previous dealings with the property, there was no suggestion that\n\nthey were not the beneficial owners.41. Having said that, it does not follow\n\nthat Bala did not have any interest in the property. Bala was involved with the property\n\nfrom the start. He persuaded the Plaintiffs to buy it instead of keeping to their budget\n\nof $400,000 and promised to pay for the shortfall from the Plaintiffs’ CPF and\n\npersonal contributions. He found the property, negotiated the price, arranged for the\n\nhousing loan and engaged the lawyers. He arranged for it to be used as security for the\n\ntwo shipping loans, and was very much involved in its eventual sale.42. I found the Plaintiffs’ evidence\n\nthat Bala’s payments or promised payments were loans difficult to accept. They did\n\nnot know how much he had paid or was to pay or how and when they were to repay him. They\n\nallowed the property to be used as security for the shipping loans taken by his company\n\nwithout any knowledge as to how these loans were going to be repaid.43. In additional to that, their account\n\nof their payment for the property was unsatisfactory. They claimed that they made payments\n\nby withdrawing from their CPF accounts, by making cash payments of $800 a month and by\n\nrelying on Bala’s assurance. However in reply to the Defendant’s interrogatory\n\non how they had financed the purchase, their answer was \"The Plaintiffs borrowed\n\nmoney from their Central Provident Fund Account, Citibank N.A. and from Captain\n\nBala\", with no reference to any cash payments from them.44. I find on the evidence that Bala may\n\nhave had some beneficial interest in the property together with the Plaintiffs.",
        "Did the Defendant explain the mortgage to\n\nthe Plaintiffs?": "45. The Plaintiffs admit that they knew\n\nthe mortgages were executed to secure the housing loan and the shipping loans. They also\n\nknew that a mortgagee may take possession of the property and sell it if its loans are not\n\nrepaid.46. They complained that the Defendant had\n\nnot explained the mortgage terms to them. The Defendant on the other hand maintained that\n\nshe had explained the documents to them.47. I considered the evidence. The\n\nPlaintiffs’ first complaint in the letter of Palakrishnan & Partners of 16\n\nNovember 1998 was significant. This letter referred to the Defendant’s letter of 4\n\nJuly 1996. In her letter the Defendant had referred to a payment to Yeo Holdings for\n\nadvances made in the repayment to OCBC Finance of loans in respect of the \"Seawell\n\nSapphire\" and \"Seawell Success\" and with the redemption monies paid to OCBC\n\nFinance.48. Palakrishnan & Partners stated\n\nspecifically that the Plaintiffs had not instructed her to deduct the $948,591.50 of the\n\nsale proceeds, and demanded payment of that sum. The letter is significant for what it did\n\nnot state. It did not state that the Defendant had not explained the terms of the\n\nmortgages to the Plaintiffs or that the other deductions were unauthorised or improper.49. After receiving their instructions and\n\nthe reading of the Defendant’s letter, Palakrishnan & Partners’ considered\n\nopinion was that the balance sum of $948,591.50 should have been paid over to the\n\nPlaintiffs.50. It must be remembered that the sale\n\nwas completed on 18 June 1996. The Plaintiffs were unhappy about not receiving any part of\n\nthe proceeds when they went to see the Defendant at her office in March 1998, more than a\n\nyear and a half later. They went to consult Palakrishnan & Partners in the following\n\nmonth, when they had lost faith in the Defendant.51. They must have recounted their\n\ndealings with the Defendant and showed her letter of 4 July to their new lawyers. Their\n\nlawyers must have explained the letter to them to get their instructions on the deductions\n\nmade.52. Nevertheless, Palakrishnan &\n\nPartners only demanded for the $948,591.50 and did not allege that the mortgages were not\n\nexplained to the Plaintiffs. That was the Plaintiffs’ position until the writ was\n\nfiled on 17 June 1999 with the enlarged claim. In the interim period the letter of 16\n\nNovember was not withdrawn or supplemented.53. If the Defendant had not explained the\n\nmortgages which led to the deductions, they would have brought that up with their lawyers,\n\nand their lawyers would have raised that in their letter to the Defendant.54. I find on the evidence on a balance of\n\nprobabilities that the Defendant had explained the terms of the mortgages to the\n\nPlaintiffs.",
        "Had the Defendant handled the sale of the\n\nproperty properly?": "55. The property was sold to Yeo Holdings\n\nthrough the issuance of the option on 2 May which was exercised on 10 June, leading to the\n\ncompletion on 18 June. The Plaintiffs complained that they were not advised about the $1\n\nfee paid for the option. The consideration for an option is a commercial decision. It can\n\nbe $1, $5,000, $10,000 or any sum that may be agreed upon. The Defendant had no duty to\n\nadvise the Plaintiffs on it, especially when her advice was not sought.56. Was she right to comply with the\n\nletter of authority? As I have pointed out earlier, when Palakrishnan & Partners wrote\n\nto the Defendant they informed her \"(w)e have been informed, that no instructions\n\nwhatsoever, were given by our clients to you, as their solicitors, authorising you to\n\ndeduct in particular the sum of $948,591.50 mentioned in your said letter\" and they\n\ndemanded payment of the $948,591.50.57. The Plaintiffs signed the letter of\n\nauthority, and in the letter of 16 November they accepted the accounts rendered in the\n\nletter of 4 July except for the final balance of $948,591.50 after it was explained to\n\nthem. They subsequently enlarged the claim when they instituted this action to\n\n$1,740,294.85, as particularised in paragraph 10. It is difficult to understand the\n\nrevision. They had not objected before to the $760,000 paid by Yeo Holdings on Bala’s\n\nbehalf to discharge the collateral mortgages and the interest accruing thereon were spelt\n\nout in the letter of authority and also referred to in the Defendant’s letter of 4\n\nJuly. They also did not explain their claim that the Defendant refunds the costs for\n\nacting for them in the transactions. Whether the Defendant had acted properly or not they\n\ncannot have the proceeds from the sale without paying legal costs.58. I find on the facts that the\n\nPlaintiffs’ real complaint was that they did not receive any part of the final\n\nbalance of the sale proceeds. The Plaintiffs claim that they were content not to receive\n\npayment when the property was sold because the Defendant represented to them that she was\n\nholding the money for it to be used to pay for one of the houses to be developed on the\n\nproperty and sold to them. The Defendant maintained that she had complied with the letter\n\nof authority and had reported on the sale in her letter of 4 July.59. The weight of evidence is against the\n\nPlaintiffs’ account. They knew very little of the house they claimed they were\n\nbuying. The First Plaintiff did not know how large the house would be, or how many rooms\n\nit would have. The Second Plaintiff only knew that it would be of two storeys, with\n\n4-plus-1 rooms. Neither knew the price they were to pay for the house because the price\n\nwas to be fixed after the house is constructed. Both Plaintiffs acknowledged that there\n\nwas no commitment to buy, and both said they would not buy if they could not afford the\n\nprice. That was consonant with Yeo Chong Lin’s undisputed evidence that \"Bala\n\nand I had never discussed that one of the semi-detached houses was to be sold to the\n\nPlaintiffs\".60. It was improbable that the Defendant\n\nwould have told the Plaintiffs that she was holding money for them for the payment of the\n\nhouse when there was no agreement to buy and no money was received or held by her except\n\nthe legal costs. The Defendant would be quite irrational to make that representation on 18\n\nJune, then contradict herself with the letter three weeks later.61. I find that the Defendant had\n\ncompleted the sale properly in accordance to the Plaintiffs’ letter of authority of\n\n18 June as reported in her letter of 4 July.",
        "Conclusion": "62. Although I find that the Defendant was\n\nwrong to act on Bala’s instructions without verification, and that Bala was not the\n\nsole beneficial owner of the property that she accepted him to be, she had explained the\n\nmortgages to the Plaintiffs, acted in accordance with the letter of authority and\n\naccounted for the proceeds of the sale.63. In the circumstances, I dismiss the\n\nPlaintiffs’ claim. On the question of costs, I feel that the Defendant should not be\n\nawarded the full costs of the action because her conduct in the transactions relating to\n\nthe property was certainly not beyond criticism. She did not discharge her duties properly\n\nin accepting Bala’s assertion without verification and in failing to report to OCBC\n\nFinance Bala’s instructions and her belief that the Plaintiffs were the bare legal\n\nowners of the property. She should receive half the costs of the action instead.Kan Ting ChiuJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
