        "Conclusion": "20     It was clear from evidence showed that Mr Ng had displayed great capability in building up his career in OCBC Bank. With only a secondary school education he managed to rise from bank clerk to branch manager. In that capacity he had served in various towns in Malaysia for nearly a quarter century. After he retired he continued to manifest great capability as he marshalled his savings well and multiplied it such that his net worth at the time of death was in the order of $6m. He was focused on preserving and growing his assets with the single minded purpose of leaving it entirely to his children. He ignored suggestions that he should give some of it to charity. He was even concerned that the religious group that Edwin was involved in might get some of it through Edwin. 21     The plaintiffs’ case was that Mr Ng had no intention, in relation to the distribution of his estate, to prefer one child over the others. From his actions over the last three decades of his life, this appeared to be the case. In the 1982 Will, he essentially distributed his estate equally among his four children with a double share to his wife. After his wife died, Mr Ng executed the 1989 Will in which he provided for equal distribution among his four children. At various times in the last decade of his life Mr Ng also recorded a number of notes in relation to bank accounts he held jointly with various children. All these acts indicated the mindset of Mr Ng, which was to distribute an equal share of his estate to his surviving issue. 22     The plaintiffs further pointed out that Mr Ng was a former banker and a careful and meticulous man and contended that all these acts indicated his mindset all the while, which was to distribute an equal share of his estate to his surviving issue. Therefore, the plaintiffs contended, it could not have been possible that Mr Ng, having given Meiling twice as much as each of the other two sons, would gift to her practically half his assets and after this, further give her half the remainder. 23     However this submission did not take into account the mindset and emotions at the material time, which was the period between Edwin’s death and his own. Here was a man whose eldest son had just died and driven to contemplating his own mortality. Mr Ng’s two sons were successful in their careers and their lives but he was severely disappointed at how they treated him. His daughter, who was single and lived with him, was not as capable as her brothers. He was fully aware that she would be quite alone in this world after his demise. It is in this context that I must consider whether it was so incredible that Mr Ng could, at that time, have acted in the manner that Meiling and Puthucheary had testified that he did. I certainly thought that it was entirely possible. 24     Indeed on the evidence before me, I found that in the remaining weeks of his life, Mr Ng had a change of mind regarding the distribution of his estate. Certainly with respect to what Mr Ng had provided in the Will, there is ample evidence that he had a change of mind. In the two previous wills, the 1982 Will and 1989 Will, he had provided his four children with equal shares. Throughout the last decade of his life, the notes he left behind showed that they were to receive equal shares of his properties, except with provisions to ensure that Edwin would be taken care of. But when Edwin died, Mr Ng was severely affected. And when it came to putting down his intentions in his last will and testament, he had clearly provided that Meiling would get a half share whereas the plaintiffs would only get a quarter each. This puts paid to the plaintiffs’ contention that Mr Ng’s past manifestations of intent in relation to distribution of his assets showed that he could not have intended to give Meiling more. 25     There was a rather poignant event that I felt compelled to note. The plaintiffs and Puthucheary emphasised that at the 8 (or 9) March 2007 meeting, Mr Ng had declared to all present, namely Meiling, Roy, Puthucheary and Cheng that in his new will he would give each of his three children an equal share of his estate. After that he had a tête-à-tête with Puthucheary in which he poured out his sorrows regarding his children and then told the lawyer that he wanted to make further instructions regarding his will, without specifying what these were. Less than a week later, on 14 March 2007, Mr Ng instructed Puthucheary on the 50:25:25 distribution after again ventilating his sorrows to his confidant. Puthucheary said that Mr Ng complained about his sons, but not Meiling. Mr Ng told Puthucheary that he was very disappointed in Roy and Wilfred, that they only called him about money and never inquired after his health. He told Puthucheary about the humiliation he had suffered from them and their wives. I would comment that if Mr Ng had changed his mind about the distribution after he had declared to his children that he was giving them equal shares, it was rather sad that he did not tell them about it after he had executed the Will. But if he had decided on the change even before he made the declaration of equal distribution, it was even sadder that he felt compelled to lie to his children. I should state that I am not making a finding of fact on the truth of what Mr Ng had told Puthucheary in respect of his sons. I was well cognisant of the fact that Mr Ng had just faced the tragedy of the death of his eldest son and that at the age of 90, he was coming face-to-face with his own mortality. I had no doubt that the smallest of incidents could have loomed large at that hour, and the most minute hurts vastly amplified. What was relevant was Mr Ng’s state of mind at the time and whether in that state of mind he could have made such decisions. 26     The cause of Mr Ng’s change of mind could be any of a number of factors. It could well be, as the plaintiffs’ witnesses alleged, that Meiling had prevailed upon Mr Ng that she should get a larger share. There were suggestions that she was insecure or simply greedy and had schemed and harassed Mr Ng to change his mind. There was testimony that she had always wanted a better life and had over the years tried unsuccessfully to get Mr Ng to move out of the Jalan Mesui house, which was in the middle of town, to one located in more salubrious surroundings. There was evidence that Mr Ng had said that he changed the distribution in the Will because of Meiling’s demands on him. Meiling’s evidence was that Mr Ng did it out of gratitude to her for taking care of him and also out of love and concern for her situation – the plaintiffs were successful professionals who had families of their own whereas she was not highly educated and was alone in this world. Meiling also said that Mr Ng could have been angry at Roy and Wilfred for their lack of concern towards him and at their wives for their disrespect and mistreatment. It could well be that Mr Ng changed his mind due to a combination of some or all of these factors, or due to some other factors that did not surface in evidence. For instance, it was clear that Mr Ng had always made special provision for Edwin as he was considered the one who most needed help and after Edwin was gone, Mr Ng could have considered Meiling to be in this position. The true reason for Mr Ng’s change of mind is not relevant. A person is entitled to deal with his assets in any manner he deems fit (subject always to any law that might limit his freedom in this regard – but there is none here). It is not unusual for a person to hold a strong view of a particular matter throughout his life but at a later stage, when confronted with tragedy (in this case, Edwin’s death) or the reality of his own mortality, to change that view. This is especially true in relation to religious views, but perhaps no less so in relation to the material legacy that a person intends to leave behind for his loved ones. 27     Therefore the argument cannot turn on why Mr Ng would change his mind, because he did at least in relation to the Will, but only on the extent of the change of mind. Did he or did he not decide, in addition to giving Meiling half of his estate under the Will, to give to her while he was still alive, the moneys in the joint accounts? In this regard, Meiling’s evidence was that Mr Ng had told her that “it’s up to you” when she asked him about the money in the HSBC Account. This evidence was corroborated by the evidence of Puthucheary who said that Mr Ng had told him at the time he gave instructions on the Will that he was giving the moneys in the HSBC Account and other joint accounts with Meiling to her. The plaintiffs were in the difficult position of proving a negative. The main thrust of their evidence was that, based on Mr Ng’s attitude as manifested by his previous actions, he could not have given such a grossly disproportionate amount to Meiling. However, in view of the clear evidence of Mr Ng’s change of mind in relation to the distribution under the Will, and in the circumstances of Mr Ng at the time when he was grieving for Edwin and facing his own mortality, there was every possibility of such a major change of mind. This was especially when one considered the relative circumstances of Meiling and the plaintiffs. In my view, the combined evidence of Meiling and Puthucheary proved on a balance of probability that Mr Ng had given to Meiling the moneys in the HSBC Account and I so find. 28     Therefore the plaintiffs’ claim is dismissed. As to costs, ordinarily it would follow the event. But this is a family dispute. A number of factors had combined to send the dispute between the siblings to court, not least of which was Mr Ng’s rather furtive behaviour in relation to his decision to distribute his assets. He may well have been despondent because he felt that his sons were more concerned over his money than his health. Therefore in an effort to spare himself the agony of having to face up to them in the final stage of his life, he decided to declare that he would share his assets equally while proceeding to do otherwise. This had caused the plaintiffs to believe that there was some subterfuge when Mr Ng’s Will turned out to be very different from what he had declared. Meiling’s behaviour had aggravated the matter for the plaintiffs. She had, with some alacrity, transferred the money out of the Public Bank Account and the HSBC Account. Puthucheary’s failure to disclose at an early stage Mr Ng’s statement to him that he had gifted to Meiling the moneys in the joint accounts had also raised the plaintiffs’ suspicion. While Puthucheary’s reason for this – that it was told to him in confidence by the Mr Ng – was not unreasonable, this was one of the factors that had caused the plaintiffs to resort to litigation. Taking into account the fact that Meiling had obtained a considerable sum of money in this matter, the nature of this dispute and the unfortunate chain of events that had resulted in this suit, I am of the view that I ought to exercise my discretion to make no order as to costs. I so order."
