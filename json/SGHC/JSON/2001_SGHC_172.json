        "The restoration claim": "The first claim was for damages for breach of contract and was based on a provision in the expired tenancy. The relevant provision read as follows:In addition to the foregoing and immediately prior to the expiration or sooner determination of the term hereby created and as instructed by the Landlord to restore the Demised Premises to its original state and condition to the satisfaction of the Landlord and if the Tenant shall fail to restore the same the Landlord may recover from the Tenant the costs of such restoration together with all rent and other amounts which the Landlord would have been entitled to receive from the tenant had the period within which restoration is effected by the Landlord been added to the terms hereby created provided that such period to be added by the Landlord shall not exceed fifteen (15) days.The next clause expanded the provision as follows:In complying with Clause 2(36) hereof and if so required by the Landlord the Tenant shall remove all internal partitions and/or fixtures and installations of the Tenant or any part thereof from all portions of the Demised Premises vacated by the Tenant immediately upon or prior to the expiration or sooner determination of the term hereby created and in default thereof the Landlord may remove and dispose of the same. All damage done to the Demised Premises by such removal shall be made good by the Tenant immediately upon or prior to the expiration or sooner determination of the term hereby created and if the Tenant fails to do so the Landlord may make good all such damage. All costs incurred by the Landlord in such removal or disposal or in making good such damage shall be a debt due from the Tenant to the Landlord and shall be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord within fourteen (14) days of the Landlord notifying the Tenant of the amount hereof.Clause 5(2) of the expired lease read as follows:In the interpretation of this Lease except to the extent that such interpretation shall be excluded by or be repugnant to the context when used herein:(d) \"restoration\" used in the context hereof shall mean the restoration of the Demised Premises to its original state and condition including:(i) the making good of any damage or disfigurement caused to walls doors windows or any part of the Demised Premises;(ii) the washing down of the whole of the interior of the Demised Premises;(iii) the painting with two coats of oil paint or emulsion paint or other appropriate treatment of all of the internal parts of the Demised Premises previously so treated respectively;(iv) the re-polishing of all the internal parts previously polished;(v) the graining and varnishing of all the internal parts previously grained and varnished;(vi) the replacing of all floor tiles which in the opinion of the Landlord are worn or damaged and in need of replacement;(vii) the removal and clearance of all waste rubbish and other unwanted material from the Demised Premises;(viii) the surrender of all keys giving access to all parts of the Demised Premises held by the Tenant or any of the Tenant`s employees or agents irrespective of whether or not the same have been supplied by the Landlord.The plain meaning of the above provision is that there must be an actual restoration. Without an actual restoration there can be no claim for restoration. Additionally, Thomson Plaza has submitted the purported claim for restoration as a claim for special damages. Special damages must be proved. In this case, there was no expense at all. What was sought was a windfall when there was no provision for it. Apart from that, inferentially Thomson Plaza appeared to have benefited from non-compliance with the restoration provisions. The premises were rented out to NTUC who were in the same business as Yaohan. Thomson Plaza`s claim for restoration was, therefore, without any legal, moral or commercial basis. It was rejected by the liquidator for a good reason. The law does not award special damages which are patently unreasonable and exorbitant.

        "Claim for rent": "The claim for rent is based on a new lease from 1 August 1997. This point requires a consideration of the law.InAlpenstow v Regalian Properties plc[1985] 2 All ER 545[1985] 1 WLR 721the plaintiffs appointed the defendants as development consultants in connection with a planning inquiry affecting land which they had bought for development. In February 1983, they undertook that if, on the grant of permission, they wished to dispose of the land, they would either grant the defendants the right to purchase the land or would pay them o500,000. In July 1983, by an exchange of letters, that agreement was cancelled. A fresh agreement was entered into, whereby if, following the grant of permission, the plaintiffs wished to dispose of the land, they would serve a notice on the defendants of their willingness to sell a 51% interest in the freehold, or pay the defendants o500,000.If they wished to sell any part of their interest in the property, (a) they were to give notice to the defendants of their willingness to sell to the defendants at a stated price, (b) within 28 days of the notice the defendants would inform them of their acceptance of the contract, subject to contract, and within seven days thereafter, the plaintiffs would submit a draft contract for approval by the defendants, and (c) within 28 days of receipt of the draft contract the defendants would approve the contract, and exchange contracts within seven days thereafter. The defendants were given the liberty to make amendments reasonably required by them. The letter concluded by stating that the plaintiffs were awaiting confirmation of acceptance of the agreement set out in the letter. The defendants duly accepted the agreement. Subsequently planning permission was granted and the plaintiffs gave notice of their willingness to sell part of their interest to the defendants. The defendants accepted the contract, but on request for a draft contract the plaintiffs contended that the letter of 12 July setting out the agreement was `subject to contract` and accordingly was not a binding contract. That is to  say, they were entitled to withdraw without giving any reason. The defendants sought specific performance of the agreement and registered cautions against the land concerned in order to protect their position. The plaintiffs moved to have the cautions removed, and the question arose as to what was the effect of the words `subject to contract` in the circumstances.Notably, if the plaintiff had not made the offer to sell, they would have had to make an outright payment of o500,000 to the defendants. By making the offer to sell, they effectively deprived the defendants of their right to receive o500,000. By invoking the magic phrase `subject to contract`, they were now seeking to deprive the defendants of their right to an interest in the property. The question, therefore, was whether the magic phrase was intended to give them that right. Nourse J said `no`. He explained:On their true construction the letters, which constituted a detailed and conscientiously drawn document cancelling and replacing a previous binding agreement, provided a very strong and exceptional context in which the words \"subject to contract\" should not be given their prima facie meaning whereby either party could withdraw before contracts were exchanged in accordance with ordinary conveyancing practice; and that, accordingly, when the defendants accepted the plaintiffs` notice of willingness to sell there was an agreement for the sale of the plaintiffs` interest in the land under which the defendants took an equitable interest.The requirement of `a very strong and exceptional context`, therefore, emphasises the general inflexibility of the meaning of the magic phrase `subject to contract`.I shall now state the law on the meaning and effect of the magic phrase `subject to contract`. It would be apt to start with the excellent caseLow Kar Yit v Mohamed Isa[1963] MLJ 165. In that case Gill J made a comprehensive review of relevant authorities extant in 1963.The defendants, the administrators of the deceased owner of 10 acres of land, granted an option to purchase the land. As usual the option was to be exercised, by giving notice in writing. If the option was exercised it was subject to:(a) a formal contract to be drawn up and agreed upon by yourself and ourselves;(b) the approval of the sale and of the said contract by the High Court at Kuala Lumpur.The option was exercised. Then there were discussions between the solicitors of the respective parties and agreement was reached between them. A document reflecting the agreement was prepared by the vendors` solicitors who sent six copies to the purchasers` solicitors. They were executed by the purchasers and returned to the vendors` solicitors. The purchasers` solicitors stated in a letter that they were holding the deposit amount and would hand it over to the vendors` solicitors upon receipt of five copies of the agreement signed by the vendors. Eighteen days later, the vendors wrote stating that one of the administrators had refused to execute the agreement. The purchasers filed an action claiming specific performance or alternatively damages for breach of contract. The vendors asserted in response that no contract was concluded. The court decided that no contract had been concluded. The decision essentially turned on the stipulation that `a formal contract was to be drawn up and agreed upon`. The stipulation was a condition  precedent. The court decided thus even though the essential elements of the agreement had been agreed upon between the solicitors and were embodied in a document. Gill J enunciated the following important principles at p 173:The authorities would appear to support the view that even where there is nothing in the agreement to suggest that the parties contemplate that the subsequent contract shall contain any new or different terms, nevertheless if it appears that the parties do not intend to bind themselves contractually by the agreement but only by the subsequent contract if and when they should enter into it, there will be no contract. Moreover, if the reference to the execution of the subsequent contract is in words which according to their natural construction import a condition, this will almost invariably be conclusive that the agreement itself was not intended to be a contract. To my mind this was true of this case. It will bear repetition if I say that when the actual phrase \"subject to contract\" is used, the courts tend to give effect to those words unless there is strong evidence to the contrary. The result is that the agreement which is made \"subject to contract\" is of no legal effect. Perhaps I should add that the plaintiffs in this case are asking the court to order the defendants to execute the draft agreement agreed upon, which amounts in effect to asking the court to enforce an agreement to enter into an agreement. That is an order which the court clearly has no power to make in the circumstances of the case.The judge went on to add this:In the result I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that there was no concluded contract between the parties to this action. I say \"reluctantly\" because of the conduct of the defendants in breaking off the negotiations when the terms of the proposed agreement were agreed upon and in capriciously refusing to sign the agreement. However, in the words of Tomlin J. inLockett v. Norman Wright, supra, \"it is no part of my duty to pronounce whether or not the conduct of any of the parties concerned in this matter is open to censure. All I have to do is to determine whether there is or is not a concluded contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants which the plaintiffs can enforce\".The law with regard to a commercial contract between hardnosed businessmen is that, save in extreme cases, the court must not rewrite what the parties have agreed simply by relying on the court`s notions of unreasonable or unconscionable conduct. To do so would undermine certainty and security in the law of contract.Authorities abound to establish this principle. Save exceptions excepted, the expression `subject to contract` means that unless and until a formal written contract has been executed and exchanged by the parties there is no binding and enforceable contract between them. That is so even if the parties are in agreement as to all the terms.Parties who contract on the basis of `subject to contract` do so because they want an escape route in case they wish to call the transaction off. They do not consider it a wrong way of business. It is a last chance escape route in case they find it impossible or undesirable to fulfil the contract.In this case, cl (j) was in effect a `subject to contract` provision. The words `on or before the commencement of tenancy` made it clear that the execution of the lease agreement was a condition precedent to the tenancy coming into being. Accordingly, I would follow Gill J inLow Kar Yit v Mohamed Isaand hold that there was no tenancy, as asserted by Yaohan. Accordingly, the claim for rent has no basis.",
        "Priority": "Finally, I come to the claim for priority. The claim for repairs had accrued well before the commencement of liquidation. In any event, it was not necessary for the liquidation and had nothing to do with liquidation. The judicial managers as such discharged all their liabilities before the order for winding up was made. They incurred no liability as liquidators vis-.-vis Thomson Plaza. Accordingly, there was no claim which qualified as a preferential claim. This applies to the other claims even if they had been held to be valid.Outcome:Application dismissed.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
