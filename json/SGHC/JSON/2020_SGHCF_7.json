        "Introduction": "1 This is an appeal by the Defendant (“Husband”) against the decision of the District Judge (“DJ”) in the Ancillary Matters (“AM”) hearing of the divorce proceedings between him and the Plaintiff (“Wife”). The appeal concerns four issues: care and control of, and access to, the two children to the marriage (“Children”); maintenance of the Children; maintenance of the Wife; and the division of the matrimonial home (“the Flat”) (seeUUU v UUV[2019] SGFC 37 (“GD”) at [1]).",
        "Background facts": "2 The parties were married in Singapore on 23 October 2010. The first child (“C1”) was born in March 2011, and the second child (“C2”) was born in November 2013. The parties lived in the house of the Husband’s parents from the start of their marriage until June 2013, at which point they moved to a rented flat in Ang Mo Kio. The parties stayed in the Ang Mo Kio flat until February 2015, when they moved into the Flat that they purchased. The parties lived together until the Wife moved out of the Flat with the Children on 5 May 2017. The Wife filed the Writ of Divorce on 20 July 2017, before returning to the Flat with the Children in August 2017. Interim Judgment (“IJ”) was granted on 9 January 2018, on the ground that both parties have behaved in such a way that the other party could not reasonably be expected to live with him/her. It brought to an end a marriage of about seven years. The AM hearing took place on 28 September 2018 and 13 November 2018, and the AM Order was made on 29 November 2018. 3 The Husband is 37 years old this year. He is a full-time safety instructor, but he also takes on part-time jobs as a private car hire driver and a bartender. The Wife is 31 years old, and she works as a personal assistant. C1 is nine years old and C2 is seven years old. 4 The Flat, a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat in Yishun, was purchased in August 2014 in the parties’ joint names.1Foot Note 1×Wife’s 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means dated 9 March 2018 (“W AOM1”) at p 48.There was a 5-year Minimum Occupancy Period (“MOP”) imposed on the Flat, which has expired in August 2019 (GD at [36]). 5 The Husband appealed against the following terms of the AM Order (see FC/ORC 6175/2018): (a) Care and control of the Children was granted to the Wife, and liberal access was granted to the Husband; (b) The Husband was to pay $800.00 per month, along with other education fees, for maintenance of the Children; (c) The Husband was to pay a nominal sum of $1.00 per month for maintenance of the Wife; (d) The Flat was to be divided in a 55:45 ratio between the Wife and the Husband; and (e) The Wife was given the first right to purchase the Husband’s share of the Flat. 6 Regarding the order set out in [5(e)], the Husband has successfully obtained a stay on the disposal of the Flat pending the determination of this appeal (see FC/ORC 1746/2019). As a result, the Husband and the Wife are still living together at the Property along with the Children.",
        "The appeal": "7 The Husband raised the following issues in this appeal:2Foot Note 2×Appellant’s Case (“HC”) at paras 10, 111. (a) The DJ erred in granting care and control of the Children to the Wife; (b) The DJ erred in ordering the Husband to pay $800.00 monthly plus disbursement for maintenance of the Children; (c) The DJ erred in ordering the Husband to pay nominal maintenance to the Wife; (d) The DJ erred in dividing the Flat in a 55:45 ratio between the Wife and the Husband; (e) The DJ erred in her valuation of the Flat. 8 Over the course of the appeal, the Wife filed HCF/SUM 118/2019 and the Husband filed HCF/SUM 145/2019 to seek to adduce further evidence. I have admitted the affidavits filed in both summonses for this appeal.3Foot Note 3×Minute Sheet 7 August 2019 at p 1. 9 I will deal with each of the issues raised by the Husband.",
        "Care and control of, and access to, the Children": "10 Under the AM Order, care and control of the Children was granted to the Wife and liberal access was granted to the Husband. The access terms include,inter alia, weekday access during the school term every Monday to Friday from after school to 9.00pm. 11 The Husband submitted that the AM Order should be amended to state that he be given the care and control of the Children, with no changes to the access arrangements made in the AM Order.4Foot Note 4×HC at para 56.In response, the Wife submitted that the AM Order should be amended to state that the Husband should only have weekday access on Monday and Friday (as opposed to Monday toFriday).5Foot Note 5×Respondent’s Case (“WC”) at para 80. 12 It is unclear whether the Husband wanted care and control to be given to him solely, or shared between him and the Wife. In any event, I am of the view that care and control should be given to the Wife solely. I am also inclined to amend the AM Order, such that the Husband is only given weekday access on Monday and Friday.",
        "Legal principles": "43 The principles concerning the grant of nominal maintenance have been comprehensively summarised by the Court of Appeal inTDT v TDS and another appealand another matter[2016] 4 SLR 145 (“TDT”). First, nominal maintenance is not awarded automatically or as a matter of course. Second, the court will not award nominal maintenance based on the wife’s bare assertion that her future situation may change. Third, the court must bear in mind the underlying rationale behind the grant of spousal maintenance, which is that of financial preservation (TDTat [71]).",
        "Application": "44 The DJ granted the Wife nominal maintenance until November 2020 so as to allow the Wife some time to stabilise her finances after the divorce (GD at [35]). In my view, there is no evidence to suggest that the Wife would need some time to stabilise her finances. In fact, her salary of $4,508.0046Foot Note 46×W AOM1 at para 9(d).is twice that of the Husband’s salary of $2,189.16,47Foot Note 47×H AOM1 at p 5.and the Husband is also helping her to support the Children by paying maintenance. In the circumstances, the Wife is capable of supporting herself financially and a grant of nominal maintenance would be unnecessary. 45 The Wife relied onTBV v TBW[2015] SGFC 44 (“TBV”) to support her position. InTBV, nominal maintenance was granted to the wife since she was the primary caregiver of two young children, and she was therefore entitled to seek financial support from the husband if there is a change in circumstances in the future which affects her income (at [19]). In my opinion, the reasoning inTBVcan no longer stand after the decision of the Court of Appeal inTDT, which held that a wife’s bare assertion of a change in future circumstances is insufficient. 46 I note that at the time of the appeal hearing in September 2019, the order for nominal maintenance was to last for only another year. In the circumstances, there would be minimal prejudice to the Wife if the nominal maintenance order be revoked. Further, a revocation of the nominal maintenance order would remove yet another possible source of conflict and reduce any further animosity between parties. 47 Accordingly, I amend the AM Order such that no maintenance is granted in favour of the Wife.",
        "Maintenance of the Children": "32 Under the AM Order, the Husband was to pay $800 per month for maintenance of the Children, plus reimbursement for the Children’s education and healthcare expenses. 33 The Husband submitted that if the Wife retain care and control of the Children, he should only be made to pay $400 per month plus disbursements, or a flat sum of $800 per month for maintenance.32Foot Note 32×Minute Sheet 15 October 2019 at p 5.The Wife submitted that the Husband should be made to pay a flat sum of $1,500.00 for maintenance.33Foot Note 33×Minute Sheet 7 August 2019 at p 10. 34 Having considered the arguments and the evidence, I am of the view that the Husband should be made to pay a flat sum of $1,000.00 a month for maintenance of the Children all in.",
        "Maintenance of the Wife": "42 Under the AM Order, the Wife was granted nominal maintenance of $1 per month until November 2020. The Husband submitted that order for nominal maintenance should be rescinded. I accept the Husband’s position.",
        "Division of the Flat": "48 The Flat was the only matrimonial property divided between the parties. The parties agreed that the direct financial contributions ratio was 65:35 between the Husband and the Wife. They also agreed that equal weightage is to be given to the direct and indirect contributions.48Foot Note 48×Joint Summary of Information at p 11, S/No 1.The DJ found that the indirect contributions ratio was 30:70 between the Husband and the Wife, and arrived at a final division ratio of 47.5:52.5 between the Husband and the Wife which she rounded to 45:55 (GD at [45]). 49 The DJ also gave the Wife the first right of purchase over the Flat. Therefore, under the AM order, the Husband was to transfer his share of the Flat to the Wife in exchange for a refund to his Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) Ordinary Account of 45% of the net value of the Flat. The gross value of the Flat was the average between the purchase price of the Flat (at $371,500.00) and its surrender value (at $352,925.00).49Foot Note 49×Notes of Evidence for D3340/2017 at pp 23–24.The net value of the Flat was derived by deducting the outstanding housing loan of $257,479.73 from the gross value:50Foot Note 50×Notes of Evidence for D3340/2017 at pp 23–24. [($371,350.00 + S352,295.00) ÷ 2] - $257,479.00 = $104,732.77 ≈ $104,500.00. The Husband’s share of the Flat was therefore calculated at $47,000.00 (being $104,500.00 x 0.45). 50 On appeal, the Husband submitted that the gross valuation of the Flat should not be based on the surrender value, but instead on the Flat’s market value. He also submitted that he should be given a higher share of, as well as the first right of purchase over, the Flat. In response, the Wife submitted that she should be given a higher share of the Flat instead.",
        "Valuation of the Flat": "51 The Husband submitted that the date of valuation of the Flat should not be the AM date, but instead the appeal hearing date of 15 October 2019.51Foot Note 51×Husband’s Supplemental Submissions dated 8 October 2019 (“HSS1”) at para 9.The Husband’s concern was that the gross value of the Flat on the AM date would be its surrender value, since the MOP for the Flat has yet to expire then. Since the Flat’s surrender value was lower than its market value, he would thus be required to sell his share of the Flat to the Wife at a discount. This, according to the Husband, would result in a windfall to the Wife.52Foot Note 52×HSS1 at para 14. 52 To address the Husband’s arguments, I adopt a two-stage enquiry: (a) First, should the date of valuation of the flat be the AM date or the appeal hearing date? (b) Second, if the AM date is adopted, should the gross valuation of the Flat be based on the surrender value? 53 On the first question, I do not accept the Husband’s position. My attention was directed to the case ofATT v ATS[2012] 2 SLR 859 (“ATT”), which dealt with a situation similar to the present case. InATT, the AM order entailed a “property swap” where the disputed property was given to the wife and other properties were given to the husband. After the husband filed his Notice of Appeal, the disputed property was sold as part of anenblocsale for about $1m above its valuation at the time of the AM hearing. The Court of Appeal was of the view that a change in value of an asset between the AM order and the final appeal will not, without more, be sufficient (at [25]). The Court of Appeal’s reasoning merits being set out in full: …. This begged the question as to whether such a subsequent change in the value of a matrimonial asset couldipso factoconstitute a ground for a successful appeal. … If the “property swap” order made by the Judge in this case were held to be just and equitable and had been affirmed by us, we do not see any basis to review the division on account of subsequent changes in the valuation of the asset in question.Especially in a volatile market where prices do move up and down fairly rapidly, there should be certainty and finality. The party who, under the order on division of matrimonial assets, is given an immovable property would have to take it subject to all risks or vagaries of the market.Otherwise, it would only encourage relitigation at the appeal stage. Thus, unless there are special circumstances or compelling reasons, the mere change in value of an asset between the date of the ancillary orders and that of the hearing of the appeal per se should not be a ground to revisit the division made by the court below. [emphasis added in bold italics] 54 In my opinion, the case ofATTis not on all fours with our current case. InATT, theenblocsale of the disputed property (and therefore the subsequent change in value) was not foreseeable at the time of the AM hearing. In our case, however, the expiry of the Flat’s MOP was foreseeable at the time of the AM hearing. Therefore, if the change in value occasioned by the expiry of the Flat’s MOP can be dealt with by the DJ during the AM hearing, the concern about encouraging relitigation would not arise. 55 However, I am not convinced that the change in value occasioned by the expiry of the Flat’s MOP could have been satisfactorily dealt with by the DJ. There remains the concern of speculation,ie, making a valuation where there is insufficient information. In our case, it would be difficult for the DJ to make an estimation on 28 September 2018 about what the market value of the Flat would be when the MOP expires eleven months later. While the Husband can wait for the MOP to expire and then file an appeal to get a more accurate valuation of the Flat (which he did in this case), such an approach will once again engage the Court of Appeal’s concern with encouraging relitigation. 56 Accordingly, I find that the appropriate date of valuation should be the AM date. 57 On the second question, I am of the view that even if the AM date is chosen, the gross value of Flat should nevertheless be based on the market value of similar HDB properties in the vicinity, and not the Flat’s surrender value. I accept the Husband’s argument that a valuation based on the surrender value would result in a windfall to the Wife. I note that in the case ofAGD v AGF[2011] SGDC 293, the District Court preferred the surrender value over the market value as the latter was “[a speculation] on what the value of the [property] might be when it is eligible for sale” (at [17]). However, in my view, the surrender value is just as much of a speculation on the Flat’s value when it is eligible for sale. The surrender value would only be an accurate estimate of the Flat’s value if it was actually surrendered to the HDB, which is unlikely to be the case. Therefore, the market value of HDB properties similar to the Flat is to be preferred to the Flat’s surrender value, the former being a more accurate indication of the real worth of the Flat. 58 I note that there is no evidence on the market value of HDB properties similar to the Flat on the AM date of 28 September 2018. In the circumstances, I direct the parties to obtain further evidence of such property for the purposes of deriving the gross value of the Flat, and to agree on its valuation. The valuations obtained by the parties were not based on the AM date of 28 September 2018, and thus may not be appropriate.",
        "The appropriate division ratio": "59 While only the Husband has appealed against the DJ’s orders on the division of the Flat, both parties have submitted on the DJ’s finding that the indirect contributions ratio was 30:70 between the Husband and the Wife. 60 I begin by addressing the arguments raised by the Wife. First, she argued that the Husband should be awarded negative indirect contributions for his attempt at poisoning the Wife’s mother.53Foot Note 53×WA 118 at para 41.It was not conclusively proven that the Wife’s mother was poisoned, or that the Husband was the culprit. Therefore, I do not give weight to this argument in arriving at the indirect contributions ratio. 61 Second, the Wife also claimed that the Husband has deliberately caused injury to her and the Children,54Foot Note 54×WA 118 at para 41.and damaged her personal property.55Foot Note 55×WA 118 at para 43–46.Given that the Wife only furnished evidence of the injury and damage done, but not of the person who inflicted such injury and damage, I am again not able to conclude that the Husband was responsible. 62 Last, she argued that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband for his failure to disclose two insurance policies in favour of the Children56Foot Note 56×WA 118 at para 5.and his receipt of the Baby Bonus cash gifts totalling at $10,000.00.57Foot Note 57×WA 118 at paras 9–10.In my view, the Baby Bonus cash gifts were paid out between 2011 and 2014,58Foot Note 58×WA 118 at pp 30, 33.which means that these sums are likely already spent. As for the insurance policies, I note that the assured under the policies are the Children.59Foot Note 59×WA 118 at pp 28–29.However, there were no indication on who the beneficiaries under the policies were. In the circumstances, I am not inclined to find that the policies were for the Husband’s benefit. Accordingly, I decline to draw any adverse inference against the Husband. 63 I turn to address the Husband’s arguments. His case on appeal was that he was the primary caretaker of the Children, and thus the indirect contributions ratio should be more in his favour.60Foot Note 60×HC at paras 101–102.Once again, I accept that the Husband has played an important part in the Children’s upbringing; but as I have found in [18]–[19] above, the Wife was the primary caretaker of the Children. 64 Further, while the Husband footed the bill for at least half of the rent of the Ang Mo Kio flat,61Foot Note 61×H AOM1 at para 19(c); W AOM2 at para 17.and half the cost of furniture and electronic equipment in the Flat,62Foot Note 62×H AOM1 at para 19(d); W AOM2 at para 18.he made no attempt63Foot Note 63×H AOM3 at pp 6–7.to refute the Wife’s claim that she was responsible for most of the Children’s childcare fees, utilities and groceries.64Foot Note 64×W AOM2 at para 26–34.In the circumstances, I am not minded to interfere with the exercise of the DJ’s discretion in arriving at an indirect contributions ratio of 30:70 between the Husband and the Wife. 65 For completeness, the Husband also argued that the parties’ direct contributions should be given higher weight, since this was a short marriage.65Foot Note 65×HC at para 78.In my view, the duration of the marriage at seven years is not short. Further, given that there were children from the marriage, the indirect contributions made by the parties in raising the Children would have been significant. 66 In sum, the direct contributions ratio and indirect contributions ratio would be 65:35 and 30:70, respectively, between the Husband and the Wife. There is also nothing on the evidence to compel me to depart from the general position of attributing equal weightage to direct and indirect contributions. I note that the DJ has rounded the division ratio without expressly providing a reason why (GD at [44]–[45]). In my view, it is not necessary to make any further adjustments to the division ratio. Therefore, I arrive at a final division ratio of 47.5:52.5 between the Husband and the Wife.",
        "Apportionment of the Flat": "67 With regard to the apportionment of the Flat, I am not inclined to intervene with the DJ’s decision. In my opinion, she was justified in granting the Wife the first right of purchase over the Flat, since this would result in minimal disruption of the Children’s lives. This would be based on the valuation of the Flat obtained in accordance with [58] above. 68 I also address the issue of who should bear the mortgage payments on the Flat after the AM Order was issued. I am guided by the Court of Appeal authority ofTIC v TID[2019] 1 SLR 180, which stated at [24(b)] that when a spouse has been given the option of buying the other spouse’s share in a matrimonial property, the eventual owner of the property should be responsible for the mortgage payments made between the date of the AM Order and the date of completion.  Accordingly, the Wife should be responsible for the mortgage payments on the Flat for the period after the date of the AM Order,ie,December 2018. The Wife should thus refund the Husband $7,326.00 (being $603.00 x 12 months from December 2018 to November 2019). As the Husband has not made mortgage payments for December 2019 and January 2020, the Wife should simply pay this amount. While there is a $3.80 late payment charge arising from the Husband’s non-payment of the mortgage loan on December 2019 and January 2020, this charge is in my viewde minimis. It would engender less acrimony if the Wife simply pay off this minimal sum. 69 I also note that the Wife has obtained a new mortgage loan on the basis that the Flat’s surrender value would be used, and that a re-evaluation of the Flat’s value would force her to cancel this mortgage loan and suffer a loss of $4,455.00 in cancellation fees.66Foot Note 66×Wife’s Supplemental Submissions dated 8 October 2019 at para 22.It is unfortunate that the Wife will have to suffer this loss, but in my view there is no basis to make the Husband liable for this cancellation fee.",
        "Conclusion": "70 In conclusion, para 1.3.i of the AM Order is varied such that the Husband’s weekday access during the school term would be every Monday and Friday from after school to 9.00pm. The remainder of the AM Order dealing with access on weekends, birthdays, school and public holidays is to remain. Para 2.1 of the AM Order is also varied such that the Husband is to pay the Wife a flat monthly sum of $1,000.00 monthly for maintenance of the Children. Further, para 3 of the AM Order is rescinded, so that the Husband no longer has to pay the Wife a monthly nominal maintenance of $1.00. Para 5.1 of the AM Order is likewise varied such that the Flat is divided in the ratio of 52.5:47.5 between the Wife and the Husband. 71 In the event that parties are unable to agree on the valuation of the Flat in accordance with [58] above, they are to furnish evidence on the market value on the AM date of similar HDB properties in the vicinity of the Flat within four weeks of this judgment for the valuation to be determined by the court. 72 The parties are to file and exchange their submissions on costs, limited to ten pages (excluding list of disbursements, exhibits and authorities) within four weeks of this judgment, and to inform the Registry if they are prepared to receive the order on costs by way of Registrar’s Notice. Tan Puay BoonJudicial Commissioner Alyssa G Mundo (M/s Yeo & Associates LLC) for the Appellant;Steffi Huang Yujia (M/s Kalco Law LLC) for the Respondent."
