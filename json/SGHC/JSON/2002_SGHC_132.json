        "TRIAL JUDGES DECISION": "14.    The trial judge, District Judge Tan Peck Cheng, decided that\n\nCyberinc was in breach of contract and there was no acquiescence by Datawork. However she also\n\nconcluded that Clause 5 requiring Cyberinc to re-purchase the products from Datawork did not apply\n\nbecause it was not Cyberinc who terminated the Distributorship Agreement but Datawork and the\n\nprovision applied only in the former, but not the latter, situation.15.    The trial judge also decided that Datawork suffered only\n\nnominal damages as its sales of the products were not doing well in any event.16.    Accordingly, the trial judge fixed the damages for Cyberincs\n\nbreach at S$2,500 to be paid by Cyberinc to Datawork and dismissed the other reliefs sought by\n\nDatawork. She also granted judgment against Datawork to pay Cyberinc the purchase price of the 400\n\nunits delivered but not yet paid for. The rest of the reliefs sought by Cyberinc were disallowed.\n\nDatawork was required to pay costs to Cyberinc which the trial judge fixed at S$18,000.",
        "THE APPEALS": "17.    Datawork appealed to the High Court against that part of the\n\ntrial judges decision which:(a) ordered payment of only $2,500 to Datawork as damages,(b) dismissed the other reliefs sought by Datawork,(c) granted Cyberinc judgment for the purchase price of the 400\n\n  units, and(d) costs.18.    Cyberinc also appealed to the High Court. Its appeal was\n\nagainst that part of the decision which:(a) ordered Cyberinc to pay $2,500 as damages to Datawork,(b) disallowed the rest of the reliefs sought by Cyberinc, and(c) the quantum of costs fixed by the trial judge.",
        "MY DECISION": "19.    Both appeals were heard by me on 13 May 2002. After hearing\n\narguments, I dismissed the appeal by Datawork and allowed the appeal by Cyberinc in part (because\n\nCyberincs computation of the balance number of units to make up the minimum quantity was\n\nincorrect). My decision meant that:(a) Cyberinc was not in breach of contract and did not have to\n\n  pay any damages to Datawork.(b) Cyberinc was still entitled to be paid for the 400 units\n\n  delivered to Datawork (an earlier batch of 300 units had been delivered and paid for already).(c) Cyberinc was entitled to damages to be assessed in respect\n\n  of 600 units which Datawork had ordered but did not want delivery of.(d) Cyberinc was entitled to damages to be assessed for Dataworks\n\n  failure to order 1,700 sets to make up the minimum quantity of 3,000 units.20.    I also granted costs of Cyberincs appeal and of the\n\nhearing below to Cyberinc and costs of Dataworks appeal to Cyberinc.",
        "MY REASONS": "21.    Although much time and effort was spent by both Counsel for\n\nDatawork and Cyberinc on arguments as to whether TV Media was or was not a distributor of Cyberinc\n\nand the interpretation of Clause 5, I decided the appeals on the ground that Datawork was estopped\n\nfrom alleging that Cyberinc was in breach of contract. Datawork had also acquiesced in the\n\nappointment of TV Media by Cyberinc to promote and sell the products.22.    On this issue, the trial judge had ruled against Cyberinc. I\n\nset out below the reasons why I reached the opposite conclusion.23.    Mr Tan Peng Khoon (PK Tan) had joined Cyberinc in\n\nSeptember 1999. He was its Marketing Director. The managing director was Mr Ng Kai Kong (KK Ng).24.    Datawork is run by PK Tans sister Lucillia Tan Sok Cheng,\n\nalso referred to as SC Ang, and their brother Larry Tan. It was PK Tan who introduced Datawork to\n\nCyberinc as his sisters company. At all material times, all parties were aware of PK Tans\n\nrelationship with SC Ang.25.    Consequently the Distributorship Agreement was entered into.26.    SC Ang did not dispute that she was aware of Cyberincs\n\nintention to use TV Media to promote and sell the products. Indeed, she learned of this from a\n\nmeeting with KK Ng and her brother PK Tan. However she claimed that she had thought that TV Media\n\nwould be buying the products from Datawork and not from Cyberinc.27.    In her Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (AEIC), she said\n\nat paras 32 and 33:32. Sometime in or around the 2ndor 3rdweek of September 2000, KK Ng and my brother came to the Plaintiffs    offices\n\n  to discuss advertising the Defendants products on television. They informed me that the\n\n  Defendant was          intending to advertise on\n\n  television through TV Media . He gave me the impression that TV Media would\n\n  be          producing the advertisements and selling\n\n  the Defendants products at their retail outlets as well as through mail\n\n  order     and that any sales by TV Media would be made from stock purchased\n\n  from the Plaintiff. In effect, the\n\n  impression          which he gave me was that TV\n\n  Media would purchase its stock from the Plaintiff directly. Given the practice in\n\n  the        previous marketing efforts outlined above and our\n\n  understanding of both parties obligations under the\n\n  Distribution         Agreement, I naturally assumed that\n\n  this would continue to be the case.33. I was therefore quite pleased when I heard the news from KK\n\n  Ng and my brother as I believed that our sales        \n\n  would improve after the advertisements. I had no reason to object to the advertisements as I\n\n  understood that the           terms of the\n\n  Distribution Agreement would be adhered to by the Defendant.28.    KK Ngs evidence on this point was in para 42 of his AEIC\n\nwhere he said:42. Thus, sometime in August 2000, PK, SC Ang and I had a\n\n  meeting to discuss advertising through TV Media.  I recall that SC Ang was pleased to hear\n\n  about the advertisement. She felt that any efforts to promote the product would be worth trying.\n\n  She also expressed the view that if the product was put into the\n\n  market,albeit by the Defendant, it would still\n\n  increase awareness of the product and possibly boost the Plaintiffs         \n\n  own sales of the product.[Emphasis added.]29.    In cross-examination, KK Ng accepted that he did not know\n\nwhether SC Ang was aware that Cyberinc was selling the products directly to TV Media (NE 189). At NE\n\n190, he also said:Q: Because she does not know TV Media getting (sic) for\n\n  defendantA: That is possible but not 100% sure.30.    PK Tan did not have an AEIC. He gave evidence for Datawork,\n\nand not Cyberinc which he had by then left. He said that SC Ang was told that TV Media was being\n\nused to help promote her sales (NE 72). He claimed that Cyberinc did not tell Datawork that it would\n\nbe selling the products directly to TV Media. If it had told Datawork, Datawork would have jumped\n\n(NE 74). He was the one who had negotiated with TV Media on behalf of Cyberinc and who signed the\n\nagreement with TV Media but he claimed that the agreement with TV Media was a breach by Cyberinc of\n\nthe Distributorship Agreement. He alleged that he did not protest to KK Ng because of fear over his\n\nown salary (NE 102).31.    The trial judges conclusion was as follows:21. . With regard to paragraph 20(a), Mr K K Ngs\n\n  evidence was that he did not tell Mdm Lucilla Tan (\"Mrs S C Ang\") that TV Media would be\n\n  purchasing the products directly from the defendant or showed Mrs S C Ang the agreement with TV\n\n  Media. He was not sure if Mrs S C Ang was aware. He assumed that the plaintiff must have known. He\n\n  was asked if it was reasonable for Mrs S C Ang to assume that TV Media would obtain the products\n\n  from her, he replied that it was. Mrs S C Ang in her evidence stated that she knew that the\n\n  defendant was speaking to TV Media. She was pleased because she assumed that TV Media would be\n\n  buying from her. I found Mrs S C Angs evidence credible and that there is no evidence to show\n\n  that the plaintiff had acquiesced to the relationship between the defendant and TV Media.32.    I found it difficult to accept that PK Tan had thought that\n\nwhat Cyberinc was doing was in breach of the Distributorship Agreement and that he went ahead to\n\nnegotiate and sign the agreement on behalf of Cyberinc with TV Media without even attempting to\n\nadvise KK Ng that this would cause a breach of the Distributorship Agreement or informing his own\n\nsister, whom he had introduced to Cyberinc, about the true situation. After all, there was no\n\nevidence that KK Ng was trying to hide the truth about the sales from Cyberinc to TV Media and, in\n\nany event, he would have been foolish to think that he could get away with it given that he knew PK\n\nTans relationship with SC Ang.33.    Secondly, KK Ng did not say that it was reasonable for SC\n\nAng to assume that TV Media would obtain the products from Datawork. All he said was that it was\n\npossible that she had this assumption but he was not 100% sure (see NE 190 which I cited in para 29\n\nabove). In any event, even if KK Ng had said what was attributed to him by the trial judge, that\n\nwould have been merely an opinion of his and not evidence of a fact which he had personal knowledge\n\nof.34.    Thirdly, and most importantly, the evidence of SC Ang as to\n\nwhen she first came to know that TV Media was obtaining the products directly from Cyberinc was\n\nhighly improbable and was also contradicted by documentary evidence. I elaborate below.35.    In SC Angs AEIC, paras 34 to 35, she said:34. On 24 September 2000, I saw the advertisement screened by\n\n  TV Media on television for the first time. I clearly    recall that the\n\n  advertisement stated that the Defendants products were being sold through the retail\n\n  outlets              \n\n  operated by TV Media. No mention was made of the Plaintiff or its authorised dealers.35.I expected TV Media to contact the Plaintiff shortly\n\n  after the advertisement was screened. As explained previously, I had been given the impression\n\n  that we would be supplying TV Media with the Defendants products which\n\n  TV          Media managed to sell. However, nothing\n\n  was heard from TV Media even after the advertisement was screened. I     \n\n  made several unsuccessful attempts to contact KK Ng and PK Tan to ask for an explanation.Finally,\n\n  PK Tan          returned my calls sometime towards\n\n  the end of September 2000. It was onlythenthat he informed me that\n\n  the          Defendant had been selling directly to\n\n  TV Media and by passing the Plaintiff.[Emphasis added.]",
        "First sub-point": "36.    It was common ground that SC Ang had considerable experience\n\nin her business. Yet, when she learned that TV Media would be appointed, she did not ask KK Ng or PK\n\nTan as to when she should contact TV Media or when TV Media would be contacting Datawork to order\n\nthe products from Datawork. There was also no query by her about the volume and timing of the\n\npurchases by TV Media from Datawork which would in turn affect the volume and timing of purchases by\n\nDatawork from Cyberinc. I found this lack of interest telling. It suggested that she must have known\n\nall along that TV Media were obtaining the products directly from Cyberinc.",
        "Second sub-point": "37.    I found it incredulous that SC Ang could have been under the\n\nimpression that TV Media would be contacting Datawork shortly after she noticed an advertisement by\n\nTV Media on television on 24 September 2000. The advertising campaign had already begun. The public\n\nwere being urged to buy from TV Media. There was no suggestion that the public were told that the\n\nproducts would be on sale only in the future. Therefore the advertisements would suggest that the\n\nproducts were immediately available from TV Media. It was quite absurd for SC Ang to suggest that\n\nwhile the public were going to TV Medias outlets to buy the products, TV Media would not have the\n\nproducts and had still not contacted her to obtain the products. Indeed, by then, there was still no\n\ndiscussion between TV Media and Datawork even on the price which TV Media was supposed to pay for\n\nthe products from Datawork. How then would TV Media know what price to adopt for its sales to the\n\npublic?",
        "Third sub-point": "38.    SC Angs assertion that she had assumed that TV Media\n\nwould be contacting Datawork shortly after the advertisement to obtain the products was contradicted\n\nby a second e-mail from her on 5 October 2000, there being two e-mail from her on that day.39.    For completeness, I set out below the first e-mail she sent\n\non 5 October 2000 at 10:58am and the second e-mail she sent on the same day at 2:44pm.First e-mailSubject: Fw: Promotion partnershipDear PK and KK,I shall be writing to you by today the problems that we are\n\n  currently facing in the distribution of Z-station and our decision to settle these problems.In spite of this, I would like to bring to your attention the\n\n  opportunity that CyberInc can work with this company, Field Catering & Supplies Pte Ltd, a\n\n  $500,000 paid up capital company. They have already bought 4 sets of Z-station, normal version\n\n  from us at $257.50/= each and tested it. Now, they are coming back to us on this proposal which I\n\n  think is a good opportunity to create the awareness but of course with modifications and\n\n  monitoring from your side. Gerard Lim is the brand manager. His HP: 9 7506305. His tel: 759 1771.\n\n  If you are contacting him directly to discuss the matter, please let me know so that I would know\n\n  how to talk to him if he called me.Bye.S.C.AngDatawork Pte LtdSecond e-mailSubject: Termination of sole distributorship of Z-station in\n\n  SingaporeDear KK & PKOn 24thSeptember 2000, TV Media Pte Ltd has begun\n\n  the screening of its advertisement of Z-station on TCS - channel 5. Thismeantthat\n\n  Cyberinc would have sold the Z-station to themmuch earlier on. This in turn meant that\n\n  Cyberinc has broken one of the major clauses in the letter of understanding. Under the term\n\n  duration of sole distributorship and quantity commitment of the letter of understanding, it stated\n\n  the sole distributorship will be for a minimum period of seven months beginning from the date of\n\n  first receipt of the stock of Z-station from Cyberinc which is 30thMarch 2000. The\n\n  exclusive period should only expire on 29-10-2000. This demonstrated the fact that Cyberinc has\n\n  decided to terminate the sole distributorship agreement.Under number 5 of the list of things that Cyber Inc Pte Ltd must\n\n  do as stated in the letter of understanding is as follows: in the event that CyberInc Pte Ltd\n\n  decides to early terminate the sole distributorship agreement with Datawork Pte Ltd, it will have\n\n  to buy up all the remaining stock of the product from Datawork Pte Ltd and its dealers (If\n\n  Datawork Pte Ltd deems necessary) at the same price Datawork Pte Ltd has paid to CyberInc Pte Ltd.We have thought about the past few months business relationship\n\n  with your company and the above-mentioned clause, we have decided to exercise it, i.e to demand\n\n  CyberInc Pte Ltd to buy up the remaining stock of Datawork and its dealers. However if CyberInc\n\n  would like to continue to sell to the dealers, Datawork, with the consent of the dealers, will go\n\n  with CyberInc to visit the dealers to expedite the taking over of dealers.We look forward to (sic) letting us know when we can\n\n  return the products to your company and also about your decision with regards to the dealers.\n\n  Thank you.Yours truly,S.C.AngDatawork Pte Ltd[Emphasis added.]40.    The second e-mail from SC Ang clearly stated that when TV\n\nMedia had begun to screen the advertisement, Thismeantthat Cyberinc would have sold the\n\nZ-station to themmuch earlier on[my emphasis]. This was a logical assertion but it\n\ncontradicted what SC Ang had said in her AEIC.41.    Mr David Chan, Counsel for Datawork, submitted that this\n\nsentence in the second e-mail was the result of SC Angs subsequent telephone discussion with PK\n\nTan in which PK Tan informed her that Cyberinc had been selling direct to TV Media and by-passing\n\nDatawork. However, the second e-mail did not attribute this knowledge to any telephone discussion\n\nwith PK Tan. On the contrary, the second e-mail attributed this knowledge to logic and there was no\n\nmention of any recent telephone discussion with PK Tan.",
        "Fourth sub-point": "42.    The first e-mail from SC Ang on 5 October 2000 to PK Tan and\n\nKK Ng was also revealing. It reinforced a point made by Ms Valerie Tan, Counsel for Cyberinc, that\n\nDatawork was having difficulty in effecting sales of the products and was looking for a way out.43.    The first e-mail suggested that Datawork was going to make a\n\nproposal and there was no hint therein that Datawork had thought that Cyberinc was in breach of\n\ncontract even though, by then, 10 to 11 days had lapsed after SC Ang had first noticed the\n\nadvertisement of TV Media on 24 September 2000 and TV Media had not contacted Datawork to make\n\npurchases.44.    About 3 hours later, the substance and tone of the second\n\ne-mail was significantly different. The heading of the second e-mail was also different from the\n\nfirst. The second e-mail was not the anticipated follow-up from the first. In my view, Datawork had\n\nby then changed its mind and decided to use the sale by TV Media as an excuse to get out of the\n\nDistributorship Agreement and to require Cyberinc to re-purchase the products in the possession of\n\nDatawork and its dealers.",
        "Summary": "45.    With respect, the trial judge did not consider the points I\n\nhave mentioned above and the two e-mail from SC Ang of 5 October 2000. In my view, her conclusion\n\nwas plainly wrong.46.    In the circumstances, it was clear to me that SC Ang and\n\nDatawork were aware and had acquiesced in TV Medias involvement in the promotion of the products\n\nas well as the purchase thereof from Cyberinc. They were even enthusiastic about the involvement of\n\nTV Media as they had thought that this would give a boost to their own flagging sales. Datawork was\n\nalso estopped from alleging a breach of contract arising from the sales of the products by Cyberinc\n\nto TV Media.",
        "SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS - SUMMONS-IN-CHAMBERS NO 600900 OF 2002": "47.    Subsequent to my decision, Datawork sought to appeal against\n\nmy decision.48.    Section 34(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap\n\n322) (SCJA) states:(2) Except with the leave of the Court of Appeal or a Judge,\n\n  no appeal shall be brought to the Court of Appeal in any of the following cases:(a) where the amount\n\n  or value of the subject-matter at the trial is $250,00049.    It was common ground that the jurisdiction of the District\n\nCourt is $250,000 and that this figure was inserted as an amendment in the SCJA to meet the increase\n\nin the jurisdiction of the District Court to $250,000.50.    In view of s 34(2), Datawork applied for leave to appeal\n\nagainst my decision to the Court of Appeal by way of Summons-in-Chambers No 600900 of 2002. However,\n\nat the first hearing of this application on 31 May 2002, Mr Vinodh Coomaraswamy, who was appearing\n\nwith Mr David Chan for Datawork, made an oral application for a declaration that no leave was\n\nnecessary. However, if leave was necessary, then, he would seek leave to appeal. As this oral\n\napplication took his opponent by surprise, I adjourned the application to a date to be fixed.51.    At the next hearing on 12 June 2002, Mr Coomaraswamy\n\nproceeded with both points. After hearing arguments, I decided that leave was required but that no\n\nsuch leave should be granted. Accordingly, I dismissed the application with costs.",
        "ARGUMENTS FOR DATAWORK": "52.    As I have mentioned, Mr Coomaraswamys first position was\n\nthat no leave was required under s 34(2) SCJA. He mounted his argument in the following manner.53.    In Dataworks claim, it was seeking:(a) a declaration that Cyberinc was obliged to purchase the\n\n  unsold products held by Datawork and its dealers    pursuant to the Clause 5 which\n\n  I have mentioned(b) an order that\n\nCyberinc pay US$32,819 for the purchase under Clause 5(c) alternatively,\n\ndamages for loss suffered as a result of Cyberincs breach of the Distributorship Agreement.54.    In Cyberincs counterclaim, it was seeking:(a) US$58,318.60 being the price of the 400 units of Z-pac which\n\n  had been delivered to Datawork but had remained unpaid(b) damages for\n\nDataworks failure to purchase 1,000 units of Z-pac within the first three months(c) damages for\n\nDataworks failure to order the minimum quantity of 3,000 units.55.    Cyberinc had alleged that its damages exceeded S$250,000 but\n\nas its counterclaim was filed in the District Court and not in the High Court, the District Court\n\nwould not grant it judgment and the assessment would not be for a sum which would exceed $250,000,\n\nafter taking into account the US$58,318.60.56.    Mr Coomaraswamy submitted that as Cyberincs damages had\n\nnot yet been assessed, I should adopt the maximum amount under the District Court jurisdiction as\n\nthe putative amount of its damages, including the US$58,318.60. Taking the difference between this\n\nmaximum amount i.e S$250,000 on the one hand and the US$32,819 which Datawork itself was claiming on\n\nthe other hand, the resultant figure would be in excess of S$250,000. This was the value of the\n\nsubject matter for the purpose of s 34(2)(a) and, therefore, no leave to appeal was required.57.    Mr Coomaraswamy relied on 2 cases,Augustine & anor v\n\nGoh Siam Yong[1992] 1 SLR 767and the Malaysian case ofYai Yen Hon v Teng Ah Kok & Sim\n\nHuat Sdn Bhd[1997] 1 MLJ 136.58.    In theAugustinecase, the respondent commenced an\n\naction in the Magistrates Court to recover damages in respect of a traffic accident. The\n\nappellants did not enter an appearance and the respondent obtained interlocutory judgment with\n\ndamages to be assessed. Such damages were assessed by a deputy registrar of the subordinate courts\n\nat $4,780.89. The appellants appealed to a district judge-in-chambers who reduced the damages to\n\n$1,177.50. The respondent filed a notice of appeal to the High Court against the reduced assessment.59.    The appellants applied to strike out the notice of appeal on\n\nthe ground that under O 55 r 1(5) of the Subordinate Courts Rules 1986, the respondent had no right\n\nof appeal. This application was heard by the Deputy Registrar of the High Court who made no order on\n\nthe application so as to allow the respondent to apply to a judge of the High Court for a\n\ndeclaration that she had such a right of appeal. After hearing arguments, that declaration was made\n\nand the appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal against that declaration.60.    The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal because O 55 r 1(5)\n\nwas ultra vives the then s 21 SCJA. The arguments and the ruling on the effect of the then s 21 SCJA\n\non O 55 r 1(5) were not relevant to the case before me. However, one of the arguments raised by the\n\nappellants in that case was that the respondent would in any event require leave to appeal under the\n\nthen s 21(1) SCJA. That provision stated:(1) Subject to the provisions of this or any other written\n\n  law, an appeal shall lie to the High Court from a decision of a  District Court or Magistrates\n\n  Court in any suit or action for the recovery of immovable property or in any\n\n  civil           cause or matter where the amount\n\n  in dispute or the value of the subject matter exceeds $2,000 or with the leave\n\n  of      the High Court if under that amount.The appellants there contended that since the district\n\njudge-in-chambers had reduced the damages to $1,177.50, that was the amount in dispute. The\n\nCourt of Appeal disagreed with that contention and held that as the respondent was disputing the\n\nreduction in the original order made by the deputy registrar, the amount in dispute was the\n\ndifference between the $4,780.89 assessed by the deputy registrar and the $1,177.50 allowed by the\n\ndistrict judge i.e $3,603.39.61.    However the facts in that case were different from those\n\nbefore me. First, the provisions were different, i.e one pertained to the then s 21(1) SCJA while\n\nthe present case pertained to the current s 34(2)(a) SCJA which was a different provision.62.    Secondly, and more importantly, that was not a case\n\ninvolving a counterclaim as well.63.    As for the Malaysian case ofYai Yen Hon, that case\n\nwas one in which leave to appeal was required when the amount or value of the subject matter of\n\nthe claim was less than RM100,000. There, the plaintiffs claim was well in excess of RM100,000\n\nbut the High Court gave judgment to the plaintiff for RM62,400. The Federal Court held that whether\n\nor not there was a right of appeal depended on the value of the claim and not the amount given by\n\nthe trial judge.64.    As can be seen, the provision in that case was different and\n\nthe facts were also different. Again, there was no counterclaim there.65.    In addition, it seemed to me that despite Mr Coomaraswamys\n\nsubmission, his approach was not one in which the difference between what Datawork might obtain and\n\nwhat Cyberinc might obtain is taken. What he had done was to add the two together to derive a higher\n\nfigure in excess of $250,000.66.    As for the existence of the counterclaim, Mr Coomaraswamy\n\nsubmitted that even though there was a counterclaim by Cyberinc, this arose from the same facts and\n\nit was not possible to separate one from the other. He stressed that I should take into account the\n\nentire subject matter of the suit and not just the value of Dataworks claim. According to him,\n\nthe reference to a trial in s 34(2) SCJA includes a case where there is a claim and\n\ncounterclaim heard in one trial.67.    Mr Coomaraswamy further submitted that this was not a case\n\nin which Datawork might obtain judgment for US$32,819 on the one hand, and, on the other hand,\n\nCyberinc might obtain judgment for US$58,318.60 and damages so that the amount adjudged to Datawork\n\nwould effectively abate the amount adjudged to Cyberinc. It was like an all or nothing scenario.\n\nEither Datawork would obtain judgment for US$32,819 or Cyberinc would obtain judgment for\n\nUS$58,318.60 and damages. In his submission, this reinforced his argument that the difference\n\nbetween what Datawork might obtain and what Cyberinc might obtain was the amount or value of the\n\nsubject matter at the trial.68.    Mr Coomaraswamys alternative position was that if leave\n\nto appeal was required, then such leave ought to be granted to Datawork.69.    InLee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong[1997] 3 SLR 489,\n\nthe Court of Appeal considered whether leave to appeal should be granted in respect of an order of\n\ncosts under s 34(2)(b) SCJA. After referring to Justice Lai Kew Chais judgment inAnthony s/o\n\nSavarimiuthu v Soh Chuan Tin[1989] SLR 607, Chief Justice Yong Pung How enunciated three limbs\n\nto be considered when leave to appeal is sought:(a) prima facie case of error,(b) question of general principle decided for the first time,(c) question of importance upon which further argument and a\n\n  decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage.70.    Mr Coomaraswamy submitted that there was a prime facie case\n\nof error of law or an important question of law for the Court of Appeal to decide. It was not clear\n\nto me whether the latter was under the second or third limb enunciated by Yong CJ.71.    As regards the alleged important question of law, Mr\n\nCoomaraswamy submitted that it was important to establish how the High Court, sitting as an\n\nintermediate appellate court, should approach findings of fact by a District Court. According to\n\nhim, the High Court, as an appellate court, may be required to approach findings of facts\n\ndifferently from the Court of Appeal as the latter was the final appellate court. While the Court of\n\nAppeal can in certain situations find itself to be in as good a position as the trial judge to\n\ndetermine facts, Mr Coomaraswamy was suggesting that the High Court, sitting as an appellate court,\n\nshould be even slower to find itself in as good a position as the trial judge to determine facts. He\n\nsubmitted that while the precise test for the High Court was difficult to formulate, the High Court\n\nshould only reverse the finding of a trial judge if the finding was manifestly erroneous or in some\n\nway perverse. He emphasized that the High Courts intermediate role will become more important as\n\nthe jurisdiction of the District Court increases in future.72.    As regards the alleged error of law, Mr Coomaraswamy relied\n\non two local cases for the proposition that a trial judges finding of fact should not be\n\ndisturbed unless he was plainly wrong. They wereSeah Ting Soon v Indonesian Tractors Co Pte Ltd[2001] 1 SLR 521andPeh Eng Leng v Pek Eng Leong[1996] 2 SLR 305. However, that principle\n\nwas not in issue. Besides, in the case ofPeh Eng Leng, Karthigesu JA said that the evidence\n\nof a witness should be tested against inherent probabilities or improbabilities and against\n\nuncontroverted facts (see p 312 at H/I of the report). Mr Coomaraswamy did not dispute this\n\nprinciple but he submitted that the finding of the trial judge would stand up to scrutiny even when\n\nso tested.73.    He also relied on a decision of the Australian High Court inBaumgartner v Baumgartner76 ALR 75 for the proposition that it was not legitimate for an\n\nappellate court to ignore the resolution of conflicting evidence by a trial judge and to draw\n\ninferences from the surrounding area of common ground only.",
        "ARGUMENTS FOR CYBERINC": "74.    Ms Tan submitted that as regards the issue whether leave to\n\nappeal was required, Dataworks own application was initially for leave to be granted.75.    Secondly, she relied on s 9A (1) Interpretation Act (Cap 1)\n\nwhich provides that:9A. (1) In the interpretation of a provision of a written\n\n  law, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law\n\n  (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred\n\n  to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.76.    Thirdly, under s 9A(3), a speech made in Parliament by a\n\nMinister on the occasion of the moving of a Bill and any relevant material in any official record of\n\ndebates in Parliament could be considered in the interpretation of a provision of written law.77.    She then referred to the speech of the Minister of Law on s\n\n34(2)(a) as cited in the judgment of L P Thean JA inSpandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Yong\n\nQiang Construction[1999] 4 SLR 401and Thean JAs summary of the purpose of s 34(2)(a):15 Prior to the amendments made by the Supreme Court of\n\n  Judicature (Amendment) Act 1998, s 34(2) read as follows:(2) Except with the leave of the Court of Appeal or a Judge, no\n\n  appeal shall be brought to the Court of Appeal in any   of the following cases:(a) where the amount\n\n  or value of the subject-matter at the trial is $30,000 or less;The amending Act of 1998 amended para (a) by deleting the sum of\n\n  $30,000 and substituting therefor the words $250,000 or such other amount as may be\n\n  specified by an order made under subsection (3). All that the amendment did was to increase the\n\n  monetary limit from $30,000 to $250,000 and no other changes were made. However, the underlying\n\n  purpose of this amendment was to bring it in line with the jurisdiction of the District Court. The\n\n  jurisdiction of the District Court had as from 1 August 1997, been increased to $250,000 and the\n\n  amendment made to s 34(2)(a) in 1998 was to bring it in line with the increased jurisdiction of\n\n  the District Court and to allow an appeal to be brought to this court only where leave to appeal\n\n  is obtained from this court or a judge of the High Court. This was evident from the speech of the\n\n  Minister for Law, Professor Jayakumar, when he moved the Second Reading of the Supreme Court of\n\n  Judicature (Amendment) Bill on 26 November 1998. He said:On 1 August 1997, the District Courts jurisdiction in civil\n\n    matters was raised from $100,000 to $250,000  In view of the enhanced District Courts\n\n    jurisdiction to $250,000 in civil matters, the Chief Justice has proposed that the existing\n\n    $30,000 limit in s 34(2)(a) be raised to $250,000. In other words, bring its limit in line with\n\n    the enhancement. If the limit is not raised to $250,000, District Court cases of less than\n\n    $250,000 can first go on appeal to the High Court and then Court of Appeal. This would strain\n\n    the limited resources of the Court of Appeal.16    It seemed to us abundantly clear that the\n\n  intention of Parliament in making the amendment to s 34(2)(a) of the SCJA was to limit the right\n\n  of appeal to this court. Hence, in any appeal from the decision of the High Court, in which the\n\n  value of the subject matter involved does not exceed $250,000, leave to appeal must be obtained\n\n  either from this court or a judge of the High Court.78.    To reinforce the above summary, Ms Tan referred to a speech\n\nby a Member of Parliament Mr R. Ravindran in the Singapore Parliament Report when the appropriate\n\nBill was being debated. In Parliament No 9, Session No 1, Volume No 69, Sitting No 11 of 26 November\n\n1998, Mr Ravindran said (at column 1634):Sir, the effect of the present limits is that cases within\n\n  the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court are appealable as of right to the High Court, but are\n\n  not appealable as of right to the Court of Appeal. This is a two-tier system. This position is\n\n  satisfactory, as there is no real need for a three tier-system for Magistrate Court suits.Sir, cases within the jurisdiction of the District Courts are\n\n  appealable as of right to the High Court and are also appealable as of right to the Court of\n\n  Appeal. This position is unsatisfactory as there is a three-tier system and it is not something\n\n  that is really needed. Indeed, the proposed amendments may have been intended to do away with this\n\n  anomaly. Cases within the jurisdiction of the High Court are appealable as of right to the Court\n\n  of Appeal. Here again, there is a two tier system. This position is satisfactory and was\n\n  consciously adopted with the cessation of appeals to the Privy Council.79.    It seemed to me that this view was implicit in the intention\n\nto limit the right of appeal from a decision of the District Court to primarily the High Court.\n\nIndeed this was also recognised by Chao Hick Tin JA in para 13 of his judgment inTan Chiang\n\nBrothers Marble (S) Pte Ltd v Permasteelisa Pacific Holdings Ltd[2002] 2 SLR 225where he\n\nsaid,  Implicit in the scheme of things is that there should, as a rule, be only one tier of\n\nappeal ..80.    As for the argument that the court should assume, for\n\npresent purposes, that Cyberinc would obtain the maximum sum under the District Courts\n\njurisdiction after the assessment of damages, Ms Tan submitted that it was uncertain how much\n\nCyberinc would actually get. She argued that Mr Coomaraswamys argument would inject uncertainty.\n\nShe also submitted that such an argument would cause an unworkable or impracticable or inconvenient\n\nresult.81.    Lastly, Ms Tan adopted a point from a question that I had\n\nposed to Mr Coomaraswamy. She submitted that if the cross-claim was by way of a separate action, the\n\nargument of Mr Coomaraswamy of taking into account each figure to obtain the difference must fail as\n\nthere were two separate actions. The fact that the cross-claim was mounted as a counterclaim in the\n\nsame action should not give rise to a different outcome.82.    As regards the question as to whether leave to appeal, if\n\nrequired, should be granted, Ms Tan did not advance any submission thereon.",
        "MY REASONS ON DATAWORKS APPLICATION": "83.    I was of the view that Mr Coomaraswamy was not wrong in\n\nadopting the maximum sum under the District Courts jurisdiction for the purpose of his argument\n\nin relation to s 34(2)(a). After all, Cyberinc had in its affidavit alleged its damages to be more\n\nthan the $250,000 maximum sum. The situation would be different if Cyberinc was alleging a sum much\n\nless than the maximum for its damages. I did not think that this approach was injecting an\n\nuncertainty or would cause an unworkable or impracticable or inconvenient result. It may be based on\n\nan assumption but the purpose was to inject some certainty into the present application and not the\n\nother way around. On the contrary, Ms Tans suggestion that one should wait until the assessment\n\nwas concluded would itself inject uncertainty and cause an unworkable or impracticable or\n\ninconvenient result. This is because the dead-line to appeal will often be earlier than the\n\nconclusion of the assessment. Furthermore, after the assessment, there might be a further appeal or\n\nappeals. In any event, for the reasons stated below, it did not matter whether the maximum sum was\n\nused or the actual sum granted to Cyberinc was used.84.    In my view, the case ofAugustineand the Malaysian\n\ncase ofYai Yen Honwere not relevant for the reasons I have mentioned.85.    It must be borne in mind that a counterclaim is a separate\n\nand independent action. If not for O 15 r 2(1) of the Rules of Court, a separate action would have\n\nto be filed separately. Order 15 r 2(1), however, enables, but does not compel, the separate action\n\nto be filed as a counterclaim in an existing action.86.    When the separate action is filed as a counterclaim, it does\n\nnot cease to be a separate action in substance. Thus The Supreme Court Practice 1999 Volume 1 para\n\n15/2/4 states:15/2/4To what extent a counterclaim is an independent\n\n  action- A counterclaim issubstantially a cross-action, not merely a defence to the\n\n  plaintiffs claim.It must be of such a nature that the Court would have jurisdiction to\n\n  entertain it as a separate action(Bow McLachlan & Co. Ltd v. Ship Camosun[1909]   A.C. 597;Williams v. Agius[1914] A.C. 522). \"A counterclaim is to be treated, for\n\n  all purposes for which justice requires it to be so treated, as an independent action\" (perBowen L.J., inAmon v. Bobbett22 Q.B.D. 543 at 548). If after the defendant has\n\n  pleaded a counterclaim, the action of the plaintiff is for any reason stayed, discontinued or\n\n  dismissed, the counterclaim may nevertheless be proceeded with (para. (3)). Thus, where the\n\n  plaintiffs claim was held to be frivolous, the Court still granted the defendant the relief\n\n  prayed for by his counterclaim (Adams v. Adams(1892) 45 Ch.D. 426; [1892] 1 Ch. 369).In\n\n  short, for all purposes except those of execution, a claim and a counterclaim are two independent\n\n  actions(perLord Esher M.R., inStumore v. Campbell & Co.[1892] 1   Q.B. 314 at 317) .[Emphasis added.]87.    Therefore, although, as a matter of procedural convenience,\n\na claim and a counterclaim are dealt with together at the same directions stage and the same trial,\n\nthey are still separate actions.88.    The reference in s 34(2)(a) to the amount or value of the\n\nsubject matter at the trial must, in my view, be construed as referring to the trial of an\n\naction. In the context of a claim and counterclaim, the trial is of two actions. This interpretation\n\nwould advance the purpose of the provision which is to restrict appeals from District Court actions\n\nto the Court of Appeal. After all, claims and counterclaims are a common feature of litigation and\n\nit could not have been the intention of Parliament to allow such appeals to proceed to the Court of\n\nAppeal as a matter of right when Parliaments intention was to restrict such appeals generally.89.    In addition, if Mr Coomaraswamys argument was accepted,\n\nit would result in an anomaly. When the cross-claim is filed as a counterclaim, the right of appeal\n\nto the Court of Appeal would be unimpeded. However, if there were two separate actions, the right of\n\nappeal would be restricted. This could not be right even though I accepted that, generally, the two\n\nactions would be consolidated before the trial. However this would not always necessarily be the\n\ncase.90.    As for the argument that either Datawork would obtain\n\npayment for the price of the products already paid for or Cyberinc would obtain payment of the\n\nunpaid purchase price and damages, I was of the view that such an argument militated against the\n\nconclusion that Mr Coomaraswamy was advocating. In such a scenario, only the higher of the two\n\npossible judgment sums should be taken instead of adding them up.91.    In any event, I was of the view that it did not matter\n\nwhether one party must succeed and the other must fail or the situation was one in which each\n\nopposing party could succeed in its respective claims. Parliament did not intend for parties and the\n\ncourts to engage in an exercise to determine which scenario was applicable for every claim and\n\ncounterclaim in order to determine whether leave to appeal was required.92.    Accordingly, I concluded that Datawork was required to\n\nobtain leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.93.    As for the issue whether leave to appeal should be granted,\n\nI was of the view that it was not open to Mr Coomaraswamy to advance the argument about the\n\nintermediate role of the High Court when his colleague, Mr David Chan, advanced a different argument\n\nbefore me when the appeal proper to the High Court was heard by me. In summary, Mr Chan had\n\nadvocated only the trite principle that an appellate court should be slow in disturbing findings of\n\nfact of a trial court and Ms Tan did not dispute that principle.94.    In any event, the High Court is, as a rule, supposed to be\n\nthe final appellate court for trials in the District Court. It is only in limited situations that an\n\nappeal may be made to the Court of Appeal. In emphasizing the likelihood of an increase in the\n\nDistrict Courts jurisdiction, Mr Coomaraswamy was actually reminding me of the concern which led\n\nto the limiting of appeals from the District Court to the Court of Appeal.95.    Ultimately, I was of the view that however Mr Coomaraswamy\n\nsought to couch the applicable principle for an appellate High Court, it would not have made a\n\ndifference to my conclusion. I was of the view that the finding of the trial judge was plainly wrong\n\nor, to use Mr Coomaraswamys words, was manifestly erroneous or perverse.96.    The truth of the matter was that my decision and the reasons\n\nfor my decision did not involve any important question of law for the Court of Appeal to decide.97.    As for whether my decision involved an error of law, I was\n\nof the view that my decision was on the facts. However, Mr Coomaraswamy had to label it as an error\n\nof law to improve Dataworks chances of securing leave to appeal. For the reasons I have given as\n\nto why I reached a different conclusion from the trial judge, I could not agree that her conclusion\n\ncould stand when tested against inherent probabilities or improbabilities and against uncontroverted\n\nfacts.98.    I also did not think that the Australian case ofBaumgartner\n\nv Baumgartnertook the matter any further. I did not base my decision solely on what was common\n\nground. With respect, my decision was based more on the application of facts and points which the\n\ntrial judge had not considered.99.    Accordingly, leave to appeal was refused.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERSINGAPORECopyright © Government of Singapore."
