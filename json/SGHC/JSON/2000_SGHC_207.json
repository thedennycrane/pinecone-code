        "Defects": "4.    The plaintiffs\n\nalleged that the works were defective for the following reasons:(a) parts of the window frames in the\n\n  condominium had faded and/or discoloured due to the defective powder coating; and(b) the window handles were faulty as they\n\n  broke easily.5.    The plaintiffs’\n\nsolicitors wrote to the 1stand 2nddefendants on 21 February 2000\n\ngiving them notice of the defects. They stated that legal action would be taken\n\nimmediately if these defects were not rectified within 14 days. The present action was\n\ninstituted on 5 April 2000 when the defendants failed to rectify the defects.6.    At the commencement\n\nof the trial, I was informed that the 1stdefendants had gone into liquidation.\n\nThe plaintiffs thus decided to proceed solely against the 2nddefendants.7.    After hearing\n\nevidence on the disputed defects and the causes associated with them, I found that (a)\n\nboth the window handles and the powder coating of the window frames were indeed defective,\n\nand (b) the 2nddefendants were liable for these defects under the deed. In my\n\nopinion, the defects were not caused by any act or omission of the plaintiffs, their\n\nservants or agents. Neither were they the result of fair wear and tear.8.    The 2nddefendants counterclaimed for rescission of the deed on the basis that it was given by\n\nmistake. They contended that the deed was invalid and of no effect. At the trial, this\n\nissue was not seriously canvassed. In my judgment, the 2nddefendants’\n\ncounterclaim had no merit and I accordingly dismissed it.9.    I would not go into\n\nthe reasons for dismissing the counterclaim and my finding on the defects since the 2nddefendants did not appeal. The plaintiffs however appealed against the dismissal of their\n\nclaim. I now give my reasons.",
        "Deed of Indemnity": "10.    Central to my\n\ndecision was the construction of the deed, the relevant parts of which are as follows:WHEREAS:….3.    The Contractor [1stdefendants] and the Sub-Contractor [2nddefendants] have agreed to jointly and\n\n  severally indemnify the Employer [Hong Leong Holdings Ltd] in the manner hereinafter\n\n  appearing, against any defects in the design workmanship, quality of materials, uneven\n\n  fading, peeling, discolouration, watertightness or deterioration in the works to the\n\n  Premises.THE CONTRACTOR AND THE SUB-CONTRACTOR\n\n  HEREBY JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY AGREE WITH THE EMPLOYER AS FOLLOWS:-1.    The statements and representations in\n\n  the Recital hereinabove stated are true and accurate in all respects and this Indemnity\n\n  shall have full force and effect notwithstanding any limitation or termination of the\n\n  Contractor’s liability and/or responsibility under the Contract.2.    In the event of any deterioration or\n\n  defects (as shall be determined by the Employer) in the workmanship, quality of materials,\n\n  installation, watertightness or deterioration appearing in the works,the Contractor\n\n  (**) shall forthwith upon notice given toeither of themand within such time\n\n  as the Employer may direct, effect remedial works to the defective area or areas and shall\n\n  make good to the absolute satisfaction of the Employer all damages to surface finishes\n\n  including but not limited to plaster, panelling, tiling and other similar works,\n\n  mechanical, electrical or other installations or other property arising directly or\n\n  indirectly out of the said defects.3.    In the event thatremedial works\n\n  undertaken by the Contractoror the Sub-Contractorprove ineffective as\n\n  determined by the Employer whose decision shall be final and conclusive, or are not to the\n\n  satisfaction of the Employer,the Contractorand the Sub-Contractorshall\n\n  effect such additional works in such a manner and within such time as the Employer may\n\n  direct and shall carry out all test, as directed by the Employer until all the defects\n\n  have been remedied to the absolute satisfaction of the Employer.4.    Should the Contractor orthe\n\n  Sub-Contractorfail to perform their obligations under Clause 2 and 3 above within\n\n  a reasonable period, the Employer shall entitled to remedy the said defects and the\n\n  Contractorand the Sub-Contractorshall forthwith on demandreimburse the\n\n  Employerall costs and expenses incurred by the Employerfor making good the said\n\n  defects including all legal costs on a Solicitor and Client basisincurred by the\n\n  Employer in enforcing this Clause.….7.    The obligations of the Contractor and\n\n  Sub-Contractor under this Indemnity are joint and several and the Employer shall be\n\n  entitled to enforce the Indemnity against either the Contractor or the Sub-Contractor or\n\n  both; any failure by either the Contractor or the Sub-Contractor to perform such\n\n  obligations not excuse or discharge the other from performing the same.This Indemnity shall be valid for the\n\n  period of ten (10) years calculated from the issue of the Completion Certificate of the\n\n  Premises under the terms of the Contract. (Insertion of ‘**’ and all manner of\n\n  emphasis are mine.)Missing words11.    Plaintiffs’\n\ncounsel pointed out that the words \"and the sub-contractor\" (‘the missing\n\nwords’) were inadvertently left out of clause 2 at the location marked with a double\n\nasterisk. The 2nddefendants prepared the deed based on the standard form\n\nprovided by WT Partnership, the Quantity Surveyors and Construction Cost Consultants.\n\nPresent in that standard form were the missing words, from which an inference could be\n\ndrawn that they were inadvertently omitted. There was no evidence that the 2nddefendants had intentionally left out the missing words when they copied the clauses\n\nexactly from the standard form. I also found other glaring grammatical errors in clauses 4\n\nand 7 where the words \"be\" and \"shall\" respectively were omitted but\n\nwere present in the standard form. They were probably the result of clerical errors.12.    The construction of\n\nthe deed clearly calls for the missing words to be read in. Otherwise the words‘to\n\neither of them’will be otiose in the following part of clause 2:\"the Contractor (**) shall forthwith\n\n  upon notice givento either of them\".13.    Clause 3 states that\n\nif the remedial works undertaken by either ‘the Contractor or the Sub-Contractor\n\nprove ineffective’ [and I think it must be referring to the remedial works done\n\nunder clause 2], the contractor and subcontractor shall effect additional works as\n\ndirected by the employer. It is within the contemplation of clause 3 that the remedial\n\nworks in clause 2 can alternatively be performed by the subcontractor. If clause 2 were to\n\nbe construed asnotplacing any obligation to repair on the subcontractor at all,\n\nthen the words \"or the Sub-Contractor\" in the first two lines of clause 3\n\nwould be meaningless. This again supports the contention that those missing words should\n\nhave been there.14.    Being a joint and\n\nseveral indemnity, it is not surprising that the deed places the same obligations on both\n\nthe contractor and subcontractor throughout. Consequently, it made sense to place the same\n\nobligation on the subcontractor to perform the remedial work upon notice given to him in\n\nclause 2.15.    However much I would\n\nlike to construe the deed strictly, I found that the deed must be read such that those\n\nmissing words are present. In my opinion, it was a clerical error made in copying from the\n\nstandard form.16.    In any event, this\n\nwas not material to the decision. On the facts, the plaintiffs had notified both the\n\ncontractor (i.e. 1stdefendants) and the subcontractor (i.e. 2nddefendants) of the defects. Neither of them did any remedial work. Being jointly and\n\nseverally liable, the 2nddefendants would also be liable if the 1stdefendants failed to carry out the repairs. Under clause 4, the 2nddefendants\n\nwould have to indemnify the present assignees of the deed for the cost of making good the\n\nsaid defects, whether or not those missing words were read into the deed.Was the deed an indemnity or a warranty17.    Plaintiffs’\n\ncounsel submitted that although the deed was titled \"Indemnity for Aluminium and\n\nGlazing Works\" and the word \"indemnify\" was used at recital 3, nevertheless\n\nin substance it was a warranty and not an indemnity. He contended that it was highly\n\nunusual in the deed to indemnify the plaintiffs against defects. Counsel urged me to treat\n\nit as a warranty.18.    I found it difficult\n\nto construe the deed as a warranty when the deed itself had made it so explicit that it\n\nwas an indemnity. The words \"indemnity\" and \"indemnify\" were used no\n\nless than 11 times in the 3 page deed. In contrast, the word \"warranty\" never\n\nappeared.19.    On examination of\n\nthe terms of the deed, I found that the substance of the deed was also in the nature of an\n\nindemnity, which was entirely consistent with the title given. Under clause 4, should the\n\ncontractor or the subcontractor fail to perform their obligations under clauses 2 and 3,\n\nthe employer shall be entitled to claim reimbursement from the contractor and\n\nsubcontractor of all its costs and expenses for making good the defects, including the\n\nlegal costs for enforcing clause 4 on a ‘Solicitor and Client’ basis.20.    I therefore\n\nconcluded that on a true construction, it was a Deed of Indemnity and not a Deed of\n\nWarranty.Separate and Distinct Obligations21.    Plaintiffs’\n\ncounsel submitted that clauses 2, 3 and 4 were separate and distinct. There was no basis\n\nto suppose that ‘and’ was to be added at the end of clauses 2 and 3 when they\n\nend with a full stop. Thus the clauses must be read disjunctively and not conjunctively.\n\nAccordingly, any failure or refusal of the 1stor 2nddefendants to\n\nperform their obligations to remedy the defects under clause 2 of the deed immediately\n\ngave rise to a cause of action and a claim for damages against the two defendants.22.    The plaintiffs’\n\nclaim here was based entirely on a breach of the express terms of the deed. The breach\n\nstemmed from the 1stand 2nddefendants refusal to take any steps to\n\nrectify or replace the discoloured window frames and window latches within the 14 days\n\nstipulated by the plaintiffs in their notice to them dated 21 February 2000. It was not\n\ndisputed that both defendants were served notice of the defects in accordance with clause\n\n2 of the deed.23.    In the course of the\n\ntrial, the plaintiffs clarified that they were not relying on any breach of clause 4 of\n\nthe deed, which they said gave them an additional right against the defendants but did not\n\ntake away their remedies for breach of either clause 2 or 3.24.    Since the plaintiffs\n\nhad not done any remedial works themselves, they accepted that they could not claim any\n\nreimbursement under clause 4 simply because no costs and expenses for remedial works were\n\nincurred as yet. However, they maintained that they could still claim damages (to be\n\nsubsequently assessed) for breach of clause 2 of the deed at this moment without resorting\n\nto clause 4.25.    It was argued that\n\nif the remedy for clauses 2 and 3 were to be limited to clause 4, then it was tantamount\n\nto having an exemption clause restricting the liability of the defendants. As the deed had\n\nto be construed strictly and since there were no clear words taking away the rights of the\n\nplaintiffs, it was submitted that the said clauses of the deed were not to be construed as\n\nbeing restricted in this manner.Construction of the terms of the Deed of\n\nIndemnity26.    Defendants’\n\ncounsel argued that until the plaintiffs had paid for remedial works, the issue of\n\nreimbursement under clause 4 did not arise. The nature of the indemnity under the deed is\n\nan indemnity against payment.27.    I substantially\n\nagreed with the submissions of counsel for the 2nddefendants that clauses 2, 3\n\nand 4 have to be read together. These three clauses are interrelated and are\n\ninterdependent.28.    When defects arise,\n\nthe plaintiffs cannot simply sue for damages under the deed. First the plaintiffs (as the\n\nassignees of the employer) must give notice to either the contractor or subcontractor who\n\nwill then have to remedy the defects forthwith as provided for in clause 2. The manner of\n\nrectification is left to the contractor or subcontractor as the case may be. If the\n\nrectification proves ineffective, then the contractor and subcontractor will have no\n\nalternative but to effect additional works in the manner as directed by the plaintiffs\n\nunder clause 3. But at least, they still have the opportunity to carry out the remedial\n\nworks although they now have to comply with the directions and instructions of the\n\nplaintiffs. This appears logical to me because the contractor and subcontractor have been\n\nunsuccessful earlier with their own methods. Clause 4 stipulates clearly what is to happen\n\nif the contractor or subcontractor fails to perform any of their obligations under clauses\n\n2 and 3. The plaintiffs shall be entitled thereafter to remedy the defects and\n\nsubsequently claim reimbursement (plus all legal costs of enforcement) from them.29.    Clause 4 is thus the\n\nmachinery by which the indemnity under the deed is to operate for any breach of clause 2\n\nor 3. The plaintiffs should not be allowed to circumvent the deed of indemnity by suing\n\nfor damages for breach of clause 2 or 3per seas if the deed were a warranty.30.    In this deed, the\n\ncontractor and subcontractor had volunteered to subject themselves only to an indemnity\n\nand no more, provided that they are allowed the right to do the remedial works themselves\n\nfirst. The entire mechanism or the mode of indemnity is very clear. Only if they for some\n\nreason are unable to remedy the defects or they fail to do so, then the plaintiffs have\n\nthe right to claim an indemnity for the costs of rectification, which can either be done\n\nby the plaintiffs themselves or by another third party contractor. This was the manner\n\nagreed to by the contractor and subcontractor by which their risks under the indemnity\n\nwere to be distributed or allocated.31.    Unlike a claim for\n\ndamages which can be at large, the amount payable under the indemnity has been explicitly\n\nlimited to the costs of making good the defects plus legal costs on an indemnity basis.32.    Since the plaintiffs\n\nhave not expended any monies to remedy the defects, they cannot claim any reimbursement\n\nunder the deed of indemnity as yet. The plaintiffs’ claim under the indemnity is thus\n\nentirely premature and their action has not yet accrued against the 1stor 2nddefendants.33.    A few more scenarios\n\nto test the operation of clauses 2, 3 and 4 will make it reasonably obvious that the\n\nclauses operate together. If the subcontractor were to carry out some repairs under clause\n\n2, which prove ineffective, can the plaintiffs immediately sue for damages? If indeed each\n\nis a separate and distinct clause breach of which gives rise to damages, then the\n\nplaintiffs will be able to sue for damages immediately without clause 3 coming into play.\n\nI do not think that is a fair construction of the deed. I hold the view that the\n\ncontractor or subcontractor must still be given the chance to remedy the defects again\n\nunder clause 3, although this time they have to follow the plaintiffs’ instructions\n\non the manner of rectification. It is only after the contractor or subcontractor has\n\nexhausted all avenues available that they become liable to indemnify the plaintiffs in the\n\nmanner provided under clause 4.34.    Similarly, if one\n\nstretches the argument of plaintiffs’ counsel, it will appear that recital 3 and\n\nclause 1 read together permits the plaintiffs to sue for damages the moment defects arise\n\nregardless whether the contractor and subcontractor have been given the chance to remedy\n\nthe defects at their own expense first. I think that is a wrong construction of the terms\n\nof the deed.35.    The fact that\n\nreimbursement of legal costs on a ‘Solicitor and Client’ basis is provided for\n\nonly in clause 4 suggests that the sole remedy for breach of clauses 2 and 3 resides in\n\nclause 4. At the trial, I asked plaintiffs’ counsel what sort of legal costs would\n\nthe plaintiffs be entitled to for a successful claim based on a breach of clause 2 alone.\n\nHe submitted that it would only be ‘party and party’ costs. To my mind, that\n\nseems incongruous having regard to the entire scheme of the deed of indemnity. It must be\n\ncontemplated that there shall be full indemnity from the contractor or subcontractor with\n\nregard to all the legal costs of enforcement on a ‘Solicitor and Client’ basis,\n\nwhich I shall interpret as an indemnity basis. Since this is provided for only under\n\nclause 4, which explicitly refers to the contractor’s or subcontractor’s failure\n\nto perform under clauses 2 and 3, I arrive at the inescapable conclusion that clauses 2, 3\n\nand 4 work together as a whole, and not independently as contended by plaintiffs’\n\ncounsel.",
        "Orders made": "36.    Accordingly, I\n\ndismissed the plaintiffs’ claim because no cause of action has arisen as yet. Their\n\nclaim is premature.37.    During the course of\n\nthe proceedings, I was informed that the plaintiffs did not have sufficient funds and\n\nhence, could not pay for the remedial works and thereafter claim reimbursement under\n\nclause 4. On the other hand, the managing director of the 2nddefendants\n\noffered to do the remedial work. Under the circumstances, it is in the interest of both\n\nparties that I make clear that my decision is without prejudice to the 2nddefendants remedying the defects under clause 2 if they so wish, failing which the\n\nplaintiffs may rely on clause 3 and perhaps even clause 4 eventually, whereupon the 2nddefendants will be liable to fully indemnify the plaintiffs for all the costs of the\n\nremedial works (including legal costs if any), which costs will of course have to be\n\nproperly and reasonably incurred.38.    As the\n\ndefendants’ counterclaim was dismissed and the plaintiffs had succeeded on the other\n\nsubstantial issues in relation to the cause of the defects and whether the defects were\n\ncovered by the deed, I decided to award the defendants only 60% of their costs to be taxed\n\nif not agreed.Chan Seng OnnJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
