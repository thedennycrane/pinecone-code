        "Ground (a) – no reasonable cause of action disclosed": "5 (2) of O 18, r 19 expressly provides that no evidence shall be\n\nadmissible on an application under (1)(a). The Defendant must show that no cause of\n\naction is disclosed on the face of the pleadings. I had earlier explained that I had\n\nallowed the Defendants’ application in part and struck out some parts of the\n\nStatement of Claim. After removing the parts struck out, the Statement of Claim (apart\n\nfrom the prayers) would read as follows:\"1. The Plaintiffs are a company incorporated in Singapore and\n\n  carry on business as bankers.2. The Defendants are and were at all material times the owners of the\n\n  \"Victoria Cob\" of the port of Singapore.3. By a contract of carriage contained in and or evidenced by the\n\n  undermentioned Bills of Lading (the \"Bills of Lading\"), the Defendants agreed to\n\n  ship and carry a total of 508.312 metric tons of Crude Palm Oil (the \"Cargo\") on\n\n  board the vessel \"Victoria Cob\" from Belawan, Indonesia, for carriage to and\n\n  delivery at Kandla, India.Bills of Lading Nos.DateQuantitySIN(BEL)/KNL-1513 April 2000254.156 MTSIN(BEL)/KNL-1613 April 2000254.156 MT4. The Defendants were the issuers of the Bills of Lading and\n\n  carriers thereunder.5. The Plaintiffs were at all material times the owners of the\n\n  Cargo and or lawful holders or indorsees of the said Bills of Lading, and or persons\n\n  entitled to immediate possession of the said Cargo.6. As issuers of the Bills of Lading and carriers thereunder, and or as\n\n  bailees for reward, the Defendants were required to take reasonable care of the Cargo and\n\n  to deliver the Cargo at Kandla to any person(s) who holds and presents the original Bills\n\n  of Lading and or against production of the original Bills of Lading.7. In breach of contract or in breach of their duty as bailees, the\n\n  Defendants failed to take reasonable care of the Cargo and to deliver the Cargo to the\n\n  Plaintiffs against the presentation and or production of the original Bills of Lading and\n\n  instead delivered the Cargo to person(s) who did not hold and or present and or have\n\n  possession of the said original Bills of Lading.9. By reason of the Defendants’ breach of contract and or duty as\n\n  aforesaid, the Plaintiffs have suffered loss and damage.PARTICULARS OF LOSS AND DAMAGEa) Invoice price to Lanyard Foods Ltd (US$365 PMT x 508.312\n\n      MT)US$185,533.88b) Loss of interest at 9.5% per annum from\n\n      the date of loss until judgment or payment.\"6 The Plaintiffs also filed Further and Better Particulars of the\n\nStatement of Claim on 29 May 2001. The relevant particulars could be summarised as\n\nfollows:(a) The party from which the Plaintiffs derived title so as to become\n\n  owners of the Cargo was Ranchhoddas Purshottam Holdings Pte Ltd (\"RPH\").(b) The contract pursuant to which the Plaintiffs derived title to the\n\n  Cargo was in writing and contained in the following documents: (i) Joint-Credit Facilities\n\n  letter from the Plaintiffs to RPH dated 18 August 1999; (ii) the acceptance by RPH dated\n\n  24 August 1999; and (iii) the application by RPH to the Plaintiffs for\n\n  collection/purchase/negotiation on 25 May 2000.(c) The full circumstances under which the Plaintiffs became lawful\n\n  holders of the Bills of Lading are as follows: RPH submitted the application for\n\n  collection/purchase/negotiation together with the documents (i.e. bills of lading,\n\n  commercial invoices, etc.) and the Plaintiffs subsequently purchased the said documents\n\n  and made payment of US$185,533.88 to RPH by crediting the said sum to their account with\n\n  the Plaintiffs on 25 May 2000, at which date the Plaintiffs would be entitled to immediate\n\n  possession of the Cargo from the Defendants.7 The Plaintiffs did not provide particulars to,inter alia, the\n\nfollowing two questions in respect of 5 of the Statement of Claim:\"(d) Identify the party who allegedly endorsed the Bills of Lading\n\n  to the Plaintiffs and the date of such alleged endorsement.(e) State the full circumstances including date and time under which\n\n  the Bills of Lading were allegedly endorsed to the Plaintiffs\"The Defendants obtained an order of court to compel the Plaintiffs to\n\nprovide replies to those particulars requested. In compliance with that order, the\n\nPlaintiffs filed the following answers on 11 July 2001:\"(d) The Plaintiffs are not relying on endorsement to prove their\n\n  title to sue.(e) See answer to (d).\"8 That was the status of the Plaintiffs’ pleadings on 31 August\n\n2001 when the Defendants filed the application to strike out the claim. The three\n\naffidavits filed by the parties in relation to this matter have no relevance under ground\n\n(a) and the Defendants can look only to the pleadings to show that there is no reasonable\n\ncause of action disclosed therein. Although the Defendants appear to be relying on their\n\naffidavit in respect of this ground, they cannot do so as it is expressly stated in O 18 r\n\n19(2) that no evidence shall be admissible on an application under paragraph (1)(a). This\n\nposition has been affirmed by the Court of Appeal inGabriel Peter & Partners v Wee\n\nChong Jin & Ors[1998] 1 SLR 374, at 19:19 In their application for striking out, the respondents relied on\n\n  O.18, r.19(1)(a) as the ground in support of their application – that the writ of\n\n  summons and statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action. According to O.18,\n\n  r.19(2), no evidence shall be admissible on an application under O.18, r.19(1)(a). The\n\n  only exception to this prohibition against adducing evidence is where there is an\n\n  affidavit filed in support of the originating summons.The exception referred to in the last sentence relates to matters begun\n\nby originating summons for which provision is made in O 18, r 19(3) and has no application\n\nin a matter begun by writ, as is the present case.9 Accordingly, the determination of the application under this ground\n\nmust rest solely on the pleadings. The cause of action is fully pleaded in the Statement\n\nof Claim as clarified by the Further and Better Particulars filed on 29 May and 11 July\n\n2001. The Plaintiffs have pleaded the contract, as evidenced by the two Bills of Lading\n\nwhich the Plaintiffs had purchased from RPH. They had pleaded the Defendants’\n\nbreaches by their failure to deliver the cargoes against presentation of the bills. The\n\nPlaintiffs have also pleaded that they had suffered damages as a consequence of those\n\nbreaches. In the circumstances, the Defendants’ application under ground (a) must\n\nfail.",
        "Grounds (b), (c) and (d)": "10 In the affidavit filed by Yong on behalf of the Defendants, he said\n\nthat he had no personal knowledge of the material facts. His evidence in that respect was\n\nbased on his interpretation of the Bills of Lading and other documents obtained in\n\ndiscovery. Yong pointed out that the shippers had endorsed the bills in blank and\n\ndelivered them to RPH. RPH then on-sold the cargos to Lanyard Foods Ltd. Subsequently RPH\n\ndelivered the bills to the Plaintiffs for collection/purchase/negotiation, without filling\n\nin any name to the endorsement and it was still in blank. The Plaintiffs later filled in\n\nthe name of the State Bank of Saurashtra in India (\"State Bank\") and delivered\n\nthe bills to them, for collection by Lanyard Foods Ltd. However the bills were\n\nsubsequently returned to the Plaintiffs with the word \"CANCELLED\" stamped over\n\nthe endorsements to the State Bank. There were no endorsements on both bills by the State\n\nBank to the Plaintiffs. Yong concluded that the Plaintiffs were not the endorsees of the\n\nBills of Lading, which he said was consistent with the assertion in the Plaintiffs’\n\nfurther particulars that they were not relying on the endorsements to prove their title to\n\nsue. Yong said that in view of this, he was advised and believed that the Plaintiffs were\n\nnot the lawful holders of the Bills of Lading within the meaning of the Bills of Lading\n\nAct.11 Counsel for the Defendants submitted that the Plaintiffs was not the\n\nholder of the bills because they had been endorsed to the State Bank but the latter had\n\nnot endorsed them to the Plaintiffs when they were sent back to Singapore. Accordingly,\n\nthe Plaintiffs did not fall within the definition of \"Holder of a Bill of\n\nLading\" under s 5(2)(b) of the Bills of Lading Act (\"the Act\"). Therefore\n\nthe Plaintiffs had no rights under the bills and their action must fail.12 In the reply affidavit filed by Teo on behalf of the Plaintiffs, he\n\nclarified that the Plaintiffs purchased the bills in May 2000 pursuant to a Joint Credit\n\nFacility granted to RPH and their sister company Intermetallco Pte Ltd. The Plaintiffs had\n\ncredited into the account of RPH the sum of US$185,274.39 as payment. When the Plaintiffs\n\nobtained the bills, they were already endorsed in blank by the shipper. Thus those bills\n\ncame into the Plaintiffs’ possession as bearer documents. Subsequently the Plaintiffs\n\ntendered the shipping documents to the State Bank, the bankers of Lanyard Foods Ltd to\n\nwhom RPH had sold the cargo, to collect payment. To protect the Plaintiffs in the event\n\nthat the bills were lost in transit, the bills were endorsed to the State Bank. Teo said\n\nthat in the normal course of events, payment would have been received within 30 days.\n\nHowever no payment was received from the State Bank on behalf of Lanyard Foods Ltd and on\n\n10 October 2000 the Plaintiffs requested the State Bank to return the bills. This was done\n\non November 2000. After receipt the Plaintiffs stamped \"CANCELLED\" over the\n\nendorsements in the bills to the State Bank.13 Counsel for the Plaintiffs firstly submitted that the\n\nPlaintiffs’ cause of action had been made out on the pleadings and the Defendants\n\ncould not rely on the affidavits as a basis for striking out the action. Notwithstanding\n\nthis, he submitted that the Plaintiffs had an argument to the Defendants’ case that\n\nthe Plaintiffs were not the holder of the bills. He submitted that this was a bill\n\nendorsed in blank by the shipper and the endorsee’s name (the State Bank) had been\n\nfilled in by the Plaintiffs for collection by the State Bank. When the purchaser did not\n\nmake payment the State Bank returned the bills to the Plaintiffs who promptly cancelled\n\nthe specific endorsement they had made. He submitted that the cancellation had the effect\n\nof nullifying the original endorsement. He also submitted that s 5(2)(b) of the Act was\n\nnot to be interpreted in the manner that the Defendants' counsel had suggested.14 I can only conclude that there is a question of law that is not\n\naltogether clear that has to be decided in order to determine whether the Plaintiffs\n\nshould succeed in their claim. That appears to be the only ground for this application.\n\nOtherwise there is nothing in the affidavits setting out any reason for characterising the\n\nPlaintiffs’ claim as scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, or for believing that it\n\nwould prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action, or that it is otherwise\n\nan abuse of the process of court.15 In a determination under ground (a), the court will only look at the\n\npleadings and decide whether there is a cause of action. The court will not embark on a\n\ndetailed inquiry into the documents and facts of the case. InGabriel Peter &\n\nPartners v Wee Chong Jin & Ors, the Court of Appeal said at 18:18 In general, it is only in plain and obvious cases that the power of\n\n  striking out should be invoked. This was the view taken by Lindley MR inHubbuck &\n\n  Sons v Wilkinson, Heywood and Clark[1899] 1 QB 86 at p 91. It should not be exercised\n\n  by a minute and protracted examination of the documents and facts of the case in order to\n\n  see if the plaintiff really has a cause of action. The practice of the courts has been\n\n  that, where an application for striking out involves a lengthy and serious argument, the\n\n  court should decline to proceed with the argument unless, not only does it have doubts as\n\n  to the soundness of the pleading but, in addition, it is satisfied that striking out will\n\n  obviate the necessity for a trial or reduce the burden of preparing for a trial.16 Having failed under ground (a), what the Defendants appear to be\n\ndoing is to show by the very same minute and protracted examination of the documents and\n\nfacts that the Court of Appeal had referred to inGabriel Peter'scase, that the\n\nPlaintiffs’ case is hopeless and therefore it falls within grounds (b), (c) and (d).\n\nIn my view the Defendants are not entitled to do that for two reasons. Firstly, this would\n\npermit them to get around the prohibition against evidence in ground (a). Secondly, I\n\ncannot see how where there is a bona fide dispute as to the law, the claim can be\n\nconsidered scandalous, frivolous, vexatious, or would prejudice, embarrass or delay the\n\nfair trial or would be an abuse of court.17 In view of this, the Defendants’ application to strike out the\n\nclaim must fail. It appears to me that if what they seek is a preliminary determination on\n\na point of law, the appropriate application would be one under O 14, r 12.Sgd:LEE SIU KINJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
