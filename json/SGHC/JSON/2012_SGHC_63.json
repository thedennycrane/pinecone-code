        "Introduction": "1       The\nplaintiff, Lim Suat Hua (“Lim”) was employed by the defendant, Singapore\nHealthPartners Pte Ltd (“Singapore HealthPartners”) between 1 September\n2007 and 25 July 2010. Pursuant to the execution of a Settlement\nand Share Purchase Agreement dated 12 July 2010 (“the Settlement\nAgreement”), Lim’s employment was terminated with effect from 25 July\n2010. Lim brought this Action against Singapore HealthPartners for\nthe amount allegedly owing to her under the terms of her employment.",
        "Background": "2       Singapore\nHealthPartners was incorporated on 9 March 2006. It is in the business\nof developing a medical complex comprising a hospital, medical suites\nand a hotel at No 1 Farrer Park Station Road to be named the “Connexion”\n(“the Project”). 3       Lim\nwas one of the initial shareholders and directors of Singapore HealthPartners.\nPursuant to a service agreement dated 1 September 2007, entered\ninto between Singapore HealthPartners and Lim (“Lim’s Service Agreement”),\nLim was appointed as the Executive Director of Singapore HealthPartners.\nUnder cl 4.1 of Lim’s Service Agreement, she was to be paid $60,000\nper month. She was also entitled to 30 business days of leave a\nyear under cl 5.1. 4       Djeng\nShih Kien (“Djeng”), the other initial shareholder of Singapore HealthPartners,\nwas appointed Executive Chairman of Singapore HealthPartners pursuant\nto a similar service agreement entered into between himself and\nSingapore HealthPartners on 1 September 2007 (“Djeng’s Service Agreement”).\nUnder cl 4.1 of Djeng’s Service Agreement, he was to be paid $70,000\nper month. 5       On\n26 September 2007, pursuant to an investment agreement executed\non 29 June 2007 (“the Investment Agreement”), a number of medical\ndoctors or their corporate vehicles (collectively “the Investors Group”),\nBerjaya Leisure (Cayman) Ltd (“Berjaya”) and Wharton Scott Pte Ltd\n(“Wharton Scott”) were registered as new shareholders of Singapore HealthPartners.\nAs entitled to under the Investment Agreement, the new shareholders\nnominated directors (“the new directors”) to represent their respective\ninterests. The new directors were: (a)     Maurice\nChoo, Richard Chew and Whang Hwee Yong for the Investors Group; (b)     Dato’\nLee Kok Chuan and Dato’ Tan Yeong Ching (with Ng Chee Yau as alternate\ndirector) for Berjaya; and (c)     Tan\nSoon Hoe and Richard Charles Helfer for Wharton Scott. 6       Some\nof the new directors took issue with both Lim’s Service Agreement\nand Djeng’s Service Agreement (collectively “the Service Agreements”).\nThey alleged that the Service Agreements were signed before the\nnew directors had been appointed, and that Djeng and Lim had for\ntheir mutual benefit signed each other’s Service Agreement. Further,\nthey alleged that there was no board resolution approving the terms\nof the Service Agreements and that no disclosure of the Service\nAgreements was made to the new directors. The new directors were\ndissatisfied as to why no explanation was offered for the urgency\nin putting in place the Service Agreements prior to the registration\nof the new shareholders and the nomination of new directors. In\naddition, the new directors felt that the remuneration of both Lim\nand Djeng was excessive. 7       As\nsuch, at the conclusion of the board of directors meeting on 21 March\n2009 (“the 21 March 2009 board meeting”): (a)     Djeng\nagreed to step down from his position as Executive Chairman of Singapore\nHealthPartners on the basis that Singapore HealthPartners would\nnot pursue any claims against him; and (b)     it\nwas resolved that a Remuneration Committee be set up “to review\nDirectors’ Fees and Directors’ Remunerations [sic],\nincluding retrospectively review [sic]\nthe appropriateness of past Directors’ Remuneration”. 8       At\nthe next board meeting on 30 March 2009, it was resolved that Lim be\noffered “a New Service Agreement (NSA) for the period from 1 April 2009\nto TOP [Temporary Occupation Permit] of the project, at a monthly basic\nsalary of S$50,000”. All other terms in Lim’s Service Agreement\nwere unchanged. According to Singapore HealthPartners, Lim had verbally agreed\nto this. 9       From\nJuly 2009 onwards, the situation worsened as the directors and shareholders\nsplit into two factions. On one side was the faction headed by Djeng,\ncomprising Djeng, Lim and the Berjaya directors. On the other was the\nfaction that comprised the Investors Group directors and the Wharton Scott\ndirectors. The dispute initially was over the question whether Djeng was\nentitled to remain as Chairman of Singapore HealthPartners notwithstanding\nhis resignation at the 21 March 2009 board meeting. The dispute\nresulted in several arbitral and court proceedings. 10     Eventually,\nthe two factions concluded that the best way of resolving the disputes\nwas for one side to buy the other out. As a result, the Settlement\nAgreement was executed on 12 July 2010. Pursuant to the Settlement\nAgreement: (a)     Lim,\nDjeng and Berjaya exited as shareholders of Singapore HealthPartners;\nand (b)     Lim’s\nlast day of employment as Executive Director of Singapore HealthPartners\nwas to be 25 July 2010. 11     Following\nthe mutual termination of Lim’s employment on 25 July 2010, Lim\nand Singapore HealthPartners disagreed over the amount of salary\nthat was owing to Lim. Lim brought this Action against Singapore HealthPartners\non 22 October 2010 for the amount allegedly owing to her under Lim’s\nService Agreement.",
        "Plaintiff’s pleadings": "12     Lim’s\nclaim against Singapore HealthPartners for unpaid salary was made\nup of three components: (a)     Claim\nfor “short-paid” salary from May 2009 to June 2010; (b)     Claim\nfor pro-rated salary for July 2010; and (c)     Claim\nfor compensation for unconsumed leave of 37 days for the years 2008,\n2009 and 2010.",
        "Claim for “short-paid” salary\nfrom May 2009 to June 2010": "13     Under\ncl 4.1 of Lim’s Service Agreement, Singapore HealthPartners was\nto pay Lim a monthly salary of $60,000. Lim alleged that in breach\nof Lim’s Service Agreement, Singapore HealthPartners had only paid\nher $50,000 per month for the period May 2009 to June 2010. This\nresulted in Lim suffering a loss of $140,000 over the 14-month period.",
        "Claim for pro-rated salary for\nJuly 2010": "14     As\nmentioned earlier, Lim’s last day of employment pursuant to the Settlement\nAgreement was 25 July 2010. Lim pleaded that her pro-rated salary\nfor July 2010 ought to be $46,251.64.",
        "Claim for compensation for unconsumed\nleave of 37 days for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010": "15     At\ntrial, Lim withdrew her claim for compensation for unconsumed leave\nfor the years 2008, 2009 and 2010.",
        "Plaintiff’s eventual claim": "16     Therefore,\nLim’s claim against Singapore HealthPartners is for the sum of $186,026.64,\nthe breakdown of which is as follows: S/NoItemAmount1The withholding of $10,000 from Lim’s salary for 14 months\n(from May 2009 to June 2010)$140,000.002Pro-rated salary for July 2010$46,026.64Total:$186,026.64",
        "Defendant’s pleadings": "17     Singapore\nHealthPartners’ defence to Lim’s claim is as follows: (a)     Lim’s\nService Agreement had been varied as of April 2009 such that the\nmonthly salary provided therein was reduced from $60,000 to $50,000\n(“the Varied Service Agreement”); (b)     Alternatively,\nan estoppel by convention/common assumption operated to prevent\nLim from relying on the monthly salary of $60,000 provided in Lim’s\nService Agreement; (c)     Lim’s\npro-rated salary for July 2010 should be based on the reduced monthly\nsalary of $50,000; and (d)     Singapore\nHealthPartners is entitled to a set off and counterclaim against\nLim’s pro-rated salary for July 2010. 18     Singapore\nHealthPartners’ counterclaim against Lim is for: (a)     Lim’s\nbreach of fiduciary obligations as a director of Singapore HealthPartners;\nand (b)     Lim’s\nbreach of duties of loyalty and fidelity owed to Singapore HealthPartners\nby virtue of Lim’s Service Agreement.",
        "Lim’s Service Agreement was\nvaried such that the monthly salary provided therein was reduced\nfrom $60,000 to $50,000": "19     Singapore\nHealthPartners pleaded that on or about 26 March 2009, Maurice Choo\nhad verbally informed Lim that her salary of $60,000 was excessive\nand proposed that Lim’s Service Agreement be varied such that her\nmonthly salary would be reduced to $50,000 (“Maurice Choo’s proposal on\n26 March 2009”). Singapore HealthPartners averred that on or about 27 March\n2009, Lim had verbally informed Maurice Choo that she agreed to\nthe reduction of her monthly salary to $50,000. Further, or in the alternative,\nLim’s Act of accepting the reduced salary was an acceptance of Maurice\nChoo’s proposal on 26 March 2009, which acceptance was re-affirmed\nby the acceptance of the reduced salary every month until July 2010.",
        "Estoppel by convention/common\nassumption operated to prevent Lim from relying on the monthly salary\nof $60,000 provided in Lim’s Service Agreement": "20     Assuming\nthat Lim’s Service Agreement had not been varied, Singapore HealthPartners\npleaded in the alternative that pursuant to Maurice Choo’s proposal\non 26 March 2009, Lim and Singapore HealthPartners Acted on a shared\nassumption that Lim would only be entitled to a monthly salary of\n$50,000 with effect from 1 April 2009. 21     This\nassumption was Acted and relied upon by Lim when she received the\nreduced salary for the period 1 May 2009 to 30 June 2010. She also\nsigned authorisation letters on behalf of Singapore HealthPartners\nto instruct the bank to make payments into her bank account based\non the reduced salary for the period 1 May 2009 to 30 June 2010.\nLim had further Acted and relied on this shared assumption by not\naddressing the issue of her reduced salary in the Settlement Agreement.\nSingapore HealthPartners had also relied on the shared assumption\nand as a result took no step to ensure that the reduction of salary\nwas legally perfected. As such, Singapore HealthPartners pleaded\nthat it would be unconscionable for Lim to resile from the shared\nassumption.",
        "Lim’s pro-rated salary for July\n2010": "22     Singapore\nHealthPartners does not dispute that it owes Lim her pro-rated salary\nfor July 2010. However, it disputes the quantum of the said salary. 23     Firstly,\nit asserts that the pro-rated amount should be based on the reduced\nsalary of $50,000. Secondly, it claims that it is entitled to deduct\nthe sums of $16,438.36 (being the gross amount of salary for over-consumed leave\nin 2010) and $10,000 (being the excess amount that Lim paid herself in\nApril 2009). 24     As\nsuch, Singapore HealthPartners avers that the amount it owes Lim for\nJuly 2010 is only $13,546.22.",
        "Counterclaims for breach of\nfiduciary duties": "25     Firstly,\nSingapore HealthPartners pleaded that Lim made unauthorised overseas\ntrips at its expense, causing it a loss of $42,105. The first was\na trip to Thailand from 1 to 3 October 2008 (“the Thailand trip”) and\nthe second, a trip to New Zealand from 20 to 24 October 2008 (“the New\nZealand trip”). 26     Secondly,\nSingapore HealthPartners seek an order for an account and inquiry\nin relation to secret profits received by Wizvision Pte Ltd (“Wizvision”)\nand Fidelio Realty Pte Ltd (“Fidelio”). Additionally, Singapore\nHealthPartners seek an order for payment to itself of all sums found\ndue and owing on the taking of the account. 27     Wizvision\nhad provided information technology services to Singapore HealthPartners\nfrom around November 2007 to around September 2010. According to\nSingapore HealthPartners, Lim had been a director of Wizvision since\n7 April 2000. Her son, Lim Kong Wee, had been an alternate director\nof Wizvision from 7 December 2007 to 2 August 2009 and a director\nof Wizvision since 3 August 2009. In addition, Lim and another of\nher sons, Lim Wee Kiat, had direct and indirect shareholdings of at\nleast 32% in Wizvision which they failed, refused and/or neglected\nto fully disclose to the board of Singapore HealthPartners. 28     Fidelio\nwere co-brokers of a tenancy which Singapore HealthPartners had\nentered into in or around 2007. As co-brokers, Fidelio were alleged\nto have received a fee of $4,935. According to Singapore HealthPartners,\nLim and Lim Kong Wee were shareholders of Fidelio, and Lim had failed, refused\nand/or neglected to disclose that she and her son were shareholders of\nFidelio. However, at trial, Singapore HealthPartners withdrew its\nclaim against Lim in relation to Fidelio.",
        "Issues before the court": "29     With\nregard to Lim’s claim, the issues which need to be dealt with are as\nfollows: (a)     Whether\nthere was an agreement between Lim and Singapore HealthPartners\nto reduce Lim’s monthly salary from $60,000 to $50,000 (“the Variation\nIssue”); (b)     Whether,\nalternatively, an estoppel by convention and/or common assumption\noperates to prevent Lim from relying on cl 4.1 of Lim’s Service\nAgreement which stipulates a monthly salary of $60,000 (“the Estoppel\nIssue”); and (c)     Whether\nLim had taken excess leave of ten days in 2010 for which Singapore\nHealthPartners should be credited with $16,438.36 (“the Excess Leave\nIssue”). 30     With\nregard to Singapore HealthPartners’ counterclaim, the following issues\nneed to be resolved: (a)     Whether\nLim had paid herself $10,000 in excess of the salary she was entitled\nto for the month of April 2009 (“the Excess Payment Issue”); (b)     Whether\nthe Settlement Agreement constituted a waiver, release or discharge\nof Singapore HealthPartners’ claims (“the Waiver, Release and Discharge\nIssue”); (c)     If\nnot waived, released or discharged, whether the overseas trips were\nunauthorised and constituted a breach of Lim’s fiduciary duties to\nSingapore HealthPartners (“the Unauthorised Trips Issue”); and (d)     If\nnot waived, released or discharged, whether Lim had breached her\nfiduciary duties to Singapore HealthPartners by failing to disclose\nher direct and indirect stakes in Wizvision (“the Disclosure Issue”).",
        "Court’s findings": "",
        "Lim’s claims": "The Variation Issue 31     It\nis noted that Lim does not dispute that Maurice Choo had on or about\n26 March 2009 proposed to her that her salary be reduced to $50,000. However,\nLim asserts that, in any event, Maurice Choo “was not duly authorised\nby [Singapore HealthPartners] to make that request or otherwise\nvary the Service Agreement” as: (a)     Maurice\nChoo was only appointed as an interim chairman at the 21 March 2009\nboard meeting; (b)     Maurice\nChoo had not, prior to making the proposal to Lim, brought the proposal\nto the board of directors for its consideration; and (c)     There\nwas no resolution by the board of directors for Maurice Choo to\nmake such a proposal to Lim. 32     Another\nissue is whether Lim had on 27 March 2009 verbally agreed to Maurice\nChoo’s proposal on 26 March 2009. Lim denies having agreed to Maurice\nChoo’s proposal. At trial, Lim maintained that she did not, at any point\nin time, agree to the reduction of her monthly salary. According\nto her, even up till the date of the mutual termination of her employment pursuant\nto the Settlement Agreement on 25 July 2010, she was waiting for a\nwritten or verbal offer to vary her Service Agreement. Maurice Choo\ngave evidence at trial that Lim had agreed on 27 March 2009 to reduce\nher monthly salary to $50,000. He produced his electronic diary\nentry for 27 March 2009 (“the Entry”) which noted as follows: Mrs. Lim Suat Hua came to meet Dr. Maurice\nChoo at Maurice Choo Clinic. She accepted the arrangement discussed\nthe previous day, and will submit her resignation accordingly. She\nwill accept a salary of $50,000 per month. 33     Singapore\nHealthPartners also rely on the minutes of the board meeting of\n30 March 2009 to show that Lim had agreed to the reduction of her\nsalary. Item 12.7 of said minutes (“Resolution 12.7”) records the following: It is resolved That SHL [Lim] be offered a New Service\nAgreement (NSA) for the period from 1 April 2009 to TOP of the project,\nat a monthly basic salary of S$50,000. All other terms of the Service\nAgreement shall remain the same. 34     It\nis undisputed that Lim was present at the 30 March 2009 board meeting.\nIt is also undisputed that Lim was asked to step out of the meeting room\nwhen the time came to discuss the matters within the purview of\nthe Remuneration Committee. According to the testimony of Maurice\nChoo and Richard Chew, all the directors agreed to reduce Lim’s\nsalary to $50,000. She was then asked to rejoin the meeting where\nshe did not object to the reduction in salary with effect from 1 April\n2009. 35     However,\nLim denies that such a resolution was validly passed. She argues\nthat the resolution must have been subsequently inserted into the minutes\nby Maurice Choo. She claims not to have been told of the deliberations\nof the board in her absence and that she did not know that such\na resolution had been passed until she received the draft minutes\non 2 May 2009. 36     In\naddition, Lim gave evidence that from May 2009 to June 2010 she did\nnot openly object to the reduction of her monthly salary because: (a)     she\nwas waiting for the written offer from Richard Chew to know the\nfull terms of Singapore HealthPartners’ proposed variation to her\nService Agreement; (b)     her\ntime and mind were occupied with the sales of the medical suites\nand evaluation of the tenders for the main building contract; and (c)     the\ndisputes amongst the shareholders and directors had caused her great\nstress and duress. 37     On\na balance of probabilities, I am unable to find that Lim had agreed to\nthe variation of her monthly salary on or about 27 March 2009. I\nnote that the Entry recorded the following: (a)     That\nthere was an “arrangement” discussed the previous day; (b)     That\nLim accepted the “arrangement” and would submit her resignation\naccordingly; and (c)     That\nLim would accept a salary of $50,000 per month. It would appear from the above that Lim’s agreement to accept\nthe $50,000 was part of a wider “arrangement” involving her resignation\nand entering into a new service agreement one of the terms of which\nwas that Lim would be paid a monthly salary of $50,000. Nothing\nin the Entry suggested that Lim’s Service Agreement was to be varied\nin only one respect, namely, the salary. As such, the Entry did\nnot bear out Singapore HealthPartners’ contention that Lim had agreed\non 27 March 2009 to a reduction of her salary. 38     I\nmove on to consider Resolution 12.7 of the minutes of the 30 March 2009\nboard meeting. Even if it had been validly passed, Resolution 12.7\nof the minutes of the 30 March 2009 board meeting only resolved\nthat Lim be offered “a New Service Agreement (NSA) for the period\nfrom 1 April 2009 to TOP of the project at a monthly basic salary\nof S$50,000”; it did not record that Lim had agreed to the said\nvariation. This accords with my interpretation of the Entry. 39     If\nLim had indeed agreed on 27 March 2009 to a reduction of her salary\nas the sole variation of Lim’s Service Agreement, Maurice Choo would\nhave informed the board, at the 30 March 2009 board meeting, of such\nagreement. Nothing to this effect appeared in exhibit P2 or in the entire\ntranscripts of the audio-recording of the 30 March 2009 board meeting.\nInstead, Lim was required to leave the room when the time came to\ndiscuss her Service Agreement. 40     I\nalso note that, at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of Singapore HealthPartners\non 2 May 2009, Maurice Choo had informed shareholders that Lim had\ntendered her resignation on 21 March 2009. However, under cross-examination,\nMaurice Choo was forced to concede that he had misled the shareholders\nat the AGM. 41     For\nthe above reasons, it would not be safe to rely on Maurice Choo’s oral\nevidence that Lim had agreed on 27 March 2009 to the variation of\nher Service Agreement. 42     In\naddition to the question of her salary, Lim alleged that another term\nthat was being considered was the issue of her tenure. Lim exhibited an\nextract from the transcripts of audio-recordings of the board meeting\non 30 March 2009 (“exhibit P2”) to support her case that there was\n“no consensus reached by the [b]oard on how to move forward on the\nService Agreement let alone any consensus on the revised terms”.\nLim also pointed out that exhibit P2 did not contain any discussion\nof a resolution to reduce her salary. As such, Lim submits that\nResolution 12.7 “cannot be correct but must have been inserted subsequently\ninto the minutes” by Maurice Choo. Given my reading of the text\nof Resolution 12.7, it is unnecessary for me to say anything further\nin regard to its validity or otherwise. 43     I\nshould perhaps add that I generally had considerable difficulty\nwith the evidential value of exhibit P2 (and the transcripts of\nthe audio-recording of the 30 March 2009 board meeting in general).\nAs exhibit P3 (a table of audio-recordings of board meetings comparing\nthe duration of such recordings with the length of the respective\nmeetings as shown in the minutes thereof) noted, the audio-clip\non which the transcripts were based only ran for 1 hour 18 minutes\nand 59 seconds. However, the recorded duration of the meeting was\n2 hours 15 minutes. It would appear that about 56 minutes of the\nmeeting was unrecorded. This calls into question the completeness\nof exhibit P2 (and the transcripts of the audio-recording of the\n30 March 2009 board meeting in general). In addition, the following board\nresolutions that were recorded in the minutes of the 30 March 2009 board\nmeeting are also missing from the corresponding audio-recordings and\ntranscripts: (a)     Resolution\n12.8 that Maurice Choo and Lim are “authorized [sic]\nto sign on behalf of the Board, the Audited Financial Statements for\nthe Financial Period ended 31 December 2008”; (b)     Resolution\n12.9 that “the withdrawal of Mr. Gary Yeoh as the Alternate Director\nto Dato’ Tan is accepted and the withdrawal be recorded in the Company’s\nRegister and lodgment be made to ACRA”; (c)     Resolution\n12.9 that “the next AGM shall be held on 25 April 2009 at 2:30 PM\nat Lucky Plaza, conference room”; and (d)     Resolution\n12.10 that “the next BOD meeting shall be held half an hour after\nthe conclusion of the next AGM”. 44     In\ndefending the reliability of exhibit P2, Lim noted that there were discrepancies\nbetween the duration of the audio-recordings and the recorded duration\nin the minutes forallthe recorded\nboard meetings. In fact, for the board meeting on 23 May 2009, the\naudio-recordings had an additional 35 minutes as compared to the\nrecorded duration in the minutes. The then-corporate secretary Steven\nLim offered the following reasons for the discrepancies: (a)     When\nthe board went off tangent during meetings, he would switch off\nthe recording; (b)     He\nrecorded approximate timings in the minutes; and (c)     The\nrecorder used was a voice-activated recorder that would automatically\nstop recording until it picked up a voice. 45     In\naddition to thequantitativediscrepancies\nbetween the audio-recordings and the recorded duration in the minutes,\nexhibit P2 was alsoqualitativelyflawed.\nThe transcripts, in my view, do not allow me to form a clear picture\nof what was discussed at the meeting. There are parts of exhibit P2\nwhere the voices are unidentified. Further, some parts of exhibit\nP2 are incomplete. The quality of the transcripts is directly related\nto the quality of the audio-recordings. At trial, I struggled to\nmake out parts of the audio-recordings as the members of the board\noften spoke simultaneously. There are also parts of the audio-recordings\nwhich were inaudible. 46     Given\nboth the quantitative discrepancies between the duration of the audio-recordings\nand the recorded duration in the minutes for all the recorded meetings\nand the poor quality of the transcripts and audio-recordings of\nthe 30 March 2009 board meeting, I am unwilling to place much weight\non exhibit P2 (and the transcripts of the audio-recording of the\n30 March 2009 board meeting in general). The Estoppel Issue 47     In\nthe alternative, Singapore HealthPartners argues that even if Lim did\nnot agree to the reduction in her monthly salary, an estoppel by convention/common\nassumption operates to prevent Lim from insisting that her monthly\nsalary should have been $60,000. 48     The\nlaw on estoppel by convention/common assumption is set out in the\ncase ofTravista Development Pte Ltd v Tan\nKim Swee Augustine[2008] 2 SLR(R) 474 at[31]where the Court of Appeal held\nthat: On the basis of existing authorities, for\nestoppel by convention to operate, the following elements must be\npresent (seeSingTel v SCVat[28]; see alsoChitty on\nContracts(H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 29thEd,\n2004) vol 1 at para 3–107): (a)The parties must have Acted on ‘an assumed\nand incorrect state of fact or law’ [emphasis added]\n(per Bingham LJ inThe Vistafjord[1988]\n2 Lloyd’s Rep 343 at 352) in their course of dealing. (b)The assumption must be either shared\nby both parties pursuant to an agreement or something akin to an\nagreement, or made by one party and acquiesced to by the other. (c)It must be unjust or unconscionable\nto allow the parties (or one of them) to go back on that assumption. It follows that an estoppel by convention\ncannot arise where neither of the parties between whom the alleged\nestoppel arose was aware of the facts on which the common assumption\nin question was said to have been based (seeChitty\non Contractsvol 1 at para 3–109;HIH\nCasualty & General Insurance v Axa Corporate Solutions[2002] All ER (Comm)\n1053). [emphasis in original] 49     On\nthe evidence before me, I find that Lim’s Actions and omissions between\nApril 2009 and June 2010 were consistent with the presence of a shared\nassumption that Lim’s salary had been reduced to $50,000. Both parties\nshared and Acted on an assumed and incorrect state of fact,ie, that Lim had agreed or at least acquiesced\nto the reduction of her monthly salary. 50     The\nActions and omissions which, I find, establish the presence of a shared\nassumption, are as follows: (a)     Lim\nhad failed to raise any objection when Maurice Choo informed shareholders\nat the AGM on 2 May 2009 that Lim had agreed to her Service Agreement\nbeing reviewed by the board; (b)     Lim\ndid not raise any objection to being paid $50,000 per month during\nthe period from May 2009 to June 2010 when she was, as she claims,\nstill entitled to $60,000 per month. At trial, Lim conceded that she\n“had many opportunities to register [her] position on the shortfall in\nsalary”. However, she maintained that she was “not in the frame\nof mind at that time”. When pressed further, she then said that\nher main concern at that point in time was the shareholder dispute\nwithin Singapore HealthPartners. In the end, she admitted that the\nissue regarding her salary had nothing to do with the shareholder\ndispute and would have had no implication for the dispute; (c)     during\nthe period from May 2009 to June 2010, Lim had co-signed the Authorisation\nLetters for submission to DBS providing for herself to be paid a\nmonthly salary of $49,662 (her monthly salary of $50,000 less deductions\nfor Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) and Chinese Development Assistance\nCouncil Fund (“CDAC Fund”). In addition, Lim had prepared a revised\nbudget in which her salary was recorded as $50,000; (d)     lastly,\nin the course of settlement negotiations in 2010 which led to the\neventual Settlement Agreement, Lim had sought compensation of $600,000\n(being 12 months’ of her revised salary of $50,000). It is apparent\nfrom the exchange of e-mails between Lim’s solicitor and the opposing\nsolicitor that both parties had shared and Acted on an assumed and\nincorrect state of fact,ie, Lim\nhad agreed or at least acquiesced to the reduction of her monthly\nsalary. For instance, Lim’s solicitor, in an e-mail to the opposing\nsolicitor, noted that: [Lim’s] engagement as [Executive Director]\nand her remuneration were discussed at the Board meeting. When Maurice\nChoo took over as Chairman, these issues were once again tabled\nto the ‘new’ Board who all approved it, save and except for her\nsalary which was reduced from $60,000 to $50,000 per month. 51     In\nthe circumstances, I also find that it is unjust and unconscionable for\nLim to go back on the shared assumption. I agree with the passage\ninCredit Suisse v Borough Council of Allerdale[1995]\n1 Lloyd’s Rep 315 at 367 cited by counsel for Singapore HealthPartners: The basis for that unconscionability is\nthat the party said to be estopped would otherwise be allowed to\nadopt a position which was inconsistent with that which he had previously\nled the other party to believe was common ground. There would therefore\nbe both inconsistency of conduct and potential prejudice from that\ninconsistency which is the essence of estoppel by whatever name\nit is known: SeeAmalgamated Investment &\nProperty Co. Ltd., sup., at p. 121 per Lord Denning,\nM.R. [emphasis added] 52     In\nour case, as counsel for Singapore HealthPartners submits, the unconscionability\narises as Singapore HealthPartners was not given a chance to address\nthe issue of the alleged short-payment of Lim’s salary between May\n2009 and June 2010. At trial, Lim conceded that had she complained\nabout her salary, Singapore HealthPartners might not have signed\nthe Settlement Agreement. As such, it is unconscionable for Lim\nto now resile from the shared assumption and rely on her strict\nlegal rights. 53     For\nthe aforementioned reasons, I dismiss Lim’s claim that she is entitled\nto $140,000 in “short-paid” salary. Lim’s pro-rated salary for July\n2010 54     Singapore\nHealthPartners does not dispute Lim’s entitlement to a pro-rated\nsalary for July 2010. However, it disputes the quantum of that entitlement.\nIn coming to a finding as to the quantum, I am required to address\nthe Excess Payment Issue and the Excess Leave Issue. (1)   The Excess Payment\nIssue 55     On\nor about 13 April 2009, Lim co-signed an Authorisation Letter for submission\nto DBS mandating payment to herself of an amount of $59,662 (this\nbeing the monthly salary of $60,000 less the $338 contribution to\nthe CPF and the CDAC Fund) for April 2009. 56     Given\nmy finding that Lim did not agree to the reduction in salary, it follows\nthat she did not overpay herself by $10,000 for April 2009. It was only\nin May 2009 that the estoppel by convention/common assumption arose. (2)   The Excess Leave\nIssue 57     Clause\n5.1 of Lim’s Service Agreement (“Clause 5.1”) stated that: The Appointee shall be entitled during\nthe continuance of this Agreement, without loss of remuneration\nto thirty (30) business days leave a year (in addition to public\nholidays as gazetted in Singapore) to be taken at such time or times\nas may be approved by the Board.The Appointee\nshall not be entitled to carry forward the balance of any unconsumed\nleave. [emphasis added] 58     It\nis undisputed that between 1 January 2010 and 25 July 2010, Lim took\n27 days of leave. Singapore HealthPartners’ claims, however, that\nfor the period between 1 January 2010 and 25 July 2010, Lim was\nonly entitled to 17 pro-rated days of leave; the 30 days of leave\nprovided for in Clause 5.1 being for a year’s service. She had thus\ntaken ten days of excess leave for which she is liable to reimburse\nSingapore HealthPartners. 59     On\nthe other hand, Lim argues that: (a)     There\nis no legal basis for Singapore HealthPartners’ claim to compensation\nfor leave taken in excess of entitlement; (b)     The\n27 days of leave taken by Lim by 25 July 2010 was her entitlement\nunder Clause 5.1; and (c)     Singapore\nHealthPartners had agreed with Lim to allow her to carry forward\nher excess leave of 25.5 days from 2008 and 2009. 60     I\nfind that Singapore HealthPartners had not agreed with Lim to allow her\nto carry forward her excess leave from 2008 and 2009. Lim alleged\nthat there was an oral agreement between Djeng and herself which\npermitted her to carry forward her unconsumed leave for 2008. She\nalso alleged that this oral agreement was evidenced in writing by\na letter from Djeng to herself dated 31 December 2008 (“the Leave\nLetter”). 61     However,\nI am not convinced that the Leave Letter exists. Firstly, the Leave\nLetter was not mentioned in Lim’s Statement of Claim. Instead, Lim pleaded\nan oral agreement. In February 2011, Lim then belatedly sought discovery\nof the Leave Letter. Singapore HealthPartners explained that it had\nno such document in its possession. At trial Lim omitted to call\nDjeng as a witness to prove the existence of the Leave Letter. 62     Secondly,\nan e-mail dated 24 November 2009 sent on Lim’s behalf to the board\nto request approval to carry forward her leave in 2009, made no mention\nof the Leave Letter. Had the Leave Letter existed, Lim would naturally\nhave referred to it in the e-mail. As Lim conceded during cross-examination,\nno director on the board had consented to Lim’s request. As such,\nher excess leave from 2008 and 2009 was forfeited in accordance\nwith Clause 5.1. 63     In\nmy view, a term ought to be implied into the Service Agreement to allow\nSingapore HealthPartners to claim against Lim for leave taken in excess\nof entitlement. To hold otherwise would,in\nextremis, allow an employee to take 30 days leave after\nhaving served the employer for a few days, and after such leave,\nto quit the employment with impunity. 64     While\nemployers often allow employees to take leave in advance of entitlement,\nthis is done on the premise that the employee will complete that\nyear’s service. In Lim’s case, she took her leave entitlement in\nadvance without subsequently completing that year of service. It\ncould not have been the intention of the parties to allow Lim to\ndo so. 65     I\nthus find that the pro-rated salary for July 2010 owed to Lim is $23,884.22,\nthe breakdown of which is as follows: S/NoItemAmount1Salary from 1 July to 25 July 2010 (calculated on the basis\nof S$50,000 per month)$40,322.582Less: Her leave taken in\nexcess of entitlement$16,438.36Net Salary Payable to Lim for July 2010$23,884.22",
        "Singapore HealthPartners’ claims": "The Waiver, Release and Discharge\nIssue 66     In\nregard to Singapore HealthPartners’ counterclaims, Lim asserts that\nSingapore HealthPartners had “waived, released and discharged” Lim from\nsuch claims by virtue of cl 10.7 of the Settlement Agreement (“Clause 10.7”).\nClause 10.7 states: [Lim] shall execute and deliver to the\nCompany theLSH Undertakingupon the\nexecution of this Agreement.The Company and\neach and every Shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally waives,\nreleases and discharges [Lim] of and from any and all Claims which\nany of them has or may have against [Lim] arising from and/or in\nconnection with any of the agreements, deeds, contracts, and/or\ntransactions referred to in the LSH Undertaking (the ‘Disclosed Transactions’)\nand/or any Act or omission of [Lim] as director and Executive Director\nof the Company with respect to the Disclosed Transactions.Each\nShareholder hereby acknowledges, and irrevocably and unconditionally directs\nthe Company to grant the waiver, release and discharge by the Company\nset out in this Clause 10.7. [emphasis added] 67     The\nDisclosed Transactions are set out in the LSH Undertaking in Schedule\n5 of the Settlement Agreement as follows: (a)the Facility Agreement, the Profit Sharing Agreement, the\nSecurity Trust Agreement and Deed of Subordination dated 18 December\n2007 between the Company and United Overseas Bank Limited; (b)the Building Agreement dated 27 December\n2007 between the Company and Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore; (c)the Hotel Technical Services Agreement\ndated 24 March 2008 between the Company and Rendezvous Hotels International\nPte. Limited; (d)the sale and purchase agreements for\nthe sale and purchase of medical suites from the Company; and (e)any other contract(s) or transaction(s)\nwhich had been expressly approved pursuant to written resolutions\nduly passed by the Board of Directors of the Company or referred\nto in the audited accounts of the Company or disclosed to the Board\nof Directors of the Company as set out in the document captioned\n“Handover Contract Documents” attached to this Warranty and Undertaking. 68     Essentially,\nthe intention of Clause 10.7 was to release, waive and discharge\nLim from any claims arising from or in connection with two classes\nof transactions: (a)     Agreements,\ndeeds, contracts, and/or transactions referred to in the LSH Undertaking\n(“the Disclosed Transactions”); and/or (b)     Any\nAct or omission of LSH as director and Executive Director of the\nCompany with respect to the Disclosed Transactions (“acts or omissions\nwith respect to the Disclosed Transactions”). 69     Singapore\nHealthPartners submits that Clause 10.7 does not preclude them from\nbringing any of the counterclaims against Lim as the subject matter\nof the counterclaims does not fall within any of the Disclosed Transactions. 70     I\nwill first proceed to consider whether Singapore HealthPartners’ counterclaims\nare covered by Clause 10.7. If so, the counterclaims failin limine. If not, I will then proceed\nto address the counterclaims on their merits. (1)   Clause 10.7 in relation\nto the alleged unauthorised trips (A)   “Disclosed transactions” 71     Lim\ngave evidence that the Thailand trip was a business trip to review the\nimplementation of certain hospital software (“the Amalga Software) which\nSingapore HealthPartners was keen on acquiring for the Project.\nOn 11 March 2009, a substantial report prepared by Lim Kah Chuan\n(“the Amalga Report”) was e-mailed to the board of Singapore HealthPartners. Eventually,\non 6 November 2009, Singapore HealthPartners signed a contract with\nMicrosoft Amalga to obtain the Amalga Software (the “Microsoft Amalga\nAgreement” listed in the Handover Contract Documents). As such,\nLim argues that it is “clear from the evidence adduced that the\nThailand trip was for the purpose of understanding and acquiring\nthe Amalga [S]oftware for the Project and benefited [Singapore HealthPartners]”. 72     In\nregard to the New Zealand trip, Lim gave evidence that it was a business\ntrip to study the architectural, mechanical and electrical engineering\naspects of a new hospital building in Auckland organised by Singapore\nHealthPartners’ mechanical and electrical engineering consultants,\nBeca Carter Holling & Ferner Ltd (“Beca Carter”). Lim made this\ntrip together with Djeng, five representatives from DP Architects\nand a representative from Beca Carter. Eventually, on 23 March 2009,\nSingapore HealthPartners signed a contract with Beca Carter appointing\nBeca Carter as its Mechanical and Electrical Engineers (“the M&E\nAgreement”). 73     In\naddition, Lim relied on the item listed as “travelling and entertainment\nexpenses” in the Detailed Income Statement within Singapore HealthPartners’\nReports and Financial Statements for the period from 1 July 2007\nto 31 December 2008 to argue that the Thailand trip (as well as\nthe New Zealand trip) ... [had] clearly been accounted for in\nthe ‘audited accounts of the Company’ under\nthe LSH Undertaking and [Singapore HealthPartners had] clearly waived,\nreleased and discharged [Lim] in relation to any claims resulting from\nthese trips. 74     Singapore\nHealthPartners submit that this argument is fallacious and that\nthe said item listed as “travelling and entertainment expenses”\ncould not be treated as reference to “contract(s) or transaction(s)\nreferred to in the audited accounts of the Company”. It argues that\nthe “travelling and entertainment expenses” in the 2008 audited\naccounts were merely: ... a reference to a general category of\nexpenses incurred by [Singapore HealthPartners] for the period of\n1 July 2007 to 31 December 2008 ... [and are] buried as part of\nthe overall travelling and entertainment expenses of [Singapore\nHealthPartners]. ... It therefore submits that Clause 10.7 does not apply to the\nalleged unauthorised trips. 75     In\nmy view, the alleged unauthorised trips could not qualify as Disclosed\nTransactions merely because the Detailed Income Statement within\nSingapore HealthPartners’ Reports and Financial Statements contains\nan item listed as “travelling and entertainment expenses”. To my mind,\nfor the trips to have been “referred to in the audited accounts”,\nthey need to have been specifically mentioned in the Detailed Income\nStatement. However, such detail was lacking in the Detailed Income\nStatement. Instead, as Singapore HealthPartners argued, they were\n“buried as part of the overall travelling and entertainment expenses\nof [Singapore HealthPartners]”. 76     Nevertheless,\nI am of the opinion that the counterclaims based on the alleged\nunauthorised trips would still fail as they are “acts or omissions\nof [Lim] ... with respect to the Disclosed Transactions” within\nthe scope of Clause 10.7. (b)   “Acts or omissions\nwith respect to the Disclosed Transactions” 77     It\nis not disputed that the Microsoft Amalga Agreement is listed under\nthe Handover Contract Documents and hence is one of the Disclosed Transactions\nfor the purposes of Clause 10.7. It is also not disputed that the M&E\nAgreement is a Disclosed Transaction.Therefore,\neven if the trips themselves are not Disclosed Transactions for\nthe purposes of Clause 10.7, they can still fall under Clause 10.7\nif the trips were either an Act or omission of LSH as director and\nExecutive Director of the Company with respect to the Disclosed\nTransactions. (I)   Thailand trip 78     In\nmy view, the Thailand trip would be an Act or omission with respect\nto the Microsoft Amalga Agreement, if it had any causal link to\nthe said agreement. According to the evidence of Singapore HealthPartners,\nthe board was not informed of the Thailand trip despite the fact\nthat there were board meetings in September, October and November\n2008. In fact, the board only found out about the trip on or about\nFebruary 2008 when Tan Soon Hoe chanced upon certain documents.\nIt was only after the board had found out about the hitherto-undisclosed\nThailand trip that the board received the Amalga Report. 79     Singapore\nHealthPartners took the position that it had found the Amalga Report\nto be of no real value, and that subsequently, Maurice Choo had,\ntogether with James Woo, undertaken the responsibility of evaluating the\nviability of acquiring the Amalga Software for the Project. According\nto Maurice’s Choo evidence, the Amalga Report was based on a quotation\nof $9,487,000. It was only after his efforts that it obtained a\nquotation of $4,406,400 from Microsoft. In effect, Maurice Choo\ntold the court that James Woo and he had negotiated the reduction\nin the price of the Amalga Software from $9,487,000 to $4,406,400. 80     However,\nI had difficulty with the evidence of Maurice Choo in this regard.\nDuring cross-examination, when Maurice Choo was taken through Microsoft’s\nproposal in the Amalga Report where the quotation in exhibit A of\nMicrosoft’s proposal added up to $4,406,400, he was unable to explain why\nhe had taken the position that the Amalga Report was based on a quotation\nfor $9,487,000. Clearly, this shows that, contrary to the position taken\nby Singapore HealthPartners, the Amalga Report had been of some value\nto Singapore HealthPartners as it contained a competitive quotation from\nMicrosoft (which Maurice Choo and James Woo tried to claim credit for). 81     As\nsuch, this suggests that the Thailand trip and the Amalga Report had\nsome bearing on the eventual signing of the Microsoft Amalga Agreement.\nI thus find that the Thailand trip was taken with a view to the said\nAgreement. The Thailand trip is therefore covered by Clause 10.7\nas it was an Act with respect to the Microsoft Amalga Agreement. (II)   New Zealand trip 82     Similarly,\nthe New Zealand trip was also related to the M&E Agreement signed\non 23 March 2009. Lim adduced sufficient evidence to prove that\nthe New Zealand trip was organised by Beca Carter and was for the\npurpose of studying the architectural, mechanical and electrical engineering\naspects. For this reason, I find that the New Zealand trip was linked\nto the M&E Agreement. 83     Accordingly,\nthe counterclaim with regard to the unauthorised trips fails. (2)   Clause 10.7 in relation\nto contracts between Wizvision and Singapore HealthPartners 84     Wizvision,\na company providing information technology services, had entered\ninto three contracts with Singapore HealthPartners: (a)     An\nOffice/Server Desktop Solution contract signed in November 2007; (b)     An\nIT System Maintenance Support contract signed in January 2008 for\nthe period for the period 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009; and (c)     An\nIT System Maintenance Support contract signed for the period 1 April\n2009 to 31 March 2010. 85     Singapore\nHealthPartners contend that Lim did not disclose the full extent\nof her direct and indirect interests in Wizvision, in effect breaching her\nobligation of disclosure under s 156(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev\nEd) (“the Act”) and under general law. At this juncture, I should state\nthat s 156(1) of the Act imposes a statutory duty of disclosure\non directors but otherwise has little bearing on this civil Action;\ns 156(9) specifically provides that the Section is in addition to\nand not in derogation of the operation of any rule of law. 86     Lim’s\ninterest in Wizvision comprised: (a)     a\n17% direct stake in Wizvision; (b)     a\n15.59% indirect stake in Wizvision through Hua Jie Pte Ltd; and (c)     her\ndirectorship of Wizvision since 7 April 2000; Her son, Lim Kong Wee, was a director of Wizvision from 7 December 2007.\nAnother son, Lim Wee Kiat, had an indirect stake of 0.12% in Wizvision\nthrough Hua Jie Pte Ltd. 87     Although\nunder s 156(8) of the Act, for the purposes of disclosure of a director’s\ninterest in a transaction with the company, an interest of a member\nof the director’s family is to be treated as the director’s interest,\nno authority was cited to me that the position is the same under\ncommon law. However, it is not necessary for me to decide on this\nissue because, in any event, Lim failed to disclose her own indirect\ninterest in a 15.59% stake in Wizvision held through Hua Jie Pte\nLtd. 88     Lim\ninsists that but for an “honest oversight in not disclosing her indirect\nstake in Wizvision through Hua Jie Pte Ltd”, she had provided disclosure\nof her interest in Wizvision prior to Singapore HealthPartners engaging\nWizvision. In any event, Lim argues that these contracts were referred\nto in the audited accounts of Singapore HealthPartners and, as such,\nare “Disclosed Transactions” covered by Clause 10.7 so that no Act\nor omission on her part (as a director of Singapore HealthPartners)\nwith respect to these contracts could found a claim by Singapore\nHealthPartners against her. 89     However,\nSingapore HealthPartners points out that when the Settlement Agreement\nwas signed on 12 July 2010, the audited accounts only covered accounts\nup till the year ended 31 December 2008. As such, Singapore HealthPartners\ncontends that contracts entered into or subsisting between Wizvision\nand Singapore HealthPartners after 31 December 2008 are not covered\nby Clause 10.7 as they are not “referred to in the audited accounts\nof the Company”. Moreover, Singapore HealthPartners takes the position\nthat Clause 10.7 is operative only to the extent of her disclosed\ninterests in Wizvision. 90     It\nis trite law that a director occupies a fiduciary office. As such,\na director is not to place himself or herself in a position where\nhis or her duty and interest conflict. According to the learned\nauthors of Walter Woon on Company Law (Sweet & Maxwell, Revised\n3rdEd, 2009) (“Walter\nWoon on Company Law”) at para 8.38, the no profit rule\nposits that a fiduciary may not obtain a profit in connection with\nhis position without the informed consent of the person he is bound\nto protect. Therefore: ... unless he has provided full disclosure\nand obtained the informed consent of the company, a director who\nacquires a benefit in connection with his office is accountable\nto the company for that benefit. (Walter Woon on Company Law at\npara 8.39). 91     Traditionally,\nthe law has always taken a very strict approach where conflicts\nof interest are concerned. Lord Herschell inGeorge\nBray v John Rawlinson Ford[1896] AC 44 at 51 said that: It is an inflexible rule of a Court of\nEquity that a person in a fiduciary position ... is not, unless\notherwise expressly provided, entitled to make a profit; he is not\nallowed to put himself in a position where his interest and duty\nconflict. It does not appear to me that this rule is, as has been\nsaid, founded upon principles of morality. I regard it rather as\nbased on the consideration that, human nature being what it is,\nthere is a danger, in such circumstances, of the person holding\na fiduciary position being swayed by interest rather than by duty,\nand thus prejudicing those whom he was bound to protect. It has therefore\nbeen deemed expedient to lay down this positive rule. 92     As\nsuch, where a director has failed to make full disclosure and to obtain\nthe informed consent of the company, the company may seek disgorgement\nof any profits that the director makes from the transaction (Walter Woon on Company Lawat para 8.42). 93     However\nas noted by the learned authors ofWalter Woon\non Company Law, just as a natural person may validly\nrelease another party from liability, a company may similarly do\nso. The members of a company may release a director from his fiduciary\nduty by agreement: seeNew Zealand Netherlands\nSociety ‘Oranje’ Incorporated v Kuys[1973] 2 All ER 1222\n(Privy Council on appeal from New Zealand). The members of the company\nmay also ratify and adopt an Act of the directors which would otherwise\nbe a breach of their fiduciary duty: seeWalter\nWoon on Company Lawat para 9.18 and the authorities\ntherein cited.Walter Woonconcludes\nthat: ... Notwithstandingdictato\nthe contrary by some English judges, the general rule is that if\nthe directors have exercised their powers irregularly, or Acted without\nproper authority or Acted from improper motives, they can by full and\nfrank disclosure of all material facts to the members obtain absolution and\nforgiveness of their sins. 94     I\nam of the view that the first two contracts referred to in[84]above (“the first two Wizvision\ncontracts”) are within the scope of Clause 10.7 since they were\n“referred to in the audited accounts of the Company” for the year\nended 31 December 2008. It does not matter that the second of these\ncontracts, namely, the IT System Maintenance Support contract signed\nin January 2008 continued to have effect beyond 31 December 2008. 95     In\ncontrast, the third contract referred to in[84]above,\nnamely, the IT System Maintenance Support contract for the period\n1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 (“the third contract”) falls outside\nthe scope of Clause 10.7 since the latest audited accounts of Singapore\nHealthPartners at the time of the Settlement Agreement were the\naudited accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008 and therefore\ncould not have referred to the third contract. 96     I\nam also of the view that, in so far as the first two Wizvision contracts are\nconcerned, Clause 10.7 is effective in releasing Lim from liability\nfor inadequate disclosure of her interest in Wizvision to the shareholders\nof Singapore HealthPartners. The Settlement Agreement containing\nClause 10.7 was signed by Singapore HealthPartners and all its shareholders. Clause\n10.7 states: ... The Company and each and every Shareholder\nirrevocably andunconditionallywaives,\nreleases and discharges LSH of and from any and all Claims which\nany of them hasor may have...\nEach Shareholder hereby acknowledges, and irrevocably and unconditionally\ndirects the Company to grant the waiver, release and discharge by\nthe Company set out in this Clause 10.7. [emphasis added] To my mind, Singapore HealthPartners, together with all its\nshareholders, intended to “irrevocably and unconditionally” release\nLim from any and all claims in connection with the two Wizvision\ncontracts falling within the scope of Clause 10.7, even if such\nclaims arose out of a breach of Lim’s fiduciary duty of disclosure. 97     To\nbegin with, it is not in evidence whether at the time the Settlement Agreement\nwas signed the shareholders knew of Lim’s partial failure to disclose\nher interest. From Singapore HealthPartners’ case, it is obvious that,\nat some point in time, Singapore HealthPartners became aware of Lim’s\nundisclosed interest in Wizvision. But when did it become aware? When\nLim, in her Reply to the Defence and Counterclaim, invoked Clause 10.7,\nthere was no reply at all from Singapore HealthPartners. It would appear\nthat the latter had not thought to challenge Lim’s invocation of Clause\n10.7 on the ground that there had been lack of informed consent\nto the release in Clause 10.7. 98     In\nany event, the Settlement Agreement should be construed in the context\nin which it was signed. From the middle of 2009, the shareholders and\ndirectors of Singapore HealthPartners were split into two factions,\nand the dispute between the two factions resulted in several arbitral\nand court proceedings. Eventually, the two factions concluded that\nthe best way of resolving the dispute was for one side to buy the\nother out on the terms of the Settlement Agreement. In this context,\nit can reasonably be inferred that the intention of the parties\nin signing the Settlement Agreement was to wipe the slate clean\nby releasing Lim from all claims within the scope of Clause 10.7\nwithout any qualification. 99     The\nwording of Clause 10.7 supports my view. Clause 10.7 states that each\nand every shareholder of Singapore HealthPartners “irrevocably andunconditionally” releases Lim from “any\nand all Claims which any of them has ormay\nhave”. The release is clearly not given on the condition\nthat Lim had given full and frank disclosure of any breaches of\nher fiduciary duty. In addition, Clause 10.7 contemplates both present\nclaims which the shareholders are aware of and claims which they\n“may have” in the future but are currently not aware of. 100    As\nsuch, I am of the view that Clause 10.7 is effective in releasing\nLim from any liability to the Company arising from her failure to\ndisclose fully her interest in Wizvision under the first two Wizvision\ncontracts. Accordingly, the counterclaim with regard to the first\ntwo Wizvision contracts fails but that with respect to the third\nsucceeds.",
        "Conclusion": "101    In\nsummary, notwithstanding my finding that Lim did not agree to a reduction\nin her monthly salary on 27 March 2009, I find that Lim is estopped\nfrom enforcing her strict legal right to the short-paid salary from May\n2009 to June 2010. As the estoppel arose only from May 2009 onwards, I\nfind that she did not overpay herself by $10,000 in respect of her\nsalary for April 2009. Singapore HealthPartners’ counterclaim in\nrespect of the $10,000 overpayment therefore fails. 102    With\nregard to Lim’s claim for her pro-rated salary for July 2010, I find\nthat Lim had taken ten days in excess of her leave entitlement for 2010\nfor which Singapore HealthPartners ought to be credited with $16,438.36.\nLim’s claim is thus allowed in part in the sum of $23,884.22, together\nwith interest at the rate of 5.33% from the date of the termination of\nLim’s Service Agreement. 103    In\nregard to Singapore HealthPartners’ other counterclaims, I find that\nthose in respect of the Thailand and New Zealand trips are within\nthe scope of Clause 10.7 and are therefore dismissed. In addition,\nI find that Singapore HealthPartners and its shareholders had agreed\nunder Clause 10.7 to release and absolve Lim from any and all claims\narising from any Act or omission with respect to the first two Wizvision\ncontracts. Accordingly, the claim arising from Lim’s alleged failure\nto disclose her interest in the first two Wizvision contracts is\ndismissed. In regard to the third contract, I order an account and\ninquiry before the Registrar as to Lim’s profits therefrom and payment\nto Singapore HealthPartners of all sums found to be due and owing\non the taking of the account, together with interest at the rate\nof 5.33% from the date of filing of the Defence and Counterclaim\nherein. 104    I\nwill hear the parties on costs."
