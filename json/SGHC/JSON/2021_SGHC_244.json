        "Introduction": "1 Party A commences court proceedings against, among others, party B in jurisdiction X. In those proceedings, party A alleges,inter alia, minority oppression by party B. Party B, in response, applies for an anti-suit injunction in Singapore to restrain party A from prosecuting the court proceedings in X on the basis that those proceedings are brought in breach of an arbitration agreement requiring all disputes between them to be arbitrated in Singapore. Party A contends that the claims made by it in the court proceedings in X are non-arbitrable under the laws of X (which party A asserts is theproper law governingthe arbitration agreement) and thus, those proceedings are not brought in breach of the arbitration agreement. On the other hand, party B contends that the claims are arbitrable under Singapore law as thelaw of thearbitral seatand thus, the court proceedings brought by party A are in breach of the parties’ arbitration agreement, thereby warranting the grant by this court of an anti-suit injunction. 2 What then is the system of law that should govern, at the pre-award stage, the question of whether the claims brought by party A are, or are not, arbitrable? Is it the proper law governing the arbitration agreement (as contended by party A) or the law of the seat,ie, Singapore law (as contended by party B)?  This threshold question lies at the heart of the applications before me. I am informed by counsel for the parties that it is a question that has hitherto not been decided by our courts. It would also appear from the leading arbitration commentaries referred to by counsel during the hearing that whilst some civil law jurisdictions have had occasion to consider this issue, it has not been addressed by any of the courts in the Commonwealth. 3 In HC/OS 242/2021 (“OS 242”), the plaintiff, Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings, seeks a permanent anti-suit injunction against the defendant, Mr Anupam Mittal. The primary reliefs sought by the plaintiff are an injunction to restrain the defendant, his agents or otherwise from: (a) pursuing, continuing and/or proceeding with the action(s) commenced or to be commenced by the defendant by way of a company petition in the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) in Mumbai, India, which was served on the plaintiff on 3 March 2021; and/or (b) commencing or procuring the commencement of any legal proceedings in respect of any dispute, controversy, claim or disagreement of any kind in connection with or relating to the management of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“People Interactive”), or in connection with or relating to any of the matters set out in the Shareholders’ Agreement dated 10 February 2006, as amended from time to time (the “SHA”) in any other dispute resolution forum other than an arbitration tribunal constituted in accordance with the rules laid down by the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) and seated in Singapore in accordance with cl 20.2 of the SHA against the plaintiff, and/or Shobitha Annie Mani and/or Navin Mittal and/or Anand Mittal and/or People Interactive and/or any person in relation to any dispute relating to the management of People Interactive, or arising from, connected with or relating to any of the matters set out in the SHA. 4 The defendant in turn seeks an order in HC/SUM 1477/2021 (“SUM 1477”) to set aside or discharge anexparteinterim injunction order (HC/ORC 1463/2021) (“ORC 1463”) granted by the High Court against the defendant on 15 March 2021 in HC/SUM 1183/2021 (“SUM 1183”); the defendant argues that the plaintiff should not have proceeded with SUM 1183exparteand there was material non-disclosure by the plaintiff at theexpartehearing which took place before Andrew Ang SJ. 5 As I heard OS 242 on aninterpartesbasis with full arguments presented by both sides, it is not necessary for me to deal separately with the defendant’s application in SUM 1477. In OS 242, the issue before me is whether a permanent anti-suit injunction should be granted. If I allow OS 242, whether theexparteinjunction should be set aside is rendered moot. Conversely, if I dismiss OS 242, theexparteinjunction must also fall away and would consequently be set aside, irrespective of whether the plaintiff should have proceededexparteor whether there was any material non-disclosure. I therefore focus on OS 242. 6 In essence, the plaintiff argues that the defendant has breached the arbitration agreement in the SHA by raising disputes “relating to the management of [People Interactive] or relating to any of the matters set out in [the SHA]” before the NCLT despite being contractually bound to submit such disputes to arbitration seated in Singapore.1Foot Note 1×Plaintiff’s written submissions dated 22 April 2021 (“PWS”) at para 7.The defendant, on the other hand, argues that the disputes and the claims before the NCLT pertain to oppression and mismanagement under Indian law and the natural, proper and competent forum for the adjudication of such disputes is the NCLT.2Foot Note 2×Defendant’s written submissions dated 22 April 2021 (“DWS”) at para 4. 7 In order to determine if the claims raised by the defendant before the NCLT are indeed brought in breach of the arbitration agreement in the SHA, this court has to first decide whether the claims are arbitrable in Singapore as the arbitral seat. The answer to that question turns on the consideration of a further threshold anterior question - which system of law governs the issue of determining subject matter arbitrability at thepre-award stage? Is it the law of the seat or the proper law of the arbitration agreement? 8 As I mentioned above at [2], it appears that there is no local authority on the point and sparse authority elsewhere addressing this specific question; unfortunately, neither is there any international consensus on the correct approach. As observed in Gary Born,International Commercial Arbitration(Kluwer Law International, 3rd ed, 2021) (“International Commercial Arbitration”) at p 639, “[t]he nonarbitrability doctrine raises potentially complex choice-of-law questions in determining what law(s) apply to determine whether a claim or dispute is nonarbitrable. There is little agreement among national courts and commentators on the resolution of this issue”. As such, I take the opportunity to consider this question in greater detail in this judgment. I start by summarising the background facts to the extent that they are material in laying down the context in relation to the present matter.",
        "Facts": "9 The plaintiff is a private equity fund incorporated under the laws of Mauritius. It holds 30.96% of the authorised, issued and paid-up share capital of People Interactive, a private limited company registered in Mumbai which carries on the business of providing various value-added and internet-related services. Amongst other things, People Interactive owns and operates a well-known online and offline matrimonial service called “shaadi.com” (“Shaadi.com”). Shaadi.com was co-founded by the defendant and his cousins, Anand Mittal (“Anand”) and Navin Mittal (“Navin”), both of whom were among the initial shareholders of People Interactive, together with the defendant. The defendant is an Indian resident and the Managing Director of People Interactive from 30 November 2004 to 30 November 2019. According to the plaintiff, the defendant holds 43.85% of the authorised, issued and paid-up share capital of People Interactive. The defendant asserts that on a “fully diluted basis”, the plaintiff’s shareholding in People Interactive is 44.38%, Anand’s is 13.13% and his 30.26%.3Foot Note 3×Shobitha Annie Mani 1st affidavit dated 17 March 2021 (“1SAM”) at paras 10 to 11, 13; Anupam Mittal affidavit dated 30 March 2021 (“1AM”) at paras 10 to 13. 10 On 10 February 2006, the plaintiff, the defendant, People Interactive, Anand and Navin entered into the SHA. The SHA sets out,inter alia, the rights and obligations of the shareholders and their rights regarding the management of People Interactive. In the SHA, the plaintiff, the defendant, Anand and Navin are referred to individually as the “Founder” and collectively as the “Founders”.4Foot Note 4×1SAM at p 177.On 7 May 2008, the parties to the SHA signed the First Supplementary Subscription-Cum-Shareholders’ Agreement (“SSSA”) with SVB India Capital Partners LP, SVB Financial Group and the plaintiff (then Sequoia Capital India Investment Holdings II). Clause 20.2 of the SHA and cl 10.2 of the SSSA contain identical arbitration clauses providing for arbitration to be seated in Singapore in accordance with the ICC Rules.5Foot Note 5×1SAM at paras 14 to 15; 1AM at para 26.The dispute resolution clause in cl 20 of the SHA is reproduced below: 20 GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION 20.1 This Agreement and its performance shall be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of the Republic of India.In the event of a dispute relating to the management of the Company or relating to any of the matters set out in this Agreement, parties to the dispute shall each appoint one nominee/representative who shall discuss in good faith to resolve the difference. In case the difference is not settled within 30 calendar days, it shall be referred to arbitration in accordance with Clause 20.2 below. 20.2All such disputes that have not been satisfactorily resolved under Clause 20.1 above shall be referred to arbitration before a sole arbitrator to be jointly appointed by the Parties.In the event the Parties are unable to agree on a sole arbitrator, one of the arbitrators shall be appointed jointly by the Founders and the second arbitrator will be appointed by [the plaintiff] and the third arbitrator will be appointed by the other two arbitrators jointly.The arbitration proceedings shall be carried out in accordance with the rules laid down by International Chambers of Commerce and the place of arbitration shall be Singapore.The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in the English language. The parties shall equally share the costs of the arbitrator’s fees, but shall bear the costs of their own legal counsel engaged for the purposes of the arbitration. … [Emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 11 The parties’ relationship began to deteriorate from 2017.6Foot Note 6×1SAM at para 52; 1AM at para 32.Clause 16.3 of the SHA provides for the plaintiff’s right to appoint and remove two directors on People’s Interactive’s board of directors. Clause 3.4 of the SHA envisaged that People Interactive was to complete an initial public offering (“IPO”) within five years from closing (as defined in the SHA). If People Interactive failed to complete an IPO, the plaintiff would be able to exit its investment through its redemption and, if necessary, “drag along” rights as provided for in the SHA, which meant that the plaintiff could compel the Founders to sell all or part of their shares, together with the plaintiff’s shares, to the third party buyer.7Foot Note 7×1SAM at para 17.As no IPO as contemplated under the SHA was achieved, discussions began on the potential sale of People Interactive to a third party, including to an entity known as Info Edge (“Info Edge”) which was a competitor of People Interactive.8Foot Note 8×1SAM at para 57; 1AM at para 33.Disputes arose between the parties regarding,inter alia, the management of People Interactive, the composition of its board of directors, the potential sale of People Interactive and the appointment of nominee directors to the board of directors.9Foot Note 9×1SAM at paras 27 to 35, 38 to 50, 54 to 63; 1AM at paras 39, 48 to 52, 55 to 56, 71 to 72.Ms Shobitha Annie Mani (“Ms Mani”) was appointed by the plaintiff as a director on the board of directors of People Interactive on 24 April 2019,10Foot Note 10×1SAM at para 12.and the relevance of this will become apparent later on in my judgment. In very broad terms, the defendant complains that:11Foot Note 11×DWS at para 9. (a) the plaintiff colluded with other shareholders or members of the board of directors of People Interactive, including Ms Mani, to undertake a series of actions to wrest control of management of People Interactive in a manner contrary to the interests of People Interactive, including attempts by the plaintiff to flood the People Interactive board of directors with its nominees; and (b) the plaintiff colluded with Info Edge and other shareholders or members of the board of directors of People Interactive to provide Info Edge with sensitive and confidential information regarding People Interactive without having any non-disclosure obligations in place. 12 There is some contention by the parties as to the characterisation of the disputes between them. While the plaintiff says that the disputes are essentially issues relating to the exercise of contractual rights under various provisions of the SHA, the defendant instead contends that the disputes pertain to minority oppression and mismanagement under Indian law.12Foot Note 12×PWS at para 20; DWS at para 4. 13 On 3 March 2021, the defendant filed and served the NCLT petition on the plaintiff.13Foot Note 13×1SAM at para 6; DWS at para 12.At that time, no case number had yet been assigned to the petition. On or about 24 March 2021, the NCLT petition was assigned its case number,ie, Company Petition No. 92 of 2021 (“NCLT Proceedings”). In the NCLT Proceedings, the defendant is the petitioner and People Interactive, the plaintiff, Ms Mani, Anand and Navin are named as the respondents. Apart from Ms Mani, all the other parties to the NCLT Proceedings are also parties to the SHA. In the NCLT Proceedings, the defendant seeks the following:14Foot Note 14×1SAM at pp 147 to 153. (a) an injunction to restrain the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s directors, employees, servants, agents and or any person claiming through or under them, from in any manner, disrupting the management and operation of People Interactive and/or conducting the affairs of People Interactive in a manner prejudicial or oppressive to any member of People Interactive or People Interactive; (b) a declaration that the defendant’s continuation as an executive director of People Interactive, pursuant to the resolution passed by the board of directors of People Interactive at the meeting held on 28 November 2019 is valid and that all actions taken by the defendant as an executive director of People Interactive shall not be invalid; (c) an injunction to restrain the plaintiff, People Interactive and certain others, their directors, employees, servants, agents and/or any person claiming through or under them, from in any manner, whether directly or indirectly hindering and/or prohibiting the defendant from performing his functions as an executive director of People Interactive; (d) an order to direct the plaintiff, People Interactive and certain others to initiate a process for identifying and appointing a suitable, independent, non-partisan and impartial candidate in the capacity as managing director of People Interactive in a time-bound manner; and (e) certain other declarations and interim reliefs. 14 OS 242 was filed on 15 March 2021, which was after the NCLT Proceedings were filed and served on the plaintiff but before a case number had been assigned. On the same day, the plaintiff also filed SUM 1183 seeking an urgentexparteinterim anti-suit injunction against the defendant.15Foot Note 15×Agreed Bundle of Documents Volume 1 of 5 (“ABOD Vol 1”), Tab 2.Ang SJ heard SUM 1183 on the same day and made the orders in ORC 1463.16Foot Note 16×ABOD Vol 1, Tab 4.An order was also made by Ang SJ in HC/ORC 1458/2021 (“ORC 1458”), pursuant to prayer 2 of OS 242,  granting the plaintiff leave to serve OS 242 and the supporting affidavit on the defendant out of jurisdiction in India.17Foot Note 17×ABOD Vol 1, Tab 3.As I indicated above at [4], ORC 1463 is the subject of the defendant’s setting-aside application in SUM 1477, which was filed on 31 March 2021. 15 On 18 March 2021, the defendant also commenced Suit No. 7816 of 2021 in the Bombay High Court (“Suit 7816”) seeking the following orders:18Foot Note 18×1AM at para 91. (a) a declaration that the NCLT is the only competent forum to hear and decide the disputes raised in the NCLT petition; and(b) a permanent injunction restraining the plaintiff or its agents, directors, employees, servants or any person claiming through or under it from, in any manner, whether directly or indirectly; (i) enforcing the anti-suit injunction; and (ii) pursuing or continuing with OS 242 and SUM 1183 in the Singapore High Court. At this time, the Bombay High Court has yet to render a decision in respect of Suit 7816.",
        "Parties’ cases": "16 Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Thio Shen Yi SC, submits that a permanent anti-suit injunction should be granted against the defendant before the NCLT Proceedings are too far advanced. It is not disputed that a valid arbitration agreement binds the parties19Foot Note 19×PWS at para 4.and all the disputes raised in the NCLT Proceedings are disputes “relating to the management of [People Interactive] or relating to any of the matters set out in [the SHA]” and therefore are contractual and fall squarely within the scope of the arbitration agreement. Further, the defendant should not be permitted to “dress up” the disputes as oppression or mismanagement claims in order to circumvent the arbitration agreement and litigate them before the NCLT.20Foot Note 20×PWS at paras 18 to 21. 17 The plaintiff further argues that the commencement of the NCLT Proceedings by the defendant is a breach of the arbitration agreement.21Foot Note 21×PWS at paras 21 and 33 to 34.The disputes are arbitrable and the question of arbitrability is governed by the law of the seat,ie, Singapore law, where it is undisputed that even oppression and mismanagement claims are arbitrable.22Foot Note 22×PWS at para 35 to 43.Even if the law governing arbitrability is the proper law of the arbitration agreement, Singapore law would nevertheless apply.23Foot Note 23×PWS at para 44 to 52.Alternatively, even if Indian law applies as the proper law of the arbitration agreement, the pith and substance of the disputes is contractual as opposed to “dressed up” oppression and mismanagement claims, and are therefore arbitrable even under Indian law.24Foot Note 24×PWS at paras 53 to 55.Since a breach of an arbitration agreement is sufficient basis for an anti-suit injunction to be granted under Singapore law, the court should grant the plaintiff’s application and issue a permanent anti-suit injunction against the defendant.25Foot Note 25×PWS at paras 3 to 7. 18 On the other hand, counsel for the defendant, Mr Nandakumar Ponniya, submits that the court should decline to grant the permanent anti-suit injunction sought by the plaintiff, dismiss OS 242 and in turn discharge theexparteanti-suit injunction for the following reasons. First, the defendant is not amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts because he does not reside in Singapore and was not amenable to being served with proceedings out of jurisdiction. The defendant has also not submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts.26Foot Note 26×DWS at paras 27 to 32.Second, the defendant is not in breach of the arbitration agreement because the disputes relating to oppression and mismanagement do not fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. According to the defendant, the law governing the arbitration agreement is Indian law. Since the pith and substance of the NCLT Proceedings lies in minority oppression and mismanagement of People Interactive, parties could not have intended for such disputes to fall within the arbitration agreement since the arbitration agreement would be unworkable and liable to be declared void under Indian law.27Foot Note 27×DWS at paras 33 to 57.Both parties’ Indian law experts agree that the NCLT is the forum that has exclusive jurisdiction under Indian law to adjudicate on disputes relating to oppression and mismanagement and that such disputes are non-arbitrable under Indian law.28Foot Note 28×DWS at para 60.Third, in any event, the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performedvis-à-visdisputes relating to oppression and mismanagement because such disputes are non-arbitrable under Indian law.29Foot Note 29×DWS at paras 62 to 68.Fourth, the ends of justice are best served by allowing the NCLT Proceedings to continue. Otherwise, grave injustice would be caused to the defendant since any eventual award rendered in Singapore would be unenforceable in India. Injustice would also be occasioned to the defendant by reason of the plaintiff’s vexatious and oppressive conduct in commencing proceedings before the Singapore High Court, as the arbitration agreement does not bind all parties to the dispute while the NCLT Proceedings will and the NCLT is the natural, proper and competent forum to hear the dispute.30Foot Note 30×DWS at paras 74 to 99.",
        "The issues": "19 From the parties’ submissions, the following issues arise for my consideration in OS 242: (a) whether the disputes between the parties are arbitrable;(b) whether the bringing of the claims by the defendant before the NCLT is in breach of the arbitration agreement; and(c) whether the court should grant the permanent anti-suit injunction sought by the plaintiff.",
        "First issue: Whether the disputes between the parties are arbitrable": "20 I begin by first determining whether the disputes between the parties are arbitrable. As stated by the Court of Appeal inTomolugenHoldings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals[2016] 1 SLR 373 (“TomolugenHoldings”) (at [72]–[74]), arbitrability may be relevant to an arbitration at both its initial and terminal stages. At the initial stage, under s 6(2) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”), the court may refuse a stay of court proceedings in favour of arbitration where the dispute concerns a non-arbitrable subject matter. The arbitration agreement would, in such circumstances, be either “inoperative” or “incapable of being performed” in relation to such a dispute involving a non-arbitrable subject matter. At the terminal stage, an award rendered on a non-arbitrable dispute is liable to be set aside or refused enforcement under Art 34(2)(b)(i) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“Model Law”) and s 31(4)(a) of the IAA and/or under Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Law and s 31(4)(b) of the IAA. 21 As can be seen from the parties’ submissions summarised above at [16]–[18], it is crucial that the court first decides what system of law applies to determine the question of subject matter arbitrability at the pre-award stage. If it is the law of the seat (ie, Singapore law) that governs that question, it is common ground between the parties that shareholder disputes and even minority oppression claimsarearbitrable, as held by the Court of Appeal inTomolugenHoldings(at [84]). It would then not matter whether one characterises the disputes as contractual or arising out of the SHA, or as minority oppression or mismanagement claims. However, if it is the proper law of the arbitration agreement that governs the issue of subject matter arbitrability, it will (at least on the defendant’s case) then be necessary to determine what is the proper law of the arbitration agreement in the SHA before considering if the disputes are arbitrable under that law. 22 With regard to determining the proper law of an arbitration agreement, both parties accept that the applicable test or framework is encapsulated inBCYv BCZ[2017] 3 SLR 357 (“BCY”) (at [40]), where Steven Chong J (as he then was) summarised the three-stage test as follows: (a) the parties’ express choice;(b) the implied choice of the parties as gleaned from their intentions at the time of contracting; or(c) the system of law with which the arbitration agreement has the closest and most real connection.",
        "Analysis and decision": "The defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court 71 As a preliminary point, the defendant argues that he is not amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts because he does not reside in Singapore and was not amenable to being served with proceedings out of jurisdiction. He also contends that he does not submit to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts and the only and proper forum for the resolution of the dispute between him and the plaintiff is the NCLT.39Foot Note 39×DWS at paras 27 to 32; 1AM at para 5.The plaintiff contends that the court hasinpersonamjurisdiction over the defendant under s 16(1)(a)(ii) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) because leave was granted to serve the cause papers for OS 242 on the defendant out of jurisdiction and the defendant was personally and validly so served.40Foot Note 40×HR/ORC 1458/2021.The defendant has also submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts by agreeing to arbitration of the disputes in the SHA in Singapore.41Foot Note 41×1SAM at para 87(a). 72 An injunction will only be issued restraining a party who is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court (seeBank of America National Trust and Savings Association vDjoni Widjaja[1994] 2 SLR(R) 898 at [11]). InKoh Kay Yew vInno-Pacific Holdings Ltd[1997] 2 SLR(R) 148 (“Koh Kay Yew”)(at [17]), the Court of Appeal stated that a party would be amenable to the jurisdiction of the court if that party was “validly served with the required court documents as required by the present Rules of Court finding jurisdiction in Singapore” or submitted to the court’s jurisdiction. As also noted by the Court of Appeal inKoh Kay Yew(at [17]): Being amenable to the jurisdiction of the local courts simply means being liable or accountable to this jurisdiction. As such, so long as any local courts haveinpersonamjurisdiction over a party,eitherthrough the proper service of documentsorthrough submission to the jurisdiction, this first criteria would be satisfied. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 73 In my judgment, the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of this court on both counts. ORC 1458, granting the plaintiff leave to serve OS 242 and the supporting affidavit of Ms Mani on the defendant out of jurisdiction, was made on 15 March 2021. In its leave application, the plaintiff relied on O11 r 1(r) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), namely that OS 242 was in respect of matters in which the defendant had agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the court. Even though the defendant does not reside in Singapore, he is party to an arbitration agreement which envisages arbitration seated in Singapore. As such, the defendant has also, in my view, agreed to submit to thesupervisory jurisdictionof this court as the court in the arbitral seat. Such supervisory jurisdiction is not limited to merely supervising the actual arbitral process but includes the jurisdiction to supervise the conduct of a party to a contract and compelling, if necessary, that party to comply with its contractual obligations to resolve disputes with its counterparty in Singapore in accordance with the contractually agreed dispute resolution mechanism. 74 In the context of this case where the defendant has entered into an arbitration agreement specifying Singapore as the seat of arbitration, the words “agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court” in O 11 r 1(r) of the ROC are, in my judgment, wide enough to encompass an agreement to submit to such supervisory jurisdiction of this court. 75 Secondly, and related to the point made at [73] above, the defendant’s conduct is to be taken (a) as a submission to this court’s jurisdiction or alternatively (b) a waiver of any jurisdictional irregularity. In the further alternative, the court is in any event entitled to proceed on the basis that there has been proper service on the defendant. I elaborate below. 76 The defendant avers in hisaffidavitin support of SUM 1477 and in opposition to OS 242 that he does not submit to the jurisdiction of this court and that the actions taken by him in OS 242 do not amount to a step in the proceedings. However, and significantly, the defendantdid nottake any steps to dispute the jurisdiction of the court by way of an application to set asideORC 1458(ie,the order granting the plaintiff leave to serve the cause papers in OS 242 on the defendantex juris). 77 O 28 r 2A(1) of the ROC provides as follows: Dispute as to jurisdiction (O. 28, r. 2A) 2A.—(1) A defendantwho wishes to dispute the jurisdiction of the Courtin the proceedings by reason of any irregularity in the originating summons or service thereofor in any order giving leave to serve the originating summons out of the jurisdictionor extending the validity of the originating summons for the purpose of service or on any other groundshall within 21 daysafter service of the originating summons and supporting affidavit or affidavits on him apply to the Court for— (a) an order setting aside the originating summons or service of the originating summons on him; (b) an order declaring that the originating summons has not been duly served on him; (c)the discharge of any order giving leave to serve the originating summons on him out of thejurisdiction; (d) the discharge of any order extending the validity of the originating summons for the purpose of service; (e) the protection or release of any property of the defendant seized or threatened with seizure in the proceedings; (f) the discharge of any order made to prevent any dealing with any property of the defendant; (g) a declaration that in the circumstances of the case the Court has no jurisdiction over the defendant in respect of the subject-matter of the claim or the relief or remedy sought in the action; or (h) such other relief as may be appropriate. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] O 28 r 2A(1) mirrors the wording of O12 r 7(1). However, O 28 does not contain the equivalent of O 12 r 7(6), which provides that: Except where the defendant makes an application in accordance with paragraph (1),the appearance by a defendant shall, unless the appearance is withdrawn by leave of the Court under Order 21, Rule 1, betreated as a submission by the defendant to the jurisdiction of the Courtin the proceedings. [Emphasis added] 78 Even so, in my judgment, if the defendant wished to dispute the jurisdiction of the court, it was incumbent on him to make an application under O 28 r 2A(1)(c) of the ROC to set aside or discharge ORC 1458 within 21 days after the service of OS 242 and the supporting affidavit on him. It is not in dispute that the defendant was served with the cause papers for OS 242 on 26 March 202142Foot Note 42×1AM at para 89.and thereafter, proceeded to defend the application.43Foot Note 43×1AM at para 88.Yet, the defendantdid notapply to set aside ORC 1458. As I have explained, SUM 1477 filed by the defendant on 30 March 2021 together with his supporting affidavit, wasnotan application to set aside ORC 1458 but to set asideORC 1463, which was theexparteinjunction order. 79 O 28 r 2A(1) of the ROC is phrased in mandatory terms as seen by the use of the words “shallwithin 21 days”. In my judgment, a failure to challenge jurisdiction under O 28 r 2A(1) of the ROC within the prescribed time limit would mean that the defendant is,thereafter, taken to have submitted to the court’s jurisdiction or waived any jurisdictional irregularity in relation to OS 242. Alternatively, the court is entitled to proceed on the basis that there has been “proper service” on the defendant (Koh Kay Yewat [17]). 80 There is support for my conclusion in the authorities. InWoh Hup (Pte Ltd v Property Development Ltd[1991] 1 SLR(R) 473 (“Woh Hup”) (at [20]), Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) considered that a failure to enter a conditional appearance with a view of setting aside the service of the originating summons outside of the jurisdiction on the ground of lack of jurisdiction meant that the defendants had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court. The commentary inSingapore Civil Procedure 2021vol 1 (Cavinder Bull SC gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2021) at para 12/7/4 regarding O 12 r 7 of the ROC, states as follows: …But where a defendant disputes the court’s jurisdiction he must comply with the provisions of O.12, r.7. Thus, a defendant who wishes to challenge an order extending the validity of a writ should do so by invoking O. 12, r.7(1) … Failure to do so willpreclude the defendant from challenging jurisdiction at a later stagein the proceedings … [emphasis added] InAllengerShiona (trustee-in-bankruptcy of the estate of Pelletier, Richard Paul Joseph) v Pelletier, Olga and another[2020] SGHC 279 (at [104]), Ang SJ noted that the effect of the time limits for challenging the court’s jurisdiction in O 12 r 7(1) of the ROC is todisallow challenges made beyond such limits, unless an extension has been granted. Finally, inBroadcast Solutions Pte Ltd v Zoom Communications Ltd[2014] 1 SLR 1324 (at [30]), Woo Bih Li J (as he then was) also opined, in the context of a stay application, that a non-challenge as to jurisdiction would ordinarily be construed as a submission. 81 In my judgment, the proposition that a defendant who fails to dispute jurisdiction in accordance with the ROC is precluded from later challenging jurisdiction applies equally in the context of O 28 r 2A(1); particularly so since the wording of O 28 r 2A(1) of the ROC isinpari materiawith O 12 r 7(1). Thus, the defendant’s assertions on affidavit are, in my judgment, ineffective and inadequate to constitute a dispute as to the court’s jurisdiction (and by extension, his amenability to this court’s jurisdiction). It does not alter the fact that the defendant’s decision not to challenge the court’s jurisdiction in the manner prescribed by O 28 r 2A(1), by way of an application to set aside or discharge ORC 1458, would amount to a submission to this court’s jurisdiction in so far as OS 242 is concerned, or at the least a waiver of any jurisdictional irregularity that may have existed. Alternatively, even if I am wrong on this, in these circumstances, the court nevertheless proceeds on the assumption that the defendant has been properly served; until ORC 1458 is set aside, it remains a valid order and the court proceeds on that basis. Thus, the amenability requirement would still be met. As held inKoh Kay Yewat (see [72] above), the amenability test is satisfied either by proper service or submission to jurisdiction. 82 Finally, while the defendant argues that OS 242 was not validly served out of jurisdiction since the disputes are non-arbitrable under Indian law, that contention falls away in the light of my conclusions above on the issue of arbitrability. I therefore reject the defendant’s contention that he is not amenable to the jurisdiction of the court. 83 Since, as I have found, the defendant’s commencement of the NCLT Proceedings in India is in breach of the arbitration agreement in the SHA,prima facie, an anti-suit injunction should be granted against the defendant unless there is strong reason not to do so. Concerns regarding comity do not arise in this case since there is no delay by the plaintiff in seeking injunctive relief. Ultimately, this court is not arrogating to itself jurisdiction exercised by the court of a foreign friendly state but is merely seeking to uphold and enforce the parties’ contractual bargain. 84 The remaining question is whether there nevertheless exists strong reason not to grant an anti-suit injunction. There is no strong reason not to grant an anti-suit injunction 85 Mr Nandakumar raised four grounds in seeking to establish the existence of strong reason not to grant an anti-suit injunction, namely: (a) the resulting award will not be enforceable in India;44Foot Note 44×DWS at paras 79 to 83.(b) the NCLT Proceedings are not vexatious and oppressive and it is the plaintiff’s application in Singapore that is vexatious and oppressive;45Foot Note 45×DWS at paras 84 to 93.(c) the arbitration agreement does not bind all parties to the dispute whereas the NCLT has jurisdiction over all relevant parties;46Foot Note 46×DWS at paras 94 to 96.and(d) the NCLT is the natural and competent forum to hear the dispute.47Foot Note 47×DWS at paras 98 to 99. In my judgment, none of these grounds, singly or collectively, constitutes strong reason not to grant the injunction sought by the plaintiff. I address each ground in turn. 86 The first ground, even if correct, does not afford strong reason why the arbitration agreement should not be enforced. The seat court is not concerned with ensuring that an award emanating from a tribunal in the seat country will be enforceable, whether in the jurisdiction where enforcement will likely take place or in any other jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal inLarsen Oil(at [26]) stated that: Second, it is important to remember that arbitration is not an end in itself. Parties engage in arbitration in order to obtain an arbitral award that can be enforced. An arbitral award in respect of [a] non-arbitrable claim is abrutumfulmenas it can be set aside under s 48(1)(b)(i) of the AA even if the issue of arbitrability is not raised by the parties. It is an utter waste of time for parties to incur time and cost through arbitration, only to obtain an arbitral award that is later set aside for non-arbitrability, and to have the entire litigation process repeated again to have their dispute sorted out…. WhilstLarsen Oilwas a case concerned with the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed), the observations made by the court in the passage quoted above would apply equally to an arbitration subject to the IAA. The seat court’s concern, if at all, should be to ensure as far as possible that an award rendered in the arbitral seat does not become abrutumfulmenbecause it is liable to being set aside by the very same seat court on account of non-arbitrability. 87 That reasoning cannot however be extended to also ensuring that the award will be enforceable in all other conceivable jurisdictions. Public policy and arbitrability considerations are unique to individual states. Both the Model Law and the New York Convention recognise this by providing for an “escape valve” mechanism allowing contracting states to refuse to recognise or enforce an arbitral award it deems to be contrary to its own policy. As I have alluded to at [46], this “risk” is inherent within the scheme of international commercial arbitration. Further, under the New York Convention, any award rendered by a tribunal in this case is potentially enforceable in any country in which the said convention applies, and not just in India. It would be speculative for the court to predict which are the more likely venues of enforcement especially given that assets may be moved from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. As such, the likelihood of an award being enforceable in other jurisdictions, while it may conceivably be raised as a factor for the court’s consideration, does not, in my judgment, amount to strong reason in this case not to grant the anti-suit injunction. 88 The second ground is also insufficient to amount to strong reason. Flowing from my conclusions that subject matter arbitrability is governed by the law of the seat and that the claims made by the defendant in the NCLT Proceedings are arbitrable, it follows that the NCLT Proceedings were brought by the defendant in breach of the arbitration agreement and are therefore,prima facie, vexatious and oppressive. The arguments on how the proceedings in Singapore were conducted or prosecuted by plaintiff also fall away and are, in any case, not enough to displace the case for an anti-suit injunction. It cannot, in the circumstances, be said that the application for an anti-suit injunction was itself vexatious and oppressive conduct by the plaintiff, especially since the plaintiff would,prima facie, beentitledto an anti-suit injunction to enforce the arbitration agreement in the first place. 89 The third ground also falls away in the light of the defendant’s breach of the arbitration agreement. There is no need for the plaintiff to show any separate basis as to why the NCLT Proceedings are vexatious or oppressive. While the defendant claims that an arbitral tribunal would have no jurisdiction over Ms Mani since she is not a party to the SHA, Mr Thio SC confirmed during the oral hearing and it was recorded by the court, that if necessary, Ms Mani is prepared to give an undertaking that she agrees to submit to any arbitration commenced by the defendant in Singapore in relation to the claims brought by the defendant in the NCLT Proceedings.48Foot Note 48×NE 2 July 2021 at pp 19 (line 32) and 20 (line 3).I also note that Ms Mani has stated on affidavit that the arbitration agreement applies to her notwithstanding that she is not party to the SHA because she is a “[party] to the dispute”.49Foot Note 49×Shobitha Annie Mani 2nd affidavit dated 19 April 2021 at paras 16 to 17.All the other parties to the NCLT Proceedings (see [13] above) are parties to the SHA. Thus, this concern also falls away accordingly. 90 The fourth ground also does not afford strong reason and is, in my judgment, not relevant in this case. As I have found that the claims in the NCLT Proceedings have been brought in breach of the arbitration agreement, then as a matter of the parties’ contractual bargain, Singapore is where proceedings have to be brought. That is the positive aspect of the parties’ obligations under the arbitration agreement. Therefore, in that sense, it could be said that it is Singapore that is the natural and competent forum and not India (or the NCLT specifically). 91 However, even if India is,exhypothesi, the natural forum considering the connecting factors to the parties and the dispute, that is also immaterial because parties have contractually agreed to resolve their disputes by way of arbitration proceedings in Singapore. It therefore does not matter that India is where the parties and the dispute may have more substantial connections. Consideration of the natural forum to hear the dispute (in the traditional sense as laid down inSpiliadaMaritime Corporation v Cansulex[1987] AC 460) should not figure in the court’s analysis when it is deciding whether to grant an anti-suit injunction to restrain conduct that is in breach of an arbitration agreement, and there is good reason why this should be the case. 92 For one, it is entirely conceivable that Singapore may be chosen by commercial parties as the arbitral seatprecisely becauseit has no connections to the parties or the transaction and is therefore a completely neutral forum. For a party to then contend that another forum is the natural forum and that affords strong reasonnotto grant an anti-suit injunction to enforce the parties’ contractual bargain would effectively render the parties’ autonomous choice nugatory. It also completely undermines the principle undergirding the grant of an anti-suit injunction in such circumstances which is to compel compliance with contractually agreed obligations.",
        "Second issue: Whether the bringing of the claims by the defendant before the NCLT is in breach of the arbitration agreement": "63 I turn now to address whether the bringing of the claims by the defendant before the NCLT is in breach of the arbitration agreement. This issue concerns the construction of the arbitration agreement and its scope. The plaintiff says that the disputes are essentially issues relating to the exercise of contractual rights under the SHA and fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. Thus, the defendant has breached the arbitration agreement by commencing the NCLT proceedings.36Foot Note 36×PWS at paras 33 and 53 to 55.However, the defendant contends that the disputes pertain to oppression and mismanagement under Indian law and do not fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. Parties could not have intended for disputes relating to oppression and mismanagement to fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement since it would be unworkable and liable to be declared void under Indian law.37Foot Note 37×DWS at para 4. 64 I note that no evidence was led by the parties and no arguments were made on whether Indian law (assuming it is the proper law of the arbitration agreement) applies principles that are different to Singapore law with regard to theconstructionof an arbitration agreement. As such, I have proceeded on the basis that the approach to construing an arbitration agreement and its ambit is the same, whether under Singapore or Indian law.",
        "Third issue: Whether the court should grant the permanent anti-suit injunction sought by the plaintiff": "69 Finally, I turn to the issue of whether a permanent anti-suit injunction should be granted. The applicable legal principles are well-settled and not in dispute. The Court of Appeal, inSun Travels & Tours Pvt LtdvHilton International Manage (Maldives) Pvt Ltd[2019] 1 SLR 732 (“Sun Travels”) (at [66]), summarised the five factors to be considered in deciding whether to grant an anti-suit injunction as follows: (a) whether the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court;(b) whether Singapore is the natural forum for resolution of the dispute between the parties;(c) whether the foreign proceedings would be vexatious or oppressive to the plaintiff if they are allowed to continue;(d) whether the anti-suit injunction would cause any injustice to the defendant by depriving the defendant of legitimate juridical advantages sought in the foreign proceedings; and(e) whether the institution of foreign proceedings was or would be in breach of any agreement between the parties. 70 The Court of Appeal inSun Travelsalso reaffirmed the well-known principle that, in cases of arbitration agreements, it would suffice to show that there was a breach of an arbitration agreement and in which case, anti-suit injunctive relief would ordinarily be granted unless there are strong reasons not to. This is aseparatebasis on which an anti-suit injunction may be granted, distinct from when such an injunction may be granted to prevent unconscionable conduct by the injunctee. There is no need to adduce any additional evidence of unconscionable conduct in cases where the party to be injuncted has brought, or is threatening to bring, proceedings in breach of its obligations under an arbitration agreement. The court ought not to, in such circumstances, feel any diffidence in granting an anti-suit injunction subject to the caveat that the injunction “is sought promptly and before the foreign proceedings are too far advanced” (AnggelikiCharis Compania Maritima SA v Pagnan SpA[1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 87 (at 96);Sun Travelsat [66]–[68]). If there is delay in bringing the application, comity considerations may become relevant (Sun Travelsat [75] and [81]–[83]).",
        "Conclusion": "93 For all of the reasons mentioned above, I find that there is sufficient merit in the plaintiff’s application. I therefore allow OS 242 and grant a permanent anti-suit injunction against the defendant in the following terms: An injunction is granted restraining the defendant, his agents or otherwise from: (a) pursuing, continuing and/or proceeding with the action commenced by the defendant by way of Company Petition No. 92 of 2021 in the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) in Mumbai, India; and (b) commencing or procuring the commencement of any legal proceedings in respect of any dispute, controversy, claim or disagreement of any kind in connection with or relating to the management of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“People Interactive”), or in connection with or relating to any of the matters set out in the Shareholders’ Agreement dated 10 February 2006, as amended from time to time (the “SHA”) in any other dispute resolution forum other than an arbitration tribunal constituted in accordance with the rules laid down by the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) and seated in Singapore, against the plaintiff, and/or Shobitha Annie Mani and/or Navin Mittal and/or Anand Mittal and/or People Interactive and/or any person in relation to any dispute relating to the management of People Interactive, or arising from, connected with or relating to any of the matters set out in the SHA. 94 I note that while the plaintiff made brief submissions on the appropriateness of the scope of the injunction sought, the defendant has not done so, save for the point relating to Ms Mani which I have already addressed above at [89]. In any case, the scope of the injunction sought is, in the circumstances of this case, appropriate. 95 For completeness, it is unnecessary for me to decide on the matters raised in the defendant’s application in SUM 1477 to set aside theexparteinjunction granted in ORC 1463. As I heard full argumentsinterparteson OS 242 and have decided that a permanent anti-suit injunction should be granted, whether the interim injunction should be set aside is moot. Consequently, I dismiss SUM 1477. 96 I shall hear the parties on costs separately.
