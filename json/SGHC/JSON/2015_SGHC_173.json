Yet, they oppose entirely all\n                                        of the relief which the plaintiffs seek. In addition, the\n                                        defendants advance a counterclaim against the plaintiffs for\n                                        US$18m said to be management fees and related expenses due\n                                        to the defendants in connection with having managed the\n                                        plaintiffs’ investments for these several\n                                        years. 4       I have given judgment for the\n                                        plaintiffs in the following terms:[note: 9] (a)     I have made the\n                                                transfer order, the accounting order and the payment\n                                                order.

        "The parties": "6       The plaintiffs are all ultra high\n                                        net worth individuals. The first plaintiff is the mother of\n                                        the second and third plaintiffs.[note: 14] 7       The first and second defendants are\n                                        husband and wife.[note: 15]The third defendant is a Singapore company which the second\n                                        defendant incorporated in September 2005[note: 16]to provide\n                                        “integrated services to families on wealth protection\n                                        and wealth creation”.[note: 17]The second defendant is\n                                        the sole shareholder[note: 18]of the\n                                        third defendant and is its executive director.[note: 19]The first defendant\n                                        is neither a shareholder nor a director of the third\n                                        defendant but has rendered services to it since October 2005\n                                        pursuant to a consultancy agreement.[note: 20] 8       The plaintiffs did not name the\n                                        third defendant as a defendant when they commenced this\n                                        action. It became a defendant on its own application some\n                                        months later.[note: 21]All three\n                                        defendants adopt a common position in this litigation and\n                                        are jointly represented. 9       Although the first plaintiff is a\n                                        joint owner of the money which the plaintiffs entrusted to\n                                        the first and second defendants, she plays only a residual\n                                        role in the underlying facts. So too, it is my finding that\n                                        the third defendant operated as the first and second\n                                        defendants’ vehicle and did not have any legally\n                                        significant role in the underlying facts separate from that\n                                        of the first and second defendants. For ease of exposition,\n                                        therefore, I shall use the collective term “the\n                                        parties” to refer only to the second and third\n                                        plaintiffs on the one hand and first and second defendants\n                                        on the other.",
        "The relationship between the parties": "10     The second defendant’s\n                                        relationship with the plaintiffs is a long-standing\n                                                one.[note: 22]She was the\n                                        trusted private banker to the first plaintiff’s\n                                                husband.[note: 23]The plaintiffs,\n                                        especially the first plaintiff, came to treat the second\n                                        defendant not just as the family’s banker but also as\n                                        a trusted family friend.[note: 24]After the first\n                                        plaintiff’s husband passed away in 1992, the second\n                                        defendant’s professional relationship with the\n                                        plaintiffs came to an end, but she continued to keep in\n                                        touch with them. 11     The first defendant’s\n                                        relationship with the plaintiffs began for present purposes\n                                        in 2003 through the second defendant’s\n                                                introduction.[note: 25]At\n                                        that time, the first defendant worked for the Government of\n                                        Singapore Investment Corporation (“GIC”) as a\n                                        senior vice-president of GIC Special Investments Pte Ltd, a\n                                        position he had held since 2000.[note: 26]GIC Special\n                                        Investments Pte Ltd is the arm of GIC which specialises in\n                                        PE investments.[note: 27] 12     Although the second and third\n                                        plaintiffs are, and were in 2003, sophisticated investors,\n                                        they were then unfamiliar with PE funds as an asset class.\n                                        The first defendant introduced them to world of PE funds. He\n                                        told them of the “obscene” profits which this\n                                        asset class offered investors.[note: 28]They wanted to know\n                                        more. The first defendant obliged. Over the course of 2003\n                                        and 2004, he schooled them on PE funds. He taught them how\n                                        PE funds are structured and how fund managers and investors\n                                        make their profits. He told them of his expertise in\n                                        investing in PE funds and of the close personal\n                                        relationships he had forged during his 14-year career with\n                                        GIC with the key principals at the world’s leading PE\n                                        fund managers.[note: 29]He offered to introduce\n                                        the plaintiffs to these fund managers so they could invest\n                                        directly in PE funds rather than through intermediaries,\n                                        thereby eliminating an unnecessary layer of fees.

        "The plaintiffs’ first PE investments": "16     The WWW concept was a long-term\n                                        vision that the parties had a common intention to work\n                                        towards. Because it was a long-term vision, rather than an\n                                        immediate executable plan, and because of the close personal\n                                        relationship of trust and confidence that subsisted between\n                                        the parties at that time, the parties did not have a binding\n                                        agreement in the contractual sense – whether oral,\n                                        written or arising from conduct – governing their\n                                        rights and obligations in connection with the steps they\n                                        would take towards the WWW concept and what would happen if\n                                        it failed. That fact does not, however, detract from the\n                                        importance of the WWW concept as the factual framework\n                                        within which the parties took the steps that they\n                                        did. 17     The first step which the parties\n                                        took to get the WWW concept off the ground was to build a\n                                        track record for themselves in PE investments. Without a\n                                        track record, they would have no credibility with the\n                                        fledgling fund managers they hoped to invest in, or with the\n                                        investors whom they hoped to attract and introduce to the\n                                        fledgling fund managers. 18     To establish that track record,\n                                        the second and third plaintiffs and the first defendant\n                                        began to work towards setting up their own PE fund. The\n                                        plaintiffs were to provide all the necessary capital for the\n                                        fund. The first defendant was to provide the industry\n                                        expertise and relationships and to oversee and manage the\n                                        fund’s investments. This initial fund was to be a fund\n                                        of funds. In other words, the asset class chosen for this\n                                        initial fund to invest in was other PE funds. Once the fund\n                                        had a history of good performance, it was to become the\n                                        first fund under the WWW concept and the plaintiffs would\n                                        sell down part of their investment to external\n                                        investors. 19     Some time in late 2004 or 2005,\n                                        the first defendant brought to the plaintiffs investment\n                                        opportunities in PE funds managed by some of the\n                                        world’s leading PE fund managers.[note: 33]Using the\n                                        plaintiffs’ SPV Sky Genius Investments Ltd\n                                        (“Sky Genius”), the plaintiffs made an initial\n                                        investment of US$30m in five PE funds.[note: 34]I shall call this amount\n                                        the “Initial PE Investment” and these first\n                                        five funds “the Initial PE Funds”. The Initial\n                                        PE Funds were meant to be the plaintiffs’ personal\n                                        fund of funds, outside the WWW concept. 20     It is common ground that the\n                                        plaintiffs agreed to pay the first defendant a management\n                                        fee of 1.5% of the Initial PE Investment, or US$450,000, per\n                                        annum, for managing the Initial PE Funds. However, the\n                                        plaintiffs never agreed to pay the first defendant any fee\n                                        for introducing these five PE funds to the\n                                                plaintiffs.[note: 35]Indeed, the first and\n                                        second defendants never even discussed an introduction fee\n                                        with the plaintiffs.[note: 36] 21     Over the ensuing months, the first\n                                        defendant brought ten more PE funds to the second and third\n                                        plaintiffs. This led to the plaintiffs’ investing an\n                                        additional US$100m in 10 additional funds.[note: 37]I will call this\n                                        additional amount of US$100m the “Additional PE\n                                        Investment” and these next ten funds “the\n                                        Additional PE Funds”. These ten funds were held, not\n                                        through Sky Genius, but through a limited partnership\n                                        managed by a general partner. This structure is the typical\n                                        PE fund structure save that the plaintiffs were, for the\n                                        time being, the only investor. 22     It is common ground that the\n                                        second and third plaintiffs’ agreement to pay the\n                                        first defendant a management fee of 1.5% per annum for\n                                        managing the Initial PE Funds did not extend to the\n                                        Additional PE Funds. In any event, as in the case of the\n                                        Initial PE Funds, there was never any discussion, let alone\n                                        agreement, for the plaintiffs to pay the first defendant any\n                                        introduction fee for the Additional PE Funds. 23     In addition to the 15 PE funds\n                                        (comprising the Initial PE Funds and the Additional PE\n                                        Funds), the first defendant introduced five further ventures\n                                        to the plaintiffs which they agreed to invest in. The\n                                        plaintiffs made each of these five investments directly, by\n                                        acquiring an equity stake in the venture itself, through an\n                                        SPV and not through an investment in a PE fund.

        "Second issue": "32     On the second issue, I have found\n                                        that the first and second defendants owe fiduciary duties to\n                                        the plaintiffs, either as trustees for the plaintiffs under\n                                        a presumed resulting trust; or, at the very least, as the\n                                        plaintiffs’ agents in making and holding the\n                                        investments in question. 33     It is common ground that the\n                                        plaintiffs had no intention to make a gift to the first and\n                                        second defendants of the money which the plaintiffs\n                                        transferred to them or of the investments which the first\n                                        and second defendants purchased with that money. The\n                                        inevitable consequence of the admitted lack of donative\n                                        intent is that the plaintiffs’ money and investments\n                                        – or the shares in the SPVs which held and therefore\n                                        represented them – were held on a presumed resulting\n                                        trust for the plaintiffs. 34     The defendants argue that, even\n                                        so, they were nothing more than a bare trustee[note: 42]and\n                                        therefore owed the plaintiffs no fiduciary duties arising\n                                        from their trusteeship.[note: 43]I reject this\n                                        submission for two reasons. 35     The first and second defendants\n                                        were not passive trustees, merely holding what was\n                                        transferred to them. They invested the plaintiffs’\n                                        monies on their behalf and managed and administered those\n                                        investments. Those acts were carried out in their capacity\n                                        as fiduciaries and carry fiduciary\n                                consequences. 36     Given my finding that the first\n                                        and second defendants hold the monies and other property\n                                        entrusted to them as resulting trustees for the plaintiff,\n                                        it is not necessary for me to analyse further whether they\n                                        were also agents for the plaintiffs. If it had been\n                                        necessary for me to decide those points, I would have had no\n                                        hesitation in holding that they were.",
        "Third issue": "37     On the third issue, I find that\n                                        the first and second defendants have a personal liability to\n                                        keep and render to the plaintiffs a proper and complete\n                                        account of all the assets received by them and for all the\n                                        investments made by them on the plaintiffs’ behalf. I\n                                        also hold that the 12 May 2012 file is insufficient to\n                                        comply with this duty. 38     The liability to account is a\n                                        necessary consequence of the first and second\n                                        defendants’ fiduciary relationship with the\n                                        plaintiffs, whether as trustee under a presumed resulting\n                                        trust or as the plaintiffs’ agent. The first and\n                                        second defendants are under a personal liability to account\n                                        even if they are correctly characterised as bare trustees. A\n                                        trustee’s duty to account is so fundamental to a trust\n                                        that it has been described as being part of the\n                                        “irreducible core of a trust”. In other words,\n                                        it is one of the essential duties incumbent on all trustees\n                                        which cannot be excluded and whose absence or exclusion\n                                        would be inimical to the very existence of a trust:Armitage v Nurse and\n                                                others[1998] Ch 241 at 253 per Millett\n                                        LJ;Foreman v Kingston[2004]\n                                        1 NZLR 841 at [71] and [97] per Potter J;Spellson v George(1987) 11 NSWLR 300 at\n                                        316 per Powell J; David Hayton, “Obligation\n                                        Characteristic of the Trust” (2001) 117 LQR 96;\n                                        Andrew Butler and D J Finn, “A Modern Law of Trusts:\n                                        What is the Least That We Can Expect of a Trustee?

Q.Then my question specifically\n                                                  was whether you treated the Ironbridge Fund, which\n                                                  is serial number 6 on D1, as part of the initial\n                                                  or the additional PE funds, or whether you simply\n                                                  didn’t think about it, and I think your\n                                                  answer was you couldn’t quite\n                                                  remember. A.Yes. And I did say that\n                                                  normally in previous times when I received the NAV\n                                                  report, it’s bundled, so – and also\n                                                  you further pointed out that the Japan Fund, from\n                                                  your document, is 2006 and 2007 is definitely not\n                                                  2004 and 2005, if I recall correctly, counsel. You\n                                                  pointed out that the Japan – because in para\n                                                  59 it’s stated that in the course of the\n                                                  year 2004 and 2005, the first defendant managed to\n                                                  obtained positions in blah, blah, blah, right?\n                                                  Then you pointed out --- Q.I was just trying to remind you\n                                                  of my question, but I don’t think either the\n                                                  court nor myself are going to stop you offering a\n                                                  clarification now. So what do you want to\n                                                  add? A.So the only thing I want to add\n                                                  is the information from para 59 was actually\n                                                  obtained from the 12 May 2012 file, annex A1.\n                                                  It’s, I think, in tab 209 in my AEIC.\n                                                  (Handed) … A.Yes, so if you see that, okay,\n                                                  by the way, that’s the last NAV report that\n                                                  we ever received from Sylvia, okay, and it was\n                                                  dated as of 25 April 2012. So if you look at the\n                                                  first line, Japan Fund, you move down the third\n                                                  column, year raised and year committed, okay,\n                                                  under that column it specifically states 2003 and\n                                                  in brackets, 2005. So again, I see that there is a\n                                                  – there’s a discrepancy between this\n                                                  information and the information that you’ve\n                                                  given me, in D1. Q.Okay. A.Thus, actually – I should\n                                                  add one point, it just goes to show as long as we\n                                                  don’t have the source document, I prepared\n                                                  the affidavit based on the 12 May file which was\n                                                  supposed to be the complete and full account of\n                                                  our investments. 55     The first section of the list of\n                                        funds set out in the 12 May 2012 file referred to by the\n                                        second plaintiff in the exchange set out above is\n                                        substantially similar to the first section of the June 2007\n                                        List of Funds.[note: 83] 56     During re-examination, the second\n                                        plaintiff further explained that his understanding of the\n                                        house fund and the third party fund was that the house fund\n                                        would belong to the plaintiffs whereas the third party fund\n                                        was part of WWW fund of funds which was to be sold down to\n                                        the first defendant’s contacts:[note: 84] Q.What is the difference between\n                                                  the house fund and the third party\n                                                fund? A.Again, the house fund is\n                                                  supposed to belong to the Wee family, whereas the\n                                                  third party fund is supposed to form the private\n                                                  equity funds that was supposed to be sold down as\n                                                  the WWW FOF, fund of funds. That’s the\n                                                  differentiating factor. So here it’s clear\n                                                  that there’s this understanding from [the\n                                                  first defendant] that he differentiates the house\n                                                  fund versus the third party fund. Q.And what is the role of the WWW\n                                                  concept in relation to this third party\n                                                  fund? A.So again, the idea is for us to\n                                                  take up positions in the PE Funds captured under\n                                                  the third party funds, and then to attract LPs to\n                                                  come to sign to the WWW FOF, so that the GPs at\n                                                  WWW FOF, which the understanding was supposed to\n                                                  be me, my brother, and Shoong, would receive\n                                                  management fees at the WWW FOF. So in this\n                                                  instance, just to be very clear, the original\n                                                  funds, PE funds that are subscribed, would be\n                                                  still held, in this case, still by Woolverstone\n                                                  Fund of Funds LP. Q.So at this date, when the $48\n                                                  million is being described as a third party fund,\n                                                  and you’ve related the third party fund to\n                                                  this WWW concept, there will be, in your answer,\n                                                  you, your brother and [the first defendant]\n                                                  receiving management fees at the GP\n                                                  company? A.At the management company,\n                                                  that’s correct. That was the understanding,\n                                                  as part of the grand WWW vision. Q.And if I may turn you to page\n                                                  143, you were referred to the middle\n                                                  e-email: “We are preparing LPA to be signed off by LPs\n                                                and the GP (the latter is WWW owned).” Could you explain who would own the GP? A.I think in this case it would\n                                                  be the management company rather than the GP. The\n                                                  GP is the person, the general partner, so in this\n                                                  case, the management company would be owned\n                                                  traditionally by the GPs. They would have\n                                                  shares—the GPs would have shares in the fund\n                                                  management company. Q.And who would the GPs be\n                                                  referring to here? A.The GPs would be G1, G3 and G5,\n                                                  which again standing for— Q.In English means? A.Mr Eng, myself as G3, and my\n                                                  brother, Mr Wee Boo Tee, as G5. Q.And the first defendant is\n                                                  talking about an LPA to be signed off by LPs, in\n                                                  the plural. Who did you understanding would be the\n                                                  LPs? A.This would be the people who\n                                                  subscribed to the WWW FOF programme, and these\n                                                  people are, he mentioned to us, is ex- GIC\n                                                  colleagues – his GIC colleagues as well as\n                                                  his – basically, friends and associates that\n                                                  he knows within his network that he’s built\n                                                  over the years with GIC. 57     On 12 October 2007, shortly before\n                                        his email of 23 October 2007, the first defendant sent an\n                                        email to the second and third plaintiffs, copied to the\n                                        second defendant,[note: 85]in response to the\n                                        second plaintiff’s questions.[note: 86]The relevant\n                                        parts of the 12 October 2007 email are reproduced\n                                                below.[note: 87]The first\n                                        defendant confirms that in this email, the responses\n                                        ascribed to “Me” (italicised in the extract\n                                        below) were his responses.[note: 88]The relevant parts of\n                                        the 12 October 2007 email read as follows:[note: 89] 1. Ownership: how everything is linked to everything\n                                                (flower diagram) Me: had earlier given you a flower\n                                                  diagram that is being updated to reflect the\n                                                  recent additions such as\n                                                Westwood. In essence, there are 2 different\n                                                  set-ups used to house the investments: one is the\n                                                  special purpose vehicle (SPV) and the other is the\n                                                  GP/LP arrangement. The SPV is a limited company\n                                                  incorporated in CI. Most of the SPVs in our group\n                                                  are CI and established by; and housed @ Maples and\n                                                  Calder, the largest law firm in the Caymans. SPVs\n                                                  are owned largely by individual shareholder (s) @\n                                                  this time. A few SPVs though have an intermediate\n                                                  holding company, interposed, as part of the tax\n                                                  structuring advice received. The GP/LP arrangement is one that\n                                                  is used by all the major global PE firms,\n                                                  including the Blackstone group, CVC and Carlyle.\n                                                  This arrangement calls for LPs (Limited Partners)\n                                                  investing into a fund (via an L.P.

His\n                                        point was that the entity which subscribed to the Additional\n                                        PE Funds was acorporateentity known as Woolverstone Private Fund of Funds (LP)\n                                        Limited and was not thelimited\n                                                partnershipknown as Woolverstone Private\n                                        Fund of Funds LP.[note: 103]However, he\n                                        conceded that his email did give the impression that the PE\n                                        fund investments were made using a fund of funds limited\n                                        partnership. It is that point which confirms that the first\n                                        defendant saw himself as working towards the WWW\n                                                concept.[note: 104] MR JEYARETNAM: That, then, is a little puzzling\n                                                though. You are stating here that: “These proceeds relate to more recent\n                                                commitments made by the LPA arrangement noted above\n                                                – and not earlier commitments made through\n                                                [Sky Genius].” So when you talk about proceeds relating to more\n                                                recent commitments made by the LPA arrangement noted\n                                                above, that must be a reference to Woolverstone,\n                                                right? A.You are quite\n                                                right. Q.So there are proceeds,\n                                                  distributions being made under the fund of funds\n                                                  LPA, right? A.There are distributions from\n                                                  those private equity funds that were signed up by\n                                                  Woolverstone, that’s correct. Q.That is why you say\n                                                  “These proceeds relate to more recent\n                                                  commitments made by the LPA arrangement, since\n                                                  you’ve said these are private equity\n                                                  distributions, must be the FOF LPA arrangement,\n                                                  right? A.I meant the LPA – the LPs\n                                                  that were signed up under Woolverstone,\n                                                  that’s correct. That’s quite\n                                                  correct. Q.You are saying that “the\n                                                  LPA arrangement noted above”, and the LPA\n                                                  arrangement noted above, there are three of them:\n                                                  the FOF, the PE direct investments, the RE/hotel\n                                                  direct investments. Clearly, the relevant one is\n                                                  FOF, isn’t it? A.Yes, but the investment\n                                                  didn’t come through the LPA arrangement. The\n                                                  investment commitment was made by the Woolverstone\n                                                  Private Fund of Funds (LP) Limited. Q.Which is the LPA arrangement\n                                                  for the FOF? A.It isn’t. Q.It is, isn’t\n                                                it? A.It’s just\n                                                – Q.Mr Eng, what is the LPA\n                                                  arrangement for the FOF if it is not Woolverstone\n                                                  Private Fund of Funds (GP) Limited? A.If we had invested\n                                                  – Q.I’m sorry, LP\n                                                  Limited. A.Yes, if we had invested using\n                                                  the LP agreement, we would have – if I can\n                                                  refer you to page 40798, please. There was a\n                                                  limited partnership called Woolverstone Private\n                                                  Fund of Funds L.P.; that would have been the\n                                                  investment, so that’s why there’s no\n                                                  LPA. Q.So you are saying that in fact,\n                                                  you made no investments through Woolverstone\n                                                  Private Fund of Funds L.P.? A.That’s\n                                                correct. Q.That is why it is your case\n                                                  that the FOF was never set up, never running,\n                                                  rather? The structure was set up but never\n                                                  – A.We do have the structure here,\n                                                  that’s correct. Q.The structure is there but\n                                                  never running, never operating, as an LPA\n                                                  arrangement? A.That’s quite correct, Mr\n                                                  Jeyaretnam. … Q.You say here: “These proceeds relate to more recent\n                                                commitments made by the LPA arrangement noted\n                                                above…” This statement means that the recent commitments have\n                                                been made by the FOF LPA arrangement, right? A.That’s\n                                                incorrect. Q.That’s incorrect. So what\n                                                  does it mean when you say “the recent\n                                                  commitments made by the LPA arrangement noted\n                                                  above”? A.The LPA arrangement I talk\n                                                  about calls for the LPs to invest in the fund via\n                                                  an LPA. But we don’t have the LPA, so\n                                                  that’s the reason why it’s not\n                                                  accurate. It’s very loosely\n                                                  described. Q.Yes, the statement may be\n                                                  inaccurate. That’s exactly the point\n                                                  I’m coming to, at least according to you.\n                                                  These proceeds relate to more recent commitments\n                                                  made by the LPA arrangement. What you are telling\n                                                  the Wees, accurately or not, is that the recent\n                                                  commitments have been made by the FOF LPA,\n                                                  correct, isn’t it? A.That’s\n                                                correct. Q.So what you are telling us is\n                                                  that this statement made by you was\n                                                false. A.That’s\n                                                correct. Q.Then the next sentence, you are\n                                                  telling the Wees that “Going forward, all\n                                                  fund commitments will be made under the LPA\n                                                  arrangement.” By this, you meant that from then on, all the fund\n                                                commitments would be under the FOF LPA,\n                                                correct? A.That’s\n                                                correct. Q.But your position today is that\n                                                  in fact, the fund commitments were not made under\n                                                  the LPA arrangement? A.That’s\n                                                correct. Q.After telling the Wees that\n                                                  this was what you would be doing, on 12 October\n                                                  2007, and indeed that this was what you had been\n                                                  doing already, did you ever go back to the Wees to\n                                                  say, “No, I made a mistake, the FOF is not\n                                                  in operation yet”? A.I did. And – and they are\n                                                  fully aware that it was LP Limited that invested\n                                                  on their behalf. Q.I’m concerned about your\n                                                  going back to them. Where did you go back to them?\n                                                  By e-mail or in another\n                                                conversation? A.I told them that it was –\n                                                  it was the LP Limited company that was taking up\n                                                  the – Q.Did you apologise for the\n                                                  mistake that you made on 12 October\n                                                2007? A.I did, Mr\n                                                Jeyaretnam. Q.Did you tell them,\n                                                  “Don’t go and tell your mother\n                                                  because it is false”? A.I did not say that, Mr\n                                                  Jeyaretnam. The first defendant’s allegation that he\n                                                apologised to the plaintiffs for this mistake\n                                                appears nowhere in his affidavit.[note: 105] 61     The contemporaneous documents show\n                                        that instead of correcting the impression that the entity\n                                        which was to be the fund of funds limited partnership under\n                                        the WWW concept had been set up, the first defendant went on\n                                        to reinforce the impression given in the 12 October 2007\n                                        email by writing in the 23 October 2007 email that there was\n                                        in existence a “third party fund”:[note: 106] As discussed. The amount that is being underwritten\n                                                for a third party fund is now USD48 million,\n                                                excluding a potential commitment of US$15m to PEP\n                                                (Bain Aus). In addition, we have USD18m of the house\n                                                fund (being USD30m) currently committed. 62     Four days after the first\n                                        defendant sent the 23 October 2007 email, he wrote another\n                                        email on 24 October 2007 informing the second plaintiff,\n                                        amongst other things, that a limited partnership agreement\n                                        was being prepared for the GP and the LPs of the limited\n                                        partnership to sign:[note: 107] We are preparing LPA to be signed off by LPs and the\n                                                GP (the latter is WWW owned). For the FOF 30, had suggested 1.5% annual fee on\n                                                commitment. 63     The close proximity in time\n                                        between the first defendant’s email of 12 October 2007\n                                        and 23 October 2007 and his email of 24 October 2007\n                                        strongly suggests that both he, the second defendant and the\n                                        plaintiffs were referring to the WWW concept.[note: 108]Accordingly, the\n                                        plaintiffs must have understood that the WWW concept was\n                                        already set in motion at that time, or at least that the WWW\n                                        concept was to be implemented.[note: 109] 64     Indeed, as the first defendant\n                                        confirmed in cross-examination, the fund structure of the\n                                        various other funds mentioned in his email of 12 October\n                                        2007 had already been set up as illustrated by the various\n                                        flower diagrams that he had produced and given to the second\n                                                plaintiff.[note: 110]The fund structures\n                                        that had already been created included the fund structure\n                                        for the fund of funds PE fund, the Project Plaza PE fund and\n                                        Project Red Spot PE fund.[note: 111]The discussion in the\n                                        24 October 2007 email[note: 112]therefore must have\n                                        been in relation to how the first defendant ought to be\n                                        remunerated pursuant to the WWW concept.[note: 113] 65     Even by October 2007 (by which\n                                        time almost all the investments had been acquired), the only\n                                        remuneration that the first defendant was content to speak\n                                        of was in relation to the 1.5% per annum of the US$30m that\n                                        had been paid to him and the second defendant personally in\n                                        relation to the Initial PE Funds.[note: 114]That is what the\n                                        first defendant means when says: “For the FOF 30, had\n                                        suggested 1.5% annual fee on commitment”. Nothing was\n                                        mentioned about how he was to be remunerated in relation to\n                                        the other investments made pursuant to the WWW\n                                                concept.[note: 115] 66     The first defendant is a\n                                        sophisticated man and one well capable of looking after his\n                                        own financial interests. If the first defendant expected to\n                                        be remunerated separately and unconditionally for the work\n                                        done in connection with those other investments, he had\n                                        every opportunity to broach the subject with the second\n                                        plaintiff in response to his invitation and to arrive at an\n                                                agreement.[note: 116]The fact that he did\n                                        not is therefore indicative of his intention to recover his\n                                        compensation out of the WWW concept. 67     The second defendant was also\n                                        aware that the parties were conducting themselves to advance\n                                        the WWW concept.[note: 117]The second defendant\n                                        was copied on the 23 October 2007 email.[note: 118]In an\n                                        email dated 12 March 2010, the second defendant herself\n                                        wrote an email to the first defendant and to the first and\n                                        second plaintiffs where she referred to the Bridgepoint fund\n                                        as being the Plaintiffs’ “earlier fund under the first US$30 million\n                                                portfolio.”[note: 119]Her\n                                        explanation during trial was that she did not understand why\n                                        there was a demarcation between the Initial PE Funds and the\n                                        Additional PE Funds and that all she did was to do the work\n                                        and to take care of the funds:[note: 120] Q.Madam Lee, I don't have to\n                                                  detain you further on that. You have seen the\n                                                  first defendant using the expression \"third party\n                                                  fund\" and \"house fund\", but your evidence is you\n                                                  didn't quite understand what it referred to. I\n                                                  will go on from there and show you 39AB 31158. If\n                                                  you have that, that is your own e-mail of 12 March\n                                                  2010 to the first defendant and Mr BK Wee and Mr\n                                                  BT Wee. You yourself, when referring to\n                                                  Bridgepoint, describe it as being your \"earlier\n                                                  fund under the first US$30 million\n                                                  portfolio\". A.Counsel, yeah. Q.So my question to you is, did\n                                                  you not in fact understand that there was a first\n                                                  US$30 million portfolio, meaning a commitment up\n                                                  to US$30 million, which was sometimes called the\n                                                  \"house fund\", and that there were additional funds\n                                                  which were to be part of a third party\n                                                  fund? A.Counsel, my understanding was\n                                                  that Mr Wee has paid 1.5 per cent of the 30\n                                                  million, so to me, I thought all the assets\n                                                  belongs to them. Q.No. That's not my question, is\n                                                  it, right? We know all the assets belonged to\n                                                  them. That's not in dispute, I'm glad you're not\n                                                  disputing it. But my question is relating to\n                                                  whether you understood this demarcation between\n                                                  the house fund, the US$30 million commitment and\n                                                  the additional funds. A.I do not understand whether\n                                                  – Q.So even though you mentioned\n                                                  \"first US$30 million portfolio in this e-mail\",\n                                                  your evidence is still that you don't\n                                                  understand? A.Yes. 68     I reject the second\n                                        defendant’s explanation as disingenuous, if not\n                                        dishonest. The defendants prepared a PowerPoint presentation\n                                        for the purposes of selling the interests in the fund of\n                                        funds PE fund to investors.[note: 121]This presentation was\n                                        prepared by the first and second defendant’s son,\n                                        Jonathan Eng, and Xann Lee, an employee of CSP.[note: 122]Xann Lee’s\n                                        evidence was that all documents relating to the PE Funds\n                                        were kept in a locked cupboard which could only be accessed\n                                        by her and the second defendant.[note: 123]It was also the\n                                        second defendant who would have unrestricted access to the\n                                        online data room maintained by the PE funds:[note: 124] Q.You've mentioned receiving\n                                                  documents from the various fund managers. Who had\n                                                  access to those documents? A.The second defendant and I and\n                                                  the first defendant has a password to access the\n                                                  data room. Because the fund manager will post\n                                                  documents in this data room. Q.So each fund would have a data\n                                                  room? A.Not every funds, but\n                                                  almost. Q.This data room, is it a\n                                                  physical data room or something\n                                                online? A.Online. Q.Could you explain what are the\n                                                  documents that would be accessible in the data\n                                                  room? A.For example, PPM, the\n                                                  subscription documents, tax documents, drawdown\n                                                  notices, distribution notices, and quarterly\n                                                  reports, so and so on. Q.What is PPM? A.Private placement\n                                                  memorandum. Q.You mentioned that the three of\n                                                  you, yourself, the first defendant and the second\n                                                  defendant, had passwords. Did you all have the\n                                                  same level of access? A.No. the second defendant would\n                                                  have the password for all the funds, and her level\n                                                  of access is everything. But for me, will be just\n                                                  a few funds, and I'm having the restricted access.\n                                                  For example, I cannot access tax documents. And\n                                                  the first defendant, he also has a few -- password\n                                                  for -- not all the funds. Q.What about physical documents?\n                                                  Did you receive physical documents from the funds\n                                                  as well? A.Sometimes, yes. Q.Where were these\n                                                kept? A.In the locked cupboard in the\n                                                  office. Q.Who held the key to this locked\n                                                  cupboard? A.ED and myself -- sorry, the\n                                                  second defendant and myself. Q.Which part of the\n                                                  office? A.In the office. Q.The general\n                                                office. A.Yes, general\n                                                office. (a)     The second defendant\n                                                confirmed that when the Powerpoint presentation was\n                                                prepared she had taken a quick look at it and was\n                                                concerned about the information relating to the PE\n                                                fund managers and the other information contained in\n                                                  it.[note: 125] (b)     The second\n                                                defendant also confirmed that Jonathan Eng and Xann\n                                                Lee do not have the authority to put together a\n                                                Powerpoint presentation such as this without\n                                                checking with her.[note: 126]The Powerpoint\n                                                presentation was also sent out via the second\n                                                defendant’s email.[note: 127]She testified\n                                                as follows:[note: 128] Q.And sent out by you\n                                                  under your email. That’s Jonathan and Xann.\n                                                  Do Jonathan and Xann have the authority to put\n                                                  together something like this, without checking\n                                                  with you? A.They will not, and I\n                                                  understand that this was prepared for Mr Wee Boo\n                                                  Kuan and Wee Boo Tee. (c)     Most importantly, the second\n                                                defendant’s conduct after she sent out the\n                                                email demonstrated that she knew the purpose of the\n                                                presentation. In her email dated 18 November 2009 at\n                                                12:19 hours, the second defendant wrote:[note: 129] WPFOF is currently registered in\n                                                  Cayman.

The parties therefore never had\n                                        an agreement on fees. Further, the first and second\n                                        defendant never addressed their mind as to what was to\n                                        happen if the WWW concept failed and the anticipated reward\n                                        for their efforts failed to materialise.",

The annual fee being\n                                        an agreed fee, it is irrelevant whether it is commensurate\n                                        with the amount of work which had to be done in managing and\n                                        administering those funds. 71     The plaintiffs made 3 payments of\n                                        US$450,000 for management fees.

A.It is not management\n                                                  fee. Q.So it is the Wee’s money\n                                                  set aside for Project Plaza? A.Yes. Q.So on your evidence, you should\n                                                  pay this money back to the Wees now? A.I agree. Q.When can the Wees expect it\n                                                  back? A.Currently, there are a lot of\n                                                  things that is still unresolved, Mr Jeyaratnam. No\n                                                  doubt, there are amounts in our accounts that\n                                                  belongs to the Wees, but there are also fees that\n                                                  the Wees are owing to us. So if things are not\n                                                  resolved, we do not know how to account for all\n                                                  these things. That is -- that is why we are here,\n                                                  to resolve the issue. Q.What you have said today, that\n                                                  these moneys are repayable to the Wees --\n                                                  “these moneys” being GBP 257,731 --\n                                                  is not reflected in Mr Stone’s report\n                                                  because you didn’t tell him\n                                                that? A.No. This particular sum,\n                                                  perhaps Mr Stone did not take into account because\n                                                  it came to the account of where the fees and\n                                                  personal use was. So it’s the same as\n                                                  – sorry. It’s the same as the 300,000.\n                                                  I’m not sure if Mr Stone has taken that into\n                                                  account. Q.Do you actually have the money,\n                                                  the GBP 257,000? Is it still in the HSBC\n                                                  account? A.You see, Mr Jeyaratnam, the\n                                                  funds is inside my account. For the fees, we do\n                                                  use them, so if there is anything that is not\n                                                  belonging to us, we will want to return it back to\n                                                  the Wees. We don’t want them. But if\n                                                  it’s expenses that are used by us for Mr\n                                                  Wee’s purposes, then I think he should\n                                                  rightly, rightfully bear these\n                                                expenses. 74     But this contradicts the first\n                                        defendant’s email of 15 August 2006 at 21:19 hours in\n                                        which he said that the GBP 257,731.96 was for payment of\n                                        management fees:[note: 138] Meant: have your trsfd for period Aug 06 to Jul 07 the\n                                                amount of US$450K. The first amt would have been for Aug 05 to Jul\n                                                06. Shall return you the 300K loan end of this year if ok\n                                                with you! That was indeed recd – funding other\n                                                deals. The first defendant’s email was in\n                                                response to the second plaintiff’s email\n                                                written at 16:45 hours the same day:[note: 139] Mystery solved! 257,731 sterling pounds (US$450K\n                                                equivalent approx) wired into your HSBC account 20\n                                                Feb via SKY! 75     On the same day at 22:20 hours,\n                                        the first defendant wrote a further email confirming what he\n                                        meant in his earlier email:[note: 140] Apologies if I am confusing all. The Jul 06 email was requesting for the management fee\n                                                for the period Aug 06 to Jul 07. The 450K already received was for\n                                                  Aug 05 to Jul 06. The loan was received and shall be re-paid by the end\n                                                of this year. Need to re-shape personal portfolio\n                                                especially with new co-investments such as Riviera\n                                                etc… [emphasis added] 76     I therefore find that the sum of\n                                        GBP 257,731.96 was a payment in pounds sterling of the\n                                        US$450,000 management fee for 2005–2006. I do not\n                                        accept the first defendant’s oral evidence that he was\n                                        mistaken when he said contemporaneously in his email that\n                                        this sterling payment was for management fees\n                                                2005–2006.[note: 141]It also appears to\n                                        me to be reasonable that these management fees (save for the\n                                        first payment) were paid in advance rather than in arrears.\n                                        That would explain why the first two annual payments both\n                                        came in the calendar year 2006. They were a payment in\n                                        arrears for 2005–2006 and a payment in advance for\n                                        2006–2007. 77     If the defendants have a\n                                        contractual right to be paid $450,000 per annum, that right\n                                        continues to subsist until that right expires, is determined\n                                        in accordance with the terms of the parties’ agreement\n                                        or until the parties’ agreement as a whole is brought\n                                        to an end. There is no evidence before me of any such event\n                                        having taken place. The right being contractual, it is\n                                        unaffected by the defendants’ failure to ask for\n                                        further management fees after the last payment on 7 August\n                                        2008 covering the period up to August 2009. In the absence\n                                        of any unequivocal representation by the defendants of an\n                                        intention to disclaim those fees or any detrimental reliance\n                                        by the plaintiffs on any such a representation, neither of\n                                        which is suggested, the defendants are not precluded by any\n                                        estoppel from claiming those fees now, by way of\n                                        counterclaim in this action, merely because they failed to\n                                        ask for those fees earlier. In any event, any such estoppel\n                                        would not extinguish the defendants’ right to the fees\n                                        in question but would merely entitle the plaintiffs to\n                                        reasonable notice before the defendants insisted on\n                                        enforcing their strict legal rights. 78     The plaintiffs’ agreement to\n                                        pay the first and second defendants US$450,000 per annum\n                                        therefore continues to bind the plaintiffs. The first and\n                                        second defendants are entitled to be paid those management\n                                        fees for the remaining years in which they have been\n                                        managing and administering the PE funds up to the date on\n                                        which the structure holding the funds is transferred to the\n                                        plaintiffs pursuant to the judgment herein, pro-rated if\n                                        necessary.",

Q.That's right. A.Four payments, I\n                                                mean. Q.Beyond that, as you say,\n                                                  nothing was agreed. The reason I was asking you\n                                                  this question was you weren't expecting to have\n                                                  this for free, that's what I meant.

Although,\n                                                  may I add the context, because we are here to\n                                                  build a business together, that was really the\n                                                  context, where we provided the funding, we\n                                                  provided the expertise, and the connections,\n                                                  access to these funds. Q.Mr Wee, and that's why I was\n                                                  careful to ask you about this before lunch, there\n                                                  were discussions, according to you, about this,\n                                                  but nothing was actually agreed about that,\n                                                  correct? Nothing was actually agreed beyond paying\n                                                  1.5 per cent on the initial PE funds of up to\n                                                  US$30 million, correct?

Q.Essentially, Mr Wee, as more\n                                                  investments were undertaken beyond the initial PE\n                                                  funds amount of US$30 million, the parties didn't\n                                                  really sit down and discuss, or sit down and agree\n                                                  what sort of fee was to be payable for all that,\n                                                  correct? A.That is correct. 81     But even if the services were\n                                        provided, and even if the plaintiffs expected to pay for\n                                        these services, and even if that expectation was shared by\n                                        the defendants, that does not suffice to give rise to a\n                                        legal entitlement to payment. The plaintiffs cannot be\n                                        compelled to pay for these services unless they agreed\n                                        expressly or impliedly to do so or unless, despite the\n                                        absence of an agreement, they are obliged by the law of\n                                        restitution to do so. No entitlement to additional management fees on an\n                                implied agreement 82     The defendants’ case is that\n                                        although there was no express agreement for these additional\n                                        fees, the defendants are entitled to management fees of 1.5%\n                                        of the commitment amount for the additional PE funds under\n                                        an implied agreement.[note: 144] 83     I find that there is no basis for\n                                        any such implied agreement. Insofar as it arises from the\n                                        admitted agreement to pay fees of 1.5% per annum in respect\n                                        of the Initial PE Investment, the implied agreement\n                                        advocated by the defendants contradicts the terms of that\n                                        express agreement and is unsustainable. 84     I find it impossible also to spell\n                                        out a separate agreement to that effect, arising from the\n                                        parties’ conduct. Indeed, the parties’ conduct\n                                        contradicts any such implied agreement. The defendants asked\n                                        for management fees to be paid on four occasions (10\n                                        February 2006, 22 August 2006, 24 August 2007 and 7 August\n                                        2008). On each occasion, those fees were calculated as 1.5%\n                                        of US$30m. That is so even though the requests in August\n                                        2007 and August 2008 came after the commitment amount had\n                                        been increased from US$30m to US$129m. 85     The suggestion that the\n                                        parties’ express agreement was open-ended, permitting\n                                        the defendants to claim fees beyond 1.5% per annum of the\n                                        initial US$30m, or that they entered into a separate\n                                        agreement by conduct are both disingenuous afterthoughts. I\n                                        reject this submission. No entitlement to additional management fees on a quantum\n                                meruit 86     The defendants’ alternative\n                                        claim is for additional management fees on aquantum meruitfixed at: (1)\n                                        0.75% of the AUM under Sky Genius; (2) 1.5% of the AUM under\n                                        Woolverstone Private Fund of Funds LP Ltd during the\n                                        “active management phase”; and (3) 1% of the\n                                        AUM after the “active management\n                                                phase”.[note: 145]I reject this\n                                        alternative claim for the following reasons. 87     First, the evidence supports a\n                                        finding that in regard to the Additional PE Funds, the\n                                        defendants performed their services speculatively, in\n                                        anticipation of being compensated out of the profit in their\n                                        overall venture,iethe WWW\n                                        concept. As such, the defendants were taking the risk that\n                                        that prospect of future compensation would not materialise.\n                                        Having knowingly and voluntarily taken that risk, they\n                                        cannot now claim a restitutionary remedy as compensation for\n                                        the consequences of that risk. 88     Second, there is no room now for\n                                        the defendants to be remunerated for these additional\n                                        services on an entirely different basis from that\n                                        contractually agreed. The plaintiffs and the defendants\n                                        agreed contractually that the defendants would earn a\n                                        management fee fixed at 1.5% of the Initial PE Investment of\n                                                US$30m.[note: 146]Any extension or\n                                        modification to that contractual agreement to permit the\n                                        defendants’ current claim would itself have to be\n                                        contractual. 89     Third, the defendants had every\n                                        opportunity to make clear any expectation regarding\n                                        remuneration contemporaneously with the services\n                                                rendered.[note: 147]It was completely open\n                                        to them to clarify matters in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008; and\n                                        indeed all the way up to 2012.[note: 148]They failed to do\n                                                this.[note: 149] 90     Fourth, the defendants have not\n                                        adduced any independent expert evidence of the market\n                                        practice on which they rely to justify the entitlement to\n                                        fees or the quantum of fees.[note: 150]The\n                                        defendants’ evidence on this question was given by the\n                                        first and second defendants’ daughter, Elizabeth Eng,\n                                        as opinion evidence. Her evidence is neither expert evidence\n                                        nor independent evidence. It is not expert evidence because\n                                        the sum total of her expertise in the world of private\n                                        equity comes in the form of a 1 month\n                                                internship.[note: 151]Her evidence is also\n                                        not independent evidence because of her family relationship\n                                        to the first and second defendants.[note: 152] 91     The plaintiffs’ expert\n                                        evidence on this issue came from Mr Richard Harris, who was\n                                        both an expert and independent. The defendants did not\n                                        challenge his expertise or independence.[note: 153]He disagreed with\n                                        Elizabeth Eng on her basis of charging. I accept his\n                                        evidence as having by far the greater weight.[note: 154] 92     At trial, the defendants sought to\n                                        argue instead that this claim was for an introducers’\n                                        fee rather than a management fee.[note: 155]I reject this\n                                        argument for two reasons: (a)     First, the\n                                                defendants have not pleaded that they were entitled\n                                                to or claiming an introducer’s\n                                                  fee.[note: 156]They are therefore\n                                                precluded from advancing that as the basis for the\n                                                  fee;[note: 157] (b)     Second, Richard\n                                                Harris’s evidence in his affidavit[note: 158]and at trial is that\n                                                it is typically not an investor who pays an\n                                                introducer a fee for finding a fund for the\n                                                investor. Instead, it is the principal of the fund\n                                                who pays the introducer a fee for finding the\n                                                investor. And even then, an introduction fee is\n                                                usually a one-off fee rather than a recurring,\n                                                annual fee:[note: 159] Q.Then I go down to the term\n                                                  \"Introducer\". Just to get your understanding of\n                                                  it, essentially this is someone or an entity that\n                                                  introduces a client to an investment opportunity\n                                                  and would typically charge an introduction fee,\n                                                  correct? A.Correct. Q.Again, you put that at\n                                                  typically -- I get this from paragraph 53 -- 0.5\n                                                  to 1 per cent and/or a trail fee of 0.2 to 0.5 per\n                                                  cent per annum for a period of years, so it could\n                                                  be a one-off fee or it could be a one-off fee with\n                                                  a trail fee, correct? A.That's correct. Q.I suppose it would be possible,\n                                                  if there was someone who was regularly introducing\n                                                  investments to you, it might be possible to also\n                                                  charge this as an annual fee? A.No, I don't think so. I think\n                                                  that it would be regarded as a commission for an\n                                                  introducer. The other big difference that one\n                                                  should be aware of is an introducer often works\n                                                  for the fund management company, introducing the\n                                                  fund to the client. So the introducer might\n                                                  actually be paid not necessarily by the client but\n                                                  by the fund management company. Q.That is so, but without going\n                                                  into who pays, I was coming back to my question\n                                                  that it might be incorporated an annual fee, and\n                                                  you didn't agree with me. I just wondered whether\n                                                  I could cross over to page 30 of your report, and\n                                                  just to give you the context -- I will come back\n                                                  to this, it is just that I am trying to follow up\n                                                  on this particular point -- at page 29 you were\n                                                  giving your comments on 1.3.2, \"Fund of Funds\n                                                  fees\", and I wanted to show the context. If you\n                                                  come back to page 30 at paragraph (f), you say:\n                                                  \"In this sense the word 'introducing' would also\n                                                  imply advising on or recommending a fund, which\n                                                  would happen if, as here, the client does not have\n                                                  another regulated intermediary between himself and\n                                                  the fund.

It might be possible or it might be the case\n                                                that you pay that person an annual fee, rather than\n                                                each time an introduction fee based on a percentage\n                                                of the commission. That is all I was asking. A.The answer is no. I think if\n                                                  you are introducing, you are introducing and you\n                                                  are paid a fee. The fee typically would be smaller\n                                                  than an adviser because an introducer typically\n                                                  doesn't have to be regulated. In a sense, an\n                                                  introducer sits in that space where they might be\n                                                  assisting a regulated entity to advise a client.\n                                                  That might be the fund management\n                                                company. Q.You say that is for an\n                                                  introducer. It could also be that introduction or\n                                                  introducing -- which term is more appropriate --\n                                                  could be done as part of, say, someone whom you\n                                                  would describe as an investment adviser or\n                                                  carrying out an investment adviser's role,\n                                                  correct? A.I'm not sure if that fits. An\n                                                  investment adviser's role would incorporate, if\n                                                  you like, the word \"introduction\", but that\n                                                  wouldn't be regarded in terms of an introducer's\n                                                  role. An investment adviser would be introducing,\n                                                  in layman's terms, investments to a\n                                                client.

InStephen Donald Architects Ltd\n                                                v Christopher King[2003] EWHC 1867, the\n                                        parties were friends.

That is the position that the\n                                        defendants now find themselves in. 102    The plaintiffs also resist the\n                                        defendants’ claim for fees in respect of Project Plaza\n                                        by suggesting that the plaintiffs have not been enriched by\n                                        the services rendered by the defendants because those\n                                        services were worth nothing to the plaintiffs or were not\n                                        worth to the plaintiffs the market value of those services.\n                                        In the language of the law of restitution, this is the\n                                        defence of subjective devaluation. 103    The concept of subjective\n                                        devaluation was introduced by Prof Peter Birks in his\n                                        seminal work,An Introduction to the Law\n                                                of Restitution(Clarendon Press, 1985) at\n                                        p 109: The critical distinction is between money and benefits\n                                                in kind. Where the defendant received money, it will\n                                                be impossible on all ordinary facts for him to argue\n                                                that he was not enriched. For money is the very\n                                                measure of enrichment. By contrast benefits in kind\n                                                are less unequivocally enriching because they are\n                                                susceptible to an argument which for convenience can\n                                                be called ‘subjective devaluation’. It\n                                                is an argument based on the presmiss [sic] that benefits in kind\n                                                have a value to a particular individual only so far\n                                                as he chooses to give them value. What matters is\n                                                his choice. The fact that there is a market in the\n                                                good which is in question, or in other words that\n                                                other people habitually choose to have it and thus\n                                                create a demand for it, is irrelevant to the case of\n                                                any one particular individual. He claims the right\n                                                to dissent from that demand. Market value is not his\n                                                value. Suppose that without his knowledge his car\n                                                has been serviced or his roof mended. There is a\n                                                market in car servicing and roof mending. It is easy\n                                                to find the market value of work of that kind, what\n                                                the going rate is between reasonable people. But he\n                                                says that he had decided to go in for do-it-yourself\n                                                or to take the risk of disaster by doing nothing.\n                                                Indeed to make his point he does not even have to\n                                                say that he had actually decided, let alone prove\n                                                that he had decided, to dissociate himself from the\n                                                particular demand. For his point is sufficiently\n                                                made by saying that he has a continuing liberty to\n                                                choose how to apply his particular store of value\n                                                and that in the case of this car-servicing or\n                                                roof-mending he simply had not made his\n                                                choice. 104    The concept is now a part of\n                                        English law. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in the House of\n                                        Lords inSempra Metals Ltd (formerly\n                                                Metallgesellschaft Ltd) v Inland Revenue\n                                                Commissioners[2008] 1 AC 561 also gave\n                                        the following explanation of subjective devaluation (at\n                                        [119]): Here, as elsewhere, the law of restitution is\n                                                sufficiently flexible to achieve a just result. To\n                                                avoid what would otherwise be an unjust outcome the\n                                                court can, in an appropriate case, depart from the\n                                                market value approach when assessing the time value\n                                                of money or, indeed, when assessing the value of any\n                                                other benefit gained by a defendant. What is\n                                                ultimately important in restitution is whether, and\n                                                to what extent, the particular defendant has been\n                                                benefited: seeBurrows, The Law\n                                                  of Restitution, 2nd ed (2002), p 18.A benefit is not always worth\n                                                  its market value to a particular\n                                                  defendant.When it is not it may be\n                                                unjust to treat the defendant as having received a\n                                                benefit possessing the value it has to others. In\n                                                Professor Birks's language, a benefit received by a\n                                                defendant may sometimes be subject to\n                                                ‘subjective devaluation’:An Introduction to the Law of\n                                                  Restitution(1985), p 413. [emphasis added in bold and in italics] 105    It appears to me that the\n                                        plaintiffs’ argument of subjective devaluation is a\n                                        self-serving afterthought. It is true that Project Plaza was\n                                        an abysmal commercial failure. But the failure of Project\n                                        Plaza was due in large part if not exclusively to: (a) the\n                                        plaintiffs’ conscious decision to entrust part of the\n                                        task of overseeing this construction project to the\n                                        defendants, persons who had no experience in overseeing\n                                        construction projects at all and who never held themselves\n                                        out as having such experience; and (b) the first\n                                        plaintiff’s flighty and wholly impractical design\n                                        choices and his inability or unwillingness to accept that\n                                        they could be translated into reality only with difficulty,\n                                        delay and expense.[note: 171] 106    If the defendants had not been\n                                        risk-runners in extending services and incurring expenses in\n                                        connection with Project Plaza, therefore, I would have held\n                                        that it was open to them, in principle, to recover\n                                        compensation for those services and expenses on aquantum meruit. But, for the\n                                        reasons I have set out above, the defendants were risk\n                                        runners. The risk that the defendants ran was the risk of\n                                        the WWW concept failing to come to fruition and yielding the\n                                        anticipated riches. Project Plaza being part of the WWW\n                                        concept, the risk of Project Plaza failing for the reasons I\n                                        have set out above at [106] fell within the risk which the\n                                        defendants ran in extending their services and incurring\n                                        expenses speculatively, without a prior overarching\n                                        agreement.",

I must say in\n                                        conclusion that I was unimpressed by many aspects of the\n                                        evidence and the conduct of both the second and third\n                                        plaintiffs on the one hand and of the first and second\n                                        defendants on the other. Each of those four individuals\n                                        showed themselves, in the historical events in question,\n                                        quite capable of misleading others for their personal\n                                        benefit. All four of them also showed themselves, in their\n                                        evidence before me, of being quite capable of attempting to\n                                        mislead me in order to succeed in this litigation. The\n                                        principal difference between the two groups – and the\n                                        factor which explains the outcome of this action – is\n                                        that the first and second plaintiffs’ attempts to\n                                        mislead were in relation to matters not connected to the\n                                        issues which I had to resolve in this action. 110    For all of these reasons,\n                                        therefore, I have given judgment for the plaintiffs in the\n                                        following terms:[note: 181] (a)     I have made the\n                                                transfer order, the accounting order and the payment\n                                                order. (b)     I have declined to make the tracing\n                                                order at this point in the litigation, without\n                                                precluding the plaintiffs from seeking tracing\n                                                relief against the defendants in the\n                                                  future.[note: 182] (c)     I have\n                                                  dismissed[note: 183]the entirety\n                                                of the defendants’ counterclaim save that I\n                                                have ordered the plaintiffs to pay to the defendants\n                                                a management fee of US$450,000 per annum for the\n                                                years 2009–2010 until the defendants transfer\n                                                to the plaintiffs the PE funds which form the\n                                                subject-matter of the agreement.[note: 184] 111    As for the costs of this\n                                        litigation, I have ordered the defendants to pay the\n                                        plaintiffs’ costs of and incidental to the claim on\n                                        the standard basis and I have given the plaintiffs a\n                                        certificate for more than two solicitors. I have declined to\n                                        order these costs on the indemnity basis. Although the\n                                        defendants’ position on the plaintiffs’ claim\n                                        has been to resist on slight grounds what might otherwise\n                                        appear to be the obvious outcome, and to do so as leverage\n                                        for their counterclaim, I do not consider that it has\n                                        crossed the threshold to justify an order for indemnity\n                                        costs. 112    As for the costs of the\n                                        counterclaim, I have ordered the defendants to pay 75% of\n                                        the costs of the counterclaim to the plaintiffs on the\n                                        standard basis with no certificate for more than two\n                                        solicitors.
