        "Introduction": "1       This case concerns an\n                    agreement for the plaintiff to buy over from the defendants\n                    a company which owns two compressed natural gas\n                    (“CNG”) refueling stations in Singapore for\n                    $25m. The defendants are the only shareholders of the said\n                    company. A “good faith deposit” of $1m was\n                    paid by the plaintiff to the defendants for this purpose.\n                    However, the sale was not completed and the plaintiff wanted\n                    a refund of the $1m. The issue for decision is whether or\n                    not the “good faith deposit” is refundable in\n                    the circumstances of this case. 2       After hearing the\n                    parties’ submissions, I held that the plaintiff\n                    succeeded its claim for the refund of the $1m and the\n                    defendants failed in their counterclaim in respect of three\n                    matters.",
        "Statement of agreed facts": "3       On the first day of trial,\n                    after some discussions, the parties decided that there was\n                    no real factual dispute and agreed to proceed on a question\n                    of interpretation of contract based on a set of agreed\n                    facts. They produced a statement of agreed facts the next\n                    day. The following facts emerged from that\n                statement: 4       The defendants own Smart\n                    Energy Pte Ltd (“the Company”), holding 100%\n                    of the 6,000,001 shares of the Company. At all material\n                    times, the plaintiff was represented by Teo Kiang Ang\n                    (“Teo”), who is the majority shareholder of\n                    the plaintiff and of Union Energy Corporation Pte Ltd\n                    (“Union Energy”). The first defendant was\n                    represented by Johnny Harjantho (“Harjantho”)\n                    and the second defendant was represented by William Aw\n                    (“Aw”). 5       Part of Union Energy’s\n                    business includes the retail of CNG in Singapore. Both Union\n                    Energy and the Company are supplied CNG by Gas Supply Pte\n                    Ltd (“GSPL”), a company owned by Temasek\n                    Holdings (Private) Limited. Apart from Union Energy and the\n                    Company, the only other company registered as a retailer of\n                    CNG in Singapore is Sembcorp Gas Pte Ltd. 6       Part of the\n                    plaintiff’s taxi fleet runs on CNG supplied by Union\n                    Energy while part of the first defendant’s taxi fleet\n                    runs on CNG supplied mainly by the Company. Union Energy has\n                    one CNG refueling station in Singapore (in Old Toh Tuck\n                    Road) while the Company has two (one at Mandai Link and the\n                    other at Serangoon North). 7       In early April 2010, Teo\n                    asked Harjantho about the possibility of the plaintiff\n                    buying over the two stations owned by the Company. Harjantho\n                    and Aw discussed this matter and offered to sell the Company\n                    to Teo for S$32 million. A counter offer of $25 million was\n                    made by Teo, which the parties eventually agreed on, on the\n                    basis that Teo would buy 100% of the issued and paid up\n                    shares in the Company (“the Sale Shares”) and\n                    consequently buy the two stations. This agreement\n                    essentially allowed the plaintiff to acquire the Company\n                    along with its assets and businesses as they were at that\n                    point in time, excluding any receivables and deposits up to\n                    the completion date of the acquisition (which would belong\n                    to the defendants) as well as any debts of the Company up to\n                    the date of completion (which the defendants would have to\n                    settle).",
        "Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)": "8       Initially, the defendants\n                    wanted the $1m deposit to be paid on a non-refundable basis.\n                    After some discussions and four draft MOUs, the parties\n                    executed the MOU on 16 April 2010, Clause 3 of which\n                    reads: 3.1    The Purchase Price payable by\n                            the Purchaser to the Vendors for the Sale Shares\n                            shall be cash of S$25,000,000 (Twenty Five Million\n                            Dollars Only). 3.2    The Purchaser shall at the\n                            time of the execution of this MOU, pay to the\n                            Vendors a good faith deposit of S$1,000,000 (One\n                            Million Dollars) (“the Deposit) in the\n                            following manner:- To SAPL:    $500,000 To BSPL:    $500,000 3.3    In the event that the parties\n                            enter into a definitive Sale and Purchase Agreement,\n                            the Deposit shall be applied towards part payment of\n                            the Purchase Price. 3.4    If the parties fail to enter\n                            into a definitive Sale and Purchase Agreement by\n                            30 April 2010 the Deposit shall be refunded by\n                            the Vendors to the Purchasers within seven (7)\n                            days. 3.5    If the Purchaser is allowed,\n                            under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement\n                            not to complete the sale and purchase of shares and\n                            elects not to complete, the Deposit shall be\n                            refunded by the Vendors to the Purchasers within\n                            seven (7) days of such election 9       Other key clauses of the MOU\n                    state: Recital (D):    The parties intend to\n                            enter into this MOU in order to govern their\n                            relationship prior to the execution of the\n                            definitive documentation for the sale and purchase\n                            of the Shares. 4.3    Except where otherwise agreed\n                            by the parties, all liabilities of the Company\n                            (including all indebtedness due and owing by the\n                            Company to its related corporations, directors and\n                            shareholders) shall be fully settled on or before\n                            the Completion Date. 4.5    The completion of the sale and\n                            purchase shall be conditional upon the satisfactory\n                            results from a legal and financial due diligence\n                            exercise undertaken on the Company. 4.7    The completion of the sale and\n                            purchase shall be conditional upon the Vendors\n                            obtaining all the necessary consents (where\n                            applicable and necessary) from Gas Supply Pte Ltd\n                            (“GSPL”) before the Completion Date to\n                            ensure that GSPL will continue with all their\n                            existing agreements with the Company for the supply\n                            of CNG after completion. 6    During the term of this MOU, the\n                            Vendors shall not take any action either alone or\n                            with any third party, to solicit or enter into any\n                            understanding, contracts or agreements with any\n                            third party with the intention of entering into any\n                            transaction similar to that specified in Clause 1.1\n                            above and shall negotiate exclusively with the\n                            Purchasers in relation to the subject matter of this\n                            MOU. 7    This MOU shall be valid for a\n                            period of fourteen days from the date hereof, unless\n                            terminated earlier or extended by the mutual consent\n                            of the parties.

Accordingly, the Plaintiff paid S$500,000 to each of\n                    the two defendants (S$1 million in total) when the MOU was\n                        signed[note: 1]. The plaintiff\n                    commenced the legal and financial due diligence exercise on\n                    the Company on the day the MOU was signed. It asked for the\n                    CNG supply agreement with GSPL, the JTC leases and valuation\n                    of the defendants’ two stations and relevant licenses\n                    and permits for the Company’s business[note: 2]. 11     On 22 April 2010, the\n                    defendants informed the plaintiff that the documents asked\n                    for would be sent after the share purchase agreement was\n                    signed. On 23 April 2010, Aw sent an email to the\n                    defendants’ then solicitors and the plaintiff’s\n                    solicitors stating that the Company would need to request\n                    GSPL officially for permission to release information on the\n                    CNG supply agreement. On 26 April 2010, the defendants\n                    sent an email to the plaintiffs attaching copies of the\n                    Building Agreements between the Jurong Town Corporation and\n                    the Company with respect to its two stations.\n                    On27 April 2010[note: 3],\n                    the defendants wrote to GSPL to request permission to\n                    release information to the plaintiff regarding their CNG\n                    supply agreement with GSPL. On 17 May 2010, GSPL wrote\n                    the Company objecting to the disclosure of the Terminated\n                    GRA to any prospective buyers. However GSPL agreed to\n                    disclose the letter dated 5 April 2010[note: 4]for the interim supply of\n                    gas to the plaintiff, subject to the Plaintiff providing a\n                    written confidentiality undertaking.",

After all, the due diligence exercise could have\n                    proved to be wholly unsatisfactory, as was the case\n                    here. 21     It was apparent from\n                    Clause 3.1 of the SPA that the $1m would form part of the\n                    consideration for the shares. Hence, without the transfer of\n                    the shares, there would be a total failure of consideration.\n                    Moreover, it was also clear that the plaintiff was primarily\n                    concerned with the continuity of CNG supply from GSPL. Given\n                    the defendants’ failure to produce a GRA with GSPL to\n                    ensure this continuity and with the Letter of Termination\n                    and the Interim Arrangement by GSPL falling short of the\n                    condition precedent in the SPA Clause 4.1 (h), (m) and (n),\n                    the plaintiff submitted that it was entitled to rescind the\n                    agreement and to receive the refund of the $1m deposit\n                    because of total failure of consideration.",
        "Bad faith": "22     The bad faith on the part\n                    of the defendants could be demonstrated from the\n                    following: (a)     Signing an MOU\n                        without disclosing the termination of the GRA, while\n                        knowing full well the importance of the continuity of\n                        CNG supply to the plaintiff; (b)     Not getting a new\n                        GRA and asking that the plaintiff negotiate directly\n                        with GSPL for a new GRA when the MOU (at Clause 4.7) and\n                        the SPA (at Condition 4(h)) both clearly imposed that\n                        obligation on “the\n                    Vendors”; (c)     Disclosing GSPL’s letters of\n                        termination and the interim arrangement only after a\n                        12-week delay from the signing of the MOU even though\n                        these were critical documents. Had the plaintiff been\n                        aware of the termination, the plaintiff would not have\n                        signed the MOU, much less paid the $1m deposit directly\n                        to the defendants (as opposed to paying their solicitors\n                        as stakeholders); and (d)     Asserting that the $1m good\n                        faith deposit was “non-refundable” in\n                        spite of the fact that such a term was never used in the\n                        SPA and was contrary to the specific terms of the MOU as\n                        well. 23     Hence, the plaintiff\n                    prayed for the $1m deposit to be returned with interest\n                    thereon running from 23 August 2010, i.e. 7 days after\n                    the letter dated 16 August 2010, together with costs\n                    (including costs of the summary judgment\n                    applications).",
        "Defendants’ case": "",
        "There exists no clause in the SPA that allows for\n                a refund": "24     The defendants submitted\n                    that the plaintiff’s reliance on Clause 3.5 of the MOU\n                    as a basis for the refund was incorrect. Clause 7.1 of the\n                    MOU clearly stated that the MOU would only be valid for\n                    fourteen days unless extended (which did not happen) and\n                    that it would be superseded by any subsequent definitive\n                    agreement. This would have taken place on 30 April 2010\n                    when the parties signed the SPA. Moreover, considering\n                    Clause 10.2 of the SPA which stated that the SPA\n                    “supersedes any previous agreements or arrangements\n                    between them relating to the subject matter hereof”,\n                    quite clearly the SPA was the only contract that governed\n                    the parties. 25     The SPA itself did not\n                    contain any provision for the refund of the S$1m at all. By\n                    trying to read an entire paragraph from the MOU into the\n                    SPA, the plaintiff was trying to “add” to or\n                    to “vary” the SPA, an act clearly prohibited\n                    by the presence of an ‘Entire Agreement Clause’.\n                    Given that the SPA was first drafted by the\n                    plaintiff’s solicitors, such a refund clause could\n                    easily have been inserted by them. No amount of pre-MOU\n                    negotiations could negate the fact that there was no\n                    provision in the SPA for a refund. 26     To rely on some parts of\n                    the superseded MOU and incorporate them into the SPA would\n                    amount to cherry-picking on the plaintiff’s part, an\n                    act contrary to the principle of having finality in\n                    agreements. Relying on only one clause of the MOU regarding\n                    the refund, the plaintiff ignored the rest of the MOU,\n                    including parts like Recital (D) which expressly stated that\n                    the MOU only governed the parties’ relationship prior\n                    to the execution of the definitive documentation for the\n                    sale and purchase. Clause 9 of the MOU also stated that all\n                    disputes arising out of or in connection with the MOU should\n                    be resolved by way of arbitration, yet the plaintiff chose\n                    to commence this suit. 27     The defendants also argued\n                    that even if the plaintiff could show its entitlement to\n                    elect not to proceed with the completion of the purchase,\n                    based on the conditions precedent listed in Clause 4.1 of\n                    the SPA not being fulfilled, there was still nothing in the\n                    SPA that provided for a refund of the $1m.",
        "Conditions Precedent": "28     The plaintiff based its\n                    right to rescind the SPA on the fact that sometime in\n                    February or March 2010, the Company had failed to make\n                    payment in time for the supply of CNG from GSPL, which\n                    eventually caused GSPL to terminate the existing GRA and\n                    replace it with interim supply arrangements. In response the\n                    defendants submitted that the 4 clauses relied on by the\n                    plaintiff, namely Clause 4.1 (a), (h), (m) and (n), were not\n                    triggered for the following reasons: (a)     Upon receiving\n                        the letter dated 23 March 2010 from GSPL stating\n                        that the GRA was going to be terminated, the Company\n                        paid up all the outstanding sums owed within the\n                        stipulated 7 days, further providing a US$200,000\n                        deposit. Subsequently, the interim supply arrangements\n                        were confirmed via a letter dated 5 April\n                        2010; (b)     Given that the MOU was only entered\n                        on 16 April 2010, any terminated GRA prior to the\n                        5 April 2010 letter should not be relevant to the\n                        plaintiff under the SPA. Accordingly there was no\n                        contractual obligation on the defendants’ part to\n                        have in place terms of the old GRAs for the purpose of\n                        completion contemplated by the SPA;\n                    and (c)     The defendants were as open with the plaintiff as\n                        they could be legally and had no intention of hiding\n                        anything. GSPL objected to disclosing the letter of\n                        termination of the previous GRA and subsequent court\n                        applications by the plaintiff for its disclosure were\n                        also disallowed. Further, the delay in disclosing the\n                        5 April 2010 letter containing the interim supply\n                        arrangements was due to GSPL’s instructions that a\n                        written undertaking be procured from the plaintiff\n                        first. (d)     In relation to the plaintiff’s\n                        claim under Clause 4.1 (h) of the SPA, the existence of\n                        the 5 April 2010 letter stating the interim\n                        arrangements and the events which took place in July and\n                        August 2010 were sufficient to show that all the\n                        necessary consents and approvals from GSPL to ensure the\n                        continuation of CNG supply to the Company were obtained\n                        due to the following reasons: (i)       Where\n                            the plaintiff was buying 100% of the shares, legally\n                            there would be no change of entity involved, as far\n                            as the 5 April 2010 letter was concerned, since\n                            the Company would still be a party to that letter\n                            even after the plaintiff takes over. Hence no\n                            consent or approval would be necessary from\n                            GSPL; (ii)       There were no prohibitions\n                            in the 5 April 2010 letter to stop the\n                            defendants from selling all the shares in the\n                            Company and neither was there any mention of\n                            termination or a contractual end date. Arguably the\n                            arrangements were quite permanent despite the term\n                            “interim” being\n                        used; (iii)       Even if GSPL’s\n                            consent was necessary, the parties’\n                            correspondence from 15 July 2010 to\n                            27 August 2010 showed such consent. Moreover,\n                            the fact that GSPL wanted to meet the plaintiff to\n                            work out a new GRA showed its consent to continue\n                            supplying CNG after the ownership change of the\n                            Company. Since the plaintiff refused to meet GSPL,\n                            the blame could not fall on the\n                        defendants; (iv)       The SPA did not require the\n                            defendants to procure a new GRA, much less one that\n                            was on terms satisfactory to the plaintiff. The SPA\n                            requirement for “continuation of CNG\n                            supply” is different from\n                            “continuity” which connotes a longer\n                            and uninterrupted supply of gas;\n                        and (v)       There was nothing in\n                            evidence that would have caused the plaintiff to\n                            think that GSPL would not consent to a continuation\n                            of the gas supply till after the date of\n                            completion. (e)     In relation to the\n                        plaintiff’s claim under Clause 4.1(a) that the\n                        plaintiff must be satisfied with the results of the due\n                        diligence, even though the defendants admitted that\n                        there may be some ambiguity in reading Clauses 10 and 11\n                        of the 5 April 2010 letter together, the plaintiff\n                        failed to use the opportunity to clarify the meaning\n                        directly with GSPL when it was offered the meeting. The\n                        plaintiff’s refusal to meet GSPL was unreasonable\n                        and hence it had no objective basis for taking the\n                        position that it was not satisfied with the results of\n                        the due diligence exercise; (f)     Since the interim\n                        arrangements contained in the 5 April 2010 letter\n                        were still subsisting and in full force at the date when\n                        the MOU was executed and those arrangements were not\n                        capable of being terminated by reason of the purchase of\n                        the Sale Shares, arguably the plaintiff’s claim\n                        under Clause 4.1 (m) must fail too;\n                    and (g)     Given the subsisting interim arrangements and the\n                        absence of any further notice or other indication from\n                        GSPL that those arrangements would be terminated or\n                        modified, the plaintiff did not have a claim under\n                        Clause 4.1 (n) either.",
        "Not a case of total failure of\n                consideration": "29     Firstly, since the $1m was\n                    paid as a “good faith deposit”, it must\n                    necessarily have been capable of being forfeited once the\n                    contract was terminated by the depositor’s breach.\n                    This is due to the fact that deposits are inherently\n                    forfeitable and whether there exists a right to its return\n                    depends on the conditions of the contract (SeeHowe v Smith(1884) 27 Ch D 89 at\n                    97-98). Merely calling the sum paid a\n                    “deposit” did not entitle the plaintiff to an\n                    automatic right of refund upon the failure to complete the\n                    contract. Since the SPA did not expressly provide for a\n                    refund, the plaintiff must show that it is entitled to such\n                    a refund. 30     Also, there was no total\n                    failure of consideration as the defendants had performed\n                    their contractual duties by, among other things, furnishing\n                    voluminous documents, many of which were confidential and\n                    sensitive in nature, in response to the plaintiff’s\n                    due diligence exercise. Moreover, considering the fact that\n                    the parties were rivals in the same business, the revelation\n                    of internal management accounts and other confidential legal\n                    documents meant that the plaintiff would now know how the\n                    defendants ran their business and how much their cost\n                    centres incurred. Such an advantage to the plaintiff and its\n                    corresponding detriment to the defendants could not be\n                    ignored.",

In fact,\n                    subsequent to the execution of the SPA, the plaintiff found\n                    other means of expanding its CNG business and hence decided\n                    not to proceed with the purchase of the Sale\n                        Shares[note: 11].",

The URA\n                    confirmed via letter that CWM Consulting Engineers had\n                    submitted redevelopment plans for the station and that\n                    clearly went beyond an exercise to test if the URA would\n                    grant permission for redevelopment. It was a submission for\n                    reconstruction and it took place long before the scheduled\n                    completion date of 31 July 2010 without the approval of\n                    the defendants. 33     The plaintiff replied that\n                    there had been a tripartite agreement between Kar\n                    Engineering, the plaintiff and the defendants, under which\n                    all parties were aware of the fact that the plaintiff was\n                    going to buy over the Company. There could not therefore be\n                    any breach of confidentiality. Further, the inquiry sent to\n                    the URA was only about whether some alterations could be\n                    made and that was part of the due diligence\n                exercise.",
        "Refusal to consent to repair works and conversion\n                of trailers": "34     After the SPA was\n                    executed, the defendants wanted to carry out repairs to a\n                    component of the Company’s CNG system called the\n                    “HPU”. Pursuant to Clause 7 of the SPA, they\n                    had to obtain the written consent of the plaintiff but the\n                    plaintiff withheld such consent. As such, the repairs could\n                    only take place after the plaintiff’s alleged\n                    rescission of the SPA which resulted in more loss and\n                    damages as it caused a loss in productivity in the CNG\n                    supply. 35     Additionally, after the\n                    SPA was executed, the defendants wanted to carry out a\n                    conversion of two of the Company’s trailers to\n                    facilitate working with the “NeoGas System” so\n                    that it could go into 24-hour operation. Once again, the\n                    plaintiff refused to give the written consent required\n                    pursuant to Clause 7 of the SPA, resulting in loss and\n                    damages to the defendants. 36     The plaintiff replied that\n                    the defendants were duty-bound under Clause 7.1 of the SPA\n                    to carry on their business as per normal and carrying out\n                    repairs to equipment was part of that business. There was\n                    therefore no need for its consent to be\n                obtained.",
        "S$20,000 cancellation fee from United Overseas\n                Bank (“UOB”)": "37     The defendants were under\n                    an obligation to redeem all their loans from the\n                    Company’s bank, UOB, as part of the sale and purchase\n                    exercise and the necessary notification for the redemption\n                    of loan was given to UOB accordingly. The plaintiff’s\n                    subsequent refusal to complete the sale and purchase\n                    resulted in the defendants having to reinstate the bank\n                    loans and having to pay a reinstatement fee of S$20,000 to\n                    UOB.",
        "Decision of the court": "38     In deciding whether the\n                    $1m deposit was refundable or not, it is important to first\n                    determine whether the agreement set out in the MOU continued\n                    to be binding upon the parties even after the SPA was\n                    executed. Based on Clause 3.5 of the MOU, it was clear that\n                    the deposit was refundable: 3.5    If the Purchaser is allowed,\n                            under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement,\n                            not to complete the sale and purchase of shares and\n                            elects not to complete, the Deposit shall be\n                            refunded by thee Vendors to the Purchasers within\n                            seven (7) days of such election. 39     While the MOU stated in\n                    Clause 7 that it “shall be superseded to the extent\n                    that any definitive agreement is made between the Vendors\n                    and the Purchaser in relation to the subject matter\n                    herein” and Recital (D) stated that “the\n                    parties intend to enter into this MOU in order to govern\n                    their relationship prior to the execution of the definitive\n                    documentation for the sale and purchase of the\n                    Shares”, the MOU was not the last word on this\n                    matter. 40     The SPA itself\n                    contemplated other related agreements in Clause 10.2, the\n                    ‘Entire Agreement Clause’, which reads: 10.2  This Agreement (together with\n                            any documentsreferred to\n                                hereinor executed contemporaneously\n                            by the Parties in connection herewith)constitutes the whole\n                                agreementbetween the Parties hereto\n                            and supersedes any previous agreements or\n                            arrangements between them relating to the subject\n                            matter hereof and it is expressly declared that no\n                            variations hereof shall be effective unless made in\n                            writing signed by duly authorized representatives of\n                            the Parties. [emphasis added] 41     The SPA specifically\n                    referred to the MOU at Recital D: Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding dated\n                            16thApril 2010 entered\n                        into between the Parties, the Purchaser has paid the\n                        Vendors a good faith deposit of S$1,000,000 that will be\n                        applied towards the purchase price for the Sale\n                        Shares. 42     It was also mentioned in\n                    Clause 3.1 of the SPA: 3.1    The Consideration for the sale of the Sale Shares\n                            shall be the sum of S$25,000,000 payable by the\n                            Purchaser to the Vendors as follows: (a)    the sum of S$1,000,000\n                                being the good faith deposit (the\n                                “Deposit”) paid pursuant to the\n                                terms of the Memorandum of Understanding dated\n                                16 April 2010 between the Parties;\n                                and … 43     Hence, on the face of\n                    Clause 10.2 of the SPA, it was clear that the MOU, being one\n                    of the documents referred to in the SPA, constituted part of\n                    the whole agreement between the parties. This did not\n                    contradict Clause 7 of the MOU, which simply meant that if\n                    and when inconsistencies arose between the SPA and the MOU,\n                    it would be the SPA that prevailed. Clause 7 should not be\n                    read, as the defendants argued, to mean that the MOU would\n                    be automatically and completely extinguished upon the\n                    signing of the SPA. That would be an unreasonably\n                    restrictive and narrow reading in the light of the SPA\n                    itself mentioning the MOU. 44     This reading is consistent\n                    with cases likeD’Oz International\n                        Pte Ltd v PSB Corp Pte Ltd[2010] SGHC 88,\n                    where Chan Sek Keong CJ held that a term sheet and a\n                    preliminary agreement which were referred to in a franchise\n                    agreement formed part of the parties’ legal agreement\n                    and that they should have been given legal effect. This was\n                    so even though there was a similar “entire, full and\n                    complete” agreement clause in the franchise\n                    agreement. Also, inNg Giap Hon v\n                        Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd and other[2009]\n                    SGCA 19, the Court of Appeal stated that it was “not\n                    prepared to state that an entire agreement clause can never\n                    exclude the implication of terms into a contract”,\n                    further adding that “for an entire agreement clause\n                    to have this effect, it would need to express such effect in\n                    clear and unambiguous language”. On that point, where\n                    the SPA is silent on whether or not the deposit is\n                    refundable, Clause 10.2 of the SPA cannot be read to exclude\n                    the MOU entirely when the MOU spelt out the parties’\n                    agreement on an issue not mentioned in the SPA and which\n                    issue is still alive and not spent. 45     InZurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior\n                        Design & Construction Pte Ltd[2008] SGCA\n                    27, a permissive stance was taken by the Court of Appeal\n                    towards extrinsic evidence which can explain and illuminate\n                    written words of an agreement so that the court can better\n                    give effect to the intention of the parties. Similarly, inLee Chee Wei v Tan HorPeow Victor and\n                        others[2007] SGCA 22, it was held that\n                    “the courts will strive to give effect to the\n                    parties’ expressed intent and their legitimate\n                    expectations. The courts seek to honour the legitimate\n                    expectations that the parties hold when they enter into a\n                    contract.” In the present case, the evidence of the\n                    parties’ negotiations leading to the execution of the\n                    MOU showed that the $1m was meant to be a refundable\n                        deposit[note: 12]and to decide\n                    otherwise by excluding the MOU would certainly defeat the\n                    parties’ legitimate expectations. It was therefore\n                    from both the expressed intention and the negotiations that\n                    the MOU was indeed still in force and binding upon the\n                    parties at least in so far as the deposit was\n                    concerned. 46     Having decided the issue\n                    of whether the MOU was in force or not, I now consider\n                    “if the Purchaser (was) allowed, under the terms of\n                    the Sale and Purchase Agreement, not to complete the sale\n                    and purchase of shares” (Clause 3.5 of the MOU) in\n                    order to determine if a refund should be made by the\n                    defendants. 47     The wording of Clause 4.1\n                    (h) placed the onus on “the Vendors”, that is,\n                    the defendants collectively, to “ensure the\n                    continuation of the supply of compressed natural gas to the\n                    CNG Stations after the Completion Date notwithstanding the\n                    transaction contemplated herein”. It was plain that\n                    the defendants had failed to do this and the plaintiff was\n                    accordingly entitled to invoke Clause 4.3 and elect\n                    non-completion. The fact that plaintiff had been given\n                    opportunities to meet GSPL in order to negotiate further did\n                    not detract from the defendants’ duty. There was no\n                    doubt that the plaintiff had put a high premium on making\n                    sure that the CNG supply would carry on after the takeover\n                    and the defendants, despite being cognizant of that, did not\n                    discharge the burden of producing a GRA with GSPL to ensure\n                    the continuation of the supply. 48     The defendants’\n                    contention that the interim arrangements put in place by the\n                    5 April 2010 letter from GSPL were more than sufficient\n                    to satisfy the continuation requirements was not acceptable.\n                    Clause 11 of that letter shows why the interim arrangements\n                    were cold comfort for the plaintiff. It reads: 11.    Termination: Subject to\n                            paragraph 10 hereinabove, GSPL may in its sole and\n                            absolute discretion and for whatever reason,\n                            terminate this Letter upon giving SMART at least\n                            three (3) days’ notice. 49     With the very real\n                    possibility of GSPL terminating the supply at will, the\n                    interim arrangements fell far short of giving any assurance\n                    of having a continuation of the supply of CNG. The inability\n                    to have any confidence in the continuation of the supply of\n                    CNG from the dominant CNG wholesaler in Singapore would\n                    defeat the very purpose of buying the two CNG stations and\n                    that would surely give the plaintiff the right not to\n                    complete the sale. The defendants’ contention that the\n                    fault lay with the plaintiff refusing to meet directly with\n                    GSPL to clarify the meaning of ambiguous clauses and to\n                    negotiate a new GRA shifted their obligation of ensuring the\n                    continuation of supply of CNG to one of merely providing an\n                    opportunity to the plaintiff of ensuring a continuation of\n                    the supply. 50     The first two heads of the\n                    defendants’ counterclaim can stand whether or not the\n                    plaintiff succeeds in its claim whereas the third head of\n                    the counterclaim would automatically fall if the\n                    plaintiff’s claim succeeds. 51     The first head of the\n                    counterclaim fails as the plaintiff’s actions were\n                    within the scope of conducting a reasonable due diligence\n                    exercise. The plaintiff therefore did not breach Clause 8.2\n                    of the SPA. Given that Kar Engineering would eventually be\n                    the plaintiff’s tenant if the agreement had been\n                    completed, contacting Kar Engineering would certainly have\n                    been a reasonable part of the plaintiff’s due\n                    diligence exercise. The same conclusion applies to the\n                    disclosure to the URA as the correspondence was nothing more\n                    than part of the plaintiff’s due diligence in making\n                    sure that their future plans for the stations would be\n                    viable. In any event, I do not see what damages could have\n                    been suffered by the defendants by the disclosure of an\n                    impending sale to a public authority. 52     The second head of the\n                    counterclaim concerns whether Clauses 7.1 and 7.2 of the SPA\n                    required the plaintiff to obtain the defendants’\n                    consent for repairs work to be done on the HPU and for the\n                    conversion of trailers. While it was disputed by the parties\n                    whether consent was even sought or not, I do not think that\n                    consent was required if the work was indeed repair work,\n                    that is, work that would be required in order for the\n                    defendants to “carry out business only in the\n                    ordinary course consistent with past practices” as\n                    prescribed in Clause 7.1. Such a move would not “make\n                    any change in the nature, scope or organization of its\n                    business or dispose of the whole of its undertaking or\n                    property…” (Clause 7.2 (b)) and hence would\n                    not require the plaintiff’s written consent. Moreover,\n                    in the light of the impending sale, it was hard to see why\n                    the defendants would engage in anything more than repair and\n                    maintenance works that would allow them to continue running\n                    the business in the ordinary course. I therefore dismiss\n                    this head of the counterclaim too. 53     The last head of the\n                    counterclaim regarding the $20,000 reinstatement fee charged\n                    by UOB is contingent on my ruling on the plaintiff’s\n                    claim. As the plaintiff has succeeded in its claim, this\n                    last head of the counterclaim fails since the plaintiff was\n                    not at fault in not completing the sale and\n                purchase. 54     In summary, the plaintiff\n                    succeeds in its claim against the defendants for the refund\n                    of the $1m good faith deposit paid pursuant to the MOU.\n                    Notwithstanding the fact that the statement of claim pleaded\n                    a claim of $500,000 against each defendant, the MOU and the\n                    SPA treat both defendants collectively as\n                    “vendors” and Clause 3.5 of the MOU provides\n                    for the deposit of $1m to be refunded by the said\n                    “vendors”, i.e. both defendants jointly. I\n                    also award the plaintiff interest on the said $1m at 5.33%\n                    per annum from the date of writ until judgment, as pleaded,\n                    and thereafter interest at the same rate until payment. The\n                    defendants’ counterclaim is dismissed in its entirety.\n                    The defendants are to pay the plaintiff the costs of the\n                    claim and the counterclaim. 55     Both defendants have\n                    appealed against this decision. 56     I thank counsel for both\n                    parties for having agreed to proceed with the trial by way\n                    of a statement of agreed facts. It was a sensible move which\n                    saved time and costs for everyone involved.
