        "Background": "2. On 11 March 1997, KHPL granted Ms Yeo an option to purchase the property at\n\nthe price of $1,960,000. Under the terms of the option, completion of the sale and purchase was\n\nscheduled for 13 June 1997. On 2 May 1997, Ms Yeo exercised the option. Three weeks later, she\n\nbecame aware that the property was subject to road reserves that would affect her ability to extend\n\nthe house and, on 30 May 1997, she purported to rescind the sale and purchase on that ground.3. KHPL did not accept the rescission of the sale and purchase agreement. On 17\n\nJune 1997, four days after the scheduled completion date, KHPL served a notice on Ms Yeo requiring\n\nher to complete the purchase of the property within 21 days thereafter. Ms Yeo ignored this notice.\n\nInstead, she commenced this action against,inter alia, KHPL, seeking a declaration that she\n\nwas entitled to rescind the sale and purchase agreement and the return of the ten percent deposit\n\nwhich she had paid KHPL. KHPL denied that there was such a rescission and put in a counterclaim for\n\nspecific performance of the agreement or, alternatively, damages.4. In late July 1997, some time after the counterclaim had been filed, KHPL\n\ninstructed a property agent to market and sell the property. Advertisements for the sale of the\n\nproperty appeared in the newspapers between August and October 1997. Enquiries were made and the\n\nproperty was shown to a few prospective purchasers but no sale contract materialised.5. The trial took place in August 1998. During the course of the trial, KHPL\n\nabandoned their claim for specific performance and elected to pursue their claim for damages\n\ninstead. In November 1998, the trial judge dismissed Ms Yeos claim against KHPL, gave judgment in\n\nfavour of KHPL on the counterclaim and ordered that there be an assessment of the damages to be paid\n\nto KHPL. It should also be noted that there was a second defendant in the case, the solicitor, Mr\n\nNg, who had originally advised Ms Yeo on the purchase. At first instance Ms Yeo was not successful\n\nin her claim against the solicitor but she succeeded on appeal. The practical result was that any\n\ndamages ordered to be paid by Ms Yeo to KHPL would actually be borne by Mr Ng.",
        "The assessment": "6. The main legal issue canvassed during the assessment was whether the date at\n\nwhich the damages sustained by KHPL should be assessed was the date of the breach of contract ie 13\n\nJune 1997 when Ms Yeo failed to complete the purchase or whether it was the date at which KHPL\n\nelected to pursue their remedy in damages instead of insisting on specific performance ie August\n\n1998. The Assistant Registrar held that by instructing the property agent to market and sell the\n\nproperty in July 1997, KHPL had clearly elected to accept Ms Yeos repudiation of the agreement\n\nand indicated their intention not to pursue the remedy of specific performance. She concluded that\n\nit was therefore appropriate to assess damages as at the date of the breach.7. On the evidence before her, the Assistant Registrar found that the value of\n\nthe property as at 30 June 1997 had been $1.8 million. The difference between that value and the\n\ncontract price of $1.96 million was $160,000 and the Assistant Registrar awarded KHPL that sum as\n\ndamages for breach of contract. In addition, she held that they were entitled to the estimated costs\n\nof a resale on 13 June 1997 and awarded them the sum of $25,000 under this head. She further held\n\nthat the total amount of damages awarded to KHPL of $185,000 should be set off against the deposit\n\nof $196,000 which had been received by KHPL pursuant to the terms of the option. Since the deposit\n\nexceeded the damages, she concluded that KHPL had only recovered nominal damages. As a result, an\n\norder for costs was made against KHPL.8. KHPL has appealed against the above findings and orders.",
        "The law": "9. The law relating to an award of damages in lieu of an order for specific\n\nperformance of a contract for the sale and purchase of land has been canvassed fairly frequently\n\nbefore the courts of Singapore. The most recent reported decision, and one that contains an\n\nexcellent analysis of the legal position, is that ofHo Kian Siang v Ong Cheng Hoo[2000] 4 SLR 376. There, Lee Seiu Kin JC, considered the leading authority ofJohnson v Agnew[1980] AC 367, as well as the following local cases:Indian Overseas Bank v Cheng Lai Geok[1992] 2 SLR 38,Meng Leong Development v Jip Hong Trading Co[1984-1985] SLR 27andTay Joo Sing v\n\nKu Yu Sang[1994] 3 SLR 719.10. Having set out the five propositions of law put forward by Lord Wilberforce\n\ninJohnson v Agnew, Lee JC noted:From these propositions it can be seen that, in respect of contracts capable\n\n  of specific performance, the law does not require the innocent party at the time of breach, to\n\n  accept the repudiation and treat the contract as discharged. He is permitted to pursue his remedy\n\n  of seeking an order for specific performance, whether exclusively or as an alternative to damages.\n\n  However if he proceeds in the alternative, at the trial he would be required to elect which remedy\n\n  to pursue, ie whether specific performance or damages. The question before me is as follows: if\n\n  the innocent party elects for damages only at the trial, what would be the appropriate date for\n\n  the assessment of such damages.11. The Judge went on to hold that the date of trial was the correct date for\n\nassessing damages. In doing so, Lee JC followed the decision of the Privy Council in theMeng\n\nLeong Developmentcase that endorsed the trial judges selection of the date of trial as the\n\ndate for the assessment of the damages. Lee JC also cited the commentary in para 960 of 44(1)Halsburys\n\nLaws of England(4thEd, Reissue) to the effect that where damages were awarded in\n\nlieu of specific performance, the normal rule that damages should be assessed as of the date of the\n\nbreach of contract did not apply. The selection of the appropriate date was at the courts\n\ndiscretion but the date usually chosen was the date at which the remedy of specific performance\n\nceased to be available. Lee JC opined that if damages were to be assessed as at the date of the\n\nbreach, then the right given to the innocent party to seek specific performance would be\n\nworthless. If the innocent party were required to mitigate his damages from the time of breach he\n\nwould in effect be confined to seeking his remedy in damages (at  30). With respect, I entirely\n\nagree with this observation.12. Having considered the above-mentioned cases and the other authorities cited\n\nby both counsel, it appears to me to be settled that an innocent party who sues for the specific\n\nperformance of a contract for the sale and purchase of land or, in the alternative for damages, and\n\nwho elects at the trial to pursue only the damages claim, is prima facie entitled to have those\n\ndamages assessed as at the date of trial. The selection of the date is, however, at the courts\n\ndiscretion and, as the same passage fromHalsburyspoints out, if the innocent purchaser\n\nhas been guilty of delay in pursuing his claim, assessment may be directed at an earlier date. This\n\nis precisely what happened in theTay Joo Singcase where 25 months elapsed between the date\n\nwhen the vendor wrongfully repudiated the contract and the date when the innocent purchaser\n\ncommenced action against him for specific performance.13. Delay in seeking a remedy is not the only reason why the court might decide\n\nnot to select the date of trial as the date of assessment. The same passage inHalsburymentioned\n\nother factors that might persuade a court that it would be unjust to select this date. In the\n\npresent case, there is no allegation that KHPL delayed in seeking their remedy. No such allegation\n\ncan be made since once action started, KHPL was expeditious in its filing of its counterclaim for\n\nspecific performance and/or damages.14. The submission made by Mr Lazim, counsel for Mr Ng, was that the date of the\n\ntrial was not the appropriate date in this case because the act of KHPL in instructing the property\n\nagent in July 1997 to sell the property amounted to a clear intention on their part to accept the\n\nrepudiation of Ms Yeo and to go into the market in order to mitigate their loss. It was\n\nsubmitted that such act was clearly inconsistent with KHPLs contention that they were, at the\n\nmaterial time, seeking to affirm the agreement and claiming specific performance instead. This\n\nintention to accept Ms Yeos repudiation was communicated to the public at large including Ms Yeo,\n\nvia the many advertisements for the sale of the property.15. Mr Lazims argument went this way. First he cited the passage from Lee JCs\n\njudgment which pointed out that the innocent party to a contract capable of specific performance is\n\npermitted, in the event of a breach, to pursue his remedy of seeking an order for specific\n\nperformance, whether exclusively or as an alternative to damages. That party would, however, if he\n\nproceeded in the alternative, be required at the trial to elect which remedy to pursue. Mr Lazim\n\nthen submitted that at law an election requires an intention on the part of the innocent party to\n\nchoose one of two remedies which choice was communicated to the other party or to do an unequivocal\n\nact, such act being done to the knowledge of the other party. As a general rule, I have no quarrel\n\nwith that proposition. I would point out that in this case, by making a claim in court for both\n\nremedies, KHPL was indicating that they had not yet decided which remedy they really wanted and were\n\nreserving their position.16. Counsel went on to submit that the party who elects to pursue his alternative\n\nclaim for damages in lieu of specific performance must clearly elect to accept the repudiation by\n\nthe other party and is then subject to his duty to mitigate his loss. I do not agree with this\n\nargument because in a case like the present where the election need not take place until the date of\n\ntrial there can be no question of a duty to mitigate arising when at the trial the innocent party\n\nelects damages instead of specific performance. If the election took place at any date prior to the\n\ntrial then, subject to any contractual provision relating to the assessment of damages (for example\n\nCondition 29 of the Law Societys Conditions of Sale) I would think that the date for assessment\n\nwould be the date of the election. If that were taken as the date no question of mitigation would\n\narise either.17. Further, the act of election, if it is said to be constituted by anything\n\nother than an express statement that the innocent party is no longer pursuing the remedy of specific\n\nperformance, must be an action which puts it beyond the power of the innocent party to deliver\n\nspecific performance subsequently. In this connection, I refer toJohnson v Agnewwhich\n\nindicated the correct date as being the date when the contract is lost. In the context of the\n\npresent case where by counterclaiming for specific performance, KHPL had impliedly undertaken that\n\nthey would be able to deliver title to the property to Ms Yeo should the court order it, no action\n\nof theirs testing the market for possible alternative purchasers could result in the contract being\n\nlost vis--vis Ms Yeo. They would only have put it beyond their power to complete their sale and\n\npurchase with Ms Yeo if they had granted an option in respect of the property to a third party or\n\nentered into a sale and purchase contract with a third party. Scouting around for prospective\n\npurchasers was not, in my opinion, an irrevocable change of their position. It was an invitation to\n\ntreat and not an irrevocable offer to sell.18. It was further submitted that KHPL in claiming specific performance had\n\nchosen to place the matter in the hands of a court of equity and would be governed by equitable\n\nprinciples. Since KHPL had instructed their agent to market the property and had communicated to the\n\npublic at large their intention of selling the property, an action which it was submitted was\n\ninconsistent with their on-going claim to specific performance, it would be inequitable for KHPL to\n\ncontend that they did not elect to abandon their claim for specific performance until the trial.19. I cannot accept this submission. The act of KHPL in marketing the property\n\nand in informing the public that they were interested in offers for it did not affect Ms Yeo in any\n\nway. She did not act on that knowledge to her detriment. Her position was not changed by KHPLs\n\nattempts at a resale. At all times, she was adamant in her stand that she was not obliged to buy the\n\nproperty and was entitled to the return of her deposit. I do not see anything inequitable in the\n\ncourse pursued by KHPL. As the innocent party they were entitled, while pursuing the remedy of\n\nspecific performance which the law gave them, to cast around to ascertain whether their interests\n\nwould be better served if they accepted Ms Yeos repudiation and resold the property to some one\n\nelse. One of the ways of doing this was to ask their agent to market it for them. Until and unless\n\nthe marketing arrangements resulted in KHPL being unable to deliver title to the property to Ms Yeo,\n\nthere would be no negative impact on her rights nor any inconsistency between KHPLs actions and\n\nits on-going claim for specific performance. Accordingly, until that time, nothing would have\n\nhappened which a court of equity would have to take note of.20. This appeal must be allowed. I accordingly set aside the orders below. I will\n\nsee the parties on the consequential orders to be made.21. Although it is no longer relevant since the damages which KHPL will now\n\nrecover would exceed the amount of the deposit, I should state my view that even on the damages\n\nawarded to them below, they were entitled to costs. A sum of $185,000 cannot be considered nominal.\n\nThe fact that the amount of damages was lower than the amount of the deposit does not make it\n\nnominal. KHPL did not forfeit the deposit and then sue for additional damages. In this case, the\n\ndeposit was not the measure of the damages. The deposit was retained because KHPL were seeking\n\nspecific performance and not because they were claiming to be entitled to the deposit as their\n\ndamages. Thus as long as KHPL were eventually awarded more than a nominal amount as damages they\n\nwould be entitled to costs notwithstanding that the amount awarded did not exceed the deposit paid.",
