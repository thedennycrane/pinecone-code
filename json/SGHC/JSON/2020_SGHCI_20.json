        "Conclusion": "32 On the facts of this case I do not consider that a separate notice of appeal on costs is necessary so that leave to serve one is not required. However, in circumstances where one party contends that it is, the right course is to grant leave to appeal so that the Plaintiffs are protected should my primary conclusion be held to be wrong. I therefore grant leave to appeal out of time. 33 So far as costs are concerned, it can fairly be said that the Plaintiffs have made an unnecessary application but equally it can be said that the Defendants have failed in opposing the application for leave to amend. In all the circumstances I consider that each party should bear its own costs of the application. There will therefore be no order as to costs.   Simon Thorley International Judge Chin Li Yuen Marina, Alcina Lynn Chew Aiping, Siew Guo Wei, Darren Ng Zhen Qiang, Germaine Teo and Joseph Lim (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the plaintiffs; Davinder Singh s/o Amar Singh SC, Lin Xianyang Timothy, Tan Mao Lin, Gerald Paul Seah Yong Sing and Joshua Chia Sheng Rong (Davinder Singh Chambers LLC) for the defendants.",
