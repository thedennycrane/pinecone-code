        "Introduction": "1 By this limitation action, the Plaintiffs sought to limit their liability and constitute a limitation fund in respect of claims arising from the running aground of the vesselAS Fortuna(“the Vessel”) at or around Guayaquil, Ecuador on or around 13 September 2018 (“the Incident”). 2 The 1st Plaintiff is the registered owner of the Vessel. The 2nd Plaintiff is a limited partnership organised under the laws of the Netherlands, of which the 1st Plaintiff is the General Partner. The Defendants are potential claimants against the Plaintiffs and/or the Vessel in respect of the Incident. 3 None of the Defendants contested the Plaintiffs’ entitlement to limit liability and constitute a limitation fund.  They also did not oppose the Plaintiffs’ application to have the limitation fund constituted by way of a letter of undertaking from a Protection and Indemnity Club (“LOU”). The only issues in dispute before me were: (a) the applicable interest rate to be provided for in the LOU in respect of the periodafterthe constitution of the limitation fund (“the post-constitution interest rate”); and (b) the appropriate costs order to be made. These are my grounds of decisions on the foregoing two issues.",
        "Interest rate on limitation funds": "4 The parties were in agreementthat: (a) the limitation fund should include interest from the date of the Incident to the date of constitution of the limitation fund (“the pre-constitution interest”), calculated at 5.33%per annum; (b) this pre-constitution interest rate is applicable to both funds constituted by payment into court and funds constituted by production of LOUs; (c) a shipowner constituting a limitation fund by payment into court need not concern itself with post-constitution interest, as it is expected that the fund would earn interest while remaining in court, and the interest so earned would be added to the fund for the benefit of persons claiming against the fund; and (d) conversely, provision ought to be made for post-constitution interest where a limitation fund is constituted by way of a guarantee or LOU. 5 Regarding the appropriate post-constitution interest rate, the Plaintiffs proposed the rate of 2%per annumwhile the 2nd and 3rd Defendants proposed the rate of 5.33%per annum.",
        "Parties’ submissions": "6 The Plaintiffs brought to my attention the following local precedents concerning limitation funds constituted by production of LOUs: (a)Pacific International Lines (Pte) Ltd and others v Govan Mani & Co Pty Ltd and othersHC/ADM 17/2016 (28 March 2017)  (“Pacific International Lines”)which fixed both the pre- and post-constitution interest rates at 5.33%per annum; (b)Thoresen Shipping Singapore Pte Ltd and others v Global Symphony SA and othersHC/ADM 46/2017 (25 July 2017) which fixed the pre-constitution interest rate at 5.33%per annumand the post-constitution interest rate at 2%per annum; and (c)Falcon Grace Pte Ltd and others v Vopak Terminals Singapore Pte Ltd and othersHC/ADM 116/2017 (19 April 2018) which fixed the pre-constitution interest rate at 5.33%per annumand the post-constitution interest rate at 2%per annum. 7 The Plaintiffs submitted that the guiding principle is that the claimants’ position should not differ depending on whether the limitation fund is constituted by payment into court or by production of an LOU. If the limitation fund were paid into court, it would earn interest while the moneys remained in court, but the interest so earned would not be as high as 5.33%per annum. Therefore, the post-constitution interest rate applicable to a limitation fund constituted by way of an LOU should not be 5.33%perannum. Instead, it should approximate the interest that would be earned by moneys paid into court. The Plaintiff suggested that 2%per annumwould be a good approximation. 8 The 3rd Defendant made two submissions. First, 2%per annumwas probably an underestimation of the interest that could be earned on moneys paid into court. Secondly, since the Plaintiffs were not paying the limitation fund into court, they would retain the use of the moneys and would likely generate a higher return for themselves compared to the interest that could be earned on moneys paid into court. The Plaintiffs should therefore pay more in post-constitution interest than the interest which could be earned on moneys paid into court. 9 The 2nd Defendant submitted that there was a clear difference between payment into court and production of an LOU. In the latter case, the shipowner retains continued use of the moneys after the limitation fund is constituted, in the same way that it had use of the same moneys prior to the constitution of the fund. Therefore, if 5.33%per annumwas a fair interest rate to adopt for the period before the constitution of the fund, it should equally apply to the period after the constitution of the fund. 10 The Plaintiffs responded that fixing the post-constitution interest rate at 5.33%per annumwould discourage the use of LOUs to constitute limitation funds. It would also remove the incentive to constitute limitation funds early in cases where the limitation fund is constituted by way of an LOU.",
        "Analysis": "25 It would be convenient to begin the analysis with the case ofThe“Alletta” (No 2)[1972] 2 QB 399 (“Alletta(No 2)”). The case concerned a limitation action brought pursuant to s 503 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 (c 60) (UK), under which the shipowners bore the burden of proving that the occurrences in respect of which limitation of liability were sought took place “without their actual fault and privity”. The first defendants inAlletta(No 2)unsuccessfully contested the plaintiffs’ entitlement to limit liability. On the issue of costs, Dunn J held as follows (at 405E): In exercising my discretion, I propose to follow the practice long established in the Admiralty court and to order the plaintiffs to pay the costs of obtaining anundefendeddecree, but so far as the costs of the contested issue of actual fault and privity are concerned, those costs will follow the event and will be paid by the first defendants to the plaintiffs. [emphasis added] 26 As for the exact form of the order to give effect to Dunn J’s ruling, the plaintiffs submitted that the plaintiffs should pay the defendants’ costs down to 9 July 1968, and the first defendants should pay the plaintiffs’ costs thereafter. The plaintiffs reasoned that, as 9 July 1968 was the date the summons came before the registrar and he ordered pleadings, the limitation decree could have been made by the registrar on that day had there been no contest by the first defendants. The first defendants submitted that 11 October 1971 would be the more appropriate date, as that was the date of the order for directions. Dunn J picked 1 July 1971 as the appropriate date, giving the following reasons (at 405H–406A): I bear in mind that under the Rules of the Supreme Court defendants to limitation actions are entitled to time for further inquiries before a decree is made, even a decree by the registrar, and that in this case as in many cases foreign owners and evidence of foreign practice were involved. Therefore I do not think it reasonable to assume that the registrar would have made an order on July 9, 1968. Reasonable time must be given to parties and their advisers to investigate the plaintiffs’ case and to decide whether or not to dispute it. In this case discovery was given by the plaintiffs by November 1970 and, doing the best I can between the parties, I think that July 1, 1971, is a reasonable date by which the defendants should have completed all inquiries. 27 AlthoughAlletta(No 2)was a decision on costs in a contested application, Dunn J had equated the “costs of obtaining an undefended decree” with the costs incurred till 1 July 1971. It was therefore a premise ofAlletta(No 2)that, in an uncontested application, the plaintiff should pay the defendant’s costs reasonably incurred in investigating the plaintiff’s case in order to decide whether or not to dispute it. 28Alletta (No 2)was subsequently considered inThe“Capitan San Luis”[1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 573 (“Capitan San Luis”), which similarly involved a contested application where the claimant unsuccessfully contested the shipowner’s right to limit liability. On costs, the main issue was whether the principles laid down inAlletta(No 2)should continue to apply, now that Art 4 of the 1976 Convention placed the burden on a claimant contesting limitation to prove that the loss resulted from the shipowner’s “personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such loss, or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss would probably result”. Clarke J held that those principles should no longer apply, remarking (at 578) that: There is a radical difference between the case where the shipowner must prove that the damage occurred without his actual fault or privity before he is entitled to a decree and the case where the shipowner is entitled to a decree unless the claimant proves either that he intended to cause the loss or that he acted recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result. 29 Clarke J went on to hold (at 579) that: … the shipowner must pay the costs of proving those matters which he must prove in order to obtain a decree and that the claimant must pay the costs of investigating and determining the facts which the Convention provides that he must prove if, at the end of the day, he fails to establish those facts. This holding consists of two limbs. First, the shipowner should pay the costs in relation to those matters for which the burden of proof lies on it. Secondly, the claimant should pay the costs of investigating and determining the facts for which the burden of proof lies on it,ifit fails to establish those facts. 30 The first limb is phrased in a manner which applies to both contested and uncontested applications (in the same way that the first limb of the ruling inAlletta(No 2)was applicable to both contested and uncontested applications). The second limb is phrased in a manner which applies only to contested applications. In other words,Capitan San Luisdid not deal directly with what the position ought to be for the costs items referred to in the second limbin an uncontested application. Nevertheless, the clear implication, from the wayCapitan San Luisdeparted fromAlletta(No 2), is that the shipowner no longer has to pay the claimant’s costs for these items even in an uncontested application under the 1976 Convention. 31 What then of the passage fromLimitation of Liability on Maritime Claimscited by the 3rd Defendant at [23] above? I did not think that passage supported the 2nd and 3rd Defendants’ position. While the passage states that the “costs of this important initial investigative work should be recoverable” by the claimant from the shipowner, the use of the word “this” indicates that the “investigative work” contemplated relates only to the matters listed in the preceding sentence –ie,liability, size of the limitation fund and amount of the likely claim. The list does not include matters which, pursuant to Art 4 of the 1976 Convention, the claimant must prove in order to break limitation. 32 Having said that, I should also point out that it was not entirely clear to me why the list in the passage includes “liability” and “amount of the likely claim”. Since the 1976 Convention does not place on the shipowner the burden of proof for these two matters, I did not see why the shipowner should bear the claimant’s costs of looking into these two matters. 33 Having established that, in an uncontested application, the shipowner need not pay the claimant’s costs of investigating and determining the facts for which the burden of proof lies on the claimants, the question that remained was whether the court should swing to the other end of the spectrum and require claimants to pay the shipowner’s costs in relation to such matters even in an uncontested application. 34 In the present case, after the application was filed, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants sought information from the Plaintiffs concerning the Incident in order to decide whether to oppose the Plaintiffs’ application to limit liability. Several rounds of requests and voluntary disclosures took place before the 2nd and 3rd Defendants decided not to contest the Plaintiffs’ right to limit liability. No applications were made for discovery under O 70 r 37(6) of the ROC. 35 While the Plaintiffs would have incurred costs in attending to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants’ requests, I did not think the 2nd and 3rd Defendants should be asked to pay such costs. In this regard, O 70 r 37(6) of the ROC provides that where it appears to the Registrar that “any defendant has not sufficient information to enable him to decide whether or not to dispute that the plaintiff has a right to limit his liability”, directions shall be given to enable the defendant to obtain such information. This underscores that procedural fairness requires claimants to be provided with such information, which are often known only to the shipowner. Imposing this category of costs against the claimants would hamper legitimate requests for such information.",
        "Costs of uncontested limitation decrees": "23 The 3rd Defendant submitted that the Plaintiffs should pay the Defendants’ costs as that was the “usual order”. The 2nd Defendant echoed the 3rd Defendant’s position and further submitted that the costs to be paid by the Plaintiffs should include the costs of investigative work undertaken by the Defendants in order to decide whether to contest the Plaintiffs’ right to limit liability. In support of the foregoing contentions, the 3rd Defendant brought to my attention the following passage from Griggs, William & Farr,Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims(Informa, 4th Ed, 2005) (“Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims”)at p 72: (ii) General costs of limitation It is submitted that in all cases involving limitation the claimant will need to establish liability, the size of the limitation fund and the amount of the likely claim before deciding whether it is necessary (or feasible) to challenge the [shipowner’s] right to invoke limitation.Thereasonable costs of this important initial investigative work should be recoverable from the [shipowner].The claimant will be exposed in relation to his own costs and those of the [shipowner’s] if he pursues the issue of limitation beyond that point. [emphasis added] 24 The Plaintiffs responded that, while the 2nd and 3rd Defendants’ submissions may reflect the position before the 1976 Convention, that position should no longer apply under the 1976 Convention. This was because the 1976 Convention reversed the burden of proof for breaking limits. Consequently, the Plaintiffs should be liable only for the costs incurred in establishing the matters for which the Plaintiffs bore the burden of proof, and should not be liable for the costs of investigative work undertaken by the Defendants in order to decide whether to contest the Plaintiffs’ right to limit liability.",
        "Conclusion on costs": "36 In the light of the foregoing discussion, the following principles should apply to costs ofuncontestedlimitation decrees: (a) The shipowner should pay the claimants’ costs in relation to those matters for which the burden of proof lies on the shipowner. These would include establishing the shipowner’sprima facieright to limit liability pursuant to Arts 1, 2 and 3 of the 1976 Convention and determining the limitation amount pursuant to Arts 6 and 7 of the 1976 Convention. Where an LOU is used to constitute the limitation fund, it will also include establishing the LOU’s adequacy and acceptability. (b) In respect of matters for which the burden of proof lies on the claimant (eg, facts required to break limitation pursuant to Art 4 of the 1976 Convention), while the claimant is entitled to seek and be given such information as to enable it to decide whether or not to dispute the shipowner’s right to limit its liability, each party should bear its own costs in this regard. (c) Where an application for discovery is made pursuant to O 70 r 37(6), the costs of such discovery application should follow the event. (d) The foregoing principles are subject always to costs being in the discretion of the court. 37 For the foregoing reasons, I ordered the Plaintiffs to pay the Defendants’ costs in relation to: (a)  the establishment of the Plaintiffs’prima facieright to limit liability pursuant to Arts 1, 2 and 3 of the 1976 Convention; (b) the calculation of the size of the limitation fund; and (c) the consideration of the adequacy and acceptability of the draft LOU. I also ordered each party to bear its own costs in relation to investigative work done to allow the Defendants to decide whether to invoke Art 4 of the 1976 Convention.",
        "Epilogue": "38 After I granted leave for the Plaintiffs to constitute the limitation fund by producing an LOU, the Plaintiffs deposited the executed LOU in court on 29 November 2019. On 4 December 2019, the Plaintiffs filed an application for leave to replace the LOU. 39 The need for such replacement arose from Art 8 of the 1976 Convention, which requires the limitation amount to be converted from Special Drawing Rights into the national currency of the State in which limitation is sought, based on the conversion rate prevailing on the date of constitution of the limitation fund. In the case of an LOU, this would refer to the conversion rate prevailing on the day that the LOU is produced in court. However, the conversion rate prevailing on any particular day is not published by the International Monetary Fund until after the close of business in Singapore for that day. This means that, at the time the LOU is produced, the shipowner would not know for certain the prevailing conversion rate for that day. The shipowner would only know what the applicable conversion rate isafterit had produced the LOU. 40  A practice has therefore arisen whereby the shipowner would first produce an LOU using an estimated conversion rate (usually, the conversion rate prevailing on the day before) (“the Initial LOU”). If it turns out that the actual conversion rate prevailing on the day of production of the Initial LOU differs from the estimated conversion rate used in the Initial LOU, the shipowner would replace the Initial LOU with another LOU using the correct conversion rate. I saw no objection to this practice, as any perceived irregularities about the Initial LOU having used the wrong conversion rate would be cured by the replacement LOU. I therefore granted the Plaintiffs’ application and ordered that the replacement LOU be treated as if it had been deposited in court on 29 November 2019. 41 By way of guidance for parties, I would suggest that future applications should include a prayer for leave to replace the Initial LOU in the manner described above. This would obviate the costs and trouble of taking out a separate application after depositing the Initial LOU in court. This was the approach adopted inPacific International Lines([6(a)]supra).
