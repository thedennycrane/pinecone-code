        "Background facts": "2       The Plaintiff procured the issuance of the Writ\n                    on 2 October 2014, claiming substantial loss and damage against the Defendant on\n                    account of the Defendant’s alleged fraudulent misrepresentations and/or\n                    deceit during the latter’s brief tenure as the Plaintiff’s Chief\n                    Investment Officer. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant had deliberately\n                    concealed investigations by the Department of Justice, United States of America,\n                    into the Defendant’s participation in London Interbank Offered\n                    Rate (“LIBOR”) manipulation. The Plaintiff further alleged,inter alia, that in employing the Defendant as\n                    the Plaintiff’s Chief Investment Officer, it had relied on the\n                    Defendant’s representation that he was not subject to any proceedings of a\n                    disciplinary or criminal nature. 3       Pursuant to anex\n                        parteOrder of Court dated 16 October 2014, the Plaintiff\n                    obtained leave to serve the Writ on the Defendant out of jurisdiction at the\n                    Defendant’s residence in Tokyo. The Writ was served on 23 October 2014 by\n                    registered mail. 4       On 26 November 2014, the Defendant filed the\n                    present summons challenging the jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore. On\n                    11 December 2014, the Plaintiff’s Japanese solicitor served the Writ and a\n                    Japanese translation thereof on the Defendant via registered mail. 5       At the hearing on 9 January 2015, counsel for\n                    the Defendant, Mr Walter Ferix (“Mr Ferix”) withdrew the prayer\n                    for an order to set aside the Writ, but maintained that service of the Writ\n                    ought to be set aside due to irregularity in service.",
        "Issues": "6       It was undisputed that there was no Civil\n                    Procedure Convention providing for service of court processes between Singapore\n                    and Japan. As such, the parties agreed that the Writ may be served on the\n                    Defendant in accordance with O 11 r 4(2)(c) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,\n                    R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”). 4. Service of originating process\n                            abroad through foreign governments, judicial authorities and Singapore\n                            consuls or by other method of service (O. 11, r.\n                        4) … (2) Where in accordance with these Rules an originating\n                        process is to be served on a defendant in any country with respect to which\n                        there does not subsist a Civil Procedure Convention providing for service in\n                        that country of process of the High Court, the originating process may be\n                        served — … (c) by a method of service authorised by the law of that country for\n                            service of any originating process issued by that country. … 7       The Plaintiff additionally relied on O 11 r 3(3)\n                    of the Rules of Court, which provides: 3. Service of originating process\n                            abroad: Alternative modes (O. 11, r. 3) … (3) An originating process which is to be served out of Singapore need not\n                        be served personally on the person required to be served so long as it is\n                        served on him in accordance with the law of the country in which service is\n                        effected. … 8       The parties also recognised that pursuant to O\n                    11 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court, the court may not make any order or direction\n                    which “shall authorise or require the doing of anything in a country in\n                    which service is to be effected which is contrary to the law of that\n                    country”. 9       Two issues arose for consideration in the\n                    present application: (a)     First, whether the Plaintiff’s\n                        service of the Writ was irregular; and (b)     Second, if so, whether this court should exercise its\n                        discretion to cure the irregularity.",
        "The first issue: Whether the Plaintiff’s service of the Writ\n                was irregular": "10     Mr Ferix argued that service of the Writ was\n                    irregular. He raised three arguments in this regard: (a)     First, he pointed out that service\n                        in Japan had to be effected by a competent district court of Japan, through\n                        a “special delivery”, with a Japanese translation of the Writ.\n                        According to the Defendant’s expert, Mr Genta Irie (“Mr\n                        Irie”): A foreign complaint shall be sent by a competent\n                                court, central authority or designated authority.Page\n                            233 of International Judicial Cooperation Manual regarding a Civil Case\n                            (Hosokai, Minjijiken ni kansuru Kokusaishihohujo Manual 233) (1999), the\n                            authoritative book in Japan under the supervision of the Supreme Court\n                            of the Administration Office of a Civil Case, has clearly stated the way\n                            of the service of process regarding an international civil case.Accordingly, a defendant shall receive a foreign\n                                complaint by a competent district court of Japan(Id, at 233)through a special delivery(Tokuybetsusotatsu).In addition, the\n                                complaint shall be sent with a translation of the\n                                complaint. [emphasis added in bold italics] The method of service of a Singapore writ in Japan was\n                            also very recently considered inSRS Commerce Ltd and\n                                another v Yuji Imabeppu and others[2015] 1 SLR 1\n                                (“SRS Commerce”) at [6],\n                            where Choo Han Teck J noted that: There is little doubt that the service was not properly effected.\n                            Under Japanese law, the writ (and accompanying documents)must be served through Japan’s Ministry of Foreign\n                                Affairs and then through court clerks authorised by the Japanese\n                                courts. The writ (and its accompanying documents) in the\n                            present case was not served by a court clerk authorised by the Japanese\n                            court. [emphasis added in bold italics] (b)     Second, Mr Ferix\n                        argued that delivery by mail is an “unlawful” method of\n                        service in Japan. In support of this argument, Mr Irie cited a Japanese\n                        textbook titledInternational Civil Procedure\n                            Law(2005) (“International Civil\n                            Procedure Law”), which stated (as translated into\n                        English) at p 119: If service of process is made to a country with which no treaty exists\n                            or bilateral judicial assistance agreement has been executed, the\n                            service lacks legal foundation under international laws. As such,personal delivery and personal delivery by mail\n                                as previously described are clearly unlawful methods of service\n                                under Japanese law. [emphasis added] Another passage found inInternational\n                                Civil Procedure Lawstated: 3. Services by Direct Delivery and Direct Mailing What becomes the most significant issue in services performed in Japan\n                            for foreign cases is the legality of services by direct delivery and\n                            direct mailing to the recipient of the service, which often occurs in\n                            the services from common law nations, where the method of service is\n                            different from that of Japan. As described above, for services for countries with which Japan has no\n                            treaty or arrangement for bilateral judicial assistance, since there are\n                            no grounds related to international law,such direct\n                                delivery and direct mailing are clearly an illegal service under\n                                Japanese law. … [emphasis added] (c)     Third, Mr Ferix\n                        contended that the Plaintiff’s reliance on the decision of the Supreme\n                        Court of Japan inKishinchando Naridas Sadhwani,\n                            Sadhwanis Japan v Sadhwani, Gobindram Sadhwani(Case No\n                        1838(O) of 1994 dated 28 April 1998) (“Sadhwani”) was misplaced, asSadhwaniwas a case relating to the enforcement of foreign\n                        judgments rather than to the service of originating processes. Mr Irie\n                        agreed that in the context of enforcement of a foreign judgment,\n                        irregularities in service could be cured if the defendant knew about the\n                        proceedings and had an unobstructed right to defend. However, he opined that\n                        there were “very different considerations when examining irregular\n                        service at the enforcement stage as opposed to commencement of\n                            action”.[note: 1]This was because, at the\n                        enforcement stage, refusing enforcement on the ground of an irregularity in\n                        service would involve substantial prejudice to the plaintiff since the\n                        plaintiff had already obtained a judgment and had (it is presumed) gone\n                        through the legal process. In contrast, at the commencement stage, the\n                        defendant has not yet substantively contested the proceedings.\n                        Irregularities at the commencement stage should therefore “be more\n                        closely scrutinised so as to allow the Defendant his full due\n                            process”.[note: 2] 11     Counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Arvind Daas\n                    Naaidu (“Mr Naaidu”) raised three arguments to support his\n                    contention that service of the Writ was regular. (a)     First, he argued that Mr\n                        Irie’s reliance on theInternational Judicial\n                            Cooperation Manual(see [10(a)] above) was misplaced, because\n                        according to the Plaintiff’s expert, Mr Iida Toyohiro (“Mr\n                        Toyohiro”), the manual applied only to instances of service of a\n                        foreign originating process in Japan “if and only\n                            ifthere subsists a Civil Procedure Convention and/or exists\n                        a concluded or executed bilateral judicial assistance agreement between that\n                        foreign country and Japan” [emphasis in original].[note: 3]However, it should be noted that Mr Irie conceded that the manual was not\n                        strictly applicable in situations where there is no Civil Procedure\n                        Convention between the foreign country and Japan, but emphasised that the\n                        point he was trying to make was that regular service in Japan can only be\n                        achieved by a central authority, a designated authority or by a court with\n                            jurisdiction.[note: 4] (b)     Second, Mr Toyohiro interpreted theSadhwanidecision to mean that in the absence of a Civil\n                        Procedure Convention subsisting between an originating country and Japan,\n                        the service of a foreign process from the originating country need not\n                        comply with the requirements of the Japanese Code of Civil Procedure\n                        (“CCP”) so long as the defendant knew about the commencement\n                        of the foreign proceedings and his right of defence was not\n                            obstructed.[note: 5]Mr Naaidu\n                        emphasised that similar observations had been made by Professor Nozomi Tada\n                        (in an article titled “Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign\n                        Judgments” (2003) 46 Japanese Annual of International Law 75\n                        (“Professor Tada’s article”)) and Mr Masahiro\n                        Nakatsukasa (for the “Japan” entry in Mark Moedritzer &\n                        Kay C Whittaker, gen ed,Enforcement of Foreign Judgments\n                            in 28 jurisdictions worldwide 2013at p 71).[note: 6]WhileSadhwaniwas a case decided in the context of the\n                        enforcement of foreign judgments, the issue of service was considered by the\n                        Supreme Court of Japan and the decision was therefore relevant to the\n                        present case. Mr Toyohiro disagreed with Mr Irie’s reliance onInternational Civil Procedure Lawon the\n                        basis that the commentary by the authors of that textbook was\n                        “plainly contrary to the decision of the Supreme Court of Japan [inSadhwani]”.[note: 7] (c)     Third, Mr Naaidu pointed out that in a 1989 meeting of\n                        the Hague Conference on Private International Law Special Commission\n                        (“the 1989 Hague Conference”), the Japanese Government stated\n                        that it did not consider the use of mail or postal channels to send judicial\n                        documents to be an infringement of its sovereign power.[note: 8] 12     In my view, the Plaintiff’s service of\n                    the Writ by registered mail was irregular. (a)     First, the authorities cited by Mr\n                        Naaidu and Mr Toyohiro (see [11(b)] above) related to the enforcement of\n                        foreign judgments, rather than the setting aside of service of process at\n                        the commencement of proceedings. They were therefore not directly relevant\n                        to the issue before this court. In this regard, it should be noted that inSRS Commerce, Choo J had expressly\n                        consideredSadhwaniand observed that the\n                        provision relied upon inSadhwani(ie, Article 118 of the CCP) applied only to\n                        “final and binding” judgments (see alsoSRS\n                            Commerceat [7]). Choo J emphasised thatSadhwanidid not stand for the proposition that\n                        “defendants who contest proceedings with actual knowledge of the\n                        commencement of actions cannot raise arguments on irregular service”\n                            (SRS Commerceat [8]). Before me, the\n                        parties agreed that the positions taken inSRS\n                            Commerceconcerning the validity of service by mail in Japan\n                        (in general) and the applicability ofSadhwani(in particular) were findings of fact and therefore not strictly binding on\n                        this court. However, that did not preclude me from adopting Choo J’s\n                        compelling reasoning, particularly sinceSRS\n                            Commerceconcerned the very same decision of the Supreme\n                        Court of Japan. Furthermore, Choo J’s findings did not seem\n                        contradicted by the evidence before me, and indeed, appeared to be supported\n                        by the expert opinion provided by Mr Irie. This was so, for instance, with\n                        regard to the point that there is a principled distinction between (a)\n                        resisting enforcement on the ground that the originating process had not\n                        been validly served; and (b) setting aside the service of a writ at the\n                        commencement of proceedings on the same ground (see [10(c)] above). I would\n                        also add, for completeness, that in Professor Tada’s article (which\n                        was cited by Mr Toyohiro in support of the Plaintiff’s position), the\n                        learned author in fact recognised that service by “mailing of\n                        judicial documents to a defendant by plaintiff’s lawyers is not valid\n                        under Japanese domestic law”, and cautioned that one “might\n                        encounter problems in Japan if service were accomplished by\n                        mail”. (b)     Second, while the Japanese Government had taken the position at the 1989\n                        Hague Conference that service by mail did not infringe its sovereign power,\n                        it is necessary to have regard to the fuller context in which the Japanese\n                        delegation indicated its position: Japan has not declared that it objects to the sending of judicial\n                            documents, by postal channels, directly to persons abroad. In this\n                            connection, Japan has made it clear that no objection to the use of\n                            postal channels for sending judicial documents to persons in Japandoes not necessarily imply that the sending by\n                                such a method is considered valid service in Japan; it\n                            merely indicates that Japan does not consider it as infringement of its\n                            sovereign power. [emphasis added] From the extract, the Japanese delegation appeared to\n                            emphasise that while Japan was not objecting to the use of postal\n                            channels, this did not imply that sending documents by mail was\n                            considered valid service in Japan. A plain textual interpretation of\n                            this statement appeared to lend support to the position that service by\n                            mail was not valid service in Japan. Indeed, it should be noted that in\n                            Professor Tada’s article, the learned author cited a decision of\n                            the Tokyo District Court (referred to by Professor Tada as “Tokyo\n                            District Court, Judgment, March 25, 1990,Kinyu Shoji\n                                HanreiNo. 857 p. 39”) which held that the\n                            Japanese Government’s position, as expressed at the 1989 Hague\n                            Conference, is “not to be understood as having positively\n                            introduced a new method of service which foreign States are to\n                            follow”. Mr Naaidu submitted, in response to a query by this\n                            court, that the Japanese Government was simply being “mindful not\n                            to declare such serviceipso factovalid\n                            in all circumstances”, and that the validity of service should be\n                            assessed “on the particular circumstances of each\n                                case”.[note: 9]However, apart from Mr Toyohiro’s personal interpretation ofSadhwaniand several articles on the\n                            enforcement of foreign judgments in Japan, no evidence was adduced to\n                            support Mr Naaidu’s submission. 13     I therefore found that the Plaintiff’s\n                    service of the Writ by registered mail was irregular, and now turn to consider\n                    if this court should exercise its discretion to cure the irregularity in\n                    service.",
        "The second issue: Whether this court should exercise its discretion\n                to cure the irregularity": "14     That there is discretion to cure the\n                    irregularity in service is undisputed by the parties. If authority is needed, it\n                    may be found inSRS Commerceat [9]–[15],\n                    citingITC Global Holdings Pte Ltd (In Liquidation) v ITC Ltd\n                        and others[2011] SGHC 150 (“ITC Global\n                        Holdings”) at [42]–[50] (in turn citing the English\n                    cases ofGolden Ocean Assurance Ltd and World Mariner\n                        Shipping S A v Christopher Julian Martin and others[1990] 2\n                    Lloyd’s Rep 215 (“The Goldean\n                    Mariner”) andPhillips and another v Symes\n                        and others (No 3)[2008] 1 WLR 180 (“Phillips”)). 15     While the court clearly has discretion to cure\n                    irregularities in service, the validation of a breach of a procedural rule must\n                    depend on all the circumstances of the case (ITC Global\n                        Holdingsat [42]). It is therefore useful to consider the\n                    pertinent facts of each of the abovementioned cases, in order to discern how the\n                    courts have exercised discretion to cure irregularities in service. (a)     InSRS\n                            Commerce, Choo J found that service by post was invalid under\n                        Japanese law. However, he noted that the defendants had actually taken steps\n                        to defend the proceedings (SRS Commerceat\n                        [11]). After entering appearance, the 1st defendant had filed an affidavit\n                        and, in compliance with a freezing order, had also filed a list of assets\n                            (ibid). There were also exchanges of\n                        correspondence between the parties’ solicitors (ibidat [12]–[14]). Choo J noted that the defendants\n                        had already been given substantive advice “not only in respect of the\n                        claim, but also on the freezing order” (ibidat [14]). In the circumstances, Choo J exercised his\n                        discretion to cure the irregularity because the defendants “knew that\n                        process had been instituted against them in Singapore”, and were\n                        “constantly advised by Singapore lawyers and cannot now say that the\n                        irregularity in service justified their application to set aside the\n                        process” (ibid). (b)     InITC Global\n                            Holdings, the plaintiff filed a request for service of the\n                        writ out of Singapore with the Supreme Court of Singapore, and specifically\n                        requested that the relevant documents be sent to the relevant authorities in\n                        India (ITC Global Holdingsat [23]).\n                        Thereafter, the plaintiff played no role in the service of the writ, and\n                        left matters entirely to the Registry of the Supreme Court of Singapore, the\n                        Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the relevant Indian authorities (ibid). The plaintiff was subsequently provided with\n                        a copy of an endorsement from the process server, stating that the writ had\n                        been served on the defendants (ibidat [24]).\n                        However, it transpired that the service was irregular because the plaintiff\n                        failed to show that the entity that it served the writ on was in fact an\n                        agent for the defendants (ibidat [35]). Lee\n                        Seiu Kin J exercised his discretion to cure the irregularity in service\n                        because (i) the defendants were apprised of the proceedings and had taken\n                        steps to contest them, thus suffering no prejudice; and (ii) the plaintiff\n                        had “done all that he could to effect service” (ibidat [49]). Indeed, the plaintiff had even\n                        received a copy of an endorsement from the process server indicating that\n                        the writ had been successfully served (ibid).\n                        Lee J further noted that the parties had been involved in the suit for\n                        “almost a decade” and that “in the light of the several\n                        assiduous attempts at service and the defendants’ knowledge of such\n                        attempts and of the proceedings, the procedural defects are illusory”\n                            (ibidat [50]). To fail to cure the\n                        irregularities “would cause undue prejudice to [the plaintiff] by\n                        denying its right to a hearing” (ibid).\n                        It should be noted that the factors considered by Lee J in deciding whether\n                        to exercise discretion to cure irregularities in service were also cited inAstro Nusantara International BV v PT Ayunda Prima\n                            Mitra[2013] 1 SLR 636 at [61]. (c)     InThe Goldean\n                            Mariner, there were two categories of defendants who had\n                        experienced procedural irregularities in service: (i) defendants who\n                        received wrongly addressed writs which were meant for other defendants in\n                        the suit, although the writs were accurate in every other respect; and (ii)\n                        defendants who were only served with a form of acknowledgement of service,\n                        with no writ actually served on them. The English Court of Appeal emphasised\n                        that the court’s exercise of discretion to cure irregularities in\n                        service “is likely to depend upon whether it appears that the\n                        opposite party has suffered prejudice as a direct consequence of the\n                        particular irregularity”. On the facts, the defendants frankly\n                        accepted that they could not point to any prejudice suffered. The court (by\n                        a majority) exercised its discretion to cure the irregularity in the first\n                        category. The majority judges noted that the defendants had each received a\n                        copy of the writ, were parties to the contract in question, and knew about\n                        the cause of action. They emphasised that “[the defendants] all took\n                        the same prompt action” by putting the matter in the hands of their\n                        London solicitors, and that “[none of the defendants] was in any way\n                        misled by the mistake; and, indeed, none of them has ever suggested that it\n                        was”. The majority judges also cured the irregularity in the second\n                        category because the there was no doubt in the minds of those defendants\n                        regarding the proceedings that were initiated against them. In contrast, the\n                        dissenting judge opined that the defect in service was “very\n                        serious”, that the “conduct of the plaintiffs excites little\n                        sympathy”, and that it was “important” to remain\n                        cognisant that the matter at hand involved service out of jurisdiction on\n                        defendants who “owe[d] [the English courts] no allegiance”.\n                        The dissenting judge also surmised that the judge below, who was “an\n                        experienced commercial judge”, would have agreed with his refusal to\n                        cure the irregularity. (d)     InPhillips, documents\n                        required to be served on the defendants were forwarded by an English court\n                        to the relevant legal authorities in Switzerland. However, the enclosed\n                        English language claim form was erroneously stamped “[n]ot for\n                        service out of the jurisdiction”. The error was noticed by the\n                        claimants’ solicitors and the official at the foreign process section\n                        of the English court (who proceeded to accept the document for service). The\n                        documents were then forwarded to the relevant legal authorities in\n                        Switzerland for service. It transpired that the Swiss court removed the\n                        English language claim form (but not the German translation of it) from the\n                        package before serving the documents on the 2nd defendant. It also\n                        transpired that no documents were served on the 3rd defendant due to an\n                        error on the part of the Swiss Post Office. The House of Lords found that\n                        the “essential faults” in service were those of the Swiss\n                        authorities rather than the plaintiffs, and that to deny the effectiveness\n                        of service would lead to part of the claims being compromised because\n                        neither the English nor the Swiss courts would have had jurisdiction over\n                        the entire set of claims (seePhillipsat\n                        [38]). The House of Lords considered the power to dispense with service\n                        under r 6.9 of the English Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”).\n                        However, Lord Brown observed in his leading judgment (with which the other\n                        members of the court agreed) that even without resort to the dispensation\n                        with service, it was “at least arguable” that the court could\n                        simply order under r 3.10(b) of the CPR (ie,\n                        the English equivalent of O 2 r 1(2) of the Rules of Court) that the\n                        defendants “be regarded as properly served” (Phillipsat [31]). 16     From the above analysis, it appeared that\n                    there were at least three factors to be considered in deciding whether or not to\n                    cure an irregularity in service out of jurisdiction. (a)     The first factor concerned whether\n                        thedefendantwas apprised of the proceedings.\n                        This is a “highly significant” factor; if the defendant was in\n                        fact apprised of and took steps to contest the proceedings, he would\n                        probably have suffered no prejudice (ITC Global\n                            Holdingsat [49]). While the Defendant in the present case\n                        did come to know of the Writ, he did not actually take any active steps to\n                        contest the proceedings at all. This was unlike the defendants inSRS Commerce, who entered into correspondence with\n                        the plaintiffs and were found to have taken active steps in the proceedings\n                        (including filing affidavits concerning their assets). While the Defendant\n                        did enter an appearance, this was mandated by the rule concerning a dispute\n                        as to jurisdiction (see O 12 r 7(1) of the Rules of Court). The\n                        Defendant’s immediate step after entering appearance was, as is also\n                        prescribed in the said rule, to file the present application to set aside\n                        service of the Writ on grounds of irregularity. The present situation\n                        therefore appeared to be different from that inSRS\n                            Commerce. (b)     The second factor concerned whether theplaintiffhad properly done all that he could to\n                        effect service (ITC Global Holdingsat [49];\n                        and seePhillipsat [38]). If a plaintiff had\n                        done all that he could, the court may be more amenable to exercising its\n                        discretion to cure irregularities in service (see [15(b)] and [15(d)]\n                        above). In the present case, the Plaintiff had, on its own volition, simply\n                        sent the Writ to the Defendant by registered mail. This should be contrasted\n                        with the effort expended by the plaintiffs in bothITC\n                            Global HoldingsandPhillips.On balance, in the present case, I did not think it could be said that the\n                        Plaintiff had done all that it could to serve the Writ. (c)     The third factor concerned whether theplaintiffwould be unduly prejudiced\n                        should the court refuse to cure the irregularities in service. A plaintiff\n                        would likely be unduly prejudiced where, for instance, a defendant attempts\n                        to set aside service on the ground of irregularity after proceedings have\n                        already run their course (such as inSadhwani;\n                        and see [10(c)] and [12(a)] above). There might also be undue prejudice to\n                        the plaintiff if the failure to cure irregularities in service would result\n                        in claims (or part thereof) being forsaken (seeITC\n                            Global Holdingsat [48]; and see [15(d)] above), if\n                        substantive proceedings have been unnecessarily delayed due to a\n                        “myriad [of] procedural obstacles” (ITC\n                            Global Holdingsat [50]), or if it would effectively amount\n                        to “denying [a plaintiff’s] right to a hearing”\n                            (ibid). In the present case, the Plaintiff\n                        was unable to show how it would be unduly prejudiced in the event that\n                        service of the Writ is set aside. 17     Having considered these factors, I declined to\n                    exercise the discretion to cure the irregularity in service of the Writ. While\n                    the fact that the Defendant was aware of the Writ is certainly an important\n                    factor, it should be noted that this was not theonlyfactor considered in bothITC Global\n                        HoldingsandPhillips. Should the\n                    irregularity in the present case be cured, it might suggest that a plaintiff is\n                    entitled to serve a Singapore originating process on a defendant in Japan in\n                    whatever manner the plaintiff so desires, and that so long as the defendant\n                    becomes aware of the originating process, there will not be a need to comply\n                    with any rules on service. Indeed, this was precisely what the Plaintiff did in\n                    this case. If the Plaintiff’s actions were countenanced and the\n                    irregularity in service cured, it may well suggest that rules on service of\n                    process out of Singapore (such as O 11 rr 3(3) and 4(2)(c) of the Rules of\n                    Court) may be flouted with impunity and the door will be open to methods of\n                    service of originating processes that have not hitherto been\n                    contemplated.",
        "Conclusion": "18     For the reasons above, I granted the\n                    Defendant’s application for setting aside the service of the\n                Writ. 19     On the issue of costs, I noted that additional\n                    rounds of affidavits and hearings were necessitated because the Defendant had\n                    failed to exhibit some of the evidence of foreign law that he had sought to rely\n                    on. I had earlier asked parties to make submissions on costs prior to the\n                    outcome of the present decision. Having considered those submissions as well as\n                    the circumstances of the case, I fixed costs to the Defendant of $3,000, all\n                    inclusive.
