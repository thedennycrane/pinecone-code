        "The issue": "6\n\n        The issue in this case is whether the letter of\n\n18 March 2002 was made in the course of judicial proceedings and for the purpose of\n\njudicial proceedings. If the answer is in the affirmative in both respects in relation to\n\njudicial proceedings, it enjoys absolute privilege and the present defamation action based\n\non the letter must be struck out.",
        "The decision of the District\n\nJudge": "7\n\n        The District Judge rightly set out the\n\napplicable law. He held that the letter could only enjoy privilege if it was made in the\n\ncourse of, and for the purpose of either of both sets of proceedings in the District\n\nCourt, that is the earlier action in DC 1511 of 2002 or proceedings (contemplated or\n\notherwise) in respect of the complained act of intimidation and tampering of witnesses. In\n\nrelation to the question which was the relevant proceedings, the District Judge decided\n\nthat it was the intended proceedings against Madam Niranjan for the complained acts of\n\nharassment and intimidation of witnesses, and not the earlier action in DC Suit 1511 of\n\n2002. Since there was no proceedings (whether civil or criminal) taken out at the date of\n\nthe hearing before the District Judge, nor was there any evidence before him that any such\n\nproceedings were contemplated, the letter in his view could not be said to be made in the\n\ncourse of proceedings: see paras 27 and 43 of his grounds of decision.8\n\n        The District Judge further noted that the\n\nletter could be said to have been made in the course of the earlier proceedings in DC Suit\n\n1511 of 2002, seeing that it was written after the commencement of the action. However, he\n\nwas of the view that the letter, strictly speaking, was not made for the purpose of the\n\nearlier proceedings, because \"the accusation that Madam Niranjan was harassing and\n\nintimidating Madam Toh’s witnesses and tampering with their evidence was strictly\n\nspeaking, irrelevant to the issues in the earlier action for defamation\": see para 48",
        "My reasons": "9\n\n        My analysis of the letter in question differed\n\nfrom that of the District Judge. In answering the question whether it was written\n\n\"for the purpose of the proceedings\" it had to be asked, it seemed to me,\n\nwhether the letter was written by solicitors in an attempt to protect the client’s\n\ninterest in the proceedings and further whether it had the immediate link with the\n\nproceedings. InWaple v Surrey Country Council[1998] 1 All ER 624, Brooke LJ set\n\nout some instructive guidance on the modern rules about absolute privilege conferred on\n\nstatements made in the course of judicial proceedings. First, he noted that for over 100\n\nyears the courts had been very slow to extend the scope of the privilege. The width of the\n\nabsolute privilege depended on ‘the requirement of public policy to ensure freedom of\n\nspeech in a context in which it was essential that such freedom of speech should\n\nexist’ which was accompanied by ‘the knowledge that Courts of justice are\n\npresided over by those who from their high character are not likely to abuse the\n\nprivilege, and who have the power and ought to have the will to check any abuse of it by\n\nthose who appear before them’, per Lopes LJ inRoyal Aquarium and Summer and\n\nWinder Garden Society Ltd v Parkinson[1892]1 QB 431, at 451.10\n\n        It was further noted by Brookes LJ thatIn\n\nWatson v M’Ewan, Watson v Jones[1905] AC 480 the House of Lords extended the\n\nscope of the privilege to statements made by a witness to the client and solicitor in\n\npreparing a case for trial. The Earl of Halsbury LC pointed out that if this was not the\n\ncase, witnesses would be very reluctant to give any such information for fear of a libel\n\nsuit, and that it was very obvious that the public policy which rendered the protection of\n\nwitnesses necessary for the administration of justice must as a necessary consequence\n\ninvolve that which is a step towards and is part of the administration of justice. The\n\nLord Chancellor referred to the hardship which would arise if it were impossible to\n\nadminister justice because people would be afraid to give their testimony. The harassment\n\nof witnesses has the potential of causing deleterious effect on the administration of\n\njustice, which depends on witnesses telling the truth without fear.11\n\n        I considered the letter in the context of the\n\nearlier defamation suit in the Subordinate Courts. Madam Toh, to the knowledge of Madam\n\nNiranjan, would clearly and demonstrably depend on the witnesses, both Audrey Tan and Mr\n\nJoseph Ignatius, to prove the defamatory slander uttered by Madam Niranjan. They should\n\nnot be spoken to in any manner which could interfere with their willingness to tell the\n\ntruth in the course of the trial of those proceedings. The letter required Madam Niranjan\n\nto refrain from any further harassment and tampering of witness or an application would be\n\nmade. That application must refer to a complaint to the Subordinate Court in the earlier\n\nproceedings with a view to citing Madam Niranjan for contempt of court. Such harassment\n\nmaybe checked by the Subordinate Court under the earlier defamation suit taken out by\n\nMadam Toh. In those circumstances, I concluded that the letter was written in the course,\n\nand for the purposes, of those proceedings. Accordingly, the letter was written on an\n\noccasion of absolute privilege.Sgd:Lai Kew ChaiJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
