        "The plaintiffs’ claims": "15. The plaintiffs asserted that they had\n\npaid the consignee the sums in items (ii), (iii) and (iv) in paragraph 9 and that they\n\nwere in the process of making payment of the sum under item (i). They also added a further\n\nitem for $3,258.78 which they claimed they had incurred on their own as administrative,\n\ntravelling and accommodation expenses arising out of the delayed release of the cranes.16. They claimed against the defendants\n\n(i) a declaration that they were entitled to be indemnified by the defendants against\n\ntheir liability to the consignee, (ii) an indemnity in the sum of $301,476.43 (the full\n\namount claimed by the consignee), (iii) damages in the sum of $3,258.78, or alternatively\n\ndamages to be assessed, (iv) interest and (v) costs.The Assistant Registrar’s decision17. The plaintiffs applied for summary\n\njudgment on their action. This came on for hearing before an Assistant Registrar. After\n\nhearing counsel the Assistant Registrar gave judgment to the plaintiffs in terms of\n\nprayers (i) to (v) of the plaintiffs’ claims without specifying whether the damages\n\nwere fixed at $3,258.78 or were to be assessed.18. The defendants appealed against the\n\nwhole of the Assistant Registrar’s judgment.",
        "The issues raised before me": "19. In the appeal counsel for the\n\ndefendants submitted thatDefendants’ case is that (i)Plaintiffs\n\n  misrepresented the volume of cargoto the Defendants prior to the execution of the\n\n  contract, and that relying on the volume as represented by Plaintiffs, Defendants informed\n\n  the carrier/shipowner of that volume. Upon discharge, (ii)the carrierdiscovered\n\n  that the true volume was much greater than that told to them andexercised a lien on\n\n  the cargo. (iii)The Plaintiffs were alsolate in their payment of freight.\n\n  (Emphasis and numbering added)Examination of the issues raised20. There were three issues raised –\n\nmisrepresentation, lien and late payment of freight.21. On the issue of misrepresentation, the\n\ndefendants claim to have discovered the misrepresentation before the cranes were loaded.\n\nThey did not rescind the contract, and continued with it. In these circumstances, even if\n\nthere was a misrepresentation, the contract continued to subsist and the defendants were\n\nbound by their covenant to discharge the cranes to the consignee.22. On the lien issue, the shipowner had\n\nexercised its lien because no freight payments were made to them. The defendants had\n\nmisstated that the lien was exercised for non-payment of the excess freight payable on the\n\nexcess volume. The defendants’ reliance on the lien was unfounded because it was\n\ntheir duty to pay freight to he shipowner. While the lien resulted in their inability to\n\nrelease the cranes to the consignee, it did not displace their obligation to release the\n\ncranes or excuse the non-compliance.23. On the late payment of freight, while\n\nit was not disputed that the plaintiffs were late when they tendered the freight payment\n\nto the defendants, the defendants loaded and shipped the cranes and accepted the late\n\npayment. In these circumstances, the late payment did not justify their failure to release\n\nthe cranes.My decision24. The defences raised did not excuse the\n\ndefendants from their obligation to deliver the cargo to the consignee, and the plaintiffs\n\nare entitled to redress.25. The plaintiffs are entitled to the\n\nindemnity they sought. What they can recover under the indemnity, however, must be proved.\n\nSimilarly, while the plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages for losses incurred by\n\nthem, the losses must be proved. I therefore varied the Assistant Registrar’s orders\n\nso that the amount recoverable under the indemnity and the damages recoverable are to be\n\nassessed, and I also made it clear that the orders shall not prevent the defendants from\n\ntaking out a separate action against the plaintiffs on the alleged misrepresentation on\n\nthe measurement of the cargo, or for additional freight.Kan Ting ChiuJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
