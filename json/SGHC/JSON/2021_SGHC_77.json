        "Introduction": "1 In November 2014,1Foot Note 1×Plaintiff’s AEIC (4 October 2016) at para 5.the plaintiff suffered a number of serious injuries in a road accident.2Foot Note 2×Statement of Claim (3 September 2015) at para 4.I found the defendant to be 100% liable for the plaintiff’s injuries and ordered that the plaintiff’s damages be assessed (seePollmann, Christian Joachim v Ye Xianrong[2017] SGHC 229 at [99]). This judgment assesses those damages.",
        "Background facts": "2 The plaintiff is a Swiss national. At the date of the accident, he was employed in Singapore at Bank Julius Baer (“BJB”). His internal rank was that of an executive director (“ED”) and his title was Head of Market Business Development in Asia.3Foot Note 3×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 2. 3 The plaintiff was aged 38 and married at the date of the accident. His wife was aged 37 at the date of the accident. The plaintiff and his wife have two children, who were aged one and three at the date of the accident. 4 The plaintiff is neither a citizen of Singapore nor a permanent resident of Singapore. He was employed at BJB4Foot Note 4×Plaintiff’s AEIC at para 40.on an employment pass. Despite this, both parties are content to have his damages assessed as though all of his future loss will be incurred in Singapore. 5 It was appreciated from the outset by the defendant, or those who stand behind him, that the plaintiff’s claim for damages was likely to be substantial.  The defendant has therefore made interim payments to the plaintiff amounting to $3,100,000 over the course of these proceedings.5Foot Note 5×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 7.These interim payments will naturally have to be brought into account against the sums awarded in this assessment. 6 As for the assessment itself, counsel have sensibly and pragmatically agreed a large number of one-off items of loss and damage. The agreed items are set out in Annex A.6Foot Note 6×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at Annex A; Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 558.Despite counsel’s best efforts, however, a number of heads of loss remain in contention. The contested heads of loss are listed at Annex B.7Foot Note 7×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at Annex B; Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 558.The two largest and most contentious heads of loss are losses which extend into the future: loss of future earnings and future medical expenses. The difference between the parties on these two heads of loss involve questions of fundamental principle as well as fact. The remaining heads of loss in contention are one-off losses. The difference between the parties on these heads of loss are simply questions of present or projected fact. 7 Before addressing the disputed heads of loss in turn, it is convenient to address the questions of fundamental principle which divides the parties on the assessment of plaintiff’s future losses.",
        "The multiplier-multiplicand approach": "",
        "The traditional approach": "8 An award of damages for future losses arising from non-fatal personal injuries is intended to place a lump sum of money in the plaintiff’s hands which he can draw down upon at periodic intervals over the expected duration of his loss, taking into account the vicissitudes of life, such that the lump sum is reduced to zero at the end of that duration, after taking into account the time value of money (seeQuek Yen Fei Kenneth (by his litigation representative Pang Choy Chun) v Yeo Chye Huat and another appeal[2017] 2 SLR 229 (“Kenneth Quek” at [43]–[44] and [58]). 9 The damages for a particular head of future loss have traditionally been calculated using the formula(Kenneth Quek(at [42]): … The multiplicand represents the quantum of loss, whether in terms of an incurrence of medical expenses (for [future medical expenses]) or a reduction of earnings (for [loss of future earnings]), that the claimant is expected to suffer at periodic intervals in the future. The multiplier, in turn, is the mathematical tool used to calculate the lump-sum present value of the stream of future periodic losses across the remaining life expectancy and the remaining working life … of the claimant. 10 Determining the multiplicand, while fraught with difficulty, is ultimately no more or less difficult than the court’s usual task in making findings of contested present or projected fact. Determining the multiplier, on the other hand, poses all of those difficulties plus additional difficulties of concept and of principle. Those additional difficulties lead to differences of approach which have the potential to have a significant effect on the quantum of damages awarded.",
        "Determining the multiplier": "11 The multiplier represents the number of periods which comprise the total duration of a particular head of loss. For loss of future earnings, the duration of a plaintiff’s loss will be the remainder of his working life. For future medical treatment, the duration of a plaintiff’s loss will be the period for which he is likely to require that treatment. In the case of lifelong medical treatment, the duration of the plaintiff’s loss will be the rest of his natural life. 12 To avoid the risk of overcompensating a plaintiff, the multiplier must be adjusted to account for two features. 13 One adjustment to the multiplier is to account for the time value of money, or for accelerated receipt as it is traditionally known. A lump sum of money in a plaintiff’s hands today has traditionally thought to be worth more to a plaintiff than a stream of periodic payments equivalent in quantum to the multiplicand over the duration of the plaintiff’s loss. This is because a plaintiff can invest the lump sum in order to earn a real, positive rate of return,ie, a rate of return which is above the inflation rate. That return must be treated as part of the plaintiff’s compensation and must therefore be brought into account. That is done by adjusting the multiplier to account for the anticipated rate of achievable return. That anticipated rate of achievable return is the discount rate. The conventional range for discount rates in damages awards in Singapore is 4% to 5% (seeKenneth Quekat [65]). 14 The other adjustment to the multiplier is to account for what is called the vicissitudes of life. The vicissitudes of life are factors which could shorten the duration of the plaintiff’s loss and therefore reduce the plaintiff’s loss as compared to the loss anticipated at the time of assessment. The primary factor which could have this result, of course, is the possibility that the plaintiff may die of causes unrelated to the tort before the expiry of the duration of his loss anticipated at the date of assessment. 15 The Court of Appeal inKenneth Queknoted that there are four approaches to determining the multiplier (at [50]). Each approach deals with the two adjustments to the multiplier in different ways. The precedent approach determines the multiplier by analogy with past precedents. The arithmetic approach determines the multiplier by the arithmetic formula for determining the net present value of a stream of payments into the future. The actuarial approach determines the multiplier by reference to actuarial tables. The fixed-formula approach determines the multiplier by a formula fixed by legislation. 16 In the absence of authoritative actuarial tables for Singapore lives, and in the absence of any formula fixed by legislation, the precedent approach and the arithmetic approach are to be preferred in Singapore. These two approaches are to be used independently, with the precedent approach used to cross-check the result obtained by the arithmetic approach so as to ensure consistency with past awards in like cases (Kenneth Quekat [54]). 17 The precedent approach embeds the adjustment for both accelerated receipt and the vicissitudes of life in the multipliers which the courts have selected in past cases, albeit in a manner which has been until recently, unreasoned, unarticulated, and ultimately unprincipled. The arithmetic approach uses a formula which is a function of the discount rate for any given loss and duration to calculate a multiplier. The multiplier calculated by this formula adjusts only for the time value of money at the selected discount rate. A multiplier derived by the arithmetic approach must therefore be adjusted further to account for the vicissitudes of life (seeKenneth Quekat [58]). 18 Authoritative actuarial tables set out multipliers which incorporate an evidence-based adjustment for life expectancy at a range of discount rates. One of the advantages of the actuarial approach is therefore that it allows a multiplier which is adjusted both for the time value of money and for the vicissitudes of life to be selected from a single source.",
        "Loss of future earnings": "",
        "The plaintiff cannot return to gainful employment": "19 The plaintiff advances his case for loss of future earnings on the basis that he will not be able to return to gainful employment for the remainder of his working life. The defendant does not suggest otherwise. This is no doubt because the uncontested8Foot Note 8×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 3; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 304.medical evidence shows that the plaintiff has negligible prospects of returning to gainful employment. 20 One of the plaintiff’s neurosurgeons, Dr Ivan Ng, gave evidence that the plaintiff’s disabilities made it “impossible for [him] to work in his current position [ie, as a director at BJB] orother form of gainful employment… the level of disability is total (100%)”9Foot Note 9×Affidavit of Dr Ng Hua Bak Ivan (19 November 2019) at p 59.[emphasis added]. The plaintiff’s other neurosurgeon, Dr Alvin Hong, gave evidence to similar effect: the plaintiff “cannot handle more than 1 task or person at a time [and thus] his job prospects are limited … [e]ven doing manual work is difficult because he cannot remember the full set of instructions”.10Foot Note 10×Affidavit of Dr Alvin Hong (10 January 2020) at p 10. 21 Further, one of the plaintiff’s psychologists, Dr Tommy Tan, gave evidence that the plaintiff’s injuries caused the plaintiff to suffer from major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder,11Foot Note 11×Affidavit of Dr Tan Kay Seng Tommy (10 January 2020) at p 13, para 17.which affect both his specific ability to work as a banker12Foot Note 12×Affidavit of Dr Tan Kay Seng Tommy (10 January 2020) at p 14, para 21.and his general ability to find gainful employment.13Foot Note 13×Affidavit of Dr Tan Kay Seng Tommy (10 January 2020) at p 14, paras 22–23.The plaintiff’s  psychiatrist, Dr Calvin Fones, gave evidence that “it is impossible that [the plaintiff] achieves the level of vocational attainments that he would have … It is highly unlikely that he will ever be able to secure employment in the open, normal setting”.14Foot Note 14×Affidavit of Dr Fones Calvin Soon Leng (19 November 2019) at pp 29–30, para 56.",
        "The multiplier": "The applicable principles 134 The applicable principles for determining the multiplier have been canvassed at [30] above. Those principles apply equally to assessing the award for the plaintiff’s future medical expenses. Once again, I will rely on three approaches: the actuarial approach, the arithmetic approach and the precedent approach. In the case of future medical expenses, however, the Singapore Tables must be approached with particular caution. This is because, as I have mentioned, the Singapore Tables are based on life expectancy data between 1992 and 2012.133Foot Note 133×PB2 at p 146.Life expectancy as at 2020 is likely to be different and higher. And the period of loss for some of the plaintiff’s future medical expenses is the rest of his natural life, not simply the rest of his working life. The number of periods of future losses 135 Determining the number of periods of the plaintiff’s loss is relevant only to the arithmetical approach. The number of periods depends on the plaintiff’s life expectancy at the date of the assessment. As at 2018, the life expectancy at birth for a Singaporean male is 81.0 years. The life expectancy at 65 years of age for a Singaporean male is 19.3 years, giving a total lifespan of 84.3 years.134Foot Note 134×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 144.The life expectancy for a 40 year old Swiss male is 42.7 years, giving a total lifespan of 82.7 years.135Foot Note 135×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 144.The plaintiff himself suggests a life expectancy figure of 81.136Foot Note 136×Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions at paras 13 and 77.I adopt the figure of 81 years for the arithmetic approach. This figure is generally consistent with the Singapore data and also closest to the life expectancy of a Swiss male at 40 years of age, which is the profile most closely comparable to the plaintiff. The number of periods of the plaintiff’s loss in respect of future medical expenses is thus 81 minus 44 years (the age of the plaintiff at the assessment date),ie, 37 years. The discount rate 136 The plaintiff makes the same argument on the discount rate here as he does for loss of future earnings. He submits that the circumstances of this case warrant selecting a discount rate considerably below the conventional range,ie,4% to 5%. He again submits that the starting point for the discount rate should be either 1% or 2.5% (see [24] above). 137 However, for this head of loss, the plaintiff goes even further. His case is that projected healthcare inflation ought to be deducted from this starting point. He submits that healthcare costs will increase at a rate of 2% per annum, yielding a final discount rate of either -1% or 0.5%.137Foot Note 137×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 196.To support this submission, the plaintiff relies once again on the Public Documents. In particular, the plaintiff relies on: (a) an article in the Singapore Business Review with the headline “Medical inflation to rise 9.3% in 2020”;138Foot Note 138×PB2 at pp 6–7.and (b) data from the Yearbook of Statistics Singapore 2019 on the price indices of medical treatment between 2012 and 2018.139Foot Note 139×PB2 at p 11. 138 I have explained at [68] above why I do not accept the plaintiff’s starting point of a discount rate of 1% or 2.5% for loss of future earnings. The same reasoning applies to the plaintiff’s future medical expenses. I did not find it necessary to analyse the proper treatment of inflation in assessing the plaintiff’s loss of future earnings. Now that the plaintiff has advanced a specific case on inflation in assessing future medical expenses, I must now analyse explicitly this aspect of the plaintiff’s case. 139  The plaintiff’s argument on inflation has the same evidential difficulty as I have explained above at [44]. He relies on the Public Documents for economic data on the inflation rate. But the Public Documents were not admitted in the evidential phase of the assessment. He thus invites me to take judicial notice of the Public Documents. 140 The plaintiff invites me to take judicial notice of four facts asserted in the Public Documents as part of his case on healthcare inflation:140Foot Note 140×PB2 at Index, S/Ns 1–4. (a) The annual healthcare inflation rate of 10% for employers, as reported by the Singapore Business Review; (b) The healthcare inflation rate of 1.6% per annum in 2019, as recorded in the Singapore Yearbook of Statistics 2019; (c) The healthcare inflation rate of about 10% per annum in 2018, as reported by the Business Times; and (d) The healthcare inflation rate of about 10% per annum in 2018, as reported by the Straits Times. 141 I have analysed the principles on taking judicial notice at [46]–[49] above. The facts mentioned in the preceding paragraph are not in Category 1. They are highly specific economic information. Thus, the key question is whether these facts are in Category 2,ie, whether they can be easily or accurately established by “unimpeachable” or “authoritative” sources. 142 My findings on whether I can take judicial notice of these facts is as follows: (a) The healthcare inflation rate of 10% for employers (at [140(a)]) cannot be the subject of judicial notice. The source for this fact, as indicated in the Singapore Business Review article, is a “survey of medical insurers by Willis Towers Watson”.141Foot Note 141×PB2 at p 6.I do not accept Willis Towers Watson as an authoritative source. (b) The 2019 healthcare inflation rate of 1.6% per annum (at [140(b)]) can be the subject of judicial notice. The source for this fact is the Department of Statistics of the Ministry of Trade and Industry (“MTI”). I accept that MTI is an authoritative source on matters within its purview. (c) The 2018 healthcare inflation rate of 10% per annum (at [140(c)] and [140(d)]) cannot be the subject of judicial notice. The source for this fact in both articles is a report from Mercer Marsh Benefits, an American human resource consultant. I do not accept Mercer Marsh Benefits as an authoritative source. 143 Nevertheless, even taking the plaintiff’s case at its highest, and even assuming that I take judicial notice of all four of the facts at [140], there is still no basis to conclude that the plaintiff’s future medical expenses will increase at a rate of 2% per annum. There are two fatal flaws in the plaintiff’s case. First, the inflation data pertains to healthcare inflationin general. Data at such a high level of generality is of limited use. The plaintiff’s loss is the cost of a limited basket of specific medical treatments. There is nothing to suggest that the general inflation data applies to these specific medical treatments. Second, the plaintiff’s treatments are expected to continue decades into the future. There is nothing in the data itself to suggest that the high inflation rate cited by the plaintiff will continue decades into the future. Nor has the plaintiff adduced any expert economic evidence to that effect. I also note that the inflation data, even on the plaintiff’s own evidence, appears to be fluctuating widely, by close to an order of magnitude (ie, from 10% in 2018 to 1.6% in 2019). 144 In summary, the plaintiff has not adduced sufficient evidence, either factual or expert, to satisfy me that the plaintiff’s future medical expenses will increase at an overall rate of 2% per annum for the duration of his loss. Nor has the plaintiff satisfied me that the starting point for selecting the discount rate should be outside the conventional range, either at 1% or 2.5%. 145 In the circumstances, there is no basis to depart from the conventional range. For the same reasons as I gave in respect of the plaintiff’s loss of future earnings, I fix the discount rate for the plaintiff’s future medical expenses also at4.25%(see [75] above). 146 I now calculate the multiplier using the arithmetic approach. Using the formula at [9] above, I arrive at a figure of 18.48, or 18 rounded off to the nearest integer. Cross-checking the arithmetic approach 147 I now cross-check the multiplier of 18.5 with the actuarial approach and the precedent approach. Using Table 1 of the Singapore Tables,142Foot Note 142×PB2 at p 96.a discount rate of 4.25% gives me a multiplier of between18.42and19.83. 148 Turning to the precedents, the parties have drawn my attention to the following cases: CaseSexRemaining yearsMultiplierNg Song Leng v Soh Kim Seng Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd[1997] SGHC 289Male3517HafizulMale3418Siew Pick Chiang v Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co Ltd and another[2016] SGHC 266Male3819 The multiplier of 18 which I have derived is consistent with both the actuarial approach and the precedents. 149 Accordingly, the multiplier which I shall use to calculate the plaintiff’s future medical expenses is18.",
        "The multiplicand": "The applicable principles 150 The defendant accepts that the general principle that the purpose of an award of damages in tort is to restore a plaintiff to the position that he would have been in if the defendant had not committed the tort.143Foot Note 143×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 274.However, the defendant submits that this principle is subject to a test ofreasonableness. According to the defendant, the plaintiff must show not only that undergoing a particular course of medical treatment will restore him to the condition he would have been in if the defendant’s tort had not caused his injuries, the plaintiff must also show that undergoing that treatment isreasonable.144Foot Note 144×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 275. 151 I accept that a plaintiff is entitled to recover damages from the defendant only for the cost of future medical expenses which the plaintiff will reasonably incur by reason of the defendant’s tort (see Harvey McGregor QC,McGregor on Damages(Sweet & Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2014) (“McGregor”) at para 38-181). But this is not a qualification of the general principle ofrestitutio in integrum. Instead, the requirement of reasonableness arises because medical expenses, properly analysed, are steps which the plaintiff takes to alleviate the loss and damage which a plaintiff suffers by reason of the tort. The requirement of reasonableness is simply an aspect of the plaintiff’s so-called “duty” to mitigate his loss: a plaintiff will not be able to recover any loss which he has incurred by acting unreasonably after suffering the tort (McGregorat para 4-059). 152 That is not the end of the defendant’s submission. He goes further than merely advancing a requirement of reasonableness. It is his case also that the plaintiff can recover damages for the cost of a particular medical treatment only to the extent that the plaintiff can satisfy me that the treatment is medically necessary and effective.145Foot Note 145×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 276.In other words, even though a medical treatment may restore the plaintiff to his pre-injury condition and is reasonable, the plaintiff cannot recover the cost of that treatment unless it is also medically necessary and effective.146Foot Note 146×Certified Transcript (17 January 2020) at p 23, ln 27 to p 24, ln 3. 153 I do not accept this submission. Of course, it is true that a medical treatment must have some rational connection with alleviating the plaintiff’s injuries. But the authorities cited by the defendant for this submission do not stipulate a test of both necessity and effectiveness. And such a test also contradicts the principle ofrestitutio in integrum. However, I accept that necessity and effectiveness (or the lack thereof) are relevant factors in considering whether a medical treatment is reasonable, which in turn impinges upon mitigation. Botox 154 The defendant accepts that the plaintiff will have to undergo life-long botox treatment for synkinesis.147Foot Note 147×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 297.Synkinesis is a neurological condition in which the voluntary movement of one muscle causes another unrelated muscle to move at the same time. In the plaintiff’s case, his right eye closes involuntarily when he smiles or bites.148Foot Note 148×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 291.The parties however disagree on the likely annual cost of this treatment. 155 The plaintiff relies on the evidence of his expert, Dr Wong Chin Ho (“Dr Wong”), that the plaintiff will require two botox treatments per year at $3,000 per treatment, costing a total of $6,000 per annum.149Foot Note 149×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 23(b).In response, the defendant makes two points. First, the cost of the plaintiff’s botox treatment may decrease in the future. Second, that if the plaintiff undergoes a particular surgical procedure – a “functional muscle transfer” (see [196] below) – the frequency of his future botox treatment may also decline. For these two reasons, the defendant argues for a 25% downward adjustment of the sum awarded for the plaintiff’s botox treatment costs to $4,500 per annum.150Foot Note 150×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 328. 156 The defendant’s first argument is premised on his interpretation of Dr Wong’s evidence in cross-examination. It is therefore necessary to look more closely at what Dr Wong actually said:151Foot Note 151×Certified Transcript (17 January 2020) at p 24, ln 22 to p 26, ln 12. [Defendant’s counsel]: So it’s possible that in future if [the plaintiff]’s condition improves, he will require less than $3,000 treatment? [Dr Wong]: It has been 3 years since the injury. Now, most of the recovery from facial nerve injury occurs within the first 6 to 12 months. Beyond that if there is no surgical intervention like functional muscle transfer, it is unlikely that he will have further recovery of the muscle function. So in the context of---of this, it’s unlikely that, you know, his---his facial expression will spontaneously improve. Over time, I---I see the dosage of botox he will need will likely to increase instead of decrease because of, you know, of this more abnormal movement developing. [Defendant’s counsel]: Right. But it’s possible, right, that it could be less than $3,000? [Dr Wong]: Yes, is possible that it will be less than 3,000, back down to the 1,500, depending on the dosage but it is unlikely that he would recover to the extent that he will not need this. [Defendant’s counsel]: I understand, yes. We understand that the treatment is lifelong - that’s what you recommended. But I’m just asking that it’s possible that he’ll need less than $3,000? [Dr Wong]: Yes. [Defendant’s counsel]: Would it be---it could be within the 1,500 per treatment range that you indicated in your report. Am I right? [Dr Wong]: It may but unlikely because he’s developing more and more of these abnormal movements now. That’s why it’s gradually been coming up. … … [Plaintiff’s counsel]: … You see, we lawyers, we've got this thing called a balance of probability, so that’s why I’m using the words “more likely than not”. Is [the cost of botox treatment] more likely than not to go down? More likely than not to remain the same? Or more likely than not to go up? [Dr Wong]: More likely to remain the same. 157 A closer reading of Dr Wong’s cross-examination shows that what he is actually saying is that there is a possibility that the plaintiff’s need for botox treatment will decrease in the future. The defendant also submits that, contrary to plaintiff’s counsel’s suggestion, the defendant need not show on thebalance of probabilitiesthat the annual cost of the plaintiff’s botox treatment will decrease.152Foot Note 152×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 317.On this basis, therefore, the defendant relies on Dr Wong’s evidence for adjusting the botox treatment costs down by 25%. 158 I agree with the defendant that the standard of proof in making a finding as to future loss, especially loss stretching decades into the future, cannot be approached in the same way as it is when making a finding as to a historical fact. Having said that, I am satisfied on the basis of Dr Wong’s evidence that the annual cost of the plaintiff’s botox treatment will not decline over the period of the plaintiff’s loss. All that Dr Wong accepted is that there is a possibility that these costs will decrease. Dr Wong also testified that the plaintiff “is developing more and more of these abnormal [facial] movements now. That’s why [the botox dosage has] gradually been coming up” and that “Over time, I see the dosage of botox he will need will be likely to increase”.153Foot Note 153×Certified Transcript (17 January 2020) at p 24, ln 29–31 and p 25, ln 11–ln 12.Dr Wong’s evidence is no basis on which to make any downward adjustment to this head of loss. 159 The defendant’s other argument is that the plaintiff will have less need for botox treatment once he undergoes a “functional muscle transfer” procedure. The defendant relies on Dr Wong’s evidence that “if there is no surgical intervention like functional muscle transfer, it is unlikely that he will have further recovery of the muscle function”,154Foot Note 154×Certified Transcript (17 January 2020) at p 24, ln 25–26.thus necessitating less botox treatment. The defendant extrapolates from Dr Wong’s evidence, and submits that the converse is also true. In other words, if thereisa functional muscle procedure, the plaintiff’s muscle functionwillrecover, and as such there is no need for further botox treatment. 160 In my view, this submission is anon sequitur. Dr Wong’s evidence is thatnotundergoing a surgical intervention like a functional muscle transferwillnecessitate more botox treatment. It does not follow that the opposite is true,ie, thatundergoingsuch a surgical intervention will necessitatelessbotox treatment. In all fairness, this may be implicit in Dr Wong’s evidence. But in the absence of an explicit statement from Dr Wong to this effect, I cannot accept the defendant’s submission. 161 I therefore find that the multiplicand for botox treatment is$6,000per annum. Psychotherapy 162 The parties agree that the plaintiff will require one-hour psychotherapy sessions once a week for the rest of his life,ie, about 52 sessions per year.155Foot Note 155×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 399.These psychotherapy sessions are distinct from psychiatric consultations and neuropsychological consultations for which the plaintiff is also claiming damages. Once again, the dispute between the parties is the reasonable cost of each session. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr Clare Henn-Haase (“Dr Henn-Haase”), testified that the hourly rate for the psychotherapy which the plaintiff needs is $350. The defendant’s expert, Dr Marina Yap (“Dr Yap”), testified that the hourly rate is $190. 163 The plaintiff argues that I should adopt Dr Henn-Haase’s rate for the multiplicand of this head of loss. According to the plaintiff, Dr Yap does not have specialist training inneuropsychology, which is the type of training necessary to render psychotherapy for the types of injuries that the plaintiff has suffered. It follows that Dr Yap’s rates are not indicative of what the plaintiff will have to pay, as Dr Yap does not have the necessary specific experience and qualifications to treat the plaintiff.156Foot Note 156×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 16. 164 I reject the plaintiff’s argument. The premise of the argument is that the plaintiff should receive psychotherapy from aneuropsychologistand not just a generalclinical psychologist. But Dr Henn-Haase, who was treating the plaintiff before she left Singapore, is a clinical psychologist and not a neuropsychologist.157Foot Note 157×Dr Clare Marie Henn-Haase’s AEIC at para 1.Further, the plaintiff himself said that the rate of $350 as quoted by Dr Henn-Haase is the “standard hourly rate for a clinical psychologist”.158Foot Note 158×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 18. 165 The fact of the matter is that Dr Henn-Haase and Dr Yap were giving quotations for the same medical treatment by the same type of psychologistie,psychotherapy with aclinical psychologist, but at two different centres. In the absence of evidence that the quality of the treatment between these two centres differs materially, there is no reason the plaintiff cannot undergo treatment at the centre charging the lower rate. 166 I thus find that the multiplicand in respect of psychotherapy is $190 per sessions x 52 sessions per annum or$9,880per annum. Caregiver expenses 167 The parties agree that the plaintiff will require life-long care. The difference between the parties is about the type of caregiver which it is reasonable to expect the plaintiff to receive the care from, and the reasonable cost of care by that caregiver. 168 The parties present estimates of the cost of two different types of caregiver. The first type is aprivate nurse,ie, a qualified nurse who is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident and who is registered with the Singapore Nursing Board (“SNB”).159Foot Note 159×Exhibit D4B; Anastasia Koriukova’s AEIC at p 37.A private nurse provides caregiving services on a live-out basis and therefore part-time. The second type of caregiver is a foreign domestic worker who comes to work in Singapore on a work permit and with qualifications as a nurse or a nursing aide in her home country but who is not registered with the SNB.160Foot Note 160×Exhibit D4A.This type of caregiver provides caregiving services on a live-in, and therefore full-time, basis. 169 The plaintiff’s case is that only a private nurse can meet his four requirements for a long-term caregiver. First, the caregiver must be professionally trained and qualified in caregiving161Foot Note 161×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 48.with a specialist understanding of brain injuries such as those which the plaintiff has suffered.162Foot Note 162×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 33.Second, the caregiver must be a native English speaker, so that she can deal with the communication difficulties caused by the plaintiff’s cognitive impairments.163Foot Note 163×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paras 41 and 42.Third, the caregiver must have the socio-cultural sensitivity necessary to care for the plaintiff. Finally, the caregiver must work part-time (ie, 12 hours a day),164Foot Note 164×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at p 126.as opposed to living with him and his family.165Foot Note 165×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 48.The plaintiff’s case is that a live-in caregiver who is also a foreign-qualified nurse cannot meet all four of these criteria .166Foot Note 166×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paras 39 and 40. 170 On the basis that a private nurse is the appropriate caregiver, the plaintiff submits that the cost of his long-term care will be $318 per hour for a twelve-hour day. This is consistent with the defendant’s evidence as to the cost of a private nurse, coincidentally from the same nursing agency. The annual cost of a private nurse is therefore $318 x 12 hours x 365 days or $116,070. 171 The defendant submits that the plaintiff’s claim for a private nurse is unreasonable, because a private nurse is not necessary.167Foot Note 167×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paras 360–362.According to the defendant, a live-in caregiver with nursing qualifications from her home country and one to two years’ nursing experience can meet the plaintiff’s caregiving needs just as well as a private nurse, but at a fraction of the cost.168Foot Note 168×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 471.Further, the defendant argues that the plaintiff’s caregiver should provide care full-time rather than part-time, which once again means a live-in caregiver is more appropriate. On this basis, the plaintiff’s care will cost $850 per month, or $10,200 per annum.169Foot Note 169×Exhibit D4B. 172 A private nurse who meets all of the plaintiff’s four criteria may well be the ideal mode of care for the plaintiff, as opposed to a live-in caregiver. But the test for recoverability is whether a particular head of claim is reasonable, not whether it is ideal. The question therefore is whether long-term care from a private nurse isreasonablein all the circumstances. I also accept the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff’s long-term caregiving needs can reasonably be met by a live-in caregiver. 173 I begin with the plaintiff’s requirement that his caregiver has a diploma in caregiving, be a registered nurse and has specialist knowledge of brain injuries. I consider this requirement can reasonably be met by a live-in caregiver. There is no evidence that a private nurse is more likely to have these skills than a live-in caregiver. In fact, a live-in caregiver can be as skilled in a functional sense as a private nurse. It is quite possible to engage a live-in caregiver who has a Bachelor of Science (Nursing) degree and more than a decade of experience as a nurse, albeit outside Singapore.170Foot Note 170×Exhibit D4A. 174 I now turn to the plaintiff’s requirement that his caregiver be a native English speaker. Again, I consider this requirement can reasonably be met by a live-in caregiver. It is true that the experts gave evidence that live-in caregivers, being from overseas, generally have only a basic facility with English. But this evidence was of a general nature. It does not follow thatallprivate nurses are more proficient in English thanalllive-in caregivers just because the former is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident and the latter is not. Further, the experts did not focus specifically on live-in caregivers provided by the agency identified by the defendant, Active Global Specialised Caregivers Pte Ltd. That agency says that the live-in caregivers it recruits “speak good English”.171Foot Note 171×Exhibit D4A.In addition, it is always possible to ask the agency to recruit a live-in caregiver who has greater facility with English than the usual live-in caregiver. 175 The plaintiff’s next requirement is that the caregiver possess socio-cultural sensitivity. Again, I consider this requirement can reasonably be met by a live-in caregiver. Once again, it is too much of a generalisation to assume thatallprivate nurses will be more socio-culturally sensitive thanalllive-in caregivers just because the former are Singapore citizens or permanent residents. In any event, socio-cultural sensitivity is a matter of experience. And there is nothing to suggest that a live-in caregiver will not acquire the requisite sensitivity in the course of assisting the plaintiff. 176 The plaintiff’s final requirement is that the caregiver work only 12 hours a day. I consider that a full-time, live-in caregiver will offer more complete care for the plaintiff than a part-time private nurse. First, the experts have given evidence that a caregiver will have to assist the plaintiff with his activities of daily living. A full-time, live-in caregiver will offer the plaintiff substantially more assistance with his activities of daily living than a part-time private nurse. Secondly, part-time private nurses work on rotation. This means that the plaintiff will get a different private nurse to care for him on different days. The experts agree that this may not be ideal because no single private nurse would be able to build up familiarity with the plaintiff and his specific needs.172Foot Note 172×Certified Transcript (24 January 2020) at p 34, ln 27 to p 35, ln 10.The plaintiff’s main concern about a live-in caregiver is that his residence has no physical space to accommodate her, and that engaging a live-in caregiver would create a noisy and crowded environment which would aggravate his condition.173Foot Note 173×Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions at para 194.However, I take the view that the plaintiff’s concern is exaggerated, and that the advantages of having a full-time caregiver would outweigh the disadvantages. I also bear in mind that a private nurse is more expensive than a live-in caregiver by a factor of ten. 177 For all of these reasons, I am satisfied that a live-in caregiver is the appropriate and reasonable mode of giving care to the plaintiff. The rates for a live-in caregiver vary according to the caregiver’s qualifications and experience. Given the serious nature of the plaintiff’s injuries and his resulting needs, I take the view that a live-in caregiver of the highest level of qualifications and experience would be the most appropriate. On the evidence presented to me, such a live-in caregiver would be one with a Bachelor of Science (Nursing) degree from her home country and more than a decade of experience. The salary for such a live-in caregiver is$1,000per month or$12,000per year.174Foot Note 174×Exhibit D4B. Transport expenses 178 For the avoidance of doubt, this head of claim is for the plaintiff’s cost of transport forrecurringmedical treatment only,ie, treatment which the plaintiff will have to undergo for the rest of his life. The parties disagree both on the number of trips that the plaintiff will reasonably need per annum for his recurring treatment as well as on the reasonable cost of each trip. 179 I start with the reasonable number of trips per annum. This number depends on the types of treatment that can be considered recurring. The parties agree on the number of trips which will be reasonable for recurring: (a) audiology consultations (five); (b) psychiatric consultations (13); (c) botox treatments (two); (d) psychotherapy (52); (e) neurology reviews for epilepsy (six). That makes a total of 78 agreed trips per annum.175Foot Note 175×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 52; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 496; Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 541. 180 The treatments for which the reasonable number of trips per annum is disputed are as follows: (a) Neuropsychological consultations and reviews: I agree with the defendant that the number of recurring neuropsychological consultations and reviews is onlyoneper year,ie, for the annual review. The weekly consultations will last only two years. This cannot be counted as a treatment which will recur every year for the rest of the plaintiff’s natural life. (b) Hospital treatments for seizures: the defendant submits that the plaintiff’s number for these trips should be discounted by 50% because the plaintiff may not suffer indefinitely from seizures. I do not accept this submission. There is no evidence that the plaintiff’s seizures will, or even may, cease. The reasonable number of trips for treatment for the plaintiff’s seizures is therefore awarded as claimed by the plaintiff: four per year. 181 The number of trips per annum which the plaintiff will have to make for recurring medical treatment is thus the agreed 78 trips plus a further five trips for recurring treatment for neuropsychological consultation and reviews and his seizures. That gives a total of 83 trips per annum. 182 I turn to the reasonable cost per trip. The plaintiff’s evidence is that the taxi fare from his home to the various clinics is between $10 and $15 one way.176Foot Note 176×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 56.The plaintiff claims the cost of his future trips at the upper end of this range at $30 per return trip. The defendant submits that the cost should be at the lower end of the range at $20 because private-hire transport fares (such as Grab) from the plaintiff’s home to the clinics is below $10 per one-way trip.177Foot Note 177×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 497. 183 I accept the defendant’s figure. First, there is no reason why the plaintiff ought not to take private hire vehicles, which are the more cost-effective option. The plaintiff asserts that he takes only taxis as private hire vehicles are, in his view, unsafe.178Foot Note 178×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 55.The plaintiff is of course entitled to his view. But I do not consider that view to be reasonable today. Private hire vehicles and their drivers are now regulated, and I consider them to be reasonably safe. Second, while the defendant offers evidence in support of his position on private-hire fares,179Foot Note 179×See the screenshots tendered by the defendant over the course of trial in relation to the Grab fares.no such evidence was offered by the plaintiff in relation to the taxi fares. 184 For completeness, the plaintiff also asserts that his estimate of $30 is a conservative one because it does not account for the peak surcharge.180Foot Note 180×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 56.It suffices to note that the evidence shows that he rarely incurs peak hour surcharges as his medical appointments are not usually scheduled during peak hours. 185 Accordingly, the transport expenses work out to $20 per trip x 83 trips per annum =$1,660per annum. The total 186 The multiplicand for the plaintiff’s claim for future medical expenses (leaving aside for the time being psychiatric treatment) is therefore as follows: S/NClaimQuantumper annumAgreed items1Neuropsychological review assessments3,000.002Anti-seizure medications12,840.003Neurology outpatient clinic reviews856.004Tinnitus treatment device1,264.745Hearing aids2,782.006Audiologic assessments401.25Disputed items7Botox6,0008Psychotherapy9,8809Caregiver expenses12,00010Transport expenses1,660Total50,684 187 The plaintiff’s award for future medical expenses (excluding psychiatric treatment) is therefore $50,684 x 18 = $912,312.",
        "The plaintiff’s post-retirement earnings": "126 The final issue in calculating the plaintiff’s loss of future earnings is his post-retirement income. The plaintiff’s case is that, but for the accident, he was likely to have continued working in a consulting or equivalent capacity from his retirement until age 70. As a result, the plaintiff argues that the damages awarded to him for loss of future earnings ought to include a component to compensate him for his lost post-retirement earnings.128Foot Note 128×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 177.As mentioned above at [38], I have decided to calculate the plaintiff’s post-retirement earnings separately from his pre-retirement earnings, because his annual income post-retirement (if any) would be much lower than his annual income pre-retirement. 127 The plaintiff relies on Mr Evans’ report, which states that it is very likely for a person of the plaintiff’s qualifications and experience to continue participating in economic activity post-retirement. Mr Evans also estimates that the plaintiff was likely to have earned anywhere between $125,000 and $250,000 per annum gross post-retirement.129Foot Note 129×Jonathan Mark Evans’ AEIC at p 55, para 312. 128 In response, the defendant argues that the plaintiff has not adduced any evidence of his intention to continue working post-retirement.130Foot Note 130×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 260.The defendant further argues that, in any event, projecting the plaintiff’s post-retirement earnings is exponentially more difficult than projecting his pre-retirement earnings. It would require so much guesswork and imagination that it is within the realm of mere speculation.131Foot Note 131×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at paras 257 and 259. 129 In my view, it is not necessary for the plaintiff to have testified that he intended to continue working post-retirement for me to find that there is an appreciable chance that he would do so. First, the plaintiff was only 38 at the time of the accident and 44 at the time of the assessment. He is simply too young to have given any serious thought to working post-retirement. Second, it is not clear what kind of evidence would suffice to establish his intention to continue working post-retirement. Perhaps the defendant has in mind a statement in the plaintiff’s affidavit that he intended to continue working post-retirement. A bare statement to that effect is neither meaningful nor necessary. Any evidence he would give about his intentions in more than 20 years’ time would be of little or no evidential weight. 130 The prospect of the plaintiff continuing to work post-retirement thus depends on the strength and cogency of Mr Evans’ expert evidence. While I have expressed my criticism of Mr Evans’ expert evidence on certain points, these criticisms generally arise in relations to Mr Evans’ lack of methodology in thequantificationof the figures which he presented to this court. However, this criticism carries less weight in relation to the assessment of what is essentially aqualitativeassessment of the post-retirement aspirations of a person in the plaintiff’s position. Methodological clarity is, in my view, less important for such a qualitative assessment. What is more important is the expert’s credentials and experience in the field. On this part, there is little fault that can be found with Mr Evans’ evidence.132Foot Note 132×Jonathan Mark Evans’ AEIC at pp 9–10, paras 1–12.Further, there is no denying the fact that but for the accident, the plaintiff would have amassed a wealth of experience by his retirement as (at the minimum) a MDSA, which is a relatively senior position. I therefore find that there is an appreciable chance that the plaintiff would have continued working post-retirement. 131 However, when it comes to thequantificationof the plaintiff’s post-retirement income, Mr Evans’ evidence once again falls short. This quantification exercise naturally places a greater premium on methodological clarity, and there was none from Mr Evans. It is understandable that a precise quantification of the plaintiff’s post-retirement income is impossible, but Mr Evans could have at least explained the methodology underlying his conclusions. In addition, Mr Evans did not state how long a person in the plaintiff’s position would be likely to continue working post-retirement. The plaintiff was content to assert, without any evidence or justification, that he would work until 70 years old. I do not find this bare assertion to be sufficient. 132 In the circumstances, I consider it more appropriate to make a lump-sum award for the plaintiff’s lost post-retirement earnings. I am once again constrained by the evidence, but this evidential uncertainty must be overcome to award just compensation to a tort victim. Viewing the evidence in the round, I am of the view that a lump-sum award of$100,000is appropriate. That lump sum is, of course, a present value and has therefore already been discounted for accelerated receipt.",

        "Recurring future medical and related expenses": "",
        "Psychiatric expenses": "188 I have calculated the cost of the plaintiff’s future psychiatric care separately because the parties have agreed the cost for psychiatric care between 2020 and 2025. The only dispute on this head of loss, therefore, is the multiplier for the period from 2025 onwards. 189 For the period from 2025 onwards, the number of periods of future loss are only 37 – 5 = 32. Strictly speaking, a multiplier would be the starting point for calculating the present value of a lump sum which will be drawn on immediately and the value of which will fall to zero five years before the plaintiff reaches 81 years of age. But in this case, I am attempting to calculate the present value of a lump sum which will not be drawn on until 2025 and the value of which will fall to zero when the plaintiff reaches 81 years of age. Accordingly, the income earned on this lump sum at the discount rate will compound without any deduction for the first five years. In other words, this lump sum will not be drawn down to pay for psychiatric care until 2025. So, from 2020 to 2025, the entire income which the plaintiff earns on this lump sum will augment the capital and itself yield a return. Be that as it may, I do not consider the differences to be material. 190 On the arithmetic method, applying the selected discount rate of 4.25%, the formula yields a multiplier of 17.31. I round that to 17 as the nearest integer. This is roughly consistent with the multiplier obtained from the Singapore Tables (for a starting age of 44 + 5 = 49) at between 17.35 and 18.58.181Foot Note 181×PB2 at p 96.Adopting the multiplier of 17, the claim for the plaintiff’s recurring psychiatric treatment is $10,700 x 17 = $181,900.",
        "One-off future medical expenses": "",
        "The applicable principles": "192 The principles applicable to awarding damages for medical expenses have been set out at [150]–[152] above. Much like recurring medical expenses, one-off medical expenses are recoverable insofar that they are reasonable. Whether the treatment is necessary and effective are relevant factors when determining whether the medical treatment is reasonable.",
        "Plastic surgery procedures": "Upper eyelid surgery 193 The defendant accepts that surgery on the plaintiff’s upper eyelid is necessary.182Foot Note 182×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 300.The dispute is about the cost of the surgery. The plaintiff’s expert, Dr Wong, estimates the cost as being between $18,000 and $20,000.183Foot Note 183×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 60. 194 The plaintiff submits that he should be awarded damages at the higher end of the range because of healthcare inflation. I have explained why I am not convinced by this argument at [143] above. The defendant submits that damages should be awarded at the lower end of the range but does not explain why. 195 In the circumstances, I am inclined to choose the midpoint of the range quoted by Dr Wong,ie, $19,000. Facial reconstruction procedures 196 The plaintiff’s face was seriously injured in the accident. He will therefore require three surgical procedures to his face: a tissue transfer, fat grafting and a face tightening.184Foot Note 184×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 58.The defendant accepts that all of these procedures are reconstructive as opposed to aesthetic,ie, that their purpose is to restore the plaintiff to his pre-accident position rather than to improve upon his pre-accident position.185Foot Note 185×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at paras 340–341.Even then, the defendant argues that the cost of these procedures is not recoverable, as these facial reconstruction procedures are not necessary in the sense that they serve no functional purpose. 197 On the point of necessity, the defendant points to Dr Wong’s evidence that the facial reconstruction procedures seek to restore the plaintiff’s ability to communicate and interact with others. However, the defendant argues that the plaintiff’s ability to communicate and interact with others has been irreversibly impaired because of the cognitive damage he suffered as a result of the accident. The facial reconstruction procedures would have no effect on the cognitive damage.186Foot Note 186×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 347.As a result, these procedures cannot improve his ability to communicate and interact with others. 198 Further, the defendant rejects the plaintiff’s case that these procedures will alleviate the plaintiff’s psychological issues arising from the injuries to his face.187Foot Note 187×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 349.According to the defendant, any psychological issues arising from the plaintiff’s facial injuries are ultimately linked to his ability to communicate and interact with others. It follows that even if these procedures restore the plaintiff (as far as possible) to his pre-accident position, his communication deficits and psychological issues will remain. 199 The defendant directs the argument on effectiveness to the tissue transfer. He rejects the plaintiff’s position that the tissue transfer is “related to” the plaintiff’s synkinesis (in respect of which botox treatment is accepted as necessary – see [154] above).188Foot Note 188×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 359.The defendant argues that the tissue transfer, much like the face tightening, targets the plaintiff’s facial symmetry, which is a completely different condition from the synkinesis. In this regard, the defendant relies on Dr Wong’s evidence that even with the tissue transfer, the plaintiff’s face would still be significantly asymmetric. According to the defendant, this means that the tissue transfer is not effective and therefore irrecoverable. 200 I begin with the defendant’s argument on necessity. The central premise of this argument is that restoring the plaintiff’s facial appearance to its pre-accident state will not enhance his ability to communicate and interact with others. I do not accept this premise. It is true that the parties’ experts gave evidence that the plaintiff’sspeechissues are permanent because of his cognitive deficits and brain injuries.189Foot Note 189×Certified Transcript (16 January 2020) at p 7, ln 12 to p 8, ln 20.But I accept, as the plaintiff points out, thatspeechis only oneaspect of communication,ie,communication can be verbalandnon-verbal.190Foot Note 190×Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions at para 169.In fact, Dr Wong gave evidence in cross-examination that:191Foot Note 191×Certified Transcript (17 January 2020) at p 18, lns 15–21. And Your Honour, you mentioned what is the function of the face. … But humans have a higher function that is communication. That means when you look at me, you can tell whether I am afraid, whether I’m comfortable, whether I’m---I’m concerned about something.All these communicate through very subtle muscle of facial expressions - the eyes and the mouth and especially around the eyes. So, with deformities in the face, it affects your ability to communicate. If anything, it distracts people. It is evident from Dr Wong’s testimony that restoring the plaintiff’s facial appearance may have a tangible effect on his ability to communicatenon-verbally. To that extent, I am satisfied that the facial reconstruction procedures are reasonable and therefore recoverable. 201 A subsidiary premise of the defendant’s argument on necessity is that the plaintiff’s psychological issues are solely, or substantially,attributable to his inability to communicate. Given that I have accepted that facial reconstruction procedures may improve the plaintiff’s ability to communicate non-verbally, this premise no longer assists the defendant even if true. However, I am not even satisfied that this premise is true. I am satisfied that the plaintiff’s psychological issues are substantially caused by morethan just the plaintiff’s inability to communicate. Dr Henn-Haase192Foot Note 192×Dr Clare Marie Henn-Haase’s AEIC at pp 35–36.and another expert, Dr Calvin Fones (“Dr Fones”)193Foot Note 193×Dr Fones Calvin Soon Leng’ AEIC at p 26, para 43.gave evidence that the plaintiff is understandably embarrassed and self-conscious about his looks. Given this evidence, I accept that the plaintiff’s psychological issues are caused both by his inability to communicate and by his embarrassment and self-consciousness. 202 I turn now to the defendant’s argument on effectiveness. I reject this argument also. It is true that the plaintiff will continue to suffer from facial asymmetry even after the tissue transfer and the face tightening. But that does not mean that these procedures are so ineffective as to be unreasonable and therefore irrecoverable. The defendant’s submission assesses effectiveness on anabsolutebasis. On the defendant’s submission, a treatment is effective only if it alleviatescompletelythe consequences of a particular injury. This position is in my view incompatible with the nature of post-accident medical treatment, which is tomitigatethe damage caused by the accident. Inherent in the idea of mitigation is a recognition that a complete return to the pre-injury condition may not always be possible. In my view, effectiveness is better assessed on arelativebasis. A treatment is effective, and its cost is therefore recoverable, if it is likely to produce a reasonable improvement in the plaintiff’s condition as compared to his current condition, even if his improved condition is not identical to his pre-accident condition. I find that the tissue transfer and the face tightening will effect a reasonable improvementin the plaintiff’s facial asymmetry, even if they may not eliminate the asymmetry. 203 For these reasons, I find that the cost of the surgical procedures to the plaintiff’s face are recoverable. I will take the cost of the treatments as the midpoint of the range quoted by Dr Wong, which amounts to:194Foot Note 194×AB1 at p 383; Affidavit of Dr Wong Chin Ho (23 October 2019) at p 22; (a) Tissue transfer: $125,000. (b) Fat grafting: $87,500 (being $17,500 per treatment x 5 treatments). (c) Face tightening: $50,000. The total of these sums is $262,500. Scar revision 204 The defendant submits that scar revision is neither necessary nor effective.195Foot Note 195×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 318.It is not necessary because the plaintiff does not complain that the scars cause him any discomfort. It is not effective because the plaintiff’s scars will remain quite visible even after the procedure as a result of the plaintiff’s hair loss. 205 On the issue of necessity, there is in fact evidence that the plaintiff has complained of discomfort. I refer to Dr Wong’s evidence in cross-examination:196Foot Note 196×Certified Transcript (17 January 2020) at p 16, lns 7–11. [Defendant’s counsel]:  Would you then agree with me that the scars are actually---presence of the scars only affect [the plaintiff’]s aesthetics? [Dr Wong]: I think that is---it’s---it’s also a functional problem because the---the scars, they are---they are hard, firm and tender. So, you know,hefeels uncomfortable and---and tight around---around all those scars. [emphasis added] 206 As for effectiveness, I disagree with the defendant’s position for the reasons set out at [202] above. The scar revision is reasonable because it is likely toeffect a reasonableimprovementin(and not necessarilyeliminate) the plaintiff’s scalp scars. 207 I therefore allow the costs of the scar revision at $11,000, which is the midpoint of Dr Wong’s quoted range.197Foot Note 197×Dr Wong Chin Ho’s AEIC at p 22.",
        "Shoulder procedures": "208 There are two components to the plaintiff’s claim for medical treatment for his shoulder injuries: the cost of the shoulder operation itself and the costs of the physiotherapy sessions after the shoulder operation. Shoulder operation 209 The plaintiff’s expert, Dr Ang Kian Chuan (“Dr Ang”) estimates the cost of the shoulder operation as between $26,857 and $34,347.198Foot Note 198×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 73.The plaintiff claims an award at the top end of Dr Ang’s estimate, given healthcare inflation. 210 I disagree. I have explained at [143] above why the plaintiff’s evidence is not a sufficient factual basis to conclude that inflation rates for medical treatment will continue to be high. In any event, Dr Ang’s quotation is relatively recent, dated November 2019. 211 The defendant submits that the award should be at the bottom end of Dr Ang’s estimate, but does not explain why.199Foot Note 199×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 333.I thus choose the midpoint of Dr Ang’s estimate as the award,ie,$30,602. Physiotherapy sessions 212 Dr Ang recommends that the plaintiff undergo physiotherapy three times a week for five years at $80 to $150 per session.200Foot Note 200×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 75; Dr Ang Kian Chuan’s AEIC at p 17.However, the plaintiff points out that he has been paying $195 for one-hour physiotherapy sessions at PhysioActive Pte Ltd (“PhysioActive”).201Foot Note 201×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 75.The plaintiff argues that PhysioActive’s actual rates should be used instead of Dr Ang’s general evidence as to physiotherapy rates for two reasons.202Foot Note 202×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 75.First, the plaintiff has been going to PhysioActive for a long period of time and thus is familiar with his physiotherapist there. Second, his physiotherapist at PhysioActive has specific training in brain injuries and is thus better equipped to deal with any complications that arise from the plaintiff’s residual injuries. 213 I do not accept the plaintiff’s argument. Even assuming that the plaintiff is more familiar with a particular physiotherapist at PhysioActive, and even assuming that that therapist has training in brain injuries and is better equipped to deal with the plaintiff (the latter premise is one which the defendant denies),203Foot Note 203×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at paras 395–397.these two premises show only that continuing the plaintiff’s physiotherapy at PhysioActive isideal. However, the threshold for recovery is one ofreasonableness. In this regard, given that Dr Ang is theplaintiff’sown expert, and recommends physiotherapy at the lower rate, Dr Ang must consider itreasonablefor the plaintiff to undergo physiotherapy at those rates. If the plaintiff disagreed with Dr Ang’s rates, the onus was on him to clarify with Dr Ang whether a rate higher than this was in fact reasonable in the circumstances of the plaintiff’s case. Having failed to do so, it does not lie in the plaintiff’s mouth to now argue that Dr Ang’s rates are too low.204Foot Note 204×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 394. 214 No evidence was given by either party in support of the lower end or higher end of Dr Ang’s range. I therefore take the midpoint of Dr Ang’s range and find that $115 per session is the reasonable cost of physiotherapy. At three sessions per week for 52 weeks a year for five years, the cost of physiotherapy amounts to $89,700 (being $115 x 3 x 52 x 5).",
        "Speech and communication treatments": "215 The plaintiff’s claim for speech and communication treatment comprises two different items:205Foot Note 205×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 87. (a) speech therapy for himself, aimed at improving his ability to communicate generally; and (b) communication training for himself and his wife (or other communication partner), aimed at improving his ability to communicate with his wife (or other communication partner) specifically. Speech therapy 216 I begin with the first type of treatment. The defendant’s case is that speech therapy for the plaintiff will not be effective and is therefore not recoverable.206Foot Note 206×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paras 254 and 259–263.The defendant relies on the evidence of his speech therapist expert witness, Dr Phua Sin Yong (“Dr Phua”) and the plaintiff’s speech therapist expert witness, Ms Sajlia Jalil (“Ms Sajlia”). The experts gave evidence that the plaintiff’s communication issues stem from his brain injuries and are thus likely to be permanent. They also agree that any recovery of the plaintiff’s communicative faculties would have occurred within the first two years after the accident, known as the “golden period”. Past the golden period, any improvement to the plaintiff’s communication issues at the “impairment level” through speech therapy will be minimal. 217 It is now necessary to explain the concept of “impairment level”. “Impairment level” is contrasted with “activity participation level”.207Foot Note 207×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 80.To borrow an analogy from plaintiff’s counsel,208Foot Note 208×Certified Transcript (16 January 2020) at p 25, lns 5–7.imagine a painter losing both his hands who learns to paint using his feet. In this analogy, the painter’s impairment level is the loss of his hands. That impairment is absolute and irreversible. However, his participation level for the activity of painting is unchanged, because he has learned to paint with his feet instead of with his hands. 218 Applied to the plaintiff, his impairment level refers to the cognitive injuries which are the root cause of his communication difficulties. His activity participation level refers to the plaintiff’spractical abilityto communicate with others. The defendant’s argument thus proceeds on the assumption that the activity participation level is related to the impairment level,ie, that if the plaintiff’s impairment level remains severe even after speech therapy, his activity participation level will consequently and necessarily remain low. 219 The plaintiff disagrees with the defendant’s position. He asserts that hedidundergo some speech training during the golden period.209Foot Note 209×Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions at para 145.He also argues that speech therapy after the golden period will still be effective at providing the plaintiff with aworkaround210Foot Note 210×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 82.to his communication issues, ie, that speech therapy can improve his activity participation level despite his severe and irreversible cognitive impairment. He points to evidence showing that Dr Phua and his neuropsychologist, Dr Simon Collinson (“Dr Collinson”), are both of the view that long-term future speech therapy will be beneficial to the plaintiff.211Foot Note 211×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paras 83 and 84.He further argues that even if speech therapy is ineffective at treating his communication issues, it will nevertheless be effective at alleviating his social anxiety, which is occasioned by his communication difficulties. 220 I accept the defendant’s position. The plaintiff’s first argument that he did undergo speech training during the golden period is irrelevant, because the effectiveness of the future speech therapy is not predicated on whether he did undergo speech therapy during the golden period. 221 The plaintiff’s second argument that future speech therapy will provide a workaround to his communication issues is also unconvincing. He relied on Dr Phua’s following testimony in cross-examination:212Foot Note 212×Certified Transcript (16 January 2020) at p 25, ln 30 to p 28, ln 16. [Plaintiff’s counsel]: … would I be correct then that one of the objectives of training and therapy is to provide the patient with a workaround of the impairment or deficit in terms of fulfilling the activities that the patient ought or wants to do? [Dr Phua]: One of the goals of therapy is to help to reduce the functional difficulties, yes. … [Dr Phua]: The concept of communication is two-ways. So, in the case of [the plaintiff], if he’s unable to get his point across, it is generally sometimes it may be difficult for the caregiver, no matter how trained, to understand. It is also possible that the caregiver when the caregiver responds to or communicates with the patient, he may not understand. … [Plaintiff’s counsel]: And if you look at somebody with neurocognitive injury like [the plaintiff] and if we assume that there are certain side effects in his behaviour, do you agree that the ability to communicate effectively with his caregiver would improve if it can be done, would improve his quality of life? [Dr Phua]: I would agree with that. 222 The plaintiff’s argument here seem to be as follows: it is necessary for treatment to be focused onhimand not just the people with whom he communicates, since the people around him, no matter how trained, will not be able to understand him if he himself cannot get his point across. Speech therapy is one such plaintiff-centric treatment. Speech therapy is also effective, because the goal of speech therapy, in Dr Phua’s own words, is to “reduce the functional difficulties [with impaired speech]”.213Foot Note 213×Certified Transcript (16 January 2020) at p 26, lns 3–4.In other words, speech therapy will give the plaintiff a workaround and allow him to restore his participation level in relation to the activity of communication even though his impairment level in relation remains severe and irreversible. The plaintiff never quite elaborated on how this workaround would work, but I assume him to mean that he can be taught to communicatenon-verballyas opposed toverbally. 223 I can accept that treatment which focuses on improving the plaintiff’s ability to communicate with others must necessarily be plaintiff-centric. However, it does not follow that such plaintiff-centric treatment must necessarily be speech therapy. As the defendant points out, communication training is also plaintiff-centric, since it involves theplaintiffand his communication partner.214Foot Note 214×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at paras 287–288. 224 Further, it also does not follow that speech therapy will be effective. In the excerpts relied on by the plaintiffs, the last two questions and answers took place in the context of a discussion oncommunication training, and not speech therapy.215Foot Note 215×Certified Transcript (16 January 2020) at p 27, ln 23 to p 28, ln 16.I therefore do not give much weight to the last two questions and answers. As to the first question and answer, that exchange on its own may be interpreted as support for the plaintiff’s idea that speech therapymayprovide a workaround. However, the plaintiff has left out this critical piece of evidence from Dr Phua:216Foot Note 216×Certified Transcript (16 January 2020) at p 27, lns 3–18. [Plaintiff’s counsel]: … For the person who’s making the---communicating---the person who’s got the problem like Mr Pollmann, you can either make him talk better or you can teach him to work around the impairment, right? Dr Phua? [Dr Phua]: For the use of the limbs without the brain injury.it might be a lot easier than to train a person with brain injury to overcome a---a huge deficit. … [Plaintiff’s counsel]: It will be difficult but that’s one aspect you can work on, right? [Dr Phua]: It is not---it is not that you can’t work on it. There might be a lot of resources needed to get there. [Plaintiff’s counsel]: That’s right, so you can. [Dr Phua]:Then I don’t know how much can be gained from doing it even if something were done. [emphasis added] 225 Dr Phua was thus of the clear view that even if the plaintiff canbe taught a workaround,ie, to learn to communicate non-verbally,such an effort would be a herculean one that may not ultimately bear fruit. Dr Phua’s position is consistent with the defendant’s premise, that the plaintiff’s impairment level is connected to his activity participation level: if the first is poor, generally so will the second, and to improve the second without a corresponding improvement of the first would require a herculean effort. 226 In the circumstances, while I am not prepared to accept the defendant’s blanket assertion that speech therapywillbeineffective, I do find that speech therapyis likely to beineffective, or would likely involve an unreasonable level of effort and resources in order to be effective. This means that the plaintiff’s second argument does not take him very far. 227 I also find the plaintiff’s third argument unconvincing: that both Dr Phua and Dr Collinson recommended that he undergo future speech therapy. First, he claims that Dr Phua recommended intensive speech therapy – three times a week – in a telephone call to the plaintiff’s wife in the broader context of the plaintiff’s general future treatment.217Foot Note 217×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 83.However, my impression is that the plaintiff’s interpretation of Dr Phua’s testimony may have been too critical. I set out the exchange for ease of reference:218Foot Note 218×Certified Transcript (16 January 2020) at p 28, ln 28 to p 31, ln 17. [Plaintiff’s counsel]: … when you did the evaluation on Mr Pollmann, you also had a fairly long conversation with his wife. Am I right? [Dr Phua]: That’s correct. [Plaintiff’s counsel]: And she discussed with you possible treatment options, am I right? [Dr Phua]: Not during that time. [Plaintiff’s counsel]: And subsequently, did she deal with you---discuss with you possible treatment options? … [Dr Phua]: She rang to ask about frequency and intensity. She did not ask about options in terms of what needs to be done, if that’s what you’re after. … [Plaintiff’s counsel]: And did you give her an answer? [Dr Phua]: Yes, I did. [Plaintiff’s counsel]: And what was the answer? [Dr Phua]: And I did advise her thatfor a typical person who’s coming for treatment, our general approach is to start off with intensive work. So that would be at least three times a week. [Plaintiff’s counsel]: And the context of that conversation was in the context of her husband, am I right? [Dr Phua]:It was for a generic patient who needed treatment. … [Plaintiff’s counsel]: … the only context in which you communicated with Mrs Pollmann was in relation to your evaluation of her husband. Am I right? [Dr Phua]: It---it would be good to assume that it was related to him. [Plaintiff’s counsel]: But Dr Phua, the---you never knew them before Mr Pollmann was referred to you for evaluation--- [Dr Phua]: That’s correct. [Plaintiff’s counsel]: …The only occasion you met Mr Pollmann was on the two days you evaluated him, right?… [He is] not your patient, otherwise. [Dr Phua]: That’s correct. [emphasis added] 228 The plaintiff’s argument here is that Dr Phua was recommending speech therapy, and Dr Phua must have known that she was talking to the plaintiff’s wife about the plaintiff. Therefore, this recommendation of speech therapy must have been directed at the plaintiff. This argument in my view ignores both that Dr Phua expressly qualified what she said by saying that she was recommending treatment for agenericpatient, and by the fact that the plaintiff wasnotDr Phua’s patient at the time of the telephone call. The more probable interpretation of this testimony to me is that Dr Phua, not having been apprised of the plaintiff’s conditions in detail, had to make do with dispensing generic advice that was not tailored to his needs. This cannot be interpreted as Dr Phua endorsing speech therapy for the plaintiff. 229 Second, the plaintiff argues that Dr Collinson also recommended that the plaintiff undergo speech therapy. The plaintiff relies on Dr Collinson’s following observation:219Foot Note 219×Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions at para 146. Instead, seeing Mr Pollmann on at least several occasions and, in the case of cognitive and behavioural symptoms, applying appropriate serial testing of cognition with standardised neuropsychological and speech pathology tests is the most accurate way to chart recovery following traumatic brain injury. 230 I do not interpret these observations the same way the plaintiff does. All Dr Collinson is saying is thatspeech pathology testsare an accurate way to chart the plaintiff’s recovery. I do not think that speech pathology tests are the same thing as speech therapy. Further, “chart[ing] [the plaintiff’s] recovery” in my view simply meansmeasuringthe progress and extent of his recovery. 231 I end with the plaintiff’s final argument that speech therapy may help his social anxiety. The plaintiff’s social anxiety comes from his communication difficulties. If speech therapy proves ineffective at alleviating these difficulties (which is likely to be the case), the plaintiff’s communication issues will remain and so will his social anxiety. If speech therapy proves effective, the plaintiff’s social anxiety may improve. But this would involve an unreasonable level of effort and resources. 232 In summary, I find that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover the costs of speech therapy treatment. Communication training 233 In relation to communication training, the defendant (rightly) does not argue that it is not effective. Ms Sajlia gave evidence, which was not seriously contested, that communication training can enhance the plaintiff’s activity participation level despite his impairment level remaining severe and irreversible. This is because the plaintiff’s communication partner will be taught to understand him better. This in turn will alleviate the plaintiff’s difficulties in making himself understood. 234 However, the defendant argues instead that communication training is not necessary, at least as between the plaintiff and his wife. The defendant’s case is essentially that the plaintiff’s wife is already adequately equipped to understand him and take care of his needs, having done so for the six years since the accident.220Foot Note 220×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 305. 235 I do not accept the defendant’s argument. The defendant refers to the wife’s evidence that “she knew and understood [the plaintiff] the best and to the extent that she was the only conduit through which [the plaintiff] could live with and communicate with their domestic helper”.221Foot Note 221×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 271.When this testimony is read in context,222Foot Note 222×Certified Transcript (15 January 2020) at p 61, lns 12–22.I am satisfied that the wife was merely trying to make therelativepoint that she can understand the plaintiffbetter than others. This does not mean that she can understand the plaintiffwellor that her ability to understand the plaintiff cannot be improved. In the same vein, that she has been caring for the plaintiff for the past six years does not mean that her caregiving has been without difficulties, and in particular, communication difficulties. In fact, there was no evidence to that effect. I accept that there is room for improving the plaintiff’s wife’s ability to understand the plaintiff and that further communication training is therefore reasonable. 236 In addition, I accept that communication training for the plaintiff and hiscaregiverwill also be necessary, given that the caregiver will be looking after the plaintiff’s needs daily. The defendant does not dispute that communication therapy for the plaintiff and his caregiver will be necessary, should the caregiver be someone other than the plaintiff’s wife.223Foot Note 223×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paras 269–271. 237 Ms Sajlia gave evidence in cross-examination that communication training is effective only for about six months at a time.224Foot Note 224×Certified Transcript (16 January 2020) at p 53, lns 10–16.The plaintiff relies on this to argue that he is entitled to recover the cost of recurring communication training, since there is evidence that communication training will not be effective for life. The defendant points out that Ms Sajlia’s evidence is based on a study which was stopped after half a year.225Foot Note 225×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 306.There is thus no empirical evidence on how long the effects of communication training can last past the six-month period, meaning that communication training may very well prove effective for the plaintiff’s life. In the absence of empirical evidence, I am constrained to resolving this issue in favour of the defendant, as the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff. 238 The cost of communication training for one partner is $1,800.226Foot Note 226×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 87(b).Since I have found that communication training is justified for the plaintiff’s wife and his caregiver, the total cost amounts to $3,600.",
        "Transport expenses": "239 This head of claim is for the cost of the plaintiff’s transport forone-offmedical treatments. The cost of the plaintiff’s transport for recurring medical treatment has been dealt with at [185] above. 240 Based on my holdings in relation to the one-off treatments that the plaintiff is entitled to, the number of trips that the plaintiff will have to take is as follows:227Foot Note 227×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 53. S/NTreatmentNumber of trips1Plastic surgery procedures(Upper eyelid surgery – 1 trip;Facial tightening procedures – 6 trips;Scar revision – 1 trip)82Vagus nerve simulator implantation13Surgery to correct complications caused by craniectomy14Shoulder operation15Physiotherapy post-shoulder operation1566Communication training(10 trips, but allowance given for training with two different partners)207Neuropsychological consultations(weekly consultations for two years at 52 weeks a year)104Total291 241 I have determined that the reasonable cost per trip is $20 (see above). The total award for transport expenses for one-off medical treatment is thus $20 x 291 = $5,820.",
        "Pre-trial loss of earnings": "",
        "The plaintiff’s loss of earnings": "243 The plaintiff’s pre-trial loss of earnings is calculated for the period from 2015 to 2019, both years inclusive. The calculation will begin with an assessment of the sum which the plaintiff would have earned during this period but for the accident, from which his actual earnings during this period will be deducted to arrive at his net loss of earnings during this period. 244 At the date of the accident in 2014, the plaintiff’s base salary was $30,000 per month, or $360,000 per year.229Foot Note 229×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 153(a).As I have held earlier in calculating the plaintiff’s loss of future earnings, the plaintiff would have been promoted from ED to MDSA only in 2020 (see [107] above). Therefore, for the period from 2015 to 2019, the plaintiff’s base salary would not have increased by reason of a promotion. However, he would still have been awarded the usual annual increments, assumed to be a constant 2.5% per annum. The average of the plaintiff’s base salary for the period between 2015 and 2019 inclusive would thus be his base salary for the year 2017, which would be 245 In addition to his base salary, the plaintiff would also have earned bonuses for these three years. I have found that the plaintiff would have earned average yearly bonuses of 35% of his base salary from 2020 onwards (see [121] above). I am inclined to adopt a slightly different average yearly bonus rate for the period from 2015 to 2019 inclusive, as evidence exists, and has been tendered, about the state of the economy in general and the private banking industry specifically for this period. Having considered the evidence, I am minded to adjust the average yearly bonus figure downwards to 25%. The plaintiff’s average net income for the period between 2015 and 2019 inclusive would therefore beFrom this figure, I add the agreed pension contribution of $24,458 (see [123] above), to reach a final value of $509,058 for each of these years. 246 From this figure for his gross annual salary, the income tax payable would have been [0.22 x ($509,058- $15,000 - $320,000) + $44,550] = $82,842.76. His income post-tax would thus have been $426,215.24. For the period between 2015 and 2019 inclusive, which is five years, the amount that the plaintiff could have earned had the accident not happened would be $426,215.24 x 5 = $2,131,076. 247 I must deduct from this figure the amount of money which the plaintiff actually earned from 2015 to 2019. The plaintiff’s notices of assessment for the years 2015 and 2016 show that his gross income for these two years was $361,171 and $364,338 respectively.230Foot Note 230×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 172.The defendant points out that the plaintiff’s notice of assessment for the year 2015 took into account a $50,000 bonus awarded for the year 2014,231Foot Note 231×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 416.which ought to be excluded from  his income during this period. I accept the defendant’s claim, since a lower value of the plaintiff’s actual earned income is to the plaintiff’s benefit. The plaintiff’s real pre-tax income would be $311,371 for 2015 and $364,338 for 2016. The plaintiff’s tax liability, bearing in mind a $15,000 deduction for allowable tax relief,232Foot Note 232×Plaintiff’s AEIC (11 November 2019) at 100–101.would have been $38,096.78 for 2015 and $50,504.36 for 2016. The plaintiff’s net income for 2015 and 2016 would therefore be $273,274.22 and $313,833.64 respectively, or $587,108 in total. The plaintiff did not earn any income from 2017 to 2019.233Foot Note 233×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 416. 248 The plaintiff’s pre-trial loss of earnings thus amounts to $2,131,076 - $587,108 = $1,543,968.",
        "The plaintiff’s wife’s loss of earnings": "249 The plaintiff also claims damages in respect of his wife’s loss of income.234Foot Note 234×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 115.According to the plaintiff, his accident forced his wife to give up her career in order to care for him.235Foot Note 235×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 121.Therefore, he submits, the income which his wife would otherwise have earned ought to be recoverable from the defendant. 250 The defendant disagrees with the plaintiff’s characterisation of this claim as a claim for the wife’s loss of income.236Foot Note 236×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 403.According to the defendant, any loss of income which the plaintiff’s wife suffered is not the plaintiff’s loss but loss suffered by a third party.237Foot Note 237×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 374.As a result, that loss is not recoverable in this actionper se. At most, it can be recovered by proxy as the reasonable cost of the plaintiff’s pre-trial care. Given that this claim is properly one for the costs of care, the defendant submits that any award ought to be capped at the reasonable cost of caring for the plaintiff,ie, the cost of hiring a live-in caregiver. 251 The defendant also points out that plaintiff had a live-in foreign domestic worker before the accident, and that between 2015 and 2019, there were times when the plaintiff and his wife employed a second foreign domestic worker.238Foot Note 238×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 380.During these times, the defendant submits, there was one foreign domestic worker to do the general housework and another foreign domestic worker to be the plaintiff’s caregiver. The defendant relies on this to argue that, whenever the plaintiff was being cared for bybothhis wifeanda foreign domestic worker, the cost of care which is recoverable is the cost of only one of them, not both, given that the plaintiff does not argue that he needed the care ofbothhis wifeandthe second foreign domestic worker.239Foot Note 239×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 381. 252 The parties’ positions can be presented in tabular form as follows. By way of background, the wife’s lost income decreased in July 2018 because she took on a job, albeit at a reduced salary. The plaintiff’s claim is thus premised on the difference between what his wife actually earned during this period and $9,600 per month, which is what she could have earned if she did not have to be the plaintiff’s caregiver:240Foot Note 240×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 118, footnotes 96–100; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 383.

I agree with the defendant that the wife’s loss of income is not recoverable as such in an action by the plaintiff. Given that there is no rule in Singapore barring recovery in negligence for pure economic loss, it is conceivable that the plaintiff’s wife may in principle have a cause of action against the defendant in tort on the basis that the defendant owed her a duty of care not to injure her husband, on the application of the universal test set out inSpandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd vDefence Science & Technology Agency[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100. However, the plaintiff’s wife is not a party to this action and asserts no such claim. 254 The only legal route for the plaintiff to recover his wife’s loss is therefore to recharacterise her loss as his loss. This much is clear on the paragraph cited by the plaintiff himself fromDonnelly v Joyce[1974] QB 454 (“Donnelly”)at 461H–462A,perMegaw LJ:241Foot Note 241×Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions at para 197. We do not agree with the proposition … that the plaintiff’s claim … is properly to be regarded as being … ‘in relation to someone else’s loss,’ merely because someone else has provided to, or for the benefit of, the plaintiff – the injured person – the money, or the services to be valued as money, to provide for needs of the plaintiff directly caused by the defendant’s wrongdoing. The loss is the plaintiff’s loss. … The plaintiff’s loss, to take this present case, is not the expenditure of money … to pay for the nursing attention. His loss is the existence of the need for … those nursing services, the value of which for purposes of damages – for the purpose of the ascertainment of the amount of his loss – isthe proper and reasonable cost of supplying those needs. That, in our judgment, is the key to the problem. So far as the defendant is concerned, the loss is not someone else’s loss. It isthe plaintiff’s loss. [emphasis added] 255 The loss which the defendant’s tort inflicted upon the plaintiff is theneed for care. The measure of damages for this loss is theproper and reasonable costs ofmeeting the plaintiff’s need for care. Contrary to the plaintiff’s assertion,242Foot Note 242×Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions at para 197.it makes no difference whether the wife suffered a loss ofpastorfutureincome. In fact, the lost income claimed inDonnellywas the income which the tort victim’s mother had given up the opportunity of earningin the pastin order to take care of the victim. Therefore, the income which the plaintiff’s wife gave up the opportunity to earn in order to look after the plaintiff ought to be only astarting pointin assessing the monetary value of plaintiff’s loss. If it was reasonable to secure care for the plaintiff at a costbelowthe income which his wife lost, the defendant is not liable for the cost of providing care measured by the plaintiff’s wife’s lost income. 256 In this case, I have no hesitation in finding that this starting point ought to be departed from. As I have held earlier at [177], the reasonable cost of care for the plaintiff is $1,000 per month. That is true just as much for the plaintiff’s pre-trial care as it is for his future care. I therefore find that $1,000 per month is the ceiling for the plaintiff’s claim for his wife’s lost income. 257 There remains another issue. The defendant argues, in effect, that the plaintiff cannot recover damages for the care given by his wife for those periods when the plaintiff employed a second live-in foreign domestic worker. The plaintiff responds that the additional foreign domestic worker was hired to help his wife and their first foreign domestic worker look after the children, not the plaintiff. And therefore, the plaintiff’s wife remained the plaintiff’s full-time caregiver throughout the years since the accident, even when they employed a second foreign domestic worker.243Foot Note 243×Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions at para 200. 258 There is no objective evidence to support the plaintiff’s response on this point. Nevertheless, it is true that the plaintiff’s two children were just one and three years old at the time of the accident. I accept that the combined pressure on the household of dealing with the plaintiff’s injuries and with young children made it necessary to employ a second foreign domestic worker just to look after the children. I therefore allow the plaintiff to recover the reasonable costs of care even during the months in which the plaintiff employed a second foreign domestic worker. 259 The reasonable cost of care which the plaintiff can recover for the care which his wife gave him is $1,000 per month x 59 months (for the entire period between January 2015 and November 2019 inclusive) = $59,000.",

        "Past transport expenses": "262 The plaintiff claimed past transportation expenses amounting to $13,590.247Foot Note 247×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 97.However, he was able to furnish receipts for these expenses amounting to only $634.16.248Foot Note 248×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 96.The defendant thus submits the plaintiff should recover no more than $634.16.249Foot Note 249×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 490. 263 The absence of receipts does not, of course, preclude the court from awarding damages for the plaintiff’s pre-trial transport expenses. I can do so on the basis of a reasonable estimate. But I bear in mind that any such estimate should be a conservative one, to avoid putting plaintiffs who fail to produce receipts in a better position than plaintiffs who conscientiously retain receipts (Tan Hun Boonat [146]). The plaintiff submits that during the pre-trial period, he made a total of 459 trips.250Foot Note 250×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 96 and Annex B.This figure covers a period of six years and the plaintiff was able to furnish particulars of the trips. I accept this figure. At $20 per trip (see [182] above), the claim for past transport expenses amounts to $9,180.",
        "Costs of travel to Zurich for treatment": "264 The plaintiff was resident at a neurological rehabilitation clinic in Zurich, Switzerland between April and June 2015.251Foot Note 251×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 98.He travelled there to undergo treatment on the recommendation of his neurosurgeon in Singapore, Dr Ivan Ng (“Dr Ng”).252Foot Note 252×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 98.The plaintiff thus claims the cost of travel to and from Switzerland, for the entire family, the family’s foreign domestic worker and the plaintiff’s parents. 265 The total sum claimed under this head is $48,806.12, covering the following trips:253Foot Note 253×Plaintiff’s AEIC at p 1098. (a) Business class flights for the entire family and the family’s foreign domestic worker from Singapore to Budapest (transiting in Frankfurt) in March 2015. The plaintiff’s wife’s parents live in Budapest. (b) Economy class flights for the plaintiff from Budapest to Zurich (transiting in Berlin) in April 2015. (c) Economy class flights for the plaintiff’s wife from Budapest to Zurich and back to Budapest in April 2015. (d) Business class flights for the plaintiff from Zurich to Singapore (transiting in Helsinki, Stockholm and Doha) in June 2015. (e) Business class flights for the plaintiff’s wife and children and the family’s foreign domestic worker from Budapest to Singapore (transiting in Frankfurt) in June 2015. Plaintiff’s travel costs 266 I begin with the plaintiff’s travel costs. There are three relevant flights: Singapore to Budapest, Budapest to Zurich and Zurich to Singapore. 267 For his journey from Singapore to Zurich, the plaintiff first flew to Budapest and stayed there for two weeks before going on to Zurich. The defendant submits that it was not reasonable for the plaintiff to take this indirect route to Zurich.254Foot Note 254×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 423–425.The plaintiff’s reply is that he was unsure of how long he would have to spend in Zurich, and therefore it was better to stop in Budapest, where his wife’s parents live, so that the children could remain there while the plaintiff proceeded to Zurich for treatment.255Foot Note 255×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 102.Moreover, in cross-examination, the plaintiff added a further explanation: that flying from Singapore to Zurich via Budapest was in fact cheaper than flying from Singapore to Zurich directly.256Foot Note 256×Certified Transcript (14 January 2020) at p 118, lns 1–4. 268 I do not accept the plaintiff’s evidence. The plaintiff’s explanation – that he wanted his wife’s parents to look after the children while he was undergoing treatment – does not explain whythe plaintiffhad to travel to Budapest let alone why he had to remain there for twoweeks. It would have sufficed for his wife and children to have travelled to Budapest without him. Even assuming that he wanted to spend some time with his children before commencing treatment, there was no reason for his stay in Budapest to have beentwoweekslong.  It appears to me that the plaintiff found it convenient to stop in Budapest to spend time with his wife’s parents before travelling to Zurich for treatment. That means that his two-week stop in Budapest was for reasons unrelated to his treatment and therefore unrelated to the injuries he suffered in the accident. The plaintiff is entitled to recover only the cost of flying direct from Singapore to Zurich. 269 The plaintiff submits in response that it was in fact cheaper for him to fly from Singapore to Zurich through Budapest than for him to fly direct from Singapore to Zurich. I do not accept this submission. The plaintiff did not keep the receipt for his Singapore to Budapest flight. Instead, he submitted a screenshot from Lufthansa’s website in July 2015 showing that a one-way flexiblefirstclass flight from Singapore to Budapest was $10,231.257Foot Note 257×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 104(a).He also tenders, in a supplementary bundle of documents, screenshots from Lufthansa’s website in July 2020 showing that a one-way flexiblefirstclass flight from Singapore to Budapest and from Singapore to Zurich were $10,677 and $10,710 respectively.258Foot Note 258×Plaintiff’s Further Supplementary Bundle of Documents (“PB3”) at pp 7–10.In response, the defendant relies on a document dated January 2020 showing that the price of a non-refundable, non-changeable returnbusinessclass ticket from Singapore to Budapest is about $5,700.259Foot Note 259×Exhibit D-3; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 427. 270 The defendant argues that since the plaintiff tendered no evidence of the actual cost of the Singapore to Budapest flight, the claim is not recoverable. I do not agree. It is not disputed that the plaintiffdidtake this flight. And the defendant does not suggest that the treatment in Zurich was unrelated to the plaintiff’s accident and injuries. Further, both parties have given an estimate of what a direct flight from Singapore to Zurich would reasonably have cost. Therefore, even in the absence of evidence of theactualcost, the parties’ estimates suffice to make a finding of fact. 271 I further note that the plaintiff claims to have flownbusinessclass,260Foot Note 260×Plaintiff’s AEIC at p 1098.but has produced evidence of the cost offirst-classtickets. First class tickets are ordinarily significantly more expensive than business class tickets. I therefore do not find the plaintiff’s evidence to be of much weight (leaving aside whether the documents in the supplementary bundle of documents were properly in evidence before me). The plaintiff also criticises the defendant’s evidence for not being sufficiently contemporaneous, and for failing to consider that he needed to buy a flexible ticket, instead of non-refundable and non-changeable, because he did not know how long his treatment in Zurich would take. These are both fair criticisms, but they do not detract from the fact that the plaintiff bears the burden of proof. A flexible business class ticket from Singapore to Zurich would undoubtedly have cost more than the defendant’s estimate of $5,700. But equally undoubtedly, it would have cost less than the plaintiff’s estimate of $10,200. Since the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, I adopt the defendant’s quotation of $5,700. 272  As for the plaintiff’s Zurich to Singapore flight, the defendant accepted that the cost of this flight was $3,516,26.261Foot Note 261×Defendant’s Closing Submissions para 440.I thus allow the plaintiff a total of $9,216.26 in respect of his travel costs for this trip to Zurich and back. Travel costs of plaintiff’s wife 273 The plaintiff also claims travel costs incurred by his wife. The defendant cites the Court of Appeal’s decision inTeng Ching Sinand another v Leong Kwong Sun[1994] 1 SLR(R) 382 (“Teng Ching Sin”).262Foot Note 262×Defendant’s Closing Submissions para 442.According toTeng Ching Sin, travelling expenses incurred by a member of a plaintiff’s family are not recoverable unless the visits by or the company of the plaintiff’s family members were important elements in aiding his recovery, because the test is of “the necessity for the visits and thus the expenditure” (Teng Ching Sinat [16]). I agree with the defendant’s position on the law, which was not seriously disputed by the plaintiff. 274 The defendant accepts that it was necessary for the plaintiff’s wife to accompany him to Switzerland and back. However, the defendant argues that there is no reason for the plaintiff’s wife to fly business class, nor was there any reason for the plaintiff’s wife to travel to Zurich via Budapest.263Foot Note 263×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paras 447 and 448. 275 I agree with the defendant. First, I agree that there was no necessity for the plaintiff’s wife to fly business class to Switzerland and back. I would have been prepared to allow the plaintiff’s wife to claim business class fareshadit been necessary for her to take care of the plaintiff. However, on the evidence, the plaintiff and his wife travelled together only on one flight,ie, from Singapore to Budapest. The plaintiff travelled by himself from Budapest to Zurich and from Zurich to Singapore. I am thus not convinced that it was necessary for the plaintiff’s wife to accompany him on his flights (since she actually did not accompany him for most of his travels). It follows that there was no reason for the wife to fly business class, other than the fact that she was perhaps accustomed to this standard of travel. But this is not a good reason to make the defendant liable for the additional cost thereby incurred (seeMykytowych, Pamela Jane v V I P Hotel[2016] 4 SLR 829 at [129]). 276 Second, there was no reason connected to the plaintiff’s injuries or treatment for the plaintiff’s wife to have flown to Zurich via Budapest. It appears to me evident that the plaintiff’s wife flew to Budapest before flying to Zurich in order to entrust their children to her parents’ care.264Foot Note 264×Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions at para 218.This trip thus had little to no nexus with the plaintiff’s treatment in Zurich. I am sympathetic to the predicament faced by the plaintiff and his wife in that it would have been difficult for them to leave their children behind in Singapore and go to Zurich for treatment. However, I am not prepared to find that it wasnecessaryfor the children to go with the plaintiff and his wife, at least not without the benefit of further evidence about the arrangements which could have been made for the children’s care in Singapore or in Zurich. Moreover, I note that the wife actually stayed with the children in Budapest for the majority of the plaintiff’s treatment in Zurich. It follows that it was possible for the wife to have returned to Singapore to take care of the children after traveling with the plaintiff to Zurich. 277  I therefore am of the view that the measure of recoverable damages for the wife’s travel costs is limited to the price of economy class tickets from Singapore to Zurich and back. I am willing to give the wife the benefit of the doubt and allow a claim in respect of two flexible, one-way tickets instead of one flexible return ticket or two unchangeable one-way tickets. I note that the evidence tendered by the parties does not shed light on the price of such a ticket. However, I am not willing to accept the defendant’s position that the absence of evidence precludes recovery. Taking into account the general pricing level of economy class tickets to Europe, which I estimate to be $2,000 per sector, I allow the plaintiff to recover $4,000 in respect of his wife’s travel costs. Travel costs of plaintiff’s children and family maid 278 The defendant resists the claim for the children’s and the family’s foreign domestic worker travel costs, arguing that it was not necessary for the plaintiff’s children and the family’s foreign domestic worker to have travelled with the plaintiff. 279 I agree with the defendant. It appears to me evident that the plaintiff’s children and the family’s foreign domestic worker did not travel for a reason connected to the plaintiff’s injuries or his treatment. Instead, the children and the maid travelled to Budapest because the plaintiff and his wife did not want to leave the children behind in Singapore. As I have explained in [276] above, while I am sympathetic to the plaintiff’s predicament, I am not satisfied that this wasnecessary, in the absence of evidence about the care that the children would have received had they stayed in Singapore, and in light of the fact that the wife did not stay with the plaintiff for the majority of his treatment in Zurich, staying with the children in Budapest instead. Travel costs of the plaintiff’s parents 280 The plaintiff’s father visited him twice within three months of the accident. The first visit was when the plaintiff was still in a coma. The second visit was when the plaintiff was undergoing rehabilitation at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The plaintiff’s mother accompanied the plaintiff’s father on the first visit. 281 The defendant resists the plaintiff’s claim on the ground that there is no objective evidence to show that the parents’ presence assisted with the plaintiff’s recovery.265Foot Note 265×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paras 474–475.The defendant characterises as self-serving the plaintiff’s statement of subjective belief that he needed to be around his loved ones to recuperate. 282 The arguments raised by the parties in this regard elides a key consideration, that is, whether these tickets were paid for by theplaintiff. As stated above (at [253]), the plaintiff can only seek to recoverhis own lossin these proceedings. Therefore, the plaintiff must first show thathewas the one who paid for his parents’ trips, before he can even begin to argue that the trips were necessary. This is because the plaintiff bears the burden of proof. And since this is an item of special damage, and therefore a historical and actual loss, he bears the burden of proof on the usual balance of probabilities. The evidence as tendered by the plaintiff does not showwhopaid for his parents’ tickets.266Foot Note 266×Plaintiff’s AEIC (19 November 2019) at pp 1124–1126.It follows that the plaintiff did not show that the costs of the plane tickets werehisown loss. This head of claim cannot be allowed. Summary 283 In summary, the total of the plaintiff’s claim for the costs of travel to Switzerland is $9,216.26 + $4,000 = $13,216.26.",
        "Costs of cancelling flights booked before the accident": "284 The plaintiff also claims the costs of the flights which he had booked before his accident to visit his parents and for personal leisure, which he had to cancel as a result of his accident. The costs of these flights, which were all first-class flights, was estimated by the plaintiff to be $53,029.10.267Foot Note 267×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 111.The plaintiff had to estimate these costs because he was unable to retrieve most of the booking documents for the flights, having booked the flights some months before the accident. His estimate came from a software known as “ITA Matrix”, which purportedly “allows users to search for flights using historical data”.268Foot Note 268×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 112. 285 The defendant resists this head of claim. According to him, this claim is too remote. Even if it is not too remote, it is not sufficiently proven. The defendant takes issue with the plaintiff’s lack of documentary evidence, which goes both to the amount of money spent by the plaintiff on the tickets and also to whether the plaintiff had made reasonable efforts to mitigate his loss by cancelling these flights and obtaining a full or partial refund. Further, the defendant also argues that he should only be liable for the costs of economy class, and not first-class tickets. 286 I accept that this head of claim is not too remote. The test for remoteness in the tort of negligence is the same as that in the law of contract,ie, that of reasonable foreseeability (seeMcGregorat para 8-086,Man Mohan Singh s/o Jothirambal Singh and another v Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd (now known as QBE Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd) and another and another appeal[2008] 3 SLR(R) 735 at [45]). It is difficult to see why the plaintiff’s loss arising from having to cancel booked flights is not reasonably foreseeable. It is no defence for the defendant to say that he did not know that the plaintiff was someone who had booked multiple flights on business and first class that he would have to cancel.269Foot Note 269×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 479.I find it sufficient to refer to Scrutton LJ’s well-knowndictuminThe Arpad[1934] P 189 at 202–203, approved by the Privy Council inOverseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd,The Wagon Mound[1961] AC 388: You negligently run down a shabby-looking man in the street, and the turns out to be a millionaire engaged in a very profitable business which the accident disables him from carrying on; or you negligently and ignorantly injure the favourite for the Derby whereby he cannot run. You have to pay damages resulting from the circumstances of which you haveno notice. You have to pay the actual loss to the man …at the time of the tort. [emphasis added] 287 However, I agree with the defendant that the plaintiff has not discharged his burden of proving this head of claim. My concern lies specifically with the plaintiff’s failure to adduce evidence of the terms and conditions of the contracts pursuant to which he purchased the flight tickets. Specifically, the issue here relates to the plaintiff’s so-called “duty” to mitigate. It is not uncommon for ticket vendors to allow refunds, particularly on grounds of supervening events such as accident. It is also not uncommon for air tickets purchased with credit cards to be covered by insurance. In such a situation, the plaintiff would need to show either that there were no refunds available, or that he could not have availed himself of the refunds in spite of reasonable efforts. In the absence of any evidence to this regard, I find that the plaintiff has not discharged his burden of proof. The costs of cancelling these flights are not recoverable.",
        "The final award": "288 The plaintiff’s total award for special damages is therefore: S/NClaimQuantum ($)Agreed items1Medical expenses incurred in Switzerland161,534.832Professional nursing costs for the period between December 2014 and December 201511,920.003Costs of hiring second caregiver28,000.004Loss of bicycle5,250.005Replacement of cycling gear and equipment1,200.00Disputed items6Medical expenses in Singapore412,738.967Past transport expenses9,1808Costs of travel to Switzerland13,216.26Total643,040.05",
        "Conclusion": "289 In conclusion, having assessed the plaintiff’s general and special damages on the evidence which the parties have placed before me and in light of their oral and written submissions, I find that the defendant is liable to the plaintiff in the following sums: S/NClaimQuantum ($)1Loss of future income9,325,5412Recurring future medical expenses1,094,2123One-off future medical expenses694,4224Plaintiff’s pretrial loss of earnings1,543,9685Plaintiff’s wife’s pretrial loss of earnings59,0006Special damages643,040.057Pain and suffering300,000Total13,660,183.05 290 I thus assess the damages payable by the defendant to the plaintiff to be the sum of$13,660,183.05and award that sum to the plaintiff. The defendant has made interim payments to the plaintiff totalling $3,100,000 (see above at [5]). Those interim payments are to be brought into account against this award. The sum which remains due from the defendant to the plaintiff by way of damages is therefore$10,560,183.05. 291 This assessment leaves only three questions to be determined: (i) the quantum of Goods and Services Tax payable on the plaintiff’s future expenses; (ii) the interest payable on the damages awarded to the plaintiff; and (iii) the costs of this action. The interest payable to the plaintiff will, of course, have to take into account the reduction effected in the principal by each interim payment from the date of that payment. The parties have asked for an opportunity to come to an agreement on the first two questions.270Foot Note 270×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at para 199.I will allow them that opportunity, and also an opportunity to come to an agreement on the third question. 292 If the parties are unable to come to an agreement on any one or more of these three questions, I now give them liberty to apply for me to make a determination on those questions.
