Such Certificate shall be supported by documents showing the Architect’s\n\n  final measurement and valuation of the Works in accordance with all the terms of the\n\n  Contract, and after setting out and allowing for all payments or other expenditure of the\n\n  Employer or any permitted deductions by him shall state any final balance due from the\n\n  Employer to the Contractor or from the Contractor to the Employer, as the case may be,\n\n  which shall thereupon become a debt due. Such certificate shall also take account\n\n  expressly of any outstanding permitted deductions not yet made by the Employer under the\n\n  terms of Contract whether by way of liquidated damages or otherwise (unless the Employer\n\n  shall inform the Architect of his decision to forego or postpone his right to the same).…Effect of Architect’s Certificates31.(11) No certificate of the Architect under this Contract shall\n\n  be final and binding in any dispute between the Employer and the Contractor, whether\n\n  before an arbitrator or in the Courts, save only that, in the absence of fraud or improper\n\n  pressure or interference by either party, full effect by way of Summary Judgment or\n\n  Interim Award or otherwise shall, in the absence of express provision, be given to all\n\n  decisions and certificates of the Architect (other than a Cost of Termination Certificate\n\n  or Termination Delay Certificate under clause 32(8) of these Conditions), whether for\n\n  payment or otherwise, until final judgment or award, as the case may be, and until such\n\n  final judgment or award such decision or certificates shall (save as aforesaid and subject\n\n  to sub-clause (4) of this Condition) be binding on the Employer and the Contractor in\n\n  relation to any manner which, under the terms of the Contract, the Architect has as a fact\n\n  taken into account or allowed or disallowed, or any disputed matter upon which under the\n\n  terms of the Contract he has as a fact ruled, in his certificates or otherwise. The\n\n  Architect shall in all matters certify strictly in accordance with the terms of the\n\n  Contract. In any case of doubt the Architect shall, at the request of either party, state\n\n  in writing within 28 days whether he has as a fact taken into account of or allowed or\n\n  disallowed or ruled upon any matter in his certificates, if so identifying any certificate\n\n  and indicating the amount (if any) taken into account or allowed or disallowed, or the\n\n  nature of any ruling made by him, as the case may be.’19.    Although cl 31(11) refers to cl 31(4), the latter\n\nis not relevant for present purposes.20.    Clause 1(7) of the Conditions of Contract states:‘Remedy on Non-Compliance by Contractor1. (7) If within 7 days after receipt of a written notice from the\n\n  Architect requiring the Contractor to comply with a written direction or instruction the\n\n  Contractor fails to do so, the Employer may employ other contractors to do so under the\n\n  supervision of the Architect and may upon the certificate of the Architect deduct the\n\n  extra cost (if any) of doing so from any monies otherwise due under the contract or\n\n  recover the same from the Contractor. Such certificate shall be called a \"Certificate\n\n  of Cost of Other Contractor’s Work\", and any such deduction shall be recorded by\n\n  the Architect in subsequent payment certificates under clause 31 of the Conditions\n\n  provided that no extra cost shall be deducted under this clause in the case of an\n\n  unjustified direction or one which should have been expressed as an instruction.’21.    I will refer to a certificate under cl 1(7) as a\n\n‘Certificate of COCW’.",
        "Submissions": "22.    Plaintiffs’ Counsel submitted that the court\n\nshould consider not only the balance amount that is stated to be due under Certificate No\n\n16. He submitted that the amount really due to the Plaintiffs was the value of the work\n\nexecuted i.e. $8,383,721.49. This was the sum which the Plaintiffs were entitled to be\n\npaid under Certificate No 16 subject to any valid deductions being made therefrom. He then\n\nproceeded to argue that the deduction of $342,350 was not validly made.23.    I did not agree with this approach.24.    If Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s submission was\n\nvalid, this would mean that there are two sums due to the Plaintiffs under Certificate No\n\n16. The first is the total value of the works i.e. $8,383,721.49 and the second is the\n\nbalance due i.e. $199,406.70.25.    There is only one sum due to the Plaintiffs under\n\nCertificate No 16 i.e. $199,406.70. This is stated twice in Certificate No 16. Firstly,\n\nnear the top it states:‘We hereby certify that under the terms of the Building Contract the\n\n      sum of DollarONE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE THOUSAND, FOUR HUNDRED SIX AND CENTS SEVENTY\n\n      ONLYis now due toM/s L & W CONSTRUCTION PTE LTD of 36, Senoko Road, Woodlands\n\n      East Industrial Estate for work done and materials supplied up to January 2000’$199,406.7026.    Secondly, it states near the bottom:‘Amount Due$ 199,406.70’27.    For the purpose of cl 31(11) of the Conditions of\n\nContract, this is prima facie the sum for which full effect is to be given to by way of\n\nsummary judgment.28.    To get around this, Plaintiffs’ Counsel\n\nsubmitted that the Architect was wrong in including the cost of rectifying defective work\n\nin Certificate No 16 without a Certificate of COCW under cl 1(7) of the Conditions of\n\nContract.29.    Plaintiffs’ Counsel relied primarily on the\n\njudgment of the Court of Appeal inLojan Properties Pte Ltd v Tropicon Contractors Pte\n\nLtd[1991] 2 MLJ 70(‘Lojan Properties’).30.    The Conditions of Contract inLojan Propertiesare, for present purposes, similar to those in the present case before me.31.    Before coming to the judgment of the Court of\n\nAppeal inLojan Properties, it would be appropriate to consider the judgment of the\n\nHigh Court in that case as reported in[1989] 3 MLJ 216as it sets out the background\n\nfacts in some detail.32.    I quote from the bottom of p 217 to 218 of the\n\nreport of the judgment of the High Court:‘… The architects had issued altogether 28 interim\n\n  certificates serially numbered 1 to 28, since the commencement of the works up to January\n\n  1987, and the defendants had paid the first 16 interim certificates leaving the remaining\n\n  12 certificates, namely, Nos 17 to 28, unpaid. Ten of these certificates, nos 17 to 26,\n\n  were issued during the period between 19 September 1984 and 27 September 1985; certificate\n\n  no 27 was issued on 15 December 1986 and certificate no 28, expressed as ‘pre-final\n\n  certificate’, was issued on 16 January 1987. The total amount due under these 12\n\n  certificates was $1,931,294.32; but a sum of $146,000 was paid to account, leaving the\n\n  balance of $1,785,294.32. Between June and July 1987 a series of meetings were held\n\n  between the plaintiffs’ and the defendants’ representatives with a view to\n\n  resolving the settlement of the outstanding sum owing by the defendants to the plaintiffs\n\n  under the contract. Unfortunately, these were not successful, and no further payment was\n\n  made. On 9 September 1987 the plaintiffs instituted these proceedings against the\n\n  defendants claiming the sum of $1,785,294.32 and interest thereon.After the writ had been served on the defendants, they took out an\n\n  application for a stay of all further proceedings under s 7 of the Arbitration Act (Cap\n\n  10) on the ground that the plaintiffs and the defendants have, by cl 37(1) of the\n\n  conditions of contract, agreed to refer to arbitration the matters in respect of which the\n\n  action was commenced. At or about the same time, the plaintiffs took out an application\n\n  under O 14 for summary judgment against the defendants for the amount claimed. While both\n\n  applications were pending, the defendants on 24 November 1987 wrote to the architects\n\n  expressing doubts as to whether the latter had taken the following matters into account in\n\n  issuing their certificates, namely:(a) as regards interim payment certificates the fact that not all work\n\n    included in those certificates had been carried out (see cl 31(2)(a));(b) as regards extension of time certificates whether the contractor\n\n    has on every occasion complied with the condition precedent required in cl 23(2);and suggested that if those matters had not been taken into account the\n\n  architects should take action pursuant to cl 31(4) of the conditions of contract.\n\n  Prompted, no doubt, by the defendants’ letter, the architects did several things.\n\n  First, they wrote to the plaintiffs a letter dated 2 December 1987 as follows:Pursuant to cl 23(3) of the conditions of contract, we hereby notify\n\n    you that in respect of matters notified by you pursuant to your obligation under cl 23(2)\n\n    we have decided that the contract completion date be extended by 17 days to 31 May 1984.\n\n    This extension is for piling works which is the only matter in respect of which you have\n\n    given a requisite notice pursuant to cl 23(2).The extension of time granted by us earlier contained in our letters\n\n    dated 21 September 1983, 27 October 1983, 16 May 1984 and 6 March 1985 were null and void\n\n    in that you had not complied with the condition precedent set out in cl 23(2).Contemporaneously with this letter, the architects pursuant to cl 24(1)\n\n  of the conditions of contract issued to the plaintiffs a delay certificate certifying that\n\n  as at 31 May 1984: (i) the ‘contract completion date’ was 14 May 1984, (ii) the\n\n  total period of extension of time was 17 days, and (iii) the consequential ‘extended\n\n  contract completion date’ was 31 May 1984, and certifying also that the plaintiffs\n\n  were in default in not having completed the works by 31 May 1984. Secondly, the architects\n\n  on 15 December 1987 issued 17 revised certificates, nos 12A to 28A, intending to replace\n\n  the original interim certificates bearing corresponding numbers respectively, and one\n\n  further interim certificate, no 29. Immediately following the issue of these certificates,\n\n  the architects on 16 December 1987 issued: (i) a certificate pursuant to cl 1(7) of the\n\n  conditions of contract certifying that the plaintiffs having failed to comply with the\n\n  notices from the architects dated 24 July 1985 and 14 July 1986, the defendants as the\n\n  employer had engaged others to carry out the work under the architects’ supervision\n\n  and that the defendants might deduct the extra costs of doing this work from any moneys\n\n  otherwise due under the contract or recover the same from the plaintiffs, and (ii) a\n\n  certificate pursuant to cl 30(2) of the conditions of contract certifying that the\n\n  plaintiffs had failed to make payment as required by cl 30(1) of the sum of $137,493 due\n\n  from them to sub-contractors and further certifying that by reason of such failure the\n\n  defendants were entitled to pay the said sum to the sub-contractors and following such\n\n  payment to deduct the sum from any sum certified by the architects to be due to the\n\n  plaintiffs.’33.    The power of the architects there to issue\n\nfurther interim certificates was found in cl 31(4) of the conditions of contract.34.    The High Court found that the basis of the\n\nrevision of the interim certificates was not stated in the revised certificates but in a\n\nletter from the architects to the developers.35.    Furthermore, in none of the revised interim\n\ncertificates were the valuation dates given.36.    Thirdly, the revised interim certificates\n\npurported to contain an amount of liquidated damages already deducted although such\n\ndamages were expressed to be ‘recorded’. The High Court found that the\n\nliquidated damages could only be deducted only upon the issue of a delay certificate and\n\nno such delay certificate had been issued at the time when the original interim\n\ncertificates had been issued. Accordingly, in seeking to revise the interim certificates\n\nby effectively deducting liquidated damages therein, the architects had erred.37.    As for the new interim certificate no 29, the\n\nHigh Court found that it was not validly issued for reasons which are not material to the\n\ncase before me.38.    In the circumstances, the High Court found that\n\nthe original interim certificates were valid.39.    As for the effect of cl 31(11), the High Court\n\nsaid (at p 220):‘In so far as any sum claimed by the employer is concerned, only\n\n  the amounts expressly deductible under the contract may be set off against the amount due\n\n  under the interim certificate. I therefore come to the conclusion that subject to any\n\n  deduction or set-off as provided expressly in the contract, the amounts certified in the\n\n  interim certificates are due and payable to the plaintiffs.’40.    Therefore the question there was whether the\n\ndevelopers could set-off and counterclaim various sums against the sums due under the\n\noriginal interim certificates. One of the various sums which they had sought to set-off\n\nand counterclaim was the costs of rectification works.41.    In that case, the costs of rectification works\n\ncould be claimed under cl 1(7) of the conditions of contract.42.    A Certificate of COCW had been issued by the\n\narchitects there for the sum of $381,791 as being the costs of rectification of defective\n\nworks which the plaintiffs had allegedly failed to rectify.43.    The High Court found that this raised an arguable\n\nclaim for $381,791 which, if established, was deductible from the amount due to the\n\nplaintiffs under the original interim certificates.44.    In the result, the High Court deducted the\n\n$381,791 (and another sum being the amount paid to sub-contractors) from the total of the\n\namounts due under the original interim certificates to grant summary judgment to the\n\nplaintiffs for $1,266,010.32 as follows:‘Balance of the total amount due under the 12 interim certificates,\n\n      nos 17 to 28$1,785,294.32Less(i) Costs of rectification of defective works claimed by the defendants$381,791(ii) Amount paid to nominated sub-contractors$137,493Balance$1,266,010.32’45.    As regards the High Court’s decision that\n\nthe costs of the rectification works was arguable, the Court of Appeal reversed this\n\ndecision and decided that the $381,791 should not be deducted from the total of the\n\namounts due under the original interim certificate.46.    In so doing the Court of Appeal concluded that\n\nthe Certificate of COCW in that case was not valid as it did not meet the requirements of\n\ncl 1(7) as found by the Court of Appeal. The requirements are set out at p 73 of the\n\nreport:‘The wording of this provision presents no difficulty of\n\n  construction or interpretation. Its meaning is plain and straightforward. It requires\n\n  firstly, a written notice from the architect requiring the contractor to comply with his\n\n  written direction(s) or instruction(s); secondly, there must be a failure on the part of\n\n  the contractor to comply with the architect’s written notice giving the written\n\n  direction(s) or instruction(s) for a period of seven days after the receipt of the\n\n  architect’s written notice; thirdly, and this is implicit from the wording of the\n\n  provision, the employer must employ other contractors to do the work directed or\n\n  instructed by the architect’s supervision; and fourthly, and this too is implicit\n\n  from the wording of the provision, the architect must certify that the work has been done\n\n  and must also certify the ‘extra cost’ of doing so. Then and only then can the\n\n  employer deduct the amount so certified from any moneys otherwise due to the contractor\n\n  and when so deducted the architect is required to record the deduction in any subsequent\n\n  payment certificates under clause 31 of the conditions of contract.’47.    In the present case before me, it was arguable\n\nwhether a letter dated 11 January 2000 that was alleged to be the Certificate of COCW met\n\nthe first requirement. If so, then the second requirement would also have been met.\n\nHowever it was clear that the third and fourth requirements had not been met at the time\n\nof the alleged Certificate of COCW as the Defendants had not, at that time, engaged other\n\ncontractors and, even if they had done so, the rectification works had not yet been\n\ncompleted.48.    Counsel for the Defendants argued that the third\n\nand fourth requirements were orbiter because inLojan Propertiesit was clear that\n\nthe first two requirements had not been met and hence it was not necessary to go into the\n\nthird and fourth requirements.49.    I did not agree. The Court of Appeal had laid\n\ndown the requirements for a Certificate of COCW under a similar cl 1(7) and not all of\n\nsuch requirements had been met in the present case before me.50.    At p 74 to 75 of the report, the Court of Appeal\n\nalso said:‘… The scheme of the contract is clear. As we have premised\n\n  earlier the intention clearly expressed in the contract is to exclude the right to\n\n  set-off. See the House of Lords decision inGilbert-Ash (Northern) Ltd v Modern\n\n  Engineering (Bristol) Ltd, where the right of set-off was contractually\n\n  excluded….’51.    In the present case before me, Plaintiffs’\n\nCounsel argued that as the requirements for a Certificate of COCW have also not been met,\n\nthen likewise, the sum for the rectification works should not be deducted in Certificate\n\nNo 16.52.    However, there is a material difference between\n\nthe facts inLojan Propertiesand those before me.53.    It will be recalled that inLojan Properties,\n\nthe total of the amounts due under the original interim certificates was the higher sum of\n\n$1,785,294.32. Accordingly, the onus was on the developers/defendants to establish that\n\nthe Certificate of COCW was valid in order to deduct the $381,791 from the $1,785,294.32.54.    In the present case before me, the sum due under\n\nCertificate No 16 is the lower sum of $199,406.70. The sum of $342,350 had already been\n\ndeducted in Certificate No 16 and the Defendants did not have to rely on a Certificate of\n\nCOCW to effect a deduction.55.    Accordingly, the Defendants did not have to\n\nestablish the validity of the alleged Certificate of COCW.56.    Had the sum certified to be due under Certificate\n\nNo 16 been $541,756.70 (comprising $199,406.70 and $342,350) then the Defendants would\n\nhave had to establish the validity of the alleged Certificate of COCW in order to deduct\n\n$342,350 from $541,756.70.57.    In so far as Plaintiffs’ Counsel relied also\n\nonJames Png Construction Pte Ltd v Tsu Chin Kwan Peter[1991] 1 MLJ 449, the facts\n\nthere are different from those before me. In that case, the final certificate did certify\n\nthe sum due for which the plaintiffs were claiming. The defendant there was contending\n\nthat the architect had not listed all the defects which he ought to have in the final\n\ncertificate and had contended that the final certificate was issued prematurely before the\n\nend of the defects liability period.58.    The High Court found that cl 30(6) of the\n\nconditions of contract in that case did not prohibit the issue of a final certificate\n\nbefore the end of the defects liability period but it had simply set out the latest period\n\nby which the architect was to issue his final certificate. Therefore the final certificate\n\nwas held to have been valid and the defendant there could not withhold payment thereon to\n\nthe plaintiffs.59.    The facts inKum Leng General Contractor v\n\nHytech Builders Pte Ltd[1996] 1 SLR 751are also different from those before me.\n\nThere the defendants who were the main contractors, had sought to deduct various sums from\n\npayments otherwise due to the plaintiffs, who were the sub-contractors. The deductions\n\nwere on the basis of liquidated damages for delay. However such a claim could only be made\n\non the issuance of an architect’s certificate which had not yet been issued at the\n\ntime the deductions were made. The certificate was issued about six months after the\n\ndeductions were made. In these circumstances, the court there held that the plaintiffs\n\nwere not entitled to make the deductions.60.    In the present case before me, Plaintiffs’\n\nCounsel argued that the Architect was wrong to include the estimated costs of the\n\nrectification works in Certificate No 16 because under cl 31(10)(a) the Architect had\n\nfirst to determine the final measurement and valuation and then deduct ‘all payments\n\nor other expenditure of the Employer or any permitted deductions by him’ in order to\n\narrive at the final balance due to or from the Plaintiffs.61.    According to Plaintiffs’ Counsel, the costs\n\nof the rectification works did not come within the meaning of ‘all payments …of\n\nthe Employer’ as the Defendants had not yet paid such costs.62.    Neither, he argued, did it come within the\n\nmeaning of ‘other expenditure of the Employer’ as the Defendants had not yet\n\nexpended any sum to pay for the costs of the rectification works.63.    He further submitted that the estimated costs of\n\nthe rectification works also did not come within the expression ‘permitted\n\ndeductions’ in cl 31(11) as that expression pertained only to deductions which were\n\nsupported by a valid certificate, for example, such as under cl 24(1) and (2) pertaining\n\nto a Delay Certificate and liquidated damages thereunder or under cl 1(7) pertaining to a\n\nCertificate of COCW. The authority for this proposition was again the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Appeal (as well as the judgment of the High Court) inLojan Properties.64.    I was of the view that it was arguable whether\n\nunder cl 31(10)(a), the Architect could take into account expenditure of the Defendants\n\n(leaving aside payments and permitted deductions) only if the same had been paid for and\n\nthat expenditure which the Defendants were going to incur should be ignored just because\n\nthe works had not been completed yet and they had not been paid for yet.65.    It will be recalled that prior to the date of\n\nCertificate No 16 the Architect had already awarded the rectification works to another\n\ncontractor for the sum of $342,350 even though the rectification works had not been\n\ncompleted and paid for yet.66.    Under cl 31(10)(a), an architect has only three\n\nmonths from the date of receipt of documents from the Plaintiffs, submitted pursuant to cl\n\n31(9), to issue the Final Certificate.67    .It is likely that the preparation of\n\nspecifications for rectification works, the calling of tenders, the submission of tenders,\n\nthe consideration of tenders and the award to the successful tenderer, and the subsequent\n\nexecution of the rectification works and payment thereof would often take more than the\n\nthree months mentioned in cl 31(10)(a).68.    If an architect is supposed to wait till all\n\nthese steps are completed before issuing the Final Certificate, as is implicit in\n\nPlaintiffs’ Counsel’s submission, then he is likely to be unable to meet the\n\ndeadline in cl 31(10)(a). Yet if he issues the Final Certificate within the three months,\n\nit is suggested that he must ignore the cost of the rectification works even though it has\n\nbeen ascertained, simply because such works have not been completed and paid for. I had my\n\ndoubts as to whether that would be correct.69.    Even if the submission of Plaintiffs’\n\nCounsel mentioned in paragraph 62 above was correct, the point was that the Plaintiffs\n\nwere relying on cl 31(11) to seek summary judgment.70.    It will be recalled that cl 31(11) provides that\n\npending arbitration or a (full) hearing before the courts, ‘full effect by way of\n\nSummary Judgment or Interim Award or otherwise shall, …, be given to all …\n\ncertificates of the Architect … whether for payment or otherwise … and until\n\nsuch final judgment or award such … certificates shall … be binding … in\n\nrelation to any [matter] which, under the terms of the Contract, the Architect has as a\n\nfact taken into account or allowed or disallowed ….’.71.    It is a fact that the Architect allowed a\n\ndeduction in Certificate No 16 for the costs of the rectification works.72.    The very purpose of cl 31(11) is to preclude, for\n\nthe time being, any argument as to whether the Architect had over-certified or\n\nunder-certified the sum due under the Architect’s Interim Certificates or Final\n\nCertificate. As Plaintiffs’ Counsel had stressed the sanctity of such certificates,\n\nhe could not in the next breath urge the court to go behind Certificate No 16 and grant\n\nthe Plaintiffs summary judgment for more than what was certified therein. To allow the\n\nPlaintiffs to do so would be to open the Pandora’s box.73.    In the circumstances, I was of the view that the\n\nPlaintiffs were not entitled to summary judgment for the $342,450.",
