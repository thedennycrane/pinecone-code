        "The facts": "1.        The plaintiffs and the\n\ndefendant in both suits are related; Bobby Wang (the first plaintiff) the plaintiff in\n\nSuit No. 1023 of 2000/L (the first Suit) is the cousin of the siblings Ong Kian Leong, Ong\n\nBoon Leong and Ong Seng Leong (the second plaintiffs) who are suing in Suit No. 1024 of\n\n2000/Q (the second Suit). The first and second plaintiffs are the nephews of the\n\ndefendant. The first/second plaintiffs as well as the defendant hold shares in and are\n\nalso directors of, a company called Ong Toh Property Pte Ltd (OTP) which had been started\n\nin 1986 by the late Ong Toh, who was the grandfather and father respectively, of the\n\nplaintiffs and the defendant. OTP is a holding company and its main activity is investment\n\nwith its main source of income being rental collected from various properties it owns and\n\nwhich at one time included Nos. 16 and 20 Kallang Pudding Road (the Kallang properties)\n\nand No. 11, Tannery Lane (the Tannery Lane property).2.        Ong Toh passed away on 30\n\nMarch 1995 and under his Will dated 16 September 1993, Ong Soon Huat (OSH) who is his\n\nnephew and the defendant's cousin, was appointed the sole executor of his estate. The\n\nbeneficiaries of Ong Toh's estate (the estate) are the defendant and the first plaintiff\n\nin the proportions of 80% and 20% respectively. OSH has applied for probate of the estate\n\nin Probate No. 1489 of 1995 but the grant has not yet been issued by the High Court,\n\nbecause (according to the first plaintiff and which OSH confirmed) estate duty has not yet\n\nbeen paid. Presently, OTP is in voluntary liquidation pursuant to a special resolution\n\npassed by the company on 5 February 2001. The liquidator is Chan Siew Wei (Chan) from the\n\naccounting firm of Chan Hock Seng & Co, who are the auditors of OTP.3.        The defendant is a\n\nsubstantial shareholder (60%) and chairman of another company called Long An Development\n\nPte Ltd (LAD) which at the material time was developing an office-cum residential block in\n\nBeijing, China (the China project). Ong Toh Development Pte Ltd (OTD), another company\n\nstarted by the plaintiffs' grandfather is also a shareholder (7%) of LAD while the first\n\nplaintiff himself holds approximately 12% shares in OTD. At a meeting of LAD's board in\n\nearly 1997, attended inter alia by the defendant, the first plaintiff (representing OTD\n\nand as a director of LAD) and two of his three cousins, the subject of raising urgently\n\nneeded capital for the China project was mooted. LAD’s managing-director, a Taiwanese\n\ncalled Wang Shih Chieh (Wang), suggested that the properties of OTP be used as collateral\n\nto obtain a bank loan in return for which the defendant could offer some compensation\n\npayment to other shareholders of the company; this suggestion was however not pursued.4.        Between April and July\n\n1997, the defendant approached the plaintiffs saying he wanted to utilise OTP's properties\n\nat Kallang and Tannery Lane to obtain a bank loan; he offered to pay the plaintiffs\n\ninterest at 8% per annum on the outstanding sums owed to the financial institutional for\n\nthe risk involved; the defendant also approached his uncle and the father of the second\n\nplaintiffs Ong Thiam Huat (Ong), with the same proposal. The plaintiffs did not agree as\n\nthey felt that there were great risks involved in LAD's China project and should it fail,\n\nthe lending bank would call on OTP's properties as security. The first plaintiff also felt\n\nthat the minority shareholders (holding 40%) of LAD should play their part by pledging\n\ntheir personal properties as collateral to raise loans.5.        However, at a subsequent\n\ndiscussion the first plaintiff had with two (2) other shareholders of LAD, namely Calvin\n\nTan (whom he described as the defendant's financial adviser) and Philip Kwek (who is also\n\na friend of the defendant) at the latter's house, it was intimated to the first plaintiff\n\nthat if the plaintiffs did not agree to the defendant's proposal, the defendant would use\n\nhis position as a majority shareholder to remove them as directors. Thereafter, the\n\ndefendant would pass the requisite resolution to secure approval for his proposal to use\n\nOTP's properties as security for his loan. The first plaintiff conveyed the defendant's\n\nthreat to the second plaintiffs and their father. After due consideration, they agreed it\n\nwould be difficult to fight the defendant in his capacity as the majority shareholder of\n\nOTP. The plaintiffs felt it was the lesser of two (2) evils for them to agree to the\n\ndefendant's proposal and remain as directors of OTP than, to reject the proposal and be\n\nremoved from the board and thereafter not know about or have any say in, the running of\n\nthe company as minority shareholders. Consequently, the plaintiffs agreed to the\n\ndefendant's proposal, albeit reluctantly, and informed him accordingly in July 1997; the\n\nparties arranged to meet.6.        On or about 28 July 1997\n\nthere was a meeting attended by the first plaintiff, the defendant, Ong and his two (2)\n\nsons Ong Kian Leong and Ong Seng Leong; Ong Boon Leong was absent. Prior to the\n\ndiscussion, a draft agreement (the agreement) was handed by the defendant to the first\n\nplaintiff wherein it was stated that the parties agreed to allow the defendant to borrow\n\n$16m (the loan) from the International Bank of Singapore Ltd (IBS) secured by mortgages on\n\nOTP's properties at Kallang and Tannery Lane. The first plaintiff noted therefrom that it\n\nwas not stated how the defendant's payment of 8% interest would be distributed. So he\n\nre-typed the draft which was in the form of a letter from the defendant addressed to him\n\nand the second plaintiffs (see 1AB66-67) and added (as para 5) the formula for\n\ndistribution of the 8% interest amongst the plaintiffs. Although OTP was also named in the\n\nagreement, the company was not included as a recipient of the interest. When\n\ncross-examined, the plaintiffs denied that they were the ones who had demanded 8% interest\n\nfrom the defendant. The first plaintiff said they accepted the defendant’s proposal\n\nof 8% as it was then the prevailing interest rate charged by banks.7.        Questioned by counsel for\n\nthe defendant on why OTP had been excluded from the compensation payment, the first\n\nplaintiff explained that the defendant in fact attempted to include all shareholders of\n\nthe company as recipients of the defendant's payment but the plaintiffs refused -- it\n\nwould mean that a substantial part of the compensation would indirectly return to the\n\ndefendant as he had 65% direct and beneficial interest in the company through his 80%\n\nshare of their grandfather's estate; it would be tantamount to the left hand paying the\n\nright hand. The first plaintiff pointed out that in addition to trying to include OTP as a\n\npayee of the interest for his own ultimate benefit, the defendant also attempted to renege\n\non his agreement to pay 8%; he wanted to pay a lower rate of 5-6% as interest after the\n\nplaintiffs had agreed to his proposal. This attempt was also rejected by the plaintiffs as\n\na breach of trust and principle bearing in mind that it was the defendant who initially\n\noffered, not they asked for, 8% compensation.8.        After he had re-typed the\n\nagreement, the first plaintiff printed out two (2) copies, one was handed to the defendant\n\nand the other copy was handed to the second plaintiffs, for perusal. The salient\n\nprovisions of the agreement are as follows:(a) the defendant would repay the loan in three (3) years or less at\n\n    his option;(b) the defendant would be responsible for the payment of interest to\n\n    IBS which prevailing rate was then 6.5% per annum on the amount of the drawdown;(c) the defendant would compensate the plaintiffs opportunity cost at\n\n    8% per annum monthly, on the outstanding principal amount owing to IBS;(d) if for any reason the defendant failed to pay any part of the loan\n\n    when due to IBS, he agreed that a portion of his shares bequeathed to him by the estate\n\n    should be distributed to all the shareholders of OTP (in proportion to their\n\n    shareholdings) of the company (including himself) using the formula prepared by the first\n\n    plaintiff and set out in para 5 of the agreement.9.        After everyone present had\n\nagreed to the terms, the defendant signed one copy of the agreement but did not date it.\n\nThe first plaintiff put the signed copy into an envelope, sealed it and kept it at his\n\noffice; it was understood that the envelope would not be opened unless and until the\n\ndefendant defaulted in his payments of the 8% interest.10.        After the agreement had\n\nbeen signed, the first plaintiff reminded the defendant to inform OSH as a matter of\n\ncourtesy, in the light of provision (d) in the agreement set out in para 8 above. The\n\ndefendant did so inform OSH by his letter dated 15 October 1997 (see 1AB97) addressed to\n\nOSH as the executor of the estate of Ong Toh deceased and which was witnessed by a\n\nsolicitor (Peter Sim); the letter stated:I, Ong Heng Huat, irrevocably instruct you to comply\n\n    with the provisions relating to the transfer of my interests in theestate of Ong Toh\n\n    deceasedas contained in my letter to the shareholders of Ong Toh Property Pte Ltd\n\n    dated 20 August 1997.11.        By a letter dated 7\n\nAugust 1997, IBS offered the defendant overdraft facilities of $16m which offer the\n\ndefendant accepted on 15 August 1997. On the same day, OTP wrote (letter was signed by the\n\nfirst plaintiff and the defendant) to IBS forwarding a certified copy of OTP's special\n\nresolution passed on 23 July 1997, sanctioning the mortgage of the company's Kallang and\n\nTannery Lane properties to secure the bank's facility offered to the defendant. This was\n\nfollowed by another resolution of the company passed on 2 September 1997 (signed by the\n\nplaintiffs and the defendant but not OSH on behalf of the estate) approving the affixing\n\nof the company's Common Seal to the mortgage and all other relevant documents, pursuant to\n\nthe earlier special resolution.12.        Sometime in July 1998,\n\nthe defendant informed the plaintiffs that the banking facilities had been revised by IBS\n\n-- part of the overdraft facility was converted to a term loan. Consequently, OTP passed a\n\nfresh resolution on 28 July 1998 to approve the facilities set out in the revised letter\n\nof offer dated 16 July from IBS and, to confirm that the company's Kallang and Tannery\n\nLane properties would continue to be security for the revised facilities. The company\n\nwrote to IBS on the same day forwarding the aforesaid resolution.13.        The defendant paid the\n\nagreed 8% interest to the plaintiffs between 31 August 1997 and 31 March 1999. Initially,\n\nthe defendant provided the first plaintiff with copies of the monthly statements of IBS.\n\nThe practice was for the first plaintiff to contact the defendant's personal assistant\n\nDanny Chng (Danny) to remind the defendant followed by the first plaintiff's sending to\n\nDanny a spreadsheet setting out the plaintiffs' computation of the interest payable.\n\nSometimes Danny would revert over slight differences between the first plaintiff's and\n\nDanny's calculations. The defendant would then ask the first plaintiff to meet him to\n\ncollect the sum. Payment was always made in cash at the first plaintiff's request; he was\n\nresponsible for collecting and paying to his three (3) cousins their share and he wanted\n\nto avoid issuing several cheques every month. The defendant was always if not perpetually,\n\nlate in payment, particularly from 1998 onwards.14.        The first plaintiff\n\ndenied he had hounded the defendant for payment as the latter had alleged in his written\n\ntestimony. When the defendant repeatedly told the first plaintiff he could no longer\n\nafford to pay the interest, the first plaintiff advised his cousins (in June-July 1999) to\n\ngive the defendant some breathing space, until the defendant could sell the China project.\n\nIn fact, the plaintiffs completely stopped asking the defendant for payment until October\n\n2000, when completion of the sale of OTP's three (3) properties was near.15.        Although the only purpose\n\nof the loan was to finance the China project, monies drawn-down never went into that\n\nproject. The first plaintiff alleged that the defendant wired $933,000 from the loan\n\nmonies to Australia and gave another $500,000 to Tay Teck Huat (a shareholder of LAD).\n\nThis was not only not denied by the defendant but he went further to admit that he may\n\nalso have advanced $150,000 (see N/E105) to the girlfriend of or another, shareholder (Lee\n\nChoon Sing) of LAD, from the loan. The first plaintiff testified he had insisted that so\n\nlong as the accounts of the China project were controlled by Wang (whom he accused of\n\nsiphoning funds out of LAD), not one cent should be remitted to China. Although the first\n\nplaintiff expressed his concerns to the defendant and Calvin Tan and there were heated\n\narguments over the matter, the latter continued to send millions to China. However, the\n\nfirst plaintiff managed to garner enough support to remove Wang as general manager and\n\nchairman of LAD's Beijing office, for which he received a death threat from Wang. On 18\n\nMarch 1998, shortly after he had returned from removing Wang from the Beijing office, the\n\nfirst plaintiff decided he had had enough; he tendered his resignation as director and\n\nmanaging-director of LAD.16.        Cross-examined why the\n\nplaintiffs did not disclose the agreement and compensation in their position as directors\n\nof OTP, the first plaintiff countered, who should he/they make the disclosure to? All\n\ndirectors of the board of OTP had agreed it was a private arrangement between\n\nshareholders. Moreover, the shareholders (save for OSH) were also directors of the\n\ncompany. Further, OSH had been notified of the agreement by the defendant's letter dated\n\n15 October 1997 and, OSH was not a beneficial owner but trustee (for the defendant and the\n\nfirst plaintiff), of the shares he held in OTP. When he testified, OSH (DW4) confirmed\n\nthat he had indeed been so notified.17.        Peter Sim was directed by\n\nthe court to testify. His testimony however, proved to be singularly unhelpful. He (CW1)\n\nsaid he did not draft the agreement as the first plaintiff had asserted. He vaguely\n\nremembered (N/E76) having been shown the document by Calvin Tan (who consulted him on a\n\nfriendly basis) but not when, nor having told the latter that \"it is a very messy\n\nsituation\" and \"no lawyer will go near the agreement with a 10 foot\n\npole\". However, he did recall that he had declined to act because he noted that\n\nthe agreement involved probate . Peter Sim also recalled that at a later date when the\n\ndefendant came to his office with Calvin Tan, he had asked the defendant whether the\n\nlatter understood the contents before he witnessed the defendant's signing of the letter\n\ndated 15 October 1997. He was told that the defendant’s cousin Bobby wanted the\n\nletter witnessed by a lawyer and he obliged.18.        Repayment to IBS of the\n\nloan was due in June 2000. When the plaintiffs and Ong met up with the defendant to\n\ndiscuss repayment, he said he had no money. The plaintiffs and Ong then suggested that the\n\nonly solution was to sell the company's properties to pay off the loan. The defendant\n\nagreed and signed a company resolution approving the sale, contradicting his written\n\ntestimony that he was shocked when the first plaintiff told him that the latter had signed\n\nan agreement for sale and purchase with the buyer.19.        OTP's properties were put\n\nup for sale. The Kallang and Tannery Lane properties were valued at $27m (by valuers CB\n\nRichard Ellis (Pte) Ltd) as at 31 May 2000, but were sold for $33.5m in July 2000, out of\n\nwhich $16,388,000 went to repayment of the loan. The two (2) figures were a far cry from\n\nan earlier valuation done in September 1997 at the behest of IBS which gave a market value\n\nand a forced sale value of $51m and $45.9m respectively, for the properties. Previously\n\n(August 1995), another firm of valuers had assessed the three (3) properties as having a\n\nland value of $50,733,469 (see 1AB51) as part of a feasibility study for redevelopment\n\ncommissioned by OTD. Even on the sale, the plaintiffs had complaints against the\n\ndefendant. The first plaintiff testified that the defendant kept holding back the sale by\n\nsaying he had better offers which never materialised. This resulted in OTP losing an offer\n\nof $33.5m for two (2) of the three (3) properties, when the prospective buyer through his\n\nsolicitors withdrew his offer (on 4 July 2000 at 1AB335), due to the company's delay in\n\ngranting an option.20.        After the sale was\n\ncompleted, the plaintiffs demanded but the defendant refused, to pay the $16,388,000 owed\n\nto OTP. The defendant complained he had been penalised in paying interest to IBS and also\n\nin the monthly interest payments he made to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs proposed that\n\nthe sum of $16,388,000 be treated as a director's loan to the defendant; they also asked\n\nfor directors' loans to themselves from the balance sale proceeds of the properties,\n\narguing that they were entitled to the same benefits from the company as the defendant.\n\nThe defendant countered that in that case, the plaintiffs should also compensate him with\n\ninterest payment.21.        In October 2000, the\n\nfirst plaintiff discovered that the defendant had approached OSH in an attempt to obtain a\n\ntransfer to himself (the defendant) of the estate's shares in OTP. The first plaintiff\n\nconsidered the defendant's act as a clear breach of para 7 of the agreement (set out in\n\npara 8(d) above). The second plaintiffs were accordingly informed and the plaintiffs\n\ndecided to enforce the agreement. The sealed envelope containing the agreement was opened,\n\nthe first plaintiff inserted the date 28 July 1997 into the agreement and subsequently\n\nthese proceedings were commenced.",
        "The pleadings": "(i)        the claim22.        In their respective\n\nstatements of claim, the first and second plaintiffs claimed their share of the 8%\n\ninterest based on the outstanding principal amount owed to IBS between 1 April 1999 and 25\n\nOctober 2000, of $1,596,947.94. The first plaintiff claimed $910,260.33 as his share of\n\ninterest while the second plaintiffs claimed the difference of $686,687.61 ($1,596,947.94\n\nless $910,260.33). Neither the plaintiffs nor the defendant disputed that the latter had\n\npreviously paid the plaintiffs $1,306,294.75 by way of interest between 31 August 1997 and\n\n31 March 1999.",
        "(ii)        the defence": "23.        The defendant's somewhat\n\nconvoluted defences to the plaintiffs' claims were as follows:-(i) taking into account his 65% beneficial interest in OTP via his\n\n    inheritance in the estate, the defendant calculated that in or about July 1997, his 65%\n\n    interest based on the then value ($51m) of the three (3) properties was worth $33m.\n\n    Therefore it was well within his rights to borrow $16m using the properties as security;(ii) the plaintiffs gave no consideration for the loan of $16m from\n\n    IBS;(iii) he denied he had entered into the agreement with the plaintiffs;(iv) the agreement was in any event illegal and unenforceable as:(a) it wasultra viresthe memorandum and articles of\n\n      association of OTP;(b)    the plaintiffs who were directors of OTP had failed to disclose\n\n      their interests under the agreement when approving and passing the resolution;(c) the plaintiffs as directors of OTP had also failed to obtain the\n\n      approval of and suppressed from the company the fact of, the direct pecuniary benefit they\n\n      obtained under the agreement;(d) no company resolution was passed by OTP to approve the pecuniary\n\n      benefit the plaintiffs obtained under the agreement;(e) the plaintiffs breached their fiduciary duties to OTP;(f) the agreement was contrary to public policy as it was calculated to\n\n      be concealed from and to deceive, the tax authorities of Singapore;(g) the agreement offended the provisions of the Moneylender's Act Cap\n\n      188.(v) in the alternative, the defendant relied on ss 156 and 157 of the\n\n    Companies Act Cap 50.The evidence24.        At the commencement of\n\nthe trial, I had informed counsel for the defendant that the defences of illegality\n\nrelating to the alleged tax evasion by the plaintiffs and their alleged breach of\n\nfiduciary duties as directors, were no answer to the plaintiffs' claim. These defences\n\nwere unsustainable as the plaintiffs’ claim was based on contract and the company\n\n(OTP) was not a party to the action. Further, it was a matter between the tax authorities\n\nand the plaintiffs whether the interest the latter received from the defendant should be\n\nconsidered taxable income but, the fact they may have failed to declare the amount as\n\nincome did not afford the defendant a valid defence to the plaintiffs’ claim. Despite\n\nmy direction and despite his concession that OTP was not a party to this litigation,\n\ncounsel persisted in cross-examining the plaintiffs on both issues. He relied onMiller\n\nv Karlinski(1945) 62 TLR 85 as well asNapier v National Bus Agency Ltd[1951] 2 All ER 264 as authority for doing so. I disagreed, for reasons which I shall set\n\nout later.",
        "The defendant’s case": "25.        I have in paras 1 to 21\n\nabove, set out the salient facts according to the first plaintiff's testimony, which was\n\nconfirmed by his cousins and their father Ong. I turn now to the defendant’s\n\nevidence. Cross-examined, the defendant (who is only 2 years older than the first\n\nplaintiff) admitted (N/E126) that the reason he did not pay his nephews was because he\n\nfelt it was ‘not fair’ as he had paid interest to IBS in addition to paying the\n\nplaintiffs. However, this assertion was not quite correct as IBS was paid $16,388,000 from\n\nthe sale proceeds of OTP's properties; this meant that the defendant had defaulted in\n\npayment of $388,000 by way of interest and, he was in arrears for more than the 2-3 months\n\nthat he claimed. Further, the defendant admitted owing OTP another $6.4m as\n\ndirector’s loan.26.        The defendant also\n\nrevealed that after Calvin Tan had sourced out IBS as a willing lender, he decided he\n\nwould borrow $16m even though only US$7m (then equivalent to S$10-$11m) was actually\n\nneeded for the China project. This was because he had to make provision for interest ($6m)\n\nfor the duration of the loan (2-3 years). The figure was $16m because Calvin Tan had\n\nworked out that he could borrow 50% of his 65% entitlement in OTP, which was equivalent to\n\n$33m based on a valuation of $50m as the company's assets. About $5m of the loan was\n\nutilised by the defendant for purposes not related to the China project -- part of it was\n\nused to pay the plaintiffs, $1m went into his Australia investment and he lent Tan Teck\n\nHuat $500,000. Although he was repaid what he lent to Tan Teck Huat (by instalments up to\n\nlast year), the defendant admitted that he did not use the repayments either to pay the\n\nplaintiffs or IBS -- he used the sums for 'expenses for the company' presumably LAD.27.        The impression I gained\n\nof the defendant was, that he was incredibly nave; he can hardly be described as a\n\nhard-nosed businessman. In actual fact, he was extremely generous to his friends and\n\nfellow investors. My observations were based on the following evidence adduced from him\n\nand or Calvin Tan (DW3):a. on Wang's advice (N/E 96), he had remitted S$2m as ‘tea\n\n    money’ to Chinese authorities so as to be able to invest in the China project; the\n\n    cheque (dated 28 January 1995) was drawn on a joint bank account he maintained with his\n\n    father (while the latter was still alive). The defendant did not question the propriety of\n\n    the payment nor who would be the ultimate recipient. He testified that the payment was\n\n    supposedly to show that LAD had the financial means to invest in the China project and was\n\n    meant to be refunded. Yet he deposited it into Wang's Beijing bank account without\n\n    question. It is doubtful that the late Ong Toh knew of the payment as the defendant\n\n    claimed since, according to OSH, when the defendant was questioned on the cheque by the\n\n    estate's solicitors, he did not mention that Ong Toh knew;b. even more surprising, although Lee Choon Sing (his co-founder of\n\n    LAD) and Wang were the original investors in the China project, the defendant did not\n\n    think of asking either of them to contribute their share of capital after he had deposited\n\n    S$2m into Wang’s account; Wang (although 15-20% shareholder) merely paid LAD’s\n\n    expenses (which amount he could not even remember) while Lee paid nothing;c. notwithstanding that there were minority shareholders (holding 40%\n\n    shares) in LAD including Calvin Tan, the defendant did not insist that they do their part\n\n    to help raise funds for the China project. Neither did he insist that they sign a\n\n    back-to-back guarantee in his favour (although they had apparently agreed to do so,\n\n    according to the first plaintiff and Calvin Tan) after he had secured the loan. Although\n\n    Calvin Tan testified (N/E 140) that he had obtained from his office (Millennium\n\n    Securities) and handed to the first plaintiff/the China project investors a standard form\n\n    of guarantee (see 1AB163-166), the foolish defendant did not press any of his fellow\n\n    shareholders to sign the document, thereby shouldering alone, the financing burden for the\n\n    China project.28.        I also found that the\n\ndefendant adopted a cavalier attitude towards his debts. Even if he was not instigated by\n\nCalvin Tan to do so (which I believed he was) he had borrowed $16m from IBS using OTP's\n\nproperties as collateral in the mistaken (and simplistic) belief that this was (less than)\n\nhis ultimate entitlement, based on his direct and beneficial interest (65%) in the\n\ncompany. However, he did not seem to have given much or indeed any thought, to how he\n\nwould repay what he borrowed from the company, which ultimately ballooned to $22,788,000.\n\nEven when he had the means to do so (one example being the repayment of $500,000 by Tan\n\nTeck Huat) the defendant failed to service the loan and or pay his nephews.29.        I turn next to the\n\ntestimony adduced from the defendant's witnesses, starting with Calvin Tan (DW2), whom I\n\nfound to be a far shrewder businessman than the defendant. Calvin Tan (who is both a\n\nstockbroker and cigar merchant) testified that he himself had invested close to $900,000\n\nfor his 5% share in the China project; he purchased it from an investor who held 30%\n\nshare, after the defendant had invested. Calvin Tan could not recall having calculated the\n\ndefendant’s interest in OTP and which computation of $33m prompted the defendant to\n\nborrow 50% thereof ($16m) from IBS. Neither could he remember making the suggestion that\n\nthe defendant should borrow enough to cover the interest element as well. However, he\n\nadmitted that the other shareholders were reluctant to put more capital into the China\n\nproject and they had all agreed that the defendant should look for alternative financing.\n\nI had no doubt that Calvin Tan was less than candid in his testimony and I believe he\n\ndeliberately played down his role as the defendant’s financial adviser. I am certain\n\nhe was instrumental in suggesting to the defendant the possibility of removing the\n\nplaintiffs from the board of OTP, if the defendant was not allowed to have his way. Quite\n\nsimply, the defendant was not the sort who was capable of coming up with such a threat on\n\nhis own initiative.30.        I have already touched on\n\nPeter Sim’s testimony (see para 17 above) which did little to explain the genesis of\n\nthe agreement. In any case, in his written testimony, Calvin Tan had confirmed that Peter\n\nSim was not the draftsman. Although the question of who prepared the agreement is not\n\nmaterial to my findings, I believe it is more than likely that Calvin Tan came up with the\n\ndraft somehow, contrary to his denials (N/E 144). I do not believe the first plaintiff had\n\nany hand in the drafting, save for the formula for payment of the interest, in para 5.31.        Another witness called by\n\nthe defendant was OSH. I rejected the application of his counsel to treat OSH as a hostile\n\nwitness from the very outset, without first listening to his testimony. There was no basis\n\nfor such an application, merely because OSH had made it plain to counsel he was reluctant\n\nto attend court and get involved in the dispute between the nephews and their uncle, who\n\nwas also his cousin. I did not view his refusal to acknowledge service of counsel's\n\nsubpoena as a hostile act; it was not an uncommon occurrence amongst lay persons\n\nespecially the less educated; OSH had said he is illiterate (N/E165).32.        In fact, I found OSH\n\n(DW4) to be a truthful albeit a reluctant, witness. OSH confirmed that he did not attend\n\nmeetings of OTP prior to 1999 because there was no disagreement amongst the directors and,\n\nhis role was only to represent the estate; he was also not a director. It was only after\n\ndisputes arose between the parties that he started attending meetings of OTP. This is\n\nreflected in the minutes such as that of the meeting dated 22 November 2000 (see 2AB123)\n\nwhere it was he, not the plaintiffs or the defendant, who proposed that the company be\n\nwound up after it had disposed of its properties; OSH explained his move was prompted by\n\nthe deadlock in the company resulting from the plaintiffs' intention to take loans and,\n\nthe defendant's refusal to sign cheques for the same. His proposal was approved by the\n\nplaintiffs and passed; the defendant however objected, notwithstanding that on 27 July\n\n2000 (see 1AB341), at a general meeting held to amend various articles of association of\n\nthe company, he had signed (for filing with the Registry of Companies) resolutions which\n\nincluded the following:Insertion of article 154A\"In the event of a sale by the company of the properties\n\n    situate at 11 Tannery Lane, 16 Kallang Pudding Road and 20 Kallang Pudding Road, the\n\n    company shall be dissolved immediately upon completion of the sale of the said\n\n    properties\".33.        OSH confirmed the\n\ntestimony of the first plaintiff that although he was the executor of the estate, he left\n\nestate matters to the solicitors and the defendant to handle. He was not even aware that\n\nthe grant of probate had been extracted on 18 October 1999. Whenever the solicitors asked\n\nquestions pertaining to the estate, he would refer the same to the defendant (this was\n\nconfirmed by the defendant). One reason was because OSH was not familiar with the affairs\n\nnor with the various companies of, his late uncle. Secondly, he was pre-occupied with his\n\nown hardware business. Even so, when the defendant approached him to be appointed executor\n\nof the estate in his place sometime last year, OSH refused – he was afraid there\n\nwould be chaos if he agreed (N/E 174). Further, he did not think the defendant had been\n\nhandling the estate matters well. Although he clearly did not relish his appointment by\n\nthe late Ong Toh (according to the first plaintiff OSH was chosen because he had no direct\n\nstake in the estate), I found that OSH nevertheless discharged his duties as executor.\n\nThis can be seen from the fact that he took the initiative to change solicitors for the\n\nprobate proceedings when he was dissatisfied with the slow pace of the firm appointed by\n\nthe defendant and, he was not willing to relinquish his executorship in favour of the\n\ndefendant.34.        OSH said he did not know\n\nabout the agreement nor that OTP's properties were used as collateral for defendant's bank\n\nborrowings nor that the defendant paid compensation to the plaintiffs, until 1999; this\n\nwas after the parties' relationship had soured. When there was no dispute between the\n\nparties, OSH said there was no need to inform him of what happened in the company.\n\nHowever, he refuted the defendant's written testimony that he was told about the loan in\n\nAugust - September 2000 and, that the plaintiffs were then intending to wind-up the\n\ncompany, let alone that he had expressed surprise at the defendant's information. OSH\n\nexplained that he abstained from voting at the meeting on 26 December 2000 (see 2AB126) on\n\nthe change to article 92(1) of the company's articles of association with regards to who\n\nshould be bank signatories because, he did not wish to interfere in the running of the\n\ncompany. Hence, at the earlier annual general meeting (on 27 July 2000) of the company\n\ntouching on amending the same article, he had also abstained from voting on a motion to\n\nhave three (3) groups of bank signatories comprising of:(i) the second plaintiffs;(ii) the first plaintiff(iii) the defendantAgainst the objections of the first plaintiff, the resolution was\n\ncarried and the minutes signed by the defendant as chairman. Subsequently, on 22 November\n\n2000, OSH was added as a fourth group to the authorised bank signatories (on a motion\n\nproposed by the first plaintiff), despite the defendant's objections. The move was to\n\noverride the defendant's refusal to sign cheques for the loans the plaintiffs wanted.It appeared from the minutes (see 2AB123-124) that OSH departed from his usual policy of\n\nnon-interference and cast his vote in favour of the motion.35.        According to OSH, the\n\nplaintiffs did take loans from OTP. OSH took the view that as the defendant had borrowed\n\n$16m from the company based on the defendant's percentage of shareholdings, there was no\n\nreason why the plaintiffs could not do the same. He testified (N/E 169) that the second\n\nplaintiffs wanted to borrow $1.45m each but there was something wrong with the dates on\n\nthe cheques issued to them (which he co-signed) so the cheques were not cleared. As for\n\nthe first plaintiff, his cheque for $5.49m was cleared but he returned the money to the\n\ncompany subsequently, at the request of OSH, in the light of the growing dispute between\n\nthe parties.36.        Finally, OSH confirmed\n\nthe defendant gave him a copy of the letter dated 15 October 1997 after taking him to the\n\noffice of Peter Sim to witness its signing, but not the agreement. Contrary to Calvin\n\nTan's claim however, OSH said only he and the defendant were present at the lawyer's\n\noffice, not Calvin Tan.37.        OSH’s evidence on\n\nhis non-interference in the affairs of the company and his absence from meetings of OTP\n\n(before July 1999) was confirmed by the liquidator, Chan (DW3). Although Chan Hwee Ping\n\n(from an associated company Sincere Secretarial Services) was the company secretary, Chan\n\ntestified that he had been assisting the former (since 1989 to date) in drafting minute of\n\nmeetings. It was the practice for the company secretary to circulate resolutions for\n\nsignature amongst the shareholders, including OSH. Usually, resolutions would be prepared\n\nbased on telephone requests from either a director or a clerk but he was unable to tell\n\nwho specifically instructed which resolution to be prepared. When his attention was drawn\n\nto resolutions (see 1AB77) which did not contain the signature of OSH, Chan explained that\n\nthe company secretary assumed that OSH would sign it eventually and the matter was left at\n\nthat. Chan further confirmed that because OTP was a family company, notice for meetings\n\n(whether general or special/extraordinary) was usually waived.38.        As for the liquidation\n\nproceedings, Chan said he was awaiting tax clearance, after having published the requisite\n\nnotices in the newspapers. He confirmed that it was incumbent on him as the company's\n\nliquidator, to investigate any allegations of breach of director's duties and to prosecute\n\noffenders, if necessary.",
        "The decision": "39.        I awarded judgment to the\n\nplaintiffs on both suits because the defendant's various defences were without any merit\n\nwhatsoever, not to mention that he failed to discharge the burden to prove his\n\nallegations; I shall now address each of his defences in turn.",
        "A Illegality:": "(i)    the agreement was ultra vires the articles of\n\nassociation of OTP(ii) breach of the plaintiffs' fidicuary duties to OTP(iii)    failure by the plaintiffs to disclose their\n\ninterests under the agreement when passing the resolutions agreeing to mortgage the\n\nproperties;(iv)    no company resolution approving the pecuniary\n\nbenefit the plaintiffs obtained under the agreement40.        These defences were\n\ntotally misconceived as the company was not involved in the agreement at all. As the\n\nplaintiffs had repeatedly asserted, it was a private arrangement between themselves and\n\nthe defendantin their personal capacities. The plaintiffs and the defendant were\n\nalso the company's common shareholders/directors; they had approved the use by the\n\ndefendant of the company's properties as collateral for his personal loan and the\n\nnecessary board resolutions had been passed. OSH wasnota shareholder of OTP in\n\nhis own right but represented the estate which ultimate beneficiaries were also the first\n\nplaintiff and the defendant. As the first plaintiff had asked of counsel for the defendant\n\n-- who else should the plaintiffs declare their interests to? My view is reinforced by an\n\nextract from a textbook authority relied on by the defendant, namely Walter Woon'sCompany\n\nLaw(2 ed at p 266) which states:Directors must exercise their discretion bona fide in what they\n\n    consider (not what a court may consider) is in the interest of the company. …Their\n\n    overriding motive must be to advance the company's interests. Put in its extreme form,\n\n    what this rule amounts to is this: everything that a director doesquadirector\n\n    must be done to promote or advance the interests of his company.41.        On the issue ofultra\n\nvires, I need only refer to two (2) extracts fromGuide to Company Law in Malaysia\n\n& Singapore(3 ed at pp 104-105) included in the defendant's bundle of\n\nauthorities:3-145 Acts which are ultra viresUltra viresacts are acts which are unauthorised by the\n\n    objects clause in the Memorandum of Association of a company…….3-150 Effect of ultra vires actsA transaction which is found to beultra viresis void and\n\n    unenforceableagainst the company.…(emphasis mine)Consequently, the numerous authorities cited by counsel for the\n\ndefendant, of the duty on directors to declare secret profits they received at the expense\n\nof their companies, has no relevance to our case.42.        Although it was pleaded\n\nin the Further and Better Particulars of the Defence (filed on 7 February 2001) on the\n\nissue ofultra viresthat:The alleged agreement which inter alia allowed the\n\n    plaintiff to claim an interest of 8% per annum through the Company's Properties being used\n\n    as a security is not provided for under the Company's Memorandum and Articles of\n\n    Associationthe defendant did not exhibit the company's articles of association\n\neither in his affidavit of evidence or in his bundle of documents (2AB1-128); nor were\n\nthey included in the plaintiffs' documents. Consequently, the defendant's allegation could\n\nnot be verified. In any case, I noted that the company had passed a special resolution at\n\nan extraordinary general meeting held on 23 July 1997 (see 1AB64-65) to amend its articles\n\nof association to include clauses which allowed the company to guarantee the debts etc of\n\nthird parties by mortgaging its assets (if indeed the provision was absent from its\n\narticles of association).43.        I return now to the\n\nauthorities mentioned earlier, starting withMiller v Karlinski. That case has no\n\nrelevance whatsoever as can be seen from the following headnotes:A contract of employment by which the employee is to be paid a\n\n    specified weekly sum as salary and to recover from his employer the amount payable out of\n\n    that sum in respect of income tax by including it in an account for travelling expenses is\n\n    not severable, butthe whole contract is illegal as being contrary to public policy and\n\n    the Courts will not entertain an action to enforce any of its terms. No action will\n\n    therefore lie to recover arrears of salary alleged to be due(emphasis mine).It bears reiterating at this juncture that the agreement is not illegal\n\nper se so as to preclude its enforcement.44.        As forNapier v\n\nNational Business Agency Ltd, that case again touched on a scheme calculated to\n\ndeceive the revenue authorities which the appellate court again held was unenforceable;\n\nthis is apparent from its headnotes which read:The defendant engaged the plaintiff to act as their\n\n    secretary and accountant at a salary of 13 a week together with 6 a week for expenses.\n\n    Both parties were aware that the plaintiff's expenses could never amount to 6 a week\n\n    and, in fact, they did not exceed 1 a week. Each week the defendants deducted from the\n\n    salary of 13 a week the amount of income tax appropriate to that sum, and the payment of\n\n    6 a week was represented as a reimbursement of expenses on the returns made to the\n\n    Inland Revenue Commissioners. The plaintiff was summarily dismissed, and claimed payment\n\n    from the defendants, in lieu of notice, of 13 a week for a certain period.Held:    (i)    the provisions of the\n\n    service agreement relating expenses were intended to mislead the taxation authorities and\n\n    evade tax, and, therefore, the agreement was contrary to public policy;(ii)    although the plaintiff sought only to\n\n      enforce the provisions of the agreement relating to salary, those provisions were not\n\n      severable from the rest of the agreement and were equally unenforceable.(v)    concealing the agreement from and deceiving, the\n\ninland revenue authorities45.        Unlike the plaintiffs inMiller\n\nv KarlinskiandNapier v National Business Agency Ltd,the plaintiffs in this\n\ncase did not attempt to create a false agreement to deceive the tax authorities; they sued\n\non the agreement which reflected the actual intention of both parties. How then can it be\n\nsaid they had deceived the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)? What is true and\n\nwhich the plaintiffs readily admitted was, they did not declare to IRAS the interest they\n\nhad received from the defendant, as part of their income. As I had said in para 24 above,\n\nthat is a matter between the plaintiffs and IRAS – whether the interest is deemed to\n\nbe taxable income; it does not concern the court and failure to declare the income (if\n\nfound to be the case) to IRAS does not afford the defendant any defence to the plaintiffs'\n\nclaim.",
        "(vi)    the agreement offended ss 3 and 8 of the\n\nMoneylenders' Act Cap 188": "46.        The defendant did not\n\nadduce any evidence to substantiate this defence nor did his counsel question the\n\nplaintiffs or make reference to it in his final submissions. Consequently, this defence\n\nwas deemed to be abandoned.",
        "B Lack of consideration": "47.        I believe it is clear\n\nfrom the face of the agreement itself, that the plaintiffs did provide good and valuable\n\nconsideration for the defendant's payment. The operative words are to be found in para 4\n\nwhich states:Because you [the plaintiffs] have all willingly\n\n    permitted the Company to so mortgage the property [the three properties] to IBS for my\n\n    benefit, I will compensate you for your opportunity cost at the rate of eight (8) percent\n\n    per annum payable monthly on the outstanding principal sum owing to IBS….On the law, the learned authors ofChitty on Contracts(vol.1 28\n\ned p 187) state as follows:3-036 Benefit to promisor sufficientThe requirement that consideration must move from the promisee is\n\n    most generally satisfied where some detriment is suffered by hime.g.where he\n\n    parts with money or goods, or renders services, in exchange for the promise. But the\n\n    requirement may equally be satisfied where the promisee confers a benefit on the promisor\n\n    without suffering any detriment.Consequently, the fact that OTP, not the plaintiffs, suffered a\n\ndetriment which led eventually to its properties being sold, does not render the\n\nconsideration provided by the plaintiffs any less valuable.",
        "Conclusion": "48.        Having considered the\n\nevidence in its totality, I was of the view that the plaintiffs (whose testimony I\n\naccepted) had proved their case on a balance of probabilities. The defendant on the other\n\nhand, was not able to substantiate any of the defences he had put up. In addition, his\n\ntestimony sometimes contradicted the documents produced in court. Accordingly, I awarded\n\njudgment to the first and second plaintiffs in the First and Second Suits as per their\n\nclaims.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
