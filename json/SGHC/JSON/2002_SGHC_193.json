        "The facts": "4\n\n        The appellant is Lim Weng Kee, aged 62. At the\n\ndate of the alleged incidents, on or around 28 October 1998, he had had 20 years of\n\nexperience in running the business. He had been the managing director of Thai Shin and\n\nThai Hong since 1978, and thede factomanaging director of Wang Wang (which he\n\nfounded) since 1996. The appellant admitted that he was the person-in-charge of the\n\nbusinesses of the three pawnshops at the time of the alleged incidents. The three pawn\n\nlicenses were also issued in his name.5\n\n        Chong Yok Yin (\"Chong\"), the\n\nappellant’s sister-in-law, was a director of Thai Hong and Thai Shin. One of her\n\nsons, Lim Feok Loong (\"Feok\") started as an employee of the three pawnshops and\n\nwas later appointed a director of Thai Shin and Thai Hong. Her other son, Lim Yeow Loong\n\n(\"Yeow\"), was a shareholder of all three pawnshops and had been working at Thai\n\nShin for about two to three years before the alleged incidents. Sim Siew Ngoh\n\n(\"Sim\") and Ang Geok Eng (\"Ang\") were both employees at Thai Shin.6\n\n        The appellant first came to know Samuri on 12\n\nDecember 1997. In the appellant’s words, Samuri struck him as \"well dressed,\n\nwasn’t ordinary, common people; of high society type\". Samuri in turn\n\nperpetuated the impression by arriving at the pawnshops in a chauffeur-driven Mercedes and\n\nclaiming to be married to the brother of the Sultan of Brunei. Her ‘residence’\n\nat Punggol was two adjacent bungalows, 3-storeys high, bearing a single address. Between\n\n1997 and 1998, she pawned $4m worth of jewellery items at the 3 pawnshops.7\n\n        Samuri tried to buy the heart of the appellant\n\nby showering him with gifts, including a gold coin, ‘blessed’ Bruneian notes and\n\na watch. That happened in May or June 1998. Samuri also developed a close relationship\n\nwith Chong, addressing her as ‘Mama’. All these were in fact a pretence. She was\n\nnot a royal but an owner of a restaurant. The Punggol ‘residence’ did not belong\n\nto her and the jewellery items were conned from a diamond merchant. The appellant\n\nunfortunately failed to see through the facade.8\n\n        On 12 October 1998, the appellant directed Feok\n\nto telephone Samuri regarding the outstanding interest due to the pawnshops. Feok did so\n\nand Samuri requested that they make a visit to her ‘residence’. At her\n\n‘residence’, Samuri informed them of her intention to redeem her jewellery items\n\nand asked the appellant to give an estimate. The appellant gave an estimate of between $4m\n\nto $5m. Samuri then instructed Feok to write out a $6m cheque in favour of Wang Wang\n\npawnshop, with the balance to be refunded to her later.9\n\n        Immediately afterwards, Samuri instructed Feok\n\nto write out four more cheques of $1m eachas gifts to the appellant, Feok, Yeow\n\nand Chong. To prevent the appellant from discovering her ploy, Samuri told the appellant\n\nthat she would be attending prayers for a deceased relative for the next 21 days and the\n\ncheques must not be deposited during that period of time. Meanwhile, the appellant kept\n\nall the five cheques.10\n\n        On the morning of 28 October 1998, the\n\nappellant and Feok were at Thai Hong. They proceeded to Thai Shin upon receiving a call\n\nfrom Yeow that Samuri was there. Upon arriving at Thai Shin, the appellant immediately\n\nasked Samuri when he could deposit the five 12 October cheques. Samuri told him to wait\n\nand instead instructed Feok to write out a $15m cash cheque which was meant for Chong to\n\nsafe-keep for her, a $200,000 cheque in favour of Chong, a $50,000 cash cheque intended as\n\na gift to the employees of the three companies; and a cash cheque of $3m intended as an\n\nanonymous gift to charity.11\n\n        After about 15 to 20 minutes, Samuri told the\n\nappellant that she wanted the jewellery items back. The appellant responded that he could\n\nnot release the items as the cheques had not been cleared. The appellant claimed that he\n\ntold Chong the same thing in the Khek dialect but Chong assured him that Samuri would pay\n\nup and that the appellant should allow Samuri to take the items. Both Feok and Yeow were\n\npresent but did not utter a word.12\n\n        Before the court below, the appellant claimed\n\nthat he did not permit the release of the items. He only relented because he could not\n\noppose Chong and Feok as he had a heart problem. He claimed that he had done his best but\n\ncould not do more to prevent the release of the items as both Feok and Chong were also\n\ndirectors. Even if he had tried to stop Chong and Feok, they would not have listened to\n\nhim. The prosecution’s submission was that the appellant did permit the release of\n\nthe items. The district judge ruled in favour of the prosecution on this point.13\n\n        Samuri chose some items at Thai Shin. Feok then\n\ndrove Samuri and the appellant to Thai Hong and Wang Wang where the same process of\n\nchoosing the items was repeated.14\n\n        On 5 November 1998, the $6m cheque issued on 12\n\nOctober 1998 was dishonoured. Samuri was also nowhere to be found. The appellant then made\n\na police report. Samuri was later arrested and sentenced to serve six and a half\n\nyears’ imprisonment in Changi Women’s Prison.15\n\n        The losses to the pawnshops were very\n\nsubstantial. The appellant admitted that until the day of the trial, he did not know the\n\nactual value of the items taken away as he did not keep proper track of the exact list of\n\njewellery taken away by Samuri. It was estimated by the appellant to amount to $4.136m,\n\nbased on the total value of the pawn tickets. The shareholders of the three pawnshops\n\nsuffered immense losses. At the date of the trial, Wang Wang was in the process of being\n\nsold, while Thai Shin and Thai Hong had to be injected with fresh capital to survive. In a\n\nseparate civil suit, the appellant, Chong, Yeow and Feok were ordered to pay $300,000 in\n\ncompensation each to Thai Shin and Thai Hong.",
        "Decision below": "16\n\n        The district judge made several findings of\n\nfact. Firstly, the appellant was in control of the companies at the relevant time.\n\nSecondly, the appellant permitted the release of the jewellery items to Samuri. The judge\n\nrejected the appellant’s claim that he had done his best to object to the release of\n\nthose items on three main grounds. Firstly, evidence given by Samuri, Ang and Sim showed\n\nthat the appellant had released the items willingly. Evidence given by Chong, Feok and\n\nYeow in favour of the prosecution was excluded for fear of unfair prejudice against the\n\nappellant as they were also the recipients of Samuri’s gifts. Secondly, the appellant\n\ndid not mention this claim to the investigating officer and only brought it up in court as\n\nan afterthought. Thirdly, if the appellant had objected strongly to the release of the\n\nitems, he would not have followed Feok and Samuri to the second and third pawnshops.17\n\n        The judge also held that the standard of\n\n‘reasonable diligence’ under s157(1) CA is objective: the issue therefore was\n\nwhether the appellant exercised such degree of care and skill as would amount to the\n\nreasonable care which an ordinary person might be expected to take in the circumstances on\n\nhis own behalf. This objective test applies to both civil breaches of the duty to use\n\nreasonable diligence under s 157(3)(a); as well as criminal breaches of that duty under s\n\n157(3)b.18\n\n        The judge ruled that, on the totality of the\n\nevidence, the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had\n\nobjectively failed to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties as a\n\ndirector of the three pawnshops. The items were extremely valuable and no person of\n\nordinary prudence would have permitted the release of the items without first having the\n\ncheques cleared and honoured.19\n\n        The appellant was convicted and fined $4,000 on\n\neach of the charges. In awarding the sentence, the judge bore in mind sentencing\n\nprecedents and the suffering the appellant had gone through in the form of loss of\n\nemployment and control of the pawnshops, as well as the substantial compensation he had to\n\npay in settlement of the civil suits.",
        "Issues Arising on Appeal": "20\n\n        Four issues arose for the court’s\n\nconsideration. Firstly, what the test of ‘reasonable diligence’ to be applied\n\nfor a criminal offence under s 157(3)(b) CA is. Secondly, what the standard of proof under\n\ns 157(3)(b) CA is. Thirdly, whether the appellant had used reasonable diligence on the\n\nfacts of the case. Lastly, whether the fines imposed by the judge were manifestly\n\nexcessive.",
        "First ground of appeal: the test of\n\n‘reasonable diligence’ under s 157 CA": "21\n\n        The appellant did not deny that an objective\n\ntest of ‘reasonable diligence’ applies forcivilbreaches of\n\ndirectors’ duties under s 157(3)(a) but contended that a subjective test should apply\n\nforcriminalbreaches under s 157(3)(b). I did not think that the appellant was\n\nright. First of all, however it will be useful to survey the case law with respect to\n\ncivil breaches. This is for two reasons. Firstly, most cases to date have focused on civil\n\nbreaches and, hence, they provide a useful starting point in formulating the test for\n\ncriminal breaches. Secondly, s 157(1) on its plain terms does not appear to set different\n\ntests for civil and criminal breaches of directors’ duties. Hence, the test applied\n\nin one will obviously be relevant to the other.",
        "(i) The test to be applied for civil\n\nbreaches of directors’ duties under s 157(3)(a) CA": "22\n\n        Section 157(1) CA \"mirrors a\n\ndirector’s general fiduciary duty at common law\":Cheam Tat Pang & Anor v\n\nPP[1996] 1 SLR 541at 548. Hence, the common law is very persuasive in interpreting\n\ns157(1). According toRe City Equitable Fire Insurance Co Ltd[1925] Ch 407 at 428,\n\nthe standard is measured \"by the care an ordinary man might be expected to take in\n\nthe circumstances on his own behalf\". With due respect, this is a vague proposition\n\nwhich does not elaborate on the factors that go towards influencing this\n\n‘ordinary’ man standard. In particular, should the courts take into account the\n\nsubjective level of knowledge and experience of the particular defendant in deciding what\n\nan ‘ordinary’ director would do in the circumstances? The traditional approach\n\nanswers the question in the affirmative. As stated by Lord Lindley M.R. inLagunas\n\nNitrate Company v Lagunas Syndicate[1899] 2 Ch 392 at 435:If directors act within their powers, if\n\n  they act with such care as is reasonably to be expected from them, having regard to\n\n  their knowledge and experience, and if they act honestly for the benefit of the\n\n  company they represent, they discharge both their equitable as well as their legal duty to\n\n  the company. [Emphasis added]This passage was cited with approval by\n\nPidgeon J inAustralian Securities Commission v Gallagher[1993] 10 ACSR 43, a\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court of Western Australia at 53:…the test isbasicallyan objective one in the sense that the question is what an ordinary person,with the\n\n  knowledge and experience of the defendant, might be expected to have done in the\n\n  circumstances if he was acting on his own behalf. [Emphases added]23\n\n        Under the traditional approach exemplified by\n\nthese lines of cases, the standard of ‘reasonable diligence’ is essentially\n\nobjective but it contains an important subjective qualification: it is measured against\n\nwhat an ‘ordinary’ director, sharing the same level of knowledge and\n\nexperience as the defendant, would or would not have done on the facts of the case.\n\nThis makes it possible for a defendant to escape liability by appealing to his own lack of\n\nknowledge or experience.24\n\n        However, times have changed. Professor Paul\n\nDavis pointed out inGower’s Principles of Modern Company Law(6 ed.) at p\n\n640, \"those cases seem to have framed the directors’ duties of skill and care\n\nwith non-executive rather than executive directors in mind and, moreover, on the basis of\n\na view that the non-executive director had no serious role to play within the company but\n\nwas simply a piece of window-dressing aimed at promoting the company’s image\".25\n\n        InDaniels v Anderson[1995] 16 ACSR 607\n\nat 666-667, the Supreme Court of New South Wales indicated that it is no longer\n\nappropriate to judge a director’s conduct by the traditional approach applied in\n\ncases such asLagunas Nitrate Company v Lagunas Syndicate:The duties of a director are eloquently\n\n  explained in the judgment of Pollock J, giving the opinion of the Supreme Court of New\n\n  Jersey, inFrancis v United Jersey Bank432 A 2d 814 (1981)……In our\n\n  opinion, this has become what the law requires of directors. At 812-3 Pollock J said:\n\n  \" ……Because directors are bound to exercise ordinary care,they\n\n  cannot set up as a defense lack of the knowledge needed to exercise the requisite degree\n\n  of care. If one feels that he has not had sufficient business experience to\n\n  qualify him to perform the duties of a director, he should either acquire the knowledge by\n\n  inquiry, or refuse to act……A director is not an ornament, but an essential\n\n  component of corporate governance. Consequently, a director cannot protect himself behind\n\n  a paper shield bearing the motto \"dummy director\". [Emphasis added]26\n\n        This passage was quoted with approval in the\n\nChancery Division inRe Barings plc and others(No 5) [1999] 1 BCLC 433 at 488. The\n\npolicy under this modern approach is clear: a person who accepts the office of director\n\nundertakes the responsibility that he understands the nature of the duty required of that\n\noffice. That duty will vary depending on the circumstances, the size and the business of\n\nthe particular company and the experience or skills that the directorheld\n\nhimself outto possess in support of appointment to the office.27\n\n        A similar view was held by Hoffman J inRe\n\nD’Jan of London Ltd[1994] 1 BCLC 561 (Chancery Division) where he decided that\n\nthe duty of care owed by a director at common law is the conduct of a reasonably diligent\n\nperson having both (a) the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be\n\nexpected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that director\n\nin relation to the company, and (b) the general knowledge, skill and experience which that\n\ndirector has. As pointed out by Professor Davis inGower’s Principles of Modern\n\nCompany Law(6 ed.) at p 642, the crucial difference with the traditional approach is\n\nthat limb (b) adds a subjective standard which can operate only to increase, and not\n\ndecrease the level of care and diligence required by the director.28\n\n        In my opinion, the modern approach exemplified\n\ninDaniels v AndersonandRe D’ Jan of London Ltdalso represents the\n\nposition here. The law hence stands as thus: thecivilstandard of care and\n\ndiligence expected of a director is objective, namely, whether he has exercised the same\n\ndegree of care and diligence as a reasonable director found in his position. This standard\n\nis not fixed but a continuum depending on various factors such as the individual’s\n\nrole in the company, the type of decision being made, the size and the business of the\n\ncompany. However, it is important to note that, unlike the traditional approach, this\n\nstandard will not be lowered to accommodate any inadequacies in the individual’s\n\nknowledge or experience. The standard will however be raised if he held himself out to\n\npossess or in fact possesses some special knowledge or experience.29\n\n        This position is not just in line with recent\n\ndevelopments in England and Australia but supported by two other reasons on principle:\n\nfirstly, the traditional approach made it too easy for directors to escape responsibility\n\nfor breaches of duty by relying on their personal lack of experience or knowledge. Surely\n\nthe law cannot act as an excuse for directors to continue in their ignorant state. That is\n\nhowever exactly the effect of the traditional approach. This detracts from the protection\n\nto shareholders intended by s157. Secondly, most of the older cases predated the modern\n\nobjective test of negligence propounded by the House of Lords inDonoghue v Stevenson[1932] AC 562 and should be read in the light of subsequent developments. Hence, the\n\ntraditional position inLagunas Nitrate Co v Lagunas Syndicateshould no longer be\n\nfollowed.",
        "(ii) The test to be applied for criminal\n\nbreaches of directors’ duties under s 157(3)(b) CA": "30\n\n        The appellant did not deny that an objective\n\ntest applies for civil cases but contended that a subjective test should apply for a\n\ncriminal offence under s157(3)(b) because it is a fundamental principle of criminal law\n\nthat a guilty mind must be proved before a charge can be sustained. Presumably, the\n\nsubjective test means that, for a director to be criminally liable, he must at least be\n\nconscious of the risks involved but goes on to take the risks. In my opinion, the judge\n\nwas justified in rejecting the subjective test because the language of s 157(1) CA\n\nsupports an objective test. The term ‘reasonablediligence’ in s157(1)\n\nitself implies that the appellant’s conduct must be measured against some objective\n\nstandard of behaviour: how else could reasonableness be ascertained? Neither is an\n\nobjective test alien in our criminal law. InLim Poh Eng v PP[1999] 1 SLR 116\n\nwhere the appellant was facing a charge of causing grievous hurt by doing an act so\n\nnegligently as to endanger human life under s 338 Penal Code (Cap 224), I adopted an\n\nobjective standard for negligence in both criminal and civil cases, namely, whether a\n\nperson has omitted to do something which a reasonable man would do, or has done something\n\nwhich a prudent and reasonable man would not do.31\n\n        It can be seen that the requirement of a\n\nsubjective state of mind in our criminal law stands no higher than this: it is a general\n\nand important principle but it must yield to clear statutory language. Just as\n\n\"negligently\" under s 338 of the Penal Code is an instance of such clear\n\nlanguage, likewise, \"reasonable diligence\" under s 157(1) CA is also such an\n\ninstance.32\n\n        It is important to note that the duty of a\n\ndirector to act with reasonable diligence is in turn conceptually distinct from the other\n\nlimb in s157(1): the duty to act honestly. These are different aspects of a\n\ndirector’s bundle of duties even though they may overlap on certain facts.\n\n\"Honesty\" has been interpreted to refer to the common law duty of a director to\n\nact bona fide in the interests of the company:Marchesi v Barnes and Keogh[1970] V.R. 434 at 438.33\n\n        Given the conceptual difference between honesty\n\nand diligence, it is clear that adopting a subjective test for the duty to act honestly\n\ndoes not mean that the court must do likewise for the duty to act with reasonable\n\ndiligence. Bearing this in mind, the following passage inCheam Tat Pang v PP[1996] 1 SLR 541at 545 relied upon by the appellant, although suggesting a subjective\n\ntest, is clearly directed towards the ‘honesty’ limb in s 157(1) and does not\n\nsupport the appellant’s submission:Counsel submitted that the concept ofhonestybears different meanings under s157(1) CA, and under s 405 of the Penal Code. It was not\n\n  disputed that the former term covers a wide spectrum of obligations relating to a\n\n  director’s fiduciary duties. The onlymens rearequired for a s157(3) CA\n\n  offenceis knowledge that what is being done is not in the interests of the company,\n\n  adopting Gowan J’s views as expressed inMarchesi v Barnes & Keogh(1970)\n\n  V.R. 434.[Emphases added]34\n\n        Although the subjective test of\n\n‘reasonable diligence’ is rightly rejected, a choice must still be made between\n\ntwo different variants of objective tests for the purpose of criminal liability, namely,\n\nthe traditional approach underLagunas Nitrate Co v Lagunas Syndicateor the modern\n\napproach underDaniels v Anderson. I have earlier adopted the modern approach for\n\ncivil cases. I am convinced that the same should also apply to criminal cases for two\n\nreasons.35\n\n        Firstly, the structure of s 157 shows that\n\nParliament does not intend different tests of diligence for civil and criminal breaches.\n\nIf different tests are indeed intended, then it would be natural for s 157 to have\n\ndifferent sub-sections describing the respective tests in different terms. Instead, a\n\nsingle standard of ‘reasonable diligence’ is set in s 157(1) with s 157(3)\n\nindicating concurrent civil and criminal liability for breach of that standard. This was\n\nalso the opinion of Sinnathuray J in the High Court decision ofRe Kie Hock Shipping\n\n(1971) Pte Ltd[1985] 1 MLJ 411at 417:…every director owes a duty to his\n\n  company to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties. Failure by a director\n\n  to do so would be a breach of duty of his office. That breach of duty would give rise to\n\n  an action by the company against the director for damages suffered by the company. The\n\n  commission ofthatbreach of duty by the director wouldalsobe a criminal offence. [Emphases added]It is clear from the cited passage that\n\nSinnathuray J did not distinguish between civil and criminal breaches of the duty to use\n\nreasonable diligence. Therefore, if the test inDaniels v Andersonapplies for\n\ncivil cases (and I have decided earlier that it does), then the same test should apply for\n\ncriminal cases as well.36\n\n        Secondly, one must keep in mind the aim of\n\nimposing criminal liability under s 157(3)(b). While the objective of civil liability is\n\nto compensate the company for losses caused by directors’ negligence, the aim of\n\ncriminal liability is to protect the wider public interests by deterring directors from\n\nacting negligently. It should be clear by now that corporate scandals, especially in large\n\nlisted companies, impact adversely not only on the company in question, but may also have\n\na ripple effect on the wider stock market and the economy. Civil liability is however not\n\nintended to protect, and in many cases is ineffective in protecting, the wider public\n\ninterests, simply because a civil action is not brought in many cases. For instance, the\n\ndirector may be bankrupt by then and will not have the resources to pay any damages.\n\nSometimes, members of the company may not want to tarnish the reputation of the company\n\ndue to the negative publicity generated by suing the errant director. There are many other\n\nreasons why a civil action may never see the light of day. However, in such cases, public\n\ninterests, represented by the criminal law, demand that the errant director cannot go\n\nscot-free. Hence, any test of criminal liability must be sufficiently robust if it is to\n\nprotect the public interests by deterring directors from acting negligently.37\n\n        The traditional approach underLagunas\n\nNitrate Co v Lagunas Syndicate, in allowing an errant director to escape liability\n\nbecause of his inexperience and lack of knowledge, is certainly not robust enough. Often,\n\nlosses are caused precisely because of the director’s inexperience and ignorance:\n\ngiving allowance to such failings will negate any intended protection of the public\n\ninterests. Public interests demand that the law places a duty on directors to acquire the\n\nexperience and knowledge required to run the company, which is well reflected in the\n\nmodern approach underDaniels v Anderson.38\n\n        Hence, in my opinion, the test inDaniels v\n\nAnderson, which I have adopted in the context of civil liability, also applies to\n\ncriminal liability under s 157(3)(b). However, it is important to note that, even though\n\nthe subjective lack of experience and knowledge of the defendant is irrelevant to\n\nconviction, it should be considered in sentencing. It is only fair that a director who is\n\nunable to meet the expected standard due to his lack of experience, should be given a\n\nlighter punishment than someone who is experienced enough to be able to exercise the\n\nrequired degree of care and diligence, but simply fails to do so.",
        "Second ground of appeal: the standard of\n\nproof under s 157(3)(b) CA": "39\n\n        The appellant contended that the district\n\njudge, in adopting an objective standard of ‘reasonable diligence’, erroneously\n\nadopted the civil standard of proof for a criminal action. This contention had no merit.\n\nThe appellant unfortunately failed to distinguish between the standard of reasonable\n\ndiligence and the standard of proof. An objective standard of reasonable diligence can\n\nco-exist with the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Under s 157(3)(b),\n\nlike other criminal actions, the prosecution mustprove beyond a reasonable doubtthat on the totality of the evidence, the defendant hasobjectivelyfailed to use\n\nreasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties as a director.",
        "Third ground of appeal: whether the\n\nappellant had used reasonable diligence on the facts": "40\n\n        Applying the standard for criminal liability\n\nadopted earlier, the issue here was whether a reasonable managing director having 20 years\n\nexperience in operating three pawnshop businesses of similar scale would have done as the\n\nappellant did, namely, releasing such valuable jewellery items before the cheque had been\n\ncleared. If the appellant had been totally lacking in experience or knowledge, thiswouldnot lowerthe standard of care expected of him. Here, however, he had been running\n\nthe business for 20 years – this certainly qualified as ‘special\n\nexperience’ whichwould raisethe expected standard. On the facts, there was\n\ncertainly no doubt that he failed to use reasonable diligence. He was in control of the\n\npawnshops then and no reasonable managing director found in his shoes would have done as\n\nhe did.41\n\n        The judge’s findings of facts were\n\nchallenged on several points, particularly that he should have found that the appellant\n\nwas conscious of the risks involved in releasing the items and only authorised their\n\nrelease upon Chong’s assurance that Samuri would pay up. It is unnecessary to list\n\nall the objections here, but suffice to say that none of them detract from the central\n\nfact that the appellant voluntarily authorised the release of those items although he knew\n\nthe cheque had not been cleared. In my opinion, this fact alone was enough to sustain a\n\nconviction. Under an objective test, it did not matter whether the appellant was conscious\n\nof the risks involved in releasing the items. Further, neither would a reasonable director\n\nrelease the items upon the informal assurance of a fellow director that a customer would\n\npay up. It was more than careless of the appellant to trust Chong’s assurance of\n\nSamuri’s credibility. In my opinion, the prosecution had proved the charges beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.",
        "Fourth Ground of Appeal: whether the fines\n\nimposed are manifestly excessive": "42\n\n        In his judgment, the judge carefully considered\n\nall the mitigating factors: the appellant’s loss of employment and control of the\n\npawnshops, the fruits of his lifetime’s hard work and efforts, as well as the sum of\n\n$300,000 he had to pay (together with Chong, Feok and Yeow) in settlement of the civil\n\nsuits. On the other hand, one must not forget the substantial losses caused to the\n\nshareholders of the pawnshops and the glaring fact that the appellant, with his 20 years\n\nof experience in the business, should not have made such a mistake. On the facts of the\n\ncase, the fines of $4,000 in respect of each of the charges were not excessive at all.",
        "Conclusion": "43\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the\n\nappeals against the appellant’s conviction and sentence.",
