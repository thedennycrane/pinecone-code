        "Claim for the cost of repairs to the \"Regal 8\"": "21. In November 1995, the vessel \"Regal 8\" was sold by Kea\n\nMaritime Pte Ltd (\"Kea Maritime\") to Trisakti Utama Shipping Pte Ltd\n\n(\"Trisakti Utama\") a company controlled by Teddy Salim. Trisakti Utama was to\n\npay the purchase price in 48 instalments and title was to be transferred upon the\n\ncompletion of the payments.22. The defendant was the managing director of Kea Maritime and owned\n\n20% of its shares, with Kea Holding holding the other 80%. The plaintiffs were interested\n\nin the sale because Kea Resources paid for the construction of the vessel.23. The defendant was accused of actingmala fideand against\n\nthe interests of Kea Resources in the sale of the vessels to Trisakti Utama. The vessel\n\ndeveloped mechanical difficulties after it was delivered to Trisakti Utama. A dispute\n\narose over whether that was caused by the equipment supplied, or by improper maintenance.\n\nOn 13 February 1997 the vessel sailed back to Singapore, and Kea Resources eventually\n\nincurred $338,493.29 for the repairs. At that time the instalment payments were in\n\narrears. Kea Resources took the position that the agreement was terminated from that date,\n\nreasserted possession over the vessel, and forfeited the instalment payments made.24. The complaints against the defendant were that he failed in his\n\nfiduciary duties to Kea Resources to ensure that the vessel was properly maintained by the\n\npurchaser and that he took the vessel back without the consent of Kea Resources.25. Assuming that the repairs were necessitated by improper maintenance\n\n(that dispute was not resolved), the repair costs would be owed to Kea Maritime because if\n\nthe buyer had a duty to maintain the vessel, it would be owed to the seller.26. Before the vessel returned to Singapore, Kea Resources’\n\nmarketing director informed Trisakti Utama that the costs of repairs would be for Trisakti\n\nUtama’s account, but the position was not maintained. Neither Kea Resources nor Kea\n\nMaritime appears to have made any claim against Trisakti Utama after the repairs were\n\ncarried out.27. The plaintiffs did not show that Trisakti Utama was under a duty to\n\nmaintain the vessel or that the defendant had a duty to ensure that the vessel was\n\nproperly maintained, or that the duty was owed to Kea Resources. In the face of these\n\nsubstantial shortcomings, the claim must fail.",
        "Claim for US$114,000 commission paid by Jiangdu Shipyard": "28. The plaintiffs pleaded in paragraph 105 of the Statement of Claim\n\nthatThe Defendant was appointed by the First Plaintiffs as a Director and\n\n  Managing Director in M/s First Pacific Maritime Pte Ltd (\"FPM\") which is a joint\n\n  venture between the First Plaintiffs and a China company, M/s Shen Zhen Yuanzhou Science\n\n  Technology Industry Company Limited (\"SZYS\"). As a Director and Managing\n\n  Director appointed to sit on the Board of FPM, the Defendant owed to the First Plaintiffs\n\n  fiduciary duties, including a duty to act bona fide in the interests of the First\n\n  Plaintiffs, a duty not to put himself in a conflict of interest position and a duty to act\n\n  for the proper purposes of the First Plaintiffs in relation to its affairs.29. They alleged that the defendant received from Jiangdu Shipyard a\n\ncommission of US$114,000 for arranging for FPM to commission the shipyard to construct two\n\nvessels. The shipyard’s payment was documented. Its remittance application named FPM\n\nas the beneficiary, but instructed payment to be paid into the defendant’s bank\n\naccount. The defendant admitted receiving the money, but claimed to have paid the money\n\nover to some officers of PT Pertamina of Indonesia. He explained that Jiangdu Shipyard was\n\nunable to pay them directly because of Chinese regulatory controls, and Wang Yiling, a\n\ndirector of Jiangdu Shipyard sought his co-operation to route the payment through his bank\n\naccount. He did not produce any evidence from Wang Yiling or anyone from Jiangdu Shipyard\n\nto corroborate him, nor did he identify the Pertamina officers, call them as his\n\nwitnesses, or produce receipts for the payments made to them.30. On the evidence, I found that the defendant had received the\n\nUS$114,000 for his own account. However, I found that Kea Holdings was not the proper\n\nparty to claim it from the defendant. Jiangdu Shipyard paid the defendant in connection\n\nwith its dealings with FPM. As a director of FPM, the director owed it a duty not to\n\nenrich himself in that way. When Kea Holdings appointed the defendant as a director of\n\nFPM, it was implied that the defendant would discharge his duties to FPM faithfully and\n\nalso to protect and promote Kea Holding’s interests where they do not conflict with\n\nthe company’s. However it did not mean that in that office he owed the same duties to\n\nKea Holdings as he did to FPM.31. Kea Holdings’ position was thatEven if he is deemed to have received this sum as a director of FPM,\n\n  the law is clear that he, being a nominee director appointed by the First Plaintiffs, is a\n\n  fiduciary of the First Plaintiffs,implying that the fiduciary dutiesquaappointee are the same as\n\nthosequadirector. They cannot be because the first are owed to the appointor and\n\nthe second to the company.32. The defendant’s duty was to perform his duties faithfully to\n\nFPM. If he did that, he would have paid the commission he received over to FPM. It would\n\nhave been wrong for him to pay the money to Kea Holdings even if he was minded to do it,\n\nand Kea Holdings had no right to claim it from him.Claim arising from the sale of the \"Regal 8\" to Kea Maritime33. This claim was related to the claim for the repair costs of the\n\n\"Regal 8\". The allegation was that the defendant produced two sale agreements of\n\nthe \"Regal 8\" between Kea Maritime as seller and Trisakti Utama as buyer. The\n\nagreement in Kea Maritime’s possession showed the price to be $1.2 million, while the\n\nagreement in Trisakti Utama’s possession showed it as $1.3 million.34. Teddy Salim confirmed that the contract that he signed on behalf of\n\nTrisakti Utama was for $1.3 million and that the agreement for the lower sum was a\n\nforgery.35. Kea Resources proceed with this claim on the basis that $1.3\n\nmillion had been paid for the vessel, but this was wrong. The undisputed facts were that\n\nthe instalments were in arrears when the vessel sailed back to Singapore and was\n\nsubsequently repaired, chartered out, then resold by Kea Resources.36. I found that the defendant had dishonestly caused there to be two\n\nagreements with the intention to retain the difference of $100,000. His scheme did not\n\nbear fruit because Trisakti Utama did not complete paying the instalment payments. It did\n\nnot pay $1.2 million, much less $1.3 million. However, as Trisakti Utama acknowledged that\n\nthe effective agreement was the $1.3 million agreement, whatever rights Kea Maritime had\n\nagainst Trisakti Utama under that agreement were not affected by the forged $1.2 million\n\nagreement. There was therefore no basis for the claim against the defendant.37. In addition to that, any loss in the sale price would be a loss to\n\nthe seller Kea Maritime. Any claim for the $100,000 should be made by Kea Maritime and not\n\nKea Resources.",
        "Claim arising from the sale of the \"Orient VI\"": "38. The facts are somewhat similar to that of the sale of the\n\n\"Regal 8\". The sale was between Kea Maritime as vendor and PT Ersihan Satya\n\nPratama (\"Ersihan\") a company controlled by Teddy Salim, as purchaser. Kea\n\nResources had claimed that the \"Orient VI\" was its vessel, and this was admitted\n\nby the defendant.39. Again there were two sale agreements, one for $685,000 in the\n\npossession of Ersihan and another for $650,000 in the possession of Kea Maritime.40. Teddy Salim acknowledged that the correct price was $685,000 and\n\nthat it was paid by Ersihan, and that his signature on the $650,000 agreement was a\n\nforgery. I accepted his evidence that he had handed a cash cheque of $35,000 to the\n\ndefendant as part of the purchase price. This sum was not paid over to Kea Maritime.41. Kea Resources was the owner of the \"Orient VI\", but Kea\n\nMaritime sold it to Ersihan. Kea Maritime as the vendor, was the party entitled to receive\n\nthe purchase price from the purchaser. The $35,000 was due to Kea Maritime.42. However Kea Maritime was not the claimant. Kea Resources made the\n\nclaim on the basis that it was the owner of the vessel and that it was induced by the\n\ndefendant into believing that the sale price was $650,000.43. In the sale of an asset the owner is notipso factoentitled\n\nto the proceeds of its sale if it is not also the vendor, e.g. the proceeds of sales under\n\nwrits of seizure and sale, sales under Distress Act, sales to enforce\n\nwarehouse-keepers’ liens do not go to the owners.44. Where the vendor and the owner are separate parties,prima facie,\n\nthe vendor is the party entitled to the proceeds. The owner may have a claim to the\n\nproceeds, e.g. if the vendor was selling as its agent, but there must be a basis for its\n\nclaim beyond ownership. Kea Resources had not established that in its claim.",
        "Interest and costs": "45. The plaintiffs should have interest on the judgment they obtained.\n\nIn exercise of my discretion pursuant to s 12 of the Civil Law Act, I fixed the rate at 6%\n\npa and that the interest shall run from 12 February 1999 when the writ was filed to the\n\ndate of judgment. The plaintiffs are entitled to interest after the date of judgment under\n\nthe Rules of Court. I also awarded costs to the plaintiffs, but as they have succeeded on\n\nfive and failed on eleven claims, they should get half the costs.The counter-claims46. The defendant made counter-claims against Kea Resources for\n\npayments due under terms 4 and 5 of the letter of appointment as general manager of Kea\n\nResources4. Annual wage supplement equivalent to one month’s basic salary\n\n  will be given to you for the completion of a year’s service, or pro-rated to the\n\n  number of completed calendar month’s service.5. You will be also entitled to a guaranteed bonus payment of 3 months\n\n  salary subject to the company’s (Kea Resources Pte Ltd) net profit being sufficient\n\n  to cover this payment.47. He complained that he was not paid the annual wage supplement for\n\n1998 and annual bonus from 1993 to 1998. He also claimed that Kea Resources should pay the\n\nemployers’ Central Provident Fund contributions in respect of those payments.48. Kea Resources’ main defence was that the defendant’s\n\nappointment as general manager was terminated by his appointments as director and managing\n\ndirector on 19 July 1993 and 11 August 1993 respectively. It was not alleged that the\n\nparties have agreed to the termination, or even that he was informed of the termination.\n\nKea Resources’ position appeared to be that the appointments as director and general\n\ndirector had the necessary effect of terminating the appointment as general manager.49. There is no legal basis for this supposition. A person can be a\n\ndirector and a manager of a company at the same time. The facts also did not support that.\n\nKea Holdings had written to the defendant to advise him on the revisions to his salary in\n\n1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 as well as his annual wage supplement and bonus payments for\n\nthose years. It was not alleged that he was entitled to these payments under any\n\nappointment other than as general manager.50. The defendant claimed that he was not paid the annual wage\n\nsupplement for 1998. He had computed his entitlement on a basic salary of $9,800, which he\n\nworked out to be $8,166.67 for ten months’ completed service, although there was\n\nevidence that his basic salary was $10,400. I allowed the claim in the sum quantified by\n\nhim.51. On the claim for bonus Kea Resources raised the further defences\n\nthat except for 1993 and 1994 the company incurred net losses and that the defendant was\n\npaid a month’s bonus for 1993 and 1994. Both these defences were supported by\n\ndocumentary evidence. He was therefore awarded the unpaid bonus for those two years in the\n\naggregate sum of $34,000.52. As Central Provident Fund contributions are payable on annual wage\n\nsupplement and bonus payments, Kea Resources should also pay the employers’ portion\n\nof the contributions, together with the interest that would have accrued thereon.53. I awarded the defendant interest on the sum of $42,166.67 awarded\n\nwith interest at 6% pa from 26 March 1999 (the date when the counter-claim was filed). I\n\nalso awarded to the defendant half the costs of the counter-claim to be taxed on the\n\nSubordinate Courts scale. I did not award him full costs because he had not succeeded on\n\nthe whole of his counter-claim.Kan Ting ChiuJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
