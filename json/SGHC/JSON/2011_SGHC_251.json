        "Background Facts": "4       The facts in the present case will be summarised\n                    under the three groups of charges brought against the appellants.",
        "Facts relating to the s 340 charge": "5       The charge here was that Phang and Hoo were\n                    knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business of Sunshine Empire for the\n                    fraudulent purpose of selling certain packages yielding returns when in fact\n                    Sunshine Empire did not operate any substantive profit generating business and\n                    had no sustainable means of funding such returns and they thereby committed an\n                    offence punishable under s 340(5) read with s 340(1) of the Companies\n                    Act. At the trial, the parties agreed to proceed on the basis of an agreed\n                    statement of facts which was admitted under s 376 of the Criminal Procedure\n                    Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed). The agreed facts were set out at length by\n                    the DJ (seePhangWah\n                        (DC)at [7]-[36]) and I need only mention them briefly\n                    here. 6       Sunshine Empire was incorporated on 18 July\n                    2003 as Niutrend International Pte Ltd (“NTI”). From\n                    1 January 2006, Hoo and one Lee Wai Kin acquired the shares from the former\n                    shareholders and were appointed as directors of NTI. On 8 January 2007, NTI\n                    was renamed as Sunshine Empire. The authorised signatories to Sunshine\n                    Empire’s bank accounts were (a) Phang singly or (b) Neo and one Low Wei\n                    Ling (Phang’s personal assistant) jointly. Phang was paid consultancy and\n                    other fees to provide advice on the management and business of Sunshine Empire.\n                    Payment vouchers were prepared by either Low Wei Ling or Chan Jean Yi\n                    (“Jean Yi”) (a member of the accounting staff) and approved by\n                    either Phang or Neo. 7       Sunshine Empire was a multi-level marketing\n                    (“MLM”) business which sold lifestyle packages comprising: (a)     First, a seasonal promotion product\n                        from e-Mall (an e-commerce platform). The only product sold was call-back\n                        services byEM-Call(“EM-Call talk\n                        time”). EM-Call talk time was introduced in June 2007 and was given\n                        to all participants in the Sunshine Empire scheme, even those who had signed\n                        up before the introduction of EM-Call talk time. EM-Call basically\n                        functioned by converting outgoing calls into incoming calls, enabling users\n                        with free incoming call phone plans to reduce their mobile phone charges for\n                        local and overseas calls. Any unused EM-Call talk time purchased under the\n                        prime packages would expire each month. Although EM-Call talk time could be\n                        sold by Sunshine Empire participants to others, participants were unable to\n                        purchase additional EM-Call talk time. (b)     Second,e-Points, which were\n                        exchangeable for cash at the rate of $1.60 per e-Point, subject to an\n                        administration fee of 5 e-Points or 0.5% of the amount converted. Some\n                        conditions on the use of e-Points were as follows: (i)       E-Points could be used to\n                            purchase additional merchant and prime packages at a rate of $1.60 per\n                            e-Point or transferred to the e-Mall account to purchase products on\n                            e-Mall. (ii)       E-Points could be transferred between\n                        participants. (iii)       E-Points could not be converted into mall\n                        points. (iv)       E-Points could not be purchased by participants and could only be\n                            earned through the Sunshine Empire compensation plan (on which, see[8]below) and/or through\n                            Consumer Rebate Privileges (“CRP”) (on which, see[11]below). (c)     Third,mall points, which participants could\n                        use to redeem products from e-Mall platform. Mall points could not be\n                        converted into cash or e-Points and could not be transferred from one\n                        participant to another. Mall points could not be purchased by participants\n                        and could only be earned through the Sunshine Empire compensation plan (on\n                        which, see[8]below) and/or by\n                        purchasing lifestyle packages. (d)     Fourth, from July 2007, participants were also allowed to\n                        sell their products on thee-Mall\n                        platform. 8       The Sunshine Empire compensation plan rewarded\n                    participants with e-Points and mall points for the purchase of lifestyle\n                    packages or for sponsoring others in the purchase of lifestyle packages.\n                    Participants would receive their e-Points and mall points in their Sunshine\n                    Empire bank account (the “e-Bank account”). To purchase the\n                    products, participants had to transfer their mall points and/or e-Points from\n                    their e-Bank account to their e-Mall account. 9       Members of the public became participants of the\n                    Sunshine Empire scheme by registering with Sunshine Empire and being sponsored\n                    by an existing participant. Such participants had to first become a Merchant\n                    Affiliate for a registration fee of 25 e-Points or $40. Merchant Affiliates were\n                    provided with Merchant Agreement contracts. Each lifestyle package was supported\n                    by a 7-day cooling off period from the date of sale, plus a 100% 60-day money\n                    back retail guarantee of satisfaction. From July 2007, a Merchant Affiliate\n                    received a free starter kit and free mentoring by the leaders of Sunshine\n                    Empire. The starter kit contained Sunshine Empire’s business model,\n                    compensation plan and policy guide. 10     A concise summary of the different types of\n                    lifestyle packages available suffices for the purposes of the present judgment.\n                    Briefly, a Merchant Affiliate was entitled to purchase a lifestyle package\n                        (ieBronze Merchant or Silver Merchant; where\n                    necessary, generically referred to as “Merchant package”). If a\n                    Merchant Affiliate purchased a Merchant package, he would be entitled to\n                    purchase prime packages (ieBronze Prime, Silver\n                    Prime or Gold Prime; where necessary, generically referred to as “Prime\n                    package”). The main differences between a Merchant package and a Prime\n                    package were the cost of the packages (the Prime packages being more expensive),\n                    the EM-Call talk time available (the Prime packages offering more EM-Call talk\n                    time) and the entitlement to CRP (only Prime package participants were entitled\n                    to CRP). 11     Some elaboration on CRP is necessary. Phang\n                    and Hoo agreed that CRP was a privilege offered to Prime package participants\n                    and was intended to be an incentive to participants. CRP was paid on a monthly\n                    basis. Between August 2006 and December 2006, the equivalent of CRP was termed\n                    “profit-sharing”; CRP was only adopted as the scheme’s name\n                    in January 2007. In order to ensure compliance with Singapore laws, Phang and\n                    Hoo consulted a lawyer, Francis Goh, on the CRP scheme. Both Phang and Hoo\n                    insisted that CRP was a non-guaranteed payment with the amount payable being at\n                    the discretion of Sunshine Empire. They also confirmed that CRP was funded from\n                    the sale of lifestyle packages, although this fact was not brought explicitly\n                    (if at all) to the attention of the participants of the Sunshine Empire\n                    scheme. 12     Between August 2006 and October 2007, a total\n                    of 25,773 lifestyle packages were sold by Sunshine Empire (2,836 Bronze\n                    Merchant, 4,002 Silver Merchant, 268 Bronze Prime, 1,883 Silver Prime and 16,784\n                    Gold Prime). The prices of the packages were generally on an upward trend over\n                    those months. The total revenue was about $175m and the total CRP payouts were\n                    about $107m. Some US$5.1m were paid by Sunshine Empire as consultancy,\n                    management and event fees to a Hong Kong company in which Phang and one Ignatius\n                    Yong Wai Hong were directors. Sunshine Empire also paid more than US$6.97m to a\n                    company in which Hoo and Neo were directors for the purchase of mall points.\n                    This company paid a third company some US$5.9m for the purchase of EM-call talk\n                    time. Phang and the said Ignatius Yong Wai Hong were also directors of this\n                    third company. In addition, Sunshine Empire made a number of loans to the third\n                    company (almost $16m) and various other interest-free loans to others.\n                    Everything came to a halt after the Commercial Affairs Department\n                    (“CAD”) raided the premises of Sunshine Empire on 13 November\n                    2007.",
        "Facts relating to the s 409 charges": "13     These charges against Phang and Hoo were for\n                    criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) as agents, alleging that the two\n                    men had engaged in a conspiracy to commit such CBT by causing Sunshine Empire to\n                    make payments to Neo on eight occasions totalling S$947,904.88 based on 1% of\n                    the preceding monthly sales, purportedly as a Group Sales Director\n                    (“GSD”), when they knew that Neo was not qualified as a GSD. It\n                    was undisputed that Phang and Hoo had agreed to pay Neo a total of S$947,904.88\n                    and that these monies were paid on 8 occasions,ieon a monthly basis from November 2006 to June 2007. Hoo authorised the issuance\n                    of the 8 cheques and Phang signed the cheques. The payments were recorded as\n                    sales incentives and were based on 1% of Sunshine Empire’s monthly\n                    turnover. According to Phang and Hoo, the payments were made on the basis that\n                    Neo was a GSD of Sunshine Empire. 14     The criteria for appointment as a Sunshine\n                    Empire GSD were specified in the Sunshine Empire starter kit. Briefly, to be\n                    appointed as a GSD, the criteria are “Minimum 10,000 MCF, Promote 3 x\n                    BRM”. MCF referred to Merchant Car Funds and BRM was the abbreviation for\n                    Business Regional Manager. It was also explicitly stated in the starter kit that\n                    the appointee “will have to undergo interview and application is subject\n                    to Sunshine Empire final approval in its discretion”. 15     Phang and Hoo testified that they regarded Neo\n                    as a GSD because she met the qualifying requirements. However, Neo was not told\n                    that she had been appointed as a GSD. Phang testified that Neo’s name was\n                    not selected by the computer system which generated the names of persons who\n                    qualified. In other words, Neo was not recognised by Sunshine Empire’s\n                    computer systems to have the level of sales or the number of managers required\n                    to be a GSD. However, allegedly because Neo had brought in a huge network to\n                    Sunshine Empire, Phang suggested Neo’s appointment to Hoo and Hoo agreed\n                    to regard Neo as a GSD.",
        "Facts relating to the s 477A charges": "16     These charges against Phang and Neo alleged a\n                    conspiracy to falsify the payments made by Sunshine Empire by means of payment\n                    vouchers made out to Phang when the payments were actually meant for Neo. With\n                    regard to the payment vouchers arising from the 1% monthly payments made to Neo\n                    (allegedly as a GSD), Neo suggested that the vouchers should be prepared in her\n                    name for one month and in Phang’s name the following month. Neo confirmed\n                    that she had told Jean Yi from the accounts department that she wanted such an\n                    alternate-month payment arrangement to be done because her income tax liability\n                    was high and she wanted to reduce that liability. She also claimed that she\n                    wanted Phang to declare a higher income for tax purposes in order for him to be\n                    eligible to obtain credit. Six payment vouchers were falsified in\n                all.",
        "The DJ’s decision": "17     17The DJ convicted Phang and Hoo on the s 340 charge for carrying on\n                    the business of Sunshine Empire for a fraudulent purpose as well as on the\n                    s 409 charges for CBT as an agent. The DJ also convicted Phang and Neo on\n                    the s 477A charges of engaging in a conspiracy to disguise six of the\n                    payments (which were the subject-matter of the s 409\n                charges). 18     The appellants were sentenced as\n                    follows: (a)     Phang was sentenced to 4 years 6\n                        months’ imprisonment for the s 340 charge, to imprisonment terms\n                        ranging from 15 to 30 months for the s 409 charges, and a fine of\n                        $10,000 for each of the six s 477A charges. The imprisonment terms for\n                        the s 340 charge and for two of the s 409 charges (24 months and\n                        30 months) were ordered to run consecutively making a total sentence of 9\n                        years and $60,000. The fines have been paid and he is on bail pending these\n                        appeals; (b)     Hoo\n                        was sentenced to 3 years 6 months’ imprisonment for the s 340\n                        charge and to imprisonment terms ranging from 9 months to 24 months for the\n                        s 409 charges. The imprisonment terms for the s 340 charge and for\n                        two of the s 409 charges (18 months and 24 months) were ordered to run\n                        consecutively making a total of 7 years. He is on bail pending these\n                        appeals; and (c)     Neo was sentenced to a fine of $10,000 for each of the six s 477A\n                        charges, making a total fine of $60,000. She has paid the\n                    fines. 19     As mentioned above (at[3]), Phang and Hoo appealed against their respective\n                    convictions and sentences while Neo appealed only against her\n                conviction.",
        "Issues before this court": "20     The issues before this court are as\n                    follows: (a)     Whether Phang and Hoo had knowingly\n                        carried on the business of Sunshine Empire for a fraudulent purpose, in\n                        contravention of s 340 of the Companies Act; (b)     Whether Phang and Hoo had made\n                        unlawful payments to Neo, in contravention of s 409 of the Penal\n                        Code; (c)     Whether\n                        Phang and Neo had, wilfully and with intent to defraud, falsified payment\n                        vouchers in contravention of s 477A of the Penal Code;\n                    and (d)     Whether the\n                        sentences imposed were manifestly excessive (as contended by Phang and Hoo)\n                        or manifestly inadequate (as submitted by the\n                prosecution). 21     It is not in dispute that an appellate court\n                    customarily exercises great caution in evaluating factual findings and will not\n                    interfere with a trial judge’s findings unless they are plainly wrong\n                        (Tan Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor[2008]\n                    1 SLR(R) 1 at [22]). If an\n                    appellate court wishes to reverse the trial judge’s decision, it must not\n                    merely entertain doubts whether the decision is right but must be convinced that\n                    it is wrong (ibid). Bearing this in mind, I turn\n                    now to analyse the first issue.",
        "Section 340 charge": "66     The punishment prescribed for the s 340\n                    charge is provided in s 340(5) of the Companies Act (see[22]above),viz, a\n                    fine not exceeding $15,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or\n                    both. For this charge, the DJ sentenced Phang and Hoo to 4 years 6 months’\n                    imprisonment and 3 years 6 months’ imprisonment\n                respectively. 67     Counsel for Phang and Hoo submitted that the\n                    sentences meted out for the s 340 charge were manifestly excessive for the\n                    following reasons: (a)     First, no loss was suffered by\n                        participants of the Sunshine Empire scheme. (b)     Second, to date, no complaint or law suit has\n                        been filed against Sunshine Empire claiming wrongful loss or\n                    damages. (c)     Third, all\n                        the realisable assets of Sunshine Empire and its associate companies were\n                        seized by the CAD and are now in safe custody. The said assets amounted to\n                        about $21m. Hence, all available funds have been preserved for distribution\n                        to the participants of the Sunshine Empire scheme. (d)     Fourth, there was no evidence that\n                        either Phang or Hoo profited personally from Sunshine Empire’s\n                        business. (e)     Fifth, the DJ erred by finding that the elaborate set-up (brochures,\n                        publicity,etc) of the Sunshine Empire scheme\n                        was an aggravating factor; instead, the elaborate set-up indicated that\n                        Sunshine Empire was a well thought-out and genuine corporate\n                        mechanism. 68     Phang and Hoo also raised arguments specific\n                    to their own culpability and the appropriate punishment. (a)     Phang submitted that he had already\n                        suffered a business failure due to the intervention by the CAD and that the\n                        destruction of his company – the culmination of many years’\n                        effort and ingenuity – was already sufficient\n                    punishment. (b)     Hoo\n                        argued that his culpability was low because he had in fact arranged to meet\n                        the CAD on the day of the raid to discuss the Sunshine Empire business\n                        model. He further pointed out that Phang was the dominant personality and\n                        the mastermind of the Sunshine Empire model, whereas he had always looked to\n                        Phang for guidance. 69     On the other hand, the prosecution submitted\n                    that the DJ’s sentences were manifestly inadequate and that deterrent\n                    sentences would be appropriate in the circumstances here. The prosecution\n                    suggested that the sentences imposed should be way past the median and closer to\n                    the higher end of the prescribed maximum punishment of 7 years’\n                    imprisonment. As an overall view of the aggregate sentences, the prosecution\n                    argued that the individual imprisonment terms should be increased and more such\n                    terms should be made to run consecutively. 70     Looking at everything in perspective, I see no\n                    reason to vary the nature of the sentences or to lower or enhance the sentences\n                    ordered by the DJ. It is clear that Sunshine Empire’s fraudulent business\n                    scheme was propagated on a large scale involving more than a hundred million\n                    dollars from the trusting public. Despite attempts to clothe the scheme with\n                    trappings of legitimacy, such as the e-Mall platform and EM-Call talk time, it\n                    was, shorn of its camouflage, a money circulation scheme without genuine sale of\n                    goods and services. It was marketed primarily as a compensation plan, with high\n                    CRP payouts being the irresistible lure of the scheme. Participants were\n                    carefully steered away from realising that the profits they would be earning\n                    would not come from investments in various projects but were monies injected by\n                    more purchases of packages, whether by new participants or existing ones. There\n                    was a palpable sense that the Sunshine Empire scheme had been designed\n                    specifically to avert and thwart law enforcement. 71     The failure of Phang’s business clearly\n                    cannot be a mitigating factor in the present case because his business is the\n                    precise vehicle through which the fraudulent business was conducted. Also,\n                    despite Hoo’s arguments that his sentence should be far lower than\n                    Phang’s to reflect his lower culpability, it is apparent that Hoo also had\n                    a big part to play in the sophisticated set-up. He was in charge of training\n                    sessions to ensure that Sunshine Empire was marketed as a sustainable,\n                    substantive and legitimate enterprise and was the director having control over\n                    the activities of the company. Even if he had looked to Phang for leadership, it\n                    is clear that he was not merely a passive onlooker or subservient follower in\n                    the fraudulent business. 72     If Phang and Hoo did not gain financially from\n                    the Sunshine Empire scheme over the 15 months or so of its operations, one\n                    wonders why they were in the business in the first place. It would indeed be\n                    highly surprising considering the millions of dollars piling up in the coffers\n                    of Sunshine Empire. The unlawful payments to Neo already added up to almost $1m.\n                    We must also not overlook the huge payments and loans made to their affiliated\n                    companies (see[12]above). Obviously, the\n                    appellants were enjoying the richness of the financial oasis that they created\n                    in the barren desert of Sunshine Empire by luring more and more unwary\n                    participants with the mirage of a highly successful enterprise churning out huge\n                    returns on a regular basis. 73     I also do not think that the sentences are\n                    manifestly inadequate in the sense of being “unjustly lenient”\n                    (see[64]above). As matters stand, no\n                    participant in the scheme appears to have been adversely affected in any way but\n                    that is of course largely due to the pre-emptive and timely intervention by the\n                    CAD. As the scheme grows ever larger and the CRP payouts become impossible to\n                    service, one can see the potential for massive losses to the later participants\n                    as the mirage caused by the Sunshine Empire scheme begins to disappear. On the\n                    totality of the evidence here, the sentences imposed by the DJ struck a good\n                    balance between deterrence and the legal and moral culpability of Phang and Hoo.\n                    The imprisonment terms ordered were already at least half of the maximum\n                    permissible under s 340. On the principles propounded inKwong Kok Hing, I see no cause for enhancing the imprisonment\n                    sentences for Phang and Hoo on the s 340 charge.",

        "The arguments": "59     The DJ found that the falsehood in the six\n                    payment vouchers was clearly established because they were stated in the name of\n                    Phang when they were meant for Neo (PhangWah (DC)at [327]). It was\n                    undisputed that Neo had instructed Jean Yi of the accounts department to make\n                    the payment vouchers in Neo’s name in one month and Phang’s name in\n                    the following month. As Neo herself testified, her purported intention in making\n                    such an arrangement was to reduce her tax liability. 60     Phang and Neo argued that another reason for\n                    making the said arrangement was for part of Neo’s income to go to Phang so\n                    as to avoid Phang’s embarrassment in having a low income despite being the\n                    International President of the Sunshine Enterprise Group of Companies. Indeed,\n                    Phang went so far as to assert in a statement to the CAD (recorded under\n                    s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code on 19 December 2007) that save\n                    for the said arrangement (of falsifying the payment vouchers), he would have to\n                    be “declared $0 income”.[note: 1]",
        "The decision of the court": "61     The DJ was correct in finding that the\n                    falsification of the payment vouchers was a dishonest act intended to lessen the\n                    amount of tax to be paid, thus amounting to defrauding the tax authority\n                        (PhangWah (DC)at [328]). Counsel for Phang and Neo argued on appeal that no evidence was led\n                    on how much tax Neo would be able to save by the device of the false payment\n                    vouchers. The DJ opined that if the purpose had been achieved, “it would\n                    have led to [Neo] paying about less than $21,000 in income tax”\n                        (PhangWah (DC)at [346]), although it is not immediately apparent how that figure was derived.\n                    In this regard, I note that the rate of income tax is between 3-17% for the\n                    first $320,000 of taxable income, with a flat rate of 20% thereafter (see the\n                    Second Schedule of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 2004 Rev Ed)). It\n                    therefore follows that if Phang had a low income or no income whatsoever (as he\n                    claimed, “$0 income”), the falsification of the payment vouchers\n                    and the consequent transfer of income to him would certainly have had the effect\n                    of reducing the overall income tax payable, thereby defrauding the tax\n                    authority. In any case, the explanatory note to s 477A makes it clear that\n                    it is sufficient to assert a general intent to defraud without naming any\n                    particular person intended to be defrauded or specifying any particular sum\n                    of money intended to be the subject of the fraud (see[58]above). 62     I therefore agree with the DJ’s finding\n                    that the falsification in this case was done wilfully and with intent to\n                    defraud. Accordingly, I also dismiss Phang’s and Neo’s appeals\n                    against conviction on the s 477A charges.",
        "Section 409 charges": "74     Section 409 of the Penal Code carries\n                    mandatory imprisonment and, at the time of commission of the s 409 offences\n                        (ie, before the 2008 Revised Edition of the\n                    Penal Code came into force), the maximum imprisonment term was life imprisonment\n                    or a term of up to 10 years (see[46]above). There is also liability to be fined. 75     Phang was sentenced to imprisonment for terms\n                    of between 15 and 30 months on each of the eight s 409 charges, with the\n                    sentences in DAC 7826/09 (30 months) and DAC 7827/09 (24 months) to run\n                    consecutively, making a total of 54 months’ (or 4 years 6 months’)\n                    imprisonment for the CBT offences. Phang did not raise any specific grounds of\n                    appeal against this sentence, relying instead on the general grounds summarised\n                    in[67]above and arguing that the totality\n                    of the imprisonment terms (viz, 9 years’\n                    imprisonment for the s 340 and s 409 charges) was manifestly\n                    excessive. 76     Hoo was sentenced to imprisonment for terms of\n                    between 9 and 24 months on each of the eight s 409 charges, with the\n                    sentences in DAC 7755/09 (24 months) and DAC 7756/09 (18 months) to run\n                    consecutively, making a total of 42 months’ (ie3 years 6 months’) imprisonment. Hoo contended on\n                    appeal that the DJ erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the fact that\n                    Hoo did not obtain any benefit from the transactions and that Neo had deserved\n                    the 1% remuneration by virtue of her vast contributions to Sunshine\n                    Empire. 77     The prosecution submitted that the sentences\n                    were inadequate, pointing out that the amounts involved in the charges ranged\n                    from $51,652.94 to $245,027.05. According to the prosecution, the charges with\n                    the lower amounts should carry imprisonment terms in the region of a few years,\n                    while those with higher amounts should be in the mid-range of the second tier\n                    maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment. Therefore, bearing in mind\n                    what the sentences for each charge ought to be, the prosecution sought to\n                    persuade me that the aggregate imprisonment terms of 4 years 6 months (Phang)\n                    and 3 years 6 months (Hoo) in respect of the s 409 charges were manifestly\n                    inadequate. 78     It is trite that CBT is a serious offence. As\n                    explained in Andrew Ashworth,Sentencing and Penal\n                        Policy(Weidenfield & Nicolson, 1983) at p 194: Where an offence involves a breach of trust, this is generally treated as\n                        an aggravating factor. Its powerful influence is shown by the degree to\n                        which it outweighs factors which would normally go in mitigation. Indeed,\n                        there is a the paradox that some of the strongest factors in mitigation\n                        (unblemished career, model citizen, good employment record) are often\n                        present in these cases and yet do not tell greatly in the offender’s\n                        favour. The reason is that positions of trust are not normally given to\n                        individuals unless they have unblemished references, and so the offence may\n                        be seen as a betrayal of those very characteristics. The individual who puts\n                        himself forward as trustworthy, is trusted by others and then takes\n                        advantage of his power for his own personal ends can be said to offend in\n                        two ways – not only does he commit the crime charged…, but in\n                        addition he breaches the trust placed in him by society and by the victims\n                        of the particular offence. 79     It should further be noted that CBT by a\n                    director of property within his dominion and control merits a significant\n                    sentence since it is a clear abuse of the trust that was reposed in him. This is\n                    reflected in the maximum punishment under s 409 (CBT as an agent) being\n                    much heavier than that under s 406 (simple CBT which carries a maximum of 3\n                    years’ imprisonment, a fine or both). 80     The present case involved an egregious case of\n                    CBT, with a total of $947,904.88 taken from Sunshine Empire over a number of\n                    months from December 2006 to August 2007. These were not one-off lapses but were\n                    part of sustained activity, reducing the funds available to Sunshine Empire. I\n                    do not think that there is any mitigation value in the fact that Neo may have\n                    “deserved” some of the misappropriated amounts because of her\n                    alleged contributions to Sunshine Empire because the extent of Neo’s\n                    contributions was not proved and, more tellingly, because Neo claimed that she\n                    was entitled to the 1% payments as she was Phang’s wife (rather than due\n                    to any alleged “contributions” on her part). 81     I agree with the DJ’s finding that\n                    Phang’s blameworthiness here was higher than that of Hoo (PhangWah (DC)at [338]).\n                    It was Phang who set in motion the CBT offences and the monies were paid to his\n                    wife, Neo. While there was no evidence of Hoo obtaining any personal benefit\n                    from the s 409 offences, Hoo was a director of Sunshine Empire and the\n                    company’s property was clearly within his dominion and control. He abused\n                    the trust reposed in him and the fact that he may not have obtained any direct\n                    personal benefit from his CBT is therefore not of great mitigation\n                value. 82     The DJ ordered a sentence of 30 months (Phang)\n                    and 24 months (Hoo) for the most serious act of CBT involving $245,027.05. She\n                    also ordered the imprisonment terms for two of the most serious charges (for\n                    Phang and Hoo respectively) to run consecutively. In my view, the aggregate\n                    imprisonment terms of 4 year 6 months (Phang) and 3 years 6 months (Hoo) were\n                    neither manifestly excessive nor manifestly inadequate. They were a good measure\n                    of the respective culpability of the two men, considering the period over which\n                    the CBT offences took place, the amount involved and the fact that the offences\n                    would in all likelihood have continued but for the CAD raid. There is therefore\n                    no need to vary the sentences here downwards or upwards.",
        "Section 477A charges": "83     The prescribed punishment under s 477A of\n                    the Penal Code is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or fine or both\n                    (see[58]above). The DJ fined Phang and Neo\n                    $10,000 on each of the 6 charges, totalling $60,000 for each of\n                them. 84     Phang did not raise any specific grounds of\n                    appeal against this sentence, relying instead on the general grounds summarised\n                    in[67]above. As mentioned earlier, Neo did\n                    not appeal against the $60,000 fine which she has paid. 85     The prosecution appealed against the sentences\n                    passed on Phang and Neo, claiming that the DJ erred in (a) placing insufficient\n                    weight on aggravating factors (iethat Phang and\n                    Neo had conspired to falsify the payment vouchers), (b) insufficiently\n                    considering the principle of deterrence, and (c) wrongly holding that the\n                    consequences flowing from Neo’s action (ieto conceal the s 409 offences) were irrelevant in sentencing. The\n                    prosecution suggested that an aggregate imprisonment term of 6 months would be\n                    appropriate for Neo while the overall sentence for Phang (in respect of all the\n                    offences under the Companies Act and the Penal Code) should be enhanced subject\n                    to the then maximum of 14 years’ imprisonment which the district court\n                    could impose at any one trial. 86     As pointed out by the DJ (PhangWah (DC)at [346]), Phang\n                    and Neo did not attempt to conceal the purpose of falsifying the vouchers from\n                    the staff in Sunshine Empire’s accounting department. Further, the\n                    deception was not intended to avoid declaring the whole amount of income or to\n                    declare a lower fictitious amount; all Neo had done was to try to lessen the\n                    amount she had to pay by declaring it under Phang’s name. However, there\n                    would be some loss to the revenue and the falsification of payment vouchers,\n                    like the CBT offences, would in all probability have continued if the CAD had\n                    not intervened to investigate the illusion of the Sunshine Empire scheme. In the\n                    circumstances, I find that the fines imposed by the DJ were neither wrong in\n                    principle nor manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate. 87     Counsel for Phang and Neo argued that 4 out of\n                    the 6 s 477A charges were “not separate, stand-alone or independent\n                    transactions” but were “subordinate to and even steps preparatory\n                    of the s 409 charges” and that once the appellants were punished for\n                    the s 409 offences, it was unnecessary to impose any separate and\n                    substantial punishment for the s 477A offences because there were no\n                    separate or distinct losses. However, it cannot be denied that falsification of\n                    accounts need not always go hand-in-hand with CBT. They are distinct offences.\n                    Here, one could say that the CBT charges relate to the company’s loss\n                    while the s 477A charges relate to the tax authority’s loss. It was\n                    therefore correct that a separate set of punishments be imposed for the\n                    s 477A charges and that Phang should pay the fines in addition to the\n                    sentences for the s 409 charges.",
        "The Sentences": "63     I now deal with the appeals and cross-appeals\n                    against the sentences meted out to the appellants upon their conviction on the\n                    respective charges. Section 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code states: Grounds for reversal of judgment,\n                            etc., of District Court or Magistrate’s\n                        Court. 261. No judgment, sentence or order of a District Court or\n                        Magistrate’s Court shall be reversed or set aside unless it is\n                        shown to the satisfaction of the High Court that the judgment,\n                        acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against the\n                        weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly\n                        excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case. 64     InPublic Prosecutor v\n                        Kwong Kok Hing[2008] 2 SLR(R) 684 (“Kwong Kok Hing”) at [14], the Court of Appeal held that an appellate court will only\n                    interfere with a sentence if: (a)     The trial judge had made the wrong\n                        decision as to the proper factual matrix for sentence; (b)     The trial judge had erred in\n                        appreciating the material before him; (c)     The sentence was wrong in principle; (d)     The sentence was manifestly excessive,\n                        or manifestly inadequate. A “manifestly inadequate” sentence\n                        is one which is “unjustly lenient… and requires substantial\n                        alterations rather than minute corrections to remedy the injustice”\n                            (Kwong Kok Hingat [15], citingPublic\n                            Prosecutor v Siew Boon Loong[2005] 1 SLR(R) 611 at\n                            [22]). 65     With these principles in mind, I turn now to\n                    consider whether the sentences ordered by the DJ ought to be varied in type,\n                    reduced or enhanced, as the case maybe.",
        "Conclusion": "88     In cases where multiple charges are involved,\n                    it is the number of consecutive imprisonment terms that is of ultimate concern\n                    to all involved. The DJ has given appropriate sentences for each category of\n                    offences for the appellants. The aggregate sentences for the appellants also\n                    reflected their culpability and should serve as sufficient deterrence against\n                    such offences. Accordingly, I dismiss all the appeals brought by the appellants\n                    and by the prosecution.
