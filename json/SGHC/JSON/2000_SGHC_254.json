        "…": "24 Bearing in mind the gravity of the offence, we started from the\n\n  position that a paedophile who commits unnatural carnal intercourse (in the form of anal\n\n  intercourse) against young children below the age of 14 years, without any aggravating or\n\n  mitigating factors, should be sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment. There should not\n\n  be any difference whether the victim is a young girl or a young boy. The court would then\n\n  have to consider the aggravating and mitigating factors in increasing or reducing the\n\n  sentence. Second or repeat offenders who are demonstrated to be a menace to society should\n\n  be sentenced to a far longer period. We again emphasise that these sentencing guidelines\n\n  do not necessarily apply to unnatural carnal intercourse between two consenting adults.25 We considered the relevant circumstances of the offence in placing a\n\n  particular offence according to its relative gravity.Circumstances in which the offences are committed:(1)Abuse of trust and authority.Where an offender is\n\n    placed in a position of trust by the parents or by the victims, the breach of trust\n\n    justifies a substantial sentence on the ground of general deterrence. All those who have\n\n    charge of children cannot abuse their positions for the sake of gratifying their sexual\n\n    urges."
