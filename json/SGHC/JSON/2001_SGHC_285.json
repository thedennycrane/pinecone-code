The Plaintiffs were the main contractors and the\n\nDefendants were their subcontractors for that project. The Defendants’ Counterclaim\n\nis in respect of a project at the Sinsov Building where they were again the\n\nPlaintiffs’ subcontractors.5 The Plaintiffs’ application for\n\nsecurity for costs was in respect of the Defendants’ Counterclaim and was made\n\npursuant to Section 388 of the Companies Act or, in the alternative, under O. 23 r. 1 of\n\nthe Rules of Court, principally on the ground that the Defendants were in financial\n\nstraits. There is a pending Petition to wind up the Defendants (CWU 174 of 1999).6 Security for costs at $50,000 was\n\nordered against the Defendants by the Assistant Registrar.7 On 29 August 2001, Judith Prakash J\n\nallowed the Defendants’ appeal against the Assistant Registrar’s decision on\n\nsecurity for costs. On 11 September 2001 (two days before the present appeal), the\n\nPlaintiffs lodged an appeal against the judge’s decision and have instructed Mr\n\nMichael Hwang, S.C. as Counsel for the hearing before the Court of Appeal. I was told that\n\nthe Plaintiffs would be seeking to proceed by way of expedited appeal pursuant to O. 57 r.\n\n20.8 The Plaintiffs submitted that since the\n\nDefendants had admitted that they were in no position to put up security for costs, it was\n\nobvious that should any costs be ordered against the Defendants in the Counterclaim, those\n\ncosts would not be paid. The Plaintiffs accepted that an appeal to the Court of Appeal did\n\nnot operate as a stay of proceedings but argued that they were not seeking such a stay but\n\nwere merely asking the Court to exercise its discretion in the interest of justice so as\n\nnot to render their appeal on security for costs nugatory (Wilson v Church (No.2)(1879-80)\n\n12 ChD 454). They submitted that the trial should therefore not proceed pending the\n\noutcome of their appeal.9 Although the Plaintiffs only took out\n\nthe application for security for costs some 15 months after the filing of the\n\nCounterclaim, they argued there was no inordinate delay and that, in any event, there were\n\nnumerous interlocutory applications during the first half of 2001. The Plaintiffs had also\n\nasked for Further and Better Particulars on 23 October 2000 but no response was made by\n\nthe Defendants until 9 March 2001 and that was to refuse to furnish the particulars\n\nsought. When particulars were finally furnished by consent in May 2001, it was then that\n\nthe Plaintiffs were able to say that the Counterclaim was not a strong one.10 Further, the Plaintiffs argued, they\n\nwould suffer grave prejudice as the action concerned a complex construction matter in\n\nwhich the Plaintiffs would be calling 11 witnesses including an expert and the costs for\n\nthe ten-day trial would be in the region of $120,000, with about eight days to be taken up\n\nby the Defendants’ Counterclaim. In contrast, the Defendants were calling only one\n\nwitness for the entire action. Counsel for the Plaintiffs had also indicated to the\n\nRegistrar at the PTC that they were ready to exchange affidavits of evidence-in-chief\n\nbefore 1 October 2001 but the Registrar stipulated a deadline two weeks earlier. As an\n\nalternative, the Plaintiffs suggested that their claim proceed for trial while the\n\nDefendants’ counterclaim, which was in respect of an unrelated project, be held over\n\nuntil after the appeal.11 Counsel for the Defendants reiterated\n\nthat they were ready with their clients’ affidavit of evidence-in-chief. He informed\n\nme that the winding up petition against the Defendants had been held over for more than\n\ntwo years because the Defendants’ creditors supported that course of action pending\n\nthe Defendants’ counterclaim against the Plaintiffs. He was agreeable to having the\n\ntrial dates pushed back by two weeks but would like all the other directions to remain.THE DECISION OF THE COURT12 I dismissed the Plaintiffs’ appeal\n\nagainst the Registrar’s directions with costs fixed at $500 to be paid to the\n\nDefendants. The Plaintiffs have lodged an appeal against my decision on 25 September 2001.13 InDickson Trading (S) Pte Ltd v\n\nTransmarco Ltd]1989] 2 MLJ 408, the Plaintiffs there applied for an interlocutory\n\ninjunction to restrain the Defendants from disposing of certain shares. Chan Sek Keong JC\n\ndismissed the application. The Plaintiffs then applied for an interim injunction pending\n\nappeal against the dismissal, relying onErinford Properties Ltd & Anor v Cheshire\n\nCounty Council[1974] Ch 261. The judge distinguished cases concerning applications\n\nfor stay of execution of final judgments after full trials from the application before him\n\nwhich was in effect a stay of an interlocutory order. In his view, there was a difference\n\nin substance and not merely in degree between the two situations. He was also of the\n\nopinion that the likelihood of an appeal, if successful, being rendered nugatory, was a\n\nsufficient ground for a stay of execution. However, the judge refused the Plaintiffs the\n\nlimited injunction sought fundamentally because the Plaintiffs’ action, if ultimately\n\nsuccessful, would not be affected by their failure to obtain an interlocutory injunction.14 The Plaintiffs here submitted that\n\nwhile they were not asking for a stay of execution, the principles set out in the above\n\ncase could be relied upon to assist the Court in exercising its discretion whether or not\n\nto vacate the trial dates.15 I do not disagree with the principles\n\nstated but it should be noted that in cases likeDickson Tradingabove, granting\n\nthe interim relief sought would still permit the wheels of litigation to roll on. In\n\ncontrast, the Plaintiffs here were effectively asking that I apply the brakes and park the\n\naction by the wayside (or at least the counterclaim) until such time as the brakes were\n\nreleased by the Court of Appeal. This I was not willing to do in the circumstances of this\n\ncase.16 The Plaintiffs only took out their\n\napplication for security for costs some 15 months after the filing of the Defendants’\n\nCounterclaim. If one reckoned the time from the filing of the Amended Defence and\n\nCounterclaim on 25 April 2000, it would still be 14 months. Even if they were justified in\n\nnot doing so until after Further and Better Particulars had been provided by the\n\nDefendants, they had nevertheless taken some six months from the filing of the Amended\n\nDefence and Counterclaim to ask for particulars. Further, they ought to have known, at the\n\ntime they commenced this action on 1 February 2000 or at least soon thereafter, that the\n\nDefendants were the subject of a winding up petition. They were therefore responsible for\n\nat least a six-month delay.17 In addition, their application for\n\nsecurity for costs has already been considered by a High Court Judge and such an\n\napplication involved an exercise of discretion. There are other interlocutory applications\n\nthe outcome of which could affect the trial process itself; for instance, an application\n\nto make substantial amendments to a claim or an application to call additional evidence at\n\nthe trial. Such applications, decided one way or the other, could be said to prejudice one\n\nof the parties to the proceedings. Yet, in such cases impinging on the trial process\n\nitself, it would be highly unlikely that the Court would either vacate the trial dates or\n\nstop the trial at that stage in order to await the outcome of an appeal. Here, any\n\nprejudice to the Plaintiffs would only arise if the Defendants’ counterclaim was\n\ndismissed with costs. The trial process would not be affected at all. The litigation\n\nprocess would become most unsatisfactory if all such interlocutory applications must first\n\nreceive the attention of the highest Court in our system of justice before the next step\n\ncould be taken.TAY YONG KWANGJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
