        "The case for the prosecution": "4        The prosecution’s case\n\nwas essentially this: that the appellant, as executive director of Sea Consortium Pte Ltd\n\n(‘Sea Consortium’), had received US$90,377 in bribes from one Yu Yong Jun\n\n(‘Yu’), in return for procuring Sea Consortium’s charter of the vessel Da\n\nFu from her owner, Da Lian Marine Shipping Corp (‘Da Lian’).5        Sea Consortium provides\n\nscheduled container feeder services from four hub ports, Singapore, Colombo, Dubai and\n\nMalta, to minor ports within those regions. In order to provide such services, Sea\n\nConsortium charters various vessels. Yu is the managing director of Fortune Glory Pte Ltd\n\n(‘Fortune Glory’), which was the Da Fu’s shipping agent at the material\n\ntime. Together with Da Lian and Far Glory Holdings Pte Ltd (‘Far Glory’), it is\n\na subsidiary of the China-based Da Lian Shipping Group.6        Yu was the key witness for\n\nthe prosecution. He testified that in early June 2000 he knew that the Da Fu would be in\n\nColombo in mid-June without any business. However, he wanted to bring the Da Fu back to\n\nSingapore for dry dock repairs and it was dangerous for the vessel to sail without any\n\ncargo. In these circumstances, he called the appellant, with whom he had been acquainted\n\nsince 1994 through certain shipping industry events, although they only began working\n\nclosely together from June 2000 onwards. He asked the appellant if he could charter the Da\n\nFu so that it could be brought back to Singapore for repairs. The appellant said he would\n\nconsider the matter, and call him back.7        The appellant called Yu one\n\nor two days later. The appellant proposed that Sea Consortium charter the Da Fu for the\n\njourney back to Singapore (‘the voyage charter’), and enter into a one-year time\n\ncharter of the same vessel thereafter (‘the time charter’). The proposed rate\n\nfor the voyage charter was US$3,000 to US$3,200 per day, while that for the time charter\n\nwould be US$5,000 to US$5,100 per day. The appellant added that he required ‘some\n\npersonal benefits’ of US$300 per day for both charters. Yu told him that he could\n\narrange for this. On the same day, he spoke by telephone to the chairman of the Da Lian\n\nShipping Group, one Men Hong Sheng (‘Men’), who was in China. That night, Yu\n\nfaxed Men setting out the details of the arrangement, which was then approved.8        The faxed reply from China\n\nwas not admitted at the trial below as no-one from China came to testify. The prosecution\n\nindicated that Men had been willing to come, but had then fallen ill and decided against\n\ntravelling to Singapore. However, the defence sought to have and did have the faxed reply\n\nadmitted as Exh D6 for the fax transmission details contained therein. Yu testified that\n\nthe original faxes had been lost.9        Subsequently, there were\n\ntwo meetings between Yu on the one hand, and the appellant and his associates on the\n\nother, to discuss the voyage charter and the time charter. The first meeting was on 7 June\n\n2000 at Sea Consortium’s office. The appellant’s associates at this meeting were\n\none Vico Lew (‘Capt Vico’) and one Surajdeep Singh (‘Capt Suraj’), a\n\nline manager at Sea Consortium. A charter rate of US$3,200 was agreed on. No formal\n\nagreement was signed. Instead, Yu tied up the details with the appellant via e-mail. The\n\nsecond meeting was on 15 June 2000. The appellant telephoned Yu asking him to come to his\n\noffice. At this meeting, Sea Consortium’s chartering manager and head of the fleet\n\nmanagement department, one Yong Lin Kong (‘Yong’), was present in addition to\n\nthe appellant and Yu. At this meeting, a rate of US$5,100 per day was agreed on for the\n\ntime charter. A formal agreement was signed. At neither meeting was the US$300 per day\n\n‘personal benefit’ mentioned. Yu said that this was because he understood it to\n\nbe a confidential matter between himself and the appellant.10        The modus operandi for the\n\npayment of the bribes to the appellant was as follows. Yu calculated the first amount due\n\nto the appellant. For subsequent payments, he instructed his subordinate Zhang Li Qin\n\n(‘Zhang’), who was in charge of the financial affairs of Far Glory and Fortune\n\nGlory, to calculate the amounts and prepare the cash for him. Zhang would draw up a\n\npayment voucher and a cash cheque for each amount. In the payment vouchers, the payments\n\nwere described as ‘commission’ for Sea Consortium. Yu paid the appellant in US\n\ndollars, cash, to avoid leaving evidence behind. He made a total of nine payments. Yu met\n\nthe appellant at the Chinatown Point Foodcourt and the Amara Hotel coffee house to make\n\nthe first two payments. For the remaining seven payments, Yu parked his car at Duxton\n\nRoad, near Sea Consortium’s office, and handed the appellant the cash in the car. Yu\n\nsaid that they would then go for drinks or some food, but could not remember where they\n\nwent each time. He also could not remember the precise dates on which the payments were\n\nmade. The dates provided to the court below were mainly based on the dates of the payment\n\nvouchers and the cash cheques.11        Yu would place the cash in\n\nenvelopes to hand over to the appellant. One such envelope was Exh P13. This was the\n\nenvelope used for the second payment. It was recovered from the appellant’s residence\n\nwhen it was raided by officers from the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau\n\n(‘CPIB’). The dates on the envelope, ‘10 Aug – 9 Sep 2000’, were\n\nwritten in Yu’s handwriting and represented the period for the second payment.\n\nHowever, Yu made an error of a day when writing those dates down. They should have been 9\n\nAugust to 8 September 2000.12        Yu created five sham\n\nreceipts for some of the payments. In them, one ‘LC Wong’ was stated to have\n\nreceived ‘address commission’ from Fortune Glory for Sea Consortium’s\n\ncharter of the Da Fu. Yu said that he did not ask the appellant to sign the receipts as he\n\nknew that the appellant would not have done so. Yu did not prepare receipts for the\n\nremaining payments as he was busy with his work and did not have the time to do so.13        Sea Consortium had\n\npreviously chartered the Da Fu’s sister ship, the Da Fa. In April or May 2001, this\n\ncharter ended and was not renewed by Sea Consortium. However, Yu discussed the charter of\n\nanother vessel, the Da Lian, with the appellant around this period. Sea Consortium did\n\neventually charter this vessel at US$6,300 per day. The appellant did not ask for any\n\n‘personal benefits’ this time.14        Two CPIB officers, one Soh\n\nKin Wai and one Lim Yong Seng Vincent, testified that on 25 June 2001 they raided the\n\nappellant’s residence and found four envelopes containing substantial amounts of US\n\ndollars in cash, including Exh P13. They testified further that, when asked, the appellant\n\ntold them that he was keeping the money to invest in a ship.15        Apart from his executive\n\ndirectorship at Sea Consortium, the appellant was also involved in two other companies,\n\nnamely, Joint Fun Investments Pte Ltd (‘Joint Fun’) and Royal Ship Brokering\n\nServices (‘RSS’). The appellant was a part-time consultant for Joint Fun, giving\n\nadvice on ships’ suitability for the feeder market. He had set up RSS jointly with\n\none Chan Yew Thong, an ex-classmate. RSS provided boarding, checker and ship planning\n\nservices to Sea Consortium. When the appellant’s superior at Sea Consortium, one\n\nTimothy Hartnoll (‘Hartnoll’), asked him directly if he was involved in RSS, he\n\ndenied it.",
        "The defence": "16        In his defence below, the\n\nappellant denied that the corrupt payments ever took place. It was Capt Suraj’s idea,\n\nin early June 2000, to charter the Da Fu following his encounter with Yu on board the Da\n\nFa during a routine inspection. Capt Suraj was the line manager in charge of the\n\nSingapore-Colombo-Chittagong service. Yu told Capt Suraj that he had a ship due for\n\nredelivery from the last charterer, and asked if Sea Consortium required a ship. Upon Capt\n\nSuraj’s return to Sea Consortium’s office, he asked the appellant and Capt Vico\n\nwhether they were interested. The appellant asked Capt Suraj to invite Yu to the office to\n\ndiscuss the matter. The telephone call from Yu to the appellant, and the subsequent call\n\nfrom the appellant to Yu to arrange for the US$300 per day ‘personal benefit’ on\n\ntop of the two charters, never took place.17        At the meeting on 7 June\n\n2000, Capt Suraj offered a charter rate of US$3,200 per day. Yu accepted this rate even\n\nthough it was well below the daily market rate of US$5,100 to US$5,500. This was probably\n\nbecause he was desperate and could not find any other charterers for the Da Fu. It was\n\nalready early June and the vessel had to be brought back by mid-June to undergo repairs.\n\nHowever, it would not be particularly dangerous for the Da Fu to be brought back without\n\nany cargo despite the monsoon.18        Capt Suraj was also\n\npresent at the meeting of 15 June 2000 with the appellant, Yu and Yong. Yong joined\n\ntowards the end of the meeting. The main terms of the time charter were subsequently set\n\nout in an email. The charter rate of US$5,100 was well within market range.19        With respect to the dates\n\non the envelope Exh P13, the appellant’s version of events was that they were dates\n\nfor the laycan period of a vessel for potential charter by Sea Consortium. According to\n\nthe evidence of the appellant, Capt Suraj and one Ananda Kumar (‘Capt Kumar’),\n\nYu met with them at the Elvis Pub near Sea Consortium’s office on 21 July 2000 for an\n\ninformal meeting to discuss possibilities for Sea Consortium’s new Singapore-Surabaya\n\nroute. Yu took out Exh P13, which contained ship specifications, and asked the appellant\n\nfor advice on them. The appellant mentioned the laycan period dates required for the\n\nSingapore-Surabaya service. Yu wrote them down on Exh P13. The appellant took Exh P13 home\n\nwith him.",
        "The decision of the district judge": "20        As it was clear to me that\n\nthis appeal involved two completely conflicting bodies of evidence – that of the\n\nprosecution, and that of the defence – I now set out in some detail the district\n\njudge’s reasoning as to her findings on the credibility of the witnesses who\n\ntestified in the proceedings below.21        In evaluating the evidence\n\nof the key prosecution witness, Yu, the district judge bore in mind her prior ruling that\n\nhis role in the factual milieu went beyond that of a mere payor, and consequently fell\n\noutside the scope of s 25 of the Act. Section 25 reads:Notwithstanding any rule of law or written law to the contrary, no\n\n    witness shall, in any such trial or inquiry as is referred to in section 24, be presumed\n\n    to be unworthy of credit by reason only of any payment or delivery by him or on his behalf\n\n    of any gratification to an agent…The district judge found Yu’s account cogent and consistent, and\n\nnot incredible in any aspects. It fitted in with the surrounding circumstances at the\n\ntime, and was in accord with the undisputed factual matrix. Further, she was of the view\n\nthat Yu had been candid in court. He had not sought to hide his own role as an accomplice\n\nin the matter, and had implicated himself fully in the transactions. His evidence was\n\nsupported by the documentary evidence, namely, the fax transmission (Exh P22) and the\n\nenvelope (Exh P13), and corroborated by Zhang’s oral testimony. The district judge\n\nconcluded:Having considered all the aspects,and bearing in mind the caution\n\n    with which to treat his evidence, I found Mr Yu credible, and his testimony reliable.\n\n    [Emphasis added.]22        On Zhang’s testimony,\n\nthe district judge had this to say:On the whole, Ms Zhang’s evidence was factual in nature, and she\n\n    gave a clear account of what happened, without any embellishments. I considered the\n\n    possibility that Ms Zhang was protecting Mr Yu or herself. However, in her evidence, she\n\n    had clearly implicated Mr Yu in the transactions, and she also admitted to her knowledge\n\n    of the bribes. I found that she was a reliable witness, and that her evidence was to be\n\n    given full weight.23        In contrast, the district\n\njudge rejected the defence version of events as portrayed in the accounts of the main\n\ndefence witnesses, namely, the appellant, Capt Suraj and Capt Kumar. She noted that while\n\nthe appellant’s evidence was consistent both internally and with the evidence of the\n\nother defence witnesses, she did not rely much on that in weighing his evidence. Instead,\n\nwhat was critical was that the appellant’s version was unbelievable. While quick to\n\ndissociate himself from Yu and any wrongdoing, the appellant’s own conduct showed\n\nthat they shared a close relationship. The appellant was quick to portray Yu as an\n\nuntrustworthy person out to frame him when there was no basis for doing so. The district\n\njudge therefore found the appellant’s version implausible, and rejected it.24        She also rejected the\n\nevidence of Capt Suraj and Capt Kumar. She found that they both had clear motives to\n\nassist the appellant, in that Capt Suraj was his subordinate and worked closely with him,\n\nand Capt Kumar was dependent on Sea Consortium for business and was an old subordinate of\n\nthe appellant’s. Capt Suraj’s account of the negotiations for the two charters\n\nof the Da Fu was rejected, as was Capt Kumar’s version of the meeting at the Elvis\n\nPub and how the appellant came into possession of Exh P13.25        As such, the district\n\njudge found that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and\n\nconvicted the appellant accordingly.The appeal against conviction",
        "The crux of the appeal": "26        Before me, the appellant\n\nraised the following issues:a whether the district judge was correct in finding that Yu was a\n\n    credible and reliable witness;b whether the district judge erred by failing to give proper weight to\n\n    undisputed facts which rendered improbable Yu’s version that the appellant had asked\n\n    for and received the bribes;c whether the district judge erred in not giving proper weight to the\n\n    evidence of Capt Suraj;d whether the district judge erred in not giving proper weight to the\n\n    evidence of Yong;e whether the district judge erred in rejecting the evidence of Capt\n\n    Kumar; andf whether the district judge erred in not treating Zhang’s\n\n    evidence with sufficient caution.27        The nub of this appeal,\n\ntherefore, was this: whether the district judge was correct in accepting the evidence of\n\nthe prosecution witnesses, principally Yu, and rejecting the evidence of the defence\n\nwitnesses. This was a near-classic case of oath against oath, namely, Yu’s bare\n\nallegation, given that no-one save he himself had actually seen the appellant accepting\n\nthe bribe monies, as against the appellant’s bare denial, corroborated only by\n\nwitnesses who appeared to risk bias given that, as his subordinates and business\n\nassociates, they apparently stood to gain if they testified in his favour.",
        "The law": "28        Fundamentally, this appeal\n\ninvolved an attack by the appellant on the findings of fact made by the district judge. As\n\nsuch, I found it appropriate to revisit the settled principles of law relating to\n\noverturning the trial judge’s findings of fact on appeal. The threshold that must be\n\nreached in order to justify overturning those findings is very high. Section 261 of the\n\nCriminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (‘CPC) provides:No judgment, sentence or order of a District Court or Magistrate’s\n\n    Court shall be reversed or set asideunless it is shown to the satisfaction of the High\n\n    Court that the judgment, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against\n\n    the weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or\n\n    inadequate in the circumstances of the case. [Emphasis added.]InLim Ah Pohv PP[1992] 1 SLR 713, FA Chua J stated:An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are\n\n    clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence,an\n\n    appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the\n\n    witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges’ findings and their reasons\n\n    therefor.[Emphasis added.]29        I endorsed this principle\n\nin an entire line of subsequent cases: see for exampleShamsul bin Abdullah v PP(MA No. 145/2002),Chua Yong Khiang Melvin v PP[1999] 4 SLR 87,Soh Yang Tick v\n\nPP[1998] 2 SLR 42andSundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP[1997] 3 SLR 464. InSoh\n\nYang Tick v PP, I held, specifically in relation to situations where findings of fact\n\ndepend on the credibility and veracity of witnesses, that an appellate court should be\n\nreluctant to overturn the trial judge’s findings. This is simply because the\n\nappellate court is in a less advantageous position as compared to the trial judge, who has\n\nhad the benefit of hearing the evidence of the witnesses in full, and observing their\n\ndemeanour. I then summarised the effect of the governing jurisprudence as follows:The upshot of these cases is that factual findings of\n\n    fact [sic] are prima facie correct and will not be lightly disturbed in the absence\n\n    of good reasons. To do so would be contrary to the function of an appellate court, for its\n\n    duties lie in correcting errors, and not in the reviewing of facts.30        With these principles\n\nborne firmly in mind, I now turn to examine each of the six grounds of appeal, all of\n\nwhich centre on the district judge’s findings of fact with respect to the credibility\n\nof the witnesses and the weight to be accorded their evidence. As the issues relating to\n\ngrounds (c), (e) and (f) are essentially the same, I will deal with them together.",
        "The grounds of appeal": "(a) Whether the district judge erred in finding Yu a credible and\n\nreliable witness31        Before me, counsel for the\n\nappellant asserted that Yu could have been the actual offender. He had fabricated the\n\nfaxes, and his actual forgery of the receipts showed that he had no qualms about\n\nfabricating evidence to pervert the course of justice. Some of his evidence contradicted\n\nthat of Zhang’s; for example, while he had said that he did not count the money that\n\nshe gave him, she had stated that he would do so sometimes. Further, his inability to\n\nrecall where he went with the appellant after the Duxton Road meetings called into doubt\n\nhis evidence that he had actually paid the appellant the bribe monies.32        After thoroughly reviewing\n\nboth the Notes of Evidence of the proceedings below, as well as the district judge’s\n\ngrounds of decision, I concluded that the district judge had clear and cogent reasons for\n\nmaking her findings. First, in relation to treating Yu’s evidence with caution, she\n\nhad firmly kept in view the fact that Yu himself was not completely absolved of\n\nwrongdoing. To make a direct assertion that Yu was siphoning funds off from Fortune Glory\n\nand/or Da Lian in this way was to cast aside completely the district judge’s careful\n\nconsideration of Yu’s evidence, and the demeanour with which he gave that evidence,\n\nat first instance. The allegation that Yu forged the faxes was but a bare allegation given\n\nthat the appellant’s criminal motion was subsequently withdrawn.33        Second, Yu stated in his\n\ntestimony that he did not ask the appellant to sign the receipts because he knew that he\n\nwould not have done so. I did not see that this was such an implausible explanation. In\n\naddition, given the fact that Yu was bribing the appellant in the first place, it would\n\nhave been ludicrous at the very least to expect him to obtain the appellant’s\n\nsignature on those receipts.34        As to Yu’s inability\n\nto recall where he and the appellant went after the Duxton Road meetings, I found that the\n\ndistrict judge had directed her mind to this aspect of his testimony too. She noted that\n\nthe payments stretched over almost a year, and that ‘in such circumstances, it was\n\nreasonable that Mr Yu could not remember where exactly they went to after meeting up at\n\nDuxton Road.’ As the DPP submitted in his written arguments, even if this were an\n\nissue, it was not material to the commission of the offence. The DPP cited the following\n\npassage fromNg Chiew Kiat v PP[2000] 1 SLR 370, where I stated:… the mere fact that the complainant was unable to say with\n\n    certainty when the offences took place would not without more render her entire testimony\n\n    unreliable. Unlike the appellate court, the district judge had the advantage of observing\n\n    the complainant’s demeanour at the stand as she gave her evidence. She found her to\n\n    be a truthful witness. Having perused the records of appeal thoroughly, I could not say\n\n    that the district judge was plainly wrong in her assessment of the veracity of the\n\n    complainant. As such, I would not interfere with her findings.The same reasoning could be applied to the appellant’s contention\n\non the inconsistency of Yu’s evidence with Zhang’s on the point of whether or\n\nnot he counted the money before handing it to the appellant. It was in no way material to\n\nthe offence for which the appellant was convicted.35        I therefore saw no valid\n\nreason for overturning the district judge’s findings with regards to Yu’s\n\ncredibility and reliability as a witness.(b) Whether the district judge had failed to give proper weight to\n\nundisputed facts which rendered Yu’s allegations that the appellant had asked for and\n\nreceived bribes improbable36        The appellant argued\n\nbefore me that the fact that he did not ask for bribes when the Da Fa’s charter came\n\nup for renewal and for the charter of the Da Lian showed that it was improbable that he\n\nhad asked for bribes for the two charters of the Da Fu. I reiterate that the district\n\njudge expressly stated that she found that Yu’s testimony ‘fitted with the\n\nsurrounding circumstances at the time, and was in accord with the undisputed factual\n\nmatrix.’ It could not be said, then, that she didnotgive proper weight to\n\nthe other evidence in making her assessment of Yu’s credibiltiy and his account of\n\nthe events that took place. Whether or not the appellant asked for bribes for the charter\n\nof the Da Lian and the possible renewal of the Da Fa’s charter is entirely irrelevant\n\nto whether or not he committedthisoffence.37        The appellant further\n\nsubmitted that the bribes did not make commercial sense. He also contended that there\n\nwould have been no necessity for Yu to bribe him for the time charter of the Da Fu, since\n\nthere was no evidence that Yu was hard-pressed to find a charterer for the vessel after\n\nits return to Singapore, and given that Hartnoll stated in his evidence that market demand\n\nfor vessels of the Da Fu’s specifications was in fact rising. I was satisfied from my\n\nreview of the notes of evidence that it was clear, given the monsoon season and the\n\npotential danger to the Da Fu if she sailed without cargo, that Yu was prepared to accept\n\na loss. In those circumstances, the bribe was not exorbitantly high. Also, the bribe for\n\nthe time charter was part of Yu’s private agreement with the appellant, concluded\n\nover the telephone in early June 2000.38        With specific regard to\n\nwhether or not it was actually dangerous to sail in the Bay of Bengal during the monsoon\n\nseason, the district judge chose to reject Capt Suraj’s evidence that it was not, and\n\naccepted the version presented by the prosecution that it was. She was perfectly entitled\n\nto do so, and there was nothing in the notes of evidence that persuaded me otherwise. As\n\nsuch, I also found no reason to disturb the district judge’s findings of fact on this\n\nissue. I will deal with Capt Suraj’s evidence in further detail under heading (d)\n\nbelow.(c) Whether the district judge erred in failing to consider Yong’s\n\nevidence39        I found it was true that\n\nthe district judge did not consider Yong’s evidence at length in her grounds of\n\ndecision. However, I was not convinced, after carefully perusing the Notes of Evidence in\n\nrelation to his testimony at the trial, that he could be of any help to the defence. He\n\ncould only testify as to the tail-end of the meeting of 15 June 2002 at which the time\n\ncharter of the Da Fu was finalised. I set out this extract from Yong’s\n\ncross-examination to demonstrate how little he actually knew of the events in this case:Q. When you joined\n\n    the meeting, had parties already agreed on charter rate?A. Yes.Q. Did you get to listen to any of the negotiations on charter rate?A. No.The appellant had therefore shown no valid reason, apart from the mere\n\nfact that the district judge did not dwell at length on Yong’s evidence in her\n\ngrounds of decision, why her findings should be disturbed. Simply put, Yong’s\n\nevidence contributed nothing to the defence case.(d) The district judge’s treatment of the evidence of Capt Suraj,\n\nCapt Kumar and Zhang40        Counsel for the appellant\n\nsubmitted at length in their written arguments on certain factual aspects of Capt\n\nSuraj’s and Capt Kumar’s evidence that they contended showed why the district\n\njudge should have preferred the defence case to that of the prosecution. The root of the\n\ndispute here was in fact, once again, witness credibility.41        The appellant’s\n\nsubmissions with respect to the district judge’s findings on the evidence of these\n\nthree witnesses could be summarised thus. The district judge rejected the evidence of Capt\n\nSuraj and Capt Kumar on the grounds that their evidence was designed to corroborate the\n\nappellant’s own testimony and the defence version of events in general, and that they\n\nhad some motive to generate favourable testimony for the appellant because of their\n\nrespective relationships with him. Capt Suraj was the appellant’s subordinate at Sea\n\nConsortium, while Capt Kumar was a former subordinate who now depended on Sea Consortium\n\nfor business. He also continued to be a regular golf buddy of the appellant’s. The\n\nappellant also took issue with the district judge’s findings on the reliability of\n\nZhang’s evidence, pointing out that the district judge did not apply the same\n\nreasoning to Zhang’s evidence and that she ‘was, after all, Yu’s\n\nsubordinate and would, by a parity of reasoning, tailor her evidence to favour Yu.’42        I did not see any merit in\n\nthese arguments. In her grounds of decision, the district judge did consider Zhang’s\n\nposition in relation to Yu, and the possibility that she might have an incentive to\n\nprotect either herself or Yu. She found that despite that, Zhang had been frank on the\n\nwitness stand and she chose to accept her testimony. As for the evidence of Capt Suraj and\n\nCapt Kumar, my perusal of the notes of evidence disclosed a somewhat rehearsed nature to\n\ntheir testimony. Capt Kumar, for one, appeared very confident that Yu had written laycan\n\ndates on the envelope Exh P13:Q. You said sometime after this, Yu wrote something on it?A. Yes.Q. Did you notice what he was writing?A. I didn’t go close to see. But at that time, the discussion was\n\n    laycan of Singapore/Surabaya Service. So he wrote the laycan mentioned by Captain Wong.Q. Did you see him write down the laycan dates? Are you sure he wrote\n\n    down the laycan dates?A. Yes. I am sure he was writing the laycan dates stated by Wong.Q. Did you see him write down laycan dates?A. As Captain Wong spoke, he was writing down laycan dates.Q. Would I be correct to say you assumed he was writing the laycan?A. No.43        It is apparent even here\n\nthat this exchange seems not to ring true. Moreover, I did not have, as the district judge\n\ndid, the additional benefit of observing these witnesses give testimony during the trial.\n\nCoupled with the fact that in his statement to the CPIB, the appellant claimed not to know\n\nwhat the dates were for, and the appellant’s own performance on the stand during\n\ntrial, the district judge’s finding that Capt Suraj and Capt Kumar both gave\n\ntestimony designed to corroborate the appellant was perfectly reasonable. Again, I saw\n\nabsolutely no reason to disturb the district judge’s findings.",
        "Conclusion on the appeal against conviction": "44        There was no denying the\n\nfact that Yu was not devoid of wrongdoing on his own part in giving the appellant the\n\nbribes and,inter alia, forging receipts in furtherance of that enterprise.\n\nHowever, I found the district judge’s conclusions to be perfectly sound. In the\n\nabsence of any compelling indications to the contrary, and in view of the fact that the\n\ndistrict judge had the distinct advantage , as I did not, of observing the witnesses at\n\ntrial, I was not persuaded that I should disturb any of the district judge’s findings\n\nof fact.The appeal against sentence45        At the hearing before me,\n\ncounsel for the appellant raised the following argument against the sentence imposed by\n\nthe district judge. This argument was not canvassed in the proceedings below. Counsel\n\nargued that the sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment for the nine amended charges had\n\nbeen wrongly imposed as a matter of law, as s 71(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224)\n\n(‘PC’) applied in this case so that asinglesentence should be imposed\n\nfor what was in reality a composite offence. Section 71(1) reads:Where anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which\n\n    parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with the punishment of more\n\n    than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided.46        In support of this\n\ncontention, counsel cited my judgment inZeng Guoyuan v PP (No. 2)[1997] 3 SLR 883. Relying, in the main, on these authorities, counsel sought to persuade me that the\n\nappellant’s receipt of the bribe monies on nine different occasions really\n\nconstituted the reward for a single act of recommending the charter of the Da Fu to Sea\n\nConsortium.47        I found that this argument\n\nhad no merit whatsoever. This was not a case where s 71(1) was applicable. In the\n\npremises, counsel’s argument that the district judge would have imposed a lesser\n\nsentence had she been apprised of s 71(1) was wishful thinking on his part. She was\n\nentitled in law to sentence the appellant to a total of 10 months’ imprisonment for\n\nthe nine amended charges, and in my view she had correctly exercised her discretion to do\n\nso. The total gratification received by the appellant, amounting to US$90,377, was not a\n\npaltry figure.48        As such, I dismissed the\n\nappeal against sentence.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeRepublic of SingaporeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
