        "Background": "4       The\nbackground to the matter is as follows. The plaintiff commenced this\naction, Suit No 369 of 2011, on 20 May 2011. The claim was for a\nsum of $10,138,128.28, which consisted of two parts: (a)     Loss\nof prospective fees for architectural works not carried out amounting\nto $5,626,653.31; and (b)     Fees\nof $4,511,474.97 for certain architectural work carried out. 5       The\ndefendant in turn counterclaimed for the sum of $23,410,000. This\nwas for loss and damage suffered as a result of the plaintiff’s\ndelay in providing the defendant with a letter of release after\nthe defendant terminated the plaintiff’s services. 6       On\n28 July 2011, some two months after the writ was filed, the plaintiff’s\nsolicitors, M/s MPillay (“MPillay”), sent a letter (“the OTS”) to the\ndefendant’s then solicitors, M/s Kelvin Chia Partnership. In it,\nthe plaintiff offered to settle its claim against the defendant\nfor the sum of about $2.6m. The letter stated as follows: The Plaintiff offers to fully and\nfinally settle all of the Plaintiff’s claims, all of the Defendant’s\ncounterclaims and all matters arising in this Suit on the following\nterms: 1.   The Defendant is to pay\nto the Plaintiff the sum of S$2,588,666; 2.   If this Offer to Settle\nis accepted by the Defendant no later than 14 days from today, i.e.\nby 11 August 2011: a)    Parties\nwill bear their own legal costs from the date of commencement of\nthese proceedings on 20 May 2011 to the date of the Defendant’s\nnotice of acceptance (if any); and b)    The Settlement Sum shall be inclusive\nof interest accrued from the date of commencement of these proceedings\non 20 May 2011; 3.    If this Offer to Settle is accepted\nby the Defendant after 11 August 2011: a)    The\nDefendant is to pay to the Plaintiff the Plaintiff’s costs: a.    on\na standard basis, from the date of commencement of these proceedings\non 20 May 2011 to 11 August 2011, b.    on an indemnity basis, from 12 August\n2011 up to the date of the Defendant’s notice of acceptance (if\nany); b)    The\nDefendant is to pay to the Plaintiff interest at 1.5% per annum,\nfor the period from 20 May 2011 up to the date of payment; 4.    Costs\nto be paid pursuant to this Offer to Settle, to be taxed if not agreed;\nand 5.    The Plaintiff is to discontinue its\nclaims against the Defendant, and the Defendant is to discontinue\nits counterclaim against the Plaintiff, within 7 days of payment\nof the sums payable pursuant to this Offer to Settle. 7       On\n8 February 2012, the plaintiff applied in summons no 603 of 2012 for\nbifurcation of the suit to determine the issues of liability and\nquantum in separate trials. The court granted the application on\n7 March 2012. The trial on liability was heard in October 2012.\nOn 26 March 2013, I issued my decision, allowing part of the plaintiff’s\nclaim and dismissed the rest. I also dismissed the defendant’s counterclaim.\nI ordered damages to be assessed by the registrar. 8       On\n22 April 2013, a few days before expiry of the period to file notice of\nappeal against my decision, the defendant’s solicitors, M/s Jimmy\nYap & Co (“JYC”), wrote to MPillay to ask if the plaintiff was“prepared to accept the outcome of the matter without\ntaking the matter further to the Court of Appeal”[emphasis\nin original]. The letter further stated that if the plaintiff was\nprepared to do so, the defendant would also not appeal. MPillay\nreplied on 23 April 2013 stating that “[i]f your client’s proposal\nis made with the intention of avoiding further time and costs, please\nbe reminded that our client’s Offer to Settle remains open for acceptance”.\nThere was no further correspondence on this matter and on 25 April 2013,\nboth parties filed notices of appeal against that part of my decision\nthat found the defendant liable to the plaintiff with damages to\nbe assessed. However the defendant did not appeal against the dismissal\nof its counterclaim. 9       On\n24 September 2013, the Court of Appeal heard the appeals. The plaintiff’s\nappeal was allowed and the defendant’s appeal dismissed. Later that\nsame day, JYC sent to MPillay a document entitled “Notice of Acceptance\nof Plaintiff’s Offer to Settle”. This document (“the NOA”) purported\nto accept the OTS. It stated as follows: The Defendant accepts your Offer to Settle\ndated the 28thday of July 2011 on the\nfollowing terms: 1.    The\nDefendant is to pay to the Plaintiff the sum of S$2,588,666. 2.    The Defendant is to pay to the Plaintiff\nthe Plaintiff’s costs of the Claim and Counterclaim to be taxed\nif not agreed: a)   on a standard basis,\nfrom the date of commencement of these proceedings on 20 May 2011\nto 11 August 2011; b)    on an indemnity basis, from 12 August\n2011 up to the date of this Notice of Acceptance. 3.    The\nDefendant is to pay to the Plaintiff interest at 1.5% per annum,\nfor the period from 20 May 2011 up to the date of payment. 4.    The Plaintiff is to discontinue its\nclaims against the Defendant within 7 days of payment of the aforesaid\nsum of $2,588,666, interest and costs. By a letter dated 25 September 2013 from MPillay to JYP, MPillay\nstated, among other things, that the OTS “remained open for acceptance\nso long as the Court had not disposed of the matter in respect of\nwhich the OTS was made” and as “that had ceased to be the case before\n[the defendant’s] purported acceptance”, the OTS was “no longer\ncapable of being accepted”. There was further exchange of correspondence\nbetween the solicitors on whether the defendant’s purported acceptance\nof the OTS was valid and therefore had compromised the action, but\nsuch correspondence are not relevant for my determination of the\nissue.",
        "The defendant’s submissions": "10     The\ndefendant’s position was that the OTS did not specify a time for acceptance.\nOrder 22A r 3(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed)\n(“ROC”) states that an offer may be withdrawn at any time after\nthe expiry of 14 days from the date of service of the offer on the\nother party, provided that at least one day’s prior notice is given.\nOrder 22A r 3(5) of the ROC provides that, if not withdrawn, the\noffer may be accepted at any time before the court disposes of the\nmatter in respect of which the offer is made. As no such notice\nwas given in this case, it remained open for acceptance at the time\nthe NOA was served. 11     The\ndefendant submitted that, at the time of the NOA, the court had not\ndisposed of the matter in respect of which the OTS was made (O 22A r 3(5)).\nThis was because the OTS was made in respect of the entire suit\nas it dealt with both issues of liability and damages. As at the\ndate of the NOA, 24 September 2013, only the issue of liability\nhad been disposed of. The issue of damages, which remain to be assessed,\nhas not yet been disposed of. 12     The\ndefendant highlighted that the OTS was an offer to “fully and finally\nsettle all of the Plaintiff’s claims, all of the Defendant’s counterclaims and\nall matters arising in the Suit”. While it was a term of the OTS\nthat the defendant was to discontinue its counterclaim against the\nplaintiff, it had become irrelevant by 24 September 2013 because\nthere was no counterclaim for the defendant to discontinue. The\ndefendant further pointed out that, even after the defendant’s counterclaim\nhad been dismissed by the High Court, the plaintiff itself had maintained,\nby way of a letter, that the OTS remained open for acceptance by\nthe defendant. 13     The\ndefendant also submitted that its position made eminent sense. Its\nargument was as follows: (a)     The\ndefendant’s position may be tested by looking at the matter from\nthe plaintiff’s perspective. (b)     Pursuant\nto O 22A r 9(1) of the ROC, where an offer to settle made by a plaintiff: (i)       is not withdrawn and has not expired before the disposal of\nthe claim in respect of which the offer to settle is made; and (ii)       is not accepted by the defendant, and the plaintiff obtains a\njudgment not less favourable than the terms of the offer to settle; (a)     the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to\nthe date the offer to settle was served, and costs on the indemnity\nbasis from that date, unless the court orders otherwise. (c)     Could\nthe plaintiff rely on O 22A r 9(1) of the ROC, and its OTS if it\nwere subsequently awarded damages of more than S$2,588,666 (assuming\nthe OTS was neither accepted nor withdrawn in the interim)? (d)     The\nanswer must be “yes”. Otherwise, the plaintiff would be put in the\nabsurd situation of its OTS being nullified, and losing the advantage\nof making that OTS, simply because the Court had decided on the\nissue of liability first. (e)     More\nimportantly, if the plaintiff was entitled to rely on the OTS when\ndamages are determined, then why could not the defendant accept\nit before that determination? If the plaintiff were to have the advantage\nof the OTS, it must necessarily follow that the OTS remained open\nfor acceptance by the defendant until the issue of damages was determined. 14     The\ndefendant further submitted that its position was consistent with the\npolicy behind offer to settle, and thecontra\nproferentumrule for the following reasons: (a)     The\nwhole object of offer to settle was to spur the parties to bring\nlitigation to an expeditious end without judgment, and thus to save\ncosts and judicial time:Singapore Court Practice\n2009 (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2009)at para\n22A/1/2;Singapore Airlines Ltd v Tan Shwu\nLeng[2001] 3 SLR(R) 439 at [37] (“Singapore\nAirlines Ltd”). (b)     Consistent\nwith this principle, an offer to settle made in a bifurcated action,\nand which dealt with both liability and damages, must remain open\nfor acceptance after liability had been determined but before damages\nwere assessed as a party could not benefit from its offer to settle\nif it were withdrawn before the disposal of the claim in respect\nof which the offer to settle was made: see O 22A r 9(1) of the ROC;\nalso seeMan B&W Diesel S E Asia Pte Ltd\nand another v PT Bumi International Tankers and another appeal[2004]\n3 SLR(R) 267, in which the Court of Appeal held that the appellants\nwere not entitled to indemnity costs because their offer to settle\n(which was valid only for 14 days) had expired before the disposal\nof the claim. In other words, the offer to settle was, according\nto O 22A r 3(4), deemed to have been withdrawn after the 14 days. (c)     Indeed,\none of the benefits of bifurcation was precisely to allow parties\nto settle once liability had been decided. (d)     Further,\nif there were any ambiguity about the meaning of the OTS, the words\nmust be construed against the plaintiff, who made the offer. Not\nonly was this consistent with thecontra proferentumrule, where\nthe words of an ambiguous document will be construed against the\nperson who put them forward: Kim Lewison,The\nInterpretation of Contracts(Sweet & Maxwell, 5th\nEd, 2011) at para 7.08, it was also consistent with the object of\noffers to settle, which was to encourage the speedy termination\nof litigation by agreement of the parties. (e)     Indeed,\nafter the interlocutory judgment, the plaintiff took the position\nthat the OTS remained open for acceptance, which the defendant accepted\non 24 September 2013.",
        "The plaintiff’s submissions": "15     The\nplaintiff’s submissions were threefold: (a)     The\ndefendant’s acceptance was invalid as it did not accept the OTS\non its terms. (b)     The\nOTS was no longer capable of being accepted, as the Court has disposed\nof the matter in respect of which it was made. (c)     The\ndefendant’s conduct in these proceedings ran contrary to, and made\na mockery of the rationale underpinning the offer to settle regime.",
        "(a) Acceptance not on terms\nof OTS": "16     The\nplaintiff first referred toFuyawa Enterprise\nPte Ltd v Lim Han Tee trading as Wifu Marketing[1996]\nSGHC 300 (“Fuyawa Enterprise”) for\nthe proposition that an offeree’s acceptance must mirror the terms\nof the offer to settle. The defendant in that case had accepted\nthe plaintiff’s offer to settle dated 23 September 1995. The disputed\nterm stated that “the Defendant will bear taxed costs of the Plaintiff’s\nclaim and the Defendant’s counterclaim which the Plaintiffs are\nentitled to of this matter to-date”. The High Court recorded consent\njudgment on 3 November 1995, and held that the order for costs was\nfor costs up to 3 November 1995. The defendant sought clarification\non the period covered by the costs order, arguing that costs should\nbe ordered only up to 23 September 1995,ie,\nthe date of the offer to settle. The judge disagreed and held that\nthe expression “to-date” in the offer to settle referred to the\ndate of acceptance and not the date of offer. The judge reasoned\nas follows: It may be unfortunate that the Plaintiffs’\noffer of settlement did not say costs as at the date of acceptance,\nbutin the scheme of things under O 22A of\nthe Rules of Supreme Court, a party must accept the offer in the\nprescribed form. The acceptance by the Defendant in this case was\nnot in the prescribed form. Had he done so he would have been obliged\nto set out the terms in consecutively numbered paragraphs and the\nacceptance would be dated the 3 November 1995.The phrase\n“to-date” in paragraph 5 of the Plaintiffs’ offer must be read to\nmean the date of acceptance and not the date in which the offer\nwas dated asthe offeree’s acceptance must\nnecessarily mirror this termand the date of the acceptance\nmust be 3 November 1995 and not 23 September 1995. … [emphasis added] 17     With\nrespect, I do not see anything in this authority that assists the plaintiff’s\nposition. If anything, it shows that the courts look at the substance\nof the offer and acceptance rather than the strict form when considering\nwhether a purported acceptance is valid. In my opinion, this is necessary\nbecause there is no standard manner of formulating an offer as there\nis an infinite variety of circumstances as well as differing quality\nof drafting. InFuyawa Enterprise,\ndespite the fact that, on the face of a document dated 23 September 1995\nthe offer was for “costs to-date”, the court interpreted this to\nrefer to costs as at the eventual date of acceptance and not the\ndate of the document. 18     The\nplaintiff next referred toIp Yun Ha v Dennis\nWee Realty Pte Ltd[2011] SGDC 15 (“Ip\nYun Ha”) and toRe Desanto et al\nv Cretzman et al53 OR (2d) 732; 1986 CanLII 2663 (“Re Desanto”), a District Court of Ontario decision,\nfor the proposition that an acceptance must be done without any amendment\nor variation and must be unqualified and unconditional. If a party\nqualified its acceptance of the offer to settle, it would amount\nto a counter-offer, not an acceptance. This is correct in principle,\nbut it is a question of fact and law whether the purported acceptance\nis an acceptance of the offer or is a counter-offer. 19     The\nplaintiff submitted that the NOA did not mirror the terms of the OTS\nas it did not make reference to (a) the S$2,588,666 concurrently settling\ndefendant’s counterclaim, and (b) the defendant’s obligation to discontinue\nits counterclaim. The nub of this submission is as follows. The OTS\nrequired the defendant to pay the plaintiff $2,588,666 in full and\nfinal settlement of all the plaintiff’s claims and defendant’s counterclaims\narising in the suit along with certain terms as to costs and discontinuance\nof the claim and counterclaim. Upon expiry of the period for appeal\nagainst the decision to dismiss the counterclaim, such counterclaim\nwas finally determined. The defendant was therefore unable in the\nNOA to mirror the terms of the OTS and state that it was to settle\nboth the claim and counterclaim. Further, the OTS obliged both parties\nto discontinue the claim and counterclaim. However the defendant\nwas not able to discontinue the counterclaim as it had been dismissed\nby the High Court and was made final when the defendant did not\nfile an appeal within time.",
        "(b) OTS no longer capable of\nbeing accepted": "20     The\nplaintiff submitted that the OTS was no longer capable of being accepted\nas the court had disposed of the matter in respect of which it was made,ie, both the claim and the counterclaim,\nin the sense that the counterclaim was already disposed of, even\nthough the quantum of the claim was not. This argument relied on\nan interpretation of the OTS not apparent on its face,ie, that the OTS would no longer be open\nfor acceptance if the claim was finally determined.",
        "(c) Defendant’s conduct contrary\nto offer to settle regime": "21     The\nplaintiff referred toThe “Endurance 1”[1998]\n3 SLR(R) 970 at [41], which citedData General\n(Canada) Ltd v Molnar Systems Group Incand\nCorporation of the Town of Lindsay(1991) 85 DLR (4th)\n392 (“Data General”) for the proposition\nthat the purpose of the offer to settle regime was to “encourage\nthe termination of litigation by agreement of the parties – more\nspeedily and less expensively than by judgment of the court at the end\nof the trial.The impetus to settle is a mechanism\nwhich enables a plaintiff to make a serious offer respecting his\nor her estimate of the value of the claim which will require the\ndefendant to give early (that is, when the offer is served) and\ncareful consideration of the merits of the case” [emphasis in\noriginal]. The plaintiff also citedSingapore\nAirlines Ltdat [37], which stated that the whole object\nof this regime was to “spur the parties to bring litigation to an\nexpeditious end without judgment, and thus to save costs and judicial\ntime”. 22     The\nplaintiff submitted that the defendant’s conduct was contrary to the\nspirit of the regime. Its acceptance was served very late in the proceedings,ie, after a two-week trial, judgment,\nand the hearing and disposal by the Court of Appeal of its subsequent\nappeal, on 24 September 2013. This was more than two years after\nthe OTS had been made,ie, on 28 July 2011.\nThe defendant had refused, contrary to the aims of the offer to\nsettle regime, to “give early and careful consideration” [emphasis\nin original] of the proposed settlement sum in relation to the merits\nof both the plaintiff’s claim and its own counterclaim. The defendant’s\nconduct in these proceedings clearly ran contrary to the rationale\nunderpinning the offer to settle regime. In essence, the defendant was\nseeking to utilise the offer to settle regime after a two-week trial\nof the action and a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, when\nthe OTS, made before the close of pleadings, was designed to avoid\nsuch costs. The defendant’s actions made a mockery of the purpose\nunderpinning the offer to settle regime.",
        "My reasons": "23     To\nunderstand the law relating the offer to settle regime established by\nO 22A of the ROC, it would be instructional to trace its origins.\nI now do so.",
        "Payment into Court": "24     Prior\nto 1993, the Rules of the Supreme Court (the predecessor to the ROC)\nprovided a specific regime under O 22 to make an offer to settle\nwith consequences on costs. That order sets out in detail the manner\nin which parties may make payment into court as an offer to settle\na claim or counterclaim or both. Aside from minor amendments to\nO 22 to insert r 1(7) and to reflect the changes to (a) Form numbers\nas set out in the Rules, and (b) section numbers of the Civil Law\nAct, its present form is unchanged. Order 22 r 1 provides as follows: 1. —(1) In any action for a debt or damages\nany defendant may at any time after he has entered an appearance\nin the action pay into Court a sum of money in satisfaction of the\ncause of action in respect of which the plaintiff claims or, where\n2 or more causes of action are joined in the action, a sum or sums\nof money in satisfaction of all or any of those causes of action. (2)    On\nmaking any payment into Court under this Rule, and on increasing any\nsuch payment already made, the defendant must give notice thereof\nin Form 31 to the plaintiff and every other defendant (if any);\nand within 3 days after receiving the notice the plaintiff must\nsend the defendant a written acknowledgment of its receipt. (3)    A defendant may, without leave, give\nnotice of an increase in a payment made under this Rule but, subject\nto that and without prejudice to paragraph (5), a notice of payment\nmay not be withdrawn or amended without the leave of the Court which\nmay be granted on such terms as may be just. (4)    Where 2 or more causes of action are\njoined in the action and money is paid into Court under this Rule\nin respect of all, or some only of, those causes of action, the\nnotice of payment — (a)    must state that the money\nis paid in respect of all those causes of action or, as the case\nmay be, must specify the cause or causes of action in respect of\nwhich the payment is made; and (b)    where\nthe defendant makes separate payments in respect of each, or any\n2 or more, of those causes of action, must specify the sum paid\nin respect of that cause or, as the case may be, those causes of action. (5)    Where\na single sum of money is paid into Court under this Rule in respect\nof 2 or more causes of action, then, if it appears to the Court\nthat the plaintiff is embarrassed by the payment, the Court may,\nsubject to paragraph (6), order the defendant to amend the notice\nof payment so as to specify the sum paid in respect of each cause\nof action. (6)    Where a cause of action under section\n10 of the Civil Law Act (Chapter 43) and a cause of action under\nsection 20 of that Act are joined in an action, with or without\nany other cause of action, the causes of action under those sections\nshall, for the purpose of paragraph (5), be treated as one cause\nof action. (7)    For the purposes of this Rule, the\nplaintiff’s cause of action in respect of a debt or damages shall\nbe construed as a cause of action in respect, also, of such interest\nas might be included in the judgment, if judgment were given at the\ndate of the payment into Court. 25     Strict\nclarity is required on the terms of any payment into court. Rule 1(4)\nrequires the offeror to specify which of several causes of action\nthe payment is made for and r 1(5) empowers the court to order a\nparty to clarify an ambiguous offer. Rule 6 provides that rules\napply with necessary modifications to a counterclaim. Rule 3(5)\nprovides as follows: Where money is paid into Court by a defendant\nwho made a counterclaim and the notice of payment stated, in relation\nto any sum so paid, that in making the payment the defendant had\ntaken into account and satisfied the cause or causes of action,\nor the specified cause or causes of action in respect of which he\nclaimed, then, on the plaintiff accepting that sum, all further proceedings\non the counterclaim or in respect of the specified cause or causes of\naction, as the case may be, against the plaintiff shall be stayed. These requirements are encapsulated in the prescribed notice\nof payment, Form 31, which requires a statement as to the cause\nor causes of action for which payment is made and whether it includes\nsettlement of the counterclaims. 26     Under\nO 22 r 3 of the ROC, a plaintiff has 14 days from the receipt of the\nnotice of payment, or within 14 days of receipt of an amended notice,\nto accept the payment or amended payment, but such acceptance must\nbe done prior to the commencement of the trial or hearing. After\nsuch commencement of the trial, the plaintiff has two days of receipt\nof notice of payment or amended notice but this must be done before\nthe Judge has begun to deliver judgment. Upon acceptance, all further\nproceedings in the action, or in respect of the causes of action\nand counterclaims, the subject of the payment into court shall be\nstayed – O 22 r 3(4) and (5). 27     It\nshould be noted that O 22 is silent on the situation where a counterclaim\nis finally determined before the claim is determined. As to withdrawal,\nO 22 r 1(3) states that a payment into court “may not be withdrawn\nor amended without leave of the Court which may be granted on such\nterms as may be just” although a defendant may, without leave, give notice\nof an increase to any payment into Court. 28     The\ncost consequences of payment into court are set out in O 59 r 5(a) and r 10(2) of the ROC. Rule 5(a) provides that the Court shall take into\naccount any payment of money into Court and the amount of such payment.\nRule 10(2) states that a plaintiff who accepts money paid into Court\nis entitled to costs up to the time of receipt of the notice of\npayment, unless the Court orders otherwise. 29     In\naddition, O 59 r 3(8) deals with costs of counterclaim in the following\nmanner: Where a plaintiff accepts money paid into\nCourt by a defendant who counterclaimed against him, then, if the\nnotice of payment given by that defendant stated that he had taken\ninto account and satisfied the cause of action or, as the case may\nbe, all the causes of action in respect of which he counterclaimed,\nthat defendant shall, unless the Court otherwise directs, be entitled\nto his costs of the counterclaim incurred to the time of receipt\nof the notice of acceptance by the plaintiff of the money paid into\nCourt. 30     The\npayment into court regime contemplates that the court may take into\naccount money paid into court to settle all or some of the causes\nof action and all or some of the counterclaims. The default position\nis that where a party accepts the payment, he is only entitled to\ncosts up to the time of receipt of the notice of payment. However\nthere is a residual discretion on the part of the court to make\na different order in accordance with the circumstances of the case.",
        "Calderbank offer": "31     A\nsignificant lacuna in O 22 of the ROC is that it is only applicable where\nthe action pertains to the payment of a sum of money. Furthermore, it\nis only available to a defendant, or a defendant to a counterclaim.\nIt is not available where the subject of the dispute did not turn\non payment of a sum of money, or where a plaintiff wished to make\nan offer to settle for a lower sum than what he claimed. Finally\nthis procedure is only available after the writ is filed. The courts\neventually developed an extra-statutory inducement for parties to\nsettle through the exercise of its discretionary powers to order costs. 32Calderbank v Calderbank[1976] Fam 93\n(CA) concerned divorce proceedings in England in which the wife\nsought a declaration that she was the sole beneficial owner of the\nmatrimonial home which she had paid for but was held in the husband’s\nname. The wife had also purchased a house in her name for the occupation\nof the husband’s mother. The court granted the declaration sought\nby the wife and ordered her to make a lump sum payment of £10,000\nto the husband out of the proceeds of sale. The judge made no order\nas to costs. The wife appealed. The English Court of Appeal dismissed\nher appeal on the substantive order. When it came to the wife’s appeal\nagainst the order that each party was to bear its own costs, her solicitor\nasked for guidance of the Court of Appeal in relation to the wife’s offer,\nby a letter from her solicitors marked “without prejudice”, to settle the\nmatter by transferring the house occupied by the husband’s mother which\nwas worth substantially more than the £10,000 the husband obtained.\nThe offer had not been accepted. The Court of Appeal held that as the\nletter was marked “without prejudice”, it could not be brought up\nfor consideration of the court even on the question of costs. Addressing counsel’s\npoint that it was difficult for a party in such a situation to make\nan offer to a claimant in order to save cost, Cairns LJ suggested\nthat it was possible for a party to make an offer which was without\nprejudice to the issue of damages but with the right to be used\non the question of costs. The judge stated as follows (at 105-106): … Mr. Hordern then indicated the difficulty\nthat a party might be in in proceedings of this kind when he or\nshe was willing to accede to some extent to an application that\nwas made and desired to obtain the advantages that could be obtained\nin an ordinary action for debt or damages by a payment into court,\nthat not being a course which would be appropriate in proceedings\nof this kind. There are various other types of proceedings\nwell known to the court where protection has been able to be afforded\nto a party who wants to make a compromise of that kind and where\npayment in is not an appropriate method. One is in proceedings before\nthe Lands Tribunal where the amount of compensation is in issue\nand where the method that is adopted is that of a sealed offer which\nis not made without prejudice but which remains concealed from the\ntribunal until the decision on the substantive issue has been made\nand the offer is then opened when the discussion as to costs takes place.\nAnother example is in the Admiralty Division where there is commonly\na dispute between the owners of two vessels that have been in collision\nas to the apportionment of blame between them. It is common practice\nfor an offer to be made by one party to another of a certain apportionment.\nIf that is not accepted no reference is made to that offer in the\ncourse of the hearing until it comes to costs, and then if the court’s apportionment\nis as favourable to the party who made the offer as what was offered,\nor more favourable to him, then costs will be awarded on the same basis\nas if there had been a payment in. I see no reason why some similar practice\nshould not be adopted in relation to such matrimonial proceedings\nin relation to finances as we have been concerned with. Mr. Millar drew our attention to a provision\nin the Matrimonial Causes Rules 1968 with reference to damages which\nwere then payable by a co-respondent, provision to the effect that\nan offer might be made in the form that it was without prejudice\nto the issue as to damages but reserving the right of the co-respondent\nto refer to it on the issue of costs. It appears to me that it would\nbe equally appropriate that it should be permissible to make an\noffer of that kind in such proceedings as we have been dealing with\nand I think that that would be an appropriate way in which a party\nwho was willing to make a compromise could put it forward. I do\nnot consider that any amendment of the Rules of the Supreme Court\nis necessary to enable this to be done. 33     However\nCairns LJ ruled that the wife was entitled to costs in the court\nbelow because she had made an offer in an affidavit filed in the proceedings\nto transfer to the husband the house occupied by his mother, then\nworth about £12,000. The husband ought to have accepted that offer but\nhe had persisted in the proceedings and recovered a sum smaller\nthan the value of the house. For the proceedings in the court below,\nthe husband was awarded costs up to the date of the affidavit and\nthe wife was awarded her costs from that date. 34     Following\nthis decision, the dictum of Cairns LJ was adopted in matrimonial\nproceedings, in which a party made a written offer to settle “without\nprejudice save as to costs”: seeCutts v Head\nand another[1984] 1 Ch 290 at 302 (“Cutts”).\nSuch letters became known as a Calderbank offer. The English Court\nof Appeal inCuttsconsidered the\nauthorities and held that the Calderbank offer was not restricted\nto matrimonial proceedings. This position was followed in Singapore.\nIf the outcome was less favourable than a Calderbank offer, the\nletter would be shown to the court and taken into consideration\non the question of costs: seeShi Fang v Koh\nPee Huat[1996] 1 SLR(R) 906 at [54]-[55]. 35     However\na Calderbank offer, unlike the statutory regime under O 22 and O 22A\nof the ROC, does not bind the court to award costs in any particular\nmanner but is one factor that the court will take into consideration\nin the exercise of its discretion to award costs: seeSBS Transit Ltd (formerly known as Singapore Bus\nServices Limited) v Koh Swee Ann[2004] 3 SLR(R) 365\n(“SBS Transit”) at [21] and [24].\nFurther, a Calderbank offer is terminated by the other party’s rejection\nof it: seeSBS Transitat [23]. 36     Hence\nit is not surprising that no consistent treatment was given by the\ncourts to Calderbank offers as there is a wide variation in circumstances of\neach case. InLie DjioeBoei alias Lee Yew Wee Executor of the Estate of LioeSoeiTjin alias Liu\nSwee Chin (or Lie SoeiTjin also\nknown as Liu Swee Chin, deceased) v Huang Han Jiang (alias Huang\nHan Jiang)[2000] SGHC 107 at [9], the defendant made\na Calderbank offer near the end of the trial. It was rejected by\nthe plaintiff. The judgment resulted in an outcome that was substantially\nsimilar to the offer and much lower than the plaintiff’s claim.\nThe court took the view that the plaintiff was entitled to some\ncosts and awarded him one-third costs up to the date of the Calderbank\noffer. InColgate Palmolive Ltd and another\nv Markwell Finance and another[1990] RPC 197, the circumstances\nof the defendants’ Calderbank offer was such that it would be inappropriate\nto deprive the plaintiffs of any part of their costs of the action\n(at 201, [25]). The court held that the offer was inadequate in\nthree respects: (a) it was delivered four days (including a weekend)\nbefore the trial in which the plaintiffs’ witnesses had to travel from\nabroad; (b) the letter did not offer all the relief to which the\nplaintiffs were entitled; and (c) the offer related to part of the\nsubject matter of the actions and thus, a settlement on that basis\nwould have no, or no significant, reduction in the time occupied\nby the trial. In contrast, inButcher v Wolfe\nand another[1999] 2 FCR 165, the plaintiff was ordered\nto pay all the costs of the action. The defendant made a Calderbank\noffer to buy out the plaintiff’s interest in the land on a tenanted\nbasis and stated that, if the sum was not acceptable but the basis\nof valuation was agreed, parties should agree on a procedure for\ndetermining an independent valuation. It was met with an outright\nrefusal by the plaintiff because she disagreed with the basis of\nvaluation. In the course of the action, however, she accepted the\noffer, and it was on the basis for which the defendants had always\ncontended and which she had always opposed (at 173). Accordingly, the\nplaintiff had obtained nothing in the action that she could not\nhave obtained more cheaply by accepting the letter (at 178), and\nthe court unanimously upheld the decision below that the plaintiff\nshould pay costs. 37     As\ncan be seen from the foregoing, the court has broad discretion as to\ncosts in assessing Calderbank offers. Generally, the court’s consideration will\nbear on reasonableness or otherwise of an offeree’s refusal to accept\nthe Calderbank offer: seeChrulew and others\nv Borm-Reid & Co[1992] 1 WLR 176 (per Waller J at\n185). This will, as illustrated above, will turn upon the terms\nof Calderbank offer and the specific circumstances surrounding it. 38     The\nCalderbank offer was much more flexible than the payment into court\nprocedure as it was available even before the writ was filed and applicable\nto the plaintiff as well as the defendant. It could also handle circumstances\nthat did not involve cash. An important and practical difference\nbetween a Calderbank offer and payment into court was that the latter\nprocedure required a defendant to actually come up with the money to\nmake the payment into court. This was an inconvenient procedure compared\nto the Calderbank offer, especially at an early stage in the proceedings.\nIn practice, this meant that the payment into court procedure became\notiose as defendants would simply resort to Calderbank offers as opposed\nto coming out with cash at the outset. InCutts,\nOliver LJ cautioned that a Calderbank offer cannot be used as a\nsubstitute for payment into court, stating as follows (at 312): I would add only one word of caution. …\nit should not be thought that this involves the consequence that\n[the Calderbank offer] can now be used as a substitute for a payment\ninto court, where a payment into court is appropriate. In the case\nof the simple money claim, a defendant who wishes to avail himself\nof the protection afforded by an offer must, in the ordinary way,\nback his offer with cash by making a payment in and, speaking for myself,\nI should not, as at present advised, be disposed in such a case\nto treat aCalderbankoffer as carrying\nthe same consequences as payment in. 39     The\ncaution sounded by Oliver LJ was incorporated in the UK Rules of\nthe Supreme Court by the addition of O 22 r 14 in 1986. This rule\ngave legislative effect to the Calderbank offer but excluded from\nits ambit any offer that, at the time it was made, was capable of\nbeing the subject of a payment into court under the same order.\nFollowing the changes to the English rules, a similar change was\nenacted in O 22 r 13 of the Singapore’s Rules of the Supreme Court\nand Rules of the Subordinate Courts in 1992. As with the UK amendment,\nthe Singapore amendment ensured that the “Calderbank letter is only\navailable to a party who could not have protected his position by\npayment into court”: seeJet Holding Ltd and\nOthers v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and Another[2006]\nSGHC 20 at [12].",
        "O 22A: Offer to Settle": "40     In\n1993, the Rules of the Supreme Court and the Rules of the Subordinate\nCourt were amended to include O 22A, which implemented the offer\nto settle regime. At that time, various statutory procedures relating to\noffers to settle were in place in a number of Canadian and Australian states.\nThey included r 37 of the British Columbia Supreme Court Rules, r 49\nof the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure, Pt 22 and Pt 52 r 17 of\nthe New South Wales Supreme Court Rules 1970 and r 26 of the Victoria\nGeneral Rules of Procedure in Civil Proceedings 1986. It was against\nthis backdrop that O 22A was introduced via S 278/93 and S 279/93\nand took effect on 1 July 1993. Importantly, O 22A bore significant\nsimilarities to the provisions in British Columbia, Ontario, New\nSouth Wales and Victoria. For example, except in Victoria, the offer\nto settle procedure applied to all actions (not just monetary claims),\nand was equally available to plaintiffs and defendants: see O 22A\nr 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court and the Rules of the Subordinate\nCourt, r 37(2) of the British Columbia Supreme Court Rules, r 49.02(1)\nof the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure and Pt 22 r 2 of the New\nSouth Wales Supreme Court Rules 1970. Another example was where\na plaintiff, in several of these jurisdictions, wouldprima faciebe entitled to costs on an\nindemnity basis or a solicitor and client basis if he made an offer\nto settle (which was not accepted by the defendant) and the judgment\nhe eventually obtained was not less favourable than the offer: see O 22A\nr 9 of the Rules of the Supreme Court and the Rules of the Subordinate\nCourt, r 49.10(1) of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure, Pt 52 r 17(4)\nof the New South Wales Supreme Court Rules 1970 and r 26.08(2) of\nthe Victoria General Rules of Procedure in Civil Proceedings 1986.[note: 1] 41     As\nthe provisions in British Columbia, Ontario, New South Wales and Victoria\nconstituted important background to the enactment of O 22A of the\nROC, it would be useful to briefly examine their underlying purpose. 42     In\nBritish Columbia, the offer to settle mechanism was established\nas early as in 1977, though in its earliest form, only a plaintiff\nmay “at any time before the commencement of the trial” make an offer\nto settle, and only for an “action for damages”: r 57(13)(a) of\nthe Supreme Court Rules. Even then, the policy articulated in r 57\nwas to “[reward] parties who offer to settle”: seeFSM\nv Clarke et al[2000] BCSC 96 at [7]. However, the limited scope\nin which the offer to settle operated restricted the efficacy of\nthe regime. Thus, in 1984, when the British Columbia Law Reform Commission\nstudied the procedures for offer to settle and payment into court,\nit was concerned with the way the procedures were “impaired by their\nconfinement to liabilities that sound in money” and their inability\nto “be used by an impecunious [defendant]”. Recommendations to broaden the\nscope of the procedures were made, such as providing that the procedure\nfor offers to settle should be open to any party to litigation and for\nboth monetary and non-monetary relief. The British Columbia Law Reform\nCommission also thought that it was “desirable to encourage parties\nto litigation to negotiate in good faith”. To this end, the possibility\nof increased costs following a refusal of a reasonable offer was\nproposed as a solution. If costs could be increased, it would encourage\nparties to consider the merits of their case carefully and to either\nmake an offer to settle or to consider seriously whether to accept\nthe offer to settle: see Law Reform Commission of British Columbia,Report on Settlement Offers(LRC 77, September\n1984). The offer to settle regime went through a major revision. On\n1 April 1993, when the revised r 37 was enacted, the gist of these recommendations\nmaterialised; the revised rule contained cost consequences favouring\na party who made a reasonable offer that was refused by the other\nparty: rr 37(2), 37(23)–(26) of the Supreme Court Rules. 43     Likewise,\nthe Ontario procedure was established with a mind to encourage settlement.\nInData General, Morden ACJO had\nstated (at 398(h)): The purpose of Rule 49 is to encourage\nthe termination of litigation by agreement of the parties - more\nspeedily and less expensively than by judgment of the court at the\nend of a trial.The impetus to settle is a mechanism\nwhich enables a plaintiff to make a seriousofferrespecting his or her estimate of the value of the\nclaim which will require the defendant to give early (that is, when\ntheofferis served) and careful\nconsideration of the merits of the case. … [emphasis\nadded] 44     Insofar\nas r 49 was envisaged to encourage settlement of litigation, the rule\nbore fruit. Within four years of its implementation in Ontario,\nthe fact of “formal offers and their attendant cost consequences”\ncompelled counsel to “[assess] the merits of a claim more quickly\nand more seriously”: see Ian R Stauffer, “Offers to Settle: A Review\nof Recent Developments” [1989] 10 Advoc Q 344 at 344. The success\nof r 49 could, in large part, be attributed to the cost sanctions\nin r 49.10 that brought pressure to bear on the offeree to settle.\nIndeed, because the Ontario High Court of Justice inJacuzzi Canada Ltd v A Mantella & Sons Ltd et\nal(1988) 31 CPC (2d) 195 recognised that the intent\nof the r 49.10 was to induce settlement and avoid trials, it took\nthe view that tinkering with itsprima facieoperation\nwould destroy the predictability necessary for r 49.10 to accomplish\nits purpose. This was echoed by Morden JA inNiagara\nStructural Steel (St Catharines) Ltd v WD LaFlamme Ltd(1987)\n19 CPC (2d) 163 at [11]: … The general, or basic, rule contained\nin r. 49.10(1) is intended to be an incentive to the settlement\nof litigation. While r. 49.10(1) does not set forth the basis for\nresorting to the exception to it, it is reasonable to assume that\nthe occasions for the application of the exception should not be\nso widespread or common that the result would be that the general\nrule is no longer, in fact, the general rule. If this were to happen,\nthe presumption in favour of the general rule and the resulting\nreasonable degree of predictability respecting the incidence of\ncosts would disappear and the incentive policy of the rule would be\nsubstantially frustrated. … 45     Subsequently,\nr 49 of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure formed the basis upon\nwhich the Australian rules were derived and a similar procedure, called\n“offer of compromise”, was adopted in, among other Australian states.\nNew South Wales (Supreme Court Rules 1970, Pt 22 and Pt 52 r 17) and\nVictoria (General Rules of Procedure in Civil Proceedings 1986,\nr 26): seeThe Laws of Australiavol\n5 (5.1–5.6) (Sheryl Jackson, Chris George, BC Cairns & Grant\nT Riethmuller eds) (Thomas Reuters) at para 60; Bernard C Cairns,Australian Civil Procedure(The Law Book\nCompany Limited, 3rd Ed, 1992) at p 376. 46     The\nNew South Wales Court of Appeal inMaitland\nHospital v Fisher (No 2)(1992) 27 NSWLR 721 held that\nthe obvious purpose of legislating cost consequences (with respect\nto the failure to accept a reasonable offer to settle) was to facilitate\nthe proper compromise of litigation by equal measures of a “carrot”\nand “stick”. The court elaborated (at 724(c)): … Relevantly, the “carrot” is the promise\nof indemnity costs to a plaintiff in the event that the defendant\nis found unreasonably to have refused an offer of compromise. The\n“stick” is the threat of the penalty of the imposition of an indemnity\ncosts order against a defendant in such circumstances. It is the obvious\nintention of the rule to oblige a defendant, which has received\nan offer of compromise, to give serious thought to the risk which\nit may run of losing the proceedings and then being ordered to pay\ncosts on an indemnity basis. 47     The\nsame rationale was expressed in Victoria. InMutual\nCommunity Ltd v Lorden Holdings Pty Ltd and others(unreported,\nSC (Vic), No 10561/90, 28 April 1993, BC9303878). Byrne J identified\nthe Court’s policy “to encourage litigating parties to undertake genuine settlement negotiations\nand, for the purpose, to face up to serious offers of settlement”\n(at 12). While Byrne J found that “[t]he response of a litigant\nin receipt of an offer of settlement will always be affected by\nthe prospect that the sum which the Court might order … may be less advantageous\nthan the terms of the offer”, he observed that “this prospect alone\nis not always sufficient to compel a litigant to face up to the\noffer”. As such, “[t]he further prospect of a super-added costs\npenalty if a reasonable offer be not accepted is a salutary inducement\nto an offeree to undertake this often painful task” (at 13). 48     To\nsummarise, the offer to settle procedure in all four jurisdictions had\na common purpose of encouraging settlement. This purpose was effected\nby a common measure of penalising a party who rejected a reasonable\noffer with costs (and correspondingly, rewarding the other party with\nsuch costs). Put another way, the imposition of certain cost consequences\neffectively encouraged settlement by providing parties with a tangible\nincentive to offer to settle and to treat offers to settle seriously. 49     The\nexperiences in these jurisdictions also demonstrated, firstly, the feasibility\nof instituting an offer to settle regime that is considerably broader in\nscope than payment into court or Calderbank offer and, secondly,\nthat having such a regime could save legal costs and judicial time\nin ways that were not possible with payment into court or Calderbank\noffer. Furthermore, the arguments in favour of settlement that underlined payment\ninto court or Calderbank offer would apply with equal force to an offer\nto settle regime. Hence, there appeared to be no reason why Singapore should\nnot similarly introduce a formal procedure for making offers to settle.\nIn fact, there were several advantages O 22A of the ROC had over payment\ninto court and Calderbank offer, and these are concisely laid out\ninSingapore Civil Procedure 2013(G\nP Selvam gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2013) at para 22A/0/2 and\nneeds no repeating here. 50     InSingapore Airlines Ltd, Chao JA set out\nthe policy behind the O 22A procedure in the following terms (at\n[38]): The scheme of things under O 22A is verily\nto encourage the plaintiffs to be realistic in their assessment\nof what they are entitled to and on the part of the defendants,\nto make reasonable offers, on pain of having to bear the costs on the\nindemnity basis if they should persist in their exaggerated claims\nor maintain their unreasonable position (in respect of an offer\nfrom the plaintiff). The order seeks to promote responsible conduct\non the part of both parties. It discourages obstinacy. The wide\ndiscretion given to the court in r 12 is to enable the court to\ntake all pertinent facts and circumstances into account and arrive\nat an order on costs which is fair and just. … 51     There\nis one final point to be made. To the extent that O 22A of the ROC,\nwhen enacted, overlapped with payment into court as a means to initiate\nsettlement, it rendered the latter otiose. This is to be expected\ngiven that O 22A did not require a party making an offer to pay\nmoney into court, and was, on the whole, a more convenient and flexible\nmethod. In the scheme of things, the availability of O 22A as a\ntool to promote settlement meant that payment into court would dwindle\nin significance, although it would still have its uses in other\nareas, such as the payment into court to fulfil a condition for\nobtaining leave to defend. Along with the enactment of O 22A, O 22\nr 13 was repealed and the Calderbank offer was effectively replaced\nby the offer to settle mechanism in O 22A.",
        "Conclusion": "52     Having\ntraced the origin of the O 22A procedure and the policy upon which\nit is founded, I turn to consider the facts of the present case\nin the light of that policy. The following are the salient features\nof the case: (a)Unequal pressure on the parties: The\nwrit was filed on 20 May 2011. The defendant filed its defence and\ncounterclaim on 27 June 2011 and an amended defence and counterclaim\nthree weeks later on 20 July 2011. The plaintiff had made the OTS\nunder O 22A on 28 July 2011. By operation of O 22A r 9, the plaintiff\ncould be entitled to costs on an indemnity basis from that date\nonwards. The action proceeded to trial which lasted some ten days\nand one appeal which was disposed of in September 2013, more than\ntwo years from the date of the OTS. The peril for the defendant\nwas that it could face substantial indemnity costs were the plaintiff\nto recover a sum higher than the amount offered in the OTS. Since\nthe OTS was on the basis that the defendant would pay indemnity\ncosts from 12 August 2011, had the defendant not accepted the OTS,\nit would still be liable for indemnity costs for the proceedings\nto follow, which would be the assessment of damages. The plaintiff,\non the other hand, had no such pressure. It had, at a very early\nstage, been prepared to accept the sum in the OTS. If it did obtain\nmore than that sum at the end of the assessment of damages, the\ncosts advantage it had accrued from 12 August 2011 meant that it\nwould recover a sum that is close to its full legal costs. (b)Plaintiff had full control: The plaintiff\nwas in full control of the situation. It was open to the plaintiff\n(but not the defendant) to withdraw the OTS at any time subject\nto giving one day’s notice under O 22A r 3(2). (c)Terms of OTS determined by the plaintiff:\nMost importantly, the terms of the OTS were the plaintiff’s. It\nwas open to the plaintiff to limit the period of validity or phrase\nit in any fashion but did not do so. 53     The\nnub of the plaintiff’s position is that the OTS had a self-destruct provision.\nBecause the OTS states that the settlement is for “all of the plaintiff’s\nclaims, all of the defendant’s counterclaims and all matters arising in\nthis Suit”, upon the defendant’s counterclaim being finally determined (when\nthe defendant did not file an appeal in respect of the dismissal\nof its counterclaim), the OTS was no longer capable of being accepted.\nThe problem is that this position, even if it is tenable, is not\nexplicit. This means that it is equally possible for the plaintiff\nto argue, if the OTS was not accepted and the plaintiff obtained\njudgment for a more favourable sum, that the OTS had all the time\nremained open for acceptance and asked for indemnity costs all the\nway back to August 2011. Consequently, it means that the defendant\nfaced an uncertain state of affairs, and unfairly so. At the juncture\nwhen the time for appealing on the counterclaim had just passed, it\nwas not wholly clear whether the OTS had expired. If the defendant adopted\nthe position that the OTS had remained valid, it would be compelled\nto seriously consider settlement and the costs consequences of not\ndoing so. If the defendant assumed instead that the OTS had expired,\nit would be taking a chance that the proper interpretation of the\nOTS was that the OTS was still valid and that there would be adverse\ncost consequences for failing to accept it. Either way, the defendant\ncould not have eliminated the possibility that it would be made\nto pay costs on an indemnity basis by virtue of O 22A r 9 of the\nROC. 54     The\nquestion in the end is, faced with an ambiguity, where should the court\ndraw the line. To me, it is clear from the features set out in [52]\nabove that the court should come down in favour of clear drafting\nin terms of unambiguous offers and expiry dates. These factors are\nentirely within the control of the offeror. There should be no scope\nin the O 22A regime for the offeror to turn it into an instrument\nof oppression against the offeree. A party making an offer to settle\nmust state clearly the time within which it is open for acceptance\nif there is to be such a limitation. If the acceptance is to be\nlimited by circumstances rather than a date (eg,\nfirst day of the trial of the action), then it must be stated in\nthe clearest of terms. Any ambiguity will be interpretedcontra proferentem. To hold otherwise\nin this case would be to arm the plaintiff with a double edged sword\nagainst the defendant. 55     Keeping\nin mind that the offer to settle regime was aimed at promoting settlement,\nit is most unfortunate that the OTS in this case had spurred parties\nto further litigate on the offer itself (rather than to settle) because\nthe ambiguity of the terms had attracted conflicting interpretations.\nIn my view, favouring clear and certain terms in an offer to settle\ncan only accord with the policy of encouraging settlement. If an\noffer to settle is to come to an end according to its own terms,\nit is sensible that the terms should be clear enough, such that\nboth parties are able to pinpoint when exactly the offer expires\nand the offeree can make a considered decision on whether, and if\nso, when to accept. 56     The\nplaintiff made three points in its submissions (see [15] above). My\nresponses are as follows: (a)Acceptance not on terms of OTS: I have\npointed out in [17] above thatFuyawa Enterpriseshowed\nthat the court would look at the substance of the offer rather than\nthe strict form when considering whether a purported acceptance\nis valid. If the acceptance is qualified or has conditions attached\nto it such thatit amounts to a counter-offer, then\nit will not be valid, as was held inIp Yun\nHaand inRe Desanto; see\n[18] above. In the present case, there was no qualified or conditional\nacceptance in the way that was envisaged inIp\nYun HaandRe Desanto.\nThis was simply a case where, by the time of the defendant’s acceptance\nof the OTS, the counterclaim had been determined and therefore there\nwas no need for the defendant to undertake to discontinue it. (b)OTS no longer capable of acceptance as counterclaim\nhad been determined: As alluded to in [20] above, this\nargument relies on an implied term that the OTS would no longer\nbe open for acceptance if the counterclaim was settled. I have held\nin [54] above that the OTS will be interpretedcontra\nproferentemand therefore that interpretation is not\navailable to the plaintiff. (c)Defendant’s conduct: I can see nothing\nin the manner in which the defendant accepted the OTS that could\noperate to deprive them of the right to accept the OTS where they\notherwise would be entitled to do so. Order 22A does not impose\nany limitation on the acceptance so long as the offer has not been\nwithdrawn. Indeed the Order envisages acceptance at any time before\nfinal determination. If a party chose to accept near the conclusion\nof the suit it is because that party has deemed it to be in its\nbest interest to do so. It must be remembered that the defendant\nin this case had elected to pay indemnity costs up to the date of\nacceptance even when the possibility was still there that he may\nonly incur standard costs should the final award be less favourable\nthan the offer. So long as the offer has not been withdrawn, and\nthe risk of indemnity costs being incurred continues, there cannot\nbe any reason why the court would disallow acceptance at any stage. 57     For\nthe reasons given above, I held that the OTS had not expired on 24 September 2013\nand it was therefore validly accepted by the defendant on that date.\nAccordingly I gave the declarations prayed for in this summons.  [note: 1]Rule 37(23) of the British\nColumbia Supreme Court Rules provided for “double costs” (instead\nof costs on an indemnity or a solicitor and client basis)."
