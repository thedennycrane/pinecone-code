        "(21 June 2000)": "\"1. We refer to the above matter and our letter of 16thJune\n\n  2000.2. We are instructed to file in the High Court the action for specific\n\n  performance and alternatively to recover damages suffered arising therefrom.3. Your client in DC 21/2000/G and MC 8588/2000/Y are therefore related and\n\n  should be consolidated to avoid multiple duplicate proceedings arising from the same matter.4. In this context, would your client agree to let the High Court case be a\n\n  test case and that the order be applicable accordingly to the other two matters.5. As for DC 21 of 2000/Y, will your client consent to our client application\n\n  to set aside the judgment entered on 15thMarch 2000 or your clients agreement to\n\n  the above be subject to our client succeeding in setting aside the judgment?6. We appreciate your reply within 7 days from date hereof.\"14 The Defendants solicitors replied on 27 June 2000 as follows:\"1. We refer to your letter dated 16 June 2000 and 21 June 2000.2. In view of your clients conduct and all the correspondence, the\n\n  allegation that our client is in breach of the settlement agreement is outrageous. Our client has\n\n  not breached the settlement agreement, and there is, therefore, no duty to mitigate.3. Be that as it may, we note your clients allegations that there are\n\n  outstanding documents, and that they are prejudiced from discovering the origin of the goods. We\n\n  also note from Gabriel Peter & Partners letter dated 17 December 1998 that copies of the\n\n  documents were handed to you, and that your letter dated 29 December 2000 clearly shows that your\n\n  clients had accepted the documents.4. In the circumstances, is all this just to obtain another set of the\n\n  documents? If so, despite the fact that our client has discharged all his obligations, we will\n\n  provide your client with another set of the documents.5. That is our clients position. Beyond that, we see no point in\n\n  corresponding further on this subject, parties are clearly set to litigate. We will leave it to\n\n  the court to adjudicate on this case. Our clients will proceed in accordance with their legal\n\n  rights.6. As for your suggestion to use the High Court case as a test case, the\n\n  proposal is unacceptable. Our client has had enough of your clients dilatory conduct, and there\n\n  is simply no way of ensuring that your client will proceed expeditiously.7. If a High Court action is commenced, and preservatory orders are sought, you\n\n  are hereby put on notice that we object to any applications being made ex-parte.8. For the avoidance of doubt, all our clients rights are reserved including\n\n  the right to dispute the appropriateness of commencing a High Court action.\"15 Before me, Mr Peter Pang stated that if the said customs clearance documents\n\nwere handed over to him, he would withdraw the present action. He was compelled to commence this\n\nsuit because of the Defendants solicitors insistence that they had been handed over when they\n\nwere not.16 He argued that the Plaintiffs allowed the five judgments to be entered in the\n\nSubordinate Courts because the Plaintiffs wished to affirm the settlement agreement despite the\n\nDefendants breach. Since they were so affirming, they were obliged to pay and their right to sue\n\nfor damages had not been waived or abandoned in any way.17 The Defendant responded by stating that although no inventory list of all the\n\ndocuments was prepared, the Plaintiffs had not complained about the customs clearance documents\n\nbeing missing until March 2000 when a Writ of Seizure and Sale was taken out in DC Suit 21 of 2000.THE DECISION OF THE COURT18 Comparing the documents in the five actions in the Subordinate Courts and\n\nthose in the present suit, it was clear to me that the Plaintiffs present suit was nothing more\n\nthan a repetition of the same issues which had been put to rest by the Plaintiffs decision to\n\nallow judgment to be entered in any of the five suits.19 By submitting to judgment and paying the instalments, the Plaintiffs had\n\nacknowledged that the instalments were due under the settlement agreement. They could not have been\n\ndue if the exchange of documents was not done or was not completed satisfactorily. They were\n\ntherefore estopped in all the circumstances of this case from alleging that the exchange was\n\nincomplete. In any event, the formal exchange was not carried out due to the Plaintiffs fault.20 The Plaintiffs could not decide when and where they would raise matters when\n\nthose matters had already been put in issue in earlier proceedings and, in this instance, many times\n\nover. If they chose not to contest the Defendants actions or to allow the summary judgments\n\ntherein to stand, they could not now attempt to shake the factual foundation on which those\n\njudgments rest. The instalments stage was premised upon the exchange stage having been completed\n\nsatisfactorily. If the exchange stage had not been so, it was incumbent on the Plaintiffs to\n\nchallenge that the instalments were due at all or at least to insist that any judgment entered\n\nreflect the status of the exchange. By electing not to do so, they could not now be permitted to\n\nrake up what had been interred with their consent or knowledge.21 If any breach of the settlement agreement had taken place, it was on the part\n\nof the Plaintiffs. It was their lackadaisical attitude in carrying out the terms that threw\n\neverything out of the order intended. They could not now be permitted to sue on what was essentially\n\ntheir own wrongdoing. The present claim was therefore devoid of merit in any case.22 I therefore allowed the appeal and granted the Defendant the orders sought. I\n\nfixed the costs of the entire action payable by the Plaintiffs to the Defendant at $3,500.",
