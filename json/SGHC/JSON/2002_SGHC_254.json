        "Civil Procedure": "– Subpoenas served on a person to attend as a\n\nwitness in an inquiry – Whether the subpoenas should be set asideFactsThis was an appeal by Mr Tay Swee Sze who was served with asubpoena\n\n  ad testifidandumas well as asubpoena duces tecum, both of which were issued\n\n  at the instance of the second defendant in Originating Summons No. 939 of 1991. Mr Tay\n\n  applied to set aside the subpoenas, but his application was refused by the assistant\n\n  registrar. Mr Tay then appealed against that decision.Mr Tay was a partner in the firm of Arthur Anderson in 1996 when the first and second\n\n  defendants in OS 939 of 1991 were ordered by the judge to produce an account of all the\n\n  assets of the Estate of Ong Seng King. The first defendant appointed Arthur Anderson on 8\n\n  November 1996 with instructions to review all documents and records belonging to the\n\n  Estate and to prepare a report to assist her to comply with the order of court.Counsel for Mr Tay conceded that Mr Tay was then the partner-in-charge\n\n  of that matter at the material time, but argued that the firm’s file and all the\n\n  responsibilities relating to the file was transferred to another partner, Mr Tam Chee\n\n  Chong, who had since taken the matter with him to his new firm, Deloitte & Touche.\n\n  Counsel said that no relevant documents are currently in Arthur Anderson. Counsel also\n\n  argued that the subpoena was not necessary and immaterial to the matter at hand. He\n\n  submitted that Arthur Anderson had never been engaged by the second defendant to act in\n\n  the matter. The second defendant was merely riding \"piggyback\" on the first\n\n  defendant’s affidavits for the purposes of complying with the order of court. Counsel\n\n  asserted that the Writ of Subpoena must be utilised for the production of relevant\n\n  evidence and that the court has jurisdiction to set aside the subpoena because the\n\n  intention of the party issuing the subpoena was not to obtain relevant evidence, but\n\n  rather, on the basis of an improper motive.Held, dismissing the appeal:The subpoena should not be used frivolously or in a scandalous manner,\n\n  that is, to cause to be issued indiscriminately without any basis or reason so as to\n\n  embarrass or inconvenience the person subpoenaed. Such occasions have been extremely rare.\n\n  A person who has been served with a subpoena ought not to take out a separate application\n\n  to put the issuing party to justify the issuance of the subpoena except in the clearest\n\n  cases. (See [6])In the present case, Mr Tay was the partner-in-charge of the file at\n\n  Arthur Anderson at the material time from November 1996 to June 2000. The file was then\n\n  handed over to Mr Tam. On this fact alone, the second defendant was justified in calling\n\n  Mr Tay to testify at the inquiry. The affidavit of Mr Tay, which was filed confirming this\n\n  fact, and his previous affidavits producing copies of the accounts of the estate justify\n\n  his attendance in court. In the end, his oral evidence may not be of much benefit to any\n\n  party, but the same can be said of many a witness. The ultimate value of the witness is\n\n  not the gauge to determine whether he ought to be subpoenaed. (See [7])The subpoenas were therefore not unreasonably issued. It is open to Mr\n\n  Tay to testify, when called, that he has no further or other documents in his possession,\n\n  and cross-examined on his testimony. These are all matters rightfully in the domain of the\n\n  judge at the substantive hearing. (See [7])A third party cannot be compelled to give discovery of any document in\n\n  his possession merely because it may be relevant to an issue in the case, but he is\n\n  amenable to the process of thesubpoena duces tecumprovided it is limited to\n\n  evidence that is both material and admissible. The material sought in this case are\n\n  clearly material and appears to be admissible. These concern the documents relating to the\n\n  assets and accounts of the estate of Ong Seng King, which is the subject of the\n\n  inquiry.(See [8]).Case(s) referred toMacmillan Inc. v Bishopgate Investment Management PLC (No. 1)[1993]   4 All ER 998 (refd)JudgmentGROUNDS OF DECISION1.        This was an appeal by Mr\n\nTay Swee Sze who was served with a subpoena to attend as a witness in the Inquiry\n\npresently held before the assistant registrar Mr Phang Hsiao Chung. Mr Tay, through his\n\ncounsel, applied to set aside the subpoena but his application was refused by Mr Phang;\n\nand it was against that refusal that Mr Tay appealed before me. The subpoena was issued at\n\nthe instance of the second defendant in this Originating Summons, No. 939 of 1991.2.        Mr Tay was a partner in\n\nthe firm of Arthur Anderson in 1996 when the first and second defendants in this\n\nOriginating Summons were ordered by the judge to produce an account of all the assets of\n\nthe Estate of Ong Seng King. The first defendant appointed Arthur Anderson on 8 November\n\n1996 with instructions to review all documents and records belonging to the Estate and to\n\nprepare a report to assist her to comply with the order of court.3.        In the appeal before me,\n\nMr Chandra Mohan appeared on behalf of Mr Tay. He conceded that Mr Tay was then the\n\npartner-in-charge of this matter at Arthur Anderson at the material time. However, he\n\nargued that the firm’s file was transferred to another partner, Mr Tam Chee Chong who\n\nhad since taken the matter with him to his new firm Deloitte & Touch. Mr Mohan said\n\nthat no relevant documents, including documents perused or considered in preparing\n\nreports, work sheets, notes and memoranda relating to this file are currently in Arthur\n\nAnderson. Counsel submitted that in addition to transferring the file to Mr Tam Chee\n\nChong, all the responsibilities relating to the supervision of the file and the conduct of\n\nwork relating to it had also been transferred to Mr Tam.4.        Counsel argued that the\n\nsubpoena issued by the second defendant against Mr Tay was \"not necessary and\n\nimmaterial to the matter at hand\". He submitted that Arthur Anderson had never been\n\nengaged by the second defendant to act in the matter of the estate of Ong Seng King. It\n\nwas asserted that the second defendant was merely riding \"piggyback\" on the\n\nfirst defendant’s affidavits for the purposes of complying with the order of court\n\nthat was directed at both defendants (at that time the third and fourth defendants had not\n\nbeen joined).5.        Mr Mohan said that the\n\nWrit of Subpoena must be utilised for the production of relevant evidence and that the\n\ncourt has jurisdiction to set aside the subpoena because the intention of the party\n\nissuing the subpoena was not to obtain relevant evidence, but rather, on the basis of an\n\nimproper motive. Counsel relied on the English case ofMacmillan Inc. v Bishopsgate\n\nInvestment Management PLC(No. 1) [1993] 4 AER 998 in support. The test propounded by\n\nthe English court for ordering a non-party witness to produce a document in litigation is\n\nto see whether the order could be \"necessary for disposing of the cause or matter or\n\nfor saving costs\". Mr Mohan deprecated the use of the subpoena for the purpose of\n\n\"fishing for evidence\".6.        The subpoena should\n\nobviously not be used frivolously or in a scandalous manner, that is to say, to cause to\n\nbe issued indiscriminately without any basis or reason so as to embarrass or inconvenience\n\nthe person subpoenaed. Such occasions have been extremely rare, in my experience. On the\n\npresent facts I see no need to make any further qualifications or rules judicially by way\n\nof guidelines in the use of the subpoena. In my view, persons who have been served with a\n\nsubpoena ought not to take a separate application to put the issuing party to justify the\n\nissuance of the subpoena except in the clearest cases.7.        In the present case, Mr\n\nTay was the partner-in-charge of the file at Arthur Anderson at the material time from\n\nNovember 1996 to June 2000. The file was then handed over to Mr Tam. On this fact alone,\n\nthe second defendant was justified in calling Mr Tay to testify at the inquiry. There is\n\none the face of the record, namely the affidavit of Mr Tay, filed confirming this fact,\n\nand his previous affidavits producing copies of the accounts of the said estate, to\n\njustify his attendance in court. In the end, his oral evidence may not to be of much\n\nbenefit to any party, but the same can be said of many a witness. The ultimate value of\n\nthe witness is not the gauge to determine whether he ought to be subpoenaed. TheMacmillancase concerned thesubpoena duces tecum. The witness there was already in court and\n\nin the midst of cross-examination when the subpoena was issued against him for the\n\nproduction of certain transcripts of a private inquiry. In the present case, Mr Tay was\n\nissued with asubpoena ad testificandumas well as asubpoena duces tecum.\n\nIn the circumstances outlined above, the subpoenas were not unreasonably issued. It is\n\nopen to Mr Tay to testify, when called, that he has no further or other documents in his\n\npossession, and cross-examined on his testimony. These are all matters rightfully in the\n\ndomain of the judge at the substantive hearing.8.        As Millet J said inMacmillan’s\n\ncase (ibid., page 1002), a third party cannot be compelled to give discovery of any\n\ndocument in his possession merely because it may be relevant to an issue in the case, but\n\nhe is amenable to the process of thesubpoena duces tecumprovided it is limited to\n\nevidence that is both material and admissible. The material sought (if Mr Tay still has\n\nthem) are clearly material and appears to be admissible. These concern the documents\n\nrelating to the assets and accounts of the estate of Ong Seng King, which is the subject\n\nmatter of the present inquiry before Mr Phang.9.        For the reasons above, the\n\nappeal was dismissed.Sgd:Choo Han TeckJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
