        "Did the contract of carriage require production of the bill of lading for delivery of\n\ncargo?": "10. The submission made on behalf of Mr Voss was that it is a firmly\n\nestablished principle of law in the mercantile world that in a contract for the carriage\n\nof goods by sea, delivery of the cargo is to be made at the discharge port by the carrier\n\nto the consignee only upon the production by the consignee of the original bill of lading.\n\nThis principle is implied into all contracts for the carriage of goods by sea. In support\n\ncounsel cited the well known observation of Lord Denning that ‘It is perfectly clear\n\nlaw that a ship-owner who delivers without production of the bill of lading does so at his\n\nperil. The contract is to deliver, on production of the bill of lading, to the person\n\nentitled under the bill of lading’. SeeSze Hai Tong Bank v Rambler Cycle Co. Ltd[1959] 25 MLJ 200at 201.11. APL’s reply was that Lord Denning’s observation and\n\nsimilar remarks made by other judges applied only to the situation where the bill of\n\nlading issued was a ‘to order’ bill of lading. If the bill made the goods\n\ndeliverable to a specific person as consignee and did not contain any words importing\n\ntransferability, the carrier’s duty was simply to deliver the goods to the consignee\n\non proof of identity. The carrier would not need to obtain the original bill of lading (or\n\nany one of the original bills of lading) from the consignee in order to make delivery. It\n\nwas common ground that the bill issued by APL was not an order bill since the consignee\n\nbox contained Seohwan’s name only.12. The basic issue therefore to be considered was whether when it came\n\nto delivery, there was a distinction between the delivery of goods covered by a bill of\n\nlading that was made out ‘to order’ or ‘to bearer’ and commonly known\n\nas an order bill of lading and one that specified the name of the consignee without the\n\naddition of the words ‘to order’ or ‘assigns’. This latter type of\n\nbill of lading has been referred to variously as a ‘non-negotiable’ bill of\n\nlading, a ‘straight consigned’ bill and a ‘straight bill’. In this\n\njudgment I will call it a straight bill.13. This issue was last considered by this court inOlivine\n\nElectronics Pte Ltd v Seabridge Transport Pte Ltd[1995] 3 SLR 143, where the facts\n\nwere practically identical with the facts here. In that case, the plaintiffs were the\n\nshippers of a cargo of colour television sets which was carried by the defendants on board\n\nthe vesselLeewardfrom Singapore to Vostochny, Russia. A company called Orient\n\nPlus was named as the consignee and the notify party in the bill of lading. On arrival of\n\nthe cargo at Vostochny, it was delivered by the defendants to Orient Plus without\n\nproduction of the bill of lading. The plaintiffs, who had not been paid, sued the\n\ndefendants for the price and took out an application for summary judgment. The defendants\n\nresisted and the Assistant Registrar granted them conditional leave to defend. Both\n\nparties appealed and the appeal came on for hearing before Goh Joon Seng, J. The appeal\n\nwas dismissed.14. In his grounds of decision, Justice Goh noted that the\n\ndefendants’ argument had been that the principle of law enunciated by Lord Denning in\n\ntheRambler Cyclecase only applied to bills of lading which were made out ‘To\n\norder’ or ‘to bearer’ and did not apply to a ‘straight consigned\n\nbill’ which was one with a named consignee. In support they had relied on a passage\n\nfrom the fourth edition of Benjamin’sSale of Goods(18-010). The plaintiffs\n\non the other hand had relied on dicta fromEvans & Reid v Cornouaille[1921] 8 LLR 76 where Hill J had stated the master of a vessel could not deliver cargo to a\n\nconsignee named in a bill of lading without production of the original bill.15. Justice Goh reached no concluded decision on the issue. In the\n\nevent, the point was not finally decided in that case because the defendants were unable\n\nto furnish the security ordered and the plaintiffs consequently signed judgment in\n\ndefault. Interestingly enough, the law firms representing the plaintiffs and defendants inOlivine Electronicswere the same law firms who represented Mr Voss and APL\n\nrespectively before me and, having been given the opportunity to revisit this issue, they\n\ndid so quite exhaustively.16. The first decision that supported Mr Voss’ arguments wasThe\n\nStettin[1889] 14 PD 142. The plaintiff there shipped goods in London on board a\n\nGerman vessel belonging to the defendants, under a bill of lading, drawn in two parts by\n\nwhich the goods were to be delivered at a German port to the consignee named in the bill\n\nof lading or to his assigns. The master delivered the goods at the port of discharge to\n\nthe consignee without the production of either part of the bill of lading. It was held by\n\nButt J that according to English law (which he held to be the same as German law on the\n\npoint) and the English mode of conducting business, a shipowner was not entitled to\n\ndeliver goods to the consignee without the production of the bill of lading and that the\n\ndefendants had to take the consequences of having delivered the goods without production\n\nof either of the two parts of which the bill of lading consisted. Although the bill of\n\nlading in that case was to the named consignee or his assigns thus making it an order\n\nbill, the learned Judge did not distinguish in his judgment between an order bill and a\n\nstraight bill. This is significant since in the submissions before the court this\n\ndistinction had been drawn and it had been strongly argued that under German law in the\n\ncase of a bill of lading with a named consignee, the contract of carriage would be\n\nfulfilled by delivering the goods to such named consignee without calling for the bill of\n\nlading, as the master would have had in his possession the ship’s copy of the bill of\n\nlading bearing the name of such consignee. That the Judge chose to use the term\n\n‘consignee’ in his judgment instead of ‘holder’ or\n\n‘presenter’ of the bill of lading was a firm indication that he considered that\n\neven a named consignee had to produce one part of the bill of lading in order to obtain\n\ndelivery. In the 13thEdition ofCarver’s Carriage by Seapublished\n\nin 1982,The Stettinwas cited for the proposition that delivery to the consignee\n\nnamed in the bill of lading does not suffice to discharge a shipowner where the consignee\n\ndoes not hold the bill of lading. See 1593.17. TheCornouailledecision came in 1921, some 32 years later.\n\nIt appears from the report thatThe Stettinwas not cited to Hill J. His views\n\nwould therefore appear to reflect a general understanding of the law at the time. He\n\nstated:‘In this case the plaintiffs shipped at Cardiff a cargo of coal on\n\n  board the French steamshipCornouaille, under a Bill of Lading for delivery at\n\n  Nantes to the plaintiffs' order. The plaintiffs shipped the coal under a contract of sale\n\n  entered into with the Cie. Charbonnire d'Armement et Transbordement Maritimes, of Paris,\n\n  the terms of sale being a price f.o.b., cash against documents. The documents were\n\n  presented to the buyers, and were not taken up. The Bill of Lading was still in the hands\n\n  of the plaintiffs, in whom the property in the coal remained. In this state of\n\n  circumstances, the defendants' agents at Nantes and the Master of the ship delivered the\n\n  coal to the Socit Union Charbonnire et Mtallurgique, taking a receipt upon the\n\n  Master's copy of the Bill of Lading, and obtaining from the Socit Union payment of the\n\n  freight.…The fact that the coal was intended to be delivered to the Socit\n\n  Union did not entitle the Master to deliver to anybody without production of the Bill of\n\n  Lading. It would not have entitled him to deliver even if the Socit Union had been the\n\n  consignees named in the Bill of Lading. It is said that the plaintiffs ought to have\n\n  informedthe defendants that the buyers of the coal had not taken up the documents.\n\n  There is no such duty upon the plaintiffs. The transaction between the buyers and the\n\n  plaintiffs had nothing to do with the shipowners. The latter were only concerned with the\n\n  fulfilment of their Bill of Lading contract, and the plaintiffs were entitled to rely upon\n\n  this, that the ship would not give delivery of the goods until the Bill of Lading, with\n\n  the plaintiffs' endorsement upon it, was presented to the Master.’ (emphasis added)18. That such an understanding existed was also reflected in the first\n\ninstance decision ofThrige v United Shipping Company Ltd[1923] 16 Ll.L. Rep 198\n\nwhich concerned a bill of lading made out to a consignee. Rowlatt J in coming to a\n\ndecision in favour of the plaintiff shipper of the goods stated:‘The bills of lading were in favour of the consignee; they were\n\n  made in duplicate and the shipper got both parts, keeping one set and sending the other to\n\n  the bank in London. … The retaining of the bills of lading is important, as it\n\n  retains to the plaintiff the property or control of the goods so that he might have the\n\n  right to bring an action. The position in regard to a steamship company would be clear. A\n\n  bill of lading is a protection to them; they deliver goods and take back the document on\n\n  which they are responsible to produce the goods and so they are safe: but it is known to\n\n  everybody that the shipper may keep a bill of lading as this shipper did and not hand it\n\n  over to the person to whom the goods are sent until he is paid; and therefore the\n\n  shipowner owes a duty to the shipper not to hand over the goods until there is production\n\n  of the bill of lading.’In this case, the shipper had sued the agent of the shipowner rather\n\nthan the shipowner himself and, on appeal, Rowlatt J’s decision was reversed on the\n\nbasis that there had been no contract between the shipper and the shipowner’s agent.\n\nIn the Court of Appeal, Scrutton LJ observed that it was not necessary for the purposes of\n\nthe appeal to decide the question as to whether when a bill of lading is made to a\n\nconsignee and the property passes on shipment, the shipowner who delivers to the named\n\nconsignee without production of the bill of lading is or is not guilty of any breach of\n\ncontract. He went on, however, to state that ifThe Stettindecided that there was\n\nsuch a duty it might require reconsideration (at [1924] 18 Ll.L. Rep 829). So far as I am\n\naware Scrutton LJ’s comment is the only instance in which the correctness ofThe\n\nStettinhas been judicially doubted.19. Then came theRambler Cyclecase in 1959 where Lord Denning\n\nmade the statement relied on by Mr Voss. APL says that that was a case of an order bill\n\nand therefore Lord Denning’s comments should be looked at in that context. The\n\ncomplete passage from Lord Denning’s judgment reads:‘It is perfectly clear law that a shipowner who delivers without\n\n  production of the bill of lading does so at his peril. The contract is to deliver, on\n\n  production of the bill of lading, to the person entitled under the bill of lading. In this\n\n  case, it was \"unto Order or his or their assigns\" that is to say, to the order\n\n  of the Rambler CycleCompany, if they had not assigned the bill of lading, or to\n\n  their assigns, if they had. The shipping company did not deliver the goods to any such\n\n  person. They are therefore liable for breach of contract unless there is some term in the\n\n  bill of lading protecting them. And they delivered the goods, without production of the\n\n  bill of lading, to a person who was not entitled to receive them. They are therefore\n\n  liable in conversion unless likewise so protected.’ (at p 201)It is clear from the above that as far as Lord Denning was concerned,\n\nthere was a general rule that delivery was to be made only on production of the bill of\n\nlading to a person entitled under the bill and that in the situation of an order bill the\n\ndelivery had to be made in accordance with the orders of the shipper. Nothing Lord Denning\n\nsaid can be read as restricting the principle he enunciated to the situation of the order\n\nbill only.20. The next famous passage on this issue is the oft quoted statement\n\nof Lord Justice Diplock inBarclays Bank Ltd v Commissioners of Customs and Excise[1963] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 81:‘The contract for the carriage of goods by sea, which is evidenced\n\n  by a bill of lading, is a combined contract of bailment and transportation under which the\n\n  shipowner undertakes to accept possession of the goods from the shipper, to carry them to\n\n  their contractual destination and there to surrender possession of them to the person who,\n\n  under the terms of the contract, is entitled to obtain possession of them from the\n\n  shipowners. Such a contract is not discharged by performance until the shipowner has\n\n  actually surrendered possession (that is, has divested himself of all powers to control\n\n  any physical dealing in the goods) to the person entitled under the terms of the contract\n\n  to obtain possession of them.So long as the contract is not discharged, the bill of lading in my\n\n  view, remains a document of title by indorsement and delivery of which the rights of\n\n  property in the goods can be transferred. It is clear law that where a bill of lading or\n\n  order is issued in respect of the contract of carriage by sea, the shipowner is not bound\n\n  to surrender possession of the goods to any person whether named as consignee or not,\n\n  except on production of the bill of lading (seeThe Stettin, (1889) 14 P.D. 142).\n\n  Until the bill of lading is produced to him, unless at any rate, its absence has been\n\n  satisfactorily accounted for, he is entitled to retain possession of the goods and if he\n\n  does part with possession he does so at his own risk if the person to whom he surrenders\n\n  possession is not in fact entitled to the goods.(at pp 81-89)It can be seen from that passage that Diplock LJ was endorsing the\n\nlegal principle enunciated inThe Stettinthat it is a breach of contract to\n\ndeliver the goods otherwise than in return for an original bill of lading and did not\n\nshare the doubts as to its correctness evinced by Scrutton LJ.21.The ‘Houda’[1994] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 541 was a\n\ndecision of the English Court of Appeal on a dispute arising out of the invasion of Kuwait\n\nby Iraq. One of the main issues involved there was whether time charterers could lawfully\n\nrequire shipowners to discharge cargo loaded on board their vessel without production of\n\nthe bills of lading. In the course of answering this question in the negative, the three\n\njustices of appeal expressed their views on a shipowner’s obligation in regards to\n\ndelivery of cargo covered by a bill of lading. Neill LJ said (at p 552):‘I can see no good reason to depart from the general rule that the\n\n  owners do not fulfil their contractual obligations if the cargo is delivered to a person\n\n  who cannot produce the bill of lading. Of course if such a delivery is made and the person\n\n  to whom the cargo is delivered proves to be the true owner no damages would be\n\n  recoverable.’Leggatt LJ agreed with that view stating that under a bill of lading\n\ncontract a shipowner is obliged to deliver goods upon production of the original bill of\n\nlading and delivery without production constitutes a breach of contract even when made to\n\nthe person entitled to possession (at p 553). The third member of the court, Millett LJ\n\nwhile citing theRambler Cycleand theBarclays Bankcases to support the\n\nprinciple that under a bill of lading contract, the shipowners are obliged to deliver\n\ncargo only against presentation of a bill of lading, went further than his brethen in\n\nascribing the reason for this principle to be the fact that, a bill of lading being a\n\nnegotiable receipt for the cargo, once the master had signed it and part with it he would\n\nhave subjected the owners to a contractual obligation, enforceable at the suit of any\n\nperson to whom the bill had been negotiated, to deliver the cargo to that person. Millett\n\nLJ was therefore specifically dealing with a negotiable bill of lading but the views of\n\nthe other two judges were not so circumscribed.22. Now I must deal with two decisions by Justice Clarke in the English\n\nAdmiralty Court. The first,The Sormovskiy 3068[1994] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 266, was\n\ndecided in January 1994. TheSormovskiy 3068was chartered to the plaintiffs to\n\ncarry a cargo of sugar. The plaintiffs subsequently acquired the original bills of lading\n\nfor the cargo which were delivered to them endorsed in blank. The vessel then arrived at\n\nthe port of discharge and began discharge without the knowledge or consent of the\n\nplaintiffs. None of the three original bills of lading was presented to the master before\n\ndischarge began and by the time the plaintiffs learnt about the discharge and stopped it,\n\nabout 2,070 tonnes of sugar had been discharged. The plaintiffs claimed against the\n\ndefendants as owners of the vessel for the loss sustained by reason of delivery of 2,070\n\ntonnes of sugar without presentation of an original bill of lading.23. It was held by Clarke J inter alia that:(1) the defendants correctly accepted that under the bill of lading\n\n  they were obliged to deliver the goods to the person entitled to possession of it; since\n\n  the bill was expressed to be ‘to order’, those persons were the plaintiffs as\n\n  holders of the bill of lading because it had been endorsed in blank.(2) subject to the terms of the contract and save in exceptional\n\n  circumstances a shipowner must not deliver the goods otherwise than against presentation\n\n  of an original bill of lading unless it was proved to his reasonable satisfaction both\n\n  that the person seeking the goods was entitled to possession of them and that there was\n\n  some reasonable explanation of what had become of the bills of lading.In coming to the conclusions stated above, Clarke J undertook a survey\n\nof the existing authorities includingBarclays Bank,Rambler Cycle, The Stettin,andThe ‘Houda’. He observed (at p 272) :‘None of those cases is my judgment inconsistent with the\n\n  plaintiffs’ case, namely that subject to the terms of the particular contract and\n\n  save in exceptional circumstances, a shipowner must not deliver the goods otherwise than\n\n  against presentation of an original bill of lading. That seems to me to be implicit in the\n\n  express provision quoted above that any one of the bills of lading being accomplished the\n\n  others to stand void. In my judgment it is implicit in that provision that, save perhaps\n\n  in exceptional circumstances, one would expect of the bills to be ‘accomplished’\n\n  by being presented to the master or a shipowner. The above quotation from the judgment of\n\n  Lord Denning in theSze Hai Tongcase suggests that he would have taken the same\n\n  view. I observe that in Cooke on Voyage Charters at p. 387 the authors cite that case as\n\n  authority for the proposition that‘… the bill of lading, by implication if not expressly, makes\n\n    the goods deliverable upon, and only upon, the surrender of the bill of\n\n    lading.’\"Clarke J also stated that he preferred the plaintiffs’ submissions\n\nbecause they appeared to be consistent with the tenor of the authorities and to make more\n\ncommercial sense as:‘It makes commercial sense to have a simple rule that in the\n\n  absence of an express term of the contract the master must only deliver the cargo to the\n\n  holder of the bill of lading who presents it to him. In that way both the shipowners and\n\n  the persons in truth entitled to possession of the cargo are protected by the terms of the\n\n  contract.’ (at p 274)Although Clarke J was dealing with an order bill, it is clear from his\n\njudgment that he considered these principles on delivery to apply to all bills and not\n\nonly to order bills.24. In the next case,The ‘Ines’[1995] 2 Lloyd’s\n\nRep 144, decided in March 1995, the plaintiffs were the owners of telephones shipped to\n\nSt. Petersburg under a bill of lading naming one company as consignee and another as the\n\nnotify party. The cargo was released by the port authorities, acting as agents for the\n\nshipowner, to the notify party without presentation of an original bill of lading to\n\nthemselves or to anyone else before delivery. Clarke J held that the shipowners were\n\nliable to the plaintiffs for breach of contract because the goods had been delivered\n\nwithout presentation of an original bill of lading. In reaching this conclusion, he did\n\nnot draw any distinction between an order bill and a straight bill.25. The Malaysian High Court too has accepted the principle that it is\n\na breach of contract for a shipowner to deliver cargo without the production of the bill\n\nof lading even when delivery is made to the consignee. See ‘The Taveechai\n\nMarine’[1995] 1 MLJ 413.26. There are also several academic writers who believe that the above\n\nis the correct position. Among these is William Tetley who in the third edition of his\n\nwell known textMarine Cargo Claimsstates (at p 985) ‘if goods are delivered\n\nto someone who does not present the original bill of lading, even if that person is the\n\nnamed consignee, the carrier will be responsible for any resulting loss. In common law\n\njurisdictions, the carrier would be liable for tort for conversion …’. In para\n\n1.4.1 ofBills of Lading and Bankers’ Documentary Creditsby Paul Todd, it is\n\nstated that when a bill of lading is made out to a named consignee, he alone may validly\n\npresent it to obtain the goods from the vessel and in the 20thEdition ofScrutton\n\non Charterparties and Bills of Ladingat page 292 the following passage appears:‘The shipowner or master is justified in delivering the goods to\n\n  the first person who presents to him a bill of lading, making the goods deliverable to\n\n  him, though that bill of lading is only one of a set, provided that he has no notice of\n\n  any other claims to the goods, or knowledge of any other circumstances raising a\n\n  reasonable suspicion that the claimant is not entitled to the goods. If he has any such\n\n  notice of knowledge, he must deliver at his peril to the rightful owner, or must\n\n  interplead. He is not entitled to deliver to the consignee named in the bill of lading,\n\n  without the production of the bill of lading, and does so at his risk if the consignee is\n\n  not in fact entitled to the goods.’The 10thEdition ofSchmitthoff’s Export Trade(published\n\nin 2000)echoed (at pp 290-292) the view expressed in the 9thEdition\n\nthat even a bill of lading which was not negotiable operated as a document of title\n\nbecause the named consignee could only claim the goods if able to produce the bill of\n\nlading.27. I now turn to the authorities cited by APL to justify their\n\nposition. APL relied on three fairly recent cases and various passages fromCarver on\n\nBills of Lading(1stEd, 2001) which equate a straight bill of lading with\n\na sea waybill when it comes to obligations relating to delivery of cargo. A sea waybill is\n\nthe maritime version of a document that has long been in use in the context of land and\n\nair carriage. It operates as a receipt for goods received for shipment and evidences the\n\ncontract of carriage. One significant difference between it and a bill of lading is that\n\nit is never ever a negotiable instrument and is therefore usually used on short sea routes\n\nand where neither the shipper nor the cargo receiver needs to pledge shipping documents in\n\norder to raise finance. It is not issued in sets and the receiver is able to take delivery\n\nof the goods merely by establishing his identity. The original sea waybill need not be\n\nproduced. Further, since it is not a bill of lading the Hague Rules and the Hague Visby\n\nRules do not apply to it. SeeContracts for The Carriage of Goodsedited by David\n\nYates.28.Carver on Bills of Ladingtakes the position that straight\n\nbills and sea waybills are actually one and the same thing. This is because a straight\n\nbill, like a sea waybill, is not a document of title since it cannot be used to transfer\n\nownership of goods unlike an order bill. This view is clearly expressed in 6-007 which\n\nreads:‘Straight or non-negotiable bills and sea waybills not\n\n  documents of titleA \"straight\" bill is not a document of title in the\n\n  common law sense, so that its transfer does not operate as a transfer of the constructive\n\n  possession of the goods.It is not a symbol of the goods because the carrier is\n\n  entitled and bound to deliver the goods to the named consignee without production of the\n\n  bill.It follows that a carriage document will not be a document of title in the\n\n  common law sense if it is expressed on its face to be \"non-negotiable\". Sea\n\n  waybills have the legal nature of \"straight\" or \"non-negotiable\"\n\n  bills: they are similarly not documents of title in the common law sense, since under such\n\n  waybills delivery is to be made to the named consignee, irrespective of production of the\n\n  waybill, and not to the holder of the waybill as such.’ (italics mine)I point out here that whilst one cannot endorse a straight bill so as\n\nto transfer constructive possession of the goods, this does not mean that the straight\n\nbill does not impose a contractual term obligating the carrier to require its production\n\nin exchange for delivery. The sea waybill was developed to get away from such a legally\n\nimposed obligation.29. For the proposition that the carrier is entitled and bound to\n\ndeliver the goods to the named consignee without production of the bill,Carvercites reports by the English and Scottish Law Commissions and also the case ofThe Brij[2001] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 43. The latter was a decision of the Hong Kong High Court on a\n\ndispute between a plaintiff shipper of garments and the owner of the vessel in which they\n\nwere shipped. The facts are somewhat complicated because the shipment was effected by a\n\nfreight forwarder (WTW) which also operated its shipping side under the name of Talent\n\nExpress Line (‘Talent’). WTW issued the plaintiff with Talent bills of lading\n\nwhich named the plaintiff as the shipper, the consignee to order and the buyer’s\n\nagent Amaya as the notify party. The plaintiff used these bills as documents of title to\n\ntry to obtain payment from the buyer under the appropriate letters of credit. At the same\n\ntime, unknown to the plaintiff, by arrangement between WTW and the operator of the vessel,\n\nCAVN, CAVN issued bills of lading to WTW evidencing shipment of the goods but naming WTW\n\nas shipper and the consignee as Amaya. These bills were kept by CAVN. When the ship\n\narrived in Venezuela the goods were discharged into the custody of the Venezuelan customs\n\nand later released by the customs to agents for Amaya, the consignee under the CAVN bills.\n\nThe actual buyer did not pay for the goods and the Talent bills were in fact never given\n\nto the buyer or Amaya. The plaintiff sued the defendant carrier for mis-delivery of the\n\ngoods.30. It was held by Waung J that the true position was that between the\n\nplaintiff and WTW they regarded Talent as the carrier under the Talent bill; WTW kept the\n\nCAVN bills because they were the contracts of WTW and not the contracts of the plaintiff;\n\nthe plaintiff was not a party to the CAVN bills and its claim in contract failed.\n\nSecondly, the plaintiff failed in tort because there was no breach of duty of care since\n\nthe duty of the carrier under the CAVN bills was only to deliver to the named consignee\n\nAmaya. In his judgment Waung J stated that the essence of straight bills is ‘that\n\nthey are not negotiable and the contractual mandate is to deliver to named consignee\n\nwithout the production of the original document’ (at p 434). For this proposition, he\n\nrelied on a passage from the fifth edition ofBenjamin on Sale of Goodswhich\n\nreads:‘Two things follow from the fact that a document of this kind is\n\n  not transferable by indorsement and delivery. First, the consignee (if in possession of\n\n  the document) cannot, by purporting to transfer it in this way, impose on the carrier a\n\n  legal obligation to deliver the goods to another person. Secondly, the shipper cannot\n\n  oblige the carrier to deliver the goods to a different consignee from the one named merely\n\n  by indorsing and delivering the bill to that other person; for under a straight bill the\n\n  carrier is entitled and bound to deliver the goods to the originally named consignee\n\n  without production of the bill, so that, when he delivers the goods, he may have no means\n\n  of knowing of the purported transfer of the bill. This difficulty cannot arise in the case\n\n  of an order bill, under which the goods are deliverable only on production of the\n\n  bill.’The text cites no authority for the proposition that under a straight\n\nbill the carrier is bound to deliver to the named consignee without production of the\n\nbill. Waung J relied only on this passage for his statement of the law. He seems to have\n\ntreated it as an uncontentious point. The various cases that I have mentioned in 17 to\n\n25 do not appear to have been brought to his attention. In my view, neitherThe Brijnor\n\nthe passages ofCarverwhich rely on it without consideration of contrary authority\n\nare strong support for APL’s stand.31. The next case which APL cited was a very recent English decision.\n\nIn‘The Chitral’[2001] 1 LLR 529, two sets of bills of lading were\n\nissued for a shipment from Bremen to Dubai. The persons arranging for the shipment were\n\nfreight forwarders in Dubai (Al Ghaith) and in Germany they acted through their agents\n\nIASC. The first set was issued by IASC to the sellers of the cargo and named them as\n\nshippers. The consignee was expressed as ‘to the order of CBQ’ (the bank\n\nfinancing the shipment). The second set of bills was issued on behalf of the owners of the\n\nvessel to IASC as shippers and Al Ghaith was named as consignee. The goods arrived at\n\nDubai in a damaged condition and the issues before the court were first whether IASC or Al\n\nGhaith had title to sue the carrier and if so whether, secondly, their claim was time\n\nbarred. The case basically concerned the construction of the second set of bills of lading\n\nand whether the phrase within the printed section of this bill to the effect that delivery\n\nwas ‘to be unto the above-mentioned consignee or to his or their assigns’ was\n\ncapable changing what was on its face a straight bill into an order bill. Steel J\n\nconcluded that it was not and that the bill was non-negotiable and that therefore under\n\ntheCarriage of Goods by Sea Act1992 the parties with title to sue on it were IASC\n\nas the original party to the contract of carriage and Al Ghaith as the person to whom\n\ndelivery was to be made. The Judge did not make any comments on whether Al Ghaith as the\n\nparty to whom delivery had to be made would have to produce the bill of lading in order to\n\nclaim the goods. It was not necessary for Steel J to do so in view of the issues before\n\nhim. The case does stand as authority for the proposition that a bill of lading form may\n\nbe drafted in such manner that it contemplates that it may be used both as a straight bill\n\nand as a negotiable bill as required by the carrier. It does not go further to propose\n\ndifferent delivery obligations depending on what decision the carrier makes as to how the\n\nbill should operate.32. Finally, APL citedThe River Ngadareported in the 13thSeptember 2001 issue of the Lloyd’s Maritime Law Newsletter. In this English case,\n\nBelinda Bucknall QC sitting as a deputy judge stated that in a straight bill of lading\n\nnaming X as the consignee, the carrier’s obligation was to deliver the goods to X and\n\nhe was entitled to require X to discharge any relevant liabilities. In such circumstances\n\nproduction of the bill of lading by X was not a necessary precondition for delivery or for\n\nthe exercise by the carrier of his rights against X. The statement about production of the\n\nbill of lading was obiter since the issue in the case was who had title to sue. Further no\n\nauthority was cited for that statement.33. It appeared to me that the weight of the authorities was with Mr\n\nVoss. The position that he took had been one taken by many judges over a substantial\n\nperiod of time and, even though in most of the cases the views expressed were obiter, this\n\ndid not detract from their weight as they reflected the common understanding of the legal\n\nposition. Secondly, this position had also been endorsed by academics and writers of\n\npopular texts. It was in my view also consistent with commercial sense as stated by Clarke\n\nJ. The straight bill of lading and the consequent delivery obligation it imposes on a\n\ncarrier has been well known for decades. A shipper who, like Mr Voss in this case, asks\n\nfor the issue of a straight bill of lading even though the alternative of a sea waybill is\n\navailable to him, wants to retain some degree of control over the delivery of the goods.\n\nThe shipowner is aware of this. If he is not prepared to accept the restriction on\n\ndelivery rights that a bill of lading imposes he can insist on issuing a waybill instead.\n\nOnce he issues a bill of lading instead, however, whether it is an order bill or a\n\nstraight bill, he must not deliver the cargo except against its production. The contrary\n\nview had much less support and most of it was recent and cursory. Neither Waung J nor\n\nBelinda Bucknall QC undertook the extensive review of the authorities that Clarke J\n\nconducted in theSormovskiy 3068.34. There was no doubt in this case that the document issued in respect\n\nof the carriage of the car from Hamburg to Bremen was a bill of lading, not a waybill. It\n\ncalled itself a bill of lading. It was issued in a set of three and bore the endorsement\n\n‘Original B/L’. Although the format used contemplated that it could be used\n\neither as a non-negotiable bill or as an order bill as in the case ofThe Chitral,\n\nit contained no term that would vary the carrier’s delivery obligation depending on\n\nwhich type of bill it was chosen to issue. Finally, APL accepted in their pleadings that\n\nthey had issued a bill of lading. No assertion was made that the document evidencing the\n\nshipment of the goods was, instead, a sea waybill.35. The other issue in the case was whether Mr Voss had in fact\n\nreceived full payment for the car. Though APL tried to raise doubts about his claim to\n\nhave received only part payment, I was satisfied from the documents produced that their\n\narguments had no merit.36. Accordingly, I dismissed APL’s appeal.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
