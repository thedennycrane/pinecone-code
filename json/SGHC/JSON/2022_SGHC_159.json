        "Introduction": "1 This was the appellant’s appeal against the decision of the District Judge (“the DJ”) inPublic Prosecutor v WangHuijin[2021] SGDC 173 (“GD”). 2 The appellant was convicted after claiming trial to a single charge under s 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) for using criminal force on a public servant, namely Wyatt Tan Jing Hui (“PW1 Wyatt”) of the National Environment Agency (“NEA”), while he was executing his duty as a public servant. The appellant was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment. 3 By way of criminal motion application HC/CM 106/2021 (“CM 106/2021”), the appellant also sought to adduce fresh evidence in further support of his appeal against his conviction and sentence. 4 I found no merit in the appellant’s application in CM 106/2021 and dismissed it. As for the appeal, I found no reason to differ from the DJ’s conclusion that the charge had been established beyond reasonable doubt. The sentence imposed was also not manifestly excessive. I set out the reasons for my decision to dismiss both CM 106/2021 and the appeal below.",

        "Summary of the evidence": "5 The appellant is a 47-year-old male. He came to Singapore from China in 1998 and subsequently became a Singapore citizen.1Foot Note 1×Record of Appeal (“ROA”) at p 367 (Notes of Evidence (“NE”) Day 3, p 66 at lines 7–8).At the material time of the alleged offence on 29 January 2018, he was a stockbroker with UOB Kay Hian.2Foot Note 2×ROA at p 368 (NE Day 3, p 67 at lines 10–22).PW1 Wyatt, the victim, was an Enforcement Officer authorised to carry out enforcement action on behalf of the NEA. At the material time, he was conducting anti-littering enforcement duties in the Chinatown area, accompanied by PW2 Tay Kwang Hong (“PW2 Tay”) and PW3 Brenda Tan Wei Nee (“PW3 Brenda”), who were also NEA officers (collectively, “the NEA officers”). 6 The evidence adduced at the trial may be summarised as follows. The NEA officers testified that on 29 January 2018, at or about 6.15pm, they saw the appellant throw a cigarette butt on the floor before walking into a restaurant along Mosque Street. They approached the appellant inside the restaurant, where he was dining and drinking with his client. One or more of them identified themselves as enforcement officers from the NEA by showing their authority cards to him, informed him of his littering offence and asked him to step out of the restaurant.3Foot Note 3×ROA at p 30 (NE Day 1, p 13 at lines 6-13); ROA at p 198 (NE Day 2, p 50 at lines 9–14); ROA at p 288 (NE Day 2, p 140 at lines 6–10). 7 The appellant complied and PW1 Wyatt explained to the appellant that he had committed a littering offence in contravention of the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap 95, 2002 Rev Ed). He requested for the appellant’s particulars so that they could issue him with a Notice to Attend Court (“NTAC”).4Foot Note 4×ROA at pp 32–33 (NE Day 1, p 15 at lines 13–15; NE Day 1, p 16 at lines 13–19).The appellant claimed that he was a tourist but did not have his identification documents with him as he had left his passport in his hotel room at the Marriott Hotel. The appellant offered to lead them to his hotel, which he claimed was nearby.5Foot Note 5×ROA at pp 32–33 (NE Day 1, p 15 at line 30 to p 16 line 8).The NEA officers agreed to this proposal as the appellant seemed genuinely co-operative at the time.6Foot Note 6×ROA at p 33 (NE Day 1, p 16 at lines 9–12). 8 The appellant suggested that taking a bus would be quicker and boarded a bus in the vicinity of Chinatown MRT station. On the bus ride, the appellant spoke to PW1 Wyatt about “all kinds of water matters”7Foot Note 7×ROA at p 380 (NE Day 3, p 79 at lines 27–31).as he thought that this was what the NEA was responsible for, but PW1 Wyatt was unable to answer his questions.8Foot Note 8×ROA at p 381 (NE Day 3, p 80 at lines 5–7).The appellant was also suspicious as the three NEA officers were not in uniform and he did not expect them to be graduates.9Foot Note 9×ROA at p 381 (NE Day 3, p 80 at lines 15–24).At a bus stop near Great World City, the appellant dashed out of the bus.10Foot Note 10×ROA at p 36 (NE Day 1, p 19 at lines 3–7); ROA at p 382 (NE Day 3, p 81 at lines 9–22).The NEA officers also alighted. PW1 Wyatt warned the appellant about running away as it would only “complicate the whole enforcement process”.11Foot Note 11×ROA at p 36 (NE Day 1, p 19 at lines 12–16).The appellant asserted that he was not running away and that the NEA officers should follow him, as his hotel was nearby.12Foot Note 12×ROA at p 36 (NE Day 1, p 19 at lines 17–20).Initially all three NEA officers did so, but PW3 Brenda eventually decided to take a bus to Marriott Hotel as she had difficulty keeping up with the appellant’s brisk walking pace.13Foot Note 13×ROA at p 292 (NE Day 2, p 144 at lines 14–29).From that point on, only PW1 Wyatt and PW2 Tay were walking with the appellant. 9 The appellant walked quickly and boarded another bus at bus stop 13191 (the “Bus Stop”), located along Paterson Road. PW1 Wyatt promptly followed the appellant as he boarded the bus.14Foot Note 14×ROA at p 37 (NE Day 1, p 20 at lines 15–20).He identified himself as an NEA officer to the bus driver by showing his authority card, and asked the bus driver not to drive off. The bus driver complied.15Foot Note 15×ROA at p 37 (NE Day 1, p 20 at lines 26–32); ROA at p 478 (NE Day 4, p 68 at lines 26–30).The appellant then quickly alighted from the stationary bus.16Foot Note 16×ROA at p 37 (NE Day 1, p 20 at lines 30–32).PW1 Wyatt also alighted and when he caught up with the appellant, he informed him that the NEA officers had alerted the police for assistance.17Foot Note 17×ROA at p 38 (NE Day 1, p 21 at lines 15–17).PW2 Tay called the police sometime between getting off at the bus stop near Great World City and arriving at the Bus Stop.18Foot Note 18×ROA at p 207 (NE Day 2, p 59 at lines 29–32). 10 PW1 Wyatt then moved in front of the appellant and tried to block his passage with his back and slow him down as the appellant refused to stop walking.19Foot Note 19×ROA at p 38 (NE Day 1, p 21 at lines 19–26).Shortly after, the appellant allegedly pushed PW1 Wyatt on his back close to his shoulder and shouted “get out of my way” in Mandarin.20Foot Note 20×ROA at p 40 (NE Day 1, p 23 at lines 2–8).PW1 Wyatt fell forward to the ground21Foot Note 21×ROA at p 40 (NE Day 1, p 23 at lines 19–31).and dropped his enforcement device, an iPad.22Foot Note 22×ROA at p 40 (NE Day 1, p 23 at lines 17–24).The appellant then sped up and walked briskly towards Orchard Boulevard. After getting up from the ground, PW1 Wyatt managed to catch up with the appellant. PW2 Tay who was walking slightly further behind had witnessed the appellant push PW1 Wyatt.23Foot Note 23×ROA at p 209 (NE Day 2, p 61 at lines 5–23). 11 The appellant attempted to board another bus at the bus stop in front of Four Seasons Park. Similar to before, PW1 Wyatt followed suit, identified himself to the bus driver as an NEA officer and requested for him not to drive off.24Foot Note 24×ROA at p 42 (NE Day 1, p 25 at lines 16–20).The bus driver complied25Foot Note 25×ROA at p 44 (NE Day 1, p 27 at lines 1–2).and the appellant alighted from the bus after he realised that the bus had stopped.26Foot Note 26×ROA at p 44 (NE Day 1, p 27 at lines 4–7).The appellant then walked to the junction of Orchard Boulevard and called his wife, telling her to inform the police that there were people trying to kidnap him.27Foot Note 27×ROA at p 44 (NE Day 1, p 27 at lines 17–26).Subsequently, he changed his mind and told his wife to call the Chinese Embassy instead.28Foot Note 28×ROA at p 44 (NE Day 1, p 27 at lines 29–31); ROA at p 486 (NE Day 4, p 76 at lines 12–19).PW1 Wyatt reiterated that they were not kidnappers and offered to walk with the appellant to the NEA headquarters, which was nearby, to verify their identities. PW1 Wyatt also asked the appellant to co-operate as the police were already on their way.29Foot Note 29×ROA at pp 45–46 (NE Day 1, p 28 at line 30 to p 29 at line 2).The appellant maintained that he did not believe them and proceeded to walk away from them.30Foot Note 30×ROA at p 46 (NE Day 1, p 29 at lines 8–23). 12 At the traffic light facing Goodwood Park Hotel, the appellant dashed across the road despite the pedestrian crossing light being red. PW1 Wyatt and PW2 Tay did not follow suit, as they were concerned for their safety.31Foot Note 31×ROA at p 47 (NE Day 1, p 30 at lines 26–31); ROA at p 48 (NE Day 1, p 31 at lines 3–13); ROA at pp 213–214 (NE Day 2, p 65 at line 26 to p 66 at line 3).They subsequently searched for the appellant in the NEA building, but could not find him there.32Foot Note 32×ROA at p 48 (NE Day 1, p 31 at lines 19–30).According to the appellant, he had gone to the toilet in the NEA building.33Foot Note 33×ROA at p 540 (NE Day 5, p 10 at lines 21–30).His wife reached the NEA building in a taxi and thereafter they left together. Later that evening, the police interviewed the appellant and his wife at their residence and explained that he had been approached by NEA officers earlier on.",
        "The DJ’s decision": "13 In convicting the appellant, the DJ made the following key findings: (a) PW1 Wyatt, PW2 Tay and PW3 Brenda were public servants executing their duties as public servants.34Foot Note 34×GDat [65]–[70]. (b) The appellant knew that PW1 Wyatt, PW2 Tay and PW3 Brenda were NEA officers executing their duties as public servants.35Foot Note 35×GD at paras 62, 64–70. (c) The appellant pushed PW1 Wyatt in order to get away from PW1 Wyatt and PW2 Tay. The DJ accepted that PW1 Wyatt and PW2 Tay were credible witnesses and preferred their testimonies. The DJ also accepted PW3 Brenda’s testimony that PW1 Wyatt had informed her about being pushed by the appellant on the day itself when they reunited at Chinatown to continue their enforcement duties.36Foot Note 36×GD at para 74.",
        "The criminal motion in CM 106/2021": "14 Before addressing the arguments raised on appeal, I shall deal with the threshold issue of whether the appellant’s application in CM 106/2021 for leave to adduce further evidence (“Fresh Evidence Application”) and for the Prosecution to produce certain documents (“Disclosure Application”) should have been allowed.",
        "Fresh Evidence Application": "15 The appellant filed the Fresh Evidence Application pursuant to s 392 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), which provides as follows: 392.—(1)  In dealing with any appeal under this Part, the appellate court may, if it thinks additional evidence isnecessary, either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by the trial court. [emphasis added] 16 Under the Fresh Evidence Application, the appellant sought to adduce the following: (a) the M1 mobile phone call log of the appellant’s wife on the date of the offence, 29 January 2018 (“the Call Log”);37Foot Note 37×Appellant’s Skeletal Submissions dated 4 January 2022 (“Appellant’s submissions”) at para 1.1.(b) two MOV file videos recorded on 7 September 2020 of: (i) the traffic light at the intersection of Paterson Road and Orchard Boulevard, adjacent to TwentyOne Angullia Park and across Wheelock Place, and (ii) the traffic light at the intersection of Paterson Road and Orchard Road, adjacent to Wheelock Place and across Shaw House (“the Videos”);38Foot Note 38×Appellant’s submissions at paras 1.2–1.4.and(c) two screenshots of the Instagram account of PW1 Wyatt, showing that he was a bodybuilder (“the Instagram Screenshots”).39Foot Note 39×Appellant’s submissions at para 1.5. 17 InSohMeiyun v Public Prosecutor[2014] 3 SLR 299 (at [14]), it was held that to ascertain whether fresh evidence sought to be introduced at the appellate stage was “necessary”, the evidence must satisfy the conditions of non-availability, relevance and reliability set out inLadd v Marshall[1954] 1 WLR 1489. First, it must be shown that the new evidence would not have been available for use at the trial even with reasonable diligence. Second, it must be relevant and have an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive. Third, the evidence must be apparently credible, though it need not be incontrovertible (seeGaiyathirid/o Murugayan v Public Prosecutor[2022] SGCA 38). Notably, as elucidated in the case ofPublic Prosecutor v Mohd Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan[2018] 1 SLR 544, in criminal proceedings, courts have placed more weight on the relevancy, more specifically, materiality, as well as the credibility, of the further evidence to be adduced (at [43]). 18 I was not persuaded that the conditions of relevance and reliability were made out for the following reasons: (a) In respect of the Call Log, the Prosecution accepted that the appellant’s phone call with his wife was initiated at 18:56:07 on 29 January 2018,40Foot Note 40×Prosecution’s submissions dated 4 January 2022 (“Prosecution’s submissions”) at para 116.which was the fact that the appellant sought admission of the Call Log for. The Call Log was not necessary. It did not assist the appellant in undermining PW1 Wyatt’s credibility on his version of events. To subvert PW1 Wyatt’s testimony on the events that transpired, the appellant argued that it was “factually improbable”41Foot Note 41×ROA at p 8 (Petition of Appeal (“POA”) at para 4).for PW1 Wyatt, PW2 Tay and himself to have covered the alleged distance of 750m within the length of his call with his wife. However, the evidence suggested that the actual distance covered while the appellant was on the call with his wife was in fact shorter than that. The Call Log would therefore have little influence on the result of the case, and did not satisfy the condition of relevance. (b) In respect of the Videos, the appellant sought to rely on the duration it took for the traffic lights at the first traffic intersection and the second traffic intersection to change to similarly highlight that it was “factually improbable”42Foot Note 42×ROA at p 8 (Petition of Appeal (“POA”) at para 4).for PW1 Wyatt, PW2 Tay and the appellant to have covered the distance of 750m within a short span of 5 minutes and 35 seconds. However, PW1 Wyatt testified that the appellant had in fact made the phone call while they “waited at the traffic light … at Orchard Boulevard … towards Wheelock Place” (ie, the first traffic intersection).43Foot Note 43×ROA at p 44 (NE Day 1 at p 26, lines 17–21).Therefore, the distance travelled by them within the relevant time period would have been shorter than 750m. The Videos were thus not relevant as they would not have assisted the appellant’s case in any event. Furthermore, the Videos were taken on 7 September 2020,44Foot Note 44×Appellant’s submissions at para 42.more than two and a half years after the incident. They were unreliable as there was no evidence that the timing of the traffic lights would have remained the same given the lapse of time, and in any case, the conditions of the incident would not be accurately reflected in the Videos. (c) In respect of the Instagram Screenshots, these were clearly irrelevant. The appellant sought to rely on the screenshots to show that PW1 Wyatt was a bodybuilder who could not have easily been pushed to the ground by the appellant, who described himself as being of an “average or below average build”.45Foot Note 45×Appellant’s submissions at para 55.The appellant further claimed that the fact that he had managed to push PW1 Wyatt to the ground also “provides context” that he was not in full control of his mental faculties at the time.46Foot Note 46×Appellant’s submissions at para 25.I agreed with the Prosecution that the Instagram Screenshots were irrelevant and the appellant’s line of reasoning in this regard was wholly speculative. Furthermore, the Instagram Screenshots were not necessary for the determination of the essential issues in the appeal as PW1 Wyatt had already accounted for how he fell and the force with which the appellant had allegedly used to push him.47Foot Note 47×ROA at p 84–86 (NE Day 1 p 69–72 at line 28 to line 3). 19 As such, the appellant’s Fresh Evidence Application was dismissed.",
        "Disclosure Application": "20 The appellant further applied for the Prosecution to be ordered to produce the following documents: (a) the First Information Report lodged by the appellant’s wife on 29 January 2018 at approximately 6.58pm (the “FIR”);48Foot Note 48×Appellant’s submissions at para 22.(b) the Internal Incident Report (“IIR”) that PW1 Wyatt sent to his duty manager on 29 January 2018;49Foot Note 49×Appellant’s submissions at para 23.(c) all statements given by PW1 Wyatt under s 22 of the CPC (“PW1 Wyatt’s Statements”);50Foot Note 50×Appellant’s submissions at para 24.(d) all statements given by PW2 Tay under s 22 of the CPC (“PW2 Tay’s Statements”);51Foot Note 51×Appellant’s submissions at para 24.and(e) police pocketbook statements recorded by the police officers who spoke to PW1 Wyatt and PW2 Tay at the NEA building carpark, and police pocketbook statements recorded by the police officers who spoke to the appellant at his residence on 29 January 2018 (“Pocketbook Statements”).52Foot Note 52×Appellant’s submissions at para 24. 21 InMuhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor[2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“Kadar”), it was established that the Prosecution has a common law duty to disclose unused material which tends to undermine its case or strengthen the Defence’s case (at [113]). There is a presumption that the Prosecution has fulfilled itsKadarobligations, but this presumption may be rebutted where the Defence is able to show reasonable grounds for belief that the Prosecution has failed to comply with itsKadarobligations. If the court is satisfied that there exist reasonable grounds to believe that the Prosecution has in its possession material which should be disclosed, then the presumption is displaced and the Prosecution has to show or prove to the court that it has not, in fact, breached itsKadarobligations (seeLee Siew Boon Winston v Public Prosecutor[2015] 4 SLR 1184 at [167]–[168]). 22 In my view, the appellant failed to show that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Prosecution had possession of material which should be disclosed: (a) In respect of the FIR, it was open to the appellant to apply for the FIR online. The police had also replied to the appellant’s solicitors providing the FIR reference number.53Foot Note 53×Prosecution’s submissions at para 126. (b) In respect of the IIR, the appellant was of the view that the IIR would show whether “PW1 was consistent in his testimony at the trial below”,54Foot Note 54×Appellant’s submissions at para 58.thus reducing the credibility of his evidence. However, this was bare speculation – the appellant had not pointed to any material inconsistency which could form the basis for such an application. (c) In respect of PW1 Wyatt’s Statements, the appellant submitted that PW1 Wyatt was “likely to have been inconsistent” in his statements.55Foot Note 55×Appellant’s submissions at para 62.The appellant pointed to the Case for the Prosecution, which had stated that the appellant caused PW1 to suffer a neck strain, and PW1 Wyatt’s First Information Report, where he also stated that he suffered from pain for two days. At trial, PW1 Wyatt then stated that he did not suffer any injury.56Foot Note 56×ROA at p 176 (NE Day 2 at p 28, lines 21–23).However, I noted that PW1 Wyatt’s evidence at trial was that he had not felt injured at that point in time, although the next day hedidfeel pain,57Foot Note 57×ROA at p 50 (NE Day 1 at p 33, lines 16–31).and so he had decided to visit a doctor for this pain on 31 January 2018 as the pain had persisted.58Foot Note 58×ROA at p 110 (NE Day 1 at p 93, lines 31–32).Thus, the applicant failed to prove that PW1 Wyatt’s evidence was inconsistent on this point and on any other material point. (d) In respect of PW2 Tay’s Statements, the appellant submitted that PW2 Tay’s statements were likely inconsistent with his testimony at trial and would go towards impeaching his credibility.59Foot Note 59×Appellant’s submissions at para 63.The appellant pointed to the inconsistencies between PW1 Wyatt’s and PW2 Tay’s testimonies as to the duration of the push and PW2 Tay’s inability to remember whether PW1 Wyatt and the appellant had boarded a bus at Paterson Road. However, in my view, PW2 Tay’s account at trial was internally consistent. As such, there was no basis for the application for production of PW2 Tay’s Statements. (e) In respect of the Pocketbook Statements, the Prosecution had clarified that they were not in possession of the same as no such statements were recorded.60Foot Note 60×Prosecution’s submissions at para 128. 23 The appellant’s Disclosure Application was dismissed. CM 106/2021 was therefore dismissed in its entirety. I now turn to the appellant’s appeal against his conviction and sentence.",
        "The parties’ cases on appeal": "",
        "The appellant’s case": "24 The appellant submitted that the DJ had failed to consider that PW1 Wyatt had collided with a passer-by on the day of the alleged incident.61Foot Note 61×Appellant’s submissions at para 84.The appellant pointed to the fact that PW1 Wyatt had admitted that he had collided with a passer-by while in pursuit of the appellant, and the DJ had failed to consider whether PW1 Wyatt could have confused the appellant’s alleged push with his collision with the said passer-by.62Foot Note 62×Appellant’s submissions at para 84.PW1 Wyatt’s and PW2 Tay’s account of the push was also factually improbable as it was “likely to be impossible” for PW1 Wyatt, PW2 Tay and the appellant to have covered the distance of 750m from the Bus Stop to the traffic light across Shaw House within 5 minutes and 35 seconds.63Foot Note 63×Appellant’s submissions at para 85.Furthermore, PW1 Wyatt’s testimony and PW2 Tay’s testimony of the details of the push were materially different in whether there was any “hustling” and the duration of the push.64Foot Note 64×Appellant’s submissions at para 87.Given the discrepancies in their evidence, PW1 Wyatt’s account of the pushing incident was not unusually convincing. 25 The appellant also submitted that PW1 Wyatt and PW2 Tay were not credible witnesses.65Foot Note 65×Appellant’s submissions at para 89.The evidence that they presented at trial was inconsistent with what was stated in their First Information Reports.66Foot Note 66×Appellant’s submissions at para 89. 26 The appellant further submitted that the DJ had erred in finding that the appellant himself was not a credible witness.67Foot Note 67×Appellant’s submissions at para 92.The appellant was drinking with his client when the NEA officers first approached him and it was not unreasonable that he had not considered asking his companions or the staff in the restaurant for help at the time.68Foot Note 68×Appellant’s submissions at para 92.He initially thought he could manage the matter himself but when he felt that he could no longer do so, he called his wife for assistance.69Foot Note 69×Appellant’s submissions at para 92.The DJ should also have placed more weight on the appellant’s explanation concerning how he had viewed the NEA officers as “scammers”, as he was unconvinced that the NEA officers were genuine NEA officers while he was being pursued.70Foot Note 70×Appellant’s submissions at para 93. 27 In respect of the appeal against sentence, the appellant submitted that the sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was manifestly excessive.71Foot Note 71×ROA at p 12 (POA at para 15); Appellant’s submissions at para 96.The appellant submitted,inter alia, that the DJ had: (a) failed to give weight to the appellant’s psychiatric report, (b) failed to adequately consider the relevant precedents where fines were imposed for similar offences, and (c) incorrectly imposed an uplift of one week’s imprisonment above what the DJ had determined to be the indicative starting sentence.72Foot Note 72×Appellant’s submissions at paras 96.1, 96.3 and 96.6.",
        "The Prosecution’s case": "28 Firstly, the Prosecution submitted that the appellant had objective knowledge that PW1 Wyatt and his colleagues were NEA officers as all three of them had identified themselves to him as enforcement officers from the NEA by showing him their authority cards.73Foot Note 73×Prosecution’s submissions at paras 47–48.PW1 Wyatt had also testified that he translated what “NEA” meant in Mandarin to the appellant and wore his authority card around his neck thereafter.74Foot Note 74×Prosecution’s submissions at para 48.Furthermore, the appellant did not seek verification of PW1 Wyatt’s credentials in the presence of his companions or the restaurant staff when he was first approached, did not use his mobile phone to call others for help when he was allowed to return to the restaurant to collect his backpack and did not verify the identities of the NEA officers after he reached the NEA building.75Foot Note 75×Prosecution’s submissions at para 42.This was thus inconsistent with the appellant’s contention that he thought he was dealing with “scammers”, and instead painted a picture of an individual who was, as the DJ had found, “very much aware of the littering offence that he had committed”.76Foot Note 76×Prosecution’s submissions at para 42; GD at para 70(b).The evidence thus clearly showed that the appellant was attempting to evade the consequences of his littering offence. 29 Secondly, the Prosecution submitted that the appellant had pushed PW1 Wyatt.77Foot Note 77×Prosecution’s submissions at para 52.The DJ had rightly found that PW1 Wyatt was a credible witness as his testimony was internally consistent across his recollection of the incident on the day itself, to the police and during the trial.78Foot Note 78×Prosecution’s submissions at para 56.He also maintained his testimony under cross-examination.79Foot Note 79×Prosecution’s submissions at para 58.In respect of the appellant’s contention that PW1 Wyatt might have confused his collision with a passer-by with the alleged push, the Prosecution pointed out that the DJ had considered that PW1 Wyatt had knocked into a passer-by near the overhead bridge to Far East Plaza, rather than along Paterson Road, which was where the alleged push had taken place.80Foot Note 80×Prosecution’s submissions at para 62.This account was also corroborated by PW2 Tay,81Foot Note 81×Prosecution’s submissions at para 62.whose account was both internally consistent and externally consistent with PW1 Wyatt’s account.82Foot Note 82×Prosecution’s submissions at para 79.As such, the appellant’s claim that PW1 Wyatt could have “confused” a collision with a passer-by with the appellant’s push was groundless. 30 While the evidence of PW1 Wyatt and PW2 Tay would have more than sufficed, the DJ also considered PW3 Brenda’s evidence that she was told by PW1 Wyatt on the day of the incident itself that he was pushed by the appellant.83Foot Note 83×Prosecution’s submissions at para 91.The appellant’s contention that it was factually improbable for PW1 Wyatt and the appellant to have covered a distance of 750m within 5 minutes and 35 seconds was also premised on an exaggeration of the distance actually travelled between PW1 Wyatt and the appellant, and therefore ought to be disregarded.84Foot Note 84×Prosecution’s submissions at para 63.The appellant’s attempts to exaggerate the distance travelled also pointed towards the appellant’s lack of credibility.85Foot Note 85×Prosecution’s submissions at para 67.",
        "Issues to be determined": "31 In respect of the appeal against conviction, the two key issues to be considered were: (a) whether the appellant had the knowledge that PW1 Wyatt, PW2 Tay and PW3 Brenda were public servants; and (b) whether the appellant had pushed PW1 Wyatt at or about 6.50pm along Paterson Road on the day in question. 32 In respect of the appeal against sentence, the sole issue to be considered was whether the sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the present case.",
        "Decision": "",
        "Did the appellant know that the NEA officers were public servants?": "33 To determine the knowledge required of an accused person in the context of a s 332 of the Penal Code offence, the case ofPublic Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and another matter[2018] 3 SLR 1080(“YeoEk Boon Jeffrey”) is instructive. In that case, Tay Yong Kwang JA stated (at [35]) that: Although knowledge that the victim is a public servant going about his duties is not stated explicitly in s 332, it cannot be right that someone who hit another person without even knowing that that person was a public servant going about his duties would be guilty of an offence under s 332. However, theknowledge required is objective and not subjective knowledge. Therefore, if an ordinary person would have such knowledgein the circumstances of the case, it is not open to the accused person to claim that he did not know. [emphasis added] 34 It is thus clear that the test of an accused person’s knowledge is an objective test. What is pertinent to determine the appellant’s state of mind is an ordinary person’s knowledge in the circumstances of the case. Although the DJ did not cite any authority, in referring to the Prosecution’s submission for the appellant’s knowledge to be evaluated by reference to the “ordinary person in the accused’s shoes”, the DJ was cognisant of the principle as articulated inYeoEk Boon Jeffrey. As such, that the appellant could have been tipsy, had an acute stress reaction or had any irrational fears were rightly not taken into account. 35 The Prosecution bears the burden of proving that an accused person did have such knowledge. In the present case, the appellant claimed that he genuinely believed that the NEA officers were not public servants, even though he “[could] not be 100% certain these people (ie, the NEA officers) [were] scammers”.86Foot Note 86×ROA at p 887 (Exhibit D7-T-2 at para 6).The “ordinary person” test would require the court to assess whether the appellant’s knowledgein the circumstances of the casewas reasonable. The inquiry can be framed thus: should an ordinary person in the appellant’s circumstances be expected to have known that the NEA officers were indeed public servants? 36 According to the appellant, the NEA officers only “flashed” their authority cards and they were not in uniform.87Foot Note 87×ROA at p 448 (NE Day 4, p 38 at lines 22–24); ROA at p 536 (NE Day 5, p 6 at lines 1–2).He also did not expect enforcement officers to be graduates. The NEA officers knew little about water treatment, which was what he understood the NEA to be responsible for, having mistaken them for the Public Utilities Board.88Foot Note 88×GD at para 44; ROA at p 539 (NE Day 5, p 9 at lines 20–22).They agreed to follow him on the bus to Marriott Hotel and continued to follow him when he alighted. They then boarded two other buses with him and followed him further before they could no longer keep up with him. The appellant claims that all this only further stoked his suspicions and added to his confusion and anxiety. 37 However, withoutwishing to make light of the incident, the events that transpired after the appellant was approached by the NEA officers that day, with the ensuing twists and turns, appear almost farcical. From the perspective of an ordinary person in the appellant’s circumstances, the NEA officers’ actions cumulatively demonstrate that they were indeed public servants in the course of executing their duties. Re-examining the undisputed and uncontroversial facts, the NEA officers had identified themselves as law enforcement officers and informed the appellant that he was spotted littering. They flashed their authority cards, but the appellant refused to show them his NRIC. They called the police and asked the appellant to wait with them for the police to arrive. They also offered to walk with the appellant to the NEA headquarters to verify their identities. These facts demonstrate that they had repeatedly assured the appellant of their identities, while giving the appellant several opportunities to conclusively verify their identities. 38 Considering these largely uncontroversial facts as a whole, they would suggest that the appellant was attempting to evade the consequences of his littering offence and to shake the NEA officers off when the opportunity arose, after leading them on what the Prosecution and the DJ termed “a wild goose chase”.89Foot Note 89×GD at para 35(c).The appellant had after all lived in Singapore for some two decades. He ought to be reasonably familiar with local norms. It was reasonable to expect that he should be aware that not all enforcement officers are uniformed officers, even if it might not be reasonable to expect an ordinary person to be aware that the NEA was the agency in charge of littering enforcement. If he had indeed been highly suspicious of the NEA officers, he could have easily sought to verify that they were indeed public servants, but he never did so at any point. If he had harboured real doubts or fears that he was being scammed or kidnapped, the natural and obvious reaction would have been to notify the police immediately or to seek assistance from other persons in the vicinity. He did not do so. Instead, he decided to “play with them”90Foot Note 90×ROA at p 377 (NE Day 3, p 76 at lines 20–24).to buy time. He lied to the NEA officers about his purported status as a tourist and told them that his passport was in his hotel room. He also led the three officers on bus rides towards Marriott Hotel at Orchard Road where he purportedly stayed. 39 I further noted that the appellant had eventually instructed his wife to call the police, but within seconds, changed his mind and asked her to call the Chinese Embassy instead. I accepted that calling the authorities for aid does not seem at first blush to be consistent with how a person intent on evading lawful enforcement action would react. Nevertheless, this did not preclude another equally if not more plausible explanation, namely that he had done so to justify his evading enforcement action through maintaining the position that he had genuinely believed that he was being scammed. 40 It should be noted that the appellant called his wife near the end of an almost hour-long chase, during which the NEA officers had repeatedly and through various means communicated to the appellant that they were public servants who were carrying out their official duties. Moreover, he had already been told that the officers had called the police for assistance as he was uncooperative.Throughout this chase, the appellant also had several opportunities to conclusively verify their identities, but chose not to. I further noted that the appellant testified to being in “shock” when he witnessed at least one bus driver complying with PW1 Wyatt’s instructions to stop the bus, making him wonder how the NEA officers were “so powerful”.91Foot Note 91×ROA at p 389 (NE Day 3, p 88 at lines 8–18).This should have objectively alerted him to the fact that the officers were genuine NEA officers who were carrying out their lawful duties. Considering the facts as a whole, the appellant was fully aware of the authority of the NEA officers. In my view, his instruction to his wife to call the police was designed toprop uphis “scammer” defence. 41 The DJ rejected the appellant’s defence that he had genuinely believed that he was the target of a scam operation or that he was being kidnapped. The correctness of the DJ’s decision was difficult to challenge. An ordinary person in the appellant’s position would not have had reasonable grounds to question the NEA officers’ authority since they had properly identified themselves to him. More so, an ordinary person in the appellant’s position would not have harboured such an irrational belief that he was being scammed and kidnapped, or to have theorised that his best defence was to lead them on a wild goose chase based on a trumped-up tale of being a tourist staying at the Marriott Hotel. 42 I accepted that the DJ correctly found that there was no reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant knew (or ought to have known) that the NEA officers were public servants executing duties as such. Like the DJ, I found it difficult to accept the highly irrational and unusual nature of the appellant’s alleged self-induced suspicions.",
        "Did the appellant push PW1 Wyatt at or about 6.50pm along Paterson Road?": "43 I was of the view that the DJ was fully justified in finding that the appellant had pushed PW1 Wyatt at or about 6.50pm along Paterson Road on the day in question. Credibility of PW1 Wyatt’s testimony 44 In my view, the DJ rightly found that PW1 Wyatt’s testimony was credible and consistent in the material elements. Under cross-examination, PW1 Wyatt remained resolute that he had moved in front of the appellant in an effort to block the appellant’s path before he was pushed. He was pushedfrom the backbetween the neck and the shoulder and thereupon he fell forward despite tightening his core muscles, illustrating the force with which he was pushed by the appellant. 45 Furthermore, PW1 Wyatt’s testimony was supported by PW2 Tay’s observations. PW2 Tay had personally witnessed the push. At trial, he testified that he was following behind PW1 Wyatt and the appellant, and he saw that the appellant had pushed PW1 Wyatt on his left back, causing PW1 Wyatt to fall.92Foot Note 92×ROA at p 209 (NE Day 2 at p 61, lines 3–9 and lines 17–23).PW2 Tay testified that this happened after the Bus Stop, which corroborated PW1 Wyatt’s testimony of the location where the push had taken place.93Foot Note 93×ROA at p 684 (Exhibit P4) and ROA at p 685 (Exhibit P5).In my view, the DJ was justified in preferring PW1 Wyatt’s evidence over that of the appellant. There was nothing in the DJ’s finding on this crucial fact that was plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. 46 The appellant further claimed that the accounts of PW1 Wyatt and PW2 Tay were factually improbable. He contended that PW1 Wyatt and the appellant could not have covered the distance of 750m between the Bus Stop and Shaw House within 5 minutes and 35 seconds, which was the time between the end of PW2 Tay’s call to the police at the Bus Stop (at 18:50:32) and the start of the appellant’s phone call to his wife allegedly at Shaw House (at 18:56:07). 47 I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the appellant had exaggerated the distance actually travelledby PW1 Wyatt and the appellant. PW1 Wyatt testified that the appellant had initiated the phone call to his wifebeforethey reached Shaw House, while they were waiting at the traffic light at Orchard Boulevard towards Wheelock Place,94Foot Note 94×ROA at p 44 (NE Day 1 at p 27, lines 15–21).and that the appellant had already ended the phone call when they were near the traffic light from Wheelock Place to Shaw House. PW2 Tay also testified that the phone call took place before they reached Shaw House.95Foot Note 95×ROA at p 215 (NE Day 2 at p 66, lines 4–9).I noted that the appellant himself appeared to have conceded that the phone call took place before they reached Shaw House, thus corroborating PW1 Wyatt’s and PW2 Tay’s accounts.96Foot Note 96×ROA at p 276 (NE Day 2 at p 128, lines 9–32). The appellant’s claims that no push had occurred 48 The appellant made further claims in support of his account that no push had occurred. I found his claims to be without merit. I shall briefly address the salient aspects of his claims. 49 Firstly, while the appellant claimed that PW1 Wyatt had collided heavily into an oncoming passer-by along Paterson Road, this was wholly at odds with PW1 Wyatt’s evidence that he had fallen to the ground after he was pushedfrom behind. The appellant’s claim also completely glossed over PW1 Wyatt’s unwavering evidence that no collision with any passer-by had taken place along Paterson Road, but one did occur at a different location nearer to Far East Plaza and just before Goodwood Park Hotel. PW2 Tay’s evidence corroborated this. The appellant submitted that the collision with the said passer-by might have caused PW1 Wyatt to be confused with an alleged push by the appellant. This was entirely speculative, and the appellant had in fact conceded that he did not personally witness the collision, but this was merely his “theoretical analysis” of what could have happened.97Foot Note 97×ROA at p 477 (NE for Day 4, p 67 at lines 17–29). 50 In addition, the appellant claimed that he could not have pushed PW1 Wyatt because PW1 Wyatt did not suffer any abrasions. However, PW1 Wyatt explained that the pavement was a normal concrete pavement,98Foot Note 98×ROA at p 41 (NE for Day 1, p 24 at lines 9–14).he was wearing jeans99Foot Note 99×ROA at p 41 (NE for Day 1, p 41 at lines 21–32).and he did not suffer any open cuts or abrasions as his skin was relatively thick.100Foot Note 100×ROA at p 86 (NE for Day 1, p 69 at lines 3–4).It was not invariably the case that an individual who falls on the pavement would sustain abrasions, cuts or scratches.",
        "Was the sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment manifestly excessive?": "51 Turning to the appeal against sentence, I found that the total sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was not manifestly excessive. 52 Firstly, the DJ rightly gave no weight to the psychiatric report, prepared on 21 October 2020 by Dr Ung Eng Khean (“Dr Ung”),101Foot Note 101×ROA at p 1030.stating that the appellant was suffering from an acute stress reaction. It should be noted that the report was prepared retrospectively, more than two years after the incident itself. Dr Ung’s assessment was also premised on the appellant’s self-reported account of the incident. I accepted that the DJ had correctly rejected the appellant’s account, and as such there was no reliable basis for Dr Ung’s assessment. 53 In any case, despite the appellant’s repeated claims that he had acted in a heightened state of panic and confusion,102Foot Note 102×ROA at pp 1000–1001 (Exhibit F at paras 17–18).he certainly had the presence of mind to devise various ways to try to give the NEA officers the slip. The fundamental premise of the appellant’s reliance on his acute stress reaction was that his actions were driven by his irrational perceptions. While it would appear that he acted spontaneously, his actions were not purely haphazard or random. His pushing of PW1 Wyatt was not done in a momentary lapse of judgment. Rather, it was the culmination of his efforts to get away from the NEA officers. Moreover, it was more plausible that he had asked his wife to call the police and the Chinese Embassy to bolster his false claim that there were bogus officers out to scam or kidnap him, rather than face up to the fact that he had endeavoured to evade enforcement action. 54 Secondly, I was of the view that the DJ had properly applied the framework inAw Soy Tee v Public Prosecutor[2020] 5 SLR 453 (“Aw Soy Tee”) (at [30]) to the present case. It was not disputed that this case fell within Category 1 of the sentencing framework enumerated inAw Soy Tee. In assessing the harm and culpability of an offender, courts may have regard to the factors enumerated inYeoEk Boon Jeffreyat [60]. In the present case, the appellant had clearly caused harm. His offence resulted in PW1 Wyatt falling to the ground and suffering some pain in his back. In the case ofPublic Prosecutor vLohChee Wah[2020] SGDC 221, the court observed that for s 353 of the Penal Code offences, where there is a direct physical act, for example, a push, the typical sentencing range is between three to five weeks’ imprisonment (at [132]). The NEA officers were also clearly obstructed from carrying out their duties due to the appellant’s non-compliance. 55 Furthermore, there were several culpability-enhancing factors. The appellant had demonstrated contempt for authority, lying to the NEA officers about his citizenship status and leading them on a protracted chase from Chinatown to the Orchard area in a prolonged effort to evade enforcement action.103Foot Note 103×GD at para 108.The appellant had also acted with premeditation, evidenced by his intention to “play with [the NEA officers]” and to “delay time”.104Foot Note 104×ROA at p 377 (NE for Day 3, p 76 at lines 9–24). 56 The appellant relied primarily onPublic Prosecutor v An Heejung[2015] SGDC 59 (“AnHeejung”) andPublic Prosecutor v Shalaan s/o Sukumaran[2020] SGDC 149 (“Shalaan”) in support of his argument that a fine should be imposed instead of a custodial sentence. However, as the DJ rightly found, these cases were distinguishable from the present case. In both cases, the accused persons had pleaded guilty. In the case ofAnHeejung,the accused was not a habitual drinker and he had no recollection of the events of the material time as he was highly inebriated. The court assessed that he had acted “completely out of his character” and that what had occurred was a one-off isolated incident (at [29]). In the case ofShalaan, there was no deliberate defiance of authority as the accused had pushed the police officer in the middle of a heated fight which the accused person was attempting to break up (at [26] and [38]). He was not attempting to evade apprehension. Both the harm and culpability in the present case were considerably higher, as he had not only pushed PW1 Wyatt with sufficient force to cause him to fall to the ground, but he had also consciously acted in prolonged contempt of the NEA officers’ authority. 57 Accordingly, I agreed with the DJ that the custodial threshold was crossed in this case. As there were no significant mitigating factors, I was not persuaded that the sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was manifestly excessive. The appellant had clearly intended to lead the NEA officers on a time-wasting trip from Chinatown to Orchard Road and thereafter in the direction of the NEA building, where he could easily have lodged a complaint or sought to verify their identities. The fact that he was told that the NEA officers had called the police and were apparently prepared to follow him all the way to the NEA building should also have informed him that they could not possibly have been scammers or kidnappers.",
        "Conclusion": "58 In conclusion, I agreed with the DJ’s findings that the appellant’s actions were all part of his planned intent to evade enforcement action. I did not see any reason to interfere with the DJ’s decision to impose a one-week uplift to the indicative sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment. The appeals against conviction and sentence were therefore dismissed.
