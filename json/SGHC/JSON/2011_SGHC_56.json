        "Introduction": "1       This was an appeal by way of Registrar’s\n                    Appeal No 488 of 2010 (“the Appeal”) against the decision of\n                    the Assistant Registrar (“the AR”), who had struck out the\n                    Originating Summons No 994 of 2010 (“the OS”) filed by Tan\n                    Eng Hong (“Tan”) on the application of the Attorney-General\n                    (“the AG”). 2       Tan had been jointly charged with another person\n                    in District Arrest Case No 41402 of 2010 (“DAC 41402/2010”) for an\n                    offence under s 377A (“the charge”) of the Penal Code (Cap 224,\n                    2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”). Tan subsequently filed the OS on\n                    24 September 2010 under O 15 r 16 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5 2006 Rev\n                    Ed) (“the Rules”) to challenge the constitutionality of s 377A\n                    under the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) (“the\n                    Constitution”) as follows: (a)    Section 377A of the Penal Code was inconsistent\n                            with Article 9 of the Constitution and was therefore void by virtue of\n                            Article 4 of the Constitution (“Art 4”); (b)    Section 377A was inconsistent with Articles 12 and\n                            14 of the Constitution (“Art 12 and 14”) and was therefore\n                            void by virtue of Art 4. (c)    For those reasons, the charge brought against Tan\n                            under s 377A was void. 3       On 15 October 2010, during a pre-trial\n                    conference at the Subordinate Courts, state counsel for the AG informed Tan that\n                    the charge against him had been amended to one under s 294(a) of the Penal Code\n                    (“the amended charge”). The AG then applied under Summons No 5063\n                    of 2010 (“the striking-out application”) pursuant to O 18 r 19 of\n                    the Rules to strike out the OS. The AR granted the striking-out application on 7\n                    December 2010 resulting in this Appeal. A week later, Tan pleaded guilty to the\n                    amended charge. He was convicted and fined $3,000.",
        "The issues": "4       In order to determine if the AR’s decision\n                    was correct, the court needs to look at the applicable principles in three areas\n                    of lawviz: (a)     striking out; (b)locus\n                            standiand (c)     the requirements for the granting of declaratory\n                        relief. 5       In brief, pleadings can be struck out under O 18\n                    r 19 of the Rules on the ground that: (i) it discloses no reasonable cause of\n                    action; (ii) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; (iii) it may prejudice,\n                    embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or (iv) it is otherwise an\n                    abuse of the process of the Court. The burden is on the applicant to prove a\n                    very clear case that one of the grounds in O 18 r 19 applies (per AG of Duchy of Lancaster v London and North Western Railway\n                        Co[1892] 3 Ch 274) as can be seen from the following\n                    cases: (a)     An action may be struck out under the\n                        “no reasonable cause of action” ground as being without legal\n                        basis where an aggrieved party is unable to establishlocus standi(seeAbdul Razak Ahmad v\n                            Majlis Bandaraya Johor Bahru[1995] 2 MLJ\n                    287. (b)     According to\n                        Yong Pung How CJ inGoh Koon Suan v Heng Gek\n                            Kiau[1990] 2 SLR(R) 705 at [15], an action is clearly\n                        vexatious in the following situations: ...when the party bringing it is not actingbona\n                                fide, and merely wishes to annoy or embarrass his\n                            opponent, or when it is not calculated to lead to any practical\n                            result. InChee Siok Chin & Ors v Minister for Home\n                            Affairs & Anor[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 at [33]\n                            (“Chee Siok Chin”), V K\n                        Rajah J elaborated on the “frivolous and vexatious”\n                        ground: Proceedings are frivolous when they are deemed to waste the\n                            court’s time, and are determined to be incapable of legally\n                            sustainable and reasoned argument. Proceedings are vexatious when they\n                            are shown to bewithout foundationand/or\n                            where theycannot possibly succeedand/or\n                            where an action is brought only for annoyance or to gain some fanciful\n                            advantage. [emphasis in original] (c)     Rajah J inChee Siok Chinalso classified the abuse\n                        of process ground into four categories (at [34]): (i)    proceedings which involve a deception on the\n                                court…; (ii)   proceedings where the process of the court is\n                                not being fairly or honestly used but is employed for some ulterior\n                                or improper purpose or in an improper way; (iii)   proceedings which are manifestly groundless\n                                or without foundation or which serve no useful\n                            purpose; (iv)   multiple or successive proceedings which\n                                cause or are likely to cause improper vexation or\n                            oppression. 6       If a court cannot grant a party declaratory\n                    relief, it is arguable that the case is frivolous and vexatious, since it would\n                    have no practical value. To decide whether it can indeed do so, the court should\n                    consider the requirements for the granting of declaratory relief. InKaraha Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd and another\n                        appeal[2006] 1 SLR(R) 112 at [14] (“Karaha Bodas”), Judith Prakash J summarised them as\n                    follows: … (a)the court must have jurisdiction and power to\n                            award the remedy; (b)the matter must be justiciable in the\n                            court; (c)as a declaration is a discretionary remedy, it\n                            must be justified by the circumstances of the case; (d)the plaintiff must havelocus\n                                standito bring the suit and there must be a real\n                            controversy for the court to resolve; (e)any person whose interests might be affected by\n                            the declaration should be before the court; and (f)there must be some ambiguity or uncertainty about\n                            the issue in respect of which the declaration is sought so that the\n                            court’s determination would have the effect of laying such doubts\n                            to rest. ... 7       There is considerable overlap between the\n                    principles relating to striking-out and the granting of declaratory relief. In\n                    the light of this, this court will address the following issues: (a)     Does Tan havelocus standi? (b)     Is there a real controversy? (c)     Is Tan’s claim certain to\n                    fail? (d)     Does the court\n                        have jurisdiction to declare s 377A of the Penal Code unconstitutional in\n                        view of the fact Tan did not come to court by way of s 56A of the\n                        Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the\n                        SCA”)?",
        "Locus Standi": "",
        "The law on locus standi": "8       InGovernment of Malaysia v\n                        Lim Kit Siang[1988] 2 MLJ 12 at 27 (“Lim Kit Siang”), the majority of the Malaysian Supreme\n                    Court ruled that to possesslocus standi, a\n                    plaintiff must show that he has a private right that has been infringed. If a\n                    public right is involved, he must show that he has suffered a peculiar damage as\n                    a result of the alleged public act and that he has a genuine private interest to\n                    protect or further. InLim KitSiang at p 21, the\n                    majority had followedBoyce v Paddington Borough\n                        Council[1903] 1 Ch 109, which the House of Lords accepted inGouriet v Union of Post Office Workers and\n                        Others[1978] AC 435. 9       Tan had argued that where constitutionally\n                    guaranteed liberties are at stake,locus standiis\n                    established simply by showing sufficient interest rather than substantial\n                    interest. In support, his counsel citedChan Hiang Leng Colin\n                        & Ors v Minister for Information and the Arts[1996] 1 SLR(R)\n                    294 (“Colin Chan”). There,\n                    Karthigesu JA expounded: 13    If a constitutional guarantee is to mean anything,\n                            it must mean that any citizen can complain to the courts if there is a\n                            violation of it. The fact that the violation would also affect every\n                            other citizen should not detract from a citizen’s interest in\n                            seeing that his constitutional rights are not violated. A citizen should\n                            not have to wait until he is prosecuted before he may assert his\n                            constitutional rights. 14    There is thus no need for the appellants to show\n                            that they are office holders in IBSA or members thereof. Their right to\n                            challenge Order 405/1994 arises not from membership of any society.\n                            Their right arises from every citizen’s right to profess, practise\n                            and propagate his religious beliefs. If there was a breach of Art 15,\n                            such a breach would affect the citizenquacitizen. If a citizen does not havesufficient\n                                interestto see that his constitutional rights are not\n                            violated, then it is hard to see who has. [emphasis added]",
        "Colin Chan": "10     Before applying the test to the case, one must\n                    first be clear as to the proposition thatColin\n                        Chanstands for. Contrary to the submissions of Tan’s\n                    counsel, it is not immediately obvious from Karthigesu JA’s passing\n                    reference to “sufficient interest”, that he was articulating a\n                    test akin to its English counterpart. Academics Kevin Tan and Thio Li-Ann\n                    (“Tan and Thio”) have gone even further than Tan’s counsel.\n                    InConstitutional Law in Malaysia and Singapore(LexisNexis, 3rdEd, 2010) at p 551, they wrote,\n                    “Where constitutionally- guaranteed liberties are at stake,locus standiis established without the need to show\n                    sufficiency of interest” before making reference toColin Chan. 11     A more defensible interpretation is that\n                    Karthigesu JA was simply treating constitutional rights as being vested in every\n                    citizen. He was not articulating a new test that specifically applied to\n                    constitutional rights. Instead, he simply preferred applying the\n                    “substantial interest” test instead of the “special\n                    damage” test that is used for public rights and had ruled that the former\n                    was satisfied inColin Chan. This interpretation\n                    was supported by the Court of Appeal’s decision inEng\n                        Foong Ho and Ors v Attorney-General[2009] 2 SLR(R) 542\n                        (“Eng Foong Ho”). IfColin Chanhad articulated a newlocus standirequirement for constitutional rights, the Court of\n                    Appeal inEng Foong Homight have been expected to\n                    have made reference to it. That the Court of Appeal did not do so strongly\n                    suggestsColin Chanis no authority for\n                    Tan’s proposition of a lower test oflocus\n                        standifor constitutional rights. This is further supported by\n                    the Chief Justice’s speech to students from the Singapore Management\n                    University (reproduced in the articleJudicial Review –\n                        From Angst to Empathy(2010) 22 SAcLJ 469 (“SMU\n                    Lecture”), where Chan Sek Keong CJ noted at para 33: …In Singapore, although the courts appear to have accepted the same\n                        ‘sufficient interest’ test to determine whether leave for\n                        judicial review should be granted, that is not, in my view, also to say that\n                        our courts will apply the test with the same rigour as the UK courts. 12     In so far as the test of Tan and Thio may be\n                    taken as saying being a citizen in itself gives onelocus\n                        standi, this should be rejected. Even Lord Denning, who attempted\n                    many times to liberalise the rules on locus standi in England, opined inR. v Greater London Council Ex p Blackburn[1976] 1 WLR 550 at 559 thatlocus standishould\n                    be denied to “mere busybodies”. To allow people to challenge an\n                    allegedly unconstitutional law simply because they are citizens is undesirable\n                    for various reasons. First, priority should be given to parties with a genuine\n                    dispute. Second, as Salleh Abas LP commented inLim Kit\n                        Siangat p 25, a sufficiently robust threshold will ensure the\n                    courts do not adjudicate upon politically motivated litigation: …In my judgment, the court should be slow to respond to a\n                        politically motivated litigation unless the claimant can show that his\n                        private rights as a citizen are affected. Similar caution was expressed by\n                        Salmon LJ in Blackburn’s case [1971] 1 WLR 1037 saying that he\n                        deprecated ‘litigations the purpose of which is to influence political\n                        decisions’. Thus as a politician, the respondent’s remedy in\n                        this matter does not lie with the court, but with Parliament and the\n                        electorate. InAustralian Conservation Foundation Incorporated\n                        v Commonwealth of Australia and Others(1980) 146 CLR 493 at 530,\n                    Gibbs J ruled: A belief, however strongly felt, that the law generally or a particular\n                        law should be observed or that conduct of a particular kind should be\n                        prevented, does not suffice to give its possessorlocus\n                            standi. Constitutional rights are not mere rhetoric for a lowlocus standitest of citizenship to apply. 13Colin Chan,\n                    therefore, should not be seen as introducing a new test oflocus standifor constitutional cases. Instead, it should be\n                    interpreted as merely saying that to satisfy the “substantial\n                    interest” test, a putative litigant has to allege a violation of his\n                    constitutional rights.",
        "Are there constitutional rights at stake in order for Colin Chan to\n                apply?": "14     Regardless of which interpretation the court\n                    takes ofColin Chan, it will only be applicable if\n                    constitutional rights are involved. This necessitates investigating whether Arts\n                    9, 12 and 14 of the Constitution are in issue. 15     Article 9(1) states: “No person shall\n                    be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.”\n                    Article 9(1) is engaged only if expansive definitions are made of\n                    “life” and “personal liberty”, such that a citizen\n                    has the liberty to lead his life as he pleases. However, our courts have\n                    eschewed such wide interpretations. For example, Choo Han Teck J inLo Pui Sang v Mamata Kapildev Dav and Ors (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd\n                        intervener)[2008] 4 SLR(R) 754 at [6] (“Lo Pui Sang”) said: …I do not think that the phrase ‘personal liberty’ in\n                        Art 9 was a reference to a right of personal liberty to contract. It has\n                        always been understood to refer only to the personal liberty of the person\n                        against unlawful incarceration or detention. Therefore, Art 9 of the Constitution has not been triggered. It should\n                    be noted thatLo Pui Sangwas overturned on appeal\n                    to the Court of Appeal. However, the Court of Appeal did not consider the\n                    constitutional issues that the High Court had considered, seeNg Eng Ghee and others v Mamata Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners\n                        Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal[2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 at\n                    [53]. 16     Article 12(1) reads: All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection\n                        of the law. According to the Court of Appeal inYong Vui Kong v\n                        Public Prosecutor[2010] 3 SLR 489 at [109]\n                    (applyingNguyen Tuong Van v Public Prosecutor[2005] 1 SLR(R) 103 at [70]), s 377A’s differentiating measure would be\n                    consistent with Art 12(1) only if: (a) the classification was founded on an\n                    intelligible differentia; and (b) the differentia bears a rational relation to\n                    the object sought to be achieved by the law in question. On the arguments alone,\n                    this court is of the opinion that Tan’s case does engage Art 12(1).\n                    Although s 377A is founded on an intelligible differentia (because it applies to\n                    sexually-active male homosexuals), it is arguable that there is no social\n                    objective that can be furthered by criminalising male but not female homosexual\n                    intercourse. Therefore,Colin Chanshould\n                    apply. 17     Article 14 guarantees a citizen’s\n                    freedom of speech, assembly and association. Although Tan referred to Art 14 in\n                    his Notice of Appeal, his counsel made no written submissions on this ground.\n                    Consequently, there is no necessity to address it here.",
        "What constitutes an injury or violation of constitutional\n                rights?": "18     Since Art 12 was involved,Colin Chanapplied. Tan needed to show he had suffered an injury\n                    or violation of his constitutional rights. The AG had argued that with the\n                    charge being dropped, Tan was unable to prove his case. This was a mistaken\n                    view. While the act of prosecution itself can be a violation of one’s\n                    constitutional rights, it does not follow that a violation cannot occur without\n                    a prosecution. Karthigesu JA made this abundantly clear inColin Chanat [13], “A citizen should not have to wait\n                    until he is prosecuted before he may assert his constitutional\n                    rights”. 19     There were two ways Tan’s constitutional\n                    rights may arguably have been violated. First, the presence of an\n                    unconstitutional law on the statute books may suffice. The AG had sought to\n                    distinguishColin Chanon the basis that the\n                    parties’ rights there were violated by the ban on certain materials, as\n                    opposed to prosecution. The underlying premise – that the violation must\n                    come from a physical act – was refuted by Karthigesu JA’s following\n                    dicta inColin Chanat [19]: Although we agree with the learned judge that the constitutional rights to\n                        freedom of religion and expression would give the appellantslocus standi, we are not able to agree with her that\n                        the fact that the appellants were facing prosecution for being in possession\n                        of prohibited publications under the Undesirable Publications Act also gives\n                        themlocus standi. We think that this is an\n                        irrelevant consideration in an application for leave to issuecertiorariproceedings. 20     The spectre of future prosecution was the\n                    second way Tan’s rights could be said to have been infringed. This\n                    argument was accepted by the High Court of Australia inCroome and another v State of Tasmania(1997) 142 ALR 397 at 402\n                    and the Hong Kong Court of Appeal inLeung T C William Roy v\n                        Secretary for Justice[2006] HKLRD 211 at [29] (“Leung T C William Roy”), cases cited by\n                    Tan’s counsel. Therefore, Tan’s claim should not be struck out on\n                    the ground that he lackedlocus standialthough it\n                    can be on other grounds dealt with below. 21     In this court’s view,Colin Chandid not introduce a new test for the litigation of\n                    constitutional rights. Nevertheless, it is arguable on the facts that\n                    Tan’s constitutional rights may have been violated. Consequently, he had\n                    satisfied the “substantial interest” test forlocus standi.",
        "Real Controversy requirement": "",
        "Applicable law": "28     The Court of Appeal inGabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin &\n                        Ors[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at [21] emphasised that a high threshold\n                    of failure must be met before it would strike out a claim: …As long as the statement of claim discloses some cause of action,\n                        or raises some question fit to be decided at the trial, the mere fact that\n                        the case is weak and is not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it\n                        out... 29     Similarly, inThe Tokai\n                        Maru[1998] 2 SLR(R) 646 at [44], the Court of Appeal\n                    held: …A reasonable defence means one which has some chance of success\n                        when only the allegations in the pleadings are considered:perLord Pearson inDrummond-Jackson v British Medical Association[1970] 1 All\n                        ER 1094, cited with approval by Rubin J inActive Timber\n                            Agencies Pte Ltd v Allen & Gledhill[1995] 3 SLR(R)\n                        334  . The hearing of the application should not therefore involve\n                        a minute examination of the documents or the facts of the case in order to\n                        see whether there is a reasonable defence. To do that is to usurp the\n                        position of the trial judge and the result is a trial in chambers, on\n                        affidavits only, without discovery and without oral evidence tested by\n                        cross-examination in the ordinary way (seeWenlock v\n                            Moloney[1965] 2 All ER 871). The mere fact that the defence\n                        is weak and not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out, so long\n                        as the pleadings raise some question to be decided by the court (seeAttorney-General of The Duchy of Lancaster v London\n                            and North Western Railway Co[1892] 3 Ch 274). In short, the\n                        defence has to be obviously unsustainable on its face to justify an\n                        application to strike out.",
        "The decision": "24     It is for the reason that there was no real\n                    controversy in issue here that this court affirms the decision made below and\n                    upholds the striking-out order. 25     There was no real controversy here because\n                    while there were specific facts involving specific parties, the facts were\n                    merely hypothetical. Granted, there were identifiable parties with the\n                    “motivation of self-interest” to make the diligent preparation\n                    identified by Abdul Hamid CJ as being essential to the adversarial trial. This\n                    however is insufficient. InSalijah bte Ab Latef v Mohd Irwan\n                        bin Abdullah Teo[1996] 2 SLR(R) 80 at [60], Yong Pung How CJ\n                    held: The primary consideration in this appeal is whether there is a real\n                        contest of the legal rights. The editors of Zamir and Woolf have identified\n                        one rationale for the reluctance of the courts to deal with theoretical\n                        issues - that it distracts the courts from deciding real, subsisting\n                        problems. A stronger reason is that if there is in fact no real issue\n                        subsisting, then the matter would not beres\n                            judicata, nor the issue merged in judgment. In that event, it\n                        would be open for the issue to be reopened again and again. The need for the\n                        existence of a contested dispute is to ensure that there is finality in the\n                        court's judgments as well. 26     Tan had relied onLeung T C\n                        William Royto support his argument. There, the Hong Kong Court\n                    of Appeal (at [28]) accepted there could be adjudication on hypothetical facts,\n                    but only in exceptional cases. The AG sought to distinguish this case on the\n                    basis that it revolved around the International Covenant on Civil and Political\n                    Rights, which Hong Kong has incorporated into its laws. The treaty has no force\n                    of law in Singapore. There are other reasons not to follow the case: (a)     The Hong Kong court’s\n                        criterion of “exceptional cases” was vague. There is a danger\n                        that constitutional challenges may be brought willy-nilly and accepted\n                        blindly under this amorphous phrase. Of course, this may be negated if there\n                        are principled ways to carving out an exception. However, an exceptional\n                        case, by nature, cannot be defined in order to provide guidance by\n                        precedent. (b)     The\n                        Hong Kong court reasoned that access to justice can only be gained by the\n                        applicant breaking the law. It referred to the opinion of Advocate-General\n                        Jacobs inUnion de Pequenos Agricultores v Council of the\n                            European Union[2003] QB 893 at [43]: ... Individuals clearly cannot be required to breach the law in order\n                            to gain access to justice. In Singapore, it is arguable that individuals are not compelled to\n                        resort to such extremes. They can request the President to refer the issue\n                        to the Constitutional Tribunal under Art 100 of the Constitution. As there\n                        is an established procedure through which guidance may be obtained in the\n                        absence of specific facts, there is no reason to relax the “real\n                        controversy” requirement in order to avoid the situation where\n                        individuals break the law in order to obtain standing. It should be noted,\n                        however, that Chan CJ’s extra-judicial view was that Art 100 of the\n                        Constitution was not intended to apply to hypothetical disputes (SMU\n                        Lecture). The basis for his view was that Art 100 was enacted in 1994 to\n                        deal with a specific dispute between organs of state. The following portion\n                        of his speech merits quotation (SMU Lecture at para 4): …Article 100 was enacted for the purpose of resolving actual\n                            and potential disputes of a similar nature between constitutional\n                            organs, and not to obtain advisory opinions on hypothetical cases from\n                            the courts… (c)     Further, there\n                        was nothing at stake for Tan. It bears remembering that Tan had already\n                        pleaded guilty and had been convicted under s 294 of the Penal Code. In\n                        bringing the OS, he stood to benefit from a judicial declaration that s 377A\n                        is unconstitutional while suffering no prejudice, leaving aside the matter\n                        of costs. This arguably goes against the spirit of the adversarial process\n                        where the parties’ conduct is conditioned by the possibility of gain\n                        and/or loss. 27     Given that the charge was dropped, there are\n                    no subsisting facts upon which there can beres\n                        judicata. Hence, it may be argued that Tan’s claim has no\n                    real practical value and should therefore be struck out.",
        "Certainty of failure": "",
        "Legal analysis": "30     Having a high threshold is consistent with the\n                    rationale of the striking-out procedure, that is to filter out claims where no\n                    further investigation could provide any appreciable assistance to the task of\n                    reaching a correct outcome. However, this case does not fall within the\n                    category. Tan’s case was not completely without merit, especially on the\n                    ground of Art 12. Furthermore, his case raised many novel issues that deserved\n                    more detailed treatment, for example: (a)     whether an unconstitutional law in\n                        itself can constitute an injury or violation to one’s constitutional\n                        rights; and (b)     whether Art 14 can encompass a right to express one’s homosexual\n                        sexual orientation. 31     The AG had submitted that Tan was certain to\n                    fail given that he had nolocus standito seek a\n                    declaration that s 377A of the Penal Code contravened the Constitution. This\n                    argument was dealt with under the issue oflocus\n                        standi. Here, the issue is whether the case is so weak, as\n                    gleaned from the pleadings, that it should be struck out because the result is a\n                    foregone conclusion. This threshold has not been satisfied.",
        "The court’s jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief": "",
        "Judicial power and jurisdiction": "32     To grant declaratory relief, the courts have\n                    insisted that the declaration sought must be in relation to a vested right.\n                    Judith Prakash J held inKaraha Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina\n                        Energy Trading Ltd[2006] 1 SLR(R) 112 at [25]: ... CPR Part 40.20 is the rule reflecting the English court's\n                        power to grant declaratory reliefs. This is a new rule and it replaced the\n                        old rule that wasin pari materiawith our O\n                        15 r 16 which, as it may be recalled, reads: No action or other proceedings shall be open to objection on the\n                            ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby,\n                            and the Court may make binding declarationsof\n                                rightwhether or not any consequential relief is or could\n                            be claimed…[emphasis added] The new CPR Part 40.20 differs from the above provision in that it does\n                        not state that a declaration has to be \"of right\". In Singapore, the\n                        legislation concerning the power to grant declaratory reliefs still includes\n                        the requirement that the declaration be one of right. This restriction has\n                        been taken out of the English provisions and the English courts therefore,\n                        arguably, have more wide-ranging powers than we do. When Lord Diplock made\n                        his famous pronouncement inGouriet, the\n                        legislation in force was identical to our O 15 r 16. That same identical\n                        provision was in force (and the exact wording was set out in the judgment)\n                        when Neill LJ held inMeadowsthat he was\n                        bound by Lord Diplock's holding. As a matter of construction of the court's\n                        powers, therefore, as far as the Singapore courts are concerned, the\n                        approach of Lord Diplock is as authoritative as it ever was. This approach\n                        was adopted by the local cases ofSalijah([14]supra) andBritish &\n                            Malayan Trustees([21]supra) where the court agreed that a\n                        declaration should only be granted when it concerned the rights of the\n                        parties represented in the litigation. We found no compelling reason to\n                        change that position. 33     Selvam J explained the reason for this\n                    requirement inSingapore Airlines Limited & Anor v The\n                        Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore & the Comptroller of Income\n                        Tax[1999] 2 SLR(R) 1097 at [23]: That provision [Rules of Court O 15 r 16] does not mean that declaratory\n                        orders can be sought by all and sundry irrespective of whether there was a\n                        justiciable issue between the parties. It can be sought only by persons who\n                        have a right to enforce against a defendant or by persons who say that he\n                        himself is not liable. It is not the function or purpose of the courts to\n                        render legal opinion to indirect parties. 34     This requirement has been satisfied on the\n                    facts since constitutional rights are vested in each person and those of Tan had\n                    been affected. The next step is to determine whether Tan had committed an abuse\n                    of process by not referring the constitutional issue to the High Court under s\n                    56A of the SCA.",
        "Was avoiding s 56A of the SCA an abuse of process?": "35     This was the last ground of the AG’s\n                    arguments that Tan’s claim should be struck out as an abuse of process.\n                    Section 56A(1) of the SCA (“s 56A(1)”) states: Where in any proceedings in a subordinate court a question arises as to\n                        the interpretation or effect of any provision of the Constitution, the court\n                        hearing the proceedings may stay the proceedings on such terms as may be\n                        just to await the decision of the question on the reference to the High\n                        Court. 36     Before proceeding further, it should be noted\n                    that (as the AG pointed out), s 56A had been repealed since 2 January 2011\n                        (vides 430 of the Criminal Procedure Code\n                    2010 (Act No 15 of 2010) (“the CPC 2010”) read with para 105(c) of\n                    the Sixth Schedule of the same Act and para 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code\n                    (Commencement) Notification 2010 (S776/2010)). The Criminal Procedure Code 2010\n                    has an equivalent provision in s 395 of the CPC 2010. Section 56A is\n                    nevertheless applicable in the present case. The CPC 2010 has a transitional\n                    provision which is s 429 CPC 2010. Section 429(2) of the CPC 2010 provides as\n                    follows: (2)   This Code shall not affect — (a)  any inquiry, trial or other\n                        proceeding commenced or pending under the repealed Code before the\n                        appointed day, and every such inquiry, trial or other proceeding may be\n                        continued and everything in relation thereto may be done in all\n                        respects after that day as if this Code had not been enacted;\n                        and (b)  any further proceedings which\n                        may be taken under the repealed Code in respect of any inquiry,\n                        trial or other proceeding which has commenced or is pending before\n                        the appointed day, and such further proceedings may be taken and\n                        everything in relation thereto may be done in all respects after that\n                        day as if this Code had not been enacted. The “appointed day” referred to under s 429(2)(a) of the CPC 2010 is 2 January 2011 (see s 429(25), CPC\n                    2010 read with para 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Commencement) Notification\n                    2010 (S776/2010)). DAC 41402/2010 was commenced before 2 January 2011.\n                    Accordingly, the relevant provision for the court to consider is s\n                56A. 37     Returning to the issue of whether avoidance of\n                    s 56A is an abuse of process, four questions should be considered. The first one\n                    is whether s 56A even applies in the first place. InNg Chye\n                        Huey and another v Public Prosecutor[2007] 2 SLR(R) 106 the\n                    court held: 17    ...These jurisdictional rules are essential to the\n                            orderly conduct of litigation in our courts. Without a sufficiently\n                            clear delineation of the respective spheres of dominion of each level of\n                            our hierarchy of our courts, chaos would inevitably result as parties\n                            seek, willy-nilly and solely for their own advantage, to bring their\n                            applications before different levels of court in an instrumental,\n                            haphazard and legally unprincipled fashion 57    ...Litigants should not be allowed the luxury of\n                            ‘switching’ their cases between the criminal and civil\n                            realms with complete impunity. To allow parties to successfully mount\n                            such arguments would encourage future resort of unorthodox and\n                            objectionable manoeuvres in the hope of circumventing onerous procedural\n                            requirements... Tan had argued that s 56A did not apply because there were no\n                    existing criminal proceedings in place. That argument can be countered by the\n                    fact that criminal proceedings were ongoing at the time Tan applied to challenge\n                    the constitutionality of s 377A. Therefore, s 56A did apply. 38     Second, even if s 56A applied, was it\n                    exclusive? In other words, was it the only means by which a constitutional\n                    question may be raised in Subordinate Court proceedings? There is no clear\n                    evidence that Parliament’s intention was for s 56A to be the exclusive\n                    mode for raising constitutional questions arising in the course of criminal\n                    proceedings in the Subordinate Courts. When debating the Subordinate Courts\n                    (Amendment) Bill, Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (13 April\n                    1993) Vol 61 at column 132, Professor S Jayakumar had commented: Finally, Sir, clause 22 empowers a Subordinate Court to refer any\n                        constitutional issue arising in an action before it to the High Court for\n                        determination. This is only right because a Subordinate Court is not the\n                        appropriate forum to determine such an issue. Provision is made for the\n                        Attorney-General to be heard on any such issue. Yong Pung How CJ noted inChan Hiang Leng Colin and\n                        Others v Public Prosecutor[1994] 3 SLR(R) 209 at\n                    [8]: A crucial aspect of this case was the fact that the lower court was a\n                        Subordinate Court and this court was of course now sitting as an appellate\n                        court. The jurisdiction of the District Court was limited, as there was no\n                        provision in the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321) which was equivalent to\n                        para 1 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap\n                        322) (\"SCJA\") which conferred upon the High Court the power of judicial\n                        review. As such, the District Court could not have determined the\n                        constitutional issues raised. Professor Jayakumar and Yong CJ’s words only go to show why it\n                    is necessary to make a constitutional reference – because the Subordinate\n                    Courts lack the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon such matters. There was no\n                    mention that the reference procedure is exclusive. 39     Then again, despite there being no clear\n                    evidence, it is arguable that a purposive reading of s 56A and its related\n                    case-law indicates an exclusive regime. Tay Yong Kwang J ruled inJohari bin Kanadi and another v Public Prosecutor[2008]\n                    3 SLR(R) 422 at [9] that: …This discretion, properly exercised after judicial consideration\n                        of the merits of the application, will prevent unnecessary delay and\n                        possible abuse every time a party in the proceedings purports to raise an\n                        issue of constitutional interpretation and effect. 40     This purported role of the Subordinate Courts\n                    as the gatekeeper for constitutional issues arising in its proceedings would be\n                    rendered nugatory if the s 56A regime was not mandatory and\n                    exclusive. 41     The third question is even if s 56A is\n                    exclusive, was Tan’s error in not making a s 56A application remediable?\n                    On the one hand, O 2 r 1(3) of the Rules provides that the court is not to set\n                    aside an originating process merely on the basis that it was not the proper one.\n                    On the other hand, an approach which is too relaxed may incentivise parties to\n                    “take their chances” and not make an application under s 56A\n                    first. 42     On the whole, it is more likely that s 56A was\n                    meant as an exclusive regime. However, it cannot be said that it is a\n                    “very clear case” that this is so. Given that a “very clear\n                    case” is a requirement for striking-out, the striking-out application\n                    cannot be granted on this ground.",
        "Conclusion": "43     Having reviewed the law and the applicable\n                    principles, this court is of the view that Tan undoubtedly hadlocus standito raise a constitutional issue as he had\n                    satisfied the “substantial interest” test inColin Chan. It was also not clear on the state of the law as of\n                    24 September 2010 that Tan must apply under s 56A of the SCA to bring his case\n                    to court. What he failed to prove was that there was a real controversy in issue\n                    as the charge had been withdrawn. Consequently, the Appeal is dismissed on this\n                    ground with costs to the AG."
