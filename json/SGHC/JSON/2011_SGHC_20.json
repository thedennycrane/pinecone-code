        "The evidence": "25     During cross-examination, the plaintiff’s position was that he and Gauksheim had the sole right to determine all matters relating to the Assignment and all matters relating to the Vessel, based on cl 8.1.1 of the Agreement (supra[7]). Counsel for the defendants however pointed out that under cl 3.4 of the Agreement, the company’s consent was also needed for the management agreement between NIL and NMPL with which the plaintiff agreed. 26     The plaintiff’s attention was then drawn to cl 6.7 of the Agreement which reads: Any decision of the Board shall be made by a majority vote of the directors present at a duly constituted meeting provided that the following matters shall require the unanimous consent of all the directors of the Board: 6.7.1 entering into any contract (other than in the ordinary course of the Joint Venture Project), arrangement, commitment, or transaction of any nature whatsoever that is of an aggregate value in excess of USD1,000,000.00 … 6.7.3 appointment of the bankers of NIL; … 6.7.5 making any loan or advance or giving credit (other than normal trade credit) to any person; … The plaintiff agreed with counseI for the defendants that even if matters fell squarely within the management and operation provision under cl 8, cl 6.7.1 of the Agreement required the unanimous approval of the board of NIL if such matters involved contracts exceeding US$1m in value. 27     However, the plaintiff disagreed that if a matter involved both operational and financial aspects, as in this case, that the unanimous decision of the board of NIL was required. He opined that if the financial aspects of a matter touched on the charter of the Vessel, he and Gauksheim were entitled to decide under cl 8.1.1without the need to consult the other two directors notwithstanding cl 8.1.3 which stipulated that apart from the matters in cll 8.1.1 and 8.1.2, all other decisions in respect of any other matters must have the unanimous decision of both sides. 28     The plaintiff pointed out that the Time Charter preceded the Agreement and the company was therefore fully aware of the same before it entered into the Agreement. 29     The plaintiff agreed that the Assignment of the Time Charter to NGS was a transaction involving more than US$1m because the Time Charter gave an option to BGP to buy over the Vessel for US$5m at the end of the charter. However, he disagreed that he was thereby required to obtain the unanimous approval of the board of NIL under cl 6.7.1 of the Agreement. 30     At this juncture, it would be appropriate to look at the Early Termination clause under cl 26 of the Time Charter which sub-clause (a) states: For Charterer’s Convenience– The Charterers may terminate this Charter Party at any time by giving the Owners written notice as stated in Box 15 and by paying the settlement stated in Box 14 and the demobilisation charge stated in Box 16, as well as Hire or other payments due under the Charter Party 31     The plaintiff agreed that BGP was not entitled to exercise the early termination clause. The plaintiff further agreed that NIL was neither a party to nor was it told of the MOU dated 23 August 2008 between BGP, NMPL and TGS. 32     The plaintiff had written on behalf of NGS to the company on 29 January 2009 to request a reduction in the charter hire because the Vessel had been laid up since 19 December 2008, and was not producing income as a result of the cancellation of the seismic surveying contract by TGS. The third defendant on behalf of the company rejected the request pointing out that the defendants did not recognise the Assignment and there was therefore no question of NIL discussing the reduction in hire rate with NGS. 33     I should add that when the third defendant on behalf of the company wrote to the plaintiff on 23 October 2008 listing out his breaches of the Agreement, it was stated in para 6 thereof that the plaintiff was either to reinstate the Time Charter or assign the same to a party acceptable to the company. However, the plaintiff’s reply thereto dated 29 October 2008 was written on behalf of NMPL as its CEO. He reiterated that the Assignment fell within cl 8.1.1 of the Agreement together with the subject of the change of name of the Vessel (which was notified to OCBC by Gauksheim). The plaintiff stated he saw no conflict of interest in the Assignment (to NGS) nor in the fact that NGS was assigned the right to the seismic surveying contract with TGS in place of NIL. 34     When the third defendant took the stand, she explained that the defendants’ opposition to the Assignment sprang from the fact that the company invested in NIL because of the Vessel, and the company’s joint venture with the plaintiff was to last for the duration of the Time Charter,viz, for three years. She referred to the Agreement which cll 14.1 and 14.2 stipulate: 14.1  The Joint Venture Project set out within the Agreement shall be for a minimum duration of three (3) years, after this Agreement shall terminate and Parties shall be released hereunder, except in respect of accrued rights, the Parties shall not be under any further obligation to each other. 14.2  Following termination in accordance with clause 14.1 above, the Joint Venture Project shall come to an end and SINWA shall exit from NIL in the manner as follows: … In addition, the company had provided the Guarantee to OCBC for US$16m on behalf of NIL. Hence, all matters touching on the financing of the Vessel were the company’s responsibility under cl 8.1.2 of the Agreement. 35     In order to address the defendants' concerns of the creditworthiness of NGS whom the plaintiff/his counsel claimed was a subsidiary of NIL, counsel for the plaintiff drew to the third defendant’s attention that NGS paid the charter hire for three months from September to December 2008. This claim was incorrect as NGS and NIL had a common shareholder in the plaintiff, not that NIL held all the shares in NGS. The plaintiff had concluded his reply of 29 October 2008 in[33]with a request for a board meeting of NIL to be convened, which request the defendants rejected. However both sides met with OCBC’s representatives in November 2008 to successfully allay the bank’s concerns on the Assignment.",
        "The issue": "36     The entire case turned on the scope and extent of both sides’ rights under cll 8.1.1 and 8.1.2 of the Agreement. 37     The plaintiff relied on the Court of Appeal’s decision inZurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design & Construction Pte Ltd[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“Zurich’scase”) for his submission that no extrinsic evidence should be allowed to interpret the clear wording of cll 8.1.1 and 8.1.2 of the Agreement. In other words, the court should give no weight to the defendants’ contention that because the charter hire collected from BGP was used to service the loan, it was understood that the consent of the second and third defendants was also required for the Assignment. 38     Conversely, the plaintiff argued, the clear wording of cl 8.1.1 meant that he and Gauksheim were the only directors who had the power and authority to decide for NIL whether the Time Charter should be assigned to NGS and whether arbitration proceedings should be commenced against BGP for breach of the Time Charter. In that regard, they and not the defendants had the right to appoint/instruct solicitors on behalf of NIL.",
        "The decision": "39     While cll 8.1.1and 8.1.2 clearly delineated the respective subject matters of each camp’s responsibilities, the position is less clear where, as in this case, there was an overlap of the subject matter. 40     To elaborate, the Assignment of the Time Charter undoubtedly was a matter that related to the Vessel’s operation as well as to BGP and consequently fell within cl 8.1.1 of the Agreement, which was the sole responsibility of the plaintiff and Gauksheim. The decision to enter into the MOU with BGP, TGS and NMPL arguably also came within the ambit of cl 8.1.1, even though NMPL was not mentioned in cl 8.1.1. I should point out too that BGP had the right under cl 17(a) of the Time Charter assign the Time Charter with the consent of NIL, which consent was not to be unreasonably withheld. 41     While the defendants were not entitled to rely on extrinsic evidence to interpret cll 8.1.1 and 8.1.2 of the Agreement,Zurich’scase and s 94(f) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) allow the court to look at the context in which the Agreement was entered into. Section 94(f) states: Exclusion of evidence of oral agreement 94    When the terms of any such contract, grant or other disposition of property, or any matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, have been proved according to section 93, no evidence of any oral agreement or statement shall be admitted as between the parties to any such instrument or their representatives in interest for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from its terms subject to the following provisions: … (f)    any fact may be proved which shows in what manner the language of a document is related to existing facts. 42     It was common ground that the company entered into the Agreement with the plaintiff as the financier of NIL. Because of that premise and the loan to NIL for which the company furnished the Guarantee, the defendants were very concerned with NIL’s financial position. It was also not in dispute that the charter hire received from BGP was utilised to service the interest on the loan. While it was the plaintiff and/or Gauksheim who issued the monthly invoices to BGP for hire due and payable, the payments received were credited directly to NIL’s account with OCBC and came within the purview of the second and third defendants’ responsibility under cl 8.1.2. The creditworthiness of BGP’s assignee,vizNGS was therefore a matter of concern to the three defendants. Should there be a default in payment by NGS of charter hire, the loan would not be serviced. In the worst case scenario, OCBC would recall the same and look to the company under the Guarantee to make good any shortfall/default in the payment of interest as well as repayment of the loan itself. 43     Consequently, although I would answer in the negative the question whether there was an agreement that the company would be responsible for the collection of charter hire, because of the factual matrix under which the Agreement was executed, the plaintiff nonetheless was obliged to consult the company and the second/third defendants, should payment of charter hire from BGP cease as it did after the Assignment was executed. 44     It is my view therefore that the matter of the Assignment and the MOU overlapped under cll 8.1.1.and 8.1.2. For that reason, cl 8.1.3 came into play. The plaintiff should have informed if not consulted the second and third defendants on the matter, and the parties were obliged to come to a unanimous decision both on the Assignment and the MOU as well as on appointing lawyers to pursue NIL’s claim against BGP. The plaintiff should also have demonstrated the creditworthiness of NGS in order to persuade the second and third defendants to accept NGS as the substitute charterer in place of BGP. 45     If there was no unanimity on the issue, the parties were obliged to proceed to arbitration under cl 16.2 of the Agreement which states: Any and all dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC Rules”) for the time being in force at the commencement of the arbitration, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause. 46     On their part, the defendants should not have been so hasty and instructed solicitors to pursue a claim against BGP for breach of the Time Charter without first consulting the plaintiff. 47     Consequently, in regard to the OS, I dismiss all six reliefs prayed for by the plaintiff. The dispute should have been referred to the SIAC for arbitration as provided for in cl 16.2 of the Agreement. The plaintiff shall pay the defendants their costs as one set which are to be taxed unless otherwise agreed."
