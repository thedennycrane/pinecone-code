        "The prosecution’s case": "2        It was the prosecution’s case that\n\non 7 January 2002, at about 10.30 pm, Pandi had been dropped off after work at Yishun MRT\n\nstation, upon which he decided to go and visit his friend, who lived in Sembawang. Pandi\n\nwas an illegal immigrant offender, who had been issued a special pass by the immigration\n\ndepartment. Along the way, he stopped by a ‘Cheers’ outlet, at Blk 291 Yishun\n\nRing Road, to buy a bottle of beer. Subsequently, he changed his mind about visiting his\n\nfriend and went back to Yishun MRT station to take a look at the ‘pasar malam’\n\nthat was going on there. At about 1 am, in the early hours of the morning of 8 January\n\n2002, he stopped by the same ‘Cheers’ outlet to buy a second bottle of beer. On\n\nhis way into the store, he was called by the appellant and Kumar, who were sitting on the\n\ncompound wall, facing the front entrance of the ‘Cheers’ outlet. He waved at\n\nthem and asked them to \"hold on\". After buying his beer, he came out and joined\n\nthem on the compound wall. They enquired after his nationality and he replied that he was\n\nfrom India.3        At about 2.15 am, the appellant and Kumar\n\ngot up and went to the side entrance of the ‘Cheers’ outlet. They then returned\n\nand the appellant asked Pandi how much money he had with him. When Pandi replied that he\n\nhad no money, Kumar spoke to him in a very harsh tone \"big brother is asking, why\n\ndon’t you hand over your money\". About 10 minutes later, Kumar moved four to\n\nfive metres away from Pandi and the appellant, towards the shop next to the\n\n‘Cheers’ outlet. The appellant then asked again whether Pandi had any money.\n\nWhen Pandi gave a negative reply, the appellant slapped him on his cheek. Pandi asked the\n\nappellant why he had slapped him and the appellant slapped him again. Being fearful, Pandi\n\nopened his wallet for the appellant to see. The appellant then took a $50 note and what\n\nlater turned to be a copy of the special pass belonging to Pandi and moved off to join\n\nKumar.4        Pandi went to call the police, using the\n\npublic phone located at the side entrance of the ‘Cheers’ outlet. When he\n\nreturned to where the appellant and Kumar were previously, he found only the appellant\n\nthere. He approached the appellant and pleaded with him at least, to return the special\n\npass to him. At this point in time, the appellant used a lighter and burnt the copy of the\n\nspecial pass before throwing its remains over the compound wall.5        Pandi gave evidence that he called the\n\npolice three times in total. At 2.40 am, two police officers arrived at the scene, PW2 Sgt\n\nZulkarnaian (\"Sgt Zul\") and PW3 Cpl Azhar Sukaimi (\"Cpl Azhar\"). Upon\n\ntheir arrival, Pandi told them that he had been robbed and assaulted by the appellant,\n\nwhereupon the appellant was placed under arrest.6        On 9 January 2002, Pandi\n\nreturned to the scene of crime with the Investigating Officer, PW3, Cpl M. Saravanan\n\n(\"Cpl Saravanan\"). Whilst inside the ‘Cheers’ outlet, they met Kumar,\n\nwho was coincidentally there as well. Cpl Saravanan overheard Kumar asking Pandi\n\n\"what happened the other night. Are you ok?\". When Pandi identified Kumar as the\n\nsecond Indian man on the night that he was robbed and assaulted, Kumar was also placed\n\nunder arrest by Cpl Saravanan.",
        "The appellant’s defence": "7        The appellant maintained\n\nthat on the night of 7 January 2002 he was with Kumar at a coffee shop at Blk 291 Yishun\n\nRing Road, drinking alcoholic drinks with some friends. Prior to that, he had taken some\n\nChinese wines at home. Subsequently, the appellant and Kumar went to another coffee shop\n\nat Blk 285 to meet other friends. From the coffee shop, the appellant gave evidence that\n\nhe and Kumar moved off to the ‘Cheers’ outlet. He could not recall the time they\n\narrived at the outlet.8        A CCTV recording together\n\nwith a set of 10 still photographs taken from the recording, were produced by the defence\n\nand admitted in court. They were taken from the video cameras at the ‘Cheers’\n\noutlet, facing the cashier, the side entrance and the main entrance. One of the\n\nphotographs had shown the appellant wheeling his bicycle, near the side entrance of the\n\n‘Cheers’ outlet, at about 12 midnight.9        The appellant testified\n\nthat he and Kumar had gone to the compound wall outside the front entrance of the\n\n‘Cheers’ outlet, near a blue dustbin and sat down. He took another drink.\n\nBecause of all the alcoholic drinks he had, as well as some Chinese wines he had drunk at\n\nhome prior to setting off for the coffee shop, he dozed off. He only woke up at about 2\n\nam.10        When the appellant was\n\ntold that the CCTV recording showed that he was seen going towards the side entrance of\n\nthe ‘Cheers’ outlet at about 2.17 am and joining Kumar, the appellant testified\n\nthat both of them had intended to go home, and he was pushing his bicycle.11        Both of them then moved\n\noff from the scene. According to the appellant, he had not noticed the presence of Pandi.\n\nAfter Kumar left, the appellant returned to the scene with his bicycle, intending to rest\n\nfurther before going home. It was then that Pandi came up to him and threatened to\n\n\"finish him off\". Being terrified, he rushed into the ‘Cheers’ outlet\n\nto call the police. He testified that the staff at the ‘Cheers’ outlet called\n\nthe police for him on his behalf and he too called the police from inside the\n\n‘Cheers’ outlet. While waiting inside the store for the police to arrive,\n\nsuddenly, someone from outside came and pushed him and he fell outside the store.12        When the police arrived,\n\nhe went towards them and complained of the threat on his life by Pandi. However, he was\n\narrested and charged for jointly committing robbery of $50 and hurting Pandi.",
        "The decision below": "13        The district judge was of the view that he\n\nhad no valid reason to disbelieve Pandi and accepted his evidence that he was robbed and\n\nassaulted. He rejected the defence of the appellant and Kumar that they were not involved\n\nin robbing and causing hurt to Pandi as he had difficulty in accepting various aspects of\n\ntheir evidence and that they had contradicted each other on the following material aspects\n\nof the case :-i whether the appellant was sleeping at the compound wall at the\n\n    material time;ii whether the appellant was at all aware of the presence of Pandi at\n\n    the compound wall at the material time;iii whether Pandi had seen Kumar at all at the compound wall at the\n\n    material time.14        The district judge found\n\nthat the appellant and Kumar had failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the\n\nprosecution’s case and convicted them of the charge, sentencing them to six years\n\nimprisonment each. In view of the age of the appellant and Kumar, who were both over 50\n\nyears old, no sentence of caning was imposed.",
        "The appeal": "15        For the charge under s 394\n\nof the Penal Code to be made out, the prosecution had to prove the following elements\n\nagainst the appellant; first, that the appellant committed robbery of $50 in the\n\npossession of Pandi and secondly, that the appellant voluntarily caused hurt in doing so,\n\nby slapping Pandi twice on the cheek.16        Before me, counsel for the\n\nappellant’s submissions were essentially that on the totality of the evidence before\n\nthe district judge, the prosecution had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt and\n\nthat the district judge had erred in fact and in law to hold so. Counsel for the appellant\n\nfurther urged this court to review and examine the evidence in order to come to an\n\nindependent finding on each issue of fact.17        The principles applicable\n\nwhenever an appellate court carries out the unenviable task of evaluating a trial\n\njudge’s findings of fact are well entrenched. It is trite law that an appellate court\n\nwill not disturb the findings of fact of the trial judge unless they can be shown to be\n\nagainst the weight of evidence :Ng Soo Hin v PP[1994] 1 SLR 105. If the appellate\n\ncourt wishes to reverse the trial judge’s decision, it must not merely entertain\n\ndoubts as to whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong :PP\n\nv Poh Oh Sim[1991] 3 MLJ 416;PP v Azman bin Abdullah[1998] 2 SLR 704.\n\nNevertheless, while an appellate court should be reluctant to interfere with a finding of\n\nfact, it is always free to form an independent opinion about the proper inference to be\n\ndrawn from a finding of fact. The circumstances of this case required me to keep this\n\nfirmly in mind and, having lay out the principles, I will now move on to examine the\n\nevidence proper.18        Counsel for the appellant\n\nsubmitted that the district judge had totally failed to appreciate that the first\n\ninformation report (FIR) of Pandi was contrary to his evidence in court. The time that\n\nthis FIR was made was recorded at 02.21.40 on 8 January 2002 and the text read \"Two\n\nIndian man unknown to me stole my special pass and running off\".19        The first thing to note\n\nabout the FIR was that it was conspicuously silent on the loss of $50 through robbery and\n\nthe slapping incident. No doubt, the main purpose of an FIR is merely to give information\n\nof a cognizable offence to set the police in motion and need not contain the entire case\n\nfor the prosecution :Tan Pin Seng v PP[1998] 1 SLR 418;PP v Pardeep Singh[1999] 3 SLR 116. Nevertheless, it cannot be said that omissions in the FIR would always be of no\n\nsignificance, since the FIR, while not being substantive evidence, is after all a piece of\n\ncorroborative evidence. Omissions as to material facts in the FIR could,ceteris\n\nparibus, deprive the prosecution of the most valuable corroboration and thereby make\n\nthe complainant’s story suspicious :Herchun Singh v PP[1969] 2 MLJ 209. I\n\nfurther noted that in the present case the FIR did not contain mere omissions of material\n\nfacts, but that the offence disclosed in it had been entirely inconsistent with that of\n\nwhich the appellant was charged and convicted, in relation to both the act and the subject\n\nmatter of the offence.20        At paragraph 198 of his\n\njudgment, the district judge stated that he did not regard this inconsistency as a major\n\none, discrediting the victim’s evidence completely. He dealt with the inconsistency\n\nas such :it appeared to me that having been convicted as an\n\n    illegal immigrant, the victim was more concerned at that time about his Special Pass. Even\n\n    in his evidence in chief, the victim stated that he asked [the appellant] to at least\n\n    return his Special Pass. He told [the appellant] that \"they can keep the money\".21        With due respect to the\n\ndistrict judge, in drawing such an inference, he had failed completely to consider that\n\nthe special pass allegedly taken away from Pandi was merelya copyof the original.\n\nCpl Saravanan confirmed that Pandi had produced the original special pass on 9 January\n\n2002 at the police station. To concentrate, in making the call to the police, on the theft\n\nor robbery ofa copyof the special pass, when a relatively large sum was taken\n\naway (Pandi earns $10 a day as a cleaner at the Seletar Golf Country Club) and hurt was\n\ncaused, seemed to me to be open to doubt.22        In addition, even though\n\nPandi had mentioned in P3 that the two Indian men were \"running off\", he\n\ntestified during trial that the appellant was in a drunken stupor and, after robbing and\n\nassaulting him, the appellant had walked with faltering steps to join Kumar, who had moved\n\naway towards the shop next to the ‘Cheers’ outlet. Pandi confirmed in court that\n\nhe did not see anybody running off and that he was keeping an eye over the appellant when\n\nmaking the call to the police, as he was worried that the appellant would run away. It was\n\nalso his evidence that, after he finished the call, he turned around and saw the appellant\n\nwalking to and fro, even though Kumar was no longer at the scene.23        During his testimony in\n\ncourt, Pandi attempted to explain that he did tell the police during the call that\n\n\"my special pass go already, my $50 go already\". Even if I were to accept that\n\nthis was so and that there were communication difficulties due to Pandi’s mother\n\ntongue being Tamil, it did not make any sense that the location, like the text, should be\n\nincorrect as well. This was because of what was revealed when Pandi was cross-examined on\n\nthe inconsistencies in the FIR:Q :    I am asking you about the first time when you\n\n    called the police. P3 (the FIR) was shown to you and the caller’s name was Pandi and\n\n    you confirmed that it was you.A:    Yes, but I did not mention anything about the\n\n    location.--------------------------------------------------------Q:    You took 2 to 3 minutes to tell\n\n    them two Indian men took your pass and ran off.A:    I could not communicate in English and I was\n\n    stammering and stuttering. They managed to trace the location of the phone from the number\n\n    I called.24        Pandi had stated quite\n\nclearly that he had not mentioned anything about the location. If it was true that nothing\n\nwas mentioned about the location, the logical conclusion to draw from that must be that\n\nthe police had managed to trace the call, since the location in the FIR was clearly stated\n\nas \"301, Yishun Ave 2, 769093, Yishun Mrt stn\". And yet this was not the correct\n\nlocation where the alleged offence of robbery with hurt, was committed. This raised some\n\nsuspicions as to whether Pandi was, altogether, a truthful witness.25        In my view, the\n\ninconsistencies relating to the FIR could not be lightly disregarded, affecting the\n\ncredibility of Pandi to a large extent. The district judge was not able to reach the same\n\nconclusion as me, with respect to the credibility of Pandi, as he had placed insufficient\n\nweight on the inconsistencies between the FIR and Pandi’s evidence in court. It\n\nfollowed that Pandi’s evidence should be placed under greater scrutiny, especially\n\nwhen the prosecution’s case rested primarily on his evidence that it was the\n\nappellant who had robbed him of $50 and slapped him.26        The circumstances under\n\nwhich the police came to arrive at Blk 291 Yishun Ring Road, where the alleged offence\n\ntook place, further complicated the case for the prosecution. Cpl Saravanan gave evidence\n\nthat when the police were dispatched to Yishun MRT station, they found no sign of a case\n\nthere. Another mobile patrol was able to arrive at the correct location, at the\n\n‘Cheers’ outlet, only because of the FIR of the appellant, who had called the\n\npolice at 2.35 am on 8 January 2002 from the ‘Cheers’ outlet itself. Sgt Zul and\n\nCpl Azhar, who arrived at the scene, testified that the appellant was waiting for them\n\noutside the ‘Cheers’ outlet and he approached them first, followed by Pandi. In\n\nmy view, the actions of the appellant in waiting for and approaching the police were\n\ncertainly not consistent with those of someone who had just committed an offence of\n\nrobbery with hurt.27        No doubt, it seemed\n\nstrange that the appellant should complain of a threat on his life by someone who was a\n\nstranger to him. However, to draw the conclusion from that, as the district judge did,\n\nthat the appellant must have seen Pandi calling the police and called the police as well\n\nin order to avoid any suspicions, was erroneous for the simple reason that it was\n\nunsupported by any evidence. There was no evidence whatsoever that the appellant had seen\n\nPandi making a call, not to mention a call to the police. In fact, it was Pandi’s own\n\nevidence that, whilst he was making the call to the police, the appellant had walked with\n\nfaltering steps towards Kumar, as he (the appellant) was drunk. It was highly improbable\n\nthat, while being drunk and unsteady on his feet, the appellant still managed to observe\n\nPandi making a call at the telephone booth, concluded that it was a call to the police and\n\nthen devised his own strategy to call the police in order to throw them off his tracks.28        In relation to the copy of\n\nthe special pass, there was no evidence to corroborate that it had been burnt by the\n\nappellant or that it even existed at all. Sgt Zul confirmed that he searched the area at\n\nthe scene that night for evidence of any burnt paper but was unable to find anything. Cpl\n\nSaravanan testified that, when he went to the scene the following day, the place had\n\nalready been washed and cleaned, so he would not know whether there was any evidence of\n\nany burnt paper. Before me, the prosecution submitted that it was not at all surprising\n\nthat the police officers were unable to find anything since it was in the early hours of\n\nthe morning and ash was essentially what they were looking for. I must say, however, that\n\nthe evidence on this point was rather equivocal and any reservations as to whether the\n\nspecial pass had indeed been burnt by the appellant should be resolved in favour of the\n\nappellant, since the prosecution bore the burden of proof.29        The $50 that was allegedly\n\nrobbed from Pandi was also never recovered. Sgt Zul and Cpl Azhar testified that they had\n\neach conducted a search on the appellant at the scene that night but both of them were\n\nunable to find anything other than a lighter, cigarettes and some personal belongings. In\n\nthe district judge’s view, that the $50 note from the victim was never found did not\n\nmean that the victim was not robbed of the $50. He went on further to say (at para 188) :it is pertinent to note here that after B1 (the\n\n    appellant) had physically robbed the victim, he was seen going towards B2 (Kumar). B1 had\n\n    testified that he did go away with B2 before returning to the scene, while B2 had\n\n    completely disappeared from the scene.30        The district judge then\n\ndrew the inference that the appellant must have given the cash to Kumar as there was no\n\none else who was seen near the appellant and Kumar. Such an inference presupposed that the\n\nappellant had indeed robbed Pandi of the $50 note. With due respect to the district judge,\n\nthis was unsupported by any evidence and should be rejected for being entirely\n\nspeculative. Even though I agreed with the prosecution that there is really no rule of law\n\nthat the fruits of a crime must be recovered before the charge against an accused is\n\nproven, I was of the view that, taking into account the surrounding circumstances of this\n\ncase and the need to place a greater scrutiny on Pandi’s evidence, the failure to\n\nrecover the $50 from the appellant considerably weakened the prosecution’s case.31        Next, I come to\n\nPandi’s claim that the appellant had slapped him twice on his cheek. Pandi testified\n\nin court that the appellant had used his right hand to slap him. There is no medical\n\nevidence to corroborate this allegation other than the testimony of Sgt Zul, who informed\n\nthe court that both the cheeks of Pandi were swollen. Cpl Azhar gave evidence that he had\n\nnot been able to see clearly whether Pandi had any visible injury, as it was dark. As for\n\nCpl Saravanan, he testified that, when he first saw Pandi on 9 January 2002, he did not\n\nsee any swelling. Pandi informed Cpl Saravanan that he did not seek medical attention, as\n\nhe did not know that the cost would be borne by the police and thought that he would have\n\nto pay.32        Counsel for the appellant\n\nsubmitted that the district judge erred in that Sgt Zul’s testimony should not be\n\nrelied upon as the basis to find that hurt was caused to Pandi. It was further submitted\n\nthat hurt, pain and swelling are issues requiring proof by medical experts and Sgt Zul was\n\nnot a doctor who could testify on this crucial aspect of the case against the appellant. I\n\nwas unable to accept this contention. Whether hurt is caused, is a finding of fact, which\n\nis not necessarily to be always corroborated by evidence given by medical experts. A trial\n\njudge is entitled to find that hurt has been caused, with or without medical evidence, if\n\nhe is convinced that it has been proven, in light of all the evidence before him.33        In the present case, it\n\nwas the evidence of Pandi that there was a passer-by at the scene that night, who was\n\nwatching the whole incident from a distance. He testified that it was the passer-by who\n\nhad advised him to call the police. He further testified that the passer-by had pushed the\n\nappellant to the ground and that he went forward to try and help the appellant up but was\n\nbrushed aside. When asked during cross-examination why he still wanted to help the\n\nappellant up when the appellant had robbed and slapped him, Pandi replied that it was the\n\npasser-by who asked him to help the appellant up. The appellant confirmed that someone had\n\npushed him while he was waiting in the ‘Cheers’ outlet for the police to arrive\n\nand that he fell outside the store as a result. This was corroborated by the CCTV\n\nrecording. The still photograph at 02:42:39 showed a man in a vertically-striped shirt\n\nwith his hand on the appellant’s shoulder. The next still photograph at 02:42:43\n\nshowed the appellant on the ground. The same man in the vertically-striped shirt was seen\n\ntalking to the police, in the still photograph at 02:46:56.34        By Pandi’s own\n\naccount, this passer-by was there all the while, being the only one at the scene that\n\nnight other than himself, Kumar and the appellant. In my view, the passer-by was very much\n\na material witness. Since he was at the scene and had, apparently, observed the entire\n\nincident, he would have been able to witnessthe appellant slapping Pandi.The\n\npasser-by would also have been able to shed some light as to why he had pushed the\n\nappellant to the ground and then subsequently asked Pandi to help him up. The failure on\n\nthe part of the prosecution to call such a material witness to give evidence, entitled me\n\nto draw an adverse inference against the prosecution under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act\n\n(Cap 97).35        It was true that the\n\nappellant was not able to give proper explanations, with respect to his actions during the\n\nmaterial time and, in this regard, his defence was not entirely up to scratch. He claimed\n\nto have dozed off while Kumar gave evidence in court that between 12 midnight and 2 am on\n\n8 January 2002, they had been conversing on family and personal problems. The\n\nappellant’s evidence was also inconsistent with Kumar’s, as to whether the\n\nappellant was aware of the presence of Pandi and whether Kumar had seen Pandi at all\n\noutside the ‘Cheers’ outlet. It must be remembered, however, that the appellant\n\nhad been somewhat intoxicated at the material time and during his testimony in court,\n\nPandi had confirmed several times the appellant’s state of intoxication. It was not\n\nimprobable that his account of the events could be somewhat affected by his intoxication.\n\nMore importantly, the burden of proof was still on the prosecution to prove the\n\nappellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, however tenuous the defence might have\n\nbeen :Tan Edmund v PP[1995] 2 SLR 102. In discharging this burden, it was not at\n\nall sufficient for the prosecution to merely point to the inadequacies of the\n\nappellant’s testimony.36        Having examined the\n\nevidence carefully and assessed the case in its entirety, I was of the view that, even\n\nthough the appellant was unable to establish an affirmative defence to prove his\n\ninnocence, his conviction was unsafe and an acquittal would be in order, as the\n\nprosecution had not succeeded in proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt :Tan Buck\n\nTee v PP[1961] MLJ 176;Ang Kah Kee v PP[2002] 2 SLR 104. The FIR was full of\n\ninaccuracies. Neither the special pass nor the $50 note was ever recovered by the police.\n\nThe prosecution also failed to call a material witness to corroborate Pandi’s version\n\nof events, even though it was claimed by Pandi that the material witness had watched the\n\nentire incident and had advised Pandi to call the police. In the circumstances, I allowed\n\nthe appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeRepublic of SingaporeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
