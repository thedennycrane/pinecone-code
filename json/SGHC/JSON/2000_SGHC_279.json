        "Heineken Beer (Items 181 to 184\n\nof the Summary)": "8\n\n        After my grounds of decision were delivered on\n\n30 May 2000, the defendant appealed against my findings in Registrar's Appeal No. 600217\n\nof 2000. He directed his appeal at paragraph 15 of my grounds of decision, which dealt\n\nwith items 15, 16 and 29 of the Summary. As regards item 15, I found that the plaintiffs\n\npurchased 12,000 cartons of beer at $189,600 (or $15.80 per carton). As regards item 16, I\n\nfound that the plaintiffs purchased 22,500 cartons of beer at $355,500 (or $15.80 per\n\ncarton). As regards item 29, I found that the plaintiffs purchased 20,000 cartons of beer\n\nat $310,000 (or $15.50 per carton). I had then decided that for these 3 items, the\n\nplaintiffs should be credited with the cost of the 54,500 cartons of beer, i.e. $855,100,\n\nand that these transactions should be reflected in the profit and loss account as\n\ntransactions that did not make any profits or losses.9\n\n        On 21 September 2000, M P H Rubin J allowed the\n\nappeal and ordered that a sum of $177,000 be credited to the defendant in the taking of\n\nthe accounts. Rubin J decided as follows:Inasmuch as the invoice from\n\n    Thai-Pore Enterprise Pte Ltd dated 27 August 1990 reflects a figure of $177,000 payable to\n\n    the Chief Engineer, Mekong Express and that this document admittedly was produced and was\n\n    in the possession of the plaintiff, credit ought to be given to the defendant for the said\n\n    sum of $177,000. In my view, the non-cross-examination of the defendant on this matter\n\n    does not assist the plaintiff much. The plaintiffs are known to be dealing with Thai-Pore\n\n    all along. They could have done much to clarify this issue had they wanted to, very much\n\n    earlier. The issue in relation to this sum was raised at the hearing below but\n\n    unfortunately had not been dealt with. In the premises, the appeal by the defendant is\n\n    allowed only to the extent that a sum of $177,000 be credited to the defendant in the\n\n    taking of the accounts.10\n\n        As regards the proper accounting treatment of\n\nthis order, it appears from Rubin J's grounds of decision dated 29 November 2000 that what\n\nhe intended was for the entry of $855,100 to the plaintiffs' credit in the\n\n\"remittances\" account to be reduced by the sum of $177,000 to $678,100. (See\n\nparagraphs 17 and 31 of Rubin J's grounds of decision.)11\n\n        During the appeal, the defendant claimed that\n\nhe should only be charged $133,000 (instead of $310,000) for the 20,000 cartons of beer\n\nenumerated at item 29 of the Summary. He referred to the invoice dated 27 August 1990 from\n\nThai-Pore Enterprise Pte Ltd (\"Thai-Pore\"), which the plaintiffs had exhibited\n\nto support the contention that the 20,000 cartons of beer cost $310,000. The invoice\n\nstated the price of the 20,000 cartons of beer to be $310,000. However, Thai-Pore deducted\n\nthe sum of $177,000 from the price on account of \"PAYMENT TO BE MADE IN PHNOM PENH TO\n\nCHIEF ENGINEER OF MEKING EXPRESS, MR TAN\" and charged the plaintiffs only the balance\n\nsum of $133,000. The defendant claimed that he had arranged for a Cambodian called Yuri to\n\npay this sum of $177,000 from the proceeds of sale of the beer.12\n\n        However, the defendant presented a slightly\n\ndifferent picture in his affidavit filed on 11 October 1997, which he relied on for the\n\ntaking of accounts. The defendant claimed as follows at paragraph 52 of that affidavit:I did enter into transactions to\n\n    sell beer sent to me by the Plaintiffs. I remember the beer transactions quite well\n\n    because I remember telling Fung that there was a poor market for such goods in Vietnam. We\n\n    could only make a very small margin if any at all. Fung insisted that we should try to\n\n    sell the beer and simply shipped the beer to me. I had no choice but to accept the goods\n\n    he sent to me in Vietnam, so I did my best to sell all of it. ... There were a total of\n\n    54,500 cartons of beer in the 26 containers. I sold 38,500 cartons to a Cambodian by the\n\n    name of Yuri (or sometimes spelt You Ri). I sold the other 16,000 cartons to another\n\n    Cambodian. I have no documents for the sale to the second Cambodian so I cannot remember\n\n    the actual selling price or whether I was able to collect all the money due. As for the\n\n    sale of beer to Yuri, Yuri wrote the accounts himself in Cambodian and I got the accounts\n\n    translated into Chinese so that I could read them also. ... I remember that Yuri paid a\n\n    total of US$132,447 in cash to me. On Fung's instructions, I then asked Yuri to pay\n\n    US$163,927 directly to a rubber supplier in part-payment of rubber we have bought from the\n\n    supplier. This is the rubber transaction in the \"Purchase\" portion of Statement\n\n    of Account 1 dated 10.9.90 (by Mekong Express). However, Yuri never paid up the balance of\n\n    US$30,876. I have never been able to collect this money. This is a case of a \"bad\n\n    debt\" and these were the risks when doing business in Vietnam.13\n\n        The rubber transaction referred to by the\n\ndefendant was the rubber transaction at item 67 of the Summary, for which a sum of\n\n$494,272.50 (or US$279,250 at an exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.77) was credited to the\n\ndefendant. Both Khoo J and I found that the defendant had been given full credit for this\n\ntransaction. The defendant also exhibited what he alleged to be an English translation of\n\nthe accounts prepared by Yuri. According to this document:(1)    Yuri\n\n    purchased from the defendant a shipment of 18,500 cases of Heineken Beer at a total of\n\n    US$157,250 (or US$8.50 per case);(2)    Yuri\n\n    purchased from the defendant a shipment of 20,000 cases of Heineken Beer at a total of\n\n    US$170,000 (or US$8.50 per case);(3)    Yuri paid\n\n    the defendant a total of US$133,135 in cash;(4)    Yuri paid a\n\n    sum of US$163,927 for rubber; and(5)    After\n\n    taking into account various other transactions between Yuri and the defendant, Yuri owed\n\n    the defendant a balance of US$30,876.14\n\n        The thrust of the defendant's evidence as\n\ncontained in his affidavit filed on 11 October 1997 was that the defendant had sold 38,500\n\ncartons of beer to Yuri at a price of US$327,250 and was unable to account for the\n\nproceeds of sale of the remaining 16,000 cartons of beer. The defendant further claimed\n\nthat the total value that he received from Yuri for the 38,500 cartons of beer was only\n\nUS$296,374, of which US$132,447 was paid in cash and US$163,927 was paid to the rubber\n\nsupplier. The defendant alleged that he was \"never ... able\" to collect the\n\nbalance of US$30,876, but he did not give a reason why this was so. The defendant did not\n\nallege in any of his four affidavits referred to during the taking of accounts (the\n\ndefendant's affidavits filed on 11 October 1997 and 12 May 1998, and two affidavits filed\n\non 23 February 2000) that the 20,000 cartons of beer under item 29 of the Summary were\n\nworth only $133,000 (instead of $310,000). The argument that the defendant should not be\n\ncharged the $177,000 allegedly paid to the rubber supplier first surfaced in his counsel's\n\nwritten submissions filed on 3 April 2000.15\n\n        As the defendant did not deny receiving and\n\nselling the 54,500 cartons of beer, the burden was on him to account for the proceeds of\n\nsale of these goods. Even if the defendant's allegations were accepted at face value, he\n\nwould only have accounted for part of the proceeds of sale for 38,500 cartons of beer. It\n\nwas not enough for the defendant to claim that he could not remember the actual selling\n\nprice or whether he was able to collect all the money due. Nor was it sufficient for the\n\ndefendant to simply say that he was unable to collect the sum of US$30,876 from Yuri\n\nwithout explaining what efforts he made to collect the debt. The defendant failed to\n\naccount at all for the proceeds of sale of the remaining 16,000 cartons of beer, which\n\nmight well have been sold at a tidy profit. In his affidavits, the defendant did not\n\ndistinguish between the cartons of beer referred to in items 15, 16 and 29 of the Summary,\n\nso it was impossible to tell whether the proceeds of sale that were unaccounted for\n\nrelated to item 15, item 16 or item 29 of the Summary. All things considered, the\n\ndefendant failed to satisfy me on the evidence that he had in fact sold the 54,500 cartons\n\nof beer at a global loss. The plaintiffs also failed to prove that the defendant had sold\n\nthe beer at a profit. It was for this reason that I had earlier directed that in so far as\n\nthe \"remittance\" for beer was concerned, the plaintiffs should be credited with\n\nthe cost of the beer, i.e. $855,100, and that the beer transactions be reflected in the\n\nprofit and loss account as transactions that did not make any profit or loss.16\n\n        In so deciding, I had noted the defendant's\n\nsubmission that the $177,000 referred to in the Thai-Pore invoice was paid to the chief\n\nengineer of the Mekong Express by or on behalf of the defendant. However, when I wrote my\n\ngrounds of decision dated 30 May 2000, I did not think it was necessary for me to comment\n\non this allegation. Even if the defendant had utilised part of the proceeds from the sale\n\nof the beer to pay the chief engineer of the Mekong Express, this did not diminish the\n\nvalue of the goods received by the defendant from the plaintiffs. The sole function of the\n\naccount of \"remittances\" was to show the value of the goods and cash sent by the\n\nplaintiffs to the defendant for use in their joint venture. The account of\n\n\"remittances\" was not designed to show how the proceeds of sale were utilised.\n\nThe utilisation of funds received by the defendant for the purpose of purchases would be\n\nreflected in the account of \"purchases\". The plaintiffs had, under item 67 of\n\nthe Summary, already given the defendant full credit for all sums paid by the defendant\n\nfor the Mekong Express rubber. The only way in which the account of\n\n\"remittances\" could, for a specific item, reflect an amount that was less than\n\nthe cost of the goods represented by that item was if the goods were sold at a loss by the\n\ndefendant. Only then would the value received by the defendant in respect of the goods be\n\nless than the cost of the goods.17\n\n        Putting the defendant's case in relation to the\n\nThai-Pore invoice at its highest, it simply meant that a total of US$163,927 from the\n\nproceeds of sale of the beer was utilised in part-payment of the price of US$279,250 paid\n\nfor the Mekong Express Rubber. There was no evidence that the defendant paid for the beer\n\nout of his own pocket. Khoo J found (at paragraph 2 of his written judgment) that all of\n\nthe defendant's purchases were funded by the plaintiffs. There was also no evidence that\n\nthe 20,000 cartons of beer in item 29 of the Summary were acquired at a more than 50%\n\ndiscount of $177,000. The Thai-Pore invoice merely indicated a set-off between the\n\nplaintiffs and Thai-Pore with respect to a payment of $177,000 to be made on behalf of\n\nThai-Pore. The total cost of the beer to the plaintiffs would still be $310,000, even if\n\n$177,000 of the price was settled by means of a set-off. Thus, in my opinion, even if the\n\nsum of $177,000 reflected in the Thai-Pore invoice was in fact paid to the chief engineer\n\nof the Mekong Express from the proceeds of sale of the beer by the defendant to Yuri, as a\n\nmatter of accounting, this would not have resulted in the \"remittances\" to be\n\ncredited to the plaintiffs in respect of items 15, 16 and 29 of the Summary being reduced\n\nby the sum of $177,000 to $678,100. The defendant received goods worth a total of\n\n$855,100.18\n\n        Be that as it may, if the\n\n\"remittances\" to be credited to the plaintiffs in respect of the beer are to be\n\nreduced by a sum of $177,000, I would have to treat the value of the goods received by the\n\ndefendant as having been reduced to $678,100 from their actual cost of $855,100. If the\n\nvalue of the goods received by the defendant is less than the cost of the goods to the\n\nplaintiffs, it follows that the transaction was effected at a loss. Accordingly, if the\n\nplaintiffs are to be credited with the sum of only $678,100 in respect of items, 15, 16\n\nand 29 of the Summary, the corresponding beer transactions at items 182, 183 and 184 of\n\nthe Summary should now be reflected in the profit and loss account as transactions that\n\nmade a total loss of $177,000.19\n\n        Item 181 of the Summary pertains to a separate\n\nsale of 29,250 cartons of beer for which the plaintiffs claim to have made a profit of\n\n$15,824.80. The defendant did not dispute item 181 of the Summary in his affidavit filed\n\non 20 September 2000. I therefore accept that the plaintiffs made a profit of $15,824.80\n\non this transaction.20\n\n        In the circumstances, I find that the beer\n\ntransactions resulted in a total loss of $161,175.20, calculated from the difference\n\nbetween the profit of $15,824.80 for item 181 of the Summary and the total loss of\n\n$177,000 for items 182 to 184 of the Summary.",
        "Rattan (Items 116 to 159 of the\n\nSummary)": "21\n\n        On 30 May 2000, I ordered the defendant to file\n\nan affidavit that exhaustively listed the specific discrepancies which the defendant\n\nalleged were present in the profit and loss account and to provide full particulars of the\n\ndiscrepancies with supporting documentary evidence, if any. The defendant filed an\n\naffidavit on 20 September 2000 to comply with this order. I shall therefore confine myself\n\nto dealing with the objections raised in this affidavit.22Item 116 - Song Tien I.The defendant's\n\ncomplaint was that the plaintiffs were not entitled to give discounts of US$750.55 for\n\ndampness and US$825.27 for undersized goods in their invoice to the purchasers of the\n\nrattan ostensibly because these goods were \"specially graded and selected by Chew\n\nMoon Tong\". As Chew Moon Tong was not called as a witness at and did not file any\n\naffidavit for the taking of the accounts, there was no evidence to support the defendant's\n\nbare allegations concerning the quality of the goods. Further, there was no evidence to\n\nsuggest that the discounts were not given bona fide in the ordinary course of business.\n\nAccordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made a loss of $6,425.30 as stated at item 116\n\nof the Summary.23Item 117 - Song Tien I.The defendant\n\ncomplained that the plaintiffs imported 34.56 metric tons but sold only 33.94 metric tons\n\nof rattan, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for the difference. The plaintiffs'\n\ncredit note evidencing the importation of the rattan and the plaintiffs' invoice\n\nevidencing the sale of the rattan show that the plaintiffs received and sold only 33.94\n\nmetric tons of rattan. The weight of 34.56 metric tons appears on the Singapore customs\n\ndeclaration form while the weight of 34.65 metric tons appears on the marine premium note.\n\nThe plaintiffs' Mr Fung Ah Wah explained at paragraph 8.1 of his affidavit filed on 11\n\nOctober 2000 that the rattan was still moist when purchased, but had dried up and lost\n\nweight while being transported to Singapore. He added that the weight at which the goods\n\nwere sold in Singapore had to be agreed to by the buyers before they made payment. There\n\nwas no evidence that the plaintiffs split up the cargo for sale to different buyers. There\n\nwas also no evidence to contradict the plaintiffs' explanation. I accept that the cargo\n\nsold was the same cargo that the plaintiffs received, and that the reduced weight was one\n\nagreed to with the buyer in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I accept that\n\nthe plaintiffs made a profit of $1,165.00 as stated at item 117 of the Summary.24Item 118 - Song Tien II.The defendant\n\ncomplained that the plaintiffs imported 26.303 metric tons but sold only 25.760 metric\n\ntons of rattan, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for the difference. The\n\nplaintiffs' credit note evidencing the importation of the rattan and the plaintiffs'\n\ninvoice evidencing the sale of the rattan show that the plaintiffs received and sold only\n\n25.760 metric tons of rattan. The weight of 26.303 metric tons appears on two payment\n\nvouchers, the bill of lading and the Singapore customs declaration form while the weight\n\nof 28.940 metric tons appears on the marine premium note. The plaintiffs' Mr Fung Ah Wah\n\nexplained at paragraph 8.1 of his affidavit filed on 11 October 2000 that the rattan was\n\nstill moist when purchased, but had dried up and lost weight while being transported to\n\nSingapore. He added that the weight at which the goods were sold in Singapore had to be\n\nagreed to by the buyers before they made payment. There was no evidence that the\n\nplaintiffs split up the cargo for sale to different buyers. There was also no evidence to\n\ncontradict the plaintiffs' explanation. I accept that the cargo sold was the same cargo\n\nthat the plaintiffs received, and that the reduced weight was one agreed to with the buyer\n\nin the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made a\n\nprofit of $150.55 as stated at item 118 of the Summary.25Item 119 - Song Tien II.The defendant\n\ndid not dispute item 119 of the Summary in his affidavit filed on 20 September 2000.\n\nAccordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made a loss of $1,268.02 as stated at item 119\n\nof the Summary.26Item 120 - Song Tien I.The defendant\n\ncomplained that the plaintiffs imported 34.055 metric tons but sold only 31.378 metric\n\ntons of rattan, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for the difference. The\n\nplaintiffs' credit note evidencing the importation of the rattan and the plaintiffs'\n\ninvoice evidencing the sale of the rattan show that the plaintiffs received and sold\n\n31.578 metric tons of rattan. Although the bill of lading states the gross weight of the\n\ngoods to be 34.055 metric tons, and this weight is also reflected in a notice of arrival\n\nand a payment voucher, the weight stated in the Singapore customs declaration form is 32\n\nmetric tons while the weight of 31.140 metric tons appears on the marine premium note. The\n\nplaintiffs' Mr Fung Ah Wah explained at paragraph 8.1 of his affidavit filed on 11 October\n\n2000 that the rattan was still moist when purchased, but had dried up and lost weight\n\nwhile being transported to Singapore. He added that the weight at which the goods were\n\nsold in Singapore had to be agreed to by the buyers before they made payment. There was no\n\nevidence that the plaintiffs split up the cargo for sale to different buyers. There was\n\nalso no evidence to contradict the plaintiffs' explanation. I accept that the cargo sold\n\nwas the same cargo that the plaintiffs received, and that the reduced weight was one\n\nagreed to with the buyer in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I accept that\n\nthe plaintiffs made a loss of $572.47 as stated at item 120 of the Summary.27Item 121 - Victory Vigour.The\n\ndefendant's first complaint was that 171 metric tons of rattan were shipped, but the\n\nplaintiffs only sold 169.52 metric tons of rattan, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account\n\nfor the difference. The plaintiffs' credit note evidencing the acquisition of the rattan\n\nand the plaintiffs' invoice evidencing the sale of the rattan show that the plaintiffs\n\nreceived and sold rattan having a total net weight of only 169.520 metric tons. The\n\nplaintiffs were never asked to explain why the title for both the credit note and the\n\ninvoice referred to \"171 M.TONS - VIETNAM RATTAN SHIPMENT PER SS. \"VIGOUR\n\nVICTORY\" FROM HCM TO HONGKONG\". There was no evidence that the net weight of the\n\ncargo received in Hong Kong was 171 metric tons, apart from the defendant's bare\n\nallegation. There was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the cargo for sale to\n\ndifferent buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was shipped.\n\nIf the entire cargo was sold in the ordinary course of business at the price stated in the\n\ninvoice, any apparent discrepancy in weight was irrelevant.28\n\n        The defendant's second complaint was that the\n\ngoods were sold \"F.O.B.\" or free on board, so the plaintiffs were not entitled\n\nto make deductions for freight or crane charges. As the plaintiffs did not provide any\n\nexplanation for these charges even though they were given the opportunity to, I accept\n\nthat the disputed crane charge of US$3,756.65 referred to in credit note TW/8/90 dated 31\n\nMay 1990 and the disputed freight charge of US$10,227.75 referred to in invoice 085/90\n\ndated 31 May 1990 should not be reflected in the accounts. According to invoice 085/90,\n\nthe 169.520 metric tons of rattan were sold at US$106,751.91. According to credit note\n\nTW/8/90, the 169.520 metric tons of rattan were purchased at US$93,556.56. Accordingly,\n\nthe profit made on this transaction should be the difference of US$13,195.35 or\n\nS$24,279.44 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.8400 stated on the invoice.29\n\n        I do not understand the defendant's complaint\n\nthat there was \"no price stated for the sale by the Plaintiffs\". The plaintiffs'\n\ninvoice 085/90 clearly stated that the goods were sold at US$10,227.75. As regards the\n\n\"double entry\" submission, as Khoo J specifically found (at paragraph 27 of his\n\nwritten judgment) that the plaintiffs credited the defendant with the full amount that the\n\ndefendant charged for the goods, and as I had on 30 May 2000 found that the defendant had\n\nbeen credited in full for all \"purchases\" made by him on the plaintiffs' behalf,\n\nthere was no basis for making a corresponding accounting double entry alteration to the\n\n\"purchases\" account.30Item 122 - An Tek.The defendant's first\n\ncomplaint was that 163.56 metric tons of rattan were shipped, but the plaintiffs only sold\n\n145.4355 metric tons of rattan, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for the\n\ndifference. The plaintiffs' credit note evidencing the acquisition of the rattan and the\n\nplaintiffs' invoice evidencing the sale of the rattan show that the plaintiffs received\n\nand sold rattan having a total weight of only 145.4385 metric tons. The plaintiffs were\n\nnever asked to explain why the title for both the credit note and the invoice referred to\n\n\"163.560 M.TONS - VIETNAM RATTAN SHIPT PER SS. \"AN TEK\" FROM HCM. TO\n\nHONGKONG\". There was no evidence that the actual weight of the cargo received in Hong\n\nKong was 163.560 metric tons, apart from the defendant's bare allegation. There was no\n\nevidence that the plaintiffs had split up the cargo for sale to different buyers or that\n\nthe invoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was shipped. If the entire cargo was\n\nsold in the ordinary course of business at the price stated in the invoice, any apparent\n\ndiscrepancy in weight was irrelevant.31\n\n        The defendant's second complaint was that the\n\ngoods were sold \"F.O.B.\" or free on board, so the plaintiffs were not entitled\n\nto make deductions for freight or crane charges. As the plaintiffs did not provide any\n\nexplanation for these charges even though they were given the opportunity to, I accept\n\nthat the disputed crane charge of US$2,480.13 referred to in credit note TW/12/90 dated 4\n\nJuly 1990 and the disputed freight charge of US$12,377.62 referred to in invoice 090/90\n\ndated 4 July 1990 should not be reflected in the accounts. According to invoice 090/90,\n\nthe 145.4385 metric tons of rattan were sold at US$90,890.62. According to credit note\n\nTW/12/90, the 145.4385 metric tons of rattan were purchased at US$76,346.77. Accordingly,\n\nthe profit made on this transaction should be the difference of US$14,543.85 or\n\nS$26,753.41 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.8395 stated on the invoice.32\n\n        As regards the \"double entry\"\n\nsubmission, as Khoo J specifically found (at paragraph 27 of his written judgment) that\n\nthe plaintiffs credited the defendant with the full amount that the defendant charged for\n\nthe goods, and as I had on 30 May 2000 found that the defendant had been credited in full\n\nfor all \"purchases\" made by him on the plaintiffs' behalf, there was no basis\n\nfor making a corresponding accounting double entry alteration to the \"purchases\"\n\naccount.33Item 123 - Louisa.The defendant's first\n\ncomplaint was that 92.722 metric tons of rattan were shipped, but the plaintiffs only sold\n\n78.400 metric tons of rattan, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for the difference.\n\nThe plaintiffs' credit note evidencing the acquisition of the rattan and the plaintiffs'\n\ninvoice evidencing the sale of the rattan show that the plaintiffs received and sold\n\nrattan having a total weight of only 78.400 metric tons. The plaintiffs were never asked\n\nto explain why the title for both the credit note and the invoice referred to \"92.772\n\nM.TONS - VIETNAM RATTAN SHIPT. PER SS. \"LOUISA\" FROM HCM TO HONGKONG\".\n\nThere was no evidence that the actual weight of the cargo received in Hong Kong was 92.772\n\nmetric tons, apart from the defendant's bare allegation. There was no evidence that the\n\nplaintiffs had split up the cargo for sale to different buyers or that the invoice\n\npertained to only part of the cargo that was shipped. If the entire cargo was sold in the\n\nordinary course of business at the price stated in the invoice, any apparent discrepancy\n\nin weight was irrelevant.34\n\n        The defendant's second complaint was that the\n\ngoods were sold \"F.O.B.\" or free on board, so the plaintiffs were not entitled\n\nto make deductions for freight or crane charges. As the plaintiffs did not provide any\n\nexplanation for these charges even though they were given the opportunity to, I accept\n\nthat the disputed crane charge of US$802.16 referred to in credit note TW/15/90 dated 23\n\nJuly 1990 and the disputed freight charge of US$5,547.16 referred to in invoice 101/90\n\ndated 23 July 1990 should not be reflected in the accounts. According to invoice 101/90,\n\nthe 78.400 metric tons of rattan were sold at US$46,581.08. According to credit note\n\nTW/15/90, the 78.400 metric tons of rattan were purchased at US$38,741.08. Accordingly,\n\nthe profit made on this transaction should be the difference of US$7,840 or S$14,112 at\n\nthe exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.8000 stated on the invoice.35\n\n        As regards the \"double entry\"\n\nsubmission, as Khoo J specifically found (at paragraph 27 of his written judgment) that\n\nthe plaintiffs credited the defendant with the full amount that the defendant charged for\n\nthe goods, and as I had on 30 May 2000 found that the defendant had been credited in full\n\nfor all \"purchases\" made by him on the plaintiffs' behalf, there was no basis\n\nfor making a corresponding accounting double entry alteration to the \"purchases\"\n\naccount.36Item 124 - Song Tien I.The defendant\n\ncomplained that the plaintiffs did not explain the \"shortfall\" of 2.14 metric\n\ntons referred to in credit note TW/13/90 dated 15 August 1990 (and, I should add, invoice\n\n099/90 dated 20 July 1990) or the 25% deduction for \"bad quality\". However,\n\nthere was no evidence to suggest that the plaintiffs were responsible for the shortfall or\n\nthat these discounts were not given bona fide in the ordinary course of business. As\n\nregards the defendant's comment that the invoice pre-dated the arrival of the vessel, I\n\nfail to see how anything turns on the date of the invoice. Accordingly, I accept that the\n\nplaintiffs made a loss of $1,617.23 as stated at item 124 of the Summary.37Item 125 - Bunga Bindang.The defendant\n\ncomplained that the plaintiffs did not explain the \"loss in weight\" of 0.914\n\nmetric tons referred to in credit note TW/17/90 and invoice 109/90. However, there was no\n\nevidence to suggest that the plaintiffs were responsible for the loss in weight or that\n\nthe discount was not given bona fide in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I\n\naccept that the plaintiffs made a profit of $5,779.37 as stated in item 125 of the\n\nSummary.38Item 126 - Kah Hang.The defendant's\n\ncomplaint was that the buyers were responsible for freight, so the plaintiffs were not\n\nentitled to make a deduction of US$1,606.64 on account of \"freight paid on our\n\nbehalf\" in invoice 106/90. As the plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for this\n\ndeduction and the other transactions set out in that invoice, even though they were given\n\nthe opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this\n\nitem. According to invoice 106/90, the 36.209 metric tons of rattan were sold at\n\nUS$30,777.65. According to credit note TW/16/90, the 36.209 metric tons of rattan were\n\npurchased at US$27,156.75. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be the\n\ndifference of US$3,620.90 or S$6,408.99 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7700 stated on\n\nthe invoice.39Item 127 - Saigon Gate; Item 128 - Mimosa.The defendant did not dispute items 127 and 128 of the Summary in his affidavit filed on\n\n20 September 2000. Accordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made profits of $1,912.72 and\n\n$2,252.87 as stated at items 127 and 128 respectively of the Summary.40Item 129 - Saigon Gate.The defendant\n\nsubmitted that the plaintiffs should \"account for the loss weight\" in invoice\n\n127/90 of \"27.081 - 25.030\" or 2.051 metric tons. The plaintiffs' credit note\n\nTW/22/90 evidencing the acquisition of the rattan and the plaintiffs' invoice 127/90\n\nevidencing the sale of the rattan show that the plaintiffs received and sold rattan having\n\na total weight of only 25.030 metric tons. The plaintiffs were never asked to explain why\n\nthe title for both the credit note and the invoice referred to \"27.081M.TONS\".\n\nThere was no evidence that the actual weight of the cargo received in Singapore was 27.081\n\nmetric tons, apart from the defendant's bare allegation. The plaintiffs' Mr Fung Ah Wah\n\nexplained at paragraph 8.1 of his affidavit filed on 11 October 2000 that the rattan was\n\nstill moist when purchased, but had dried up and lost weight while being transported to\n\nSingapore. He added that the weight at which the goods were sold in Singapore had to be\n\nagreed to by the buyers before they made payment. There was also no evidence to contradict\n\nthe plaintiffs' explanation. I accept that the weight at which the cargo was sold was one\n\nagreed to with the buyer in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I accept that\n\nthe plaintiffs made a profit of $9,107.69 as stated at item 129 of the Summary.41Item 130 - Ex Stock.The defendant\n\ncomplained about deductions for freight that were made by the plaintiffs. As the\n\nplaintiffs did not provide any explanation for these deductions, even though they were\n\ngiven the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to\n\nthis item. The deductions of US$3,249.50 and US$875 referred to in invoice 131/90\n\n(amounting to a total of US$4,124.50 or S$7,300.36 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7700\n\nstated on the invoice) should be added to the profit computed by the plaintiffs.\n\nAccordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be S$19,422.23 (total of\n\nS$12,121.87 + S$7,300.36).42Item 131 - Saigon Gate.The defendant's\n\ncomplaint was that the plaintiffs were not entitled to give a discount of S$6,118.38 for\n\nbad quality ostensibly because the goods were graded and selected by Goh Chee Kian. As Goh\n\nChee Kian was not called as a witness at and did not file any affidavit for the taking of\n\nthe accounts, there was no evidence to support the defendant's bare allegations concerning\n\nthe quality of the goods. Further, there was no evidence to suggest that the discount was\n\nnot given bona fide in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I accept that the\n\nplaintiffs made a profit of $5,599.05 as stated at item 131 of the Summary.43Item 132 - Mimosa; Item 133 - Saigon Gate;\n\nItem 134 - Saigon Gate.The defendant did not dispute items 132, 133 or 134 of the\n\nSummary in his affidavit filed on 20 September 2000. Accordingly, I accept that the\n\nplaintiffs made profits of $1,233.45, $4,785.07 and $1,757.51 as stated at items 132, 133\n\nand 134 respectively of the Summary.44Item 135 - Nha Trang.The defendant's\n\nfirst complaint was that the plaintiffs \"claim a loss weight of 11.6MT without\n\nexplanation\". However, there was no evidence to suggest that the plaintiffs were\n\nresponsible for the loss in weight or that the discount was not given bona fide in the\n\nordinary course of business. Nor was there any evidence that the plaintiffs had split up\n\nthe cargo for sale to different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the\n\ncargo that was shipped.45\n\n        The defendant made two other complaints. First,\n\nhe alleged that \"freight is to be paid by the buyer and there is no reason to deduct\n\nthis from the price of rattan sold\". Second, he queried a deduction of US$1,200 which\n\nwas made without any explanation whatsoever. As the plaintiffs did not provide any\n\nexplanation for these deductions even though they were given the opportunity to, I reject\n\nthe plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item. According to invoice\n\n148/90, the rattan was sold at US$36,012. According to credit note TW/31/90, the same\n\nrattan was purchased at US$21,836. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should\n\nbe the difference of US$14,176 or S$24,732.87 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7447\n\nstated on the invoice.46Item 136 - Ingenuity; Item 137 - Bunga\n\nBindang.The defendant did not dispute items 136 or 137 of the Summary in his\n\naffidavit filed on 20 September 2000. Accordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made\n\nprofits of $4,704.70 and $5,983.09 as stated at items 136 and 137 respectively of the\n\nSummary.47Item 138 - Louisa.The defendant\n\ncomplained that \"freight was to be paid by the buyer\", and \"there is\n\ntherefore no reason to deduct freight from the price\". As the plaintiffs did not\n\nprovide any explanation for this deduction even though they were given the opportunity to,\n\nI reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item. According to\n\ninvoice 163/91, the rattan was sold at US$21,600. According to credit note TW/37/91, the\n\nsame rattan was purchased at US$16,550. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction\n\nshould be the difference of US$5,050 or S$8,837.50 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7500\n\nstated on the invoice.48Item 139 - Singagold.The defendant's\n\ncomplained about \"loss weight of 5.175 MT\" in relation to credit note TW/38/91\n\nand invoice 165/91, and about \"loss weight of 2.67 MT\" in relation to credit\n\nnote TW/40/01 and invoice 166/91. However, there was no evidence to suggest that the\n\nplaintiffs were responsible for the loss in weight or that the discount was not given bona\n\nfide in the ordinary course of business. Nor was there any evidence that the plaintiffs\n\nhad split up the cargo for sale to different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only\n\npart of the cargo that was shipped.49\n\n        The defendant also complained that freight of\n\nUS$5,546.88 reflected on invoice 165/91 and US$3,060 reflected on invoice 166/91 were to\n\nbe paid by the buyer, and not the plaintiffs. As the plaintiffs did not provide any\n\nexplanation for these deductions even though they were given the opportunity to, I reject\n\nthe plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item. The deductions of\n\nUS$5,546.88 referred to in invoice 165/91 (or S$9,888.42 at the exchange rate of US$1 =\n\nS$1.7827 stated on the invoice) and US$3,060 referred to in invoice 166/91 (or S$5,455.06\n\nat the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7827 stated on the invoice) should be added to the\n\nprofit computed by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should\n\nbe S$31,063.42 (total of S$15,719.94 + S$9,888.42 + S$5,455.06).50Item 140 - Hai Win.The defendant's\n\nfirst complaint was that there was a claim for loss of weight of 11 metric tons in credit\n\nnote TW 41/91 and invoice 171/91. However, there was no evidence to suggest that the\n\nplaintiffs were responsible for the loss in weight or that the discount was not given bona\n\nfide in the ordinary course of business. Nor was there any evidence that the plaintiffs\n\nhad split up the cargo for sale to different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only\n\npart of the cargo that was shipped.51\n\n        The defendant's second complaint was that\n\nfreight of US$6,300 reflected on invoice 170/91 and freight of US$3,074.40 reflected on\n\ninvoice 171/91 were to be paid by the buyer and not the plaintiffs. As the plaintiffs did\n\nnot provide any explanation for these deductions even though they were given the\n\nopportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item.\n\nThe deductions of US$6,300 referred to in invoice 170/91 (or S$11,155.41 at the exchange\n\nrate of US$1 = S$1.7707 stated on the invoice) and US$3,074.40 referred to in invoice\n\n171/91 (or S$5,443.84 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7707 stated on the invoice)\n\nshould be added to the profit computed by the plaintiffs.52\n\n        The defendant's third complaint was that the\n\nplaintiffs made an unexplained deduction of US$1,200 in invoice 170/91. As the plaintiffs\n\ndid not provide any explanation for this deduction even though they were given the\n\nopportunity to, the deduction of US$1,200 referred to in invoice 170/91 (or S$2,124.84 at\n\nthe exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7707 stated on the invoice) should be added to the profit\n\ncomputed by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be\n\nS$35,681.28 (total of $16,957.19 + $11,155.41 + $5,443.84 + $2,124.84).53Item 141 - Bunga Bindang.The defendant\n\ncomplained that the plaintiffs were not entitled to give a discount of $12,380.98 on\n\naccount of \"claim on quality\" in credit note TW/45/91 and invoice 174/91,\n\nostensibly because Goh Chee Kian was stationed in Vietnam to ensure quality. As Goh Chee\n\nKian was not called as a witness at and did not file any affidavit for the taking of the\n\naccounts, there was no evidence to support the defendant's bare allegations concerning the\n\nquality of the goods. Further, there was no evidence to suggest that the discount was not\n\ngiven bona fide in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I accept that the\n\nplaintiffs made a profit of $15,281.66 as stated at item 141 of the Summary.54Item 142 - Louisa.The defendant's first\n\ncomplaint was that 96.607 metric tons of rattan were shipped but only 96.083 metric tons\n\nof rattan were sold. He wanted the plaintiffs to account for the difference of 0.524\n\nmetric tons. There was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the cargo for sale to\n\ndifferent buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was shipped.\n\nIf the entire cargo was sold in the ordinary course of business at the price stated in the\n\ninvoice, any apparent discrepancy in weight was irrelevant.55\n\n        The defendant's second complaint was that the\n\ntrucking and unloading charges of US$646.12 and freight charges of US$6,569.27 reflected\n\non invoice 167/91 were unjustified because they were payable by the buyer and not the\n\nplaintiffs. As the plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for these deductions even\n\nthough they were given the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit\n\nin relation to this item. The deductions of US$646.12 (or S$1,150.09 at the exchange rate\n\nof US$1 = S$1.7800 stated on the invoice) and US$6,569.27 (or S$11,693.30 at the exchange\n\nrate of US$1 = S$1.7800 stated on the invoice) should be added to the profit computed by\n\nthe plaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be S$26,842.59\n\n(total of S$13,999.20 + S$1,150.09 + S$11,693.30).56Item 143 - Song Thu.The defendant's\n\nfirst complaint states: \"For Credit Note No. TW/46/91 we were to have purchased 50MT\n\n(see page 444) and the Bill of Lading (page 451) however the tonnage stated is only 48 MT.\n\nThere is a shortfall of 2 tons which the Plaintiffs have to account for the shortfall and\n\nits price and profit.\" This allegation was not only garbled but also misconceived as\n\nthe corresponding invoice 173/91 clearly showed that the plaintiffs sold 50 metric tons of\n\nrattan at US$24,500. There was therefore no \"shortfall\" that the plaintiffs\n\nfailed to account for.57\n\n        The defendant's second complaint states:\n\n\"Again for Credit Note No. TW/46/9-A (page 445) we were to have purchased 35.50 MT\n\n(see Bill of Lading on page 453) but only 31.79 MT was acknowledged by the Plaintiffs. The\n\nPlaintiffs must therefore account for the shortfall of 2.29MT and its price and\n\nprofit.\" The plaintiffs' credit note TW/46/9-A evidencing the acquisition of the\n\nrattan and the plaintiffs' invoice 173/91-A evidencing the sale of the rattan show that\n\nthe plaintiffs received and sold rattan having a total weight of only 31.79 metric tons.\n\nThere was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up that particular cargo for sale to\n\ndifferent buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was shipped.\n\nIf the entire cargo was sold in the ordinary course of business at the price stated in the\n\ninvoice, any apparent discrepancy in weight was irrelevant.58\n\n        The defendant's third complaint was that the\n\nplaintiffs had wrongfully deducted freight charges of US$3,000 from the sum payable by the\n\nbuyer under invoice 172/91 and US$3,000 from the sum payable by the buyer under invoice\n\n173/91, when freight was payable by the buyers. As the plaintiffs did not provide any\n\nexplanation for these deductions even though they were given the opportunity to, I reject\n\nthe plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item. The deductions of US$3,000\n\n(or S$5,340 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7800 stated on invoice 172/91) and US$3,000\n\n(or S$5,340 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7800 stated on invoice 173/91) should be\n\nadded to the profit computed by the plaintiffs.59\n\n        The defendant's fourth complaint was that the\n\nplaintiffs had wrongfully deducted a sum of US$1,589.50 for \"expenses\" from the\n\nsum payable by the buyer under invoice 173/91-A. As the plaintiffs did not provide any\n\nexplanation for this deduction even though they were given the opportunity to, the\n\ndeduction of US$1,589.50 (or S$2,781.62 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7500 stated on\n\ninvoice 173/91-A) should be added to the profit computed by the plaintiffs. Accordingly,\n\nthe profit made on this transaction should be S$31,779.76 (total of S$18,318.14 + S$5,340\n\n+ S$5,340 + S$2,781.62).60Item 144 - Silver Dragon.The\n\ndefendant's first complaint pertained to a \"loss of weight of 0.69 MT\" reflected\n\nin both credit note TW/47/91 and the corresponding invoice 175/91. There was no evidence\n\nthat the plaintiffs had split up the cargo for sale to different buyers or that the\n\ninvoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was shipped. If the entire cargo was sold\n\nin the ordinary course of business at the price stated in the invoice, any apparent\n\ndiscrepancy in weight was irrelevant.61\n\n        The defendant's second complaint was that the\n\nplaintiffs had wrongfully deducted a sum of US$2,645.20 for freight from the sum payable\n\nby the buyer under invoice 175/91. The defendant claimed that freight was payable by the\n\nbuyer as the cargo was sold on an \"f.o.b. basis\" with freight collect. As the\n\nplaintiffs did not provide any explanation for this deduction even though they were given\n\nthe opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this\n\nitem. The deduction of US$2,645.20 (or S$4,682 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7700\n\nstated on the invoice) should be added to the profit computed by the plaintiffs.\n\nAccordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be S$9,185.61 (total of S$4,503.61\n\n+ S$4,682).62Item 145 - Bunga Bindang.The defendant\n\ncomplained that the weight of the cargo stated in the bill of lading was 28.77 metric tons\n\nwhereas the weight of the cargo according to the corresponding credit notes and invoices\n\nwas only 27.3 metric tons, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for the difference. The\n\nplaintiffs' Mr Fung Ah Wah explained at paragraph 8.1 of his affidavit filed on 11 October\n\n2000 that the rattan was still moist when purchased, but had dried up and lost weight\n\nwhile being transported to Singapore. He added that the weight at which the goods were\n\nsold in Singapore had to be agreed to by the buyers before they made payment. There was no\n\nevidence that the plaintiffs split up the cargo for sale to different buyers. There was\n\nalso no evidence to contradict the plaintiffs' explanation. I accept that the cargo sold\n\nwas the same cargo that the plaintiffs received, and that the reduced weight was one\n\nagreed to with the buyer in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I accept that\n\nthe plaintiffs made a profit of $1,969.03 as stated at item 145 of the Summary.63Item 146 - Louisa.The defendant's first\n\ncomplaint pertained to a \"shortfall of 17.936 MT\" reflected in both credit note\n\nTW/51/91 and the corresponding invoice 179/91. There was no evidence that the plaintiffs\n\nhad split up the cargo for sale to different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only\n\npart of the cargo that was shipped. If the entire cargo was sold in the ordinary course of\n\nbusiness at the price stated in the invoice, any apparent discrepancy in weight was\n\nirrelevant.64\n\n        The defendant's second complaint was that the\n\nplaintiffs had wrongfully deducted a sum of US$4,561.44 for freight from the sum payable\n\nby the purchaser under invoice 179/91. The defendant claimed that freight was payable by\n\nthe purchaser. As the plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for this deduction even\n\nthough they were given the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit\n\nin relation to this item. The deduction of US$4,561.44 (or S$8,072.84 at the exchange rate\n\nof US$1 = S$1.7698 stated on the invoice) should be added to the profit computed by the\n\nplaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be S$12,578.24 (total\n\nof S$4,505.40 + S$8,072.84).65Item 147 - Thien An.The defendant\n\ncomplained about \"loss in weight of 7.04 MT\" and a \"consequent reduction in\n\nprice of US$859.14\" in invoice 184/91. The defendant also complained about the\n\ndeduction of US$8,217.30 for freight as, according to him, freight was payable by the\n\npurchaser. There was no evidence to suggest that the plaintiffs were responsible for the\n\nloss in weight or that the weight discount was not given bona fide in the ordinary course\n\nof business. Nor was there any evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the cargo for\n\nsale to different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was\n\nshipped. However, as the plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for the US$859.14\n\ndeduction or the deduction on account of freight, even though they were given the\n\nopportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item.\n\nThe deductions of US$859.14 and US$8,217.30 (or S$1,524.11 and S$14,577.49 respectively at\n\nthe exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7740 stated on the invoice) should be added to the profit\n\ncomputed by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be\n\nS$44,087.62 (total of S$27,986.02 + S$1,524.11 + S$14,577.49).66Item 148 - Hoi Long.The defendant's\n\nfirst complaint was that the plaintiffs sold only 41.27 metric tons of rattan although 50\n\nmetric tons were shipped, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for a shortfall of 8.73\n\nmetric tons. However, there was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the cargo for\n\nsale to different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was\n\nshipped. If the entire cargo was sold in the ordinary course of business at the price\n\nstated in the invoice, any apparent discrepancy in weight was irrelevant.67\n\n        The defendant's second complaint was that the\n\nplaintiffs had wrongfully deducted a sum of US$690 for freight from the sum payable by the\n\npurchaser under invoice 185/91. The defendant claimed that freight was payable by the\n\npurchaser. As the plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for this deduction even\n\nthough they were given the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit\n\nin relation to this item. The deduction of US$690 (or S$1,224.06 at the exchange rate of\n\nUS$1 = S$1.7740 stated on the invoice) should be added to the profit computed by the\n\nplaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be S$1,863.65 (total\n\nof S$639.59 + S$1,224.06).68Item 149 - Bunga Bindang.The defendant\n\ndid not dispute item 149 of the Summary in his affidavit filed on 20 September 2000.\n\nAccordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made a profit of $5,402.99 as stated at item 149\n\nof the Summary.69Item 150 - Stella I.The defendant\n\ncomplained that the plaintiffs had wrongfully deducted a sum of US$753.45 on account of a\n\ncross-claim by the purchaser from the sum payable by the purchaser under invoice 183/91.\n\nThe defendant also contended that the plaintiffs were not entitled to deduct a sum of\n\nUS$3,033.03 on account of freight, because freight was payable by the buyer. As the\n\nplaintiffs did not provide any explanation for these deductions even though they were\n\ngiven the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to\n\nthis item. The deductions of US$753.45 and US$3,033.03 (or S$1,341.14 and S$5,398.79\n\nrespectively at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7800 stated on the invoice) should be\n\nadded to the profit computed by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit made on this\n\ntransaction should be S$19,438.98 (total of S$12,699.05 + S$1,341.14 + S$5,398.79).70Item 151 - Thien An II.The defendant's\n\nfirst complaint was that the plaintiffs sold only 40.307 metric tons of rattan although\n\n45.168 metric tons were shipped, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for a shortfall\n\nof 4.861 metric tons. However, there was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the\n\ncargo for sale to different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the cargo\n\nthat was shipped. If the entire cargo was sold in the ordinary course of business at the\n\nprice stated in the invoice, any apparent discrepancy in weight was irrelevant.71\n\n        The defendant's second complaint was that the\n\nplaintiffs had wrongfully deducted a sum of US$2,935.92 for freight from the sum payable\n\nby the purchaser under invoice 190/91. The defendant claimed that freight was payable by\n\nthe purchaser. As the plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for this deduction even\n\nthough they were given the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit\n\nin relation to this item. The deduction of US$2,935.92 (or S$5,208.32 at the exchange rate\n\nof US$1 = S$1.7740 stated on the invoice) should be added to the profit computed by the\n\nplaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be S$6,663.82 (total\n\nof S$1,455.50 + S$5,208.32).72Item 152 - Hai Win.The defendant's\n\nfirst complaint was that the plaintiffs sold only 77.084 metric tons of rattan although\n\n92.397 metric tons were shipped, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for a shortfall\n\nof 15.313 metric tons. However, there was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the\n\ncargo for sale to different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the cargo\n\nthat was shipped. If the entire cargo was sold in the ordinary course of business at the\n\nprice stated in the invoice, any apparent discrepancy in weight was irrelevant.73\n\n        The defendant made two other complaints. First,\n\nhe complained that the plaintiffs had wrongfully deducted a sum of US$10,385.35 on account\n\nof a cross-claim by the purchaser from the sum payable by the purchaser under invoice\n\n193/91. Second, the defendant contended that the plaintiffs were not entitled to deduct a\n\nsum of US$6,283 on account of freight, because freight was payable by the buyer. As the\n\nplaintiffs did not provide any explanation for these deductions even though they were\n\ngiven the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to\n\nthis item. The deductions of US$10,385.35 and US$6,283 (or S$18,434.00 and S$11,152.32\n\nrespectively at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7750 stated on the invoice) should be\n\nadded to the profit computed by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit made on this\n\ntransaction should be S$36,801.04 (total of S$7,214.72 + S$18,434.00 + S$11,152.32).74Item 153 - Izvesta; Item 154 - Bunga\n\nBindang.The defendant did not dispute items 153 and 154 of the Summary in his\n\naffidavit filed on 20 September 2000. Accordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made\n\nprofits of $2,871.24 and $4,084.53 as stated at items 153 and 154 respectively of the\n\nSummary.75Item 155 - Quy Nhon 2.The defendant's\n\nfirst complaint was that the rattan sold by the plaintiffs under invoice 199/91 was less\n\nthan what was shipped, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for the difference.\n\nHowever, there was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the cargo for sale to\n\ndifferent buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was shipped.\n\nIf the entire cargo was sold in the ordinary course of business at the price stated in the\n\ninvoice, any apparent discrepancy in weight was irrelevant.76\n\n        The defendant also made the following\n\ncomplaints. First, the plaintiffs were not entitled to deduct freight charges of\n\nUS$3,923.05 under invoice 198/91 and US$4,374.40 under invoice 199/91, because freight was\n\npayable by the buyer. Second, the plaintiffs made an unjustified deduction of US$1,080 in\n\ninvoice 199/91. Third, the plaintiffs had, in invoice 199/91, deducted freight charges for\n\nshipping cargo from Hong Kong to China amounting to US$356.23. As the plaintiffs did not\n\nprovide any explanation for these deductions even though they were given the opportunity\n\nto, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item. The\n\ndeductions of US$3,923.05, US$4,374.40, US$1,080 and US$356.23 (or S$6,920.26, S$7,716.44,\n\nS$1,905.12 and S$628.39 respectively at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7640 stated on\n\ninvoice 198/91 and calculated from the S$ to US$ ratio of the bottomline in invoice\n\n199/91) should be added to the profit computed by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit\n\nmade on this transaction should be S$16,458.04 (S$6,920.26 + S$7,716.44 + S$1,905.12 +\n\nS$628.39 - S$712.17).77\n\n        The defendant also referred to invoice 199/91\n\nand alleged that \"the Plaintiffs have not accounted for the sale in China\".\n\nHowever, the contents of invoice 199/91 do not go so far as to suggest that there was a\n\nseparate transaction in China distinct from the sale referred to invoice 199/91.78Item 156 - Nhatrang 6.The defendant\n\nraised various objections to the two main documents in support of the plaintiffs'\n\ncomputation for item 156, namely credit note TW/65/91 (which is wrongly labelled as an\n\ninvoice) and invoice 201/91. As the plaintiffs did not address any of these objections\n\neven though they were given the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of\n\nloss in relation to this item. In so far as invoice 201/91 is concerned, I do not think\n\nthe plaintiffs are entitled to make any deduction on account of freight amounting to\n\nUS$8,132.34, since the plaintiffs have not disputed the defendant's allegation that the\n\nfreight charges should be payable by the purchaser. Nor should there be any deduction on\n\naccount of \"claim on loss in weight\" amounting to US$38,781.40. No loss in\n\nweight is disclosed in the invoice and no explanation has been given for this claim. As\n\nregards credit note TW/65/91, I agree that no deduction should be made from the cost of\n\nthe goods on account of \"charges claimed by Alan\". No explanation has been given\n\nas to what who Alan is or what these charges pertain to. According to invoice 201/91, the\n\ngoods were sold at US$100,160.57, disregarding the deductions for freight and \"claim\n\non loss in weight\". According to credit note TW/65/91, the total cost of the goods\n\nwas US$74,060.10, disregarding the \"charges claimed by Alan\". The marine premium\n\nnote exhibited shows that the plaintiffs paid insurance premium of $320 for this shipment.\n\nI therefore find that the profit made on this transaction is US$26,100.47 or S$42,804.77\n\n(using the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.6400 stated on the invoice) less the sum of S$320,\n\ni.e. S$42,484.77 (S$42,804.77 - S$320).79Item 157 - Song Chang 505.The\n\ndefendant's complaint is that there are no supporting documents at all to justify the\n\nplaintiff's assertion that this transaction resulted in a loss of $10,696.05. As the\n\nplaintiffs did not provide any evidence that the transaction did in fact result in a loss,\n\nand the defendant did not provide any evidence to show that the transaction resulted in a\n\nprofit, I find that this is a transaction which did not make any profit or loss.\n\nAccordingly, the transaction should be reflected as having made a profit/loss of $0.80Item 158 - Song Chang 505; Item 159 -\n\nLaclong Quan.The defendant did not dispute items 158 and 159 of the Summary in his\n\naffidavit filed on 20 September 2000. Accordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made\n\nprofits of $397.66 and $2,579.40 as stated at items 158 and 159 respectively of the\n\nSummary.81\n\n        In summary, I find that the rattan transactions\n\nresulted in a total profit of $506,609.82.",
        "Honda Motor Bikes (Items 160 to\n\n162)": "82\n\n        According to the Summary, the transactions\n\npertaining to Honda motor bikes at items 160, 161 and 162 made profits of $6,216.87,\n\n$10,632.45 and $5,296.25 respectively. In the light of paragraphs 8 and 11 of my grounds\n\nof decision dated 30 May 2000, where I directed that the remittances credited to the\n\nplaintiffs should be reduced by the sums of $22,423.88 and $7,855.26 respectively, the\n\nprofit made on these transactions should correspondingly be reduced by these amounts.83\n\n        The defendant disputed 3 items of expenses in\n\nrelation to the Honda motor bike transactions, namely, commission payments amounting to\n\n$3,206.25 (in respect of item 160), $958 (in respect of item 161) and $2,232 (in respect\n\nof item 162). The defendant objected on the ground that these expenses were included\n\n\"without stating the purpose of these payment and without any evidence of any such\n\npayments\". I agree that the alleged commission payments of $958 and $2,232 should be\n\nexcluded from the computation as there are no payment vouchers or other supporting\n\ndocuments to explain why and to whom these payments were made. However, the payment of\n\n$3,206.25 was supported by a payment voucher exhibited at page 63 of Fung Ah Wah's\n\naffidavit filed on 22 October 1997 and also at page 74 of Fung Ah Wah's affidavit filed on\n\n23 September 1999.84\n\n        In the circumstances, I find that the Honda\n\nmotor bike transactions resulted in a total loss of $4,943.57, calculated as follows:$6,216.87 + $10,632.45 + $958 +\n\n    $5,296.25 + $2,232 - $22,423.88 - $7,855.26",
        "Containers (Items 163 to 171 of\n\nthe Summary)": "85\n\n        At paragraph 44 of Fung's second affidavit and\n\nparagraph 85 of Fung's third affidavit, Mr Fung states:As regards ... Containers, there\n\n    are usually no supporting documents as the sales in Singapore were usually by cash. The\n\n    exceptions are the transaction of 13 containers on 28/8/90, 6 containers on 22/10/90 and\n\n    12 containers on 15/8/91, where the buyer paid us by draft. ...86\n\n        The 3 transactions referred to in this passage\n\nare items 169, 170 and 171 of the Summary. The documents evidencing the sale at item 169\n\nare found at pages 73 and 74 of Fung's second affidavit, and duplicated at pages 678 and\n\n679 of Fung's third affidavit. The documents evidencing the sale at item 170 are found at\n\npages 75 and 76 of Fung's second affidavit, and duplicated at pages 680 and 681 of Fung's\n\nthird affidavit. The documents evidencing the sale at item 171 are found at pages 77 and\n\n78 of Fung's second affidavit, and duplicated at pages 682 and 683 of Fung's third\n\naffidavit. Apart from these documents, the only other document relied on to support the\n\nplaintiffs' computations of profits at items 163 to 171 are some handwritten notes found\n\nat pages 582 to 584 of Fung's first affidavit, and duplicated at pages 592 to 594 of\n\nFung's third affidavit.87\n\n        The expenses incurred by the plaintiffs in\n\nacquiring the total of 81 containers listed at items 163, 164, 165, 167, 168, 169, 170 and\n\n171 of the Summary as reflected in the handwritten notes found at pages 582 to 584 of\n\nFung's first affidavit, and duplicated at pages 592 to 594 of Fung's third affidavit, are\n\nmatched by the \"purchases\" credited to the defendant at items 45, 52, 55, 61,\n\n63, 65, 69 and 89 respectively of the Summary. The expenses incurred by the plaintiffs in\n\nacquiring the 18 containers listed at item 166 of the Summary as reflected in the\n\nhandwritten note found at page 582 of Fung's first affidavit, and duplicated at page 592\n\nof Fung's third affidavit, are matched by the \"purchases\" credited to the\n\ndefendant at items 57 and 58 of the Summary. There is nothing to contradict Mr Fung's\n\nevidence that there were no supporting documents evidencing the sale of the containers\n\nlisted at items 163 to 168 of the Summary, so the sales figures reflected in the\n\nhandwritten notes found at pages 582 and 583 of Fung's first affidavit, and duplicated at\n\npages 592 and 593 of Fung's third affidavit, are the best evidence of the price at which\n\nthose containers were sold. I have verified, from my examination of the available\n\ndocuments, that the profits set out at items 163 to 171 of the Summary have been correctly\n\ncalculated. Accordingly, I find that the profits earned from the container transactions at\n\nitems 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170 and 171 of the Summary are $15,146.60,\n\n$16,288.50, $4,640, $13,782.35, $4,785, $4,645, $6,051, $3,225 and $3,000 respectively.\n\nThe total of these profits is $71,563.45.88\n\n        The defendant alleged that the number of\n\n\"containers that are actually brought in with the cargoes\" exceeded the 99\n\ncontainers disclosed by the plaintiffs, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for them.\n\nHowever, apart from the defendant's bare allegations which were disputed by the\n\nplaintiffs, there was no evidence whatsoever that the containers used to transport the\n\ngoods acquired by the defendant for the plaintiffs were in fact sold separately from the\n\ngoods transported in the containers. All the containers acquired by the defendant for sale\n\nby the plaintiffs were accounted for in the \"purchases\" account (at items 45,\n\n52, 55, 57, 58, 61, 63, 65, 69 and 89 of the Summary) and the profit and loss account (at\n\nitems 163 to 171 of the Summary). In the circumstances, I find that the container\n\ntransactions made a total profit of $71,563.45.",
        "Miscellaneous Commodities (Items\n\n172 to 175 of the Summary)": "89Item 172 - Coffee.At paragraph 46 of\n\nFung's second affidavit and paragraph 87 of Fung's third affidavit, Mr Fung stated that\n\nthe supporting documents for the coffee transaction were collectively marked\n\n\"FAW-12\". FAW-12 comprise pages 79 to 100 of Fung's second affidavit, duplicated\n\nat pages 684 to 705 respectively of Fung's third affidavit. My conclusions on the coffee\n\ntransaction are summarised in the following table:SalesInvoice 069/90 dated 17\n\n    April 1990(Fung's second affidavit page\n\n    81)with corresponding request for letter of credit\n\n    negotiation(Fung's second affidavit page 82)US$82,000(S$152,807.00)(using exchange rate ofUS$1 = S$1.8635 used for invoice\n\n    070/90)Invoice 070/90 dated 14\n\n    April 1990(Fung's second affidavit page\n\n    83)with corresponding bank advice for S$49,569.10(Fung's second affidavit page 84)US$26,600(S$49,569.10)Total SalesS$202,376.10ExpensesFreight(Fung's second affidavit page 86)S$6,759.00Payment to shipmaster(According to Fung's second affidavit pages 90 and 91, the\n\n    amount paid was S$1,395.00.

The bank collection notice also provides for payment of\n\n    \"cable/postage/stamp duty\" of S$5.00. However, the plaintiffs' summary of the\n\n    coffee transaction exhibited at page 585 of Fung's first affidavit reflects two payments\n\n    of S$154,324.00 and S$50,152.77 for the coffee, and a further payment of S$683.26 for\n\n    \"open L/C charges\", making a total of S$205,160.03.

In so deciding, I have rejected the plaintiffs' contention\n\nthat a further sum of S$1,316.00 should be deducted on account of my decision in relation\n\nto item 8 of the Summary. Although the alleged \"refund pertaining to overpriced\n\ncoffee\" was reflected in the plaintiffs' summary of the coffee transaction at page\n\n585 of Fung's first affidavit, it is clear that this figure was not taken into account\n\nwhen the plaintiffs computed their loss for this transaction at S$14,173.94. Also, having\n\nregard to the manner in which I have computed the plaintiffs' loss for the coffee\n\ntransaction, there is no basis for making a further deduction of S$1,316. I have similarly\n\nrejected the defendant's contention that the profit should be increased by S$1,316. It was\n\nthe plaintiffs' case that the refund of S$1,316 was collected by the defendant from the\n\nsupplier of the coffee. As the defendant denied collecting the sum of S$1,316, it followed\n\nthat:(1)    the\n\n    plaintiffs did not receive the sum of S$1,316;(2)    there was\n\n    no corresponding reduction in the purchase price; and(3)    there could\n\n    be no corresponding increase in the profit from the coffee transaction.91Item 173 - Pepper.At paragraph 47 of\n\nFung's second affidavit and paragraph 88 of Fung's third affidavit, Mr Fung stated that\n\nthe supporting documents for the pepper transaction were collectively marked\n\n\"FAW-13\".

As the discrepancy should be resolved in the defendant's\n\n    favour, the higher quantum should be used.)US$162,114.77(S$279,647.98)Total SalesS$279,647.98ExpensesPurchase price(The bank debit advice dated 10 July 1991 at Fung's second\n\n    affidavit page 122 shows that the plaintiffs were debited with US$156,000 or S$274,950.00\n\n    (using the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.762500 as stated on bank debit advice). However,\n\n    the plaintiffs' summary of the cashew nut transaction exhibited at page 596 of Fung's\n\n    first affidavit states that the price paid was US$152,318.40 or S$262,759.24 at an\n\n    exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7250. As the discrepancy should be resolved in the defendant's\n\n    favour, the lower quantum should be used.)US$152,318.40(S$262,759.24)Bank charges for letter\n\n    of credit (as per bank debit advice dated 10 July 1991)(Fung's second affidavit page 122)S$810.37Freight(Fung's second affidavit page 121)S$8,333.20Payment to Intraco\n\n    Limited(Fung's second affidavit page 123)S$1,351.25Expenses paid by Intan\n\n    Holdings Pte Ltd(Fung's second affidavit\n\n    pages 124 and 125)S$2,086.33Trucking charges(Fung's second affidavit pages 126 and 127)S$2,007.00Import permit,\n\n    insurance, amendment charges and handling charges(These items are not proved as there are no supporting documents when there\n\n    should be.)S$0.00Total ExpensesS$277,347.39Profit(Total\n\n    Sales - Total Expenses)S$2,300.5996\n\n        I therefore find that the cashew nut\n\ntransaction made a profit of S$2,300.59.97\n\n        In the circumstances, I find that the four\n\nmiscellaneous commodities transactions together yielded a profit of S$6,936.34.",
        "Rubber (Items 176 to 180 of the\n\nSummary)": "98Item 176 - Saigon Gate.The defendant's\n\nonly complaint was that there was \"no evidence of import tax\". If by this the\n\ndefendant is referring to the payment of $1,388.59 to Intraco Limited for cess duty, then\n\nthis objection is unfounded, as there is no evidence that cess duty is not payable simply\n\nbecause the goods are re-exported to a Malaysian party. Indeed, Mr Fung states at\n\nparagraph 11.6 of his affidavit filed on 11 October 2000 that \"Intraco Cess had to be\n\npaid for goods brought into Singapore even if it is then re-exported\". However, there\n\nwas an entry for $40 marked \"Imp\" in the summary for the Saigon Gate rubber\n\ntransaction found at page 597 of Fung's first affidavit. There were no supporting\n\ndocuments for this entry. If the defendant was referring to this entry when he complained\n\nthat there was \"no evidence of import tax\", then I agree that this entry should\n\nbe disregarded in computing the profit for this transaction. I therefore find that the\n\nloss on item 176 of the Summary should only be S$4,144 instead of S$4,184.99Item 177 - Mekong Express.The\n\ndefendant's complaint was that while the plaintiffs had produced documents relating to the\n\nexpenses for the Mekong Express rubber transaction, there was \"no evidence of the\n\nprice paid nor the price for which the rubber was sold\". In so far as the cost of\n\nthis shipment of rubber was concerned, there was ample evidence adduced at the trial to\n\nshow that the rubber was acquired through the defendant at a price of US$279,250 (or\n\nS$494,272.50 at an exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.77). The defendant was in fact credited\n\nwith the sum of S$494,272.50 in the \"purchases\" account at item 67 of the\n\nSummary. However, the plaintiffs did not produce any documentary evidence pertaining to\n\nthe sale of the Mekong Express rubber. Item 177 of the Summary discloses no less than 5\n\nseparate sales of the Mekong Express rubber. One would have expected the plaintiffs to\n\nissue invoices in respect of these transactions. However, none of these invoices were\n\ndisclosed to the court. The plaintiffs have also failed to provide any confirmation under\n\noath or affirmation of the sale price for each separate transaction in which the\n\nplaintiffs sold the Mekong Express rubber. The plaintiffs did no more than exhibit a\n\nsummary of the Mekong Express transactions at page 598 of Fung's first affidavit and page\n\n608 of Fung's third affidavit. In the circumstances, the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy\n\nme that they did in fact make a loss of $10,250.53 on the Mekong Express transactions. The\n\ndefendant has also failed to satisfy me that the plaintiffs made a profit on the Mekong\n\nExpress transactions. I therefore direct that the transactions dealt with under item 177\n\nof the Summary should be reflected as transactions that did not make a profit or loss.100Item 178 - Bunga Bindang.The\n\ndefendant's only complaint was that there was \"no evidence of import tax\". If by\n\nthis the defendant is referring to the payment of $442.36 to Intraco Limited for cess\n\nduty, then this objection is unfounded, as there is no evidence that cess duty is not\n\npayable simply because the goods are re-exported to a Malaysian party. Indeed, Mr Fung\n\nstates at paragraph 11.6 of his affidavit filed on 11 October 2000 that \"Intraco Cess\n\nhad to be paid for goods brought into Singapore even if it is then re-exported\".\n\nHowever, there was an entry for $40 marked \"Import Permit\" in the summary for\n\nthe Saigon Gate rubber transaction found at page 599 of Fung's first affidavit. There were\n\nno supporting documents for this entry. If the defendant was referring to this entry when\n\nhe complained that there was \"no evidence of import tax\", then I agree that this\n\nentry should be disregarded in computing the profit for this transaction. I therefore find\n\nthat the loss on item 176 of the Summary should only be S$20,986.41 instead of\n\nS$21,026.41.101Item 179 - La Femme; Item 180 - Kinyru.The defendant did not dispute items 179 and 180 of the Summary in his affidavit filed on\n\n20 September 2000. Accordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made profits of $13,660.56\n\nand $24,341.64 as stated at items 179 and 180 respectively of the Summary.102\n\n        In the circumstances, I find that the five\n\nrubber transactions together yielded a profit of S$12,871.79.",
        "Expenses (Items 185 to 195)": "103\n\n        At paragraph 28 of the defendant's affidavit\n\nfiled on 20 September 2000, the defendant admitted to all the expenses except items 192,\n\n193 and 194 of the Summary. The undisputed expenses at items 185 to 191 and 195 of the\n\nSummary amount to a total of $12,431.42.104Item 192 - Haw Par claim judgment sum; Item\n\n193 - Haw Par claim judgment costs.The evidence pertaining to the Haw Par Trading Pte\n\nLtd (\"Haw Par\") claim and judgment costs is set out at paragraph 55 of Fung's\n\nsecond affidavit, paragraph 96 of Fung's third affidavit and exhibit FAW-26 in both\n\naffidavits. The defendant's complained that these two items of the Summary were expenses\n\nincurred in the course of a business transaction falling within the scope of the parties'\n\njoint venture, and the plaintiffs had failed to account for the profits earned from that\n\ntransaction. The defendant submitted that these expenses should be deducted from the\n\nprofits earned from this transaction, and that the balance should be accounted for by the\n\nplaintiffs in the profit and loss account. I agree with this submission. The plaintiffs\n\ncannot, in the same breath, claim to be entitled to recover the expenses incurred for a\n\nparticular business transaction without also accounting for any profit made from that\n\ntransaction.105\n\n        The transaction concerned pertained to a sale\n\nof timber. The plaintiffs bought 8,000 cubic metres of timber from Vietnamese sellers at\n\nUS$97 per cubic metre (see Fung's second affidavit pages 198 to 199 and 206) and sold to\n\nHaw Par:(1)    2,500 cubic\n\n    metres of the timber, plus/minus 10% at buyer's option, at US$103 per cubic metre (see\n\n    Fung's second affidavit pages 200 to 202 and 208); and(2)    5,500 cubic\n\n    metres of the timber, plus/minus 10% at buyer's option, at US$105 per cubic metre (see\n\n    Fung's second affidavit pages 203 to 205 and 208).The plaintiffs' bank debited the\n\nplaintiffs' account with the sum of S$1,397,188 (US$776,000 converted to S$ at an exchange\n\nrate of US$1 = S$1.800500) for the purchase price and $3,964.26 for bank charges (see\n\nFung's second affidavit page 210). Haw Par in turn arranged for an irrevocable letter of\n\ncredit for US$835,000 to be opened in the plaintiffs' favour for the transaction (see\n\nFung's second affidavit pages 211 to 215).=106\n\n        The Vietnamese sellers unfortunately failed to\n\nmeet the shipping deadlines. In the meantime, Haw Par had arranged with Mitsubishi\n\nCorporation for a vessel to proceed to Ho Chi Minh port in Vietnam to load the first\n\nshipment of timber. When the cargo was not delivered on time, the charterer diverted the\n\nvessel to pick up other cargo first. Mitsubishi Corporation made a claim against Haw Par,\n\nwho in turn made a claim against the plaintiffs. Haw Par sued the plaintiffs in the High\n\nCourt in Suit No. 860 of 1991 for breach of contract, and by consent, judgment was entered\n\nfor the sum which Haw Par had to pay Mitsubishi Corporation and costs. The total principal\n\nand accrued interest which the plaintiffs paid Haw Par amounted to US$40,578.52 (which the\n\nplaintiffs converted to S$70,160.26 at an exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7290) while the\n\ncosts paid amounted to S$700.107\n\n        There was no evidence whether the timber sale\n\ntransaction was ultimately proceeded with or aborted. Mr Fung's affidavits were\n\nconspicuously silent on this matter. Although the defendant expressly suggested in his\n\naffidavit filed on 20 September 2000 that the plaintiffs should only be entitled to claim\n\nthe expenses referred to in items 192 and 193 of the Summary if the plaintiffs also\n\naccounted for the profits from the timber transaction, Mr Fung failed to address this\n\npoint in his affidavit in reply filed on 11 October 2000. There is some basis for\n\nbelieving that the timber sale transaction was subsequently proceeded with - in\n\nparticular, the letter from the Vietnamese seller at Fund's second affidavit page 221\n\ncontains an assurance that the seller would \"DELIVER ... THE FULL QUANTITY\n\nCONTRACTED\".108\n\n        If the timber transaction was subsequently\n\nproceeded with without any hitches, the plaintiffs would have made a profit of\n\nS$31,404.98, calculated as follows:Sales2,500 cubic metres at\n\n    US$103 per cubic metreUS$257,5005,500 cubic metres at\n\n    US$105 per cubic metreUS$577,500Total SalesUS$835,000(S$1,503,417.50)ExpensesPurchase price(8,000 cubic metres at US$97 per cubic metre)(US$776,000 converted to S$1,397,188 at an\n\n    exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.800500 in bank debit advice)US$776,000(S$1,397,188.00)Bank charges for letter\n\n    of credit (as per bank debit advice)S$3,964.26Haw Par claim judgment\n\n    sumS$70,160.26Haw Par claim judgment\n\n    costs(Fung's second affidavit page 123)S$700.00Total ExpensesS$1,472,012.52Profit(Total\n\n    Sales - Total Expenses)S$31,404.98109\n\n        As the plaintiffs have failed to provide\n\nevidence whether the timber transaction was proceeded with or aborted and have failed to\n\nrender a full account in respect of the timber transaction, the plaintiffs should not be\n\nallowed to claim the expenses set out at items 192 and 193 of the Summary without first\n\nsatisfying the court that no sales income was earned from the timber transaction from\n\nwhich the whole or part of the expenses claimed at items 192 and 193 of the Summary could\n\nbe paid.110Item 194 - Legal fees.The evidence\n\npertaining to the claim in respect of legal fees is set out at paragraph 57 of Fung's\n\nsecond affidavit, paragraph 98 of Fung's third affidavit and exhibit FAW-28 in both\n\naffidavits. The legal fees were incurred in respect of the plaintiffs' claim against\n\nThai-Pore Enterprises Pte Ltd (\"Thai-Pore\" pertaining to the recovery of loans\n\nand other forms of financial assistance extended by the plaintiffs to Thai-Pore. The\n\ndefendant submitted that these legal expenses were not attributable to the joint venture\n\nbetween the parties, and so should not be reflected in the profit and loss account. I\n\nagree fully with the defendant's submission, which is borne out by a careful perusal of\n\nthe documents exhibited in support of this claim. Accordingly, item 194 of the Summary is\n\ndisallowed.",
        "Other Outstanding Issues": "111Item 20 - Transfer overpayment.There\n\nwas a dispute between the parties as regards how my decision on item 20 of the Summary\n\nwould affect the profit and loss account. The short answer is that it does not affect the\n\nprofit and loss account at all. At paragraph 18 of my grounds of decision dated 30 May\n\n2000, I explained that even if what the plaintiffs alleged was true, there was no\n\noverpayment to the defendant, because there was no evidence that the goods shipped were of\n\na smaller quantity than the goods paid for by the plaintiffs. On the plaintiffs' own case,\n\nwhat had happened was that the cost of freight exceeded the price differential between the\n\nvalue of the goods and the amount that the plaintiffs paid for the goods, thus resulting\n\nin an overall loss. I went on further to decide that the plaintiffs failed to prove that\n\nthere was an overpayment because:(1)    there was\n\n    no documentary evidence to support the plaintiffs' allegation that they had paid\n\n    $19,999.15 for freight; and(2)    excluding\n\n    freight, the plaintiffs expended a total of only $405,990.12 (inclusive of the $10,000\n\n    cash handed to the defendant) but received goods valued at $417,467.01.In the circumstances, I fail to\n\nsee how my decision on item 20 of the Summary can have any effect on the profit and loss\n\naccount.112Extraordinary expense in respect of rattan\n\nalleged to have been paid for by the defendant and lost.There was also a dispute\n\nbetween the parties as regards how my decision on the rattan alleged to have been paid for\n\nby the defendant and loss would affect the profit and loss account. The sum of US$26,000\n\nhad initially been expended by the defendant to acquire rattan for resale under the joint\n\nventure. If the goods had not been \"confiscated\", the US$26,000 payment would\n\nhave been reflected under the \"purchases\" account, the proceeds from and\n\nexpenses incurred for the sale of the rattan would have been reflected in a trading\n\naccount, and any profit or loss from the trading account would have been transferred to\n\nthe profit and loss account. The \"confiscation\" of the rattan would result in a\n\ntotal write-off of proceeds from this transaction. There should therefore be a\n\ncorresponding entry in the profit and loss account to reflect the total loss of US$26,000\n\nincurred as a result of this transaction. At the present exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7255,\n\nthis amounts to approximately S$44,863.",
        "Conclusion": "113\n\n        Having regard to the decision in Registrar's\n\nAppeal No. 600217 of 2000, and disregarding items 192 and 193 of the Summary, the profit\n\nand loss account may be summarised as follows:ItemsAmount (S$)1 Rattan (Items 116 to 159 of the Summary)506,609.822 Honda Motor Bikes (Items 160 to 162 of the\n\n      Summary)(4,943.54)3 Containers (Items 163 to 171 of the Summary)71,563.454 Miscellaneous Commodities (Items 172 to 175 of\n\n      the Summary)6,936.345 Rubber (Items 176 to 180 of the Summary)12,871.796 Heineken Beer (Items 181 to 184 of the Summary)(161,175.20)7 Expenses (Items 185 to 191 and 194 to 195 of\n\n      the Summary)(12,431.42)8 Extraordinary Expense (Rattan)(44,863.00)Profit374,568.24Defendant's half share\n\n    of profit187,284.12114\n\n        At paragraph 30 of my grounds of decision dated\n\n30 May 2000, I held that the defendant was entitled to be reimbursed a total of US$39,470\n\nin respect of extraordinary expenses. At the present exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7255,\n\nthis amounts to approximately S$68,105.49.115\n\n        Having regard to the decision in Registrar's\n\nAppeal No. 600217 of 2000, and disregarding items 192 and 193 of the Summary, the state of\n\nthe accounts between the parties may be summarised as follows:(1)Remittances made to the\n\n        defendant$ 2,958,160.35(2)Less:Purchases made by the defendant($ 2,911,350.19)(3)Less:Reimbursement of\n\n        the defendant's extraordinary expenses($ 68,105.49)(4)Add:The plaintiffs'\n\n        claim in respect of the sanitary ware transaction$ 62,926.80(5)Add:Housing loan$ 40,000.00(6)Less:The defendant's half share of the\n\n        profit($ 187,284.12)($ 105,652.65)116\n\n        There is presently a balance due from the\n\nplaintiffs to the defendant amounting to $105,652.65. The defendant is therefore entitled\n\nto an order that the plaintiffs pay him the sum of $105,652.65.117\n\n        The plaintiffs have filed an appeal against the\n\ndecision in Registrar's Appeal No. 600217 of 2000. The outcome of that appeal will\n\nsignificantly affect the state of the final account between the parties. I therefore give\n\nthe parties liberty to apply to vary my order in the event that the decision in\n\nRegistrar's Appeal No. 600217 of 2000 is varied. The parties should also have liberty to\n\napply to vary my order within the next 21 days if they detect arithmetic errors in any of\n\nthe numerous calculations that I have made to arrive at this final account.118\n\n        In summary, I make the following orders:(1)    The\n\n    plaintiffs shall pay the defendant the sum of $105,652.65 with interest at 6% per annum\n\n    from the date of the counterclaim to the date of this order;(2)    There be\n\n    liberty to apply to vary this order in the event that the order in Registrar's Appeal No.\n\n    600217 of 2000 is varied;(3)    The\n\n    determination of the issue whether the plaintiffs are entitled to claim the expenses set\n\n    out at items 192 and 193 of the Summary shall be deferred until after the plaintiffs have\n\n    filed an affidavit that renders a true and complete account (with all relevant supporting\n\n    documents) of the timber transaction described at paragraph 55 and exhibit FAW-26 of Fung\n\n    Ah Wah's affidavit of evidence in chief filed on 7 November 1997;(4)    In the\n\n    event that the plaintiffs fail to file such an affidavit within 21 days of this order, the\n\n    plaintiffs' claims under items 192 and 193 of the Summary shall be disallowed;(5)    The parties\n\n    shall have liberty to apply to vary this order within 14 days from the date the plaintiffs\n\n    file such an affidavit; and(6)    The parties\n\n    shall have liberty to apply to vary this order within 21 days if any party detects\n\n    arithmetic errors in any of the calculations made to arrive at this final account.Sgd:PHANG HSIAO CHUNGASSISTANT REGISTRARCopyright © Government of Singapore."
