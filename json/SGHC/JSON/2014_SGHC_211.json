        "Introduction": "1       The\nappeal before me raised an interesting question of law: does a party\nin an action in the District Court require leave to appeal to the\nHigh Court if the subject-matter of the appeal is limited solely\nto the issue of costs, and the amount of costs in question does\nnot exceed $50,000? 2       This\nquestion arose because an appeal from a decision of the District Court\nlies as of right (that is, leave is not required) under s 21(1)(a) of the Supreme Court of Judicature\nAct (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) if the amount in dispute or\nthe value of the subject-matter at the hearing before that District\nCourt exceeds $50,000. 3       As\nfar as I am aware, there is no clear authority on this point. I therefore\nprovide the written grounds for my decision. 4       The\nappeal before me was against costs orders awarded to the Respondent\nin two interlocutory applications arising from District Court Suit\nNo 1366 of 2012 (“the DC Suit”): (a)     the\nfirst was the Respondent’s application to strike out the appellant’s\nStatement of Claim (“the striking out application”); and (b)     the\nsecond was the Appellant’s application to amend its Statement of\nClaim (“the amendment application”). Both applications were heard in the State Courts at first\ninstance by a Deputy Registrar in Chambers. 5       The\nRespondent succeeded in both applications, and costs were awarded\nto him at $10,000 (excluding disbursements) for the striking out application,\nand $1,000 (excluding disbursements) for the amendment application. 6       The\nAppellant chose not to appeal the substantive aspects of the Deputy\nRegistrar’s decision in relation to both applications. This was notwithstanding\nthat the effect of the Deputy Registrar’s decision was that the\nAppellant’s claim against the Respondent was struck out. Instead,\nthe Appellant only appealed the costs orders made. 7       The\nappeal was heard by a District Judge in Chambers on 30 July 2014.\nOn the same day, the District Judge allowed the Appellant’s appeal and\nreduced the costs awarded against the Appellant. The District Judge ordered\nthat costs be fixed at $3,500 (including disbursements) for the striking\nout application, and $1,000 (including disbursements) for the amendment\napplication. 8       The\nAppellant was dissatisfied with the decision of the District Judge and\nsought to further reduce the costs awarded against it by appealing\nthe matter to the High Court Judge in Chambers, and accordingly\nfiled a Notice of Appeal to the High Court on 11 August 2014. 9       The\nAppellant asked that the costs of the striking out application be reduced\nfrom $3,500 to $1,000 (including disbursements) and that the costs of\nthe amendment application be reduced from $1,000 to $200 (including disbursements). 10     I\nheard the appeal on 25 September 2014. As a preliminary issue, the Respondent\nsubmitted that there was a defect in the Appellant’s Notice of Appeal\nin that the Appellant was required to, but had not, obtained leave\nto appeal to the High Court. On that basis, the appeal should be\ndismissed without a hearing on the substantive merits, that is,\nthe appeal against the District Judge’s decision (see [7] above).\nThe Appellant submitted that it did not require leave to appeal\nto the High Court. 11     After\nhearing submissions by the parties, I was satisfied that the Appellant\nrequired leave to appeal. Leave not having been obtained, I held that\nthe appeal was not properly before me. I therefore dismissed the\nappeal with costs to the Respondent.",
        "My decision": "12     Before\nI address the preliminary issue proper, I set out the relevant statutory\nprovisions concerning the regime for appeals from a District Judge\nin Chambers to a Judge of the High Court in Chambers.",
        "The regime for appeals from\nthe District Judge in Chambers": "13     As\na starting point, civil appeals from the District Court to the High Court\nare dealt with under s 47 of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007\nRev Ed) (“SCA”). Section 47 reads as follows: General\nprovision relating to civil appeals 47.Subject to the provisions\nof the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322) relating to civil\nappeals from the State Courts to the High Court, Rules of Court\nshall regulate and prescribe the procedure on appeals from a District Court\nexercising civil jurisdiction to the High Court. 14     Section\n47 of the SCA is subject to the SCJA. The SCJA in turn sets out\nspecific rules concerning appeals from the District Court to the\nHigh Court which can be taken up as of right, appeals which require\nleave, and matters for which there is no right of appeal at all: Appeals\nfrom District and Magistrates’ Courts 21.—(1) Subject to the provisions\nof this Act and any other written law, an appeal shall lie to the\nHigh Court from a decision of a District Court or Magistrate’s Court — (a)    in any case wherethe amount in dispute, or the value of the subject-matter,\nat the hearing before that District Court or Magistrate’s Court\n(excluding interest and costs)exceeds $50,000or such\nother amount as may be specified by an order made under subsection (3);\nor (b)    with\nthe leave of that District Court or Magistrate’s Court or the High\nCourt, in any other case. … (2B)  No\nappeal shall be brought to the High Court in any case where a District\nCourt or Magistrate’s Court makes an order specified in the Third Schedule,\nexcept in such circumstances as may be specified in that Schedule. … [emphasis added in bold] 15     The\nprocedure for bringing an appeal from the District Judge in Chambers\nto the High Court in Chambers is in turn set out in O 55C rr 1 and\n2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed), which read as follows: Appeals\nfrom decisions of District Judges or Magistrates in Chambers (O. 55C,\nr. 1) 1.—(1) Subject to section 21(2B)\nof the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322), an appeal shall\nlie to a Judge of the High Court in Chambers from — (a)    any judgment, order or\ndecision of a District Judge in Chambers (not given or made in his\ncapacity as the Registrar), including a judgment given, or an order\nor a decision made, on appeal from the Registrar; and (b)    any\njudgment, order or decision of a Magistrate in Chambers (not given\nor made in his capacity as the Registrar). … Leave\nto appeal (O. 55C, r. 2) 2.—(1) A party applying for\nleave under section 21(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act\n(Cap. 322) to appeal against any judgment, order or decision of\na District Judge or Magistrate in Chambers (not given or made in his\ncapacity as the Registrar), must file his application — (a)    to the District Judge\nor Magistrate in Chambers within 7 days from the date of the judgment,\norder or decision; and (b)    in\nthe event that leave is refused by the District Judge or Magistrate,\nto the High Court within 7 days from the date of the refusal. (2)    A\nparty who has obtained leave to appeal under this Rule shall file\nand serve the notice of appeal within 14 days from the date on which\nsuch leave was given.",
        "Whether the appeal was properly\nbefore the court": "16     On\nthe basis of the foregoing, the question of whether leave was required\nfor the Appellant to appeal to the High Court depended on whether\nthe case fell within s 21(1)(a)\n(leave not required) or s 21(1)(b) (leave\nrequired) of the SCJA. The main point of contention between the parties\nwas whether “the amount in dispute, or the value of the subject-matter”\nin this case crossed the monetary threshold of $50,000, upon which an\nappeal to the High Court would lie as of right. 17     Before\nI set out the parties’ respective arguments on this, I preface this by\nhighlighting that their submissions were not entirely focused on\nthe key aspect in the appeal, that is, that the subject-matter of\nthe appeal relatedonlyto the issue\nof costs and how that would affect the determination of “the amount\nin dispute, or the value of the subject-matter” for the purposes of\ns 21(1). The Appellant’s arguments 18     The\nAppellant submitted that “the amount in dispute, or the value of the\nsubject-matter” was the value of the Appellant’s substantive claim, which\nwas $167,620.15, being the damages claimed by the Appellant against the\nRespondent for the negligence of subcontractors who had allegedly caused\na fire to break out during construction works (the “Appellant’s substantive\nclaim”). This exceeded the monetary threshold of $50,000 under s\n21(1)(a) and leave was therefore\nnot required. 19     In\nsupport of its submission, the appellant sought to rely on the High Court\ndecision inOng Wah Chuan v Seow Hwa Chuan[2011]\n3 SLR 1150, where the portions of the parliamentary debates concerning\nthe 2010 amendments to s 21 of the SCJA (seeSingapore\nParliamentary Debates, Official Report(18 October 2010)\nvol 87 at col 1371) were cited by the court (at [41]): It should also be observed that the new\ns 34(2)(a) SCJA has similarly had\nthe phrase “at the trial” deleted and the phrase “at the hearing”\nsubstituted therefor. Sections 21(1)(a)\nand 34(2)(a) are now uniform in\nso far as the determination of the “amount in dispute” is concerned.\nAt the second reading of the relevant amendment bill (seeSingapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(18\nOctober 2010) vol 87 at col 1371), the Senior Minister of State\nfor Law explained that: Currently, a party does not require leave\nof court to file an appeal to the High Court or the Court of Appeal,\nas the case may be, if the ‘amount in dispute or value of the subject-matter’\nexceeds $50,000 for appeals to the High Court; or $250,000 for appeals\nto the Court of Appeal. Clauses 4(a)\nand 9(c) amend section 21 and section\n34(2)(a) to clarify that the computation\nof this monetary threshold does not include interest or costs ordered\nby the court. The amendment also puts it beyond doubt that the respective\nmonetary thresholds of the High Court and Court of Appeal is computed\nby reference to the original amount claimed in the lower court and\nnot the judgment sum awarded by the court, or the amount in dispute\non appeal. This is consistent with recent Court of Appeal decisions. 20     The\nAppellant submitted that the above passage supported his position\nfor two reasons. First, the parliamentary debates made clear that the\nmonetary threshold is calculated by reference to the “original amount claimed\nin the lower court”. Second, the parliamentary debates confirm what\nis stated in s 21(1)(a) of the SCJA,\nthat is, interest or costs ordered by the court are not included\nin the calculation. The Respondent’s arguments 21     The\nRespondent’s submission, on the other hand, was that “the amount\nin dispute, or the value of the subject-matter” in this case was\nthe quantum of the costs orders (that is, $11,000 in total). The\ntotal costs ordered was lower than the monetary threshold of $50,000\nunder s 21(1)(a), and leave to appeal\nwas therefore required pursuant to s 21(1)(b). 22     The\nRespondent relied principally on the Court of Appeal decision inFong Khim Lingv\nTan Teck Ann[2014] 2 SLR 659 (“Fong\nKhim Ling”). The court held (at [21] and [26]) that: 21    …\nThe operative phrase in both ss 21(1)(a)\nand 34(2)(a) is now “the amount\nin dispute, or the value of the subject-matter, at the hearing before [the\nlower court]”, and Parliament intended that this amount should be\nthe original amount claimed in the lower court, in accordance with\ntheTan Chiang Brother’s Marbleline\nof Court of Appeal authorities. … 26    …\n[T]he plain words “amount in dispute, or value of the subject-matter”\nare nevertheless perfectly capable of meaning the sum in issue between\nthe parties,ie, the sum of the\nclaim which is before the lower court. … 23     The\nRespondent argued that the lower court in this instance referred to\nthe District Judge, and since the only issue before the District\nJudge concerned the quantum of costs awarded for the striking out\napplication and the amendment application, the amount awarded in\nthe costs orders ($11,000) should be “the amount in dispute, or\nthe value of the subject-matter” for the purposes of s 21(1)(a). 24     According\nto the Respondent, the determination of “the amount in dispute,\nor the value of the subject-matter” ought not to refer back to the proceedings\nbefore the Deputy Registrar. Implicit in this submission is the acknowledgment\nthat if the determination of the amount in dispute or the value\nof the subject-matter ought to refer to the proceedings before the Deputy\nRegistrar, the amount would be $167,620.15 based on the Appellant’s\nsubstantive claim. 25     The\nRespondent also submitted that because the substantive order made\nby the Deputy Registrar in relation to the striking out application\nwas not appealed to the District Judge, the Appellant’s substantive\nclaim no longer exists. Therefore, it could not be said that the\n“amount in dispute” concerned the Appellant’s substantive claim. 26     Despite\nthe parties’ attempts at relying on what they perceived as the relevant\nauthorities, I was not sure that the authorities were directly relevant\nto the present issue. During the hearing, I asked parties if they knew\nof any authority which supported their respective positions on how “the\namount in dispute, or the value of the subject-matter” should be computed\nwhen the subject-matter of the appeal relatedonlyto\ncosts order(s).Both parties submitted\nthat there were none, and admitted that the authorities they cited\nwere not entirely on point. How should the monetary threshold\nfor an appeal solely on costs be calculated for the purposes of\ns 21(1)(a) of the SCJA? 27     It\nwas not in dispute that the Appellant did not succeed in both applications\nheard before the Deputy Registrar. The Appellant chose not to appeal\nagainst the substantive outcomes of the applications, and only appealed\nthe costs orders made. The only live issue thereafter related to\nthe costs orders made by the Deputy Registrar, and subsequently,\nthe District Judge. 28     In\nmy view, this was significant, and brought to the fore the crux\nof this appeal. As a matter of principle, it would not be correct\nto conflate the claim made in the DC Suit with the costs orders\nthat resulted from the applications made in the DC Suit. It is trite\nlaw that costs orders are not awarded to vindicate the rights of\nparties as part of the underlying claim in an action, but are instead\na form of compensation for the successful party in litigation for\nhis legal expenses incurred (seeThen Khek\nKoon and another v Arjun PermanandSamtani\nand another and other suits[2014] 1 SLR 245 (at [155]–[158]);\nandNg Eng Ghee and Others v MamataKapildev Dave and Others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd,\nintervener)[2009] 4 SLR(R) 155 (at [6]–[7])). 29     Therefore,\nwhere the subject-matter in dispute concerns only costs orders made\nin the lower court, the value of the main claim should, in my view,\nbe irrelevant. In the present case, since the only matter that was\non appeal from the District Court concerned the costs orders made,\nit follows as a matter of logic that “the amount in dispute, or\nthe value of the subject-matter” must be the amount of costs ordered\nandnotthe amount claimed in the\nDC Suit. 30     I\nfound indirect support for this view from the parallel provision\nin the SCJA concerning appeals from the High Court to the Court\nof Appeal at s 34(2)(b) which provides\nthat: (2)    Except\nwith the leave of a Judge, no appeal shall be brought to the Court\nof Appeal in any of the following cases: … (b)    where\ntheonlyissue in the appeal relates\nto costs or fees for hearing dates; … [emphasis added in bold] 31     Section\n34(2)(b) suggests that costs orders\narising from a claim are conceptually distinct from the claim, and\nmore importantly, can exist independently of the claim. This is\nespecially so where theonlyissue\non appeal relates to costs, as was the situation in the present\ncase. 32     Understood\nin this light, the Appellant’s submissions were, accordingly, mistaken.\nThe costs orders were conceptually independent of the Appellant’s\nsubstantive claim in the DC Suit, and effectively took a life of\ntheir own when that was theonlyissue\nin dispute. Since the only issue in dispute between the parties\nrelated to the costs orders that were appealed, it would be incongruous\nto take the amount claimed in the DC Suit as being “the amount in\ndispute, or the value of the subject-matter in [the lower court]”.\nInstead, in considering whether the monetary threshold requirement\nin s 21(1)(a) of the SCJA had been\nsatisfied, the amount of costs ordered is the relevant amount as\nthat is what the parties are truly disputing. 33     The\nAppellant’s other argument that relies on the phrase “excluding interest\nand costs” contained in s 21(1)(a)\n(see [20] above), was also misconceived. Although not expressly\nmentioned in the parliamentary debates, the inclusion of the phrase\n“excluding interest and costs” was most likely a result of the recommendation\nof theReport of the Law Reform Committee on\nthe Rationalisation of Legislation Relating to Leave to Appeal(October\n2008), prepared by the Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy\nof Law chaired by Judith Prakash J. 34     The\nbasis for the recommendation was to give legislative effect to the High\nCourt decision ofAbdul Rahman bin Sharif v\nAbdul Salim bin Syed[1999] 3 SLR(R) 138, where Tay Yong\nKwang JC (as he then was) held (at [24]–[25]) that: 24    In\nmy opinion, the “amount in dispute or the value of the subject matter”\nin s 21 does not encompass the non-contractual interest and costs elements\nof a claim for a contractual amount or for damages. Interest would usually\nbe awarded if a plaintiff is successful in his action and costs\nwould, in the great majority of cases, follow the event. Nevertheless,\nthey remain discretionary and, if awarded, may fluctuate in amount\naccording to the period for which interest is given and depending\non the discretion of the trial judge or the Registrar taxing the\ncosts where the amount of costs is concerned. If interest and costs\nare to be included in computing the “amount in dispute or the value\nof the subject matter” in s 21, then it follows that they ought\nto be taken into consideration also when construing jurisdictional provisions\nsuch as s 20(1) Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 1999 Ed) … Doing so would entail a plaintiff having\nto calculate the amount of interest and estimate the costs at the\ntime of commencement of action to see whether the sum of the claim,\ninterest and costs exceeds the monetary jurisdictional limit. With\ninterest and costs increasing as the days pass, an action which\nwas within the district court or the magistrates’ court limit when\ncommenced could well breach the respective limits by the time the\naction is ready for trial, perhaps even during the course of the\ntrial! Similarly, a matter which was within the District Court’s\njurisdiction when heard by the Registrar there could be beyond that\njurisdiction by the time an appeal goes before the district judge\nin chambers. The action would then have to be transferred to the\nHigh Court for hearing. It does not seem sensible to me to inject\nsuch uncertainties into something so fundamental as the court’s\njurisdiction. 25    The\nreasoning for reading s 21 Supreme Court of Judicature Act as excluding\ninterest and costs is even stronger in the case of costs. If costs\nare ordered to be taxed at the end of a trial, which is frequently\nthe case, a party appealing to the High Court will not know whether\nhe can appeal as of right or only with leave of court in a case\nwhere the amount of damages awarded was less than $50,000. The answer\nwill only be known after taxation and, if there is an application\nfor review, only after review by the Registrar and the district\njudge in chambers. This unhappy and confusing state of affairs does not\neven arise if we exclude costs from consideration when deciding\nwhether a matter is appealable as of right under s 21 Supreme Court\nof Judicature Act. 35     Therefore,\nit was clear that the exclusion of interest and costs from the calculation\nof “the amount in dispute, or value of the subject-matter” was meant\nto ensure that uncertainty and confusion would not be introduced\nin determining questions of jurisdiction. That, however, does not\npreclude “the amount in dispute, or the value of the subject-matter”\nfrom being calculated based on the amount of costs ordered where\nthat is the only issue in dispute. Where “the amount in dispute,\nor the value of the subject-matter” is calculated based on the amount\nof costs ordered, the exclusion of interest and costs simply means\nthat any subsequent costs awarded by the court as a result of the\nparties’ dispute on the earlier costs orders will be excluded from\nthe calculation of “the amount in dispute, or the value of the subject-matter”\nfor the purposes of s 21(1)(a). 36     For\ncompleteness, I have two further observations in relation to the submissions\nmade by the Respondent. 37     As\nregards the Respondent’s first submission (see above at [23]–[24]), his\napproach in interpreting the phrase “at the hearing before [the\nlower court]” as meaning the hearing before the District Judge (and\nnot the hearing before the Deputy Registrar) was incorrect. 38     As\nexplained by Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) inHerbs\nand Spices Trading Post Pte Ltd v Deo Silver (Pte) Ltd[1990]\n2 SLR(R) 685 at [11], the Deputy Registrar derives jurisdiction\nand power to hear matters through the District Judge, and therefore\nthe District Judge when hearing “appeals” from the Deputy Registrar\nis merely exercising a form of confirmatory jurisdiction. Therefore,\nthe hearings before the Deputy Registrar and the District Judge\nare effectively one hearing (see alsoFong Khim\nLingat [29]). To be clear, this is immaterial to the\npresent case for the reasons stated earlier. The “amount in dispute,\nor the value of the subject-matter” in the present case should be\ncalculated solely on the amount of the costs orders in dispute and\nthe amount of the Appellant's substantive claim in the DC Suit has\nno bearing on that. 39     The\nRespondent’s second submission, that the Appellant’s substantive\nclaim in the DC Suit no longer exists once the striking out application\nwas not appealed, and therefore “the amount in dispute” could not\nbe the sum claimed, was not incorrect, but irrelevant. Based on\nmy earlier reasoning, whether the DC Suit was fully extinguished,\nor still exists (for example, if only part of the Statement of Claim\nwas struck out) is, in my view, immaterial. What was material to\nmy decision was that thesubject-matter of\nthe appealrelated only to the costs orders made. Should leave have been sought? 40     Since\nthe amount of costs ordered by the Deputy Registrar in the total amount\nof $11,000 was the sole matter in issue between the parties in the District\nCourt, that was, in my view, “the amount in dispute, or the value\nof the subject-matter” for the purposes of ascertaining whether\nthe monetary threshold requirement under s 21(1)(a)\nof the SCJA was satisfied. This requirement not being met, leave\nto appeal was therefore required pursuant to s 21(1)(b). 41     The\nAppellant should therefore have obtained leave from the District Judge\nwithin seven days from the date of the order made on 30 July 2014 (see\nO 55C r 2 cited at [15] above). It did not do so. Neither did the Appellant\nseek leave from the High Court. Therefore, I found that the Notice\nto Appeal filed on 11 August 2014 was defective, and consequently, the\nappeal was not properly before the court.",
        "Conclusion": "42     For\nthe foregoing reasons, I dismissed the appeal with costs to the Respondent\nat $1,000 (including disbursements)."
