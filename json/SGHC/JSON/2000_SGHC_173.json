        "THE SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE": "5 Mr Low Cheong Yeow for the Prosecution\n\ninformed me that the Accused had no previous conviction or antecedent. He submitted that a\n\nsevere sentence was warranted here as the victim under the control and at the mercy of the\n\nAccused, her employer. She had no one to turn to in Singapore. It was also not an isolated\n\ncase of sexual assault in a moment of weakness. It was a series of offences with the first\n\nincident happening on the victim’s very first day of work and ending with the rape\n\nalmost four months later.6 Relying onSim Gek Yong v PP[1995] 1 SLR 537andFu Foo Tong v PP[1995] 1 SLR 448, Mr Low submitted that the\n\nAccused’s plea of guilt did not automatically entitle him to a discount in sentence.\n\nHe also referred to the Parliamentary Debates of 20 April 1998, during which the new\n\nSection 73 of the Penal Code was enacted, to emphasize the seriousness with which\n\nParliament viewed cases of abuse of domestic maids.7 Mr Parambir Singh informed me that the\n\nAccused is married with two young children aged six and seven. He used to work as a Senior\n\nTechnician but had to resign from his job because of the present proceedings. His wife is\n\ngainfully employed. He helped to support his father and his mother who are 61 and 58 years\n\nold respectively. They are not working and are in poor health.8 The Accused was remorseful and wished to\n\napologise to the victim for the pain and suffering caused to her. He cooperated fully with\n\nthe police and had in fact admitted the offences when confronted by them the day after the\n\nrape. He has also pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity.9 Mr Parambir Singh also informed me that\n\nthe Accused was released on bail on 29 March 2000 after having been in remand for some six\n\nweeks. He submitted that while any imprisonment sentence could not be backdated in the\n\ncircumstances, the period spent in custody ought to be taken into account when determining\n\nthe length of sentence.",
        "THE DECISION OF THE COURT": "10 In 1998, Parliament enacted the Penal\n\nCode (Amendment) Act which brought about the present section 73 of the Penal Code. This\n\nsection, which came into operation on 15 May 1998, provides for enhanced penalties for\n\noffences against domestic maids such as Ms Sri Utami Tumijan here. It states:\"73. (1) Subsection (2) shall apply\n\n  where an employer of a domestic maid or a member of the employer’s household is\n\n  convicted of –(a) an offence of causing hurt or grievous\n\n    hurt to any domestic maid employed by the employer punishable under section 323, 324 or\n\n    325;(b) an offence of wrongfully confining any\n\n    domestic maid employed by the employer punishable under section 342, 343 or 344;(c) an offence of assaulting or using\n\n    criminal force to any domestic maid employed by the employer punishable under section 354;(d) an offence of doing any act that is\n\n    intended to insult the modesty of any domestic maid employed by the employer punishable\n\n    under section 509; or(e) an offence of attempting to commit,\n\n    abetting the commission of, or being a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit, an\n\n    offence described in paragraphs (a) to (d).(2) Where an employer of a domestic maid\n\n  or a member of the employer’s household is convicted of an offence described in\n\n  subsection (1) (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e), the court may sentence the employer of the\n\n  domestic maid or the member of his household, as the case may be, to one and a half times\n\n  the amount of punishment to which he would otherwise have been liable for that\n\n  offence.\"11 In moving the Second Reading of the\n\nPenal Code (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on 20 April 1998, the Honourable Minister for\n\nHome Affairs, Mr Wong Kan Seng, said:\"Maid abuse runs counter to\n\n  Singapore’s aspiration to become a gracious and civil society. Abuse of foreign\n\n  domestic maids can also damage our international reputation and bilateral relations.…Sir, this Bill is intended to send a\n\n  strong signal to those employers who have a tendency to abuse their domestic maids that we\n\n  take a very stern view against such abuse.…The reason why we have brought up this\n\n  subject of maids to this House and ask Parliament to enhance the punishment is that maids\n\n  are very different from our relatives and other categories of workers. These maids come\n\n  from far away countries. I would say most of them are illiterate and live in rural areas.\n\n  Some have practically no idea what Singapore really is like until they step on to our\n\n  shores and, therefore, adjustment can become quite difficult for them. More so, when they\n\n  have to be separated from their families and work in a totally strange environment under\n\n  very strange conditions. I think we have to pay some special attention to how they adjust\n\n  and cope with the new environment. If in the process of working here, the employers were\n\n  to take advantage of them or abuse them, then, in order to become a gracious and civil\n\n  society, we have got to find ways of protecting them. Hence, this particular amendment to\n\n  enhance the punishment for those who abuse their maids.\"12 Section 73 of the Penal Code is\n\nrelevant to the 2ndCharge only, enhancing the maximum imprisonment term to\n\nthree years from two years in the ordinary case of outrage of modesty. While the said\n\nSection 73 does not apply to the 1stand the 5thCharges, Section\n\n354A (1) of the Penal Code (in respect of the 1stCharge) already provides for\n\nmandatory imprisonment of not less than two years and not more than 10 years and for\n\nmandatory caning and Section 376 (1) of the Penal Code already provides for mandatory\n\nimprisonment of up to 20 years together with a discretionary fine or caning. Nevertheless,\n\nsuch offences committed against domestic maids must, in the spirit of Section 73, be\n\nregarded as aggravated offences.13 The unfortunate victim was terrorized\n\nfrom the very first day of her employment in the Accused’s flat. He had the audacity\n\nto telephone his wife to complain that the new maid refused to strip! Even if he had\n\ndeliberately mispronounced \"strip\" to make it sound like \"sweep\", it\n\nwould still show what a shamelessly cunning man he was.14 Having been let off by his maid for the\n\nearlier instances of outrage of her modesty, the unappreciative and unremorseful Accused\n\nnevertheless progressed to more intrusive molestation of her body and this culminated in\n\nthe rape on Valentine’s Day this year.15 It is clear that the most serious\n\noffence in the series of Charges here is that of rape. The guidelines on sentencing in\n\nrape cases enunciated by our Court of Appeal inFrederick Chia Kim Heng v PP[1992] 1 SLR 361have been cited so frequently and are so well known I need not repeat them here.\n\nIt is sufficient to state that the starting point of punishment for an adult rapist is 10\n\nyears imprisonment and six strokes of the cane in a contested matter.16 InPP v Soip Bin Mohd Saju(Criminal Case No. 50 of 1999 – unreported), the Accused claimed trial before me to\n\none Charge of rape under Section 376 (1) of the Penal Code and three Charges of outrage of\n\nmodesty under Section 354 of the Penal Code committed against his domestic maid. I\n\nconvicted him and sentenced him to 12 years imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane for\n\nthe rape charge and 15 months imprisonment for two of the outrage of modesty charges\n\ninvolving the touching of the victim’s breasts and 24 months imprisonment for the\n\nremaining outrage of modesty charge involving the use of a vibrator on the victim’s\n\nprivate parts. I ordered the imprisonment sentence for the rape charge and one of the\n\n15-month imprisonment sentences to run consecutively making a total sentence of 13 years 3\n\nmonths and nine strokes of the cane.17 There are some salient differences\n\nbetween the present case and the facts inSoip’s case. The accused here has\n\npleaded guilty and indeed has indicated he would do so even at the stage of the\n\nPreliminary Inquiry. This is his strongest mitigating factor. Soip made the victim there\n\nrecount her story in Court and cast aspersions on her character. Here, the offences\n\nstarted from the very first day of the maid’s employment and covered a period of some\n\nthree and a half months whereas all the offences inSoip’s casetook place on\n\nthe same day. The maid here would therefore have suffered longer and would be in constant\n\ndread and fear of the next encounter. Soip was nearly 50 years old and was spared some\n\ncaning as he would not be liable to be caned if he were already 50 years of age at the\n\nmaterial time. To aggravate the sorry situation, the Accused here announced to his wife\n\nwith seeming nonchalance and arrogance his sordid act using the graphic four-letter word.\n\nAlthough the telephone call to his wife was made at the insistence of the victim, one\n\ncould almost sense his conceited indifference to what he had done to the poor maid. It was\n\nas if he felt a surge of masculine pride at having committed the outrageous offence.18 Considering all the circumstances, I\n\nnow sentence the Accused as follows:(1) 1stCharge - 3 years\n\n  imprisonment and 6 strokes.(2) 2ndCharge - 1 year\n\n  imprisonment.(3) 5thCharge - 12 years\n\n  imprisonment and 12 strokes.The imprisonment terms for the 1stand 5thCharges are to run consecutively with effect from today while the\n\nimprisonment term for the 2ndCharge is to run concurrently with the other two.\n\nThe total sentence is therefore 15 years imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane.Tay Yong KwangJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
