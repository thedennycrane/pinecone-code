        "Facts": "1\n\n        In this trial, the following facts by and large\n\nwere not in dispute. The plaintiffs are a company incorporated in the Republic of China.\n\nThey wanted to purchase 1,920 pieces of computer chips (model Intel E28F320J5-120) for\n\nresale to their customers. In this they enlisted the assistance of a Singapore commission\n\nagent, one Sean Lim Chong Jin (PW-1) (‘Sean Lim’). Sean Lim became the\n\nplaintiffs’ local representative since early January 2000.2\n\n        Sean Lim for his part sent out a mass\n\nelectronic mail (‘e-mail’) to prospective suppliers. The result was that he\n\nreceived an e-mail on 11 August 2000 from the first defendants, a company incorporated in\n\nSingapore. The said e-mail (DB-8) read thus:Attn:\n\n            Mr Sean LimFrom: Philip LohDear SeanWe are pleased to offer as follow\n\n    (sic):1. Model : Intel E28F320J5-1202.

It was reportedly from T & M International and was sent to\n\nSean Lim by the first defendants.5\n\n        In the event, on 24 August 2000, the plaintiffs\n\nforwarded their purchase order to the first defendants. Since the said purchase order\n\nbecame the central piece in this litigation, it requires reproduction in full and is as\n\nfollows:Attn: Mr Philip LohPurchase OrderP.NO.:SK-001Date: Aug. 24, 2000Vendor : Sinko Technologies Pte\n\n    Ltd10 Anson Road #23-15,\n\n    International PlazaSingapore 079903Tel: 65-227-8689 Fax: 65-227-8609Deliver to: 8F-6, No. 678, Sec.\n\n    4, Pa-The Rd.,Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C.(…)Payment: By T/T In AdvanceDelivery(ies): A.S.A.P.

The purchase order which was forwarded to the attention of Philip Loh\n\nof the first defendants named the defendants as vendors. At the bottom left-hand corner of\n\nthe purchase order, there was a space for signature under the notation ‘confirmed\n\nby’. This was reportedly signed by one JB Lee describing himself as the president of\n\none T & M International and returned to the plaintiffs. At the time the plaintiffs\n\nforwarded the purchase order to the first defendants, the plaintiffs had admittedly no\n\nclue as to the actual relationship between the first defendants and the said T & M\n\nInternational.7\n\n        The plaintiffs next wrote to the defendants on\n\n25 August 2000 stating that they would be arranging for telegraphic transfer of the sale\n\namount on 28 August 2000 and requested the first defendants to arrange shipment of the\n\ngoods by Fedex immediately after receipt of payment. Following the said communication, the\n\nplaintiffs, on 28 August 2000, remitted US$134,400 to T & M International as advised\n\nby the defendants’ Philip Loh in his e-mail dated 28 August 2000.8\n\n        Contrary to expectation, the goods were not\n\ndespatched to the plaintiffs. On 30 August 2000, JB Lee of T & M International\n\nreportedly wrote to the first defendants that payment for the goods had already been made\n\nto ‘Intel U.S.’ and that T & M International expected delivery of the goods\n\nby 6 September 2000 latest. On 31 August 2000 the plaintiffs protested to the first\n\ndefendants regarding the delay. They warned the first defendants that if the\n\nplaintiffs’ customers were to insist on cancelling the order because of the delay,\n\nthe plaintiffs would look to the first defendants not only for the return of the amount\n\npaid but also for compensation for any resulting loss. On 4 September 2000, the plaintiffs\n\nwrote to the first defendants again, this time conveying their customers’ demand for\n\ncompensation as a result of the delay in the delivery of the goods. This letter was\n\nfollowed by a letter from the plaintiffs’ solicitors dated 12 September 2000 in which\n\nthe plaintiffs’ solicitors said that the non-delivery of the goods by 30 August 2000\n\nconstituted a breach of the agreement entered into between the parties and that the amount\n\npaid towards the purchase of the goods be refunded to the plaintiffs within three days\n\nfrom the date of the letter together with a sum to be determined in respect of losses\n\nsuffered by the plaintiffs.9\n\n        On 20 September 2000, the first\n\ndefendants’ solicitors replied to the plaintiffs’ solicitors. In this letter,\n\nthe first defendants’ solicitors stated that their clients were not liable to the\n\nplaintiffs in any way as they were only acting as an intermediary between T & M\n\nInternational and the plaintiffs and the role of the first defendants was no more than\n\nmere sourcing agents.",
        "Pleadings": "10\n\n        The pleaded case of the plaintiffs against the\n\nfirst and second defendants was in the alternative. The earlier parts of the statement of\n\nclaim (paras 1 to 4) were directed against the first defendants for breach of contract.\n\nThe plaintiffs averred in those paragraphs as follows:1. By a contract in writing as\n\n    evidenced by the following documents:-(a) an offer in writing from the\n\n      First Defendants addressed to the Plaintiffs, through the Plaintiffs’ Singapore\n\n      representative, dated the 23rdday of August, 2000; and(b) a Purchase Order No: SK-001\n\n      from the Plaintiffs addressed to the First Defendants dated the 24thday of\n\n      August, 2000;the First Defendants agreed to\n\n    sell and deliver 1920 pieces of computer chips model: Intel E28F320J5-120 at US$70.00 per\n\n    piece to the Plaintiffs immediately after receipt of payment from the Plaintiffs. The\n\n    Plaintiffs will refer to the documents at the trial for their full terms and effects.2. On the 28thday of\n\n    August, 2000, and acting on the terms of the contract or the instructions of the First\n\n    Defendants, the Plaintiffs made payment of or remitted a sum of US$134,400.00, by way of\n\n    telegraphic transfer through a financial institution, to the Second Defendants in full\n\n    payment of the agreed price for the 1920 pieces of computer chips Model: Intel\n\n    E28F320J5-120. The Second Defendants have duly acknowledged receipt of the said sum of\n\n    US$134,400.00.3. At all material times, the\n\n    First Defendants well knew that the Plaintiffs bought the said 1920 pieces of computer\n\n    chips Model No: E28F320J5-120 in the ordinary course of their business for resale at a\n\n    profit to their customers.4. In breach of the said\n\n    contract, the First Defendant wrongfully failed refused and/or neglected to deliver any of\n\n    the 1920 pieces of computer chips Model No: E28F320J5-120 within a reasonable time or at\n\n    all and the First Defendants have wrongfully repudiated the said contract, which\n\n    repudiation the Plaintiffs have accepted by way of a letter from the Plaintiffs’\n\n    Solicitors dated the 12thday of September, 2000.11\n\n        Averments in second part of the claim framed in\n\nthe alternative against the second defendants, were as follows:5. Alternatively, by a contract\n\n    in writing as evidenced by a Proforma Invoice No. I-23080 from the Second Defendants\n\n    addressed to the Plaintiffs dated the 23rdday of August, 2000 but sent by the\n\n    First Defendants to the Plaintiffs, the Second Defendants agreed to sell and deliver 1920\n\n    pieces of computer chips Model: Intel E28F320J5-120 at US$70.00 per piece to the\n\n    Plaintiffs on the following terms :-(a) the Plaintiffs are to arrange\n\n      for telegraphic transfer of the full purchase price to the Second Defendants in advance;\n\n      and(b) the computer chips so ordered\n\n      will be shipped Free On Board (F.O.B.) via the United States of America to the Plaintiffs.The Plaintiffs will refer to the\n\n    said Proforma Invoice at the trial for its full terms and effects.6. On the 28thday of\n\n    August, 2000, the Plaintiffs made payment or remitted a sum of US$134,400.00, by way of\n\n    telegraphic transfer through a financial institution, to the Second Defendants in full\n\n    payment of the agreed price for the 1920 pieces of computer chips Model: Intel\n\n    E28F320J5-120. The Second Defendants have duly acknowledged receipt of the said sum of\n\n    US$134,400.00.7. At all material times, the\n\n    Second Defendants well knew that the Plaintiffs bought the said 1920 pieces of computer\n\n    chips Model No: E28F320J5-120 in the ordinary course of their business for resale at a\n\n    profit to their customers.8. In breach of the said\n\n    contract, the Second Defendants wrongfully failed refused and/or neglected to deliver any\n\n    of the 1920 pieces of computer chips Model No: E28F320J5-120 within a reasonable time or\n\n    at all and the Second Defendants have wrongfully repudiated the said contract, which\n\n    repudiation the Plaintiffs have accepted by the issuance of the present Writ.9. By reasons of the matters\n\n    stated in paragraphs 5 to 8 aforesaid, the consideration for the payment of US$134,400.00\n\n    has wholly failed, and the Second Defendants have had and received the said sum of\n\n    US$134,400.00 to the use of the Plaintiffs.12\n\n        The second defendants did not file any defence\n\nand neither did they take any steps to contest the plaintiffs’ claim. As for the\n\nfirst defendants, their defence in sum, was that they acted only as sourcing agents and as\n\nintermediaries between the plaintiffs and the second defendants. Their defence insofar as\n\nwas material (paras 1 to 5), read thus:1. The 1stDefendants\n\n    deny that they made the contract alleged in paragraph 1 of the statement of claim or any\n\n    contract with the Plaintiffs.2. The 1stDefendants\n\n    say that the Plaintiffs knew or ought to have known that at all material times, the 1stDefendants acted only as sourcing agents; and as intermediary between the Plaintiffs and\n\n    the 2ndDefendants.3. The 1stDefendants\n\n    further say that the alleged offer in writing dated 23rdday of August 2000 and\n\n    the Purchase Order No. SK-001 dated 24thAugust 2000 from the Plaintiffs to the\n\n    1stDefendants do not constitute in law an offer and acceptance necessary and\n\n    required for the formation of a contract between the Plaintiffs and the 1stDefendants.4(a) The 1stDefendants also say that the contract for the sale and purchase of the goods referred to\n\n    in the statement of claim, namely 1920 pieces of computer chips model: Intel E28F\n\n    320J5-120 at U$70.00 per piece, is evidenced by the following documents (and not by the 2\n\n    documents referred to in paragraph 1 of the statement of claim):-(1) the Plaintiffs said Purchase\n\n    Order No. SK-001 dated 24thAugust 2000 which said Purchase Order was duly\n\n    confirmed (hence accepted) by the 2ndDefendants (and not by the 1stDefendants).(2) The Proforma Invoice No.\n\n    I-23080 dated 23rdAugust 2000 from the 2ndDefendants to the\n\n    Plaintiffs referred to in the paragraph 5 of the Statement of Claim.(b) The 1stDefendants\n\n    admit paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim in that the Plaintiffs made payment or\n\n    remitted a sum of US$134,400.00 as therein stated, to the 2ndDefendants. The 1stDefendants received no payment whatsoever from the Plaintiffs.5. By reason of the aforesaid\n\n    matters, the 1stDefendants say that:-(a) no contract exist between the\n\n      Plaintiffs and the 1stDefendants for the sale and purchase of the said goods;(b) the contract for the said\n\n      sale and purchase is between the Plaintiffs and the 2ndDefendants.",
        "Evidence": "13\n\n        The facts which were not in dispute have\n\nalready been summarised earlier. I now propose to highlight some aspects of the\n\nparties’ evidence which were at variance.14\n\n        Sean Lim, a sales executive who was the\n\nplaintiffs’ local representative and the person who was charged with the task of\n\nprocuring the goods under reference for the plaintiffs, testified on behalf of the\n\nplaintiffs. After narrating the events and the e-mail exchange which led to the placing of\n\nthe purchase order referred to, he said that following the plaintiffs’ complaint that\n\nthey had yet to receive the goods despite their remitting the purchase price, he met\n\nPhilip Loh of the first defendants on 30 August 2000. At that meeting, Philip Loh told him\n\namongst other things that ‘the second defendants were the branch office of the first\n\ndefendants in the US and that the boss of the second defendants was a good friend of his\n\nboss and that shipment of the goods would be delayed until the 5 or 6 September 2000.15\n\n        Subsequently, he met Simon Tan the marketing\n\nmanager of the first defendants on 1 September 2000. At that meeting, Sean Lim told Simon\n\nTan that the plaintiffs’ customers were threatening to cancel their contract with the\n\nplaintiffs on account of the non-delivery of the said goods and were demanding an\n\nimmediate refund of the purchase price as well as compensation from the plaintiffs.16\n\n        Simon Tan assured Sean Lim at that meeting that\n\nthe goods would be delivered by 6 September 2000. At that meeting, Simon Tan suggested to\n\nSean Lim that the plaintiffs ought to look to the second defendants or the manufacturers\n\nof the goods for compensation for the late or non-delivery of the said goods. Nonetheless,\n\nSimon Tan also assured Sean Lim that there would not be any problems or difficulties for\n\nthe first defendants to make refund of the sum of US$134,4000 or to meet any compensation\n\nsought by the plaintiffs’ customers arising from the late or non-delivery of the\n\ngoods.17\n\n        As it transpired, on 4 September 2000, the\n\nplaintiffs demanded from the first defendants, a sum of US$14,000 as compensation for the\n\ndelay in delivery of the goods contracted to be supplied. But the demand went unheeded by\n\nthe first defendants. Not only that, the first defendants in fact sought to shift the\n\nblame for such non-delivery of the goods on to the plaintiffs, stating that the delay was\n\ndue to late remittance of the purchase price by the plaintiffs.18\n\n        On 8 September 2000, the plaintiffs’\n\nGeneral Manager Kao Wen Teng arrived from Taiwan. He, together with Sean Lim and another\n\nperson by name Tony Tang, called at the offices of the first defendants. Later, they had a\n\nfruitless meeting with Simon Tan who suggested they go after the second defendants or the\n\nmanufacturers of the goods. Simon Tan also stated at that meeting that he would be flying\n\nto the US to check on the situation and to collect the sum of US$134,400 from the second\n\ndefendants. Since nothing seemed to be materialising, the plaintiffs sought legal advice\n\nand the upshot was a demand letter from their solicitors dated 12 September 2000,\n\naddressed to the first defendants.19\n\n        On 13 September 2000, the plaintiffs received a\n\nletter of demand from their customers, one Component Sourcing House, demanding the return\n\nof a sum of US$149,760 being the sum paid by them to the plaintiffs for the purchase of\n\nthe said goods. This sum of $149,760 was subsequently paid over by way of instalments to\n\nMitkem Technologies who are the customers of Component Sourcing House.20\n\n        According to Sean Lim, the plaintiffs were sent\n\na copy of a letter dated 27 September 2000 from the first defendants to T & M\n\nInternational. It appeared from that letter that the first defendants had asked T & M\n\nInternational to deal with the plaintiffs directly stating that the first defendants’\n\n‘role as a middleman is limited and [they were] in no position to reply [to the\n\nplaintiffs] on the refund of money.’21\n\n        There were other details recounted by Sean Lim\n\nwhich do not require mention here save for the aspect that the second defendants were\n\napparently willing to assume responsibility for the fiasco and in the process were seen to\n\nbe blaming one Malaysian Corporation known as Nikiwa for the default.22\n\n        It must be mentioned presently that Sean\n\nLim’s assertion that Philip Loh told him on 30 August 2000 that the second defendants\n\nwere the branch office of the first defendants in the US was not disputed by the defence.23\n\n        The testimony of Kao Wen Tang (PW-2), the\n\nGeneral Manager of the plaintiffs was confirmatory of the account narrated by Sean Lim.\n\nAdditionally, Kao Wen Tang averred how the plaintiffs arranged to pay Mitkem Technologies\n\ntheir claim for refund of the sums paid by them.24\n\n        Anita Kuo Hsiu-Chin (PW-3), Assistant Manager\n\nof the plaintiffs, in her testimony adopted what was narrated by Sean Lim and Kao Wen\n\nTang.25\n\n       Philip Loh Wei Siang (DW-1), sales manager was the\n\nonly person who testified for the defence. His evidence can be summarised as follows.26\n\n        The first defendants’ business included\n\nimport and export of goods in the electronic field. The first defendants also acted as\n\nintermediaries between buyers and sellers. Between 31 July and 23 August 2000, he had a\n\nnumber of telephone conversations with the plaintiffs’ representative Sean Lim. In\n\none of his conversations - he could not quite recall when it was – he told Sean Lim\n\nthat the first defendants were only sourcing agents and that they would try to source for\n\nthe goods the plaintiffs wanted. He told Sean Lim that the first defendants would not be\n\nsupplying goods themselves but would be middlemen or intermediaries between the plaintiffs\n\nand sellers.27\n\n        Philip Loh claimed that the plaintiffs knew or\n\nought to have known that the first defendants would not enter into any contract with the\n\nplaintiffs and the contract would be between the plaintiffs and the actual supplier of\n\ngoods. He then recounted the e-mail exchanges between the parties culminating in the\n\npurchase order from the plaintiffs. He added that he sent the purchase order to the second\n\ndefendants and after it was signed by the second defendants below the column\n\n‘confirmed by’ he forwarded the confirmed purchase order to the plaintiffs. He\n\nfurther claimed that the purchase order thus confirmed by the second defendants ought to\n\nhave made the plaintiffs aware that the second defendants were the sellers of the goods to\n\nthe plaintiffs and the first defendants were only the intermediaries. Further, according\n\nto him, the second defendants had also given the plaintiffs a proforma invoice dated 23\n\nAugust 2000 (DB-15).28\n\n        According to Philip Loh, unfortunately the\n\ngoods were not delivered by the second defendants to the plaintiffs after payment from the\n\nplaintiffs had been received by the second defendants. He disclosed that the first\n\ndefendants even made a report to the police on 7 September 2000 casting aspersions on the\n\nplaintiffs’ motives. In the said police report (DB-24/25), the first defendants’\n\nPhilip Loh and Simon Tan described the second defendants as their ‘US contact\n\npoint’. In the last two sentences of the first paragraph of the report, both Philip\n\nLoh and Simon Tan said: ‘In the meantime we find it highly suspicious the default\n\nof the Malaysian supplier coincided exactly with Trigen (sic) urgency for delivery. We\n\nhave refused to pay compensation to Trigen as we think they are in league with the\n\nMalaysian supplier and are trying to make off with the compensation.’29\n\n        As it transpired, the Commercial Affairs\n\nDepartment of Singapore informed the first defendants on 28 December 2000 that they had\n\ncarefully considered the matter and that they were of the view that no criminal offence\n\nhad been disclosed (DB-27).30\n\n        In cross-examination, Philip Loh reiterated\n\nthat he told Sean Lim on 31 July 2000 before the issuance of the purchase order that the\n\nfirst defendants were a trading company and they would like to source for the plaintiffs\n\nfor the items under reference (page 240 of the NE). He was then referred to an e-mail\n\ndated 26 August 2000. The said e-mail reads as follows:1. My branch office in U.S. found\n\n    30K pcs Intel DA28F640J5-150 at US$105.00 with 2000+ data code. Anyway, I rejected them\n\n    due to high price. They are still searching and believe they can have the price early next\n\n    wk, price that is near our current item. They also found some qty <5.6K pcs> going\n\n    at US$88.00 but need to be confirmed. Anyway, need to check on the packing because\n\n    standard is not 960 pcs. Will keep you update asap. Any idea on its standard pack ???2. Current item, Intel\n\n    E28F320J5-120, found 3840 pcs going at US$71.00. Are you interested. Got this news in the\n\n    late evening, U.S. timing, can only confirm on Monday.3. Need your help. Regarding the\n\n    T/T remittance, I need your Taiwan office to wire early on Monday morning, so that when\n\n    U.S. starts their Monday, hopefully the money will be in. (takes 24-36 hrs to be in).\n\n    Please call Anita to arrange this, it is very important to us. Please help. Our branch\n\n    office actually have their difficulties to answer to their supplier when the money was\n\n    delayed. I’m afaraid any more delay will spell trouble and my head will roll. I need\n\n    to answer to my boss.Thank you for your kind attention\n\n    and look forward to your reply soon.Regards.P.S. This e-mail address is my\n\n    home address, while I work on wkends. Anyway, you have my contact number if you need to\n\n    call me, right ???31\n\n        When questioned by the court (page 280 of the\n\nNE) whether the first defendants had indeed a branch office in the US, he replied in the\n\nnegative. When asked why then he used the phrase ‘our branch office in U.S.’ in\n\nhis e-mail dated 26 August 2000 addressed to the plaintiffs, his reply was: ‘In this\n\nmarket, it is common to use counterparts’ branch office to show the close link with\n\nthe supplier’ (page 280 of the NE, lines 24-26). He admitted however that his\n\nrepresentation was untrue (page 281 of the NE).32\n\n        His answers in cross-examination suggested\n\n(pages 303 and 304 of the NE) that the first defendants were contemplating paying\n\ncompensation to the plaintiffs after the police had concluded that there was no criminal\n\noffence. He added that they would have paid the compensation provided there was a second\n\npurchase order from the plaintiffs. The evidence in this respect (pages 303 and 304 of the\n\nNE) reads as follows:Q All right. Now, I’m going\n\n    back to your police report, that is DB25, to the last sentence again which we’ve just\n\n    touched on earlier, (reads) \"We have refused to pay the compensation to Trigen as we\n\n    think that they are in league with the Malaysian supplier and are trying to make off with\n\n    the compensation\", right?A Yes.Q So would I be correct to say\n\n    now, all right, the only reason that the 1stDefendants refused to pay the\n\n    compensation is because you believe that they’re in league with the Malaysian\n\n    supplier? Now the police have concluded the investigation, they have found no criminal\n\n    offence. So there are no reasons now for the 1stDefendants not to pay the\n\n    compensation, would you agree?A I would agree at that time\n\n    provided there was a second purchase order.His Honour: Do you seriously\n\n      expect a second purchase order when you’ve not even supplied the goods for the first\n\n      purchase order?Witness: Sorry, your Honour?His Honour: You haven’t\n\n      supplied the goods, neither you nor T&M.Witness: Mm-hmm.His Honour: Then do you expect\n\n      the Plaintiffs to give you a second order and send you further monies?Witness: At that time, before the\n\n      3rdof September, before meeting up with Mr Lee, the Plaintiff actually told us\n\n      that there would be a second purchase order. So at that time, we wanted to pay for the\n\n      compensation---His Honour: What is the value of\n\n      the second purchase order?Witness: The second purchase\n\n      order is one dollar above the original one, that is seventy-one.His Honour: For how many units?Witness: The same unit, 1,920\n\n      pieces.His Honour: So you will not make\n\n      any money. The first purchase order, you’ll be making about US$6,000.Witness: Yes.His Honour: Second one,\n\n      you’ll make probably about $7,000. You pay about $16,000 of compensation, your\n\n      Company will lose $3,000. Wouldn’t your head roll?Witness: We know from the\n\n      Plaintiff that subsequent purchase order would continue to come.His Honour: I see.Witness: Every week one purchase\n\n      order.His Honour: All right.Q All right, Mr Loh, I’m\n\n    putting to you, all right, these are my instructions. One, now, there is a contract\n\n    between the Plaintiffs and the 1stDefendants for the purchase of the computer\n\n    goods, that’s 1,920 pieces of the computer chips, would you agree?A No.",
        "Issues": "33\n\n        The main issue in this case was whether there\n\nwas in fact a contract for sale of goods between the first defendants and the plaintiffs\n\nor whether the contract, if any, was between the plaintiffs and the second defendants, the\n\nfirst defendants acting only as an intermediary or sourcing agents. The next issue related\n\nto a pleading point. The issue here was whether the plaintiffs in framing a claim against\n\nthe second defendants in the alternative, as pleaded in para 5 of the statement of claim,\n\nwere prevented from proceeding against the first defendants.",
        "Arguments": "34\n\n        Let me first summarise the first\n\ndefendants’ contentions as advanced by their counsel. His submissions as contained in\n\nthe concluding part of his closing submission read thus:(1) the contract for the sale of\n\n    the goods [was] not between the Plaintiffs and the 1stDefendants.(2) The contract for the sale of\n\n    the goods [was] between the Plaintiffs and the 2ndDefendants.(3) The quotation D11 [was] not\n\n    the offer and accordingly incapable of acceptance.(4) The purchase order (DB 13/14)\n\n    [was] the offer by the Plaintiffs.(5) The 1stDefendants\n\n    did not accept the offer; the offer was accepted by the 2ndDefendants.(6) The Plaintiffs were aware\n\n    that they were dealing with the 2ndDefendants as their sellers and paid the\n\n    purchase price of US$134,400.00 to the 2ndDefendants in accordance with the\n\n    Proforma Invoice (DB-15) issued by the 2ndDefendants to the Plaintiffs.(7) The Plaintiffs’\n\n    \"branch office allegation\" [was] an afterthought. The evidence [showed] that the\n\n    allegations [were] untrue and cannot be relied upon.(8) The 1stand 2ndDefendants [were] separate legal entities and sued as such by the Plaintiffs. The\n\n    \"branch office allegation\" [was] a material allegation which [had] not been\n\n    pleaded. The Plaintiffs [were] estopped from doing so.(9) The Plaintiffs’ claims\n\n    against the 1stDefendants [were] unsupported by the evidence. The Plaintiffs\n\n    [had] failed to prove their case on a balance of probabilities.35\n\n        The first defendants’ counsel’s\n\nsupplemental submission insofar as was material, was as follows:The Pleading Point:(1) The specific point requiring\n\n    address here is:-\"whether or not, the\n\n      Plaintiffs are bound by paragraph 5 of the amended statement of claim\"(2) Paragraph 5 starts off with\n\n    the words:\"Alternatively, by a\n\n      contract in writing as evidenced by a proforma Invoice No. 1-2308 from the Second\n\n      Defendants addressed to the Plaintiffs dated the 23rdday of August 2000 but\n\n      sent by the First Defendants to the Plaintiffs, the Second Defendants agreed to sell and\n\n      deliver 1920 pieces of computer chips Model: Intel E28F320J5-120 at US$70.00 per piece to\n\n      the Plaintiffs on the following terms .….\"(3) In essence, this paragraph\n\n    states that it was the 2ndDefendants who agreed to sell and deliver the goods\n\n    in question.(4) As it turned out, on the\n\n    special facts in this particular case, what the Plaintiffs had pleaded in paragraph 5 is\n\n    in fact what the 1stDefendants say are the true facts of the matter.(5) It is well established that\n\n    pleadings have a binding effect. The Plaintiffs (and the Defendants) are bound by their\n\n    respective pleadings.(6) The need for and the very\n\n    purpose of pleadings make it crucial that the rule whereby parties are bound by the\n\n    respective pleadings be adhered to strictly. Otherwise the position would be quite\n\n    chaotic. Parties in a civil case would be at large to wander as they wish and justice\n\n    would not be done.…(9) The nett effect … is\n\n    that the Plaintiffs’ are estopped and cannot be heard to say that paragraph 5 of\n\n    their amended statement of claim is of no effect and do not bind them.…36\n\n        The plaintiff’s counsel’s closing\n\nsubmission in brief was that the plaintiffs, in the first instance entered into a contract\n\nfor the supply of goods with the first defendants as vendors. It was further submitted\n\n(see page 32 of plaintiffs’ written submission) that when DB-14 (the purchase order)\n\nwas returned by the first defendants to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs had no reason to\n\ndoubt that there was in fact a contract between the plaintiffs and the first defendants as\n\nvendors and not otherwise. Plaintiffs’ counsel also highlighted the aspect that\n\nPhilip Loh in his e-mail (DB-18) addressed to the plaintiffs, intimated to them that the\n\nfirst defendants’ branch office in US had found the goods under reference for sale\n\nand their ‘branch office’ were encountering difficulties in answering their\n\nsuppliers on account of the delay in payment.37\n\n        In relation to the pleading point, counsel for\n\nthe plaintiffs argued that the alternative plea in para 5 of the statement of claim did\n\nnot prevent them from seeking judgment against the first defendants. He submitted that the\n\nplaintiffs had made it clear at the commencement of the trial that they were pursuing\n\ntheir claim only against the first defendants (see page 21, para 3.3 of their written\n\nsubmission) and so long as the plaintiffs had not entered judgment against the second\n\ndefendants, they were not precluded under law from seeking relief and obtaining judgment\n\nagainst the first defendants.",
        "Conclusion": "38\n\n        As mentioned by me earlier, there were two main\n\nissues to be decided in this case. The first issue was whether there was in fact a\n\ncontract between the plaintiffs and the first defendants for sale by the first defendants\n\nto the plaintiffs, of 1920 pieces of computer chips (marked Intel E28F 320 J5-120) or\n\nwhether the first defendants acted purely as sourcing agents or intermediaries between the\n\nsecond defendants and the plaintiffs in relation to the said sale. The other issue was\n\nwhether the plaintiffs’ claim framed in the alternative against the first and second\n\ndefendants, barred the plaintiffs from claiming relief against the first defendants in\n\nthis action.39\n\n        In determining who is entitled to sue or liable\n\nto be sued on a contract, a useful point as suggested by Diplock LJ (as he then was) where\n\nthe contract is in writing, is to look at the contract itself (Teheran- Europe Co\n\nLtd v S T Belton (Tractors), Ltd[1968] 2 All ER 886 at 890G). He further said at\n\npage 893B:… The task of the court in construing any contract is to look at the words used in\n\n    the contract and at what has passed between the contracting parties before it was made,\n\n    and to determine what it was that the party alleged to be in breach, by the words of the\n\n    contract and his conduct, induced the other party to believe he was accepting a legally\n\n    enforceable obligation to do or to refrain from doing. …40\n\n        The key document in this case was the purchase\n\norder (DB-13). Dealing with this document, the first defendants’ counsel’s\n\nsubmission was that the purchase order DB-13 was to be regarded as an offer and that offer\n\nwas accepted not by the first defendants but by the second defendants and hence the\n\ncontract, if any, was between the plaintiffs and the second defendants and not with the\n\nfirst defendants. In my determination, having regard to the manner in which the parties\n\nwere dealing with each other and the exchange of the e-mails between them, the argument\n\npresented by the defendants’ counsel did not appear to possess much cogency.41\n\n        Much was spoken by counsel for the first\n\ndefendants on the significance of the signature under the confirmation column of the\n\npurchase order (DB-14) by J B Lee of T & M International. In my view, the said\n\nsignature - that too inserted without prior consultation or the knowledge of the\n\nplaintiffs – did not in any way alter the character of the contract entered (between\n\nthe plaintiffs and the first defendants) where the first defendants were unequivocally\n\nidentified and described as the vendors. If the first defendants indeed were the sourcing\n\nagents, then they should have, before they returned the purchase order to the plaintiffs,\n\npointed out to the latter that their role was merely that of sourcing agents or\n\nintemediaries.42\n\n        Counsel for the first defendants attempted his\n\nbest to argue his clients’ case by characterising them as sourcing agents and\n\nintemediaries between the plaintiffs and the second defendants. But the documents produced\n\nto the court, viewed in their proper perspective did not support his contention. On the\n\ncontrary, the first defendants were at all times seen to be projecting themselves all\n\nalong as the vendors of the goods. This was evident from the first defendants’ e-mail\n\ndated 11 August 2000 (DB-8) – which commenced with the opening line: ‘We are\n\npleased to offer as follow. (sic)’ The said e-mail also ended with this line:\n\n‘Kindly let us know your decision soon as oursuppliercan only hold (sic) for\n\n24 hours (highlight added).’ Again in the first defendants’ e-mail dated 23\n\nAugust 2000 (DB-11) with a subject heading ‘quotation’, the first defendants\n\nafter stating, ‘we are pleased to offer as follow’ (sic), seemed to be\n\nrequesting the plaintiffs to forward them the purchase order and T/T documents ‘in\n\norder for [the first defendants] to secure these cargo.’ Similarly, in another e-mail\n\ndated 23 August 2000 (PB-6), the first defendants were seen to be urging the plaintiffs to\n\nissue the purchase order to Sinko – the first defendants - urgently.43\n\n        Furthermore, the first defendants’\n\ncontention that they were only sourcing agents or intemediaries did not seem to cohere\n\nwith their representation that the second defendants were their branch office as contained\n\nin the first defendants’ e-mail dated 26 August 2000 (DB-18). When asked by the court\n\nwhy they chose to describe the second defendants as their branch office, Philip Loh could\n\nonly say: ‘In this market, it is common to use counterparts’ branch office to\n\nshow the close link with the supplier.’ (page 280 (lines 24-26) and page 281 (lines\n\n8-9) of the NE). In my evaluation, if the first defendants were in fact acting as sourcing\n\nagents or intemediaries, there was no reason for Philip Loh to portray the second\n\ndefendants as their branch office in their e-mails.44\n\n        It would also appear from the evidence of Sean\n\nLim - which I accepted as cogent and having a persuasive ring to it - that even after the\n\nnon-delivery, Philip Loh of the first defendants was trying to assuage the plaintiffs by\n\nsaying that the first defendants’ branch office ie, the second defendants could not\n\nmeet the agreed delivery deadline and the goods would be delayed to the 5 or 6 of\n\nSeptember 2000. There was no mention even at this stage that the second defendants were\n\nthe contracting parties with the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs should look to the\n\nsecond defendants and not to the first defendants for relief.45\n\n        Counsel for the first defendants submitted that\n\nsince the branch office aspect was not pleaded by the plaintiffs, the court should\n\ndisregard any submissions based on it. I found this argument totally disingenuous since\n\nthe very assertion that the second defendants were the branch office of the first\n\ndefendants was contained in the e-mails sent by the first defendants to the plaintiffs and\n\nthese documents were included in the defence bundle (DB-18) and admitted in evidence\n\nwithout any qualification by the parties. In my opinion, there was no validity in the\n\nargument by the first defendants’ counsel that a litigant cannot rely on an\n\nuncontroverted document to add weight to his claim or cast doubt on the veracity of the\n\nopponent. In the circumstances, the argument so advanced by counsel for the first\n\ndefendant ought to failin limine.46\n\n        Another unsettling aspect in the first\n\ndefendants’ case was that although J B Lee of the second defendants was admittedly in\n\nSingapore on 3 and 4 September 2000 (pages 284 to 285 of the NE), Philip Loh who met J B\n\nLee did not even arrange for J B Lee to meet with the plaintiffs’ representatives.\n\nThis aspect strengthened the plaintiffs’ contention that the first defendants were\n\ntreating the second defendants as part of the latter. Furthermore, the first\n\ndefendants’ complaint to the police on 7 September 2000 (page 290 of the NE) seemed\n\nto suggest that the first defendants were not mere sourcing agents or intemediaries. If\n\nthey were indeed such sourcing agents, they would not have made the complaint in the form\n\nin which it had been made; and they would have in fact required the second defendants to\n\nmake the complaint.47\n\n        Moreover, the report itself contained a passage\n\nwhich implied that the parties who would be liable to pay compensation were the first\n\ndefendants. The passage adverted to reads: ‘We have refused to pay compensation to\n\nTrigen as we think they are in league with the Malaysian supplier and are trying to make\n\noff with the compensation.’ In this regard, Philip Loh let slip in his explanation to\n\nthe court (page 300 of the NE, lines 1 to 12) that at that stage they were expecting\n\nanother order from the plaintiffs and if such a second order materialised, the first\n\ndefendants would have paid the compensation. In my determination, this explanation did not\n\nseem to lend any credence to the first defendant’s stand that they were just sourcing\n\nagents for the goods and at this juncture, I must also observe that I did not find the\n\nevidence of Philip Loh that the first defendants were only sourcing agents or\n\nintemediaries, as worthy of any credit.48\n\n        Having considered all the evidence and\n\narguments presented in regard to the first issue, my conclusion was that the first\n\ndefendants did indeed enter into the agreement bespoken with the plaintiffs in the first\n\ninstance, not as a sourcing agents or intemediaries, but on the basis that they were the\n\ncontracting party. The first defendants’ subsequent acts in disclosing the name and\n\nidentity of their suppliers, ie the second defendant, requiring the plaintiffs to make\n\npayment to the second defendants and making the second defendants sign the purchase order\n\nas a confirming party, did not, in any way, absolve the first defendants of their\n\nliability to the plaintiffs. In my view, even if the first defendants were to be held as\n\nagents, it is a settled principle of law (see para 168, Vol 1(2)Halsbury’s\n\nLaws of England, 4thEdn, reissue) that where a person makes a contract\n\nin his own name without disclosing either the name or the existence of a principal, he is\n\npersonally liable on the contract to the other contracting party though he may be in fact\n\nacting on a principal’s behalf. He will continue to be liable even after the\n\ndiscovery of the agency by the other party unless and until there has been an election by\n\nthe other contracting party to look to the principal alone.",
        "The pleading issue": "49\n\n        As regards the second issue ie the pleading\n\nissue raised by the first defendants in relation to para five of the statement of claim\n\nwhich was framed in the alternative and the plaintiffs’ prayers for reliefs in the\n\nalternative, plaintiffs’ counsel was on record from the outset that the plaintiffs\n\nwere not intent on applying for judgment against the second defendants and that the\n\ninclusion of the second defendants in the statement of claim was merely to set out both\n\ndefendants’ respective liabilities. The plaintiffs’ counsel also made it clear\n\nthat the present hearing was directed only against the first defendants and that the\n\nplaintiffs had not availed themselves of the opportunity to enter interlocutory judgment\n\nagainst the second defendants, although they could have done so much earlier. In my view,\n\ninasmuch as the plaintiffs had not so far elected to obtain judgment against the second\n\ndefendants, they were not precluded from praying for judgment against the first\n\ndefendants.50\n\n        In the case before me, the first defendants\n\nclaiming to be the suppliers of goods and later projecting the second defendants as their\n\nbranch office were in a position akin to persons acting on behalf of undisclosed\n\nprincipals. The liability of such agents came for discussion before the English Court of\n\nAppeal inClarkson, Booker Ltd v Andjel[1964] 3 All ER 260. The facts of\n\nthe case as appear in the headnotes of the case are as follows.51\n\n        Acting on behalf of his undisclosed principals,\n\nan agent (the defendant) for a travel agency company, contracting as if he were principal,\n\nbooked flights from Athens to London with the plaintiffs and received credit from them for\n\nthe tickets, having previously done business with them on credit terms. The\n\nplaintiffs’ solicitors wrote letters to both the defendant and the company stating\n\nthat failing payment, proceedings for recovery from the recipient of the letter might be\n\ncommenced. They subsequently wrote further to the travel agency company stating that they\n\nhad instructions to obtain judgment against the company ‘to safeguard [the\n\nplaintiffs’] interests’, and subsequently they issued and served a writ against\n\nthe company. Being later informed that the company was insolvent and was going into\n\nvoluntary liquidation, the plaintiffs did not proceed with the action, but brought an\n\naction against the defendant. The defendant contended that there had been a binding\n\nelection by the plaintiffs to pursue their remedy against the principals, the company.52\n\n        Affirming the decision of the court below, the\n\nCourt of Appeal held that although the commencement of proceedings by the plaintiffs\n\nagainst the principals wasprima facieevidence of election, the issue of the writ\n\nagainst them was not necessarily an abandonment of the plaintiffs’ cause of action\n\nagainst the defendant, the agent; and, on the facts in the present case, there had not\n\nbeen any final election by the plaintiffs to rely on the liability of the company in\n\nexoneration of the defendant.53\n\n        It was further held in that case (per curiam)\n\nif judgment had been obtained by the plaintiffs against the principals, the cause of\n\naction would have merged in the judgment and the plaintiffs could not subsequently have\n\nrecovered against the defendant.54\n\n        It would appear from the views expressed inClarkson\n\nBooker Ltdthat election had to be unequivocal and final election would not take\n\nplace until the party had obtained judgment against one party. I am also of the same\n\nopinion and in the premises, the argument by the first defendants’ counsel that the\n\nplaintiffs were estopped from proceeding against the first defendants as a result of para\n\nfive of the statement of claim and the attendant prayers for relief in the alternative,\n\nwas in my determination, ill-founded.55\n\n        There was one other detail which ought to be\n\nmentioned at this stage. The plaintiffs’ claim was for the refund of the amount paid\n\nfor the goods, ie US$134,400 under prayer 1 and a further sum of US$15,360 under prayer 2\n\nof the statement of claim against the first defendants. There was no dispute raised as to\n\nthe figures stated by the parties and the evidence of the plaintiffs’ witnesses, in\n\nthis connection, stood uncontroverted.56\n\n        Following the principles articulated by Chua J\n\ninBulsing Ltd v Joon Seng & Co[1972] 2 MLJ 43, that the general rule\n\nin the case of breach of contract is that the plaintiffs by way of damages are entitled to\n\nbe put in the same position as he would have been if the contract had been completed, I\n\nawarded judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of US$134,4000 under prayer 1 and a further\n\nsum of US$15,360 under prayer 2 of the statement of claim against the first defendants\n\ntogether with interests thereon at the rate of 6% per annum on the said sums from the date\n\nof writ until judgment, and costs to be taxed, if not agreed upon.",
