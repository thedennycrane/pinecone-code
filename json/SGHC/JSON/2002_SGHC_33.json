        "How many workers did Putiyan employ for the job in question and did WTTS tell him to\n\nemploy them?": "9.    In January 1998, McDermott South East Asia Pte Ltd\n\n(‘McDermott’) was the consignee of the three pieces of cargo. It was not the\n\nultimate end-user and it was supposed to take delivery of the cargo which was to be\n\nunloaded onto the Barge and tow the cargo to Bintan. McDermott owned the Barge.10.    McDermott in turn engaged WTTS to be its clearing agent. This\n\nmeant that WTTS was to do the documentation to clear the cargo and to take delivery of the\n\ncargo.11.    According to William Lee, he had instructed his operations\n\nmanager Heng Hua Lee, also known as David Heng, to give Putiyan the job. This allegedly\n\nmeant that Putiyan was to check the markings of the cargo and take delivery of the cargo.\n\nHe was also to make sure that the Barge was properly balanced after loading of the cargo.\n\nWilliam Lee’s evidence was corroborated by David Heng.12.    WTTS’ position was that the unloading of the cargo was done\n\non ‘liner’s terms’ meaning that it was the carrier’s responsibility to\n\ndischarge the cargo onto the Barge. Accordingly, the carrier or its shipping agent had\n\nengaged a contractor Asian Lift Pte Ltd (‘Asian Lift’) to do the unloading of\n\nthe cargo from the Vessel onto the Barge. Asian Lift owned and operated a floating crane\n\non the Smit Typhoon. The floating crane was to be used to unload the cargo from the Vessel\n\nonto the Barge.13.    It was not disputed that Asian Lift was engaged to do this. It\n\nwas engaged by Canlion Worldwide Project Management Services (‘Canlion’) who\n\nwere in turn likely to have been engaged by the shipping agent Elite Shipping Pte Ltd. The\n\nactual identity of the party who engaged Canlion was not material.14.    At one point WTTS suggested that the Claimant might have been\n\nemployed by Asian Lift but this was denied by Asian Lift. As I have said, the fact that\n\nPutiyan had employed the Claimant was not seriously disputed by WTTS. It was clear to me\n\nthat the Claimant was employed by Putiyan. Whether Putiyan was an employee of WTTS is\n\nanother matter.15.    It was not disputed that WTTS gave instructions to Putiyan for\n\nthe job in question. Whether WTTS had given instructions to Putiyan to employ workers for\n\nthe job in question was also another matter.16.    According to Putiyan, he was told by David Heng to engage three\n\nworkers for the job in question which included the release and unshackling of the cargo.\n\nDavid Heng denied that he had told Putiyan to engage any worker but he contradicted\n\nhimself on this point (Record of Appeal (‘RA’) 376) when he admitted that the\n\njob required workers. I would add that WTTS did not accept that two other workers were\n\nalso employed by Putiyan for the job in question.17.    It was the evidence of Ruby Chan that Putiyan would decide the\n\namount to be paid to workers he employed and it was he who decided who to employ (RA 288,\n\n291 and 241).18.    However this evidence was contradicted by the evidence of David\n\nHeng (at RA 376 and 384) and William Lee (at RA 399). It was clear from their evidence\n\nthat WTTS decided on the number of workers whom Putiyan was to engage for each job and the\n\namount to be paid to the workers.19.    Indeed, even the amount to be received by Putiyan for\n\nrefreshments for the workers would have to be approved by WTTS (see the evidence of Ruby\n\nChan at RA 284 and 322).20.    While WTTS could produce payment vouchers for advance clearance,\n\nrefreshment and mobile escort for the job in question, it did not produce any payment\n\nvoucher for payment of Putiyan’s salary or fee for the job in question. The reason\n\ngiven was that the voucher was missing. Neither was any accounting document produced in\n\nrespect of such a payment. I was of the view that WTTS had deliberately chosen not to\n\ndisclose the payment voucher or any accounting document regarding such a payment because\n\nit would reveal that Putiyan had employed workers for the job.21.    In the circumstances, it was clear to me that Putiyan did employ\n\nthe Claimant and two others for the job in question. Also, he would not have employed them\n\nif WTTS had not told him to do so. The fact that he could not remember the names of the\n\nother two workers at the hearing before the Commissioner was neither here nor there.",
        "Was Putiyan an employee or independent contractor of WTTS at the material time?": "22.    As regards whether Putiyan was an independent contractor, the\n\nCommissioner found the judgment of Chief Justice Yong Pung How in a criminal case helpful.\n\nAt paragraphs 94 and 95 of her grounds of decision, she said:‘94. Hence, in determining the nature of the relationship between\n\n  the Respondent and CW2, I was guided by the principles enunciated by the Honourable Chief\n\n  Justice in the decision ofLee Boon Leong Joseph v PP1997 1 SLR 445at page 454B\n\n  to 454E as follows:\"The definition of the term \"employ\" applicable at the\n\n  time the appellant was arrested is to be found in s 2 of the Act and reads:‘employ’ means to engage or to use the service of any person\n\n    and to pay such person for services rendered or work done or to remunerate such person on\n\n    a piece rate or on a commission basis.InPP v Heng Siak Kwang[1996] 2 SLR 274, I had occasion to\n\n  consider this definition. In the course of that judgment, I said at p 280:The manner of remuneration and control over the workers would often\n\n    be of great significance. If an employer merely paid the foreman a lump sum for the\n\n    workers, and left it to him to decide how much to pay the workers and how many workers to\n\n    employ, it is a strong indication that the foreman was a sub-contractor if the foreman was\n\n    allowed to keep the excess. This suggests that it was the foreman who employed the\n\n    workers. If the employer decided how much to pay each worker and merely used the foreman\n\n    as a conduit, then it might well be the case that the foreman was not a sub-contractor\n\n    even if he might have physically recruited the workers … What was, however,\n\n    reasonably clear in the present case, was that in order for the respondent to have said to\n\n    have employed the workers, there must be a contract of some sort between him and the\n\n    workers.Themanner of remuneration and the degree of control of the workersare thereforetwo significant considerations in determining the existence of any\n\n  employment relationshipfor the purposes of the Act. … It is further important to\n\n  recognise thatthe inquiry is always one into thesubstanceof the relationship\n\n  andnotits form(seePP v Baby Yap[1993] 3 SLR 633(emphasis mine)95. Whilst the cases which promulgated these principles were criminal\n\n  cases involving charges under the Immigration Act, Cap 133, these principles are equally\n\n  applicable in the present case since it is the existence or lack thereof of any\n\n  employer-employee relationship between the Respondent and CW2 that needs to be\n\n  established.’23.    Under s 3(1) of the Act, an employer is liable for personal\n\ninjury by accident caused to a workman arising out ofandin the course of his\n\nemployment.24.    The word used is ‘workman’ not ‘employee’.\n\nHowever, for present purposes, the distinction is not important especially since it was\n\nnot seriously disputed that the Claimant was a workman employed by Putiyan and the\n\nquestion was whether Putiyan did so as an employee or independent contractor of WTTS.25.    I accepted that the factors enunciated by the Chief Justice\n\nshould be considered in determining whether Putiyan was an employee of WTTS when he\n\nemployed the Claimant. However, other factors should also be considered.26.    In the case before me, I considered the following:(a) WTTS would dictate how many workers Putiyan was to employ and the\n\n  amount to be paid to the workers. WTTS would also decide how much was to be paid for\n\n  expenses such as refreshments for the workers.(b) (i) Prior to January 1998, Putiyan was employed by a company\n\n  Foreign Freight Forwarders (S) Pte Ltd (‘FFF\"). This company was controlled by\n\n  William Lee and his wife Ruby Chan. Ruby Chan was also considered as one of the bosses of\n\n  WTTS. WTTS alleged that Putiyan worked for FFF as a wharf clerk until about September 1997\n\n  when Putiyan resigned. Subsequently Putiyan answered an advertisement by WTTS and, out of\n\n  pity, WTTS gave him work from January 1998.(ii) Putiyan was supposed to\n\n  have resigned from FFF in about September 1997 and his letter of resignation dated 2\n\n  October 1997 said this was ‘due to medical problem’. Yet he purportedly\n\n  responded to an advertisement by WTTS and agreed to work for it doing the same thing that\n\n  he had been doing in the past for FFF. Indeed FFF and WTTS shared the same office premises\n\n  and the evidence indicated that in the past Putiyan did work for FFF or WTTS.(iii) It was my view that\n\n  the alleged resignation was probably a ploy to allow WTTS (and FFF) to use Putiyan without\n\n  WTTS having to make any payment to the Central Provident Fund under the relevant\n\n  legislation. This is reinforced by the fact that as at January 1998, Putiyan was still\n\n  using a PSA pass which described him as a wharf clerk of FFF.(c) On 23 January 1998, Putiyan had signed a request for permission to\n\n  park a vehicle. He continued to describe himself as a ‘W/Clerk’ meaning wharf\n\n  clerk. Ruby Chan said that when she was aware of this, she had scolded him but I did not\n\n  accept her evidence on this.(d) In a report by Putiyan dated 26 January 1998 to PSA Corporation\n\n  Limited (‘PSA’), he described himself as being employed by WTTS.(e) A work chit dated 26 January 1998 was produced in evidence by\n\n  Putiyan. It had WTTS’ name typed at the heading. The work chit was also stated to be\n\n  from WTTS (whose name was written in by hand) to the officer-in-charge, Gate 3, PSA\n\n  Police. The work chit stated:‘Please allow bearer Ramlan Bin Haron NRIC 0065936A who is\n\n  employed by my Company to enter PSA for the purpose of working at MV Ocean Ady @ Intermac\n\n  200 from 26/1/98 @ 1800 hrs to 27/1/98 @ 0230 hrs’.WTTS’ name was stamped onto the work chit and signed by Putiyan.\n\n  WTTS’ witnesses denied any knowledge of this work chit but accepted that Putiyan was\n\n  allowed to be in possession of WTTS’ stamp. I was of the view that WTTS had known\n\n  that Putiyan would be issuing these work chits under WTTS’ name from time to time\n\n  when extra labour was required to do a job for WTTS.(f) In a letter dated 31 January 1996 from PSA to WTTS, PSA referred to\n\n  the Claimant as a person ‘who is employed by your company …’. PSA’s\n\n  letter also said that, ‘As the entire cargo operation on the barge was\n\n  supervised/handled by personnel of your company, PSA will not be liable for the accident\n\n  and any claim that may arise thereof’. There was no reply by WTTS to this letter.(g) In a report by Vincent Lee Kim Seng who was an Inspector with the\n\n  PSA’s Auxiliary Police, he referred to the Claimant as a casual worker in the employ\n\n  of McDermott. However he did not have any personal knowledge of this ‘fact’ and\n\n  it was clear from the evidence that the Claimant was not employed by McDermott.(h) Putiyan had also prepared a handwritten report dated 5 February\n\n  1998 for the attention of William Lee and a typed report dated 13 February 1998 to WTTS on\n\n  the condition of the Claimant. He said he was asked by Ruby Chan to put up a report but\n\n  was subsequently asked to retain the reports. I noted that the handwritten report had also\n\n  mentioned that Putiyan had given a sum of money ‘on behalf of the company’,\n\n  meaning WTTS as it was on WTTS’ letterhead, to help the Claimant’s family out.(i) There was no invoice or bill from Putiyan to WTTS for services\n\n  rendered.(j) There was no evidence that Putiyan made a profit from the jobs from\n\n  WTTS. He was paid a sum per hour plus an additional sum for overtime.(k) Putiyan did work only for WTTS and FFF.(l) He had free access to the office premises of WTTS and FFF, although\n\n  WTTS sought to explain this away by the fact that he had been employed by FFF before.(m) He was in possession of a stamp of WTTS and stationery of WTTS.(n) The fact that WTTS did not provide any equipment, gear or uniform\n\n  to Putiyan and the three workers was neither here nor there because there was no\n\n  suggestion that Putiyan provided these himself.27.    In the circumstances, the evidence was overwhelming that Putiyan\n\nwas employed by WTTS and he in turn employed the Claimant, and two others, for WTTS.28.    However, even if Putiyan was an independent contractor, this\n\nwould not absolve WTTS from liability because of s 17(1) of the Act.29.    Section 17(1) states:‘Liability in case of workmen employed by contractors17(1) Where any person (referred to in this section as the principal)\n\n  in the course of or for the purpose of his trade or business contracts with any other\n\n  person (referred to in this section as the contractor) for the execution by the contractor\n\n  of the whole or any part of any work, or for the supply of labour to carry out any work,\n\n  undertaken by the principal, the principal shall be liable to pay to any workmen employed\n\n  in the execution of the work any compensation which he would have been liable to pay if\n\n  that workman had been immediately employed by him.’30.    That is why WTTS also took the position that the Claimant’s\n\ninjury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment.",
        "Did the Claimant’s injury arise out of and in the course of his employment?": "31.    I had concluded that WTTS had directed Putiyan to employ the\n\nClaimant and two other workers. It was illogical for Putiyan and the three workers to be\n\nexpected to be doing the following only: clearing documentation, checking the markings of\n\nthe cargo and the positioning of the cargo when it was loaded on the Barge. All that could\n\nhave been done by Putiyan himself.32.    WTTS’ Counsel Mr Boon Khoon Lim drew my attention to a\n\nhandwritten report by Putiyan dated 26 January 1998 to the PSA about the accident. The\n\nmaterial part stated:‘My assistant, RAMLAN BIN HARON, NRIC 0063589H had volunteered to\n\n  unsling the gear (one side) …. (It is the job of floating owner’s crew).’Mr Boon submitted that this showed that the unshackling was not part of\n\nWTTS’ job.33.    I was of the view that while the unloading of the cargo,\n\nincluding the unshackling, was the primary responsibility of Asian Lift, this did not mean\n\nthat WTTS had no responsibility whatsoever. The three workers were required by WTTS to\n\nhelp out in the unloading of the cargo onto the Barge. Otherwise, there would have been no\n\nneed for the presence and assistance of the three workers.34.    While I had doubts as to whether Putiyan was specifically told\n\nthat the three workers were required to unshackle the cargo, as alleged by Putiyan, I was\n\nof the view that the unshackling was part of their job to assist generally when the cargo\n\nwas being loaded onto the Barge.35.    I would add that WTTS had spent some time in the hearing below to\n\nestablish that the shackles were on top of each crate of cargo and not on the side as\n\nalleged by Putiyan. However, even if WTTS was able to establish this, this would mean that\n\nPutiyan was not to be believed on this point and his credibility would be affected.\n\nHowever, it would not have been affected to the extent that would have caused me to reach\n\na different conclusion as to whether Putiyan had been told to employ the three workers and\n\nwhether the Claimant was in fact a workman of WTTS.36.    Furthermore, even if WTTS was able to establish that the shackles\n\nwere on top of the crate in question, it might mean that the accident might not have\n\noccurred as described by Putiyan.37.    However, if the accident did not occur in the manner described by\n\nPutiyan, how did it occur?38.    At this point, I should mention that WTTS had applied to adduce\n\nevidence from an accident construction expert to show that the Claimant’s alleged\n\nfall was inconsistent with his injury and the accident could not have occurred as\n\ndescribed. However the application was refused by the Commissioner because the fact of the\n\naccident was not disputed and the manner of occurrence of the accident was not a defence\n\nwhich WTTS had raised.39.    Before me, Mr Boon suggested that the injury to the\n\nClaimant’s chest and abdomen might have been caused by a blow or be self inflicted.40.    I was of the view that this suggestion demonstrated how desperate\n\nWTTS was to avoid liability. There was no suggestion by Mr Boon that the additional\n\nevidence would actually state what or who inflicted the alleged blow. Furthermore, there\n\nwas no evidence to support the suggestion that the Claimant would inflict any injury on\n\nhis chest and abdomen. Thirdly, there was no suggestion that the injury to his head was\n\nself-inflicted and the injury to his head was the most important.41.    More importantly, at the beginning of the hearing before the\n\nCommissioner, the injuries suffered by the Claimant as a result of the accident were\n\nstated to be not in dispute.42.    I was of the view that the application to adduce further evidence\n\nwas correctly refused.43.    The fact of the matter was that the injury arose in the course of\n\nthe Claimant’s employment. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the\n\nnatural presumption would be that the injury also arose out of that employment. Indeed\n\nthis presumption has statutory force under s 3(6) of the Act which states:‘(6) For the purposes of this Act, an accident arising in the\n\n  course of a workman’s employment shall be deemed, in the absence of evidence to the\n\n  contrary, to have arisen out of that employment.’44.    In any event, I was of the view that in the light of the\n\nevidence, including evidence by way of photos, the accident probably occurred as described\n\nby Putiyan.45.    Accordingly, the Claimant was a workman of WTTS and his injury\n\ndid arise out of and in the course of his employment.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
