        "Introduction": "1       This registrar’s appeal is another chapter\n                    in this epic piece of litigation which has occupied the courts in Singapore\n                    since 2004. The plaintiff, Beckkett Pte Ltd (“Beckkett”), wishes\n                    to be free of the Singapore proceedings in order to pursue remedies against the\n                    first defendant, Deutsche Bank AG (the “Bank”), in the courts in\n                    Indonesia. This might seem a rather odd course for Beckkett to take since it has\n                    been awarded judgment against the Bank by the Singapore courts but has yet to be\n                    equally successful in Indonesia. Yet when asked to elect between continuing the\n                    Singapore litigation (essentially by proceeding with the assessment of the\n                    damages payable by the Bank) and pursuing its Indonesian action, Beckkett chose\n                    the latter course. 2       The underlying application, Summons No 5313 of\n                    2009, was filed by the Bank on 9 October 2009. By it, the Bank applied for\n                    the following orders: (a)     That Beckkett be ordered to withdraw\n                        forthwith, and be restrained from prosecuting or continuing to prosecute,\n                        the appeal which it had filed in Indonesia against the decision of the\n                        District Court of South Jakarta (the “District Court”) in Suit\n                        No 649/Pdt.G/2008/PN.JKT.SEL (the “Indonesian action”);\n                        and (b)     That\n                        Beckkett be restrained from commencing or continuing any further or other\n                        proceedings of any nature in Indonesia or anywhere else in the world against\n                        the Bank, its agent and/or employees, in relation to the Bank’s sale\n                        in Indonesia of the Pledged Shares (see[7]below) on 21 November 2001. 3       The application was heard before Assistant\n                    Registrar David Lee (the “AR”) over several days. On\n                    12 February 2010, the AR released a long and carefully considered judgment\n                    ([2010] SGHC 55) giving his reasons for the following findings (at [122]\n                    – [126]): (a)     That the legal proceedings in\n                        Singapore and Indonesia were duplicative. (b)     That in making the application, the Bank had come\n                        to the court with clean hands and was entitled to equitable\n                    relief. (c)     The parties\n                        were amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts and that Singapore\n                        is the natural forum of the litigation. (d)     The conduct of Beckkett in maintaining suits in\n                        both Indonesia and Singapore after the Singapore Court of Appeal rendered\n                        its judgment was vexatious and oppressive. (e)     The circumstances, however, were such that it\n                        would be unjust for an anti-suit injunction to be granted against\n                        Beckkett. (f)     It\n                        would not be tenable either to maintain the status quo by dismissing the\n                        Bank’s application and therefore Beckkett had to be ordered to make an\n                        election between proceeding in Singapore for an assessment of damages and\n                        pursuing its claim through further appeals in Indonesia. This election would\n                        be final and irrevocable. 4       Beckkett did not appeal from this decision.\n                    Subsequently it elected to pursue the Indonesian action. The Bank, however,\n                    lodged an appeal and maintained before me that the AR’s order giving\n                    Beckkett the option of an election should be set aside and, instead, the\n                    anti-suit injunction it had applied for should be granted.",
        "Background": "",
        "Course of the litigation in Singapore": "5       The facts giving rise to the original law suit\n                    are a matter of public record. They are set out at length in the judgment of the\n                    court of first instance,Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG\n                        and another[2008] 2 SLR(R) 189 and that of the Court\n                    of Appeal,Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG and another\n                        and another appeal[2009] 3 SLR(R) 452. I will\n                    summarise them as briefly as possible (relying a great deal on the AR’s\n                    account). 6       Beckkett is a Singapore company. It and its\n                    subsidiary, PT Swabara Mining and Energy (“SME”), owned shares in\n                    PT Asminco Bara Utama (“Asminco”) which in turn owned shares in PT\n                    Adaro Indonesia (“Adaro”) which owned a coal mine in Kalimantan.\n                    SME, Asminco and Adaro are Indonesian companies. 7       The Bank is incorporated in Germany and has a\n                    registered branch in Singapore. In 1997, the Bank extended a loan to Asminco.\n                    This loan was supported by a guarantee from Beckkett and pledges by Beckkett and\n                    Asminco of their respective shares in SME, Asminco and Adaro (collectively, the\n                    “Pledged Shares”). Asminco did not repay the loan and the Bank\n                    sold the Pledged Shares to an Indonesian company named PT Dianlia Setyamukti\n                    (“DSM”). The sale was completed on 15 February\n                2002. 8       In April 2004, Beckkett started this action\n                    against the Bank. DSM was joined as the second defendant in February 2005.\n                    Beckkett claimed the following reliefs: (a)     A declaration that the sale of the\n                        Pledged Shares was invalid, null and void and for an order to set it\n                        aside. (b)     A\n                        declaration that the equity of redemption over the Pledged Shares had\n                        thereby been restored to Beckkett, SME and Asminco. (c)     An order that the Bank and DSM return\n                        the Pledged Shares to Beckkett, SME and Asminco\n                    respectively. (d)     Alternatively, damages to be assessed. The Bank defended\n                    the claim and lodged a counterclaim for some US$98m against Beckkett as\n                    guarantor of the loan to Asminco. 9       The trial of the action occupied some 50 days in\n                    the High Court before Kan Ting Chiu J (“the Judge”). Judgment\n                    was reserved and delivered on 21 September 2007. The Judge dismissed\n                    Beckkett’s claim against DSM and the Bank’s counterclaim against\n                    Beckkett. He found (at [152]) that Beckkett had made out a claim that the Bank\n                    had failed to discharge its duties as pledgee when it sold the Pledged Shares\n                    but had failed to show that the Bank had sold those shares at an undervalue. The\n                    Judge therefore awarded Beckkett nominal damages of $1,000. Both Beckkett and\n                    the Bank appealed against this decision. 10     The appeals were heard on 23 April 2008\n                    and judgment was reserved. On 27 April 2009, the Court of Appeal delivered\n                    judgment and allowed the Bank’s appeal in full and Beckkett’s appeal\n                    in part. The relevant findings of the Court of Appeal at [143] of its judgment\n                    are that: (a)     The Bank, in exercising its power of\n                        sale, did not take proper steps to sell the Pledged Shares at the best price\n                        and was therefore in breach of its duty as pledgee and Beckkett had proved\n                        that some of the Pledged Shares had been sold at an\n                    undervalue. (b)     It was\n                        not possible to determine whether the sale of the SME Shares had been at an\n                        undervalue until the values of other shares had been\n                    determined. (c)     Beckkett was entitled to have its loss, if any, determined at an inquiry\n                        for damages and it was further entitled, as guarantor of the loan, to prove\n                        any undervalue with respect to the Pledged Shares and to set the same off\n                        against the Bank’s counterclaim. (d)     Having regard to the subsequent developments relating to\n                        some of the Pledged Shares and the conduct of Beckkett, it would be wholly\n                        inequitable for the court to set aside the sale of the Pledged\n                        Shares. 11     The Court of Appeal made orders to the\n                    following effect: (a)     It dismissed Beckkett’s appeal\n                        against the Judge’s decision to dismiss its claims to set aside the\n                        sale of the Pledged Shares against the Bank and/or DSM. (b)     It allowed Beckkett’s appeal\n                        against the decision of the Judge dismissing Beckkett’s claim for\n                        damages against the Bank and ordered that such damages be assessed before\n                        the Registrar. (c)     It ordered that judgment on the Bank’s counterclaim against Beckkett\n                        be stayed pending the completion of the assessment of\n                damages.",
        "Course of litigation in Indonesia": "12     On 2 May 2008, shortly after it had\n                    presented its appeal to the Court of Appeal, Beckkett filed the Indonesian\n                    action. Essentially its claim was that the sale of the SME shares by the Bank\n                    was unlawful under Indonesian law because: (a)     The sale of the SME shares was based\n                        onpenetapansissued by the District Court\n                        pursuant to anex parteapplication by the\n                        Bank. (b)     Thepenetapanswere successfully challenged by\n                        Beckkett and subsequently set aside and revoked on 9 March\n                    2005. (c)     Therefore,\n                        the sale of the SME shares was contrary to Indonesian law, being a violation\n                        of Articles 1155 and 1156 of the Indonesian Commercial\n                    Code. It should be noted that in his judgment at first\n                    instance, the Judge had found (at [125] to [127] of his judgment) that the sale\n                    of the Pledged Shares was carried out after thepenetapanswere obtained from the District Court but that thepenetapanshad been set aside by the Jakarta\n                    High Court and had not been reinstated. He further held that under Indonesian\n                    law, the position was that there were no valid approvals for the sale and that\n                    the sale was not carried out by lawful means. The issues of the legality of the\n                    sale and the status of thepenetapanswere\n                    integral parts of the case presented by Beckkett before\n                Kan J. 13     The reliefs claimed by Beckkett in the\n                    Indonesian action concerned the return of the SME shares and a declaration that\n                    it was the owner of these shares that it had pledged to the Bank. Beckkett also\n                    wanted declarations that the sale of the SME shares effected by the Bank was\n                    illegal and legally defective and that two documents, the Deed of Sale and\n                    Purchase and the Deed of Minutes, were null and void and any other documents\n                    based on the same were similarly null and void. 14     The Bank responded to the Indonesian action on\n                    30 October 2008 by filing an application known as an “Absolute\n                    Competency Exception” in the District Court. Basically, it sought a stay\n                    of the Indonesian proceedings on the ground that Singapore was the proper forum\n                    under the relevant loan documentation and that Beckkett had acted in bad faith\n                    by filing its claim in Indonesia. This application was rejected on\n                    8 January 2009. The Bank did not appeal. 15     The Indonesian action then proceeded on its\n                    merits. On or about 8 April 2009, the District Court dismissed the suit. On\n                    13 April 2009, Beckkett filed an appeal against that decision (the\n                    “First Indonesian Appeal”). This was some two weeks prior to the\n                    issue of judgment by the Court of Appeal.",
        "Subsequent developments in Singapore and Indonesia": "16     On 25 May 2009, Beckkett filed a summons\n                    for directions for the assessment of damages in the Singapore High Court. Some\n                    three months later, on 24 August 2009, the Bank’s solicitors in\n                    Singapore wrote to Beckkett’s solicitors to ask Beckkett to withdraw the\n                    First Indonesian Appeal. The substantive response, only given on\n                    17 September 2009, was that Beckkett did not intend to withdraw the First\n                    Indonesian Appeal. 17     On 28 September 2009, the Bank’s\n                    Indonesian counsel received a notice from the High Court of Jakarta (the\n                    “JHC”) informing him that the JHC had received the documents in\n                    the First Indonesian Appeal from the District Court. The parties accepted that\n                    as the appeal was against the whole of the District Court’s judgment, the\n                    JHC was able to decide the First Indonesian Appeal on the basis only of the\n                    court record and the documents tendered by the parties before the District\n                    Court. 18     The Bank filed its application for an\n                    anti-suit injunction in Singapore on 9 October 2009, having informed the\n                    court two days earlier that it intended to do so. The hearing of the application\n                    took place on 18 November 2009 and the parties subsequently filed several\n                    sets of supplementary written submissions. The final set of submissions was put\n                    in by Beckkett on 4 December 2009. 19     The JHC released its decision on the First\n                    Indonesian Appeal on 12 January 2010. The appeal was unsuccessful. On or\n                    about 26 January 2010, however, Beckkett lodged an appeal (the\n                    “Second Indonesian Appeal”) against this decision to the Supreme\n                    Court of Indonesia. As at the date of writing, no decision has been rendered on\n                    the Second Indonesian Appeal. 20     For completeness, I reiterate what happened\n                    thereafter. On 12 February 2010, the AR ordered Beckkett to elect between\n                    the legal proceedings in Singapore and Indonesia. On 26 February 2010,\n                    Beckkett elected to pursue its claims and remedies in Indonesia. It did not file\n                    an appeal against the AR’s decision. On 4 March 2010, the Bank lodged\n                    the present appeal.",
        "Issues": "21     Since Beckkett has not appealed against the\n                    decision of the AR, it is in no position to challenge any of the holdings that\n                    he made. Thus, any issue that the AR decided in favour of the Bank and against\n                    Beckkett cannot be re-litigated in this appeal. The main issue to be decided on\n                    the appeal, therefore, is whether in all the circumstances, including his\n                    findings, it was the right course for the AR to put Beckkett to an election\n                    instead of issuing an anti-suit injunction against Beckkett. There are some\n                    sub-issues to be considered in this connection but before I deal with the issues\n                    on appeal, it may be useful to revisit the AR’s findings.",
        "The decision below": "22     The issues that arose before the AR were the\n                    following: (a)     Whether there was duplication in the\n                        Singapore and Indonesian proceedings. (b)     Whether the Bank went before the court “with clean\n                        hands”. (c)     Whether the requirements for an anti-suit injunction were\n                    met. (d)     Whether the\n                        court ought to put Beckkett to an election. I am not\n                    going to repeat the arguments that the parties made before the AR in relation to\n                    these issues but I will set out his findings and reasons, indicating where these\n                    need to be revisited in the context of the appeal. 23     On the first issue, that of duplication, the\n                    AR rejected Beckkett’s submission that there were different causes of\n                    action in Singapore and in Indonesia and therefore the two sets of proceedings\n                    were distinct. The AR considered that the fundamental point was that the reliefs\n                    sought in both jurisdictionsvis-à-visthe return\n                    of the Pledged Shares were essentially the same and that both sets of\n                    proceedings had identical features including the reliance on alleged failure to\n                    comply with certain articles of the Indonesian Civil Code. He found that the\n                    situation went beyond multiplicity of proceedings and was a duplication of\n                    proceedings because in both jurisdictions the reliefs sought were the same, the\n                    parties were the same, the underlying bases for the causes of action were the\n                    same and the underlying transaction was the same. 24     It should be noted that the AR’s opinion\n                    was that “[w]hile Beckkett may not be faulted in commencing the action in\n                    Indonesia while it was waiting for the Singapore Court of Appeal’s\n                    judgment ... once the Singapore Court of Appeal’s judgment was rendered,\n                    or once a reasonable period of time thereafter had lapsed ... Beckkett’s\n                    justification for maintaining the Indonesian action out of prudence\n                    evaporated”. My view on this is different but I will explain\n                    later. 25     The AR rejected Beckkett’s submission\n                    that the Bank had failed to come to the court with clean hands. In this\n                    connection he held: (a)     The argument, made with reference to\n                        a certain submission in the Bank’s Appellant’s Case for the\n                        appeals before the Singapore Court of Appeal, that the Bank had been blowing\n                        hot and cold and had challenged Beckkett to bring a suit in Indonesia, was\n                        misplaced. The Bank’s submission had to be read in its proper context\n                        and since the Bank had defended the claim in Singapore all the way to the\n                        Court of Appeal, it was a leap of logic to suggest that some few sentences\n                        in its submission were in effect an open challenge to Beckkett to bring a\n                        suit in Indonesia. (b)     The argument that the Bank’s failure to challenge the District\n                        Court’s finding on jurisdiction by failing to appeal against the\n                        rejection of its Absolute Competency Exception application should be held\n                        against it when it sought the equitable relief of an anti-suit injunction in\n                        Singapore initially appeared an attractive one to the AR. He rejected it\n                        because he considered that a reasonable litigant in the Bank’s\n                        position had two options when its application was rejected: either to appeal\n                        on jurisdiction or to defend the main action. The Bank in deciding not to\n                        appeal may have been prompted by an interest in seeing a speedy resolution\n                        of the Indonesian action. (c)     The argument that the Bank had waived its right to an\n                        election was rejected. The AR considered that the authorities cited by\n                        Beckkett were of doubtful value for the proposition that the Bank’s\n                        conduct amounted to a waiver and, in any case, his view was that the\n                        Bank’s conduct in defending the action on the merits in Indonesia was\n                        reasonable. (d)     Looking at the conduct of the parties as a whole, while there may be have\n                        been some delay on the part of the Bank in bringing the application for an\n                        anti-suit injunction, that delay did not imbue the application with the lack\n                        ofbona fides. It was not such a significant\n                        delay as to enable the court to reasonably impute a level of mischief or bad\n                        faith to the Bank. 26     Next, the AR dealt with the legal requirements\n                    for an anti-suit injunction. He based his analysis on the framework set out inJohn Reginald Stott Kirkham and others v Trane US Inc and\n                        others[2009] 4 SLR(R) 428 (“Kirkham”) in relation to the principles to be applied\n                    when considering whether to grant an anti-suit injunction. Using this framework,\n                    he found: (a)     That the parties were amenable to\n                        the Singapore courts’ jurisdiction since they had been actively\n                        engaged in this litigation before the courts for no less than five\n                        years. (b)     That at\n                        that point in time (iethe time at which the\n                        anti-suit injunction was being considered), Singapore rather than Indonesia\n                        was the natural forum for the dispute because: (i)       The parties had more than\n                            five years of litigation in Singapore as opposed to less than one year\n                            of litigation in Indonesia. (ii)       The parties were continuing to litigate in\n                            Singapore. (c)     The Bank had established aprima faciecase that Beckkett’s conduct had been vexatious and oppressive. When\n                        Beckkett first commenced the Indonesian action, since the Court of Appeal\n                        had not delivered judgment, Beckkett’s conduct was not vexatious or\n                        oppressive because it did not know what the outcome of the Singapore action\n                        would be. However, the situation changed when the Singapore Court of Appeal\n                        judgment was rendered because it dismissed Beckkett’s claim for a\n                        return of the Pledged Shares and ordered a remedy of damages only. It then\n                        became vexatious and oppressive on the part of Beckkett to maintain the\n                        Indonesian action concurrently in the hope of getting the Pledged Shares\n                        back. In this connection, the following passage from the AR’s judgment\n                        is of special interest: 108    ... I am of the view that part of the\n                                Court’s protection of its jurisdiction, processes and\n                                judgments, as well as its preservation of the principle of finality\n                                requires a finding that Beckkett’s persistence in both\n                                jurisdictionsafterthe Singapore\n                                Court of Appeal’s judgment was rendered, is vexatious and\n                                oppressive. Quite simply, the Singapore Court of Appeal had\n                                dismissed Beckkett’s claim for a return of the Pledged Shares.\n                                To condone Beckkett’s persistence in the Indonesian\n                                proceedings without any sanction runs the risk that Beckkett may end\n                                up with a remedy that is inconsistent with the finding of the\n                                Singapore Court of Appeal. That would erode the sanctity to be found\n                                in the principle of finality, and may even send a wrong signal to\n                                future litigants that a Singapore Court of Appeal judgment is not\n                                worth much if one has sufficiently deep pockets to pursue another\n                                remedy in a foreign (and probably more favourable) jurisdiction\n                                after exhausting all avenues in Singapore and failing here.\n                                (emphasis in original) (d)     Nevertheless,\n                        Beckkett had discharged the burden on it to demonstrate that it would be\n                        unjust to Beckkett to grant an anti-suit injunction. Beckkett had propounded\n                        a correct principle of law in arguing that it was entitled to elect the\n                        remedy it wanted for the Bank’s breach only at the point of\n                        enforcement. To order an injunction now would be tantamount to staying the\n                        Indonesian proceedings and this may in turn rob Beckkett of the fruits of\n                        its labour in the Indonesian proceedings. Since Beckkett could not be\n                        faulted for commencing the Indonesian proceedings but could only be faulted\n                        for maintaining them after the decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal, it\n                        would be unjust to grant an anti-suit injunction and rob Beckkett of the\n                        right of a successful appeal in Indonesia. 27     On the issue of whether Beckkett ought to be\n                    put to an election, the AR considered that to let things remain at status quo\n                    would also lead to an unjust result. Beckkett’s submission that\n                    undertakings would be sufficient was rejected since the AR considered them\n                    inadequate to address the potential prejudice, both to the parties as well as to\n                    the sanctity of the principle of finality in the Singapore courts. The\n                    court’s discretion to enjoin a party from proceeding in another\n                    jurisdiction in order to protect the jurisdiction of the local court extended to\n                    an order for an election. In coming to his final conclusion, the AR\n                    stated: 121    ... only an order for a final and irrevocable\n                            election within a reasonable time would allow Beckkett to pursue its\n                            remedies without the added costs to the Bank or to the Courts of both\n                            jurisdictions as a result of Beckkett’s vexatious and oppressive\n                            conduct in persisting with its actions in both Indonesia and Singapore.\n                            While Beckkett may have demonstrated that it would be unjust for an\n                            anti-suit injunction to be granted, it cannot evade from the reality\n                            that an order for an election is the just and equitable order to move\n                            the litigation between the parties forward.",
        "Issues on appeal": "28     The basis for this judgment is the AR’s\n                    finding that the Singapore and Indonesian proceedings are concurrent and\n                    duplicate proceedings. I have no reservations about the correctness of that\n                    finding. 29     The authorities show that if duplicate\n                    proceedings are conducted concurrently in two different courts or two different\n                    jurisdictions by a plaintiff, that plaintiff bears the burden of justifying the\n                    continuance of the concurrent proceedings. SeeAustralian\n                        Commercial Research and Development Ltd v ANZ McCaughan Merchant Bank\n                        Ltd[1989] 3 All ER 65 at 70 andYusen Air & Sea Service (S) Pte Ltd v KLM Royal Dutch\n                        Airlines[1999] 2 SLR(R) 955 (“Yusen”) at [27]. In this case, the AR has found\n                    that Beckkett was not able to justify the continuance of both the Singapore and\n                    the Indonesian proceedings. That finding stands and I have no quarrel with\n                    it. 30     InMulti-Code Electronics\n                        Industries (M) Bhd and another v Toh Chun Toh Gordon and others[2009] 1 SLR(R) 1000, Chan Seng Onn J endorsed the legal\n                    principles contained in para 933 ofHalsbury’s\n                        Laws of Englandvol 37 (Butterworths LexisNexis, 4th Ed\n                    Reissue, 2001) as to the options available to the court when there are\n                    concurrent and vexatious proceedings in two different jurisdictions. These\n                    are: (a)     to require the plaintiff to elect\n                        which set of proceedings he wishes to continue; or (b)     to stay the local proceedings;\n                        or (c)     to grant an\n                        anti-suit injunction restraining the plaintiff from pursuing the foreign\n                        proceedings. 31     In this context it is also pertinent to bear\n                    in mind the following observations of the Court of Appeal inYusen: 27    In our judgment, when a plaintiff sues the same\n                            defendant in two or more different jurisdictions over the same subject\n                            matter, the defendant can take up an application to compel the plaintiff\n                            to make an election as to which set of proceedings he wishes to pursue.\n                            For the purposes of an election, the considerations offorum conveniensdo not come into play. However,\n                            the defendant would need to demonstrate a duplicity of actions in the\n                            different jurisdictions. Once this is established, the burden of proof\n                            then shifts to the plaintiff to justify the continuance of the\n                            concurrent proceedings by showing ‘very unusual\n                            circumstances’. If the plaintiff fails to demonstrate such unusual\n                            circumstances, he would have to make an election. ... 34    It is also our considered view that the\n                            plaintiff’s election is not the only way to resolve this issue.\n                            Apart from compelling the plaintiff to elect, it remains open to the\n                            defendant to take up an application for a stay of local proceedings or a\n                            restraint of foreign proceedings if the defendant wishes to have the\n                            action tried in one of the jurisdictions where the plaintiff has\n                            commenced an action. 32     The issue that falls squarely to be decided by\n                    me is whether in all the circumstances of this case it served the ends of\n                    justice to allow Beckkett to make an election rather than to compel Beckkett to\n                    drop the Indonesian action and continue only with the present action by\n                    proceeding with the assessment of damages. To answer this question, I will first\n                    consider the extent of Beckkett’s vexatious conduct. 33     It would be recalled that the AR’s\n                    finding was that Beckkett’s maintenance of the Indonesian action only\n                    became vexatious when it failed to discontinue the same after the Singapore\n                    Court of Appeal delivered its judgment. His three reasons (at [106] to [110] of\n                    his judgment) for that finding were that: (a)     The prejudice to both parties in\n                        pursuing concurrent proceedings was not capable of compensation by any order\n                        of costs. (b)     The\n                        concurrent proceedings threatened the court’s jurisdiction, processes\n                        and judgments, as well as the principle of finality. (c)     If both sets of proceedings were\n                        allowed to continue abreast, the inevitable risk was that one set of\n                        judicial resources would be wasted. 34     The AR placed a great deal of emphasis on the\n                    threat to the court’s jurisdiction, processes and judgments, as can be\n                    seen from his repetition of this point in more than one place in his decision.\n                    That that emphasis was well placed is indicated byDicey,\n                        Morris and Collins on The Conflict of Laws(Sir Lawrence Collins\n                    gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) (“Dicey\n                        & Morris”) at [12-069] to [12-074]. In its discussion\n                    at [12-070],Dicey & Morrisstates that the\n                    English court will restrain proceedings which interfere with its due process or\n                    with its jurisdiction to decide cases pending before it and, at [12-073], also\n                    proceedings which interfere with or undermine the control of the English court\n                    of its own process. The point was further emphasised byMasri\n                        v Consolidated Contractors (UK) Ltd & Ors (No 3)(“Masri”), an authority also\n                    relied upon by the AR. Several passages from the judgment of Lawrence\n                    Collins LJ bear citing: 82    I do not accept the judgment debtors’\n                            argument that there is a principle ... that the English court will not\n                            restrain relitigation abroad of a claim which has already been the\n                            subject of an English judgment adverse to the person seeking relitigate\n                            abroad. It has been established since at least 1837 that the fact that\n                            the respondent is seeking to relitigate in a foreign jurisdiction\n                            matters which are already res judicata between himself and the applicant\n                            by reason of an English judgment can be sufficient ground for the grant\n                            of an anti-suit injunction. Protection of the jurisdiction 83    InBank of Tokyo Ltd v Karoon\n                                (Note)[1987] AC 45, 63, Robert Goff LJ\n                            referred to the public interest in the finality of litigation, and said\n                            that there were authorities in England and the United States in which\n                            courts had granted injunctions restraining persons properly amenable to\n                            their jurisdiction from relitigating matters which had already been the\n                            subject of a judgment of the court of the forum ... ... 85    ... I doubt whether it is profitable to do more\n                            than note that the protection of the jurisdiction of the English court\n                            and its judgments by injunction has a long lineage. In my judgment there\n                            is no reason to doubt that in appropriate cases the English court may\n                            enjoin a foreign defendant against whom there is an English judgment (in\n                            proceedings to which the foreign defendant has submitted) from seeking\n                            to relitigate the same issues abroad. ... 100    ... It is consistent with principle for an English\n                            court to restrain relitigation abroad of a claim which has already been\n                            subject of an English judgment. There is long-established authority that\n                            protection of the jurisdiction of the English court, its process and its\n                            judgments by injunction is a legitimate ground for the grant of an\n                            anti-suit injunction. 35     The above passages were cited by the AR as\n                    well. Whilst he realised that they highlighted the importance of finality in\n                    legal proceedings and the need for the court to protect its own jurisdiction,\n                    processes and judgments, he did not perhaps fully appreciate the impact that\n                    these statements of the law should have had on his assessment of the vexatious\n                    conduct of Beckkett. The situation here was that Beckkett had commenced a claim\n                    in Singapore against the Bank and had taken the matter to a long trial, after a\n                    number of interlocutory applications. It had succeeded, to an extent, against\n                    the Bank at first instance but not sufficiently in that it was given only a\n                    nominal remedy. It had therefore appealed and had followed the appeal through\n                    fully until all that was left to do was to await the decision of the Court of\n                    Appeal. It was at that stage that Beckkett started the Indonesian action and, in\n                    my judgment, commenced its course of vexatious conduct. Beckkett was uncertain\n                    of the relief that it would get from the Court of Appeal and therefore sought to\n                    secure its position by seeking the same relief from the Indonesian courts. If\n                    Beckkett indeed got the relief it prayed for in Indonesia before the Court of\n                    Appeal’s judgment was given, that must have threatened the jurisdiction,\n                    processes and judgments of the Singapore courts and undermined the principle of\n                    finality. There would have been an immense waste of judicial resources in\n                    Singapore. Quite apart from the length of the High Court and Court of Appeal\n                    decisions and the time spent by the respective courts considering and weighing\n                    the evidence, the submissions and the law, there were five years of extremely\n                    contentious litigation involving the courts at all levels. 36     When Beckkett started the Indonesian action,\n                    the Bank had two options: to contest the jurisdiction of the Indonesian court\n                    and to apply for an anti-suit injunction. These were not mutually exclusive\n                    options. The Bank could have done both at the same time. Instead, it chose the\n                    first option and when this failed, it engaged Beckkett on the merits. It does\n                    not seem to have occurred to the Bank at any time prior to the result of the\n                    First Indonesian Appeal that it could have applied for an anti-suit injunction\n                    in Singapore. While it may seem immaterial at this stage, my view of the\n                    situation is that the Bank had a very strong chance of succeeding in such an\n                    application had it been brought shortly after the Indonesian action was started.\n                    What is material now is whether the Bank’s failure to apply earlier and\n                    its decision to participate in the Indonesian action should prejudice the\n                    strength of its case now. 37     The AR considered this issue as being one of\n                    “clean hands”. He resolved it in favour of the Bank. Primarily,\n                    the AR considered that the Bank had acted reasonably in contesting the\n                    Indonesian action on the merits. Whilst Beckkett, having not appealed the\n                    AR’s decision, cannot now challenge that judgment in relation to the\n                    determination that its conduct was vexatious, it can still rely on the\n                    Bank’s conduct to support the remedy of election and to contend that such\n                    participation bars the Bank from asking for an anti-suit\n                injunction. 38     In relation to the doctrine of clean hands,\n                    ICF Spry,The Principles of Equitable Remedies(Sweet & Maxwell. 7th Ed, 2007) states at p 409: It is not uncommon to find broad statements that a plaintiff is not\n                        granted an injunction if he does not have clean hands. Properly understood\n                        these statements are correct; but they should be applied cautiously, for it\n                        is by no means true that a plaintiff who has acted unconscionably is refused\n                        all access to the court or that he is considered to be beyond protection for\n                        all purposes. ... It has been said that the principle on which the court\n                        acts is that protection is denied the plaintiff “where the right\n                        relied on, and which the court of equity is asked to protect or assist, is\n                        itself to some extent brought into existence or induced by some illegal or\n                        unconscionable conduct of the plaintiff”, so that protection for what\n                        he claims involves protection for his own wrong: “No court of equity\n                        will aid a man to derive advantage from his own wrong, and this is really\n                        the meaning of the maxim.” Also interesting is the footnote to the last sentence, which\n                    reads: Meyers v Casey(1913) 17 CLR 90 at\n                        p 124. Isaacs J was not, however, considering cases where the\n                        court had been deceived orits procedure otherwise\n                            abused. In these cases also relief is said to be refused because the\n                            plaintiff does not have clean hands. So inArmstrong v Sheppard & Short Ltd[1959]\n                        2 QB 384 at p 397 ground for refusing an injunction was found\n                        in an attempt to mislead the court. See alsoCarmen v Fox\n                            Film Corporation(1920) 269 F 928 (US). (emphasis\n                        added) 39     The Bank explained that it had participated in\n                    the Indonesian action because at the time the District Court rejected its\n                    challenge to the jurisdiction, the Court of Appeal had not given its decision\n                    whereas the Judge had found that the sale had been carried out by unlawful means\n                    under Indonesian law. Having decided not to appeal in Indonesia, the Bank had to\n                    contest the Indonesian action to prevent default judgment from being entered\n                    against it. While I can understand the Bank taking protective action to avoid a\n                    default judgment, what I do not understand and what the Bank did not explain,\n                    was why it did not at the same time apply in Singapore for an anti-suit\n                    injunction against Beckkett. To participate substantively in the Indonesian\n                    action which threatened to undermine the process of the Singapore courts without\n                    making any attempt in Singapore to stop Beckkett’s prosecution of such\n                    proceedings was, to my mind, wrongful conduct on the part of the Bank and, in a\n                    normal case, would prejudice its application for an anti-suit\n                injunction. 40     In this case, however, the fact that the Bank\n                    participated in the foreign proceedings cannotipso\n                        factomean that its application for an anti-suit injunction must\n                    be rejected. This is because a denial of the anti-suit injunction would also\n                    have the effect of perpetuating the wrong instigated by Beckkettiethe vexatious and oppressive Indonesian action that\n                    was started after Beckkett had had a full trial of its claim in Singapore and\n                    presented its appeal. In my view, while it is always vexatious for a plaintiff\n                    to start concurrent proceedings in different jurisdictions against the same\n                    defendant for the same reliefs arising out of the same cause of action, the\n                    present case is particularly egregious because of the stage that the proceedings\n                    in Singapore had reached when the Indonesian action was started. 41     The court in deciding whether to grant an\n                    anti-suit injunction must always have regard to what the ends of justice\n                    require. This means that the court must consider not only the injustice to the\n                    defendant if the plaintiff is allowed to pursue the foreign proceedings but also\n                    the injustice to the plaintiff if he is not allowed to do so. SeeSociété Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale Appellants v Lee Kui\n                        JAK and Another Respondents[1987] AC 871\n                        (“Lee Kui Jak”) at 896. The AR\n                    was concerned that by granting the anti-suit injunction he would be robbing\n                    Beckkett of the “fruits of the labour” (at [112] of his judgment)\n                    it had put into the Indonesian action. In other words, the advantage which an\n                    anti-suit injunction would have deprived Beckkett of was the stage and\n                    development of those proceedings which had been reached by the effort that\n                    Beckkett had made. With due respect to the AR, however, I do not think that the\n                    stage of the Indonesian action is a legitimate advantage of which Beckkett\n                    cannot be deprived. 42     Beckkett had no business starting the\n                    Indonesian action in the first place. This is precisely the sort of action that\n                    the principles inMasriprohibit. Beckkett had\n                    submitted its claim to the courts of Singapore and had laboured long and hard\n                    (and caused the Bank to do so too) to bring it to trial and then before the\n                    appellate court. It did not know how the appellate court would decide but that\n                    was no excuse for it to attempt to bypass a possibly unfavourable decision of\n                    the Singapore courts by taking action in Indonesia. In my view, it was an abuse\n                    of the process of the Singapore courts for Beckkett to take steps in Indonesia\n                    and no legitimate advantage could be obtained from the same notwithstanding that\n                    the Bank participated in the action. At present, although the proceedings in\n                    Indonesia have also gone to the appeal stage, they are not as advanced as in\n                    Singapore where the Court of Appeal has already given judgment and only the\n                    damages need to be assessed. 43     By allowing Beckkett to elect to proceed in\n                    Indonesia, the AR was giving Beckkett exactly what it wanted when it started the\n                    Indonesian actioniea second attempt to recover\n                    the Pledged Shares. Beckkett has by its actions undermined the processes of the\n                    Singapore courts and the principle of finality of litigation. In my view, it\n                    would not be right for this court to allow its judgments to be ignored by\n                    litigants who have sought the aid of this court by starting their litigation\n                    here. The ends of justice, not only for Beckkett and the Bank, but also for\n                    other litigants who litigate in good faith in the Singapore courts, can only be\n                    served by the grant of an anti-suit injunction in circumstances such as the\n                    present. 44     The last matter to be considered is whether\n                    considerations of comity should inhibit the grant of an anti-suit injunction. It\n                    has been held inRoyal Bank of Canada v Cooperatieve Centrale\n                        Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA[2004] 2 All\n                    ER (Comm) 847 at [50] that: considerations of comity grow in importance the longer the foreign suit\n                        continues and the more the parties and the judge have engaged in its conduct\n                        and management. 45     Given the advanced stage of the Indonesian\n                    action, considerations of comity take on importance. However, those\n                    considerations must be weighed against the public policy of the Singapore legal\n                    system. In the case ofQ & M Enterprises Sdn Bhd v Poh\n                        Kiat[2005] 4 SLR(R) 494, Andrew Phang JC stated\n                    at [25]: The importance of international comity cannot be underestimated. The\n                        domestic courts of each country must constantly remind themselves of this\n                        point ... Nevertheless, it ought to be emphasised that the signal importance\n                        of the domestic legal system cannot be gainsaid either. Extreme positions on\n                        either side of the legal spectrum ought to be avoided. For example,\n                        international comity oughtnotto be accorded\n                        if to do so would offend the public policy of the domestic legal system\n                        (here, of Singapore). However, that having been said, legal parochialism\n                        must also be eschewed. (emphasis in original) 46     In the present case, refusing the anti-suit\n                    injunction because of international comity would offend the public policy of the\n                    Singapore legal system. It cannot be acceptable to our public policy to permit a\n                    litigant to begin a duplicate law suit in a foreign jurisdiction just after\n                    being heard by the Court of Appeal. I would go so far as to say that it cannot\n                    be acceptable to permit the start of such a duplicate law suit after the\n                    completion of a full trial in Singapore, even though judgment may have been\n                    reserved and not yet delivered.",
