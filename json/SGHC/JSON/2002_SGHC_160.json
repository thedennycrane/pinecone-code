        "ANTECEDENTS": "19 The Accused had no previous criminal record.THE PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE20 The Prosecution submitted that this case called for\n\n\"a severe sentence to show the Court’s abhorrence of the nefarious deeds of the\n\nAccused\". The 30 year old Accused had defrauded over a thousand persons, most of whom\n\nwere foreign workers, of some S$8.7 million of their hard-earned money. The money was\n\ntaken by him \"purely to sustain his hedonistic lifestyle and gambling habit\".\n\nThe amount recovered by the investigators meant that the victims would receive only about\n\nten cents for every dollar lost. The crimes were committed with premeditation and over\n\nsome seven months. The Accused had also taken steps to avoid detection of his fraudulent\n\nconduct.21 Five victim impact statements were tendered. In these\n\nstatements, the foreign workers involved spoke about families in need waiting for the\n\nmoney that should have been remitted to take care of medical, housing, educational and\n\nother family expenses. Some of the workers received their salaries once a year according\n\nto their contracts and had therefore lost a whole year’s wages.22 Various cases decided here and elsewhere were\n\ncited for my guidance. The Gemini Chit Fund case in 1973, described by Choor Singh J as\n\nthe \"swindle of the century\", was one of them. There Abdul Gaffar Mohamed\n\nIbrahim, the Managing Director of Gemini Chit Fund Corporation Ltd, pleaded guilty to\n\nthree charges of criminal breach of trust of S$3.2 million under section 409 Penal Code\n\nand was sentenced to life imprisonment. There were 40 to 50 thousand members of the public\n\nparticipating in the chit fund and the loss was estimated at S$50 million.23 The Prosecution in the present case argued that the\n\nAccused should receive in total more than the maximum that the District Court may impose\n\nin any one case, that is, 14 years imprisonment. That was the reason for invoking section\n\n186(2) Criminal Procedure Code to have this case transferred to the High Court. I was\n\nurged to order more than two of the imprisonment terms to run consecutively as there is no\n\nrule precluding the Court from making such an order (seeMaideen Pillai v PP[1996] 1 SLR 161). The Prosecution left it to the Court to decide what the aggregate term\n\nof imprisonment ought to be.",
        "THE MITIGATION": "24 The two notes that the Accused left for his family\n\nbefore he fled the country showed the pain, shame and remorse that he felt. Having made\n\ngood his escape, he returned soon thereafter on his own volition after speaking to his\n\nfamily and surrendered himself. He was forthright and complete in his disclosure of all\n\nhis transactions and gave the investigators the relevant documents and the identities of\n\nthe persons involved.25 The Accused pleaded guilty at the first available\n\nopportunity and admitted all the other charges taken into consideration. He was also a\n\nfirst offender.26 He did not set out to misappropriate the\n\nworkers’ money from the beginning. When his gambling became a \"desperate\n\ncompulsion\" and he sunk deeper in debts and ran out of people to borrow money from,\n\nhe decided to \"borrow\" money from Wen Long’s customers by the roll-over\n\nscheme described earlier.27 The Accused also surrendered four insurance polices\n\nbefore their maturity dates for S$26,032.80 to help pay back the victims. He \"had not\n\nsquirreled away any money for later use or concealed any part of it\".28 I was urged not to pass a crushing sentence\n\nthereby depriving him of all hope.",
        "THE SENTENCES": "29 Before I sentenced the Accused, I said the following\n\n:\"1. I begin by repeating what Chan Sek Keong J said\n\n  inWong Kai Chuen Philip v PP[1991] 1 MLJ 321at 323, that \"in an offence\n\n  like criminal breach of trust, it is a matter of common sense that, all other things being\n\n  equal, the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated the greater the culpability of\n\n  the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court.\" The Accused here\n\n  embezzled some $8.768 million within three months. The total amount involved in all the\n\n  charges (ie those proceeded with and those taken into consideration for the purpose of\n\n  sentence) is not the largest in the history of financial crime but it is nonetheless a\n\n  very substantial sum. So far, approximately $905,000 have been recovered, constituting\n\n  only slightly more than 10% of the total loss.2. This is not even a case of an offender coming across a huge sum of\n\n  money by chance or in the course of his work and, being in dire need, not being able to\n\n  resist the temptation to help himself to some of it. The Accused here unleashed an\n\n  unscrupulous scheme on the unsuspecting foreign workers by offering unrealistically high\n\n  exchange rates to create an unceasing stream of cash to feed his unmanageable gambling\n\n  addiction and his uncontrollable avarice while taking pains to ensure that his misdeeds\n\n  remain undetected. He was the writer, director and lead actor in this unmitigated tragedy.\n\n  How do we sympathize with him? Let us not count the ways because there is none.3. The Accused’s criminal conduct has claimed more than a thousand\n\n  victims. These are people who have come to our country to work and to earn an honest\n\n  living for themselves and for those they care for in their homeland. While they laboured,\n\n  the Accused plundered, what they painstakingly gathered, he wantonly scattered, what they\n\n  saved, he squandered. These workers’ anguish is all the more severe as the money they\n\n  lost represents, for some of them, a whole year’s wages and is badly needed by their\n\n  dependants. The consequences of his crimes are far-reaching and adversely affect a great\n\n  number of people.4. The Accused has also done a great disservice to our country. A\n\n  country’s reputation may be soiled when its locals take dishonestly the spoils of the\n\n  foreigners’ toils.5. The Accused has pleaded guilty and has saved time and expense but as\n\n  I have said inPP v Teo Cheng Kiat[Criminal Case 42 of 2000], such a plea in the\n\n  face of overwhelming documentary evidence does not carry the same weight it would have in\n\n  cases which may be more difficult for the Prosecution to prove. The Accused is also a\n\n  first offender only in the sense that he was not caught and convicted earlier for the many\n\n  incidents of misappropriation of the workers’ funds and, like Teo Cheng Kiat,\n\n  \"he has set a dubious record in the criminal annals upon his dramatic first\n\n  entry\". He did flee the country when he realized that his arrest was imminent but, to\n\n  his and his family’s credit, he returned voluntarily soon thereafter, surrendered\n\n  himself and admitted his wrongdoings to the police. He also assisted the authorities in\n\n  their investigations.6. When Choor Singh J sentenced Abdul Gaffar Mohamed Ibrahim in the\n\n  Gemini Chit Fund case in 1973 to life imprisonment for criminal breach of trust, that\n\n  effectively meant a maximum sentence of 20 years. SinceAbdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v\n\n  PP[1997] 3 SLR 643, life imprisonment means incarceration for the remaining natural\n\n  life of the prisoner. The $3.2 million involved in the Gemini Chit Fund case 30 years ago\n\n  would obviously be equivalent to a much higher amount today. The loss was estimated to be\n\n  around $50 million then in any event. The number of victims there was also considerably\n\n  higher. Until this spate of offences, the Accused had no criminal record. Whether his case\n\n  will be regarded as the \"swindle of the (new) century\" remains to be seen but I\n\n  do not think any arguments for the maximum sentence here would be too compelling and,\n\n  indeed, the Prosecution has not suggested that life imprisonment would be appropriate\n\n  here.7. A good analogy to this case isTeo Cheng Kiat’scase\n\n  which concerns criminal breach of trust under section 408 Penal Code, a provision which\n\n  carries a maximum imprisonment term of seven years to which a fine may be added. There, I\n\n  sentenced Teo to six years imprisonment in respect of each of the ten charges proceeded\n\n  with and ordered four of the sentences to run consecutively, making a total of 24 years\n\n  imprisonment. I note of course that the total amount involved in that case was about $35\n\n  million (of which some $21 million were recovered) and that the defalcation there covered\n\n  a 13 year span. There was however only one corporate victim involved and its financial\n\n  soundness was not adversely affected.8. What really matters in cases of multiple charges such as this is the\n\n  aggregate term of imprisonment derived from the number of consecutive sentences. In view\n\n  of the many victims here, it is appropriate to order more than two imprisonment terms to\n\n  run consecutively. In the circumstances, I sentence Mr Lam Chen Fong to seven years\n\n  imprisonment in respect of each of the section 409 Penal Code charges, three years\n\n  imprisonment on the charge under section 47(1)(b) Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other\n\n  Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act and one year imprisonment on the charge\n\n  under section 214 Penal Code. Three of the sentences for the section 409 charges and the\n\n  one year imprisonment term for the section 214 charge are to run consecutively with effect\n\n  from 29 January 2002 while the rest of the sentences are to run concurrently with them,\n\n  making an aggregate sentence of 22 years imprisonment.\"Sgd:TAY YONG KWANGJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
