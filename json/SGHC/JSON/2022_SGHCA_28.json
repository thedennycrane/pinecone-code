        "Introduction": "1 On 12 April 2022, the appellants in the main appeal in AD/CA 39/2022 (“CA 39”) filed a Notice of Appeal (“NA 39”) against the “whole of the decision” of the High Court Judge (the “Judge”) “given on 16-03-2022” in HC/S 1044/2018 and HC/S 1307/2018 respectively (collectively, the “Suits”). On 22 April 2022, the respondents in CA 39 filed the present AD/SUM 15/2022 (“SUM 15”) to strike out NA 39. To avoid confusion, we refer to the parties who filed SUM 15 collectively as the “Customers” and the parties opposing SUM 15 collectively as the “Companies” in this judgment. 2 Having considered the parties’ submissions, we allow the application in SUM 15 and accordingly strike out NA 39. These are our reasons for doing so.",
        "Background facts": "3 The Customers were holiday makers who were travelling from Genting Highlands back to Singapore on 31 August 2016. They were on board a double decker luxury coach (the “Bus”). En route to Singapore, the Bus was involved in a road accident. The Customers sustained injuries and filed an action to claim damages. The Companies are incorporated in Singapore and were found to have undertaken to transport the Customers from Singapore to Genting Highlands and back, by bus, under the relevant contracts and to do so with reasonable care. 4 On 24 February 2022, the Judge gave interlocutory judgment on liability in favour of the Customers with damages to be assessed (including damages in relation to the Companies’ contractual liability to all the Customers for failing to provide the transportation service with reasonable care) and costs to be heard separately inRManokaran and others v Chuah Ah Leng and others and another suit[2022] SGHC 39 (the “Main Judgment”). 5 The Judge also directed parties to file submissions on costs by 3 March 2022 by way of correspondence from the Court over eLitigation. Notably, the first paragraph of that correspondence referred to “the Judgment dated 24 February 2022”.1Foot Note 1×Customers’ Supporting Affidavit at pp 9–12 and 15–18.On 28 February 2022, the Customers requested an extension of time of a week to file such submissions which the Judge granted on 1 March 2022.2Foot Note 2×Customers’ Supporting Affidavit at pp 13–15.The Companies filed their submissions on costs on 9 March 2022 and the Customers filed their submissions on the same on 10 March 2022. On 16 March 2022, the Judge made orders on costs and disbursements against the Companies in respect of each of the two Suits by way of correspondence from the Court (the “Costs Orders”). Thereafter, on 17 March 2022, the Judge directed parties to write in by 21 March 2022 “if there are any objections to the Court having made the orders on costs and disbursements by way of the letter dated 16 March 2022”.3Foot Note 3×Customers’ Supporting Affidavit at pp 21–22. 6 On 12 April 2022, the Companies filed NA 39 to this Court stating: Take Notice that an appeal under Order 19 of the Rules of Court 2021 has been filed by the 3rd Defendant (s) in HC/S 1044/2018 and 3rd Defendant(s) in HC/S 1307/2018 to the Appellate Division of the High Court. The appeal is against the whole of the decision of [the Judge] in HC/S 1044/2018 given on 16-03-2022, [the Judge] in HC/S 1307/2018 given on 16-03-2022. 7 The Notice of Appeal before us was not the Companies’ first attempt to file an appeal against the Main Judgment. On 24 March 2022, counsel for the Companies first attempted to file a purported “appeal”. However, this was filed under “All Other Summons” in the underlying casefile. Counsel for the Companies was informed that there were two issues with such a filing. First, nothing on the face of that document stated that it was an appeal and it did not comply with the relevant form applicable then for a notice of appeal. Second, the document was filed in the underlying casefile. Accordingly, that filing was rejected by the General Division of the High Court. 8 On 25 March 2022, the Companies filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal.4Foot Note 4×Customers’ Supporting Affidavit at p 147.That was also procedurally deficient for three reasons. First, it was filed out of time as 24 March 2022 was the last day for filing an appeal. However, when filing the Notice of Appeal, counsel for the Companies indicated that an extension of time was not required. Second, it was filed to the Court of Appeal instead of the Appellate Division of the High Court. Third, there was no accompanying Certificate for Security for Costs. 9 On 29 and 30 March 2022, the Registry of the Supreme Court attempted to contact counsel for the Companies on his mobile line and office line but to no avail. He, however, did write in on 29 March 2022 (again, in the underlying casefile) to inquire about the filing of the Notice of Appeal. On 30 March 2022, the Registry responded, asking counsel for the Companies to confirm whether the Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal was filed out of time as that appeared to be the case. On 31 March 2022, he wrote to the Registry, stating that the appeal was “not out of time”.5Foot Note 5×Customers’ Supporting Affidavit at pp 147 and 148. 10 In those circumstances, an Assistant Registrar (“AR”) convened an urgent case management conference (“CMC”) on the matter on 4 April 2022. However, counsel for the Companies was absent as neither he nor his staff allegedly had notice of the CMC. The CMC was thus refixed to 7 April 2022. At the CMC on 7 April 2022, the AR set out the background which led to the CMC and the issues faced by the initial filing on 24 March 2022 as well as the subsequent filing on 25 March 2022 which we have mentioned at [7] and [8] above. The AR said that the Notice of Appeal would be rejected due to numerous deficiencies. The AR also mentioned that counsel for the Companies ought to consider whether an application for an extension of time to appeal should be filed. The Customers had indicated they might apply to strike out the appeal, if he sought to file an appeal without an extension of time. Eventually, the Companies filed NA 39 on 12 April 2022 before the Appellate Division of the High Court without seeking an extension of time to do so.",
        "The parties’ cases": "29 The Customers’ position is that NA 39 is a “backdoor appeal” against the Main Judgment as the Companies failed to appeal against the same within the prescribed time.15Foot Note 15×Customers’ Written Submissions at paras 3 and 29.Under both the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (the “Revoked ROC”) and the Rules of Court 2021, the applicable timeline for the filing of appeals is that such appeal is to be “filed and served within one month after” the “date on which the judgment or order appealed against waspronounced” [emphasis added].16Foot Note 16×Customers’ Written Submissions at paras 21–22.Accordingly, the Companies should have filed any appeal against the Main Judgment by 24 March 2022; this was not done. Nor have the Companies filed any application for an extension of time to file the same.17Foot Note 17×Customers’ Written Submissions at paras 31–35.The Customers thus submit in the alternative, that even if NA 39 is an appeal against the Main Judgment and the Costs Orders, it should nonetheless be struck out on the basis that the appeal against the Main Judgment was filed out of time.18Foot Note 18×Customers’ Written Submissions at paras 30 and 37. 30 The Companies submit that time for filing the Notice of Appeal “does not start to run until the Judge has heard and determined all matters including costs”.19Foot Note 19×Companies’ Written Submissions at para 20.In support of its submission, the Companies rely on O 19 r 4(1) of the Rules of Court 2021. Since the Judge only determined the issue of costs on 16 March 2022, “time runs from 16th March 2022, for any Notice of Appeal to be filed”.20Foot Note 20×Companies’ Written Submissions at paras 21–24.",
        "Issues to be determined": "13 The first issue that arises before us is whether NA 39 is an appeal against the Costs Ordersonlysuch that permission to appeal is required. If that is so, then it must be struck out as permission has not been obtained. But, if it is against the Main Judgmentin additionto the Costs Orders, then a second issue arises as to whether it is filed out of time.",
        "The decisions appealed against in NA 39": "",
        "Analysis": "31 We disagree with the Companies’ contention. In our view, an appeal against the Main Judgmentought to have been filed within one month from the date on which that judgment was pronounced. Hence, even if the NA 39 purportedly included such an appeal, the Companies were well out of time when they filed the Notice of Appeal on 12 April 2022. 32 Order 56A r 6(d) of the Revoked ROC clearly stipulates that a notice of appeal must be filed and served “within one month after” the “date on which the judgment or order appealed against waspronounced” [emphasis added]. Pertinently, the position remains the same under the applicable rules under the Rules of Court 2021 (see O 1 r 2) which we reproduce: Revocation, transitional provisions and application (O. 1, r. 2) 2.—... ... (3)  Subject to this Rule, these Rules — … (b) apply with the necessary modifications to and in relation to every appeal to … the Appellate Division, … which isfiled on or after 1 April2022,relating to a decision of a lower Court made in proceedings to which the revoked Rules of Court apply… (4) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(b) — (a) subject to sub‑paragraph (b), the notice of appealagainst a judgment or order of the General Division …given or made before 1 April 2022must be filed and served within one month after— … (iv) in any other case —the date on which the judgment or order appealed against was pronounced; … [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 33 The rules of civil procedure are sufficiently clear on the applicable time to file an appeal. A party who wishes to appeal against a decision of a lower Court made in proceedings to which the Revoked ROC applies must, under the Rules of Court 2021, file the notice of appeal within one month after the date on which the judgment or order appealed against was pronounced. In the present circumstances, a notice of appeal againstliabilityshould have undoubtedly been filed and served within one month after the Judge’s judgmenton such liability, which was pronounced on 24 February 2022. 34 The Companies’ reliance on O 19 r 4 of the Rules of Court 2021 is somewhat misplaced and arises from a misunderstanding of the transitional provisions and application of the Rules of Court 2021 as stipulated in O 1 r 2 which we have elaborated in the foregoing paragraphs. In contrast, O 19 r 4(1) of the Rules of Court 2021 provides as follows: When time for appeal starts to run (O. 19, r. 4) 4.—(1)  Unless the Court otherwise orders, the time for the filing of an appeal and for the filing of an application for permission to appeal does not start to run until after the lower Court has heard and determined all matters in the trial, including costs. 35 As clearly stipulated in O 1 r 2(3)(b) of the Rules of Court 2021 (reproduced at [32] above), the relevant time that applies to ajudgment or order madebefore 1 April 2022(such as the Main Judgment and the Costs Orders in the Suits) is one month from the date of such judgment or order. Simply put, although O 19 r 4 of the Rules of Court 2021 came into operation on 1 April 2022 (ie, was in operation by the time NA 39 was filed), it does not apply to appeals against the Judge’s decisions in the present case. Accordingly, the time to appeal against the Main Judgment starts to run from 24 February 2022and not16 March 2022as the Companies contend. 36 Therefore, even if NA 39 was against the Main Judgment in addition to the Costs Orders(as the Companies contend), it was filed out of time. The Companies thus required an extension of time to file the same. As no such extension of time was sought and obtained by the Companies, NA 39 ought to be struck out, even if it were the case – as the Companies contend – that the appeal was againstboththe Main Judgment and the Costs Orders.",
        "The relevant time period for filing an appeal": "28 The foregoing is sufficient to determine SUM 15. For completeness, we address the relevant time period within which one may file an appeal in view of the relatively new Rules of Court 2021 (the “Rules of Court 2021”). This part addresses the second issue which would arise if the Companies’ case was taken at its highest, which is that, NA 39 was against the Main Judgmentin addition tothe Costs Orders.",
        "Conclusion": "37 For the foregoing reasons, we allow SUM 15 and strike out NA 39. 38 The present state of affairs is unsatisfactory because counsel for the Companies failed to appreciate the applicable rules of civil procedure which, in our view, have been clearly set out in the Rules of Court 2021. Furthermore, at the CMC of 7 April 2022, counsel’s attention was brought to the specific point that 24 March 2022 was the last day for filing an appeal against the Main Judgment. Counsel for the Companies was specifically informed to consider whether to seek an extension of time to appeal. Yet he chose not to do so. It seems that this unfortunate state of affairs has arisen because of the intransigence of counsel for the Companies. In the circumstances, we reserve our judgment on costs. Parties are to file and serve written submissions (if any) on costs for SUM 15 and NA 39 within 14 days from the date of our judgment, limited to five pages. Counsel (and solicitors) for the Companies are to also address the question as to why costs should not be borne by him (and/or them) personally. As the Customers have already addressed costs in their earlier submissions, they should clarify within the same deadline whether they are filing and serving any further submission on costs.
