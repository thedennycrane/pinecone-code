        "Introduction and overview": "1 Sometime in September 2001, the City Harvest Church (“CHC”) decided to embark on a project that used popular music for evangelism. In 2002, after a series of concerts in Taiwan and Hong Kong, this project came to be known as “the Crossover”. The Crossover, which was first launched in Asia, involved Ms Ho Yeow Sun, also known by her performing name “Sun Ho”, recording and launching secular music albums in order to reach out to people who might otherwise never step foot into a church to listen to a preacher, and to encourage Christians in the popular music industry to share their conversion stories and testimonies. The theological legitimacy of the Crossover as a means of evangelism is not an issue in this case. 2 Around 2004, a decision was taken within the CHC leadership to expand the Crossover into the market in the United States of America (“the US”). Within a few years after the Crossover’s launch in the US, an award-winning producer, Wyclef Jean (“Wyclef”), was brought on board. Wyclef commanded substantial fees, and his participation, together with the expansion of the Crossover, led to a significant increase in the amount of funding that was necessary. This led to CHC entering into a series of transactions between 2007 and 2009 with a number of entities, namely Xtron Productions Pte Ltd (“Xtron”), PT The First National Glassware (“Firna”) and AMAC Capital Partners (Pte) Ltd (“AMAC”). We will explain the details of these transactions later in this judgment. Pursuant to these transactions, funds were transferred from CHC’s Building Fund (“the BF”) and General Fund (“the GF”) to these entities. 3 In May 2010, the Commercial Affairs Department (“the CAD”) commenced investigations into the affairs of CHC. As a result of the investigations, six persons, Kong Hee, Lam Leng Hung (“John Lam”), Tan Ye Peng (“Ye Peng”), Chew Eng Han (“Eng Han”), Serina Wee Gek Yin (“Serina”) and Tan Shao Yuen Sharon (“Sharon”), were charged with offences of criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) relating to the above-mentioned transactions that occurred between 2007 and 2009. The latter four were also charged with falsifying certain accounts. 4 InPublic Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and others[2015] SGDC 326 (“the Conviction GD”) andPublic Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and others[2015] SGDC 327 (“the Sentencing GD”), the Presiding Judge of the State Courts (“the Judge”) convicted and sentenced the six persons on all the charges preferred against them. The six persons have appealed against their conviction. They have also appealed against the sentences imposed on them on the ground that the sentences are manifestly excessive, whilst the Prosecution has appealed against the respective sentences, arguing that they are manifestly inadequate. Given the various cross-appeals, we will hereinafter refer to the parties simply as the appellants (or by their names individually) and the Prosecution, respectively. 5 We heard these appeals over the course of five days in September 2016. We now give our judgment, which is divided into two parts. In the first part, we deal with the appellants’ appeals against conviction and in the second, we deal with the various appeals against the sentences imposed by the Judge.",
        "Background": "",
        "The appellants": "6 We begin with a brief summary of the six appellants. 7 Kong Hee is the founder and was at the material time a senior pastor of CHC. He was the president of the CHC Management Board (“the CHC Board”) from 1992 to 10 April 2011. He is also Sun Ho’s husband and was the main decision-maker in relation to the Crossover. 8 Ye Peng was at the material time a deputy senior pastor of CHC. He was first appointed to the CHC Board in April 1995, and was elected as the vice president in 2007. 9 John Lam became a member of the CHC Board in 1993 and served as treasurer and secretary at various times. He also sat on CHC’s audit committee (“Audit Committee”) and the investment committee (“Investment Committee”). He was the chairman of the Investment Committee from 5 July 2007 to 1 February 2008. 10 Eng Han became a member of CHC sometime in 1995. He was a member of the CHC Board from 25 April 1999 to 7 July 2007, over which time he held various positions such as vice-president and treasurer. He served on the Investment Committee, which was then known as the finance committee, from 2006 to 2007. Eng Han was also the sole director of AMAC and held 70% of AMAC’s shares. AMAC was registered as a limited private company on 26 April 2007 and operated an investment business. In July 2007, Eng Han resigned from the CHC Board after the CHC Board made a decision to appoint AMAC as CHC’s fund manager. Eng Han left CHC in 2013. 11 Serina joined the accounts department of CHC in August 1999 as an assistant accountant. She rose through the ranks to become CHC’s finance manager sometime in 2005. Serina resigned on 31 August 2007 in order to set up Advante Consulting Pte Ltd (“Advante”) in October 2007. Advante’s business is in providing accounting and corporate secretarial services. In the interim period before Advante was incorporated, Serina provided accounting services to Xtron. Her involvement in the impugned transactions was primarily as an administrator of the Crossover. She also sat on the CHC Board from 17 April 2005 to 7 July 2007. 12 Sharon was never on the CHC Board. She joined CHC’s accounts department on 12 January 2000 as an assistant accountant. She took over as senior accountant after Serina resigned in August 2007 and was subsequently promoted to finance manager sometime in 2008.",
        "The charges": "13 The six appellants were convicted of 43 charges in total. These charges (which are comprehensively set out at [19]–[21] of the Conviction GD) can be broadly characterised into three categories. 14 The first category of charges which the appellants, save for Sharon, were convicted of was referred to by the Judge as the “sham investment charges”. We will adopt the same terminology but needless to say, this is solely for convenience and reflects nothing more. These three charges pertained to the use of funds from the BF to purchase bonds from Xtron and Firna and were for the offence of conspiring to commit CBT by an agent punishable under s 409 read with s 109 of the Penal Code. The charges were brought under two different editions of the Penal Code, with the first charge being under the 1985 revised edition (ie, Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed)) and the second and third charges being under the 2008 revised edition (ie, Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)). This was because the offences in the latter two charges occurred after the amendments to the Penal Code came into effect on 1 February 2008. Following the amendments, the maximum non-life imprisonment term for the offence was increased from ten to 20 years. We will refer to the different editions of the Penal Code collectively as “the Penal Code” unless the edition in question has significance. 15 Before the Judge, the appellants raised a preliminary objection in respect of the second of the three sham investment charges. They argued that the second charge was defective because the first and second charges both related to the sameconspiracy(ie, the entering into a bond agreement to use funds from the BF to purchase Xtron bonds) albeit to different drawdowns of the fund, and thus the Prosecution ought to have preferred only one charge. The Judge rejected this submission and held that each drawdown was a separate act being abetted and was thus capable of forming the subject of a separate charge (the Conviction GD at [100]–[102]). Although none of the appellants raised this preliminary objection in the hearing before us, their written submissions indicate that some of them are still pursuing this point on appeal. We do not think there is any merit to this argument. Where there are multiple acts of CBT pursuant to different transactions within the same overarching conspiracy, it does not follow that onlyonecharge should be preferred. Each time an act of CBT is committed in pursuance of a conspiracy, that is in itself an offence and therefore a separate charge of abetment by conspiracy of CBT may be brought against the accused. The Prosecution may well decide to bring a consolidated charge against the accused and ask for a higher sentence taking into account all the acts, but it is also equally within its discretion to prefer separate charges for each act or some of the acts, as in this case. 16 The second category of charges which the appellants, save for Kong Hee and John Lam, were convicted of is the “round-tripping charges”. These charges were similarly for the offence of conspiring to commit CBT by an agent punishable under s 409 read with s 109 of the Penal Code, and pertained to a series of transactions that was carried out between 9 April and 2 October 2009. The charges relate to the alleged misappropriation of sums from the BF and the GF for the purpose of creating a false appearance that the Firna bonds had been redeemed. 17 These two categories of charges (ie, the sham investment charges and the round-tripping charges) will be referred to collectively in this judgment as “the CBT Charges”. 18 The third category of charges which the appellants, save for Kong Hee and John Lam, were convicted of is the “account falsification charges”. These charges were framed under s 477A read with s 109 of the Penal Code, and pertained to the entries recorded in CHC’s accounts in October and early November 2009 for the transactions that were the subject of the round-tripping charges. 19 As seen from above, not all the appellants are involved in all the charges. Sharon is not involved in the sham investment charges, while John Lam and Kong Hee are not involved in the round-tripping charges and account falsification charges. But for ease of reference, we will refer to the relevant appellants who were involved in each category of charges simply as “the appellants” at various  parts of this judgment even though some of them may not be involved in that particular category of charges. 20 The facts relating to the various charges have been extensively set out by the Judge at [23]–[91] of the Conviction GD. We set out in the following section a brief summary of the facts that are relevant for consideration in the appeals.",
        "The facts": "The inception of the Crossover and its launch in the US 21 As stated above, the Crossover – which is central to the entire case – is an evangelistic endeavour to spread the gospel through the secular music of Sun Ho. It is not disputed that the Crossover had the full support of the CHC Board. The minutes of the CHC Board’s meeting on 5 May 2002 expressly recorded that the board unanimously agreed that it would be “consistent with the overall objective of [CHC] to fulfil the Great Commission … by sharing the message of faith, hope and love throughout the Chinese Community worldwide particularly in Far East Asia”. Between 2002 and 2005 when the Crossover was focused on only the Asian market, Sun Ho released five Mandarin pop albums, titled “Sun with Love” (2002), “SunDay” (2002), “Lonely Travel” (2003), “Gain” (2004), and “Embrace” (2005). 22 In 2001 and 2002, the Crossover was directly funded by CHC. This was the case until the middle of January 2003, when Roland Poon, an ordinary member of CHC, alleged that CHC was giving excessive attention to Sun Ho and was misusing its funds in connection with her. Besides the CHC Board publishing a written response in a local newspaper stating that church funds had not been used to purchase Sun Ho’s albums or to promote her career,1Foot Note 1×2D-9.Kong Hee also told the executive members of CHC (“the EMs”) at an annual general meeting on 27 April 2003 that no church funds had been used for the Crossover. It cannot be disputed that this was not true. He explained that the monies ($1.27m) that had been set aside for the promotion of Sun Ho’s albums had in fact come from the family of a church member, Wahju Hanafi (“Wahju”), an Indonesian businessman who was also a member of CHC. 23 After the incident concerning Roland Poon, CHC began to place some distance between itself and the Crossover in a bid to avoid negative publicity. This eventually led to the concept and creation of Xtron a few months later on 18 June 2003. John Lam, Eng Han and Eng Han’s wife were its founding directors and shareholders. On the same day, Xtron entered into an artiste management agreement with Sun Ho. 24 Xtron obtained funding to finance Sun Ho’s secular music activities from various sources, including (a) donations, which were often made in lieu of contributions to the BF; and (b) revenue directly from CHC. The latter often took the form of fees for the sub-leasing of a hall at the Singapore Expo (“Expo”) from Xtron for CHC’s weekend services or, starting from January 2006, for the provision of events management and audio-visual and lighting services to CHC. The audio-visual and lighting staff of Xtron were in fact originally from CHC but were transferred to Xtron in January 2006. 25 In early 2003, Kong Hee saw an opportunity for the Crossover to extend to the US. He started communicating with a producer, Justin Herz (“Justin”). Sun Ho released two English songs in the US which met with some success. Initially, the plan was for Sun Ho to release an album by March 2006, but this did not materialise. The Crossover’s need for funding and the entry into the Xtron bonds 26 In May 2006, Wyclef was engaged as an executive producer. As stated in the introduction to this judgment, Wyclef’s fees contributed to a significant increase in the amount of money needed to fund the Crossover. In this context, Kong Hee, Ye Peng and Eng Han began to consider methods to obtain more funding for the Crossover. They initially contemplated taking loans from two banks, Citic Ka Wah Bank Limited (“Citic Ka Wah”) in Hong Kong and UBS AG (“UBS”). But this plan was later abandoned because the interest rates charged by the banks were thought to be too high. In the minutes of a meeting of Xtron’s board dated 5 May 2007, it was recorded that Citic Ka Wah had offered a loan of $9m at an interest rate of 16% per annum but the Xtron directors concluded that the interest rate was “too high and agreed to source for other credit facilities”.2Foot Note 2×A-67.Around this time, there was also some talk about whether Xtron should take a loan of $2.5m from the BF. 27 We digress, at this juncture, to describe the BF. The BF was where the donations of CHC’s members to a campaign known as “the Arise and Build Campaign” were deposited. The purpose of the campaign was to raise funds for CHC to build its church building in Jurong West. The first cycle of the campaign was from 1997 to 2003 and the second cycle began in August 2005. In or around 2008, the aim was to raise $160m at the end of seven years for the BF. This projected aim was adjusted to $310m in or around 2010. For the purposes of the campaign, CHC’s members were given pledge cards to pledge their commitment towards fulfilling the projected targets. The pledge cards that were used for the campaign in 2007 and 2008 stated that the monies in the BF were to be used “for the purchase of land, construction costs, rentals, furniture and fittings”. 28 In or about the end of June 2007, Eng Han came up with the idea of obtaining financing for the Crossover through Xtron obtaining a loan from the BF. The idea was that Xtron would issue bonds which CHC would purchase with funds from the BF. The bonds could then be considered an investment from the BF in Xtron. Against this backdrop, steps were taken to obtain approval for the investment of the monies in the BF. The Investment Committee (previously known as the finance committee), which then comprised Ye Peng, Eng Han, John Lam, Serina, and another member of CHC known as Charlie Lay, was mobilised to draft an investment policy which would set out the types of investments that CHC should invest in.3Foot Note 3×E-183.Not all the members in the Investment Committee were aware that one of the purposes of the investment policy was to allow CHC to purchase the Xtron bonds. John Lam was tasked to take the lead in drafting the investment policy, which he forwarded to Eng Han, Serina and Charlie Lay on 27 June 2007 for their comments. On 28 June 2007, the Investment Committee discussed and approved the investment policy.4Foot Note 4×A-13.The investment policy provided as follows: Return Objective To maximize the return from surplus Building Fund (BF) not committed to the building expenditure, this is to maintain the purchasing power of the surplus against the increase in construction and property cost over the short-term future. The target is to attempt to achieve a minimum 3.25% return on investment. Risk Management BF can assume high risk given the ability of CHC to continually raise funds for BF, hence able to accept volatility and high risk instruments to seek better than average returns. The investment policy also set out limits to the allocation to each asset class of financial instruments and provided that CHC could invest up to a maximum of 100% of its total portfolio into “SGD denominated fixed income”. 29 On 5 July 2007, John Lam presented the investment policy to the CHC Board for consideration. The CHC Board unanimously approved it as being beneficial to the church.5Foot Note 5×CH-13.Kong Hee sought the approval of the EMs for the investment of money from the BF at an extraordinary general meeting (“EGM”) two days later, on 7 July 2007. He explained that CHC was unlikely to find a building to acquire any time soon, and it would thus be better to invest the money to generate financial returns than to leave the money sitting untouched in the BF.6Foot Note 6×CH-28.Eng Han also gave a short presentation at this EGM, explaining the parameters of the investment policy. It was announced that CHC would appoint AMAC – where Eng Han was a director and major shareholder – as fund manager to manage the initial sum of $25m from the BF that would be invested. The resolution was passed and CHC appointed AMAC as fund manager by an agreement dated 25 July 2007.7Foot Note 7×A-48.There was no mention of Xtron, the potential investment into Xtron bonds or the Crossover at this EGM.8Foot Note 8×CH-28. 30 On 17 August 2007, Xtron and AMAC -– as fund manager of CHC – entered into a bond subscription agreement (“the 1st Xtron BSA”).9Foot Note 9×A-68.Under this agreement, AMAC agreed to subscribe to bonds issued by Xtron of up to $13m in value, at an interest rate of 7% per annum and a maturity period of two years. The bonds were due to mature on 16 August 2009. Clause 2.3 of Schedule 3 stated that Xtron “shall use the proceeds of the [b]onds [for] production, publicity, distribution and travelling costs related to the production and marketing of [Xtron’s] music albums in the USA and Asia and salary costs”. At the time the 1st Xtron BSA was entered into, Xtron’s financial statements for the last financial year indicated that it was in a net deficit position of approximately $3.44m.10Foot Note 10×X-61. 31 From August 2007 to March 2008, $13m was transferred from the BF to Xtron in four tranches: (a) $5m in August 2007; (b) $2m in November 2007; (c) $3m in January 2008; and (d) $3m in March 2008. These transfers are the subject of the first two sham investment charges (see [14] above). These monies were used, as intended, on the Crossover. 32 On 21 April 2008, Xtron and AMAC entered into a second bond subscription agreement (“the 2nd Xtron BSA”).11Foot Note 11×A-85.This agreement was entered into pursuant to discussions to obtain more funding for Xtron.12Foot Note 12×Prosecution’s submissions below at para 42.No money was drawn down under this agreement, presumably because of a subsequent change in plans. The change in plans and the entry into the Firna bonds 33 In mid-2008, the audit fieldwork for Xtron’s financial year ending 31 December 2007 took place. In the course of this audit, two principal concerns were raised by the auditors. The first was that the value of the Xtron bonds might have to be written down in Xtron’s financial statements, given Xtron’s consistently loss-making position.13Foot Note 13×E-423, E-12.The second concern was that CHC and Xtron might be considered related parties and as such, the accounts of both CHC and Xtron might have to be consolidated. The appellants claim that they did not want such a consolidation and disclosure because it would undermine the discreet manner in which CHC was funding the Crossover. 34 On 21 July 2008, Serina met with Foong Daw Ching (“Foong”), a senior partner of the accounting firm, Baker Tilly Consultancy Pte Ltd (“Baker Tilly”), to discuss these concerns. In an email dated 24 July 2008, she set out the various matters that were discussed. According to her, Foong had raised, among other things, the following issues: (a) as long as there was uncertainty of repayment, there would have to be impairment of the Xtron bonds; (b) CHC would have to disclose that it subscribed for bonds in a company “in which a key employee is related to one of CHC’s Management Board members”; and (c) Sun Ho was a “key player” in Xtron, so the auditors required disclosure of all transactions between Xtron and CHC.14Foot Note 14×E-267.It thus appeared that as long as Sun Ho was managed by Xtron, CHC would be required to disclose this information. 35 In these circumstances, a plan was formulated to take Sun Ho out of Xtron. This plan involved transferring Sun Ho from Xtron to another company, Ultimate Assets (“UA”),15Foot Note 15×Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”) at para 9.1.and using funds from the BF to purchase bonds from Firna in order to finance the Crossover. Both UA and Firna were related to Wahju, who was and is a loyal member of CHC (see [22] above). UA was incorporated in November 2006, and is fully owned by Wahju.16Foot Note 16×ASOF at para 2.26.Firna was incorporated in Jakarta in 1971, and is in the business of the manufacture of glassware. Wahju and his father-in-law are the only shareholders of the company, holding 80.4% and 19.6% shareholding respectively.17Foot Note 17×ASOF at para 2.25. 36 At the same time, a plan for Xtron to purchase a commercial building in Singapore known as “The Riverwalk” was being developed. Under this plan, CHC would provide part of the purchase price by purchasing $5.2m worth of new bonds from Xtron and the outstanding amount would be financed by a bank loan secured by a mortgage over The Riverwalk. 37 On 10 August 2008, Kong Hee told the EMs at an EGM about Xtron’s plan to purchase The Riverwalk. This was apparently the first time that the EMs had been informed about the existence of Xtron. They were told that Xtron had been set up in 2003 by three members of CHC to own and manage future buildings that CHC could consistently use. They were also told that AMAC had advised CHC to purchase $18.2m of bonds with an expiry date of ten years from Xtron. Notably, there was no mention of the plan to purchase Firna bonds or the fact that Xtron would be taking a bank loan to partially finance its purchase of The Riverwalk. On 11 August 2008, Xtron exercised its option to purchase The Riverwalk. 38 On 20 August 2008, Xtron and AMAC terminated the 2nd Xtron BSA via a deed of termination, and AMAC transferred the $13m worth of bonds issued under the 1st Xtron BSA to the trustees of CHC via a deed of assignment. The trustees executed a deed of ratification and accession under which they agreed to be bound by the terms of the 1st Xtron BSA.18Foot Note 18×A-90.On the same day, Xtron and the trustees of CHC, through AMAC as attorney, entered into an amended bond subscription agreement (“the ABSA”).19Foot Note 19×A-91.Under the ABSA, the maximum amount of funding to be made available to Xtron was increased from $13m to $25m, and the stated interest rate was decreased from 7% to 5%. Importantly, the maturity date of the bonds was pushed back from two years of the date of issue to ten years.20Foot Note 20×A-91; see also ASOF at para 7.13. 39 Two months later, on 7 October 2008, CHC and Firna entered into a bond subscription agreement (“the Firna BSA”).21Foot Note 21×A-116.The agreement was that CHC would subscribe from Firna a maximum of $24.5m in bonds that would mature in three years and yield an interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum. Firna was to use the bond proceeds “for general working capital”.22Foot Note 22×Clause 2.3 of Schedule 3.The plan of Eng Han, Ye Peng and Serina was to use the Firna bonds to fund the Crossover in the following way: (a) CHC would pay money to Firna for the bonds; (b) thereafter, Firna would transfer the money to UA; and (c) lastly, UA would transfer the funds to Justin’s company for the Crossover. 40 In order to get the other shareholder of Firna, Wahju’s father-in-law, to go along with the plan, the parties came up with a “secret letter”23Foot Note 23×E-211.to assure him that CHC would not exercise the convertibility option in the Firna BSA and convert the Firna bonds into shares in Firna. The secret letter was signed by John Lam on behalf of the CHC Board on 8 September 2008 – before the Firna BSA was entered into – and contained the written assurance of CHC that in the event that CHC exercised its convertibility option, it would sell the Firna shares back to Wahju and his father-in-law for US$1. With this, Wahju’s father-in-law went along with the plan and signed the Firna BSA. 41  From October 2008 to June 2009, $11m was transferred from the BF to Firna pursuant to the Firna BSA. This was done in five tranches. These transfers are the subject of the third of the sham investment charges. It is undisputed that out of this $11m, about $7.56m was used for the Crossover and $2.5m was used by Wahju for his personal expenses. Plan to redeem the Xtron and Firna bonds and the “round-tripping” transactions 42 On 9 April 2009, which was before the last two (of the five) tranches of transfers under the Firna bonds took place, Sharon, Ye Peng and John Lam met with the engagement partner from Baker Tilly, Sim Guan Seng (“Sim”), to discuss CHC’s audit matters. Ye Peng and John Lam both left at some point in the meeting, but Sharon was there throughout. 43 Following this meeting, Ye Peng and Sharon (as well as Eng Han and Serina who were later informed of what transpired at the meeting) decided that the Xtron and Firna bonds had to be redeemed before the end of CHC’s financial year (ie, 31 October 2009). The Prosecution argues that this was because they feared that Sim would continue questioning the bonds as long as they remained on CHC’s accounts and that this would eventually lead to the true nature of the bonds being exposed. The defence argues, instead, that the plans to have those bonds redeemed were because Sim had taken issue with the difficulty of valuing the bonds, both of which were unquoted and not traded on the open market. 44 Ye Peng, Sharon, Eng Han and Serina then devised various plans to redeem the Xtron and Firna bonds. Around this time in early 2009, CHC was also actively sourcing for a building suitable for its church services. Eng Han played a key role in these efforts, and a number of sites, such as the Capitol Theatre, Suntec City and the Singapore Flyer, were identified as suitable acquisition targets. In June 2009, CHC (through Eng Han) made an unsuccessful bid for Suntec City. Subsequently in September 2009, concurrent discussions concerning CHC’s bid for the land at Capitol Theatre and a stake in Suntec City took place. As the Judge noted at [83] of the Conviction GD, some of the plans to redeem the Xtron bonds overlapped with the plan for Xtron to purchase a building for CHC’s benefit. Pursuant to this plan, CHC was to pay Xtron advance rental so as to put Xtron in funds to purchase a property for CHC’s benefit. Xtron would then lease the property back to CHC. In reality, the advance rental which CHC was to pay Xtron provided the eventual source of funds for the redemption of the Xtron and Firna bonds. 45 This formed the backdrop against which the following series of relevant transactions were entered into from 2 October to 29 December 2009 in order to redeem the Xtron and Firna bonds: (a) On 2 October 2009, CHC transferred $5.8m from the BF to AMAC as payment for Tranche 10 of a Special Opportunities Fund (“SOF”) administered by AMAC, which was recorded in CHC’s General Journal under the accounts name “Investment” as a payment of $5.8m to AMAC as “Investment–Special Opportunity Fund”.24Foot Note 24×A-143; see also ASOF at para 12.7.By way of background, the SOF was an on-going fund set up by AMAC in 2009. This fund comprised several tranches by which AMAC guaranteed the principal and a fixed return to a client who invested in a particular tranche. For Tranche 10 of the SOF, the stated period of investment was from 2 October to 25 November 2009 with a fixed return of 5.05% per annum.25Foot Note 25×A-140. (b) On 5 October 2009, AMAC transferred $5.8m to UA. UA received the sum (less a telegraphic transfer fee of $20) on 6 October 2009, and transferred $5.3m to Firna on 7 October 2009. On 9 October 2009, Firna transferred $5,228,750 to CHC, which was recorded in CHC’s books as a partial redemption of the Firna bonds. (c) On 15 October 2009, CHC transferred $5.6m from the GF to AMAC as payment for Tranche 11 of the SOF, which was recorded as “Special Opportunity Fund” under the accounts name “Investment” in CHC’s accounts. AMAC transferred this sum (less a telegraphic transfer fee of $20) to UA on 16 October 2009. Tranche 11 of the SOF was to run from 15 October to 25 November 2009 and provided for a return rate of 5.05% per annum.26Foot Note 26×A-140.On 20 October 2009, UA transferred $6.1m to Firna, and Firna transferred $6,061,950 to CHC, which was recorded in CHC’s books as redemption of the remaining Firna bonds with interest. (d) Sometime after 15 October 2009, CHC signed an Advance Rental License Agreement dated 1 October 2009 with Xtron (“the ARLA”).27Foot Note 27×A-153.Under the ARLA, CHC would have the right to use and occupy the premises provided by Xtron for eight years, in return for the payment of advance rental of $46.27m to Xtron. A further $7m was paid to Xtron as a security deposit, making the total sum under the ARLA approximately $53.27m. On 31 October 2009, an entry was made in CHC’s General Journal describing a set-off of $21.5m from the sum due to Xtron under the ARLA as “Redemption of Xtron Bonds”.28Foot Note 28×A-157. (e) On 6 November 2009, CHC transferred $15,238,936.61 to Xtron. This payment was described in CHC’s accounts as “Advance rental with Xtron”.29Foot Note 29×A-162.Of this sum, $12m was for part payment of the advance rental under the ARLA with the remaining sum of $3,238,936.61 being Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) for the advance rental. (f) On 1 December 2009, Xtron transferred $11.455m to Firna pursuant to a bond subscription agreement dated the same day between the two entities.30Foot Note 30×A-164.Firna then transferred a total of $11.476m to UA over three tranches between 4 and 11 December 2009. On 15 and 28 December 2009, UA transferred a total of $11.476m to AMAC in two tranches. On 16 December and 29 December 2009, AMAC transferred sums to CHC in respect of Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF. CHC received a total of $11,476,625, comprising $11.4m in principal and $76,625 in interest.31Foot Note 31×ASOF at para 12.35. Like the Judge, we collectively refer to these transactions as “the round-tripping transactions”. 46 The net result of the round-tripping transactions – parts of which were the subject of the round-tripping charges and account falsification charges – was that the Xtron and Firna bonds were redeemed. Through the transactions, AMAC’s liability under Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF was also discharged. In essence, the liability owed by Xtron and Firna to CHC under the relevant bond subscription agreements was transferred to a liability on Xtron’s part to provide premises to CHC under the ARLA. It appears that subsequently, pursuant to the ARLA, Xtron provided CHC with premises at the Expo for a period of time. Events in 2010 47 Thereafter, in January 2010, CHC acquired a stake in Suntec City through the purchase of 12.5% of the shares in another company, Harmony Partners Investment Limited, for $18.75m. Subsequently, the ARLA was terminated on 31 March 2010.32Foot Note 32×X-7.On 31 May 2010, the CAD commenced investigations and raided the offices of CHC, Xtron and some other companies as well as the residences of the appellants. 48 On 1 August 2010, CHC convened an EGM, where the EMs retrospectively approved CHC’s use of the BF to (a) subscribe to the Xtron bonds; (b) subscribe to the Firna bonds; and (c) pay the advance rental and security deposit amounting to $53.3m to Xtron to secure an auditorium space for CHC for a period of eight years (ie, the ARLA). The EMs also approved the continuation of the Crossover and authorised the CHC Board to support the mission.33Foot Note 33×A-167.Effectively, CHC was seeking to ratify the transactions that had taken place and which were the subject of the investigations. 49 On 4 October 2010, Xtron repaid CHC a total of $40.5m which was due as the ARLA had been terminated. This comprised (a) $33,039,117.60 being the unutilised advance rental; (b) $7m being the full amount of the security deposit paid by CHC; and (c) $453,103.02 being the interest accrued from the date of termination of the ARLA until full payment was made.34Foot Note 34×ASOF at para 12.37.Xtron appeared to have been put into funds to effect repayment through the obtaining of loans from various individuals.",
        "Part I: The appeals against conviction": "50 Having set out the background, we now turn to consider the appellants’ appeals against their convictions. At the outset, we emphasise that an appellate court has a limited role in disturbing the findings of fact made by a trial court, especially where these are based on an assessment of the witnesses and their credibility. Thus, unless these findings can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence, an appellate court would be slow to overturn the trial judge’s findings of fact.",
        "The decision below on conviction": "The CBT Charges 51 The Judge approached the analysis of the CBT Charges by identifying the elements that the Prosecution was required to prove. He held that there were five elements, being that: (a) the relevant appellants who were on the CHC Board were entrusted with dominion over CHC’s funds; (b) such dominion was entrusted to them in the way of their business as agents; (c) things were done that constituted a “wrong use” of CHC’s funds; (d) each of the appellants played some role in the things done; and (e) each of the appellants acted dishonestly in doing so. 52 As to the first element, the Judge held that John Lam, Kong Hee and Ye Peng had been entrusted with dominion over CHC’s funds by reason of their membership of the CHC Board. He also held that John Lam, Kong Hee and Ye Peng had been entrusted with the funds in the way of their business as agents and thus fell under s 409 of the Penal Code. In this regard, the Judge held that he was bound by the decision of the High Court inTay Choo Wah v Public Prosecutor[1974–1976] SLR(R) 725 (“Tay Choo Wah”) where it was decided that directors who were entrusted with property in the course of their duties as directors would have been entrusted with the property in the way of their business as agents. 53 Having established the first two elements, the Judge then analysed whether the application of CHC’s funds towards (a) the Xtron bonds; (b) the Firna bonds; and (c) the round-tripping transactions constituted a “wrong use” of CHC’s funds. In respect of the Xtron and Firna bonds, the question of “wrong use” of the BF turned on whether the Xtron and Firna bonds could be considered investments. He held that: (a) The Xtron bonds constituted a “wrong use” of the BF because the Xtron bonds were not a genuine investment. Instead, the transaction was a “temporary loan” of money from the BF to Kong Hee to use in respect of the Crossover (the Conviction GD at [153]). (b) The Firna bonds were also not a genuine investment. They were no more than a device to put money from the BF into the appellants’ hands in order that they might use it for the Crossover (the Conviction GD at [170]). 54 In respect of the round-tripping transactions, the considerations were slightly different. The Judge held that: (a) Tranche 10 of the SOF constituted a “wrong use” of the BF because it was not a genuine investment. It was instead part of an overall scheme to substitute one debt owed to CHC (ie, the Firna bonds) with another debt owed to CHC (ie, under the AMAC SOF) (the Conviction GD at [174]). (b) Tranche 11 of the SOF was disbursed from the GF, which was not a restricted fund like the BF. However, this also constituted a “wrong use” because it was not a genuine investment and, in any case, the GF could not be used for the perpetration of fraud (the Conviction GD at [174] and [178]). (c) The disbursement of approximately $15m under the ARLA was a “wrong use” of the BF because it was not a property- or building-related expense. It was a device to repay the Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF (the Conviction GD at [175]). 55 With the above having been established, the Judge turned to consider whether the Prosecution had proven that the appellants had participated in the plans to an extent that they could be said to have engaged in a conspiracy to put CHC’s funds to wrong use, and whether they acted dishonestly in doing so. In relation to the issue of dishonesty, the Judge’s approach was to decide if (a) the appellants intended to put CHC’s funds to uses which amounted to wrong uses of those funds; and (b) the appellants did so knowing that they were not legally entitled to use the funds in that manner. 56 The Judge considered the appellants’ argument that the critical fact that exonerated them was that they did not keep the relevant transactions hidden from the professionals who were advising them. However, the Judge was not persuaded by this argument because he found that they had not been “open” with the professionals. In this connection, he found that: (a) In relation to the Xtron bonds, the auditors and lawyers did not know that Xtron was controlled by Kong Hee and the other appellants, and that the directors of Xtron were merely figureheads (the Conviction GD at [207] and [212]). (b) In relation to the Firna bonds, the auditors and lawyers did not know that (i) Kong Hee and those assisting him had full control over the Firna bond proceeds and treated the monies as theirs; and (ii) neither Firna nor Wahju was truly responsible for redeeming the Firna bonds (the Conviction GD at [220]). (c) In relation to the round-tripping transactions, the Judge held that the substance of the transactions was not disclosed to the lawyers or auditors (the Conviction GD at [230]). 57 Finally, the Judge analysed the facts concerning each appellant, and held that they had been proven beyond reasonable doubt to have been involved in the conspiracy with the requisite dishonestmens rea. He therefore convicted them on the respective CBT Charges that have been brought against them. We elaborate on the Judge’s findings in the various sections below. The account falsification charges 58 On the charges relating to account falsification, the Judge’s approach was to determine (a) if the accounting entries were false; (b) whether each of the appellants who had been charged for this category of offences engaged in a conspiracy for the doing of a thing that amounted to making a false entry in CHC’s accounts; and (c) whether each of those appellants acted with an intent to defraud. On each of the elements, the Judge held that: (a) The relevant accounting entries, involving (i) Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF; (ii) the payment of approximately $15m under the ARLA; and (iii) the redemption of the Xtron bonds, were false (the Conviction GD at [447] and [452]). (b) The appellants had a common design to remove both the Xtron and Firna bonds from CHC’s accounts, satisfying the requirement of engagement in a conspiracy (the Conviction GD at [448] and [453]–[454]). (c) The appellants acted with an intention to defraud as they knew that the various transactions were meant to create false appearances (the Conviction GD at [449] and [458]). The Judge thus convicted the relevant appellants on the account falsification charges.",
        "The CBT Charges": "The reduction in charge from s 409 to s 406 of the Penal Code 362 We begin the analysis of the appropriate sentences to be imposed for the CBT Charges by first reiterating that for the reasons set out at [88]–[112] above, we have reduced the charges from the aggravated charge of CBT by an agent under s 409 of the Penal Code to a charge of CBTsimpliciterunder s 406 of the Penal Code. While we have reduced the CBT Charges from s 409 to s 405 of the Penal Code, we will continue to refer to them as the “CBT Charges”, “the sham investment charges” or “the round-tripping charges” for ease of reference. 363 This reduction in charge has a significant impact on the sentences that may be meted out on the appellants because the maximum punishments of the two provisions are markedly different. The maximum determinate punishment (leaving aside the maximum punishment of life imprisonment) under s 409 of the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code was ten years’ imprisonment, and  has become 20 years’ imprisonment since the 2008 revised edition came into force on 1 February 2008. In contrast, the maximum punishment under s 406 for the offence of CBTsimpliciterwas three years’ imprisonment under the 1985 revised edition and is now seven years’ imprisonment under the 2008 revised edition. As highlighted at [14] above, the first sham investment charge falls under the 1985 revised edition while the rest of the CBT Charges fall under the 2008 revised edition. 364 Accordingly, we have approached the sentences for the CBT Charges afresh, though in doing so, we will take into account the Judge’s findings and the parties’ submissions on the aggravating and mitigating factors as well as the relative culpability of the respective appellants to the extent that they continue to be applicable or relevant. General sentencing considerations 365 The Prosecution submits that save for the sentences in respect of the round-tripping charges relating to the misappropriation of CHC’s funds through Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF which it is not appealing against, the sentences for the CBT Charges are manifestly inadequate. In particular, the Prosecution submits that the Judge erred in (a) failing to give due weight to the sentencing precedents and placing too little emphasis on the quantum of monies that was involved; (b) taking reference solely from the decision inJoachim Kang; and (c) not accounting sufficiently for the aggravating factors which included (i) the misappropriation of a large amount of charity funds; (ii) the cultivation and abuse of the trust and faith placed in the appellants by CHC’s members; and (iii) the extensive planning and premeditation and subsequent cover up of the misappropriation to avoid detection. 366 On the flipside, the appellants argue that the present case is a unique one without a directly analogous precedent, though they seek to use the case ofSeaward III Frederick Oliver v Public Prosecutor[1994] 3 SLR(R) 89 (“Seaward”) – for which the sentence of a day’s imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 had been meted out and upheld on appeal – to submit that a non-custodial sentence or a nominal imprisonment term should be imposed for their offences. They point out that they did not commit the offences for personal gain, and that CHC did not end up suffering any financial loss as the bonds were fully redeemed with interest. They argue that, moreover, although there had been a “wrong use” of CHC’s funds, the “wrong use” of the funds was ultimately to advance the Crossover, which, as the Judge recognised at [124] of the Conviction GD, was “an integral aspect of CHC’s evangelistic efforts” and “a core mission of the church”. The Judge’s observation at [500] of the Conviction GD that the appellants “believed that they had acted in what they considered to be the best interests of CHC” has also been repeatedly referred to by the appellants to emphasise the exceptional considerations that are present in this case. 367 We accept the general proposition that in respect of property offences, including that of CBT, the starting consideration ought to be the value of the property misappropriated. This principle has been reiterated in many cases. InWong Kai Chuen Philip v Public Prosecutor[1990] 2 SLR(R) 361 (“Philip Wong”), Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) observed (at [18]) that in an offence like CBT, “it [was] a matter of common sense that, all other things being equal, the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court”. More recently, in the case ofIdya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2014] 1 SLR 756, Sundaresh Menon CJ stated in a similar vein that the “primary yardstick” involved in sentencing for an offence of cheating under s 417 of the Penal Code would often be the “value of the property involved” (at [48]). 368 While the value of the property misappropriated ought ordinarily to be the starting point for the analysis of the appropriate sentence, it also bears emphasis that the court’s discretion in sentencing is never restricted to the application of a mathematical formula based on the amount in question (see, for example, the observations of Yong CJ inAmir Hamzah bin Berang Kuty vPublic Prosecutor[2003] 1 SLR(R) 617 at [60]). As Lee Seiu Kin J observed inTan Cheng Yewat [184], it is common sense that sentences for CBT offences donotbear a relationship of linear proportionality with the sums involved. The appropriate sentence to be imposed must be arrived at after having regard not just to the amounts in question, but also to the totality of the circumstances, particularly the specific facts of the case. 369 In this connection, we find the following non-exhaustive factors set out by the English Court of Appeal inR v John Barrick(1985) 81 Cr App R 78 at 81–82 relevant. While these factors were set out in the context of the offences of theft and fraud, we find them to be also relevant in the context of the offence of CBT. These factors were also cited inPhilip Wongat [25]. They include (a) the quality and degree of trust reposed in the offender, which would encompass a consideration of his rank; (b) the period over which the act was perpetrated; (c) the use to which the money or property that was dishonestly taken was put; (d) the effect upon the victim; and (e) the impact of the offences on the public and public confidence. 370 In our judgment, this case issui generisand without direct precedent. Although the sums involved are indeed substantial, we find that there are a number of other mitigating factors to which due consideration must be given. In particular, this was a situation which, as accepted by the Prosecution, involvedno personal gainon the appellants’ part. In fact, as the Judge found at [500] of the Conviction GD, and as we accepted at [313] above, the appellants acted in what they considered to be the best interests of CHC. In other words, they believed that their acts, especially where the sham investment charges are concerned, wouldultimatelyhave advanced the interests of CHC by allowing them to evangelise through the Crossover. In this regard, we also accept that the Crossover was generally endorsed by the body of CHC. Although it is clear that not 100% of CHC was in support of the Crossover, and that in some instances, the support of the church was obtained without full disclosure of the facts (for example, the members were falsely led to believe after the Roland Poon incident that CHC had never funded the Crossover directly), it is also equally clear and telling that a substantial proportion of CHC’s membership continued to support the mission of the Crossover evenafterthe full facts surrounding the CBT Charges were brought to light (see also the Sentencing GD at [23]). 371 At this point, we would like to make a clarification in relation to the use of the term “charity funds”. The Prosecution refers to the funds that were misappropriated as “charity funds”, and submits that an egregious aggravating factor in this case is that the appellants had misappropriated a very substantial amount of “charity funds”. The Prosecution’s characterisation of the funds as “charity funds” is presumably on the basis that these were funds that belonged to CHC, which is a registered charity. In our view, there is a need to draw a distinction between funds held by a charityper seand funds held by a charity that isalsoan Institution of Public Character (“IPC”), which is an organisation approved by the Commissioner of Charities to receive tax-deductible donations. The funds held by CHC belong to the former and not the latter category. 372 CHC, as well as most churches, are charities as defined under the Charities Act (Cap 37, 2007 Rev Ed) because under general law, the advancement of religion is a charitable purpose. To that extent, the funds within CHC’s control can be termed as “charitable funds” or “charity funds”. But such funds of a religious body are not of the same genre as funds of IPCs such as the National Kidney Foundation, the Society for the Aged Sick, and the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped, whose objects are for the promotion of welfare for the benefit of all Singaporeans and not confined to sectional interests of groups based on race, belief or religion. As mentioned, persons who donate to charities conferred the status of IPCs can claim tax relief (presently, 250% of the donations), but persons who donate to charities like CHC cannot. Unlike the funds that are held by IPCs whose objects are to serve the needs of the community in Singapore as a whole, the funds in the possession of a body like CHC are, in general, for its own use and for the benefits of its members. Donations to entities like CHC are invariably made by its members for the benefit of the church, and do not enjoy any tax deduction. Thus while the funds of IPCs and bodies like CHC can both be regarded as “charity funds”, their characters are quite distinct. 373 On the issue of the lack of personal gain, we note that Kong Hee objects to the Judge’s allusion at [21] of the Sentencing GD that he had indirectly benefited from the sham investment offences as the misused funds had been used to advance his wife’s music career. He argues that the Judge had erred in letting his decision be coloured by this erroneous finding. 374 We are of the view that there is no merit to Kong Hee’s objection. It is clear to us that the Judge did not factor the possible indirect gain on the part of Kong Hee into his sentencing analysis. While it is true that the Judge had mentioned that “there was undoubtedly also a form of indirect benefit for Kong Hee” in the form of an advancement of his wife’s music career(at [21] of the Sentencing GD), it is crucial to note that he went on to say in the very next paragraph that “it is not the [P]rosecution’s case thatevenKong Hee had enjoyed any wrongful gain” [emphasis added] and that as such, he would say no more on this issue. There was also no mention of this factor in his subsequent analysis as to why Kong Hee was, in the Judge’s opinion, most culpable and thus deserving of the highest sentence. When the Judge’s observations and decision are viewed in this light, we do not see any room for the argument that the Judge’s decision had been erroneously coloured by this factor. 375 On a related though separate issue, we note that the Prosecution had not focused on any gain to third parties for its case on conviction and sentence, even though this may have been suggested in the charges (especially the sham investment charges). While the Prosecution did, in its oral submissions before us, attempt to make the point that a benefit had accrued to Sun Ho,197Foot Note 197×Transcript, 21 September 2016, p 36.this point was not raised in its written submissions for the appeal and was also not raised before the Judge. In the circumstances, we approach the sentencing in this case as one without anyelement of wrongful gain or personal financial benefit, either direct or indirect. 376  Another important aspect of this case concerns the fact that the appellants didnotintend any permanent financial loss to CHC where the CBT Charges are concerned (save for the round-tripping charge concerning the disbursement of $15.2m under the ARLA, which we will discuss later). It is true that as regards the Xtron and Firna bonds, the appellants were reckless with CHC’s funds and ran the risk that CHC would suffer financial loss. But we equally accept that the appellants had, at all times,intendedfor the funds which they misappropriated from CHC via the Xtron and Firna bonds to beeventuallyreturned to CHC with the stated interest even if they might not have been entirely sure as to how or when they could do so at the time when they entered into the transactions. As matters transpired, the mechanism which was employed to repay the Xtron and Firna bonds was by making CHC put Xtron into funds through the obligations under the ARLA. Though we have found at [168] above that the ARLA was not a commercially justifiable agreement that provided CHC with fair value for the sums it contracted to pay thereunder, we note that the Prosecution’s case is that, apart from the sum of $3.2m that was paid as GST under the ARLA, no permanent financial loss would be caused to CHC as a result of the round-tripping charges which allowed for the redemption of the Firna bonds. Given this, we accept that the position on which the sentences for the CBT Charges should be meted out ought to be on the basis that the appellants would ensure that CHC would not have suffered, and had in fact not suffered, any permanent financial loss (save for the sum of $3.2m that was paid as GST, though we note that this sum was eventually also returned to CHC when the ARLA was rescinded). 377 In our judgment, the present case should not be viewed as a sinister and malicious attempt on the appellants’ part to strip the church of funds for their own purposes. We accept that because the appellants wanted to keep the use of the BF for the Crossover confidential, and feared questions being asked thereon, they resorted to deceit and lies. This included inflating Sun Ho’s success, keeping the true nature of the various transactions from the auditors, lawyers, the CHC Board and CHC’s members and presenting a misleading picture to CHC’s members even after the CAD had commenced its investigations. Such prevarication is undoubtedly an aggravating factor and should not be condoned, especially since most of the funds in question were from the BF, which were funds donated to CHC for a specific and restricted purpose. But, at the same time, the appellants’ various non-disclosures take on a different character when underscored by the overarching theme that they were acting in what they genuinelybelievedto be in CHC’s interests. Whether this mayin factbe so is a matter open for debate, but what is crucial is that this was theirbelief. Thus, despite the fact that a large amount of funds from CHC was misappropriated, which would ordinarily have attracted a sentence at the higher end of the sentencing spectrum, we would allow for a significant discount given the exceptional mitigating factors in the present case. None of the appellants, particularly Eng Han, Ye Peng, John Lam, Serina and Sharon, could be said to have gained anything from what they did other than pursuing the objects of CHC. Their fault lies in adopting the wrong means. 378 Apart from the various aggravating and mitigating factors, the Prosecution also submits that the dominant sentencing principle applicable to this case is that of general deterrence. It argues that the Judge failed to correctly apply the principle of general deterrence for two reasons. First, it submits that the Judge erroneously accepted that the mere prospect of a criminal conviction, let alone a substantial custodial term, already carries some deterrent value. This, the Prosecution submits, runs dangerously close to the “clang of the prison gate” argument – that the shame of going to prison is sufficient punishment for a person of standing in society – that the Judge had himself found inapplicable (the Sentencing GD at [28]). 379 Second, the Prosecution argues that the Judge erred in agreeing with the appellants that there was less need for general deterrence in cases where an offender wasnotmotivated by personal gain because it was unclear how such offenders would be deterred by the prospect of a deterrent sentence, since a rational cost-benefit analysis would not be in play in such cases (the Sentencing GD at [35]). The Prosecution submits that this is clearly wrong because unlike offenders with mental disorders, offenders who do not commit crimes for personal gain can still reason rationally. 380 In our view, there is merit to both arguments, in particular the second argument. Offenders who do not commit crimes for personal gain, but for other reasons, for example, altruistic motives or even vengeance, can be deterred as long as they can think rationally. To put it simply, whether a person can be deterred is not dependent on his motive for committing the offence but on whether he is capable of rational thinking. As for the first argument, while we agree with the Judge that the prospect of a custodial term in itself carries deterrent weight, we are cautious (and to that extent agree with the Prosecution) that not too much weight must be given to this. Thus, the sentence meted out must be proportionate to the principle of general deterrence, which we agree is the dominant sentencing principle applicable to the present case. 381 Having said that, the principle of general deterrence does not in all cases call for a sentence at the higher end of the sentencing spectrum. The question which must be considered in all cases involving the principle of general deterrence is whether the sentence in question would suffice to deter other offenders from committing an offence similar in nature to the one in question. In the present case which does not involve offenders motivated by personal gain but instead by what they believed was in the interests of CHC, we are of the view thatgenerally speaking, the prospect of a not insubstantial custodial sentence would be sufficient to deter would-be offenders from furthering their altruistic motives through unlawful means. 382 We should also add, before we move on to address the specific categories of charges, that contrary to the appellants’ submissions,198Foot Note 198×See for instance, Kong Hee’s submission at para 321.we findSeawardto be of little relevance to the present case. One of the offenders inSeawardwas a chairman of a church, the Calvary Charismatic Centre. He was convicted of the offence of abetting a conspiracy to cheat a finance company by inflating the prices of audio-visual equipment purchased from the US by about US$10,000 under a hire-purchase arrangement. He was sentenced to a day’s imprisonment and a fine of $10,000, and the sentence was upheld on appeal. In sentencing the offender, the court had placed weight on the fact that there was no suggestion that the offence had been committed for his personal gain. 383 Insofar as the appellants are relying onSeawardfor the submission that we should follow the court’s approach thereto place mitigating weight on the fact that the appellants’ motives were not to gain or profit from the offences of CBT, we do not find this controversial and have taken their motives and the absence of personal gain into account (see [370] above). But if what the appellants are seeking is that a similar sentence to that inSeaward(that is, a nominal imprisonment term and a fine) should be imposed here, this clearly cannot be correct as the facts there bear almost no similarity to the present case save that it also involved a church. For one,Seawardinvolves the cheating of a third party, and not the offence of CBT of property that the church had entrusted to the offender. Further, the amount involved inSeawardwas also nowhere near the present. Given these distinguishing factors, we do not thinkSeawardis an entirely relevant precedent, save for the principle therein that a lower sentence would generally be imposed for certain types of property offences where there is no suggestion of the offender receiving (or intending to receive) personal gain (see alsoLim Ying Ying Luciana v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2016] 4 SLR 1220). 384 With that, we move on to address the specific categories of charges, beginning with the sham investment charges. Sentencing considerations in relation to the sham investment charges 385 There are three sham investment charges. The first sham investment charge was brought under the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code and attracts a maximum imprisonment term of three years. The second and third sham investment charges were brought under the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code and they attract a maximum imprisonment term of seven years. 386 The increase in the maximum imprisonment term for the offence of CBT in the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code was the result of a comprehensive review of the penalty regime across a number of offences under the Penal Code carried out by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Attorney-General’s Chambers, the Ministry of Law and other government agencies. During the second reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2007 (Bill 38 of 2007), the Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs identified four principles by which the review of the penalties for the various offences was undertaken. These principles were as follows: (a) the type and quantum of punishment should provide sufficient flexibility to the courts to mete out an appropriate sentence in each case; (b) the prevalence of the offence; (c) the proportionality of the penalty to an offence, taking into account the seriousness of the offence; and (d) the relativity in punishment between related offences (seeSingapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(22 October 2007) vol 83 col 2201 (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee)). 387 It is clear from the tenor of the Parliamentary Debates on the amendments that where Parliament increased the maximum sentence imposable for a particular offence, this signified that Parliament viewed the offence as more serious and therefore requiring stiffer punishments in line with current societal trends and circumstances (see alsoSingapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(23 October 2007) vol 83 col 2425–2444 (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee)). This is also consistent with the observations inMehra Radhika v Public Prosecutor[2015] 1 SLR 96 where Menon CJ said as follows (at [27]): … As a generally operative background factor, if Parliament has increased the punishment for an offence on the basis that the mischief in question was becoming more serious and needed to be arrested … the courts would not be acting in concert with the legislative intent if they fail to have regard to this in developing the appropriate sentencing framework or if they nonetheless err on the side of leniency in sentencing. 388 Applying this to the present case, there is thus a need for us to give due weight to the increase in the maximum sentencing range in sentencing the appellants for the CBT Charges where those charges fall under s 406 ofthe 2008 revised editionof the Penal Code as opposed to those under the 1985 revised edition. With that in mind, we turn to some relevant sentencing precedents for the offence of CBTsimpliciterunder the 1985 and 2008 revised editions of the Penal Code. 389 The first case which we find relevant is the case ofPublic Prosecutor v Lee Siew Eng Helen[2005] SGDC 84. There, the accused was convicted of two counts of CBT under the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code. She worked as the general manager of an insurance brokerage firm and in that capacity had access to funds in an Insurance Broking Premium Account. This account held premiums and commissions from clients and insurers and could only be used for purposes stipulated in the Insurance Intermediaries Act (Cap 142A, 2000 Rev Ed). The accused withdrew sums of $24,028 and $134,296 for the payment of various office expenses, which were not within the stipulated purposes of the account. In respect of both sums which formed the basis of the two charges, the district judge sentenced the accused to concurrent imprisonment terms of three and six months, respectively. He also imposed a $10,000 fine for each charge. The global sentence imposed was thus six months’ imprisonment and a $20,000 fine. In arriving at the sentence, the district judge noted “the strong mitigatory factor here that the offender did not benefit herself, and used the funds for the company” (at [115]). 390 On appeal, inLee Siew Eng Helen v Public Prosecutor[2005] 4 SLR(R) 53 (“Helen Lee”), the High Court upheld the sentence imposed. Yong CJ considered that the sentence was not manifestly excessive taking into account the large sums of money involved and the fact that the accused had not pleaded guilty or made restitution. In respect of the argument that she did not receive any personal gain, Yong CJ remarked that this did not make her any less morally culpable because the breach of a relationship of trust was in itself an aggravating factor (at [31]). 391 In another case,Goh Kah Heng(HC), one of the two offenders, who was the head of a charity, was, among other charges, convicted of a charge under s 406 of the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code for misappropriating $50,000 of charity funds by approving a loan to his personal executive. He was sentenced to an imprisonment term of four months for this charge.  On appeal, Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) upheld the sentence of four months’ imprisonment. In Tay J’s view (at [93]), the misuse of funds in a charitable organisation was a serious offence. Further, the amounts involved inGoh Kah Hengwere not small. Moreover, while the offender in question made restitution of the $50,000, this was only after the authorities had begun looking into the matter. 392 We refer, too, to the decision ofJoachim Kang. To recapitulate, the offender inJoachim Kang, who was a priest, had misappropriated $5.1m over a period of eight years from the church for his personal benefit, such as to purchase a property and to buy computer equipment for his god-daughters. Only $2.5m was recovered. After a short trial, the offender pleaded guilty. Six charges under s 406 of the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code were proceeded with and a further 13 charges were taken into consideration. The district judge imposed the following sentences: (a) for the misappropriation of $60,000: 10 months’ imprisonment; (b) for the misappropriation of $305,500: 18 months’ imprisonment; (c) for the misappropriation of $500,000 (two counts): 27 months’ imprisonment each; (d) for the misappropriation of $600,000: 28 months’ imprisonment; and (e) for the misappropriation of $1m: 35 months’ imprisonment. The district judge ran three of the sentences consecutively (being that in respect of one count of (c), (d) and (e) above), resulting in a total sentence of an imprisonment term of seven and a half years. 393 The Judge consideredJoachim Kangto be “[p]erhaps the most persuasive precedent that ha[d] been raised for [his] consideration”199Foot Note 199×[36] of the Sentencing GD.as the case too involved the misuse of church funds, though he recognised that there were other significant differentiating factors such as the fact that the offender acted out of a desire for personal gain and the lack of restitution. The Prosecution and the appellants have all taken issue with the Judge’s reliance on this precedent. We express some doubt over whetherJoachim Kang(which involved offences of CBTsimpliciter) ought to have been used by the Judge as the appropriate starting point when he sentenced the appellants for the aggravated offence of CBT as a professional agent under s 409 of the Penal Code. Putting that aside, we find that whilst the case is useful as a precedent in respect of anormalcase under s 406 of the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code, it is less so for the present case because of two significant factors, namely, personal gain  was not a motivating factor here and there being full restitution. 394 Seen as a whole, the above authorities demonstrate that in sentencing for offences of CBT under s 406 of the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code, the greater the sum misappropriated, the greater the sentence of imprisonment imposed. At the same time, the quantum of monies misappropriated is clearly not the only factor to take into account when sentencing an offender. A clear comparison can be made between the misappropriation of $60,000 by the offender inJoachim Kangand the misappropriation of about $130,000 by the offender inHelen Lee. Although the offender in the latter case had misappropriated more than twice the amount of the former, her sentence was six months’ imprisonment, four months less than the offender inJoachim Kangwho received a sentence of ten months’ imprisonment for that particular charge. One clear differentiating factor between the cases is the lack of any motive for personal gain in the case of the offender inHelen Lee. 395 It is only logical that the same principles should apply in respect of the sentences that are to be imposed for the offence of CBT under s 406 of the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code. The main, if not sole, difference between the sentencing of the same offence under the two revised editions of the Penal Code should only be that the sentences under the latter edition should, generally speaking, be higher. 396 In our review of some of the cases that have been decided under s 406 of the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code, the sentences that have been imposed for a misappropriation of sums of $20,000 to $40,000 have been between four and five months’ imprisonment (see, for example,Public Prosecutor v Suresh K Menon[2015] SGDC 29 andPublic Prosecutor v NurAisyah Binte Churimi[2016] SGDC 172). There appears to have been only one case,Public Prosecutor v Yang Yin[2016] SGDC 264 (“Yang Yin”), which has dealt with misappropriation of sums in excess of $1m. In that case, a Chinese tour guide preyed on the vulnerability of an elderly lady. He was charged with two charges of misappropriating, for his own benefit, sums of $500,000 and $600,000 respectively, which he pleaded guilty to after a number of days of trial. The district judge sentenced the accused to 32 months’ imprisonment and 40 months’ imprisonment on the respective charges, and ordered that both sentences run consecutively to give a total term of imprisonment of six years. It may be noted that the district judge considered that there were a dearth of mitigating factors (at [83]). In contrast, the aggravating factors included the accused’s deep betrayal of the extreme trust reposed in him, a substantial degree of planning and premeditation, cunning deceptions to avoid detection, lack of remorse, near total depletion of the victim’s assets and a failure to make restitution. On appeal, Tay JA increased the sentences imposed, raising the total sentence to nine years’ imprisonment. In delivering his oral judgment on 3 March 2017 inPublic Prosecutor v Yang Yin(Magistrate’s Appeal No 9238 of 2016/01, unreported), Tay JA noted that while the district judge took the various aggravating factors into account, he failed to accord these factors the weight they deserved in the circumstances. Though the present case is certainly some considerable distance away from the accused’s egregious conduct inYang Yin, that case is a useful example of the sentences imposed in cases where the conduct in question is deplorable and substantial sums are involved. 397 Bearing in mind the above precedents, we turn to consider the sham investment charges. In this regard, the total sum involved in the sham investment charges – $24m – is certainly high. At the same time, this must be balanced against the significant mitigating circumstances which we have detailed above (at [370], [376]–[377]). Taking into account the precedents (none of which is really germane given the unique nature of this case), the aggravating and mitigating factors and the need for general deterrence, in our view, the starting points for the custodial sentences to be imposed on the appellants are as follows: (a)12 months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $10m which relates to the Xtron bonds; (b)12 months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $3m which also relates to the Xtron bonds; and (c)two years’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $11m which relates to the Firna bonds. 398 We should state for the avoidance of doubt that in deriving the starting points above (as well as those for the round-tripping and account falsification charges below), we have in mind a single offender with the attributes and factors that we have discussed above, and who committed the offences by himself. Given that the offences here were committed not by a single person but by the appellants as part of a conspiracy, and as the appellants have varying degrees of culpability, we will go on, in a later section of this judgment (from [418] onwards), to consider the appropriate custodial sentence that should be imposed on the each of the appellantsvis-à-visthe starting points for each of the offences, bearing in mind their specific roles in the criminal enterprise and, in turn, their culpability. Sentencing considerations in relation to the round-tripping charges 399 The sentencing considerations in respect of the round-tripping charges are, in general, similar to those involving the sham investment charges. In respect of the round-tripping charges involving Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF, both the Judge and the Prosecution recognised that these charges involve “a significantly lower degree of culpability” than the sham investment charges (at [52] of the Sentencing GD). 400 In line with this, the Prosecution has not appealed against the sentences concerning these two charges, where the Judge imposed a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment per charge on Eng Han, 12 months’ imprisonment on Ye Peng and Sharon, and nine months’ imprisonment on Serina. However, the Prosecution submits that the sentence for the round-tripping charge relating to the payment of $15.2m under the ARLA ought to be increased from the existing range of one to two years’ imprisonment to four to five years’ imprisonment. The appellants, on the other hand, submit that all the sentences imposed for the round-tripping charges are manifestly excessive. 401 Like the sham investment charges, the round-tripping charges have been reduced from the more serious offence of CBT as a professional agent under s 409 of the Penal Code to CBTsimpliciterunder s 406 of the Penal Code. This therefore requires us, irrespective of the appeals, to recalibrate the appropriate sentencing range for the round-tripping charges. 402 We first consider the round-tripping charges relating to Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF. Specifically, these charges concern (a) the transfer of $5.8m from the BF to AMAC as a purported investment in Tranche 10 of the SOF, and (b) the transfer of $5.6m from the GF to AMAC as a purported investment in Tranche 11 of the SOF. Both sums were round-tripped through various entities, including Firna, back to CHC. This created the impression that the Firna bonds (worth $11m) were redeemed by Firna with interest. 403 The sentences which the Judge imposed for these charges were substantially lower than those he imposed for the sham investment charges. This was justified on the basis that the inherent nature of these transactions would not result in CHC suffering permanent financial loss. Indeed, the transactions were structured for the very purpose of moving $11.4m out of CHC andreturningalmost the same amount back to CHC within a very short time through the redemption of the Firna bonds. Whatever remained outstanding was also intended to be returned back to CHC subsequently, during the second cycle of the round-tripping transactions involving the payment of sums under the ARLA. The Prosecution accepts this, but submits that the sting of the offences lies in the fact that through the appellants’ actions, the false appearance that the Firna bonds had genuinely been redeemed was created. 404 We agree with the Judge and the Prosecution. Although each charge involves a large amount of more than $5m, it is inherent in the nature of the transactions that the appellants had not intended to cause CHC to suffer financial loss, and in fact, the sums were returned (albeit under a different label) a few days after they had been transferred out of CHC. On this basis, we find that there should be a substantial discount in the sentences as compared with the sham investment charges. Furthermore, as the charges have been reduced from being under s 409 of the Penal Code to under s 406 of the Penal Code, we consider that the appropriate starting point for the custodial sentences to be imposed on the appellants in respect of the first two round-tripping offences isnine months’ imprisonmenteach. 405 Turning to the round-tripping charge involving the payment of $15.2m under the ARLA, we note first that there is a large difference between what the Prosecution seeks and what was meted out by the Judge. We also note that the sentence which the Prosecution is seekingvis-à-visthe round-tripping ARLA charge is much greater than the sentences which it considers appropriate for the charges concerning Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF (which it hence did not appeal against). The Prosecution submits that the difference is warranted because unlike the round-tripping charges involving the SOF tranches (ie, the fourth and fifth charges), the sixth charge involves an actual loss that would have been caused to CHC had the ARLA not been later rescinded. This actual loss comprises (a) $3.2m that was paid out as GST; and (b) $545,000 that was left in Xtron. 406 The Judge, who imposed a slightly higher sentence in respect of the round-tripping ARLA charge than the other two round-tripping charges, must have clearly agreed with the Prosecution that the conduct underlying that charge was more egregious that the other two round-tripping charges. However, what he did not agree with was that it wasthat much moreegregious that it should warrant such a significant increase in the sentence. We generally agree with the Judge in this regard. While we accept that a possible loss of between $3m and $4m is no doubt significant, we do not think that that warrants such a significant increase of one to twoyears’imprisonment in terms of the sentences to be imposed for the round-tripping ARLA charge as opposed to the charges in respect of Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF. 407 In our view, the sting of the ARLA charge is two-fold. First, the payment of $15.2m under the ARLA charge is part of the round-tripping transactions which sought to perpetuate the false impression that Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF had been repaid. Second, in order to create the false impression that the ARLA was a genuine agreement for advance rental, the appellants were willing to allow CHC to pay $3.2m in GST which would have represented actual loss to CHC if the ARLA had not later been rescinded. Besides these, it must also be recalled that the ARLA was the mechanism that the appellants used to redeem the Xtron bonds. As there was risk of the loss of the funds (and hence an element of recklessness involved), we think that it is appropriate to take reference from the starting point for the second sham investment charge (which involved the misappropriation of $3m under the Xtron bonds). We have observed above (at [397(b)]) that the starting point for this charge ought to be 12 months’ imprisonment. The sum representing the loss in respect of the round-tripping ARLA charge is slightly more than $3m and, in our view, this charge is also somewhat more aggravated than the second sham investment charge because (a) the appellants knew that some measure of loss would result to CHC and (b) this loss would have been caused in the context of the perpetration of a scheme to cover up the unauthorised Firna bonds. In the round, we therefore consider that the starting point for the sentence in respect of the round-tripping ARLA charge ought to be16 months’ imprisonment.",
        "The account falsification charges": "408 We move on next to the account falsification charges, which involve the false accounting entries for (a) the payment of $5.8m for Tranche 10 of the SOF; (b) the payment of $5.6m for Tranche 11 of the SOF; (c) the set-off of $21.5m in Xtron bonds; and (d) the payment of over $15.2m as the cash component of the ARLA. The Judge imposed three months’ imprisonment on Eng Han, Ye Peng and Sharon and a slightly lower sentence of two months’ imprisonment on Serina for each of the four account falsification charges. 409 The appellants argue that the sentences for the account falsification charges are manifestly excessive. Sharon and Serina, in particular, argue that the Judge should have imposed a fine instead of a custodial sentence for the charges. The Prosecution, on the other hand, argues that the sentences imposed are manifestly inadequate because (a) the starting point for the sentences should be six months’ imprisonment (instead of three months as adopted by the Judge); and (b) the charge involving the set-off of $21.5m worth of Xtron bonds against the ARLA should attract a higher sentence of nine months’ imprisonment because the set-off was essentially a disguised write-off of the Xtron bonds which would have caused an outright loss to CHC if not for the subsequent rescission of the ARLA. 410 We begin by considering the arguments raised by the appellants, who rely on the cases ofChua Li Hoon Matilda and others v Public Prosecutor[2009] SGHC 116 (“Matilda Chua”) andPhang Wah. They take issue with the fact that the Judge had not considered or addressed these cases in the Sentencing GD. They argue that the Judge should have followed these sentencing precedents, where a fine had been imposed for the offences of account falsification even though the offenders there had been motivated by, and had obtained, a direct benefit as a result of the offences. They submit that,a fortiori, the account falsification charges in the present case ought to only attract a fine since they had no intention to benefit from the acts of falsification. 411 In our view, neitherMatilda ChuanorPhang Wahassists the appellants. The cases do not stand for the proposition or sentencing principle that all (or even most) of the charges under s 477A of the Penal Code will attract only a fine. In any event, this would be wholly inconsistent with the sentencing range set out in s 477A, which provides for a maximum punishment of ten years’ imprisonment with fine. The sentencing range itself clearly shows that Parliament must have intended and envisaged that imprisonment terms could and should be imposed for the offence if the circumstances call for such a sentence. A custodial term has also been meted out for this offence in many cases (seeeg,Tan Puay Boon v Public Prosecutor[2003] 3 SLR(R) 390 (“Tan Puay Boon”),Goh Kah Heng,Public Prosecutor v Loke Chee Kwong[2012] SGDC 334,Public Prosecutor v Noriza Binte Aziz[2015] SGDC 157 andPublic Prosecutor v Chew Soo Chun[2015] SGDC 22). 412 In the light of the applicable sentencing range and the precedents cited, the appellants would have to do more than simply raise two precedents where fines had been meted out to convince us that the custodial threshold has not been crossed in the present case. This is especially so given that the facts of these two cases bear little, if any, similarity to the present. For instance, the false accounts inMatilda Chuahad not been “foisted on the public at large or on any group of particularly vulnerable individuals” (seePublic Prosecutor v Mathilda Chua Li Hoon and others[2008] SGDC 290 at [145]). InPhang Wah, the recipient of the funds had been falsely stated in the accounts so as to reduce the actual recipient’s liability to be taxed. While this involved a fraud on the revenue, the amounts involved were not substantial and there was a lack of sophistication on the offenders’ part (seePublic Prosecutor v Phang Wah and others[2010] SGDC 505 at [346]). On appeal, Tay J agreed with this and further noted that there had been no attempt by the offenders to conceal thepurposeof the falsification (at [86]). On these facts, Tay J considered that the fines imposed by the district judge were neither manifestly excessive nor manifestly inadequate. 413 Such mitigating circumstances are not present here. The purpose of the falsification of the accounts was to create the false impression that Xtron and Firna had fulfilled their obligations to CHC. Apart from the appellants, there had certainly been no disclosure of these acts of deceptions to other persons. The offences involved deceiving not only CHC’s auditors, but also the EMs and those general members of CHC who had perused the accounts. Furthermore, the underlying transactions were complex and involved millions of dollars. In our judgment, given these facts, the custodial threshold in respect of the account falsification charges has been crossed. 414 This leaves us to consider whether there is merit to the Prosecution’s submission that the sentences imposed for the account falsification charges are manifestlyinadequate. The Prosecution refers to the decision ofTan Puay Boon, where Yong CJ set out (at [47]) two important factors to consider in sentencing offenders under s 477A. These factors are (a) whether there was deviousness or surreptitious planning; and (b) whether the falsifications were committed for one’s personal gain. The Prosecution argues that both these factors are present in this case because (a) the account falsification offences were an integral part of a complex scheme to defraud the auditors and remove the bonds that were the subject of the sham investment charges; and (b) the scheme was entirely a self-serving enterprise on the part of Ye Peng, Serina and Eng Han, who were involved in the sham investment transactions, to ensure that their earlier wrongdoing would not be revealed.200Foot Note 200×Prosecution’s submissions on sentence at para 179. 415 The Prosecution also relies on the decision inGoh Kah Heng, where the first offender who was a head of a charity falsified a payment voucher to cover up the fact that an unauthorised loan of $50,000 had been made out of the charity’s funds to the second offender. The offenders were sentenced to an imprisonment term of six and seven months for their s 477A charges (which were read with s 109 of the Penal Code) respectively. Relying on the above, the Prosecution submits that the starting point of six months’ imprisonment is warranted in the present case. As stated above at [409], the Prosecution also submits that the account falsification charge concerning the set-off of the Xtron bonds with the sums payable under the ARLA ought to attract a higher sentence of nine months’ imprisonment to reflect that if not for the subsequent rescission of the ARLA, this set-off would have caused an outright loss to CHC. 416 We do not see any reason to disturb the starting point ofthree months’ imprisonmentthat the Judge had imposed for the account falsification charges. While the account falsification offences involved careful planning and allowed the appellants to remove the questionable Xtron and Firna bonds from CHC’s books, it is also important to bear in mind that the offenders were not motivated by financial gain and had in fact also made no gain (unlike inGoh Kah Heng). Moreover, as the falsification of the accounts was an integral part of the round-tripping offences and these acts were in essence part of the same criminal enterprise, the court must be cautious to ensure that the appellants are not doubly punished. 417 We also do not agree with the Prosecution that there is a need to impose a higher sentence for the account falsification charge that relates to the set-off of $21.5m. While this charge involves a considerably higher amount than the other account falsification charges and essentially amounted to a write-off of the Xtron bonds, this outcome was part and parcel of the appellants’ plans under the ARLA and some of the considerations relating to the ARLA have already been dealt with when sentencing the appellants for the round-tripping ARLA charge (see [407] above). In our view, the account falsification charges are largely consequential.",
        "Conclusion on the appeals against conviction": "342 For the reasons above, the respective appeals against conviction are dismissed, save for the reduction of the CBT Charges from the aggravated charge of CBT under s 409 of the Penal Code to a charge of CBTsimpliciterunder s 406 of the Penal Code.",
        "Part II: The appeals against sentence": "343 We come now to the appeals against sentence. The appellants appeal on the basis that the sentences imposed on them by the Judge are manifestly excessive. They highlight, in particular, that they neither received personal gain nor caused permanent loss to CHC. The Prosecution has cross-appealed, arguing that the sentences imposed by the Judge are manifestly inadequate and that the Judge failed to give due weight to the fact that massive amounts of charity funds were misappropriated through numerous complex and sophisticated transactions which were designed to obscure the true nature of the misappropriations. The Prosecution also argues that the Judge placed too much emphasis on the mitigating factors than was warranted in the light of all the circumstances of the case.",
        "The decision below on sentence": "General deterrence is the key sentencing principle 344 While the Judge held that general deterrence should underpin the court’s sentencing approach, he also found that: (a) deterrence does not necessarily entail the imposition of a disproportionately crushing sentence, and that given the present factual context, the mere prospect of a criminal conviction already carries some deterrent value (the Sentencing GD at [34]); and (b) there is less force for general deterrence in cases like the present where there is no direct personal gain or intention of such gain. This, he explained, is because a deterrent sentence presumes that an accused is capable of rational reasoning and in a case without personal gain, the offender is not incentivised or enticed by the prospect of gain so it is not entirely clear how a heavy-handed sentence in the name of deterrence might influence his reasoning (the Sentencing GD at [35]). 345 It was (and is) not disputed that the principle ofspecificdeterrence was not relevant in this case as there was virtually negligible risk of any of the appellants reoffending (the Sentencing GD at [33]). Aggravating factors 346 The Judge accepted the Prosecution’s position that the following aggravating features were present: (a) misuse of a huge sum of charity funds; (b) betrayal of a high degree of trust reposed in the appellants as CHC’s leaders; (c) manipulation and exploitation of CHC’s culture of secrecy and deference to formal authority; (d) deliberate deception and circumvention of governance through covert measures and cover stories; and (e) planning and premeditation to avoid detection and to frustrate investigative efforts. 347 The Judge held that some of these factors were weightier than others. The primary aggravating factor, in his judgment, was that the offences involved the misuse of massive amounts of donations from members that were received and held by CHC. He found that the breach of trust in the present case was “all the more egregious” given that some of the appellants were trusted leaders and senior members of CHC, and were duty-bound to act with the utmost integrity and accountability (the Sentencing GD at [8]). He also placed emphasis on the culture of absolute and unquestioning trust in CHC that Kong Hee (and some of the rest, such as Ye Peng) had built and subsequently abused. While he had characterised the appellants – save for Kong Hee – as being both “trusted and trusting”, he was quick to emphasise that they were not just blind followers but were the leaders and part of the most trusted inner circle of CHC, who had chosen to support the endeavour with “enthusiasm, resourcefulness and not a small measure of guile” (the Sentencing GD at [12]). 348 The Judge observed that there was extensive evidence of manipulation, deception and concealment in order to carry out the planned and premeditated wrongful schemes to systematically misuse CHC’s funds. He noted too that it took a long time to expose the dishonest schemes because of the appellants’ active concealment of their tracks, their fabrication of misleading cover stories and the careful cultivation of a climate of unquestioning trust within CHC (the Sentencing GD at [16]). Mitigating factors 349 As for mitigating factors, the Judge accepted that the following should be given weight, and that consequently the case is “some distance away” from the precedents cited by the Prosecution which mainly involved accused persons with profiteering motives: (a) the appellants enjoyed no personal gain from the offences; (b) no permanent loss was caused to CHC; (c) the funds were used for the Crossover, which was a “church purpose”; (d) the monies were subsequently returned; and (e) the appellants had done much good in their role as church leaders and workers. The Judge noted that while the return of the monies ought to count in the appellants’ favour, the weight that ought to be given to this must be discounted by the fact that their motivation for restitution cannot be regarded as being purelybona fideas it was to avoid detection (the Sentencing GD at [27]). 350 The Judge also took cognisance of the fact that the Crossover had the support of the majority of the members of CHC, even though he equally noted that the extent of the support must be understood in the context of what wasnotmade known to the members. In this regard, he also noted that the BF, where most of the funds had been misappropriated from, was an accumulation of donations that were specifically contributed for the purpose of purchasing or securing a building for the use of CHC’s members. There was no evidence that the donors would have all agreed to the diversion of the funds to the Crossover, though the Judge accepted that a number of CHC’s members did continue to express their support for the Crossover even after the full facts had been brought to light (the Sentencing GD at [23]). 351 In the Judge’s view, the case was therefore one which was “unique”. Compared with the typical precedents where “avarice, self-interest and personal enrichment often feature heavily” (the Sentencing GD at [26]), the Judge emphasised that this case concerned a situation where there was lack of personal gain and motive of self-enrichment, no permanent loss caused to the victim, and the return of the monies in full to the victim. Decision in respect of the sham investment charges 352 The Judge declined to place much weight on the sentencing precedents provided by the Prosecution given the unique nature of this case. In his judgment, it was unhelpful to anchor the inquiry by looking at the very high sentences that had been imposed in certain cases where a large amount of money had been misappropriated, and then working downwards from them and apply a “discount” to factor in the lack of personal gain. This approach, in his view, placed too much emphasis on the amount of money misappropriated and skewed the sentencing enquiry in that direction (the Sentencing GD at [46]). 353 The Judge found the district court case ofJoachim Kang Hock Chai v Public Prosecutor(DAC 15621 of 2003, unreported) (“Joachim Kang”) to be a “relevant reference point” though “certainly not a benchmark” (the Sentencing GD at [49]). The offender there was a priest who had misappropriated $5.1m worth of church monies entirely for personal gain. Nineteen charges of the offence of CBTsimpliciterunder s 406 of the 1985 revised edition of Penal Code were brought against him. Six charges were proceeded with and 13 charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The offender was sentenced to a global imprisonment term of seven years and six months upon his eventual plea of guilt after 13 days of trial. 354 Extrapolating fromJoachim Kangwhilst bearing in mind the unique nature of the present case, the Judge held that: (a) The sentences that should be imposed on Kong Hee for the three sham investment charges should be five, three and five years’ imprisonment respectively. The second and third charges were to run consecutively, making the total sentence eight years’ imprisonment. In this regard, the Judge found Kong Hee, who was the overall leader and the driver of the efforts to use the BF to fund the Crossover, the most culpable of the appellants (the Sentencing GD at [49]). (b) As for Ye Peng, Eng Han and Serina, the sentences were lowered slightly because they were ultimately following the vision and direction set by Kong Hee, their spiritual leader. Their sentences were four, two and four years’ imprisonment for the three sham investment charges respectively (the Sentencing GD at [50]). Ye Peng, Eng Han and Serina also faced the round-tripping and account falsification charges, and the sentences that were ordered by the Judge to run consecutively are set out at [360] below. (c) Finally, the Judge found John Lam the least culpable as he was much less involved in the conspiracy as compared to the other appellants. He thus sentenced John Lam to two, one and two years’ imprisonment for the charges. The Judge ordered the sentences for the second and third charges to run consecutively, making his total sentence three years’ imprisonment (the Sentencing GD at [51]). Decision in respect of the round-tripping charges and account falsification charges 355  The Judge considered the latter two categories of charges together as he regarded them as being part of the same overall criminality. In his judgment, these charges involved a significantly lower degree of culpability than the sham investment charges because the net effect of the transactions was that certain debts would be substituted by another obligation, and there was thus no attempt to extinguish any debts owed to CHC. However, the Judge noted that the round-tripping charge that involved the payment of $15.2m under the ARLA ought to be viewed more seriously because it comprised of a payment of some $3.2m purportedly as GST, which would have representedactualloss to CHC had the ARLA not been rescinded and the monies, including the GST, subsequently been returned (the Sentencing GD at [52]–[53]). 356 In terms of culpability, he found Eng Han, who had devised and structured the round-tripping transactions, to be the most culpable. He considered Ye Peng and Sharon to be of an equal level of culpability. Though Sharon was not a leader in CHC, she was more involved in the transactions. The reverse applied for Ye Peng; he was in a position of greater leadership and responsibility though he was less involved in these transactions. Finally, he found Serina to be least culpable because her involvement in the round-tripping transactions was arguably as minimal as Ye Peng, but she did not stand in the same leadership role as him (the Sentencing GD at [54]). 357 Based on the above, the Judge imposed the following sentences: (a) In relation to Eng Han: (i) 15 months’ imprisonment for each of the two round-tripping charges concerning the misappropriation of CHC’s funds in relation to Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF; (ii) two years’ imprisonment for the round-tripping charge concerning the misappropriation of CHC’s funds pursuant to payment made under the ARLA; and (iii) three months’ imprisonment for each of the four account falsification charges. (b) In relation to Sharon and Ye Peng: (i) 12 months’ imprisonment for each of the two round-tripping charges concerning the misappropriation of CHC’s funds in relation to Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF; (ii) 18 months’ imprisonment for the round-tripping charge concerning the misappropriation of CHC’s funds pursuant to payment made under the ARLA; and (iii) three months’ imprisonment for each of the four account falsification charges. (c) In relation to Serina: (i) nine months’ imprisonment for each of the two round-tripping charges concerning the misappropriation of CHC’s funds in relation to Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF; (ii) one year’s imprisonment for the round-tripping charge concerning the misappropriation of CHC’s funds pursuant to payment made under the ARLA; and (iii) a slightly lower sentence of two (as opposed to three) months’ imprisonment for each of the four account falsification charges. 358 Notably, in coming to his decision in this regard, the Judge did not place much weight on precedents. In fact, he did not refer to any precedents, save as to juxtapose the sentences imposed for the round-tripping charges with those imposed for the sham investment charges. Total sentence 359 For Ye Peng, Serina, and Eng Han who each faced a total of ten charges, the Prosecution had submitted (and submits) that at least three charges ought to run consecutively to reflect their enhanced culpability in having participated in two distinct sets of conspiracies. The Judge was not persuaded, and was instead of the view that the key question was whether the totality of the sentence fairly and accurately reflected the overall culpability of each offender. He held that the notion of having participated in two criminal enterprises would be appropriately reflected by running the longest sentence imposed for the sham investment charges consecutively with the longest sentence imposed for the round-tripping charges (the Sentencing GD at [59]–[60]). 360 With that, the total sentence received by each of the appellants was as follows: (a) Kong Hee: eight years’ imprisonment (the sentences for the second and third sham investment charges of three and five years’ imprisonment respectively running consecutively); (b) John Lam: three years’ imprisonment (the sentences for the second and third sham investment charges of one and two years’ imprisonment respectively running consecutively); (c) Eng Han: six years’ imprisonment (the sentences for the third sham investment charge relating to the Firna bonds and the round-tripping charge relating to the ARLA of four and two years’ imprisonment respectively running consecutively); (d) Ye Peng: five years and six months’ imprisonment (the sentences for the third sham investment charge relating to the Firna bonds and the round-tripping charge relating to the ARLA of four years and 18 months’ imprisonment respectively running consecutively); (e) Serina: five years’ imprisonment (the sentences for the third sham investment charge relating to the Firna bonds and the round-tripping charge relating to the ARLA of four and one years’ imprisonment respectively running consecutively); and (f) Sharon: 21 months’ imprisonment (the sentences for the round-tripping charge relating to the ARLA and the account falsification charge concerning Tranche 10 of the SOF of 18 months and three months’ imprisonment respectively running consecutively). 361 Having summarised the Judge’s decision on sentence, we turn to consider the appeals on sentence, starting with the sentences in respect of the CBT Charges.",
        "Sentences in respect of each of the appellants": "418 With that, we turn to consider the appropriate individual and aggregate sentences for each of the appellants, beginning with Kong Hee. Kong Hee 419 Kong Hee argues that the Judge had breached the principles of proportionality and parity in imposing the highest sentence on him when he, together with John Lam, was convicted of the least number of charges and had not been privy or involved in the second conspiracy involving the round-tripping charges. He argues that even though he was the spiritual leader and the one who came up with the Crossover, this must be distinguished from a situation where a person is the mastermind of a criminal enterprise. He submits that there is no reason to single him out; he did not formulate the idea of utilising the Xtron and Firna bonds. 420 We agree with the Judge that Kong Hee’s overall culpability and criminality are the greatest of the appellants. Kong Hee was the ultimate leader both of the Crossover and the appellants and it was he who provided the appellants with the overall direction and moral assurance for their actions. He was also the one who instilled the appellants with the confidence in the mission of the Crossover and Sun Ho’s ability to be successful in the US. While we accept that Kong Hee neither directed nor participated in the conspiracy to redeem the bonds, it cannot escape our notice that the round-tripping transactions would not have been necessary if the Xtron and Firna bonds had never been entered into in the first place. It is clear from the circumstances of this case that Kong Hee was one of the main players – if notthemain player – who had set things in motion in relation to the sham investment charges where he had directed and influenced the other appellants, in particular Eng Han, to come up with plans when increased funding for the Crossover was needed. Kong Hee’s role as the spiritual leader of the other appellants, and the breach of trustvis-à-visnot just CHC but also the other appellants whom he led and mentored, ought to be reflected in the sentences imposed. 421 Given Kong Hee’s role in the entire scheme, we are of the view that sentences slightly above the starting points ought to be meted out on the charges preferred against him. We sentence him as follows: (a)14 months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $10m which relates to the Xtron bonds; (b)14 months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $3m which also relates to the Xtron bonds; and (c)28 months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $11m which relates to the Firna bonds. We order that the sentences for the second and third charges are to run consecutively, with the remaining sentence to run concurrently, making the total sentence for Kong Heean imprisonment term of three years and six months. John Lam 422 John Lam seeks to rely on the arguments raised by the other appellants on the issue of sentencing, and argues only that the Judge was correct to have considered him the least involved in the sham investment transactions. 423 The Prosecution submits that the Judge should not have pegged John Lam’s culpability at a level lower than that of Serina, Eng Han and Ye Peng as his participation was integral to the success of the conspiracy.201Foot Note 201×Prosecution’s submissions on sentence at paras 162–165.In this regard, the Prosecution argues that John Lam was the “inside man” who occupied key positions of financial responsibility as treasurer, a member of the Investment Committee and Audit Committee, and points to the fact that he had (a) drafted the investment policy that ensured that the Xtron bonds would fall within the mandate given to AMAC; (b) consented to hiding information from Charlie Lay, a fellow Investment Committee member; and (c) drafted and signed the “secret letter”, without which Wahju’s father-in-law would not have agreed to enter into the Firna BSA. 424 We do not agree with the Prosecution. In our judgment, the culpability of John Lam, who was involved to a relatively limited (though important) extent and only at some junctures, is lower than that of Serina, Eng Han and Ye Peng. His sentences should be below the starting points set out at [397] above. We sentence him as follows: (a)six months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $10m which relates to the Xtron bonds; (b)six months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $3m which also relates to the Xtron bonds; and (c)12 months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $11m which relates to the Firna bonds. We order that the sentences for the second and third charges are to run consecutively, with the remaining sentence to run concurrently, making the total sentence for John Laman imprisonment term ofone year andsix months. Eng Han 425 As for Eng Han, we are of the view that his sentences should follow the respective starting points that we have set out above. Eng Han employed his wits and financial expertise to mask therealityof the transactions. Although he was not a spiritual leader of CHC, he was trusted when it came to financial matters. It is therefore appropriate to sentence him as if he had single-handedly committed the various offences. We thus sentence him as follows: (a)12 months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $10m which relates to the Xtron bonds; (b)12 months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $3m which also relates to the Xtron bonds; (c)two years’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $11m which relates to the Firna bonds; (d)nine months’ imprisonmentfor the round-tripping charge that relates to Tranche 10 of the SOF; (e)nine months’ imprisonmentfor the round-tripping charge that relates to Tranche 11 of the SOF; (f)16 months’ imprisonmentfor the round-tripping charge that relates to the payment of $15.2m under the ARLA; and (g)three months’ imprisonmentfor each of the four account falsification charges. 426 A further issue remains in respect of Eng Han (as well as Ye Peng and Serina). The Prosecution submits that the Judge erred in not running three sentences consecutively in respect of Eng Han, Ye Peng and Serina even though they faced a total of ten charges and were involved in two separate conspiracies. In this regard, the Judge held that the key question was whether the totality of the sentence fairly and accurately reflected the overall culpability of the offender, and was of the view that the notion of them having participated in two criminal enterprises would be appropriately reflected by running the longest sentence for the sham investment charges consecutively with the longest sentence for the round-tripping charges. 427 The Prosecution submits that this approach is wrong and illogical, and as a result, the sentences imposed on these appellants fail to reflect their greater level of criminality in that unlike the rest, they participated in two sets of conspiracies. It submits that the Judge’s error is apparent when one considers that these three appellants would have each received cumulative sentences of six years’ imprisonment under the Judge’s sentencing rubric (with the second and third sham investment charges running consecutively, as in the case of Kong Hee and John Lam), if they hadonlybeen convicted of the sham investment charges. In essence, the Prosecution argues that it is illogical and perverse that the fact that these appellants have been convicted of a second conspiracy has no effect or actually leaves the appellants in a betterposition than if they had only been involved in a single conspiracy. Simply put, the appellants appeared to have gained or paid no additional penalty for having committed more crimes. 428 We are of the view that it is appropriate to run two of the sentences consecutively. We agree with the Judge that running two of the longest sentences consecutively for Eng Han, Ye Peng and Serina would fairly reflect their relative culpability, and would be proportionate to the offences for which they have been convicted. Moreover, we note that the total sentence imposed on Eng Han would be more than the total sentence he would have received if he was only convicted of the sham investment charges; this addresses the nub of the Prosecution’s submissions. We will therefore run the sentences of the third sham investment charge (at [425(c)] above) and the third round-tripping charge (at [425(f)] above) consecutively. The other sentences are to run concurrently. The total sentence for Eng Han will thus bean imprisonment term of three years and four months. Ye Peng 429 As for Ye Peng, we are of the view that his sentences for the sham investment charges should be pitched at the starting points which have been set out above. Like Kong Hee, he was a spiritual leader in CHC though the trust and authority reposed in him by CHC’s members was not as great as those reposed in Kong Hee. We do not see any other aggravating or mitigating factors peculiar to Ye Peng that would warrant a departure from the starting point in respect of the sham investment offences. 430 However, we would impose slightly lower sentences than the starting points for Ye Peng’s round-tripping and account falsification charges. As we have explained, the mastermind behind the round-tripping transactions was Eng Han and a discount ought to be reflected in Ye Peng’s sentence to account for that. We thus impose the following sentences on him: (a)12 months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $10m which relates to the Xtron bonds; (b)12 months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $3m which also relates to the Xtron bonds; (c)two years’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $11m which relates to the Firna bonds; (d)eight months’ imprisonmentfor the round-tripping charge that relates to Tranche 10 of the SOF; (e)eight months’ imprisonmentfor the round-tripping charge that relates to Tranche 11 of the SOF; (f)14 months’ imprisonmentfor the round-tripping charge that relates to the payment of $15.2m under the ARLA; and (g)two months’ imprisonmentfor each of the four account falsification charges. As in the case of Eng Han, we order that the sentences for the third sham investment charge and the third round-tripping charge are to run consecutively. The other sentences are to run concurrently. The total sentence for Ye Peng would thus bean imprisonment term of three years and two months. Serina 431 Turning to Serina, we agree with the Judge that her sentences in respect of the CBT Charges should generally be lower than those imposed on the others because she was less culpable. Unlike Kong Hee and Ye Peng, Serina was not a spiritual leader of the church. While she was the administrator of the Crossover and helped out with the accounts and the documentation, she is less culpable than Eng Han as she did not devise the illicit bonds or the round-tripping transactions. Thus, we impose sentences for Serina in respect of the sham investment charges below the starting points set out above and peg Serina’s sentences for the round-tripping charges to slightly below those that we imposed in respect of Ye Peng. We see no reason to disturb the sentences imposed on her by the Judge for the account falsification charges. We therefore sentence her as follows: (a)nine months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 1985 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $10m which relates to the Xtron bonds; (b)nine months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $3m which also relates to the Xtron bonds; (c)18 months’ imprisonmentfor the sham investment charge under the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code for the misappropriation of $11m which relates to the Firna bonds; (d)six months’ imprisonmentfor the round-tripping charge that relates to Tranche 10 of the SOF; (e)six months’ imprisonmentfor the round-tripping charge that relates to Tranche 11 of the SOF; (f)12 months’ imprisonmentfor the round-tripping charge that relates to the payment of $15.2m under the ARLA; and (g)two months’ imprisonmentfor each of the four account falsification charges. As in the case for Eng Han and Ye Peng, the sentences for the third sham investment charge and the third round-tripping charge are to run consecutively. The other sentences are to run concurrently, making the total sentence for Serinaan imprisonment term of two years and six months. Sharon 432 We turn finally to Sharon. Sharon submits that the Judge was wrong to have found that she wasasculpable as Ye Peng in respect of the round-tripping and the account falsification charges and should instead have found her to be less culpable than all the appellants because of the following reasons: (a) First, she played a minimal role in the round-tripping transactions. She emphasises that she was a mere follower and did not initiate any of the proposals. (b) Second, she highlights that her motives were fundamentally different from the other appellants as she was the only one whose involvement did not extend to the sham investment charges. As such, unlike the other appellants, she cannot be said to have the devious motive of (using the language of the Prosecution in its submissions before the Judge) “ultimately intend[ing] to screen the Xtron and Firna bonds from further inquiry, in order to avoid detection of their sham nature”.202Foot Note 202×Prosecution’s submissions on sentence at para 123.In essence, her point is that given her unique position of not being tainted by the sham investment charges, she should logically be in a position of lower culpability than the others. (c) Third, she relies on the fact that she was never a leader in CHC, and therefore the Judge’s “damning indictments” against some of the appellants’ “careful cultivation of unquestioning trust within CHC” cannot apply to her.203Foot Note 203×Sharon’s submissions at para 268(f). 433 We are persuaded by Sharon’s submissions, in particular by the fact that she was at no point a leader of CHC, the Crossover or the illegal transactions. For this reason, we agree with Sharon that her culpability in respect of the round-tripping and the account falsification charges should not be pegged to that of Ye Peng. While she may have been more directly involved in the round-tripping transactions than he was, the fact remains that she was only an employee, and was merely carrying out the decisions and instructions of the decision-makers in CHC. Therefore, in respect of both categories of charges, we sentence her to a considerably lower sentence than the other appellants. Her sentences are as follows: (a)three months’ imprisonmentfor the round-tripping charge that relates to Tranche 10 of the SOF; (b)three months’ imprisonmentfor the round-tripping charge that relates to Tranche 11 of the SOF; (c)six months’ imprisonmentfor the round-tripping charge that relates to the payment of $15.2m under the ARLA; and (d)one month’s imprisonmentfor each of the other four account falsification charges. 434 We order that the most severe round-tripping charge is to run consecutively with the first account falsification charge. Like the Judge, we do not think there is a need to run two of the most severe sentences consecutively in the case of Sharon. Unlike the other appellants (namely, Eng Han, Serina and Ye Peng) who had participated in two distinct conspiracies, Sharon had participated in only one (ie, the round-tripping transactions for which the acts of account falsification were consequential to). The other sentences are to run concurrently. The total sentence for Sharon will thus bean imprisonment term ofseven months.",
        "Conclusion": "558 For the above reasons, I dismiss the appeals of all the appellants including that of the Prosecution. 559 In the event that I am wrong on the applicability of s 409 of the Penal Code having regard to the facts of this case, and that the correct charges should have been framed under s 406, then I would, as the majority has done, allow the appellants’ appeals against the sentences imposed on themonlyfor the reason that the charges have been reduced from the most serious to the least serious of the four types of CBT offences under the Penal Code. It must be emphasised that the maximum imprisonment term of seven years for the reduced charge of CBTsimpliciterunder s 406 of the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code (and three years under the 1985 revised edition) is only aboutone-thirdof the maximum determinate imprisonment term of 20 years (putting aside the sentence of life imprisonment) that may be imposed for the most serious form of CBT by a public servant, banker, merchant, factor, broker or agent under s 409 of the 2008 revised edition of the Penal Code (and, aside from the sentence of life imprisonment, an imprisonment for a maximum term of ten years under the 1985 revised edition). 560 I note that the majority has more or less halved the overall sentences imposed by the Judge on Kong Hee, John Lam, Ye Peng, Eng Han and Serina. In the case of Sharon, the majority has reduced her overall sentence to one-third of the original sentence. Although I may not entirely share the views of the majority on the various mitigating factors and the weight to be placed on them, nevertheless on the whole, I do not think that the total sentence imposed by the majority on each of the appellants can be regarded as manifestly inadequate when the proper charges are under s 406 and not s 409. Thus, if I were wrong that the CBT Charges should be framed under s 409 of the Penal Code, I would not be minded to disagree with the majority on the total sentence that they have imposed on each of the appellants on the basis of the reduced charges.

        "Introduction": "437 I have the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of the majority of Chao JA, with which Woo J concurs. I refer to this as the majority Judgment. For ease of reference, I adopt the same abbreviations and references used in the majority Judgment, unless otherwise stated. In respect of the CBT Charges, I agree with the majority that (a) the relevant appellants were entrusted with dominion over CHC’s funds; (b) there was “wrong use” of CHC’s funds; and (c) each of the relevant appellants did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with some of the other appellants to commit the offence of CBT by, as stated in the relevant charges, dishonestly misappropriating monies from (i) the BF for the purpose of funding Sun Ho’s music career (and, in respect of the Firna bonds, for the additional purpose of providing funds to Wahju); and (ii) the GF and the BF for the purpose of generating a false appearance that certain purported investments in the Firna bonds had been redeemed. I also agree with the conviction of the relevant appellants where the account falsification charges are concerned. 438 While I agree largely with the majority Judgment, I respectfully depart from the majority in three areas. First, on the law and in respect of the CBT Charges, I do not agree with the holding of the majority that s 409 of the Penal Code applies only to professional agents and that the appellants are accordingly liable only under s 406 of the Penal Code as all of them were not professional agents even though some of them were directors or members of the CHC Management Board (referred to in the majority Judgment as “the CHC Board”) at the material time. 439 Second, on the facts, I respectfully disagree with the majority on two points. The first relates to the majority’s approval of the Judge’s holding that at the time the 1st Xtron BSA was executed in August 2007, the premise upon which Kong Hee, Ye Peng, Eng Han and Serina operated was that Sun Ho’s planned English album was projected to sell only 200,000 copies. In other words, the majority agrees with the Judge that the appellants didnothonestly believe at the time when the appellants entered into the 1st Xtron BSA that the planned English album would be successful and instead knew that the revenue from the projected 200,000 copies would not be sufficient either to redeem the Xtron bonds under the 1st Xtron BSA with interest at maturity or even thereafter should the maturity period be extended by a few years. 440 Although I agree with the majority that the projections viewed as a whole do not strictly show that the 1st Xtron BSA could be redeemed at maturity, I am inclined to believe, having regard to the totality of the evidence, that the projection of 200,000 copies was only the worst-case scenario contemplated by the appellants. I will explain the reasons for my disagreement subsequently, but it suffices to say at this juncture that my view is that the relevant appellants, on a balance of probabilities, did honestly believe, at the time when theyfirstsought external financing for Sun Ho’s English album and later caused CHC to enter into the 1st Xtron BSA, that the album would be successful and they would be able to effect repayment within a few years after the maturity of the bonds from the net profits that they believed could be generated from the album sales and various associated downstream activities arising therefrom. 441 Besides the assessment of the appellants’ mind-sets concerning the success of Sun Ho’s English album across the various transactions, I also differ from the majority on certain mitigating factors which were taken into account. In particular, I am of the view that, contrary to the position taken by the parties including the Prosecution, the impugned transactions in question involved elements of benefit to Kong Hee and Sun Ho and financial loss (including permanent financial loss even after “full restitution”) to CHC. 442 Finally, in the light of my decision on the law and on my assessment of the facts, I – unlike the majority – would not allow the appeals against sentence. 443 I will discuss each of these issuesseriatim.",
        "The entrustment of dominion over CHC’s property to the relevant appellants was “in the way of their business as agents”": "444 The crux of this issue is whether the relevant appellants, namely John Lam, Ye Peng and Kong Hee, who were members of the CHC Management Board, were entrusted with dominion over CHC’s property “in the way of [their] business as … agent[s]” pursuant to s 409 of the Penal Code. The appellants submit that s 409 does not apply to them. Their argument rests on two premises. First, they submit that in the context of s 409 of the Penal Code, the term “agent” refers only to a professional agent. Second, they take the position that directors of a company or organisation are not such professional agents. The appellants base these two premises on the decision of the Privy Council inCoorayand the decision of the Malaysian Court of Appeal inPeriasamy, which adopted the position inCooray. On this basis, they submit that s 409 of the Penal Code cannot apply to them as John Lam, Ye Peng and Kong Hee were not professional agents. 445 In making the above submission, the appellants urge this court to depart from the position inTay Choo Wah, where the High Court held that directors who misappropriate the property of their company may be liable for the offence of CBT as an agent under s 409 of the Penal Code if they were entrusted with such property in their capacity as directors. Against this, the Prosecution argues thatTay Choo Wahshould be followed. It further argues thatCooraycan be distinguished and that, in any event, the reasoning inTay Choo Wahought to be preferred over that inCooray. 446 Given the way the arguments were framed, it is unsurprising that much of the submissions on this issue centred on the correctness of the decision inCooray. However, to centre the issue in question on whether the holding inCoorayis correct and ought to be followed creates, in my view, a false dichotomy. This is because the decision inCoorayin no way bears on the question of whether a director of a company or organisation, being in that capacity entrusted with the property of the company or organisation, can be liable for the aggravated offence of CBT as an agent if he misappropriated that property. To explain why this is so, the facts ofCoorayand the holding of the Privy Council must be closely scrutinised. It is to this that I now turn. 447 The accused inCooraywas the president of the Salpiti Korale Union (“the Union”), which supplied goods to its member societies through three wholesale depots. Member societies would pay for the goods through an advance by the Colombo Cooperative Central Bank (“the Central Bank”), and the member societies would repay the Central Bank weekly by money orders, cheques or small sums of cash, which the Central Bank would then pay into its account with the Bank of Ceylon. Besides being president of the Union, the accused was also the vice-president of the Central Bank and the president of a committee (“the Committee”) that controlled one of the three wholesale depots. In the proper case, payments made to the depot were to be promptly deposited in the Central Bank by the manager of the depot. Additionally, when the Central Bank received such payments in the form of cheques, the Central Bank was to immediately send such cheques to the Bank of Ceylon for collection. 448 Instead of following the prescribed procedure, the accused procured the manager of the depot to collect cash and thereafter hand the monies to him. The accused misappropriated the cash and substituted it with his own cheques which he sent to the Central Bank. Additionally, the accused ensured that certain cheques received by the Central Bank were not sent for collection. The accused was charged with misappropriating a sum of money, entrusted to himby the manager of the depotin the way of the accused’s business as an agent, which was to be deposited to the credit of the Union in the Central Bank. 449 Before the Privy Council, the accused argued that he was not a professional agent and could not be caught by s 392 of the Ceylon Penal Code (which isinpari materiawith s 409 of the Penal Code) as he had only beencasuallyentrusted with money. Against this, the Crown argued that the section applied to anyone acting in thecapacityof an agent, whether professional or otherwise. Notably, the Crown contended that, on the facts, the accused was an agent because he had been entrusted with the monies by the manager of the depot “to act as [the manager’s] agent and as agent of the Union to take the moneys to the bank” and that the reason why the manager entrusted the monies to the accused was because he was the president of the Union (at 412). 450 The Privy Council disagreed with the Crown, holding that, on the facts ofCooray, the accused was clearly not carrying on the business of an agent and “was in no sense entitled to receive the money entrusted to himin any capacity” [emphasis added] (at 419). This means that the accused was not entitled, on the facts, to receive the money as the president of the Union, the president of the Committee or the vice-president of the Central Bank. The Privy Council also held that the manager of the depot did not have the authority to make the accused an agent to hand the money over to the bank (at 420). In coming to this holding, the Privy Council expressly cautioned that it wasnot“deciding what activity is required to establish that an individual is carrying on the business of an agent” (at 419). 451 It is therefore clear, when the full facts ofCoorayare considered, that the issue before the Privy Council was whether the accused could be sentenced under s 392 of the Ceylon Penal Code when the charge against him was for misappropriating monies entrusted to himby the manager of the depotin circumstances where, according to the prescribed procedure, the manager should not have done so. In other words, the charge against him alleged that he acted asthe manager’sagent. It was in this context that the Privy Council considered that the accused did not fall within s 392 of the Ceylon Penal Code. Not only was the accused not permitted to receive any monies from the manager of the depot, and to the extent that he did so, he received the monies casually and in no sense “in the way of his business as … an agent”vis-à-visthe manager. The Privy Council inCooraywas therefore not considering the separate question which now confronts this court, that is, whether a director, properly entrusted with dominion over the monies of the company or organisationby virtue of his position as director, can be liable for the aggravated offence of CBT as an agent if he misappropriated such monies. 452 I should state that I am not alone in my understanding of the decision inCooray. I refer, in this connection, to the decision of the Indian Supreme Court inDalmia. The facts of this case have been summarised in the majority Judgment and I do not intend to repeat them here. In that case, the Indian Supreme Court also consideredCoorayand made two important observations on the scope of that decision. First, the Indian Supreme Court noted that the Law Lords inCoorayleft open the question as to what kind of activity on the part of the person alleged to be an agent would satisfy the requirement that he be carrying on the business of an agent. The court noted that this “[made] it clear that the emphasis is not on the person’s carrying on theprofessionof an agent, but on his carrying on thebusinessof an agent” [emphasis added] (at [90]). Second, the Indian Supreme Court also noted the Privy Council’s holding that the accused inCooraywas not entitled to receive the money entrusted to him inany capacity. The court then continued (at [94]): It follows from [the Privy Council’s abovementioned holding] that [the accused inCooray] could not have received the money in the course of his duties as any of these office-bearers [ie, as an office-bearer of the Union, the Committee, or the Central Bank]. Further, the Manager of the depot had no authority to make the accused an agent for the purposes of transmitting the money to the [Central Bank]. The reason why the accused was not held to be an agent was not that he was not a professional agent.The reason mainly was that the amount was not entrusted to him in the course of the duties he had to discharge as the office-bearer of the various institutions.[emphasis added] 453Cooray, therefore, does not squarely address the present issue in contention. Nonetheless, it is still a relevant authority to have regard to as it sets out the principle that an accused would not satisfy the requirement of being entrusted with property “in the way of his business as … an agent” and be liable for the aggravated offence of CBT by an agent if he is acting as an agent only in a casual sense (ie, one who happens to be entrusted with property on an informal orad hocbasis). 454 BesidesCooray, it is also useful to refer to two other cases upon which the Privy Council relied in decidingCooray. These areR v Portugal(1885) 16 QBD 487 (“R v Portugal”) andR v Kane[1901] 1 QB 472 (“R v Kane”). These two decisions concerned prosecutions under s 75 of the Larceny Act 1861 (c 96) (UK) (“the 1861 Act”). Though not identical to s 392 of the Ceylon Penal Code (or s 409 of the Penal Code), s 75 of the 1861 Act consisted of similar terms, and the Privy Council inCoorayaccepted the submission made by counsel for the accused that the court could take guidance from the English cases on how the section had been interpreted. Section 75 of the 1861 Act read as follows: As to frauds by agents, bankers, or factors: 75. Whosoever, having been intrusted, either solely, or jointly with any other person, as a banker, merchant, broker, attorney, orother agent, with any other chattel or valuable security … for safe custody or for any special purpose, without any authority to sell, negotiate, transfer, or pledge, shall, in violation of good faith and contrary to the object and purpose for which such chattel … was intrusted to him sell, negotiate, pledge etc, or in any manner convert to his own use or benefit or the use or benefit of any person other than the person by whom he shall have been so intrusted … shall be guilty of a misdemeanour. [emphasis added] 455 InR v Portugal, the accused approached a firm of railway contractors offering to use his influence to obtain for the firm a contract for the construction of a railway and docks in France in return for commission. The firm agreed to the accused’s offer, and for this purpose, entrusted him with a cheque to allow him to open an account in the firm’s name in Paris. He was charged, amongst other things, for misappropriating the cheque for his own use. The main question before the court was whether the accused was an “agent” within the meaning of s 75 of the 1861 Act. The court held that the accused was not such an agent, stating (at 491): … In our judgment, s. 75 islimited to a class, anddoes not applyto everyonewho may happen to be intrustedas prescribed by the section, but only to the class of persons therein pointed out. Moreover, the words of the section are not “banker, merchant, broker, attorney, or agent” but “orotheragent,” pointing, in our opinion, to some agent of the kind with the class before enumerated. In our judgment, the “other agent” mentioned in this section means onewhose business or professionit is to receive money, securities, or chattels for safe custody or other special purpose; and that the term does not include a person who carries on no such business or profession, or the like. The section is aimed at those classes who carry on the occupations or similar occupations to those mentioned in the section, and not at those who carry on no such occupation,but who may happen from time to timeto undertake some fiduciary position, whether for money or otherwise. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics] 456 Thus, on the facts, the accused, who had only on one solitary occasion been entrusted with a cheque to open an account for the firm, and therebyhappenedto become an agent for the firm as a result, did not fall within the class of persons mentioned in s 75 of the 1861 Act and was not caught by that section. In this regard, I also agree withDalmia’s analysis ofR v Portugal, where the Indian Supreme Court stated (at [88]): [R v Portugal] therefore is authority to this effect only that the term ‘agent’ in [s 75 of the 1861 Act] does not include a person who just acts as an agent for another for a particular purpose with respect to some property that is entrusted to him, i.e., [the section] does not include a person who becomes an agent as a consequence of what he has been charged to do, and who has been asked to do a certain thing with respect to the property entrusted to him, but includes such person who,beforesuch entrustment [and]beforebeing asked to do something,already carried on such business or profession or the likeas necessitates, in the course of such business etc, his receiving money, securities or chattels for safe custody or other special purpose. That is to say, he isalready an agentfor the purpose of doing such acts and is subsequently entrusted with property with direction to deal with it in a certain manner.It is not held that a person to be an agent within that section must carry on the profession of an agent or must have an agency. The accused, in that case, was therefore not held to be an agent. [emphasis added] 457R v Portugalwas followed inR v Kane. In that case, the accused who was stated to be a “conjuror and thought-reader” had advised an acquaintance to make an investment. The acquaintance then entrusted the accused with some money for the purposes of the investment. Instead of investing the money, the accused used the proceeds for his own purposes. In finding that the accused was not caught by s 75 of the 1861 Act, the court held (at 475) that “[t]he section does not apply to any person whohappensto act on behalf of another; it applies only to agents of the class indicated in the preceding words of the section” [emphasis added]. It is clear fromR v PortugalandR v Kanethat s 75 of the 1861 Act did not apply toanyonewho, by happenstance or as a result of a particular transaction, finds himself an agent of another. Rather, it had to be demonstrated that the accused wasalreadyan agent, and was, by virtue of that agency, entrusted with property which he subsequently misappropriated. 458 I am in agreement with the general principles set out inCooray,R v PortugalandR v Kaneas they apply to s 409 of the Penal Code. Section 409 of the Penal Code is not intended to increase the punishment substantially for the offence of CBT by persons who find themselves agents as a result of fortuitous reasons or as a result of a particular transaction, but only agents who are entrusted with property or with dominion over property “in the way of [their] business as … agent[s]”. 459  The question of when an agent is entrusted with property or dominion over property “in the way of his business as … agent” was considered thoroughly by the Indian Supreme Court inDalmia. The court’s analysis is instructive and it is fruitful to quote it in full (at [96]): What S. 409 [of the Indian Penal Code] requires is that the person alleged to have committed criminal breach of trust with respect to any property be entrusted with that property or with dominion over that property in the way of his business as an agent.The expression ‘in the way of his business’ means that the property is entrusted to him ‘in the ordinary course of his duty or habitual occupation or profession or trade’.He should get the entrustment or dominion in his capacity as agent. In other words, the requirements of this section would be satisfied if the person be an agent of another and that person entrusts him with property or with any dominion over that property in the course of his duties as an agent. A person may be an agent of another for some purpose and if he is entrusted with property not in connection with that purpose but for another purpose, that entrustment will not be entrustment for the purposes of S. 409 [of the Indian Penal Code] if any breach of trust is committed by that person. This interpretation in no way goes against what has been held in [R v Portugal] or in [Cooray], and finds support from the fact that the section also deals with entrustment of property or with any dominion over property to a person in his capacity of a public servant. A different expression ‘in the way of his business’ is used in place of the expression ‘in his capacity’ to make clear that entrustment of property in the capacity of agent will not, by itself, be sufficient to make the criminal breach of trust by the agent a graver offence than any of the offences mentioned in Ss. 406 to 408 [of the Indian Penal Code].The criminal breach of trust by an agent would be a graver offence only when he is entrusted with property not only in his capacity as agent but also in connection with his duties as an agent. We need not speculate about the reasons which induced the Legislature to make the breach of trust by an agent more severely punishable than the breach of trust committed by any servant. The agent acts mostly as a representative of the principal and has more powers in dealing with the property of the principal and, consequently, there are greater chances of his misappropriating the property if he be so minded and less chances of his detection. However,the interpretation we have put on the expression ‘in the way of his business’ is also borne out from the Dictionary meanings of that expression and the meanings of the words ‘business’ and ‘way’, and we give this below for convenience. ‘In the way of’—of the nature of, belonging to the class of, in the course of or routine of (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary) —in the matter of, as regards, by way of (Webster’s New International Dictionary, II Edition, Unabridged) ‘Business’—occupation, word (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary) —mercantile transactions, buying and selling, duty, special imposed or undertaken service, regular occupation (Webster’s New International Dictionary, II Edition Unabridged) —duty, province, habitual occupation, profession, trade (Oxford Concise Dictionary) ‘Way’—scope, sphere, range, line of occupation (Oxford Concise Dictionary) [emphasis added] 460 I agree entirely with the above passage. In particular, I – like the court inDalmia– consider that the expression “in the way of his business” under s 409 of the Penal Code connotes the entrustment of property to an accused in “the ordinary course of his duty or habitual occupation or profession or trade”. I also consider that the fact that the specific phrase “in the way of his business as … an agent” is used, in contradistinction to the expression “in his capacity” (which is used in s 409 in the context of public servants), means that somethingmorethan being entrusted in the capacity as an agent must be shown in order for s 409 of the Penal Code to be engaged. In my judgment, the former (ie, “in the way of his business …”) is a subset of the latter (ie, “in his capacity ...”), which is a broader category. In other words, one who is entrusted with property in the way of his business as an agent mustnecessarilybe entrusted with property in his capacity as an agent. However, someone entrusted with property in hiscapacityas an agent may not necessarily be entrusted with property in the way of hisbusinessas an agent. A diagrammatic representation of this is as follows:  461 What, then, is the distinguishing factor between an agent who acts merely in his capacity as an agent and one whoalsoacts in the way of his business as an agent? In my judgment, the phrase “in the way of his business” connotes a sense of regular activity,orthe inhabitation of a particular trade, profession, office or occupation. Thus, in order for one to be entrusted in the way of hisbusinessas an agent, the Prosecution must demonstrate that the entrustment of property as an agent came about as a result of a certain trade, profession, office or occupation held by the accused. It would not suffice for the accused to be entrusted with property or dominion over property “in his capacity” as an agent if he did not also, in his regular dealings, act as an agent in such a trade, profession, office or occupation. To take a concrete example, the accused persons inR v PortugalandR v Kanecould be described as having been entrusted with property in their “capacity” as agents for their respective principals where the transactions in question were concerned, but as this entrustment did not come about as a result of a particular trade, profession, office or occupation held by the accused persons, they would not, if the charge was brought under the Penal Code, have fallen within the scope of s 409. Hence, if the accused acted in his capacity as an agent of the property owner on only one particular occasion without also holding a trade, profession, office or occupation of agency by virtue of which property was entrusted, this would not, in my view, satisfy this particular element of s 409 of the Penal Code as, in such a case, the entrustment would not have occurred in the way of the accused’s business as an agent. 462 The same analysis would, in my view, apply to bankers, merchants, factors, brokers and attorneys. Such persons can only be liable under s 409 of the Penal Code if they are entrusted with property whilst in their trade, profession, office or occupation as a banker, merchant, factor, broker or attorney. One, who by the circumstance of aparticulartransaction,happensto become – for the purpose of that transaction – a banker, merchant, factor, broker or attorney and is entrusted with property or dominion over property in that capacity, would not, in my view, be said to have been acting “in the way of his business” so as to fall within the scope of s 409 of the Penal Code. 463 While the above analysis explains the use of the phrase “in the way of his business” in s 409 of the Penal Code, a further question that remains is the scope of the term “agent” under that section. In my view, useful guidance may be derived from the decision of Lee Seiu Kin J inTan Cheng Yew, where Lee J held that the term “attorney” in s 409 of the Penal Code included an advocate and solicitor. In arriving at his finding, Lee J considered the legislative history and context of s 409, and stated (at [103]): In my view, the mischief that s 409 targets is the commission of CBT by persons who performcertain trusted trades, when they act in the way of their business. As stated in [Dr Hari Singh Gour’s Penal Law of Indiavol 4 (Law Publishers (India) Pvt Ltd, 11th Ed, 2011)] at p 4037: ‘Banker, merchant, factor, broker, attorney or agent’: All these persons aretrusted agents employed by the public in their various businesses. … Where it is normal for the public to rely on a person’s trade as a mark of his trustworthiness and integrity, and where such trust facilitates commercial transactions, it is important that such transactions are above board. A commission of CBT by a person in the performance of his trade would shake the confidence of the public in those trades and impede the ability of persons in such trades to serve the public. A breach of trust in such circumstances “may have severe … public repercussions” (see Butterworth’s commentary at p 621). Therefore, s 409 provides that CBT committed in the capacity of a public servant or in the way of business of a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent, would be punished more severely than CBT committed by persons who are trusted on anad hocbasisunder s 406. [emphasis added in bold italics] 464 It is clear from the above passage that Lee J distinguished between persons who performed certain trusted trades and persons who were trusted on anad hocbasis. I agree with this analysis. The common thread that unites persons such as bankers, merchants, factors, brokers and attorneys is that they act in a certain trusted trade, profession, office or occupation which the public relies on or utilises to facilitate the course of commercial dealings when they act in the way of their business, carrying out or performing those trusted trades, professions, offices or occupations. The term “agent” must therefore be interpreted in that light. 465 I turn now to the appellants’ principal submission on this issue. It is clear that the underlying basis of the appellants’ submission that the members of the CHC Management Board were not entrusted with CHC’s funds in the way of their business as agents under s 409 of the Penal Code is that directors of companies and organisations areonly casuallyentrusted with the company’s or organisation’s money or property and are hence only casual agents who do not come within the ambit of s 409 of the Penal Code. I find this basic premise on which the appellants’ submission is based untenable. It is trite that whilst a company is a separate legal person, it can only act through the medium of human beings. When directors act for and on behalf of the company, they act as agents of the company (seeLow Hua Kin v Kumagai-Zenecon Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation) and another[2000] 2 SLR(R) 689 at [29]). As Cairns LJ stated inFerguson v Wilson(1866) 2 Ch App 77 (at 89): What is the position of directors of a public company? They are merely agents of a company. The company itself cannot act in its own person, for it has no person; it can only act through directors, and the case is, as regards those directors, merely the ordinary case of principal and agent. 466 It is, to my mind, unarguable that when directors are entrusted with the property of their company or organisationin their role as directors, they are entrusted with the property in accordance with that role and office. I do not see how it can be said that a director’s dealings with the property of his company or organisation in his role as an office-holder may be said to be casual in the same way the accused persons inR v KaneandR v Portugalwere said to be casual agentsvis-à-visthe accused’s acquaintance and the firm of railway contractors respectively. Rather, I find that directors, like bankers, merchants, factors, brokers and attorneys, hold a formal position in which they, in the usual course of that position, undertake to act on someone else’s behalf, and in the course of doing so, receive or hold property on that person’s behalf. The directorship of a company or organisation facilitates the course of commercial dealings,inter alia, between the public and the company or organisation, making the fictional legal entity of a company possible as a practical reality. Directors are subject to onerous fiduciary and directors’ duties, and are in a position of trust as much as (or even more so than) bankers, merchants, factors, brokers and attorneys arevis-à-vistheir principals or clients. Additionally, directors are usually remunerated for their services through fees in a manner similar to the remuneration typically received by bankers, merchants, factors, brokers and attorneys (though it is not invariably the case that all such persons would receive financial remuneration). 467 I would therefore hold that directors of a company or an organisation fall within the class of persons contemplated under s 409 of the Penal Code, and in so doing, I agree with the position laid down inTay Choo Wah. A director may therefore be liable for the aggravated offence of CBT by an agent if he misappropriates funds entrusted to him in the course of his directorship. This appliesmutatis mutandisto directors who sit on the board of registered societies, which, like companies, are recognised as possessing separate legal personality (see, generally, s 35 of the Societies Act (Cap 311, 2014 Rev Ed),Chee Hock Keng v Chu Sheng Temple[2016] 3 SLR 1396 at [28] andChen Cheng and another v Central Christian Church and another appeal[1996] 1 SLR 313 at [38]). 468 To the extent that the appellants’ submission is based on case authorities, I would note that save for the decision of the Malaysian Court of Appeal inPeriasamyand the cases following it, no reference has been made to any other case that has held that a director of a company who is entrusted with the company’s property in that capacity is only entrusted with the propertycasually. It is therefore apt to delve deeper into the decision ofPeriasamy. InPeriasamy, the Malaysian Court of Appeal stated as follows (at 575): While accepting that under [s 409 of the Malaysian Penal Code (Cap 45), which isin pari materiawith s 409 of the Penal Code] a single act of entrustment may constitute a man an agent within the section, we would emphasize that for the section to bite, theremustbe evidence that the entrustment was made to the particular accused by way of his business as an agent. By way of illustration, the managing director of a company who, either by his contract with his company or by general law, is entrusted with dominion over his company’s property is not to be presumed to be falling within the terms of s 409 by reason of that fact alone. A managing director of a company has, no doubt, been held by the general law to be an agent of the company; but he cannot, upon that sole consideration, be held to have been entrusted in the way of his business as an agent. In other words, the section refers – as was contended at the bar of the Privy Council inCooray– to persons who are professional agents and not to casual agents, such as a company director. [emphasis in original] 469 It may be observed from the passage cited above that the proposition that directors of companies are merely casual agents was an assertion by the court made without much legal analysis. With respect, I find it somewhat contradictory for the court to have noted that directors are, by general law, agents of a company, whilst at the same time stating that such agency is merely casual in nature. Furthermore, to the extent thatPeriasamymay be said to have followedCooray, it is pertinent to note thatCooraydidnotset out the position that directors of companies were to be considered only as casual agents. Indeed, it may be recalled that the Privy Council inCoorayexpressly stated that it was not “deciding what activity is required to establish that an individual is carrying on the business of an agent” (at 419). Additionally, as I have analysed above (at [451]), although the accused inCoorayheld the positions of president of the Union, vice-president of the Central Bank and president of the Committee, the entrustment which the accused was charged to have breached wasnota result of thesepositionsof his but because the manager of the depot had improperly handed over the monies to the accused. Indeed, if the prescribed procedures had been strictly followed, the accused wouldnothave been entitled to obtain the monies in question. In the circumstances, I decline to followPeriasamy. 470 Importantly, the interpretation which I have adopted is also in line with the framework of the Penal Code, which provides for an increase in the scale of punishment according to the degree of trust reposed. If I had adopted the appellants’ interpretation, an anomalous situation would result wherein a director who committed the offence of CBT of the property of his company or organisation would only be caught by s 406 of the Penal Code which would attract a maximum punishment of seven years’ imprisonment in the 2008 revised edition, whereas a clerk or servant who misappropriates the property of the company could be liable to a much heavier sentence of up to 15 years’ imprisonment under s 408 of the same edition of the Penal Code. This would result in a highly unsatisfactory state of affairs, as directors in their positions of leadership are regarded as being reposed with greater power, trust and responsibility than clerks or servants. The interpretation which I have adopted avoids this incongruity, and, in my judgment, is to be preferred as it is well-established that the court generally avoids interpreting statutes in a manner that produces absurd results (seePublic Prosecutor v Heah Lian Khin[2000] 2 SLR(R) 745 at [53]–[54];Comfort Management Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor[2003] 2 SLR(R) 67 at [17]). In holding that directors fall within the class of persons referred to in s 409 (ie, bankers, merchants, factors, brokers, attorneys and agents), my decision is in line with the principles set out in the authorities such asCoorayandDalmiaas well as the language, framework and legislative purpose of s 409 of the Penal Code. 471 Finally, insofar as the argument is made that “agent” for the purpose of s 409 of the Penal Code covers only those who are professional agents, in the sense that they carry on a livelihood of being an agent, it follows from the analysis above that I do not accept this argument. The words “in way of his business as … an agent” should not be interpreted so narrowly, in my view, to limit the possible application of s 409 of the Penal Code only to persons who own (as a major or majority shareholder) or carry on an “agency business”, or for that matter to persons who are employed in an “agency business”, an “agency profession” or an agency-type of business or profession. In other words, there is no additional essential or mandatory element that the person must first be carrying on an “agency business” or be an owner of an “agency business” before he can even be considered to be liable for an offence under s 409. Similarly, s 409 should also not be restricted only to those persons whose occupation or profession bears the label “agent”, such as real estate agents or insurance agents because of the words “as … an agent” in the section. As is clear from the analysis above, neither the case authorities nor the principles of statutory interpretation require that the section be interpreted in such a manner. Instead, as I have stated above, what is crucial is that the accused in question is entrusted with property or dominion over property when acting in the course of a certain trusted trade, profession, office or occupation held by the accused wherein he in the ordinary course acts as an agent. 472 In the final analysis, whether a person has been entrusted with property “in the way of his business” whether as “a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent” is very much a question of fact depending on all the facts and circumstances, including the nature and scope of his duties arising from his trade, profession, office or occupation, the circumstances under which the property was entrusted to him, and the degree and nature of the connection that the entrustment has with the nature and scope of those duties, having regard to the type of trusted trade, profession, office or occupation that the person is in. 473 Turning to the facts of this case, the appellants do not dispute that when John Lam, Kong Hee and Ye Peng, as members of the CHC Management Board, acted in that capacity on behalf of CHC, they acted as agentsvis-à-visCHC. In my judgment, this characterisation is accurate both as a matter of law and on the facts of this case. Whenever the CHC Management Board deals with CHC’s property (including monies donated by the public to CHC) in accordance with CHC’s constitution, the members of the CHC Management Board would always and necessarily be entrusted by CHC to act as agents to deal with such property. Having found that these appellants were entrusted with dominion over CHC’s property by virtue of their position as members of the CHC Management Board, I hold – based on the principles set out above – that this entrustment of dominion over CHC’s property to the relevant appellants was in the way of their business as agents (of CHC) under s 409 of the Penal Code. 474 Accordingly, I am of the view that all the appellants are properly found guilty of, and convicted for, offences punishable under s 409 read with s 109 of the Penal Code for the offence of abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with certain other appellants to commit CBT by an agent in respect of CHC’s monies.",
        "The appellants’ evolving mind-sets across the various timeframes": "475 I turn now to analyse the mind-sets of the relevant appellants at the time the 1st Xtron BSA was executed on 17 August 2007. In particular, I refer to E-1, which is an email conversation between Serina, Eng Han and Ye Peng in early July 2007 concerning the appropriate term of borrowing and the amount required for the bonds under the 1st Xtron BSA. Serina clarified that in order to pay back the 1st Xtron BSA, Xtron would first obtain funds from another company known as “UEPL” and Xtron would then take ten years to repay the loan from UEPL. To this, Eng Han queried whether it was necessary for Xtron to take ten years to repay the loan and intimated that his impression was that “the sales of [the] album[s] [could] cover back the majority of the loan”. Serina then responded: We based our projection on 200,000 copies of English Album sold which will only yield us $2.17M, hardly enough to pay off the $13M. So we will need 10 years as previously discussed assuming no other new unbudgeted expenditure. 476 Taking reference from E-1 as well as other correspondence between the appellants around that period, the Judge held that Kong Hee, Ye Peng, Eng Han and Serina were aware at the time the 1st Xtron BSA was executed that Xtron would not, realistically speaking, be able to redeem the bonds when they matured in two years (see [293]–[298], [322], [356]–[357] and [393] of the Conviction GD). The Judge rejected the submission of the appellants that the projection of a sale of 200,000 albums was a “worst case scenario”, especially since the projection of a sale of 200,000 albums was the only Xtron cashflow in existence around the material time. He was also unconvinced that the appellants could have had a genuine belief in Sun Ho’s prospects of success in the US since the appellants were aware of Sun Ho’sdubiouscommercial track record (see [466] of the Conviction GD). 477 Unlike the majority, I do not entirely agree with this aspect of the Judge’s holding. In my view, it does not accord with the mentality of rational persons – such as Kong Hee, Ye Peng, Eng Han and Serina – to enter into a venture which would inevitably end up in utter commercial failure. In my assessment of the evidence, I accept the appellants’ submission that they not only believed that Sun Ho would be a successful artiste in the US in the light of the representations by Justin and Wyclef but theyalsobelieved, in the several months leading up to the signing of the 1st Xtron BSA, that it was more likely than not that they would have been able to ensure that Xtron would eventually have sufficient funds to redeem the bonds within a few years and make substantial profits thereafter. For clarity of analysis, I will, in the discussion that follows, refer to the appellants’ use of CHC’s funds “for the purpose of funding [Sun Ho’s] music career” (as was stated in the sham investment charges) through the corporate vehicle of Xtron (and later, UA) as the “Investment”. This is distinguished from “the Crossover”, which I will use to refer specifically to CHC’s mission of using secular music to evangelise. 478 In arriving at the finding stated above, I find that the projection of a sale of 200,000 albums was a case of “scenario planning” and did not in fact reflect the appellants’ honest belief in Sun Ho’s potential and ability to win over consumers in the US. It appears to me that Justin for his own reasons was fanning the appellants’ ambition to make Sun Ho an internationally renowned singer, calling this “an opportunity to go huge, world wide [sic]” and “to break a new international super star”204Foot Note 204×E-361, p 1.and providing the appellants with very optimistic figures and projections. For instance, in an email dated 23 November 2006 to Kong Hee and Ye Peng, Justin commented that Wyclef was projecting sales of “multi-million units”.205Foot Note 205×E-361, p 2.Justin also expressed great enthusiasm for Sun Ho’s music videos, “China Wine” and “Mr Bill”, in April 2007.206Foot Note 206×E-232.Subsequently, after the 1st Xtron BSA was executed, Justin informed Kong Hee and Ye Peng on 18 November 2007 that the plan was to launch Sun Ho’s English album in the third or fourth quarter of 2008.207Foot Note 207×E-398.Not being experts in the US music industry, it was reasonable for the appellants to rely on Justin’s expertise. At the time that the 1st Xtron BSA was executed, there appeared to be little to detract from the optimistic and bullish picture that Justin was portraying in respect of Sun Ho’s foray into the US music market. 479 Moreover, in terms of concrete projections, a consistent theme within the appellants’ various correspondence was a projected sale of 1.5 million albums at US$7 apiece. This formula was applied in the projected Xtron cashflow as at 18 January 2007,208Foot Note 208×E-191.in the Xtron budget as at 9 May 2007,209Foot Note 209×E-537.and again in the projected Xtron cashflow as at 28 September 2007.210Foot Note 210×E-146.It is also telling that in an email dated 28 September 2007, Serina informed Ye Peng that the cashflow “based on theconservative estimate of 200K albums sold”211Foot Note 211×E-146.[emphasis added] would be insufficient to repay the Xtron bonds or to finance a second album. I accept that Serina’s description of a sale of 200,000 albums as a “conservative estimate” reflected the truth of the appellants’ attitude towards the Investment in Sun Ho’s music career and Sun Ho’s potential in the US market at or around that particular period. In other words, I accept that while the appellants may have considered that there was a risk of failure, they did not genuinely believe this to be a significant risk which was likely to materialise when they first embarked on the project for Sun Ho to produce an English album and when they devised the plan to obtain funds by way of the Xtron bonds under the 1st Xtron BSA. 480 As late as 29 March 2008, Justin was still providing fairly detailed five years’ estimates of profit and loss to Kong Hee. At this stage, the projected release date for Sun Ho’s English album was in the second quarter of 2009, which was prior to the date on which the Xtron bonds would mature under the 1st Xtron BSA.212Foot Note 212×E-361, p 9.Sun Ho also appeared to be slated to perform on a tour with other artistes. These estimates of profit and loss showed that although the Investment was likely to suffer losses of less than US$1m in that year (ie, 2008), a profit in excess of US$4m yearly would be made from 2009 onwards with the revenue from recorded music, traditional media, touring, licensing, merchandising and digital media projected to be streaming in continuously. Justin projected for Kong Hee a very rosy picture of securing a total accumulated net profit in excess of US$32m by 2012.213Foot Note 213×E-361, p 13.This would have been more than enough to repay the Xtron bonds, perhaps not at maturity, but soon thereafter with the huge profits that could be generated progressively. 481 However, as more projections were subsequently done, the picture appeared less and less rosy. The appellants’ mind-sets must have correspondingly changed. As at 4 July 2008, it was projected that the Investment would suffer a loss of approximately US$6m and US$1m in 2008 and 2009 respectively, with a net profit well under US$1m in 2010.214Foot Note 214×E-361, pp 42–44.Around this time (ie, in the middle of 2008), it became apparent to the appellants that the revenue from the Investment would be insufficient to repay the Xtron bonds.215Foot Note 215×E-266.In fact, the Investment required even more funds than the $13m that had already been disbursed under the 1st Xtron BSA.216Foot Note 216×SeeegE-103 and E-152.At the same time, the appellants were facing auditing issues as regards the Xtron bonds, such as the need to write down the value of the bonds given Xtron’s weak financial position and the likelihood that Xtron would be unable to redeem the bonds on maturity.217Foot Note 217×SeeegE-346.Further, concerns also arose that Xtron’s and CHC’s accounts might have to be consolidated if Xtron was viewed as being related to CHC. In order to address these issues, the appellants came up with various solutions which involved (a) moving Sun Ho out of Xtron; (b) extending the maturity period of the Xtron bonds; and (c) obtaining fresh funds from other sources (ie, Firna). 482 I find the appellants’ conduct in the period leading up to and after the execution of the Firna BSA highly objectionable. Upon discovering, and despite knowing, that Xtron would be unable to repay 1st Xtron BSA within the timeframe they had originally planned for, the appellants caused CHC and Xtron to enter into the ABSA which varied the below market interest rate of a very low 7% per annum to aneven lowerinterest rate of 5% per annum, extended the deadline for repayment from two years toten yearsand even increased the maximum amount of funding under the bonds from $13m to $25m, all of which were changes very detrimental to CHC and made without the provision of any valuable consideration to CHC by Xtron in exchange for CHC’s agreement to those variations. The appellants were not even at all concerned that with the ABSA, they were almost doubling CHC’s financial exposure to a financially strapped company that was already experiencing severe financial difficulties. Additionally, the appellants caused CHC to enter into the Firna BSA, diverting evenmorefunds from CHC to fund the Investment at a stage when the production of the album had been beset by various delays, serious budget overruns and other issues. The appellants also used the funds that CHC ostensibly lent to Firna under the Firna BSA to provide a large sum of $2.5m to a third party, Wahju, for his personal expenses.218Foot Note 218×See ASOF para 9.5 and A-132.I infer that the $2.5m lent to Wahju was to seek his cooperation to allow the appellants to use Firna as the corporate vehicle to conceal their siphoning of funds out of CHC for the appellants’ own purposes. It is clear to me from the chain of events that the appellants treated CHC’s funds as their private piggybank which they could draw on as and when they deemed fit. Indeed, when it became apparent that they might not be able to return the funds initially misappropriated under the Xtron bonds due to budget overruns and delays, the appellants had no qualms about amending the repayment terms or misappropriating even more funds from CHC to fund their Investment under the guise of the Firna BSA. 483 In a similar vein, I find the appellants’ conduct in relation to the round-tripping transactions completely unacceptable and criminal in nature. When faced with auditing queries surrounding the Xtron and Firna bonds, Eng Han, Ye Peng, Serina and Sharon had no hesitation in manipulating various entities and transactions to make it appear as though both Xtron and Firna had redeemed the bonds. The use of the ARLA was critical in this regard. The ARLA was a mechanism which the appellants employed to extract funds from CHC in order to effect repayment of the Xtron and Firna bonds. This is apparent when one considers, amongst other things, how the appellants derived the sums CHC was to pay Xtron under the ARLA. The lack of any contemporaneous evidence as to whether the annual rental amount was fair value is telling; it demonstrates that the appellants did not consider whether it was in CHC’s interest to enter into the ARLA at all. Instead, the appellants reverse-engineered the sums payable under the ARLA in order to ensure that the Xtron and Firna bonds could be repaid with the stipulated interest so as to not alert the auditors who were growing suspicious. 484 As the appellants’ motives and mind-sets evolved over the period during which the various offences were committed, it would not, in my judgment, be appropriate to paint the appellants’ motives for the various sets of offences with the same brush. Although I accept that at the very beginning when sourcing for external funds for their Investment, the appellants might have believed in the commercial viability of their Investment and in their ability to use the profits from their Investment to repay the Xtron bonds eventually (even if not by the initial maturity date, then perhaps just a few years after receiving the large revenue streams and making the huge net profits as projected by Justin), I find that this belief was gradually lost as time wore on. In 2008 when the appellants discovered that the repayment of the Xtron bonds was at risk, they had no reservations about extending the repayment period and in having Xtron, and later Firna, issue riskier bonds for CHC to take up. Things came to a head in 2009 when, instead of repaying the bonds, the appellants orchestrated the round-tripping transactions to replace the debts owed by Xtron and Firna to CHC with Xtron’s obligations under the ARLA. In my view, the evolving nature of the appellants’ motivation and considerations is a factor that cannot be ignored in the sentencing process. On the one hand, I consider that my finding that the appellants’ genuine belief at the time the 1st Xtron BSA was entered into that they would have been able to make sufficient profits from their Investment to repay the bonds, if not at maturity then shortly thereafter, ought to be taken into account in sentencing on the basis that the monies criminally misappropriatedvidethe Xtron bonds, in particular those under the 1st Xtron BSA, wereoriginally intendedto be for a limited period only. However, their subsequent actions in allowing CHC to enter into the Firna bonds despite the relatively negative prospects of their Investment at that stage is, in my view, far more aggravating in nature. Additionally, where the round-tripping charges are concerned, I find the appellants’ use of one colourable device (ie, the round-tripping transactions) to cover other colourable devices (ie, the Xtron and Firna bonds) to be an aggravating factor that ought to be taken into account in sentencing Eng Han, Ye Peng, Serina and Sharon on these charges. 485 Before moving to my decision in respect of the appeals against sentence, I should explain that my finding that the appellants had genuinely believed, especially at the time the 1st Xtron BSA was executed, that the Investment would be commercially successful such that the Xtron bonds under the 1st Xtron BSA could be repaid if not on maturity, then soon thereafter, in no way impinges on the findings made in the majority Judgment in respect of the sham investment charges – which I agree with – that (a) the Xtron and Firna bonds were not investments when viewed though the lenses of CHC and thus amounted to a “wrong use” of the BF and (b) each of the appellants as members of the CHC Management Board or holders of important official positions of responsibility within CHC as the case may be possessed a dishonest intention as they knew that they were not entitled to put the BF to such a use. In my view, the Xtron bonds and the Firna bonds amounted to a “wrong use” of the BF irrespective of the appellants’ initial belief in the commercial viability of their Investment. I agree entirely with the finding that the Xtron and Firna bonds were not investments when assessed objectively from the perspective of CHC but were effectively a means through which the appellants could utilise the funds in the BF for their Investment and their other purposes (eg, conferring an interest-free loan of $2.5m on Wahju for his personal use219Foot Note 219×E-175.). In line with this, there was therefore a clear lack of any consideration on CHC’s behalf from the very beginning as to whether the 1st Xtron BSA issued by an insolvent company with the bond proceeds to be used for a rather high-risk project should be purchased at all by CHC, and yet for all the risks to be taken by the bond holder, the coupon rate offered was only 7% per annum. Their total disregard of CHC’s financial interest resulting in serious breaches of their obligation to protect and safeguard CHC’s financial interest at all times permeated throughout the rest of the transactions they undertook on behalf of CHC. 486 More egregiously, the appellants were concealing the fact that Kong Hee, with the assistance of the other appellants, was in full control of Xtron, and were perpetuating the impression to the auditors and lawyers that Xtron and CHC were independent entities. The scope and potential for conflict of interest, especially where Kong Hee was concerned, were enormous. The Xtron bonds were not, as the appellants made it seem, a genuine arms-length commercial investment, but were part of a carefully orchestrated method to systematically extract funds from CHC to further their own purposes. An analogy may be drawn between the appellants’ use of CHC’s monies for their Investment and a rogue trader who misuses his client’s money for his own purposes to make very risky investments with very high potential returns. If the investments turn out to be profitable, the trader simply returns the client’s money and keeps the large profits to employ as he wishes. If the investments turn out badly, then the client may suffer all the loss as the rogue trader may not have the means to repay the client for the full sum of money originally taken out of the client’s account to enter into those risky trades. Basically, the rogue trader takes all the upside and the client takes all the downside. The rogue trader’s honest belief that he will be able to return the client the money that he had taken because he honestly believes that his trades would be profitable is irrelevant to the fact that he had, in fact, dishonestly misappropriated his client’s funds for an unauthorised purpose. 487 Likewise, the fact that the appellants might have genuinely believed at the time the 1st Xtron BSA was executed that the Investment, though likely to involve substantial financial risk, would, if successful, eventually garner more than sufficient revenue and net profit for repayment of the bonds, is irrelevant to the finding that the appellants acted dishonestly in causing CHC to enter into the 1st Xtron BSA and thereby dishonestly misappropriated the funds of CHC. While I have drawn an analogy above between theactionsof a rogue trader and the appellants, I acknowledge that their underlyingmotivesmay not be entirely identical. While the rogue trader’s motives may be wholly self-serving, the appellants’ motives may be mixed,ie, partially to benefit CHC by investing in what they believe to be a better and more effective means of evangelisation to non-believers worldwide, and partially to use criminally misappropriated CHC’s funds to invest in Sun Ho’s music career to make huge profits (as can be seen from the detailed financial projections made) both (a) to directly benefit Sun Ho by spending large sums of money to build up her secular music career, and transform her into an internationally renowned singing diva, and paying her very attractive financial benefits and commissions from sale revenues (in the course of which her husband, Kong Hee, would benefit indirectly (see [509] below)) and (b) to directly benefit the shareholders of the private company, Xtron (namely Choong Kar Weng (“Kar Weng”), Koh Siow Ngea and those others who are in effective control of it), and later UA (which is fully owned by Wahju), should the huge projected profits from their investment in Sun Ho as an artiste be realised. 488 On appeal, the appellants strenuously advance the argument that they had never intended to cause CHC to suffer any financial loss and thus they were never dishonest. Instead, they submit that they had at all times acted in CHC’s best interests. They contend that their states of mind then were analogous to the accused described in illus (d) to s 405 of the Penal Code and hence, they ought to be acquitted of the CBT Charges. 489 I reject the appellants’ argument on two levels. In the first place, I agree with the Judge and the majority that the appropriate question isnotwhether the appellants intended to cause CHCfinancialloss, but whether the appellants knew that they were not legally authorised to use CHC’s funds in the manner which they did, even when there was in fact no intention to cause CHCfinancialloss, which I do not accept on the evidence. My finding that the appellants, at the time of the 1st Xtron BSA, honestly believed that Sun Ho’s English album would be successful and that Xtron would have been able to effect repayment of the Xtron bonds if not at maturity, then soon thereafter does not, in my view, controvert the holding that they knew that, in any event, they werenotlegally entitled to cause CHC to enter into the 1st Xtron BSA, which in itself is sufficient to make out the element of dishonesty for the purpose of the offence of CBT under the Penal Code. Their dishonestmens reais apparent from their lack of full and frank disclosure of the true relationship between Xtron and CHC to the CHC Management Board, the EMs, the auditors and the lawyers in circumstances where Kong Hee’s interest was clearly potentially in conflict with the interests of CHC. Yet, despite circumstances which cried out for legal advice and disclosure, the appellants nevertheless conspired with Kong Hee to cover up the truth and to misappropriate monies from the BF for the purposes of their Investment. 490 On a more fundamental level,even ifI do accept the appellants’ legal argument that a finding that they had never intended to cause CHC financial loss would lead to their acquittal on the CBT Charges, I wholly reject the appellants’ characterisation of their intention on the facts. I will explain this in greater detail in my discussion below on the appeals against sentence, but it suffices to note for the present purpose that, in my view, it cannot be doubted that the appellants had intended to enter into transactions that were not to CHC’s financial advantage. In fact, those transactions were to CHC’s financial detriment and the appellants had intended to and did cause financial loss to CHC at the time the transactions were entered into by them on behalf of CHC. Where there existed such an intention to cause financial loss to CHC, the appellants must know that they were,a fortiori, not legally authorised to use CHC’s funds in such a manner, especially where the various transactions were purportedly meant to be investments on CHC’s part. Not only would this further make out the element of “dishonest misappropriation” of CHC’s property beyond a reasonable doubt to satisfy the elements of CBT under the Penal Code for the purpose of conviction, it in itself is relatively more aggravating than a case where no such loss was intended. Needless to say, this factor must also be taken into account at the sentencing stage along with an examination of the magnitude of that financial loss intended and caused to CHC.",
        "My decision in respect of the appeals against sentence": "491 With the above in mind, I now consider the appellants’ and Prosecution’s respective appeals against the sentences imposed by the Judge. In brief, the appellants seek a substantial reduction of their sentences while the Prosecution seeks an increase in the sentences imposed (save for the round-tripping charges relating to Tranches 10 and 11 of the SOF). 492 The Judge considered that the aggravating factors were that the offences involved the misuse of massive amounts of charity funds held by CHC; the betrayal of the high degree of trust reposed in the appellants as CHC’s leaders who were duty-bound to act with the utmost integrity and accountability; the manipulation and exploitation of CHC’s culture of absolute and unquestioning trust and deference to the wisdom of the CHC’s pastors; the unmistakably clear pattern of fraudulent and deceptive conduct, of flawed corporate governance and active concealment, and of planning and premeditation; and the fabrication of misleading cover stories to avoid detection. 493 On the other hand, the mitigating factors taken into account by the Judge were that the appellants were first offenders and were not motivated by “personal gain”; no “permanent loss” was intended nor caused to CHC; and all the monies misappropriated were subsequently returned to CHC with interest (the Sentencing GD at [33]). He noted however that the motivation for restitution was not entirelybona fidebut to cover up their earlier misdeeds and to avoid detection and allay suspicions, and did not come about solely due to the appellants’ personal sacrifice (the Sentencing GD at [27]). 494 I agree with the aggravating factors that the Judge identified. However, I express reservations on whether some of the mitigating factors were correctly taken into consideration given the evidence before the court. As I have alluded to above, I do not agree that (a) all the appellants’ motivations were purely or entirely altruistic with no elements whatsoever featured of any direct or indirect gain to Kong Hee and his wife arising from the use of the misappropriated funds; (b) the appellants had always acted in CHC’s best interests and did not intend to cause CHC any financial loss at the time when the appellants caused CHC to enter into the transactions in question; and (c) CHC ultimately did not suffer any permanent financial loss as the Judge assumed. The methods which the appellants employed to effect restitution of the monies when the ARLA was rescinded must also be examined more closely before giving due weight to the act of restitution. I will go on to consider each of these factors, beginning with the first point identified above.",
        "Whether the appellants were motivated by purely altruistic motives": "495 In convicting the appellants, the Judge stated at [187] of the Conviction GD that he believed that the appellants “loved CHC and had no wish to do any harm to it”, and that in using CHC’s funds for the Crossover, the appellants “believed that they were using church funds for an evangelistic purpose that was not just permitted but positively mandated by the vision and mission of CHC”. Consistent with this analysis, the Judge observed at the sentencing stage that the appellants were not motivated by any “personal gain”, and that in any case, there was no evidence of any “wrongful personal gain” on the part of all six appellants (the Sentencing GD at [20]–[21]). However, the Judge also added that as the funds misappropriated were ultimately intended to finance Sun Ho’s music career, there was, in a limited sense, an “indirect benefit for Kong Hee if efforts to advance his wife’s music career had benefitted from the availability of these funds”. The Judge then went on to note that perhaps only in this limited and indirect sense, Kong Hee (but not the others) could be said to have been motivated by greed and self-interest in obtaining a wrongful indirect gain for himself. However, the Judge highlighted that it was not the Prosecution’s case that even Kong Hee had enjoyed any “wrongful gain”. As none of the submissions before him alluded to it, he thus decided not to say any more about this aspect. 496 In my view, the use of the term “personal gain” has the potential to give rise to ambiguity and consequently disagreements. Indeed, it is not easy to decipher what the Judge meant when he stated on the one hand that there was no evidence of “wrongful personal gain” on the part ofanyappellant, but on the other hand that there was “undoubtedly also a form of indirect benefit for Kong Hee” ([21] of the Sentencing GD). I prefer instead to view the concept of gain or benefit that may have accrued to the individuals in question in four specific forms, and will refer to these forms in the analysis below. These are (a) direct financial benefit; (b) direct non-financial benefit; (c) indirect financial benefit; and (d) indirect non-financial benefit. I therefore interpret the Judge’s remarks at [20]–[22] of the Sentencing GD to mean that: (a) There was no evidence of anydirectbenefit (whether financial or non-financial) to any of the six appellants. (b) Sun Ho clearly derived adirectbenefit (both financial and non-financial) as CHC’s funds were channeled to Xtron and used to finance and advance her music career. (c) Kong Hee undoubtedly enjoyed a form ofindirectbenefit (both financial and non-financial) since his wife benefitted both financially and non-financially from the expenditure of the CHC funds to finance and advance her music career. However, as the Prosecution’s case was not that Kong Hee had enjoyed any gain whether direct or indirect, the Judge did not say any more about this aspect. 497 Having set out the above points at [20]–[22] of the Sentencing GD, the Judge also noted a few paragraphs down (the Sentencing GD at [26]) that he was “not quite able to see how there was a pure ‘altruistic’ purpose for the use of the Crossover funds, contrary to the submissions of the defence”. As he saw it, the “direct beneficiary [of the appellants’ actions] … was Sun Ho [who was not in any financial hardship], [and] whose music career in the US was being sponsored through these funds”. But the Judge did not go on to address the significance of this point (ie, that the appellants’ use of CHC’s funds cannot be said to be purely altruistic given that Sun Ho had obtained a benefit from it) in the latter part of that paragraph. Instead, he observed that no matter how pure the appellants’ motives were, the end did not justify their dishonest means, though these motives were not altogether irrelevant in sentencing and should feature towards mitigating the seriousness of the offences. When the Judge’s observations are read as a whole, it appears clear, at least from his remarks at [22] of the Sentencing GD, that the Judge did not take into account any indirect benefit that may have accrued to Kong Hee as a factor in his decision on sentence. At the same time, it is not entirely clear whether the Judge had placed any weight on the fact – which had not escaped his attention – that the appellants had intended to, by their actions, directly benefit a third party, Sun Ho, in terms of her music career beyond the aims of evangelism as envisaged by the Crossover. 498 The position taken by the Prosecution on the direct benefit that had accrued to Sun Ho, and the indirect benefit that might have accrued to Kong Hee, is even less clear or consistent. Neither of these points featured in its submissions before the Judge. In fact, neither of these points featured in its written submissions before us. Yet, in the hearing before us on 21 September 2016, the Prosecution attempted to bring in the point that Sun Ho had benefitted from the offences.220Foot Note 220×See,eg, Transcript, 21 September 2016, at p 23.The Prosecution’s purpose in raising this point appears to be that this should be a factor that the court ought to take into account for the purpose of sentencing when considering what the appellants were motivated by and therefore lead the court to find that the appellants were not drivenpurelyby altruistic motives. In essence, the Prosecution on appeal is in fact relying on the existence of a direct benefit being conferred on Sun Ho by the appellants as a factor in sentencing. However, the Prosecution did not go further and submit that Kong Hee had obtained a form of indirect benefit that ought to be counted against him as an aggravating factor or to show that his motives for the use of the criminally misappropriated monies were not entirely altruistic. Instead, the Prosecution appears to accept that all the appellants did not benefit “personally”, but submits that the Judge had placed too much weight on this mitigating factor. 499 The Prosecution’s submission at the appeal in respect of the benefit that had accrued to Sun Ho was met with strong objections from counsel for the appellants. For instance, counsel for Kong Hee submitted in reply that this was a “sudden change of [the Prosecution’s] undisputed and uninterrupted position below of no wrongful gain” and that this went against the position that the Prosecution took since the first day of trial.221Foot Note 221×Transcript, 21 September 2016, at pp 64-65.In fact, the Prosecution’s submission even prompted the majority in this court to question, on a few occasions, whether it contradicted the case that the Prosecution had run at trial, which appeared to be premised on the basis that wrongful gain was not a factor.222Foot Note 222×See,eg, Transcript, 21 September 2016, at p 23 and p 37. 500 For context, it is useful to set out what the Prosecution stated on the first day of trial that gave rise to the present state of affairs. It seems that clarification was sought specifically in relation to s 24 of the Penal Code on whether the Prosecution was relying on the limb of “wrongful loss” or “wrongful gain” (or perhaps both “wrongful loss” and “wrongful gain”). To this, the Prosecution clarified that it was relying only on “wrongful loss”, in the following manner:223Foot Note 223×Transcript, 15 May 2013, p 45. Your Honour, Mr Sreenivasan has also made the point about the prosecution not having specified whether we are alleging an intention to cause wrongful gain or wrongful loss. For the purposes of proving these charges, your Honour, it will be the prosecution's case that the mens rea of dishonesty as an element of the CBT charges can and will be made out by our showing an intention to cause wrongful loss, and we'll be adducing the necessary evidence. 501 It bears noting that causing “wrongful loss” to one party may or may not lead to a resulting “wrongful gain” to another party. An example of a person causing “wrongful loss” without resulting in any “wrongful gain” to anyone would be an arsonist physically damaging church property. In many cases, particularly those involving the misappropriation of monies, “wrongful loss” to a person often results in a corresponding “wrongful gain” at the same time to another person. An example would be the misappropriation of church monies for the benefit of the person committing the misappropriation or for the benefit of a related third party. These examples show that it does not follow that the presence of “wrongful loss” necessarily means that there has to beno“wrongful gain” whatsoever. Two alternatives are therefore present: the presence of “wrongful loss” without leading to “wrongful gain” and the presence of “wrongful loss” leading to “wrongful gain”. Without further clarification on which of the two alternatives is applicable, it is not surprising that misunderstandings may  arise leading one party to make an assumption favourable to itself when the other party may not have meant it that way. In any case, irrespective of which of the two alternatives is applicable, it was also not clear whether the Prosecution’s position that it would seek to prove anintentionon the part of the appellants to cause “wrongful loss” to CHC necessarily meant that there was thereforenoresulting gain or benefit of any kindfactually accruingto any person including a third party, like Sun Ho or Wahju, as a result of the criminal misappropriation, or that this was a consequential fact that the Prosecution was also accepting from the commencement of the trial. It bears further noting that the ambit of “wrongful gain” in this context was not defined or made clear by the parties to the court below whether it included all forms of gain (ie, both financial and non-financial, direct or indirect) conferred by the appellants on themselves and also all forms of gain (ie,both financial and non-financial, direct or indirect) conferred by the appellants on third parties. 502 As can be seen, the manner in which this issue was dealt with by the parties leaves matters in an unsatisfactory state. In my view, it is clear that Sun Ho had obtained a direct benefit – both financial and non-financial – and Kong Hee, as her husband, had necessarily obtained an indirect benefit – both financial and non-financial – from the use of the criminally misappropriated funds “for the purpose of funding one [Sun Ho’s] music career” as specified in the sham investment charges. Yet, because of the manner that this issue had been dealt with, these factors were not properly ventilated and were thus not taken into account by the Judge during sentencing. It also raises the difficult question of whether in these circumstances, all the relevant facts and circumstances affecting sentence, not limited only to those necessarily needed to prove the elements of and the particulars stated in the charges (including those not taken into account by the Judge), may now be taken into account by this court during an appeal against sentence. 503 I turn to this difficult question – which unfortunately relates not only to these two factors but also to the important factor of whether there was indeed permanent financial loss – from [548] onwards below. For now, I will explain and refer to some aspects of the evidence that lead me to my view that Sun Ho in fact obtained a direct financial and non-financial benefit and Kong Hee in fact obtained an indirect financial and non-financial benefit because of the funding of Sun Ho’s music career with monies dishonestly misappropriated from the BF of CHC pursuant to a conspiracy which Kong Hee himself had engaged in together with Ye Peng, Eng Han, John Lam and Serina. 504 To set the context, I accept that CHC may take the view that it could make use of an internationally renowned singing star to attract large groups of non-believers and then spread the Christian message to them as they gather together perhaps at a secular concert. I also note the Prosecution’s position that the theological legitimacy of such a means of evangelism is not an issue in the present case. Yet, even accepting the theological soundness of the Crossover, one would have expected that a sensible course of action would be to assess if the Crossover (ie, the use of popular culture for evangelical outreach) as a means of evangelism was prudent and cost-effective prior to embarking on the project. And, if it was accepted that the Crossover was in principle and in concept a worthwhile project for the church to undertake, the appellants as leaders of CHC in their various capacities ought to have carefully examined what would be the most cost-effective means to execute the Crossover, especially when large sums of monies, which were taken from donations made by churchgoers to CHC no less, were going to be expended. 505 For instance, could the more cost-effective method be to engage an already well-established and renowned singer with a large fan base who could just as well attract a very large secular crowd? Kong Hee could then suddenly appear on stage to preach to the captive audience as was indicated to the court when Eng Han was asked how the evangelisation could be effected via a secular mega-concert.224Foot Note 224×Transcript, 16 September 2016, pp 76–77.If so, there would then have been no need to undertake the huge financial risk of investing millions, if not tens of millions of dollars, into a venture to turn Sun Ho into an international singing star. In fact, in order to attract large and different crowds each time, it may well be that having the flexibility of engaging different internationally renowned singers each time would be more effective to gain a far wider outreach to different crowds rather than using the same singer (perhaps with the same fan base) all the time. With some imagination, numerous other feasible options could be explored to identify the option which would best achieve the same objective at perhaps the most reasonable cost. However, no proper evaluation of other alternatives and their cost-effectiveness appears to have been done by the appellants. The apparent single minded pursuit of only one option to use Sun Ho without even considering thepossibilityof other better and more cost-effective alternatives to achieve the same evangelisation objective itself raises questions as to whether at the back of it all, the appellants had a predominant motive to benefit Sun Ho specifically and to benefit Kong Hee indirectly, with evangelisation being just a distant objective. The undue preference by the appellants for this single option to the total exclusion of all others is compelling. 506 Against that backdrop, it is impossible, in my view, to characterise the appellants’ use of various covert devices to move monies out of CHC to aprivate company, Xtron, and later anotherprivate company, Firna, as anything other than the misappropriation of CHC’s funds for the purposes of privatelyinvestingin orfundingSun Ho’smusiccareerin the US. In fact, this is exactly what was stated in the charges. The sham investment charges all stated that the appellants had misappropriated CHC’s funds “for the purpose of funding [Sun Ho’s] music career”. With all the numerous and detailed Microsoft Excel spread sheets meticulously prepared to establish the projected revenues, expenses and the potentially huge net profits that would accrue to Xtron, and having regard to the terms of the artiste management agreements signed between Xtron and Sun Ho which were financially very advantageous to Sun Ho (see [508] below), it appears to me that making money out of their Investment was at the forefront of their motives. The appellants say that they were pursuing a “church purpose” in that the investment into Sun Ho’s music career was to advance the Crossover, but it is evident from the above analysis that though the aims of the Crossover and Sun Ho may have intersected, they would not have overlapped entirely. Although the plan was for Sun Ho to use the fame and influence derived from the Investment for evangelistic purposes via the Crossover, any assertion that the fame and influence Sun Ho obtained through the Investment did notalsodirectly benefit her and indirectly benefit her family (including her husband, Kong Hee) would, to my mind, be entirely contrived. 507 In my view, it is very clear from the evidence before the court that Sun Ho gained both a direct financial benefit as well as a direct non-financial benefit from the appellants’ use of the criminally misappropriated funds to fund her music career. Quite apart from whether her music career in the US would have taken off, Sun Ho had obtained a direct financial benefit once the funds were used for the purposes of and to fund her music career. On this issue, I agree with the Judge’s observations (though not with his subsequent treatment (or non-treatment) of this point) that she was the direct beneficiary of the use of the misappropriated funds. Indeed, I struggle to see what possible evidence can be adduced to show the contrary or how it can be argued otherwise given that Sun Ho’s music career was beingsponsoredthrough the use of those funds. 508 Apart from this, Sun Ho would have gained further financial benefits. In this regard, I find it pertinent to refer to the various artiste management agreements which Sun Ho signed with Xtron, and later, UA.225Foot Note 225×A-38, X-52, X-53 and A-40.These are undisputed documentary evidence. I do not believe that the appellants, in particular Kong Hee, were unaware of the advantageous terms in these agreements relating to Sun Ho. Instead, it appears clear to me from these undisputed documentary evidence that the appellants had an intention of benefitting Sun Ho financially. For instance, under the agreement between Sun Ho and Xtron (which was varied in January 2006), Sun Ho was to receive 25% of thegrossincome received by Xtron as well as a monthly salary of US$10,000. This means that if Xtron were to receive any sales revenue from her concerts, albums and tours including other licensing and merchandising activities, Sun Ho would have been entitled to 25% of that sum evenbeforeaccounting for any amounts that were expended to earn that income. Sun Ho was therefore always effectively in a position of net financial gain; any losses suffered would be borne exclusively by Xtron. The same framework was applied to her agreement with UA, under which she was entitled to 10% of thegrossincome as well as 100% of the royalties that UA received on her behalf from Justin’s company.226Foot Note 226×A-40.During the hearing, it was submitted that Sun Ho had always donated the monies which she received as an artiste to the church or to various other charitable causes. It is not clear whether this was in fact true, but even assuming that this was so, this does not change the fact that she wascontractually entitledto a substantial financial benefit without having to bear any of the corresponding risk. This was a benefit in and of itself. Apart from these direct financial benefits to Sun Ho, the use of the misappropriated funds to finance the development of her music career with the objective of turning her into a mega-star also conferred a direct non-financial benefit on Sun Ho in allowing her to build up her music career at CHC’s expense and to gain international fame and success for herself. 509 In my judgment, the very fact that Kong Hee is Sun Ho’s husband necessarily means that he must also have obtained a financial and non-financial benefit – albeit in an indirect way – from the use of the misappropriated funds on her and her career. It cannot escape notice that having the church pay for all the expenses involved in building up Sun Ho’s music career meant that Kong Hee and his family would not need to provide their personal funds for Sun Ho’s music career development. Just as this was a form of direct financial benefit to Sun Ho, it was an indirect financial benefit to Kong Hee. Equally, the income and potential profits that Sun Ho was entitled to were also a form of indirect financial benefit to him, while the fame and success that Sun Ho could gain (and gained) as a direct non-financial benefit to herself was also a form of indirect non-financial benefit to Kong Hee as her husband. Taken together, these factors would call for the imposition of a more severe sentence on Kong Hee than that imposed by the Judge as they would demonstrate that his motivations were not pure or altruistic, and that he was coloured by greed and self-interest. 510 In the light of the above, I find it somewhat perplexing that the Prosecution – at least up till the oral hearing before us when it appeared to have suddenly changed (or clarified) its position – chose to base its caseexclusivelyon the element of wrongful loss and to ignore all manner of gain to any party for the purposes ofbothconviction and sentence. But I must clarify one point in this regard. It isnotthat where the Prosecution chooses to run its case onconvictionon the basis of “wrongful loss” as opposed to “wrongful gain”, it is estopped from raising any evidence or making any submissions at thesentencing stageon benefits or gains that would accrue or had accrued to an accused person or a third party. Some of the submissions by the appellants come close to suggesting this. Even where the offence of CBT is premised on wrongful loss, it remains open to the Prosecution to raise the submission in sentencing that the offences had been committed for the benefit of an accused person or a third party. The problem in this case is not that the Prosecution had premised its case against the appellants exclusively on wrongful loss in respect only of proving the elements of the CBT Charges; it is that the Prosecution appears to have accepted, for the purposes ofbothconviction and sentence, that Kong Hee obtained no direct or indirect financial or non-financial benefitas a fact, and had further proceeded largely on the basis that any direct financial and non-financial benefit, though clearly present on the facts, to Sun Ho was also to be ignored. 511 These issues might have stemmed from the Prosecution’s acceptance or “concession” that the Crossover is synonymous with Sun Ho’s secular music activities and that the two may be used interchangeably (at [25] and [124] of the Conviction GD). I would have thought that the particulars of two of the three sham investment charges as framed are fairly clear in that the monies were dishonestly misappropriated “from the said Fundfor the purpose of funding one [Sun Ho’s] music career” [emphasis added]. The third sham investment charge as framed is even clearer with a dual purpose that the monies were dishonestly misappropriated “from the said Fundfor the purpose of funding one [Sun Ho’s] music careerandfor the purpose of providing funds to one Wahju Hanafi” [emphasis added]. The appellants were convicted on these charges without amendments to the particulars. All the three charges donotsay that the monies were dishonestly misappropriated “from the said Fundfor the sole purpose of funding CHC’s evangelisation” with no reference whatsoever to Sun Ho’s music career or Wahju. However, as a result of this “concession” by the Prosecution, it appears that the appellants may have sought tointerpretthe sham investment charges as meaning that the criminally misappropriated funds didnotconfer any direct benefit whatsoever on Sun Ho (and consequently, no indirect benefit on Kong Hee) but instead went wholly towards furthering the Crossover, a church purpose, as if these charges were amended to read that the monies were dishonestly misappropriated “for the sole purpose of funding CHC’s evangelisation” when it is patently not the case. As a result, the presence of benefits to Sun Ho and Kong Hee does not appear to have been properly ventilated at trial (although evidence in relation to the benefits was adduced before the court) and the appellants have not been given a full opportunity to address the court on them. I discuss the implications of this from [548] onwards below. 512 Before turning to the next factor, it should be pointed out that, as stated above, the misappropriation of the BF for the Firna bonds was not solely for the purpose of funding Sun Ho’s career, but was also “for the purpose of providing funds to one Wahju Hanafi” [emphasis added]. The Judge found that not all the Firna bond proceeds were intended to be used to fund the Crossover, and that out of the $11m drawn down on the Firna bonds, $2.5m of that was lent without interest to Wahju for his personal use (which included certain trading activities) (at [162] and [398] of the Conviction GD). In my view, the unequivocal and only inference to be drawn from the particulars of the third sham investment charge and the Judge’s corresponding finding is that the appellants’ criminal acts further resulted in a third party, Wahju, obtaining a large sum of money from the BF for hispersonal useunder a guise of a loan of monies to Firna.  This undoubtedly amounts to a clear form of direct financial benefit to Wahju that has been proven beyond reasonable doubt and which the court may have regard to for the purpose of sentencing. In my view, the presence of this fact means that where the third sham investment charge is concerned, the appellants’ motivations cannot be described as exclusively or solely altruistic.",
        "Whether the appellants acted in what they believed to be in CHC’s best interests and without an intention of causing CHC to suffer financial detriment": "513 The next issue is whether the appellants acted in what they believed to be in CHC’s best interests and without an intention of causing CHC to suffer financial detriment. The Judge appears to have accepted as mitigating facts that the appellants had acted in what they considered to be the best interests of CHC and without any intention to cause any harm to CHC (see,eg, the Conviction GD at [187] and [500] and the Sentencing GD at [4], [20] and [33]). In relation to the issue of whether the appellants intended to cause CHC to suffer financially, the Judge held that the appellants did not have an intention to cause CHC to suffer “permanent loss” seemingly for the following reasons: (a) In respect of the Xtron and Firna bonds, the Judge found the substance of these transactions to be a “temporary loan” or a “loan” of money from the BF to Kong Hee (and the other appellants) for the use on the Crossover (see [153] and [172] of the Conviction GD) which the appellants intended to repay sometime in the future, even though how they would do so might have been unclear (see [464] of the Conviction GD). (b) In respect of the ARLA, the Judge held that the appellants did not intend to cause CHC to suffer “permanent financial loss” because the “net effect of the transactions was that certain debts owed to CHC,viz, the Xtron and Firna bonds, would be substituted by another obligation, namely, the obligations owed under the ARLA, and there was thus no attempt to extinguish the debts owed to CHC” (at [52] of the Sentencing GD). However, having said this, the Judge acknowledged that had the ARLA not been rescinded, CHC would have suffered an actual loss of $3.2m which it was required to pay as GST under the ARLA (at [53] of the Sentencing GD). 514 In its submissions on appeal, the Prosecution submits that the Judge erred in giving undue weight to his finding that no “permanent loss” was intended to CHC because while the criminally misappropriated funds were ultimately returned to CHC, the means by which this was to be achieved was never specifically planned for by the appellants when they misappropriated CHC’s monies. Having failed to do so, the Prosecution argues that the appellants knowingly put CHC’s interests at risk. The Prosecution highlights that the Xtron and Firna bonds were “not investments intended to generate returns for CHC”, as claimed by some of the appellants. With regard to the round-tripping charges, the Prosecution also emphasises the potential loss of $3.2m as GST on CHC’s part and submits that this ought to be taken into account as a significant aggravating fact because the appellants were willing to “squander more than $3.2m of CHC’s money to pay GST on the sham ARLA” in order to perfect the deception created by the round-tripping transactions.227Foot Note 227×Prosecution’s sentencing submissions, paras 125–128; Transcript, 20 September 2016, p 96. 515 I disagree with a number of aspects of the Judge’s finding. In particular, I do not accept that the appellants believed, at all times, that they were acting in CHC’s best interests. Nor do I accept that the appellantsintendedno “permanent loss” to CHC. I agree, in this regard, with the submissions of the Prosecution as detailed in the paragraph above. However, the underlying basis and reasons for my holdings go somewhat further than the submissions of the Prosecution. Before dealing with my findings in detail, I first explain the concepts of “best interests” and “loss” and the relationship between them. 516 In the framework of the analysis that follows, the concept of whether the appellants acted in what they believed to be CHC’s best interests is the overarching topic that will be discussed. Whether the appellants may be said to have done so must be assessed in a holistic manner. The broad question is whether their conduct demonstrates that they pursued the course of action that they believed provided the greatest benefit and advantage to CHC. In this regard, I accept that in construing the benefit and advantage to CHC, this may include not only financial profit but also the realisation of other non-financial goals, such as evangelisation. At the same time, the question of whether the appellants acted in CHC’s best interests, and believed themselves to be doing so, cannot be divorced from the methods the appellants had employed to further their objectives. The comments I made at [504]–[505] above about the assessment of cost-effectiveness and other feasible alternatives when pursuing a particular aim are also relevant in this context. 517 The issue of whether the appellants intended to cause CHC to suffer financial loss is therefore a subset of this broader inquiry. To the extent that the appellants allowed CHC to enter into financially detrimental and unprofitable transactions in pursuit of other objectives whilst at the same time omitting to consider whether there were other more cost-effective and feasible alternatives to achieve their aims would, in my view, cast doubt on their assertion that they had at all times believed that they were acting in CHC’s best interests. 518 In this connection, there are a variety of ways in which one may be said to suffer financially. The approach which the Judge adopted views the issue of “loss” from theformof the transactions which the appellants caused CHC to enter into. Thus, he found that because the appellants intended, ultimately, to comply with the terms of the transactions, the appellants had thus not intended to cause “permanent loss” to CHC. 519 Whilst I accept that the Judge’s approach is one way of tackling the issue of whether CHC suffered “loss” (and whether the appellants had an intention to cause such “loss”), it would be, in my view, erroneous to centre the inquirysolelyon whether the appellants intended at some point in the future to comply with the terms of the transactions without going further to inquire if thesubstanceof the various transactions which the appellants caused CHC to enter into were fair and commercially justifiable in the first place. It is important, in this connection, not to conflate the appellants’ eventual return of certain monies on the terms of the various transactions (which only occurred in 2010 after the appellants faced the prospect of criminal investigation) with the inherent nature of the transactions that the appellants caused CHC to enter into. To take a simple example,ifthe appellants caused CHC to purchase high-risk bonds with a low interest rate of 4.5% per annum when they knew that the fair interest rate that the market would have demanded for such an investment ought to have been a much higher one of 16% per annum, the appellants would have intended to cause CHC to suffer losseven ifthe appellants hadalsointended to repay the bonds with the stated interest (at 4.5% per annum). Seen from this perspective, the evidence clearly demonstrates that the appellants had intended to short-change CHC on multiple fronts. 520 With the above in mind, I will analyse each of the transactions (ie, the Xtron bonds, the Firna bonds, and the ARLA (which was the mechanism by which the Xtron bonds and Firna bonds were redeemed)) to explain my view that the appellants did not genuinely believe that they were acting in CHC’s best interests when causing CHC to enter into these transactions. I will also consider specifically Kong Hee’s positionvis-à-visCHC, the Crossover and Sun Ho and whether he had acted in what he believed to be in CHC’s best interests in the light of that position. The Xtron bonds, Firna bonds and the ARLA 521 I begin with the Xtron bonds. The appellants submit that the Xtron bonds were a genuine investment meant to achieve two separate objectives for CHC,viz, evangelisation and financial profit. However, when the transaction is properly analysed, it becomes clear that financial profit for CHC was never a real consideration in the appellants’ calculations. In fact, CHC had clearly overpaid for the Xtron bonds as an “investment” into bond financial instruments. This is because the financial risk that CHC undertook in entering into the Xtron bonds was not commensurate with the interest returns payable under the 1st Xtron BSA. It would appear from the evidence that themarketrequired a substantially higher rate of return (sometimes referred to the effective “yield to maturity” of the bond) because of the relatively high risk of lending monies to Xtron. Not to factor in the magnitude of the financial risk involved, which forms an integral element of establishing the fair market return or the “yield to maturity” expected from bonds as an investment, is to ignore commercial reality. I have in mind, in this regard, the undisputed fact that Citic Ka Wah had demanded a much higher interest rate of 16% per annum on a loan of $9m to Xtron, a loss-making music production company (with hardly any assets) that was intending to use the entire loan proceeds to embark on perhaps a high-risk investment in Sun Ho as an artiste. From this perspective, CHC had clearly provided Xtron more value than what the Xtron bonds were in fact worth. Indeed, that this was the case is illustrated by the fact that in the middle of 2008, there were auditing concerns that the value of the Xtron bonds might have to be written down. In these circumstances, it is clear to me that the appellants did not have CHC’s financial best interests at heart when they caused CHC to enter into the 1st Xtron BSA that paid an interest rate of 7% per annum, which was substantially below what I would consider to be a fair market rate given the magnitude of the financial risks and the fact that Citic Ka Wah was demanding a much higher interest rate of 16% rate per annum for the level of risks involved. This disregard for CHC’s interests is further exemplified when non-repayment under the Xtron bonds appeared imminent. At this stage, the appellants were happy to amend the terms of the 1st Xtron BSA to CHC’s further detriment with the execution of the ABSA which extended the repayment period, decreased the interest rate payable and increased the maximum amount of funding for the Xtron bonds, without Xtron providing any valuable consideration for such variations to the terms (see also [482] above). 522 The appellants applied the same attitude to the Firna bonds. While it is true that Firna appeared to possess a profitable glass factory business, no commercial due diligence was done to ensure that a rate of interest of 4.5% per annum on a sum of up to $24.5m corresponded to an interest rate that would be fairly demanded by the market for bonds issued by Firna. Nor was a survey of other investment opportunities done to ensure that the Firna bonds were the best or most appropriate investment option for CHC out of the range of other bond options available in the market. This is clearly because the Firna bonds were not a genuine investment but were merely a façade or a convenient conduit employed by the appellants to extract even more funds from CHC for the purposes of financing Sun Ho’s secular music career and providing funds to Wahju for his personal use. Furthermore, the underlying truth of the transaction, which was that Firna would not be responsible for payment under the bonds, was hidden from public scrutiny. Even more appallingly, the appellants engineered the use of the secret letter, which cut down the protective features under the Firna BSA. Thus, even if it could be said that a return of 4.5% per annum reflected the fair market value of the returns to be expected from bonds issued by a company of Firna’s standing, the fact that material information about the transaction were undisclosed meant that the rate of interest of 4.5% per annum would not have reflected the real return that the market would have demanded if it had been aware of the true circumstances and purposes for which the bonds were issued, even on the assumption that there would be willing buyers for such Firna bonds, which I very much doubt there would be if all the material facts had been fully disclosed. Yet, these were the kind of bonds that the appellants caused CHC to invest in. 523 The above analysis thus shows that the appellants compromised on CHC’s financial interests by causing CHC to enter into unprofitable transactions for the purpose of extracting monies from CHC to fund Sun Ho’s music career (and also, where the Firna bonds are concerned, for the additional purpose of providing funds to Wahju for his personal use). The appellants also willingly put CHC’s legal welfare in jeopardy through the use of covert devices such as the secret letter which cut down on terms that were meant to give CHC proper legal protection. It is difficult to see, when these facts are considered, how it can be accepted that the appellants believed that they were acting in CHC’s best interests and had no intention to cause CHC to suffer financial loss of any kind at the time the transactions were entered into. 524 In fact, assuming that Sun Ho had achieved astronomic success in the US, the manner in which the appellants structured the various transactions would have ensured that Sun Ho’s success would not have accrued substantially, if at all, to CHC. The financial fruits of the Investment would have gone directly to Sun Ho and to the company which was managing her (ie, Xtron or UA). The only returns that CHC would receive on funding Sun Ho’s music career would then be the paltry interest it was to be paid under the Xtron and Firna bonds, which was not commensurate with the market interest that would be commercially demanded for bonds of such a high-risk nature offered by a company, especially one like Xtron, which was in a weak financial position and had minimal assets. It bears reiterating that Citic Ka Wah wanted to charge a much higher interest rate of 16% per annum on its loan to Xtron for the purposes of the Investment. I am inclined to believe that the bank would have evaluated the appropriate interest rate to charge for a commercial loan to Xtron on the basis of (a) the financial standing of Xtron, primarily as “a production house for music albums, concert organi[s]er, distributor, wholesaler, retailer of albums and compact discs”,228Foot Note 228×ASOF at para 2.12.which was intending to apply the whole loan proceeds to invest in Sun Ho as an artiste; and (b) the commercial viability, the risks and potential profits of thatsoleinvestment undertaken by Xtron without any diversification of that investment risk. I do not think that evangelisation in the name of the Crossover would have been a factor in the bank’s commercial considerations. Therefore, even putting aside the possible failure of the Investment undertaken by the appellants as their commercial project using Xtron as the corporate vehicle to do so (which failure could well result in Xtron collapsing financially, the Xtron bonds becoming valueless and the bond holder (ie, CHC) getting nothing back), the appellants nevertheless caused CHC to enter into these Xtron bond transactions which were, from the church’s perspective, patently risky and unfavourable. I do not see how it can be said that such an arrangement could be in CHC’s best interests or how the appellants could be said to have believed that these transactions could be in CHC’s interests when viewed from CHC’s perspective. 525 In respect of the round-tripping transactions, there was also in fact quantifiable financial loss suffered by CHC when the Xtron and Firna bonds were converted into an obligation on Xtron’s part to provide premises under the ARLA. It must be remembered that the stated purpose of the ARLA was to provide Xtron with a lump sum in order to procure premises for CHC. Clauses 5.1 and 5.2 of the ARLA state as follows:229Foot Note 229×A-153. 5.1 The Licensee [ie, CHC] recognizes that the Licensor [ie, Xtron] does not have permanent premises which it is able to designate as the Licensed Area, but that it is in the process of identifying and acquiring appropriate premises with which to do so. The parties further agree that part of the reason for the lump sum Licence Fee is to enable the Licensor to negotiate with the necessary third parties to secure the Licensed Area and guarantee the availability to the Licensee of the Licensed Area for the Appointed Days [ie, days which CHC requires to use the area]. 5.2 The Licensor agrees that it will, in a timely manner, procure reasonably acceptable premises for the Licensee as the Licensed Area… 526 The licence under the ARLA was for a period of eight years commencing on 1 October 2009. The rental payable under the ARLA was $7m per year for a period of eight years.230Foot Note 230×E-28.As Xtron would be receiving funds upfront, a discount of 5% was applied to arrive at the net present value of approximately $46m which formed the licence fee under the ARLA. During the hearing, Eng Han informed the court that he had derived the rental amount of $7m per year by estimating what it would cost to rent the convention hall at Suntec City231Foot Note 231×Transcript, 16 September 2016, p 92.(though, as I have noted above at [483], there is little contemporaneous evidence to substantiate Eng Han’s assertion). 527 At the time of the ARLA, Xtron had no premises of such worth to provide and was in the process of procuring these premises. It appears that in place of the premises to be procured, Xtron was at the time providing premises at Expo, which, according to Eng Han, was apparently worth $2.5m per annum.232Foot Note 232×Transcript, 16 September 2016, pp 99–100.Despite this, CHC was required to pay the full rental sum over a period of eight years discounted to present value. What this means is that under the ARLA, CHC hadpaidfor the right to occupy a set of premises worth a rental of $7m per year for eight years when Xtron in fact had no premises of that worth to offer. A simple example will illustrate the loss CHC suffered inentering intothe ARLA. Suppose that Xtron only procured suitable premises for CHC at Suntec City two years after the ARLA had been entered into, on 1 October 2011, and that for those two years, Xtron had only been providing premises at Expo (worth $2.5m per annum). Under the ARLA, CHC would only have the right to occupy the premises at Suntec City for a further six years (as the ARLA would expire on 1 October 2017). This did not give CHC what it paid for; indeed, under the example, CHC would have lost out on two years’ worth of premises at Suntec City. On a simple linear calculation, CHC would have in fact financially lost out on $4.5m per annum for everyyearit was required to use the premises at Expo instead of those at Suntec City despite having paid in full for rental to occupy premises that were supposed to have been in Suntec City for those two years. In other words, although CHC contracted to receive eight years’ worth of premises worth $7m per annum from the date of the ARLA, CHC did not receive its money’s worth as Xtron had no premises of that worth to provide at that juncture, and in fact only provided premises worth much less than what CHC had actually paid for. CHC had thus been overcharged by a huge amount of $4.5m per annum as it was only provided with the premises at Expo. This constituted real financial loss to CHC at the time the ARLA was executed. Accordingly, CHC was, as a result of the ARLA, made to suffer financial loss at the rate of $4.5m for every year that it did not have the Suntec City premises to use. 528 As exemplified by the above illustration, it is clear that the ARLA was not an agreement that was in CHC’s best interests. Immediate substantial financial loss was caused to CHC once it agreed to and executed the ARLA on the terms as set out. The agreement was structured to disadvantage CHC financially from the beginning. An agreement of this nature was not one that the appellants ought to have caused CHC to enter into, even assuming that the ARLA was a genuine agreement for advance rental. Additionally, at the time the ARLA was executed, there wasno suggestionthat the appellants intended to rescind the ARLA and repay the monies thereunder sometime in the future. In the circumstances, I find it very difficult to accept the point made by all the parties (including the Judge) that the round-tripping transactions merely allowed for the substitution of debts and did not in fact cause CHC to suffer any financial loss save for the GST sum. Indeed, based on the above, at the time CHC executed and made payment to Xtron under the ARLA, apart from the possible loss of more than $3m paid in GST, CHC also suffered a loss of monies as the advance rental was paid on the basis of immediate occupancy even though Xtron had no premises of that worth to offer. This was “permanent loss” that the appellantsintendedfor CHC to bear at the time the ARLA was executed, and theirsubsequentdecision to rescind the ARLA in no way impinges on this. In my judgment, Eng Han, Ye Peng, Serina and Sharon could not have believed that the ARLA would have been in CHC’s best interests; indeed, I find that in causing CHC to execute the ARLA, they clearlyintendedto cause CHC to suffer financial loss and to cause a third party private company, Xtron, to gain financially. Conflict of interest on Kong Hee’s part 529 Apart from the various transactions and the manner in which they were structured, I also find that Kong Hee did not act in the best interests of CHC. As Sun Ho’s husband, Kong Hee was undoubtedly in a position of conflict where CHC’s monies were to be spent on building up Sun Ho’s secular music career and making her a singing artiste with international fame. Kong Hee had on a number of occasions even indicated that he was willing to go the extra mile for Sun Ho (see, in this regard, the examples cited by the Judge at [316] of the Conviction GD). Whilst it appeared that Kong Hee was acting in Sun Ho’s best interests, it is not an ineluctable proposition that the best interests of Sun Ho’s music career would at all times coincide with CHC’s best interests. Given these various areas for potential (or actual) conflict of interest, it is incumbent upon Kong Hee to ensure that all that he did with respect to the relationship between CHC and Sun Ho’s music career, especially where this involved the use of CHC’s funds, was above-board. This would be the casea fortiorisince Kong Hee was also the head of the church, with the responsibility to be a good custodian of the charity funds which CHC raised. However, Kong Hee abused the trust placed in him and failed to ensure that he was totally transparent and honest with the CHC Management Board, the EMs, the members of CHC and the professionals who were advising him or even with the other appellants. Indeed, there were various instances where he made false or misleading statements (see, for example, those cited by the Judge at [301]–[302] of the Conviction GD and [15] of the Sentencing GD). 530 In the circumstances, quite apart from the issue of whether Kong Hee received any indirect benefit and could therefore be said to be motivated by greed and self-interest, I find that Kong Hee did not act in the best interests of CHC when he used CHC’s funds to invest in Sun Ho’s music career. Rather, it appears to me that Kong Hee used the BF as his personal funds from which he could draw down without limit and spend on building up his wife’s singing career in the name of the Crossover. In misappropriating the BF, Kong Hee ultimately obtained a heavily subsidised loan from CHC to fund his wife’s secular music career in conflict with CHC’s best interests, while – at least at the beginning – harbouring high hopes that the Investment would make so much money that he would be able to return the monies criminally misappropriated. Kong Hee could only have done all of this with the participation of John Lam, Ye Peng, Eng Han and Serina, who assisted and supported him in conceiving of and administering the illicit schemes. I find that Kong Hee was the leader of the conspiracy which caused harm to CHC. I will however leave open the question whether Kong Hee had harboured a thought or a belief at the time the sham investment offences were committed that he would be able to get away with the misappropriation of massive amounts of CHC’s monies under the cover of the Crossover in the event that the Investment should turn out to be unsuccessful and the monies could not be repaid. If he did, that would have been a very serious aggravating factor to be considered for the purpose of sentencing. Concluding remarks on this factor 531 In the light of the above, I donotaccept that the appellants acted with CHC’s best interests at heart or had no intention of causing CHC to suffer financial loss as a result of the various transactions. Though my treatment of this aggravating factor goes somewhat further than the Prosecution’s submissions, all the matters which I have referred to above are based on the evidence that is already before the court. Moreover, the issue of whether the appellants acted in what they believed to be CHC’s best interests and without any intention of causing CHC to suffer financial loss was the crux of the appellants’ submissions at trial and on appeal and thus, the appellants had been given ample opportunity to be heard on these issues. In rejecting the appellants’ submissions on the basis of the evidence before the court, my findings in this regard do not run into the same hurdles which I will address from [548] onwards below. Accordingly, I am of the view that, to the extent that the Judge had imposed a lower sentence on the appellants on the basis that they had acted with CHC’s best interests at heart and had no intention of causing CHC to suffer financial loss, this is erroneous.",
        "Whether CHC suffered permanent financial loss": "532 The issue of whether the appellants hadintendedto cause CHC to suffer financial loss at the time they caused CHC to enter into the various transactions is a different question from whether CHC hadin factsufferedpermanentfinancial loss (ie, financial loss that is continuing evenafterthe appellants had made restitution to CHC). 533 The latter question entails two separate considerations. The first consideration is whether CHC may be said to have suffered permanent financial loss as a result of the use of its funds for the Xtron and Firna bonds, notwithstanding the fact that these bonds were later redeemed. This consideration arises, amongst other things, because of the opportunity cost involved in the use of CHC’s funds for the Xtron and Firna bonds. In other words, if the appellants had not criminally misappropriated CHC’s funds for the Xtron and Firna bonds, CHCmayhave used the monies to invest in other financial instruments which may have allowed it to obtain a greater return for thesameamount of financial risk taken. I emphasise again that the amount of fair return expected must always be assessed having regard to the amount of financial risk taken when performing any financial evaluation. Regrettably, however, there was a lack of focus during the trial on the precise financial aspects of these transactions. No evidence was led on comparable market values or investments for comparable risks where these were relevant to the transactions in order to assess the actual financial loss suffered by CHC. Thus, though it seems to me entirely likely that CHC suffered permanent financial loss as a result of the entry into (and subsequent redemption of) the Xtron and Firna bonds, it is difficult to ascertain theactual amountthat CHC may be said to have permanently lost as a result of the various transactions on the basis of the material before the court for the purpose of sentencing. 534 However, a very broad estimate may be made which still remains useful and relevant for sentencing. For instance, with respect to the 1st Xtron BSA, the example of the loan of $9m offered by Citic Ka Wah to Xtron demonstrated that the interest rate that would have been fairly demanded by the market for the purchase of such bonds would have been a rate of about 16% per annum. However, under the 1st Xtron BSA, Xtron was only required to pay CHC an interest of 7% per annum. On this basis,even ifthe bonds were fully redeemed with the payment of interest at 7% per annum, CHC effectively subsidised Xtron by being unable to collect the difference of 9% of interest per annum which it would have ordinarily otherwise have earned had the 1st Xtron BSA been a genuine arms-length commercial transaction. This means that CHC would effectively have lost out on $1.17m of interest per annum on the $13m which it lent to Xtron under the 1st Xtron BSA. This was further exacerbated when the interest rate was subsequently decreased from 7% to 5% per annum by the execution of the ABSA. As may be seen from this broad estimate, it is very likely that CHC suffered substantial and continuing losses as a result of the various bond transactions which the appellants caused CHC to enter into despite the fact that the bonds were subsequently redeemed with full payment of the stipulated bond interest. 535 The second consideration concerns the purported “full restitution” made by the appellants when they realised that their misdeeds might be publicly exposed. The “full restitution” to which I refer concerns the rescission of the ARLA on 31 March 2010 and the subsequent return of $40.5m from Xtron to CHC on 4 October 2010. To recapitulate, the sum of $40.5m comprised (a) $33,039,117.60 being theunutilisedadvance rental that had, at the material time, been paid by CHC; (b) $7m being the full amount of the security deposit paid by CHC; and (c) $453,103.02 being the interest accrued from the date of the termination of the ARLA until full payment was made.233Foot Note 233×ASOF at para 12.37.The pertinent question, in this regard, is whether as a result of this repayment, CHC suffered no loss in entering into the ARLA and the round-tripping transactions. 536 I do not agree that the repayment made by the appellants amounted to “full restitution”. In my view, besides the interest that had accrued from the date of termination of the ARLA until full payment, interest also ought to have been paid on the unutilised licence fee that CHC had paid Xtron from the time of payment to the date the ARLA had been rescinded. This is because during this period, Xtron had the full use of CHC’s monies. If the purpose had in fact been to compensate CHCfullyfor the termination of the ARLA, Xtron ought to have, in the ordinary course, paid interest also on the sums it received from CHC from the time it received those sums to the time those sums were eventually returned. In my view, this entire sum of interest which ought to have been paid wasnotfully paid. The shortfall in the amount represents the actual and permanent financial loss suffered by CHC. It cannot therefore be said that the appellants had madefullrestitution of the misappropriated sums together with interest. 537 The Prosecution appears to accept that as a result of the appellants’ “full restitution” that CHC sufferednopermanent financial loss. This is, in my view, factually inaccurate for the reasons aforementioned. However, as a result of the Prosecution’s position, the permanent financial loss suffered by CHC as a result of the entry into the Xtron and Firna bond transactions as well as the shortfall in the so-called “full restitution” was not dealt with, and the appellants did not have an opportunity to address the court on these points. As in relation to the issues surrounding the direct benefit to Sun Ho and the indirect benefit to Kong Hee, I discuss the implications of this from [548] onwards below.",
        "The mitigating impact of the appellants’ restitution": "538 The last factor to which I turn to consider is the mitigating impact of the appellants’ restitution. Whether the fact of restitution counts in an accused’s favour must depend on all the facts of the case. In particular, where the act of restitution indicates genuine remorse on the accused’s part, this may be a ground on which the sentence could be reduced (seeKrishan Chand v Public Prosecutor[1995] 1 SLR(R) 737 at [13]). In the present case, however, there is unequivocal documentary evidence showing that the appellants’ motive for rescinding the ARLA was to pre-empt any investigation by the authorities and to avert any suspicion of dishonesty. In an email from Kar Weng, a CHC member and a director and shareholder of Xtron, to Kong Hee on 31 March 2010 (the same day the ARLA was terminated), Kar Weng discussed a “worst case” scenario, which involved considering “[i]f the authorities view[ed] all the parties as related and look[ed] at all these as 1 project, [would] there be a case of CBT?”.234Foot Note 234×E-240.This clearly demonstrated that the concern within the top leadership of CHC was that they could be exposed to criminal liability. One of the solutions Kar Weng alluded to in the email was a plan formulated by Ye Peng and Eng Han “to wipe out Xtron’s losses (for the album project) as well as repay CHC’s Advance Rental”. Kar Weng believed that the plan was “workable” and stated that it would be better to embark on the plan as soon as possible. It is therefore no surprise that the ARLA was terminated on the same day this conversation took place. 539 In a conversation over BlackBerry a few days later on 5 April 2010, Kar Weng, Sun Ho, Kong Hee, Ye Peng and Eng Han, among others, discussed the possibility of a special audit. What Kar Weng said is notable and I quote him in full here:235Foot Note 235×BB-1. Sun [ie, Sun Ho], one of the main reasons why I proposed the Special Audit is to buy us time to fill up the hole. We don’t want all the issue to grow to the extend [sic] that the authorities step in BEFORE we fill up the hole. By appointing our auditors, it will be easier to talk and get things done. If the report turns out to be lacking in some areas, we will improve and change. They can help us. That’s why to me, it is important to let the relevant authorities know that we initiate a special audit. They will at least not do anything till the report comes out. By then, the hole is filled. 540 The above demonstrates two important points. First, the appellants were aware that they had created a “hole” in Xtron (and correspondingly, CHC) which had to be filled. The appellants required time to source for funds to allow Xtron to repay the outstanding sums to CHC under the newly rescinded ARLA. This demonstrates their awareness that the advance rental liability under the ARLA was not proper and that this had to be rectified. Second, the appellants’ desire to “fill up the hole” was not motivated by genuine remorse but by a desire to avoid detection, with a sense of urgency coming from the need to do so before closer scrutiny by the authorities. The Judge’s observation at [53] of the Sentencing GD is also pertinent in this context. 541 Apart from the motive for doing so, themannerin which the appellants went about procuring funds to “fill up the hole” also severely limits the mitigating weight that can be accorded to the appellants for this. To obtain funds quickly, Kong Hee, Ye Peng and Eng Han were involved in sourcing for a number of external loans that would be pumped into Xtron. It appears that these loans, amounting to a sum of approximately $30m, were procured from individuals affiliated to the appellants or CHC.236Foot Note 236×E-356 and E-557.In an excel sheet prepared by Serina dated on 15 April 2010, Serina detailed these loans, and titled that sheet “What we need to pay back CHC”. 542 It is not clear from the evidence whether three of the four individuals who provided the loans to CHC (detailed in the excel sheet as “Surhardiman”, “Labelindo” and “Roy Tirtaji”; the fourth individual was Wahju) were affiliated to CHC or members of the church. More evidence in this regard would have been helpful. For instance, if these funds or part of these funds that had been loaned were funds that these persons had originally intended to bedonatedto CHC, I would consider this an additional aggravating factor rather than a mitigating factor since the appellants’ acts would then have effectively kept CHC out of funds that it would have receivedbut forthe appellants’ wrongdoing. However, as there was scant evidence concerning this, I say no more about it. 543 To facilitate the repayment of the outstanding sums to CHC under the rescinded ARLA, Serina maintained a loan schedule setting out the timing for the loans to be disbursed to Wahju. Wahju was then supposed to transfer the monies to Xtron. Wahju was included as an intermediary to channel the external loans to Xtron as the appellants sought to create the impression that he was putting his own money into Xtron in fulfilment of a personal guarantee he had purportedly given in favour of Xtron in 2007 to underwrite any losses suffered. In reality, this guarantee was drafted only by Serina on Eng Han’s instructions in March 2010 and backdated to 2007.237Foot Note 237×E-341 and E-254.To provide assurance to Wahju that the guarantee was merely cosmetic, Eng Han also instructed Serina to draft a cross-guarantee by,inter alia, Kong Hee, Ye Peng and Eng Han in favour of Wahju, in the event the personal guarantee he had given had to be called upon.238Foot Note 238×SWGY-2, SWGY-3 and SWGY-5. 544 It is therefore clear that the appellants did not intend that Wahju would be responsible for repaying the external loans. Instead, it was Kong Hee, Ye Peng, Eng Han and Serina who took it upon themselves to raise money for repayment. Eng Han’s proposal for repaying the external loans was to implement a scheme whereby he would invest CHC’s surplus funds at an agreed rate of 5% interest while aiming to achieve a 16% return. The surplus 11% return on the investment of funds could then be used to repay the external loans.239Foot Note 239×SeeegBB-39, BB-41, E-557. 545 It is not clear if this plan was ever carried out. Be that as it may, what it demonstrates is that in spite of all the controversy surrounding the appellants and their acts at that material time, they had nevertheless, at least at one point, intended or considered using CHC’s funds as “investment capital” so as to generate funds to repay the external loans taken. This again demonstrates that the appellants still viewed CHC’s funds as monies which they could control and use for whichever purpose best suited their needs. In the light of such facts, there is little weight, if any, that can be given to the fact of restitution. Indeed, I would venture so far as to say that the appellants’ conduct inconsidering, once again, to misuse CHC’s funds despite the spectre of criminal liability demonstrates their lack of remorse (and this is quite apart from their insistence of their complete innocence both at trial and at the appeal).",
        "The appeals against sentence": "546 In the light of the above, I turn now to consider the appeals against sentence. It will be apparent from the above discussion that I disagree with the Judge (and the majority) on a few issues, which have a bearing on the sentences that should have been imposed. First, I am of the view that the evolution of the appellants’ mind-sets and motives over the various periods ought to have been taken into account in the sentencing equation. Second, I am of the view that in respect of all the sham investment charges, Sun Ho had directly benefitted from the use of the funds to advance her music career and that Kong Hee had indirectly benefitted from that, and, in respect of the third sham investment charge specifically, a direct financial benefit was also conferred upon Wahju. Third, it appears clear to me that, for various reasons, the appellants’ motives were not purely altruistic. Fourth, I do not accept that the appellants were acting in the best interests of CHC and had no intention of causing CHC to suffer financial detriment at the time the various transactions were entered into. Fifth, I do not agree that no permanent financial loss has been caused to CHC. Lastly, I will also ascribe far less mitigating weight to the fact that the monies were returned. 547 If I were able to take all the above into consideration, I would not hesitate to allow the Prosecution’s appeals and substantially increase the sentences of the appellants, in particular those of Kong Hee. The question then is whether I ought to do so. This question arises because three of the above issues – namely, (a) whether there was indirect benefit to Kong Hee; (b) whether there was direct benefit to Sun Ho; and (c) whether CHC continued to suffer permanent financial loss despite restitution having been made – were not properly ventilated at trial or even on appeal. It appears that the parties were of the mutual view that there was no indirect benefit to Kong Hee and that CHC suffered no permanent loss because full restitution was made. There also appears to be some confusion and misunderstanding between the parties concerning the relevance of the direct benefit to Sun Ho by the funding of her music career to the appellants’ conviction and sentence (see [498] and [510] above). As I have alluded to above, this has resulted in a rather unsatisfactory state of affairs. It also raises some difficult questions. 548 The first question that it raises is whether in dealing with a case like the present, the court is in law precluded from (a) considering any reliable factual evidence that is already properly admitted before the court; and (b) making any legitimate inferences of fact therefrom simply because all the partieshave agreed internally among themselves or have all chosen(i) not to rely on that evidence in their submissions; (ii) to treat that evidence as if it has been expunged from the record; or worse (iii) to treat as factually true what is on the reliable evidence established to be factually untrue. In short, what does a court do when the parties mutually agree on a position (eg, that there is no permanent financial loss as a result of the appellants’ restitution) but the court is of the view that that position appears contrary to the facts? A potential objection or concern that comes to mind is that the party whom the court is minded to find against will be prejudiced in not having been afforded the opportunity to run his case in a different manner,eg, to tender certain evidence or make certain submissions to defend himself against that point. 549  Another equally difficult, or perhaps even more difficult, question is what the court is to do when it transpires that the parties had misunderstood each other’s position and thought that they were agreed on an issue when they were not, and as a result of this misunderstanding, one party has (or both have) been deprived of the chance to pursue the case or the defence in a certain direction. 550 The first question, which contemplates a situation where the parties have an intact agreement on an issue but the court does not agree with their position and is of the view that the evidence shows otherwise, arises in respect of the issues of (a) whether there was an indirect benefit to Kong Hee; and (b) whether CHC continued to suffer permanent financial loss despite restitution having being made. As far as it appears to me, the Prosecution had consistently proceeded on the basis that neither of these factors were present. The second question, which contemplates a situation where the parties thought they had agreed on an issue but in fact had not, arises in respect of the issue of whether Sun Ho had obtained a direct benefit from the use of the misappropriated funds and whether the appellants had intended as such. While the parties appeared to have all proceeded in the court below and even in their written submissions on appeal that the presence of a direct benefit to Sun Ho is not a factor that would be raised in the sentencing context, what transpired in the oral hearing before us indicates that the parties may not have fully understood each other and may have been talking at cross-purposes. 551 Although in this case these two questions arise at the appellate stage, they can equally arise at first instance (eg, at the end of trial or when closing submissions are made by the parties). I have not had the benefit of submissions from the parties on these questions, but in my provisional view (without deciding this issue), the common principle that governs how the court should act in all the above situations – whether it be in either of the two situations and whether it be at first instance or on appeal – is that the rules of natural justice must be adhered to. My view, in essence, is that a court shouldnotbe precluded from considering any reliable factual evidence that is admitted and making legitimate inferences of fact therefrom even if parties have agreed that the position on the issue is otherwise,providedthat the party whom the court is provisionally minded to find against is afforded an opportunity to be properly heard. 552 In this regard, I consider that some guidance may be obtained from the principles set out in the case ofR v Robert John Newton(1982) 4 Cr App R (S) 388 (“Newton”) (from which the phrase “Newtonhearing” is derived), even though the situation there – dealing with a situation involving a divergence of facts between an offender’s mitigation and the Prosecution’s case – is not on all fours with the situations we are presently discussing. InNewton, the English Court of Appeal set out three options that a sentencing court has when dealing with a divergence of facts between an offender’s mitigation and the Prosecution’s case. Only the second and third options are relevant as the first option relates to a system with juries. The Court of Appeal held that where there is such a divergence, the court could: (a)  either hear evidence from both sides and decide the fact – in what we now know as aNewtonhearing (“the Second Option”); or (b) just hear submissions of counsel and come to a conclusion (“the Third Option”). The court was quick to add that where the Third Option was adopted (ie, a decision is made on submissions, without hearing evidence in aNewtonhearing) and “where there is a substantial conflict between the two sides, [the court] must come down on the side of the [offender]”. Subsequent cases have further clarified thatNewtonhearings should be “the exception rather than the norm and should not ordinarily be convened unless the court is satisfied that it is necessary to do so in order to resolve a difficult question of fact that is material to the court’s determination of the appropriate sentence” (seeNg Chun Hian v Public Prosecutor[2014] 2 SLR 783 at [24]). 553 While the situations that we are presently discussing are quite different from what was envisaged inNewton, I am of the view that a similar approach – undergirded by the principles of natural justice and fairness to the accused person – should apply. Where a court – be it a first instance or an appellate court – disagrees with the parties (or one party) notwithstanding a prior agreement between the parties or somebona fideconfusion among them that might have led one or some of them reasonably to omit to put forward certain evidence or make certain submissions, the court should first invite the parties to submit on its provisional view. This may occur during the scheduled hearing or at a subsequent hearing if the court arrives at its view at a later stage. This would afford the party whom the court’s provisional view is against a chance to mount a defence whether with or without further evidence and to make further submissions to persuade the court otherwise. 554 In the event that the party is of the view that he has to put in further evidence to defend himself and persuade the court otherwise which he would have done had there not been such an agreement or confusion, the court must then make a judgment as to whether further evidence – which would entail either a re-opening of the trial (if this occurs at first instance) or remitting the case to the first instance court to take in further evidence (if this occurs on appeal) only on that limited aspect – is required. This decision would depend on, among other things, the importance and relevance of the point in dispute and whether further evidence is indeed necessary. As withNewtonhearings, the taking of further evidence should be the exception rather than the norm and should not ordinarily be convened unless the court is satisfied it is necessary to do so. Where the situation occurs on appeal, the threshold that has to be reached for the court to decide to remit the matter to the lower court to take in more evidence would, in my provisional view, be even higher. 555 If the court is of the view that further evidence may help the accused but decides that it should not be taken after weighing the considerations, the court should then resolve the matter in the accused’s favour when considering the submissions of the parties on the issue without the benefit of the further evidence (ie, the Third Option set out inNewton). 556 Returning to the situation in the present case, my view is that in the light of how the proceedings and arguments had ensued as a result of the parties’ agreement (for the two issues of indirect benefit to Kong Hee and permanent financial loss) and the confusion (for the issue of direct benefit to Sun Ho), I should not take into account all these three factors. Given that these three factors are all major and material aggravating factors, I would not be prepared to take these factors into account without first hearing from the appellants. And while I may have ordinarily asked for submissions from the parties and hear what the appellants have to say about my view based on the evidence before the court that there is permanent loss, and that benefits have accrued to Kong Hee and Sun Ho, I do not think it is appropriate or necessary to do so in this case, considering the circumstances as well as the fact that I am in the minority. 557 Once I leave these three major aggravating factors aside, there is, in my view, insufficient basis to allow the Prosecution’s appeals against sentence. While I disagree with some of the Judge’s findings including some of the mitigating factors that he had taken into account, and am therefore inclined to the view that some of the sentences imposed by the Judge in respect of the CBT Charges are at the low end of the sentencing spectrum, I am unable to say – without these three major aggravating factors – that the sentences imposed by the Judge aremanifestlyinadequate such that they would justify appellate intervention.",
