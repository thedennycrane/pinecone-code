        "Introduction": "1       The\nplaintiff was a candidate for the degree of Master of Arts in Architecture\nin the School of Design and Environment of the defendant. The plaintiff\nfiled the present action against the defendant for wrongful termination\nof her candidature. 2       The\nplaintiff applied to amend her statement of claim (“SOC”). Extensive\namendments were proposed. The defendant objected only to three sub-paragraphs\nin the proposed amended SOC,ie,\nsub-paras 9.2.36 to 9.2.38, as they referred specifically to two\nemails from the Ministry of Education (“MOE”) to the plaintiff dated\n26 August 2011 and 13 September 2011 (“the MOE Emails”). The defendant\nobjected on the basis that the MOE Emails were sent on a without\nprejudice basis and were therefore privileged from disclosure. The\ndefendant also submitted that a court had previously ruled that\nthe MOE Emails were privileged and therefore the principle ofres judicataprecluded the plaintiff from\nreferring to the MOE Emails. Alternatively, if there was no previous\nruling on the without prejudice issue, the defendant submitted that\nthe MOE Emails do enjoy such a privilege because they were sent\non a without prejudice basis and hence the disputed sub-paragraphs\nshould not be allowed. The plaintiff disputed that there was a previous\nruling on the issue. She also disputed that the MOE Emails were\nsent on a without prejudice basis. 3       An\nassistant registrar (“AR”) rejected the defendant’s objection. The defendant\nappealed. After hearing arguments, I allowed the appeal as I concluded\nthat the MOE Emails were sent on a without prejudice basis. Therefore\nthe disputed sub-paragraphs were not to be included in the amended\nSOC. I set out below my reasons.",
        "Issues": "4       The\nfirst issue was whether there was a previous ruling that the MOE Emails\nwere sent on a without prejudice basis. 5       If\nnot, the second issue was whether the MOE Emails were sent on a without\nprejudice basis.",
        "Background": "6       On\n28 June 2013, the plaintiff applied for further discovery of documents\nin various categories. For Category 7, she requested production of\nall documents and/or correspondence between the officers and agents\nof the defendant and MOE for the period 9 May 2011- 15 August 2011,\nwhich was later changed to 13 September 2011 (“the Category 7 Documents”). 7       On\n12 September 2013, AR Shaun Leong dismissed the plaintiff’s entire\napplication for discovery including her application for the Category\n7 Documents. 8       The\nplaintiff appealed against that decision in Registrar’s Appeal No 320\nof 2013 (“the Discovery Appeal”). The Discovery Appeal was heard\nand dismissed by Tan Siong Thye JC (as he then was) on 5 November\n2013. 9       Thereafter,\nthe plaintiff sought leave to appeal against Tan JC’s decision.\nThe application for leave was dismissed by Tan JC on 15 January 2014. 10     On\n29 May 2014, the plaintiff applied to amend her SOC by way of Summons\nNo 2671 of 2014. The proposed amendments included the disputed sub-paragraphs\nwhich referred specifically to the MOE Emails. 11     As\nmentioned above, the defendant objected only to those sub-paragraphs.",
        "The arguments of the parties\non the first issue": "12     The\napplication to amend the SOC was heard by the same AR who heard\nthe plaintiff’s previous application for further discovery of documents. 13     The\ndefendant argued that the two earlier decisions of AR Leong and Tan\nJC in respect of the application for further discovery had decided\nthat the MOE Emails were sent on a without prejudice basis. Therefore,res judicataapplied and it was not open\nto the plaintiff to argue otherwise. 14     The\ndefendant referred to AR Leong’s brief grounds of decision in his earlier\ndecision where he said at [8]: With regard to the documents in category\n7, the supporting affidavit (at [62] and [63]) states that “the\n[d]efendant has glaringly not disclosed any communications between\nthemselves and MOE for the period subsequent to their official response\nto MOE, i.e. after 9 May 2011… It was not explained however, how\n“all documents and/or correspondence” between the officers and agents\nof the defendant and MOE for the period 9 May 2011 to 15 August\n2011 (which was subsequently amended to 13 September 2011), as sought\nfor in the application, were relevant to the pleaded issues. There\nwas also no such explanation in the plaintiff’s written submissions.\nI am also unsure of the basis in which the plaintiff could make\nsuch a wide demand for “all documents and/or correspondence” between\nthe defendant and MOE during the stated period without specifying\nthe precise documents in which it seeks, and the reasons for doing\nso.If the plaintiff is seeking the disclosure\nof any admissions made by the defendant in its correspondence with\nMOE in relation to the pleaded disputes, which I must clarify here,\nis not stated by the plaintiff, I am of the view that such admissions\nand correspondence would in fact be of a “without prejudice” nature\nand hence not subject to discovery, as the facts show that MOE was\nacting in a mediatory capacity in a genuine attempt to assist the\nplaintiff and the defendant to reconcile their differences.[emphasis\nadded] 15     However,\nnotwithstanding his earlier observation, AR Leong rejected the defendant’s\nobjection to the disputed sub-paragraphs when he heard the plaintiff’s\napplication to amend her SOC on 23 July 2014. This is what AR Leong\nsaid in respect of the disputed sub-paragraphs: Court’s\nBrief Grounds of decision … The defendant’s basis for its objection\nto the disputed paragraphs is that these paragraphs contain references\nto documents and/or communications that have already been determined\nby the Court to be without prejudice and privileged. The defendant\nsubmits that the plaintiff is seeking to re-litigate issues which\nhave already been determined by the court, and that the doctrine\nof res judicata forbids the plaintiff from raising this issue again. I disagree with the defendant. First, it\nis very important to determine what the precise issues in question\nare. In the discovery application before me, the question and threshold\nwhich I had to determine was whether the documents sought to be\ndiscovered were relevant and necessary to the pleaded issues in question.\nI face a different question in the present amendment application before\nme, which is, whether the proposed amendments would enable the real\nquestions or issues in controversy between the parties be determined\n(seeReview Publishing Co Ltd and another v\nLee Hsien Loong and another appeal[2010] 1 SLR 52).\nSeen in this view, the defendant’s argument that the plaintiff is\nseeking tore-litigate issueswhich\nhave been determined has no basis. Second, I have to point out in any event\nthat the question of whether MOE was acting in a mediatory capacity\nwasnot an issue of dispute placed before me for\ndecisionduring the discovery application; neither was\nthere substantive arguments made or heard on that point. This court\nhad merely attempted to reason inobiter dictathat\nthere is a good chance that the documents may be without prejudice\nor privileged, as an additional reason to corroborate what would\nbe the court’sratioin dismissing\nthe request for documents, which is that the request was made too\nwide and that the basis of the request was not clear. 16     As\nmentioned above, the defendant then appealed against AR Leong’s decision\nto allow the disputed sub-paragraphs to be included in the amended\nSOC. 17     Before\nme, the defendant submitted that notwithstanding AR Leong’s latest\nobservation, Tan JC had in any event ruled on the issue whether\nthe MOE Emails were sent on a without prejudice basis. The defendant\nargued that before AR Leong in the earlier application for further\ndiscovery, they did rely on the argument about lack of relevance\nof the Category 7 Documents in addition to the without prejudice\nargument. However, the defendant stressed that before Tan JC, its\nonly argument in respect of the disclosure of the Category 7 Documents\nwas that they were sent on a without prejudice basis. Hence, when\nTan JC dismissed the plaintiff’s appeal for further discovery, he\nmust have decided that the Category 7 Documents were sent on that\nbasis. 18     Indeed,\nthe defendant pointed out that when the plaintiff applied for leave\nto appeal to the Court of Appeal against Tan JC’s decision, the\nwritten skeletal submissions of her then solicitors stated, at para\n6: It is submitted that the above is particularly\ntrue in the present instance, in which several important points\nof law arise for consideration, which will benefit from the Court\nof Appeal’s explication:- … (2)    Whether\nor not “without prejudice” privilege can attach to a party’s communications\nwith a third party where the opposing party disagrees that the third\nparty is mediating the dispute. 19     Therefore,\nthe plaintiff’s own solicitors had accepted that Tan JC had decided\nthat the Category 7 Documents were sent on a without prejudice basis.\nThe issue that her solicitors were raising to obtain leave to appeal\nto the Court of Appeal was whether such a privilege could attach\nto a party’s communication with a third party,ie,\nMOE (where the plaintiff was disputing that MOE was a mediator). 20     The\nplaintiff’s argument was that because no grounds of decision were\ndelivered by Tan JC, the reason for his decision to dismiss the plaintiff’s\nappeal and, in particular, her appeal on the Category 7 Documents\nwas not clear. He could have dismissed her appeal on another ground,\nfor example, for lack of relevance or because her application was too\nwide. As for the skeletal submissions for her application for leave\nto appeal, those submissions were made by her previous solicitors.\nWhile they did indicate that her previous solicitors themselves\ndid believe that Tan JC had ruled that the Category 7 Documents\nwere made on a without prejudice basis, it was still open to the\nplaintiff to argue that Tan JC did not in fact rule on that basis.",
        "The court’s reasons on the first\nissue": "21     Before\nI elaborate on the reasons for my decision on the first issue stated\nabove, I have a preliminary observation. 22     Tan\nJC would have been in the best position to say whether he had ruled\nthat the Category 7 Documents were sent on a without prejudice basis.\nIndeed, the defendant’s appeal was fixed for hearing before Tan\nJC and Tan JC had not refused to hear that appeal. However, in the\nlight of an objection by the plaintiff, it was fixed before me instead. 23     The\nplaintiff had two main reasons for her objection to Tan JC which she\nstated in her email dated 28 August 2014 to the Supreme Court Registry. 24     Her\nfirst reason was that because Tan JC did not give reasons for his earlier\ndecisions in respect of the Discovery Appeal and her application\nfor leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, her counsel would have\nto guess his reasons and prepare his arguments “based on quicksand”.\nThis was unfair to her and potentially unfair to the defendant.\nShe was concerned that her counsel might be surprised if Tan JC\nrevealed reasons which he himself only knew. 25     I\ndid not think that the first objection was meritorious. If Tan JC\nhad heard the defendant’s appeal and had said that he had ruled\nthat the Category 7 Documents were sent on a without prejudice basis,\nhe would then decide whether that would give rise to an issue estoppel.\nIf so, that would be the end of the matter. If he had said he had\nnot ruled on that basis or that there was no issue estoppel in any\nevent, parties would proceed to argue before him whether the MOE\nEmails were sent on a without prejudice basis. Solicitors for each\nside would prepare their submissions accordingly. 26     I\ndid not see how the parties’ solicitors would be in a better position\nto prepare arguments if the defendant’s appeal was heard by another\njudge. They would also not know what the other judge would say or\ndecide or his reasons before the hearing of the defendant’s appeal.\nSecondly, the other judge would be in a less advantageous position\nthan Tan JC to decide what he did or did not decide and his reasons.\nThirdly, more time would be spent to persuade the other judge as\nto what Tan JC did or did not decide or his reasons. 27     However,\nthe plaintiff had a second reason. She had filed an originating\nsummons (“OS”) to seek an order for JC Tan’s reasons to be given.\nShe said that her OS was, in effect, a complaint about Tan JC’s\nrefusal to give written reasons and therefore it was “plainly inappropriate”\nfor him to hear the defendant’s appeal. She stressed that she was\nnot accusing Tan JC of actually being biased but that in the light\nof her OS, there would be a reasonable suspicion of bias and an\nappearance of bias. 28     As\nmentioned above, the defendant’s appeal was then fixed for hearing\nbefore me. 29     I\nwas of the view that there was some merit in the defendant’s arguments\nthat Tan JC had ruled that the Category 7 Documents were made on\na without prejudice basis. First, that was the only reason the defendant\nhad raised before him when it objected to disclosure of that category.\nThus when he dismissed the plaintiff’s appeal, it was logical to conclude\nthat he did so on that basis for the Category 7 Documents. Secondly,\neven the plaintiff’s own solicitors thought so as evidenced by their written\nsubmissions for leave to appeal against his decision. 30     On\nthe other hand, I was mindful that even though AR Leong had earlier\nsaid in his brief grounds of decision for the discovery application that\nthe Category 7 Documents would in fact be on a without prejudice basis,\nAR Leong subsequently said, for the plaintiff’s application to amend the\nSOC, that his earlier comments were madeobiter,\nthat is, he did not in fact make a ruling on the issue. Therefore,\nit might be that Tan JC had not ruled on the without prejudice issue\ntoo. 31     Secondly,\nthe Discovery Appeal before Tan JC involved not just one category\nof documents. The Category 7 Documents were just one category in\nquestion. It was possible that Tan JC might have dismissed that\nappeal for this category on a different ground which was not in\nfact argued for this category but which applied to the other categories\nas well,eg, on the ground that\nthe category was too widely framed. 32     More\nimportantly, I noted that the Category 7 Documents pertained to\ncommunication between the defendant and MOE. 33     Therefore,\neven if Tan JC had ruled that communication between the defendant\nand MOE was made on a without prejudice basis, that ruling would\nnot, strictly speaking, apply to the MOE Emails which were from MOE\nto the plaintiff. 34     I\nshould mention that aside from the argument aboutres\njudicata, the defendant also argued that the plaintiff’s\nattempt to include the MOE Emails in her SOC was an abuse of process\neven ifres judicatadid not apply as\nthis attempt was a collateral attack on the previous decision of\nTan JC. In my view, this argument about an abuse of process was\nbased on the same premise, that is, that Tan JC had in fact already\nruled that communication between the defendant and MOE was made\non a without prejudice basis and that that ruling would extend to\nthe MOE Emails. Therefore, this argument did not add anything to\ntheres judicataargument on the\nfacts before me and I need not say anything more about it. 35     I\ntherefore considered the without prejudice issue afresh for the\nMOE Emails.",
        "The arguments of the parties\non the second issue": "36     The\nplaintiff’s arguments were as follows: (a)     MOE\nwas not a mediator. She had never asked MOE to act as a mediator\nin her complaint to MOE. (b)     The\nMOE Emails were not marked “without prejudice”. (c)     MOE\nwas a third party and the defendant could not invoke the without\nprejudice privilege for emails emanating from a third party. 37     The\ndefendant’s arguments were as follows: (a)     MOE\nwas acting as a mediator. (b)     Even\nif it was not, this did not mean that communication from it was\nnecessarily outside the scope of the without prejudice privilege. (c)     The\nabsence of an express marking of “without prejudice” on the MOE\nEmails was not determinative. (d)     The\nsubstance of the MOE Emails showed that the defendant was making\nan offer to settle the plaintiff’s complaint against the defendant.\nThus, in substance it was a genuine attempt to resolve the dispute\nand enjoyed the without prejudice privilege. (e)     The\ndefendant was entitled to enjoy that privilege as MOE was communicating\nthe defendant’s offer to the plaintiff.",
        "The court’s reasons on the second\nissue": "38     I\nnoted that much of the plaintiff’s consternation was in respect\nof the defendant’s argument that MOE was acting as a mediator. The\nplaintiff stressed that she had never asked MOE to mediate in her\ncomplaint. 39     The\nplaintiff was right but only to a certain extent. MOE was not acting\nas a mediator in that the plaintiff and the defendant did not agree\nto appoint MOE as a mediator. 40     However,\nthat did not mean that MOE could not act in a mediatory capacity.\nA third party may try to mediate in a dispute without being formally\nappointed as a mediator. 41     In\nthe circumstances, it was the substance of MOE’s Emails that was important.\nWere the emails part of a genuine attempt to resolve a dispute or not?\nIt was not disputed that if they were, then they would be considered\nas having been sent on a without prejudice basis. I need not elaborate\nas to why without prejudice communication is privileged from disclosure. 42     Before\nI elaborate on the substance, I add that I agree that the absence of\nthe words “without prejudice” is not determinative in favour of\nthe plaintiff’s position, seeSin Lian Heng\nConstruction Pte Ltd v SingaporeTelecommunications\nLtd[2007] 2 SLR(R) 433 at [10] (“Sin\nLian Heng”). Indeed, the plaintiff’s counsel did not\nseriously question this principle although he did make the argument\nthat those words were not used. 43     Conversely,\nthe use of such words does not always mean that the communication\nenjoys the privilege if in fact there was no genuine attempt to\nresolve a dispute. However, in the present context, it seems to\nme that if such words had been used expressly, it might have dissuaded\nthe plaintiff from asserting that the MOE Emails did not enjoy the\nwithout prejudice privilege. 44     I\nalso think that there is some merit in the plaintiff’s criticism (through\ncounsel) that MOE and/or the defendant should have been more careful\nto ensure that such words were expressly used in the MOE Emails\nif the privilege was being claimed. However, again, the absence\nof such words is not determinative. 45     I\ncome back to the substance of the MOE Emails. The material part\nof the MOE email dated 26 August 2011 to the plaintiff stated that: “To recap, your email of 30 June 2011 stated\ntwo issues:- (a)    Confirmation\nof acceptance (in writing) of the University’s decisions regarding\n[your] complaints; and (b)    The RO.85/2003 form duly completed\nand signed. 2.    To\naddress these, NUS hasproposedthat\nyou will not be required to accept in writing the University’s decision\non your complaints (a); or be required to sign Form RO.85/2003 (b),\nprovided that you accept that:- (a)    NUS\nwill look to you to indemnify the University against all claims\nor losses arising from any infringement in your thesis of any third\nparty intellectual property rights; and (b)    NUS owns the copyright to your thesis\n(as provided for in your Offer of Admission dated 15 Nov 2001, and\naccepted 22 Nov 2001) and has the right to reproduce or publish\nyour thesis. 3.If these conditions are acceptable to you,\nyou should write in to the Registrar’s Office (Attn: Ms Jennifer\nYee, regymsj@nus.edu.sg) requesting to re-instate your candidature.\nUpon reinstatement, you should then upload the electronic version\nof your thesis to the NUS Digital Thesis repository. This will activate\nthe process for the conferment of the MA degree. … [original emphasis omitted; emphasis added\nin bold] 46     The\nplaintiff’s email reply dated 31 August 2011 rejected these conditions\nwith her comments. 47     Consequently,\nMOE sent an email to the plaintiff dated 13 September 2011. The\nmaterial part of this email stated: … 2.    On\nyour remark that NUS has no right to impose additional requirements\ngiven that it has dropped its previous ones, we wish to clarify that\nNUS has re-considered your appeal through MOE thoroughly, and decided\nto offer a concession to help expedite the re-instatement of your candidature\nand the subsequent award of your degree. There are no new conditions\nimposed and you would only need to acknowledge the position stated\nin paragraph 2 of our earlier email dated 26 Aug 11 for afull and final settlement of thismatter. If you prefer, you may indicate\nyour wish to have your candidature re-instated through the acknowledgment\nin your email reply to us for conveyance to NUS, after which you\nwill need to upload your thesis to NUS’s repository as NUS does\nnot have any record of your softcopy thesis in their file. 3.    … 4.    We seek your understanding that while\nwe have assisted in highlighting your case to NUS, the Ministry\ndoes not interfere in the decisions made by the autonomous universities\non its graduates. We hope that you would seriously consider accepting\nthe latestoffer made by NUS. Should\nyou have further concerns, we recommend that you meet with NUS directly,\nwhose personnel will be happy to discuss and resolve the matter\nwith you, in order for you to graduate successfully. [emphasis added] 48     It\nwas clear to me that in the MOE Emails, MOE was making an offer on\nbehalf of the defendant to the plaintiff in a genuine attempt to\nresolve the dispute between the parties. Therefore, the emails enjoyed\nthe without prejudice privilege. 49     As\nfor the last argument by the plaintiff that the defendant could\nnot enjoy the privilege as the emails emanated from MOE and not\nfrom the defendant, this argument was a non-starter. 50     If\na third party had made an offer on the plaintiff’s behalf to the defendant\nto resolve the dispute, the plaintiff would be able to enjoy the same\nprivilege. It would not matter whether the offer came from her directly\nor not. The point was that MOE was communicating the defendant’s\noffer to the plaintiff for the defendant. 51     I\nadd that even an unsolicited offer, which is sometimes referred\nto as the first shot, may enjoy the same privilege, seeSin Lian Hengat [30]–[32]. 52     In\nthe circumstances, I concluded that the two MOE Emails were sent on\na without prejudice basis and were privileged from disclosure. Therefore,\nthe plaintiff was to remove the disputed sub-paragraphs from her\nproposed amendments. 53     I\nadd that it is a pity that some time and money have been spent on this\nissue. The plaintiff appeared to think that the MOE Emails could\nbe used as an admission by the defendant that it knew that the imposition\nof certain conditions was unlawful and in excess of its obligations\nand authority. It is questionable how much probative value the MOE\nEmails would have had in the overall dispute, even if they were\nadmissible in evidence. However, I say no more on this."
