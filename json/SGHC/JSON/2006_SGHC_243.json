        "My decision": "11  I considered the second defendant’s objections before I allowed the plaintiff’s application. On the complaint of tactical delay, any delay must relate back to the time of discovery of backdating. It should be noted that both parties have contributed to the delay. The second defendant should have filed its supplementary list of documents earlier whether in April or in May, and not have delayed till 10 July 2006. The plaintiff, on the other hand, should have investigated into the introduction of the circulation of the new stamps from the time it inspected the original documents on 19 July 2006 when its suspicions were aroused. If it had done that, it would have completed its investigations and prepared its application for amendments in relation to the backdating before the cross-examination of Sandiaga Uno commenced. 12  Having said that, I found that the delay on the plaintiff’s part was not substantial. I was not persuaded that the delay caused prejudice to the second defendant or gave the plaintiff any tactical advantage. As events turned out, when the evidence on the stamps was presented, the second defendant accepted that the documents were backdated. It wanted the opportunity to explain the backdating and also to explain why that had not been disclosed earlier. Leave was given for Chia Ah Hoo to file a further affidavit for that purpose, and that was done. The trial proceeded and concluded on schedule without any extension of the hearing dates. 13  As for the complaint of vagueness and lack of particulars, I looked at the proposed amendments. While it can be said that there could have been greater particulars, they are not so wanting that the second defendant can say that it cannot understand them, or was unable to respond to them effectively. In any event, the adequacy of particulars must be measured against the circumstances. The proposed amendments came about because of the documents produced and Mr Uno’s answers to counsel’s questions in cross-examination. In such circumstances, the plaintiff should be allowed to plead to such detail as it is able to, and it has done that.   [note: 1]Affidavit of Ng Soon Kai dated 18 August 2006 para 23"
