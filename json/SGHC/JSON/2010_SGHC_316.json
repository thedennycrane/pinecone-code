        "Introduction": "1       This was an application by ACC (“the\n                    Applicant”) under O 53 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,\n                    R5, 2006 Rev Ed) for an order quashing the determination issued by the\n                    Comptroller of Income Tax (“the Respondent”) dated 6 February 2009\n                    that withholding tax applied to payments made by the Applicant to its overseas\n                    subsidiaries. Leave to apply was granted on 10 July 2009 pursuant to O 53\n                    r 1 (seeACC v CIT[2010]\n                    1 SLR 273), which decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on\n                    2 February 2010 (seeComptroller of Income Tax v\n                        ACC[2010] 2 SLR 1189).",
        "Background facts": "",
        "Aircraft leasing arrangements": "2       The Applicant is a company incorporated in\n                    Singapore which engages in the business of aircraft leasing together with its\n                    subsidiaries, most of which are special purpose companies (referred to\n                    collectively as “SPCs” and individually as an “SPC”)\n                    incorporated in the Cayman Islands and are not “resident in\n                    Singapore” within the meaning of s 2(1) of the Income Tax Act\n                    (Cap 134, 2008 Rev Ed) (“ITA”). 3       As is typical of most aircraft leasing\n                    companies, each SPC owns only one aircraft and enters into separate loan\n                    agreements with offshore banks to finance the purchase of its aircraft. Such a\n                    “one company-one aircraft” business structure is a usual\n                    requirement of the bank providing financing as it serves the purpose of\n                    ring-fencing risks. The SPCs lease their aircraft to airline companies. These\n                    leases may stipulate a “floating rate” rent or a “fixed\n                    rate” rent. If the aircraft is leased on a “floating rate”\n                    rent, the rental charged by the SPC fluctuates with the floating interest rate\n                    charged by the offshore bank financing the purchase of the aircraft; the SPC\n                    therefore will not be exposed to risks in the movement in interest\n                rates. 4       In the case of “fixed rate” rent,\n                    however, the rental that an SPC charges the airline is fixed while the interest\n                    the SPC pays on the loan from the offshore bank fluctuates with the prevailing\n                    interest rate charged by the bank. This exposes the SPC to potential risks in\n                    the fluctuation in interest rates. To minimise such risk exposure, the SPCs\n                    hedge the interest rate exposure on their floating interest rate loans by\n                    entering into interest rate swap agreements.",
        "Interest rate swap agreements": "5       Before a company can enter into a swap\n                    arrangement with a bank, it is required to put in place an International Swaps\n                    and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) agreement, which has been\n                    described in the following terms in Graham Roberts,Law\n                        Relating to International Banking(Woodhead Publishing Ltd, 1998)\n                    at para 9.2.2: The ISDA agreement is a single Master Agreement, which the parties enter\n                        into ideally when they agree their first swap. This master agreement is\n                        intended to regulate the legal relationship between the parties; it is a\n                        detailed document governing most of the aspects of the relationship.\n                        Attached to the Master Agreement is a Schedule, in which the parties can\n                        add, amend or vary the details of the Master Agreement. The detailed\n                        economic features of each transaction separately are then recorded in a\n                        separate document, the confirmation. In addition, ISDA has drafted a booklet\n                        containing definitions of various economic terms, such as calculation of\n                        floating and fixed amounts, etc. These definitions can be incorporated into\n                        the confirmation, thereby keeping each confirmation relatively short. Typically, a company would put in place ISDA agreements with several\n                    banks so that it has a menu of banks to choose from. 6       If each individual SPC were to enter into an\n                    ISDA agreement with a bank, the bank would require the Applicant to provide a\n                    guarantee for each ISDA agreement since the SPC would have a relatively weaker\n                    balance sheet compared to its parent company. For commercial convenience, rather\n                    than having to manage the administrative burden of each SPC’s entering\n                    into several ISDA agreements with various banks and the Applicant’s\n                    provision of guarantees for each ISDA agreement, the SPCs and the Applicant\n                    decided that the Applicant would enter into swap arrangements with Singapore\n                    banks or Singapore branches of foreign banks (referred to collectively as\n                    “Onshore Banks” and individually as an “Onshore\n                    Bank”). 7       An interest rate swap is essentially a\n                    contractual swapping of anticipated cash flows. Each party to an interest rate\n                    swap agreement is known in the industry as a “counter-party”. InHazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough\n                        Council[1990] 2 QB 697 (“Hazell”), Woolf LJ explained the nature of interest\n                    rate swaps in the following manner (at 739–740): A swap is an agreement between two parties by which each agrees to pay the\n                        other on a specified date or dates an amount calculated by reference to the\n                        interest which would have accrued over a given period on the samenotional principal sumassuming different rates of\n                        interest are payable in each case. For example, one rate may be fixed at 10\n                        per cent. and the other rate may be equivalent to the six-month London\n                        Inter-Bank Offered Rate (‘LIBOR’) [ie, a floating interest rate]. If the LIBOR rate over the\n                        period of the swap is higher than 10 per cent. then the party agreeing to\n                        receive ‘interest’ in accordance with LIBOR will receive more\n                        than the party entitled to receive the 10 per cent.Normally neither party will in fact pay the sums which it has agreed to\n                            pay over the period of the swap but instead will make a settlement on a\n                            ‘net payment basis’ under which the party owing the greater\n                            amount on any day simply pays the difference between the two amounts due\n                            to the other. [emphasis added] 8       Neither counter-party to a swap transaction\n                    makes any loan to the other so as to give rise to an obligation on the part of\n                    the other to pay interest. The quantum of periodic payments each counter-party\n                    makes to another is computed as a product of anotionalprincipal amount, an applicable rate and a time period,\n                    expressed in a formula thus: Periodic payment = notional amount\n                        × applicable rate × time period. In\n                    practice, however, as noted by Woolf LJ inHazell(see[7]above), the amounts payable by the\n                    counter-parties are set off against each other so that on each payment date only\n                    the difference between the two amounts is paid. Depending on the relationship\n                    between the fixed and floating interest rates over the whole period of the swap\n                    agreement, the payments between counter-parties could flow either way. An\n                    interest rate swap agreement of this nature is known in the industry as a\n                    “plain vanilla” interest rate swap: see,eg, John C Hull,Fundamentals of Futures\n                        and Options Markets(Pearson Prentice Hall, 6th Ed, 2008)\n                        (“Hull”), at\n                ch 7. 9       From October 2006 onwards, the Applicant and\n                    each SPC entered into a swap arrangement mirroring the swap agreements that the\n                    Applicant has entered into with the Onshore Banks. Where the swap agreement\n                    between the Applicant and an Onshore Bank indicated the Onshore Bank as the\n                    floating rate payer and the Applicant as the fixed rate payer, the corresponding\n                    swap agreement between the Applicant and the SPC would indicate the Applicant as\n                    the floating rate payer and the SPC as the fixed rate payer. In this\n                    back-to-back arrangement, the same fixed and floating rates are employed in both\n                    sets of swap agreements. In this way, in a situation where the floating interest\n                    rate is higher than the fixed interest rate, as between the Onshore Bank and the\n                    Applicant, the net payment will be from the Onshore Bank to the Applicant and\n                    flow through from the Applicant to the SPC. If the reverse situation\n                    materialises, the net payment will be from the SPC to the Applicant and flow\n                    through from the Applicant to the Onshore Bank. From this description, it can be\n                    readily deduced that the Applicant acts as a middleman between the SPC and the\n                    Onshore Bank with net payments flowing through it in either\n                direction. 10     As the net payments or receipts were amounts\n                    due to or from the SPCs, these amounts were recorded in the Applicant’s\n                    accounting books as “Amount owing to/by subsidiary” and were also\n                    correspondingly recorded in the SPCs’ books.",
        "The Respondent’s determination": "11     In October 2008, the Applicant wrote to the\n                    Respondent to confirm that withholding tax was not applicable to the payments\n                    made by the Applicant to the SPCs for the period October 2006 to March 2008\n                    (“the SPC Payments”). In a letter dated 6 February 2009, the\n                    Respondent indicated its determination that based on s 12(6) read with\n                    s 45 of the ITA, withholding tax applied to the SPC Payments (“the\n                    Determination”). The same letter also stated that the Applicant was\n                    required to account for the amount of tax that should have been withheld and\n                    would be liable for a penalty for non-compliance with the withholding tax\n                    requirement. Dissatisfied, the Applicant instituted these proceedings to obtain\n                    a quashing order against the Determination. Meanwhile, the Applicant paid under\n                    protest the amount of withholding tax, but not the penalties, determined by the\n                    Respondent.",
        "The parties’ cases": "12     In its submissions, the Applicant sought to\n                    show that: (a)     On a general level,\n                            s 12(6)(a) of the ITA did not extend\n                        to interest rate swap payments; and (b)     Even if interest rate swap payments did fall within\n                            s 12(6)(a), on the facts of the case,\n                        where the Applicant has acted on behalf of the SPCs in the swap transactions\n                        with the Onshore Banks, the sums credited by the Applicant to the accounts\n                        of the SPCs were not interest rate swap payments and did not fall within the\n                        provisions of s 12(6)(a). 13     The Respondent’s contention was that the\n                    SPC Payments made by the Applicant to its SPCs were interest rate swap payments\n                    that were caught by the current version of s 12(6)(a) and fell within s 12(6)(a)(i) of the ITA in particular because the SPC Payments were\n                    “any other payment”, made in connection with a loan or\n                    indebtedness, which were borne by the Applicant.",
        "Statutory provisions": "14     The withholding tax requirement stems from\n                    s 45(1) of the ITA which provides: Withholding of tax in respect of interest paid to\n                            non-resident persons 45. — (1) Where a person\n                        is liable to pay to another person not known to him to be resident in\n                        Singaporeany interest which is chargeable to tax under\n                            this Act, the person paying the interest shall — (a)deduct therefrom tax — (i)... (ii)... (iii)... on every dollar of the interest; and (b)immediately give notice of the deduction of\n                                tax in writing and pay to the Comptroller the amount so\n                                deducted, and every such amount deducted shall be a debt due from him to the\n                        Government and shall be recoverable in the manner provided by section\n                        89. [emphasis added] 15     By virtue of s 10(1)(d) of the ITA, incomederived from\n                        Singaporein respect of “interest” is chargeable to\n                    income tax. Under s 12(6)(a)(i), the\n                    following aredeemed to be derived from\n                    Singapore: (a)anyinterest, commission, fee orany other payment in connection with any loan or\n                                indebtednessor with any arrangement, management,\n                            guarantee, or service relating to any loan or indebtedness which is\n                            — (i)borne, directly\n                                or indirectly,by a person resident in\n                                    Singaporeor a permanent establishment in Singapore\n                                except in respect of any business carried on outside Singapore\n                                through a permanent establishment outside Singapore or any immovable\n                                property situated outside Singapore; ... [emphasis added] 16     From a literal reading of these relevant\n                    provisions in the ITA, if the SPC Payments are characterised as\n                    “interest, commission or fee or any other payment in connection with any\n                    loan or indebtedness” which is borne directly or indirectly by the\n                    Applicant (a person resident in Singapore), they would be deemed to be derived\n                    from Singapore. The Applicant, as the person “paying the interest”\n                    to a non-resident person (ie, the SPCs), would\n                    thus be obliged under s 45(1) to withhold tax on every dollar of the\n                    interest paid. The crux of this application therefore lies in whether the SPC\n                    Payments fall within the meaning of s 12(6)(a)(i).",

        "Purposive interpretation": "17     In construing a statute, s 9A(1) of the\n                    Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“Interpretation\n                    Act”) requires the court to adopt an interpretation that would promote\n                    the legislative purpose or object underlying the statute. In order to ascertain\n                    the purpose or object underlying s 12(6)(a)\n                    of the ITA, one should start by examining its legislative origins. Legislative history 18     Section 12(6) was introduced via an\n                    amendment under the Income Tax (Amendment) Act 1973 (Act 26 of 1973). The\n                    first version of s 12(6) read as follows: (6)    Any income derived\n                            fromloanswhere – (a)theinterestis borne directly or indirectly by\n                                a person resident in Singapore or a permanent establishment in\n                                Singapore; or (b)the funds\n                                provided by such loans are brought into or used in\n                            Singapore, shall bedeemed to be derived from\n                        Singapore.

Thus, the words “any interest, commission, fee\n                    or any other payment in connection with any loan or indebtedness” in\n                        s 12(6)(a) should be interpreted in the\n                    light of the Minister’s explanation that the aim of the expanded\n                    definition of source of income under s 12(6) was to include\n                    “interest accruing from suppliers’ credit or deferred payments for\n                    the sale of goods”. Deeming provision 22     The Applicant submitted that as s 12(6)\n                    is adeemingprovision, it necessarily employs a\n                    statutory fiction and should therefore be construed strictly. InFederal Commissioner of Taxation v Comber(1986)\n                    64 ALR 451, it was held that (perFisher J at 458): ... deeming provisions are required by their nature to be construed\n                        strictly and only for the purpose for which they are resorted to (Ex parte Walton(1881) 17 Ch D 746\n                        per James LJ at 756). It is improper ... to extend by implication the\n                        express application of such a statutory fiction. It is even more improper so\n                        to do if such an extension is unnecessary, the express provision being\n                        capable by itself of sensible and rational application. ... The Applicant also referred to another maxim of revenue law which\n                    states that the taxpayer is not to be taxed unless the taxing statute\n                    unambiguously imposes the tax on him: seeRussell (Inspector\n                        of Taxes) v Scott[1948] 1 AC 422,perLord Simonds at 433. In similar fashion, Lord Buckmaster\n                    observed inGreenwood v FL Smidth & Company[1922] 1 AC 417 at 423: It is, I think, important to remember the rule, which the Courts ought to\n                        obey, that, where it is desired to impose a new burden by way of taxation,\n                        it is essential that this intention should be stated in plain terms. The\n                        Courts cannot assent to the view that if a section in a taxing statute is of\n                        doubtful and ambiguous meaning, it is possible out of that ambiguity to\n                        extract a new and added obligation not formerly cast upon the\n                        taxpayer. 23     The Respondent contended that the\n                    Minister’s speech at the second reading of the 1977 Bill highlighted the\n                    limits of the scope of the original version of s 12(6) which could not be\n                    applied to a diverse array of payments from business activities involving\n                    Singapore. Thus, it submitted, the intention of Parliament was to widen the\n                    scope of the deemed source rule in s 12 of the ITA and that the\n                    “interest accruing from suppliers’ credit or deferred payments for\n                    the sale of goods” were just two examples of scenarios where the limited\n                    original version of s 12(6) would not apply. 24     While I agree with the Respondent that the\n                    1977 amendments to s 12(6) were intended to widen the scope of the deemed\n                    source rule in s 12, I am of the view that that widening should be\n                    construed according to a purposive reading of the literal wording of\n                    s 12(6). I note that inABB v Comptroller of Income\n                        Tax[2010] 2 SLR 837, Chao Hick Tin JA held\n                    (at [54]) that s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act applies to all\n                    written law and “effectively displaces the common law principle that tax\n                    statutes should be interpreted strictly in favour of the taxpayer”. I do\n                    not understand Chao JA as holding that purposive interpretation mandates that\n                    tax statutes must be readwidely in every case.\n                    Rather, he was laying down the principle that in construing tax legislation, the\n                    court should accord paramount consideration to the purpose or object underlying\n                    the statute instead of relying solely on common law principles of interpretation\n                    such as the strict construction rule. As an application of the dictates of\n                    s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act to tax legislative provisions, this must\n                    be right. In that case, Chao JA cited the following passage inPublic Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng[2007]\n                    4 SLR(R) 183 (“Low Kok\n                    Heng”) at [41]: Section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act requires the construction of\n                        written law to promote the purpose or object underlying the statute. In\n                        fact, itmandatesthat a construction promoting legislative purpose be\n                        preferred over one that does not promote such purpose or object: see Brady\n                        Coleman, ‘The Effect of Section 9A of the Interpretation Act on\n                        Statutory Interpretation in Singapore’ [2000] Sing JLS 152 at 154.\n                        Accordingly, any common law principle of interpretation, such as the plain\n                        meaning rule and the strict construction rule, must yield to the purposive\n                        interpretation approach stipulated by s 9A(1) of the Interpretation\n                        Act.Allwritten law (penal or otherwise) must be interpreted purposively.\n                        Other common law principles come into playonlywhen their application\n                        coincides with the purpose underlying the written law in question, or\n                        alternatively, when ambiguity in that written law persists even after an\n                        attempt at purposive interpretation has been properly made. [emphasis in\n                        original] Thus, while the court should not have referenceexclusivelyto the common law principle of strict construction\n                    in favour of the taxpayer, that common law principle may be applied when such\n                    application coincides with the purpose underlying the statutory provision in\n                    question or when ambiguity persists even after purposive interpretation has been\n                    properly attempted.",
        "“Interest, commission, fee or any other payment”": "25     It was common ground between the parties that\n                    the SPC Payments are not “commission”, “fee” or even\n                    “interest”. With regard to the meaning of\n                    “interest”, inChng Gim Huat v Public\n                        Prosecutor[2000] 2 SLR(R) 360, Yong Pung How CJ\n                    observed (at [36]): The following guiding principles can be distilled from the above\n                        authorities. Firstly, the label attached to the payment is not conclusive of\n                        its true legal nature. Whether or not a particular payment constitutes\n                        ‘interest’ depends on the substance of the transaction.\n                        Nomenclature does not alter the character of the payment if it is not in\n                        fact ‘interest’ and vice versa. Secondly, the essence of\n                        ‘interest’ is compensation for the deprivation for the use or\n                        delayed payment of money by another. Thirdly, there must be a principal sum\n                        of money by reference to which the interest payment is to be ascertained,\n                        which sum of money must be due to the person entitled to the\n                        interest. I agree that the SPC Payments should not be construed as\n                    “commission” or “fee” (as these terms are used in\n                    common parlance) as they were not paid in consideration of any service rendered\n                    by the SPCs to the Applicant. Properly construed, the SPC Payments were also not\n                    “interest” under s 12(6)(a)\n                    because (a) they were not intended to compensate the SPCs for the deprivation\n                    for the use or delayed payment of money by the Applicant; and (b) there was no\n                    principal sum of money which was owing to the SPCs, by reference to which the\n                    SPC Payments were to be ascertained. Quite rightly, the Respondent dropped its\n                    earlier insistence that the SPC Payments were\n                “interest”. 26     Therefore, the Respondent contended, but the\n                    Applicant denied, that the SPC Payments were “any other payment”\n                    that fell within the meaning of s 12(6)(a).\n                    In its submissions, the Applicant relied on theejusdem\n                        generisprinciple in order to ascertain the meaning of\n                    “any other payment” in the context of s 12(6)(a). InBennion on Statutory\n                        Interpretation: A Code(LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2008)\n                        (“Bennion”), at p 1231, theejusdem generisprinciple is described as\n                    such: The Latin wordsejusdem generis(of the same\n                        kind or nature), have been attached to a principle of construction whereby\n                        wide words associated in the text with more limited words are taken to be\n                        restricted by implication to matters of the same limited character. The\n                        principle may apply whatever the form of the association, but the most usual\n                        form is a list or string of genus-describing terms followed by wider\n                        residuary or sweeping-up words. ... Theejusdem generisprinciple stems from the\n                        linguistic implication by which words having literally a wide meaning (when\n                        taken in isolation) are treated as reduced in scope by the verbal context.\n                        It may be regarded as an instance of ellipsis, or reliance on implication.\n                        The principle is presumed to apply unless there is some contrary\n                        indication. As was explained in[25]above,\n                    each of the preceding terms “interest”, “commission”\n                    and “fee” are commonly understood to be payments made by the payor\n                    to the payeein considerationof the forbearance\n                    in collecting the principal sum loaned, or services or work performed, by the\n                    payee. Applying theejusdem generisprinciple, the\n                    words “any other payment” should be construed as some form of\n                    consideration accruing to the payee in return for some benefit conferred by the\n                    payee to the payor, following the genus of the preceding terms. In order to\n                    determine what kind of benefit is relevant here, one must ascertain the meaning\n                    of the other requirements in s 12(6)(a).",
        "“In connection with any loan or indebtedness”": "27     The expression “in connection\n                    with” could describe a range of links, but the court must look closely at\n                    the surrounding words and the context of the legislative scheme: seeRevenue and Customs Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc[2008] STC 476,perArden LJ at\n                    [18]. In the context of a statutory provision which deems to be derived from\n                    Singapore payment borne by a person resident in Singapore in order that tax is\n                    chargeable on such sums paid, it is even more important to construe the\n                    provision carefully, having regard to the legislative purpose behind that\n                    provision. 28     As an illustration, in the context of\n                    impugning financial assistance in connection with the purchase of a\n                    company’s shares under s 76(1)(a) of\n                    the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), Andrew Phang J inWu Yang Construction Group Ltd v Zhejiang Jinyi Group Co,\n                        Ltd[2006] 4 SLR(R) 451 rejected a broad construction\n                    of the words “in connection with”, observing that (at [69] and\n                    [71]): 69    ... a broad reading of the phrase ‘in\n                            connection with’ in s 76(1)(a)\n                            of the Act (which I have rejected), whilst linguistically possible, is\n                            (at best) an academic exercise. The provisions of the Act in general and\n                                s 76(1)(a) thereof in particular\n                            exist in order to promote (rather than stifle) commerce in a real world\n                            setting. Whilst nice linguistic arguments have their proper place in a\n                            stimulating intellectual discussion, they have, with respect, no place\n                            whatsoever in a practical context, where they are both irrelevant and\n                            apt to confuse rather than enlighten. ... ... 71    ... I have, in fact already referred to the\n                            fundamental importance of the concept of purpose in\n                                s 76(1)(a) of the Act. And the\n                            importance of this concept hinges on themischiefthat is sought to be avoided, as set out above.\n                            That mischief doesnotinclude\n                            transactions, the sole or primary purpose of which is to give effect to\n                            thebona fidecommercial interests of the\n                            companyother thanin the giving of\n                            financial assistance in order to assist in the purchase of the\n                            company’s shares. If so, then the phrase ‘in connection\n                            with’ must be given a meaning that is consistent with the context\n                            and intention underlying s 76 of the Act itself. In the\n                            circumstances, I would reject a broad reading of ‘in connection\n                            with’ and hold that that phrase must be read consistently with the\n                            phrase ‘for the purpose of’. ... [emphasis in original] 29     The original version of s 12(6) referred\n                    only to income derived fromloanswhere theinterestis borne by a person resident in\n                    Singapore. The scope of payment caught under s 12(6)(a) has since been expanded not only in terms of thetypeof payment borne (ie,\n                    not only “interest” but also “commission”,\n                    “fee”, or “any other payment”) but also the reason\n                    for that payment. The payment borne by the person resident in Singapore can be\n                    in connection with not only a “loan”, but also with other forms of\n                    “indebtedness”. Apart from a loan made to the person resident in\n                    Singapore, such indebtedness could arise, for instance, through an extension of\n                    credit or other forms of deferred payment such as overdue trade accounts, by a\n                    non-resident supplier of goods or services to the taxpayer resident in\n                    Singapore. If payment is borne by that personin\n                        considerationfor the benefit of such form of deferred payment,\n                    such payment is “in connection with” that indebtedness. The\n                    obligation to make paymentarises out ofthe\n                    indebtedness. That is the connection between the payment and the\n                    indebtedness. 30     It follows that the loan or indebtedness\n                    referred to in s 12(6)(a) should not include\n                    any loan or indebtedness owed by the non-resident payee to a third party. Such\n                    unrelated loan or indebtedness does not give rise to the payment and the payor\n                    should not have to withhold tax thereon on account of a dubious\n                    “connection” between the payment and the loan or indebtedness.\n                    Indeed, the resident payor might not even be aware of such loan or\n                    indebtedness.",
        "Whether interest rate swap payments fall within\n                s 12(6)(a)": "31     As I have noted at[8]above, in an interest rate swap agreement between two\n                    counter-parties, there is no subsisting loan (or indebtedness) between them.\n                    Instead, an interest rate swap agreement is an agreement between two\n                    counter-parties to “exchange cash flows in the future”; the\n                    agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way in\n                    which they are to be calculated (seeHull([8]above, at p 153). Typically,\n                    the quantum of the cash flows is calculated based on anotional principal amount, but it bears emphasising that no such\n                    principal amount has been passed under a loan (or other indebtedness) from one\n                    counter-party to the other. 32     Certainly, at the date stipulated for payment\n                    or settlement, one counter-party has to pay the other counter-party, depending\n                    on which direction the net cash flow is in. On that payment date, one\n                    counter-party “owes” the other a net payment of cash flow under\n                    the interest rate swap agreement. This is of course true of any payment of any\n                    kind from one party to the other, but that does not mean that there is of\n                    necessity anysubsistingloan or indebtedness\n                    between the paying party or the receiving party. Indeed, depending on how the\n                    floating interest rate fluctuates, the net payment could be in either direction,ie, from the fixed rate payer to the floating\n                    rate payer orvice versa. At the point of entry\n                    into the interest rate swap agreement, it cannot be ascertained which of the\n                    counter-parties is “indebted” because it is not until the payment\n                    or settlement date that the counter-parties can determine which direction the\n                    net payment should be in. 33     In my view, therefore, there being no loan or\n                    indebtedness involved in an interest rate swap agreement, payment made pursuant\n                    to such an agreement wouldnotbe “in\n                    connection with any loan or indebtedness”. Interest rate swap payments\n                    should, ordinarily, fall outside the meaning of s 12(6)(a) of the ITA. 34     I should mention that one of the arguments\n                    that the Applicant made to explain why interest rate swap payments are not\n                    covered by s 12(6)(a) was that when the\n                    amendments were introduced in 1977 to include payments for trade indebtedness,\n                    interest rate swaps were not known even in developed financial centres since\n                    they were first entered into in 1981. The Applicant argued, further, that had\n                        s 12(6)(a) been intended to cover\n                    interest rate swaps, Parliament would have inserted the words “interest\n                    rate swaps” in s 12(6)(a) as it did in\n                    the cases of ss 10(2A), 14J(6) and 43N(1)(c)\n                    of the ITA. It is, however, a settled principle that a statutory provision\n                    should be construed in a manner which will take into account new situations\n                    which may arise and which were not within contemplation at the time of its\n                    enactment: seeAAG v Estate of AAH, deceased[2010] 1 SLR 769 at [30]. Thus, in so far as these arguments attempt\n                    to side-step rather than engage in elucidating the words of\n                        s 12(6)(a), they do not assist the\n                    construction of that statutory provision. An attempt at applying\n                    s 12(6) should be made not only in relation to facts in existence at the\n                    time it came into force but also to circumstances which may surface in the\n                    future.",
        "Treatment of the SPC Payments under s 12(6)(a)": "35     The Respondent contended that the SPC Payments\n                    were payments borne by the Applicant in connection with the loansbetween the SPCs and offshore banks. It justified its\n                    contention on the basis that Parliament had intended s 12(6) to be given a\n                    wide interpretation so as to frustrate tax avoidance schemes which evolved with\n                    the myriad ways that business can be conducted. 36     To my mind, interpreting the words “any\n                    loan or indebtedness” in such a way as to include loan or indebtednessnotinvolving the resident taxpayer would be\n                    stretching the meaning of the statutory provision far beyond the purpose\n                    underlying it. InLow Kok Heng([24]supra], V K Rajah JA cautioned that (at [52]): [m]ore importantly, it is crucial that statutory provisions are not\n                        construed, in the name of a purposive approach, in a manner that goes\n                        against all possible and reasonable interpretation of the express literal\n                        wording of the provision. As I have explained at[29]–[30]above, it\n                    would not be reasonable to require the resident taxpayer to withhold tax on\n                    payments purportedly “in connection with” a loan or indebtedness\n                    that did not give rise to the payment. The loan agreements between the\n                    non-resident SPCs and the offshore banks simply do not concern the resident\n                    taxpayer. 37     Indeed, the SPC Payments were clearly not made\n                    in consideration for the loan between the offshore banks and the SPCs. They were\n                    payments made pursuant to the interest rate swap agreement between each SPC and\n                    the Applicant, which agreement the offshore banks were not privy to. Under that\n                    agreement, there was no subsisting loan or indebtedness owing from the Applicant\n                    to the SPC. Therefore, the SPC Payments were not made in consideration for\n                    “any loan or indebtedness” and are not caught under\n                        s 12(6)(a). They should not be deemed to\n                    be derived from Singapore under that provision. 38     According to the Applicant, the interest rate\n                    swap agreements between the Applicant and the Onshore Banks were entered intoon behalf ofthe SPCs. Consequently, the sums\n                    received from and paid to the Onshore Banks under the swap agreement with the\n                    Applicant were sums received or paid by the Applicant “on behalf\n                    of” the SPCs. Therefore, the moneys received or paid by the Applicant\n                    were due to or payable from the SPCs and consequently werenotinterest rate swap payments. In this sense, the Applicant\n                    was in fact acting asagentfor the SPCs in\n                    entering into the interest rate swap agreements with the Onshore\n                Banks. 39     In my view, such a disingenuous argument does\n                    not pass muster. On its own case, the Applicant itself entered into swap\n                    agreements with the Onshore Banks and the SPCs entered into swap agreements with\n                    the Applicantmirroringthose swap agreements with\n                    the Onshore Banks. If the Applicant was indeed the SPCs’ agent, there\n                    would have been no need to enter into its own interest rate swaps with the SPCs.\n                    As agent, it would have been its duty to simply pass on the money it received\n                    from the Onshore Banks to its principals the SPCs, or to pass the money in the\n                    other direction, depending on the net cash flow. Further, as the SPC Payments\n                    were payments made pursuant to the terms of the interest rate swap agreements\n                    between the Applicant and the SPCs, they clearly were interest rate swap\n                    payments. The Applicant’s attempt to characterise the SPC Payments as\n                    merely sums that “rightly belonged to those SPCs” was wholly\n                    unnecessary. They “rightly belonged to those SPCs” in consequence\n                    of the interest rate swap agreements between the Applicant and the SPCs, not\n                    through any principal-agent relationship between the two.",
        "Wide interpretation widely accepted?": "40     The Respondent made the further argument that\n                    the wide interpretation of s 12(6) that it forwarded in these proceedings\n                    has been accepted by tax advisors, practitioners and businesses. This was\n                    disputed by the Applicant, which suggested that: 42.    The reality, insofar as we can tell, is that where\n                            counterparties feel that their transactions may be within the\n                            Respondent’s wide interpretation, they may simply avoid Singapore\n                            as the place of doing interest rate swap businesses as it does not make\n                            economic sense to do so. ... Owing to the connectivity amongst the major financial centres in\n                    the world, it is easy to arrange any derivative transaction, including interest\n                    rate swap transactions, with financial institutions all over the world,\n                    bypassing Singapore in the process. This would inevitably occur when the\n                    transactions do not fall within the scope of remission or exemption by the\n                    Respondent as the relevant parties desirous of utilising interest rate swap\n                    transactions to their benefit would enter into such transactions with banks or\n                    other counterparties in other financial centres. 41     Quite apart from the commercial realities,\n                    this further argument does not assist very much in the construction of\n                        s 12(6)(a). InComptroller of Income Tax v GE Pacific Pte Ltd[1994]\n                    2 SLR(R) 948, Yong Pung How CJ opined (at [35]) that the practice of\n                    the Comptroller with regard to s 24 of the ITA “does not in any way\n                    illuminate the question of whether thisshouldbe\n                    the practice of the Comptroller” since practice isnotlaw. Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury made similar observations\n                    inMaco Door and Window Hardware (UK) Ltd v Revenue and\n                        Customs Commissioners[2008] 1 WLR 1790 at [66]: ... the fact that, for a substantial period, the commissioners interpreted\n                        a particular provision in a taxing statute in a certain way is normally of\n                        limited assistance as to the provision’s meaning. The interpretation\n                        of legislation is, of course, ultimately a matter for the judiciary, not the\n                        executive. ... To echo Lord Neuberger’s words of caution, one should be\n                    watchful of invocations of current practice of the executive to justify an\n                    interpretation of legislative obligations, in particular, under tax provisions.\n                    It is the duty of the judiciary to ensure that taxpayers are taxed only under a\n                    proper construction of the legislative provisions, not under the continuing\n                    misapprehension of the same on the part of the executive. 42     As part of its justification for its wide\n                    interpretation of s 12(6)(a),\n                    the Respondent pointed to the Income Tax (Exemption of Interest and Other\n                    Payments for Economic and Technological Development) Notification 2000 (S\n                    411/2000) (“the Notification”), which exempts from tax any\n                    interest rate swap payment by a financial institution to a non-resident payee,\n                    as an indication of response by the Ministry of Finance to feedback from\n                    relevant industry players to continue to make Singapore an attractive and viable\n                    business and financial hub. I do not think that the content of such subsidiary\n                    legislation, made by the Minister pursuant to powers conferred under\n                    s 13(4) of the ITA, can be taken to be a guide as to what Parliament\n                    intended by the language used in the Act, particularly if the Notification\n                    postdated the 1977 amendments by some 13 years.",
        "Conclusion": "43     Having regard to all the relevant\n                    considerations, I find that the SPC Payments were not payments in connection\n                    with any loan or indebtedness borne by the resident Applicant to the\n                    non-resident SPCs. In consequence, the requirement to withhold tax under\n                    s 45 does not apply to the SPC Payments. The application for an order to\n                    quash the Determination is granted in terms. Costs for this application as well\n                    as the costs in relation to the leave application are awarded in favour of the\n                    Applicant."
