        "The background": "4\n\n        The plaintiff has worked initially for the\n\ndefendants and later (to use a neutral expression) in other establishments with which the\n\ndefendants have had some business dealings for some 29 years from 10 August 1969 to 13\n\nAugust, 1998. On or about 4 December 1998 the defendants were placed under creditors’\n\nvoluntary liquidation and the defendants were appointed as liquidators of the company.5\n\n        The plaintiff began her career with the\n\ndefendant company as a waitress but was soon promoted to work in the company’s\n\nfinance department. In January 1989, the plaintiff accepted an offer by the company to\n\nwork as a Accounts Assistant. The plaintiff accepted and following her acceptance she\n\nproceeded to work at the Guangzhou Hotel Equatorial, which the defendant company operated.\n\nI shall elaborate on the terms of the management contract. Whether she remained as an\n\nemployee of the defendant company or whether she had become an employee of Guangzhou Hotel\n\nEquatorial is a central question to which I shall have to return.6\n\n        It is common ground that the land and premises\n\nin which Guangzhou Hotel Equatorial operated were owned by a Chinese entity known as the\n\nGuangzhou International Investment Mansion (\"the Owners\"). The defendant\n\ncompany, having established some reputation in the hotel industry, was appointed as\n\nmanagers under and pursuant to a management contract dated 15 May 1988 (\"the\n\nManagement Contract\"). In my view, the key to determine the identity of the employers\n\nof the plaintiff lies in a precise understanding of the nature, scope and the respective\n\nduties and obligations of the Owners and the defendant company. Another significant key is\n\nto identify and understand the legal status of Guangzhou Hotel Equatorial under the laws\n\nof the PRC.7\n\n        However, disputes arose between the defendant\n\ncompany and the Owners sometime in 1992/3. In 1994 the Owners commenced arbitration\n\nproceedings. In early 1998 an adverse final award was given against the defendant company.\n\nIt is not relevant for present purposes to know in any detail the nature of the disputes.\n\nSuffice it to say that on or about 5 March 1998, the Owners entered upon the premises of\n\nthe hotel and took possession of it. In the wake of this self-help operation, the hotel\n\nbusiness ceased and most of the employees working in the hotel were forced to leave.8\n\n        At the request of the defendant company, and it\n\nwas not seriously disputed, the plaintiff remained on the premises to settle the\n\noutstanding financial maters between the defendant company and the Owners. She looked\n\nafter and acted in the best interest of the defendant company at, I would add on the\n\nevidence, some peril to her own personal safety. She feared for her safety but she stayed\n\nbehind on the promise of the managing director of the defendant company that\n\nrepresentatives from the defendant company from Singapore would be sent to assist her.\n\nHelp never came. After two weeks of living in fear and trepidation, the plaintiff escaped\n\nfrom the Owners on 24 March 1998, carrying with her only her handbag, passport and clothes\n\non her back. She made her way from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, and thence to Kuala Lumpur and\n\nSingapore.9\n\n        After her return to Singapore, the plaintiff\n\nattended the defendant company’s managing director on at least 10 occasions. She gave\n\ninformation regarding the takeover, including the handing over of the accounts. She\n\nrepeatedly asked for her salaries. Finally she was paid her October and November 1998\n\nsalaries of US$3,300 per month. According to her, the managing director promised that she\n\nwould be paid her outstanding salary shortly.10\n\n        Instead of paying her the arrears of salary,\n\nthe defendant comp[any on 13 August 1998 wrongfully terminated the plaintiff’s\n\nemployment with effect, retrospectively, from 31 March 1998. In September, 1998 the\n\nplaintiff engaged solicitors to recover her outstanding salary and other benefits due to\n\nher from the defendant company. Owing to the liquidation of the defendant company, legal\n\nproceedings were discontinued and a Proof of Debt was lodged.11\n\n        The claims amounted to US$142,218.00 and the\n\nparticulars of the claims are as follows:PARTICULARSOverdue\n\n        salary from December 1997To July 1998 at\n\n        US$3,300 per monthUS$26,400.00Overdue salary from 1 August 1998To 13 August 1998 (pro-rated)US$\n\n        1,383.00Unused annual leave for\n\n        1997 (21 days)US$ 2,235.0013thmonths\n\n        salary for 1997US$ 3,300.003 months’ salary in\n\n        lieu for 1997US$ 9,900.00Retrenchment benefits for 30 years of serviceAt US$3,300.00 per yearUS$99,000,00TotalUS$142,218.0012\n\n        About 1 year after lodging her Proof of Debt,\n\nthe Liquidators of the defendant company issued their Notice of Rejection of Proof of\n\nDebt. They alleged that the documents they had did not support the claims.13\n\n        The plaintiff, not unexpectedly, encountered\n\nserious financial difficulties, not having received any income for some time and not been\n\nable to find employment until August 1999. She had to resort to loans from friends and\n\nrelatives. When she was financially able and after obtaining more documentation in this\n\ncase, she instructed solicitors to pursue her claims. Financially, she commenced these\n\nproceedings on 26 September 2000.",
        "Extension of time": "14\n\n        The power of the Court to extend time is set\n\nout in Rule 190 of the Companies (Winding Up) Rules which provides:\"The Court may, in any case\n\n    which it fit, extend or abridge the time appointed by these Rules or fixed by any order of\n\n    the Court for doing any act or taking any proceeding.\"15\n\n        On the evidence, I am satisfied that she did\n\nnot commence these proceedings because she was financially unable to do so. She did not\n\nhave money to pay her solicitors. I accept the evidence of Mah Seng Peng and Tan Lye Choo\n\nregarding her financial embarrassment. Her adverse financial position was due to the fact\n\nshe had not been paid her remuneration and other benefits. The period of her financial\n\nembarrassment was lengthened when the Liquidators’ adjudication of the Proof of Claim\n\ntook almost 16 months. The defendants have not shown that they would be unjustly\n\nprejudiced by the extension of time. The liquidators were all too aware of the objections\n\nand they had not carried out any distributions of dividends to such an extent that they\n\nwould not be able to meet the payment of these claims, if found liable, since these claims\n\nenjoy a very high priority in the liquidation of the assets of the defendant company.\n\nHaving balanced the competing reasons, I am of the opinion that this is fit and proper\n\ncase for the granting of the extension of time.",
        "Was plaintiff employed by\n\ndefendant company or Guangzhou Hotel Equatorial?": "16\n\n        The Liquidators of the defendant company,\n\nrelying on the evidence of its former Managing Director, concluded that the plaintiff was\n\nemployed by Guangzhou Hotel Equatorial and not by the defendant company. She claimed that\n\nshe was at all material times employed by the defendant company. I now turn to the\n\nquestion, namely who was her employers.17\n\n        On or about 16 January 1989, the defendant\n\ncompany issued a letter of offer of employment to the plaintiff to work at the Guangzhou\n\nEquatorial Hotel as an Accounts Assistant. The plaintiff duly accepted the offer. The\n\nManaging Director of the defendant company gave evidence that the offer was made on behalf\n\nof Guangzhou Equatorial Hotel. I am unable to accept this evidence.18\n\n        Under the Management Contract dated 15 May 1988\n\nentered into between the defendant company and the Owners, read as whole, it is clear\n\nbeyond any peradventure that the defendant company \"shall have the undisputed right\n\nof management according to law\": see Chapter Three, Article IV, Chapter Four, Article\n\nXXIII and Chapter Five, Article XV. By Chapter Five, Article XVIII (see 1AB19) it was\n\nclearly agreed between them that \"Party B [i.e. the defendant company] shall be\n\nresponsible for and settle on its own all the debts and claims within the period of\n\ncontractual management.\" This was the re-interpreted version.The central\n\nfeature of the Management Contract was this: the defendant company undertook to pay the\n\nOwners a fixed sum, regardless of the profitability or otherwise of managing the hotel in\n\nGuangzhou. Its duration was at least 16 years subject to earlier termination if there was\n\na breach.19\n\n        In truth and in fact, the defendant company\n\nmanaged the hotel on its own. It was responsible for the revenue from the running of the\n\nhotel. All payments for rooms, food and beverages and other services were paid to the\n\nmanagement of the hotel and out of the revenue earned the salaries and all other outgoings\n\nand expenses were paid. In fact, the financial results of the management of the hotel in\n\nGuangzhou year on year was brought into the accounts of the defendant company. Mr Chong\n\nLeong Tian @ Mr Franklin Chong, PW5, the Regional Financial Controller of the defendant\n\ncompany at the material time, in his affidavit evidence of 20 November 2001 said that\n\nGuangzhou Hotel Equatorial was not treated as a subsidiary of the defendant and,\n\naccordingly, the hotel’s accounts were not reflected in the consolidated audited\n\naccounts. However, Guangzhou Equatorial Hotel’s operations were treated as part and\n\nparcel of the defendant company’s operations. The profits earned from and the losses\n\nincurred by the defendant company’s management of the hotel were reflected as a\n\nsingle figure in the audited accounts of the defendant company. The defendant company did\n\nnot challenge this evidence.20\n\n        The auditor of the defendant company, Mr Yeo\n\nOon Jin, PW2confirmed that this accounting treatment with reference to the 1997\n\naudited accounts of the defendant company. He said that the revenue reflected in the 1997\n\naudited accounts of the defendant company included the revenue of Guangzhou Equatorial\n\nHotel. Similarly, the expenses of Guangzhou Equatorial Hotel were included in the\n\ndefendant company’s expenses. In short, the operating results of Guangzhou Equatorial\n\nHotel were aggregated with those of the defendant company. Mr Yeo Oon Jin further\n\nconfirmed that whilst salaries were not specifically itemized in the accounts, salaries\n\nwere included in the computation of the expenses of both Guangzhou Equatorial Hotel and\n\nthe defendant company.21\n\n        Mr Yeo Oon Jin further confirmed that the\n\nreason why the operations of Guangzhou Equatorial Hotel were consolidated with those of\n\nthe defendant company was due to the Management Contract which provided that the defendant\n\ncompany would be responsible for the operating results of Guangzhou Equatorial Hotel. This\n\naccounting treatment is, in my view, consistent with the basic structure of the Management\n\nAgreement. The basic structure was this: the defendant company would manage the hotel\n\nexclusively and, win or loose, it has to pay the Owners a fixed sum yearly. Under the\n\nManagement Contract, that payment was due and payable regardless of the profitability or\n\notherwise of the hotel in Guangzhou.22\n\n        The status of the plaintiff was further\n\nconfirmed by the evidence of Mr Chong Leong Tian @ Mr Franklin Chong. As I had described\n\nearlier, he was at the material time the Regional Financial Controller of the defendant\n\ncompany. He was personally involved in both financial and human resource matters for the\n\ndefendant company. In describing the nature of the plaintiff’s employment, he said\n\nthat she was an employee of the defendant company on assignment at the hotel in Guangzhou.23\n\n        He said: \"In addition to employing staff\n\nfrom Guangzhou, it was the intention of [the defendant company] to send some of their\n\nstaff from Singapore to Guangzhou to work as expatriates at the hotel. The plaintiff was\n\none of the employees of [the defendant company] who was offered an overseas assignment to\n\nwork at the hotel. None of the expatriates working at the hotel was directly employed by\n\nthe hotel as the recruitment of expatriates was solely the responsibility of and at the\n\ndiscretion of [the defendant company]….As the Regional Financial Controller…, I\n\nwas authorized to oversee all financial and administrative matters…including the\n\nmovement of human resources of the Hotel. The Hotel was required to seek final approval in\n\nrespect of these matters and would approach me, the General manager of [the defendant\n\ncompany] or the final decision maker, the Managing Director of [the defendant company] for\n\nthe approval. The Hotel would normally execute all operational matters according to the\n\ndirectives by [the defendant company].\" The evidence of Mr Chong Leong Tian was not\n\nchallenged by the defendant company.24\n\n        The plaintiff was recruited by the defendant\n\ncompany. She was paid, in effect, by the defendant company for her work in Guangzhou\n\nEquatorial Hotel. She was directed and controlled in respect of her work by higher\n\nofficers of the defendant company. She often took direct instructions from the Managing\n\nDirector of the defendant company. The fact of control and direction was highlighted by\n\nthe Court of Appeal inAwang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co\n\nLtd and other appeals[1997] 3 SLR 677. In my judgment, she was the employee of the\n\ndefendant company.",
        "Six Claims": "25\n\n        I turn now to the particulars of claims of the\n\nplaintiff, which are described under six items. Of the six heads of claims, I will allow\n\nthe two claims for overdue salaries, the 3 months’ salary in lieu of termination\n\nnotice and the largest single claim of US$99,000.00 as retrenchment benefits for 30 years\n\nof service at US$3,300.00 per year. As for the claims for unused annual leave for 1997 and\n\nthe 13thmonth salary for 1997 it is quite clear that the plaintiff is not\n\ncontractually entitled to them.26\n\n        In relation to the two claims for overdue\n\nsalaries, there is no doubt that the last drawn salary received by the plaintiff was\n\nUS$3,300.00 per month. The General Manager of the defendant company confirmed this in his\n\nletter of 1 October 1996. It was also evidenced in the payment voucher recording the\n\npayment of her salary for the months of October and November 1997. The plaintiff had not\n\nreceived any other salary payment. Accordingly, her salary remained outstanding from\n\nDecember 1997. On 13 August 1998 the defendant company stating that her employment with\n\nthe Guangzhou Equatorial Hotel had terminated on 31 March 1998 following the closure of\n\nthe operations of Guangzhou Equatorial Hotel. In my view, the defendant company’s\n\nletter was written on the erroneous assumption and mistaken view that the plaintiff was an\n\nemployee of the Guangzhou Equatorial Hotel. For the reasons I had set out earlier, she was\n\nat all material times the employee of the defendant company. That the plaintiff had\n\nwritten to the Managing Director of the defendant company on 21 August 1998 claiming\n\noverdue salary from December 1997 to March 1998 did not take away the validity of her\n\nclaim for overdue salaries. She did not have the benefit of legal analysis. That being so,\n\nthe defendant company should have given her the 3 months’ notice as from 13 August\n\n1998 or pay 3 months’ salary in lieu.27\n\n        The next head of claim to consider is the claim\n\nfor salary in lieu of notice. It is clear from the ‘Termination of Employment’\n\nclause in the agreement, a copy of which is in 1AB24-27, she is entitled to be paid a sum\n\nequivalent to 3 months’ salary if notice of termination was not given to her. She was\n\nnot served the notice of termination because the defendant company had taken the wrong\n\nview that she was an employee of Guangzhou Equatorial Hotel. InAlexander Proudfoot\n\nProduction Services Co S’pore Pte Ltd v Sim Hua Ngee Alvin and another appeal[1993] 1 SLR 494, it was held that the correct measure of damages for wrongful dismissal is the\n\namount the employee would have earned under the contract for the period until the employer\n\ncould lawfully have terminated it, less the amount he could reasonably be expected to earn\n\nin other employment.28\n\n        The plaintiff claimed the sum of US$99,000.00\n\nbeing the retrenchment benefits due from the defendant on the basis that it had decided\n\nand in their letters of 14 June and 15 August 1997 indicated that retrenchment benefits\n\nwould be paid toallemployees of the defendant company, whether unionised or\n\nnon-unionised employees who had served continuously three (3) years or more at the rate of\n\none month’s last drawn basic salary for each year of continuous service and a\n\nproportionate part thereof for any incomplete year of service: see 3AB894, 903-913. As a\n\nmatter of the common law of Singapore, it was common ground that an employee is not\n\nentitled to retrenchment benefits on the basis of long service. He is only entitled to be\n\npaid retrenchment benefits if the employer had agreed to do so: seeBethleham\n\nSingapore Pte Ltd v Ler Hock Seng[1995] 1 SLR 1andLoh Siok Wah v American\n\nInternational Co Ltd[1999] 1 SLR 281.29\n\n        During cross examination, the Managing Director\n\nof the defendant company, confirmed that those who were paid retrenchment included\n\nnon-unionised and executive employees of the defendant company. This was confirmed by Ms\n\nTan Lye Choo, PW3, an executive who received retrenchment benefits herself. For an example\n\nof an executive non-unionised employee who was paid retrenchment benefits was Mr Chang\n\nYing Hua, the Operations Manager of the defendant company. He had worked in Guangzhou\n\nEquatorial Hotel for a period of time. It was quite fortuitous that he had returned to\n\nSingapore when the decision to retrench was made. He was not out of sight and out of mind.\n\nHe was paid S$46,962.00 for 9 years of continuous service with the defendant company.30\n\n        The only reason why the plaintiff was not paid\n\nwas because of the mistaken classification of her as an employee of Guangzhou Equatorial\n\nHotel. The defendant company’s agreement to pay retrenchment benefits calculated on\n\nthe formula stated above was meant forallemployees of the defendant company.\n\nSince the plaintiff was the employee of the defendant company I have no doubt that the\n\ndefendant company would have paid her the retrenchment benefits if she had been correctly\n\nclassified as an employee. I refer to the 1staffidavit of the Managing\n\nDirector of the defendant. In paragraph 20 she stated: \"Before [the defendant\n\ncompany] was placed in liquidation, a list of all the employees along with their\n\nretrenchment entitlement was drawn up. The plaintiff’s name was not on this list\n\nbecause she was not an employee.If the plaintiff had been an employee, the company\n\nwould certainly have paid her any retrenchment benefits due to her. There was no reason\n\nfor the company to try and swindle her while paying its other employees.\"(emphasis added).31\n\n        Accordingly, the decision of the Liquidators in\n\nrejecting the Proof of Debt is reversed in part. There will be an order that the items of\n\nclaims allowed in accordance with this judgment be paid according to the priority as set\n\nout in the Companies Act. The defendant company is to pay costs to the plaintiff.Sgd:Lai Kew ChaiJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
