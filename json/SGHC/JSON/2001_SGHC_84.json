        "Claim": "5. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants entered the premises on 15 February\n\n2000 without their permission. The plaintiffs and various other stallholders were told to leave the\n\npremises within 24 hours. On the following day, the defendants changed the locks and locked the\n\npremises.6. The defendants then handed possession of the premises to their new tenants,\n\nMdm Fariday Awall Walter and Mr Amin Awall, who proceeded to carry out renovations.7. The plaintiffs averred that the defendants had committed trespass. The\n\nfollowing damages were claimed:(a) Loss of rental from various stallholders at $15,300 per month from 16\n\n  February 2000 to 31 July 2003;(b) Loss of profit from the plaintiffs drink stall;(c) Loss of profit from the plaintiffs chicken rice stall;(d) Loss of rental of 3 rooms at the 2ndstorey unit;(e) Loss or removal of various chattels at the premises; and(f) Punitive or alternatively aggravated damages due to the mental distress and\n\n  humiliation suffered by the plaintiffs representatives.",
        "Defence and Reply": "8. The defendants relied on the fact that they had served a writ of possession\n\n(DC Suit No. 5500/1999) on the head lessee for defaulting in payment of his rent. The head lessee in\n\nhis defence in the DC Suit admitted the rent arrears and the defendants determination of the\n\nleases. The head lessee further counterclaimed for a refund of his rental deposit. The defendants\n\nregarded this as a wrongful repudiation on the part of the head lessee but accepted that repudiation\n\nnevertheless. Accordingly, the defendants re-entered the premises. To mitigate their loss, they\n\nre-let the premises to new tenants.9. On 27 March 2000, about 6 weeks after the re-entry, the head lessee obtained a\n\ngrant of relief against forfeiture from the court. The defendants appeal against that order was\n\ndismissed on 25 April 2000. Soon thereafter on 3 May 2000, the defendants returned the keys to the\n\nhead lessee. There was no undue delay.10. On these facts, Mr Harbajan Singh acting for the defendants, submitted that\n\nthere was no trespass. Until the head lessee obtained relief, the head lessee had no status on the\n\nproperty. Mr Singh contended that the defendants had acted throughout in good faith on their right\n\nto forfeit under the leases for non-payment of rent, whereas the head lessee obtained relief against\n\nthat forfeiture not on a right he had, but on an exercise of the Courts discretion based on\n\nequitable principles.11. In answer to that, counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Andrew Ee, argued that the\n\ndefendants had waived their right to re-enter the premises by accepting the outstanding rent, which\n\nwas paid directly into defendants joint bank account. Once that right was lost, the re-entry\n\nbecame unlawful and hence, the defendants had committed trespass.12. Mr Ee submitted that the contemporaneous book entries recorded by the\n\ndefendants showed that the deposits of money by the head lessee into the defendants joint account\n\nwere accepted and treated by the defendants as payment towards the rent on a first-in-first-out\n\nbasis.

        "Counsels submissions and the law": "13. Mr Ee conceded that if the head lease had been validly determined by\n\nforfeiture, then the sublease, which depended on the head lease, would automatically determine. He\n\nrightly acknowledged that there would be no trespass if the re-entry took place after the head lease\n\nhad been forfeited unless that forfeiture was waived.14. On the facts, Mr Ee submitted that the defendants had waived their right of\n\nre-entry and forfeiture by accepting all the outstanding rent due on the 1ststorey units\n\non 12 February 2000 (i.e. 3 days before the date of re-entry).15. Mr Ee referred me to Sections 18 and 18A of the Conveyancing of Law and\n\nProperty Act (Cap. 61) in relation to the statutory restrictions on and relief against forfeiture of\n\nleases. Mr Ee correctly pointed out that Section 18 was not applicable to a re-entry or forfeiture\n\ndue to non-payment of rent: see Section 18(9). However, he said that Section 18A applies where the\n\nlessor is proceeding by writ action to enforce a right of re-entry or forfeiture for non-payment of\n\nrent. I observed however that Section 18A does not deal with the central issues here, namely, when\n\nand how a right of re-entry and forfeiture for non-payment of rent may lawfully be exercised.\n\nNeither does it deal with the circumstances under which a wavier arises. These are governed by the\n\ncommon law.16. As I will explain later, I found on the facts that the physical re-entry was\n\npeaceably effected. The defendants regained possession of the premises. The two head leases were\n\nlawfully forfeited for non-payment of rent. Although the defendants succeeded in their self-help\n\nremedy of physical re-entry without resorting to legal action, nevertheless the court can still\n\ngrant relief on equitable grounds by restoring possession to the head lessee and on whatever terms\n\nit deems fit. However, it does not follow that a subsequent grant of relief against forfeiture\n\nnecessarily converts an earlier lawful re-entry into a trespass.17. Mr Ee contended that a lease can only be forfeited after a judgment or order\n\nfor possession is obtained. Until such time that the landlord obtains an order or judgment for\n\npossession, the tenants lease has not been forfeited. On that basis, the re-entry was unlawful\n\nbecause no judgment or order for possession was obtained by the defendants prior to the re-entry.18. I did not agree. In my judgment, the lessor may re-enter physically and\n\npeaceably, provided that his right to re-enter and forfeit has arisen under the terms of the lease\n\nand that right has not in the meantime been waived by him, whether inadvertently or otherwise. Where\n\nthe landlord manages to secure actual possession without the assistance of the court, why must there\n\nalways be a supporting order or judgment for possession before the lease can be forfeited? Regaining\n\nphysical possession is clear proof of the landlords intention and election to forfeit and end the\n\ntenancy, subject of course to the courts discretion to grant equitable relief against the\n\nforfeiture.19. Similarly, service of the writ of possession on the tenant is an unequivocal\n\nact amounting to a constructive re-entry and forfeiture. Mr Ees proposition that a judgment for\n\npossession is a pre-requisite for a lawful re-entry and forfeiture has no basis whatsoever in law.20. Before I delve into the application of the law to the unique facts of this\n\ncase, it is appropriate to examine the rather technical doctrine of re-entry and waiver in the law\n\nof landlord and tenant. The Law Commission in England in 1985 stated, quite justifiably, in para.\n\n1.3 of its report, (1985) Law Com. No. 142, that the present law, \"besides being\n\nunnecessarily complicated, is no longer coherent and may give rise to injustice\". The Law\n\nCommission examined the various deficiencies and recommended a replacement with a new statutory\n\nscheme to simplify this area of the law. Be that as it may, the common law in Singapore mirrors that\n\nin England in this area.(a) Doctrine of Waiver21. Hill & Redmans Law of Landlord & Tenant 17thEdn\n\nsuccinctly summarises at p 451 the law in relation to waiver of a right of forfeiture:Waiver of Forfeiture  Rule 131(1) A right of re-entry may be waived either expressly or impliedly. There is\n\n  an implied waiver where the lessor with knowledge of the cause of forfeiture does any act which\n\n  recognises the continued existence of the tenancy.(2) An action for, demand for, or receipt of rent accrued due since the cause\n\n  of forfeiture with knowledge by the lessor of that cause is an implied waiver.(3) Where there is a continuing breach of covenant a waiver does not extend to\n\n  breaches continuing beyond the date of the acts which constitute the waiver.22. Good guidance in this area of the law can also be obtained from paragraphs\n\n509 and 510 at p 475 and 476 of Halsburys Laws of England 4thEdn Reissue Vol 27 (1):509.    Waiver of forfeiture. The landlord has the option whether to take\n\nadvantage of a forfeiture or not; and, if he elects not to do so, the forfeiture is waived. Such\n\nelection may be either express or implied, and it is implied when, after the cause of forfeiture has\n\ncome to his knowledge, the landlord does any act whereby he recognises the relationship of landlord\n\nand tenant as still continuing.  If, however, it is shown that, with knowledge of the cause of\n\nforfeiture, the landlord has recognised the tenancy, he will be precluded from saying that he did\n\nnot do the act with the intention of waiving the forfeiture. A landlord does not waive the\n\nforfeiture by merely standing by and seeing it incurred, as, for example, where the tenant makes\n\nalterations in breach of covenant and the landlord does not interfere; there must be some positive\n\nact of waiver.There is no difference in principle in the rules governing waiver of the right to\n\nforfeiture whether the breach is a failure to pay the rent or some other breach of covenant.506. What acts amount to waiver.A subsisting tenancy is recognised, and,\n\n  if the landlord has notice of the cause of forfeiture, the forfeiture is waived:(i) by bringing an action for, or by the mere receipt of, rent which has\n\n    accrued due since the cause of forfeiture, whether the forfeiture is for condition broken or\n\n    under an express proviso for re-entry;(ii)(iii) .A demand made by the landlord or his agent with knowledge of the breach for\n\n  rent due after the cause of the forfeiture operates as a waiver. Where money is accepted, it is a\n\n  question of fact whether it is tendered and accepted as rent; if it is so tendered and accepted,\n\n  it is then a principle of law that, so long as the landlord then knew of the breach, the\n\n  acceptance constitutes a waiver. Thus the fact that the landlord, by accepting rent, has no actual\n\n  intention of waiving the breach does not prevent his action amounting in law to a waiver. Nor can\n\n  the landlord prevent the waiver by demanding or accepting rent without prejudice. An\n\n  acceptance of rent in error by a managing agents clerk will bind the landlord and waive the\n\n  breach.If, however, the landlord has already shown a final determination to take advantage\n\n  of the forfeiture, for instance by commencing an action to recover possession, no subsequent act,\n\n  whether receipt of rent, or distress, or otherwise, will operate as a waiver. Forfeiture is not\n\n  waived by acceptance of rent accrued due before the cause of forfeiture unless at the same time\n\n  the landlord recognises the tenancy as subsisting, as, for example, where he describes the tenant\n\n  as such in the receipt. (Emphasis is mine.)23. I have also extracted certain useful portions from \"The Forfeiture of\n\nLeases\" by Mark Pawlowski (1993) at p 152  155:(1) An unambiguous demand for rent accruing dueafterthe breach\n\n  of covenant will constitute a waiver of forfeiture. .. Needless to say, the bringing of an action\n\n  for rent accruing due after the breach will also amount to a waiver of the forfeiture:Dendy v\n\n  Nicholl.  Demand for rent qualified by such terms as \"without prejudice\" or\n\n  \"under protest\" will operate as an effective waiver:Segal Securities Ltd. v Thoseby.(2) An acceptance of rent accruing dueafterthe breach of\n\n  covenant will constitute a waiver of forfeiture. .(3) A further point to bear in mind relates to the demand (or acceptance) of\n\n  rent (a) in arrear and (b) in advance as regards continuing breaches of covenant. Demand (or\n\n  acceptance) of rent payable in arrear will only amount to a waiver of the forfeiture for the\n\n  period up to the date when the rent falls due and the landlord will not be precluded from taking\n\n  advantage of the continuing breach after such date. On the other hand, a demand (or acceptance) of\n\n  rent payable in advance will operate as a waiver of past and continuing breaches known to the\n\n  landlord at the time of acceptance of the rent and for such period as the landlord knows they will\n\n  continue. Footnote: But it, clearly, cannot constitute a waiver of future breaches of which the\n\n  landlord has no advance knowledge.24. It would appear that waiver is entirely a matter of law and not of the\n\nparties intention. The landlord thus could not, with knowledge of the event of forfeiture, avoid\n\na waiver of forfeiture by accepting or demanding rent accruing due after that event by stipulating\n\nthat the rent was accepted \"under protest\" or \"without prejudice\". The fact that\n\nthe landlord did not intend to waive is irrelevant. As Parker J. said inMatthews v Smallwood(1910)\n\n1 Ch 777 at p 786-787:If, knowing of the breach, he does distrain, or does receive the rent, then by\n\n  law he waives the breach, and nothing which he can say by way of protest against the law will\n\n  avail him anything.25. Mr Ee cited to meHong Cheok Lam v Ong Sing Mai and 4 others(1951) 17\n\nMLJ 34. There the plaintiff rented out premises on a monthly tenancy to one Mr Lim, who in breach of\n\nthe terms of tenancy against subletting, had sublet parts of the said premises to the 4 defendants.\n\nOn 7 November 1949, the plaintiffs solicitors wrote to Mr Lim, complaining of the subletting. On\n\n2 December 1949, a notice to quit was served on Mr Lim. But prior to its expiration, the plaintiff\n\naccepted rent accruing dueafterthe date of the complaint. When the subtenants\n\nrefused to quit, the plaintiffs commenced recovery proceedings against them,inter alia, on\n\nthe ground of the prohibited subtenancy. It was held on appeal from the Civil District Court in\n\nSingapore by Murray-Aynsley C.J. that acceptance of rent after knowledge of the breach amounted to a\n\nwaiver of the right of re-entry. The English position inNorman v Simpson(1946) K.B. 158 was\n\nfollowed.26. The Court of Appeal in Singapore inStation Hotel Co v Malayan Railway\n\nAdministration[1993] 3 SLR 403appeared to have accepted that the English principles on waiver\n\nof forfeiture on acceptance of rent after knowledge of breach would similarly apply in Singapore for\n\ncontractual tenancies of non-rent controlled premises, although they have no application in relation\n\nto a breach of the provisions of the Control of Rent Act in respect of rent-controlled premises.27. There is clear authority in Singapore that an actual receipt of rent prior or\n\nsubsequent to the forfeiture, which rent accrued due before the cause of forfeiture, will not amount\n\nto a waiver. For it to operate as a waiver, the receipt must be of rent accruing due after the cause\n\nof forfeiture has arisen. Worley J. inLow Bee Hoe (w) v Morsalim Chin(1947) MLJ 3, an\n\nappeal from the Civil District Court in Singapore, had this to say:I do not know of any authority for the proposition that acceptance, after\n\n  expiry of notice to quit, of rent accrued due for a period not going beyond the date of expiration\n\n  of the notice can be a waiver of that notice and I cannot find any authority for it in the cases\n\n  to which I was referred. The case most in point isPrice v Worwood(1859) 28 L.J. 329 where\n\n  Baron Martin said \"a receipt of rent to operate as a waiver of forfeiture must be a\n\n  receipt of rent which was become due after the forfeiture was incurred and the mere receipt of the\n\n  money afterwards the rent having become due previously is of no consequence and for the very plain\n\n  reason that the entry for a condition broken does not at all affect the right to receive payment\n\n  of a pre-existing debt.\" In my view this reasoning applies equally to receipt of rent accrued\n\n  due prior to the expiry of a notice to quit.(Emphasis mine.).As pointed out inDavies v. Bristow(1920) 3 K.B. 428, the notice having\n\n  expired, the landlord can no more waive it than he can waive the effluxion of time: the\n\n  contractual relationship between the parties is ended but, whereas at common law if there is no\n\n  fresh agreement between them, (which may if necessary be inferred from the acceptance of rent) theformer tenant becomes a trespasser,28. InPrice v Worwood(1859) 4 H & N 512, the plaintiff brought an\n\naction to recover possession of three houses on account of the tenants failure to insure.\n\nHowever, the plaintiff received rent from the undertenants of the premises the day before he took\n\nout the writ. Channell B. held that the plaintiff must show thatas of the date of writhe\n\nhas the right to enter the premises before he can succeed in his action of ejectment. He must show\n\nthat the premises had remained uninsuredas at the date of writand under circumstances that\n\nwould entitle him to take advantage of the forfeiture. He found that there was a continuing breach\n\nbetween date of payment of rent and the time the action was brought. Martin B. further added thatthere would be a good right to maintain the ejectment, for the non-insurance is a continuing\n\nbreach, and its continuance during the period between the time of the payment of the rent on the 23\n\nDecember and the commencement of the suit on the 24this sufficient for the purpose of\n\nentitling the plaintiff to his verdict.(b) Continuing Breach29. The Court of Appeal in England dealt with another case of continuing breach\n\ninPenton v Barnett[1898] 1 QB 376. The headnote reads as follows:A lease contained a general covenant to repair and a covenant to repair within\n\n  three months after notice. The premises being out of repair, the lessor gave notice to the lessee\n\n  under the Conveyancing Act, 1881, to repair within a given time. Three days after the expiration\n\n  of the notice a quarters rent became due. No repairs having been done by the tenant, the lessor\n\n  brought an action to recover possession, and in the action claimed the quarters rent:-Held, that, the breach of covenant being a continuing one, no new notice was\n\n  required in respect of the non-repair after the expiration of the time specified in the notice,\n\n  and that the claim for rent did not affect the right to possession in respect of non-repair after\n\n  the date when the rent fell due.30. InPentonscase, A.L. Smith L.J. accepted the proposition that the\n\nclaim for rent up to 25 December 1896 was at most an election to treat the defendant as a tenant up\n\nto that date. But inasmuch as between that date and 14 January 1897, being the date the writ of\n\npossession was issued, the premises had remained in the same state of disrepair, there was a breach\n\nof covenant between those dates in respect of which the plaintiff could maintain his action for\n\npossession. Ribgy L.J. said that the landlord had a power of re-entry so long as there was a broken\n\ncovenant and a continuing breach. As nothing was done since the notice to repair, the position on 14\n\nJanuary 1897 would be that the plaintiff had the right to determine the tenancy by the issue of the\n\nwrit, and to sue in respect of such rights as had accrued to him during the tenancy.31. The court inDoe. Dem. Ambler v Boodbridge(1829) 9 B&C 377 held\n\nthat the use of rooms in a manner prohibited by the lease was a continuing breach, and that the\n\nlandlord was not, by receiving rent, precluded from taking advantage of the forfeiture because the\n\ncontinued use after receipt of rent was a new breach of covenant every day during the time that they\n\nwere so used.32. InDoe v Jones(1850) 5 Exch 498, the judges had this to say:Pollock CB: Where reasonable time for repair given in the notice was still\n\n  running, there was no breach to waive as opposed to a case of breach before receipt of rent, where\n\n  the acceptance of rent is a waiver of the forfeiture actually incurred.Alderson B: The receipt of rent is a waiver of all forfeitures, which are, so\n\n  to speak, single and complete, and are not in the nature of continuing forfeitures. So with\n\n  respect to continuing forfeitures, where the lessee is bound from time to time to keep the\n\n  premises in repair, and he omits for an unreasonable time, but afterwards repairs them, there the\n\n  receipt of rent waives the previous forfeiture. But where the matter is plainly a continuing\n\n  breach, the only question is, whether, when the party seeks to re-enter, the premises have been an\n\n  unreasonable time out of repair and so continue.Rolfe, B: I am of the same opinion. If, instead of \"a reasonable\n\n  time,\" the lease had named five days, within which the lessee was to repair, there could have\n\n  been no difficulty, because the 5 days had elapsed on 25 March 1847: the receipt of rent would\n\n  have been a waiver of the actual breach, but it would have been no waiver of a neglect to repair\n\n  between the 21stand 25th, for then there was no complete breach.Platt B: It is a fallacy to say that the receipt of rent was a waiver of the\n\n  breach of contract to repair, for it was a continuing breach, and until the repairs were\n\n  perfected, the lessors of the plaintiff were entitled to re-enter for the forfeiture.33. The Court of Appeal inDownie v Turner[1951] All ER 416 took the view\n\nhowever that subletting in breach of the covenant was not a continuing or recurring breach. It was a\n\nonce and for all breach taking place at the time the subletting first took place in February 1946.\n\nAfter knowing of the subletting, the landlord continued however to accept rent until 13 February\n\n1950. In April 1950, the landlord served a notice of forfeiture. The landlord was held to have\n\nwaived that subletting because he had, with knowledge of it, accepted rent subsequent to the date of\n\nthe breach.34. InFarimani v Gates[1984] 2 EGLR 66, the Court of Appeal explained\n\nthe difference between a recurring breach and a single breach in the following terms:If an obligation is to perform an act by a given time, once that time has\n\n  elapsed and the act has not been performed, there is a breach of a single obligation and not of a\n\n  continuing one. The fact that it still lies within the power of the lessee to perform the act\n\n  cannot affect the nature of his obligation. In this field of law a reference to a continuing\n\n  breach is a way of referring to breaches of a continuing obligation and does not refer to the\n\n  ability to remedy a single breach.  There is no difference between an obligation to perform an\n\n  act by a given date and an obligation to perform an act within a reasonable time. If the tenant\n\n  fails to perform the act within a reasonable time he has broken his obligation, which is a single\n\n  and not a continuing obligation: seeRe King[1963] 1 Ch 459, CA, in which Lord Denning MR\n\n  said at p 478:Let me next take the covenant to reinstate. Suppose the premises are damaged\n\n    by fire. The lessee does not reinstate within a reasonable time. The breach is over once and for\n\n    all, but its effect continues.35. With guidance from the authorities above, I therefore hold that just as with\n\nthe general covenant to repair, the obligation to pay rent on the due date each month throughout the\n\nentire duration of the lease is a continuing obligation. It gives rise to a continuing right of\n\nre-entry and a continually recurring cause of forfeiture should the obligation to pay rent be\n\nbreached. If the rent is not paid by the grace period stipulated, each day thereafter that the\n\naccumulated rent or part thereof remains unpaid must be treated as a fresh breach of obligation,\n\nentitling the landlord to exercise his right of re-entry as provided in the lease. As the rent\n\naccrues daily, a failure to pay rent on the due date cannot be regarded as a once and for all\n\nbreach. It is different from a breach by way of subletting, where the breach (i.e. the act of\n\nsubletting) is regarded as a once and for all breach of covenant taking place at the time the\n\nsublessee was first let into the premises.(c) Service of writ of possession36. Upon service of a writ of possession or after a physical re-entry, the right\n\nof re-entry ceases to be capable of waiver. It has been consummated. Thus, acceptance of rent or\n\nlevying distress after service of a writ of possession cannot be regarded as conduct amounting to a\n\nwaiver.37. InGrimwood v Moss(1871) L.R. 7 C.P. 360, it was held that the\n\nlandlords distress for rent after the date of service of proceedings for possession was not\n\nconduct amounting to a waiver.38. InCivil Service Co-operative Society v Mc Grigors Trustee[1923] 2 Ch 347, the defendant lessees relied on a demand for, payment and acceptance of, rent by the\n\nplaintiff landlords as a waiver since action brought of the causes of forfeiture, namely, a breach\n\nof covenant against assignment or otherwise parting with the demised premises and the bankruptcy of\n\nthe lessees. The demand for rent was made with knowledge of the bankruptcy and was for rent accrued\n\nin part before the bankruptcy, in part between the bankruptcy and the writ, and in part subsequent\n\nto the writ. The plaintiffs claimed in the writ that they were entitled to recover possession of the\n\npremises as on a forfeiture of the lease, delivery up of possession and mesne profits. On the\n\nquestion whether the demand for rent operated as a waiver of the forfeiture, Russell J., answered in\n\nthe negative and held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover possession on the ground of the\n\ntenants bankruptcy. In the course of his judgment, Russell J. referred toDendy v Nicholl[1893] 2 Ch. 271, as a case where the landlord, with knowledge of an underletting in breach of\n\ncovenant, had sued the tenant for arrears of rent accruing subsequent to the underletting, and\n\nobtained payment. After the issue of the writ for rent, but before actual payment of the amount\n\nclaimed, the landlord commenced an ejectment action based on non-payment of rent and the\n\nunderletting. Although the court there held that the bringing of the action for rent, and acceptance\n\nof the rent was a waiver of the right of re-entry, which waiver occurred before the ejectment\n\nbrought, Russel J. did not think that the court touched on the real question  namely, whether the\n\nissue and service of a writ in ejectment was such a final election by the landlord to determine the\n\ntenancy that a subsequent receipt of rent was no waiver of the forfeiture. He then said:In my opinion the authorities establish that this is so. InJones v. Carter15 M. & W. 718, Parke B. held that after ejectment brought, there being no evidence of actual\n\n  re-entry by the landlord, the landlord could not sue for rent; and he cites with approval a\n\n  decision of Lord Tenterden that the receipt of rent after ejectment brought for a forfeiture was\n\n  no waiver of such forfeiture:Doe v. Meux(1824) 1 C. & P. 346. To the same effect is\n\n  the case ofGrimwood v MossL.R. 7 C.P. 360, where it is definitely stated that the\n\n  bringing of an ejectment action is an irrevocable election to determine the tenancy: see alsoRex\n\n  v. Paulson[1921] 1 A.C. 271; andEvans v. Enever[1920] 2 K.B. 315. I adopt the words\n\n  of Lord Coleridge J. inEvans v. Eneverwhere he says at p 320: \"There is a\n\n  series of cases which establish that if an action is brought for recovery of possession for\n\n  breaches of covenants in the lease that is an irrevocable election to determine the lease, and\n\n  that no subsequent acts of the plaintiff can be relied on as qualifying that position.\"(Emphasis is mine.)39. After an analysis of the various authorities, Sachs J inSegal Securities,\n\nLtd. v Thoseby[1963] 1 All E.R. 500 said:Clearly, [a demand for or acceptance of rent payable in advance] cannot be a\n\n  waiver of future breaches of which the landlord has no advance knowledge;. Equally clearly, an\n\n  acceptance of rent in advance does waive a non-continuing breach in the past: such a waiver\n\n  applies both to the past and to the period covered by the rent. As regards continuing breaches, it\n\n  seems to me that in the absence of express agreement, the acceptance of rent in advance can, at\n\n  highest, only waive those breaches that are at the time of demand known to be continuing, and to\n\n  waive them for such period as it is definitely known that they will continue.40. In short, a demand or acceptance of rent due before a breach of covenant does\n\nnotper seconstitute a waiver. Neither does demanding nor accepting rent after a re-entry\n\nand forfeiture waive the forfeiture that has taken place because an irrevocable election to\n\ndetermine the lease has already been made. Thus, any acts of the lessor subsequent to a constructive\n\nre-entry and forfeiture by the issue and service of a writ of possession, or subsequent to an actual\n\npeaceable re-entry, will not be capable of waiving the forfeiture. However, if there is no writ\n\nissued, or no physical or constructive re-entry as yet, a demand or acceptance of rent accrued due\n\nafter the date of the breach of covenant or the date on which the right of forfeiture arises will\n\nconstitute a waiver irrespective of whether the demand or acceptance of the rent is on a without\n\nprejudice basis. This applies just as well to a breach arising from non-payment of rent.(d) Dispensation with notice of formal demand41. The words whether formally demanded or not often appear in forfeiture\n\nprovisions for non-payment of rent because forfeiture cannot be obtained at common law, unless there\n\nis a formal demand for rent. For this reason, leases often expressly dispense with the need for a\n\nformal demand.42. Since the common law requires a formal demand before forfeiture can be\n\neffective, it necessarily means that a demand for rental arrears accumulated prior to the cause of\n\nforfeiture itself cannot amount to a waiver of the forfeiture. Otherwise, it would be defeating the\n\nvery objective (i.e the forfeiture) that is sought. To constitute a waiver of forfeiture, the demand\n\nfor rent must necessarily be for rent accruing due after the cause of forfeiture has arisen.\n\nTherefore, demands for rent accruing due before the cause of forfeiture cannot have the effect of\n\nwaiving the forfeiture.43. What also seems clear after a review of the authorities is that where it is a\n\nnew breach surfacing or an existing breach continuing after the act of waiver, then a fresh right of\n\nre-entry and forfeiture flowing from that breach will arise. A waiver operates only in respect of\n\nthose breaches antedating the landlords act of waiver.(e) Forcible entry44. A landlord entitled to possession of land may enter forcibly and yet the\n\ntenant may have no civil remedy against him for that entry although he is liable to criminal\n\nproceedings: Hill & Redmans Law of Landlord and Tenant 17thEdn at p 521. InBlades\n\nv Higgs(1861) 10 CBNS 713, Erle C.J. delivering the judgment of the court said:It has been decided that the owner of land entitled to the possession may enter\n\n  thereon and use force sufficient to remove a wrong-doer therefrom. In respect of land, as well as\n\n  chattels, the wrong-doers have argued that they ought to be allowed to keep what they are\n\n  wrongfully holding, and that the owner cannot use force to defend his property, but must bring his\n\n  action, lest the peace should be endangered if force was justified: seeNewton v. Harland,\n\n  1 M. & G. 644, 1 Scott, N. R. 474. But, in respect of land, that argument has been overruled\n\n  inHarvey v. Brydges, 14 M.& W. 442. Parke, B., says: \"Where a breach of the peace\n\n  is committed by a freeholder, who, in order to get possession of his land, assaults a person\n\n  wrongfully holding possession of it against his will, although the freeholder may be responsible\n\n  to the public in the shape of an indictment for a forcible entry, he is not liable to the other\n\n  party. I cannot see how it is possible to doubt that it is a perfectly good justification to say\n\n  that the plaintiff was in possession of the land against the will of the defendant, who was owner,\n\n  and that he entered upon it accordingly; even though in so doing a breach of the peace was\n\n  committed.In our opinion, all that is so said of the right of property in land, applies\n\n  in principle to a right of property in a chattel, and supports the present justification. If the\n\n  owner was compellable by law to seek redress by action for a violation of his right of property,\n\n  the remedy would be often worse than the mischief, and the law would aggravate the injury instead\n\n  of redressing it.Events leading to the re-entry and re-possession45. On 30 November 1999, the defendants, through their solicitors Jing Quee &\n\nChin Joo, sent a letter of demand for paymentby 6 December 1999of the outstanding\n\nNovember 1999 rent (amounting to $10,800) in respect of the 1ststorey units. Another\n\nletter of demand dated the same day was issued for the arrears of rent also for November 1999\n\n(amounting to $2,000) in respect of the 2ndstorey unit. Both letters to the head lessee\n\nclearly stated that in the event of non-payment, the defendants would commence legal action to\n\nrecover the arrears of rent without prejudice to their rights to re-enter and take possession of the\n\npremises pursuant to Clause 4 (a) of the respective tenancy agreements. Each letter further demanded\n\npayment of the costs and disbursements incurred to date of $51.50 cts.46. Clause 4(a) of the head lease for the 1ststorey units states:4. Provided always and it is hereby agreed:(a) That if any part of any rent hereby reserved shall at any time be arrear\n\n    for twenty-one days (whether formally demanded or not) or if the tenant shall\n\n    neglect to observe any stipulation on his part herein contained or .. the landlordmay\n\n    at any time hereafter re-enter upon the demised premisesandthereupon this demise\n\n    shall absolutely determine; (Emphasis is mine.)47. Clause 4(a) of the head lease for the 2ndstorey unit was in\n\nsimilar terms as follows:4. PROVIDED ALWAYS and it is hereby agreed as follows:(a) If the rent hereby reserved or any part thereof shall be unpaid for\n\n    fourteen (14) days after becoming payable (whether formally demanded or not) ...\n\n    then... it shall be lawful for the Landlord at any time thereafter to re-enter upon the\n\n    premisesor any part thereof in the name of the whole andthereupon this tenancy\n\n    shall absolutely determinebutwithout prejudice to the right of action of the\n\n    Landlord in respect of any antecedent breachof this Agreement by the Tenant. (Emphasis\n\n    is mine.)48. Clearly, they must be construed as forfeiture clauses, where the right of\n\nforfeiture accrues only after the grace period has elapsed and the overdue rent remains unpaid. The\n\nright then becomes exercisable at the option of the landlord by a re-entry into the premises. That\n\nre-entry may be effected either by a peaceable physical re-entry, or by issuing and serving a writ\n\nof possession which amounts to a constructive re-entry in law. But I would not go so far to construe\n\nthe above provisions as giving a right to the landlord to terminate the leases absolutely (as\n\nopposed to a mere right to forfeit) so as to deny the tenant his access to relief against forfeiture\n\naltogether. Should a demand for rent be made during the grace period, it will not amount to a waiver\n\nbecause it remains a demand before the right of forfeiture has arisen. There is nothing to waive as\n\nyet.49. The requirement of a formal demand by the common law before the landlord can\n\nforfeit for non-payment of rent has been dispensed with in this case by agreement of the parties\n\nwith the insertion of the words \"whether formally demanded or not\" into the proviso\n\nfor re-entry under clause 4(a) in both leases. The landlord may thus re-enter and forfeit the lease\n\nwithout any prior demand in the event of a breach of this clause for non-payment of rent.50. When the head lessee failed to pay by the date stipulated in the letters of\n\ndemand (i.e. 6 December 1999), the defendants filed a writ of summons (DC Suit No 5500 of 1999) on\n\n13 December 1999, wherein they claimed that by reason of the head lessees failure to pay the rent\n\nboth for November and December 1999, they had acquired and were exercising their right to forfeit\n\nthe respective tenancies, and thus, they were entitled to possession of the premises. They then\n\nprayed,inter alia, for immediate delivery of possession, payment of rental arrears and mesne\n\nprofits until delivery of vacant possession. There was nothing in the writ claiming any relief\n\ninconsistent with an unequivocal demand for possession or any relief consistent with a continuation\n\nof the lease. Clearly, by the time the writ was filed, a valid cause of re-entry and forfeiture had\n\narisen because the grace periods for payment of the November 1999 rent in respect of both head\n\nleases had expired.51. But before the writ was served, the head lessee banked $10,800 directly into\n\nthe defendants joint bank account No. 014-21970-6 with DBS on 18 December 1999 following the\n\nprevious agreed mode of payment by direct cheque deposits. Although this covered the rent for\n\nNovember 1999, it left unpaid the overdue December 1999 rent for the 1ststorey units.\n\nNeither were the November and December 1999 rents for the 2ndstorey unit paid.52.For the period between the issue and service of the writ, May J. inRichards v De Freitas(1974) 29 P & CR 1 adopted the view that there is nolocus\n\npoenitentiae(i.e. opportunity of repentance). Thus acceptance of the rent during this period\n\nwould not prejudice the landlord or amount to a waiver of the cause of forfeiture, which had accrued\n\nprior to and on which the issue of the writ of possession was based.As such, acceptance of\n\nthe $10,800 payment in respect of the November 1999 rent for the 1ststorey units did not\n\nwaive the right of forfeiture claimed in the writ, which was pending service on the head lessee.53. Since the breach of the rent clause must be regarded as a continuing breach,\n\nthe cause of forfeiture under clause 4 (a) would naturally be recurring continually. Even if the\n\nlate payment and acceptance of the November 1999 rent in respect of the 1ststorey units\n\ncould waive the defendants right to forfeit on account of the head lessees failure to pay the\n\nNovember 1999 rent by 21 November 1999, nevertheless it could not in my judgment constitute in law a\n\nwaiver of the fresh breaches involving the non-payment of the next months rent for the 1stand 2ndstorey units. The right to forfeit in respect of these fresh breaches for\n\nnon-payment of the December 1999 rent eventually crystallised on 21 December 1999 for the 1ststorey units and on 29 December 1999 for the 2ndstorey unit after the respective grace\n\nperiods expired. The crystallisation arose subsequent to the date (i.e. 18 December 1999) on which\n\nthe head lessee banked in the sum of $10,800 for the November 1999 rent for the 1ststorey units. Hence, any acceptance by the defendants of this sum, whether as rent, damages or\n\notherwise, could never constitute a waiver of these fresh breaches that followed. In my view, the\n\ndefendants here were fully entitled to take advantage of any subsequent fresh breaches or\n\ncontinuation of a breach: Paragraph 511 Vol 27(1) Halsburys Law of England (4thEdition Reissue) at p 478;Penton v Barnett[1898] 1 QB 276;New River Co v Crumpton[1917] 1 KB 762.54. As a result of that incomplete settlement of the overdue rent, the defendants\n\nsolicitors wrote a letter dated 22 December 1999 to the head lessee stating that the $10,800\n\nreceived had been applied towards payment of arrears of rent accumulated before December 1999 on the\n\nbasis of the principle of first-in-first-out. The defendants solicitors notified the head\n\nlessee in no uncertain terms that acceptance of this payment and any subsequent payment was to be\n\nwithout prejudice to their clients rights accrued to date, including their right to determine the\n\ntenancy and recover possession of the premises together with all costs and expenses arising\n\ntherefrom. In particular, their acceptance of payment was not to prejudice their clients rights\n\nin DC Suit No 5500 of 1999, which they had commenced against the head lessee. The defendants\n\nsolicitors were right to take advantage of the principle of nolocus poenitentiaebetween the issue of the writ and its pending service. I noted that the head lessee already had\n\nprior notice that if they did not pay up the November 1999 rent arrears by 6 December 1999, the\n\ndefendants would commence action. If the head lessee did not take that seriously, he had only\n\nhimself to blame.55. The defendants solicitors then enquired from the head lessee if he had\n\nappointed solicitors to accept service of the writ or was prepared to accept service at the office\n\nof the defendants solicitors. No reply was received. By this letter, the head lessee should be\n\naware that the defendants had commenced action to recover possession, although the writ had not been\n\nformally served on him. To be effective in law to bring about a notional re-entry and an effective\n\nforfeiture of the lease, the lessor must serve the writ of possession on the tenant to signify his\n\nintention to treat the lease as at an end.56. In the meantime, the head lessee quickly deposited a further sum of $2000 on\n\n3 January 2000 directly into the defendants joint bank account to cover the long outstanding\n\nNovember 1999 rent, this time for the 2ndstorey unit. As explained earlier, there is nolocus\n\npoenitentiaebetween the issue and service of the writ entitling a lessee to tender the rent and\n\navoid forfeiture. InRichards v De Freitas(1974) 29 P & CR 1), May J. took the view,\n\nthough it wasobiter dictum, that even if there was acceptance of payment of the rent between\n\nthe date of issue of the writ and its service, the position of the landlord would not be prejudiced\n\nas against his tenant. On the facts of that case, he could not see any suggestion that the\n\nacceptance would have been with any intention of creating a new tenancy in anyone. There could be no\n\npossible waiver of any forfeiture if the alleged ground of forfeiture was the failure to pay rent\n\nwithin the stipulated 21 days.57.On 21 January 2000, the defendants solicitors effected substituted\n\nservice of the writ on the head lesseeby pasting a copy of the writ and order of\n\nsubstituted service on the front door of No 359A and on the notice board of the Supreme Court. The\n\nplaintiffs, having their office then at No 359A, should have been fully aware of this writ, and\n\nhence, of their head lessees failure to pay rent to his landlord.58. As on the date of service of the writ (i.e. 21 January 2000), the grace\n\nperiods for payment of the December 2000 rents for the 1ststorey and 2ndstorey units had long expired without any payment forthcoming from the head lessee. The defendants\n\nwere no doubt entitled under clause 4 (a) of the respective leases, to re-enter the premises at any\n\ntime on account of these fresh and continuing breaches (as a further ground) to determine the\n\nleases. As stipulated in both leases, no formal demand for rent was necessary as a pre-requisite for\n\nre-entry and forfeiture.59. By this act of serving the writ, the defendants finally conveyed to the head\n\nlessee (and for that matter his underlessees too) their unequivocal demand for immediate recovery of\n\npossession pursuant to their right under the leases. It was an unqualified and conclusive election\n\nto determine both leases. In serving the writ, they had in law notionally re-entered the premises\n\nand exercised their right to forfeit the two leases. As stated inCanas Property Co Ltd v K L\n\nTelevision Services Ltd[1970] 2 All ER 795 (C.A.), the landlord must not only issue, but alsoservethe writ of possession on the tenant, if he wants to effect forfeiture for breach of a covenant in a\n\nlease by way of a notional physical re-entry. I could see no reason why the defendants should be\n\nprecluded from suing for the rent accrued due prior to the date of the notional re-entry and\n\nforfeiture on 21 January 2000. Since the rent was payable in advance and not in arrear, all rents\n\naccrued due including the monthly rent falling due on 1 January 2000 could be claimed as arrears of\n\nrent, without any danger arising from a waiver of the right of re-entry or forfeiture. Had it been\n\nrent payable in arrear, then the rent could only be claimed up to 21 January 2000 and thereafter, it\n\nwould have to be claimed as mesne profits until delivery up of possession. Where the head lessee\n\ncontinues to remain in possession, he must be held liable for mesne profits, which are technically\n\ndamages for trespass.60. A judgment for possession, if obtained, would of course finally terminate the\n\nlease, and that termination would then relate back to the date of forfeiture. If the landlord had\n\nthereafter re-entered pursuant to that judgment for possession, relief against forfeiture would no\n\nlonger be possible. But in this case, the landlord physically re-enteredbeforeobtaining judgment for possession. Hence, the court had the power subsequently to grant the tenant\n\nrelief against forfeiture upon the head lessees application. But that relief subsequently granted\n\ncould not retrospectively turn the defendants in legal possession into trespassers, which apparently\n\nwas what Mr Ee had been precipitously hanging his clients case on.61. I found Paragraph 508 at p 473 of Vol 27(1) Halsburys Laws of England (4thEdition Reissue) to be enlightening. It states:508. What amounts to re-entry.The terms of a proviso for re-entry require\n\n  that, if the landlord elects to determine the lease for a forfeiture, he must do so by re-entry,\n\n  which the landlord may effect by physically entering upon the premises with the intention of\n\n  determining the tenancy orby the issue and service of proceedings for recovery of possession\n\n  of the premises. In the case of forfeiture for non-payment of rent the landlord must first\n\n  make formal demand for payment, unless this requirement is dispensed with by suitable words in the\n\n  proviso, or by statute. Usually the formal demand is expressly dispensed with by inserting the\n\n  words, whether formally demanded or not,Actual entry is not necessary in order to take advantage of the\n\n  forfeiture.When the cause of forfeiture is complete, the landlord may bring an action to\n\n  recover possession, andthe bringing of the action is equivalent to actual entry.If the\n\n  writ contains an unequivocal demand for possession, the service of the writ operates as a final\n\n  election to determine the term, whether judgment is obtained or not. (Emphasis is mine.)62. InBillson v Residential Apartments Ltd.[1992] 2 W.L.R. 15 (H.L.),\n\nLord Templeman pointed out that:In order to exercise his option to determine the lease the landlord must either\n\n  re-enter the premises in conformity with the proviso or must issue and serve a writ claiming\n\n  possession. The bringing of an action to recover possession is equivalent to an entry for the\n\n  forfeiture.63. Concluding on this point, the defendants had notionally re-entered and\n\nforfeited the leases by serving the writ of possession on 21 January 2000 pursuant to their right of\n\nre-entry and forfeiture under the respective leases. Being a valid constructive re-entry and\n\nforfeiture, the defendants would not in law be liable to any trespass on his own premises, should he\n\nfollow up with a peaceable physical re-entry to re-gain possession.Effect of Pleadings in DC Suit No 550 of 199964. Other subsequent events fortified the defendants defence here. Without\n\npaying the December 1999 and January 2000 arrears of rent, the head lessee, through his solicitors\n\nAndrew Ee & Co., filed and served a defence on 3 February 2000 in DC Suit No 5500 of 1999,\n\nadmitting the rental arrears. The head lessee said that he intended to settle the arrears promptly\n\nand would seek relief from forfeiture. This was no more than a mere statement of a future course of\n\naction intended by him rather than a specific legal or equitable defence as such. In fact, the head\n\nlessee implicitly recognised in his defence that the lease had been forfeited. Otherwise, why should\n\nhe seek relief from forfeiture? It must be pointed out that by now (i.e. 3 February 2000), the grace\n\nperiods had expired not only for the December 1999 but also for the outstanding January 2000 rental\n\nfor the premises under the two head leases.65. What was more significant was that the head lessee had on the advice of his\n\nsolicitors, counterclaimed for the return of his deposit of $32,400 being the equivalent of 3 months\n\nrental, and averred in unambiguous terms that the leases had been determined. Paragraph 9 of the\n\nhead lessees defence, which I regarded as fatal to the plaintiffs case, was as follows:9. The saidDeposit should be refundedto the Defendant [i.e.\n\n  head lessee] upon the determination of the said [Lease] Agreements, whichdetermination has\n\n  taken place upon the issue of the Plaintiffs Writ[i.e. Writ of Mr Toh Teng Seng and Mr\n\n  Sng Soon Heng] in this present action. (Emphasis is mine.)66. Either this amounted to a repudiatory breach in the form of a repudiatory\n\ntermination of the two leases by the head lessee, which the defendants were shown later to have\n\naccepted, or it was an express acceptance by the head lessee of the determination of the leases by\n\nthe defendants upon the issue of their writ of possession. Stephen Sedley J. inHussein v Mehlman[1992] 2 EGLR 87was of the view that the doctrine of repudiation applied to tenancies. See alsoChartered\n\nTrust plc v Davies[1997] 2 EGLR 83andNyehead Developments Ltd v RH Fibreboard Containers\n\nLtd[1999] 2 EG 139.67. Subject to any relevant statutory provisions on relief against forfeiture and\n\nto the general law of forfeiture applicable to tenancies, I would hold that this repudiatory\n\ndetermination of the leases by the head lessee was capable of being accepted by the landlord\n\nresulting in a premature determination of the leases, and in effect a forfeiture, but this should\n\nnot prejudice the right of the tenants to apply for relief against the forfeiture nevertheless.\n\nIt would be wrong I think to allow this common law doctrine of repudiation to circumvent the\n\nprotection or relief otherwise available to tenants against forfeiture of their leases.68. In my view, the head lessee had no basis to seek a refund of his deposit\n\nunless he also considered the leases as having been determined by the act of the defendants in\n\nissuing the writ for,inter alia, recovery of possession, which determination the head lessee\n\nmust in turn have agreed to by filing his counterclaim in the terms he did. His unequivocal demand\n\nfor an early refund of his rental deposit necessarily evinced his intention to bring the leases to a\n\npremature end. These new circumstances distinguished this case and set it apart from the authorities\n\ncited by the plaintiffs in support of their argument on waiver of forfeiture.69. Based on this defence as filed, I concluded that the defendants and the head\n\nlessee had, through this unexpected turn of events, unequivocally come to an agreement to treat the\n\ntwo tenancies as forfeited as of 3 February 2000, the date on which the head lessees defence was\n\nserved on the defendants. It must follow that a subsequent peaceable physical re-entry into the\n\npremises by the defendants, as the owners, to re-gain possession under these circumstances would\n\nnever amount to a trespass against the head lessee, or his undertenants for that matter, namely, the\n\nplaintiffs in this case, who could have no better right than the head lessee in this respect.\n\nNeedless to say, the rights of the plaintiffs here as the subtenants, would be destroyed once the\n\nhead lessees lease was lawfully forfeited, though of course, the plaintiffs might later apply to\n\nthe court themselves for relief from such forfeiture.70. Moreover, I did not think it conscionable that the defendants should be\n\nregarded as trespassers and be made to pay damages when they had in the first place actedbona\n\nfidein the belief that the head lessee had himself adopted the position that the two tenancies\n\nwere terminated, and the defendants therefore peaceably re-entered the premises to regain\n\npossession, and found new tenants to lease the premises thereafter.71. For the reasons given, the plaintiffs claim must be dismissed. In fact,\n\nonce the head lease had been lawfully forfeited, the undertenants must themselves be regarded as\n\ntrespassers in relation to the landlord and not the other way round. It would be preposterous to\n\nallow these trespassing undertenants to claim damages for trespass against the landlord.72. It would be worthwhile reiterating at this juncture that the fact that a\n\ntenant could subsequently apply for relief against forfeiture did not mean that the earlier lawful\n\nre-entry pursuant to a forfeiture clause for the failure to pay rent wouldper seconstitute\n\na trespass. The landlord could validly hold on to the re-possessed premises until the court\n\nsubsequently intervenes by granting relief against the forfeiture of the lease, whereupon the\n\nlandlord will have to surrender possession of the premises to the tenant. But until the tenant\n\nsucceeds in obtaining such an order for relief, it will be the landlord (as opposed to the tenant)\n\nwho has the right to immediate and continued possession of the premises. Just as the landlord cannot\n\npossibly claim rent for that interim period whilst he is in occupation prior to surrendering\n\npossession to the evicted tenant in conformance with the court order granting relief, neither can\n\nthe evicted tenant claim damages for trespass because (a) the landlord has gained lawful possession\n\nfollowing a lawful re-entry under the terms of the lease, and (b) the tenant is no longer under an\n\nobligation to pay rent for which thequid pro quoof peaceable enjoyment of the demised\n\npremises during that interim period without any interruption from the landlord no longer exists.73. In summary therefore, where an order for relief against forfeiture is granted\n\nbefore physical re-entry, the landlord will not be entitled to re-enter. But where the order for\n\nrelief is obtained after a lawful physical re-entry done peaceably, as in this case, the landlord\n\ncannot be said to have trespassed during the interim period when he remains in possession prior to\n\nthe granting of the relief by the court.74. In the reply and defence to the counterclaim in DC Suit No 5500 of 1999,\n\nfiled and served on 11 February 2000, Mr Toh Teng Seng and Mr Sng Soon Heng (the defendants here)\n\nmade clear to the head lessee that they were compelled to issue proceedings to recover possession of\n\nthe premises due to the non-payment of rent by him as the head lessee. Damages were claimed for loss\n\nof rent suffered for the remainder of the term from the date on which possession was recovered.75. In their reply, the defendants did not dispute paragraph 9 of the defence of\n\nthe head lessee (which asserted that the leases were determined upon issue of the writ).Effectively,\n\nthe defendants had on 11 February 2000 in their reply accepted the legal and factual position\n\nadopted by the head lessee. The defendants only contended in a very limited way that the refund\n\nof the full deposit was misconceived, or alternatively, that it was premature, since the cost of\n\nmaking good any damage to the premises found after recovery of possession would have to be deducted\n\nfrom that deposit. Clearly, the defendants were not by any means affirming the continuance of the\n\ntenancy in their reply by disputing that the head lessee was not entitled immediately to a full\n\nrefund of the deposit. The defendants stand all along had been fairly clear and consistent that\n\nthey wanted the premises back and the two leases terminated. Thus, there could be no room for the\n\nhead lessee to argue thereafter that the leases had not been determined or that there was a positive\n\nact of waiver or forfeiture by the defendants somewhere along the line. If indeed the head lessees\n\nstand was that the leases on the demised premises had not been determined, then it was the head\n\nlessee who had misled the defendants into (a) thinking that the leases had been so determined, and\n\nthen (b) acting on that basis to their detriment. The head lessee would be estopped in law from\n\nclaiming that there was now no determination of the leases.76. Subsequent voluntary payments by the head lessee, intended for rental\n\narrears, could not alter the fact that in law, the tenancies had been determined by agreement of the\n\nparties. Obviously there was no way that the defendants could stop the head lessee from dropping\n\ncheques drawn in favour of the defendants into the quick cheque deposit box in the hope of reviving\n\nthe terminated tenancies. These payments in, whether for rental arrears, damages or otherwise, could\n\nnot amount to any waiver of the lawful forfeiture that had occurred. Nor could they resurrect the\n\ntenancies after they had been determined in the manner explained. The head lessee could not be\n\nallowed to blow hot and cold. The writ of possession had been issued and served on the head lessee\n\nlong before, and according to the authorities, no subsequent acts, including acceptance of rents\n\nthereafter, could waive that final election made by the landlord to re-enter and forfeit the leases.77. In fact, the solicitors for the defendants subsequently made quite clear in\n\ntheir letter of 14 February 2000 (the day immediately preceding the re-entry) to the head lessees\n\nsolicitors that subsequent payments received after the date of issue of the writ would be regarded\n\nas payment towards arrears of rent and/or damageswithout affecting the determination of the\n\ntwo leases. The defendants solicitors wisely noted in the same letter that the head\n\nlessee had in his defence conceded (a) liability for the arrears of rent and (b) that the tenancy\n\nagreements had been determined.78. In essence, this letter confirmed the determination of the tenancies as\n\nagreed. It was also fairly obvious from what was stated therein that the withholding of the refund\n\nof the rental deposits by the defendants was never on the basis that the tenancies were intended to\n\ncontinue, but that the refunds would be temporarily withheld and paid over only after delivery of\n\nvacant possession subject to any breaches under the leases for which the defendants would be\n\nentitled to make deductions from the deposit held before its refund.79. It must be pointed out that as of this date, the defendants were still\n\nunaware that the head lessee had deposited directly into the defendants joint DBS account a sum\n\nof $10,800 on 8 February 2000, and another sum of $21,600 on 12 February 2000 with the intention of\n\ncovering the 3 months arrears of rental (i.e. December 1999, January and February 2000) for the 1ststorey units. On 12 February 2000, the head lessee deposited a further sum of $2,000 sufficient to\n\ncover the overdue rental for December 1999 but not the January and February 2000 arrears for the 2ndstorey unit. If one were to treat these 3 units as a whole, one could not say that there were no\n\narrears whatsoever outstanding as at the critical date 15 February 2000, the date of the alleged\n\ntrespass. As of that date, the rent for the 2ndstorey unit remained in arrears despite\n\nthe flurry of last minute deposits into the defendants joint bank account to avoid forfeiture\n\nunder the terms of the leases.80. In any case, Mr Sng Soon Heng testified that it was only later, on or about\n\nthe 15 February 2000, that he first knew of this deposit of $10,800. As for the other deposits of\n\n$21,600 and $2,000, he learnt of them on or about 17 or 18 February 2000. His wife informed him. His\n\nwife would check with the bank once a week to find out if there was any payment from the head lessee\n\nafter the rentals began falling into arrears. As there was no challenge by Mr Andrew Ee, I accepted\n\nMr Sngs evidence on this. This meant that as of 14 February 2000, when the defendants\n\nsolicitors wrote to the solicitors for the head lessee, the defendants were unaware of the fresh\n\npayments made.81. Granted that the defendants had not returned the payments after learning of\n\nthe fresh deposits, nevertheless these payments (on 8 and 12 February 2000) of the arrears of rent\n\nby the head lessee, even if accepted as rent and not as mesne profits or damages, could not be\n\nsufficient in law to constitute a waiver of the re-entry and forfeiture. In my judgment, they came\n\nmuch too late after the issue and service of the writ of possession on the head tenant on 21 January\n\n2000. SeeCivil Service Co-operative Society v Mc Grigors Trustee[1923] 2 Ch 347 andEvans\n\nv. Enever[1920] 2 K.B. 315, where no subsequent acts of the lessor could be relied upon to\n\nqualify the lessors irrevocable election to determine the lease by way of an action for recovery\n\nof possession.82. Mr Ee relied onPierson v Harvey(1885) 1 T.L.R. 430 where the tenant\n\nhad also been paying rent directly into the landlords bank account. When the landlord discovered\n\nthe breach of the covenant not to sublet, he commenced action to recover possession. Without giving\n\nnotice to tenant, the landlord instructed the bank not accept further cheques from the tenant. The\n\nbank inadvertently allowed one cheque to be paid on 9 July 1884 for the rent due at the end of June\n\n1884. The landlord was not aware of this until 21 October 1884, but he did not return the money. It\n\nwas held that receiving rent under protest made no difference. The landlord had not given notice to\n\ntenant that he did not intend to receive the rent. Since he had received the rent, he had therefore\n\nwaived the forfeiture.83. I declined to followPierson v Harveyif it was meant to substantiate\n\nthe proposition that payment (intended to be rent by the tenant) after service of the writ of\n\npossession on the tenant could waive the forfeiture relied on in the writ. In my view, the landlord\n\nis perfectly entitled, after the date of issue of the writ, to receive payment towards arrears of\n\nrent, mesne profits or damages as claimed in the writ without prejudicing their forfeiture of the\n\nlease consequent upon the notional re-entry by serving the writ. This was exactly what the\n\ndefendants solicitors had stated in their letter dated 14 February 2000 as to the character with\n\nwhich the defendants would be accepting the payments from the head lessee. The landlords acts of\n\nreceiving the payments after the date of issue of the writ, anda fortioriafter the date of\n\nservice of the writ, could not give rise to any waiver, the final election to forfeit having\n\nirrevocably taken place.84. Although the previous agreed method of payment was banking directly into the\n\ndefendants joint bank account by way of cheques, nevertheless the circumstances had changed so\n\nmuch and with the dispute now in the hands of solicitors, the most appropriate mode of payment in my\n\nview should have been to the defendants solicitors. Thus when the defendants went to the premises\n\non 15 February 2000 to notify the subtenants to vacate, they actedbona fidein the belief\n\nthat (a) both tenancies had been determined, (b) the head lessee had himself agreed to it, and (c)\n\nthe rental arrears had continued to remain outstanding to the best of their knowledge at that time.\n\nFurthermore, they had found prospective tenants, who had agreed to lease the premises subject to the\n\nformal contract being finalised.85. The head lessee could not revive those forfeited leases by payment of rental\n\narrears or rents due in the way he did after the writ of possession had been issued and served. He\n\ncould only apply to the court to grant him relief against forfeiture but only after fully settling\n\nall the arrears of rent.",
        "Was the physical re-entry peaceably done?": "86. After the defendants had re-entered on 15 February 2000 and regained\n\npossession of the premises on 16 February 2000, the secretary of the plaintiffs, Mr Nordin bin Mohd,\n\nwrote a letter dated 17 February 2000 to protest the re-entry, stating that Mr Toh Teng Seng had\n\ncome with five other men to threaten and intimidate them. In spite of their protests, Mr Toh had\n\npulled down the door-rail and locked up the premises, thereby preventing them and other stallholders\n\nfrom carrying on their business.87. Coincidentally on the same day, the head lessees solicitors also filed an\n\namended defence, which resiled from the position stated in their earlier defence filed on 3 February\n\n2000. The significant part of the earlier defence -which determination has taken place upon\n\nthe issue of the Plaintiffs Writ in this present action- was deleted. It would appear that\n\nboth the head lessee and plaintiffs had decided that it was necessary to change tact and treat the\n\nleases as subsisting. In my view it was much too late after the head lessee had unequivocally\n\nintimated to the defendants that the leases had been determined and the defendants had, vide their\n\nreply to the defence dated 11 February 2000 and their letter dated 14 February 2000, accepted that\n\nrepudiatory determination, and had acted on it to their detriment.88. What was perplexing was that the head lessee continued to maintain his\n\ncounterclaim for the sum of $32,400 being the rental deposits held by the defendants and at the same\n\ntime prayed for an order that the leasesbe not forfeited but do continue to be in force and\n\neffect. If the head lessee wanted to turn round and assert instead that the lease was to\n\ncontinue, then it would be inconsistent to mount a counterclaim for the refund of the rental\n\ndeposit. Having allowed matters to run so far down the road, and with the re-entry/forfeiture having\n\ntaken place and new tenants given possession of the premises for renovation works, the head lessee\n\nincluding his sublessees obviously could not be allowed unilaterally to take a different position\n\nnow i.e. that there was no determination of the tenancies at all and hence, the re-entry was a\n\ntrespass by the defendants.89. In any event, there appeared to be a concerted action by the head lessee and\n\nhis sublessees, both represented by the same set of solicitors, Andrew Ee & Co., to save the\n\nhead leases. In my view, it was too late because lawful and peaceable entry had taken place. There\n\ncould be no trespass in law. The only way to save the tenancies was for the head lessee or his\n\nsublessees to apply for relief against forfeiture. Until the court grants equitable relief, the\n\nowner is entitled to proceed with finding a replacement tenant, but he will run the risk of\n\ndisengaging from any new tenancy entered into should the court subsequently order relief against\n\nforfeiture of the tenancies.90. At the hearing, I asked Mr Nordin bin Mohd to explain how the defendants had\n\nthreatened and intimated them. He testified that on 15 February 2000, the defendants entered the\n\npremises. Mr Toh Teng Seng told the stallholders including the plaintiffs to vacate the premises\n\nwithin 24 hours. Nr Nordin asked Mr Toh whether he had any papers, letters of authority or court\n\ndocuments. Mr Nordin said that Mr Toh acted arrogantly and shouted at them, telling them to talk to\n\ntheir lawyers. However, Mr Sng Soon Heng behaved well according to Mr Nordin. On the 16 February\n\n2000, Mr Nordin witnessed the closure of the premises by Mr Toh and his men. Mr Nordin testified\n\nthat they left at once because they felt embarrassed with the whole situation.91. In any act of re-entry or re-possession by the landlord, the occupants may\n\nhave to face some embarrassment. This is unavoidable. Clearly, the plaintiffs decided to move out\n\nthemselves because of their own embarrassment, which Mr Nordin admitted in his evidence. There was\n\nno evidence that they were forced out of the premises by physical force or threats of violence of\n\nany kind by the defendants. Neither could I regard telling the occupiers to speak to their lawyers\n\nas a threat, even though Mr Toh might have told them to do so in a loud voice. Finally, Mr Nordin\n\nadmitted on oath in court that the defendants in fact did not intimidate them or threaten them,\n\ncontrary to what he had earlier stated in his letter.92. According to Mr Sng Soon Heng, the occupiers were informed on 15 February\n\n2000 that the head lessee wanted to surrender the premises. He told them to cease business and look\n\nfor the head lessee. They then changed some of the locks and said that they would lock up the\n\npremises the following day. He also personally spoke to Mr Nordin and told him that the head lessee\n\ndid not want the premises and that he wanted to take possession of the premises. When asked if they\n\nhad any court order, Mr Sng replied that he did not have any. Mr Sng then mentioned that the head\n\nlessee had informed him that Mr Nordin himself was in arrears of rental for 4 months. Mr Nordin kept\n\nquiet. Mr Sng told Mr Nordin that he knew very well why the matter ended up that way. The contents\n\nof this conversation with Mr Nordin were not challenged.93. From the totality of the evidence, I concluded that the re-entry was largely\n\npeaceful, and the plaintiffs left of their own accord due to their own embarrassment more than\n\nanything else. The head lessee was nowhere to be seen during the re-entry on 15 February 2000 and\n\nre-possession by the defendants on the 16 February 2000.94. In my judgment, the fact that the defendants had commenced an action for\n\nrecovery of possession did not preclude self-help remedies to recover the premises by themselves if\n\ndone peaceably. It did not mean that they had to wait for judgment for possession before they could\n\nphysically re-enter. If the subtenants and tenants refused to move out, then the defendants should\n\nnot forcibly remove the tenants, unless they did not mind risking the penalties prescribed under the\n\ncriminal law. A court judgment for possession would then be required to compel the subtenants and\n\ntenants to surrender possession. But if the subtenants, whether under protest or not, decide to move\n\nout upon being told to do so, the landlords would have succeeded in recovering physical possession.\n\nOnce possession is surrendered, the evicted tenants or subtenants cannot remove the landlords unless\n\nthey succeed in obtaining relief against forfeiture. If the landlords decide to allow the tenants to\n\nregain possession and continue the lease, then it is superfluous to come to court to obtain relief\n\nagainst forfeiture.95. I accepted the submission of Mr Singh that on account of the head lessee\n\nhaving stated unequivocally that the tenancy of the premises had been determined, the defendants\n\nproceeded to mitigate their loss by looking for new tenants. If indeed the plaintiffs suffered any\n\nloss as a result of the failure of the head tenant to pay the rent in the manner covenanted, which\n\ndirectly resulted in the landlords forfeiture of the two head leases, then they ought to look to\n\nthe head tenant instead and not to the defendants.",
        "New Tenants": "96. Mr Ee on the other hand tried to portray the defendants as greedy landlords\n\nwho chased out the plaintiffs after they found new tenants willing to pay a higher rent to them.97. It could not be denied that the defendants were having difficulties\n\ncollecting rent from the head lessee since November 1999. Their frustrations must have led them to\n\nfile the writ on 13 December 1999 and finally to serve it on 21 January 2000. In these\n\ncircumstances, it was perfectly reasonable for the defendants to look for new tenants to mitigate\n\ntheir loss and to minimise the period that their premises would be left vacant without a tenant. If\n\nanything at all, it showed their intention and determination to end the two leases. The defendants\n\nwere clearly not interested in continuing their tenancies with the head lessee at all. No waiver\n\ncould arise from their conduct. In any event, the correspondence with the new tenants clearly proved\n\nthat the writ was in fact issued long before any new tenancy agreement was concluded. Any suggestion\n\nof ulterior motive on the part of the defendants was without basis.98. I observed with some interest that the defendants solicitors were careful\n\nto stipulate in their letter dated 8 February 2000 to Rodyk & Davidson, the solicitors for the\n\nprospective tenants Mdm Fariday and Mr Amin Awall, that all necessary approvals from the Urban\n\nRedevelopment Authority (URA) and other relevant authorities that were required for the use of\n\nthe premises as an eating house were to be applied for and obtained by their clients at their own\n\ncost and expense. From the exchange of letters, it would appear that both the defendants and their\n\nprospective tenants were keenly aware of the need to obtain approval from the URA for change of use\n\nof the two units on the 1ststorey to that of eating house before the premises could be\n\nused as such.99. When the prospective tenants agreed that they were prepared to rent the\n\npremises for 4 years from 19 February 2000 to 18 February 2004, they forwarded a cheque on 15\n\nFebruary 2000 for $90,000 comprising 6 months rental deposit to the defendants solicitors. The\n\n1stmonths rent was free. The rent was $12,800 p.m. for the next 6 months and\n\nthereafter at $15,000 p.m.100. On the same day i.e. 15 February 2000, the defendants went to the premises\n\nto inform the occupiers to vacate the premises. On the following day, 16 February 2000, the\n\ndefendants exercised their right to re-possess the premises and locked up the premises. On or about\n\nthe same day, the keys were handed over to the new tenants to allow them to commence renovation\n\nwork.101. After securing possession of the premises, the defendants solicitors\n\nwrote to Rodyk & Davidson on 17 February 2000 that the new tenancy was subject to the relevant\n\nauthorities approval for change of use of the 1ststorey units to an eating house. In\n\nthe event that this was not approved, the intended tenancy would not be proceeded with. The\n\ndefendants eventually agreed to undertake the application to the relevant authorities for the said\n\nchange of use.102. The new tenancy agreement with Mdm Fariday and Mr Amin Awall (trading under\n\nthe name of \"Black & White Grill Ltd.\") was finally signed on 23 February 2000. The\n\nnew tenancy agreement contained detailed provisions for disengagement in the event that the\n\nnecessary approvals were not obtained.This showed that the defendants had acted prudently to\n\nobtain legal possession first before they proceeded to sign the new tenancy agreement subject to\n\ncertain terms and necessary approvals. They were not prepared to break the law and allow their\n\ntenants to operate an unapproved and illegal eating house on their premises.103. The use of the premises as an eating house without planning approval of the\n\nURA will contravene the Planning Act (Cap.232). See section 14(7) read with Sections 3(1), 12, 13\n\nand 14. The penalties are severe: a fine not exceeding $200,000, and in the case of a continuing\n\noffence, a further fine not exceeding $10,000 for every day or part thereof during which the offence\n\ncontinues.104. In the process of applying for planning permission from the URA, the\n\ndefendants discovered that neither the head lessee nor the plaintiffs had themselves any planning\n\npermission to operate the premises as an eating house. Not only was there a breach of the head lease\n\nand sublease, it was also in violation of the Planning Act. This will be of significance when\n\nconsidering whether the damages claimed by the plaintiffs had any merit.Damages105. Should I be wrong to conclude that there was no trespass, I would go on to\n\nhold that the plaintiffs had suffered no damage.106. When the court in DC Suit No 5500 of 1999 granted the head lessee relief\n\nfrom forfeiture on 27 March 2000, and ordered the defendants to restore the premises to the head\n\nlessee, the defendants said they had done so promptly on 3 May 2000 by returning the keys, after\n\ntheir appeal was dismissed on 25 April 2000. But the head lessee rejected the keys until he was\n\nordered by the court in High Court Suit No 315 of 2000 to retake possession of the premises. Since\n\nthen, the plaintiffs had not resumed their food business on the premises. Yet they were claiming\n\ndamages on the basis that they could have been continuing their food business till the end of their\n\nsublease in the year 2003.107. If there was indeed any trespass, the assessment of damages must be confined\n\nto the loss including direct consequential loss caused by the defendants occupation for the short\n\nperiod of 2  months from 16 February 2000 to 3 May 2000. Loss too remote or not traceable to the\n\ndefendants said occupation must be excluded.Restrictions on use of the premises in the head lease108. Clause 1 of the head lease of the 1ststorey units specifically\n\nstatesthat the landlords let and the tenant takes all the twoshophouses.\n\nThese words imply that the premises were specifically rented out as shophouses and not as eating\n\nhouses or coffee shops. But the plaintiffs were using the 1ststorey units as an eating\n\nhouse or a caf contrary to the provisions of the head lease.109. Clause 2 (e) of the head lease moreover stipulates that:2. The tenant hereby agrees with the landlord as follows:(e) Not without first obtaining the landlords consent and all permissions and consents\n\n  required by law to cause or permit at any time during the tenancyany such material change\n\n  in the user of the premisesas may be deemed to amount to development within the meaning\n\n  of the Planning Act of Singapore or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof;URA Planning Approval110. Mr Ayob Ali Bharoocha, the elected chairman of the plaintiffs, admitted that\n\nthe committee running the plaintiffs was not aware as a fact that planning approval from URA was\n\nrequired before the premises could be operated as an eating house. Since they took over an existing\n\neating house, they assumed that all they needed was a foodshop licence from the Ministry of\n\nEnvironment, which they had. Mr Singh showed him an application form for a licence under the\n\nEnvironment Public Health Act (Cap 95), where the applicant had to confirm that planning approval\n\nfrom Chief Planner, URA had been obtained or applied for. All Mr Ayob was prepared to say was that\n\nhe remembered filling up a form when applying for the foodshop licence but he could not specifically\n\nremember whether he had made such a statement to the Ministry of Environment. Finally, he conceded\n\nthat his food licence would be subject to URAs planning approval.111. Mr Ayob admitted that the plaintiffs never applied for any planning approval\n\nfrom URA. However, since they took over an existing food business, there could be an existing URA\n\nplanning approval for such use. What could not be disputed was that the grant of written permission\n\nfrom URA given to the head lessee (who was also Mr Ng Tiong Kiat at that time) for change of use of\n\nthe 1ststorey units (from a 1ststorey shop at No 357 and a veterinary clinic\n\nat No 359) to an eating house was for a period only up to 18 January 1993, whereupon the written\n\npermission would lapse unless further written permission was granted.112. URAs reply dated 25 February 2000 to a recent legal requisition clearly\n\nshowed that the temporary permission for use of the said two units as an eating house had in fact\n\nlapsed on 18 January 1993 and there was no further written permission granted to the head lessee. I\n\nfound therefore that neither the head lessee, nor the plaintiffs as the subtenants, had any URA\n\napproval to use the premises as an eating house after 18 January 1993. Further, the obligation to\n\nobtain all permissions or consents required by law for any material change in use of the premises\n\nhad always been that of the head lessee under clause 2 (e) of the head lessees lease agreement\n\nwith the former owners, and also under clause 2 (e) of the subtenants sublease agreement with the\n\nhead lessee, which was assigned to the plaintiffs.113. In fact, the defendants themselves applied on 1 March 2000 to the URA for\n\nchange of use to an eating house. On 24 March 2000, the URA replied (see D1) refusing permission\n\nunder Section 14 (4) of the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1998 Ed) for the premises on the 1st storey to be\n\noperated as an eating house because it wouldaffect the amenity of the residential area in\n\nterms of car parking and traffic. The refusal had nothing to do with any internal layout or\n\nstructural alterations of the food stalls or facilities at the eating house by the new tenant.\n\nHence, any attempt by the plaintiffs to bolster their claim for damages on a supposition that the\n\nURA would extend their temporary permission granted earlier had there been no renovations, would not\n\ngo very far. A second attempt in June 2000 to obtain permission was similarly rejected for the same\n\nreason (see D2). In the legal requisition from the URA (see D3), the premises had been zoned asResidential\n\nwith commercial at 1st storey onlyin the 1998 Master Plan Zoning.114. But the plaintiffs in their claim adduced evidence of damage and loss\n\ngrounded almost entirely on the prohibited use of the 1ststorey premises as an eating\n\nhouse. How the plaintiffs, as advised by his solicitors, could expect the court to grant an award of\n\ndamages on that basis was something that I could not comprehend. It would be tantamount to a\n\ndissatisfied tenant, having used the premises as an illegal betting house, bringing forth a claim\n\nagainst the lessor for damages for trespass computed on the basis of a disruption to his illegal\n\nbetting activities and the consequent loss of his lucrative profits. Obviously, a claim for damage\n\nof such nature based on an illegal mode of performance or an illegal business was not legitimate. A\n\ncourt will not assist a claimant to make good the shortfall of his ill-gotten profits by way of an\n\naward of damages or otherwise.115. If indeed the plaintiffs were serious in thinking that they were entitled to\n\noperate at the 1ststorey premises as an eating house, there would have been no reason\n\nfor them to surrender their foodshop licence to the Ministry of Environment on 10 July 2000 after\n\ntheir head lessee managed to obtain an order of relief against forfeiture of the head leases as\n\nearly as 27 March 2000. After the defendants appeal was dismissed on 25 April 2000, the\n\ndefendants had promptly 8 days later, on 3 May 2000, forwarded the keys to the head lessees\n\nsolicitors for onward transmission to their client. I found it most surprising that the plaintiffs\n\nshould surrender their foodshop licence thereafter. It was obvious to me that the plaintiffs\n\nrealised by now that they could not possibly carry on a coffee shop or a caf business at the\n\npremises legally without URA approval.116. Unfortunately, there was further dispute between the head lessee and the\n\ndefendants where the head lessee insisted on having the premises restored to their original\n\nunrenovated condition and refused to accept the keys, resulting in a string of suits and court\n\napplications that need not concern us here. The inability of the plaintiffs to re-enter after 2 May\n\n2000 was therefore not caused by the defendants but by the head lessee in refusing to accept the\n\nkeys returned by the defendants until the head lessee was compelled to do so by the court.117. Whatever it was, it was absolutely clear that the URA was not going to grant\n\nany permission for the premises to be operated as an eating house. The entire commercial objective\n\nof the plaintiffs sublease of the premises had been frustrated. I could not see why the renovated\n\nand improved premises could no longer be run as an eating house (if not more profitably), without\n\nrestoration to its former state, unless of course, there was no prospect of approval as an eating\n\nhouse by URA. If indeed the only way was to renovate the premises into a shophouse or office or some\n\nother useful commercial premises as allowed by URA, then the renovated eating house or the\n\nunrenovated Protax Caf would have to be demolished in either event. In converting the premises to\n\na shophouse or an office or some other commercial premises that the URA might approve, the old food\n\nstalls must still be demolished and renovations must still be carried out. Hence, the investment\n\nsunk in by Protax in taking over the food stalls from the previous sublessee would not be\n\nrecoverable in any event. I thus found that no damage whatsoever had resulted from the renovation of\n\nthe coffee shop at the 1ststorey premises.118. In any event, the head lessee had in breach of clause 2 (e) of the lease\n\nagreement dated 1 Jun 1997 and in complete disregard of the provisions of the Planning Act allowed\n\nthe 1ststorey units to be used as an eating house, which he should not. The head lessee\n\nwould have known that the earlier temporary URA approval had lapsed. He would know that he needed to\n\napply for URA approval as he himself made the earlier application for change of use to an eating\n\nhouse, for which only approval for a limited period was granted. Therefore, there was in law\n\nsufficient basis for the defendants to exercise their right of re-entry and to determine the lease\n\nunder clause 4 (a) of the lease due to the head lessees neglect to observe Clause 4 (e) of the\n\nlease, quite apart from the issue of non-payment of rental for the premises, although notice for\n\nsuch a breach must first be given under Section 18 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act\n\nbefore the right of re-entry or forfeiture pursuant to such a breach could be exercised.Plaintiffs claim for loss of or trespass to their goods119. In my view, the claim for loss of or trespass to chattels was unfounded.120. Mdm Norsiah Binte Haji Abdul Samat testified that the plaintiffs had brought\n\na lorry to remove their belongings. They also went to the 2ndstorey unit to take their\n\nthings away. I found corroboration from the fact that the plaintiffs could tender into court a book\n\nof records as evidence of their earnings from the various stalls purportedly run by them. If they\n\nhad not removed their belongings and just left the premises, how could they produce those records?\n\nAccording to Mdm Norsiah, the other stallholders also removed their belongings. Certain chillers,\n\ncoffee boilers, tables and chairs supplied on rental basis were taken back by the suppliers. She\n\nappeared to me to be forthright in her testimony. I believed her.121. Clearly, the plaintiffs were not deprived of the opportunity to remove any\n\nbelongings they wanted before the new tenants of the defendants started their renovations. I did not\n\nthink the new tenants nor the defendants would be interested in any of the old and used items left\n\nbehind. The former stalls were totally demolished. The premises were given a totally different and\n\nmodern look.122. When the premises were repossessed, the plaintiffs never once complained\n\nthat they were deprived of their chattels and their equipment. There was no evidence to show that\n\nthey tried to retrieve their chattels and equipment after the 16 February 2000 but were prevented by\n\nthe new tenants or the defendants. The correspondence exhibited merely showed that they wanted to\n\nhave the premises back.123. According to Mr Admin Bin Awall, no items of any significant value were left\n\nbehind by the plaintiffs.124. From the evidence of Mr Toh Teng Seng, it appeared to me that the defendants\n\nwere very reasonable and accommodating. When the roti-prata seller asked him for one week to remove\n\nhis things from his room on the second storey, Mr Toh said that he telephoned the new tenants for\n\ntheir permission and they agreed. It did not seem to me that the defendants would have any interest\n\nin refusing anyone permission to remove their belongings. I imagine that it would have made it more\n\ndifficult for the defendants to persuade these stallholders to vacate the premises had they done so.\n\nFrom the spontaneity of Mr Tohs evidence on how he went out of his way to try to help the\n\nroti-prata stallholder finish selling his roti-prata by eating roti-prata himself, getting his\n\nworkers to do the same and offering to pay for it, it did not appear to me that he had acted harshly\n\ntowards the stallholders. More likely than not, the stallholders were given sufficient opportunity\n\nto retrieve their possessions. Thereafter, they left voluntarily and the re-possession of the\n\npremises was peaceful. I could not see why the defendants would not accord the same courtesy to the\n\ndefendants if indeed they had requested for more time to remove their belongings.125. If the tenants or subtenants refused to take steps to remove their\n\nbelongings after reasonable notice and opportunity had been given to them to do so, it would be too\n\nlate now to complain that there was loss of or trespass to their goods by the landlord upon lawful\n\nre-entry and re-possession of the premises. Thereafter, the landlord or his agents would be entitled\n\nto remove these goods or discard them. The landlord cannot then be accused of committing trespass to\n\nthe goods left behind in the premises.126. I accepted Mr Tohs evidence that they had in fact locked up the premises\n\nin a very amicable way. I also accepted his evidence that they had informed the stallholders that\n\nthe keys to the coffee-shop would be handed over to the contractors and if they wanted to remove\n\nanything, they could get the contractors to open the doors. I believed Mr Sngs evidence that they\n\ndid not take any photo-copier, computer, equipment or any items of value from the premises. His\n\nevidence was that when they went upstairs on 16 February 2000, there was a mattress on the floor\n\nbelonging to Mr Mohammad selling roti-prota. In another room were two chairs, a table and some\n\nnewspapers on the floor. Downstairs were one or two refrigerators, kitchen utensils, two to three\n\nshowcases, a few gas cylinders, bowls and plates and one signboard. He was not interested in them.\n\nIf the owners wanted to take them, they could. In my view, it would be much easier for the\n\ncontractor to do the renovations if the owners of the items were to remove them. Otherwise, the\n\ncontractor would be saddled with their disposal. The allegation of the plaintiffs that they lost\n\ntheir goods was not substantiated by the evidence.Conclusion127. I concluded that the plaintiffs had removed the belongings that they wanted.\n\nOnly items of inconsequential value or non-reusable items like the Protax Caf signboard were left\n\nbehind. I did not find any evidence of unlawful taking, removing or damaging of goods belonging to\n\nthe plaintiffs by the defendants or their agents acting at their behest. The plaintiffs failed to\n\nprove any legitimate damage. They also did not prove that they could have obtained URA approval to\n\nrun the premises as an eating house. They did not show that they could have netted a profit if the\n\npremises were merely used as an ordinary office or a shophouse while having to pay the hefty $16,000\n\np.m. rent on their sublease to the head lessee. No evidence whatsoever in this direction was\n\nadduced. That burden rested with them, which they failed to discharge.128. Accordingly, I dismissed the plaintiffs claim with costs to be taxed if\n\nnot agreed.",
