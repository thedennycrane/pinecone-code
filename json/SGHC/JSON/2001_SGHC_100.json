        "Section 5(1) of the Civil Law Act": "10.    Section 5(1) of the Civil Law Act, which corresponds to the\n\nfirst limb of section 18 of the English Gaming Act 1845, provides as follows:(1) All contracts of agreements, whether by parol or in writing, by way of\n\n  gaming or wagering shall be null and void.11.    Section 5(1) of the Civil Law Act, which renders all\n\ncontracts of gaming or wagering void, has no extra-territorial effect. As such, this sub-section,\n\nwithout more, applies only to contracts governed by Singapore law.",
        "Section 5(2) of the Civil Law Act": "12.    Section 5(2) of the Civil Law Act, which corresponds to the\n\nsecond limb of section 18 of the English Gaming Act 1845, provides as follows:(2) No action shall be brought or maintained in the court for recovering any\n\n  sum of money or valuable thing alleged to be won upon any wager or which has been deposited in the\n\n  hands of any person to abide the event on which any wager has been made.13.    Section 5(2) casts a larger shadow on gambling transactions\n\nthan section 5(1). It is a procedural section which bars from the courts in Singapore any action to\n\nrecover, inter alia, any sum of money alleged to have been won upon a wager, regardless of whether\n\nor not the wager was concluded in Singapore or elsewhere and whether or not the wagering contract,\n\nif made abroad, was lawful at the place at which it was made.14.    When explaining the effect of the corresponding English\n\nprovision, namely the second limb of section 18 of English Gaming Act 1845, Lord Radcliffe said inHill\n\nv William Hill (Park Lane) Ltd[1949] AC 530, 579, as follows:The second part, being lex fori, might well apply to relieve our courts of the\n\n  duty of adjudicating on foreign wagering contracts which by the ordinary rules of private\n\n  international law would escape invalidation by the first part.15.    It is also pertinent to note thatHalsburys Laws of\n\nEngland(4thed, 1996, Conflict of Laws,para 1081)states the position\n\nas follows:In so far as the Gaming Act 1845 enacts that no suit is to be brought or\n\n  maintained to recover any sum of money or valuable thing alleged to have been won upon any wager,\n\n  it is a statute affecting procedure and therefore no action lies in England for money upon a wager\n\n  in a foreign country, even though the wager is lawful by its proper law.16.    It follows that if SC is making a claim for money alleged\n\nto be won upon a wager, such a claim will not be allowed by section 5(2) of the Civil Law Act.",
        "Section 5(6) of the Civil Law Act": "17.    As for section 5(6) of the Civil Law Act, which corresponds\n\nto section 1 of the English Gaming Act 1892, it provides as follows:(6) Any promise, express or implied, to pay any person any sum of money paid by\n\n  him under or in respect of any contract or agreement rendered null and void by subsections (1) and\n\n  (2), or to pay any sum of money by way of commission, fee, reward or otherwise in respect of any\n\n  such contract or of any services in relation thereto or in connection therewith, shall be null and\n\n  void, and no action shall be brought or maintained to recover any such sum of money.18.    Section 5(6) of the Civil Law Act refers to contracts which\n\nare rendered null and void by sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 5. However, as has been mentioned,\n\nonly section 5(1) of the Act renders a contract of gaming null and void. Section 5(2) is merely a\n\nprocedural section which bars claims within its ambit.C. CHARACTERISATION OF SCS CLAIM19.    As has been mentioned, if SC is claiming from Mr Tan money\n\nwon upon a wager, the claim would be barred from our courts by section 5(2) of the Civil Law Act,\n\nwhich being part of the lex fori of Singapore, applies to all attempts to recover money alleged to\n\nbe won upon any wager, regardless of whether the gambling took place in Singapore or abroad. Counsel\n\nfor SC, Mr Foo Maw Shen, stressed that this is not what SC is claiming from Mr Tan and that SC is\n\nmerely claiming a refund of the \"loan\" given to him to gamble in their casino. The\n\n\"loan\" is based on the fact that Mr Tan gave them cheques in return for chip purchase\n\nvouchers to acquire chips to gamble at the casino. Mr Foo pointed out that inLas Vegas Hilton\n\nCorporation t/a Las Vegas Hilton v Khoo Teng Hock Sunny[1997] 1 SLR 341, Chao Hick Tin J, as he\n\nthen was, followed the English rule that loans made abroad for the purpose of betting upon games\n\ntaking place abroad, and there lawful, are recoverable. He added that this position had also been\n\nadopted in an older case,DAlmeida v DMenzie(1886) 5 Kyshe 126.20.    The question of applying theLas Vegas Hiltoncasewill only arise if Mr Tan had been given a loan by SC. Unlike the defendant in theLas Vegas\n\nHiltoncase, who admitted that he had taken a loan, Mr Tan denied having taken any loan from SC.\n\nHis counsel, Mr Tan Kay Khai, stated as follows in pp 19-20 of his written submissions:The plaintiffs have labelled the transaction a loan/credit transaction. However\n\n  the  underlying transaction was to allow the defendant to gamble on credit and the transaction\n\n  is a contract by way of gaming. The cheques were not given for cash and indeed, no money\n\n  changed hands.In the present case, a debt was incurred because the defendant was a losing\n\n  player and the plaintiffs are claiming the recovery of his gambling losses. In other words, the\n\n  plaintiffs claim owe[s] its origin to the fact that gaming bets were made by the defendant and\n\n  the sum of AUD 194,840 represents the unpaid monies so won by the plaintiffs.Section 5 of the CLA  prohibits an action based on any promise (express or\n\n  implied) to pay a sum won on the wager. Accordingly, despite previous payments by the defendant,\n\n  an obligation of honour cannot be transformed into a legal liability (as a loan or as money due on\n\n  the cheques) because such transformation seeks to turn money which was in the first place won on a\n\n  wager into something else.21.How SCs claim against Mr\n\nTan is characterised is thus of utmost importance. The real question in this case may thus be framed\n\nas follows: Considering the arrangement between SC and Mr Tan regarding the CCF facility offered to\n\nhim, and the events which occurred, is SC seeking to recover a loan or money alleged to be won upon\n\na wager? To answer this question, it is necessary to consider whether or not SCs act of\n\nexchanging Mr Tans five house cheques of AUD 50,000 each for chip purchase vouchers resulted in\n\nthe creation of a genuine loan to him.22.    A very sensible approach on the effect of an exchange of a\n\ncheque for chips was adopted in a Scottish case,Cumming v Mackie(1973) SLT 242. Although\n\nthat case is fraught with difficulty and concerned a number of statutory provisions which are not\n\nrelevant to the issue in the present case, the following passage from Lord Frasers judgment at p\n\n244 merits attention:Where a member of an ordinary social club, which is not connected with\n\n  gambling, carries out a transaction which he would ordinarily describe as \"cashing a cheque\n\n  at his club\", I do not think that there is any question of the club making a loan or advance\n\n  to the member. I should have thought that the member, by handing over his cheque, puts the club\n\n  in funds to the amount of the cheque, and the club in return undertakes to meet the members\n\n  gambling losses to the face value of chips.The member pays in advance, and he never has to\n\n  repay any loan.(emphasis added)23.    There is no reason why the position should, in the absence\n\nof any statutory provision governing the position, be altered in the case of an exchange of cheques\n\nfor chips or chip purchase vouchers in a casino.24.    The English position on whether or not there is an\n\nunderlying loan when a cheque is exchanged for gambling chips is different. InCrockfords Club\n\nLtd v Mehta[1992] 1 WLR 355, 368, Stuart-Smith LJ summed up the English position when he said\n\nthat the old cases relating to gaming proceed on the basis that where there is an exchange of cash\n\nor tokens for a cheque, there is an underlying loan. This is not to say that English law on the\n\nrecovery of loans made for the purpose of gambling is uncomplicated. Indeed, inCHT Ltd v Ward[1965] 2 QB 63, 86, Davies LJ conceded, while referring to loans made for gambling in England and\n\nabroad, that the position may have to be reviewed when he said as follows:The question whether these authorities correctly interpret and apply the\n\n  statutes with regard to either sort of loan may be a matter for consideration elsewhere. Whether\n\n  in any event it is in the public interest that either sort of loan should be recoverable might be\n\n  a matter for consideration by Parliament.25.    For the purpose of determining whether SCs claim should\n\nbe characterised as a claim for a sum of money won upon a wager or as a loan, the history of the\n\nEnglish Gaming Acts and the approach of the English courts to contracts of gaming ought to be\n\nexamined. The history of the English Gaming Acts was discussed in great detail by Selvam J inStar\n\nCruise Services Ltd v Overseas Union Bank Ltd[1999] 2 SLR 412. What needs to be reiterated here\n\nis that not all the English Gaming Acts have corresponding provisions in Singapore. As such, some of\n\nthe English decisions discussed below concern statutory provisions which are not altogether relevant\n\nto the position in Singapore. All the same, they are discussed for the sole purpose of illustrating\n\nthe unwillingness of English courts to accommodate attempts to evade the provisions of the English\n\nGaming Acts.26.    English legislation on gaming contracts was intended to\n\ncheck gambling on credit. As a result, judges have more often than not forcefully thwarted\n\nmanoeuvres to outflank the Gaming Acts by disguising claims for gambling debts as other types of\n\nclaims.27.    To begin with, inHill v William Hill (Park Lane) Ltd[1949] AC 530, the House of Lords made it clear that creditors could not avoid the Gaming Acts by\n\nentering into fresh agreements with debtors for the payment of gambling debts. Often enough, such\n\nfresh agreements had been entered into after the creditors threatened to report the debtors to their\n\nbanks or others in authority. Viscount Simon said at p 548 as follows:One cannot read the Gaming Act 1845 without perceiving that it was a very\n\n  serious attempt on the part of the legislature to put down wagering, and I decline to think thatsuch\n\n  an obvious and fatal blot was permitted to exist in it, which would well-nigh neutralize its\n\n  practical effect, when I find language used which is perfectly apt to meet the case and which\n\n  to my mind can fairly bear no other interpretation than that which would thus render it effective.(emphasis added)28.    Attempts to get around the Gaming Acts by instituting an\n\naction for accounts also failed in a number of cases. InLaw v Dearnley[1950] 1 KB 400, the\n\nCourt of Appeal emphasized, when striking out an action for accounts stated in respect of betting\n\ntransactions, that it is the reality of the transaction which must be looked at and not the way in\n\nwhich it was presented to the court. Singleton LJ said as follows at p 417:There is no getting away from the fact that the plaintiff sued the defendant in\n\n  respect of bets on horses and really on nothing else, whatever he may choose to call the action.The fact remains that the courts of this country are not meant for use for the recovery of\n\n  gambling debts. Everyone has recognised that for a long time.That is why other names or\n\n  labels are put upon them when they are brought into court.(emphasis added)29.    More relevant to the present case are the cases where the\n\nEnglish courts rejected claims on gaming contracts which were disguised as claims for the recovery\n\nof loans. InWoolf v Freeman[1937] 1 All ER 178, the plaintiff was the proprietor of a club,\n\nat which card games were played with chips and counters. The defendant purchased 30 worth of chips\n\nfrom the club and paid for them with a third partys cheque. The cheque was subsequently\n\ndishonoured. There was a practice in the club that if a loser had insufficient chips to pay for his\n\nlosses, both the winner and the loser would proceed to the club office, where the office paid the\n\nwinner on behalf of the loser. After the office had paid the defendants losses on his behalf, the\n\nplaintiff sued the defendant for 30, the price of the counters, or alternatively, for the same sum\n\nas money lent. The claim was dismissed by Macnaghten J, who said as follows at p 181:Here is a man carrying on a club for the purpose of gaming or wagering at\n\n  cards, and if the proprietor of such a club chooses to sell his chips on credit, orfor a\n\n  security that proves to be of no avail, then it seems to me that he cannot have resort to a\n\n  court of law to enforce the obligation of that member. Therefore the sum of 30 for chips cannot\n\n  be recovered by reason of the Gaming Acts.(emphasis added)30.    MacNaghten Js judgment was applied by the Court of\n\nAppeal inCHT Ltd v Ward[1965] 2 QB 63, where another attempt to recover what the plaintiff\n\ncontended was a loan was dismissed. In this case, the plaintiffs were the proprietors of a club and\n\nthe defendant was a member of that club. Poker, as played in the club was lawful gaming within\n\nsection 16 of the English Betting and Gaming Act 1960. It was played by means of chips, which were\n\nobtained from the plaintiffs, who debited the members accounts with the total value of chips\n\nobtained by them. Weekly statements of account were sent out to members. By 22 June 1961, the\n\ndefendants account showed that her gaming losses amounted to 196 14s 2d. The plaintiffs sued\n\nthe defendant to recover that sum as money loaned to her for the purpose of enabling her to engage\n\nin gaming at the club. Their claim was dismissed by Lawton J, whose decision was affirmed by the\n\nCourt of Appeal. Davies LJ, who delivered the judgment of the Court, said that in all essentials,Woolf\n\nv Freemanwas indistinguishable from the case before the court. Noting that the main contention\n\nof the plaintiffs, put in various ways, was that the issue of the chips to the defendant was\n\nequivalent to a loan of money, he said at p 79 as follows:It is impossible to accept this analysis of the situation. People do not game\n\n  in order to win chips; they game in order to win money. The chips are not money or moneys\n\n  worth; they are mere counters or symbols used for the convenience of all concerned in the gaming.31.    InMacDonald v Green[1951] 1 KB 594, the English\n\nCourt of Appeal also had occasion to express its disapproval of an attempt to disguise a gambling\n\ntransaction as a loan made to a gambler after he had already incurred losses at the gambling table.\n\nAlthough that case concerned an alleged loan given after the gambling losses had already piled up,\n\nit is still worth noting. In that case, the plaintiff was the managing director of a company which\n\ncarried on business as bookmakers and commission agents. In June 1949, the defendant owed the\n\ncompany 4,020 for losses on betting transactions. The plaintiff agreed to lend the defendant money\n\nto pay his debt. A company servant delivered a cheque for 4,020 to the defendant, together with a\n\nnote, which the defendant signed. The note acknowledged the receipt of the cheque and stated that\n\nthe defendant would repay the loan by weekly instalments of 80. The defendant endorsed the cheque\n\nand handed both documents to the companys servant. The defendant defaulted when the balance of\n\nthe loan was 1,860 and the plaintiff sued to recover this sum. The defendant contended that the\n\ncontract concerned the payment of money by the plaintiff to the creditor company in respect of\n\nbetting losses and not a loan. The plaintiffs claim was upheld by Slade J. However, the Court of\n\nAppeal took a different view. Denning LJ, as he then was, stressed that the courts must look at the\n\nsubstance where a transaction is disguised as a loan. He explained that bookmakers would be\n\npresented with a means of evading the Gaming Acts if Slade Js decision was upheld and added as\n\nfollows at p 605:The transaction seems to me to fall precisely within the words of s 1 of the\n\n  Gaming Act, 1892. The money for which MacDonald sues is money which his bank paid to the\n\n  bookmaking company in respect of the betting debts which Green had incurred. I do not think it\n\n  matters whether in point of law, MacDonalds claim against Green was for money lent or for money\n\n  paid at Greens request.Even if it were disguised in the form of a loan, the substance of itwas that MacDonald paid Greens losses and seeks to recover the amount from Green. That he\n\n  cannot do.(emphasis added)32.    The decision of the House of Lords inLipkin Gorman v\n\nKarpnale Ltd[1991] 2 AC 548 also sheds some light on how SCs claim should be viewed. In that\n\ncase, one Cass, a partner in the plaintiff firm of solicitors and a compulsive gambler, took money\n\nfrom the firms client account and exchanged it for chips, which were used by him to gamble at the\n\ndefendant club. One of the issues which arose was whether or not there was a separate contract for\n\nthe purchase of the chips. Lord Templeman, with whom Lord Ackner, Lord Bridge and Lord Griffiths\n\nagreed, said at p 562 as follows:Another way of analysing the position is this. When Cass entered the club as a\n\n  member, the club made to him a revocable offer to gamble with him in the manner and upon the terms\n\n  dictated by the club. Those terms required Cass to pay his gambling stakes in advance and to allow\n\n  the club to pay their gambling losses in arrears. The revocable offer by the club was accepted by\n\n  Cass when he staked a chip and became irrevocable when the croupier accepted the chip as a stake.There\n\n  was only one contract and that was a gaming contract.(emphasis added)33.    Lord Templemans view that there was only one contract,\n\nnamely a gaming contract, merits attention. I do not see why the payment of Mr Tans gambling\n\nstakes in advance by a cheque alters the fact that there was only one contract and that was a gaming\n\ncontract. That the transactions involving the handing over by Mr Tan of the house cheques in\n\nexchange for chip purchase vouchers are an integral part of the entire gaming transaction cannot be\n\nconveniently ignored. As such, although theLipkin Gormancase involved a different issue,\n\nnamely the right of a person whose funds have been stolen and used for gambling purposes at a club\n\nor casino to recover the amount lost by the gambler, the passage from Lord Templemans judgment\n\ncited above may nonetheless be conveniently modified for the purpose of the present case to read as\n\nfollows:By allowing Mr Tan to open a CCF at the casino, the casino made to him a\n\n  revocable offer to gamble with him in the manner and upon the terms dictated by the club. Those\n\n  terms permitted Mr Tan to pay his gambling stakes in advanceby chequeand to allow the\n\n  club to pay their gambling losses in arrears. The revocable offer by the club was accepted by Mr\n\n  Tan when he staked a chip and became irrevocable when the croupier accepted the chip as a stake.There\n\n  was only one contract and that was a gaming contract.(emphasis added)34.    The approach of the courts towards gaming should not differ\n\nmerely because a cheque was exchanged for chips or chip purchase vouchers. In the light of the\n\ndiscussion above, I do not accept that a claim cannot be viewed as an attempt to recover money won\n\nupon a wager merely because a cheque was exchanged for gambling chips, which, in the main, could\n\nonly be used for gambling in a casino. To hold otherwise would be to mock the attempt by the\n\nlegislature to curb gambling on credit. If a teacher, who took 100 students to an amusement park\n\nwhere tokens are required for rides and other forms of entertainment, gave the amusement park a\n\ncheque of $1,000 for the tokens, no one expects the amusement park to sue for the recovery of a\n\n\"loan\" if the cheque is dishonoured. Why should there be a difference merely because\n\ntokens or chips are supplied by a casino in return for a cheque?35.    Whether there is a genuine loan must depend on the\n\ncircumstances in each case. If the facts in this case are examined closely, it is evident that Mr\n\nTan gambled and lost the sum which SC is seeking to recover from him. I thus hold that whether SCs\n\nclaim is framed as a recovery of a loan, a claim on dishonoured cheques or one for money had and\n\nreceived, the action may be characterised as one for money won upon a wager even though Mr Tan\n\nissued five house cheques for the chip exchange vouchers.D. CONCLUSION36.    In the final analysis, the issue in this case is whether or\n\nnot the courts in Singapore should be concerned with what is, in truth, a claim by SC for money won\n\nupon a wager. Section 9A of the Interpretation Act (Chapter 1) provides that in the interpretation\n\nof a written law, a purposive interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the\n\nwritten law shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.\n\nThere can be no doubt that a purposive interpretation should be given to section 5(2) of the Civil\n\nLaw Act to relieve our courts from having to deal with such a claim. In the face of a claim which is\n\nessentially one for money won at a gambling table, one ought to be mindful of Rabels remark that\n\n\"games of chance, indeed, are not worthy of serious judicial consideration\". (SeeConflict\n\nof Laws: A Comparative Study,2nd ed, 1958, 572.) It should also be borne in mind that\n\nalmost two centuries ago, inGilbert v Sykes(1812) 16 East 150, 162, Bayley J referred to\n\nthe feeling of judges that \"it would be a good rule to postpone the trial of every action upon\n\nidle wagers till the Court had nothing else to do.\" More recently, in his article onLoans\n\nfor Extraterritorial Gambling and the Proper Law[1998] SJLS 421, 428-429, Associate Professor\n\nYeo Tiong Min rightly observed that \"in the modern context, the legal policy behind [section 5]\n\nof the Civil Law Act is arguably not only the discouragement of behaviour which is, though not\n\nconsidered fundamentally immoral, at least undesirable, but also the prevention of such disputes\n\nfrom occupying the time and resources of the court, which are better spent on other more deserving\n\nmatters\".37.    For the reasons already stated, SCs claim is dismissed\n\nwith costs.Tan Lee MengJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
