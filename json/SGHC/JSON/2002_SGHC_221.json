        "The trial below": "7        During the trial, a very\n\ndifferent version of events was narrated by all three men. Their oral testimony was that\n\nit was Tan alone who had arranged for Yap to work at the chicken rice stall, and that the\n\nappellant did not know that Yap was working there between 1 and 15 August 2001. The\n\nappellant was the sole defence witness, while Yap and Tan were among the witnesses called\n\nby the prosecution.8        Yap’s evidence in\n\ncourt was that the appellant was not involved in his decision to work at the chicken rice\n\nstall. He stated that it was Tan alone who had given him the address of the stall and had\n\ntold him to work there. Yap initially stated in court that there was no discussion between\n\nTan and the appellant concerning his employment at the chicken rice stall. However, on\n\nfurther questioning, he conceded that there had been a previous discussion between Tan and\n\nthe appellant, but claimed that he did not know the contents of the discussion.9        On cross-examination, Yap\n\nstated that he had told the appellant in mid-July 2001 that he intended to quit because\n\nthe pay was too low. Yap said that the appellant gave him two weeks off from 1 to 16\n\nAugust 2001 in order for him to consider whether he wished to continue working at Jie\n\nSheng. His evidence was that the appellant did not know that he had been working in the\n\nchicken rice stall during those two weeks, and had in fact told him that his work permit\n\nwould have to be cancelled if he intended to work somewhere else.10        Tan’s evidence in\n\ncourt was also that the appellant did not know that Yap had been working at the chicken\n\nrice stall from 1 to 15 August 2001. Tan admitted that he and the appellant had previously\n\ndiscussed the idea of Yap working in the chicken rice stall. Tan stated that the appellant\n\nhad said there would be no problems with the arrangement, as long as Tan informed him\n\nbeforehand. Tan claimed that he did not tell the appellant that Yap was working at the\n\nchicken rice stall from 1 to 15 August 2001 because he was there on a trial basis, and Tan\n\nhad not yet decided whether to formally employ him.11        The appellant was the only\n\nwitness for the defence. His evidence was that he had told Yap that if he intended to work\n\nanywhere else, he must have his work permit cancelled first. He had agreed to Yap’s\n\nrequest for two weeks off in August 2001 as business was not good at that time and by\n\ngiving Yap time off he would not need to pay his wages for those two weeks. He had spoken\n\nto Yap about the possibility of him working at the chicken rice stall, and had also\n\ndiscussed the possibility with Tan. However, he denied having actually directed Yap to\n\nwork at the chicken rice stall.12        All three men relied on\n\nthe same explanation for the discrepancies between their oral testimonies and the contents\n\nof the previous statements: Chui – the MOM investigating officer – had failed to\n\naccurately record their statements. The defence alleged that the statements were\n\ninaccurately recorded on several grounds. First, Chui had only a C6 grade for his GCE\n\n‘AO’ level Chinese. Since the questioning took place in Mandarin, Chui was not\n\nsufficiently proficient in the language and this caused the statements to be erroneously\n\nrecorded. Second, Chui had refused to amend the statements even after being told that\n\ncertain portions were inaccurate or untrue. Third, it was alleged that the statement made\n\nby Tan had not been interpreted to him in sufficient detail before he was asked to sign\n\nit.",
        "The decision below": "13        The appellant was\n\nconvicted by district judge Hoo Sheau Peng on 26 March 2002. The district judge held that\n\nthe version of events narrated by the three men in court was both unreliable and\n\ninconsistent, and that their previous inconsistent statements reflected the truth of what\n\nhad happened. The district judge further held that unsatisfactory answers had been given\n\nwhen explaining the discrepancy between the evidence in court and the previous statements.14        The district judge also\n\nfound no merit in the defence’s allegations that the previous statements had been\n\ninaccurately recorded by the MOM officer Chui. She noted that Chui bore no grudge against\n\nthe appellant, and had absolutely no reason to fabricate the contents of the recorded\n\nstatements. She also noted that none of the three men had stated any difficulty in\n\nunderstanding Chui’s questions or responses. He was therefore sufficiently proficient\n\nin Mandarin to record the statements made by the three men.",
        "The Appeal": "15        It is established law that\n\nan appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are plainly wrong, or are\n\nclearly reached against the weight of the evidence. This was recently reiterated by this\n\nCourt inTeo Kian Leong v PP[2002] 1 SLR 147, following the principle enunciated\n\nin cases such asLim Ah Poh v PP[1992] 1 SLR 713,Jimina Jacee d/o CD\n\nAthananasius v PP[2000] 1 SLR 205andRamis a/l Muniandy v PP[2001] 3 SLR 534.16        The grounds of judgement\n\nissued by the district judge set out her reasoning with great comprehensiveness and\n\nclarity, in accordance with the requirement laid down inKwan Peng Hong v PP[2000] 4 SLR 96. I found no basis on which to fault her reasoning, and on the totality of the\n\nevidence I found that there was no reason to conclude that the findings made by the\n\ndistrict judge were either wrong or against the weight of the evidence. I accordingly\n\ndismissed this appeal and now give my reasons.",
        "The oral testimony of the three men": "17        The appellant argued that\n\nthe district judge erred in law and fact when she ruled that the credit of Yap and Tan had\n\nbeen impeached. There was no merit to this assertion. It was clear from the grounds of\n\njudgement that the district judge had exhaustively assessed the evidence before concluding\n\nthat Yap and Tan were not reliable witnesses. More importantly, the oral evidence given by\n\nboth men in court was patently unreliable.18        I turn first to consider\n\nYap’s evidence in court. He initially claimed that there was no discussion between\n\nTan and the appellant. He then said that there had been a discussion, but that it took\n\nplace a long time ago. Upon further questioning, he stated that he had no idea of the\n\ncontents of the discussion. This was nothing more than a confused attempt to explain away\n\nthe discrepancies in his own evidence. The contradictory nature of Yap’s evidence was\n\naptly summarised by the district judge: \"If he had no idea of the contents of the\n\ndiscussion, why should Mr Yap know about and remember the event?\" The district judge\n\nwent so far as to call such evidence ‘ridiculous’, and I found this description\n\nboth accurate and appropriate.19        Turning now to Tan’s\n\nevidence, it was clear that he was equally inconsistent in court. Tan had initially said\n\nthat he would only employ Yap with the appellant’s knowledge and permission. This was\n\nto prevent any awkwardness in his relationship as the appellant’s tenant.\n\nNevertheless, he claimed to have done exactly the opposite, and did indeed employ Yap\n\nbehind the appellant’s back. His only explanation for this startling change of heart\n\nwas that Yap was working on some sort of \"trial basis\". In these circumstances,\n\nI found it hard to believe that Tan would allow Yap to work for him at the chicken rice\n\nstall – even on a so-called \"trial basis\" – without the\n\nappellant’s knowledge and consent.20        I noted that both Yap and\n\nTan had incentives to alter their evidence in order to exonerate the appellant. At the\n\ntime of the trial, Yap was still working as a coffee shop assistant for the appellant. As\n\nfor Tan, he maintained a continuing business relationship with the appellant as his tenant\n\nat Jie Sheng. Tan even stated in court that he referred to the appellant as\n\n‘boss’.21        The appellant suggested\n\nthat the district judge should have accepted the exculpatory evidence of Yap and Tan\n\nbecause they were the prosecution’s own witnesses. This argument was without merit,\n\nas it ignored the fact that the credit of both men had been impeached in the court below.\n\nThe procedure for the impeachment of a witness’ credit is laid out in s 157 of the\n\nEvidence Act (Cap 97), which states:The credit of a witness may be impeached in the\n\n    following ways by the adverse partyor, with the consent of the court, by the party who\n\n    calls him:(a) by the evidence of persons who testify that they from their\n\n    knowledge of the witness believe him to be unworthy of credit;(b) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the\n\n    offer of a bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence;(c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his\n\n    evidence which is liable to be contradicted;(d) when a man is prosecuted for rape or an attempt to ravish, it may\n\n    be shown that the prosecutrix was of generally immoral character. (emphasis mine)It can clearly be seen that the party who calls a witness is entitled\n\nto impeach the credit of that witness with the consent of the court. The appellant’s\n\nsuggestion that a trial judge is obliged to accept the exculpatory evidence of a\n\nprosecution witness is contrary to the unambiguous language of s 157 of the Evidence Act.22        Turning now to the\n\nappellant’s oral testimony, he admitted that he had previously discussed the\n\npossibility of Tan employing Yap to work at the chicken rice stall. However, he claimed\n\nthat he had told Tan that Yap’s work permit would have to be cancelled first. The\n\nappellant also claimed to have given Yap two weeks off from 1 to 16 August 2001 in order\n\nto give him some time to decide whether he wished to continue working at Jie Sheng. This\n\nwas the appellant’s explanation as to why Yap was not working at Jie Sheng from 1\n\nAugust 2001 to the time when he was arrested by the MOM officers. He also maintained that\n\nhe did not tell Yap to go and work at the chicken rice stall during this time.23        The coincidental timing of\n\nthis sequence of events was remarkable. It was on 15 August 2001 that Yap was discovered\n\nby MOM officers at the chicken rice stall. The appellant basically suggested that, had Yap\n\nnot been discovered by the MOM officers, he would have reported back to work at Jie Sheng\n\nthe very next day. In addition to this remarkable coincidence of timing, I do not find it\n\nbelievable that the appellant had not told Yap to work at the chicken rice stall. Yap was\n\nthe appellant’s employee, while Tan was the appellant’s tenant. That both would\n\ncontrive to go behind the appellant’s back to do what he had expressly forbidden was\n\nsimply unbelievable.",
        "Reliance on the previous statements": "24        The appellant further\n\nargued that the district judge erred in law and fact in that she gave undue weight to the\n\nincriminating statements recorded by Chui. I found this argument to be similarly without\n\nmerit. The prosecution applied under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act to substitute the\n\nprevious inconsistent statements of the three men in light of the material inconsistencies\n\nin their oral testimony. I noted certain things about the recorded statements:a) The statements were contemporaneous. They were all recorded within\n\n    three days of the raid at the Chicken Rice Stall. The facts were still unquestionably\n\n    fresh in the minds of the three men.b) When making the statements, there was no reason for the men to\n\n    misrepresent the facts in order to implicate the appellant. As outlined above, both Yap\n\n    and Tan continued to have business dealings with him. It was in fact particularly damaging\n\n    to the appellant’s case that hisownstatement implicated him in a clear and\n\n    unambiguous manner:I therefore agreed to this matter of ‘Ah Mao’ helping out\n\n    at the inspected premise for ‘Ah Huang’. Both ‘Ah Huang’ and myself\n\n    then told Ah Mao to go over and work as a stall assistant at the inspected premise since\n\n    01.08.2001 this year.c) The explanation for the inconsistency in the previous statements was\n\n    highly unconvincing. I found no merit in the allegation that the statements were not\n\n    recorded accurately. The recording officer Chui did not bear any grudge against the\n\n    appellant, and had no reason to fabricate evidence against him. Despite his C6 grade in\n\n    GCE ‘AO’ level Chinese, none of the three men had any difficulty understanding\n\n    the questions posed by Chui in Mandarin. Furthermore, both Tan and the appellant had made\n\n    minor amendments to their statements before signing them, showing that they had taken the\n\n    opportunity to amend any inaccuracies in their statements. And they did not amend the\n\n    portions of their statements which had clearly incriminated the appellant.25        I thus found that the\n\ndistrict judge was acting in accordance with the principles outlined in s 147(6) of the\n\nEvidence Act, and further expounded upon inChai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP[1999] 1 SLR 25,which govern when a previous inconsistent statement may be substituted as\n\nsubstantive evidence. The statements were contemporaneous, the makers had no reason to\n\nmisrepresent the facts, and the explanations given for the discrepancies were reliable. I\n\ntherefore dismissed the appeal, and upheld the appellant’s conviction.",
        "Appeal against sentence": "26        The appellant had also\n\nappealed against the sentence imposed by the district judge. He relied on the case ofChoy\n\nTuck Sum v PP[2000] 4 SLR 665, where the accused was tried and convicted of abetment\n\nfor the same offence under s 5(1) of the EFWA. The accused in that case was sentenced to\n\none month’s imprisonment and fined $7,920. On the authority of this case, the\n\nappellant argued that his sentence of two months was manifestly excessive.27        Before I turn toChoy\n\nTuck Sum, I wish to emphasise that sentencing in criminal cases is not a scientific\n\nprocedure. One cannot simply look at the sentence passed in a previous case, and then\n\nconclude that the identical sentence should be passed in another case with similar facts.\n\nIf sentencing were to be reduced to such a mathematical exercise, then this would severely\n\nhamper the trial judge’s fundamental discretion to pass sentences in accordance with\n\nall the factors of a particular case.28        I turn now to considerChoy\n\nTuck Sum. In that case, the accused was a sole proprietor in the construction trade\n\nand had supplied one of his 13 workers to work as a cleaner in another premises. The\n\nappellant argued that he was less culpable than the accused inChoy Tuck Sum’scase\n\non the ground that he was not sub-contracting his worker to Tan. The appellant also\n\nclaimed that the district judge failed to take into account the fact that he made no\n\nfinancial gain from his actions in the present case.29        It is settled law that an\n\nappellate court will not generally interfere with the sentence passed below unless there\n\nwas some error of fact or principle, or the sentence was manifestly excessive or\n\ninadequate. This was clearly stated inPP v Md Noor bin Abdul Majeed[2000] 3 SLR 17.30        I did not find the two\n\nmonths’ imprisonment imposed by the district judge to be manifestly excessive. The\n\ndistrict judge explained that the appellant was not any less culpable than the accused inChoy\n\nTuck Sum’scase. While the accused inChoy Tuck Sumonly had one previous\n\nconviction under the EFWA, the appellant had two fairly recent convictions under the EFWA.\n\nThe appellant’s punishment was thus appropriately higher than that meted out inChoy\n\nTuck Sum’scase. Moreover, I found no merit in the appellant’s argument that\n\nhe had made no financial gain from his actions. After all, the district judge held that\n\nthe appellant had knowingly entered into the arrangement with Tan and Yap because it had\n\nsuited him not to pay Yap’s wages during that two week period, as business was bad.\n\nIn any case, it was clear from the case ofLai Oei Mui Jenny v PP[1993] 3 SLR 305that, while the lack of financial gain is a legitimate mitigating factor, it carries\n\nvery little weight in court.",
        "Conclusion": "31        For the above reasons, the\n\nappeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeRepublic of SingaporeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
