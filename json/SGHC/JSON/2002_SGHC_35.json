        "Background": "2. The plaintiffs are part of theFilaGroup of Companies which\n\nare well-known manufacturers and retailers of sports apparel and footwear. The plaintiffs\n\nare the proprietors of the following registered trademarks in Singapore:(i) TM No. B77477 (FILAlogo) in Class 25 in respect of\n\n\"sports clothing, stockings and shoes\"; and(ii) TM No. 81702 (FILA[stylised]) in Class 25 in respect of\n\n\"articles of sports clothings, stockings and shoes\" (hereafter collectively\n\nreferred to as the ‘trade marks’).The first defendant is the sole-proprietor of PT International\n\nCorporation. The second defendant is a company incorporated in Singapore, of which the\n\nfirst defendant is a director and a majority shareholder, holding 90,000 of the 100,000\n\npaid-up shares in the company. Both defendants share the same office premises at 102F,\n\nPasir Panjang Road #06-07, Citilink Warehouse Complex, Singapore 118530.3. The plaintiffs took out this Originating Summons requesting for\n\npre-action discovery and Interrogatories with a view to commencing an action against the\n\nfirst and second defendants for trade-mark infringement. In the affidavit in support of\n\nthe application, the plaintiffs' representative stated that more than 70,000 pairs of FILA\n\nTomaia-style sandals bearing counterfeits of theFILAandFILAlogo\n\ntrade-marks had been seized pursuant to various raids conducted in Italy. Six container\n\nloads of FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes bearing counterfeits of theFILAandFILAlogo trade-marks had also been seized during a raid in Sweden. The plaintiffs alleged that\n\nthe counterfeit FILA Tomaia-style sandals and FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes were\n\nimported into Italy and Sweden by a Swiss company known as Dieseel GmbH (Dieseel). Dieseel\n\ninformed the plaintiffs that the counterfeit products had been obtained from the\n\ndefendants; a copy of an invoice together with shipping documents were annexed to the\n\naffidavit in support of this allegation. The invoice, which was issued by PT International\n\nCorporation and addressed to Dieseel, showed that 57,600 pairs of FILA Tomaia-style\n\nsandals were shipped from Singapore to Genoa, Italy by the first defendant.4. In prayers 1 and 3 of the application, the plaintiffs requested the\n\nfirst and second defendants to each file an affidavit stating whether the following\n\ndocuments are or have been in their possession, custody or power and, if not now in their\n\npossession, custody or power, when they had parted with the same and what had become of\n\nthem:(a) purchase orders, invoices, delivery order, receipts or any other\n\ndocuments relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA\n\nEurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any products bearing the wordFILAor the\n\n\"F\" device (FILA products) by the defendants to Dieseel GmbH;(b) correspondence between the defendants and Dieseel GmbH relating to\n\nthe sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or\n\nother FILA products;(c) purchase orders, invoices, delivery orders, receipts or any other\n\ndocuments relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA\n\nEurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products by the defendants to any\n\nother parties, apart from Dieseel GmbH;(d) correspondence between the defendants and any other parties (apart\n\nfrom Dieseel GmbH) relating to the sale and supply by the defendants of FILA Tomaia-style\n\nsandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products;(e) purchase orders, invoices, delivery orders, receipts or any other\n\ndocuments relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA\n\nEurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products from the defendants or vice\n\nversa;(f) correspondence between the first defendant and the second defendant\n\nrelating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports\n\nshoes and/or any other FILA products;(g) purchase orders, invoices, delivery orders, receipts or any other\n\ndocuments relating to the purchase, procurement or acquisition by the defendants of FILA\n\nTomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products;(h) correspondence between the defendants and their supplier/s relating\n\nto the purchase, procurement or acquisition by the defendants of FILA Tomaia-style\n\nsandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products.5. The plaintiffs applied in prayers 2 and 4 for an order that the\n\ndefendants allow them within 14 days from the date of the order, to inspect the originals\n\nor copies of the above documents and to make copies thereof.6. In prayers 5 and 7 of the application, the plaintiffs applied for\n\nleave to administer the following Interrogatories to the first and second defendants\n\nbefore the commencement of proceedings:(1) Have you ever had any business dealings with a Swiss company known\n\nby the name of Dieseel GmbH?(2) If the answer to (1) is in the affirmative:-(a) state in detail how you came to know Dieseel GmbH;(b) name the individual/s in your business who deals with Dieseel GmbH;(c) name the individual/s in Dieseel GmbH who dealt with the\n\n  individual/s in your business:(d) state whether you at any time sold or supplied to Dieseel GmbH FILA\n\n  Tomaia-style sandals, FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products?(3) Did you at any time sell or supply FILA Tomaia-style sandals and/or\n\nFILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products to any other party?(4) If the answer to (3) is in the affirmative:-(a) state in detail how you came to know the party identified in you\n\n  answer to question (3) above;(b) name the individual/s in your business who deals with the party\n\n  identified in your answer to question (e) above;(c) name the individual/s in the party identified in your answer to\n\n  question (3) above who dealt with the individual/s in your business:(5) Who did you obtain the FILA Tomaia-style sandals and/or FILA\n\nEurojogger-style sports shoes and/or any other FILA products from?(6) State in detail how you came to know the party or parties\n\nidentified in (5) above;(7) Name the individual/s in your business who dealt with the party or\n\nparties identified in (5) above; and(8) Name the individual/s in the party or parties identified in (5)\n\nabove with whom you dealt with.7. The plaintiffs applied in prayers 8 and 9 for an order that the\n\ndefendants answer the Interrogatories set out above and for leave to be granted to the\n\nplaintiffs to use the documents and/or information disclosed pursuant to the orders\n\nagainst the defendants.The decision below8. The Assistant Registrar refused to grant an order for discovery of\n\nthe documents set out above, but leave was granted to administer Interrogatories in para\n\n6(1) and (2) to the first defendant before the commencement of proceedings. The first\n\ndefendant was ordered to answer the Interrogatories and file and serve the Answers on the\n\nplaintiffs within 14 days of the order. The Assistant Registrar did not grant leave to the\n\nplaintiffs to administer Interrogatories to the second defendant.9. The plaintiffs appealed against the Assistant Registrar’s\n\ndecision in refusing to grant an order for discovery, in not allowing Interrogatories set\n\nout in para 6(3) to (8) to be administered to the first defendant and, in not granting\n\nleave to administer Interrogatories to the second defendant. Conversely, the defendants\n\nappealed against the decision to grant leave to administer the Interrogatories set out in\n\npara 6(1) and (2) above.",
        "Order for discovery": "10. Before me, counsel for the defendants submitted that there was a\n\nreal likelihood that the disclosure as requested by the plaintiffs would expose the\n\ndefendants to prosecution under s 49 of the Trade Marks Act Cap 332 (the Act). It is\n\nwell-established in Singapore that the privilege against self-incrimination applies to\n\npre-trial discovery and is not abrogated or affected by s 134 of the Evidence Act Cap 97;\n\n(seeRiedel-de Haen Ag v Liew Keng Pang[1989] SLR 460,Guccio Gucci SpA v\n\nSukhdav Singh[1992] 1 SLR 553,Lee Thin Tuan v Louis Vuitton[1992] 2 SLR 273). A defendant will be entitled to rely on the privilege if there is a real or\n\nappreciable risk that incriminating answers will expose the defendant to arrest or\n\nprosecution for any criminal offences (Riedel-de Haen Ag v Liew Keng Pang). Section\n\n49 of the Act states:-Any person who –(a) ………………(b) sells or exposes for sale; or(c) ………………Any goods to which a registered trade mark is falsely applied shall,\n\n  unless he proves that –(i) having taken all reasonable precautions against committing an\n\n  offence under this section, he had, at the time of the commission of the alleged offence,\n\n  no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark and on demand made by or on behalf of the\n\n  prosecution, he gave all the information in his power with respect to the persons from\n\n  whom he obtained the goods; or(ii) he had acted innocently,be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not\n\n  exceeding $10,000 for each goods or thing to which the trade mark is falsely applied (but\n\n  not exceeding in the aggregate $100,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5\n\n  years or to both.11. Counsel for the plaintiffs, on the other hand, argued that the\n\ndefendants were not entitled to claim the privilege against self-incrimination, as the\n\nprivilege has been abrogated by s 134 of the Evidence Act and that the line of authorities\n\nestablished byRiedel-de Haen Ag v Liew Keng Pangshould not be followed. Counsel\n\nfor the plaintiffs cited authorities from Malaysia (seeTelevision Broadcasts Ltd v\n\nMandarin Video Holdings Sdn Bhd[1983] 2 MLJ 346; AG of Hong Kong v Zauyah Wan Chik\n\nAnd Others[1995] 2 MLJ 620) and India, which held that the privilege against\n\nself-incrimination had been abrogated by their equivalent to our s 134 of the Evidence\n\nAct. Counsel also drew the court's attention to the position in England where (arising\n\nfrom the House of Lords' decision inRank Film Distributions Ltd v Video Information\n\nCentre & Others[1982] AC 380 which decision our courts followed), the privilege\n\nhad been statutorily withdrawn in intellectual property matters (by virtue of s 72 of the\n\nSupreme Court Act 1981) and where the privilege had been criticised in the context of\n\ncivil proceedings. Section 134 of the Evidence Act states: -(1) A witness shall not be excused from answering any question as to\n\n  any matter relevant to the matter in issue in any suit, or in any civil or criminal\n\n  proceeding, upon the ground that the answer to such question will criminate, or may tend,\n\n  directly or indirectly, to criminate, such witness, or that it will expose, or tend,\n\n  directly or indirectly, to expose, such witness to a penalty or forfeiture of any kind, or\n\n  that it will establish or tend to establish that he owes a debt or is otherwise subject to\n\n  a civil suit at the instance of the Government or of any other person.(2) No answer which a witness shall be compelled by the court to give\n\n  shall subject him to any arrest or prosecution, or be proved against him in any criminal\n\n  proceeding, except a prosecution for giving false evidence by such answer.(3) Before compelling a witness to answer a question the answer to\n\n  which will criminate or may tend, directly or indirectly, to criminate such witness, the\n\n  court shall explain to the witness the purport of subsection (2).12. The first defendant had admitted in his affidavit that the goods as\n\ndisclosed in the shipping documents were supplied to Dieseel by him, but claimed he\n\nhonestly believed those goods were genuine. The first defendant stated in his affidavit\n\nthat he was claiming the privilege against self-incrimination, as he had been advised by\n\nhis solicitors that to reveal any particulars of transactions relating to the allegedly\n\ncounterfeit FILA goods would expose him to a real risk of being prosecuted for offences\n\nunder the Act. The second defendant stated in its affidavit that it did not deal with\n\nDieseel in respect of the sale of the allegedly counterfeit FILA goods and also claimed\n\nthe privilege against self-incrimination.13 I was of the opinion that the first defendant wasnotentitled to rely on the privilege against self-incrimination. This was because he had\n\nadmitted that he supplied the goods to Dieseel as disclosed in the shipping documents; he\n\nhad already incriminated himself. Apart from his admission, the invoice clearly showed\n\nthat the first defendant had apparently supplied 57,600 pairs of FILA Tomaia-style sandals\n\nto Dieseel. Consequently, the first defendant could not claim the privilege in any event.14. In respect of the second defendant, counsel for the plaintiffs\n\nsubmitted (as an alternative to the submission that the privilege had been abrogated in\n\nSingapore), that the privilege against self-incrimination was not available to a company.\n\nReliance was placed on Australian and American authorities, which held that the privilege\n\nonly applied to natural persons and did not extend to incorporated companies. There was no\n\nnecessity in this regard to determine whether in Singapore the privilege against\n\nself-incrimination could be relied on by companies since, there was no basis for an order\n\nof discovery to be made against the second defendant in the first place. I was however\n\ninclined to accept the argument of counsel for the plaintiffs that a company is not\n\nentitled to claim privilege under s 134 of the Act, based on the strict wording of\n\nsubsections (1), (2) and (3). I note in this regard that none of the authorities cited by\n\ncounsel for the defendants (para 10 supra) involved companies but individuals as\n\ndefendants. Even so, the second defendant in its affidavit had denied any involvement with\n\nDieseel in respect of the sale of the allegedly counterfeit FILA goods; this was not\n\ndisputed by the plaintiffs. There was also no evidence to suggest that the second\n\ndefendant was involved in the supply of FILA goods to Dieseel.15. Consequently, I made the following orders for discovery:1. That the first defendant do within seven (7) days from the date of\n\n  the order make and file an affidavit stating whether any of the following documents are or\n\n  at any time have been in his possession, custody or power and, if not now in his\n\n  possession, custody or power, when he parted with the same and what has become of them:-purchase orders, invoices, delivery order, receipts or any other\n\n    documents relating to the sale or supply of FILA Tomaia-style sandals and/or FILA\n\n    Eurojogger-style sports shoes by the first Defendant to Dieseel GmbH, restricted to the\n\n    approximately 70,000 pairs of FILA Tomaia-style sandals seized in Italy and the six\n\n    container loads of FILA Eurojogger-style sports shoes seized in Sweden.2. That the first defendant do within fourteen (14) days from the date\n\n  of the order allow the plaintiffs to inspect the originals (or copies, if originals are\n\n  not available) of all documents disclosed pursuant to (1) above and to allow the\n\n  plaintiffs to make copies thereof.",
        "Interrogatories": "16. Counsel for the first defendant submitted that the Interrogatories\n\nin para 6(1) and (2)(a) to (d) were irrelevant as they concerned matters which were not\n\npart of a potential civil action and, that the questions were the plaintiffs’ attempt\n\nto obtain information for the purposes of criminal proceedings. In particular, counsel\n\ncontended, the Interrogatory in (1) was unnecessary since the first defendant had already\n\nconfirmed that it had supplied the goods disclosed in the shipping documents to Dieseel.\n\nCounsel claimed that as question (2)(d) was an attempt to uncover past acts of\n\ninfringement by the first defendant, the first defendant was entitled to rely on the\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination.17. I was of the opinion that the Interrogatories allowed below should\n\nbe administered tobothand not only to the first, defendants. This was because the\n\ninvoice and the shipping documents clearly showed that the first defendant had indeed\n\ndealt with Dieseel and, the first defendant was a director and a majority shareholder of\n\nthe second defendant which shared premises with the first defendant. However, under O 26A\n\nr 2 of the Rules of Court, it was not necessary at this preliminary stage for\n\nInterrogatories (2)(a) to (c) to be administered to the first defendant – the\n\nplaintiffs can always re-apply for the same Interrogatories to be administered to the\n\nfirst defendant at or after the discovery stage, once action has been commenced.18 At the conclusion of the hearing, I allowed the plaintiffs to\n\nadminister the following Interrogatories to both defendants before commencement of\n\nproceedings:(1) Have you ever had any business dealings with a Swiss company known\n\nby the name of Dieseel GmbH?(2) If the answer to (1) is in the affirmative, state whether you have\n\nsold or supplied to Diseel GmbH FILA Tomaia-style sandals and/or FILA Eurojogger-style\n\nsports shoes which form part of the goods seized by the plaintiffs in Italy and in Sweden.to be answered within 14 days of the date of the order.19. Interrogatory 2 above was a revised and restricted version of the original\n\nInterrogatory 2(d) the plaintiffs had applied to administer to both defendants. I had\n\nlimited the scope of the question to those goods the plaintiffs had already seized in\n\nItaly and Sweden, instead of allowing the plaintiffs to obtain information generally on\n\nwhether the defendants had sold/supplied to Diseel'any/or any other FILA products'.\n\nI was of the view that Interrogatories should not be used by trade-mark proprietors as acarte\n\nblancheto obtain any information they chose, as a substitute (and an easy one at\n\nthat) for their own investigations into possible infringement of their\n\ntrade-marks/trade-names and above all, the procedure should not be misused to shift the\n\nburden of disproving the infringement, onto the other party resisting the application.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
