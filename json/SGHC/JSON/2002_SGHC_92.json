        "The undisputed facts": "2.    The appellant was the managing director of a company known as\n\nYuen Catering Services Pte Ltd (\"Yuen Catering\"), which operated a restaurant\n\nalong Upper East Coast Road. Previously, she had been a chef at Goodwood Park Hotel from\n\n1985 to about 1994. In the course of her work as a chef, she got to know a subordinate,\n\nRosalind Yeo Good Lian (\"Rosalind\") with whom she became good friends.3.    In 1998, the appellant was introduced to one Mr Teo Hock Seng\n\n(\"Mr Teo\"), the managing director of Komoco Holdings Pte Ltd\n\n(\"Komoco\") by a friend, Margaret Chong Yin Fun (\"Margaret\") who worked\n\nas a sales manager at Komoco. Mr Teo offered the appellant the opportunity to operate a\n\ncanteen at Komoco’s premises situated at 253, Alexandra Road, Komoco Property\n\nBuilding (\"the canteen\").4.    Subsequently, the appellant met Rosalind by chance at the carpark\n\nof Goodwood Park Hotel. Rosalind told the appellant that she was unhappy working at the\n\nhotel and wanted a change of environment. The appellant informed her of the opportunity to\n\noperate a canteen business at Komoco.5.    In due course, a licence was obtained by Yuen Catering to run\n\nthe canteen at Komoco. In or about October 1998, the canteen commenced its operations,\n\nwith both Chinese and Muslim food being available. Rosalind was working at the canteen\n\nright from the beginning. In January 1999, the appellant started working at the canteen as\n\na cook for the Chinese food and remained until 19 October 2000. A Muslim cook, Jamaldin\n\nMiah Bin Brahim Miah (\"Jamal\") was hired sometime in December 1999. During the\n\nperiod from October 1999 to 19 October 2000 one Kamruzman @ Farouk (\"Farouk\"), a\n\nBangladeshi, was working at the canteen as a cleaner. He was arrested on 19 October 2000\n\nby officers from the Ministry of Manpower when he was found without valid travel\n\ndocuments. He pleaded guilty and was convicted of the charge of entering into Singapore\n\nillegally, in contravention of s 6(1)(c) of the Act. A sentence of one month’s\n\nimprisonment and four strokes of the cane was imposed on him and he had since served the\n\nsentence.The case for the prosecution6.    It is the prosecution’s case that the appellant was the\n\nowner or operator of the canteen and that she had employed Farouk, an immigration\n\noffender, without ever having seen either a passport or a genuine work permit.7.    During the trial, Farouk testified that he had gone to the canteen\n\non a Friday in the afternoon at about 2-3 pm, though he could not remember exactly which\n\ndate it was, to enquire about a job advertised in the newspaper. When he arrived, Rosalind\n\nwas at the cash counter and asked him to take a seat first, as she was busy. When she was\n\nfree, she came over to where he was seated and queried whether he knew what the job was\n\nabout. Then Rosalind went into the kitchen to call the appellant. Both the appellant and\n\nRosalind were present at the interview even though it was the appellant who did most of\n\nthe talking. The appellant asked Farouk whether he had a work permit, to which he replied\n\n‘yes’. After the interview, the appellant told Farouk to leave behind his\n\ncontact number and that she would call him if she needed him. The following Monday, Farouk\n\nreceived a page asking him to go down to the canteen. When he arrived, he reported to\n\nRosalind, who confirmed that someone had paged him to go to work and directed him to the\n\nkitchen. On the same day, he showed a photocopy of a work permit to Rosalind who took down\n\nsome particulars. This work permit was not shown to the appellant. He further testified\n\nthat it was the appellant who told him that his salary was to be $900 a month and about\n\nhis duties which involved cutting the vegetables, washing the dishes and cleaning the\n\ncanteen at the end of every working day. She was also the one who later raised his salary\n\nto $1000 a month. In his opinion, the appellant was the person in charge of the canteen.\n\nShe would be at the canteen from 8.00 – 8.30 am in the morning to about 3 – 3.30\n\npm in the afternoon. In many matters pertaining to work, she was to be approached. In\n\nfact, he had seen Rosalind approaching the appellant several times for instructions. He\n\nconsidered Rosalind the manager who tended to the cash counter and dealt with\n\nworkers’ salaries.8.    Rosalind gave evidence of her duties at the canteen, which\n\ninvolved fronting the cash counter and sometimes serving food. She was also responsible\n\nfor taking stock and ordering through suppliers. Her responsibilities, however, did not\n\ninvolve any hiring or firing of staff. The agreement with the appellant initially with\n\nrespect to the canteen business was that Rosalind was to have a salary of $2000 and a\n\n50%-50% profit sharing arrangement. Her employer was Yuen Catering and she received CPF\n\ncontributions. Although Rosalind considered herself a part-owner of the canteen at the\n\nbeginning, subsequently, she found that she was not a part-owner as she did not have the\n\nfinal say and the appellant had to be consulted for her approval on matters pertaining to\n\nthe canteen. The vegetable and meat suppliers had to be approved by the appellant. Two\n\nemployees were dismissed at the direction of the appellant. Advertisements for workers\n\nwere also put up in accordance with the appellant’s wishes. Rosalind further\n\ntestified that, when Jamal came looking for work in response to an advertisement, Rosalind\n\nhad to interview him because the appellant was busy in the kitchen. When Jamal had asked\n\nfor a higher salary than that of the previous Muslim cook, Rosalind had to go to the\n\nkitchen and ask the appellant, who agreed to pay the higher salary.9.    According to Rosalind, the staff at Komoco would pay using\n\ncoupons while non-staff had to pay in cash. She would collect the coupons, compile them,\n\nput up a claim and pass them to the accounts department of Komoco so that they could make\n\na cheque payment to Yuen Catering. As for the cash, she would collect it and keep it until\n\nthe end of every month, before doing up the accounts and statements and passing the cash\n\nto the appellant. The $800 she collected every month from the Muslim stall at the canteen\n\nfor use of premises and cleaning services would be put in monthly accounts and given to\n\nthe appellant. Subsequently, the handling of accounts was taken over by the appellant.10.    On the day that Farouk approached her for a job, she had\n\nasked him whether he knew what he was supposed to do in the job. When she asked him for\n\nhis IC and he replied that he was not a local, she went to look for the appellant who\n\nlater interviewed him. After the interview, she was informed by the appellant that Farouk\n\nwould be hired. Rosalind could not recall whether Farouk showed her any documents on the\n\nday he reported for work. Nevertheless, she recalled that she had seen a photocopied work\n\npermit sometime in October 2000. At that time, the appellant wanted her to check on\n\nFarouk’s work permit. Rosalind took down particulars and asked for his agent’s\n\ntelephone number. She tried calling his agent several times but to no avail. Before she\n\ncould follow up on the matter, Farouk was arrested on 19 October 2000.11.    Mr Teo confirmed that, as far as the company was concerned,\n\nthe operator of the canteen was the appellant. He would deal with the appellant if there\n\nwere complaints about food quality and service. In the early stages of the canteen’s\n\noperations, he would go there regularly to see if everything was in order. The appellant\n\nintroduced him to Rosalind and told him that Rosalind was to be in charge if she was not\n\naround. Fortunately, the appellant was around most of the time. As operations went on, he\n\nchecked with the appellant as to how the canteen was doing as he did not want them to be\n\nout of pocket. When the appellant informed him that a lot of staff were not using the\n\ncanteen, he and the appellant decided to give food coupons to the staff to encourage them\n\nto eat at the canteen. Payments were to be made out by cheque by Komoco to Yuen Catering\n\nin exchange for the coupons.12.    Two other prosecution witnesses were the officers from the\n\nMinistry of Manpower who arrested Farouk, Mr Chang Kwee Huan (\"Mr Chang\") and Mr\n\nLaw Boon Seng (\"Mr Law\"). On the day of the arrest, when the two officers were\n\nat the canteen, Farouk had identified the appellant as his boss. When they asked for the\n\nowner/operator of the canteen, the appellant stepped forward and identified herself as\n\nsuch. When asked whether Farouk was her worker, she replied that he was. Mr Chang rejected\n\nthe suggestion that they had asked merely for a representative of Yuen Catering. Mr Law\n\ncould not recall whether the phrase ‘licensed operator’ was used that day but\n\nrecalled clearly that he had used either the term ‘owner’ or\n\n‘operator’. Upon the officers’ request to see the particulars of Farouk,\n\nthe appellant had instructed Rosalind to get the relevant clear folder for the\n\ninformation.13.    The prosecution also relied on two statements of the\n\nappellant recorded by Sgt Chua Ban Kheng (\"Sgt Chua\"). The first was a long\n\nstatement recorded on 23 October 2000 and 21 February 2001 pursuant to s121 of the\n\nCriminal Procedure Code. In the statement, the appellant acknowledged herself to be the\n\n\"assigned operator\" of the canteen and that she had employed Rosalind as her\n\ncanteen manager and Farouk as her cleaner. Her cautioned statement recorded on 21 March\n\n2001 read as follows :I am sorry for committing the offence. I should have check the worker\n\n  myself than to rely on my assistance to do it. I know that I was wrong and hope for\n\n  leniency.",
        "The defence": "14.    The defence’s arguments were mainly that the prosecution had\n\nfailed to discharge its burden of proof in respect of the charge and, secondly, that the\n\nappellant was not the owner of the canteen but Rosalind was. The first argument arose as a\n\nresult of Farouk giving evidence at the trial that he had entered into Singapore legally\n\nwith a passport and a pass although he could not remember how many days were given to him\n\nin the pass. The defence alleged that, as a result of Farouk’s testimony, the charge\n\nthat the appellant employed a person who had entered into Singapore without being in\n\npossession of a valid pass had no underlying or supporting factual basis.15.    The appellant gave evidence that she was not really interested in\n\nrunning the canteen when approached by Mr Teo as she was not in good health. She had\n\nalways been very close to Rosalind and treated her like a daughter. When she met Rosalind\n\nby chance in 1998 and was told that she was unhappy working at the hotel, she wanted to\n\nhelp Rosalind out by getting her started in the canteen business. She herself would only\n\nbe in charge of getting the licence since Rosalind could not obtain a licence on her own.\n\nIn the first few months, she would go to the canteen once or twice a week so that she\n\ncould see that the canteen was clean and that there would not be any complaints about her\n\nlicence with the Ministry of Environment. She did not get any part of the takings in those\n\nmonths. Subsequently, when Rosalind could not find a suitable cook to replace the previous\n\none, the appellant stepped in as their cook and agreed to a salary of $2000 offered by\n\nRosalind. Subsequently Rosalind offered 50% of the takings of the canteen to Yuen\n\nCatering. The appellant’s role was mainly that of the cook and, as the cook, she\n\nwould list the supplies needed for the next day so that Rosalind could order them.\n\nRosalind, on the other hand, took care of everything else such as finances, staff, and\n\nsupplies. Some of the invoices of the suppliers were in fact addressed to Rosalind. When\n\ncheques from Komoco were banked in by the appellant, she would give Rosalind the money\n\nminus any deductions required for CPF contributions, licence fee and anything else to be\n\npaid by Yuen Catering. Rosalind would consult the appellant on various matters such as\n\nwhether the salaries for the workers were suitable. This was because, as the appellant had\n\nher own restaurant, she would be familiar with the market rates. Other than coming out of\n\nthe kitchen occasionally to view the suitability of a cook in terms of cooking skills and\n\nhow well he could get along with her, the appellant was not involved with any interviews\n\nconducted by Rosalind. Mr Teo’s constant liaison on matters of the canteen with the\n\nappellant was caused by his impression of her as the person running the canteen.16.    The advertisement for a cleaner was not put up at the\n\nappellant’s direction. Rather, it was a suggestion from her when Rosalind ran into\n\ndifficulty in getting a kitchen helper verbally. The appellant insisted that she was not\n\naround on the day that Farouk was interviewed. She first saw him only on the first day\n\nthat he reported to work. Rosalind had mentioned that a new kitchen helper was coming and,\n\nsince the appellant was the only one around that early in the morning when he came, he\n\nasked her for instructions as to what to do. When Rosalind arrived to work later that\n\nmorning, the appellant mentioned to her \"Bangledeshi eh? Got work permit or\n\nnot?\". Rosalind then showed her a green-coloured card with Farouk’s photo. The\n\nappellant cautioned Rosalind to check on the green card. Rosalind would normally check the\n\nidentity cards of Singaporeans who came to ask for work. The appellant left it to Rosalind\n\nto conduct the checks. Apart from working as a cook, the appellant was not concerned with\n\nother aspects of the canteen and would usually leave the canteen between 12 – 1 pm as\n\nshe was needed at her own restaurant along Upper East Cosat Road as a nonya cook.17.    On the day of Farouk’s arrest, the appellant was in the\n\nkitchen. She came out upon being asked by one of the Komoco staff. The officers asked who\n\nwas the licensed operator and the appellant replied that it was her. She recalled that\n\nFarouk pointed her out as the boss but could not remember much else as she was feeling\n\nvery disturbed.18.    As for the police statements, the appellant maintained that there\n\nwere many inaccuracies. She had highlighted the portions which were inaccurate to the\n\ncourt below. The appellant’s explanation for the inaccuracies was that she had wanted\n\nto help Rosalind. Rosalind was very worried and had pleaded with the appellant not to get\n\nher into trouble. The appellant had thought that the punishment for the offence would only\n\nbe a fine and, as such, she would be in a better position to own up to the offence and\n\njust pay the fine. It was only after speaking to a lawyer that she discovered the severity\n\nof the offence and she wanted the truth to be out.19.    The rest of the defence witnesses called were Margaret and Jamal.\n\nMargaret bore witness that she was introduced to Rosalind by the appellant. The appellant\n\nhad also informed her that Rosalind would be the one who would be running the daily\n\naffairs of the canteen. Even though she did not know the exact relationship between the\n\nappellant and Rosalind, her impression was that, at the very least, Rosalind was a partner\n\nwho could decide on operational matters. Rosalind was the contact person to her, which was\n\nwhy she dealt with Rosalind personally on a number of matters, such as the prices and\n\nformat of staff coupons and the occasional tea arrangements to cater for finger food,\n\ncoffee and tea. As for Jamal, he testified that he considered Rosalind his boss and the\n\nappellant as his colleague. Rosalind was the one who gave him his salary and granted his\n\nsalary advances. When he first came looking for a job, it was Rosalind who interviewed\n\nhim. During the interview, he had asked for a higher salary and Rosalind went somewhere\n\nelse first before coming back and agreeing to the higher salary that he had asked for.",
        "The decision below": "20.    The prosecution had sought to admit the cautioned statement\n\nof the appellant to cross-examine her on inconsistencies in the statement with her\n\nevidence in court. Based on certain allegations made by the appellant against Sgt Chua\n\nregarding the recording of the cautioned statement, such as Sgt Chua not having explained\n\nthe punishment provision to her and telling her that she would get a jail sentence if she\n\ndid not sign the statement, the district judge ordered a voir dire to determine its\n\nadmissibility. At the end of the voir dire, the statement was admitted as the district\n\njudge was satisfied as to the voluntariness of the statement.21.    Farouk had already been convicted of a charge under s 6(1)(c)\n\nof the Act for illegal entry into Singapore. In the district judge’s view, even\n\nthough Farouk stated during the trial that he had entered Singapore with a Bangladeshi\n\npassport, there was no evidence that the passport actually belonged to him, was valid and\n\nconsequently a valid pass was issued to him. Doubt could not be thrown on his conviction\n\nas he did not even know the length of the alleged pass issued to him, and no longer\n\npossessed his passport. As such, it was held that his conviction stood as proof beyond\n\nreasonable doubt of his immigration status at that time.22.    At the conclusion of the trial, the district judge was\n\nconvinced that the evidence showed that it was the appellant who controlled the business\n\nand that Rosalind was an employee of Yuen Catering, despite the profit sharing\n\narrangement. The appellant was the one who was offered the opportunity to operate the\n\ncanteen by Mr Teo. Then Yuen Catering obtained the licence for the canteen and cheques\n\nwere made out monthly by Komoco to Yuen Catering. The appellant was at the canteen for\n\nsubstantial periods of time each day and her advice and approval were sought on matters\n\nrelating to the canteen. The district judge found it unbelievable that the appellant who\n\nwas more experienced in doing business, certainly more so than Rosalind, would allow Yuen\n\nCatering to be used solely in name only, without any agreement as to the returns and\n\nwithout any control over the business at all. The evidence of Margaret and Jamal was also\n\ndismissed by the district judge as not going very far to support the appellant's version\n\nof the facts but only showing that Rosalind was very much involved in the operations of\n\nthe canteen, a point which was not in dispute.23.    In holding that the control over Farouk clearly constituted\n\nemployment by the appellant within the meaning of the Act, the district judge accepted the\n\nevidence of the two main prosecution witnesses, namely Farouk and Rosalind that it was the\n\nappellant who interviewed Farouk, decided to hire him, briefed him about his duties and\n\ndecided the amount of his salary. The appellant was also the one who gave Farouk\n\ninstructions and orders about his work.24.    The district judge found supporting evidence for holding that\n\nthe appellant was the employer of Farouk in the appellant’s statements to the police\n\nand in her reaction when confronted by Mr Chang and Mr Law on the day of Farouk's arrest.\n\nThe district judge disbelieved that the appellant had all along thought that the\n\npunishment was merely a fine since the punishment provision was set out after the charge,\n\nand the appellant was able to read it. There was also much publicity in the local media\n\nregarding the severity of employing illegal immigrants and the appellant could not have\n\nbeen oblivious to it, considering that she was experienced in doing business. Furthermore,\n\nif she had indeed thought all along that only a mere fine would be imposed, she could have\n\noffered simply to pay the fine for Rosalind, instead of adopting such a convoluted manner\n\nof 'confessing' and lying to the police about her committing the offence.25.    When Mr Chang and Mr Law had asked who was the owner/operator,\n\nshe had stepped forward and identified herself as the owner/operator, even though Rosalind\n\nwas present. The district judge did not believe that the appellant had only stepped\n\nforward upon hearing the term 'licensed operator'. First, it would be strange for the\n\nofficers to use such an 'unwieldy' term as ‘licensed operator’ and, secondly, it\n\nwas indeed surprising that the appellant could remember this term so clearly, especially\n\nsince she could not give a clear account of the events and provided an unsatisfactory\n\nexplanation that she was confused. When asked for Farouk's details, she had instructed\n\nRosalind to retrieve a clear folder containing the information, showing that she had\n\nauthority over Rosalind.26.    The appellant had conceded that she knew that a foreigner's\n\nstatus in Singapore must be legal before he could be employed. The district judge\n\nconcluded that this meant that the appellant knew that she must be careful about Farouk's\n\nimmigration status as he was clearly a foreigner. She should have been put on the alert as\n\nto why Farouk should need to seek alternative employment with the work permit. Yet, at all\n\ntimes, there was a photocopied work permit that the appellant could have seen, and it did\n\nnot even bear the name of 'Farouk'. The district judge was of the view that, at the very\n\nleast, there were reasonable grounds for the appellant to believe that Farouk was an\n\nimmigration offender. The appellant should have asked for an original work permit,\n\npassport or any other original documents, quite apart from knowing about or seeing a\n\nphotocopied work permit. Even if the appellant’s claim that she had seen the original\n\nwork permit could be accepted, the district judge held that the appellant’s evidence\n\nstill fell far short of what was required to mount a successful defence in law.",
        "The appeal": "27.    Before me, counsel for the appellant raised broadly two\n\ngrounds of appeal : first, the district judge had erred in not appreciating that the\n\nprosecution had failed to prove an essential ingredient of the charge, namely, that Farouk\n\nhad entered into Singapore without being in possession of a valid pass and, secondly,\n\nbased on the evidence, the district judge was wrong to find that the appellant was the\n\nowner of the canteen and the employer of Farouk.",
        "Whether the prosecution had discharged its burden of proof with respect to an essential\n\ningredient of the charge": "28.    The appellant was charged with employing a person who had\n\nentered Singapore without being in possession of a valid pass in contravention of s\n\n6(1)(c) of the Act. The main thrust of the appellant’s argument was that since\n\nFarouk, a prosecution witness himself, had given evidence at the trial below that he in\n\nfact entered Singapore legally through Changi Airport with a Bangladeshi passport and a\n\nsocial visit pass, the charge against the appellant was not made out by the prosecution.\n\nThe district judge was wrong, to prefer, without more, the prosecution’s reliance on\n\nthe mere fact of Farouk’s conviction in an earlier and separate proceeding.29.    With respect, I am unable to agree with counsel for the\n\nappellant. It is pertinent to note that, even though Farouk had mentioned that he entered\n\nSingapore with a Bangladeshi passport, there was no further elaboration other than he\n\ncould not remember the length of his pass. There was no evidence that the passport and the\n\npass were actually valid and belonged to Farouk. In the absence of such evidence, the\n\ndistrict judge was entitled to draw the appropriate inferences that he had entered into\n\nSingapore illegally, having regard to other evidence available to her, namely his\n\nconviction and the fact that he was found withoutanyvalid documents whatsoever in\n\nhis possession on the day of his arrest. Besides, there is no rule of law which requires\n\nthe testimony of a witness to be believed in itsentiretyor not at all :Jimina\n\nJacee d/o CA Athananasius v PP[2001] 1 SLR 205 andSundara Moorthy Lankatharan v\n\nPP[1997] 3 SLR 464. The district judge was clearly entitled, for good and cogent\n\nreasons, to reject this part of Farouk’s testimony that he had entered Singapore\n\nlegally, while accepting the rest of his evidence. I should add that Farouk’s bare\n\nassertion of a legal entry into Singapore should not be allowed to override his\n\nconviction, as this would be tantamount to bringing a proper conviction by a court of law\n\ninto question as being wrong and bad in law through the back door. Since the district\n\njudge’s finding that Farouk had entered Singapore illegally was not against the\n\nweight of evidence and had been correctly arrived at, I am not minded to interfere with\n\nsuch a finding.",
        "Whether the appellant was the owner of the canteen and the employer of Farouk": "30.    It was contended by counsel for the appellant that the\n\noverall evidence pointed towards Rosalind as the owner of the canteen instead of the\n\nappellant. The district judge had not given due consideration to the explanations of the\n\nappellant regarding her role in the canteen and her police statements. Challenges were\n\nalso made to the district judge’s assessment of the credibility of the two main\n\nprosecution witnesses, Farouk and Rosalind. It was argued that the district judge was\n\nwrong to accept their evidence that it was the appellant who employed Farouk as there were\n\nmaterial inconsistencies in their testimony. It was further argued that the district judge\n\nwas wrong in not placing sufficient weight on a testimonial bearing out the\n\nappellant’s good character.31.    It is trite law that an appellate court will generally be\n\nreluctant to overturn a trial judge’s findings of fact unless they are clearly\n\nreached against the weight of the evidence as the trial judge has the benefit of seeing\n\nand hearing the witnesses in court:Cheong Choon Bin v PP[2001] 4 SLR 190,PP v\n\nNg Ai Tiong[2000] 1 SLR 454andLim Ah Poh v PP[1992] 1 SLR 713. I see no\n\nreason to overturn the assessment by the district judge as to the credibility of either\n\nthe two main prosecution witnesses or the appellant.32.    First, in this case, the district judge had, under the heading\n\n\"Credibility\" in her grounds of decision, stated carefully her assessment of the\n\nwitnesses in court. The district judge found Rosalind to be honest and forthright, even\n\nthough it could not have been easy for her to testify against the appellant, who was a\n\nmentor and friend. As for Farouk, he did not deny that Roslind paid him his salary, gave\n\nhim advances and instructed him from time to time. He had already served his sentence and\n\nhad no reason to frame the appellant rather than Rosalind. The district judge found him to\n\nbe a reliable witness. On the other hand, although the district judge appreciated that the\n\nappellant was generally of good character and was willing to help her friends, the\n\nappellant was found to be an unreliable witness in her feeble attempts to dissociate\n\nherself entirely from the canteen and to shift the blame on Rosalind.33.    Secondly, as for the alleged material inconsistencies in\n\nFarouk’s and Rosalind’s testimony which were highlighted to me, I am of the view\n\nthat the district judge had put her mind to the inconsistencies and had rightly satisfied\n\nherself that the inconsistencies did not affect the credibility of either witness. As for\n\nthe sighting of the work permit, it was Farouk’s testimony that he showed the\n\nphotocopied work permit to Rosalind on the first day of work while Rosalind only recalled\n\nseeing the work permit in October 2000 shortly before his arrest. The district judge\n\naccepted that Rosalind could have been mistaken about two similar incidents, considering\n\nthat the interview took place almost two years before the trial. In fact, the district\n\njudge was of the view that such a discrepancy showed that the witnesses did not collude in\n\nany way to frame the appellant. I might add that the corroboration of the two prosecution\n\nwitnesses that there was at all times only a photocopied work permit made them out to be\n\nmore reliable witnesses than the appellant whose insistence on seeing a green-coloured\n\nwork permit was not in accordance with the objective facts and which, to me, was but a\n\nfeeble attempt to bolster her defence. It was most unlikely that Farouk would not have\n\nhanded over the green-coloured work permit to the officers from the Ministry of Manpower,\n\nif there was indeed such a work permit in his possession. As it was, he had stated that he\n\nwas never in possession of such a green-coloured work permit and all that he had was the\n\nphotocopied work permit bearing the name ‘Islam Abdul Hai’.34.    Besides challenging the credibility of the prosecution witnesses,\n\nthe appellant was able to produce an impressive testimonial of good character from a very\n\ndistinguished and highly respected senior civil servant, who had known her for 40 years,\n\nstating that it was totally out of character for the appellant to have done anything\n\nillegal. Counsel for the appellant contended that the district judge had erred in not\n\nplacing adequate weight on the testimonial and cited the case ofTsang Kai Mong Elke v\n\nPublic Prosecutor[1994] 1 SLR 651in support of the principle that evidence of good\n\ncharacter is generally relevant to the credibility of an appellant as a witness. While I\n\ndid not doubt that the appellant was generally of good character, she had been less than\n\ntruthful and forthright with respect to a number of matters such as the alleged\n\ngreen-coloured work permit and her statements to the police. As such, the evidence of good\n\ncharacter was rendered of little assistance to the appellant in this case. I was of the\n\nview that the district judge, in assessing the credibility of the appellant, was correct\n\nin attaching little or no weight to the testimonial, so far as her credibility was\n\nconcerned.35.    After having examined the evidence, I am of the view that there\n\nis also no reason to overturn the district judge’s finding that the appellant was the\n\nowner of the canteen who had employed Farouk as it had not been reached against the weight\n\nof the evidence.36.    In my opinion, the appellant's version of the story that she was\n\nin poor health and did not want to run the canteen nor have anything to do with it did not\n\naccord with the actual circumstances. The licence for the canteen was obtained by the\n\nappellant in Yuen Catering's name. In the first few months, the appellant was also at the\n\ncanteen, sometimes once or twice a week. I am not inclined to believe that this was\n\nbecause the appellant had merely wanted to see that the canteen business got off to a\n\nright start for Rosalind and that there would not be any complaints about the licence over\n\ncleanliness. The actual fact remained that the appellant did not relinquish control over\n\nthe canteen business. When there were complaints about the quality of the food, the\n\nappellant herself decided to take over as cook at the canteen. Mr Teo had given testimony\n\nthat it was the appellant that he was liasing with on matters pertaining to the canteen.\n\nWhen Mr Teo was informed by the appellant that the staff were not patronizing the canteen,\n\nboth of them came up with the idea of using coupons to encourage the staff to eat at the\n\ncanteen. Both Rosalind and Farouk had to take instructions from the appellant and the\n\nappellant's approval was sought on many matters from the amount of salaries to be paid\n\nright to who could be the meat and vegetable suppliers for the canteen.37.    There was also objective evidence of Rosalind receiving CPF\n\ncontributions from Yuen Catering and cheques being made out by Komoco to Yuen Catering. No\n\nsatisfactory explanation was given as to why the cheques were made out to Yuen Catering\n\ninstead of Rosalind if indeed Rosalind was the owner of the canteen business as the\n\nappellant claimed. The control that the appellant had over Rosalind was obvious from the\n\nevidence of Mr Chang and Mr Law in that the appellant stepped forward and acknowledged\n\nherself as the owner of the canteen, even in the presence of Rosalind. When asked for\n\nFarouk's particulars, the appellant had ordered Rosalind to retrieve the relevant folder.38.    Even though Margaret gave evidence that the appellant had told\n\nher that Rosalind was running the daily affairs of the canteen, she confirmed that she was\n\nnot told further of the appellant having nothing to do with the operations. Her impression\n\nwas that Rosalind was at least a partner in the operations. As with the district judge, I\n\nfind that Margaret's testimony did no more than to confirm that Rosalind was at the\n\ncanteen, managing the day to day affairs of the canteen, a role which was undisputed and\n\nin accordance with Farouk's consideration of Rosalind as the manager of the canteen. As\n\nfor Jamal, his consideration of Rosalind as his boss and of the appellant as his colleague\n\ncould be caused by the impression that the appellant was working alongside him in the\n\nkitchen, while Rosalind was manning the cash counter and paying out the salaries. In any\n\ncase, his evidence that Rosalind had gone off somewhere before returning and agreeing to\n\nhis request for a higher salary corroborated Rosalind's testimony that she had gone to ask\n\nthe appellant for approval to pay the higher salary. The handing out of salaries and the\n\ngranting of salary advances were consistent with Rosalind’s role as a manager while\n\nit was the appellant as the overall person in charge who approved the amounts of salaries\n\nto be paid.39.    As for the appellant's explanations for her categorical\n\nassertions in the police statements that she was the owner of the canteen and that Farouk\n\nwas a cleaner who had been employed by her, counsel for the appellant urged me to consider\n\nand construe them in their proper perspective. While I appreciated the fact that Rosalind\n\nhad spoken to the appellant and conveyed her worries about getting into trouble, I am\n\nunable to believe that the appellant, in stating that she was the employer of Farouk, was\n\nmotivated by her desire to help Rosalind. The statements given to the police were not\n\nentirely incriminatory and there were some portions which appeared to be implicating\n\nRosalind in the offence, therefore such an explanation could not hold any water. As for\n\nthe appellant’s alleged mistaken impression that the offence merely involved a fine,\n\nI find that to be even more unbelievable. Farouk was arrested on 19 October 2000. The\n\nappellant's statements were recorded at three different times over a period of about five\n\nmonths. It is unthinkable that in this period of over five months, the appellant did not\n\neven bother to find out what might be the consequences for employing illegal immigrants.\n\nIn any event, as the district judge stated, and I agree, the problem of illegal immigrants\n\nhas attracted widespread publicity in the local media and the appellant who had been\n\noperating her own business for quite a number of years could not have been ignorant about\n\nthe severity of the offence. An examination of the charge would also reveal that the\n\nappellant had put her signatures above as well as below the provisions setting out the\n\npunishment in bold. The appellant should have been able to read the provisions for\n\nherself. In any case, Sgt Chua gave evidence in court that he had explained the punishment\n\nprovisions to her. And yet all that the appellant could say in her cautioned statement was\n\nthat she was sorry for committing the offence and that she knew she was wrong and hoped\n\nfor leniency.40.    As the employer of Farouk, it is beyond doubt that the appellant\n\nfell far short of the standard of due diligence required by ss 57(9) and (10) of the Act\n\nwhich provide as follows :-(9)In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (1) (d) or (e), it shall not be a\n\n  defence for the defendant to prove that the person harboured or employed by him was in\n\n  possession of a pass or permit issued to the person under this Act or the regulations\n\n  unless the defendant further proves that he had exercised due diligence to ascertain that\n\n  the pass or permit was at the material time valid under this Act or the regulations.(10) For the purposes of subsection (9) —(a) a defendant who is charged with an offence under subsection (1)(d)\n\n  shall not be deemed to have exercised due diligence unless the defendant —(i) requires the person harboured by him to produce for his inspection\n\n    the original copy of the pass or permit or, where the pass or permit is endorsed on the\n\n    passport or travel document, that person\"s passport or other travel document;(ii) checks the pass or permit to ascertain that the particulars on the\n\n    passport of the person harboured by him materially correspond with the particulars set out\n\n    in the pass or permit; and(iii) where the name of the employer of the person harboured by him is\n\n    specified in the pass or permit, checks with the employer to verify that the person is\n\n    employed by the employer and that the particulars of that person correspond with the\n\n    records of the employer;(b)    a defendant who is charged with an offence under subsection\n\n  (1)(e) shall not be deemed to have exercised due diligence unless the defendant —(i) requires the person employed by him to produce for his inspection\n\n    the original copy of the pass or permit or, where the pass or permit is endorsed on the\n\n    passport or travel document, that person\"s passport or other travel document;(ii) checks the pass or permit to ascertain that the particulars on the\n\n    passport of the person employed by him materially correspond with the particulars set out\n\n    in the pass or permit; and(iii) where the person employed by him is a holder of a visit pass, has\n\n    reasonable grounds for believing that the person had, at the material time, in force a\n\n    work permit issued under the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A) or had obtained\n\n    the written consent of the Controller to work in Singapore.41.    Farouk had told the appellant that he had a work permit but she\n\nhad never even asked to see it once. If the appellant had viewed the photocopied work\n\npermit, she would have realised that the work permit bore the name of ‘Islam Abdul\n\nHai’ instead and that the holder of the work permit was permitted to work only as a\n\nconstruction worker. On one hand, she conceded that she knew that a foreigner’s\n\nstatus must be legal before he could be employed and, on the other hand, she did not\n\nbother at all to perform the necessary checks on his immigration status by asking for\n\noriginal documents and verifying particulars. Even if she had relied on Rosalind to\n\nperform the checks for her, this would not exonerate her of any liability because the duty\n\nimposed by the Act on an employer to exercise due diligence to ensure that his employee is\n\nnot an illegal worker is a non-delegable responsibility :Cheong Choon Bin v PP[2001] 4 SLR 190.",
        "Conclusion": "42 In my view, the case against the appellant was made out beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, having regard to the totality of the evidence. As for the sentence, the\n\ndistrict judge, in imposing a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment, took into account\n\nthe impressive testimonial of the appellant’s good character but had to be mindful of\n\nthe current robust sentencing approach to cases under s 57(1)(e) of the Act. I do not\n\nthink that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, having regard to the tariff\n\nsentence usually imposed in cases of this nature, even for a first offender. Accordingly,\n\nI dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction and sentence.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
