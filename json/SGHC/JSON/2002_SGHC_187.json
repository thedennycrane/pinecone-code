        "Held": ", allowing the application:(1) The power of the subordinate courts to\n\n  alter judgments, including sentences, is governed by s 217 of the CPC. While s 217(1) lays\n\n  down a general prohibition against alteration of judgments by the subordinate courts, s\n\n  217(2) provides that clerical errors may be rectified at any time and ‘any other\n\n  mistake’ may be rectified before the court rises for the day. In the present case,\n\n  there was no clerical error or other mistake in the original judgment. Therefore the\n\n  district judge had no power to alter the original sentence of caning (see 6-7).(2) The revisionary powers of the High\n\n  Court are conferred by s 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Ed) and\n\n  s 268 of the CPC. It is established law that such powers of revision must be exercised\n\n  sparingly (see 11);Ang Poh Chuan v PP[1996] 1 SLR 326followed.(3) There was sufficient injustice to\n\n  warrant the exercise of the court’s revisionary powers as the district judge had\n\n  exceeded his powers in amending the original sentence. In addition, serious injustice\n\n  stemmed from the fact that the amended sentence was not commensurate with the culpability\n\n  of the respondent and violated the principle of parity. The respondent had received a\n\n  sentence which was considerably lighter than that given to two of his accomplices even\n\n  though all three were charged under s 148 of the PC (see 12-18).(4) Section 231 of the CPC prohibits the\n\n  execution of a sentence of caning in instalments. An order that the further three strokes\n\n  be given to the respondent would be tantamount to the infliction of caning in instalments,\n\n  since the respondent had already received the first three strokes and would necessarily\n\n  have had to take the additional three strokes on a second occasion. Such an order would be\n\n  contrary to s 231 of the CPC (see 25-31).(5) The court ordered that the original\n\n  sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane be reinstated, but\n\n  that the further three strokes not be inflicted (see 34).Case(s) referred toChiaw Wai Onn v PP[1997] 3 SLR 445(refd)Ang Poh Chuan v PP[1996] 1 SLR 326(folld)Akalu Ahir v Ramdeo Ram AIR1973 A 2145 (refd)PP v Nyu Tiong Lam[1996] 1 SLR 273(refd)Liow Eng Giap v PP[1971] 1 MLJ 10(refd)PP v Ramlee and another action[1998] 3 SLR 539(refd)Liaw Kwai Wah & Anor v PP[1987] 2 MLJ 69(refd)Legislation referred toCriminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) s 217,\n\n231, 256(b)(iii), 268Criminal Procedure Code (FMS Cap 6) [Mal] s 289Penal Code (Cap 224) s 147, 148, 149Prisons Act (Cap 247) s 77(1)Prisons Regulations (Cap 247, R 2) reg 98(3)Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) s 23JudgmentGROUNDS OF\n\nDECISIONBackgroundThis was an application for\n\ncriminal revision at the instance of a district judge. The respondent pleaded guilty\n\nbefore the district judge on 11 April 2002 to an amended charge of rioting with a deadly\n\nweapon, to wit, a hammer and a knife, whilst being a member of an unlawful assembly whose\n\ncommon object was to cause hurt, punishable under s 148 read with s 149 of the Penal Code\n\n(Cap 224) (the ‘PC’). On 9 May 2002, the district judge, applying the principle\n\nof parity of sentencing and taking into account the sentences passed on the\n\nrespondent’s accomplices by another court, sentenced the respondent to 30\n\nmonths’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.2        That evening, before the\n\ncourt had arisen for the day, the case was re-mentioned before the district judge. The\n\nprosecuting officer, the respondent and the respondent’s counsel were present before\n\nthe court. The DPP was not present. The respondent’s counsel informed the district\n\njudge that one of the respondent’s accomplices, Tan Teck Chye (‘Tan’), had\n\nreceived a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for the\n\nsame offence. The respondent’s counsel had obtained this information from a copy of\n\nthe schedule of accomplices’ sentences which the DPP had furnished him. It would\n\nappear that the district judge’s copy of the schedule indicated that Tan had been\n\nsentenced under a reduced charge, namely s 147 of the PC, as Tan’s original charge\n\nunder s 148 of the PC had been cancelled in some manner. However, no such cancellation was\n\nreflected on the respondent’s counsel’s copy.3        The respondent’s\n\ncounsel, taking the view that both the respondent and Tan had been charged under s 148 of\n\nthe PC, sought to have the respondent’s original sentence altered in order to achieve\n\nparity. Based on the representation that Tan had been sentenced under s 148 instead of s\n\n147 of the PC, the district judge reduced the respondent’s sentence of caning from\n\nsix strokes to three strokes.4        It later came to the\n\ndistrict judge’s attention that Tan had indeed been convicted under s 147 of the PC.\n\nOn 12 June 2002, the district judge applied to the High Court to exercise its powers of\n\nrevision pursuant to s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the ‘CPC’).\n\nThe district judge stated that he had had no power under the CPC to change the sentence of\n\ncaning once it had been pronounced. While s 217 of the CPC allows the subordinate courts\n\nto rectify mistakes that go beyond mere accidental slips and omissions before the court\n\nrises for the day, the district judge submitted that there was no mistake in the original\n\nsentence and he therefore had no power to alter the original sentence.The power to alter or review the original sentence5        The power of the\n\nsubordinate courts to alter judgments, including sentences, is governed by s 217 of the\n\nCPC, which reads:(1)    No court other than the High Court, when it has recorded its\n\n  judgment, shall alter or review the judgment.(2)    A clerical error may be rectified at any time and any other\n\n  mistake may be rectified at any time before the court rises for the day.6        InChiaw Wai Onn v PP[1997] 3 SLR 445, the High Court took the view that s 217(1) lays down a general prohibition\n\nagainst alteration of judgments by the subordinate courts. The High Court interpreted s\n\n217(2) as an excepting proviso to the prohibition in s 217(1), prescribing the limited\n\ncircumstances in which the subordinate courts can alter or review judgments.7        In the present case, it is\n\nclear that there was no ‘clerical error’ or ‘any other mistake’ in the\n\noriginal judgment. While the district judge had been led to believe that the respondent\n\nhad received a harsher sentence than Tan under s 148 of the PC, there was in fact, no\n\nmistake in the respondent’s original sentence as Tan had been charged under a reduced\n\ncharge, namely s 147 of the PC. Therefore, the district judge had no power to alter the\n\noriginal sentence of caning.Principles of revision8        The revisionary powers of\n\nthe High Court are conferred by s 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322,\n\n1999 Ed) and s 268 of the CPC.9        In particular, s 268(1) of\n\nthe CPC states:The High Court may in any case, the record of the\n\n  proceedings of which has been called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its\n\n  knowledge, in its discretion exercise any of the powers conferred by sections 251, 255,\n\n  256 and 257.10        Section 268(1) of the CPC\n\nprovides that the High Court, in exercising its powers of revision, can exercise powers\n\nsimilar to those of an appellate court. As the DPP submitted, the High Court, in the\n\nexercise of its powers of revision, has,inter alia, the power under s 256(b)(iii)\n\nto ‘alter the nature of the sentence’.11        It is established law that\n\nsuch powers of revision must be exercised sparingly. The principles governing revision\n\nwere laid down inAng Poh Chuan v PP[1996] 1 SLR 326, where it was held that:…various phrases may be used to identify the\n\n  circumstances which would attract the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, but they\n\n  all share the common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course\n\n  there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for\n\n  that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the\n\n  court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally\n\n  it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at\n\n  its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.12        I found that there was\n\nsufficient injustice in the present case to warrant the exercise of the court’s\n\nrevisionary powers for the following reasons.13        Firstly, the district\n\njudge had no power under s 217 of the CPC to alter the original sentence of caning. InAkalu\n\nAhir v Ramdeo RamAIR 1973 A 2145, Dua J, delivering the judgment of the Indian\n\nSupreme Court, said:Now adverting to the power of revision conferred on a\n\n  High Court…it is an extraordinary discretionary power vested in the superior court to\n\n  be exercised in aid of justice; in other words, to set right grave injustice. The High\n\n  Court has been vested with this power to see that justice is done in accordance with the\n\n  recognized rules of criminal jurisprudence and that the subordinate courts do not exceed\n\n  their jurisdiction or abuse the power conferred on them by law.14        I am of the opinion that\n\nit is precisely in a case such as this, where the subordinate court has amended a sentence\n\nin a manner which is contrary to law, that the Court should exercise its revisionary\n\njurisdiction. Indeed, the High Court has previously granted applications for criminal\n\nrevision where a judge exceeded his powers:PP v Nyu Tiong Lam[1996] 1 SLR 273.15        In addition, there was\n\nserious injustice as the amended sentence was not commensurate with the culpability of the\n\nrespondent and violated the principle of parity.16        The principle of parity is\n\nwell-established in local sentencing law. InLiow Eng Giap v PP[1971] 1 MLJ 10,\n\nChoor Singh J stated that, ‘where there are no differentiating factors…public\n\ninterest demands that there should be some consistency in the imposition of sentences on\n\naccused persons committing the same or similar offences.’ More recently, inPP v\n\nRamlee and another action[1998] 3 SLR 539, the High Court citedArchbold(1998), para 5-153, with approval, noting that ‘where two or more offenders are to be\n\nsentenced for participation in the same offence, the sentences passed on them should be\n\nthe same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility or their personal\n\ncircumstances.’17        In this case, the extent\n\nof the respondent’s involvement in the offence was similar to that of two other\n\naccomplices, Wu Jin Chang (‘Wu’) and Tan Guan Da (‘Guan’), both of\n\nwhom received sentences of 36 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.18        At the time of the\n\noffence, the respondent was 16 years old, Wu was 17 years old and Guan was 18 years old. I\n\nam of the opinion that the respondent’s amended sentence of 30 months’\n\nimprisonment and three strokes was inadequate, even when the disparity in ages of the\n\noffenders was taken into account. All three were charged under s 148 of the PC and were\n\ndirectly involved in assaulting the victims. The difference in sentences given to Wu and\n\nGuan on the one hand, and the respondent on the other, was sufficient cause for the court\n\nto exercise its revisionary powers. It was grossly unfair that the respondent was given a\n\nlighter sentence than Wu and Guan simply because there was confusion as to whether Tan was\n\ncharged under s 148 or s 147 of the PC.19        For these reasons, the\n\ncircumstances clearly justified the exercise of the High Court’s revisionary powers,\n\nwhich include the power under s 256(b)(iii) of the CPC to alter the nature of the\n\nsentence. The only question which remained related to the order the High Court should\n\nmake.What order should the Court make?20        The district judge applied\n\nto the High Court to set aside the amended sentence and reinstate the original sentence of\n\n30 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, or alternatively, to make any\n\nother order which is just and appropriate in the circumstances.21        Given the role played by\n\nthe respondent in the offence, I was of the opinion that the original sentence was an\n\nappropriate one, as it is in accordance with the principle of parity of sentencing. The\n\nmatter was, however, complicated by the fact that the amended sentence of three strokes of\n\nthe cane had already been carried out on 19 June 2002. In view of this, the DPP submitted\n\nthat the respondent could not be caned again, even if the criminal revision was allowed.22        It was therefore necessary\n\nto consider whether the High Court had the power to increase the number of strokes after\n\nthe sentence of caning imposed by the district court had already been executed. As this\n\nissue had not previously been considered in our courts, I took the opportunity to examine\n\nthe provisions relating to caning in the CPC, the Prisons Act (Cap 247) and the Prisons\n\nRegulations.23        Section 77(1) of the\n\nPrisons Act provides that:When any sentence of corporal punishment is passed under\n\n  this Act upon any prisoner, he shall not be liable to more than one such sentence in\n\n  respect of the act or acts, or omission or omissions, for which he has been sentenced.24        This provision, by itself,\n\ndoes not prevent the respondent from receiving a further three strokes of cane, as there\n\nhas not been more than one sentence in respect of his offence. Instead, the district judge\n\nwas applying to the High Court to have an amendment to the original sentence set aside and\n\nthe original sentence reinstated in its entirety. Indeed, if the sentence of caning had\n\nnot already been executed, there would have been no difficulty with reinstating the\n\noriginal sentence of six strokes.25        However, s 231 of the CPC\n\nprovides that ‘no sentence of caning shall be executed by instalments’. This has\n\nbeen interpreted inSentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts(2000) as\n\nprescribing that ‘the court is prohibited from ordering the sentence of caning to be\n\nexecuted by instalments’. If indeed the scope of s 231 is limited to court orders,\n\nthen s 231 would not prevent the respondent from receiving a further three strokes of the\n\ncane, as long as the court did not explicitly order the sentence to be carried out in\n\ninstalments. On this interpretation, even if I was minded to reinstate the\n\nrespondent’s sentence of six strokes, as long as I did not order that the additional\n\nthree strokes be given in instalments, the order would not contravene s 231 of the CPC.26        However, I took the view\n\nthat a broader interpretation of s 231 of the CPC should be adopted; the use of the word\n\n‘executed’ in the provision suggests that the section is concerned with the\n\nactual infliction of the caning, and not with the instructions of the court as to the\n\nnumber of occasions on which the caning should be effected.27        This interpretation is\n\nbuttressed by reg 98(3) of the Prisons Regulations which provides that:Corporal punishment shall not, except by special order\n\n  in cases of emergency, be inflicted within 24 hours of the sentence being awarded, nor\n\n  shall it be inflicted by instalments.28        The use of the term\n\n‘inflicted’ indicates that the objective of the enactment was to ensure that the\n\nexecution of caning not be delivered on more than one occasion in respect of the same\n\nsentence.29        An order that the further\n\nthree strokes be given to the respondent would be tantamount to the infliction of caning\n\nin instalments, since the respondent had already received the first three strokes and\n\nwould necessarily have had to take the additional three strokes on a second occasion. Such\n\nan order would be contrary to s 231 of the CPC and reg 98(3) of the Prisons Regulations.30        It is helpful to consider\n\nthe decision of the Malaysian Supreme Court (as it was then known) inLiaw Kwai Wah\n\n& Anor v PP[1987] 2 MLJ 69. In that case, the two applicants had pleaded guilty\n\nto the offence of armed robbery of a motor car and other articles. Both were sentenced to\n\ntwo years’ imprisonment and one stroke of the cane each. After the sentence of caning\n\nwas carried out, the High Court judge, acting in revision, enhanced the sentence of caning\n\non each applicant by four strokes. The applicants applied to the Supreme Court to\n\ndetermine,inter alia, whether the High Court had the power to enhance the sentence\n\nof caning after the sentence of caning imposed by the trial court had already been\n\nexecuted. The Supreme Court held that the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code (the\n\n‘Malaysian CPC’) prohibits caning to be executed in instalments and that\n\ntherefore, in the circumstances, it was improper for the judge to exercise his revisionary\n\npower to impose additional strokes of caning. While the Supreme Court did not specify\n\nexactly which provision in the Malaysian CPC prohibited caning, I was of the opinion that\n\nthe Supreme Court was probably referring to s 289 of the Malaysian CPC, which corresponds\n\nwith s 231 of the CPC (seeMallal’s Criminal Procedure, 5thed\n\n(1998)). Abdul Hamid CJ, delivering the judgment of the court, said:The Code clearly prohibits whipping to be executed in\n\n  instalments. Thus, by imposing additional strokes after a sentence of whipping by a lower\n\n  court had already been executed, it necessarily means that such strokes shall have to be\n\n  further executed. Indeed, the whipping shall have to be inflicted on two separate\n\n  occasions and therefore in two instalments. In such a case, it is clearly improper for a\n\n  Judge to exercise his revisionary power to impose additional strokes. He would under those\n\n  circumstances be acting contrary to law.31        I am of the opinion that\n\nthe approach adopted by the Malaysian Supreme Court is consistent with the spirit of s 231\n\nof the CPC. Because of the special nature of the punishment of caning, the courts in\n\nSingapore have rigorously observed the statutory safeguards relating to caning, such as\n\nthe maximum number of strokes which can be inflicted for different offences as well as the\n\nclasses of persons who cannot be caned, specifically females, males sentenced to death and\n\nmales whom the court considers to be more than 50 years of age. Similarly, the court\n\nshould observe the clear prohibition in s 231 of the CPC against the execution of caning\n\nin instalments.32        I wish to state that my\n\nholding in the present case should not be taken to restrict the power of future courts to\n\nenhance a sentence of caning once the sentence has been passed. Indeed, it must be noted\n\nthat my holding is strictly confined to situations where the caning has actually been\n\nexecuted. There are stringent procedural safeguards in the CPC to ensure that no caning is\n\ndone until the time period for appeals has expired. Thus, it will only be in extremely\n\nrare cases, where possible injustice is discovered after the time period for appeals has\n\nexpired and the caning has been carried out, where the court will be prevented from\n\nordering an enhancement of the sentence of caning. I was of the view that the possibility\n\nof injustice in these rare instances must be balanced against the need to uphold the\n\nprinciple embodied in statute that the execution of caning must be in line with the\n\nprovisions of the CPC and other statutory enactments.Conclusion33        I agreed with the\n\nDPP’s submissions that the respondent could not be caned again. In view of the\n\nprinciple of parity of sentencing, I was minded to sentence the respondent to an\n\nappropriate jail term in lieu of three strokes of the cane; this jail term would be in\n\naddition to the district judge’s sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment. Such an\n\norder would redress the injustice that has been caused by the alteration of the\n\nrespondent’s sentence, without falling foul of s 231 of the CPC.34        However, as the DPP did\n\nnot ask for this, and only applied to have the original sentence reinstated, I did not\n\nmake my order in those terms. Instead, I granted the application for criminal revision and\n\nordered that the original sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the\n\ncane be reinstated, but that the further three strokes be not inflicted.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
