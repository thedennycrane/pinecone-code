        "The financing of the Seng Hup acquisition": ".3.    To purchase the 8 million Seng Hup shares, RG needed considerable financial\n\nassistance. From a very early stage CEF (Capital Markets) Ltd, a merchant bank based in Hong Kong\n\n through Leong Siew Loon (\"Leong\"), the executive director of its Singapore subsidiary,\n\nCEF (Singapore) Ltd (referred to jointly as \"CEF\")  had expressed interest in financing\n\nthe purchase. It was RGs evidence that Leong had not only offered to finance the purchase but, in\n\naddition, had said that CEF would provide RG with professional advice in respect of the purchase.4.    CEF did not deny that it had, from the beginning, been interested in\n\nfinancing the acquisition but denied that it had offered to give professional advice to RG in\n\nrespect of the acquisition. In this regard, it was pointed out that Seng Hup was a Malaysian\n\nlisted company and CEF had no licence to operate as a merchant bank in Malaysia.5.    The total facilities that CEF undertook to procure for this transaction was\n\nUS$40 million. As there were internal constraints on CEF providing such a large sum of money, it was\n\nagreed that CEF would provide US$25 million as a term loan and, in respect of the balance of US$15\n\nmillion, would act as the facility agent to procure that loan.6.    It was agreed between RG and Sng that the purchase of the 8 million\n\nshares would be effected in two tranches. The first tranche of 4.3 million shares was to be crossed\n\nthrough the Stock Exchange at RM14.50 per share and the balance of 3.7 million shares would be\n\ncrossed thereafter at about RM9 per share thereby maintaining the agreed price of RM12 per share.\n\nCity Square Development Ltd (\"City Square\"), a British Virgin Islands (\"BVI\")\n\ncompany incorporated for that purpose, was the vehicle used to effect the purchase of the first\n\ntranche.7.    The crossing of the first tranche took place on 9 June 1997. To facilitate\n\nthe crossing CEF, on that day, issued a letter to Lum Chang Securities Pte Ltd (\"Lum\n\nChang\")  the stockbrokers used to effect the crossing  an undertaking that it would make\n\nfull payment for the shares by 27 June 1997. At the date of the crossing the formal documentation\n\nrelating to the loan and security to be provided had not been signed. The issue by Leong of the\n\nletter of undertaking, without first having the formal documentation executed, was somewhat unusual.\n\nLeongs explanation for this was that he had every confidence in RGs bona fides and accepted\n\nthe risk involved in issuing that letter of undertaking. The senior management of CEF, when\n\nquestioned, had reservations about the issue of that letter by Leong.8.    The formal documentation for the loan was signed by the parties on 26 July\n\n1997. Amongst the documents signed by RG and his nephew Danny Goh Teck Beng (\"DG\") on that\n\nday were their respective letters of guarantee. Amongst the documents executed on behalf of City\n\nSquare were an Agency Fee Letter Agreement and a Front-End Fee Letter Agreement.",
        "Problems with the financiers": ".9.    City Square failed to keep up with some of the payments that it was required\n\nto make to CEF under the Agreements signed on 26 June 1997. On 29 July 1997, CEF made a formal\n\nwritten demand for outstanding fees of US$328,938.20. City Square did not meet the demand. On 27\n\nAugust 1997, CEF drew attention to cl 17 of the Facility Agreement which stipulated that upon the\n\noccurrence of an event of default CEF could withdraw from its obligations to finance the purchase\n\nand cautioned City Square that failure to pay outstanding fees was an event of default. As City\n\nSquare did not effect payment, CEF, on 8 September 1997, informed City Square that it was cancelling\n\nall its commitments to City Square.10.    Faced with the difficulties he was having with CEF, RG had to secure some\n\nother method by which to finance the purchase of the second tranche of shares. Having purchased the\n\nfirst tranche at an inflated price of RM14.50 per share, it was important to RG, in order to achieve\n\nthe average price of RM12 per share, that the purchase of the second tranche was completed. Only\n\nthen would the price paid for the Seng Hup shares average out to RM12 per share. To purchase the\n\nsecond tranche, RG turned to one Andrew Quek (\"Andrew\")  a person very familiar with\n\nshare market operations  for assistance.",
        "The \"tango\"": ".11.    RGs arrangement with Andrew was for Andrew to purchase the remaining\n\nSeng Hup shares from Sng through Andrews trading account in a broking house and thereafter,\n\nwithin each settlement period, keep transferring the shares back and forth between different trading\n\naccounts. RG referred to this device as \"tango\". The idea was to keep on doing this until\n\nthe shares were paid for or otherwise disposed of. One of the other accounts into which the shares\n\nwere \"tangoed\" into was the account of one Wong Chin Yong (\"Wong\"), another\n\nperson highly conversant with share market operations. Using this device, RG obtained control of the\n\nsecond tranche of Seng Hup shares (at RM12 per share) on 10 September 1997.",
        "Trouble in Seng Hup: The AA Report": ".12.    Having obtained control of Seng Hup, RG appointed his nominees  amongst\n\nwhom were a prominent Malay politician and representatives from a firm called Credit Risk Management\n\n(\"CRM\")  to the Board of Seng Hup. The instrument appointing CRM was not produced but\n\nit would appear that CRMs brief included an investigation into the way Seng Hup had been managed.\n\nTowards that end, CRM, it would appear, began interviewing the employees of Seng Hup and soon after\n\nreported to RG that there had been mismanagement in Seng Hups finances. No one from CRM was,\n\nhowever, called to testify on all this. Nor did RG make disclosure (as he did in respect of AA) of\n\nany report that CRM may have made.13.    As a result of what CRM reported, Seng Hup appointed M/s Arthur Andersen\n\n(\"AA\"), a firm of public accountants in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), to conduct a position\n\naudit on Seng Hup. AA conducted such an audit and, in December 1997, produced a position report on\n\nthe financial affairs of Seng Hup as at 30 September 1997 (AA Report). Meanwhile (in common\n\nwith many other counters on the Malaysian Stock Exchange), the price of Seng Hup shares on the Stock\n\nExchange was in decline. The evidence also was that on 9 September 1999, Seng Hup was placed\n\nunder Dhanaharta.14.    It was RGs evidence that, from the later part of 1997, he began to\n\nrealise that he had been misled by Flora, Sng, Leong and CEF into buying the Seng Hup shares. It\n\nalso began to dawn on him, he said, that he had been the victim of a conspiracy amongst them to\n\ndefraud him. RG, however, did not take any immediate action against any of them for\n\nmisrepresentation or conspiracy.",
        "The writs": ".15.    The first person to take legal proceedings in connection with the purchase\n\nby RG of the Seng Hup shares was Flora. On 9 January 1998, Flora, in Suit No. 24/98, sued RG for her\n\n2% commission.16.    On 18 June 1998, CEF, by way of Suit No. 849/98, sued RG, DG, Grandlink\n\nGroup Pte Ltd and City Square (collectively referred to as \"the RG Group\") for,\n\ninter alia, the return of the US$25 million loan advanced to City Square.17.    On 3 June 1999, RG and City Square, in Suit No. 822/99, sued Sng for\n\nbreaches of warranties, misrepresentations and conspiracy (together with Flora, Leong and CEF) to\n\ndefraud RG in the acquisition of the Seng Hup shares. RG raised similar allegations of\n\nmisrepresentation and similar allegations of conspiracy to defraud by way of counterclaim against\n\nFlora, Sng, Leong and CEF in Suits No. 24/99 and 849/98.18.    With the declining fortune of Seng Hup, RG himself was facing increasing\n\nfinancial difficulties. The commencement of Suit No. 849/98 by CEF for the sum of US$25 million\n\nloaned to City Square did not help matters. In the course of this hearing, there was frequent\n\nmention of RGs impending bankruptcy by reason of his failure to settle his debts. The judgments\n\nentered against RG and the others referred to in paragraphs 27 and 34 below were precipitated by the\n\nimpending bankruptcy.19.    The hearing of the claims and counterclaims in these suits was protracted\n\n it was spread over 13 months and it took 61 trial days  and the documents produced in court\n\nwere voluminous. Five different sets of solicitors represented the various parties involved and the\n\ncross-examining of every witness was intensive and detailed.20.    As was to be expected in such protracted proceedings involving different\n\ninterests, there was considerable differences in the accounts given by the various witnesses. To add\n\nto that, in respect of some witnesses (and this applies particularly to RG, Eddie and Andrew), there\n\nwere considerable differences and contradictions even within their own evidence. Counsel for the\n\nparties have, in their closing submissions, highlighted many of these contradictions.21.    The evidence in support of the allegations of misrepresentation and\n\nconspiracy to defraud made against CEF, Leong, Flora and Sng (the alleged conspirators) came mainly\n\nfrom RG. As Mr Jimmy Yim, counsel for the RG Group, correctly stated in his closing submissions,\n\nwhether the court accepted those allegations or not would depend almost entirely on whether the\n\ncourt believed RG or the alleged conspirators.",
        "A.The claims against RG and his Group": ".",
        "(a)The claims by Flora (Suit No. 24/98)": ".22.    In Suit No. 24/98, Flora claimed from RG the sum of RM1,920,000 being the\n\n2% commission that RG had agreed to pay her for the purchase of the 8 million Seng Hup shares from\n\nSng. RG did not dispute that he had agreed to pay Flora a commission of 2% but alleged, first, that\n\nthe commission was for the purchase of 6.2 million and not 8 million Seng Hup shares and,\n\nsecond, that, in any event he (RG) had not purchased any Seng Hup shares from Sng and therefore no\n\ncommission whatsoever was payable to Flora. In making this denial in Suit No. 24/98, RG was, no\n\ndoubt, relying on the fact that as it was City Square, a BVI company, that had purchased the first\n\ntranche and as it was Andrew who had purchased the second tranche, Flora would have difficulty\n\ntracing these purchases to him.23.    In the Order 14 proceedings instituted in Suit No. 24/98, the Assistant\n\nRegistrar (\"AR\") rejected RGs claim that he had not purchased any shares from Sng and\n\ngave part-judgment against RG in the sum of RM1,032,000 being the 2% commission in respect of the\n\nfirst tranche of 4.3 million shares purchased through City Square. The AR granted RG unconditional\n\nleave to defend Floras claim for commission in respect of the second tranche of 3.7 million\n\nshares. Dissatisfied with that decision, RG appealed but the appeal was dismissed.",
        "The changing defences": ".24.    On 1 September 1998, RG amended his Defence. In his Amended Defence he\n\nadmitted that he had bought 4.3 million Seng Hup shares through City Square but continued to deny\n\nhaving bought the remaining 3.7 million shares. In this Amended Defence, RG counterclaimed against\n\nFlora for:(a) the sum of $384,383.74 being the brokerage fees of Lum Chang for the 4.3\n\n  million shares; and(b) the sum of RM10,750,000 being the additional amount incurred by him in\n\n  having purchased the 4.3 million shares from Sng at RM14.50 and not at the agreed price of RM12.It was significant that, even at this late stage  a period of almost a year\n\nsince RG (allegedly) began to realise that he had been defrauded by Sng, Flora, Leong and CEF \n\nRG, in the Amended Defence made no mention of any fraud.25.    Another 7 months later, on 23 April 1999, RG filed a Re-Amended Defence and\n\nCounterclaim. In this document, for the first time, RG alleged that he had purchased the 4.3 million\n\nSeng Hup shares (in the name of City Square) as a result of fraudulent and/or negligent\n\nrepresentations about the affairs of Seng Hup made by Flora. RG further alleged that Flora had\n\nfraudulently, in conspiracy with Sng, Leong and other persons unknown, induced him to purchase the\n\nsaid shares. Again, it was of significance that RG continued to deny having purchased the\n\nsecond tranche of 3.7 million shares.26.    It was only on 25 February 2000  the 4thday after this\n\nconsolidated hearing commenced  that RG, through Mr Yim, came round to admitting that he had in\n\nfact purchased the second tranche and that he had done so in the name of Andrew. Mr Andre Yeap,\n\ncounsel for CEF, submitted that this change of position came about because RG had, recently, been\n\ncompelled to disclose a considerable amount of documents relating to the purchase of Seng Hup shares\n\nand, in the light of those disclosures, it was no longer feasible for RG to continue denying that he\n\nhad purchased the second tranche.27.    On 26 May 2000, RG consented to judgment being entered against him for the\n\nsum of RM888,000 (being commission at 2% on the second tranche of 3.7 million shares). In view of\n\nthe counterclaims that RG had against Flora that were still being pursued, it was, by consent,\n\nagreed that the judgment against him was not to be enforced without leave of court.28.    The counterclaims made against Flora were similar to the\n\ncounterclaims/claims made against CEF, Leong and Sng in the other suits. I will therefore deal with\n\nthese allegations and the counterclaims against CEF and Leong in Suit No. 849/98 together when\n\nconsidering the claim against Sng in Suit No. 822/99.",
        "The brokerage fee to Lum Chang": ".29.    In addition to the claims of misrepresentation and conspiracy, RG had, in\n\nhis counterclaim, claimed reimbursement from Flora of the sum of RM384,383.74 being the brokerage\n\ncharges paid to Lum Chang. The basis of this claim was that the 2% commission agreed with Flora\n\nincluded brokerage fees.30.    Flora agreed that she had to absorb brokerage charges but claimed that this\n\nwould be so only if the transaction was put through Kenanga, the firm of brokers she worked for. It\n\nwas her case that since RG, without her consent (and even knowledge), had effected the sale through\n\nLum Chang, she was not liable to RG for Lum Changs brokerage charges.31.    This claim for brokerage refund is not connected with RGs other claims\n\nagainst Flora. I will therefore deal with this issue at this juncture. I found Floras evidence\n\nthat she would absorb the brokerage charges only if the transaction was put through the broking\n\nhouse she worked for entirely credible and accepted that those were the terms of the agreement\n\nreached with RG. I also accepted her evidence that from early June 1997 both RG and Sng kept her\n\nentirely in the dark as to the progress of the sale. I therefore rejected RGs claim for\n\nreimbursement of the brokerage fees paid to Lum Chang.",
        "(b)The claims by CEF (Suit No. 849/98)": ".32.    In this suit brought by CEF against members of the RG Group, the claim\n\nagainst City Square was for:(1) the sum of US$25 million and interest thereon amounting to US$1,200,463.19\n\n  as at 31 March 1998;(2) the unpaid balance of the Front-End Fee amounting to US$384,938.20 under\n\n  the Facility Agreement and/or the Front-End Fee Letter Agreement;(3) Agency Fee of US$20,000; and(4) Commitment Fee of US$11,562.10.The claims against RG and DG were based on the personal guarantees that each had\n\ngiven. The claim against Grandlink was in respect of a cheque for US$256,713.19, dated 17 January\n\n1998, issued by Grandlink in favour of CEF which when presented for payment was dishonoured.\n\nGrandlink was the company used by RG as a holding company for some of his property development\n\nbusinesses in Singapore.",
        "Forgery": ".33.    In their joint Defence, the RG Group alleged that the signature of one Yap\n\nYew Hock (\"Yap\") appearing on the Agency Fee and Front- End Fee Agreements, purportedly on\n\nbehalf of City Square, was not the signature of Yap but was a forgery. That being so City Square was\n\nnot liable for the Agency Fee and the Front-End Fee claimed. In respect of the US$25 million, it was\n\npleaded that City Square had not drawn down on this sum under the Facility Agreement but that CEF\n\nhad, without the authority of City Square, unilaterally paid the amount to Lum Chang pursuant to the\n\nwritten assurance given by CEF to Lum Chang on 9 June 1997. City Square was not therefore\n\nliable to repay the US$25 million.34.    I would, at this stage, point out that the RG Group made no effort to\n\nsubstantiate the serious allegations of forgery that they had made against CEF. Instead, on 22 May\n\n2000  the 23rdday of the trial  RG, City Square and Grandlink, through Mr Yim,\n\nadmitted the claims made by CEF and judgment was entered against them. As in the case of Suit\n\nNo. 24/98, in view of the on-going counterclaims, it was agreed that the judgment was not to be\n\nexecuted without leave.35.    The counterclaims in Suit No. 849/98 raised allegations of fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation, conspiracy and negligence against CEF and against Leong personally. As these\n\nissues overlapped similar issues raised as against Flora in Suit No. 24/98 and Sng in Suit No.\n\n822/99, I will, as indicated earlier, deal with them together.",
        "B.The claims/counterclaims by the RG Group": ".36.    In Suit No. 822/99, RG and City Square alleged that Sng had made\n\nfraudulent/negligent misrepresentations regarding the commercial viability of Seng Hup; that he had\n\nconspired with CEF, Leong and Flora to defraud RG and that he was in breach of the written\n\nwarranties contained in his letter dated 27 May 1997 (\"the letter of warranty\") addressed\n\nto RG.37.    In Suit No. 849/98, RG, by way of counterclaim, made similar allegations\n\nagainst Flora, Leong and CEF and sought damages. As against Leong and CEF, RG also made a\n\ncounterclaim for breach of their duty of care to him in the professional advice they rendered\n\nvis--vis the acquisition.",
        "Breach of warranties": ".38.    I will deal first with the claims against Sng based on the letter of\n\nwarranty. The letter stated:\" I refer to my telephone conversation with Mr Eddie Lim on Tuesday 27thMay 1997, in respect of the intended sale of shares in the capital of Seng Hup Corporation Berhad\n\n  (Seng Hup).2) In consideration of your agreeing to purchase from me or my nominees shares\n\n  in the capital of Seng Hup and, in the absence of availability of Seng Hups audited financial\n\n  statements for the financial year ended 31 March 1997 (the Relevant Year), I represent\n\n  and warrant to you that:-a) There has not been any changes in the capital of Seng Hup from the date of\n\n    its last published accounts.b) The sales turnover of Seng Hup and its subsidiaries and associates (the\n\n    Seng Hup Group) for the Relevant Year shall be not less that (sic) MYR65.0 million and the\n\n    profits before taxation of the Seng Hup Group shall not have more than a five (5) percent\n\n    variance from MYR2.80 million.c) The Seng Hup Group has not disposed of any of its fixed assets during the\n\n    Relevant Year and have not contracted to dispose of any of its fixed assets.d) The physical stocks and inventories held for sale in the Seng Hup Group\n\n    shall not be more than a five (5) percent variance from MYR48.3 million as at the end of the\n\n    Relevant Year and the valuation of the stocks shall be based on the accepted accounting\n\n    practice.e) Other than the MYR5.13 million owing to Seng Hup from a company in which a\n\n    director of Seng Hup, Mr Richard TEO Song Kwang has an interest in, which I will undertake to\n\n    guarantee that the said amount owing will be repaid to the Seng Hup Group before the financial\n\n    year ending 31 March 1998, all trade and other debtors are debts and credits granted by the Seng\n\n    Hup Group in the normal course of doing business which have been conducted on an arms-length\n\n    basis.f) All trade and other creditors are current liabilities of the Seng Hup\n\n    Group which were incurred in the normal course of doing business which have been conducted on an\n\n    arms-length basis.g) The Seng Hup Group has not during the Relevant Year incurred any\n\n    additional borrowings other than those incurred in the ordinary course of business. The\n\n    Revolving Credit Facility and the Guaranteed Notes Issuance Facility have a final maturity not\n\n    earlier than the financial year ending 31 March 1999.h) All material contracts (the Rented Assets Contracts) relating to the\n\n    rented property assets are entered into on an arms-length basis.i) The Seng Hup Group has not entered into any service and/or employment\n\n    contracts with any of its past and present shareholders or directors which cannot be terminated\n\n    without the payment of any compensation.j) The Seng Hup Group has not entered into any long term supply contracts\n\n    with any of its past and present shareholders or directors, including any companies in which\n\n    past and present shareholders and directors have an interest in, which cannot be terminated\n\n    without the payment of any compensation.3)The above representations and warrantiesare given by me personally\n\n  andare in lieu of your request to undertake a due-diligenceon the accounts and business\n\n  of the Seng Hup Group. I further am aware that you have relied on my above representations and\n\n  warranties for your decision to purchase my shares in the capital of Seng Hup.Looking forward to your acceptance hereof.\"(Emphasis added.)Paragraph 3 of the letter suggests that the warranties were given in lieu of an\n\nearlier obligation to afford RG an opportunity to conduct a due diligence exercise on Seng Hup. That\n\nwas in fact so. The history of how this letter of warranty came to be given was as follows.",
        "Warranties in lieu of due diligence": ".39.    On 16 May 1997, as a follow-up to the meeting at the Marina Mandarin, RG\n\nhad sent a letter to Sng confirming his (RGs) interest in buying 6.2 million Seng Hup shares at\n\nnot more than RM12 per share \"subject to our having undertaken a due-diligence to our\n\nsatisfaction on the accounts and business of the company\". Leong, at RGs request, had helped\n\nRG draft that letter. Seng Hup was a public listed company. As such, disclosing to an intending\n\npurchaser of Seng Hup shares, information relating to the affairs of Seng Hup that was not in the\n\npublic domain, or giving an intending purchaser access to the books of Seng Hup for the purpose of\n\nconducting a due diligence exercise could meet with difficulties. Leong, who was aware of these\n\ndifficulties, nevertheless inserted the proviso relating to due diligence. In effect, he told the\n\ncourt that he did this in order to give RG an escape route should the need arise.40.    Yeo Siah Meng (\"Yeo\") the then Managing Director of CEF (Hong\n\nKong), when cross-examined by Mr Yim also confirmed that a purchaser of shares, even a large block\n\nof shares, in a public listed company would not be allowed access to the companys books of\n\naccount. It was Yeos evidence that an intending purchaser of shares in a public listed company\n\nwould have to rely primarily on the published information and published accounts of the company. The\n\nonly protection that such a purchaser could expect would be such warranties that the vendor was\n\nprepared to give.41.    On 25 May 1997, Sng, in response to a request by Eddie, had sent a fax to\n\nRG and Eddie wherein Sng had confirmed that the profit before tax of Seng Hup as at 31 March 1997\n\nwas \"within RM3 million\". In that fax, Sng stated that he could not disclose the\n\n(exact) year-end results that had been asked for because the results had not been disclosed to the\n\nStock Exchange. Sng, however, in the letter, assured RG that he (Sng) would be responsible for any\n\nshortfall. (This was also one of the warranties that Sng was alleged to have breached).42.    When Leong saw, from the letter of 25 May 1997, the willingness of Sng to\n\ngive assurances in lieu of making disclosures prohibited by the Stock Exchange, Leong felt that it\n\nwould be in RGs interest (and hence CEFs interests) to exact more warranties from Sng.\n\nIn consultation with RG and Eddie, he drafted a list of warranties to be given by Sng in lieu\n\nof his giving RG an opportunity to conduct a due diligence exercise on Seng Hup. The letter of\n\nwarranty sent by Sng contained the draft warranties that Leong had helped to draft.",
        "Were warranties breached": "?43.    In order to succeed in his claim, RG would have to prove that Sng was in\n\nbreach of the warranties contained in the letter. RG, by his pleadings (paragraph 24 of the\n\nStatement of Claim) sought to rely on the AA Report to provide this proof. To adduce the AA Report\n\nas evidence, the makers of that Report would have to be called as witnesses. At the time the hearing\n\ncommenced, no arrangements had been put in place by RG for this to be done. Nor were any\n\narrangements made for any other accountant or person familiar with the financial affairs of Seng\n\nHup, to be called to testify on the accuracy or otherwise of the representations and warranties in\n\nquestion. What RG sought to do, instead, was to prove the breach of the representations and\n\nwarranties by incorporating the AA Report as part of his evidence-in-chief.44.    CEF, Leong, Flora and Sng all objected to the admission of the AA Report.\n\nThey objected on grounds of:(a)relevanceThe AA Report was a report on the state of affairs of Seng Hup as at 31\n\n  September 1997. It was not a report of the financial affairs of Seng Hup for the period relevant\n\n  to the issues in this case, ie the period in respect of which the representations and warranties\n\n  were given. The Report was therefore irrelevant; and(b)admissibilityIn the absence of direct testimony from the makers of the Report the contents\n\n  of the Report were hearsay and inadmissible.There was merit in both these objections. I indicated to Mr Yim that if he wanted\n\nto have the AA Report admitted in evidence he would have to apply for leave to call the person/s\n\nfrom AA who prepared the report to testify in these proceedings.",
        "Application to call Teoh": ".45.    On 7 March 2000  the 11thday of the trial  by way of SIC\n\nNo. 601130/2000, Mr Yim applied for leave to file the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of Teoh Soo\n\nHock (\"Teoh\") of AA. Teoh was one of the authors of the AA Report. Affidavits in support\n\nof the applications were filed. Mr Yim told the court that because Seng Hup had been placed under\n\nDhanaharta on 9 September 1999 and Dhanaharta had refused its consent for AA to testify about the\n\naffairs of Seng Hup, RG had not been able to call Teoh as a witness. Mr Yim went on to say that\n\nDhanaharta had now given its consent and RG could now call Teoh as a witness. Mr Yim further\n\nsubmitted that as discovery of the AA Report had already been made to all the parties, there would\n\nbe no prejudice to anyone by reason of this late application to call Teoh.46.    Counsel for Sng, Flora, CEF and Leong (\"the alleged\n\nconspirators\") all objected to the application. The gist of their objection was that:(a) they had, all along, been led to believed that RG was not calling AA or any\n\n  other accountant to testify on the affairs of AA. In that belief, they had aborted all efforts to\n\n  retain their own experts to study the AA Report. To allow RG to call Teoh at this late stage would\n\n  therefore be prejudicial to them;(b) if the AA Report was admitted discovery would have to be made of all\n\n  documents that form the basis of the AA Report so that the experts (to be appointed) could\n\n  meaningfully look into the matter. This would cause considerable delay to this trial;(c) RG had claimed that he could not procure the attendance of Teoh earlier\n\n  because Dhanaharta would not give its \"consent\", but, apart from the say-so of RG,\n\n  nothing in the affidavits filed in support of the application  not even the affidavit of Teoh\n\n   reflected this. The \"consent\" that was produced  dated 18 February 2000 \n\n  was not signed by Dhanaharta but was signed by RG himself as \"CEO and Director\"\n\n  of Seng Hup. Also, there was no evidence before the court as to why RG could not have\n\n  procured this \"consent\" before Dhanaharta came into the picture; and(d) the AA Report reflected Seng Hups affairs as at 30 September 1997.\n\n  That date had no relevance to these proceedings. If the Report was admitted, questions of\n\n  causation and novus actus intervenus caused by the economic downturn in the second half of 1997\n\n  would also arise.There was merit in the submission on behalf of the alleged conspirators that this\n\n\"surprise\" calling of Teoh as a witness would cause them prejudice and might further\n\nprolong this already long trial. But that prejudice had to be weighed against the difficulties that\n\nRG had faced in procuring the attendance of Teoh, the importance of the evidence of Teoh to RGs\n\ncase and the prejudice to RG should the application be disallowed. The submission that the Report,\n\nbeing a report of the position of Seng Hup as at 30 September 1997, would be of no relevance to the\n\nissues in this case could also have merit, but, without hearing what Teoh had to say, it would be\n\npremature to accept that submission.47.    The affidavits filed in support of this application were, however, not\n\nsufficiently precise for me to be able to say that RG, up to then, had been unable to call Teoh\n\nbecause Dhanaharta had refused to consent. If that was indeed the reason, RG should be able, without\n\nmuch difficulty, to produce documentary evidence to support that assertion. At the very least Teoh,\n\nor someone from AA, could testify that it was because Dhanaharta refused to consent that AA could\n\nnot agree to testify on behalf of RG. I granted RG leave to file a further affidavit/s to address\n\nthis issue.48.    On 17 March 2000, Mr Yim addressed the court again on this matter. He had\n\nby then obtained another affidavit from Teoh. However, nowhere in that affidavit did Teoh state, in\n\nso many words, that it was because of the refusal by Dhanaharta to give its consent that Teoh/AA had\n\nso far been unable to testify. Because of the importance to RGs case that he adduce credible\n\nevidence to show that the written warranties given by Sng and the other representations allegedly\n\nmade by Sng and the others were untrue, I allowed RG a further opportunity to satisfy me that the\n\nfailure, up to then, to arrange for Teoh/AA to testify was not due to any fault of RG.49.    However, even by 2 August 2000, no further affidavits were filed by RG. The\n\nuncertainty about whether leave would or would not be granted to RG to call Teoh as a witness was\n\ncausing difficulties in the cross-examination of witnesses. In the circumstances, as RG had not\n\nsatisfied me that the failure to call Teoh earlier was not through any fault of his, I dismissed RGs\n\napplication in Suit No. 601130/2001.50.    I do not know to what extent the AA Report and the evidence of Teoh would\n\nhave helped in proving that the alleged representations/warranties were misleading or false but the\n\nposition at the close of the hearing was that there was insufficient credible evidence before me for\n\nme to find that Sng had breached any of the terms in the letter of warranty. This was also so in\n\nrespect of the other representations allegedly made by Flora, Sng, Leong and CEF.51.    The failure to adduce satisfactory evidence of the affairs of Seng Hup also\n\nmeant that even if Flora, Sng, Leong and CEF had made the representations complained about, there\n\nwas no evidence on which the court could conclude that these representations were untrue. In this\n\ncase, however, I was not satisfied that, in the first place, such representations had been made by\n\nthem and, even if made, that RG had relied on those representations in deciding to buy the Seng Hup\n\nshares.",
        "RGs credibility": ".52.    RG came through to me as a person who had scant regard for the truth. The\n\ncontradictory positions he took in trying to defend himself from the claim for commission brought\n\nagainst him by Flora was sufficient by itself to show that he was a person who, when it came to\n\nprotecting his self-interest, had no compunctions about taking any position that would achieve that\n\nend regardless of the truth of that position. A perusal of the record will show numerous instances\n\nof RGs evasiveness. Even his counsel, Mr Yim, conceded, in his closing submissions (paragraph\n\n219) that there were various inconsistencies in RGs evidence and that RG was sometimes evasive.53.    The fact that RG was shown to be prevaricating in some aspects of the case\n\ndoes not, of course, mean that his entire evidence must be rejected outright. I accepted Mr Yims\n\nsubmission (based on the case ofTeo Geok Fong v Lim Eng Hock[1996] 3 SLR 431) that the mere\n\nfact that the credit of a witness had been impeached did not necessarily mean that all his evidence\n\nwould be disregarded. I accepted that it was the duty of the court to scrutinise the whole of the\n\nevidence to determine what was true and what was not. But the shifts in position by RG in this case\n\nwere so drastic that his general credibility was put in doubt. The situation was not helped  to\n\ncite just the two instances referred to above  by his allegation that CEF had forged the\n\nsignature of Yap on two documents but calling no evidence to support that allegation or by his\n\nassertion that he could not call Teoh to testify because Dhanaharta had refused consent but\n\nproducing no evidence to support this assertion. But even so, in assessing the evidence of RG (and\n\nthe other witnesses), I bore in mind that it did not follow that where a witness had told untruths\n\nor been evasive or contradicted himself on some material points, that witness was necessarily not to\n\nbe believed in the rest of his evidence.",
        "Flora": ".54.    Flora, Sng, Leong and the other officers from CEF, when compared with RG,\n\ncame through as truthful witnesses. Although RG tried to paint Flora as a conspirator, who, with the\n\nothers, had defrauded him, I accepted Floras evidence that her role was no more than that of a\n\nmiddleman who, for a fee, was putting a seller and a buyer together. I accepted her evidence\n\nthat she made no representations to RG about the financial viability of Seng Hup and that she had\n\nnot, at the Marina Mandarin meeting, produced any accounts of Seng Hup. I accepted her evidence\n\nthat, in any event, she did not, at the Marina Mandarin meeting, have to \"sell\" Seng Hup\n\nto RG because RG (and Eddie) had, prior to that meeting, spoken to her on the phone and she knew\n\nfrom those conversations that RG was keen to buy the shares at RM12 per share. I was satisfied\n\nthat nothing that Flora may have said, either at the Marina Mandarin meeting or elsewhere, had the\n\neffect of influencing RG to buy the Seng Hup shares.55.    I also accepted the evidence of Flora that from early June 1997, both RG\n\nand Sng kept her in the dark as to what was happening and that she did not get to know, until much\n\nlater, that the shares had been sold to RG. The allegations of conspiracy and misrepresentation made\n\nagainst Flora by RG were, in my view, nothing but self-serving conjecture.",
        "Sng": ".56.    Although Sng was a major shareholder of Seng Hup, he was not on the Board\n\nof Seng Hup. Sngs interest in Seng Hup was only as a stock player. He had himself purchased the\n\nbulk of the shares he sold to RG only a short while before the agreement to sell them to RG. As Sng\n\nhad no interest in getting involved in the management of Seng Hup, he had allowed the existing Board\n\nof Directors to continue to be in office even after acquiring such a large portfolio.57.    There was evidence that Sng, at a dinner hosted by RG in late May 1997, had\n\nsaid to those present (including RG) \"Come, let us make some money\"; and there was\n\nevidence that Sng had taken trading advantage of the fact that RG was about to buy 40% of the\n\npaid-up capital of a public listed company. He no doubt also took trading advantage of the fact that\n\nthe first tranche was to be transacted at a price considerably higher than the RM12 that had been\n\nagreed and the second tranche at a lower price. Indeed, there was evidence that DG, RG himself,\n\nEddie and Andrew, were also indulging in the trading of Seng Hup shares from around early June 1997.58.    There was evidence that Sng had given the profits he made in one lot of his\n\nearlier trades in Seng Hup shares to Flora. It was suggested that this showed that Sng and Flora\n\nwere working together to defraud RG. I rejected that suggestion. I accepted the evidence of Flora\n\nand Sng that this reflected no more than a gift from Sng to Flora for having procured the sale of\n\nSngs shares. It did not, in the circumstances, indicate the existence of any conspiracy between\n\nSng and Flora to defraud RG.59.    I accepted Sngs evidence that RG, because of his previous history of\n\ntrading in lighting equipment, was keen to acquire the 8 million Seng Hup shares and that, save for\n\nthe written warranties and assurances he had given, Sng had not made any other representations to RG\n\nto induce RG to buy the shares. I was satisfied that RG bought the Seng Hup shares because of his\n\ndesire to get back into a business he was experienced in and in his confidence in his own ability to\n\nsuccessfully manage Seng Hup.",
        "CEF and Leong": ".60.    I take CEF and Leong together because the allegation of misrepresentation,\n\nconspiracy and negligence against CEF arose mainly from what Leong  an employee of CEF  did or\n\ndid not do.61.    The allegation of conspiracy against CEF and Leong was, as in the case of\n\nsimilar allegations against Sng and Flora, completely without merit. It seemed to me that RG had\n\nthought up these allegations merely as a device to delay the proceedings taken against him.62.    The allegations of misrepresentation too were without foundation. There was\n\nno doubt that Leong was in close contact with Eddie and RG at the time RG decided to buy the Seng\n\nHup shares but, to say that RG bought the shares as a result of any representation Leong made\n\nwould, in my assessment, be a misrepresentation of the truth. It seemed to me, that if at all\n\nanyone had encouraged RG to buy the Seng Hup shares, that person was not Leong but Eddie.63.    It was clear to me that RG decided to buy the controlling interests in Seng\n\nHup because(a) it suited RGs business needs to have a public listed company into which\n\n  he could inject some of his assets;(b) the lighting business was one which RG was familiar with. He was also\n\n  familiar with the way in which the existing management of Seng Hup had conducted its business and\n\n  had full confidence in his own ability to make a success of Seng Hup;(c) there was some symbiosis between RGs main line of business as a property\n\n  developer (in Singapore, Malaysia and China) and Seng Hups business in light fittings; and(d) the price of RM12 per share seemed to him to be a fair price to pay for a\n\n  controlling interest in Seng Hup.I accepted Leongs evidence that his main role was in the processing,\n\nstructuring and securitisation of the massive loan that CEF was to make to RG. I accepted Leongs\n\nevidence that he had, at no stage, told RG or Eddie that CEF would provide professional advice in\n\nthe acquisition. Indeed, the unchallenged evidence before the court was that CEF was not a licensed\n\nmerchant bank in Malaysia and could not have provided such advice in respect of a Malaysian listed\n\ncompany. If CEF had wanted to assume the role of professional advisor to RG in the acquisition,\n\nCEF would have had to work with a merchant bank in Malaysia.64.    It would be relevant to note that just prior to the Seng Hup acquisition,\n\nCEF had acted for RG in RGs attempt to acquire a controlling interest of a public listed company\n\nin Hong Kong called \"Poly Investments Holdings Ltd\" (\"Poly\"). That attempt\n\nproved abortive because, in RGs words, \"the price of the Poly shares on the Hong Kong market\n\nhad risen too high by mid-May 1997\". In respect of the Poly deal, the letter of offer from CEF\n\nto RG clearly spelt out that CEF would finance the acquisition and provide acquisition advice.\n\nAlthough some internal documents of CEF made reference to the giving of advice to RG, the letter of\n\noffer sent to RG (albeit sent only after the first tranche had been crossed) referred only to\n\nfinancing the acquisition and made no reference to the giving of acquisition advice.65.    Leong did not deny that he did assist RG in drafting some letters and in\n\ndrafting the letter of warranty. He claimed that he did this because RG sought his assistance and,\n\nas these were matters within his competence, he could not reasonably refuse assistance. In any\n\nevent, it was as important to CEF as financiers (since CEF was granting the loans, inter alia, on\n\nthe security of the Seng Hup shares being purchased) as it was to RG that the purchase should be on\n\nterms as favourable to RG as possible. Leong therefore considered the help he gave to RG in these\n\nmatters as part of his duties to CEF as financiers of the intended purchase. Similarly, when Eddie\n\nat the last minute asked him to go in his place to meet Sng in Kuala Lumpur, Leong obliged since he\n\nhad not, up till then, met Sng and he felt that such a meeting would be of benefit to CEF in\n\nassessing the bona fides of Sng as the vendor of such a large block of shares. Whilst in Kuala\n\nLumpur, Leong made some enquiries from Sng on matters that RG and Eddie had asked him to.66.    I rejected RGs claim that it was Leong who decided on the pricing of the\n\ntwo tranches of shares. RG claimed that Leong had advised on this price strategy in order to\n\ngenerate market interest in Seng Hup shares. I accepted Leongs evidence  and this was\n\nsupported by the evidence of Eddie  that he (Leong) had nothing to do with pricing strategy. I\n\naccepted that Leong was no market player and was not involved in any market rigging exercise. The\n\nother persons surrounding RG, namely Eddie, Andrew and Wong were, on the other hand, seasoned market\n\nplayers and, if at all anyone advised RG on pricing stratagem, it would have been one or more of\n\nthem.67.    I accepted Leongs evidence that when he learnt that the second tranche\n\nwas to be traded at a price considerably lower than the first tranche, he felt that in order to\n\nprotect CEFs (and incidentally RGs) interest it would be critical to ensure that the sale of\n\nthe second tranche did take place. To ensure this Leong arranged for Bayerische Landesbank, who were\n\nholding the 3.7 million shares comprised in the second tranche, to give an undertaking to RGs\n\nsolicitors that that 3.7 million shares would be transacted at the lower price. There was nothing\n\nnegligent or improper in this conduct of Leong. To the contrary, that undertaking benefited RG as\n\nmuch as it did CEF.68.    It was the evidence of RG that Leong went to Kuala Lumpur to conduct a due\n\ndiligence exercise on Seng Hup and that when Leong returned he informed RG that the Seng Hups\n\nfinances were in order. I accepted Leongs evidence on the circumstances that led to his\n\nKuala Lumpur trip. I accepted his evidence that he had at no stage undertaken or been asked to\n\nundertaken a due diligence exercise on Seng Hup. I accepted his evidence that, in any event, it\n\nwould have been impossible to perform such an exercise on just a one-day trip to Kuala Lumpur. I\n\naccepted Leongs evidence that he did not, at any stage whether before or after the Kuala Lumpur\n\ntrip, assure RG that the finances of Seng Hup were in order or involve himself on the question of\n\nwhat the price for the purchase of the shares should be.69.    I also find that RG  with his fairly extensive commercial experience \n\nknew that it would not be possible for a purchaser of shares in a public listed company to do an\n\neffective due diligence exercise on that company. I also find that RG knew, at the time he purchased\n\nthe Seng Hup shares, that CEF had not carried out a due diligence exercise on his behalf on Seng\n\nHup. This was obvious from the letter of warranty sent to RG by Sng  well before the first\n\ncrossing  in which Sng stated that he was giving the warranties in lieu of the due diligence\n\nexercise.",
        "Negligence": ".70.    It was also RGs case that even if CEF had not represented to RG that\n\nthey would be the professional advisors in the Seng Hup acquisition, Leong had voluntarily assumed\n\nthis role and therefore Leong and CEF (as the employer of Leong) would be liable to RG for\n\nnegligence in connection with that role.71.    In support of the above submission, Mr Yim referred to various authorities\n\nbeginning with the celebrated case ofHedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Pnrs Ltd[1964] AC 465 at 467. The principles laid down in those cases were, however, not in issue. What was\n\nin issue was whether Leong had fallen foul of those principles.72.    It may well be that Leong, in helping RG draft some of the documents, took\n\non an advisory role or at least could have led RG to believe that he was acting in an advisory role.\n\nIf it can be shown that, in respect of those matters on which RG had relied on the advice of\n\nLeong, RG suffered a loss because Leong had been negligent in his advice, then Leong (and CEF)\n\nmay be liable in damages to RG. However, that did not happen in this case.73.    I am satisfied that Leong did not give any advice to RG relating to RGs\n\ncommercial decision to buy the Seng Hup shares at RM12 per share. That was a matter in the province\n\nof RG and Eddie. Leong also played no part in the pricing strategy for the two tranches.74.    Leongs role in drafting the letter of 16 May 1997 and his role in\n\ndrafting the letter of warranty were amongst the acts of Leong which were highlighted as providing\n\nevidence of the advisory role that Leong had undertaken. Leong and CEF have contended that in\n\ndrafting these letters Leong was acting to protect CEFs interests as financiers but even if one\n\naccepts that Leong, nevertheless, had taken on the mantle of advisor on these matters to RG, there\n\ncould be a cause of action against Leong only if it could be shown that Leong was negligent in what\n\nhe did.75.    Leong admitted playing a role in ensuring that the offer by RG to purchase\n\nthe shares was subject to due diligence. But, as noted earlier, it was not really feasible to do an\n\neffective due diligence exercise on a public listed company. Even Mr Yim recognised this difficulty\n\nwhen, in reference to Sngs claim that Sng had obtained the unaudited internal accounts of Seng\n\nHup, Mr Yim said (at page 210 of his submissions):\"Internal interim accounts of a public company is highly price sensitive\n\n  information and no management team, mindful of their fiduciary duties, would ever disclose this to\n\n  anyone, let alone a shareholder who was thinking of disposing of his shares!\"To the extent that a seller cannot have access to price-sensitive information, a\n\nbuyer too cannot have access to such information.76.    The reality therefore was that by subjecting the intended purchase of Seng\n\nHup shares to a right for RG to conduct a due diligence exercise on Seng Hup and then trading that\n\n(rather ineffective) right for warranties given by Sng, Leong was able to procure for RG a degree of\n\nprotection that RG would not otherwise have had: such acts could hardly be described as negligent.77.    In his closing submissions, Mr Yim detailed a whole host of other acts done\n\nby Leong which, he submitted, went towards showing that Leong was rendering advisory services. Even\n\nif that was so, it does not assist RG in his claim against Leong (and CEF) because none of these\n\nacts, either alone or in combination, could be, in my view, characterised as negligent. Nor was\n\nit established that RG relied on the advise of RG in his decision to purchase the Seng Hup shares.78.    It was also suggested that in failing to warn RG about the risks of\n\npurchasing shares without carrying out a due diligence, Leong and CEF were in breach of their duty\n\nof care to RG. In response to this suggestion, Mr Alvin Tan, counsel for Leong, submitted that the\n\nrisk that one runs in buying anything without carrying out proper checks was so obvious that the\n\nduty suggested  that Leong should have warned RG of such risks  did not accord with common\n\nsense. I accepted that submission. Any person involved in commercial transactions, to the extent\n\nthat RG was, would have known of the risks involved in buying shares of a company. I did not\n\nconsider that  to adopt the words of Lord Bridge inCaparo Industries plc v Dickman & Ors[1990] 2 AC 605)  it was \"fair, just and reasonable\" that the law should in this\n\ncase impose a duty on Leong to specifically warn RG of such obvious risks.79.    For the above reasons, I gave judgment against DG in Suit No.\n\n849/98 and dismissed with costs the claims by RG and City Square against Sng in Suit No.\n\n822/99; the counterclaim by RG against Flora in Suit No. 24/98; and the counterclaims by the RG\n\nGroup against CEF and Leong in Suit No. 849/98.Sgd:S.
