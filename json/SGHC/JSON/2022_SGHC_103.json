There were in total 25 packets containing granular/powdery substances. 8 Other exhibits were also seized from the accused’s bedroom, and they include:5Foot Note 5×ASOF Annex – List of Physical Exhibits. (a) one roll of clear wrap (marked “A1”);(b) one improvised smoking apparatus and one lighter (marked “D10”);(c) one clear box (marked “D11”) containing numerous empty packets and black tape (marked “D11A”), one roll of clear wrap (marked “D11B”) and numerous black packets (marked “D11C”); and(d) two “5 STARS” notebooks with writings (marked “E1”).",
        "Statement recording": "9 A total of eight statements were recorded from the accused. 10 SI Eugene recorded a statement from the accused under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) in the accused’s bedroom shortly after he was arrested (the “Contemporaneous Statement”). The Contemporaneous Statement was recorded from 11.05pm on 20 November 2018 to 12.05am on 21 November 2018,6Foot Note 6×ASOF at paras 9 and 11.in a question-and-answer format. SI Eugene asked the accused what language he wished to speak in. The accused chose to give his Contemporaneous Statement in Mandarin. SI Eugene asked the accused questions in Mandarin, and the accused answered in Mandarin. SI Eugene recorded the questions and answers in writing in English. After recording the Contemporaneous Statement, SI Eugene read it back to the accused in Mandarin. The accused affirmed that the Contemporaneous Statement, as read back by SI Eugene to the accused in Mandarin, was true and correct. SI Eugene invited the accused to make any alterations to the Contemporaneous Statement, but the accused declined. SI Eugene then wrote an acknowledgment clause at the end of the Contemporaneous Statement and read it to the accused in Mandarin. The accused appended his signature at the end of each page and below the acknowledgment clause. SI Eugene also signed below the acknowledgment clause.7Foot Note 7×ASOF at para 10. 11 Another statement was recorded by Assistant Superintendent Yang Weili (“ASP Yang”) under s 23 of the CPC on 21 November 2018 from 1.33pm to 2.03pm (the “Cautioned Statement”).8Foot Note 8×ASOF at paras 19–20 and 22.During the course of investigations, ASP Yang recorded six more statements from the accused under s 22 of the CPC (collectively, the “Long Statements”): (a) a statement dated 26 November 2018, recorded from 7.26pm to 9.27pm at Central Police Divisional Headquarters (“PCC”) Lockup Interview Room 5 (the “1st Long Statement”);(b) a statement dated 27 November 2018, recorded from 9.52am to 11.26am at PCC Lockup Interview Room 12 (the “2nd Long Statement”);(c) a statement dated 27 November 2018, recorded from 7.22pm to 9.32pm at PCC Lockup Interview Room 4 (the “3rd Long Statement”);(d) a statement dated 28 November 2018, recorded from 7.28pm to 10.23pm at PCC Lockup Interview Room 12 (the “4th Long Statement”);(e) a statement dated 29 November 2018, recorded from 2.45pm to 4.43pm at PCC Lockup Interview Room 9 (the “5th Long Statement”); and(f) a statement dated 8 August 2019, recorded from 9.13am to 10.02am at Changi Prison Complex Cluster B2, Interview Room 6 (the “6th Long Statement”). 12 The statement-recording process for the Long Statements was as follows:9Foot Note 9×ASOF at para 21. (a) Before recording the statement, ASP Yang asked the accused what language he wished to speak in. He chose to speak in Mandarin. (b) Language Executive Wong Png Leong (“LE Wong”) acted as a Mandarin interpreter for the recording. The accused did not object to LE Wong acting as a Mandarin interpreter. (c) ASP Yang asked the accused questions in English. LE Wong interpreted the same to the accused in Mandarin. The accused answered in Mandarin. LE Wong interpreted the same to ASP Yang in English. (d) ASP Yang typed out the answers of the accused in narrative form on his laptop. The same process was repeated until the statement-recording process was completed. (e) For each of the statements, ASP Yang printed out the statement and handed it to LE Wong, who interpreted and read back each statement to the accused in Mandarin. (f) Several amendments and corrections to typographical errors were made during this process. Each amendment was explained to the accused in Mandarin. He was invited to make further amendments to his statement. He declined. The accused then signed at the bottom of each page of each statement, and against each amendment. (g) Thereafter, ASP Yang wrote out an acknowledgment clause at the end of each statement. LE Wong read the clause to the accused in Mandarin. The accused confirmed that he understood the clause, as read by LE Wong to him in Mandarin, and signed below the clause after affirming each statement to be his. LE Wong and ASP Yang similarly appended their signatures. The statement-recording process for the Cautioned Statement was the same.10Foot Note 10×ASOF at para 23. 13 It is an agreed fact between parties that the Contemporaneous Statement, Cautioned Statement and Long Statements were made by the accused voluntarily, and there were no threats, inducements or promises made to him during the recording of these statements.11Foot Note 11×ASOF at paras 11 and 24.",
        "Analysis of seized drug exhibits": "14 The seized drug exhibits were subsequently sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”). Mr Koh Hui Boon (“Mr Koh”), an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA, analysed the 25 packets of granular/powdery substances in exhibits D4 to D9 set out at [7] above and found that they contained not less than 34.94g of diamorphine (the “Drugs”).12Foot Note 12×ASOF at para 26.The Drugs are the subject of the Charge (see above at [1]). 15 On 16 April 2019, Analyst Tang Sheau Wei June issued two reports stating that the accused’s DNA profile was found on,inter alia, the following exhibits:13Foot Note 13×ASOF at para 29. (a) exterior and interior of re-sealable bag marked “D4”;(b) sticky side of tape of one re-sealable bag with cling wraps and a tape marked “D4C2”;(c) exterior of re-sealable bags marked “D6A1”, “D6A2”, “D7B” and “D7C”;(d) cling wrap marked “D6A”, “D6B” and “D8A”; and(e) exterior and interior of re-sealable bag marked “D7A”.",
        "Parties’ cases": "16 It is undisputed that the Drugs were in the accused’s possession within the meaning of s 5 of the MDA. The Prosecution initially proceeded on the basis that the Defence was not disputing the chain of custody of the Drugs, and focused its submissions on showing that the other two elements of the Charge,ie, knowledge of the nature of the Drugs and possession of the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking, have been satisfied. In this regard, the Prosecution invokes the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA (“the s 18(2) presumption”) and seeks to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had the intention to traffic the Drugs in his possession. The Prosecution relies primarily on the accused’s lack of credibility, as seen from how his account of events has shifted across his statements and oral testimony, as well as various admissions in the accused’s statements that he had delivered and sent drugs on previous occasions. 17 On the other hand, the Defence, in its closing submissions, contends that there is a reasonable doubt in the integrity of the chain of custody from the time after the exhibits were seized and sealed into tamper-proof bags.14Foot Note 14×Defence’s Submissions (“DS”) at para 2.1.The Defence also submits that the accused has successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA on a balance of probabilities, and has raised a reasonable doubt that the accused possessed the Drugs with the intention to deliver the same.15Foot Note 15×DS at paras 2.2 and 2.3.Central to the Defence’s case is that the accused thought that the Drugs were cannabis (which is known either as “grass”, “ganja” or “gu”), and that the accused was merely safekeeping drugs, including the Drugs, for a person known as “Alan” with the intention of returning the drugs to him. 18 The Prosecution, in reply, alleges that the Defence has failed to put (or even suggest) to the relevant CNB officers that their evidence on the chain of custody of the Drugs was untrue, or not within their personal knowledge, and submits that the Defence should be precluded from challenging the chain of custody at this stage of the proceedings.16Foot Note 16×Prosecution’s Reply Submissions (“PRS”) at paras 3 and 28.Nevertheless, the Prosecution sets out in its reply submissions what is in its view an unbroken chain of custody of the Drugs from seizure to analysis, and rebuts the Defence’s attempts to raise a reasonable doubt on this point. 19 In the light of parties’ respective cases, I will first address the issue of the chain of custody of the Drugs and consider whether there is merit in the Defence’s challenges as to the accuracy with which several of the accused’s statements were recorded and/or interpreted, before considering whether the elements of the Charge have been satisfied. In my analysis, the terms “grass”, “ganja” and “gu” will be used interchangeably to refer to cannabis, where applicable, so as to accurately reflect the different terms used by the accused across his statements, testimony and notebooks found in his possession.",
        "Chain of custody": "20 As held by the Court of Appeal inMohamedAffandi bin Rosli v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2019] 1 SLR 440 (“Affandi”) at [39]–[40], the Prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the drug exhibits analysed by the HSA are the very ones that were initially seized by the CNB officers from the accused. It is first incumbent on the Prosecution to establish an unbroken chain of custody and account for the movement of the drug exhibits at every point from seizure to analysis. In the context of the Prosecution establishing the chain of custody, the Defence may seek to show that at one or more stages, there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the chain of custody may have been broken. Where this is shown to be the case and a reasonable doubt is raised as to the identity of the drug exhibits, then the Prosecution has not discharged its burden.",
        "The chain of custody according to the Prosecution": "21 I now turn to consider whether the Prosecution has proven a complete chain of custody in relation to the Drugs. In this regard, the Prosecution relies on the evidence of Sgt Hidayat, SI Alwin, SI Eugene and SI Tay, who handled the seized exhibits in the accused’s home, and ASP Yang, Sergeant Goh Yang Lun (“Sgt Goh”) and Mr Koh, who handled the seized exhibits at CNB HQ. 22 The chain of custody, as submitted by the Prosecution, is as follows: (a) Shortly after the accused’s arrest on 20 November 2018, Sgt Hidayat conducted a search of the accused’s bedroom at about 8.38pm.17Foot Note 17×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 48 lines 3–5.Sgt Hidayat seized the Drugs (that is, exhibits D4 to D9) from the third side drawer in the accused’s view and presence.18Foot Note 18×AB 304–305 (para 9).While Sgt Hidayat was seizing the exhibits, a colleague was writing down descriptions of the same in a field diary.19Foot Note 19×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 48 lines 17–18. (b) SI Alwin assisted Sgt Hidayat with the packing and sealing of the exhibits into CNB tamper-proof polymer bags (the “Tamper-Proof Bags”).20Foot Note 20×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 48 lines 6–8.At about 9.50pm, SI Alwin handed over the seized exhibits to SI Eugene.21Foot Note 21×AB 281-282 (paras 10–11); 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 54 lines 2–10. (c) SI Eugene received a black duffel bag from SI Alwin, which he understood contained the exhibits seized from the accused’s bedroom.22Foot Note 22×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 9 lines 24–28 and p 15 lines 19–21.Although SI Eugene did not see the exhibits being placed into the black duffel bag, he testified that it was “STF’s procedure” to place all the exhibits into the duffel bag.23Foot Note 23×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 15 lines 9–18. (d) At 10.31pm, SI Eugene handed over the black duffel bag, containing all the seized exhibits, to SI Tay.24Foot Note 24×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 16 lines 12–16; AB 272 (para 12). (e) At 11pm, SI Tay handed over the black duffel bag, containing the seized exhibits, to SI Eugene for the latter to record the Contemporaneous Statement from the accused.25Foot Note 25×AB 272 (para 13); AB 289 (para 14); 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 68 lines 23–30. (f) SI Eugene testified that before the Contemporaneous Statement was recorded, the five black packets (ie, exhibits D5 to D9) had already been sealed in Tamper-Proof Bags, which were inside the black duffel bag.26Foot Note 26×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 17 lines 27–30.SI Eugene took out the Tamper-Proof Bags, containing the five black packets (ie, exhibits D5 to D9), to show them to the accused, and placed them back into the black duffel bag thereafter.27Foot Note 27×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 17 line 31 to p 18 line 18. (g) After the Contemporaneous Statement was recorded, SI Eugene handed over all the seized exhibits in the duffel bag to SI Tay.28Foot Note 28×AB 289 (para 15); 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 80 lines 10–14. (h) On 21 November 2018 at about 1.55am, SI Tay escorted the accused out of the Unit with all the seized exhibits in his custody.29Foot Note 29×AB 272 (para 17). (i) At about 2am, in the accused’s presence, SI Tay placed all the seized exhibits into the boot of the CNB operational car.30Foot Note 30×AB 272 (para 18). (j) From 2am to 2.30am, the black duffel bag was in the boot of the CNB operational car and nobody opened the car boot until the car reached CNB HQ.Thereafter, SI Tay brought the black duffel bag up to CNB “A” office and kept the black duffel bag beside him in the CNB “A” office from 2.35am to 3.50am.31Foot Note 31×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 80 line 24 to p 81 line 11. (k) At about 4.09am, SI Tay handed over all the seized exhibits to ASP Yang at the Exhibit Management Room.32Foot Note 32×AB 273 (para 23); AB 354 (para 10); 15 July 2021 Transcript at p 27 lines 12–16.ASP Yang then cross-checked the exhibits against a police report filed by Sergeant Muhammad Fauzi bin Mohamed Said (“Sgt Fauzi”).33Foot Note 33×15 July 2021 Transcript at p 28 lines 1–18. (l) On 22 November 2018 at about 1pm, ASP Yang handed over custody of the exhibits to Sgt Goh at the Exhibit Management Room.34Foot Note 34×AB 358 (para 28).Sgt Goh then kept the exhibits in a locked cupboard.35Foot Note 35×AB 11 (para 2). (m) On 23 November 2018 at about 10.49am, Sgt Goh retrieved the drug exhibits (including the 25 exhibits constituting the Drugs) and submitted them to the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA for analysis.36Foot Note 36×AB 11 (para 4).The Drugs were analysed by Mr Koh, who later issued certificates setting out the results of his analysis.37Foot Note 37×AB 65–114. (n) On 26 March 2019, at about 2.23pm, Sgt Goh collected 25 case exhibits (ie, the 25 packets constituting the Drugs) from the Illicit Drugs Laboratory, and deposited the same in the CNB Operations Planning Store for safekeeping.38Foot Note 38×AB 12–13 (para 7). 23 Having reviewed the evidence, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proven a complete chain of custody in relation to the Drugs. In particular, I accept the Prosecution’s submissions at [22(a)]–[22(k)] above, as the evidence of the respective witnesses which sets out this part of the chain of custody (ie, the parts of their testimonies and conditioned statements which the Prosecution relies on) was entirely within their personal knowledge. Those parts of their evidence withstood scrutiny under cross-examination and remain cogent, credible and internally and externally consistent. I elaborate. (a) In court, Sgt Hidayat maintained that he had personal knowledge of the descriptions of the exhibits seized from the accused’s bedroom listed in paragraph nine of his conditioned statement, because he was the one who searched the accused’s bedroom and seized those exhibits.39Foot Note 39×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 48 lines 3–16 and p 49 lines 28–29.This position remains unshaken even when questioned by this court.40Foot Note 40×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 52 lines 6–9.The accuracy of paragraph nine of Sgt Hidayat’s conditioned statement is bolstered by his repeated confirmation in court that before he signed his conditioned statement, he cross-checked the descriptions of the seized exhibits in paragraph nine against the field diary,41Foot Note 41×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 53 lines 13–28 and p 56 lines 10–26.which contains a contemporaneous record of the exhibits which were seized from the accused’s bedroom.42Foot Note 42×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 48 lines 13–18; 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 96 lines 3–11 and 23–27.It bears mentioning that six of the seized exhibits described at paragraph nine of Sgt Hidayat’s conditioned statement correspond to exhibits D4 to D9. (b) SI Alwin stated in his conditioned statement that he assisted Sgt Hidayat in packing and sealing the exhibits seized from the accused’s bedroom into Tamper-Proof Bags.43Foot Note 43×AB 281 (para 10).This is corroborated by Sgt Hidayat’s oral testimony.44Foot Note 44×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 48 lines 6–8. (c) SSgt Low testified that after the seized exhibits were packed and sealed into Tamper-Proof Bags, he and SI Alwin checked the seized exhibits against the field diary before placing all the seized exhibits into the black duffel bag.45Foot Note 45×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 97 lines 4–15.SSgt Low affirmed that the exhibits seized from the accused’s bedroom were placed into the black duffel bag even when pressed under cross-examination.46Foot Note 46×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 98 lines 6–18.Buttressing this is SI Tay’s testimony that after the seized exhibits were packed and sealed into Tamper-Proof Bags, they were placed into the black duffel bag. SI Tay was present in the accused’s bedroom at the material time because his role was to escort the accused while the search and seizure was ongoing.47Foot Note 47×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 71 line 29 to p 73 line 5, p 85 lines 3–11 (read with AB 270-271 (para 10)), p 86 lines 18–28. (d) According to SI Alwin, at about 9.50pm, he handed overallthe seized exhibits found in the accused’s bedroom to SI Eugene.48Foot Note 48×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 54 lines 2–10; AB 282 (para 11).In the light of [23(c)] above, the seized exhibits were handed to SI Eugene in the black duffel bag. This is reinforced by SI Tay’s testimony that he witnessed SI Alwin handing over the black duffel bag to SI Eugene,49Foot Note 49×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 72 line 26 to p 73 line 5.as well as SI Eugene’s testimony that he received the black duffel bag from SI Alwin.50Foot Note 50×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 9 lines 24–28. (e) SI Eugene testified that at 10.31pm, he handed the black duffel bag to SI Tay.51Foot Note 51×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 16 lines 12–16.This is corroborated by SI Tay’s and SI Alwin’s evidence: SI Tay stated in his conditioned statement that SI Eugene handed all the exhibits to him at 10.31pm,52Foot Note 52×AB 272 (para 12).and SI Alwin testified that he saw SI Eugene handing over the black duffel bag to SI Tay at 10.31pm.53Foot Note 53×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 61 lines 1–7. (f) SI Eugene also gave evidence that at 11pm, SI Tay handed him the black duffel bag so that he could record the Contemporaneous Statement from the accused.54Foot Note 54×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 9 lines 29–32; AB 289 (para 14).This was confirmed by SI Tay.55Foot Note 55×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 68 lines 23–30; AB 272 (para 13).Up until this point in time, there is no evidence that any of the exhibits seized from the accused’s bedroom were removed from the black duffel bag. (g) However, when SI Eugene asked the accused question one of the Contemporaneous Statement, SI Eugene took out Tamper-Proof Bags, containing exhibits D5 to D9, from the black duffel bag and showed them to the accused. SI Eugene’s evidence in this regard is consistent across his examination-in-chief and cross-examination.56Foot Note 56×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 10 line 15 to p 11 line 3 and p 17 line 27 to p 18 line 1. (h) SI Eugene testified in cross-examination that he placed the Tamper-Proof Bags, containing exhibits D5 to D9, back into the black duffel bag before asking question three in the Contemporaneous Statement.57Foot Note 57×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 18 lines 15–18.There is no reason to disbelieve SI Eugene’s testimony, especially since the exhibits which eventually made it to the Exhibit Management Room ultimately tallied with what is recorded in the field diary (see below at [23(n)]). (i) According to SI Eugene’s conditioned statement, after recording the accused’s Contemporaneous Statement at about 12.05am on 21 November 2018, he (SI Eugene) then handed over all the seized exhibits to SI Tay.58Foot Note 58×AB 289 (para 15).This is corroborated by SI Tay, who testified that SI Eugene handed over the black duffel bag to him after he (SI Eugene) had recorded the Contemporaneous Statement.59Foot Note 59×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 80 lines 10–14. (j) It is stated in SI Tay’s conditioned statement that at 1.55am, SI Tay, together with SSgt Low and SSgt Nurshila, escorted the accused out of the Unit, during which time SI Tay was holding on to all the seized exhibits.60Foot Note 60×AB 272 (para 17).This is supported by SSgt Low’s and SSgt Nurshila’s evidence that they saw SI Tay holding on to the black duffel bag at 1.55am.61Foot Note 61×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 101 lines 21–27; 2 July 2021 Transcript at p 35 line 31 to p 36 line 6. (k) SI Tay also stated in his conditioned statement that at 2.00am, he placed all the seized exhibits and the accused’s personal properties into the car boot of the CNB operational vehicle.62Foot Note 62×AB 272 (para 18).In his oral testimony, SI Tay clarified that he placed the black duffel bag, containing all the seized exhibits and the accused’s personal property, into the car boot.63Foot Note 63×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 79 line 21 to p 80 line 3.This coheres with SSgt Nurshila’s testimony that she saw SI Tay placing the black duffel bag into the boot.64Foot Note 64×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 37 lines 21–29. (l) SI Tay testified that from 2.00 to 2.30am, the black duffel bag was in the boot of the CNB operational vehicle, and that while he was inside the CNB operational vehicle, nobody opened the car boot until they reached CNB HQ.65Foot Note 65×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 80 lines 18–30.This is confirmed by SSgt Nurshila’s oral evidence,66Foot Note 66×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 38 lines 3–8.who was in the said CNB operational vehicle at the material time.67Foot Note 67×AB 276 (para 12). (m) SI Tay gave evidence that after the CNB operational vehicle reached CNB HQ at 2.30am, he brought the black duffel bag up to the CNB “A” office and kept the black duffel bag beside him in the CNB “A” office the entire time he was there.68Foot Note 68×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 80 line 31 to p 81 line 11; AB 272–273 (para 19).I observe that there is a minor discrepancy between SI Tay’s testimony and his conditioned statement as to the time at which he (and other CNB officers) escorted the accused out of the CNB “A” office. SI Tay’s testimony indicates that he was in the CNB “A” office until 3.50am before he (and other CNB officers) escorted the accused to the Exhibit Management Room.69Foot Note 69×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 81 lines 1–15.However, SI Tay’s conditioned statement indicates that at about 3.45am, he (and other CNB officers) had escorted the accused out of the CNB “A” office and arrived at the Exhibit Management Room at about 3.50am.70Foot Note 70×AB 273 (para 22).The Defence has not relied on this discrepancy in its written submissions. In my judgment, this slight discrepancy as to timing in no way affects the overall consistency of SI Tay’s evidence and the chain of custody. It is clear that the black duffel bag was in SI Tay’s custody the whole time he was in the CNB “A” office,71Foot Note 71×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 81 lines 1–11.after which, SI Tay (along with a few other CNB officers) escorted the accused from the CNB “A” office to the Exhibit Management Room.72Foot Note 72×AB 273 (para 22); 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 81 lines 12–15. (n) According to both SI Tay and ASP Yang, SI Tay handed over all the seized exhibits to ASP Yang at about 4.09am in the Exhibit Management Room.73Foot Note 73×AB 273 (para 23); 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 82 lines 3–8; AB 354 (para 10); 15 July 2021 Transcript at p 27 lines 12–16.ASP Yang testified that he cross-checked the exhibits against the police report filed by Sgt Fauzi.74Foot Note 74×15 July 2021 Transcript at p 28 lines 1–18.In this connection, Sgt Fauzi testified that the descriptions of the exhibits in his police report were copied “word-for-word” from the field diary.75Foot Note 75×13 July 2021 Transcript at p 13 lines 25–28 and p 14 lines 19–24.Accordingly, the seized exhibits which SI Tay handed to ASP Yang ultimately tallied with what was recorded in the field diary. The Defence did not put to Sgt Fauzi that the contents of the police report were inaccurate or materially different from the entries in the field diary. For completeness, I also accept the Prosecution’s submissions at [22(l)]–[22(n)] above, which are supported by evidence. 24 Against this, the Defence made several arguments seeking to undermine the integrity of the chain of custody. I now turn to consider these arguments.",
        "Issues raised by the Defence": "25 The Defence submits that: (a) The conditioned statements of SI Tay, SSgt Low, Sgt Yogaraj and ASP Yang are inadmissible because they were prepared by a third party and contain substantial matters which are not within their personal knowledge.76Foot Note 76×DS at para 60(1). (b) Even if the conditioned statements of SI Tay, SSgt Low, Sgt Yogaraj and ASP Yang are admissible, parts of their conditioned statements and testimonies should be excluded because they are hearsay. Parts of their evidence are also based on assumptions and should be given zero weight.77Foot Note 77×DS at para 110.Similarly, parts of the evidence in the respective conditioned statements and oral testimonies of SI Eugene, SI Alwin, Sgt Fauzi, Sgt Hidayat, SSgt Au Yong, SSgt Nurshila, SSSgt Fardlie and Inspector Nur Yusyeila binte Yunus (“Insp Nur Yusyeila”) contain hearsay and should be excluded. Parts of their evidence are also based on assumptions and should be given zero weight.78Foot Note 78×DS at paras 125–158. (c) There are discrepancies in the CNB witnesses’ accounts concerning the seizure and handling of the drug exhibits in the accused’s bedroom and in the Exhibit Management Room:79Foot Note 79×DS at paras 159–174 and 177. (i) After the Tamper-Proof Bags were sealed, there is no corroborated evidence proving that the exhibits were cross-checked against the list of exhibits supposedly seized and recorded in the field diary, before the Tamper-Proof Bags were placed into the black duffel bag. (ii) There are also inconsistencies in the CNB officers’ statements and testimonies as to whether SI Eugene and SSgt Low were present in the accused’s bedroom at the time of search and seizure. (iii) At the Exhibit Management Room, the exhibits were checked against the police report filed by Sgt Fauzi, but that report was prepared based on hearsay. No one cross-checked the exhibits or the contents of the police report against the field diary. There is also discrepancy as to who did the cross-checking of the exhibits against the police report. The Defence contends that if this courts accepts the foregoing submissions, there would be no evidence which establishes, beyond a reasonable doubt, how the drug exhibits were handled beyond the sealing of the tamper-proof bags.80Foot Note 80×DS at para 176. 26 The Defence makes two additional points. First, the Defence claims that after SI Eugene took over the black duffel bag, no one had personal knowledge as to what exactly the items inside that bag were.81Foot Note 81×DS at para 177.2.Second, relying on the presence of FORT Officer Yee Hui Ping’s (“Officer Yee”) DNA on exhibit D7B, the Defence argues that Officer Yee did not adhere to protocol. It is also submitted that the presence of her DNA on exhibit D7B contaminated the physical evidence, such that it is no longer reliable and safe to include that exhibit as part of the Charge.82Foot Note 82×DS at paras 178–180. 27 In my judgment, none of these submissions raises a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. 28 I deal first with the Defence’s submission that the conditioned statements of SI Tay, SSgt Low, Sgt Yogaraj and ASP Yang should be inadmissible in theirentirety(see above at [25(a)]). This submission merits greater elaboration. 29 The Defence urges this court to adopt a rule that stipulates that where a witness’s conditioned statement is prepared or reviewed by a third party before trial, and contains substantial matters that are not within that witness’s personal knowledge, that conditioned statement should be excluded because it is contaminated and unreliable.83Foot Note 83×DS at paras 61 and 83. 30 In support of this rule, the Defence cites the English Court of Appeal case ofR vMomodou[2005] EWCA Crim 177 (“Momodou”) which sets out principles prohibiting witness training in criminal proceedings (the “MomodouPrinciples”).84Foot Note 84×DS at paras 62–64.Reference is also made to the Singapore Court of Appeal case ofErnest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala vCompañia De Navegación Palomar, SA and others and other appeals[2018] 1 SLR 894 (“Ernest Ferdinand”), which adopted theMomodouPrinciples in civil litigation cases, albeit with some modifications(the “ModifiedMomodouPrinciples”).85Foot Note 85×DS at paras 66–69.The Defence submits that the ModifiedMomodouPrinciples should apply in the context of criminal proceedings as well,86Foot Note 86×DS at para 70.and contends that allowing a third party to prepare or review a witness’s conditioned statement would amount to a breach of the ModifiedMomodouPrinciples because it would be akin to training or coaching that witness as to what evidence to give by way of the conditioned statement. The Defence submits that unless the witness provides a cogent explanation as to why a third party prepared or reviewed his conditioned statement, and what steps were taken to avoid influencing the witness’s evidence, the evidence in the conditioned statement is contaminated. Further, when substantial portions of the conditioned statement are not within the witness’s personal knowledge, the conditioned statement becomes unreliable.87Foot Note 87×DS at para 82. 31 The Defence then argues that evidence given in breach of the ModifiedMomodouPrinciples should be rendered inadmissible altogether due to the prejudicial effect of such contaminated evidence.88Foot Note 88×DS at para 77.To support this point, the Defence submits that the majority reasoning inRegina v H[1995]2 AC 596 (“Rv H”) supports the proposition that evidence that is contaminated and shown to be unreliable is susceptible to be excluded.89Foot Note 89×DS at paras 71–78.Much emphasis is placed on Lord Mackay’s decision inR v H. 32 I am unable to accept the Defence’s submissions. 33 I begin by outlining the salient principles: (a) At their core, theMomodouPrinciples are directed at ensuring that witnessesgive their ownuncontaminated evidenceto the court. This is likewise the nub of the ModifiedMomodouPrinciples (borrowing the Defence’s terminology) developed inErnest Ferdinand. (b) It follows from this that there is nothing inherently impermissible for an officer to prepare or review a conditioned statement on behalf of a CNB officer who was part of the drug raid based either on the self-statement of that officer or on facts gathered in a meeting with that officer. As long as a CNB officer’s conditioned statement ultimately contains that CNB officer’s own account of events, the conditioned statement would still consist of the CNB officer’s own evidence. (c) Less weight (or even no weight) is placed on the witness’s testimony if it transpires that the witness’s evidence is not his own:Ernest Ferdinandat [136]–[137]. 34 I now elaborate on the first proposition at [33(a)] above, which forms the foundation for the second. The essence of the principles laid down inMomodouis neatly encapsulated inErnest Ferdinandat [134]: 134 … TheMomodouprinciples were formulated in the context of criminal proceedings in England, and they provide thatit is important to ensure that theevidence given by a witness is the witness’s own uncontaminated evidence, and that, consequently, the training or coaching of witnesses – whether one-to-one or in a group – is impermissible. … [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] The Court of Appeal endorsed this fundamental point and emphatically held that: 136 … The line thatmustnotbe crossedis this: the witness’s evidencemust remainhis own. 137 … The ultimate question is … whether the preparation has compromised the fundamental principle that the witness’s evidence must be his own independent testimony. [emphasis in original] From this, the Court of Appeal inErnest Ferdinandat [137]–[140] derived further rules that elucidate what is permissible and what is not in the course of witness preparation. One such rule is that the solicitor, in preparing a witness for a civil trial, must not allow other persons, including the solicitor himself, to supplant or supplement that witness’s own evidence. 35 The fundamental principle that the witness’s evidence must be his own applies equally when that evidence is in the form of a conditioned statement. Section 264 of the CPC provides that a witness’s conditioned statement, if admitted, is to be treated as if it is oral evidence given by that same witness: 264.—(1) Despite anything in this Code or in any other written law, a written statement made by any person isadmissible as evidencein any criminal proceeding,to the same extent and to the same effect as oral evidence given by the person, if the following conditions are satisfied: … [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] The practical benefit of s 264 of the CPC is that conditioned statements can be used to admit the evidence of formal witnesses, whose evidence is unlikely to be challenged, in order to expedite the trial process: seeModern Advocacy– More Perspectives from Singapore(Eleanor Wong, Lok Vi Ming SC and Vinodh Coomaraswamy, gen eds) (Academy Publishing, 2019) at para 06.057.90Foot Note 90×Defence’s Bundle of Authorities, Tab 16.Nevertheless, conditioned statements are admissible to the same extent and carry the same effect as oral evidence. As it is implicit under s 62(1) of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) that oral evidence must be the witness’s own, this same principle must equally apply to conditioned statements. 36 In the present case, whether a conditioned statement contains that CNB officer’s own evidence would depend on whetherthat conditioned statement reflects the CNB officer’s own account of events. Having another officer prepare or review the CNB officer’s conditioned statement, as stated at [33(b)] above, is not an objectionable practicein itself. It only becomes objectionable if the conditioned statement departs from the CNB officer’s own account of events. Accordingly, I am unable to accept the Defence’s submission that allowing a third party to prepare or review a witness’s conditioned statement would be akin to training or coaching the witness as to what evidence to give. This sweeping proposition is not supported by any principle or logic. Much would depend on whether the resulting conditioned statement still reflects that CNB officer’s own account of events. As acknowledged by the Court of Appeal inErnest Ferdinandat [134], whether the evidence is the witness’s own is afact-specific inquiry. For the same reason, it is not appropriate to lay down any hard and fast rule that unless the witness provides a cogent explanation as to why a third party prepared or reviewed his conditioned statement, and what steps were taken to avoid influencing the witness’s evidence, the evidence in the conditioned statement is contaminated, as advocated for by the Defence. 37 As for the consequence of a breach of theMomodouPrinciples and the ModifiedMomodouPrinciples, I am unable to accept the Defence’s contention that such a breach should affect the admissibility of the evidence and not its weight. This sits at odds with the holding of the Court of Appeal inErnest Ferdinandat [136]–[137], which contemplates the converse: 136 … The line that must not be crossed is this: the witness’s evidence must remain his own. 137 From this simple principle, at least three rules follow,the breach of whichmay– depending on all the circumstances – lead the court to accordless weight (or even no weight)to the resulting testimony. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics; emphasis in original omitted] Hence, the Court of Appeal indicates that a breach of the ModifiedMomodouPrinciples will affect theweightof the evidence, instead of its admissibility. This is reinforced by the fact that the possibility of ascribing no weight to the evidence is expressly canvassed in lieu of excluding the evidence altogether. 38 The Defence’s submission that contaminated evidence should be rendered inadmissible altogether rests on Lord Mackay’s decision inR v H. However, that decision does not assist the Defence. In that case, the accused was charged with sexual offences against two girls living with him in the same house. It was accepted that there was a risk that both girls had colluded to make false allegations against the accused. Against these facts, Lord Mackay was concerned with two legal issues. The first was whether evidence could be admitted as similar fact evidence, and secondly,supposing the evidence was admissible, whether it could be used as corroboration of the evidence of the witnesses supporting the allegation in issue, having regard to the admitted risk of collusion (R v Hat 603). Lord Mackay held that collusion is generally not relevant at the stage of deciding whether to exclude evidence on the ground that it does not qualify as similar fact evidence. In relation to the second question, he held that if similar fact evidence has been admitted, but no reasonable jury could accept the evidence as free from collusion, the judge should direct the jury that it cannot be relied upon as corroboration. Where this is not so but the question of collusion has been raised, the judge must draw the importance of collusion to the attention of the jury and leave it to them to decide whether such evidence can be relied upon as free from collusion and tell them that if they are not so satisfied they cannot rely on it as corroboration (R v Hat 612). Leaving aside the question of the relevance ofR v H,as neither the issue of admissibility of similar fact evidence nor the issue of corroboration is engaged, the broad proposition relied upon by the Defence, that evidence that iscontaminatedand shown to beunreliableis susceptible to be excluded, does not assist the Defence in its attempt to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. 39 This is because the conditioned statements of SI Tay, SSgt Low and ASP Yang were, in the first place, not contaminated within the meaning of theMomodouPrinciples and the ModifiedMomodouPrinciples. In other words, their conditioned statements contained their own account of events. Even though SI Tay, SSgt Low and ASP Yang admitted that a person known as “the IO” had drafted their conditioned statements on their behalf based on self-statements given by them,91Foot Note 91×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 85 lines 3–27, p 89 lines 15–16 and p 90 lines 21–22; 2 July 2021 Transcript at p 5 lines 1–4; 15 July 2021 Transcript at p 32 lines 7–17.SI Tay, SSgt Low and ASP Yang signed their respective conditioned statements declaring that the contents therein were true to the best of their respective knowledge and belief.92Foot Note 92×AB 273, 309, 320 and 365.In court, these three officers also confirmed that the signatures on their respective conditioned statements were theirs and that the contents therein were accurate.93Foot Note 93×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 68 lines 11–17 and p 89 lines 12–21; 2 July 2021 Transcript at p 2 lines 13–23; 15 July 2021 Transcript at p 2 lines 18–24 and p 44 lines 7–12. 40 SI Tay, SSgt Low and ASP Yang further testified that before appending their respective signatures, they read their respective conditioned statements and ensured that they were accurate in substance.94Foot Note 94×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 68 lines 11–13, p 70 lines 12–26, p 88 lines 3–8, p 89 lines 12–14, p 91 line 25 to p 92 line 14 and p 103 lines 7–13; 15 July 2021 Transcript at p 2 lines 18–24 and p 44 lines 7–15.In particular, SI Tay verified the accuracy of the conditioned statement by comparing it with his own self-statement and the field diary,95Foot Note 95×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 70 lines 12–26.while SSgt Low checked that his conditioned statement was true and correct by comparing it with his own self-statement.96Foot Note 96×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 91 line 25 to p 92 line 14.More care could have been taken by SI Tay and ASP Yang in checking through their conditioned statements for typographical errors,97Foot Note 97×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 69 lines 1–8; 15 July 2021 Transcript at p 29 line 9 to p 30 line 22.but there is nothing to suggest that a third party has supplemented or supplanted thesubstanceof their evidence. 41 Indeed, parts of the conditioned statements of SI Tay and SSgt Low refer to matters not within their personal knowledge.98Foot Note 98×AB 270 (para 10) read with 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 87 lines 8–20; AB 272 (para 13) read with 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 75 lines 12–27; AB 320 (para 12) read with 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 98 line 30 to p 99 line 7.However, these are insufficient to suggest that “the IO” had supplanted or supplemented the conditioned statements of SI Tay or SSgt Low, because both SI Tay and SSgt Low were able to explain that they came to know of these matters, which were not initially within their personal knowledge, by reading the field diary or from what other officers had told them.99Foot Note 99×AB 270 (para 10) read with 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 87 lines 8–20; AB 272 (para 13) read with 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 75 lines 12–27; AB 320 (para 12) read with 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 98 line 30 to p 99 line 7.In other words, SI Tay and SSgt Low are still putting forward their own account of events, even though their understanding and narration of what had happened is premised on secondary sources. 42 Hence, I reject the Defence’s argument that the conditioned statements of SI Tay, SSgt Low and ASP Yang are contaminated. 43 As for Sgt Yogaraj’s conditioned statement, the Prosecution is not relying on it to establish an unbroken chain of custody. The question of whether Sgt Yogaraj’s conditioned statement should be excluded therefore does not arise. I nevertheless observe in passing that Sgt Yogaraj admitted that the information contained in paragraphs nine and ten of his conditioned statement was not in his self-statement. This indicates that the IO who prepared Sgt Yogaraj’s conditioned statement had inserted the information on his or her own accord, and there is no evidence before me as to where the IO had obtained the information if it was not previously in Sgt Yogaraj’s self-statement. In these circumstances, paragraphs nine and ten, should not have been included in Sgt Yogaraj’s conditioned statement. This observation, however, does not detract from the fact that Sgt Yogaraj’s conditioned statement is immaterial to the Prosecution’s case, and accordingly my evidential analysis, of whether the chain of custody has been established beyond a reasonable doubt. 44 I now turn to consider the Defence’s second submission at [25(b)] above. While the Defence is right in pointing out that parts of the conditioned statements of SI Tay and SSgt Low refer to matters outside their personal knowledge,100Foot Note 100×AB 270 (para 10) read with 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 87 lines 8–20; AB 272 (para 13) read with 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 75 lines 12–27; AB 320 (para 12) read with 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 98 line 30 to p 99 line 7; 2 July 2021 Transcript at p 5 line 18 to p 8 line 10; AB 309.and that parts of SI Tay’s evidence are based on his personal assumptions,101Foot Note 101×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 72 line 22 to p 75 line 9, p 76 line 25 to p 78 line 13 and p 82 line 20 to p 83 line 1.these matters are not being relied upon by the Prosecution to establish the chain of custody. The same goes for parts of the evidence given by SI Eugene, SI Alwin, Sgt Fauzi, Sgt Hidayat, SSgt Au Yong, SSgt Nurshila, SSSgt Fardlie and Insp Nur Yusyeila which are not within their respective personal knowledge and which are based on their personal assumptions. There is thus no need to take into account these affected parts in the evidential analysis. 45 As I have shown at [23] above, all the evidence relied upon to build the chain of custody is squarely in the respective CNB officers’ personal knowledge. The affected pieces of evidence at [44] above do not impact on the Prosecution’s ability to establish an unbroken chain of custody. Hence, despite the Defence’s strenuous effort in advancing its submissions set out at [25(a)] and [25(b)] above, I am unable to accept that they raise a reasonable doubt in the chain of custody. 46 I now consider the Defence’s submission set out at [25(c)] above. Here, the Defence raised several concerns regarding the seizure and handling of the drug exhibits, none of which are sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the chain of custody of the Drugs. One of these concerns is the presence of alleged inconsistencies in the CNB officers’ statements and testimonies as to whether SI Eugene and SSgt Low were present in the accused’s bedroom at the time of search and seizure.102Foot Note 102×DS at paras 160–166.As the Prosecution correctly points out,103Foot Note 103×PRS at para 38.nothing turns on this point. Even if there are indeed inconsistencies on this point, they do not impugn the integrity of the chain of custody as set out by the Prosecution. 47 The Defence also raises the concern that SSgt Low’s claim that he checked the seized exhibits against the field diary together with SI Alwin remains uncorroborated by other CNB officers who were present in the accused’s bedroom at the material time.104Foot Note 104×DS at paras 163–166 and 168; 1 July 2021 Transcript at p 97 lines 4–13.However, corroborative evidence is unnecessary especially given the absence of evidence undermining the veracity of SSgt Low’s claim. SI Alwin, who assisted Sgt Hidayat in packing and sealing the exhibits seized from the accused’s bedroom, was silent as to whether he and SSgt Low checked the items against the field diary. Sgt Hidayat could not remember if SSgt Low was in the accused’s bedroom during the search and also could not remember who was holding on to the field diary.105Foot Note 105×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 48 lines 3–26.He also did not see SI Alwin cross-checking the exhibits against the field diary.106Foot Note 106×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 49 lines 24–31.But all these are unsurprising given that Sgt Hidayat was busy conducting the search and seizure. SI Eugene who was sometimes in the accused’s bedroom and sometimes outside the accused’s bedroom,107Foot Note 107×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 14 lines 4–6.did not see SSgt Low checking the exhibits against the field diary,108Foot Note 108×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 16 lines 2–5.but this is insufficient to cast doubt on SSgt Low’s claim since SI Eugene was in the accused’s bedroom only for pockets of time. 48 In any event, I agree with the Prosecution that even if the CNB officers did not check the drug exhibits against the field diary, this would be insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the chain of custody. This is because the movement of the drug exhibits is still well-accounted for: there is sufficient evidence proving that after the exhibits seized from the accused’s bedroom were packed and sealed into Tamper-Proof Bags, the seized exhibits were packed into the black duffel bag, and SI Alwin handed the black duffel bag containing the seized exhibits to SI Eugene (see at [23(b)]–[23(d)] above). 49 This brings me to the next point. In view of the evidence at [23(c)] above, the Defence’s claim that no one could attest to what happened between the time after the Tamper-Proof Bags were sealed and the time that the Tamper-Proof Bags were allegedly put into the black duffel bag,109Foot Note 109×DS at para 167.is not correct. On a related note, the Defence also alleges that after SI Eugene took over the black duffel bag, no one had personal knowledge as to what the items inside that bag were.110Foot Note 110×DS at para 177.2.This allegation is equally meritless in attempting to raise a reasonable doubt in the chain of custody. What is important is that after SI Alwin handed over the black duffel bag to SI Eugene, and before SI Tay handed over the seized exhibits one by one to ASP Yang at the Exhibit Management Room, there is no evidence that any of the seized exhibits were removed from the black duffel bag, except when SI Eugene took out five black packets (ie, exhibits D5 to D9) when recording the accused’s Contemporaneous Statement. Even then, SI Eugene placed those exhibits back into the black duffel bag after the Contemporaneous Statement was recorded.111Foot Note 111×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 17 line 31 to p 18 line 18. 50 Turning now to the handling of the seized exhibits at the Exhibit Management Room, the Defence raises three concerns. The Defence observes that no one at the Exhibit Management Room cross-checked the exhibits or the police report against the field diary.112Foot Note 112×DCS at paras 169–173.I find this immaterial and incapable of raising any reasonable doubt in the chain of custody. ASP Yang testified that at the Exhibit Management Room, he cross-checked the exhibits against the police report filed by Sgt Fauzi.113Foot Note 113×15 July 2021 Transcript at p 28 lines 15–16.Sgt Fauzi testified that the descriptions of the exhibits which appeared in his police report were copied “word-for-word” from the field diary.114Foot Note 114×13 July 2021 Transcript at p 13 lines 25–28 and p 14 lines 19–24.In the circumstances, as the Prosecution argues,115Foot Note 115×PRS at para 49.it is sufficient for ASP Yang to have cross-checked the exhibits against the police report. I also note that the Defence did not put to Sgt Fauzi that the contents of the police report were inaccurate or materially different from the entries in the field diary. 51 Next, the Defence claims that there is a discrepancy in the evidence given by Insp Nur Yusyeila, Officer Yee and ASP Yang as to who carried out the cross-checking of the exhibits against the police report filed by Sgt Fauzi.116Foot Note 116×DS at paras 174 and 177.3.I set out the evidence of Insp Nur Yusyeila and Officer Yee below and explain why this discrepancy alleged by the Defence is illusory: (a) Insp Nur Yusyeila’s testimony is that she did not check the exhibits against the field diary or the police report filed by Sgt Fauzi. She was unable to recall whether ASP Yang checked the exhibits against either document.117Foot Note 117×13 July 2021 Transcript at p 55 line 31 to p 56 line 4.This does not support but neither does it contradict ASP Yang’s testimony that he cross-checked the exhibits against the police report. In this connection, the Defence makes the point that Insp Nur Yusyeila did not cross-check against any list even though Sgt Fauzi said that the officer assisting the Investigation Officer (ie, ASP Yang) would do so together with the Investigation Officer.118Foot Note 118×DS at para 174.Sgt Fauzi did not make such a claim. What Sgt Fauzi said was that the Investigation Officer “and the official that hand over the items to the [Investigation Officer]” would do the cross-checking.119Foot Note 119×13 July 2021 Transcript at p 13 line 29 to p 14 line 1.As Insp Nur Yusyeila was not the officer who handed the exhibits over to ASP Yang, it is unsurprising that she did not partake in any cross-checking. (b) When Officer Yee was asked whether she saw ASP Yang going through any document listing out the exhibits which were seized, Officer Yee replied that “[t]o the best of [her] knowledge”, she saw the “arresting officer” cross-checking the exhibits against the police report before passing all the exhibits to ASP Yang.120Foot Note 120×14 July 2021 Transcript at p 61 lines 1–11.While Officer Yee does not know who this “arresting officer” was,121Foot Note 121×14 July 2021 Transcript at p 61 lines 5–6.the “arresting officer” must have been SI Tay as he was the one who handed over all the exhibits to ASP Yang.122Foot Note 122×AB 273 (para 23); AB 354 (para 10); 15 July 2021 Transcript at p 27 lines 12–16.However, SI Tay’s evidence is silent as to whether he cross-checked the exhibits against the police report before passing them to ASP Yang. SI Alwin, SSgt Nurshila and Sergeant Syazwan Bin Daud Mohamed were also present in the Exhibit Management Room at the material time and witnessed SI Tay handing over the exhibits to ASP Yang, but they did not expressly mention that SI Tay cross-checked the exhibits against the police report before passing them to ASP Yang.123Foot Note 123×1 July 2021 Transcript at p 65 lines 2–25; 2 July 2021 Transcript at p 39 line 31 to p 40 line 21; AB 337 (paras 4–5).In any event, even if I accept Officer Yee’s evidence that the “arresting officer”, which in the circumstances must have been a reference to SI Tay, cross-checked the exhibits against the police report before passing all the exhibits to ASP Yang, her evidence still does not undermine ASP Yang’s evidence, as ASP Yang did not claim that he was theonlyone who cross-checked the exhibits against the police report filed by Sgt Fauzi. In fact, Officer Yee’s evidence is compatible with Sgt Fauzi’s evidence that it would be the Investigation Officer “and the official [who] hand over the items to the [Investigation Officer]” who would do the cross-checking.124Foot Note 124×13 July 2021 Transcript at p 13 line 29 to p 14 line 1.Hence, it is plausible that both the “arresting officer” and ASP Yang cross-checked the exhibits against the police report. In any event, it is sufficient for ASP Yang alone to have cross-checked the exhibits against the police report. 52 Lastly, the Defence urges this court to infer that Officer Yee did not adhere to protocol and, as a result, to exclude exhibit D7B from the Charge, on the basis that her DNA was found on the exterior of exhibit D7B.125Foot Note 125×DS at paras 178–180.I reject the Defence’s submissions on this point. On 21 November 2018 at about 4.09am, Officer Yee was at the Exhibit Management Room swabbing the exterior of various exhibits, including exhibits D7A1, D7B1, D7C1 and D7D1, under the directions of ASP Yang.126Foot Note 126×AB 2 at para 4.She testified that she was wearing gloves throughout the swabbing process.127Foot Note 127×14 July 2021 Transcript at p 57 lines 8–10.As noted by the expert witness, Ms Tang Sheau Wei June, there are a few plausible explanations for why Officer Yee’s DNA was found on the exterior of exhibit D7B: (a) she had come into direct contact with exhibit D7B, (b) she had talked, coughed or sneezed nearby, or (c) she had previously touched another person’s hand and that person transferred her DNA onto exhibit D7B.128Foot Note 128×14 July 2021 Transcript at p 20 lines 20–29.It would be a leap of logic to infer that Officer Yee did not follow protocol just from the mere presence of her DNA on the exterior of exhibit D7B. It is also hard to see how the presence of Officer Yee’s DNA on theexteriorof exhibit D7B could be said to have “contaminated” the Drugs.129Foot Note 129×DS at para 180.Lastly, as the Prosecution has observed,130Foot Note 130×PRS at paras 59 and 61.the allegation that Officer Yee deviated from protocol in the Exhibit Management Room was not put to her during the trial, and it is also not the Defence’s case that Officer Yee had tampered with exhibit D7B. The presence of Officer Yee’s DNA on the exterior of exhibit D7B is therefore neither here nor there.",
        "Accuracy of the accused’s statements": "53 It is claimed, by the Defence in its submissions and at trial, that various parts of the accused’s statements were recorded and/or interpreted inaccurately: (a) Contemporaneous Statement (the “Disputed Portions of the Contemporaneous Statement”): (i) The accused was shown five black packets131Foot Note 131×AB at 291 at A1; 2 July 2021 Transcript at p 10 line 15 to p 11 line 6.and was asked at Q3 why these were with him. The accused’s answer at A3 reads: “Alan asked me to keep. He will ask me to pass it to others”. The accused claims that what he said (in Mandarin) was: “Alan asked me to keep for him first. Within a month, he would ask his man to take them from me”.132Foot Note 132×DS at para 47. (ii) In response to Q17, which asked the accused how much he would earn for “doing such things”, the accused’s answer at A17 reads: “When I need money, I will ask from Alan. Each time he will give me $200 – $300”. The accused claims that what he said (in Mandarin) was: “No, I did not. I was just helping out” and “If I needed money, I would ask from him, and I would ask about 2, 3 hundred dollars. A few days later, I would return him the money”.133Foot Note 133×DS at para 52. (b) At paragraph 12 of the 1st Long Statement, the accused was recorded as having said: “Since then, I have been receiving ‘drugs’ on ‘Alan’ behalf [sic]”. The accused claims that what he said (in Mandarin) was: “Since then, I have been keeping grass and red wine for Alan”, as well as “ice” and “k”.134Foot Note 134×DS at para 61.3. (c) At paragraph 31 of the 3rd Long Statement, the accused was recorded as having said: “I will use the notebooks to note down what ‘drugs’ I helped ‘Alan’ to send on his behalf”. The accused claims that what he said (in Mandarin) was: “…noted down the things that Alan asked me to keep for him”.135Foot Note 135×DS at para 54.4 (p 29). (d) At paragraph 34 of the 3rd Long Statement, the accused was recorded as having said: “This was done for easier reference if ‘Alan’ asked me whether I had made the delivery according to his instructions”. The Defence claimed at trial that what the accused had said (in Mandarin) was: “I asked Alan for the names at times because Alan will ask who came to take, so I would be able to answer him. He asked me to place at a location to tell him, he said his man will come to take”.136Foot Note 136×13 July 2021 Transcript at p 46 lines 1–32 and p 47 lines 9–10. (e) At paragraph 62 of the 3rd Long Statement, the accused was recorded as having said: “but I have yet to place it at a location for delivery as I was arrested”. The accused claims that what he said (in Mandarin) was: “I yet to have time to place the packet at a location, the CNB officers already came after me” [sic].137Foot Note 137×DS at para 57.1 54 I will refer to the paragraphs listed at (b) to (e) above as the “Disputed Portions of the Long Statements”. 55 The Contemporaneous Statement was recorded by SI Eugene. The Long Statements were recorded by ASP Yang. In my judgment, the Defence has failed to show that the Disputed Portions of the Contemporaneous Statement and the Disputed Portions of the Long Statements were inaccurately recorded. 56 I reject the Defence’s allegation that the accused’s answers at A3 and A17 of the Contemporaneous Statement were inaccurately recorded. It is undisputed between parties that the Contemporaneous Statement was recorded in a question-and-answer format. SI Eugene asked the accused questions in Mandarin. The accused answered in Mandarin. SI Eugene then recorded the questions and answers in writing in English.138Foot Note 138×ASOF at para 10. 57 In relation to A3, SI Eugene disagreed that the accused said the following in Mandarin: “Alan asked me to keep for him first. Within a month, he would ask his man to take them from me”. SI Eugene testified that he would try to write down the accused person’s answers “as exact as possible”.139Foot Note 139×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 18 line 29 to p 19 line 20.He was able to repeat in court what the accused had said to him in Mandarin, and when this was translated into English by the court interpreter, the translated version matched what was recorded at A3.140Foot Note 140×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 19 lines 21–31.Further, the accused accepted that after the Contemporaneous Statement was recorded, SI Eugene read the Contemporaneous Statement back to him inMandarin, and he affirmed that the Contemporaneous Statement, as read back by SI Eugene in Mandarin, was true and correct.141Foot Note 141×ASOF at para 10. 58 In a bid to cast doubt on the accuracy of what was recorded at A3, the Defence points to Q4 and Q12 of the Contemporaneous Statement.142Foot Note 142×DS at para 47.At Q4, the accused was asked what else Alan had asked him to keep.143Foot Note 143×AB 291.The Defence claims that Q4 supports the accused’s version because it referred to the action of keeping without mentioning the action of passing things to another person. This claim was put to SI Eugene, who disagreed.144Foot Note 144×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 19 lines 12–14.Clearly, what was put to the accused at Q4 is an equivocal piece of evidence in so far as determining what the accused said at A3 is concerned. It is equally plausible that SI Eugene chose to focus only on what Alan had asked the accused to “keep”, notwithstanding that the accused’s previous response also mentioned that Alan would ask him to “pass” things to others. Indeed, even on the version advocated for by the Defence, SI Eugene could have focused only on the action of keeping in Q4 even though the accused had earlier mentioned that Alan’s men would “take [the things] from [him]”. 59 Next, at Q12 of the Contemporaneous Statement, SI Eugene asked the accused whether he knew who would “come and collect”.145Foot Note 145×AB 293.Latching onto SI Eugene’s use of the word “collect” in Q12, the Defence put to SI Eugene that the accused must have used the word “collect” in his response at A3 (thus implying that A3, as reflected in the Contemporaneous Statement, was wrongly recorded). SI Eugene disagreed.146Foot Note 146×2 July 2021 Transcript at p 20 lines 9–29.Indeed, the use of the word “collect” in Q12 does not suggest that the accused must have used the word “collect” in A3. The accused’s answers at A10 and A11 (which were unchallenged) claimed that Alan had asked him to place things at the “6th and 7th floor staircase” and that he proceeded to place different plastic bags at the said location.147Foot Note 147×AB 293.It was thus natural for SI Eugene to follow-up with the question as recorded at Q12. Nothing in the Contemporaneous Statement indicates that the accused must have said what he now claims he said. On the face of the Contemporaneous Statement, there is also no indication that the accused could not have said what is recorded at A3. In these circumstances, there is no reason to doubt that SI Eugene had accurately recorded the accused’s answer at A3 of the Contemporaneous Statement. 60 I am similarly unconvinced that SI Eugene had not accurately recorded what the accused said at A17 of the Contemporaneous Statement. It is undisputed that after the Contemporaneous Statement was recorded, SI Eugene read the Contemporaneous Statement back to the accused inMandarin, and the accused affirmed that the Contemporaneous Statement, as read back by SI Eugene in Mandarin, was true and correct. It is also undisputed that SI Eugene invited the accused to make any alterations to the Contemporaneous Statement but he declined.148Foot Note 148×ASOF at para 10.When given an opportunity to explain why he did not flag out to SI Eugene that his answer at A17 as recorded in the Contemporaneous Statement was different from what he told SI Eugene, the accused said that he was feeling uncomfortable and nervous, and did not know what was written as his answer because he answered the question in Mandarin.149Foot Note 149×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 22 lines 13–29.In my view, these are mere excuses which must be rejected. The accused claimed that he felt nervous because “many people rushed into [his] room suddenly and [he] did not know what had happened”. However, when the Prosecution pointed out to the accused during cross-examination that the Contemporaneous Statement was recorded at 11.05pm, which was nearly three hours after CNB officers gained entry into his home, the accused shifted his stance and claimed that he was nervous because between the time the CNB officers entered his room and the time his Contemporaneous Statement was recorded, “many things had happened”.150Foot Note 150×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 22 line 30 to p 23 line 13.The accused’s claim that he did not know what was written as his answer is also baseless. The accused knew what was recorded in the Contemporaneous Statement because SI Eugene read the Contemporaneous Statement back to the accused inMandarin, and the accusedaffirmedthat the Contemporaneous Statement, as read back by SI Eugene to the accused in Mandarin, was true and correct. There is no allegation (nor evidence to support such an allegation) that SI Eugene had deliberately repeated what the accused had said to him in Mandarin but had written down something different in English. 61 I now turn to consider whether the Disputed Portions of the Long Statements were accurately recorded. LE Wong was the Mandarin interpreter for the recording of the Long Statements. For all the Long Statements, ASP Yang asked the accused questions in English, and LE Wong interpreted the same to the accused in Mandarin. The accused answered in Mandarin, and LE Wong interpreted the same to ASP Yang in English.151Foot Note 151×ASOF at para 21(c). 62 LE Wong disagreed that the accused said what he claims to have said at [53(b)]–[53(e)] above.152Foot Note 152×13 July 2021 Transcript at p 29 line 28 to p 31 line 32, p 33 lines 1–13, p 43 line 8 to p 44 line 2; p 46 line 6 to p 47 line 24, and p 49 lines 3 to 23.He testified that his practice was to interpret “according to what the person told me or said”.153Foot Note 153×13 July 2021 Transcript at p 47 lines 15–16.It also bears emphasising that for all the Long Statements, the accused accepts that LE Wong had interpreted and read back the statements to him in Mandarin. During this process, several amendments and corrections to typographical errors were made. Each amendment was explained to the accused in Mandarin, and when he was invited to make further amendments to his statements, he declined. The accused then signed at the bottom of each page of the Long Statements, and against each amendment.154Foot Note 154×ASOF at paras 21(e) and 21(f).Despite having the opportunity to raise all the inaccuracies listed at [53(b)]–[53(e)] above, the accused did not. The belated nature of these claims coupled with LE Wong’s evidence render the accused’s challenges meritless.",
        "Elements of the Charge": "63 As it is undisputed that the accused had possession of the Drugs within the meaning of s 5 of the MDA, and there is also ample evidence in this regard,155Foot Note 155×See AB 370 (para 6); 21 July 2021 Transcript at p 3 lines 12–17.there are only two issues which fall to be determined: (a) whether the accused knew the nature of the Drugs (“Issue 1”), and (b) whether the accused was in possession of the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking (“Issue 2”). 64 Given that much of the evidential analysis for the latter two issues turns on the accused’s evidence, both in his statements and his oral testimony, I will begin by setting out the accused’s evidence from these two sources before delving into the analysis proper.",
        "Accused’s evidence": "Contents of the accused’s statements 65 After the Charge was read out to the accused, all he said in his Cautioned Statement was that he had already said what he wanted to say in his Contemporaneous Statement and had nothing more to add.156Foot Note 156×AB 368; 16 July 2021 Transcript at p 30 line 30 to p 31 line 4.I therefore focus this section on the contents of the accused’s Contemporaneous Statement and Long Statements. (1) Contemporaneous Statement 66 In the Contemporaneous Statement, the accused disavowed knowledge of the contents of exhibits D5 to D9,157Foot Note 157×AB at 291 at A1; 2 July 2021 Transcript at p 10 line 15 to p 11 line 6.and claimed that they belonged to Alan.158Foot Note 158×AB at 291 at A2.When asked why they were with him, the accused responded: “Alan asked me to keep. He will ask me topass it to others” [emphasis added].159Foot Note 159×AB at 291 at A3. 67 The accused said that Alan passed him these items two weeks ago on two occasions, through a male Chinese known as “Ah Han” and another person.160Foot Note 160×AB 292 at A6.Ah Han and this other person passed him the items by leaving them at the staircase outside the accused’s house. Upon being informed by Alan or Ah Han through a phone call about the location of these items, the accused collected them and brought them back to his house.161Foot Note 161×AB 292 at A7 and A8. 68 The accused also said Alan asked him to keep “Ice, Red Wine, [G]rass, ‘K’ and some red tablet[s]”.162Foot Note 162×AB 292 at A4.When he was asked what red wine, grass and the red tablets were, he identified red wine as “5” and the red tablets as “WY”. However, he did not know what “grass” was.163Foot Note 163×AB 292 at A5. 69 In the afternoon of 20 November 2018, the day the accused was arrested, the accused collected a white plastic bag containing grass and a red plastic bag containing “5” at the staircase outside his house after Alan informed him that “the things are there”.164Foot Note 164×AB 293 at A13; AB 294 at A15.Later that same day, Alan told the accused to place “the things” at “the 6th and 7th floor staircase”.165Foot Note 165×AB 293 at A10.The accused then placed the white plastic bag containing grass and the red plastic bag containing “5” at the said location,166Foot Note 166×AB 293 at A11.and called Alan to inform him of the same.167Foot Note 167×AB 293 at A12. 70 In response to a question asking how long the accused had been helping Alan “keep and send the [sic] drugs”, the accused replied “[a]bout half a year”.168Foot Note 168×AB 294 at A16.When asked how much he would earn for doing such things, the accused said that he would ask Alan for money when he was in need of money, and that Alan would give him $200 to $300 each time.169Foot Note 169×AB 294 at A17. (2) Long Statements (A) The accused’s relationship with Alan 71 The accused claimed that he had known Alan for about six months prior to his arrest. The accused got to know Alan through a mutual friend, who gave him Alan’s contact number and told him to call Alan to arrange for a meeting.170Foot Note 170×AB 371 (para 12).The accused called Alan and told Alan to meet him at a playground near the Block. Alan and the accused then met at that playground. This was theonlytime the accused met Alan in-person.171Foot Note 171×AB 372 (para 12). 72 During that meeting at the playground, Alan told the accused that “if [he] need[ed] anything, he [ie, Alan] [would] be able to find someone to deliver it over”. The accused claimed that he understood “anything” to be a reference to illegal things such as drugs.172Foot Note 172×AB 372 (para 12). 73 Some time after their meeting at the playground, Alan called the accused to tell him that there were things coming in from “JB” and told the accused to receive them on his behalf. The accused alleged that he did not know what those things were at that time, and only found out that they were drugs after he had received Alan’s things and “opened up the things to see”. He recognised that they were drugs because he had seen drugs on television before.173Foot Note 173×AB 372 (para 12). 74 The accused claimed that since then, he had been receiving drugs on Alan’s behalf,174Foot Note 174×AB 372 (para 12).and that Alan had only contacted him for drug-related matters.175Foot Note 175×AB 432 (para 73).Apart from their meeting at the playground, the accused and Alan only communicated through phone, with Alan using a Malaysian phone number.176Foot Note 176×AB 372 (para 14).According to the accused, he had received “ice”, “gor kia”, “grass” and “k” on Alan’s behalf. He could not remember how many times he had received drugs on behalf of Alan. When he helped Alan receive drugs, he did not receive any form of fixed payment in return. Whenever he needed money, he would ask Alan for about $200 to $300. Alan allegedly did not tell the accused why he needed the accused to receive drugs on his behalf.177Foot Note 177×AB 372 (para 12). 75 In his 1st Long Statement, the accused said that he had never seen who placed the drugs at the pick-up location when he was tasked to pick up the drugs. Neither had he seen who collected the drugs after he placed them at the pick-up location. In the accused’s own words, “[i]t will always be contacted through ‘Alan’ [sic]”.178Foot Note 178×AB 372 (para 15).In a similar vein, the accused said in his 3rd Long Statement that he “sen[t] the ‘drugs’ to the locations according to ‘Alan’ instructions” and “had never collect[ed] anything from anyone to pass to ‘Alan’”.179Foot Note 179×AB 400 (para 34).Alan “had only asked [him] todeliverthe ‘drugs’ to one person face to face for a few times” [emphasis added], and that person was one “Ah Poh”. For “the rest of the times, ‘Alan’ asked [him] to place it at a location where the recipient [would] collect without [his] presence”.180Foot Note 180×AB 399 (para 31). 76 The last time the accused met Ah Poh was one week before his arrest. During that meeting, he “passed ‘Ah Poh’ one packet of ‘hot one’” in accordance with Alan’s instructions.181Foot Note 181×AB 399 (para 32).After he passed a packet of “hot one” to Ah Poh on the aforementioned occasion, he received cash from Ah Poh.182Foot Note 182×AB 399–400 (para 32).The accused proceeded to deposit the cash into a Singapore POSB account. The account number was provided by Alan even though that account did not belong to Alan.183Foot Note 183×AB 400 (para 32). 77 The accused was also shown photographs of two notebooks (the “Notebooks”) during the recording of his 3rd Long Statement.184Foot Note 184×AB 399 (para 31) and 405 (photos 48–49).He explained that these Notebooks belonged to him and that he used them to “note down what ‘drugs’ [he] helped ‘Alan’ tosendon his behalf” [emphasis added].185Foot Note 185×AB 399 (para 31) and 400 (para 34).Other than that, the accused also “roughly take down the name of whom [he was] supposed tosendthem to” [emphasis added].186Foot Note 186×AB 400 (para 34).The accused said that the names of the recipients were provided by Alan, because the accused would ask Alan who the drugs were meant for when he placed them at a location for collection. The accused explained that this was done “for easier reference if ‘Alan’ asked [him] whether [he] had made thedeliveryaccording to his instructions” [emphasis added].187Foot Note 187×AB 400 (para 34).In his 5th Long Statement, the accused maintained that the Notebooks contained “the names of the recipients whom [he] delivered ‘drugs’ to by placing them at the location” and “the ‘drugs’ which [he had] placed at the location for the recipient”.188Foot Note 188×AB 430 (para 65). (B) Events on 20 November 2018 prior to the accused’s arrest 78 In the 1st Long Statement, the accused explained the events on 20 November 2018 prior to his arrest as follows. On that day, the accused was woken up by a call from Alan. Alan told him that there were “grass” and “red wine” to be collected at the 11th floor staircase of the Block. The accused then collected the “grass” and “red wine” and went back home.189Foot Note 189×AB 369–370 (para 5). 79 Later on the same day, Alan called him again and told him that “someone” was going to take “something” from him. Alan allegedly told him it was “meant for the same person” but instructed the accused to place the “grass” and “red wine” at separate locations. The accused, on his own accord, decided to place the “grass” and “red wine” at “the 6th and 7th floor staircase” of the Block respectively. He then “placed a white colour plastic bag which contains many black packets of item” which he thought was “grass” at the 6th floor and a red plastic bag containing a black zip lock bag with “red wine” at the 7th floor. According to the accused, the “grass” and “red wine” were “already in that state when [he] received them”, and he only separated them by placing them into two plastic bags.190Foot Note 190×AB 370 (para 6). 80 After he returned home, he contacted Alan to tell the latter the exact locations where the “grass” and “red wine” were placed.191Foot Note 191×AB 370 (para 6).Shortly thereafter, he was arrested by CNB officers in his home. (C) The accused’s knowledge of the drugs found in his possession 81 When the accused’s 2nd and 3rd Long Statements were recorded, he was shown photographs of various exhibits. He was able to identify “red wine”, “ice” and “k” in a number of those exhibits and explained that those drugs were “meant for somebody else” and that he will wait for Alan to tell him where to place them.192Foot Note 192×AB 374–375 (paras 21–23 and 25), 393 (photo 33), 394 (photo 34), 395 (photo 37), 396 (photo 38).In particular, he was able to identify exhibits G1A1A, G1A2A and SHJ-A2 as containing the “red wine” which he collected from the staircase at the 11th floor on 20 November 2018.193Foot Note 193×AB 401 (paras 37–38) and 409–410 (photos 57–58).He was also able to identify exhibit SHJ-A1A as containing the “grass” which he collected from the staircase at the 11th floor on 20 November 2018.194Foot Note 194×AB 401 (para 38) and 410 (photo 59).The accused explained that he was able to identify them as such because Alan told him so.195Foot Note 195×AB 401 (para 37) and 411 (para 42). 82 However, when he was shown photographs depicting exhibit D4 and its contents during the recording of his 2nd Long Statement, he claimed that he could only recognise exhibit D4. He did not know what the brown substances in exhibits D4A1, D4C1, D4C2, D4B1A, D4B2A and D4C2A were.196Foot Note 196×AB 375 (paras 25–26).He explained that when he received exhibit D4, he did not open it up to see what was inside. He received exhibit D4 and its contents from Alan but did not ask Alan what was inside exhibit D4.197Foot Note 197×AB 375–376 (para 26).When asked in his 3rd Long Statement why he did not ask Alan about the contents of exhibit D4, the accused explained that it did not cross his mind to ask Alan what was inside even though he knew that it was something illegal.198Foot Note 198×AB 398 (para 28). 83 In relation to exhibits D5 to D9, the accused claimed that they came from Alan. He only recognised exhibits D5 to D9 and not the other exhibits found within them because he did not open exhibits D5 to D9 to check their contents. As far as the other exhibits found within D5 to D9 were concerned, the accused “[did] not recogni[s]e them”, had “never seen them before” and had “never touched them before”. He also did not ask Alan what exhibits D5 to D9 contained, even though he knew that it was something illegal.199Foot Note 199×AB 398 (para 29) and 402–404 (photos 43–46). (D) The accused’s history of drug consumption and knowledge of drugs in general 84 In his 3rd Long Statement, the accused explained that when Alan told the accused to deliver “hot one” to Ah Poh, he understood Alan as referring to a black packet of things which looked like exhibits D5 to D9. The accused, however, disclaimed any knowledge of what Alan meant by “hot one”. He suspected that “hot one” was something illegal, but never asked Alan what was “hot one”.200Foot Note 200×AB 399 (para 32) and 402 (photo 42).He explained that there was no need for him to ask Alan what exactly “hot one” meant because he was not trying to study it and did not have to know what it was exactly.201Foot Note 201×AB 399 (para 32). 85 In his 5th Long Statement, the accused was asked to explain the meaning of various terms written in one of his Notebooks, and his replies were as follows:202Foot Note 202×AB 430 (para 66). (a) The term “HOT” referred to “hot one”, which is a drug.(b) The term “FISH” referred to “cold one”, which is a drug. It also meant “ice”.(c) The term “wine” referred to “red wine”, which is a drug. It is also known as “gor kia” and “five”.(d) The term “DANCE” referred to “shake head”, which is a drug in tablet form.(e) The term “KFC” referred to “k”, which is a drug.(f) The term “W.Y” referred to “WY”, which is a drug.(g) The word “GU” referred to “grass”, which is a drug. 86 Of note is the fact that when the accused was asked whether he knew or used any other names to refer to “grass”, he answered that he referred to “grass” as Gu”.203Foot Note 203×AB 431 (para 71).He did not mention that he referred to “grass” as “hot one”. The accused was also asked whether he knew or used other names to refer to “hot one”, and he replied that he also referred to “hot one” using the term “hot”.204Foot Note 204×AB 432 (para 72). 87 As for the accused’s history of drug consumption, the accused said that he smoked “ice” on a daily basis since early 2018.205Foot Note 205×AB 414–415 (paras 54–55). (E) The accused’s financial situation 88 The accused claimed that he was unemployed at the time his 1st Long Statement was recorded. He stopped helping out at his father’s coffeeshop two years ago and since then, he would receive allowances from his parents as and when he needed money and had no sources of income.206Foot Note 206×AB 369 at para 4. 89 The accused had pawned various items, some of which belonged to his parents. He explained that he wanted to use the money for his daily expenses and online casino betting, and mentioned that he was losing money from his bets.207Foot Note 207×AB 414 (para 50). Accused’s evidence at trial (1) The accused’s interactions with Alan prior to receiving the drugs in exhibits D4 to D9 90 The accused first met Alan at a playground near the Block.208Foot Note 208×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 5 lines 1–4.The meeting was arranged entirely by a mutual friend shared by the accused and Alan: the accused was not given Alan’s contact number and Alan did not contact him personally prior to their meeting.209Foot Note 209×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 3 line 31 to p 4 line 1 and at p 5 lines 12–20.That mutual friend did not inform the accused why the meeting was arranged and was not present at the meeting.210Foot Note 210×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 4 lines 1–15 and p 5 lines 25–28.During that meeting, the accused had a “normal chit-chat” with Alan and regarded Alan as his friend.211Foot Note 211×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 5 line 29 to p 6 line 28.When Alan asked whether the accused could help him temporarily keep “anything” that came from Malaysia on his behalf without specifying what those things would be, the accused did not promise that he could help.212Foot Note 212×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 16 lines 25–27; 21 July 2021 Transcript at p 6 line 29 to p 7 line 8. 91 The accused did not communicate with Alan until approximately half a year later when Alan called the accused. During that phone call, Alan asked if the accused could help him keep his things at the accused’s place. Although Alan did not say what those things were, the accused agreed because he thought he “might as well [help]” because it was “not a big issue”.213Foot Note 213×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 16 line 32 to p 17 line 15. 92 Subsequently, Alan informed the accused via a phone call that his things had arrived in Singapore and, again, asked the accused to keep them for him temporarily. Alan also told the accused that he would send someone to take his things back.214Foot Note 214×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 17 lines 21–27.In another call, Alan told the accused what time to take the things and gave the accused the collection address.215Foot Note 215×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 17 lines 28–32.When the accused reached the location given by Alan, all he saw was a black paper bag. He did not meet anyone there. The accused took the black paper bag home after confirming with Alan via a phone call that it belonged to Alan.216Foot Note 216×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 18 lines 1–7. 93 When the accused reached home, he kept the black paper bag in a drawer in his room. It remained in the accused’s home until a month later when Alan called the accused. During that call, Alan told the accused to place the black paper bag at a location within the vicinity of where the accused stayed and Alan would send someone to retrieve it. The accused later informed Alan of the location so that “his man could go there to take”.217Foot Note 217×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 18 lines 8–32. 94 The accused kept things for Alan on a few other occasions. On one of these occasions, the bag containing Alan’s things was torn and the accused could see what was inside. That was the first time when the accused realised that Alan’s things were drugs, specifically, “grass” and “red wine”.218Foot Note 218×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 20 lines 11–18 and p 21 lines 12–18.He knew that they were “grass” and “red wine” because he had seen them on television and had consumed both types of drugs previously.219Foot Note 219×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 21 lines 19–22.When the accused called Alan to tell him that the bag was torn, Alan told the accused that he would get his men to give the accused the black zip lock bag and asked the accused “to repack them into the black zip lock bag.220Foot Note 220×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 20 lines 14–18.Alan later sent him black zip lock bags (marked as exhibit D11C) and white transparent bags (found in exhibit D11A), both of which were seized from his bedroom.221Foot Note 221×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 20 lines 24–30; Photograph P30.After the accused repacked Alan’s things, he kept them in a drawer since Alan had asked him to keep them and he was waiting for Alan’s men to take back those things.222Foot Note 222×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 21 lines 23–27. 95 On a separate occasion, Alan’s things were sent over in a paper bag and the bag was torn when the accused arrived home. The accused recognised that the things in the paper bag were “ice” because he had seen it on television and had consumed it before.223Foot Note 223×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 21 line 28 to p 22 line 4.Another time, Alan asked the accused to pass a “black packet of thing” to someone by the name of Ah Poh. Alan told the accused that it was “shao de” (which translates to “hot one” in English, and refers to diamorphine), but both Alan and Ah Poh did not tell the accused what exactly “hot one” was.224Foot Note 224×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 38 lines 3–31. 96 When asked by his own counsel during examination-in-chief what other drugs he had seen in Alan’s things, the accused replied that he would not know what those things were but he would ask Alan and Alan would tell him.225Foot Note 225×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 22 lines 15–18. 97 Besides helping Alan keep his things from Malaysia and placing them somewhere for his men to take them back, the accused would also help Alan take down notes. Alan would tell the accused other people’s names, telephone numbers, and other information, and the accused would note these down word-for-word.226Foot Note 226×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 19 lines 3–14 and p 37 lines 30–32.Alan asked the accused to take note of these, so that if he subsequently asked the accused what the accused was keeping for him or whether his men had come to take his things, the accused would be able to answer him.227Foot Note 227×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 19 lines 23–26. 98 Additionally, the accused helped Alan convert money from Singapore dollars into Malaysian ringgit. Alan would transfer money in Singapore dollars into the accused’s bank account, and the accused would withdraw that sum of money and change it into Malaysian ringgit. On Alan’s instructions, the accused would place that sum of money at a certain location for Alan’s men to collect.228Foot Note 228×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 19 line 6 to p 20 line 5. 99 Notably, the accused claimed that he was not paid for helping Alan keep illicit drugs.229Foot Note 229×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 11 line 26 to p 12 line 6.But he alleged that if he needed money, he would borrow money from Alan and return the money to Alan a few days later.230Foot Note 230×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 29 lines 25–32; 21 July 2021 Transcript at p 21 lines 10–14. (2) The accused’s receipt of drugs in exhibits D4 to D9 100 About two to three weeks before his arrest, Alan asked the accused, over the phone, to keep things for him and told the accused that he would send his man to take them back within one month.231Foot Note 231×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 23 lines 3–15.At the time of collection, they came in a black zip lock bag which was torn, and the accused saw that they were drugs.232Foot Note 232×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 24 lines 3–12.However, he did not know what drugs they were.233Foot Note 233×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 24 line 20.He called Alan and asked what they were, to which Alan replied that they were “ganja”. When the accused asked what the granular substances were, Alan said that “they were ganja but it was in different shape”.234Foot Note 234×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 24 lines 20–22; 22 July 2021 Transcript at p 15 lines 9–11.The accused also asked Alan what he should do as the bag was torn. In response, Alan asked the accused to repack the items into another zip lock bag. The accused then repacked the items into exhibit D4, thus leaving behind his DNA on the exterior and interior of exhibit D4.235Foot Note 235×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 24 line 10 and p 25 lines 1–7. 101 The accused also claimed that within the original, torn black zip lock bag, there were two other bags which were torn. He therefore replaced these bags with packagings which are now marked as exhibits D4C1 and D4C2. As the original packaging had markings on them, the accused copied those markings onto exhibits D4C1 and D4C2.236Foot Note 236×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 25 lines 10–28.According to the Defence, this explains why the accused’s DNA appears on D4C2.237Foot Note 237×DS at para 35. 102 In the same period of time (ie, about two to three weeks before his arrest), the accused also received another group of items from Alan. Those items came in bags, some of which were torn. At the time of seizure, these items were found in five black packets, exhibits D5, D6, D7, D8 and D9. As before, Alan had asked the accused to keep those things for him and told the accused he would send his man to take them back.238Foot Note 238×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 23 lines 16–28; see Photograph P5.The accused could not remember if he collected those things on the same day or on separate days, or on the aforementioned occasion at [100] above.239Foot Note 239×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 23 line 29 to p 24 line 2.At the time of collection, the accused knew that the items were something illegal, and believed that they could be “grass” and “red wine” because those were the types of drugs he received from Alan on prior occasions.240Foot Note 240×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 36 lines 11–18.However, when he reached home and was about to change the bags which were torn, he realised that the things were not “red wine”,241Foot Note 241×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 41 lines 2–6; 22 July 2021 Transcript at p 15 lines 23–30.but “grass”.242Foot Note 242×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 41 line 2 to p 42 line 6.This was because he saw the cubes in exhibits D5 to D9 and recalled that Alan told him that they were “ganja”.243Foot Note 243×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 41 line 2 to p 42 line 6. 103 The accused then proceeded to repack the items which were in bags that were torn and this resulted in his DNA being found on exhibits D6A1, D6A2, D6A and D6B,244Foot Note 244×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 25 line 29 to p 26 line 14.as well as exhibits D7A, D7B and D7C.245Foot Note 245×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 26 line 27 to p 27 line 13; Photograph P27. 104 Up to the accused’s time of arrest, Alan had not told him what to do with the items in exhibits D4 to D9. Even though two to three weeks had passed, the accused was still keeping the items for Alan because Alan told the accused that he would send someone to take them back within one month.246Foot Note 246×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 24 lines 27–31 and p 27 lines 19–31. 105 At the time of his arrest, the accused had known Alan for about 10 to 11 months.247Foot Note 247×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 3 lines 25–30. (3) The accused’s history of drug consumption and knowledge of drugs in general 106 The accused’s evidence is that he consumed “grass” prior to 2018,248Foot Note 248×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 18 lines 15–20.consumed “ice” everyday,249Foot Note 249×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 19 lines 7–24.and infrequently consumed “red wine”.250Foot Note 250×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 18 line 28 to p 19 line 6.Before he was arrested, the accused knew that “ganja” was brownish in colour,251Foot Note 251×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 24 lines 25–26.and that the drugs, “grass”, “red wine” and “ice”, were also known as “ganja”, “gor kia” or “Erimin-5”, and “bing” respectively.252Foot Note 252×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 17 lines 6–19. 107 As for the term “hot one”, the accused suspected that it was something illegal,253Foot Note 253×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 51 lines 2–8.and was under the impression that it referred to “grass”.254Foot Note 254×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 52 lines 27–31.He formed this impression because Alan “told [him] that the ‘hot one’ he was referring to was the same as the ‘grass’ [he] referred to”.255Foot Note 255×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 53 lines 16–19.“Hot one” was a term used by Alan, not the accused.256Foot Note 256×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 54 lines 1–2.",
        "Issue 1: Knowledge of the nature of the Drugs": "Applicable legal principles 108 The presumption of knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug is contained in s 18(2) of the MDA: 18.–(2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. 109 The Prosecution can avail itself to the s 18(2) presumption where the accused is proved or presumed to have the controlled drug in his possession. If the Prosecution does invoke the s 18(2) presumption, as in the present case, the burden of proof lies on the accused to rebut the statutory presumption on a balance of probabilities. 110 To rebut this presumption, the accused person has to show that he did not know the nature of the drugs in his possession:Gobi a/lAvedian v Public Prosecutor[2021] 1 SLR 180 (“Gobi”) at [57]. However, an assertion of ignorance is insufficient to displace the s 18(2) presumption – if such a simplistic claim could rebut this presumption, the presumption would be “all bark and no bite”:Gobiat [64], citingObeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor[2017] 1 SLR 633 (“Obeng Comfort”) at [39]. 111 The s 18(2) presumption is also not rebutted if the accused is indifferent to the nature of what is in his possession. An indifferent accused person cannot be said to have formed any view as to what the thing in his possessionisoris not, and thus cannot be said to believe that the nature of the thing in his possession is something other than or incompatible with the specific drug he is in possession of. An accused may be said to be indifferent to the nature of the thing in his possession if he had the ready means and opportunity to verify what he was carrying, but failed to take the steps that an ordinary reasonable person would have taken to establish the nature of the thing, and also fails to provide any plausible explanation for that failure:Gobiat [65]. In a similar vein, if an accused person identifies the drugs in his possession by some idiosyncratic or colloquial name, but does not know what that means and does not bother to ascertain that meaning, he may be described as being indifferent to the nature of what he is carrying:Gobiat [67(c)]. 112 Ultimately, the s 18(2) presumption will be rebutted where the court accepts that the accused has formed a positive belief that was incompatible with knowledge that the thing he was carrying was the specific drug in his possession:Gobiat [60]. To this end, the accused can show either that: (a) he believed he was in possession of something innocuous, even if he is unable to specify exactly what that was, or (b) he believed that he was in possession of some contraband item or drug other than the specific drug in his possession:Gobiat [59]. There is no need for the accused person to establish that he held a firm belief as to, or actually knew, what the thing in his possession specifically was:Gobiat [58]. 113 Where the accused person has stated what he thought that item was, the court will assess the veracity of his assertion against the objective facts and examine his actions relating to the item in that light. This assessment will naturally be a highly fact-specific inquiry, and the court will consider factors such as the nature, the value and the quantity of the item and any reward for transporting it:SaravananChandaram v Public Prosecutor and another matter[2020] 2 SLR 95(“Saravanan”) at [34];Obengat [40]. This inquiry will also take into account the credibility of the accused as a witness:Obengat [40]. Defence’s case 114 The Defence largely relies on the accused’s oral testimony. The Defence’s case is that after the accused received the items in exhibit D4, he was told by Alan that they were “ganja”, and that the granular substance was “ganja but it was in different shape”.257Foot Note 257×DS at paras 210 and 228.At the time the accused collected the items in exhibits D5 to D9, he believed that they were “grass” and “red wine” as with previous occasions. After he got home, he saw that some of the packaging was torn and realised that the items in exhibits D5 to D9 were the same cubes or granular substances which were in exhibit D4.258Foot Note 258×DS at paras 210 and 229.On the Defence’s case, the accused realised then that there was no “red wine” and that the cubes or granular substances were “ganja” per what Alan told him previously.259Foot Note 259×DS at paras 210 and 212. 115 In short, the accused was of the belief that exhibits D4 to D9 contained “ganja” in a different shape.260Foot Note 260×DS at para 238.To buttress that belief, the Defence submits that the accused had no reason to think that Alan was lying to him when Alan told him that the cubes or granular substances were “ganja” but in a different shape. This is because: (a) The accused had no knowledge of what diamorphine is:261Foot Note 261×DS at para 234. (i) The accused only ever consumed “grass”, “red wine” and “ice” and had no history of diamorphine consumption.262Foot Note 262×DS at paras 197–201 and 231. (ii) During investigations, the accused was forthcoming about his ability to identify “grass”, “red wine” and “ice” from the photographs of the exhibits shown to him, but was unable to recognise diamorphine. If the accused was trying to hide his guilt, he would have denied knowledge of all the drugs supposedly seized and shown to him, especially since the quantity of cannabis involved was also very substantial. His willingness to admit to knowingly possessing other types of drugs should thus point to a finding of fact that the accused genuinely had no knowledge about diamorphine.263Foot Note 263×DS at paras 198–202, 204 and 232-233. (b) The accused knew that “ganja” was “brownish in colour” and the diamorphine, as illustrated in the photographs, does appear brown in colour. The Defence also claims that the Prosecution did not dispute the accused’s testimony that “ganja” can appear in different shapes.264Foot Note 264×DS at paras 211 and 230; DRS at para 4. 116 Separately, the Defence also put forward submissions on the use of the term “hot one”. According to the Defence, the first time that the accused mentioned “hot one” was when he was being forthcoming about a prior delivery of drugs, on Alan’s behalf, to Ah Poh.265Foot Note 265×DS at para 205.The accused accepts that when he delivered black packets, which resembled exhibits D5 to D9, to Ah Poh on that previous occasion, Alan told him that it was “hot one”.266Foot Note 266×DS at para 187.However, the Defence submits that this prior delivery to Ah Poh is not relevant to establishing the accused’s knowledge about diamorphine or the contents of exhibits D4 to D9.267Foot Note 267×DS at paras 187 and 205.There is no evidence establishing what the accused had delivered to Ah Poh on that occasion.268Foot Note 268×DS at para 188.Neither is there evidence that the accused was told what “hot one” meant when he delivered drugs to Ah Poh on that occasion.269Foot Note 269×DS at para 205.The evidence merely shows that the type of black zip lock packets used for exhibits D5 to D9 were likely to have been used when the accused delivered Alan’s drugs to Ah Poh. However, as the accused did not see the drugs on that occasion and notice that they looked the same as or similar to the diamorphine in exhibits D5 to D9, the prior delivery to Ah Poh cannot be said to be relevant.270Foot Note 270×DS at para 189. 117 The Defence also claims that the accused understood “hot one” to be a reference to “ganja”, and that the Prosecution has not proven that the accused knew that “hot one” meant diamorphine:271Foot Note 271×DS at paras 29, 197, 209 and 236. (a) The accused’s evidence is that Alan told him that “hot one”, a term which Alan used, was the same as “grass”, a term which the accused used.272Foot Note 272×DS at paras 29 and 236. (b) The fact that the accused candidly talked about the incident involving Ah Poh and mentioned “hot one” meant that he genuinely did not think that “hot one” had anything to do with diamorphine.273Foot Note 273×DS at para 209. (c) Due to the way ASP Yang phrased his questions during investigations, the accused did not mention that he knew “grass” as “hot one”. In particular, the accused understood one of ASP Yang’s questions as asking whathe, and not other persons, referred to as “grass” and “hot one”. Since it was Alan who referred to “grass as “hot one”, and not the accused, the accused did not say that he knew “grass” as “hot one” during investigations.274Foot Note 274×DS at paras 29 and 206–208. (d) With respect to the Notebooks, the accused only wrote down what Alan dictated to him, and there is no evidence showing that he wrote the entries independently and with full knowledge of the term “HOT”.275Foot Note 275×DS at para 237. Prosecution’s case 118 The Prosecution relies on the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA to show that the accused knew that exhibits D4 to D9 contained diamorphine.276Foot Note 276×Prosecution’s Closing Submissions (“PS”) at para 41(b). 119 The Prosecution submits that the defence raised by the accused during trial,viz, that he believed exhibit D4 contained “ganja” while exhibits D5 to D9 contained “grass” and “red wine”,277Foot Note 277×PS at paras 55 and 59.should be rejected for two reasons: (a) The accused is not a credible witness as he gave varied accounts regarding what he thought the Drugs were across his statements and testimony. His testimony at trial was an afterthought which was belatedly raised.278Foot Note 278×PS at paras 51 and 60.For instance, in relation to the contents of exhibit D4, the accused initially claimed in one of his Long Statements that he did not know what was inside exhibit D4 and did not ask Alan about it.279Foot Note 279×PS at para 52.However, one of his accounts at trial was that he saw the drugs inside exhibit D4 and had asked Alan what the drugs were, to which Alan said they were “ganja” but “in a different shape”.280Foot Note 280×PS at para 55. (b) The accused’s claim, that he thought that the Drugs were “grass” and “red wine”, is irreconcilable with his own evidence.281Foot Note 281×PS at para 61. (i) There was no reason for Alan to lie to the accused that “hot one” was a reference to cannabis when on the accused’s own account, Alan had readily told him about the nature of other drugs on previous occasions. There was also no indication that the accused would refuse to help Alan had he known that the drugs were diamorphine.282Foot Note 282×PS at para 63. (ii) The accused ultimately admitted that he suspected that the contents of the exhibits D4 to D9 were “hot one”. He testified that he had previously passed “hot one” to Ah Poh and that there was no need for him to ask Alan what “hot one” was on that occasion. It is incoherent for the accused to suddenly feel compelled to call Alan to ask him what the Drugs were when he previously did not see the need to.283Foot Note 283×PS at para 64. (iii) The accused was aware that “hot” was different from “grass” based on the entries in the Notebooks and his Long Statements.284Foot Note 284×PS at paras 65(a) and 65(b). (iv) The accused also admitted in court that the contents of exhibits D5 to D9 did not resemble “red wine”.285Foot Note 285×PS at para 65(c). (v) There was simply no reason for the accused to believe Alan’s assurances that the Drugs were “grass”, since on the accused’s account at trial, they were not close to each other and Alan had essentially tricked the accused into receiving and storing drugs for him for a period of time.286Foot Note 286×PS at para 66. 120 Separately, the accused’s account in his statements,viz, that he did not know what the Drugs were and did not conduct any checks on the same, was insufficient to rebut the presumption of knowledge as he was merely indifferent to what was in his possession.287Foot Note 287×PS at paras 68–70. Evidential analysis 121 To rebut the s 18(2) presumption, the accused must form a positive belief that was incompatible with knowledge that the thing he was carrying was the specific drug in his possession:Gobiat [60]. Here, the positive belief asserted is that the items in exhibits D4 to D9 were “ganja”. It is also claimed that this positive belief stemmed from Alan’s assertion that the Drugs in exhibit D4 were “ganja” (see above at [114]). The credibility of the accused’s contention must be assessed (seeObengat [40]), and as part of this inquiry, I will consider whether Alan did in fact tell the accused that the Drugs in exhibit D4 were “ganja” and if so, whether the accused’s assertion that he believed Alan ought to be accepted. 122 I reject the accused’s claim that he believed that the items in exhibits D4 to D9 were “ganja”, and find that the s 18(2) presumption remains unrebutted. This conclusion is the result of the following reasons which, taken together, show that the accused did not believe that the Drugs in exhibits D4 to D9 were “ganja”: (a) The accused’s alleged belief that exhibits D4 to D9 contained “ganja” was raised late in the day and stood in sharp contrast with the positions he took in his statements. This not only reveals that the accused is a witness lacking in credit, but also indicates that this defence at trial was an afterthought. (b) The accused’s narrative of how he came to believe that the Drugs were “ganja” was improbable. I disbelieved the accused’s claim that Alan told him that the Drugs in exhibit D4 were “ganja”. Even if Alan did say so, it was implausible for the accused to believe Alan. (1) The accused is not a witness of credit and his defence at trial was an afterthought 123 I begin with the first reason. The accused’s evidence as to what he knew about the contents of exhibits D4 to D9 as well as how he came to have such knowledge evolved over time. The general position he took in his statements was one of ignorance – he never opened exhibits D4 to D9, never looked at the Drugs, never asked Alan what was inside, and knew nothing about the specific nature of their contents. Henevermentioned that he believed that exhibits D4 to D9 contained “ganja”. However, his position changed at trial: he claimed for the first time that he had looked at the Drugs and had formed the belief that they were “ganja” because this was what Alan told him after he asked Alan. This marked shift in the accused’s evidence and the absence of any credible explanation for this change show the accused’s lack of credit and renders his belated assertion at trial unbelievable. 124 I will first set out the accused’s conflicting positions in relation to the contents of exhibit D4, before proceeding to set out his similarly conflicting evidence in relation to the contents of exhibits D5 to D9. (A) Accused’s evidence regarding the contents of exhibit D4 125 In the 2nd Long Statement, the accused alleged that he did not recognise what the brown substance in exhibits D4A1, D4C1, D4C2, D4B1A, D4B2A and D4C2A was. According to the accused, when he received the black packet marked D4, he did not open it up to see what was inside. Neither did he ask Alan what was inside exhibit D4.288Foot Note 288×AB 375–376 (para 26).When his 3rd Long Statement was recorded, the accused explained that it did not cross his mind to ask Alan what was inside exhibit D4. He just knew that it was something illegal.289Foot Note 289×AB 398 (para 28). 126 The accused abandoned this position at trial. He alleged that Alan’s items came in a black zip lock bag which was torn. When the accused reached home and wanted to change the black zip lock bag, he saw that the items inside were drugs.290Foot Note 290×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 24 lines 3–12; 22 July at p 15 lines 7-14.However, he did not know what drugs those were because “they were different” from the drugs he received from Alan previously.291Foot Note 291×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 24 lines 19–20; 22 July 2021 Transcript at p 15 line 10.He then called Alan and asked what those things were. Alan replied that those were “ganja”. When the accused asked what the granular substances were, Alan told him that “they were ganja but it was in different shape”.292Foot Note 292×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 24 lines 20–22; 22 July 2021 Transcript at p 15 lines 9–11. 127 This narrative is clearly at odds with what the accused said in his statements. It raises various inconsistencies as to whether he had opened exhibit D4 and seen its contents prior to his arrest, whether he asked Alan about the nature of those items, whether Alan had told him the nature of those items, and whether he had formed the belief that those items were “ganja”. 128 When the Prosecution confronted the accused with his conflicting evidence as to whether he had asked Alan about what was inside exhibit D4, the accused could not offer any satisfactory explanation. The accused initially alleged that he did not know what ASP Yang was referring to because the “questions were put to [him] at different time[s]”,293Foot Note 293×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 34 lines 3–19.but when the Prosecution brought him through what was recorded in his 2nd Long Statement, the accused readily conceded that ASP Yang had shown him precisely the same exhibits as what his counsel had referred him to during his examination-in-chief.294Foot Note 294×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 35 lines 8–11.When given another opportunity to provide an alternative explanation for this inconsistency, the accused alleged that he was not referred to any specific exhibits when his statement was recorded.295Foot Note 295×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 35 lines 12–20.This is contradicted by his 2nd Long Statement, wherein the accusedhimselfspecifically referred to exhibits D4A1, D4C1, D4C2, D4B1A, D4B2A and D4C2A and claimed that he did not know what they were.296Foot Note 296×AB 375 (para 26).Similarly, in his 3rd Long Statement, the accusedhimselfidentified exhibit D4 when alleging that he did not ask Alan what was inside it.297Foot Note 297×AB 398 (para 28). 129 Separately, the accused sought to explain his inconsistent evidence in relation to whether he opened exhibit D4, by claiming that he could not remember which bags were torn and required repackaging as “the markings were put up later”.298Foot Note 298×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 35 lines 2–9; 21 July 2021 Transcript at p 34 lines 7–9.As a result, he was uncertain as to whether he opened the packaging of the items now in exhibit D4.299Foot Note 299×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 35 lines 23–24.Far from being an explanation, this claim compounds the accused’s conflicting evidence. When the accused looked at the drugs in exhibit D4 during the recording of his 2nd Long Statement, he said that he had never opened exhibit D4.300Foot Note 300×AB 375–376 (paras 25–26).He later changed his tune during his examination-in-chief by alleging that he “saw the drugs inside” exhibit D4 because the drugs came in a torn, black zip lock bag and he replaced that bag with exhibit D4.301Foot Note 301×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 24 lines 3–5.The accused’s claim that he was uncertain as to whether he opened exhibit D4 was made at a later point during the trial, and in fact constitutes athirdposition. The fact that this was only raised late in the day belies the veracity of that claim. 130 When confronted with the inconsistencies in his evidence as to whether Alan told him about the nature of the items in exhibit D4 and his belief as to what those items were, the accused alleged that these were a result of him not thinking much when ASP Yang questioned him. He claimed that he “did not make it [sic] [him]self very clear” when ASP Yang questioned him.302Foot Note 302×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 36 line 23 to p 37 line 13.But the inconsistencies in these aspects cannot be explained on the basis that the accused was unclear or unspecific in his statements. The accused took the unequivocal position that he did not know what the items in exhibit D4 were, and implicit in that is the claim that no one told him what those items were. There was nothing unclear or unspecific in what he said in his statements. He then subsequently took a similarly unequivocal, yet contradictory position at trial that he thought they were “ganja” because Alan told him that they were “ganja”. (B) Accused’s evidence regarding the contents of exhibits D5 to D9 131 In his Contemporaneous Statement, the accused said that he did not know what was inside exhibits D5 to D9.303Foot Note 303×AB at p 291 at A1; 2 July 2021 Transcript at p 10 line 15 to p 11 line 6.He took a somewhat similar stance when his 3rd Long Statement was taken: while he knew that exhibits D5 to D9 contained something illegal and he suspected that they contained “hot one”,304Foot Note 304×AB 399 (para 32) and 402 (photo 42), read with 21 July 2021 Transcript at p 51 lines 5–8 and 22 July 2021 Transcript at p 16 line 20 to p 17 line 10.he maintained that he did not know about the contents of D5 to D9 because he did not open them up to check and did not ask Alan what was inside.305Foot Note 305×AB 398 (para 29).When shown the photographs of the other exhibits found inside exhibits D5 to D9, the accused said that he had never seen them before, had never touched them before and did not recognise them.306Foot Note 306×AB 398 (para 29) and 402–404. 132 The accused’s description of the state of his knowledge took on a different spin at trial. The accused, during his examination-in-chief, said that at the time of collection, he believed that exhibits D5 to D9 contained “grass” and “red wine” as those were the types of drugs he received from Alan on prior occasions.307Foot Note 307×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 36 lines 11–18.Later in his cross-examination and re-examination, the accused supplemented what he said in examination-in-chief by claiming that when he reached home and was about to change the bags which were torn, he realised that exhibits D5 to D9 did not carry “red wine”.308Foot Note 308×22 July 2021 Transcript at p 15 lines 23–30.This was because he saw the cubes in exhibits D5 to D9 and believed that they were “ganja”. As to how he formed this belief, the accused said that he could not recall whether he asked Alan about the cubes found in exhibits D5 to D9, but he recalled ever asking Alan about such cubes, and Alan told him that they were “ganja”.309Foot Note 309×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 41 line 2 to p 42 line 6. 133 When the Prosecution confronted the accused with the inconsistencies regarding whether he repacked the various packaging, the accused conceded that he lied in his 3rd Long Statement about never seeing and touching the contents of exhibits D5 to D9 prior to his arrest. His responses merit reproduction:310Foot Note 310×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 39 lines 2–21. Q Now, going back to your explanations last week about why your DNA was found on the number of exhibits, you explained that you would repack various packaging when they were torn. Do you recall that? A Yes. Q So, given that, what you told the IO: [Reads] “For the rest of the items in Photo 43 to Photo 46, I do not recognise them…I have never seen them…and have never touched them before.” That is a lie isn’t it?Because even on your case, you would repack them whenever you saw that the packages were torn and--- AYes.I said that if it was torn, I would repack them. And if they were not torn, I would not have repacked them. QSo why is it that you lied to the IO by telling her that you had never seen or touched any of these packages? AI forgot what questions I were put by the IO.So I did---I gave these answers. Q But your answer was very specific. You referred specifically to the rest of the items in photographs P26 to P29. You said very specifically do not recognise them, have never seen them before, have never touched them before.What---can you thinkof or can you suggest any question imposed by the IO that would explain why there is this inconsistency in your evidence? AI can’t remember what questions were put to me. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] For context, “the rest of the items in Photo 43 to Photo 46” is a reference to the other exhibits found within exhibits D5 to D9. As is evident from the extract above, the accused had no satisfactory explanation for why he lied in his 3rd Long Statement. 134 At another point during cross-examination, the accused was asked why he claimed in his 3rd Long Statement that he had suspected that exhibits D5 to D9 contained “hot one”, but later testified that he believed that exhibits D5 to D9 contained “grass”. In a feeble attempt to reconcile these two contradictory claims, the accused alleged that he thought Alan used the term “hot one” to refer to “grass”.311Foot Note 311×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 50 line 22 to p 52 line 31.In submissions, the Defence relies on this allegation to make the point that the accused believed that “hot one” referred to “grass”.312Foot Note 312×DS at paras 197 and 236. 135 Apart from the fact that this allegation was raised for the first time during trial, it falls apart once the other parts of the accused’s testimony, the accused’s statements, and the contents of the Notebooks are considered. As the Prosecution notes in its written submissions,313Foot Note 313×PS at paras 58 and 65(b).the accused testified during his examination-in-chief that Alan did not tell him anything about “hot one”.314Foot Note 314×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 38 lines 28–31.This contradicts the accused’s claim that Alan “told him” that “hot one” was a reference to “grass”. Adding to this inconsistency is the accused’s testimony at an earlier part of his cross-examination where he stated that heonlyknew “grass” as “grass organja” [emphasis in original].315Foot Note 315×16 July 2201 Transcript at p 18 lines 12–13. 136 As observed by the Prosecution, at no point in his statements did the accused associate the term “hot one” with “grass”.316Foot Note 316×PS at para 58; see AB 430 (para 66) and 21 July 2021 Transcript at p 54 lines 3–13.He did not mention this even when he was specifically asked during the recording of his 5th Long Statement whether he “knewor used any other names to refer to “grass”” [emphasis added]. The relevant portion in the 5th Long Statement reads:317Foot Note 317×AB 431–432 (paras 71–72). … I am asked if Iknowor used any other names to refer to the “grass” I mentioned in the earlier statement. … I also refer to this “grass”, which is a type of drug, as ‘Gu’ and the English term ‘grass’. … I am asked if Iknowor used other names to refer to the ‘hot one’ I mentioned in the earlier statements. … I also refer to this “hot one”, which is a type of drug, using the English term “hot”. … [emphasis added in italics] When the Prosecution pointed out to the accused that he did not mention that he knew “grass” as “hot one” in his 5th Long Statement, the accused said that this was because Alan referred to “grass” as “hot one”. He also said that Alan “told” him that he used the term “hot one” to refer to “grass”.318Foot Note 318×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 53 line 1 to p 54 line 2.This does not adequately explain why he omitted to say that he knew “grass” as “hot one”. Crucially, the accused was asked by ASP Yang whether heknewother names which were used to refer to “grass”. If Alan truly referred to “grass” as “hot one”, that would have been something squarely within the accused’s knowledge. But he did not mention this to ASP Yang. This omission from his 5th Long Statement undermines the accused’s allegation that he thought Alan used the term “hot one” to refer to “grass”. 137 Finally, the accused wrote down different entries for “HOT” and “GU” in the Notebooks.319Foot Note 319×AB 441.Given his understanding that “HOT” referred to “hot one” and “GU” referred to “grass”, it must have been clear to the accused that Alan did not refer to “grass” as “hot one”, and for the same reason, the accused could not have equated the two terms. As the Prosecution rightly contends,320Foot Note 320×PS at para 65(a).it does not make sense for the accused to have used the terms “HOT” and “GU” separately for different entries if they referred to the same drug. (C) Conclusion on the accused’s credit and the veracity of his defence at trial 138 The upshot of the evidential analysis set out above is that the accused’s evidence was littered with multiple inconsistencies for which he could not provide a satisfactory explanation. In these circumstances, I am convinced that the accused was a witness lacking in credit, and that his claim about believing that the Drugs were “grass” was a mere afterthought. (2) The accused’s narrative of how he came to believe that the Drugs were “ganja” was improbable 139 Quite apart from the fact that the accused’s evidence drastically shifted across his statements and oral testimony, the accused’s explanation at trial as to how he had formed his belief that the Drugs were “ganja” is also improbable in the light of other pieces of evidence. 140 First, it was unlikely that Alan had lied to the accused that the Drugs in exhibit D4 were “ganja”. There was no reason for Alan to lie. Alan had on multiple occasions told the accused the type of drugs the accused had received, so that he could hold the accused accountable. On the accused’s own account at trial, Alan told the accused to take notes, so that if he subsequently asked the accused what the accused was keeping for him, the accused would be able to answer him.321Foot Note 321×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 19 lines 23–26.This is corroborated by the accused’s statements and the entries in the Notebooks, which indicate that the accused had recorded down the various types of drugs he handled.322Foot Note 322×AB 399 (para 31), 400 (para 34), 430 (paras 65–66), 436, 439–447.There is also no evidence indicating that the accused would refuse to help Alan had he known that the drugs were diamorphine. 141 Second, even if Alan did tell the accused that the Drugs in exhibit D4 were “ganja”, it was unbelievable that the accused would blindly trust Alan. The accused’s first and only meeting with Alan was at a playground. On the accused’s own evidence, that meeting yielded next to no details about Alan’s background. Alan did not tell the accused if he had a Chinese name. Neither did he tell the accused his full name. Alan also did not tell the accused his occupation and whether he stayed in Singapore or Malaysia.323Foot Note 323×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 6 lines 1–18.In these circumstances, the accused’s assertion that he regarded Alan as his friend after their “normal chit-chat” at the playground324Foot Note 324×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 6 lines 19–28.rings hollow. The accused’s one and only interaction with Alan was superficial at best and it is implausible that he would readily take Alan’s words at face value. 142 The accused must at the very least put forward an explanation as to why he still trusted Alan’s assertion as to the nature of the Drugs in exhibit D4 in spite of the abovementioned circumstances. No tenable explanation was forthcoming. The Defence’s main submission is that the accused had no reason to think that Alan was lying to him.325Foot Note 325×DS at para 234; DRS at para 4.Connected to this is also the submission that there is nothing to show that the accused was suspicious of the Drugs being diamorphine.326Foot Note 326×DRS at para 4.But these do not constitutepositive reasonsexplaining why the accusednevertheless believedAlan’s assurancedespite barely knowing him. That the Drugs had the same “brownish” colour as “ganja” is also an unviable explanation. Implicit in the accused’s account at trial is an acknowledgement that even though the Drugs had the same “brownish” colour as “ganja”, the Drugs in exhibit D4stilllooked differentfrom the accused’s understanding of what “ganja” typically looked like, which was why the accused allegedly did not know what the Drugs were and had to check with Alan. The question which then arises is whether it is plausible that the accused would trust Alan that the Drugs were “ganja” (or “ganja” in a different shape) despite the visual differences between the Drugs and the accused’s understanding of what “ganja” typically looked like. That brings us back to the implausibility of the accused’s trust in Alan, and the lack of a countervailing explanation as to why the accused would readily accept Alan’s words at face value. Conclusion on whether the accused rebutted the s 18(2) presumption 143 I am not convinced that the accused has rebutted the s 18(2) presumption on a balance of probabilities for the foregoing reasons. 144 For completeness, I make a few final remarks to address parties’ submissions. First, the Defence advances the argument that the Prosecution has not been able to prove that the accused knew that “hot one” referred to diamorphine.327Foot Note 327×DS at para 235.However, it is not necessary for the Prosecution to prove this. The Prosecution invokes the s 18(2) presumption, which places the burden of proof on the Defence to rebut that presumption on a balance of probabilities. One of the obstacles standing in the way of the Defence is the accused’s admission that he suspected that exhibits D5 to D9 contained “hot one” (see above at [131]). This contradicts the Defence’s case that the accused believed that the Drugs were “ganja”. To overcome this, and in an attempt to rebut the s 18(2) presumption, the Defence makes the submission that the accused believed that “hot one” referred to “grass”.328Foot Note 328×DS at paras 197 and 236.For this submission to be rejected altogether, all the Prosecution needs to show is that it is untrue that the accused believed that “hot one” referred to “grass”; and this is what the Prosecution has done (see above at [135]–[137]). 145 Secondly, I accept the Defence’s submission that the previous delivery of “hot one” to Ah Poh is not,on its own, relevant in shedding light on the accused’s knowledge about the contents of exhibits D4 to D9.329Foot Note 329×DS at paras 187 and 205.There is no evidence that the accused was told what “hot one” meant when he made that delivery to Ah Poh.330Foot Note 330×DS at para 205.There is no evidence that the accused saw the drugs on that occasion.331Foot Note 331×DS at para 189.There is also no evidence establishing what the accused had actually delivered on that occasion.332Foot Note 332×DS at para 188.",
        "Issue 2: Possession for the purpose of trafficking": "Applicable legal principles 146 Under s 2 of the MDA, “traffic” means to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute, or to offer to do any of these things. 147 An accused person who returns the drugs to the person who originally deposited those drugs with him would not ordinarily come within the definition of “trafficking”. It follows that a person who holds the drugs only with the intention to return them to the person who originally deposited those drugs with him does not possess the drugs “for the purpose of trafficking”:Ramesha/l Perumal v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2019] 1 SLR 1003(“RameshPerumal”) at [110]. In this connection, the Court of Appeal inRameshPerumalat [110] stressed that there is a fundamental difference between the aforementioned type of possession, and possession with a view to passing the drugs onwards to a third party: … In the former situation, the returning of the drugs to a person who already was in possession of them to begin with cannot form part of the process of disseminating those drugs in a particular direction –ie, from a source of supply towards the recipients to whom the drugs are to be supplied – because the act of returning the drugs runs counter to that very direction. On the other hand, in the latter situation, the intended transfer of the drugs to a third party is presumptively part of the process of moving the drugs along a chain in which they will eventually be distributed to their final consumer. 148 Nevertheless, there is no need for the Prosecution to prove that an accused who transfers, or intends to transfer, the drugs from one party to another has any end-user within his contemplation or any specific intention to purvey the drugs to consumers in particular:RameshPerumalat [113]. Neither is there a need for the Prosecution to prove that the accused was moving the drugs closer to their ultimate consumer:RameshPerumalat [114]. This sufficiently disposes of the Defence’s contention that the Prosecution has not proven that the accused intended to move the Drugs along the supply chain towards the end-users.333Foot Note 333×DS at p 105 and para 255. Defence’s case 149 Relying onRamesh Perumal, the Defence submits that the accused had the intention of returning the Drugs to Alan after receiving and keeping them on Alan’s behalf (the “Bailment Defence”).334Foot Note 334×DS at para 247.For this submission, the Defence relies on the accused’s testimony at trial that he was only helping Alan to keep his drugs and would return the drugs to Alan by placing them at locations for Alan’s men to collect.335Foot Note 335×DS at para 194.In so far as the Drugs in exhibits D4 to D9 are concerned, Alan had told the accused to keep them for him and that he would send his men to take them back. However, the accused was arrested before Alan made arrangements to take the Drugs back.336Foot Note 336×DS at paras 196 and 251.In support of its submissions that the accused was only helping Alan, the Defence points to the accused’s claim that he did not receive any fixed remuneration from Alan.337Foot Note 337×DS at para 195. Prosecution’s case 150 On the other hand, the Prosecution submits that the accused had possessed the Drugs for the purposes of trafficking, and urges this court to reject the accused’s Bailment Defence: (a) The accused admitted in his statements that the Drugs were in his possession for trafficking.338Foot Note 338×PS at para 81. (b) The accused had consistently admitted in his statements that whenever Alan sent drugs to him, such drugs were intended for delivery to other persons.339Foot Note 339×PS at paras 88–89.This, the Prosecution argues, is corroborated by the Notebooks, in which the accused listed 18 distinct names of persons whom he passed drugs to previously. The Prosecution also highlights that the accused expressly denied collecting anything from anyone to pass to Alan.340Foot Note 340×PS at para 90.The Prosecution clarifies that it is not relying on such evidence to argue that the accused had a propensity to traffic drugs for Alan. Rather, the Prosecution seeks to rely on such evidence to show the accused’s state of mind on 20 November 2018, and the nature of the accused’s relationship with Alan.341Foot Note 341×PS at para 88. (c) The accused’s account at trial regarding the nature of his relationship with Alan,ie, he was doing Alan a favour by safekeeping illicit drugs for Alan, is inherently incredible.342Foot Note 342×PS at para 96. (i) On the accused’s account, Alan was a mere acquaintance who he had only met once,343Foot Note 343×PS at para 97.and it was particularly bizarre that the accused would continue to “help” Alan even after knowing that he was dealing with drugs.344Foot Note 344×PS at para 99. (ii) The accused would not only collect drugs from Alan’s men, but also repack them and replace the labels.345Foot Note 345×PS at para 98.The accused was also in possession of drug paraphernalia (clear plastic wrapping, empty black packets, empty plastic bags and tapes), which suggests that he was repacking the drugs.346Foot Note 346×PS at para 100. (iii) Further, the accused kept a record of what he received, where he placed the drugs as directed by Alan, and was accountable to Alan regarding where, and to whom, the drugs were delivered.347Foot Note 347×PS at para 98. (iv) Given that the accused was struggling financially at the material time, it is incredible that the accused would do so much for no financial reward.348Foot Note 348×PS at para 101. (d) The accused was employed by Alan to pack and deliver the Drugs.349Foot Note 349×PS at paras 102–105. (e) The accused’s Bailment Defence is an afterthought that is entirely illogical and unsupported by evidence.350Foot Note 350×PS at paras 106–115. 151 In the alternative, the Prosecution submits that even if the accused was safekeeping the Drugs for Alan with a view of returning them to Alan, the definition of trafficking under s 2 of the MDA is still satisfied. The accused has not provided any evidence showing that Alan was the person who originally deposited the Drugs with him. In fact, he testified that an unknown person, who was not Alan, would normally deposit the drugs for his collection. Given the accused’s account that he was supposed to pass the Drugs to another of Alan’s men, the accused was moving the Drugs along the chain of distribution – he took possession of the Drugs from an unknown person for the purpose of giving them to someone else whose identity he did not know.351Foot Note 351×PS at paras 76–77.Furthermore, theRamesh Perumalexception is a very narrow one, which only applies to a mere bailee who holds the drugs with a view of returning them to a bailor,without more. The accused had agreed to receive illicit drugs from Alan on numerous occasions and had received a large variety of drugs of significant quantities. Instead of simply returning the drugs to Alan, the accused would assist in repacking the drugs if the packaging was torn. He was also paid for his assistance. Consequently, even if the accused was just “safekeeping” the drugs, he was a “professional bailee” who was an integral part of the process of moving the drugs towards the ultimate customer.352Foot Note 352×PS at paras 78–79. Evidential analysis 152 I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused possessed the Drugs in exhibits D4 to D9 for the purposes of trafficking. 153 First, the accused admitted in his Contemporaneous Statement that Alan had told him to keep the Drugs in exhibits D5 to D9 to “pass it to others” (see above at [66]).353Foot Note 353×AB 291 at A3.He did not mention in his Contemporaneous Statement that he was going to pass the Drugs to Alan’s men. 154 Second, having regard to the approach taken inPublic Prosecutor v Ranjit Singh GillMenjeet Singh and another[2017] 3 SLR 66 at [17]–[19] andMohammad Farid bin Batra v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and other matters[2020] 1 SLR 907 at [107] in relation to evidence of previous dealings, I accept that the Prosecution can rely on the accused’s admissions in his Long Statements regarding his previous drug dealings with Alan. They are relevant not for the purpose of showing that the accused had a propensity to traffic drugs for Alan, but for the purpose of shedding light on the accused’s state of mind in relation to the Drugs in exhibits D4 to D9 and for the purpose of giving the court a complete account of the arrangements he had with Alan. While the Defence has sought to challenge the accuracy with which those admissions were recorded, I have found above that the Defence’s case on this point is lacking in merit. As a result, they constitute cogent evidence from which strong inferences can be drawn as to the accused’s state of mind in relation to the Drugs as well as his relationship with Alan. 155 Turning now to the aforementioned admissions, the accused had consistently admitted in his 2nd, 3rd and 5th Long Statements that Alan sent drugs to him so that he could deliver them to other persons.354Foot Note 354×See AB 374–375 (paras 21–23 and 25), 399 (para 31), 401 (para 38) and 429 (para 62).Notably, it was never mentioned in the accused’s statements that these other persons were Alan’s men. He also explained in his 3rd and 5th Long Statements that he would use the Notebooks to record down “what ‘drugs’ [he] helped ‘Alan’ to send on his behalf”,355Foot Note 355×AB 399 (para 31).and the “names of the recipients whom [he] delivered ‘drugs’ to by placing them at [a] location”.356Foot Note 356×AB 429–430 (para 65).This is borne out by the entries in the Notebooks, which contained 18 distinct names of persons whom he had passed drugs to previously. Corroborating the accused’s statements is what the accused testified to at multiple points during his examination-in-chief. When asked about what he had said in his 2nd, 3rd and 5th Long Statements, the accused maintained that he knew that the drugs in his possession were meant for somebody else because Alan said so, but he did not know who those people were.357Foot Note 357×See 16 July 2021 Transcript at p 32 line 21 to p 34 line 28, p 40 lines 14–20, p 41 line 17 to p 42 line 4.All these indicate that the arrangement between Alan and the accused involved the accused receiving drugs on Alan’s behalf, and then delivering or sending them to third parties on his behalf. They also demonstrate the accused’s awareness that he was delivering drugs to third parties on Alan’s behalf. 156 Pertinently, the accused said in his 3rd Long Statement that he wouldaskAlan “who [were] the drugs meant for when [he] placed them at a location” and note down who he was supposed to send the drugs to.358Foot Note 358×AB 400 (para 34).This reveals that the arrangement between the accused and Alan wasnotfor the accused to return the drugs to Alan, and the accused was well aware of this. Had this arrangement been in place, there would have been no need for the accused to ask Alan who the drugs were for and note down the names of the intended recipients. 157 As against these repeated admissions by the accused regarding his arrangement with Alan, the Defence points out that Alan had not told the accused what to do with the Drugs,359Foot Note 359×DS at paras 251 and 255.but does not point to any evidence which indicates a change in the usual arrangement or that the accused intended to deal with the Drugs differently. It can be concluded, from the state of the evidence before me, that the accused was in possession of the Drugs with the intention to deliver them to third-party recipient(s), as per his usual arrangement with Alan. 158 In this regard, the accused’s Bailment Defence fails to raise a reasonable doubt in so far as the element of trafficking is concerned. The Bailment Defence was raised for the first time at trial,360Foot Note 360×16 July 2021 Transcript at p 17 lines 23–27.and its belated nature belies its truth. If the accused truly intended to return the Drugs to Alan, he had multiple opportunities to mention it in his statements. 159 Furthermore, the Bailment Defence is inherently unbelievable. On the accused’s account of events (see above at [90]–[99]), Alan called him out of the blue six months after their first and only meeting to ask if he could keep his things at the accused’s place. The accused agreed, and helped Alan store his things on multiple occasions. What is baffling is that even after the accused found out that Alan had been sending him illicit drugs for storage, the accused continued to “help” Alan, someone whom he barely knew, keep drugs (including the Drugs) without any protest and for no payment notwithstanding that he was facing substantial financial difficulties. 160 In this connection, the accused had been unemployed for two years at the time of his arrest. He stopped working for his father two years before his arrest and since then, did not have any other sources of income apart from the allowance that his parents gave to him as and when he needed money.361Foot Note 361×AB 369 (para 4); 21 July 2021 Transcript at p 24 line 18 to p 25 line 29 and p 27 lines 17–19.During cross-examination, he claimed that he earned about $1000 a month selling handphone accessories online but this did not feature anywhere in his statements.362Foot Note 362×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 27 line 20 to p 28 line 6Even if I accept that he had this additional source of income, that would not undermine the fact that the accused was in fact facing financial difficulties at the material time. The accused himself acknowledged that prior to his arrest, he was facing financial difficulties to the extent that he had to pawn not only his own items but also his parents’ items.363Foot Note 363×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 26 lines 1–16 and p 28 lines 7–13; AB 414 (para 50).As at 16 October 2018, he only had $10.20 in his bank account.364Foot Note 364×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 27 lines 7–12.It is also undisputed that all this while, the accused had to fund his daily consumption of Ice365Foot Note 365×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 28 lines 14–15.as well as gambling habit.366Foot Note 366×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 21 line 6.I also note that he admitted in his 4th Long Statement that he was losing money in online casino betting.367Foot Note 367×AB 414 (para 50). 161 When the Prosecution gave the accused an opportunity to explain why he decided to continue helping Alan despite realising that Alan had been sending him illicit drugs for storage, the accused’s only response was to reiterate that Alan had asked him to help.368Foot Note 368×21 July 2021 Transcript at p 11 lines 26–32.No coherent reason was put forward. In these circumstances, the readiness of the accused to help Alan, even after finding out that Alan had been sending him illicit drugs, remains unexplained. 162 For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had possessed the Drugs with the intention to deliver them to third parties, instead of returning them to Alan. The accused therefore had the intention to traffic the Drugs. Conclusion on whether the accused possessed the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking 163 I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had the Drugs in his possession for the purposes of trafficking, and that the accused’s Bailment Defence fails to raise a reasonable doubt on this point.",
        "Conclusion": "164 For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the Charge against the accused has been made out. I therefore convict the accused of committing the offence listed in the Charge. Dedar Singh GillJudge of the High Court Wuan Kin Lek Nicholas, Pavithra Ramkumar and Heershan Kaur (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution; Cheong Jun Ming Mervyn (Advocatus Law LLP) and Lau Kah Hee (BC Lim & Lau LLC) for the accused."
