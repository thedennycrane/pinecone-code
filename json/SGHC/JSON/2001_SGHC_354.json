        "No objection should be taken by your clients to vitiate the agreement to be\n\n  entered into in the event of unilateral terminations (sic) of the Agreement by the Landlord": ".We have been instructed by our clients to incorporate the above terms in the\n\n  said agreement. Further we have also been informed by our clients that they are unable to enter\n\n  the said premises to check on the extent of the unauthorised renovation works carried out by your\n\n  clients to the said premises. Kindly let us have a date to inspect the said premises on an urgent\n\n  basis.[Emphasis added.]48.    On 19 October 2000, Kenneth Tan replied as follows:We refer to your fax to us dated 18 October 2000. Our instructions are as\n\n  follows:(a)Our client denies carrying out unauthorised renovation work. Rather,\n\n  and as was mentioned during the meeting on 14 October 2000, it was your client who has not\n\n  obtained all required approvals for the renovation work she did, which resulted in the landlord of\n\n  the premises (who apparently therefore cannot be issued the CSC) demanding that she regularise\n\n  such work within a month or face legal action.(b) .(c) Our client has been advised that the renovation works do not require prior\n\n  approval from any authority prior to commencement of works.They involve minor internal\n\n  addition and alteration works, and do not compromise the structural integrity of the premises.\n\n  Nonetheless, and as your clients are undoubtedly aware, our client intends to submit necessary\n\n  documents from time to time, according to industry practice, to the relevant authorities. However,\n\n  and as your Mr Swami was twice informed by our Mr Lewis Koh today,your client Ms Chan Ai Leng\n\n  has not endorsed and has even taken away plans to be submitted to the URA, FSB and BCA for\n\n  approval, in breach of her agreement to \"co-operate\" with our client. Your client\n\n  will undoubtedly realise that the retention of such plans is to her detriment as they are\n\n  intended, not only to cover the intended works, but also to regularise her omission in respect of\n\n  her renovations, and we trust she will therefore hand over the endorsed plans accordingly. Also,such\n\n  retention does not detract from her patent approval of the renovations works as borne out by the\n\n  many plans and forms which she has already signed. In the event that, contrary to normal practice,\n\n  your client insists that all work be suspended until approvals are applied for and obtained, then\n\n  it would not be equitable for our client to be made to continue lending your client money to pay\n\n  the rent in the interim.(d) Before such time our client takes over all the shares in the Company,our\n\n  client regrets that he does not have any locus or nexus to obtain the landlords consent,\n\n  assuming in the first place that such consent is required. Our client does not see how there was\n\n  any breach, let alone a fundamental one as alleged. We trust your client understands that our\n\n  client cannot stop anyone from commencing legal proceedings even if, in our clients view, there\n\n  is insufficient basis to found a legal suit.Be that as it may, our client suggests that a meeting be convened tomorrow\n\n  between your clients and ours to resolve the matter amicably.We look forward to receiving your draft agreement, which was due to have been\n\n  transmitted to us yesterday, in the meantime.[Emphasis added.]49.    On 20 October 2000, M N Swami wrote to Kenneth Tan as follows:RE: HONEY ENTERTAINMENT PTE LTDAND SHARE AGREEMENTWe refer to your fax dated 19.10.2000.Our clients reiterate what has been set out in our letter dated 18.10.2000.",
        "The Landlord has requested to inspect the premises at 4.00 p.m. today": ".We shall be obliged if you could kindly advise your clients to open the said\n\n  premises to the Landlord or their servants or agents, as they are entitled to inspect the premises\n\n  as per the terms of the Tenancy Agreement.Our clients representative will be at the said premises as well.Due to the fresh development, we need to have further discussions after\n\n  inspection of the premises before we can enter into an Agreement.In the meanwhile, please note that our client had at no time authorised your\n\n  clients to replace the old locks with the new locks andkindly advise your clients to handover\n\n  a set of keys to our clients immediately.[Emphasis added.]50.    Ms Chan said she asked Mr Ng to attend the inspection. He did not. He did\n\nhowever arrange for a messenger to bring one key on 20 October 2000.51.    According to Mr Yeo, the inspection was attended by:(a) Ms Chan(b) The Landlords representative, Nicholas(c) Mr Yeo Chye Teck, the architect(d) A professional engineer Mr John Portwood (the PE).(NE 71 line 11)52.    Ms Chan said that when the Landlords representative saw the extent of\n\nthe Unauthorised Works, he threatened to repossess the Premises immediately as the works were\n\ncarried out without the Landlords consent or approval from the relevant authorities. He also\n\nthreatened to take legal action and hold Ms Chan and Honey liable for all damages, i.e to claim the\n\nreinstatement costs and legal fees and forfeit the deposit (see para 13 of her AEIC and NE 49 line\n\n18 and 19).53.    According to Mr Yeo, he had received a telephone call from the Landlord on\n\n14 October 2000. In para 13 of his AEIC, he said:13. By the 14th of October 2000, I did not receive the said computer\n\n  drawings or the interior design from Tony Teo to enable me to finalise the submission. However at\n\n  about 4.30p.m on the same day, I received a phone call from the landlord that he had received\n\n  (sic) from his upstairs tenants that there are heavy hacking from the premises. The landlord told\n\n  me that when he went to the premises, he found that the party walls and toilet walls had been\n\n  hacked off. He had also stated that the glass panel on the external wall outside the premises had\n\n  been removed and that he feared that the bricks above the opening could fall. The landlord told me\n\n  that he had taken photographs of the contractor who was seen hacking the walls. He told me that\n\n  pursuant to what had happened to the premises without his approval, he wanted to re-possess the\n\n  premises immediately and claim for damages. At his request I went to look at the opening from\n\n  outside the premises to ascertain whether the bricks could fall from the top.54.    In re-examination, Mr Yeo added that the Landlords representative had\n\nsaid he wanted to take action against him (NE 72 line 14).55.    On 21 October 2000, Kenneth Tan wrote to M N Swami to state:We refer to your fax to us dated 20 October 2000.",
        "We were instructed to reiterate that your clients authorised the renovation\n\n  works": "and for this purpose willingly gave our client the keys to the premises. .We now turn to the fifth paragraph of your said fax, in respect of which we\n\n  have been instructed as follow:(a) Our client has always been willing to discuss matters with your clients,\n\n  whether or not there is any \"fresh development\". However, your client Ms Chan Ai Leng\n\n  did not meet our client at the agreed appointed time, and our client was therefore left waiting\n\n  for your client to show up yesterday morning. Your client Ms Chan Ai Leng also neither answered\n\n  nor returned our clients calls as well. Further, your client Ms Chan Ai Leng, despite numerous\n\n  requests including that set out in our fax to you of 19 October 2000,has neglected, failed\n\n  and/or refused to remedy her breach of agreement to co-operate by handing over the plansto\n\n  inter alia regularise your clients non-compliance which plans she took. For the avoidance of\n\n  doubt, all our clients rights are hereby reserved; and(b) Even before one can enter into an agreement, it is imperative that there be\n\n  a draft of such agreement on the table to discuss. Our client therefore requests that you transmit\n\n  to us without further delaya copy of the draft agreement, which you said you could draft and\n\n  deliver latest by 18 October 2000,this Monday 23 October2000, for our clients\n\n  instructions and comments. Thank you.[Emphasis added.]56.    Ms Chan said that it was she who tried to contact Mr Ng between 15 and 20\n\nOctober 2000 (NE 33 line 10 to 16). She disagreed that it was Mr Ng who tried to contact her about\n\nthe sale of shares agreement.57.    On 23 October 2000, the Landlords solicitors Dennis Singham & Teresa\n\nChan & Partners (Dennis Singham) sent an urgent fax to M N Swami. It stated:No 33 Mohamed Sultan Road #01-01, #01-02, #01-03, #01-04 &\n\n  #01-05/06 Singapore 238977Tenancy Agreement dated 3rdSeptember 1999We refer to the above mentioned matter. We also refer to the writers\n\n  conversation with you this afternoon.We have been instructed by our client to inform you that under the terms of the\n\n  Tenancy Agreement dated 3rdSeptember 1999, your client was required by clause 2(j) to\n\n  obtain the written consent of the owner before carrying out any alterations, structural or\n\n  otherwise to the premises. It has come to our clients knowledge that on the 14thOctober 2000, your client caused her contractors to remove the party wall between the units and\n\n  further removed the walls to the various toilets. This is a serious breach of the Tenancy\n\n  Agreement particularly as our clients written consent was not obtained prior to the said works.\n\n  Our client has also been advised that the said works constitutes a structural change which\n\n  requires Building Control approval. To-date we understand that no such approval has been obtained.On behalf of our client, we are hereby instructed to inform you that in view of\n\n  your clients serious breach of the Tenancy Agreement our client exercises their right to\n\n  re-enter into the premises under clause 4(e) of the Agreement whereupon this Tenancy shall\n\n  absolutely determine without prejudice to our clients right of action or remedy in respect of\n\n  the said breach.Can you please let us know by the latest 4pm on 24thOctober 2000\n\n  when possession to the premises can be peacefully surrendered to our client. We trust that your\n\n  client will heed our demand and that possession will be given back to our client peacefully.58.    In cross-examination, Ms Chan said that she had not informed Mr Ng about\n\nDennis Singhams fax but in re-examination she claimed that she did.59.    Subsequently the Landlords solicitors met with M N Swami on 27 October\n\n2000 as a result of which it was agreed that:(a) Honey would surrender the Premises on 30 October 2000 on receipt of the\n\n  return of the deposit less $10,000 i.e $96,000 less $10,000.(b) The Landlord would undertake the responsibility of reinstating the Premises.(c) There would be no further claims by the Landlord or Honey against each other.The Premises were accordingly surrendered on 30 October 2000 and $86,000 was\n\nreturned to Honey.60.    In response to an inquiry by Kenneth Tan dated 30 October 2000 about the\n\ndraft agreement, M N Swami replied on 31 October 2000 to inform them that the Premises had been\n\nreturned to the Landlord.61.    As far as reinstatement works were concerned, Ms Chan said she had\n\nconsulted Mr Yeo and he had estimated reinstatement costs to be $300,000. Mr Yeo confirmed that it\n\nwould cost not less than $300,000 (NE 66 line 15).62.    On some of the items constituting the Unauthorised Works, Mr Yeos\n\nevidence was that the cost of reinstating just the two party walls which were demolished on Mr Ngs\n\ninstructions was estimated to be $25,000 to $30,000. The cost of reinstating the five toilets would\n\nbe $10,000 each. On these items alone, the cost would be about $80,000.63.    Ms Chan said that Honey did not have the money to do reinstatement works\n\nand this was not challenged.64.    Mr Ngs evidence on doing reinstatement works vacillated.65.    Initially when his attention was drawn to the fax dated 18 October 2000\n\nfrom M N Swami to Kenneth Tan, he said that he did not take steps to reinstate the Premises because\n\nhe was of the view that this was not the solution (NE 16 line 16 to 21).66.    He also did not believe that the Unauthorised Works would jeopardize the\n\ntenancy agreement because they were not serious enough (NE 23 line 1 to 5). He had taken the\n\nposition that they did not affect the structural integrity of the Premises.67.    Then he said that as events unfolded he did not even have the chance to\n\nreinstate or consider reinstating the Premises (NE 23 line 10 to 13).68.    In his view, the matter could have been regularised with a bit of\n\ncommunication with the Landlord. However his idea of regularisation was to show the Landlord that\n\nHoney was not just taking steps to rectify what had existed but to show his (Mr Ngs) plans to the\n\nLandlord so that the Landlord could get the Certificate of Statutory Completion for the Premises (NE\n\n24 line 10 to 17).69.    He said he kept pursuing Ms Chan for the endorsement of the plans but he\n\nwas not successful (NE 24 line 19 to NE 25 line 12).70.    On Ms Chans part, she said she took away the plan (or plans) from Mr Yeos\n\noffice as she did not want Mr Ng to carry on with renovation work without the consent of the\n\nLandlord. She did not see any point in co-operating with Mr Ng in view of the Unauthorised Works\n\n(para 43 of her AEIC).71.    She disagreed that she was not willing to co-operate with Mr Ng to rectify\n\nthe situation with the Landlord (NE 40 line 9 to NE 41 line 8).72.    As it turned out, the demolished party walls and toilets were not\n\nreinstated and the Premises are currently used by someone else (NE 66 line 23 to NE 67 line 5).ARGUMENTS AND MY CONCLUSION73.    Mr Ng initially took the position that the Unauthorised Works did not\n\nrequire the approval of any authority. He relied on a notice issued by the Building Control\n\nDivision, Public Works Department dated 1 April 1998.74.    The notice states:NOTICE TO OWNER OF NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGSEXEMPTION FROM APPROVAL FOR MINOR BUILDING WORKSAND ALTERATIONS TO NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS1. Under the provisions of the Building Control Act (Cap. 29), certain building\n\n  works and alterations to a non-residential building which are considered as minor or of no\n\n  structural significance or impact do not require approval of plans or a permit for carrying out\n\n  building works from the Building Authority. A list of these minor building works are given in Part\n\n  A of the Schedule.2. Whilst these minor building works and alterations may be exempted under the\n\n  Building Control Act, some of the works may be subject to the control of other authorities. You\n\n  are advised to consult or liaise directly with the relevant authorities listed in Part B of the\n\n  Schedule before carrying out any of the minor building works.3. .4. .5. If you need any further clarification, please check with officers of the PWDs\n\n  Building Control Division.75.    Part A of the Schedule states:LIST OF MINOR BUILDING WORKS AND ALTERATIONS TO A NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDING\n\n  WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE APPROVAL OF PLANS OF BUILDING WORKS OR PERMIT TO CARRY OUT BUILDING WORKS\n\n  FROM THE BUILDING AUTHORITY.1 to 12. .13. The creation of any opening in a non-load bearing wall or the sealing up of\n\n  any wall opening.14. The demolition, restoration or reinstatement of any non-load bearing wall.15. Replacement or changing of windows and doors.16. Replacement of existing floor and wall finishes.17. Replacement or changing of any false ceiling with lightweight materials.18. .19. Erection or alteration of any partition or partition wall constructed of\n\n  lightweight material.20. .21. .22. .23. .24. .25. In this list -.\"non-load bearing wall\" means a wall which\n\n  supports no load other than its own weight; and76.    Part B of the Schedule states:1. Before commencement of any of the minor building works listed out in Part\n\n  A, please consult or liaise directly with the following authorities and comply with their\n\n  requirements, wherever applicable:(a) Chief PlannerDevelopment Control DivisionUrban Redevelopment Authority45 Maxwell RoadURA BuildingSingapore 069118(b) DirectorFire Safety Bureau25A Paterson RoadSingapore 238511(c) Chief EngineerCentral Building Plan Unit40 Scotts Road #12-00Environmental BuildingSingapore 228231Footnote:1. .2. Exemption from the approval of plans and a permit to carry out building\n\n  works should not be construed as exemption from compliance with the building regulations.77.    Appendix A states:Appendix A: BUILDING WORKS WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE PLANNING PERMISSION FROM THE\n\n  CHIEF PLANNER, URAThe following items can be processed by the Building Control Division without\n\n  planning permission from the Chief Planner, URA:-a. Internal re-arrangement of approved uses without change in primary\n\n  use/quantum or floor area.b. Internal partitioning or re-partitioning within tenanted areas excluding\n\n  common areas.c to q .However, there was an important note which states:The above does not apply to gazetted conservation areas and monuments. (Back\n\n  to Table of Content)79.    As it turned out, the Premises were in a gazetted conservation area.80.    Even if no permission of any relevant authority was required, Honey was\n\nstill required under Clause 2(h) of the tenancy agreement (set out in para 36 above) to ensure that\n\nany works mentioned in Clause 2(g) (which included the Unauthorised Works) be carried out by\n\nspecialist sub-contractors to be approved by the Landlord and this was not done. Indeed, in para 8\n\nof the Supplement to Plaintiffs Opening Statement, it was conceded that the Unauthorised Works\n\nwere done without the concurrence of the Landlord.81.    I would add that it was also conceded that they were done without the\n\nconcurrence of the Defendants although the faxes from Kenneth Tan dated 19 and 21 October 2000,\n\nwhich I have cited in paras 48 and 55 above, and Mr Ngs pleadings had alleged that the\n\nDefendants/Ms Chan had authorised such works.82.    Also, the insistence by Mr Ng that the Unauthorised Works were not\n\nstructural was besides the point. They were done in breach of the tenancy agreement.83.    Accordingly the fact that the demolished party walls and demolished toilets\n\nhave not been subsequently reinstated by the Landlord or a new tenant and the Premises are being\n\ncurrently used by a new tenant did not assist Mr Ng.84.    Furthermore, while he categorised the Unauthorised Works as minor, Mr Yeo\n\ndescribed them as, Major and the landlord was very furious (NE 72 line 6). Also, Mr Ng did not\n\ncall any architect to give evidence on the nature of the Unauthorised Works.85.    The truth of the matter was that Mr Ng was in too much of a rush to do the\n\nUnauthorised Works, because the faster I finish, the earlier I can open the premises for business\n\n(NE 9 line 10).86.    He had assumed that the Landlord would not mind the Unauthorised Works and\n\nwould allow him to get the paper work done concurrently with the physical works as, in his view,\n\nthat was the normal practice. In my view, even if this was the normal practice, which would be\n\nagainst the law, a landlord should at least be notified in advance of such works and his concurrence\n\nobtained.87.    Mr Ng had said he did not want Honeys tenancy to be jeopardized when he\n\nmade some advance payments to or on behalf of Honey. Yet the Unauthorised Works did precisely just\n\nthat.88.    Mr Edwin Kung, acting for Mr Ng, submitted that Ms Chan and the other\n\nDefendants were repudiating the sale agreement and were evidencing an intention not to be bound by\n\nit because they had put Honey in the position where Honey would no longer have the tenancy. He also\n\nsubmitted that Mr Ng had rescinded the sale agreement by a subsequent letter from Kenneth Tan dated\n\n6 November 2000.89.    In my view, there was no doubt that Ms Chan wanted to proceed with the sale\n\nof the shares in Honey but the Unauthorised Works had put a spanner in the works.90.    The surrender of the tenancy was not to repudiate the sale agreement but\n\nwas to mitigate the damage caused by Mr Ngs irresponsible action as the Landlord was threatening\n\nto terminate the tenancy, forfeit the deposit and claim reinstatement and legal costs.91.    Any suggestion that the draft agreement still had not been prepared by her\n\nsolicitors by 18 October 2000, must also be seen in the context of the Unauthorised Works and the\n\nLandlords reaction thereto. Indeed, in para 7 of the Supplement to Plaintiffs Opening\n\nStatement, it was conceded that the Defendants had taken steps to get the agreement drafted.92.    In addition, any suggestion that Ms Chan was subsequently withholding plans\n\nmust be seen in the context that she had trusted Mr Ng by handing over the keys to the Premises only\n\nto discover that he had carried out the Unauthorised Works. There was otherwise no reluctance on her\n\npart to assist him. As I have mentioned, earlier she had on 10 or 11 October 2000, at his request,\n\nwhen she met him at a hotel, signed some renovation plans.93.    The main point raised for Mr Ng was that Honey should not have surrendered\n\nthe Premises to the Landlord.94.    On this point, Mr Kung did not assert that there was no breach of the\n\ntenancy agreement.95.    Instead, he argued that the notice from the Landlords solicitors Dennis\n\nSingham was invalid, relying on s 18(1) and (10) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap\n\n61) (CLPA).96.    Section 18(1) CLPA states:Restrictions on and relief against forfeiture of leases.18. (1) A right of re-entry or forfeiture under any provision or stipulation in\n\n  a lease, for a breach of any covenant or condition in a lease, shall not be enforceable, by action\n\n  or otherwise, unless the lessor serves on the lessee a notice specifying the particular breach\n\n  complained of and, if the breach is capable of remedy, requiring the lessee to remedy the breach,\n\n  and, in any case, requiring the lessee to make compensation in money for the breach, and the\n\n  lessee fails, within a reasonable time thereafter, to remedy the breach, if it is capable of\n\n  remedy, and to make reasonable compensation in money, to the satisfaction of the lessor, for the\n\n  breach.97.    Section 18(10) CLPA states:(10) This section shall apply to leases before, on or after 1st August 1886,\n\n  and shall have effect notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary.98.    Mr Kung argued that under s 18(1) CLPA the notice from Dennis Singham must\n\ngive sufficient details of the breach by Honey and this was not done.99.    InLee Tat Realty Pte Ltd v Limco Products Manufacturing Pte Ltd &\n\nOrs[1999] 1 SLR 263, Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) said that a valid notice under s 18(1)\n\nCLPA must contain sufficient particulars of the alleged breach. With respect, I agree.100.    In the present case before me, the notice from Dennis Singham, which is\n\nset out in para 57 above, did set out some particulars of breach i.e the removal of the party wall\n\nbetween the units and the removal of walls to the toilets.101.    However, it was not necessary for me to decide whether the notice\n\nconstituted sufficient particulars for the following reasons.102.    First, the reference therein to Clause 2(j) of the tenancy agreement was\n\nwrong. Clause 2(j) refers to the consent of the relevant authorities, and not of the Landlord.103.    Secondly, the breach was capable of remedy but the Landlord did not\n\nrequire Honey to remedy the breach. This was contrary to s 18(1) CLPA.104.    I accepted that the notice was invalid. However it did not follow that\n\nHoney should not have surrendered the Premises.105.    First, it would not serve much purpose to challenge the validity of the\n\nnotice unless Honey intended to carry out reinstatement works for which it needed more time. After\n\nall, the Landlord could have sent a valid notice if the validity of the first notice had been\n\nchallenged.106.    Secondly, it was not disputed that Honey did not have money to do\n\nreinstatement works. Ms Chan also accepted that she was not aware of Honeys right to do\n\nreinstatement works under s 18(1) CLPA.107.    It was put to Ms Chan during her cross-examination that Mr Ng was not\n\naware that the Landlord was going to terminate the tenancy and Mr Ng did not have an opportunity to\n\ncarry out reinstatement works (NE 43 line 8 to NE 44 line 20).108.    I accepted that the subsequent notice dated 23 October 2000 from Dennis\n\nSingham was not brought to the attention of Kenneth Tan or Mr Ng until after the Premises were\n\nsurrendered, although Ms Chan had various telephone discussions with Mr Ng.109.    On this point, I did not accept Ms Chans belated evidence in\n\nre-examination that she had mentioned the written notice from Dennis Singham to Mr Ng in telephone\n\ndiscussions with Mr Ng between 24 to 27 October 2000. In cross-examination, she had already said\n\nthat she had not done so.110.    I would add that there was no suggestion that the omission was deliberate.\n\nIndeed, Ms Chan and Honey were under considerable pressure from the Landlord to respond to the\n\nLandlords threat quickly.111.    In any event, the omission did not mean that Mr Ng was completely unaware\n\nof the danger that the Landlord might terminate the tenancy. The danger had already been mentioned\n\nin the fax from M N Swami to Kenneth Tan dated 18 October 2000 (see para 47 above).112.    As for the allegation that Mr Ng did not have an opportunity to carry out\n\nreinstatement works, the truth of the matter was that Mr Ng did not intend to do reinstatement\n\nworks.113.    His intention was to carry on with what he had done. That is why he\n\nasserted during cross-examination that he still expected the Landlord to endorse his plans\n\nnotwithstanding the Unauthorised Works (NE 17 line 15 to 17, NE 23 line 22 to 24, NE 24 line 10 to\n\n17).114.    That is also why Mr Ng did nothing to redress the situation or placate the\n\nLandlord. Even if Ms Chan did not orally tell him about the inspection on 20 October 2000, he knew\n\nabout it from the fax dated 20 October 2000 from M N Swami to Kenneth Tan, pursuant to which one key\n\nwas sent via a messenger. He did not turn up for the inspection. He also avoided approaching the\n\nLandlord on the excuse that he had no contractual relationship with the Landlord. He could and\n\nshould have offered to see the Landlord with Ms Chan but he did not. Yet he had the temerity to say\n\nthat the matter could have been regularised with a bit of communication with the Landlord.115.    Furthermore, while Mr Kung criticised Honey for not relying on s 18(1)\n\nCLPA, Kenneth Tan themselves did not raise this provision at the material time. I find that they\n\nthemselves had been unaware about it or had forgotten about it then. That is why the question of\n\nreinstatement under s 18(1) CLPA was never raised in their faxes/ correspondence to M N Swami before\n\n30 October 2000. Even after 31 October 2000 when they were informed about the surrender of the\n\nPremises, they did not assert in any fax or correspondence that reinstatement works should have been\n\ndone or that Mr Ng had been denied the opportunity of doing such works. This was also not raised in\n\nMr Ngs pleadings.116.    I was of the view that s 18(1) CLPA was raised as an afterthought to\n\nextricate Mr Ng from the mess he had created.117.    Mr Kung also argued that the chain of causation had been broken by the act\n\nof surrendering the Premises.118.    I did not agree. The surrender of the Premises was an ordinary and natural\n\nconsequence of the Unauthorised Works.119.    It may be that Honey could have mitigated by doing reinstatement works but\n\nthat is a different point which was not specifically pleaded by Mr Ng.120.    Secondly, Honey had acted on the advice of its architect Mr Yeo who had\n\nestimated reinstatement costs to be $300,000 and Honey did not have this sum or even the $80,000 I\n\nhave mentioned in para 62 above. It must be remembered that Honey was in dire financial straits, and\n\nthat is why it had to obtain advance payment from Mr Ng.121.    Thirdly, Honey had acted on the advice of its solicitors in agreeing to\n\nsurrender the Premises with a forfeiture of only $10,000 of its deposit. As I have said, the\n\nintention behind the surrender was with a view to mitigating its damages.122.    Fourthly, at no time prior to 30 October 2000 did Kenneth Tan suggest that\n\nreinstatement works be done.123.    Fifthly, everything was happening very quickly, starting with the shock of\n\nlearning about the Unauthorised Works and the Landlords fury.124.    It may well be that the Landlord was taking advantage of the situation but\n\nit was a situation created by Mr Ng.125.    In all the circumstances, I did not think that Honey had acted\n\nunreasonably or had failed to mitigate (assuming this had been pleaded) by surrendering the\n\nPremises.126.    Accordingly, I was of the view that it was not Ms Chan and the Second and\n\nThird Defendants who were in breach of contract but Mr Ng. His purported rescission of the sale\n\nagreement was wrongful.127.    By his deliberate act in carrying out the Unauthorised Works, he had made\n\nit impossible for the First, Second and Third Defendants to carry out their part of the sale\n\nagreement. In my view, this entitled them not only to be excused from being unable to provide the\n\ntenancy and carry on with the sale agreement but also to claim damages from him.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
