        "Introduction": "4       The parties were married in 1978 and remained\n                    married for 32 years.[note: 1]During the marriage, the couple had two children, both girls. The first was born\n                    in 1982 and the second was born in 1996. Currently, the husband is a Senior\n                    Consultant at a local hospital, and the wife is a part-time general\n                    practitioner. Based on the Notice of Assessment issued by IRAS for the year\n                    2010, the husband earned $392,898.00 a year[note: 2]($32,741.50\n                    a month) and the Wife earned $36,412 a year[note: 3]($3,034.33 a\n                    month). 5       At the time of the marriage, both parties worked\n                    full time.[note: 4]Subsequently, and\n                    for a large part of the marriage, the husband was the breadwinner of the family.\n                    He stated that he earned about 91% of the household income over 32 years of\n                        marriage.[note: 5]Throughout the entirety of the marriage,\n                    the husband had been fully responsible for all the household expenses, the\n                    maid’s expenses, the children’s expenses and the car\n                        expenses.[note: 6]The\n                    wife took care of the home and worked intermittently[note: 7], and mostly on a part time\n                        basis.[note: 8]The wife stopped\n                    working after the birth of their second child.[note: 9] 6       The wife commenced divorce proceedings against\n                    the husband on 5 October 2009 on an uncontested basis due to the\n                    husband’s unreasonable behaviour. Interim Judgment for Divorce was granted\n                    on 7 June 2010.",
        "Disputed matrimonial assets": "7       Parties differed in their views on two specific\n                    issues relating to the composition of the matrimonial assets: (a)     whether a fixed deposit account in\n                        the joint names of the husband and his mother was part of the matrimonial\n                        assets, (b)     Whether\n                        an account in the husband’s parents’ joint names was part of the\n                        matrimonial assets. 8       Parties dealt with these issues at two hearings\n                    on 3 November 2011 and 9 November 2011.",
        "The fixed deposit account in the joint names of the husband and his\n                mother": "9       After hearing the parties, I decided on a\n                    balance of probabilities that the money in the fixed deposit account in the\n                    joint names of the husband and his mother belonged to the husband’s\n                    mother. The husband’s mother had filed an affidavit stating that the money\n                    in the joint fixed deposit account belonged to her.[note: 10]The husband’s mother had made\n                    transfers into this joint account from 2002 – 2008. I found that any\n                    assertion by the wife that alluded to the husband systematically dissipating or\n                    siphoning money via this route ran contrary to the objective facts; namely that\n                    the transfers began in 2002, long before marital problems arose.[note: 11]In my view, it was rather unlikely for\n                    the husband to have foreseen the breakdown of the marriage in 2002 and started\n                    planning the dissipation or siphoning of matrimonial assets so many years in\n                    advance in order to avoid having to account for them to the wife in the course\n                    of the division of matrimonial assets following the interim judgment in June\n                    2010. Accordingly, the money in this fixed deposit account in the joint names of\n                    the husband and his mother was not part of the matrimonial assets. 10     As a safeguard and on my directions, the\n                    husband had, on 10 November 2011, made a statutory declaration stating that\n                    all the money in this joint fixed deposit account was money that belonged\n                    entirely to his mother. I further directed that copies of this statutory\n                    declaration be sent to his brother in Australia, to counsel for the wife, and to\n                    his mother. This was to notify all possibly interested parties of the money in\n                    the joint fixed deposit account and to prevent the husband from later claiming\n                    the money as his own.",
        "Account in husband’s parents’ joint names": "11     I decided that the money in the account in the\n                    husband’s parents’ joint names was part of the matrimonial assets.\n                    This account contained $167,487.72. The husband’s case was that it was out\n                    of love and filial duty that he gave money regularly to his mother, depositing\n                    this money into a UOB account in Singapore under his parent’s joint\n                        names.[note: 12]Unlike the account in the joint names of the\n                    husband and his mother, there was no evidence of a long and continuing trend of\n                    payments. Instead, there was just one page in the affidavit which reflected the\n                    current balance in the account. 12     In the hearing before me on 9 November\n                    2011, it was the husband’s position that the money in this account was\n                    also for medical expenses. I posed the question as to whether this was ever used\n                    for medical expenses as argued. The response was that it was never used for\n                    medical expenses, but earmarked as such. I was not convinced, based on the\n                    production of a single bank account balance document, that there was a regular\n                    stream of payments to the husband’s mother as claimed. I was also not\n                    convinced that, without more, these sums were to be used for medical expenses,\n                    when it was clear that no money from the account was ever used as\n                such.",
        "Husband’s joint accounts with daughters": "13     I should also add that, by the parties’\n                    consent, money in the older daughter’s joint account with the husband with\n                    DBS was to be placed in a new account solely in the name of the older daughter.\n                    Similarly, money in the joint account of the younger daughter and the husband\n                    with POSB was to be placed in a new account solely in the name of the younger\n                    daughter. The monies in both the husband’s joint accounts with the\n                    daughters were, by consent, to be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets\n                    for division.",

        "The law": "38     Section 114 of the Women’s Charter\n                    (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) sets out the matters to be considered in the\n                    assessment of maintenance: Assessment of maintenance 114. —(1) In determining the amount of any maintenance\n                        to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, the court shall have regard\n                        to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters: (a) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial\n                            resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to\n                            have in the foreseeable future; (b) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each\n                            of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the\n                            foreseeable future; (c) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown\n                            of the marriage; (d) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the\n                            marriage; (e) any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the\n                            marriage; (f) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to\n                            the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking\n                            after the home or caring for the family; and (g) in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the\n                            value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for\n                            example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of\n                            the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring. (2) In exercising its powers under this section, the court shall endeavour\n                        so to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to\n                        their conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would\n                        have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly\n                        discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the\n                        other. 39     Having regard to Section 114, I decided on the\n                    sum of $4,000 per month for the wife’s maintenance with the following\n                    considerations in mind.",
        "Factors in the division of matrimonial assets": "17     Having gone through the evidence presented\n                    before me, I decided on the 55:45 division of matrimonial assets for the\n                    following reasons. The marriage lasted 32 years 18     This was a long marriage. I have no doubt that\n                    both parties gave each other the best years of their lives. As set out inYow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan[2000]\n                    2 SLR(R) 659 at [43], parties\n                    to the marriage “often have unequal abilities whether as parents or\n                    income earners but, as between them, this disparity of roles and talents should\n                    not result in unequal rewardswhere the contributions are\n                        made consistently and over a long period of time”\n                    [emphasis added]. On the evidence, both parties, despite their unequal\n                    abilities, did contribute consistently to the household in monetary and\n                    non-monetary terms over a long period of time. I now go on to illustrate these\n                    contributions. Both parties made substantial contributions in the differing spheres\n                of family life 19     The wife was, at times, working, but it was\n                    evident she assumed the homemaking role. The husband was the breadwinner of the\n                    family. However, in saying this, I noted that the wife had made a substantial\n                    contribution towards the payment of the first matrimonial home. I will address\n                    the wife’s contribution to the properties acquired later in my\n                    judgment. Husband’s career 20     The husband earned a comfortable salary.\n                    However, to get to his present position, the husband had to put in the hours at\n                    his workplace. For one, he was pursuing his post-graduate degree in Obstetrics\n                    and Gynaecology at the time the first child was born. In addition, the wife\n                    stated that the husband worked night shifts 3-4 times a week at the\n                        hospital.[note: 13]The job involved having to work through\n                    “sleepless nights” and on weekends at times.[note: 14]He had to work\n                    irregular hours and be on call.[note: 15]It was stated by the wife, and not\n                    denied by the husband, that the wife would bring the older daughter (when she\n                    was young) to the hospital to join the husband for dinner.[note: 16]The husband\n                    wished to concentrate on his career and build up his practice. By the\n                    husband’s own account, he had to continually travel to conferences for\n                    professional development. I also noted that the wife had the second child when\n                    she was 42 years old. She stated that it was a difficult pregnancy[note: 17], and she stopped working\n                    to take care of the second child. 21     Taking all these factors into account, I did\n                    not accept the husband’s contention that he did not needanyhelp from the wife and could pursue his career and\n                    take care of the children and the family at the same time. He stated that he had\n                    this ability due to his training as a gynaecologist which allowed him to make\n                    sound judgments and decisions despite working odd hours and despite little\n                        sleep.[note: 18]However, I also found in his affidavit the following: “The quality of\n                    life that my family now enjoys largely came from myhard\n                        work, perseverance and dedication tocareer\n                        building.[note: 19]As I am working in a public hospital,the needs of the community and country camefirst”[note: 20]. While he put in the required time and\n                    effort in his job, for which his public spiritedness should be applauded, his\n                    wife was at home taking care of the household. On the facts of this case (see[22]-[28]), it was clear that the husband’s claim of not\n                    needinganyhelp from the wife was unsustainable.\n                    I would add here that the wife also referred clients to the husband.[note: 21]This helped him to build\n                    up his patient base. Therefore, in addition to providing support to the husband\n                    by taking care of the home (which aided him in carrying on his occupation or\n                    business), the wife also provided assistance to generate more business for the\n                    husband. 22     I now highlight a few examples which would\n                    illustrate how the husband needed the help of the wife in taking care of the\n                    household. Wife’s post-delivery actions 23     The wife went back to work four and a half\n                    months after the birth of the couple’s first child.[note: 22]This was despite the\n                    wife’s intention to resign from her job and work part time after the\n                    delivery of the first child[note: 23], in line with her description of herself\n                    as being the “mother type”[note: 24]. The wife stated that she had to work\n                    full time, breastfeed the baby, cook and clean the house. The feeding of the\n                    infant took place at odd hours and that meant the wife could only sleep 2 or 3\n                    hours every night, which left her exhausted in the day. This went on for one\n                        year.[note: 25] 24     The husband stated that this was due to him\n                    being mindful that maternity leave was for 8 weeks at the time and that both\n                    parties needed their jobs to support the repayment of the loan towards their\n                    first matrimonial home. In addition, he “discouraged the Plaintiff from\n                    resigning because Credit POSB gave preferential interest rates to staff in the\n                    Ministry of Health.”[note: 26]I was of the view that the\n                    wife’s return to work after delivery for the sake of paying off the loandespiteher own inclinations to stay at home\n                    should be taken into account when I divided the matrimonial assets. To apply an\n                    observation by the Court of Appeal inYeo Chong\n                        Linto the present case, the family here was relatively less well\n                    off in the early years of the marriage, and the wife’s role would have\n                    been harder then. This was evident during the early years of this marriage,\n                    where the wife had to juggle both work and household responsibilities including\n                    that of looking after the children. The family’s time in Australia: 1984-1985, 2006-2007 25     In 1984, the family moved to Australia and\n                    lived there for a year. The wife stated that the family only had help with the\n                    chores twice a week for the last few months of their stay.[note: 27]Besides cooking, the wife\n                    also took the older daughter to playschool, and taught her how to read. The wife\n                    did not work during the year.[note: 28] 26     In 2005, the husband sat for the Australian\n                    specialist medical examination so that he could obtain employment that was\n                    linked to the grant of Permanent Residency in Australia.[note: 29]The job required the\n                    husband to work for two years in what he termed “a small country town of\n                    60,000 people”[note: 30].\n                    Thus he spent 2006 and 2007 in Hervey Bay, Queensland[note: 31]. In his Defence for the\n                    divorce filed on 27 October 2009, the husband stated that he thought that\n                    separation would avoid further friction that could easily arise in a brand new\n                    environment, as the marital relationship was becoming unsettled then[note: 32](this was denied\n                    by the wife)[note: 33]. Subsequently, he stated in his affidavit\n                    that he thought it was better for the family to live in Adelaide for safety\n                        reasons.[note: 34]The wife asserted that the husband’s\n                    reasons were less altruistic; he simply could not concentrate on a new job in a\n                    new place and cope with family responsibilities at the same time.[note: 35]Even if the husband’s\n                    reason was true, the arrangement would have left the wife to take care of the\n                    household. Indeed, the wife took care of the household during her year in\n                    Adelaide without the aid of domestic help.[note: 36] The wife’s role in contributing to the properties acquired\n                during marriage 27     A lot of ink was spilt in the husband’s\n                    affidavit on how the wife looked at the marriage as a business[note: 37]and how she was obsessed\n                    with money. On the wife’s end, she stated that the husband was a poor\n                    steward of money[note: 38],\n                    had poor judgment when it came to investments[note: 39], and had denied her money to invest in\n                        properties[note: 40].\n                    She stated that the couple had different perspectives when it came to\n                    investments. She suggested investments to him and pushed him to invest in said\n                    investments. To my mind, these views were not irreconcilable. The wife was right\n                    in saying that the couple had different views towards investments. The wife\n                    thought property investments were the best way to grow their money. The husband\n                    was constantly prodded to provide money towards this goal.[note: 41]In return, he felt that\n                    the wife was obsessed with having money to invest in properties. The\n                    wife’s attempts to grow the matrimonial assets were noted. If not for the\n                    wife’s astute choice of investment in properties, the total value of\n                    matrimonial assets available for distribution might not be as much as what it is\n                    now. Her contribution in this regard must also be factored into the division of\n                    assets. In addition, she did contribute funds to the purchase of property. InLock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye[2007]\n                    3 SLR(R) 520, it was held (at [41]): Furthermore, in addition to the non-financial contributions of a spouse\n                        (more often than not, the wife), attention must be given to his or her\n                        direct financial contributions through his or her efforts in increasing the\n                        total value of the matrimonial assets. This contribution must be taken into\n                        account for the purpose of increasing the proportion of matrimonial assets\n                        to be awarded to that spouse. This is not only logical but is also eminently\n                        fair. 28     The wife contributed to the purchases of the\n                    current matrimonial home and previous matrimonial property using CPF as well as\n                    proceeds from the sale of previous matrimonial homes. The proceeds of the sale\n                    of the first matrimonial home (which, as stated in[19], also involved payments by the wife[note: 42]) subsequently went towards\n                    the purchase of the second matrimonial home. The purchase of the fourth and\n                    current matrimonial home stemmed from financing arising out of the sale of the\n                    third matrimonial home.[note: 43]It\n                    was also not disputed that the wife contributed $153,700 from her CPF account to\n                    the purchase of the current matrimonial home. Accordingly, it was clear to me\n                    that the wife did contribute money towards acquiring the matrimonial\n                    assets.",
        "Further comments": "29     It is regrettable that the advice provided by\n                    the Court of Appeal in the case ofNK v NL[2007]\n                    3 SLR(R) 743 (“NK v NL”)\n                    was not heeded and the affidavits alluded to a number of allegations relating to\n                    extramarital relationships. To reiterate, the court inNK v\n                        NLheld (at [12]) that in\n                    the light of the current “no fault” basis of divorce law, it would\n                    serve no purpose to dwell on the question of “who did what”, and\n                    that the adulterous behaviour of parties was irrelevant in the determination of\n                    the ancillaries. 30     The Court of Appeal there then went on to\n                    state the primary objective of the law: to facilitate the transitional period of\n                    emotional upheaval for all parties concerned, not least the children. This\n                    salutary objective was lost in the midst of all the crossfire that ensued in the\n                    affidavits; in this unfortunate case, it seemed that the elder daughter was now\n                    being treated for depression. The husband indicated that this was due to the\n                    breakup of a relationship the child was in.[note: 44]The wife stated that the depression was\n                    partly due to the dysfunctional family environment.[note: 45]While causation is\n                    difficult to set out in such matters of the heart, the proximity between the\n                    timing of the commencement of treatment for depression and the timing of the\n                    commencement of divorce proceedings is telling.",
        "The Division": "31     As set out inNK v\n                        NL, the court’s mandate was to come to a just and equitable\n                    division of the matrimonial assets having regard to all the circumstances of the\n                    case. 32     With that in mind, and having considered the\n                    factors I listed out above, I adopted a broad brush approach and awarded the\n                    husband 55% of the matrimonial assets and the wife 45% of the matrimonial\n                    assets. 33     In addition, I took the step of evaluating the\n                    two proposals that the husband had put forward in his written\n                        submissions[note: 46]: (a)     He wanted either 75% of all the\n                        matrimonial assets, or (b)     He was willing to let the wife keep the matrimonial\n                        property at [address redacted] (“the Matrimonial Property”)\n                        with him keeping the remaining properties. These remaining properties were a\n                        shophouse in Clementi with a value of S$800,000[note: 47]. The valuations of\n                        the Australian properties were disputed, but I proceeded on the\n                        husband’s valuation, as I wanted to make the point that even if I had\n                        accepted the husband’s proposal, the ultimate result would not be any\n                        different from the result I arrived at independent of the proposal. In this\n                        particular proposal, he also wanted each party to keep assets held in their\n                        own names. 34     I considered but did not think that the first\n                    proposal was reasonable. The division of 75:25 was disproportionate in light of\n                    the contributions the wife had made to, among other things, the welfare of the\n                    family. I then considered the second proposal and I drew up the following table\n                    to facilitate understanding: WifeHusbandThe Matrimonial Property (Husband’s\n                                            appraisal: $3.25 mil (June 2010), Wife’s\n                                            appraisal: $2.5 mil (April 2010))Average taken:S$2.875\n                                                milClementi ShophouseS$800,000(e)Queensland Property (based on\n                                            husband’s own assessment:\n                                        AUD$300,000)S$389,355.00Perth Property (based on husband’s\n                                            own assessment: AUD$400,000)S$519,140.00Own AssetsS$1,190,199.47Own Assets (this sum includes the money in\n                                            UOB bank account in the husband’s parents’\n                                            joint names, see[11]S$3,387,750.65Total:$4,065,199.47Total:$5,096,245.65Division44.37%55.63%   35     The wife’s assets (excluding real\n                    property) added up to $1,190,199.47. I found the husband’s assets\n                    (excluding real property) to be valued at $$3,387,750.65. I did not include the\n                    monies in the joint bank accounts that I had earlier found were not part of the\n                    pool of matrimonial assets. These were the monies in (a) the husband’s\n                    joint accounts with the elder daughter; (b) the husband’s joint account\n                    with the younger daughter; and (c) and the husband’s joint fixed deposit\n                    account with his mother. I included the money in the bank account in the\n                    husband’s parents’ joint names as though they were a part of the\n                    matrimonial assets. In his second proposal, the husband was essentially stating\n                    that he should get 55.63% and the wife 44.37% of the matrimonial assets. It is\n                    evident that these numbers did not materially differ from the percentages I\n                    independently arrived at, having considered the s 112 factors in\n                    totality. 36     I now turn to the issue of\n                maintenance.",
        "Monthly maintenance for the wife": "37     At the end of the hearing, I awarded a sum of\n                    S$4,000 per month as maintenance for the wife.",
        "Considerations in assessing wife’s maintenance": "40     First, the wife stated in her affidavit that\n                    her total monthly expenses during the marriage added up to $10,287.00. This\n                    monthly sum comprised the following: (a)     wife’s monthly personal\n                        expenses ($2786.17); (b)     monthly household expenses ($2756.10); (c)     car expenses ($1,800); (d)     domestic worker expenses ($682.90);\n                        and (e)     monthly\n                        expenses for the child ($2261.83)[note: 48] 41     I subtracted the monthly expenses for the\n                    child from the sum of the total expenses, as there would be a separate order for\n                    maintenance for the child. I also discounted a reasonable sum from the monthly\n                    household and domestic worker expenses that would represent the household\n                    expenses and maid expenses that should be allocated to the child to form part of\n                    the maintenance for the child. After such adjustments, the ordinary expenses for\n                    herself alone would probably be in the region of $6,500 per month. 42     Second, in assessing the maintenance sum, I\n                    had in mind the fact that the marriage lasted for 32 years. This was a long\n                    marriage where the wife consciously contributed to home life and to the welfare\n                    of the family. Despite the husband’s contentions, I find it difficult to\n                    believe that the career path towards being a senior consultant in a hospital\n                    would not detractat allfrom family\n                life. 43     Third, in coming to the sum of $4,000 as the\n                    maintenance sum, I had regard to the standard of living enjoyed by the family\n                    before the breakdown of the marriage. This was a family that enjoyed a\n                    comfortable quality of life. Moreover, this was a sum the husband could readily\n                    afford. 44     Fourth, I also had regard to the income and\n                    earning capacity which the wife was likely to have in the foreseeable future. In\n                    deciding the maintenance sum, I was cognizant of the fact that if the wife\n                    resumed work now on a part time basis as a locum, she could readily earn at\n                    least $2,500 per month. 45     Fifth, I noted the wife’s argument that\n                    the husband’s expenses far exceeded hers in some areas. While that in and\n                    of itself did not reflect the wife’s expenses, it did reflect the standard\n                    of living that the household was used to and the standard of living that was\n                    enjoyed by the family. To provide further context, and as the wife points out,\n                    both parties are doctors, with the husband being a specialist in obstetrics and\n                    gynaecology. Parties also live in landed property. The standard of living cannot\n                    be said to be any less than one of comfort. 46     Sixth, the wife has several medical\n                        concerns.[note: 49]Among others, she might require hormone replacement therapy. This is due to her\n                    irregular and prolonged menses from perimenopausal bleeding.[note: 50]I took these\n                    medical conditions into account in assessing the financial needs the wife had or\n                    was likely to have in the foreseeable future. As the $4,000 monthly maintenance\n                    together with her potential monthly earning of $2,500 per month as a part time\n                    locum was at a level that would meet her ordinary monthly expenses of $6,500 per\n                    month, this would mean that she would not need to utilise or draw down on the\n                    approximate $4,000,000 dollars that would be her 45% share of the matrimonial\n                    assets. Should there be any extraordinary medical expenses that she might have\n                    to incur in the future, I think these could be readily taken care of from her\n                    share of the matrimonial assets. There was no need to increase the $4,000\n                    monthly maintenance to provide for these extraordinary expenses.",
        "Monthly maintenance for the child": "47     The wife initially sought $5,217.10 as monthly\n                    maintenance for the child. She calculated that the child’s personal\n                    monthly expenses alone came up to $2,261.83. The husband initially proposed $687\n                    as an initial working budget, which he stated he was happy to adjust for the\n                    child’s sake from time to time.[note: 51]However, I noted that this sum did not\n                    include a significant number of expenses related to outings, clothing, shoes,\n                    holidays and school materials, which were factored in the wife’s\n                    calculations. The husband stated that he did not include these expenses as he\n                    would pay these sums directly to the child.[note: 52]In the same affidavit, the husband\n                    stated that he was willing to pay $2,650 a month for the child’s\n                    maintenance (this was an “all in” sum including personal expenses,\n                    household expenses and maid expenses)[note: 53]. 48     When parties came before me again in November\n                    2011, counsel for the husband said that his client was prepared to pay and was\n                    willing to do all that could be done for the family. I asked for an updated and\n                    itemised breakdown of the child’s expenses, and having received further\n                    submissions on 1 November 2011, I varied the maintenance order for the\n                    child to $2,500 a month, with the additional stipulation that the husband was to\n                    pay separately for the child’s tuition classes, piano lessons, and\n                    chiropractic sessions.
