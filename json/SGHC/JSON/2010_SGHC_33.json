        "Introduction": "1       The present assessment of damages arises out of\n                    two leases signed between the plaintiff, Mr Gerd Walter Thode, and the\n                    first defendant, Mintwell Industry Pte Ltd (“Mintwell”), for two\n                    units in Mintwell Building, an industrial building located at No 55 Ubi\n                    Avenue 3, Singapore 408864 (“Mintwell Building”). Although the\n                    hearing of the assessment of damages took only half a day before me, the parties\n                    subsequently raised a myriad of legal issues in their written and oral\n                    submissions. As will be demonstrated, most of these seemingly complicated issues\n                    can in fact be resolved having regard to first principles.",
        "The facts": "2       The facts of this case are undisputed and\n                    reference can be made to the judgment of the trial judge, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J,\n                    inThode Gerd Walter v Mintwell Industry Pte Ltd[2009] SGHC 44 (“Thode Gerd\n                    Walter”) (at [1]–[13]). For purposes of the present\n                    proceedings, the facts can be briefly summarised as follows. 3       The plaintiff is the sole-proprietor of Euromal\n                    Precision Engineering (“Euromal”) and is in the business of\n                    mechanical engineering works. At the material time, Mintwell was the lessor of\n                    Mintwell Building and had granted leases of various units in Mintwell Building\n                    to others, including the plaintiff. The second defendant is Mr Seah Bak\n                    Kheow (“Seah”), who was alleged by the plaintiff, and found by\n                    Belinda Ang J inThode Gerd Walter(at [46]), to\n                    be the key controlling mind behind Mintwell at the material time,\n                    notwithstanding that he was not a director of Mintwell. The third defendant is\n                    Mr Tan Kee Hock, Eddy (“Eddy”), a director of Mintwell at the\n                    material time. 4       Mintwell had granted the following two leases to\n                    the plaintiff: (a)     a lease dated 16 February 2005\n                        for unit #01-02 at a monthly rent of $15,643.60, which commenced on\n                        1 May 2005 and was for a period of two years up till 30 April 2007\n                        with an option to renew for a further two years; and (b)     a lease dated 1 August 2006 for\n                        unit #03-02 at a monthly rent of $5,940.00, which commenced on 1 August\n                        2006 and was for a period of 33 months up till 30 April 2007 with an\n                        option to renew for a further two years. The plaintiff\n                    had taken up the second lease for unit #03-02 as he needed more space to expand\n                    his growing business, and the term of the second lease was 33 months so as to\n                    ensure that the expiry dates of both leases would coincide. 5       Previously, Mintwell had mortgaged Mintwell\n                    Building to Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC”) and\n                    covenanted,inter alia, not to let any part of the\n                    property without the consent in writing of the bank. Unknown to the plaintiff,\n                    OCBC had obtained an order of court dated 2 September 2002 against Mintwell\n                    for vacant possession of Mintwell Building (in Originating Summons No 1106\n                    of 2002 (“OS 1106/2002”)) after Mintwell defaulted in mortgage\n                    repayments and had subsequently filed a writ of possession on 30 June 2006\n                    to enforce the order. In breach of its covenant, Mintwell had also leased the\n                    two units to the plaintiff without the consent of OCBC. 6       It was only on 2 August 2006 when the\n                    plaintiff was served with a copy of Summons No 3453 of 2006 (“SUM\n                    3453/2006”), an application by OCBC for the execution of the writ of\n                    possession, that the plaintiff first found out about the true situation. In\n                    order to avoid eviction, the plaintiff contested the summons at the hearing on\n                    1 September 2006, but was unsuccessful. The Assistant Registrar ordered\n                    that OCBC be at liberty to enforce the order of court dated 2 September\n                    2002 and to execute the writ of possession, albeit a stay of execution was\n                    granted until 1 December 2006, 4 pm. 7       The plaintiff eventually found alternative\n                    premises for his business at 45 Changi South Avenue 2, #03-01, Techplas\n                    Industrial Building, Singapore 486133 (“Changi South premises”)\n                    and entered into a lease for this new premises on or about 22 November 2006\n                    at a monthly rent of $23,000. Prior to the Changi South premises, the plaintiff\n                    had considered another premises at 9 Tai Seng Drive (“Tai Seng\n                    premises”) but found the place unsuitable. The plaintiff vacated unit\n                    #03-02 at Mintwell Building on or about 4 October 2006 and vacated unit\n                    #01-02 on or about 28 November 2006. Although the plaintiff had incurred\n                    expenses renovating unit #03-02, he never commenced operations\n                there. 8       On 8 June 2007, the plaintiff commenced the\n                    present action against the three defendants. He sued Mintwell for breach of\n                    contract (in respect of Mintwell’s breaches for the two leases),\n                    negligence and fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation and Seah and Eddy\n                    for fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation. On 25 August 2008, the\n                    parties entered into a consent judgment whereby interlocutory judgment was\n                    entered for the plaintiff against Mintwell for breach of contract with damages\n                    to be assessed by the Registrar. On 23 February 2009, Belinda Ang J,\n                    after the trial of the action, entered interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff\n                    against Mintwell and Seah for negligent misrepresentation with damages to be\n                    assessed by the Registrar. She, however, did not find Eddy liable. As such, the\n                    present proceedings are only against Mintwell and Seah (reference hereafter to\n                    “the defendants” in this judgment will refer only to Mintwell and\n                    Seah).",
        "The present assessment of damages and the heads of damages claimed by\n                the plaintiff": "9       The present assessment of damages was a\n                    consolidated hearing (pursuant to an order of court dated 25 August 2009)\n                    for the assessment of damages due to the plaintiff under both judgments. The\n                    plaintiff claimed in total a sum of $251,902.53, which can be broadly divided\n                    into four categories: (a)     $191,195.38 for expenses incurred in\n                        relation to the move to the Changi South premises, which formed the bulk of\n                        the claim; (b)     $15,964 for expenses incurred for unit #03-02, in which operations never\n                        commenced there; (c)     $27,551.95 for labour costs (for the plaintiff’s staff and for the\n                        plaintiff himself) incurred in relation to the move to the Changi South\n                        premises; and (d)     $17,191.20 for legal costs incurred for contesting the eviction and title\n                        searches/conveyancing fees for the Tai Seng premises and the Changi South\n                        premises. 10     At the hearing of the assessment of damages,\n                    the defendants elected not to call their witness,ie, Eddy, to give evidence at the end of the plaintiff’s\n                    case. Eddy’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) was\n                    thus not admitted.",
        "Preliminary issue – the measure of damages": "11     Before I proceed with my decision on the\n                    damages to be awarded, it will be necessary to deal with a preliminary issue\n                    first. 12     At the start of the hearing of the assessment\n                    of damages on 9 October 2009, counsel for the plaintiff, Ms Sugidha\n                    Nithi (“Ms Nithi”), represented to me that parties have\n                    agreed that the assessment of the damages due under both judgments would result\n                    in the same figure, and no issue was raised by either party as to what was the\n                    proper measure of damages. Ms Nithi explained that this was also the reason\n                    why consolidation was sought in the first place and granted. However, at the\n                    oral submissions on 20 November 2009, counsel for the defendants,\n                    Ms Sarah Tan (“Ms Tan”), raised for the first time the\n                    issue that the plaintiff should elect his measure of damages and decide whether\n                    to proceed with damages in contract or tort. Although the defendants had alluded\n                    briefly to the different measures of damages in contract and tort in their\n                    written submissions[note: 1], they had\n                    not explained the significance of such difference or what the consequences of\n                    non-election of the measure of damages were in this case. Indeed, the bulk of\n                    the defendants’ written submissions were focused on the legal issues of\n                    proof of damage, mitigation and remoteness. 13     At the oral submissions, Ms Tan explained\n                    that if the plaintiff chooses to proceed in tort, he would only be entitled to\n                    recover damages in respect of the expenses he incurred for thetwounits in Mintwell Building (it should be noted,\n                    however, that the plaintiff is only claiming for expenses incurred foroneunit,ie, unit #03-02,\n                    as part of the total damages claimed (see[9]above)) and nothing more because the aim of damages in tort was to restore him\n                    to the position he would have been in if the tort (ie, the misrepresentation in this case) had not been committed.\n                    And if the tort had not occurred in the first place, she reasoned that the\n                    plaintiff would not have taken up the two leases at Mintwell Building and would\n                    have simply taken up another place. Consequently, he would not have had to move\n                    to the Changi South premises and incur all the other expenses claimed. His loss\n                    would therefore only be confined to the wasted expenditure for the two units in\n                    Mintwell Building. However, if the plaintiff chooses to proceed in contract, the\n                    plaintiff would be entitled in principle to claim for the expenses he expended\n                    for moving to the Changi South premises as well as the rest of the damages\n                    claimed here. She did not, however, submit that the plaintiff should choose the\n                    measure of damages in tort or that that was the correct measure for the present\n                    case. Rather, her position was simply that the plaintiff should make an\n                    election. 14     On the other hand, Ms Nithi reiterated\n                    the position at the start of the hearing of the assessment of damages. She\n                    contended that no election was necessary and that, in any event, the same amount\n                    of damages would be ascertained under either measure. 15     It does not appear to me that the defendants\n                    are pressing the point strongly that an election should be made or that the\n                    measure of damages in tort is the right measure. In any case, I do not agree\n                    with the defendants’ view that if the measure of damages is to be based in\n                    tort, then it follows that the plaintiff can only recover the expenses incurred\n                    for the two units at Mintwell Building and nothing more. This argument appears\n                    to be based on a misunderstanding of the principle that the aim of damages in\n                    tort is to put the claimant in a position he would have been in if the tort had\n                    not been committed. There is no doubt that this is the guiding principle of the\n                    object of damages in tort, which isdifferentfrom\n                    that in contract, which aims to put the claimant in as good a position, as far\n                    as money can do it, as if the promise had been performed (see the Court of\n                    Appeal decision ofWishing Star Ltd v Jurong Town\n                        Corp[2008] 2 SLR 909 (“Wishing Star”) at [28]). 16     However, there is no reason to draw an\n                    artificial and arbitrary line to limit damages to only expenses incurred for the\n                    two units if the measure of damages is based in tort in the present case. Could\n                    it not be said similarly that had the tort not been committed (ie, if there had been no misrepresentation), the\n                    plaintiff would not have gone on to incur and would have avoided all other\n                    expenses he had incurred such as those in relation to the move to the Changi\n                    South premises? Indeed, as a matter of general principle, a claimant in tort is\n                    entitled to recover not only the basic pecuniary losses he suffered as a result\n                    of the tort, but also theconsequentialpecuniary\n                    losses which will include other expenses necessitated by the tort (see generally\n                    Harvey McGregor QC,McGregor on Damages(Sweet\n                    & Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2009) at paras 2-043 to 2-045 and paras 2-051\n                    to 2-053; see alsoGrosvenor Hotel Company v\n                        Hamilton[1984] 2 QB 836 where a tenant recovered in an action\n                    for nuisance the expenses of setting up a new place from the landlord). Apart\n                    from proof of damage, the limit to the recovery of such losses would be the\n                    remoteness of damage, and in this respect, I note that the test of remoteness of\n                    damage in tort is generally considered to be wider than that in contract (seeKoufos v C Czarnikow Ltd[1969]\n                    1 AC 350 (“The Heron II”)\n                    at 385–386,Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen\n                        Consultants Pte Ltd[2008] 2 SLR 623 (“Robertson Quay”) at [71]–[74] andSunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming\n                        Eric[2007] 1 SLR 853 (“Sunny\n                        Metal (HC)”) at [138]). Bearing this in mind and the fact\n                    that both judgments in this case arose out of the same factual matrix, it would\n                    appear odd that the defendants are taking the position that all the other\n                    expenses claimed by the plaintiff are in principle claimable and recoverable if\n                    the measure of damages is based in contract, but not so if the measure of\n                    damages is based in tort. 17     In my view, the correct position is simply\n                    this. There are two judgments here – one against Mintwell for breach of\n                    contract and the other against both Mintwell and Seah for misrepresentation in\n                    tort. As a matter of principle, the plaintiff is entitled to damages based on\n                    the measure of damages in contract for the judgment in contract as well as\n                    damages based on the measure of damages in tort for the judgment in tort. Under\n                    both judgments, damages are recoverable so long as they are not too remote.\n                    However, at the end of the day, there should be nodouble\n                        recovery. Thus, if there is any overlap in losses under both\n                    judgments, the court should only grant one set of damages for the same loss. It\n                    should also be appreciated that the present case is not exactly one where there\n                    are concurrent duties in tort and contract (see for exampleSunny Metal (HC)) and more will be said about this later (see[74]below). 18     On the facts of the present case and bearing\n                    in mind that the claims put forward by the plaintiff relate mainly to theexpenseshe had incurred as a result of the\n                    breach of contract and/or misrepresentation, I agree with the plaintiff that the\n                    damages which he is entitled to in contract would actually be the same as those\n                    he is entitled to in tort. This is not unusual, but it should be noted that this\n                    is only by way of factual coincidence (Wishing\n                        Starat [43]): … there could be a coincidence in quantum between the contractual\n                        and the tortuous measures of damages, depending on the precise facts of the\n                        case concerned, although… , this would be more by way of afactualcoincidence and doesnotsignify any coincidence in thepurposesthat the law of contract and the law of tort,\n                        respectively, serve… [emphasis in original] In arriving at this conclusion, I took into account the important fact\n                    that the present case is not one where the plaintiff is trying to recover loss\n                    of profits that he would have made in his business if the representations made\n                    by the defendants had been true. Recovery of such loss of profits would not have\n                    been permissible in tort, though they may be recoverable in contract, given that\n                    the objective of damages in tort, unlike contract, is not to compensate the\n                    claimant for the loss of bargain but to restore him tostatus\n                        quo ante(seeWishing Starat [28]\n                    andMcGregor on Damagesat para\n                19-003). 19     Lastly, I am also of the view that, in any\n                    case, it is not open to the defendants now to contend that the damages would be\n                    different under the judgment in contract and the judgment in tort, having not\n                    objected to the consolidation of the assessment of damages when the plaintiff\n                    first applied for one and subsequently not raising any objections at the start\n                    of the assessment of damages or at any time throughout the proceedings until the\n                    day of oral submissions. Indeed, the entire assessment had proceeded on the\n                    basis that the damages were the same until the issue was raised (half-heartedly\n                    it seems) at the oral submissions. I turn now to my decision on the award of\n                    damages for the various heads of damages claimed by the plaintiff.",
        "My decision": "",
        "Expenses incurred in relation to the move to the Changi South\n                premises": "20     The damages claimed by the plaintiff under the\n                    first head consisted of,inter alia, the various\n                    costs of renovation, electrical, shifting and air-conditioning works undertaken\n                    by the following contractors engaged by the plaintiff for the Changi South\n                    premises: (a)     Qian Cheng Electrical Renovation\n                        Engineering (“Qian Cheng”) for electrical works and\n                        lighting; (b)     KL\n                        Fong General Contractor for partitioning and carpeting\n                    works; (c)     ACIS\n                        Air-Conditioning Centre (“ACIS”) for air-conditioning\n                        works; (d)     Boge\n                        Kompressoren Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (“Boge”) for piping and\n                        other fittings required for the operation of the plaintiff’s\n                        machinery; (e)     Sterling Agencies Pte Ltd (“Sterling”) for the shifting of\n                        the plaintiff’s machinery from Mintwell Building to the Changi South\n                        premises; (f)     Hock\n                        Siang Transport for the shifting of the office furniture and equipment from\n                        Mintwell Building to the Changi South premises; (g)     EKTH Marketing & Services for voice and data\n                        cabling and dismantling and re-installing the PBX system;\n                    and (h)     GY Chow\n                        Consulting Engineers for load consultation for the layout of the machinery\n                        at the Changi South premises. 21     The defendants have essentially two main\n                    objections to these various claims. First, and this appears to be the\n                    defendants’ main contention, the defendants contended that the plaintiff\n                    had failed to mitigate his losses for two reasons. The first reason is that the\n                    plaintiff had chosen to lease the Changi South premises (22,008 square feet in\n                    floor area), which is 23.8%largerin floor area\n                    compared to the combined floor area of units #01-02 and #03-02 at Mintwell\n                    Building (17,774 square feet in floor area in total). The defendants argued that\n                    the increase in space would necessarily mean that “the amount the\n                    [p]laintiff expended to renovate/fit out the Changi South premises [would be]\n                        higher”[note: 2]. They submitted that the court\n                    should take this increase in floor area into account as a factor in awarding\n                    damages and “not have [the defendants] pay for the [p]laintiff’s\n                    own expansion plans and ambitions”[note: 3]. Further, they pointed out that if the\n                    plaintiff had leased the same floor area as Mintwell Building at the Changi\n                    South premises, the monthly rent (at the same rent per square feet) would only\n                    be $18,662.70 instead of the present sum of $23,000, which would work out to a\n                    savings of $4,337.30 per month and a total savings of $125,781.70 over 29 months\n                    from 1 December 2006 to 30 April2009(it should be noted that the defendants had mistakenly taken the expiry date of\n                    the two leases as 30 April2009where the\n                    correct date should be 30 April2007(see[4]above); thus instead of 29 months, it\n                    should only be 5 months and the alleged savings should only be\n                        $21,686.50)[note: 4]. The second reason is\n                    that in respect of all the renovation, electrical, shifting and air-conditioning\n                    works done at the Changi South premises, the plaintiff had failed to source for\n                    quotations from other contractors and to bargain for a more favourable price.\n                    Instead, the plaintiff had accepted the quotations he obtained from the first\n                    contractors he approached. 22     Secondly, the defendants contended that the\n                    plaintiff had failed to prove all the expenses that he had allegedly incurred in\n                    relation to the Changi South premises. The defendants took the position that it\n                    was insufficient for the plaintiff to produce the quotations and invoices for\n                    the various works done. The complaint was that the plaintiff did not call the\n                    different contractors to give evidence in court so as to justify and explain why\n                    certain works were necessary and why certain amounts were charged. 23     As a matter of principle and logic, the issue\n                    of proof should be dealt with first followed by the issue of mitigation (seeRobertson Quay([16]supra) at[27]). However, in light of the arguments canvassed by the\n                    defendants and their emphasis on the issue of mitigation, it would be more\n                    convenient for me to deal with the latter issue first. Mitigation 24     It is trite law that a claimant must take\n                    reasonable steps to mitigate the loss arising from the defendant’s wrong,\n                    be it a tort or breach of contract, and the claimant will not be entitled to\n                    recover damages in respect of any part of the loss which is due to his neglect\n                    to take such steps (see the speech of Viscount Haldane LC in the leading case ofBritish Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company,\n                        Limited v Underground Electric Railways Company of London,\n                        Limited[1912] 1 AC 673 at 689, which was followed\n                    locally inGIB Automation Pte Ltd v Deluge Fire Protection\n                        (SEA) Pte Ltd[2007] 2 SLR 918 (“GIB Automation”) at [98]; see alsoMcGregor on Damages([16]supra) at para 7-014). The onus is on the\n                    defendant to show that the claimant has failed to take such steps (GIB Automationat [98] andMcGregor\n                        on Damagesat para 7-019). 25     However, the standard of reasonableness is not\n                    high in view of the fact that the defendant is an admitted wrongdoer. As stated\n                    by Lord Macmillan inBanco de Portugal v Waterlow and Sons,\n                        Limited[1932] 1 AC 452 at 506: It is often easy after an emergency has passed to\n                            criticize the steps which have been taken to meet it, but such criticism\n                            does not come well from those who have themselves created the\n                            emergency. The law is satisfied if the partyplaced in a difficult situationby reason of the\n                        breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of\n                        remedial measures, and he will not be held disentitled to recover the cost\n                        of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other\n                        measures less burdensome to him might have been taken. [emphasis\n                        added] 26     It is oft said that the question of mitigation\n                    is a question of fact (seePayzu, Limited v\n                        Saunders[1919] 2 KB 581 at 588 and 589; see alsoRobertson Quayat[27]). Indeed, as would be implicit in Lord Macmillan’s\n                    quoted passage above, what is reasonable must be judged in thecircumstancesthat the claimant is placed\n                in. 27     Returning to the facts of the present case,\n                    can it be said that the plaintiff has failed to take such reasonable steps given\n                    that he had chosen a bigger premises and/or failed to source for alternative\n                    quotations for the various works done at the Changi South premises? I do not\n                    think so. The circumstances were such that the plaintiff only first found out of\n                    the various breaches by the defendants in August 2006. After SUM 3453/2006 for\n                    the execution of the writ of possession was heard on 1 September 2006, it\n                    then became a certainty that the plaintiff had to move out of Mintwell Building\n                    and that he had only up to 1 December 2006,ie,\n                    three months, to find alternative premises and to shift there. 28     The plaintiff first found and considered the\n                    Tai Seng premises but found it unsuitable for various reasons before he\n                    eventually found the Changi South premises sometime around end September 2006\n                    and settled for it. He testified that he was running against time then as he had\n                    to find new premises quickly and thereafter carry out the necessary renovation\n                    works, which would again take time (he testified that it took about two months\n                    for the renovation works), to make the new premises fit for his machinery and\n                    business. He testified that although the Changi South premises were bigger, the\n                    extra space was unnecessary and he had in fact kept the extra space empty. I\n                    accept the plaintiff’s explanation. It was certainly not a case where the\n                    plaintiff had sought to expand his business when he moved to the Changi South\n                    premises as claimed by the defendants. Indeed, any such expansion would already\n                    have taken place when the plaintiff took up the extra unit,ie, unit #03-02, at Mintwell Building. 29     It should be further borne in mind that the\n                    plaintiff is not claiming for theadditional renthe has to pay for the Changi South premises as a result of the larger floor\n                    area. As such, the figures put forward by the defendants (see[21]above), which they claimed are savings to the\n                    plaintiff are, in my view, irrelevant for the present assessment of damages. The\n                    defendants also did not submit (and rightly so) that these savings should be\n                    deducted from the total damages awarded to the plaintiff. However, I should\n                    mention that the defendants did raise a further point about deducting unpaid\n                    rent from the damages awarded. They contended that the plaintiff did not pay\n                    them rent for unit #01-02 for the months of August to December 2006 when he was\n                    still in possession of the unit and had thus saved some $78,218 in rent (the\n                    plaintiff has, however, challenged this amount[note: 5]). They also contended that no rent was ever\n                    paid for unit #03-02, though no figure was submitted as to the arrears in rent.\n                    Accordingly, the defendants submitted that the amount of rent that the plaintiff\n                    withheld, especially the sum of $78,218, should be deducted from the award of\n                    damages[note: 6]. I am of the view that no such\n                    deduction can be made given that the defendants themselves did not counterclaim\n                    for the unpaid rent or plead the defence of set-off in the first place. In any\n                    event, the defendants have also not adduced any statements to prove the arrears\n                    in rent. 30     There is of course the defendants’\n                    further contention that a larger floor area would necessitate a larger amount\n                    being spent on the renovation works at the Changi South premises (though the\n                    defendants did not substantiate this contention in their submissions). I do not\n                    think this is necessarily so. If one looks at the list of expenses set out at[20]above, it would be noted that the\n                    bulk of the items such as the costs of the electrical works, the shifting of the\n                    plaintiff’s machinery and the piping and fittings required for the\n                    plaintiff’s operations pertains specifically to the plaintiff’s\n                    machinery and it is hard to see how the costs for such expenses would be\n                    determined or affected by the floor area. The same can be said of the expenses\n                    for shifting of the office furniture and equipment. No doubt some items\n                    would invariably be affected by the floor area; the plaintiff testified that as\n                    there was a longer distance from the compressor to the air-conditioning units at\n                    the Changi South premises, additional copper and tubings had to be used for the\n                    air-conditioning, and that for the ceiling, additional ceiling boards had to be\n                    purchased given the larger area. However, this alone does not mean that the\n                    plaintiff had failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate in the given\n                    circumstances. To begin with, the plaintiff had in fact brought over the\n                    air-conditioning compressor and units as well as the ceiling boards from\n                    Mintwell Building to be reused at the Changi South premises in a bid to save\n                    costs. Apart from these items, the plaintiff also moved over all other useable\n                    office furniture and equipment, including power points, wirings, cables, lights\n                    and carpets so as to incur less expenses for the renovation works at the Changi\n                    South premises. The truth is that the plaintiff did make considerate efforts to\n                    mitigate his losses. 31     The defendants, during the cross-examination\n                    of the plaintiff, also sought to point out that the costs charged by ACIS for\n                    air-conditioning and Sterling for shifting the machinery in relation to the\n                    Changi South premises were higher than the costs previously charged when the\n                    plaintiff moved from Betime Building at Macpherson Road into Mintwell Building\n                    (the plaintiff had engaged their services then as well). In respect of the costs\n                    charged by ACIS, the plaintiff explained that as the new premises had no\n                    brackets for the compressor, these had to be installed and additional costs were\n                    thus incurred. As for Sterling, the plaintiff explained that a higher fee was\n                    charged given that the Changi South premises were located on the third floor.\n                    Again, I do not think that the fact alone that these costs were higher for the\n                    Changi South premises would mean that the plaintiff’s claims were inflated\n                    and the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his losses. To begin with, it would be\n                    unrealistic to expect the costs for both moves to be the same given that the\n                    scope of the works undertaken by ACIS and Sterling for the two premises would\n                    likely be different. The defendants have also not adduced any contrary evidence\n                    to show that such expenses were excessive or inflated (cf GIB\n                        Automation([24]supra) where the defendant in that case had\n                    adduced evidence that the plaintiff had inflated the value of the items it\n                    ordered in order to claim a larger sum of damages (idat [81]–[97])). 32     As for the failure to obtain quotations from\n                    other contractors, the plaintiff explained that the contractors he hired for the\n                    renovation works at the Changi South premises were mostly his regular\n                    contractors who had done similar renovation works for him in the past at his\n                    premises at Mintwell Building as well as his premises prior to Mintwell Building\n                    at Betime Building. This evidence was not challenged by the defendants, who in\n                    fact relied on this fact for their cross-examination and submissions. The\n                    plaintiff said that he had engaged these contractors again for the Changi South\n                    premises as he knew they were reliable, they knew exactly what his requirements\n                    were and he trusted their workmanship. He candidly agreed with the suggestion of\n                    the counsel for the defendants, Mr Anthony Lee Hwee Khiam, during\n                    cross-examination that there could perhaps be other contractors who would charge\n                    a lower price for the same work, but he testified that he believed his\n                    contractors would not over-charge him for the works, given the trust and rapport\n                    they have built up with each other. He also explained that he had negotiated and\n                    bargained for a lower price with these contractors before they quoted/invoiced\n                    him. He further explained that given the short time frame he had, it was not\n                    quite feasible to source for and obtain quotations from other contractors,\n                    especially since he would have to spend time telling these new contractors his\n                    requirements all over again. For Boge, which was engaged by the plaintiff for\n                    the first time, the plaintiff explained that he had decided to engage them as\n                    Boge was the company that manufactured his machinery, and he thus felt safer\n                    that they did the piping and fittings for the machinery (which ran on compressed\n                    air) at the Changi South premises in the short span of time he had. I accept all\n                    the plaintiff’s explanation above which, in my view, is entirely\n                    reasonable in the circumstances. I would also add that the plaintiff struck me\n                    as a truthful witness throughout the proceedings. 33     On the totality of the facts and the evidence\n                    before me, I am of the view that the defendants did not discharge their burden\n                    of proving that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his losses. No doubt\n                    perhaps more savings could have been achieved if the plaintiff had the luxury of\n                    time to think or to source for alternative quotations, but this does not as a\n                    matter of course mean that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his losses. InDarbishire v Warren[1963]\n                    1 WLR 1067, Pearson LJ said (at 1075): … it is important to appreciate the true nature of the so-called\n                        \"duty to mitigate the loss\" or \"duty to minimise the damage.\"The plaintiff is not under any actual obligation to adopt the\n                            cheaper method: if he wishes to adopt the more expensive method, he is\n                            at liberty to do so and by doing so he commits no wrong against the\n                            defendant or anyone else. The true meaning is that the\n                        plaintiff is not entitled to charge the defendant by way of damages with any\n                        greater sum than that which he reasonably needs to expend for the purpose of\n                        making good the loss. In short, he is fully entitled to be as extravagant as\n                        he pleases but not at the expense of the defendant. [emphasis added] In my view, the plaintiff has already done what wasreasonable in the circumstancesto mitigate his losses and we\n                    should not, as Lord Macmillan suggested (see[25]above), on hindsight, nip-pick on what he could have done\n                    better and criticise and penalise him for that. Proof of damage 34     I turn now to the defendants’ second\n                    main contention,ie, the lack of proof for the\n                    expenses. 35     As held by Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA,\n                    delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, inRobertson\n                        Quay([16]supra) at [27], it is fundamental and trite that a\n                    claimant claiming damages must prove his damage,ie, he must satisfy the court both as to the fact of damage and\n                    as to its amount. Summarising the position at law, Andrew Phang JA said at\n                    [31]: To summarise, a plaintiff cannot simply make a claim for damages without\n                        placing before the court sufficient evidence of the loss it has suffered\n                        even if it is otherwise entitled in principle to recover damages. On the\n                        other hand, where the plaintiff has attempted its level best to prove its\n                        lossandthe evidence is cogent, the court\n                        should allow it to recover the damages claimed. [emphasis in\n                        original] 36     UnlikeRobertson\n                        Quaywhere the court found that there was nofactual linkbetween the additional interests claimed and the\n                    breach of contract (ie, it was not shown that the\n                    delay in construction had led to additional interest (claimed by the appellant\n                    in that case as damages) actually being incurred) to begin with, this is not the\n                    case here. The plaintiff has certainly incurred the expenses as evidenced in the\n                    invoices which are undisputedly for renovation works done at the Changi South\n                    premises, the move to the Changi South premises and the renovations being\n                    necessitated by the defendants’ breach. Indeed, the defendants are not\n                    contending otherwise. 37     However, as mentioned, the defendants’\n                    main complaint here is that the plaintiff did not call the various contractors\n                    to come to court to explain the renovations works that were carried out, why\n                    certain items of work had to be done and/or why such works were warranted. They\n                    took the view that the plaintiff’s explanation of what works were carried\n                    out was simply not enough. For instance, in respect of the invoices rendered by\n                    Qian Cheng, the defendants complained as follows[note: 7]: 43.    The person behind Qian Cheng… ,\n                            Mr David Tang, was not called as the Plaintiff’s witness to\n                            justify his recommendations as well as to the nature and extent of the\n                            works done. … 45.Because Mr David Tang was\n                                not called as a witness, there is therefore no direct evidence as to\n                                what was done, whether what was done was warranted in the ordinary\n                                course of events. [emphasis added] Similar assertions were made in respect of the other expenses in the\n                    defendants’ written submissions as well as throughout the\n                    cross-examination of the plaintiff. 38     Bearing in mind the guidelines laid down by\n                    Andrew Phang JA inRobertson Quay, I am of\n                    the view that the plaintiff by adducing the various quotations and invoices,\n                    which showed clearly that the works listed there were for the Changi South\n                    premises, has done his level best to adduce sufficient and cogent evidence to\n                    prove his losses. 39     The defendants make a general unqualified\n                    assertion that the production of quotations and invoices was insufficient and it\n                    was necessary to call the contractors to explain these documents. Taken to its\n                    logical conclusion, it would mean that in every assessment of damages where a\n                    quotation/invoice is produced by a claimant to prove certain expense/loss he has\n                    incurred (and this would be the case in most cases), the maker of the\n                    quotation/invoice has to come to court to explain it. This would be most\n                    impractical especially if a large number of quotations/invoices from different\n                    contractors are tendered. In my view, there cannot be such a general requirement\n                    in law. 40     This is not to say that it would always be\n                    sufficient just to adduce quotations/invoices to prove one’s alleged\n                    expenses/losses. As pointed out by Andrew Phang JA inRobertson Quay(at[27]),\n                    the process of proof of damage is an “intensely factual one” (even\n                    more so than mitigation) and it would not be possible to lay down any general\n                    rules or principles as to what would constitute adequate proof of damage since\n                    the particular factual circumstances of a case could take literally a myriad of\n                    forms. There are cases such as that inRobertson\n                        Quaywhere the adduction of invoices or receipts would be\n                    insufficient when to begin with, there appears to be no factual link at all\n                    between the damage claimed and the breach. There could also be a situation where\n                    the quotation/invoice may call for some explanation such as where the figures in\n                    the quotation/invoice may appear to be inflated or certain items appear to be\n                    unusual or special, and in such a case, there may be a need to call the maker of\n                    the quotation/invoice to court to explain the figures or why the items were\n                    indeed necessary. 41     In the present case, it should be first borne\n                    in mind that the defendants are not at all disputing theadmissibilityof the quotations and invoices tendered by the\n                    plaintiff. The works listed in the various quotations and invoices did not\n                    appear to be unusual or special to suggest that they were unconnected to the\n                    renovation of the Changi South premises for the purposes of the\n                    plaintiff’s business. It is noteworthy that most of these\n                    quotations/invoices were from the plaintiff’s regular contractors who had\n                    undertaken similar works for the plaintiff in the past whenever he shifted\n                    premises. As mentioned (at[31]above), the\n                    defendants pointed out that the costs for certain works were higher (when\n                    compared to similar works done for the two units at Mintwell Building) but for\n                    reasons given above (at[31]), I have\n                    accepted the plaintiff’s explanation for the difference in costs. By\n                    adducing the quotations and invoices for the various works done at the Changi\n                    South premises, the plaintiff has satisfied the burden of proof of\n                    damage. Conclusion 42     In conclusion, for the reasons above, I award\n                    the plaintiff the full sum of $191,195.38 he claimed for the expenses he\n                    incurred for the renovation works at the Changi South premises.",
        "Expenses incurred for unit #03-02": "43     The plaintiff also claimed a sum of $15,964\n                    spent on renovating and fitting unit #03-02 at Mintwell Building. The plaintiff,\n                    as mentioned, did not commence operations at this unit. 44     According to the plaintiff, this claim in\n                    respect of unit #03-02 is a claim for reliance damages and not expectation\n                    damages, unlike the rest of his claims for damages[note: 8]. The plaintiff argued that the lease for\n                    unit #03-02 was a separate contract and he was entitled to elect the basis of\n                    his recovery. The defendants, on the other hand, argued that the plaintiff could\n                    not claim for this amount because to claim for both expectation and reliance\n                    damages at the same time would be double recovery. In support of their argument,\n                    the defendants relied on the cases ofCullinane v British\n                        “Rema” Manufacturing Co Ld[1954]\n                    1 QB 292 (“Cullinane”) andHong Fok Realty Pte Ltd v Bima Investment Pte\n                        Ltd[1992] 2 SLR(R) 834 (“Hong Fok Realty”). 45     Given that the plaintiff had incurred money to\n                    renovate unit #03-02 but never had the chance to utilise it, it would appear\n                    intuitively that he should be allowed to recover his wasted expenditure.\n                    However, there is merit in the defendants’ argument. Notwithstanding the\n                    plaintiff’s point that there are two leases and hence two contracts here,\n                    the plaintiff has claimed, and I have already awarded him, the expenses incurred\n                    in relation to the Changi South premises, which is areplacementpremises forbothunits #01-02 and #03-02 at Mintwell Building. Together with the rest of the\n                    damages I am awarding below, the plaintiff would be placed in a position he\n                    would have been in ifboththe contracts had been\n                    performed (having been awarded in this case, as commonly said, the “costs\n                    of cure”). In other words, the plaintiff has effectively claimed\n                    expectation damages in respect of the lease for unit #03-02 as well. And if the\n                    contract had been performed, the plaintiff would necessarily have to incur the\n                    $15,964 to renovate unit #03-02. Hence, it would be wrong in principle to award\n                    the plaintiff the sum of $15,964 in addition to the expenses for the Changi\n                    South premises. In this regard, the following passage fromMcGregor on Damages([16]supra) is instructive (at para 2-018): It is important to note… that not only must the defendant be\n                        credited with the amount that the claimant has saved by no longer having to\n                        perform his side of the bargain, butthe claimant cannot\n                            also recover, in addition to the basic loss which is intended to\n                            represent the loss of his bargain, any expenses he has incurred in\n                            preparation or in part performance. Such expenses represent part of the\n                            price that the claimant has to incur to secure his bargain.\n                        If he recovers for the loss of his bargain, it would be inconsistent that he\n                        should in addition recover for expenses which were necessarily laid out by\n                        him for its attainment. [emphasis added] 46     Thus, inCullinane, the English Court of Appeal rejected the\n                    plaintiff’s claim insofar as it sought to recover both expectation and\n                    reliance damages. Evershed MR, delivering the judgment of the court, said at\n                    302: It seems to me, as a matter of principle, that the full claim of damages\n                        in the form in which it is pleaded was not sustainable, in so far as the\n                        plaintiff sought to recoverboth the whole of his\n                            original capital loss and also the whole of the profit which he would\n                            have made. I think that that is really a self-evident\n                        proposition, because a claim for loss of profits could only be founded upon\n                        the footing that the capital expenditure had been incurred. [emphasis\n                        added] 47     There is no doubt that a claimant generally\n                    has a discretion to choose between a claim for reliance damages or a claim for\n                    expectation damages unless the defendant can show that the claimant has made a\n                    bad bargain and hence should not be entitled to recover reliance damages (seeCCF Films (London) Ltd v Impact Quadrant Films\n                        Ltd[1985] 1 QB 16). However, he cannot have both for\n                    the same loss. The cases ofCullinane(at\n                    302–303 and 308) andHong Fok Realty(at\n                    [60]–[62]) cited by the defendants also make it clear that it would be\n                    wrong in principle to award a claimant both expectation and reliance damages for\n                    the same loss. 48     In short, for the reasons above, I would\n                    disallow the plaintiff’s claim for $15,964.",
        "Labour costs": "49     I turn now to the plaintiff’s claim for\n                    damages of $27,551.95 in respect of the labour costs for himself and his staff\n                    that were incurred as a result of the move. These are manhours for the period\n                    18 November 2006 to 3 December 2006 where the move to the Changi South\n                    premises was carried out, and the breakdown is as follows: (a)     $22,400 for the plaintiff himself\n                        for the over-time hours he spent doing work for the move. This is based on\n                        an hourly rate of $200 and the plaintiff claimed he had spent a total of 112\n                        over-time hours on the move. According to the plaintiff, the hourly rate of\n                        $200 is the rate that he charges his customers. As evidence, he adduced four\n                        commercial invoices to his customers which reflected his work time charges\n                        as $200 per hour[note: 9]. He explained that he had\n                        to spend time to design and make plans for the machine layout and to\n                        configure the machines subsequently at the Changi South\n                    premises. (b)     $5,151.95\n                        for the plaintiff’s staff for work done for the move. The plaintiff\n                        explained that this figure is made up of: (i) the over-time hours spent on\n                        the move by his salaried employees during the shifting period; and (ii) the\n                        hours spent by his contract workers purely for the move (a detailed\n                        breakdown of the hours spent on the move by each of the plaintiff’s\n                        staff can be found in a summary table exhibited at p 37 of the\n                        plaintiff’s supplementary AEIC (“summary table”)). He\n                        also explained that for his salaried employees, they are paid 1.5 times\n                        their basic hourly rate if they are required by him to work over-time on a\n                        day that falls on Monday to Saturday, twice their basic hourly rate if they\n                        are required to work by him on Sundays and their basic hourly rate if they\n                        themselves request to work over-time[note: 10]. The plaintiff further clarified that for\n                        his salaried employees who earn more than $2,000 a month (and there are five\n                        of them), as a general rule, they are not paid any over-time work they do in\n                        relation to the daily operations at Euromal. However, as the work for the\n                        move was not part of their usual job scope, they had to be compensated for\n                        the over-time work they put in. For these salaried employees, they are\n                        simply paid their basic hourly rate for the over-time hours spent on the\n                        move[note: 11]. As for the contract\n                        workers, they are paid a standard fee of $5.64 per hour for working in the\n                        day and $5.91 per hour for working at night[note: 12]. 50     The plaintiff explained that the during the\n                    shifting period, the only working day in which no operations took place at\n                    Euromal was the actual day of the move itself,ie,\n                    23 November 2006, Thursday. However, as 23 November 2006 was a normal\n                    work day and his salaried employees and himself would be remunerated for the\n                    normal work hours as part of their basic salaries, he is not claiming for the\n                    hours that they spent on the move during office hours[note: 13]. The plaintiff is also not claiming for the\n                    hours spent by the salaried employees and himself on the move during office\n                    hours for the other days during the shifting period as it would be difficult to\n                    separate exactly how much time they spent on the daily operations from the time\n                    they spent on the move during office hours on those days[note: 14]. 51     The defendants do not take issue with the\n                    rates or the method of calculation put forward by the plaintiff; their objection\n                    for this head of damages is simply that the plaintiff has not proved these\n                    damages. In respect of the manhours for the plaintiff himself, the defendants\n                    argued that there was simply no evidence that because the plaintiff had spent\n                    time on the move, he was deprived of the opportunity to service his customers as\n                    a professional engineer. They also argued that the plaintiff, apart from a bare\n                    assertion, has not adduced any evidence, such as drawings or sketch plans, to\n                    prove that he had actually done work for the move as he has claimed. They\n                    pointed out that ultimately there was simply no record of what the plaintiff did\n                    for the 112 hours. In respect of the other staff, though,inter alia, punch cards and their pay slips have been adduced by\n                    the plaintiff to prove that the staff had worked over-time during the shifting\n                    period, the defendants argued that there was nonetheless no evidence as to how\n                    they spent the time allegedly spent on the move, given that the staff were not\n                    called by the plaintiff as witnesses. 52     For the manhours claimed by the plaintiff for\n                    himself, I find that there are merits in the defendants’ submissions.\n                    No doubt the plaintiff would have to spend time on the move (would this not\n                    be so in all cases of breach, where the claimant would arguably have to expend\n                    time (which could have been spent elsewhere either for work or leisure) to deal\n                    with the inconveniences or problems created by the defendant’s breach),\n                    but it does not appear to me that he has actually suffered a pecuniary loss as a\n                    result. Notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff charges his customers $200\n                    per hour for work done, it should be borne in mind that the plaintiff’s\n                    own evidence is that he has not lost any business nor suffered any loss of\n                    profits because of the eviction or move. He stated in his supplementary AEIC\n                    that he had managed to fulfil all his orders despite the inconveniences caused\n                    by the eviction and the move to Changi South premises[note: 15]. That is also why the plaintiff is not\n                    claiming for any loss of profits. There was no evidence that those 112 hours he\n                    allegedly spent on the move would have been spent servicing clients; in fact,\n                    the evidence I just pointed out would suggest the contrary. More importantly, I\n                    agree with the defendants that there was simply no evidence save for the\n                    plaintiff’s own bare assertion that he had spent the 112 hours on the\n                    move. Unlike his staff, the plaintiff does not have a punch card that records\n                    his work hours. The plaintiff has not adduced any other records or any plans or\n                    drawings that he had allegedly spent time coming up with for the move to\n                    substantiate his claim. I would therefore disallow the plaintiff’s claim\n                    for $22,400. 53     Turning to the manhours for the staff, punch\n                    cards, pay slips and invoices paid to the company who supplied the contract\n                    workers have been adduced to prove that the staff had to work over-time during\n                    the shifting period and such additional labour costs were incurred. The\n                    defendants, however, submitted that there was still no evidence on whether the\n                    staff in fact spent those hours on the move, especially since they were not\n                    called to give evidence. They contended that this claim was put in merely to\n                    inflate the plaintiff’s claim. I disagree as it could be inferred from the\n                    punch cards as well as the summary table that the over-time hours were for the\n                    shifting period and that the bulk of the hours (especially for the contract\n                    workers) were for 23 November 2006, the actual day of the move. The\n                    plaintiff has taken the trouble to explain carefully how the figures were\n                    arrived at and how, in fairness, he had excluded those office hours spent by the\n                    salaried employees on the move to claim only the over-time hours. I am satisfied\n                    that the plaintiff has done enough to prove that he has to pay his salaried\n                    employees for the over-time hours spent on the move, as well as for the hours\n                    spent by his contract workers on the move. I disagree with the defendants that\n                    there is a need to call all 22 staff (salaried and contract) to court to give\n                    evidence. 54     There is one more minor objection I should\n                    deal with for the manhours claimed by the plaintiff for his staff. It came up\n                    during cross-examination that the plaintiff has yet to pay all the staff the\n                    extra salaries they earned for the move. The plaintiff explained that he had\n                    reached an agreement with his staff whereby the latter agreed that they would be\n                    paid after the plaintiff’s claim against the defendants is concluded in\n                    court. In this regard, the defendants submitted in their written submissions\n                    that the “alleged cost of the manhours has not even\n                        crystallised”[note: 16]. I do not see this as a hurdle\n                    for the plaintiff. The plaintiff has clarified in his written submissions that\n                    it is only the plaintiff and the five salaried employees who have yet to been\n                    paid[note: 17]. The bottomline is that the\n                    staff areentitledto the over-time pay. As the\n                    plaintiff stated in his submissions, “[t]he obligation to pay\n                    exists”[note: 18]and it is only “a\n                    function of timing and not of the obligation to pay”[note: 19]. The plaintiff is entitled to recover\n                    damages for the unpaid salariesowedto the\n                    salaried employees. I will therefore allow the claim of $5,151.95.",
        "Legal costs": "55     The last head of damages claimed by the\n                    plaintiff is legal costs incurred for the following matters: (a)     $15,099.91 incurred for contesting\n                        the eviction; and (b)     $2,091.29 incurred for the title searches/conveyancing fees for the\n                        Tai Seng premises and the Changi South premises. 56     The defendants’ objection to the first\n                    set of legal costs of $15,099.91 is rather peculiar. Unlike the second set of\n                    legal costs, the defendants did not contest that this sum is too remote but that\n                    the plaintiff should have taxed the invoice of his solicitors for the costs of\n                    $15,099.91[note: 20]. In support of this\n                    contention, the defendants made reference to the cases ofGreat Western Railway Company v Fisher[1905]\n                    1 Ch 316,Butterworth v Kingsway Motors[1954] 1 WLR 1286 andBritish Racing Drivers Club\n                        Ltd v Hextall Erskine & Co[1996] 3 All ER 667. In\n                    respect of the second set of legal costs, they took the position that the\n                    plaintiff ought not recover costs in respect of legal work done in relation to\n                    the Tai Seng premises given that such a loss was too remote to be recovered as\n                    “it [was] not reasonably foreseeable that the [p]laintiff [would] incur\n                    more than 1 tranche of legal fees in his search for alternative\n                    premises”[note: 21]. 57     For the first set of legal costs for\n                    contesting the eviction, I find that the defendants’ argument is\n                    misconceived and the cases cited are distinguishable and unhelpful. In fact, the\n                    defendants’ written submissions appear to conflate different principles.\n                    Essentially, what the defendants have done is to refer to English cases where a\n                    claimant had sought to recover costs he incurred in previous proceedings as\n                    damages in the current proceedings against a defendant in two situations,\n                    namely: (a)     where the claimant had beensuccessfulin the previous action and had\n                        recovered costs from the unsuccessful party, and he now sought to recover\n                        the shortfall between the actual costs incurred and the costs awarded from\n                        the defendant whose wrong had been the cause of the previous action;\n                        and (b)     where the\n                        claimant had beenunsuccessfulin the previous\n                        action and had to pay costs to the successful party and his own costs, and\n                        he now sought to recover both sets of costs from the defendant whose wrong\n                        had been the cause of the previous action. 58     The positions in the United Kingdom for both\n                    situations prior to and after 1986 are different given the change to the costs\n                    regime made in 1986 to move from necessary costs to reasonable costs (see\n                    generallyMcGregor on Damages([16]supra) at paras 17-003 to 17-019). Without\n                    differentiating the two situations and citing cases pre and post 1986, the\n                    defendants referred to these cases as supporting the proposition that only taxed\n                    costs can be recovered (and hence my remark about conflating the different\n                    principles in their submissions). Without going into the details of these cases\n                    and the law (and the position in England for situation (b) post 1986 appears to\n                    be open and unsettled (seeMcGregor on Damagesat\n                    para 17-009)), it would be clear that the present case does not quite fall under\n                    either situation. The plaintiff is not strictly speaking a party in\n                    SUM 3453/2006 or OS 1106/2002 but had merely intervened at the hearing\n                    for the execution of the writ of possession by OCBC. Although he was\n                    unsuccessful in resisting the eviction, he did not have to pay the costs for\n                    OCBC; in fact, he was awarded $1,000 costs (payable by the defendants) by the\n                    Assistant Registrar. On this ground alone, it would be sufficient for me to\n                    dismiss the defendants’ argument. 59     In my view, it would have be within the\n                    contemplation of the parties (from a contract’s perspective) and/or\n                    reasonably foreseeable (from a tort’s perspective) (see[61]–[74]below for the tests of remoteness for contract and tort) in\n                    this case that the plaintiff would have to incur legal fees to contest the\n                    eviction as a result of the defendants’ breach, and the defendants are not\n                    contending otherwise at least in respect of this set of legal costs. The\n                    plaintiff should thus be allowed to recover the legal costs he incurred for\n                    contesting the eviction. However, the damages awarded for this set of legal\n                    costs should rightly take into account the $1,000 the plaintiff was awarded as\n                    costs at the hearing of SUM 3453/2006. As such, I will award the plaintiff the\n                    sum of $14,099.91 ($15,099.91 - $1,000). Remoteness of damage 60     I turn now to consider the issue of remoteness\n                    in relation to the second set of legal costs. 61     As reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal inRobertson Quay([16]supra), the test of remoteness for contract in\n                    Singapore is the famous and hallowed rule laid down by Alderson B inHadley v Baxendale(1854) 9 Exch 341 at 354\n                    (“the rule inHadley”), as restated\n                    by Asquith LJ inVictoria Laundry (Windsor) Ld v Newman\n                        Industries Ld[1949] 2 KB 528. The test is premised on\n                    the criterion of “reasonable contemplation” of the parties and\n                    comprises of two limbs – damages under the first limb are known as\n                    “ordinary damages” which flow naturally from a breach of contract\n                    and damages under the second limb are known as “extraordinary\n                    damage”, which do not flow naturally from a breach of contract, but\n                    rather are due to special circumstances (Robertson\n                        Quayat [59]; see also [81]–[82]): … the criterion of “reasonable contemplation” applies\n                        to both limbs of the rule inHadley, although\n                        a difference exists between its application with respect to each of the two\n                        limbs. For the first limb ofHadley, the\n                        horizon of contemplation is confined to loss which arises naturally in the\n                        usual course of things and which is therefore presumed to have been within\n                        the contemplation of the parties. For the second limb of the rule inHadley… , by reason of the special\n                        knowledge possessed by the party who breaches the contract… , the\n                        horizon of contemplation is extended to loss that does not arise in the\n                        usual course of things (seeThe Heron IIat\n                        415–416). 62     The rationality and functionality of the rule\n                    inHadleywas also given elucidation by Andrew\n                    Phang JA inRobertson Quay, who gave two main\n                    reasons for the rule. First, he explained that the rule inHadleyserved as a useful distinction between the rules and\n                    principles relating to remoteness in the law of contract and those in tort\n                        (Robertson Quayat [71]). Secondly, and more\n                    importantly, the rule inHadley“most\n                    appropriately” described the rules relating to remoteness in the context\n                    of the law of contract (idat [74]), having regard\n                    to the concept that the law of contract, put simply, is about agreement\n                        (idat [75]). He explained that save for\n                    instances where the contractual parties have made provision for remedies and\n                    damages in the event of breach by including a liquidated damages clause in their\n                    contract, the parties would not have fixed in advance the type as well as the\n                    amount of monetary loss recoverable. The courts would thus have to formulate\n                    “default rules” of universal application as to what would be\n                    recoverable and what would be too remote to be recoverable, bearing in mind that\n                    the parties had the opportunity to communicate with each other in advance and\n                    the need to preserve the sanctity of contract (idat [76]–[79]). The two limbs in the rule inHadleythus provided such default rules that were both just and\n                    fair. 63     Shortly afterRobertson\n                        Quaywas decided by the Singapore Court of Appeal, the House of\n                    Lords reconsidered the rules of remoteness for contract inTransfield Shipping Inc v Mercator Shipping Inc[2009]\n                    1 AC 61 (“The Achilleas”)\n                    and appeared to favour a shift from the orthodox approach premised on the\n                    reasonable contemplation of the contracting parties (as embodied in the rule inHadley) to one premised on the assumption of\n                    responsibility,ie, a contractual party is only\n                    liable for such losses that he has assumed responsibility. Such a view was put\n                    forward most strongly by Lord Hoffmann who held at [12]: It seems to me logical to found liability for damages\n                            upon the intention of the parties (objectively ascertained) because all\n                            contractual liability is voluntarily undertaken. It must be\n                        in principle wrong to hold someone liable for risks for which the people\n                        entering into such a contract in their particular market, would not\n                        reasonably be considered to have undertaken. [emphasis added] 64The Achilleaswas a case involving a claim by the owners of a vessel for loss of profits\n                    against a charterer for theentireduration of a\n                    follow-on charter caused by the late redelivery of the vessel. The owners had\n                    fixed the follow-on charter at a lucrative rate. Due to the delay in redelivery\n                    by the charterer, they had to reduce the rate in consideration of an extension\n                    of the cancellation date in the follow-on charter and in the light of a sudden\n                    fall in the market rate. The majority of the arbitrators awarded the loss of\n                    profits claimed on the basis that such loss arose naturally from the breach of\n                    contract, despite having found that there was a general understanding in the\n                    shipping market that a charterer would only be liable for damages for theperiod of late delivery. The\n                    arbitrators’ decision was upheld by both the first instance judge and the\n                    Court of Appeal but was reversed by the House of Lords. Lord Hoffmann held that,\n                    if one considered what the parties, contracting against the background of market\n                    expectations found by the arbitrators, would have considered the extent of the\n                    liability they were undertaking, it would be clear that the charterer could not\n                    have assumed responsibility for such loss of profits on the follow-on charter\n                        (The Achilleasat [23]). 65     It would appear that the approach based on the\n                    assumption of responsibility would be a more stringent approach, given that a\n                    claimant would not recover, even for losses that were not unlikely to occur in\n                    the usual course of things, if the defendant cannot reasonably be regarded as\n                    having assumed responsibility for losses of the kind suffered (Chitty on Contracts(H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &\n                    Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) (“Chitty”)\n                    in vol 1 at para 26-100A). 66     Interestingly, the difference in approach\n                    taken by our Court of Appeal inRobertson Quayand\n                    the House of Lords inThe Achilleaswere\n                    considered recently in the local context by AR Teo Guan Siew inChee Peng Kwan v Toh Swee Hwee Thomas[2009]\n                    SGHC 141 (“Chee Peng Kwan”) and\n                    Goh Yihan in a case commentary onRobertson Quay(see (2009) 9 OUCLJ 101 (“Goh’s commentary”)).\n                    Both, in my view, provided invaluable insight on this issue. In his judgment (at\n                    [38]–[39]), AR Teo pointed out that the fundamental difference between the\n                    two approaches is essentially a point of principle – the Court of Appeal\n                    saw the rule of remoteness as anexternalrule of\n                    law imposed upon the parties to every contract in default of express provision\n                    to the contrary, while the House of Lords saw the rule of remoteness as aprima facieassumption about what the parties\n                    may be taken to have intended to assume responsibility for, but rebuttable in\n                    cases where the context and circumstances show that a party would not reasonably\n                    have been regarded as assuming responsibility for such losses (see alsoThe Achilleasat [9]perLord Hoffmann). Goh opined that, on a closer examination,\n                    the two approaches may not be that different if the Court of Appeal’s\n                    approach is seen as providing default rules applicable in the absence of\n                    agreement,accompaniedby animplicitallocation of risk and responsibility (see Goh’s\n                    commentary at pp 105–106). However, he was of the view there were still\n                    “practical differences in how [the] conceptual understanding [of\n                    remoteness principles] is to be given effect” (Goh’s commentary at\n                    p 107). In this regard, he said (at p 107): While the Court of Appeal uses allocation of risk and responsibility as a\n                        justification for the rule inHadley v\n                            Baxendale, it is not imported as a requirement. Indeed, the\n                        mere requirement of knowledge (actual or imputed), and the equation of\n                        knowledge with liability, would mean that the justificatory reason of\n                        agreement is imputed instead of actual. There is no need for actual\n                        agreement, even implied, to bear such loss. On the other hand, the approach\n                        of Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope inThe\n                            Achilleasis to bring the justification to bear in terms of\n                        the requirement; what needs to be objectively ascertained is whether there\n                        is really assumption of responsibility for the type of loss in question by\n                        the contracting parties. 67     Leaving aside the difference in principle\n                    between the two, it would not be wrong to say that at the heart of both\n                    approaches is still the ultimate desire to provide for the recoverability of\n                    damages for breach of contract in a way that gives thebesteffect to the concept of a contract as anagreement. We have seen the emphasis placed by Lord\n                    Hoffmann on discerning the intention of the parties so as to determine\n                    effectively the losses the parties haveagreedto\n                    undertake for their breach (see[63]above).\n                    Likewise, Andrew Phang JA made it clear that the rule inHadleyshould continue to be applied by the courts because\n                    “the two limbs of the rule inHadleyare\n                    wholly consistent with – and, in fact, give effect to – the concept\n                    of contract as anagreement” (Robertson Quay([16]supra) at [83]). On a practical note, it would be\n                    more likely than not that both approaches will lead to the same outcome in most\n                    cases. The losses which are within the reasonable contemplation of the parties\n                    will most probable than not coincide with the losses that the parties can be\n                    taken to have assumed responsibility on anobjectiveassessment of their intention (in Lord\n                    Hoffmann’s own words, the parties’ intention is to be\n                        “objectivelyascertained”\n                    [emphasis added] (see[63]above)). Lord\n                    Hoffmann himself had in fact stressed that departure from the orthodox rule\n                    based on individual circumstances will be unusual (The\n                        Achilleas([63]supra) at [11]; see\n                    also Edwin Peel, “Remoteness Revisited” (2009) 125 LQR 6\n                    (“Peel”) at p 9). Thus, even on the facts ofThe Achilleas, Lord Hoffmann opined that the same\n                    outcome could perhaps have been reached on the orthodox approach, contrary to\n                    what the arbitrators, the first instance judge and the Court of Appeal had\n                    thought (at [24]): The findings of the majority arbitrators shows that they considered their\n                        decision to be contrary to what would have been the expectations of the\n                        parties, but dictated by the rules inHadley v\n                            Baxendaleas explained inThe Heron\n                            II[1969] 1 AC 350 .But in\n                            my opinion these rules are not so inflexible; they are intended to give\n                            effect to the presumed intentions of the parties and not to contradict\n                            them. [emphasis added] Likewise, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe allowed the appeal on grounds\n                    that were reminiscent of both approaches (seeThe\n                        Achilleasat [69], [86] and [87]). Two other members of the\n                    House, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry and Baroness Hale of Richmond (who agreed with\n                    Lord Rodger’s reasons), in fact decided on the orthodox approach (seeThe Achilleasat [52], [60] and [93]). Given\n                    that the two approaches can be said to share a common ultimate aim and the\n                    likelihood of similar outcomes in most cases, it could perhaps be said that the\n                    two are not wholly irreconcilable (a point similarly shared by Goh), though\n                    admittedly the point of principle as pointed out by AR Teo\n                remains. 68     Turning then to this more difficult question\n                    of principle, should the rule of remoteness be seen as an external rule of law\n                    or an assumption of responsibility? The former, in my view, would appear to\n                    accord more to therealitiesof the contracting\n                    process. It would not be wrong to say that for contracts where there is an\n                    absence of express provisions providing for breach and/or remedies, the parties\n                    usually do not apply their minds during the formation of the contract to what is\n                    to happen in the event of a breach and what kind of losses the party in breach\n                    should be liable (seeMcGregor on Damages([16]supra) at para 6-171 and Andrew Robertson,\n                    “The Basis of the Remoteness Rule in Contract” (2008)\n                    28 Legal Studies 172 (“Robertson”) at p 176 where\n                    it is cogently argued that parties usually contemplate performance rather than\n                    breach). For if they have done so, they would in the ordinary course of things\n                    have made express provisions for such event in their contract. It has thus been\n                    observed that discerning the intention of the parties under the assumption of\n                    risk approach may be anartificialexercise since\n                    there would usually be little or no evidence of the parties having thought about\n                    the risks they were accepting (Peel at p 11 andChee\n                        Peng Kwanat[36]; see also\n                    Robertson at pp 185–186 and 196). It follows that there are limits to the\n                    extent that it is feasible to determine liability by reference to an assumption\n                    of responsibility, and such an approach may engender more uncertainties than a\n                    simple rule that the party in breach is liable for all losses that are\n                    sufficiently likely to occur in the usual course of things, or whose likelihood\n                    has been brought home to him when the contract was made, unless he has validly\n                    excluded or restricted his liability (seeChittyat para 26-100G andMcGregor on Damagesat para\n                    6-171). 69     The assumption of responsibility approach\n                    which gives primacy to the intention of parties may also not be entirely\n                    consonant with the accepted concept that the rule of remoteness is essentially\n                    one ofpolicy. As pointed by VK Rajah JA inSunny Metal & Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming\n                        Eric[2007] 3 SLR 782 (“Sunny\n                        Metal (CA)”) (at [51] and [56]), the rule of remoteness\n                    “[embodies] legal principles strictly founded upon reasons of\n                    policy”, where legal policy and accepted value judgment must be the\n                    “final arbiter” on what is the right balance to strike between a\n                    claimant’s right to full compensation and indeterminate liability for a\n                    defendant (see alsoMcGregor on Damagesat paras\n                    4-023, 6-080 and 6-155, Edwin Peel,Treitel on the Law of\n                        Contract(Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2007) at para 20-082 andChee Peng Kwanat [40]). From a policy\n                    perspective, it may be questionable why the courts should provide additional\n                    protection to defendants inallcases by imposing\n                    a higher threshold in insisting that a defendant should only be liable for\n                    losses that he could be said to have reasonably assumed responsibility (see also[65]above). As noted by Lord Reid inThe Heron II([16]supra) (at 385–386) and Andrew Phang JA\n                    inRobertson Quay(at [71] and [75]–[76]),\n                    parties in a contract case, unlike those in tort, have the opportunity to direct\n                    each other’s attention to the unusual risks and either can take extra\n                    precautions to safeguard his position. Leaving aside the more unusual cases likeThe Achilleas, why should the courts provide\n                    additional protection in most other cases then (seeChittyat para 26-100G)? 70     Lastly, it should perhaps be noted that\n                    insofar as the approach of assumption of responsibility is concerned, the House\n                    of Lords inThe Achilleasdoes not appear to be\n                    unanimous on this point. Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope of Craighead were the only\n                    two in favour of the assumption of responsibility approach and decided on that\n                    basis. As pointed out, Lord Walker seemed to have decided on grounds embodying\n                    both approaches, while Lord Rodger and Baroness Hale simply decided on the\n                    orthodox approach and declined to express any firm views on Lord\n                    Hoffmann’s approach. It is thus not surprising that the learned authors ofMcGregor on Damageshave argued that that view\n                    of Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope did not command a clear majority so as to make it\n                    into theratio decidendiofThe\n                        Achilleas(at para 6-173). The assumption of responsibility\n                    approach also appears to run precariously close to the implied term approach\n                    that was previously rejected by the House of Lords inThe\n                        Heron II(at 422perLord UpJohn).\n                    What then can one make of the decision of the House of Lords inThe Achilleas? In the recent case ofSupershield Limited v Siemens Building Technologies Fe Limited[2010] EWCA Civ 7, Lord Justice Toulson, delivering the judgment of the\n                    English Court of Appeal, had this to say about the effect ofThe Achilleason the law of remoteness in contract (at\n                    [43]): Hadley v Baxendale remains a standard rule but it has been\n                    rationalised on the basis that it reflects the expectation to be imputed to the\n                    parties in the ordinary case, i.e. that a contract breaker should ordinarily be\n                    liable to the other party for damage resulting from his breach if, but only if,\n                    at the time of making the contract a reasonable person in his shoes would have\n                    had damage of that kind in mind as not unlikely to result from a breach.\n                    However, …Transfield Shipping [ie,The\n                        Achilleas] [is] authority that there may be cases where the\n                    court, on examining the contract and the commercial background, decides that the\n                    standard approach would not reflect the expectation or intention reasonably to\n                    be imputed to the parties. In those two instances the effect was exclusionary;\n                    the contract breaker was held not to be liable for loss which resulted from its\n                    breach although some loss of the kind was not unlikely. But logically the same\n                    principle may have an inclusionary effect. If, on the proper analysis of the\n                    contract against its commercial background, the loss was within the scope of the\n                    duty, it cannot be regarded as too remote, even if it would not have occurred in\n                    ordinary circumstances. [emphasis added] Similarly, the learned\n                    authors ofChitty([65]supra) are also in favour of confiningThe\n                        Achilleasto only exceptional circumstances (see\n                    para 26-100G). All that can be safely said for now is that it remains to be\n                    seen if the assumption of responsibility would become the governing rule for\n                    remoteness in contract in the United Kingdom. 71     Insofar as Singapore is concerned, the law\n                    sinceRobertson Quayhas been settled, albeit the\n                    Court of Appeal has yet to have the opportunity to consider the case ofThe Achilleas. 72     Turning now to the test of remoteness in tort,\n                    the test is simply one based on reasonable foreseeability (see in particular the\n                    classic Privy Council decision ofOverseas Tankship (UK) Ltd\n                        v Morts Dock & Engineering Co Ltd (The Wagon Mound)[1961]\n                    1 AC 388,Ho Soo Fong v Standard Chartered\n                        Bank[2007] 2 SLR 181 at [39] andSunny Metal (CA)at [56]). 73     As alluded to above (at[16]), the test in tort is broader than that in\n                    contract. The difference between the two tests has been explained inSunny Metal (HC)([16]supra) at [138] (although the decision of the High\n                    Court was reversed, this point was not disapproved by the Court of\n                    Appeal): It is clear that,ceteris paribus, thetortiousprinciples of remoteness arebroaderthan the correspondingcontractualprinciples. Indeed, it would conduce\n                        towards more clarity if the phrase “reasonableforeseeablity” was utilised to describe thetortiousprinciples of remoteness, and the phrase\n                        “reasonablecontemplation” was\n                        utilised to describe thecontractualprinciples of remoteness. Put simply, the tortious principles of remoteness\n                        are broader and more “generous” simply because, apart from\n                        situations where there isconcurrentliability\n                        in both tort and contract, a situation involving tortuous liability would\n                        relate to parties who have hadno prior relationship with\n                            each other. This is, of course, instark\n                            contrastto a situation involvingcontractualliability where there would,ex hypothesi, be an existing (contractual) relationship\n                        between the parties. In such a situation, the parties would be expected to\n                        provide for any reasonable contingencies that might be expected to arise. In\n                        any event, it would be easier toinferwhat\n                        the parties might have provided even if no express term covered the\n                        contingency concerned (for example, a term could possibly beimpliedeither “in fact” or “in\n                        law”). It is only logical and commonsensical, therefore, thatstricterrules and principles of\n                        remoteness obtain in the contractual – as opposed to the tortious\n                        – sphere. [emphasis in original] 74     It has been held by the High Court that where\n                    there is concurrent liability in both contract and tort that arises out of legal\n                    duties owed in both contract and tort, the stricter rules and principles of\n                    remoteness in contract ought to prevail (Sunny Metal\n                        (HC)at [139]–[140]). The present case does not strictly\n                    concern concurrent liability/duties as that envisaged by the High Court inSunny Metal (HC), given that there are two\n                    separate judgments here, one in contract against Mintwell and the other in tort\n                    against Mintwell and Seah (and the latter is for misrepresentation). However, it\n                    can be safely said that if the stricter test of remoteness in contract is\n                    satisfied in this case, then the lower test of remoteness in tort should also be\n                    satisfied given that both judgments arose out of the same facts. The same,\n                    however, cannot be said for the converse situation. Given the difference in the\n                    tests between remoteness in contract and tort, it is plausible that there may be\n                    a situation where a certain loss is too remote to be recovered under the\n                    judgment in contract, but not so under the judgment in tort. Fortunately, I am\n                    of the view that no such situation arises in the present case (for the reasons\n                    given below). In any event, I also note that the parties appear to be in\n                    agreement that the rules of remoteness in contract should govern and they have\n                    submitted on that basis with no reference to the rules in tort[note: 22]. I turn now to the application of the law to\n                    the facts. 75     Generally, courts have allowed a claimant to\n                    recover legal costs incurred as a result of a defendant’s breach, be it in\n                    contract or tort (see generallyMcGregor on\n                        Damages([16]supra) at paras 2-031 and 2-053). The cases cited\n                    by the defendants in respect of the legal costs of contesting the eviction\n                    (though distinguishable) (see[56]above)\n                    also show that legal costs incurred by a claimant in an earlier proceedings\n                    brought about by a defendant’s breach may be recoverable in law as\n                    damages. 76     Turning to the second set of legal costs of\n                    $2,091.29, I am of the view that the legal costs incurred on the Changi South\n                    premises are recoverable under the first limb of the rule inHadley. It would have been within the reasonable contemplation\n                    of both parties that the plaintiff would in the ordinary course of things have\n                    to incur another set of conveyancing fees if he had to give up the premises at\n                    Mintwell Building prematurely and to take up alternative premises for his\n                    business. Such damage would have flowed naturally from the defendants’\n                    breach. I note that the defendants have themselves acknowledged that such costs\n                    would not be too remote to be recoverable, having taken the position that the\n                    plaintiff is entitled to one tranche of legal fees in his search for alternative\n                    premises (see[56]above). 77     However, the same cannot be said for the legal\n                    costs incurred for the Tai Seng premises. I do not think it would have been\n                    within the contemplation of the parties that the plaintiff would actually incur\n                    more than one set of legal fees for title search/conveyancing. When they entered\n                    into the leases, neither party could have reasonably thought that the breach in\n                    the present case would have entitled the plaintiff to run checks on all\n                    alternative premises that he considered but has yet to make up his mind whether\n                    to take up or not and to recover all legal costs incurred in the process. Such\n                    legal costs would be too remote to be recoverable under the first limb of the\n                    rule inHadley. There are also no special\n                    circumstances that would justify the application of the second limb of the rule\n                    inHadleyin this case. The plaintiff should\n                    therefore recover no more than one set of legal costs for the alternative\n                    premises. Leaving aside disbursements, I note that the invoice rendered by the\n                    plaintiff’s solicitors unfortunately do not show the breakdown of the\n                    legal costs incurred in respect of the Tai Seng premises and the Changi South\n                    premises but only a general figure of $1,700 (without GST) for work done in\n                    relation to both premises[note: 23]. In\n                    these premises, I would only award the plaintiff half the amount claimed,ie, $1,045.65.",
        "Conclusion": "78     For all the reasons above, I award the\n                    plaintiff a total of $211,492.89 in damages, and the breakdown is as\n                    follows: (a)     $191,195.38 for expenses incurred\n                        for renovation works at the Changi South premises; (b)     $5,151.95 for labour costs for the\n                        plaintiff’s staff incurred in relation to the move to the Changi South\n                        premises; (c)     $14,099.91 for legal costs incurred for contesting the eviction in SUM\n                        3453/2006; and (d)     $1,045.65 for the title search/conveyancing fees for the lease of the\n                        Changi South premises. 79     I will hear the parties on the question of\n                    interest and costs.
