        "The facts": "The appellant, Tan Cheng\n\nKwee (‘Tan’), was the director in charge of Henry Transport & General Agency\n\nCompany Pte Ltd (‘the company’), and was the sole person running the operations\n\nof the company. The company transported goods in containers from warehouses to the Port of\n\nSingapore Authority (‘PSA’) Container Terminal, and vice-versa.2 The company owned two prime movers, one of which bore the licence\n\nplate number XA 6305 S (‘the prime mover’). At the material time, it had two\n\ndrivers under its employ – Selamat bin Sa’man (‘Selamat’) and Yahya\n\nbin Noordin (‘Yahya’).3 On 13 May 2000, Tan instructed Selamat to drive the prime mover to\n\nAdmiralty Road West in order to transport a container to the PSA Container Terminal. At\n\napproximately 12:12 p.m. that day, after loading up the container onto his trailer,\n\nSelamat was driving the prime mover along Hillview Road in the direction of Hillview\n\nAvenue when the top of the container hit a height restriction gantry. The vehicle\n\nproceeded on, but, due to its height, subsequently found itself wedged beneath the railway\n\nbridge that passed over the road. Selamat managed to free the vehicle. Whilst attempting\n\nto continue along its journey, the top of the container struck and damaged a second height\n\nrestriction gantry, causing it to tilt precariously to one side.4 The police arrived shortly and detained Selamat. Tan was called to\n\nthe scene. It was quickly discovered that the company did not possess the licence to\n\noperate a heavy motor vehicle that had an overall height exceeding four metres. The height\n\nof the prime mover with trailer and container was 4.465 metres. Tan appeared to be unaware\n\nthat such a permit was necessary and promptly applied for one on behalf of the company.\n\nHeight restriction permits are valid for one year and are issued free of charge.",
        "The charge": "5 Selamat was indicted on a number of charges. Unfortunately, he\n\nabsconded whilst on bail. Tan was later charged for the following offence:You,TAN CHENG KWEE, M/47 YRSNRIC NO. S0126513Zare charged that you on the 13thday of May 2000 in\n\n  Singapore, did cause to be driven on public roads, a heavy motor vehicle XA 6305 S that\n\n  has an overall height which exceeds 4 metres, without there being in force a permit from\n\n  Deputy Commissioner of Police and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under\n\n  section 79(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Cap. 2766 Section 79 of the Road Traffic Act (‘the Act’) read as\n\nfollows:79. – (1) Where the overall height of a heavy motor vehicle\n\n  exceeds 4 metres, any person who, without a permit from the Deputy Commissioner of Police,\n\n  is in charge of or drives or causes to be driven the vehicle on a road shall be guilty of\n\n  an offence and shall be liable on conviction –(a) for a first offence, to imprisonment for a term of not less than\n\n  one year and not more than 3 years and, in addition, to a fine not exceeding $2,000; and(b) for a second or subsequent offence, to imprisonment for a term of\n\n  not less than 2 years and not more than 5 years and, in addition, to a fine not exceeding\n\n  $5,000.",
        "Decision of the district court": "7 The district judge held that s 79 of the Act was intended to create a\n\nstrict liability offence. He was of the view that the presumption of law thatmens reawas a requirement of criminal liability was displaced by the fact that the provision was\n\nconcerned with an issue of social concern and public safety. It was important for vehicles\n\nbeyond a certain height to be restricted to travelling on certain roads due to height\n\nrestrictions on others. Strict liability was thus essential for the protection of the\n\npublic.8 As such, four elements had to be established in order for the\n\nprosecution to prove its case. These were:(a) That the prime mover was a ‘heavy motor vehicle’ within\n\n  the meaning of s 79 (1) of the Act;(b) That the overall height of the prime mover exceeded 4 metres;(c) That no permit was issued in respect of the prime mover;(d) That Tan had caused this prime mover to be driven on public roads\n\n  without such a permit.9 The judge found that all four elements were established. In his\n\nopinion, Tan had failed to make out a defence that he had taken reasonable care, since no\n\nattempt had been made by Tan to check the height of the container.10 The district judge found Tan guilty of the charge and sentenced him\n\nto 14 months’ imprisonment. He was also disqualified from holding or obtaining all\n\nclasses of driving licences for a period of one year with effect from Tan’s date of\n\nrelease from prison. Tan appealed against conviction and sentence but after hearing\n\ncounsel’s arguments I dismissed the appeal. The district judge, in his grounds of\n\ndecision, realised that he had omitted to impose a fine made mandatory by s 79(1)(a) of\n\nthe Road Traffic Act (RTA), and asked this Court to exercise its powers of revision in\n\norder to correct the error. I therefore imposed a fine of $1,000 on Tan. However, I\n\nrevoked that part of the district judge’s order relating to the disqualification from\n\nholding all classes of driving licences. The grounds for my decision are set out below.",
        "The appeal": "11 There were three key thrusts in the appeal against conviction. The\n\nfirst was that s 79(1) of the Act did not create a strict liability offence. The second\n\nwas that, in any event, there was no evidence that suggested that Tan knew that the prime\n\nmover exceeded four metres in height and therefore he did not ‘cause’ the\n\nvehicle to be unlawfully driven. The final point was that, even if s 79(1) of the Act did\n\ncreate a strict liability offence, Tan’s failure to know the facts that constituted\n\nunlawful user did not amount to negligence and that therefore the defence of reasonable\n\ncare was available to him.12 As for the appeal against sentence, the submission was that the term\n\nof 14 months’ imprisonment was manifestly excessive, and furthermore the judge seemed\n\nto have placed undue weight on the fact that Tan had chosen to claim trial.",
        "Did s 79(1) create a strict liability offence?": "13 There is a presumption of law thatmens reais a necessary\n\ningredient of any statutory provision that creates an offence:Sweet v Parsley[1970] AC 132;Lim Chin Aik v R[1963] MLJ 50;PP v Phua Keng Tong[1986] 2 MLJ 279. This presumption, however, can be rebutted by the clear language of the statute,\n\nor by necessary implication, although it is not sufficient if the provision merely lacks\n\nterms that are commonly associated withmens rea. Where an examination of the\n\nlanguage of the statute does not assist, the Court will have to look at all the relevant\n\ncircumstances to determine the true intention of Parliament. Such considerations include\n\nthe nature of the crime, the punishment prescribed, the absence of social obloquy, the\n\nparticular mischief and the field of activity in which the crime occurred.14 It is well known that the presumption ofmens reais often\n\ndisplaced in situations where the statutory offence in question pertains to issues of\n\nsocial concern. This is especially so in cases of public safety where the prohibited act\n\nis not one which the public can easily protect itself against through its own vigilance.\n\nInLim Chin Aik v R[1963] MLJ 50 at 52, Lord Evershed made the following\n\nobservation:Where the subject matter of the statute is the regulation for the\n\n  public welfare of a particular activity … it frequently has been inferred that the\n\n  legislature intended that such activities should be carried out under conditions of strict\n\n  liability. The presumption is that the statute or statutory instrument can be effectively\n\n  enforced only if those in charge of the relevant activities are made responsible for\n\n  seeing that they are complied with. When such a presumption is to be inferred, it\n\n  displaces the ordinary presumption of mens rea.15 Even then, it must be shown that the creation of strict liability\n\nwill be effective in promoting the objects of the statute by encouraging greater care to\n\nprevent the commission of the prohibited act:Gammon Ltd v AG of Hong Kong[1984] 3 WLR 437.16 The question as to whether s 79(1) of the Act was one that imposed\n\nstrict liability had been previously dealt with by the Magistrate’s Court in the case\n\nofPP v Yeo Gim LamTAC No. 844 of 1987 (unreported). In that case, the accused was\n\ncharged with driving a cargo crane, with an overall height exceeding four metres, without\n\nthe relevant licence. The boom of the loader had struck the underside of the Change Alley\n\naerial plaza that spanned Collyer Quay from Clifford Pier to the Singapore Rubber House.\n\nThe judge held that s 79(1) did create a strict liability offence. He said:It is easy to discern the legislative intent on placing upon a person\n\n  driving on the road a heavy motor vehicle which exceeds 4.00 metres, the duty of ensuring\n\n  that there is a permit from the Deputy Commissioner of Police. Under subsection 2 of\n\n  section 79 of the Act, in granting such a permit, the Deputy Commissioner of Police may\n\n  impose such conditions as he thinks fit including conditions relating to the overall\n\n  height of the vehicle, the lateral projection of any load carried by the vehicle, the\n\n  maximum speed of the vehicle, the requirement for police or other escort; and of\n\n  particular relevance to the present case, the route the vehicle is permitted to travel. In\n\n  land scarce Singapore, it is to be expected that there will be, and as a matter of fact\n\n  there are, numerous flyovers, pedestrian overhead bridges, aerial plazas and other similar\n\n  overhanging structures above the roads which the public uses frequently. It is very clear\n\n  promotion of safety. It performs the social utility of ensuring that drivers of heavy\n\n  motor vehicles above a certain height are in possession of and, more importantly, are\n\n  cognisant of the conditions imposed therein so that their vehicles would not pose a\n\n  potential hazard to these overhanging structures and endanger the lives of those using\n\n  them.17 It was patently clear to me that s 79(1) of the Act fell within that\n\nclass of statutory offences that dealt with public safety. Indeed, such was the tenor of\n\nthe speech by the then Minister of Home Affairs, Mr Chua Sian Chin, during the second\n\nreading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on 2 March 1984, at which the\n\nGovernment first sought to make it an offence for vehicles above the height of 3.2 metres\n\nto be driven without a licence. He said:It is clear that some drivers and owners of motor vehicles which carry\n\n  loads of excessive heights are not concerned with the dangers that they pose and the\n\n  damage that they could cause with their irresponsible behaviour. It is also evident that\n\n  the present penalties provided under out existing legislations are insufficient to deter\n\n  such behaviour. It was fortuitous and fortunate that no one was hurt in all the four\n\n  incidents I have recounted. However, we cannot rely on such good fortune and allow\n\n  pedestrians to be constantly exposed to such risks until somebody has been hurt … The\n\n  recklessness of some inconsiderate drivers and owners must be curbed without delay. It\n\n  would be too late to punish them after the harm is done. In view of grave danger to public\n\n  safety, it is necessary to provide for strict deterrent measures and heavy penalties to\n\n  prevent the occurrence of another incident of a vehicle with a high load hitting a\n\n  pedestrian overhead bridge.18 In pressing his case that s 79(1) of the Act was not to be construed\n\nas a strict liability offence, counsel for Tan argued that the district judge had failed\n\nto consider the significance of the mandatory minimum sentence of one year’s\n\nimprisonment. The severity of the penalty, he said, suggested that Parliament could not\n\nhave intended this to be a strict liability offence. In support of this proposition,\n\ncounsel relied on a passage inM V Balakrishnan v PP[1998] 1 CLAS News 357, a\n\njudgment of mine, which read:In his book, \"Public Welfare Offences\" … Professor Sayre\n\n  suggested that if the penalty is slight, involving, for instance, a fine, particularly if\n\n  adequate enforcement depends upon wholesale prosecution, or if the social danger arising\n\n  from violation is serious, the doctrine of basing liability upon mere activity rather than\n\n  fault is sound.19 The passage quoted above should not be misconstrued. The severity of\n\nthe penal sanction is but one of the many factors that the Court has to take into account\n\nin trying to ascertain Parliamentary intent. While a slight penalty may be a factor in\n\nfavour of construing an offence as one based on strict liability, there is by no means a\n\ndefinitive correlation. Parliament has the power to prescribe severe penalties for strict\n\nliability offences in order to achieve its legislative purpose. The speech of the then\n\nMinister for Home Affairs, parts of which have been reproduced in  17 above, revealed\n\nthat the legislature had strong deterrence on its mind following the numerous collisions\n\nthat had taken place, one after another, with pedestrian overhead bridges and aerial\n\nplazas in 1983 alone. In this regard, I found the approach taken by the Privy Council inGammon\n\nLtd v A-G of Hong Kong[1984] 3 WLR 437 very instructive. Defence counsel in that case\n\nhad advanced the argument that the severity of the maximum penalties prescribed in the\n\nprovision in question pointed away from a strict liability construction of s40(2A)(b) of\n\nthe Hong Kong Building Ordinance. Rejecting this, Lord Scarman remarked:… there is nothing inconsistent with the purpose of the Ordinance\n\n  in imposing severe penalties for offences of strict liability. The legislature could\n\n  reasonably have intended severity to be a significant deterrent, bearing in mind the risks\n\n  to public safety arising from some contraventions of the Ordinance.20 Counsel’s next argument was that s 79(1) of the Act should only\n\nhave been interpreted as a strict liability offence if that was a matter of necessary\n\nimplication. It was not the case if it could only be reasonably implied as such. He then\n\nreferred to the Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 1984 and pointed out\n\nthat the then Minister of Home Affairs had not explicitly indicated that a strict\n\nliability offence was intended. On the contrary, he had said that the \"recklessness\n\nof some inconsiderate drivers and owners must be curbed without delay\". This, argued\n\nCounsel, showed that knowledge of, or at least recklessness to, the fact of unlawful user\n\nwas a necessary ingredient of s 79(1) of the Act.21 While a provision should only be taken to impose strict liability if\n\nit was a matter of necessary implication from all the circumstances, I disagreed with the\n\nsubmission that knowledge or recklessness was a requisite ingredient of s 79(1). The aim\n\nof the legislation was to curb recklessness. It did not follow that the prosecution had to\n\nprove that an accused person had a mental element of recklessness or, for that matter, any\n\nother mens rea element. A strict liability reading would rigorously promote the intention\n\nof Parliament by encouraging, or coercing, drivers and owners of heavy motor vehicles to\n\nexercise a fair degree of care and consideration in their activities. On the contrary,\n\nimputing a state of mind as a necessity for every single element of the offence would not\n\nonly severely stultify the legislative purpose but would actually go against its very\n\ngrain. After all, drivers and owners of heavy motor vehicles with high loads risked\n\ncausing serious public harm if they did not positively take care. Harm might also be done\n\nif they were merely passive, knew nothing or were honestly mistaken about the facts and\n\ndid not know that they had to obtain the requisite licences that would immediately tell\n\nthem which roads were out of bounds to their vehicles. Therefore, it did not make sense\n\nthat a conviction should hinge on proof of positive knowledge or intention.22 In the result, I was of the firm opinion that s 79(1) of the Act did\n\ncreate a strict liability offence.",
        "Did Tan cause the prime mover to be driven on public roads?": "23 The district judge had noted in his grounds of decisionthat \"[t]he offence of ‘causing’ unlawful user requires\n\nproof ofmens reain knowledge of the facts rendering the user unlawful\".\n\nCounsel for Tan argued that the facts which Tan must be shown to have had knowledge of\n\nwere, firstly, that the overall height of the vehicle exceeded four metres, and secondly,\n\nthat there was no permit issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in respect of that\n\nprime mover. He then claimed that Tan did not possess such knowledge because he had not\n\nbeen told about the height of the container by the company that wanted the container\n\ntransported from Admiralty Road to the PSA Container Terminal.24 I was of the view that Counsel had misunderstood the district\n\njudge’s decision on this particular issue, which grounds read as follows:24 The offence of \"causing\" unlawful use requires proof ofmens\n\n  reain knowledge of the facts rendering the user unlawful. In the case of a limited\n\n  company, such knowledge had to be of someone exercising a directing mind over the\n\n  company’s affairs. (seeJames & Sons Ltd v Smee[1955] 1 QBD 78,Ross\n\n  Hillman Ltd v Bond[1974] RTR 279).25 \"To cause\", as pointed out by the defence, involves some\n\n  express or positive mandate from the person \"causing to the other person, or some\n\n  authority from the former to the latter arising in the circumstances of the case. (seeMcleod\n\n  v Buchanan[1940] 2 All ER 179). It has also been held in English cases that the term\n\n  \"to cause\" involves some degree of control and direction (seeShavner v\n\n  Rosner[1954] 2 All ER 280).26 In the instant case, it is clear that the accused had knowledge of\n\n  the facts rendering the user unlawful. In the statement of agreed facts, the accused has\n\n  admitted that he is a Director of Henry Transport was the sole person in charge of the\n\n  company’s motor container services. He has given evidence that it was him who had, on\n\n  13 May 2000 [see evidence-in-chief of the accused], instructed Selamat, an employee of the\n\n  company, via mobile radio, to proceed to Admiralty Road to pick up the container in order\n\n  to send it to the PSA Container Port.27 It is therefore clear that the accused knew of the facts rendering\n\n  the user unlawful. There is also no doubt that as the person in charge of the\n\n  company’s motor container services, he had some degree of control and direction over\n\n  Selamat, an employee of the company. I was thus of the opinion that the accused did cause\n\n  XA 6305S to be driven on a public road.25 It was obvious to me from a reading of the text above that the judge\n\nhad intended the knowledge of unlawful user to relateonlyto the fact that Tan\n\nknew that the prime mover was being driven on public roads and that he had control and\n\ndirection over that act. This was especially evident from  26, quoted above, where the\n\nonly evidence that the judge cited as proof of knowledge of unlawful user was (i.) that\n\nTan was the director solely in charge of the company, and (ii.) that Tan had given\n\ninstructions to his driver, Selamat, to pick up the container and send it to the PSA\n\nContainer Terminal. It was not necessary, and it certainly did not appear to be the\n\njudge’s intention, to require the prosecution to showfurtherthat Tan had\n\nknowledge that the vehicle exceeded four metres in height since the user was unlawful the\n\nmoment the actus reus of driving without the required permit took place.26 Having said that, it must also be pointed out that the citation of\n\nthe English cases ofRoss Hillman Ltd v Bond[1974] RTR 279andJames & Son Ltd v Smee[1955] 1 QB 78 in the district court’s grounds\n\nof decision as support for the proposition that \"[t]he offence of ‘causing’\n\nunlawful user requires proof ofmens reain knowledge of the facts rendering the\n\nuser unlawful\", may unfortunately have provided some inspiration for Counsel’s\n\npresent submission. These cases, however, appeared unhelpful to the present appeal in view\n\nof the policy considerations behind, as well as the present state of law relating to\n\nstrict liability offences in Singapore.27 InRoss Hillman Ltd v Bond[1974] RTR 279, s 40(5) of the UK\n\nRoad Traffic Act 1972 provided that \"a person … (b) who uses on a road a motor\n\nvehicle … which does not comply with any such regulations orcausesor\n\npermits a vehicle to be so used, shall be guilty of an offence\" [emphasis added]. The\n\ndefendant, a company owning vehicles, had explicitly warned the drivers under its employ,\n\nvia notices in their pay packets and signs displayed at its premises, to be careful not to\n\noverload their vehicles in breach of regulation 121 of the Motor Vehicles (Construction\n\nand Use) Regulations 1969. That regulation prohibited the overloading of vehicles beyond\n\nthat stipulated in the certificate issued to specific vehicles. Notwithstanding the\n\nwarning, one of the defendant’s drivers in the course of his employment took an\n\nunloaded lorry out of the premises and overloaded it. The defendant was charged for\n\ncausing a breach of the regulation. Distinguishing the earlier case ofSopp v Long[1969] 1 All ER 855, May J, giving the main judgment of the Court of Appeal, held that in\n\norder to prove that one had \"caused\" an absolute liability offence to be\n\ncommitted, the prosecution would have to prove themens reaof knowledge of the\n\nfacts thatrenderedthe user unlawful. The defendant was thus acquitted because it\n\ndid not know that its employee had filled the vehicle beyond the maximum prescribed load;\n\nit had also explicitly forbidden such overloading. Therefore, the defendant did not\n\n\"cause\" the primary offence to take place.28 The first observation to be made about this case was that the common\n\nlaw defence of due diligence or reasonable care, as enunciated in the Canadian case ofR\n\nv City of Sault Ste Marie(1978) 85 DLR (3d) 161and adopted\n\nin our jurisdiction by the case ofM V Balakrishnan v PP[1998] 1 CLAS News 357,\n\nwas not a concept available to the English Court of Appeal at that time. This was unlike\n\nthe factual matrix inSopp v Long[1969] 1 All ER 855, where the defendant employer\n\nhad the benefit of statutory exceptions in the UK Weights and Measures Act 1963 to the\n\noffence of ‘causing’ a contravention of the Act. These exceptions to liability\n\nrequired the defendant to prove that he had taken all reasonable precautions and exercised\n\nall diligence to prevent his employee from committing the offence. The court inRoss\n\nHillman’scase, on the other hand, was confronted with the situation where the\n\ndefendant had explicitly warned its employees against committing the offence and done\n\neverything in its power to prevent breaches from occurring. To have convicted the\n\ndefendant under such circumstances would have invoked the spectre that Devlin J (as he\n\nthen was) had raised inReynolds v G H Austin & Sons Ltd[1951] 2 KB 135 at\n\n149, where he said:[I]f a man is punished because of an act done by another, whom he\n\n  cannot reasonably be expected to influence or control, the law is engaged, not in\n\n  punishing thoughtlessness or inefficiency, but in pouncing on the most convenient victim.29 The second observation aboutRoss Hillman’scase was\n\nthat it created an absolute liability offence of unlawful user for which proof ofmens\n\nreawas unnecessary, and a diagrammatically-opposite offence of causing unlawful user\n\nthat was a ‘true criminal offence’ requiring proof of fullmens rea,\n\namongst the various limbs of a single statutory provision. In our jurisdiction, however,\n\nit is now recognised that strict liability occupies the position of a halfway-house\n\nbetween absolute liability and true criminal liability, in the sense that strict liability\n\nis made out on proof ofactus reusbut a defence of reasonable care is open to the\n\naccused:M V Balakrishnan v PP[1998] 1 CLAS News 357. With regard to the word\n\n\"cause\" in relation to strict liability offences, Dickson J gave the following\n\ninstructive comments in the judgment ofR v City of Sault Ste Marie(1978) 85 DLR\n\n(3d) 161:The present case concerns the interpretation of two troublesome words\n\n  frequently found in public welfare statutes: \"cause\" and \"permit\".\n\n  These two words are troublesome because neither denotes clearly either fullmens reanor absolute liability. It is said that a person could not be said to be permitting\n\n  something unless he knew what he was permitting. This is an over-simplification. There is\n\n  authority both ways, indicating that the Courts are uneasy with the traditional dichotomy.\n\n  Some authorities favour the position that \"permit\" does not importmens rea:\n\n  seeMillar v The Queen(1954) 1 DLR 148;R v Royal Canadian Legion(1971) 21\n\n  DLR (3d);R v Teperman & Sons Ltd[1968] 4 CCC 67… For amens reaconstruction\n\n  seeJames & Son Ltd v Smee, [1955] 1 QB 78;Somerset v Hart(1884), 12\n\n  QBC 360 … The same is true of \"cause\". For a non-mens reaconstruction, seeR v Peconi(1907), 1 CCC (2d) 213;Alphacell Ltd v Woodward,\n\n  [1972] AC 824;Sopp v Long, [1969] 1 All ER 855;Laird v Dobell, [1906] 1 KB\n\n  131;Korten v West Sussex County Council, supra;Shave v Rosner, [1954] 2   WLR 1057. Others say that \"cause\" imports a requirement for amens rea:\n\n  seeLovelace v DPP, [1954] 3 All ER 481;Ross Hillman Ltd v Bond, [1974] 2   All ER 287; Smith and Hogan,Criminal Law, pp 89-90…The conflict in the above authorities, however, shows that in\n\n  themselves the words \"cause\" and \"permit\" fit much better into an\n\n  offence of strict liability than either fullmens reaor absolute liability …Proof of the prohibited actprima facieimports the offence, but\n\n  the accused may avoid liability by proving that he took reasonable care.30 As a final point, Counsel’s proposed approach to proving that\n\none had ‘caused’ unlawful user, in the context of s 79(1) as a strict liability\n\noffence, did not make sense in light of the approach taken towards proving unlawful user\n\nitself. A person who drove a motor vehicle that exceeded four metres in height without\n\npossessing the requisite permit commits the strict liability offence whether or not he was\n\naware of the actual height of the vehicle, unless of course he could show that all due\n\ncare had already been taken. How could it be, then, that a person who ‘caused’\n\nthat same motor vehicle to be driven on the road without the permit could get away by\n\nproving that he did not know about the height of the vehicle? I could see no rational\n\nbasis for allowing such inconsistency in approach. As far as s 79(1) of the Act was\n\nconcerned, Parliament’s intention was to cast the burden of taking care, not only on\n\nthe drivers of heavy motor vehicles, but also on the owners of these vehicles.31 To reiterate, when a strict liability offence involved\n\n\"causing\" an act that was in itself unlawful, all the prosecution needed to\n\nestablish was the causal link, oractus reus. This involved showing that the\n\naccused had some form of control, direction and mandate over the person doing the unlawful\n\nact proper which the accused had exercised:Shavner v Rosner[1954] 2 All ER 280;Mcleod\n\nv Buchanan[1940] 2 All ER 179. Once this was proved, it would then become incumbent\n\non the defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that it had taken all reasonable\n\ncare.",
        "Had Tan exercised reasonable care?": "32 Counsel for Tan submitted that, even if s 79(1) of the Act did\n\ncreate a strict liability offence, which I ruled that it did, his client had nonetheless\n\nexercised reasonable care and was therefore entitled on that defence to an acquittal. That\n\nthere was no unreasonable failure to know the facts that constituted the offence rested on\n\nthe following points raised by Counsel:(a) In the 1980’s, PSA required road traffic permits for\n\n  containers entering the PSA Container Terminal. It had since ceased enforcing such a\n\n  requirement and therefore Tan’s company had stopped applying for such permits;(b) In 1999, one of the company’s prime movers carrying a load of\n\n  the same proportions was stopped, and the company charged for exceeding vehicular weight\n\n  restrictions. The company was not prosecuted for failing to possess a height permit;(c) Tan had only begun to oversee the company’s business shortly\n\n  before the incident that led to the charge, when his father’s health declined. After\n\n  taking over, Tan had merely carried on the practice of not applying for permits;(d) The company did not deal with over-heights, which were situations\n\n  where goods extended out of standard containers. Tan knew that these required permits and\n\n  he would let other companies do the job instead;(e) Tan’s friends had told him that no permit was required for\n\n  standard containers such as the one that was involved in the present incident;(f) The container in question did not belong to Tan’s company and\n\n  Tan did not have the opportunity to see the container for himself.33 Regrettably, none of the reasons put forward could even come close\n\nto showing that Tan had exercised reasonable care. Tan was effectively the managing\n\ndirector of a company whose primary business was the provision of transport services for\n\ncontainerised cargo. He has had some 25 years’ experience in the industry. It was\n\nTan’s evidence that containers came in standard sizes, and he had applied for height\n\npermits from PSA in the past. As a matter of fact, Tan claimed to be rather ignorant of\n\nthe laws governing vehicular height limits. This was also not a situation where he had\n\ncircumscribed the nature of his business by limiting the size of containers that he would\n\naccept; neither did he expressly warn his drivers not to accept certain jobs nor ask his\n\nclients about the size of their containers.",
        "Appeal against sentence": "34 When deciding on a suitable penalty to be imposed, the Court should\n\nnot take into account the fact that an accused person had chosen to claim trial instead of\n\npleading guilty. However, taking into account the culpability of Tan’s conduct, I was\n\nunable to accept Counsel’s submission that the sentence of 14 months’\n\nimprisonment in this instance was manifestly excessive. The district judge had noted that\n\n\"the accused failed to take reasonable care, if at all, to ensure that the vehicle\n\ndriven by Selamat had a permit … No attempt was made by the accused to check or\n\nconfirm the height of the container.\" Furthermore, Tan’s neglect had indirectly\n\ncaused damage to public structures. A catastrophe could have resulted when his prime mover\n\nstruck the railway bridge.35 The sentence of imprisonment aside, I quashed the order of the\n\ndistrict court disqualifying Tan from holding all classes of driving licence for 12\n\nmonths. From the grounds of decision, it was apparent that the court had assumed that such\n\ndisqualification was mandatory by virtue of s 79(4) of the Act, which stated that\n\n\"the driver or person in charge of a heavy motor vehicle convicted of an offence\n\nunder subsection (1) or (3) shall, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to\n\norder otherwise and without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period\n\nof disqualification – (a) in the case of a first offence, be disqualified from\n\nholding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than one year.\" From\n\nthe face of this provision, it was clear to me that the mandatory disqualification did not\n\napply to a charge of \"causing\" the unlawful user. A power to order\n\ndisqualification exists under s 42 of the Act but this is a discretionary power.36 Section 79(1)(a) of the Act made a fine of not more than $2,000\n\nmandatory upon conviction. As the district court had omitted to impose this sentence, I\n\nexercised this Court’s power of revision to impose a fine of $1,000.",
        "Conclusion": "37 Having assessed the case in its entirety, I was of the opinion that\n\nthere was no merit in the appeal against conviction. Save for the imposition of the $1,000\n\nmandatory fine and the quashing of the disqualification order, I also dismissed the appeal\n\nagainst sentence.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWCHIEF JUSTICECopyright © Government of Singapore."
