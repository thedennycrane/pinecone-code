        "irrelevant matters": "flawedUnder this head, Mr Pereira raised three separate matters:(1) That the IC was wrong in refusing to consider the complaint that Anthony Lee had misled the court in the course of the hearing of OS 739/96 and OS 740/96 by leading the judge to believe that no valuation had been done by Knight Frank when in fact Anthony Lee had with him the valuation report (ie the IC was wrong in refusing to inquire into the `additional complaint`).(2) The IC took into consideration , namely, the complainants` suit against Lydia Sng and others for conspiracy and the suit by the complainants against Anthony Lee in Suit 1034/99.(3) The legal reasoning in the IC report was  when they held that even if Anthony Lee disclosed the act of part-performance the judge hearing OS 739/96 and OS 740/96 would still have ruled in favour of the complainants.IC was wrong in not hearing the additional complaintThe IC had ruled (see [para ]17 above) that as the complaint that Anthony Lee misled the court about the existence of the Knight Frank valuation reports was not to be found in the formal complaints or other documents that up to that part of time had been lodged by the complainants, the IC would not look into it. Looking at the  documentation before the IC when that ruling was made, there was indeed no such complaint.The IC could, if it was so minded, have broadened the scope of its inquiry to include the additional complaint. There is, in fact, specific provision in the Legal Profession Act enabling an IC to do so [see s 86(8)]. But whether an IC should embark on an additional inquiry is a matter that is at the discretion of the IC. So long as that discretion was exercised judicially, it cannot be faulted. In the absence of the IC misguiding itself in some way, it would be wrong for this court to substitute its discretion for the discretion of the IC.Mr Pereira submitted, and I could see the logic of that submission, that the additional complaint was so connected with the other complaints that it could have been conveniently dealt with by the IC. Convenience, however, is only one factor that the IC has to bear in mind in deciding whether to exercise its discretion. A more pertinent factor would be fairness to the solicitor complained against. To formulate an additional complaint, for the first time, on the day scheduled for the hearing would be unfair to that solicitor. Natural justice would require that the solicitor have sufficient notice of the additional complaint before the date of the hearing. Of course, the IC could have adjourned its hearing to give Anthony Lee the required time, but, given the desirability of dealing with complaints expeditiously and the tight time constraints within which an IC is expected (under the Legal Profession Act) to complete its report, an IC may well be reluctant to entertain additional complaints raised at the last minute. There can, however, be no hard and fast rule. Each case must depend on its own facts. I could not, on the evidence before me, categorise the decision of the IC in this case not to inquire into the additional complaint as a wrongful exercise of discretion.There was one further difficulty. The IC had declined to inquire into the additional complaint. That being so, Anthony Lee did not have any opportunity to address the IC (or this court for that matter) on the merits of that additional complaint. In those circumstances, if I were to grant the complainants the order they sought in this application, (ie direct the Law Society to apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of a disciplinary committee to hear charges that would encompass the additional complaint), the effect would be that a disciplinary committee would be convened to hear the additional complaint without Anthony Lee having had the opportunity, accorded to him under the Legal Professional Act, of having the complaint looked into by an Inquiry Committee. In this regard, the comments of Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) inWee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore[1988] SLR 510[1988] 3 MLJ 9at 12 were pertinent:The statutory scheme gives the advocate and solicitor concerned a right to be judged first by his own peers, ie the inquiry committee, followed by a determination by the Council, before the complaint can be brought by a dissatisfied complainant before a judge. Section 93(4) should not be construed in such a manner as to deprive the advocate and solicitor concerned of these rights. In my view, a judge has no jurisdiction to inquire into any complaint which has not been inquired into by the inquiry committee or where the Council has not made a determination on the basis of such an inquiry.The plaintiff has available to him other remedies against a defaulting inquiry committee or Council, eg an order of mandamus against the inquiry committee or the  Council (seeRe An Advocate & Solicitor[1987] 2 MLJ 21) or an declaratory order (seeP Suppiah v Law Society of Singapore[1986] 1 MLJ 459). [Emphasis is added.]I adopted the views expressed by the learned judicial commissioner. Where a complaint has not been inquired into by the IC it is not open for the court, in an application under s 96(1), to grant an order under s 96(4)(b) in respect of that complaint.Mr Pereira raised a further issue relating to the additional complaint. It was that in his letter to the IC of 24 April 2000 TYL had submitted information on, inter alia, matters relating to the additional complaint. Mr Pereira submitted that it was incumbent on the Council of the Law Society to have considered this information before adopting the IC`s report. Mr Pereira pointed out that although the Law Society had informed TYL that that letter had been forwarded by the IC to the Council, there was no indication that the Council, before adopting the report of the IC, had considered the letter. Mr Pereira submitted that had the Council considered the letter the Council could, in view of the new evidence in that letter, have invoked the provision of s 87(1)(d) of the Legal Profession Act, and referred the matter back to the IC for re-consideration or a further report. The Council, he submitted, had merely `rubber-stamped` the IC`s report instead of `determining` that a formal investigation was not necessary.The IC in its report to the Council had very clearly set out the fact that it had not inquired into the additional complaint as there was no reference to that complaint in the documentation before the IC. The Council, when it adopted the recommendations of the IC, was therefore fully cognizant of this fact. TYL`s letter of 24 April 2000 which included new evidence relating to the additional complaint had been forwarded to the Council before it adopted the report. The submission by Mr Pereira that the Council did not consider that letter before adopting the report appears to be mere speculation. In any event, there was no obligation on the Council for it to consider any further representations from the complainants before it adopted the recommendations of the IC.In adopting the report, the Council was, even if it did not expressly say so, also adopting the decision of the IC not to inquire into the additional complaint. In the context of the submissions made by Mr Pereira, the following passage in the decision of the Court of Appeal inWhitehouse Holdings v Law Society of Singapore[1994] 2 SLR 476at 484G would be relevant:... we are unable to agree that the Council by merely accepting and adopting the report had not made a determination. We cannot see any objection to this practice. The Council need not supplement the reasons given by the inquiry committee in its report, when the Council in effect is in agreement with and accepts the findings of the inquiry committee and makes a determination consistent with that in the report. The Council had clearly determined that no formal investigation was necessary and that there was therefore no ambiguity at all.I agree with Mr Pereira that the Council had powers to refer the matter back to the IC for re-consideration but I cannot agree that the failure of the Council to do so amounted to an error in law. I would add that, even if it was such an error, it is not open to me for the reasons given in [para ]30 above, to grant an order under s 96(4)(b) on account of that error.",
        "Irrelevant matters considered": "The IC, in its report, referred to the fact that Lydia Sng of Knight Frank (who testified that the valuation reports, although prepared earlier, had only been forwarded to Bih Li & Lee on 1 August 1996) had, without prompting, volunteered information that she was sued by the complainants for conspiracy. The report also made reference to Anthony Lee having told the IC that he was sued by the complainants in Suit 1035/99 but had on 9 October 1999 successfully applied to have the claim struck out.TYK, in a lengthy affidavit filed on 25 October 2000, asserted that Lydia Sng and Anthony Lee`s motive in referring to these suits was to show that the complainants were vindictive and vengeful so that the members of the IC would think less of the complainants. Mr Pereira, in his submissions, referred the court to the paragraphs in his client`s affidavit deposing to those assertions. Mr Pereira also drew my attention to para 49 of the said affidavit where his client (TYK) stated:Similarly, Anthony Lee failed to explain adequately, if at all, that the Applicants agreed to withdraw the Suit 1034 of 1999 and settle the suit on a `drop hands` basis after the Honourable Justice Tan Lee Meng`s persuasion to the 1st Applicant to pursue his cause by way of disciplinary proceedings in the Law Society.Mr Pereira did not elaborate any further on the merits of TYK`s criticism of the IC and rested his submissions on the position adopted by his client in that affidavit.I was unable to agree with TYK that evidence relating to the fact that action was commenced by the complainants against Lydia Sng and Anthony Lee and the status of those actions were irrelevant to the proceedings before the IC. These actions were, after all, events closely connected to the subject matter of the complaint. In any event, TYK`s fear that the IC may have been prejudiced against him and TYL by this evidence appears to be completely unfounded. Reading the report of the IC, it seems to me (although the IC did not expressly say so) that the reason the IC adverted to this evidence was to remind itself that Lydia Sng might be a tainted witness whose evidence might be motivated by self-interest since she was also a party sued by the complainants. The existence and status of those actions were relevant to the IC in assessing the credibility of Lydia Sng. It was, in my view, entirely proper for the IC to be told that Lydia Sng and Anthony Lee had been sued by the complainants and for the IC to take note of that.",
        "Flaw in the legal reasoning": "The IC in its report took note that the contents of the letters exchanged between Bih Li & Lee and Lee Bon Leong & Co from January to March 1996 showed that the complainants were aware that Knight Frank had been appointed to do the valuation. The IC also took note of the fact that Lee Mun Hooi had, in effect, told Rubin J (at the commencement of the hearing) that there was no dispute between the parties that the Yeow Tat faction had appointed Knight Frank to do the valuation. The IC, in that context, adverted to what Michael Khoo SC  had said in his opening statement and to what the issues before Rubin J were. It would be helpful to set out what the IC said:28. Whatever Mr Michael Khoo SC might have thought, a close reading of Rubin J`s judgement shows that there is no reference whatsoever to part performance on the part of the Defendant being an issue: see the learned Judge`s careful summary of the rival submissions of counsel at paragraphs 14 to 17 of his judgment and at paragraph 38 where there is this reference:`... Having considered all the arguments and having regardto the steps taken by both parties, particularly when the plaintiffs had executed part of their obligations with regard to the valuation of the immovable properties as well as making certain payments to Guek Tin and Yeow Tat, I was of the view ...` [Emphasis is added.]The issue whether the defendants had instructed valuers as part performance of their obligations under the settlement agreement played no part in the learned Judge`s reasoning in coming to his decision. The main thrust of his judgement centered around the construction of the 28 November 1995 letter, whether that could be construed as a valid and binding agreement or evidence of a valid and binding agreement and whether he had the power to order specific performance when it came to appointing some expert or valuer to do the adjustments to the audited book price of the companies.29. Mr Yang also submitted that if AL had been forthright with the court and disclosed that positive steps taken by the defendants in part performance of their obligations it would have put a `very different complexion` in the way that the judge decided the case. However this Inquiry Committee cannot agree for the reasons set out above and cannot see how differently the judge would have decided the case.TYK, in his affidavit, refers to this approach by the IC as flawed. At para 51 he stated:With due respect, I am advised and verily believe that this reasoning is flawed. Clearly, it is Anthony Lee and his client`s case that his letter dated 28 November 1995 did not constitute a binding agreement. Had Anthony Lee revealed that he had personally part performed the letter agreement by engaging Knight Frank, surely it would have weakened his client`s case substantially since it evidenced an intention to create a binding legal relationship between the parties therein. The parties would then reassess their respective merits in their case and thereby resulting in a less lengthy and acrimonious litigation.Mr Pereira adopted the arguments of TYK as stated in para 51.The main issue that Rubin J had to decide was whether or not the letter of 28 November 1995 constituted a binding agreement between the parties. Part-performance by the parties could be evidence that the letter reflected a binding agreement. In reaching the conclusion that there was a binding agreement, Rubin J stated that he had regard to `the steps taken by both parties` and particularised the fact that the complainants had appointed Richard Ellis as one of these steps. The fact that Rubin J did not particularise the fact that the Yeow Tat faction had appointed Knight Frank does not take the complainants` case any further. In view of the fact that that was an agreed fact between the parties, Rubin J may well, if he had been so minded, have recited that as another step that had been taken by the parties. I could not therefore see why TYK in his affidavit categorises the reasoning of the IC in this regard as flawed.The IC was, in my view, quite justified in taking the view that Lee Mun Hooi`s opening statement that it was not in dispute that Knight Frank had been appointed (by the Yeow Tat faction) to carry out the valuation reflected accurately the position of the parties at the hearing before Rubin J and that Michael Khoo SC`s contrary statement did not reflect the true position. I might add that if the complainants intended to seriously pursue their argument that reliance should be placed not on what Lee Mun Hooi told Rubin J but on what Michael Khoo SC said, it would not have been inappropriate for the complainants to have filed, in these proceedings, affidavits from Lee Mun Hooi and Michael Khoo SC to that effect. No such affidavits were filed.",
        "Errors of fact": "The role of a court in hearing an application such as this is well-settled. Chan Sek Keong JC in the case ofWee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singaporequoted above, enunciated it as follows (at p 514I):In my view, s 93(4) does not vest in a judge an original jurisdiction to hear a complaint against an advocate and solicitor. Section 93(4) does not contemplate such a hearing. His jurisdiction is supervisory or appellate in nature.It is accepted law that in exercising jurisdiction of a supervisory or appellate nature the court `should be slow to disturb or interfere with the findings of fact by the inquiry committee unless it can be shown that supporting evidence was lacking or there was some misunderstanding of the evidence or there are other exceptional circumstances justifying the court to do so` (seeWhitehouse Holdings, supra at p 487G-H).TYK, in his affidavit filed on 25 October 2000, made an impassioned and lengthy submission in which he complains (from paras 62-117) about numerous matters which he considers to be errors of fact by the IC. Mr Pereira, in his submissions, did not seek to elaborate on anything that TYK had stated. With due respect to whoever drafted the affidavit for TYK to sign, I would point out that it is not appropriate for solicitors to draft affidavits in which they make their clients depose to legal submissions. Doing that makes an affidavit protracted and unwieldly and detracts from its primary purpose which is to put the facts before the court. But, be that as it may, it did not appear to me, on a perusal of the submissions contained in the affidavit of TYK, that it could be said in respect of any one of the numerous matters TYK complained about, that the IC misdirected itself or erred in arriving at the conclusion it did. It would therefore not be appropriate for me to interfere with the findings of fact made by the IC.I agreed with the submission of Mr Daniel John, who appeared for the Law Society, that the complainants` real grievance stems from the fact that although Anthony Lee was the author of the `letter agreement` dated 25 November 1995, he nevertheless forcefully advanced the argument in court that there was no concluded agreement between the parties. The complainants view this conduct of Anthony Lee as all the more improper because Anthony Lee, in appointing Knight Frank to do the valuation, had himself part-performed the agreement and therefore, from their point of view, Anthony Lee could not honestly have believed in the arguments he made to the court. The complainants  considered that in making those arguments and in drafting what the complainants considered to be false affidavits for his clients to sign, Anthony Lee was assisting his clients to advance a false case in court.I agreed with Mr Daniel John that, in taking the above view, the complainants had failed to appreciate that Anthony Lee was merely acting as his clients` mouthpiece. So long as his clients were of the view that there was no concluded agreement and so long as that was a view that could be properly placed before the court, it was Anthony Lee`s duty to argue his clients` case as best he could. And if, in doing so, Anthony Lee did not intentionally mislead the court, he was acting properly as an advocate. Although some of the affidavits filed in the two originating summons could have been better drafted, I saw no reason to disagree with the findings of the IC that, on the matters that they inquired into, Anthony Lee had not conducted himself improperly.For the above reasons that I dismissed with costs the application by the complainants under this originating summons.Outcome:Application dismissed.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
