        "The facts leading to the application": "2       The\napplicant is a company in the business of property development. It\nis currently the lessee of adjoining plots of land identified as\nLot Nos 1338M TS 17 (“Lot 1338M”) and 2818V TS 17 (“Lot 2818V”)\n(collectively referred to as “the Land”). 3       The\napplicant acquired Lots 1338M and 2818V on 15 January 2010 and 25\nMarch 2010 respectively through competitive tenders for the purpose\nof redevelopment. The SLA’s consent for the sale of both lots was needed\nand this was duly obtained. 4       The\nlease documents for both lots contained two references to the payment\nof a differential premium. The first, which will henceforth be referred\nto as the DP Clause, states thus: The demised land shall not be used for\nother than the abovementioned development except with the prior\npermission of the Lessor. The lessee shall be required to pay a\ndifferential premium, as appropriate, in respect of any increase\nin floor area or change of use from a lower use category to higher\nuse category from the existing use which will result in an enhanced\nvalue. The second clause, henceforth referred to as the Land Return\nClause, reads: The Lessee shall notify the Lessor in writing\nof such portions of the demised land which are not used for the\npurposes specified. If directed by the Lessor, the Lessee shall\nsurrender to the Lessor such land not used for the purposes specified\nat rates equivalent to the compensation payable for such land if\nit had been acquired under the Land Acquisition Act on the date\nof the direction. Provided that if the Lessor does not issue\na direction for the surrender of such land within 1 year from the\nsaid notification by the Lessee under this clause or within such\nother period as may otherwise be mutually agreed between the Lessor\nand the Lessee, the Lessor shall, at the request of the Lessee,\nlift the restrictions in the Lease under [the DP Clause] in relation\nonly to such land; subject to the Lessee obtaining the necessary\napprovals from the relevant authorities regarding the proposed use\nof such lands and the payment of a differential premium under [the\nDP Clause]. 5       Generally,\nstate land is sold at a price based on the proposed use and intensity\nat the time of sale. State leases usually specify, as a condition\nin the lease, the permissible use of the land under the lease and\nthe maximum gross floor area for the said permissible use. This\nensures that the land is used in line with prevailing land policy,\nas evinced in the Master Plan (which is the statutory land use plan\nguiding Singapore’s development in the medium term over the next\n10 to 15 years). The Master Plan shows the permissible land use\nand intensity for developments in Singapore. Each parcel of land\nis zoned for different categories of land use, which include commercial,\nresidential and industrial use. Thus, state leases generally include\na DP clause which stipulates that a DP shall be payable if there\nis a change in the use or an increase in the intensity of use beyond\nthe permissible amount. 6       The\nSLA published two circulars and maintained a website to provide the\npublic with information on how the payable DP is computed. The material\nportions of the first circular, which was published sometime in 2000\n(“the 2000 SLA Circular”), stated (with “PP” meaning Provisional Planning\nPermission): 1.    With\neffect from 31 July 2000, the Singapore Land Authority has implemented\na transparent system of determination of differential premium (DP)\nfor the lifting of State title restrictions involving change of\nuse and/or increase in intensity. This is to encourage optimisation\nof land use and to facilitate the overall pace of redevelopment\nin Singapore. It will also provide greater certainty to landowners\nwho will now be able to compute the DP payable themselves. 2.    The determination of DP will be based\non the published Table of Development Charge (DC) rates. … … 4.    Where\nthe use as spelt out in a particular title restriction does not\nfit into any of the Use Groups in the Table of DC Rates, the DP\npayable will be determined by the Chief Valuer on a case-by-case\nbasis. … 6.    As\nthe material date for determination of DP is pegged to the PP date, all\napplications for lifting of title restriction must have a valid\nPP. Applications without a valid PP will be rejected. The Singapore\nLand Authority reserves the discretion on whether to grant an application\nfor lifting of title restriction and/or topping up of lease in accordance\nwith its policies. … 8.    The\nnew system for determining DP does not apply to the computation of\npremium payable for the upgrading of lease tenure (i.e. the topping-up\nof lease tenure). Such premium will still be assessed by the Chief\nValuer on a case-by-case basis. 9.    If you have any queries concerning\nthis circular, please feel free to contact us at SLA. We will be\npleased to answer queries on this matter. 7       The\nsecond circular, published sometime in 2007 (“the 2007 SLA Circular”),\nis substantially similar to the 2000 SLA Circular: 1.    With\neffect from 18 July 2007, in line with the revision of the Development\nCharge (DC) system whereby Government will peg the amount of DC\nbased on 70% of the enhancement in land value, the differential premium\n(DP) system will similarly be adjusted for the lifting of State\ntitle restrictions involving change of use and/or increase in intensity. 2.    The determination of DP will still\nbe based on the published Table of Development Charge (DC) rates.\nThe material date of determination of DP will be pegged to the date\nof Provisional Planning Permission (PP) or the start date of the\nvalidity of the second and subsequent PP extensions, similar to\nDC. The prevailing Table of DC rates at the grant of PP will be\nused. … 4.    Where\nthe use as spelt out in a particular title restriction does not\nfit into any of the Use Groups in the Table of DC Rates, the DP\npayable will be determined by the Chief Valuer on a case-by-case\nbasis. 5.    As the material date for determination\nof DP is pegged to the PP date, all applications for lifting of\ntitle restriction must have a valid PP. Applications without a valid\nPP will be rejected. The Singapore Land Authority reserves the right\non whether to grant an application for lifting of title restriction\nin accordance with its prevailing policies. … 7.    The\nbasis of charging 50% of the full value for remnant State land will remained\nunchanged notwithstanding the revision of the Development Charge\n(DC) system and correspondingly, the Table of DC Rates. Accordingly,\nSLA will apply a factor of 5/7 to the new revised Table of DC Rates\n(i.e. Table of DC Rate x 5/7 x size of remnant State land x plot\nratio) when computing the premium for remnant State land. 8.    If you have any queries concerning\nthis circular, please feel free to contact us at SLA. We will be\npleased to answer queries on this matter. 8       The\nmaterial portions of the SLA website (as assessed on 20 January 2011)\nare reproduced below: … Differential Premium A payment, known as differential premium\n(DP), will be charged for lifting the title restriction. The DP\nis the difference in value between the use and/or intensity stated\nin the State title and the approved use and/or intensity in the provisional\nplanning permission. DP is computed based on the Development\nCharge (DC) Table of Rates. The material date of determination of\nDP is pegged to the date of Provisional Permission (PP) or the date\nof the second and subsequent PP extensions. … Where the use stipulated in the title restriction\ndoes not fit into any of the Use Groups in the DC Table, the DP\npayable will be determined by the Chief Valuer on a case-by-case\nbasis. … Option for Spot Valuation Landowners/developers who are not satisfied\nwith the differential premium (DP) payable based on the Development\nCharge (DC) Table of Rates can write in to SLA to appeal against\nthe differential premium amount. SLA will then consult Chief Valuer\n(CV) for a spot valuation. … If the new DP payable upon appeal turns\nout to be higher than the initial DP based on the DC Table of Rates,\nthe appellant is not allowed to fall back on the initial DP amount. If the appellant is still not satisfied\nwith Chief Valuer’s spot valuation, another appeal can be made.\nHowever, before the second appeal is processed, the appellant must\npay up the DP (based on CV’s valuation) first and an appeal fee\nof $10,000. If the revised DP on the second appeal is lower than\nthe first appeal, the excess amount collected will be returned. 9       The\nSLA website had a section entitled “Terms of Use”. Two clauses are\nrelevant to this application: 1. … By accessing and using any part of\nthis Site, you shall be deemed to have accepted, and agreed to be\nbound by, these Terms of Use. … Disclaimer of Warranties and Liability 8.

[emphasis added] 10     The\nfirst affidavit of Thong Wai Lin, the Director of the Land Sales and\nAcquisition Division of the SLA, explains (at [27], [86] and [87])\nhow the Table of Development Charge rates are determined. The DC\nTable is split across different categories of land use and different\ngeographical sector areas in Singapore. There is a specific rate\nfor each category of land use in each particular sector area. The\nrates are revised half-yearly in March and September. The rates\nare not spot valuations but are based on past transactional prices\nof a preceding six-month period and on the average of such prices\nin a particular sector area. As the DC Table is a snapshot of rates determined\nin advance, the DC Table does not necessarily reflect the actual prevailing\nvalue of land. In a rising market, the DC Table’s rates would be lower\nthan spot valuations. In contrast, a spot valuation assesses the\nactual value of a piece of land at the time of assessment. A plot\nof land located in a more desirable location may have a much higher\nvalue than another plot of land in the same sector. The Chief Valuer\ntakes into account various factors, including transactions involving\nsimilar developments (corrected for differences in time), the natural\nattributes of the land, its shape, and its accessibility. 11     On\nor about 25 January 2010 (shortly after the applicant had acquired Lot\n1338M), the applicant filed an application with the URA for the requisite\nplanning permission for redevelopment. Provisional permission was\ngranted on 2 July 2010. The applicant then submitted revised plans\nto comply with the requirements of the provisional permission. Planning permission\nwas granted by the URA on 14 January 2011. 12     On\nor about 25 January 2011, the applicant submitted an application to\nthe SLA for the lifting of title restrictions on the Land for the\npurposes of redevelopment. On or about 21 February 2011, the applicant’s\nsolicitors, Legal21 LLC, wrote to the SLA to seek the SLA’s written\nconsent to sell units in the proposed redevelopment to individual\npurchasers and to align the lease tenures of Lots 1338M and 2818V\n(which had 67 and 64 years remaining respectively). By way of an\nemail dated 4 March 2011, the SLA informed Legal21 LLC that “[a]pplications\nfor consent for sale typically take approximately 4 weeks from the\ndate of receipt to process” but that the SLA was “happy to expedite\nthe case” and hoped to give a definite response by 9 March 2011. 13     On\n15 March 2011, the SLA sent an email to the applicants stating that\nthe alignment of the tenures of both Lots 1338M and 2818V would involve\na downgrading of the tenure of Lot 1338M which required a surrender\nand re-issue of the lease for the said lot. The email also stated\nthat the SLA would process the application for the lifting of title\nrestrictions upon approval for the downgrading of tenure; this would\nensure that the calculation of the DP payable took into account\nthe aligned tenure. 14     The\napplicant made numerous telephone calls and sent many emails between\nMarch and November 2011 to rush the SLA into making a decision.\nIn the meantime, the applicant obtained the requisite construction\npermit on 8 April 2011 and started construction work despite the\nlack of response. Finally, on 29 November 2011, the SLA wrote a\nletter to Legal21 LLC. The contents of this letter are set out below: 2.    The\nLessor has no objections to the sale of the individual units in\nthe Development by your client in respect of [the Land]. The consent\nis restricted to the particular sale and all the other covenants\n[in the leases] shall remain in full force and respect … 6.    Your\nclient has also applied for the downgrading of [Lot 1338M] to align\nwith the tenure of [Lot 2818V] which is currently being processed. 7.    As for your client’s application to\nlift title restrictions in respect of [the Land], we would like\nto inform your client thatdifferential premium\nequal to 100% of the enhancement to land value as assessed by the\nChief Valuer will be levied for the lifting of title restrictions.\nBefore we may process this application, your client is required\nto apply to URA to subdivide [Lot 2818V] since [Lot 2818V] will\nbe developed separately from its remaining parcel. Please let us\nhave a copy of the URA’s written permission for the sub-division once\nthat is issued. 8.    You may contact the undersigned if\nyou have further questions. [emphasis added] 15     The\napplicant accordingly applied for, and obtained on 4 January 2012,\nthe URA’s permission for the requisite sub-division of Lot 2818V. This\nwas forwarded to the SLA. On 13 January 2012, the SLA wrote to the applicant\nstating that it was prepared to recommend the surrender of the existing\ntitle to Lot 1338M and re-issue a fresh title to align the tenures\nof Lots 1338M and 2818V. The applicant accepted this offer on 8\nFebruary 2012. On 16 August 2012, the SLA informed the applicant\nthat the surrender and the re-issue were approved. To that end,\nthe SLA wrote to the applicant on 14 September 2012, attaching the\nre-issued lease for execution. The applicant duly executed the re-issued\nlease on 24 September 2012. 16     On\n20 February 2013, the SLA wrote to the applicant stating that it was\nprepared to lift the title restriction upon payment of $44,067,828.23. The\nbreakdown of this sum is as follows: (a)     DP\nin respect of Lot 1338M     $33,523,349.00 (b)     GST\non DP in respect of Lot 1338M     $2,346,634.43 (c)     DP\nin respect of Lot 2818V     $7,660,640.00 (d)     GST\non DP in respect of Lot 2818V     $536,244.80 (e)     Processing\nfee for Lot 1338M     $80.00 (f)     Processing\nfee for Lot 2818V     $880.00 (g)     Total     $44,067,828.23 17     On\n6 March 2013, the applicant wrote to the SLA seeking clarification on\nhow the DPs payable were calculated. In its reply dated 13 March\n2013, the SLA stated that the DPs were “assessed by the Chief Valuer\nbased on 100% enhancement in land value for the lifting of title\nrestrictions.” Legal21 LLC, in a letter to the SLA dated 2 April\n2013, wrote: With respect, your said letter of reply\ndated 13 March 2013 is unhelpful, as no requested clarification\non the basis of calculation of the differential premium set out\nin your said letter dated 20 February 2013 was offered. Specifically, our\nclients would like to seek clarification on which date the determination\nof the differential premium is pegged to, and which table of development\ncharge rates was used. Our clients have instructed a team of valuers\nto conduct a separate assessment to the Chief Valuer’s assessment\nof the differential premium payable and to render advice on the\nsame to our clients. … 18     The\nSLA sent a letter on 3 April 2013, stating that the material date\nfor the determination of the DP was 2 July 2010 (i.e.,\nthe date of provisional permission). More importantly, the SLA also\nstated that: The differential premium payable in respect\nof Lots 1338M and [2818V] is determined by the Chief Valuer. As\nsuch, the Development Charge table was not adopted in determining\nthe differential premium. 19     On\n9 April 2013, Legal21 LLC wrote a further letter to the SLA: We are instructed to request for clarification\nas to why the table of development charge rates, which is the prescribed\nmethod of assessment as published by SLA, was not adopted in determining\nthe differential premium payable. We are further instructed that the differential\npremium payable for the 2 plots, computed based on the table of\ndevelopment charge rates as at March 2010, are as follows: In respect of Lot [1338M]     S$8,831,607 In respect of Lot [2818V]     S$2,343,508 20     The\nSLA replied to Legal21 LLC by way of a letter dated 11 April 2013 stating: We would like to explain thatthis case is different from conventional leasehold\nsitesbecause lots 1338M and [2818V]were\nformerly directly alienated to the former owner instead of through\ncompetitive tender.Under the applicable policy for lifting\nrestrictions on directly alienated properties, and where the land\nis capable of independent development, private sector lessees are\nrequired to pay differential premium (DP) based on the full difference\n(i.e. 100%) between the land values based on the proposed and original\nuse / intensity, if allowed. The Government has stated clearly on 29\nNov 11 that DP pegged at 100% of the enhancement in land values\nwill be levied for the lifting of title restrictions in this case.\n[emphasis added] 21     In\nresponse, Legal21 LLC wrote to the SLA on 24 April 2013, seeking the\nfollowing particulars: (a)     Full\ndetails of the policy pertaining to the DP chargeable for directly\nalienated land (“the Policy”), including its rationale, when it was\nfirst established and applied and when the Policy will be applied and\nagainst whom; (b)     Whether\nthe Policy applied to all lessees of directly alienated properties\n(including subsequent lessees); (c)     Details\nof whether the Policy had been established by the SLA, and details\nof where a copy of the Policy may be obtained; and (d)     Confirmation\nthat the Policy had not been published by the SLA, if this was indeed\nthe case. 22     As\nan aside, the Policy was applied to the proposed redevelopment by CapitaLand\nof Market Street Car Park. This was widely reported in the Straits\nTimes and the Business Times. In particular, in a news release dated 3\nJanuary 2008, it was stated: The existing lease of Market Street Car\nPark, which expires on 31 March 2073, has a restriction on use.\nThe restriction has to be lifted to permit a re-development of the\nsite and this will be subject to the following two conditions: •payment by the lessee (CCT) of 100% of\nthe enhancement in land value as assessed by the Chief Valuer in\na spot valuation; and •no extension of the existing lease of Market Street Car Park [emphasis added] 23     On\n30 April 2013, Legal21 LLC wrote to the SLA stating that the applicant\nwished to appeal against the assessed DP on a without prejudice basis\nand enclosed a cheque for the $5,000 appeal fee. Legal21 LLC also stated: … Further, there are no conditions specified\nunder [the Leases of both lots] to indicate that [the Land] was\n“special” and this warranted a different method of computing the\ndifferential premiums. In all the circumstances, our clients take\nthe position that the Chief Valuer ought to have assessed the enhancement\nin land value by reference to the Development Charge. 24     For\nthe purposes of the appeal, the SLA met with the applicant on 8 May\n2013. The SLA explained to the applicant the mechanism behind the computation\nof the DP (i.e., 100% of the enhancement\nin value of the land as assessed by the Chief Valuer in a spot valuation).\nA further meeting was held on 15 May 2013, where representatives\nof the applicant, SLA and the Chief Valuer’s Office (“CVO”) were\npresent. The applicant brought valuers from Colliers International\n(Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Colliers”) along to the meeting. The CVO explained\nto Colliers that the CVO had adopted the comparison method, which\ninvolves using comparables with similar land use, for the spot valuation\nused to determine the DP payable. The applicant allegedly agreed\nat the meeting to submit a valuation report for CVO’s consideration.\nThis originating summons was filed on 17 May 2013. In a letter dated\n6 July 2013 (i.e., after this Originating\nSummons was filed) from Legal21 LLC to Allen & Gledhill (the\nSLA’s solicitors), the applicants denied that they had agreed to\nfurnish the CVO with an alternative valuation report. The applicant\nhas since withdrawn from the appeal process. 25     At\na pre-trial conference on 5 June 2013, the Attorney-General applied\nto be given the right to be heard at the substantive hearing before me.\nThat was granted by the Assistant Registrar. At another pre-trial conference\non 12 July 2013 before me, the parties agreed to address both the issue\nof leave and the substantive hearing in a consolidated hearing because of\nthe urgency of the matter. Accordingly this judgment will deal with\nboth the application for leave for judicial review and the merits\nof the case.",
        "Leave and other preliminary\nissues": "26     An\napplicant seeking judicial review must meet three conditions for leave\nto be granted (Jeyaretnam Kenneth Andrew v\nAttorney-General[2013] 1 SLR 619 at [5] and affirmed\nby the Court of Appeal ([2013] SGCA 56 at [5])): (a)     The\nsubject matter must be susceptible to judicial review; (b)     The\napplicant has sufficient interest (i.e.,locus\nstandi) in the matter; (c)     The\nmaterial before the court discloses an arguable orprima faciecase\nof reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies sought\nby the applicant. 27     The\nparties agreed that the subject matter was susceptible to judicial review\nand that the applicant had sufficient interest in the matter to\napply for judicial review. Accordingly the only issue before me\nwith regard to leave is whether the applicant could make out an\narguable orprima faciecase of\nreasonable suspicion. As the parties had agreed to consolidate the application\nfor leave with the substantive application, the applicant’s case would\ntherefore be decided on its merits. 28     There\nare however two preliminary issues which have to be decided before\nthe substantive issues can be addressed. The first issue pertains\nto whether the application for leave is out of time due to the operation\nof O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322 R 5 2006 Rev Ed).\nThe second relates to whether the applicant had exhausted all alternative\nremedies before seeking judicial review.",
        "Was the application for leave\nout of time?": "29     O\n53 r 1(6) of the Rules of Court reads: Notwithstanding the foregoing, leave shall\nnot be granted to apply for aQuashing Orderto\nremove any judgment, order, conviction or other proceeding for the\npurpose of its being quashed, unless the application for leave is\nmade within 3 months after the date of the proceeding or such other period\n(if any) as may be prescribed by any written law or, except where\na period is so prescribed, the delay is accounted for to the satisfaction\nof the Judge to whom the application for leave is made; and where\nthe proceeding is subject to appeal and a time is limited by law\nfor the bringing of the appeal, the Judge may adjourn the application\nfor leave until the appeal is determined or the time for appealing\nhas expired. [emphasis added] 30     The\napplicant took the position that the SLA made its decision on 20 February\n2013 as that was when the SLA informed the applicant of the amount\nof DP payable (see [16] above). It was only then that the applicant became\naware of the SLA’s decision to assess the DP payable without reference\nto the DC Table. As the application for leave to apply for judicial review\nwas filed on 17 May 2013, the application was made within the time prescribed\nby O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules of Court. 31     The\nSLA argued that the effective date of the SLA’s decision was 29 November\n2011 (see [14] above). That was the date the SLA first conveyed to\nthe applicant that the DP levied in its case would be “equal to\n100% of the enhancement in land value as assessed by the Chief Valuer”\nand not based on the DC Table rates. The application was therefore\nway out of time. 32     The\nAttorney-General did not make any submissions on whether the application\nwas out of time. 33     The\napplicant made several arguments in support of its contention that\nthe SLA decision was made on 20 February 2013: (a)     DP\nis assessed and imposed only after the SLA has made a decision to\nallow the lifting of title restrictions. As SLA only decided to\nlift title restrictions on 20 February 2013, the decision pertaining\nto the assessment of the DP could only have been made on or after\n20 February 2013; (b)     The\n29 November 2011 letter was wholly unclear and could not reasonably\nbe construed to be a decision on the assessment of DP payable. The\nSLA stated that the application for lifting of title restrictions\nwould be processed only after approval for subdivision for the lot\nnow known as Lot 2818V.  The DP payable would be assessed by the\nSLA only in the course of processing the application for lifting of\ntitle restrictions. The applicant also made several calls to the\nSLA to enquire about the amount of DP payable but received no response until\n20 February 2013; (c)     The\n29 November 2011 letter, while referring to DP being payable at\n100% of the land enhancement value, did not indicate to the applicant\nthat the SLA had decided to assess DP without reference to the DC\nTable. The applicant had understood the letter to mean that the\nDC Table would be adopted but that DP would be assessed at 100%\nof the applicable DC Table. This was buttressed by the 2007 SLA\nCircular in which the SLA wrote that it would “apply a factor of 5/7\nto the new revised Table of DC Rates” with regard to remnant State\nland (see [7] above). The applicant reasonably expected that “100%\nland enhancement value” would be calculated in a similar way; and (d)     In\na letter from the SLA to Legal21 LLC dated 30 April 2013, the SLA\nthemselves wrote that “[i]n view of your appeal, we are pleased\nto grant to your client a further extension of time to accept the\noffer dated 20 Feb 13”. 34     The\nSLA submitted that its decision was made on 29 November 2011. The\nmethod of DP assessment stated in the 29 November 2011 letter was not\ncontingent on the sub-division of the lot now known as Lot 2818V.\nThe only thing pending was the quantum of DP payable. It was clear\nthat the letter informed the applicant of the SLA’s final decision\non the methodology for assessing the DP payable. 35     O\n53 r 1(6) also allows a court to grant an extension of time where “the\ndelay is accounted for to the satisfaction of the Judge” (see alsoUDL Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Jurong Town Corp[2011]\n3 SLR 94 at [49] andTeng Fuh Holdings Pte\nLtd v Collector of Land Revenue[2007] 2 SLR(R) 568 at\n[18]). The applicant submitted that the circumstances justified\nthe grant of an extension of time. The applicant at all material\ntimes believed that the SLA would assess the DP payable in accordance\nwith the DC Table and only found out that the SLA would not be doing\nso on 20 February 2013. The SLA submitted that an extension of time\nshould not be granted. The delay of more than 17 months was inordinately\nlong. Further, as an established and experienced developer, the\napplicant should have understood the significance of the words “equal\nto 100% of the enhancement in land value as assessed by the Chief\nValuer” to mean that the DC Table would not be used. Lastly, the\napplicant had proceeded with the redevelopment and had already received\nsubstantial payments from individual purchasers. It would therefore\nbe unfair to the SLA for the applicant to take advantage of this\nand further delay the payment of the DP. 36     I\nagree with the applicant. Time only started to run from 20 February 2013\nand not 29 November 2011. The SLA’s decision was a multiple-step decision\nprocess. As a practical matter, the nub of the applicant’s complaint was\nnot just the method that was used to compute the DP payable but\nalso the outcome of that method. The applicant would have had no\ngrievance if the outcome of the Chief Valuer’s assessment of the\nDP was similar to the DP payable under the DC Table. The 29 November\n2011 letter did not specify the amount of money that was payable.\nThe applicant therefore did not have the full picture before it\nand would not have been in a position to determine if an application\nfor judicial review should be made (indeed, an application at that\nearly stage would have been premature).  This is strengthened by\nthe SLA letter dated 30 April 2013 (see [33(d)] above) in which\nthe SLA said that the offer to lift the title restrictions upon\npayment of the DP would run from 20 February 2013. 37     If\nI am wrong on this point and time started running from 29 November\n2011, I would hold that the delay in filing this originating summons\nis justified for the same reasons articulated in [36]. It would\nhave been reasonable for the applicant in the circumstances of this\ncase to have misapprehended which event was the final decision to\nchallenge. In any case, O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules of Court only applies\nto quashing orders and not to mandatory orders. The applicant has\nsought both a quashing order against the SLA’s decision and a mandatory\norder requiring the SLA to assess the DP in accordance with the\nDC Table. O 53 r 1(6) would only operate against the former and\nnot the latter. 38     I\ntherefore hold that the application for judicial review is not time-barred\nunder O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules of Court.",
        "Did the applicant exhaust all\npossible alternative remedies?": "39     As\na general rule, a person seeking judicial review of a decision by\na public body must exhaust all alternative remedies before invoking\nthe courts’ jurisdiction in judicial review (Borissik\nSvetlana v Urban Redevelopment Authority[2009] 4 SLR(R)\n92 at [25]). The applicant submitted that it was not caught by this\ngeneral rule because the prescribed appeal process presupposes a\ndeveloper which is not satisfied with a DP payable based on the\nDC Table (see [8] above). As the DP payable in this case was not\nbased on the DC Table, the appeal process is inapplicable to the\napplicant. The SLA submitted that the crux of the inquiry is whether\nthe alternative remedy is “equally effective and convenient” (citingRegina v Hillingdon London Borough Council, Ex parte\nRoyco Homes Ltd[1974] QB 720 at 728) and the administrative\nappeal in this case was expedient and hassle-free and effective\nin that the SLA and the Chief Valuer would be prepared to hear and\nconsider any alternative valuation that a developer puts forward. 40     The\nappeal process contemplates an aggrieved developer who, disagreeing\nwith the DP based on the DC Table, initiates an appeal process culminating\nin the SLA consulting the Chief Valuer for a spot valuation. The\nappeal process is not an alternative remedy for two reasons. First,\nas the applicant has pointed out, the DP payable in its case was\nnot based on the DC Table and accordingly, the appeal process does\nnot apply to the applicant. Second, and more fundamentally, the\nappeal process necessarily involves a spot valuation done by the\nChief Valuer. This is precisely the outcome that the applicant seeks\nto impugn as the applicant argues that the DC Table should apply.\nThere is simply no room in the prescribed process for the DP to\nbe assessed based on DC Table rates. The foregoing also accords\nwithRegina v Secretary of State for the Home\nDepartment, Ex parte Swati[1986] 1 WLR 477 at 485, where\nSir John Donaldson MR held that the general rule does not apply\nwhere “the applicant can distinguish his case from the type of case\nfor which the appeal procedure was provided.” 41     I\ntherefore hold that the applicant did not fail to comply with the general\nrule to exhaust all alternative remedies before invoking the courts’ jurisdiction\nin judicial review. There were no alternative remedies for the applicant\nto seek.",
        "The substantive application\nfor judicial review": "",
        "Weight to be ascribed to Gaw\nSeng Suan’s affidavit": "42     The\nSLA disputed the admissibility of, and the weight to be ascribed to,\nan affidavit filed by a Gaw Seng Suan (“Gaw”), an ex-employee of\nthe SLA. The applicant had requested Gaw to provide an expert opinion\non the issue of whether the Land Return Clause in the leases for\nboth lots (see [4] above) would have indicated to a reasonable property\ndeveloper looking to purchase the Land that the DP payable for a\nchange in use of the Land would be assessed at 100% of land enhancement\nvalue as assessed by the Chief Valuer through a spot valuation.\nGaw opined that a reasonable developer in the applicant’s shoes\nwould expect the DP payable to be assessed on the basis of the DC\nTable and that it was not market knowledge that the presence of\na Land Return Clause in a lease would lead to a higher DP or the\nDP being assessed on a different basis. 43     The\nSLA argued that Gaw’s expert evidence is inadmissible. The issue at\nstake is not a question of expert opinion because it does not pertain\nto any point of scientific, technical or other specialised knowledge.\nMr Gaw was never a property developer. In any case, Gaw’s responsibilities\nat the SLA pertained to records management and administrative work.\nGaw was not involved in any work relating to the DP Clause and/or\nthe Land Return Clause or the policy of charging DP equal to 100%\nof the enhancement of land value as assessed by the Chief Valuer.\nThus, Gaw had no basis to hold himself out as an expert nor did\nhe have any particular insight into the issue. 44     In\nresponse, the applicant pointed out that it was not disputed that Gaw\nhad worked on the change in DP policy (i.e.,\nfrom spot valuations for all cases to the DC Table-based system)\nwhich eventually resulted in the issue of the 2000 SLA Circular.\nGaw also had significant experience providing specialist advice\non land matters to private sector clients, including issues relating\nto the lifting of title restrictions and DP assessments. The fact\nthat Gaw was not a property developer is not a reason to disregard\nhis evidence. Further, s 47 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev\nEd) states that expert evidence is admissible if the court is “likely\nto derive assistance from an opinion upon a point of scientific,\ntechnical or other specialised knowledge” and it was introduced\nin 2012 to broaden the categories of admissible expert evidence\nand to allow the Court to have the benefit of any expert opinion\nthat may be useful and is in the interests of justice (citing the\nsecond reading of the Evidence (Amendment) Bill as reported inSingapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(14\nFebruary 2012) vol 88). 45     The\nAttorney-General submitted that the question posed to Gaw — that\nis, whether the Land Return Clause would have put a reasonable property\ndeveloper on notice — is a question for the court’s determination and\nnot for expert opinion. As the Court of Appeal held inPacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and\nanother appeal[2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 at [85] (in turn citingThe H156[1999] 2 SLR(R) 419 at [27]),\nan expert may not usurp the function of the court and present his\nfinding. In other words, an expert may not answer the very question\nthat is before the court (in this regard, see also Chen Siyuan,\n“Expert Evidence and the Ultimate Issue Rule” (2011) Research Collection\nSchool of Law, Paper 21 (<http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/sol_research_smu/21>,\naccessed on 22 October 2013). Further, there was no explanation\nas to how Gaw’s experience equipped him to provide an opinion. 46     In\nmy view, Gaw’s evidence was admissible pursuant to s 47 of the Evidence\nAct. However, his evidence was of limited weight. The issue is not just\nabout actual knowledge — the enquiry also touches on constructive knowledge\n(i.e., what a reasonable property\ndeveloper would have known had he made the requisite enquiries,\nas shall be discussed below at [122] to [127]). Gaw was not a property\ndeveloper and his opinion with regard to whether a reasonable property\ndeveloper would have known that the Land Return Clause meant that\nthe DP payable would be based on a spot valuation by the Chief Valuer\nat 100% of the enhancement value would be premised on, at best,\nsecond-hand knowledge based on his dealings with private sector\ndevelopers. His second-hand knowledge would not be persuasive.",
        "The arguments": "47     The\napplicant’s various arguments can essentially be divided into two strands:\nfirst, the SLA’s decision to assess DP via a spot valuation was irrational\nand unreasonable because no public authority would act so inconsistently,\nespecially in the light of the unequivocal representations made.\nSecond, the SLA’s decision deprived the applicant of its legitimate expectation\nof the DP being assessed in accordance with the DC Table. 48     The\nSLA argued, firstly, that its decision was not irrational and unreasonable\nbecause the SLA has statutory duties and functions to discharge;\nin particular, the public interest in ensuring that the State realises the\nfull value of State land. Secondly, the doctrine of substantive\nlegitimate expectation has yet to be accepted as part of Singapore\nlaw. Even if it is part of the law, the applicant could not have\nhad the legitimate expectation that the DP would be assessed in\naccordance with the DC Table. Even if the applicant had such a legitimate\nexpectation, the disappointment of that expectation in this case\nwas justified. 49     The\nAttorney-General averred that the policy of assessing DP via a spot\nvaluation cannot be impugned in court because this would be tantamount\nto a “merits review”. Moreover, the application of the policy to the\napplicant was not unreasonable because it was done after due deliberation\nwith all stakeholders. The Attorney-General also argued that the\ndoctrine of substantive legitimate expectation should not be adopted\nin Singapore. In any event, no substantive legitimate expectation\ncould be said to have arisen on the facts. At most, any legitimate\nexpectation would have pertained to procedure and this had already\nbeen given effect to.",
        "The issues": "50     Accordingly\ntwo main issues arose for consideration in this case: (a)     Was\nthe SLA’s decision to assess the DP through a spot valuation instead\nof abiding by the DC Table irrational and/or unreasonable? (b)     Should\nthe doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation be recognised\nin Singapore law? If so, can the applicant avail itself of this doctrine?",
        "Was the SLA’s decision to assess\nDP via a spot valuation irrational and/or unreasonable?": "51     The\napplicant’s first argument is that the SLA’s decision to assess\nthe DP by means of a spot valuation was irrational and/or unreasonable.\nThe assessment, it submitted, ought to have been in accordance with\nthe DC Table. 52     InAssociated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v Wednesbury Corporation[1948]\n1 KB 223 (“Wednesbury”). Lord Greene\nMR, speaking for a unanimous Court of Appeal, held (at 229) that: It is true the discretion must be exercised\nreasonably. Now what does that mean? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology\ncommonly used in relation to exercise of statutory discretions often\nuse the word \"unreasonable\" in a rather comprehensive sense. It\nhas frequently been used and is frequently used as a general description\nof the things that must not be done. For instance, a person entrusted\nwith a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in\nlaw.He must call his own attention to the\nmatters which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his\nconsideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to consider.If\nhe does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is\nsaid, to be acting \"unreasonably.\" Similarly, there may be something\nso absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within\nthe powers of the authority. Warrington L.J. in Short v. Poole Corporation\n[1926] Ch 66 gave the example of the red-haired teacher, dismissed\nbecause she had red hair. That is unreasonable in one sense. In another\nsense it is taking into consideration extraneous matters. It is\nso unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done\nin bad faith; and, in fact, all these things run into one another.\n[emphasis added] 53     In\nthe House of Lords decision ofCouncil of Civil\nService Unions and others v Minister of the Civil Service[1985]\n1 AC 374 (“theGCHQcase”), Lord\nDiplock equatedWednesburyunreasonableness\nwith irrationality (at 410): By \"irrationality\" I mean what can by now\nbe succinctly referred to as \"Wednesbury unreasonableness\" (Associated\nProvincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation [1948]\n1 K.B. 223). It applies to a decision which isso\noutrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards\nthat no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question\nto be decided could have arrived at it.Whether a decision\nfalls within this category is a question that judges by their training\nand experience should be well equipped to answer, or else there\nwould be something badly wrong with our judicial system. [emphasis\nadded] Lord Diplock’s comments were adopted in Singapore law by the\nCourt of Appeal case ofChng Suan Tze v Minister\nfor Home Affairs and others and other appeals[1988]\n2 SLR(R) 525 (“Chng Suan Tze”) at\n[119]. 54     Both\nthe SLA and the Attorney-General contended thatWednesburyunreasonableness\nis a high standard that is difficult to meet. The SLA cited the\nCourt of Appeal case ofManjit Singh s/o Kirpal\nSingh and another v Attorney-General[2013] SGCA 45 at\n[7] where it was stated that “[t]heWednesburytest\nsets a high bar”. The Attorney-General relied onChee\nSiok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another[2006]\n1 SLR(R) 582 where V K Rajah J (as he then was) (at [125]) held\nthat the standard of unreasonableness “is from a jurisprudential\nperspective, pragmatically fixed at a very high level”. 55     Before\nthe analysis can proceed any further, it is useful to characterise the\nact that the applicant is seeking to impugn as being unreasonable. 56     The\nSLA, in its first affidavit filed by Thong Wai Lin, Director of\nthe Land Sales and Acquisition Division of the SLA, averred (at\n[36]) that: Directly-alienated lands, where the leases\ncontain the Land Return Clause, have always been one of those cases\nto which the DC Table has no application. … In the case of directly-alienated land\nwhere the lease contains the Land Return Clause, the policy is to\ncharge DP based on100% enhancement in value\nas assessed by the Chief Valuer in a spot valuation,\nif the State decides to forego the right to the return of the land\nand to allow the requested change of use of the land. [emphasis in original] The SLA thus characterised its decision as one that was made\npursuant to an existing policy and not as a result of a change in\npolicy. The SLA thus did not depart from the DC Table (a method\nthat was spelt out in the SLA circulars and the SLA website, see\n[6] – [8] above). The Attorney-General essentially agreed with the\nrespondent and pointed out that there were two operative policies:\none concerning State leases without a Land Return Clause where the\nDP payable is calculated according to the DC Table and another concerning\nState leases with a Land Return Clause where, assuming that the\nGovernment chooses not to exercise its right to require the return of\nthe land, the DP is charged based on 100% of the enhancement in\nland value as assessed by the Chief Valuer in a spot valuation.\nThe applicant did not indicate clearly which characterisation it\nwas relying on, presumably because its arguments would remain the\nsame either way. 57     At\nthe outset, I would like to point out that there is an immense difference\nbetween, on the one hand, the implementation of a second extant policy\n(which was not discernible from the public statements put out by\nthe SLA), and on the other hand, a change in policy (with there\nbeing only one policy applicable to start with) or a decision not\nto apply a policy to a particular case. In the former, the policy\nwas already in operation at the time of the act in issue. In the\nlatter, the change of policy or decision not to apply the policy\nis contemporaneous with the act in issue. The legal analysis that\nflows from each characterisation is markedly and necessarily different. This\ncourt’s analysis shall be premised on the former (see also [68]\n– [71] below). 58     The\napplicant submitted that the plain wording of the SLA Circulars and\nthe SLA website is clear, unambiguous and affirmative: the DP would be\nassessed by reference to the DC Table. No other policy or method\nfor assessing DP is specified in the aforementioned sources or in\nany other publicly available document. The 2000 SLA Circular (see\n[6] above) explicitly states that the specified method for assessing\nDP is “a transparent system” which “provide[s] greater certainty\nto landowners who will now be able to compute the DP payable themselves.”\nThe SLA Circulars and the SLA website are exhaustive and they only\nspecify two exceptions: where the use stipulated in the title restriction\ndoes not fit into any of the use groups in the DC Table and where\nthe lease tenure is upgraded. None of these exceptions applies here. 59     The\napplicant argued that the SLA had acted unreasonably in theWednesburysense because a legitimate\nexpectation arose that the “SLA will behave as it says it will”.\nThis conflates the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation\nwithWednesburyunreasonableness.\nThe issue of whether substantive legitimate expectation is part\nof Singapore law and if so, whether it is a stand-alone head of\njudicial review or is in truth a subset ofWednesburyunreasonableness\nwill be discussed subsequently (see [117] below). 60     The\nessence of the applicant’s arguments was that it was unreasonable for\nthe SLA not to adhere to its public promulgations. The applicant proceeded\nto point out that the existing policy of charging a DP based on 100%\nenhancement in value as assessed by the Chief Valuer in a spot valuation\n(see [56] above) is inconsistent with an earlier statement by the then\nMinister for National Development Mah Bow Tan (Singapore Parliamentary\nDebates, Official Report(19 July 2010) vol 87, at col\n815): Currently, DP or DC rate is pegged at 70%\nof the enhancement in land value.  The DP or DC collected allows\nthe State to provide the necessary infrastructure and services (eg,\nroads, drainage and sewerage) without which the developer cannot\nmaterialise the higher development intensity in the area.The balance of the gain from the land value enhancement\nis retained by the land-owner and provides an incentive for him\nto undertake the development work. In calibrating the DC rate, there is a\nneed to balance between providing an equitable share of the land\nvalue enhancement for the State to fund the necessary infrastructure\nand services and, at the same time, providing a reasonable incentive\nfor land-owners and developers to undertake development works. We\nbelieve that the current 70% DC rate is reasonable in the current\nmarket conditions. [emphasis added] In a similar vein, the 2000 SLA Circular (see [6] above) states\nthat: With effect from 31 July 2000, the Singapore\nLand Authority has implemented a transparent system of determination\nof differential premium (DP) for the lifting of State title restrictions\ninvolving change of use and/or increase in intensity.This is to encourage optimisation of land use and\nto facilitate the overall pace of redevelopment in Singapore.\n[emphasis added] 61     Further,\non its plain terms, the Land Return Clause only requires the lessee\nto inform the SLA if any part of the land is not being used for\nthe purpose specified in the lease. When the applicant made its\napplication for the lifting of title restrictions, the whole of\nthe land was being used for the specified purposes. Thus the question\nof the State giving up its right to take back the land does not\neven arise and it would be wrong to assess the DP on the basis of\ncompensating the state for giving up such a right. Additionally, the\nSLA has not been able to provide any explanation as to why the policy should\napply to subsequentbona fidepurchasers\nof directly alienated lands, where the subsequent purchaser obtained\nthe land through a competitive tender process and derived no benefit\nfrom the earlier direct alienation. The subsequent purchaser would\nalso have no way of finding out that the land was directly alienated\nto the former owner. 62     The\nSLA averred that it was not unreasonable for the DP to be assessed\nby a spot valuation at 100% value.  It was in the interests of the public\nfor the State to realise the full value of any land that it disposes\nof. Where directly alienated land is concerned, the State is in\nfact forfeiting its legal right to take back the land (pursuant\nto the Land Return Clause) and the chance to re-sell the land at\na higher price in a competitive tender. The State must ensure that\nit obtains a DP that fully and accurately reflects the enhancement\nin value that the state is foregoing. Indeed, the SLA was merely\ndischarging its statutory duties and functions. Section 6(1)(a) of the Singapore Land Authority Act\n(Cap 301, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the SLA Act”) states that it shall be the\nfunction and duty of the SLA “to optimise land resources”. This\nnecessarily entails a duty on SLA’s part to obtain the full enhancement\non land value where directly-alienated state lands are concerned. 63     The\nAttorney-General argued that the reasonableness (or otherwise) of\nthe policy to assess DP by a spot valuation at full value is a “polycentric” matter\nwhich is not suited to a “merits review” by the court. In assessing\nthe DP, the SLA acts as the agent of the Government (s 6(1)(e)(iv) of the SLA Act). In carrying out\nthis function, the SLA is involved in “polycentric” decision making;\ns 6(2) of the SLA Act stipulates: In carrying out its functions, the Authority\nshall — (a)    have regard to efficiency\nand economy and to the social, industrial, commercial and economic\nneeds of Singapore… 64     It\nis well-established that the courts will be slow to review such “polycentric”\nmatters. InLee Hsien Loong v Review Publishing\nCo Ltd and another and another suit[2007] 2 SLR(R) 453\n(“Lee Hsien Loong”), Sundaresh Menon\nJC (as he then was) held (at [96] and [98]) that: 96    Second,\nwithin the span of executive decisions that are immune from judicial\nreview are those involving matters of \"high policy\". This includes such\nmatters as dissolving Parliament, the conduct of foreign affairs,\nthe making of treaties, matters pertaining to war, the deployment\nof the armed forces and issues pertaining to national defence. These\nare what the American courts call \"political questions\" and the\nreasons underlying the deference accorded to the executive branch\nof government in such areas have been articulated in the cases I\nhave referred to. In my judgment, cases concerning international\nboundary disputes or the recognition of foreign governments comfortably\nfall within this class of cases. … 98    …\nIn my judgment, the correct approach is not to assume a highly rigid\nand categorical approach to deciding which cases are not justiciable. Rather,\nas Laws LJ put it in Marchiori ([94] supra) at [39], the intensity\nof judicial review will depend upon the context in which the issue\narises and upon common sense, which takes into account the simple\nfact that there are certain questions in respect of which there\ncan be no expectation that an unelected judiciary will play any\nrole. In this regard, the following principles bear noting: (a)    Justiciability\ndepends, not on the source of the decision-making power, but on\nthe subject matter that is in question. Where it is the executive\nthat has access to the best materials available to resolve the issue,\nits views should be regarded as highly persuasive, if not decisive. (b)    Where the decision involves matters\nof government policy and requires the intricate balancing of various\ncompeting policy considerations that judges are ill-equipped to\nadjudicate because of their limited training, experience and access\nto materials, the courts should shy away from reviewing its merits. … 65     The\nAttorney-General also cited Lord Woolf,et\nal, De Smith’s Judicial Review(Sweet & Maxwell,\n7th Ed, 2013)  at paras [1-042] and [1-043]: A third limitation on the court’s institutional\ncapacity occurs when a legal challenge is made on substantive grounds\nto a matter which is “polycentric” — where the decision-taker has\nbroad discretion involving policy and public interest considerations.\n… Most “allocative decisions” — decisions\ninvolving the distribution of limited resources — fall into the\ncategory of polycentric decisions. If the court alters such a decision,\nthe judicial intervention will set up a chain reaction, requiring\na rearrangement of other decisions with which the original has interacting\npoints of influence. … … Another typical polycentric decision is\none involving the allocation of scarce resources among competing\nclaims. 66     It\nwas submitted that the formulation of the policy to assess the DP\nby a spot valuation was clearly a polycentric decision that was\ntaken only after due deliberation and consultation with other relevant\nagencies and stakeholders on whether to exercise the right to take\nback the land. This policy is inextricably intertwined with the\nState’s macro-policy considerations of what is in Singapore’s economic,\ncommercial, industrial and social interests. 67     In\norder to satisfy the high threshold ofWednesburyunreasonableness,\nthe applicant must show that the SLA had, on one formulation, taken\ninto account extraneous considerations that it should not have taken\ninto account or had not taken into account considerations which\nit should have taken into account. Alternatively, the applicant\nmust show that the SLA’s decision was so outrageous in its defiance\nof logic that no sensible person who had applied his mind could\nhave arrived at the same decision. 68     There\nare three ways of characterising the SLA’s allegedly unreasonable\nconduct: (a)     Applying\nthe policy of assessing the DP via a spot valuation at 100% of land\nenhancement value; (b)     Applying\nthe policy of assessing DP via a spot valuation at 100% of land\nenhancement value but not disclosing the existence of such a policy\nbeforehand; (c)     Applying\nthe policy of assessing DP via a spot valuation and at 100% of land\nenhancement value, not disclosing the policy beforehand and not\ntaking into account the applicant’s legitimate expectation. 69     In\nthe first characterisation, it is the policy alone that is being impugned.\nThe SLA, in formulating policy, is statutorily obliged to have regard\nto “efficiency and economy and to the social, industrial, commercial and\neconomic needs of Singapore” (s 6(2) of the SLA Act, see [63] above). The\nbalancing of these competing interests is not within the institutional competence\nof the judiciary (Lee Hsien Loong(at\n[98(b)], see [64] above). Thus, the policy by itself cannot be said\nto be unreasonable in theWednesburysense. 70     However,\nthe applicant was not aggrieved by the SLA’s policy. The applicant’s\ncomplaint was that the policy was not publicised, giving it the impression\nthat the publicised policy (that is, DP assessed at DC Table rates)\nwould apply. 71     At\ncommon law, there is no legal duty on the part of the Government to\npublicise the policies which it seeks to implement. In the context\nof administrative decisions, there is no general rule that reasons\nmust be given (seee.g. Marta Stefan v General\nMedical Council[1999] 1 WLR 1293 at 1300G-H). It was\ntherefore not unreasonable in theWednesburysense\nfor the SLA not to publicise its policy of assessing DP via a spot\nvaluation at 100% of the land enhancement value. In any case, the\napplicant’s contention was that it was led to believe that the said\npolicy would refer to the DC Table anyway. 72     This\nleaves me with the last characterisation — that it was unreasonable\nfor the SLA to have applied an undisclosed policy to the applicant’s\ncase and thereby neglecting unreasonably to take into account the\napplicant’s legitimate expectation. This issue will be dealt with\nin the discussion on the law pertaining to substantive legitimate\nexpectations (see [118] – [128] below).",
        "Should the doctrine of substantive\nlegitimate expectations be recognised in Singapore law? If so, can\nthe applicant avail itself of this doctrine?": "73     The\nterm “legitimate expectation” was first used by Lord Denning MR inSchmidt and another v Secretary of State for Home\nAffairs[1969] 2 Ch 149 (“Schmidt”).\nThe case concerned the Home Secretary’s decision to refuse an extension\nof a foreign student’s temporary permit to stay in the United Kingdom.\nLord Denning MR rejected the foreign student’s contention that he\nought to have been afforded a hearing. He held that: It all depends on whether he has some right\nor interest, or, I would add, some legitimate expectation, of which\nit would not be fair to deprive him without hearing what he has\nto say. 74     In\ntheGCHQcase, a majority of the\nHouse of Lords held that the applicants there had a legitimate expectation\nthat they would be consulted before their rights to unionise were\ntaken away. This duty was however overridden by national security\nconcerns. Lord Diplock held (at 408F – 409A): To qualify as a subject for judicial review\nthe decision must have consequences which affect some person (or\nbody of persons) other than the decision-maker, although it may\naffect him too. It must affect such other person either: (a)    by\naltering rights or obligations of that person which are enforceable\nby or against him in private law; or (b)    by depriving him of some benefit or\nadvantage which either (i) he had in the past been permitted by\nthe decision-maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect\nto be permitted to continue to do until there has been communicated\nto him some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has\nbeen given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received assurance from\nthe decision-maker will not be withdrawn without giving him first\nan opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they should\nnot be withdrawn. (I prefer to continue to call the kind of expectation\nthat qualifies a decision for inclusion in class (b) a \"legitimate\nexpectation\" rather than a \"reasonable expectation,\" in order thereby\nto indicate that it has consequences to which effect will be given\nin public law, whereas an expectation or hope that some benefit\nor advantage would continue to be enjoyed, although it might well\nbe entertained by a \"reasonable\" man, would not necessarily have\nsuch consequences. In the same case, Lord Fraser of Tullybelton formulated the\ndoctrine of legitimate expectations on a more general basis which\ncould be construed to include substantive (as opposed to merely\nprocedural) relief (at 401A-B): But even where a person claiming some benefit\nor privilege has no legal right to it, as a matter of private law,\nhe may have a legitimate expectation of receiving the benefit or\nprivilege, and, if so, the courts will protect his expectation by\njudicial review as a matter of public law. This subject has been fully\nexplained by my noble and learned friend, Lord Diplock, in O'Reilly\nv. Mackman [1983] 2 A.C. 237 and I need not repeat what he has so\nrecently said. Legitimate, or reasonable, expectation may arise\neither from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority\nor from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can\nreasonably expect to continue. 75     For\nthe moment, I turn my attention to related cases which granted substantive\nrelief on other grounds. The Court of Appeal case ofLever (Finance) Ltd v Westminster Corporation[1970]\n3 All ER 496 (“Lever Finance”) granted\nrelief on the ground of estoppel. In that case, developers applied\nfor and obtained planning permission to build 14 houses on a particular\ntract of land. A month after this, the developers’ architect made some\nvariations to the plan. One of the houses was to be sited 23 feet\naway from existing houses (as opposed to 40 feet under the original\napproved plan).  The planning authority’s planning officer had lost\nthe file containing the original approved plan and because of this\nmistakenly told the developer’s architect over the telephone that\nthis variation was not material and that no further planning consent\nwas required. The developers went ahead with construction. Sometime\nlater, the planning authority said that planning permission was\nactually required (after complaints received by the existing residents)\nand permission was subsequently denied. The developers sought an\ninjunction restraining the authority from serving an enforcement\nnotice requiring them to demolish the half-built house. Lord Denning\nMR (at 500h–j) held that: I know that there are authorities which\nsay that a public authority cannot be estopped by any representations\nmade by its officers. It cannot be estopped from doing its public\nduty. See, for instance, the recent decision of the Divisional Court\nin Southend-on-Sea Corpn v Hodgson (Wickford) Ltd. But those statements\nmust now be taken with considerable reserve. There are many matters\nwhich public authorities can now delegate to their officers. If an\nofficer, acting within the scope of his ostensible authority, makes\na representation on which another acts, then a public authority\nmay be bound by it, just as much as a private concern would be. 76     The\nHouse of Lords case ofIn re Preston[1985]\n1 AC 835 held that substantive relief could be granted on the basis\nof abuse of power where the conduct complained about is equivalent\nto a breach of contract or a breach of representation. The case\nconcerned a taxpayer who alleged that an officer from the Inland\nRevenue Commissioners (“IRC”) had represented to him that the IRC\nwould not raise further inquiries on his tax affairs if the taxpayer\nwithdrew certain claims for interest relief and capital loss.  The House\nof Lords found that no such representation was made. Nevertheless, Lord\nTempleman said (at 864G) that: The court can only intervene by judicial\nreview to direct the commissioners to abstain from performing their\nstatutory duties or from exercising their statutory powers if the\ncourt is satisfied that \"the unfairness\" of which the applicant\ncomplains renders the insistence by the commissioners on performing\ntheir duties or exercising their powers an abuse of power by the commissioners. Lord Templeman continued (at 866H – 867B): In principle I see no reason why the appellant\nshould not be entitled to judicial review of a decision taken by\nthe commissioners if that decision is unfair to the appellant because\nthe conduct of the commissioners is equivalent to a breach of contract\nor a breach of representation. Such a decision falls within the\nambit of an abuse of power for which in the present case judicial\nreview is the sole remedy and an appropriate remedy. There may be\ncases in which conduct which savours of breach of conduct [sic] or breach of representation does\nnot constitute an abuse of power; there may be circumstances in\nwhich the court in its discretion might not grant relief by judicial\nreview notwithstanding conduct which savours of breach of contract or\nbreach of representation. In the present case, however, I consider\nthat the appellant is entitled to relief by way of judicial review\nfor \"unfairness\" amounting to abuse of power if the commissioners\nhave been guilty of conduct equivalent to a breach of contract or\nbreach of representations on their part. 77     Thus,\nwith respect to substantive relief where no existing legal right was\nalleged to have been infringed, there were at least three doctrines\n(or variations thereof) at play: legitimate expectation, estoppel\nand abuse of power. I shall next consider how some common law jurisdictions\nhave dealt with these doctrines. England 78Regina v Secretary of State for the Home Department,\nEx parte Ruddock and others[1987] 1 WLR 1482 (“Ex p Ruddock”) was the first case to state\nexpressly that the doctrine of legitimate expectation could not\nbe restricted to cases involving the right to be heard.  An active\nand prominent member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament had\nhis phone tapped. He alleged that this was not done in accordance\nwith the criteria for the interception of communications which had\nbeen published on six occasions. The court dismissed the application\non the facts but relied on Lord Frasier’s speech in theGCHQcase (see [73] above) in stating\n(at 1497A – B): Whilst most of the cases are concerned,\nas Lord Roskill said, with a right to be heard, I do not think the\ndoctrine is so confined. Indeed, in a case where ex hypothesi there\nis no right to be heard, it may be thought the more important to\nfair dealing that a promise or undertaking given by a minister as\nto how he will proceed should be kept. Of course such promise or\nundertaking must not conflict with his statutory duty or his duty,\nas here, in the exercise of a prerogative power. 79     In\nthe House of Lords decision ofRegina (Reprotech\n(Pebsham) Ltd) v East Sussex County Council[2003] 1\nWLR 348, a purchaser of a waste treatment plant, with a view to\nusing waste to generate electricity, consulted the county planning\nofficer who said that generating electricity on the plant on a 24-hour\nbasis would not amount to a material change of use requiring planning\npermission. Some years after the purchase, the purchaser was told that\nplanning permission was actually required. Relief was denied on\nthe facts. Lord Hoffman spoke for a unanimous House of Lords: 33    In\nany case, I think that it isunhelpful to introduce\nprivate law concepts of estoppel into planning law. As\nLord Scarman pointed out in Newbury District Council v Secretary\nof State for the Environment [1981] AC 578, 616, estoppels bind\nindividuals on the ground that it would be unconscionable for them\nto deny what they have represented or agreed. Butthese\nconcepts of private law should not be extended into \"the public\nlaw of planning control, which binds everyone\". (See\nalso Dyson J in R v Leicester City Council, Ex p Powergen UK Ltd\n[2000] JPL 629, 637.) 34    There is of course an analogy between\na private law estoppel and the public law concept ofa legitimate expectation created by a public authority, the\ndenial of which may amount to an abuse of power: see\nR v North and East Devon Health Authority, Ex p Coughlan [2001]\nQB 213. But it is no more than an analogy because remedies against\npublic authorities also have to take into account the interests\nof the general public which the authority exists to promote. Public\nlaw can also take into account the hierarchy of individual rights\nwhich exist under the Human Rights Act 1998, so that, for example,\nthe individual's right to a home is accorded a high degree of protection\n(see Coughlan's case, at pp 254-255) whileordinary\nproperty rights are in general far more limited by considerations\nof public interest: see R (Alconbury Developments Ltd)\nv Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions\n[2001] 2 WLR 1389. 35    It is true that in early cases such\nas the Wells case [1967] 1 WLR 1000 and Lever Finance Ltd v Westminster\n(City) London Borough Council [1971] 1 QB 222, Lord Denning MR used\nthe language of estoppel in relation to planning law.At that time the public law concepts of abuse of\npower and legitimate expectation were very undeveloped and no doubt\nthe analogy of estoppel seemed useful.In the Western\nFish case [1981] 2 All ER 204 the Court of Appeal tried its best\nto reconcile these invocations of estoppel with the general principle\nthat a public authority cannot be estopped from exercising a statutory\ndiscretion or performing a public duty. But the results did not\ngive universal satisfaction: see the comments of Dyson J in the Powergen\ncase [2000] JPL 629, 638.It seems to me that\nin this area, public law has already absorbed whatever is useful\nfrom the moral values which underlie the private law concept of\nestoppel and the time has come for it to stand upon its own two\nfeet. [emphasis added] 80     The\nCourt of Appeal, in the subsequent case ofSouth\nBucks District Council v Flanagan and another[2002]\n1 WLR 2601 (decided later than the above case but reported earlier),\nconstrued the foregoing passage (at [16]) as the House of Lords\ndeciding that “there is no longer a place for the private law doctrine\nof estoppel in public law or for the attendant problems which it\nbrings with it.” 81The Queen on the application of, Bhatt Murphy (a\nfirm) and others v The Independent Assessor[2008] EWCA\nCiv 755 concerned a group of individuals and solicitors who had\nbeen denied access to a compensation scheme run by the government.\nThe Court of Appeal denied relief on the facts but Law LJ commented\non the underlying basis of the doctrine of legitimate expectation\n(at [28]): Legitimate expectation of either kind may\n(not must) arise in circumstances where a public decision-maker\nchanges, or proposes to change, an existing policy or practice.The doctrine will apply in circumstances where the change\nor proposed change of policy or practice is held to be unfair or\nan abuse of power: see for example Ex p Coughlan paragraphs\n67 ff, Ex p Begbie [2000] 1 WLR 1115, 1129F — H. The court is generally\nthe first, not the last, judge of what is unfair or abusive; its\nrole is not confined to a back-stop review of the primary decision-maker's\nstance or perception: see in particular Ex p Guinness Plc [1990]\n1 QB 146. Unfairness and abuse of power march together: see (in\naddition to Coughlan and Begbie) Preston [1985] AC 835, Ex p Unilever\n[1996] STC 681, 695 and Rashid [2005] INRL 550 paragraph 34. But\nthese are ills expressed in very general terms; and it is notorious\n(and obvious) that the ascertainment of what is or is not fair depends\non the circumstances of the case. The excoriation of these vices\nno doubt shows that the law's heart is in the right place, but it\nprovides little guidance for the resolution of specific instances.\n[emphasis added] 82     There\nis no doubt that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation\nis part of English law. The Court of Appeal decision ofRegina (Patel) v General Medical Council[2013]\n1 WLR 2801 (“Patel v GMC”) is the\nlatest pronouncement on the law as it currently stands in England.\nThe case pertained to a medical doctor who received e-mail assurances\nthat, upon completion of a distance learning pre-clinical course\nfrom a particular university, he would be provisionally registered\nas a doctor with the General Medical Council (“GMC”). The GMC subsequently\ntold the claimant that his primary medical qualification was unacceptable\nand denied provisional registration. The Court of Appeal granted\nsubstantive relief on the ground of substantive legitimate expectation\nand declared that the GMC was compelled to recognise the claimant’s\nprimary medical qualification for the purposes of registration.\nThe court utilised the following framework: (a)     The\nstatement or representation relied upon as giving rise to a legitimate\nexpectations must be “clear, unambiguous and devoid of relevant\nqualification” (at [40]); (b)     The\nparty seeking to rely on the statement or representation must have\nplaced all his cards on the table (at [41]); (c)     While\ndetrimental reliance is not a condition precedent, its presence\nmay be an influential consideration in determining what weight should\nbe given to the legitimate expectation (at [84]). (d)     The\nstatement or representation must be pressing and focused. While\nin theory there is no limit to the number of beneficiaries, in reality\nthe number is likely to be small as (i)       It is difficult to imagine a case in which government will be\nheld legally bound by a representation or undertaking made generally\nor to a diverse class; and (ii)       The broader the class claiming the benefit of the expectation\nthe more likely it is that a supervening public interest will be\nheld to justify the change of position (at [50]). (e)     The\nburden of proof lies on the applicant to prove the legitimacy of\nhis expectation. Once this is done the onus shifts to the respondent to\njustify the frustration of the legitimate expectation. It is for\nthe authority to identify any overriding interest on which it relies\nto justify the frustration of the expectation (at [58]); and (f)     The\ncourt has to decide for itself whether there is a sufficient overriding\ninterest to justify a departure from what has been previously promised\n(at [60]). In doing so the court must weigh the competing interests.\nThe degree of intensity of review will vary from case to case, depending\non the character of the decision challenged (at [61]). 83     It\nis clear that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation\nis part of English law. It appears that the doctrine of estoppel\nhas been subsumed under the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation. Australia 84     Australia\nhas hitherto not recognised the doctrine of estoppel in the context\nof public law (Annetts and another v McCann\nand others(1990) 97 ALR 177 at 184, cited with approval\ninRe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural\nAffairs; Ex parte Lam(2003) 72 ALD 613 (“Ex p Lam”) at [69]) 85Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh(1995)\n183 CLR 353 (“Teoh”) was a High\nCourt of Australia case which held that a legitimate expectation\narose from the ratification of an international treaty that had\nnot been implemented by statute. The court held that ratification was\nnot an ineffectual act. It was a positive statement by the executive\nthat its agencies will act in accordance with the treaty. 86     However,\nthe subsequent High Court of Australia case ofEx\np Lamhas cast doubt onTeoh.\nIn that case, the applicant was granted a transitional (permanent)\nvisa. He was convicted of trafficking heroin. An officer from the\nDepartment of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs advised the applicant\nthat his visa might be cancelled. The applicant was told that he would\nbe provided with an opportunity to comment and was advised of the matters\nto be taken into account, including the best interests of any children with\nwhom he was involved. The applicant responded and included a statement\nfrom the carer of the applicant’s children. An officer subsequently\nwrote to the applicant requesting contact details of the children’s\ncarer and stating that the respondent wished to contact the carer in\norder to assess the applicant’s relationship with his children.\nThe applicant duly provided the contact details. However, no further\nsteps were taken to contact the carer and the applicant’s visa was\nsubsequently cancelled by the respondent. In four concurring judgments,\nthe applicant’s appeal for substantive relief was dismissed. Two\nof the speeches did not consider the doctrine of legitimate expectation\nbut merely held that there was no denial of procedural fairness\non the facts. I turn now to the two speeches which touched on the\ndoctrine. 87     McHugh\nand Gummow JJ observed that the notion of “abuse of power” as applied\nin England appeared to be concerned with the judicial supervision\nof administrative decision-making by the application of certain minimum\nstandards and that it represented an attempted assimilation of doctrines\nderived from European civil systems (at [73]) into the English common\nlaw. However, civil systems are characterised by a close connection\nbetween the administrative and judicial functions, with administrative\njudges having administrative training and being alive to realities\nof administration (at [74]). Further, Australia has a written federal constitution\nwith separation of power and judicial power does not extend to the\nexecutive function of administration (at [76]). In the light of developments\nin Australian case law of the requirements of procedural fairness,\nthe doctrine of legitimate expectation does not have any distinct role\n(at [81]). The doctrine should be understood as being synonymous with\nnatural justice as merely indicating “the factors and kinds of factors which\nare relevant to any consideration of what are the things which must be\ndone or afforded”. If natural justice does not condition the exercise\nof power, the notion of legitimate expectation can have no role\nto play. Otherwise, the doctrine would “become a stalking horse\nfor excesses of judicial power” (at [82]). 88     Callinan\nJ opined that the expression “legitimate expectation” is unfortunate\nand misleading. The necessity for the invention of the doctrine is\nquestionable; the law of natural justice has evolved without the\nneed for recourse to any fiction of “legitimate expectation” (at\n[140]). When Lord Denning MR first articulated the expression, he\nwas doing no more than using it as a synonym for a right or interest.\n“Legitimate expectation” does not connote a freestanding or new\nright altogether (at [141]). If “legitimate expectation” were to\nremain part of Australian law, it would be better if it were applied\nonly in cases where there is an actual expectation (at [145]). On\nany view, the doctrine of “legitimate expectation” gives rise to\nonly procedural rights and cannot give rise to substantive rights\n(at [148]). 89     A\n3-2 majority of the judges in the High Court of Australia inEx p Lamhave thus held, albeitobiter, that the doctrine of legitimate\nexpectation is of questionable legitimacy and utility.Rush v Commissioner of Police(2006) 150\nFCR 165 (at [75] and [82]) andHabib v Commonwealth\n(No 2)(2009) 254 ALR 250 (at [70]) have subsequently\nconfirmed that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation\nis not recognised in Australian law. Canada 90     The\nseminal case in Canada is the Supreme Court decision ofCentre hospitalier Mont-Sinaï c Québec (Ministre\nde la Santé & des Services sociaux)[2001] 2 SCR\n281 (“Mount Sinai”).  The respondent,\nMount Sinai Hospital, originally dealt primarily with tuberculosis\npatients and only had long-term care facilities. They decided to\nmove from Quebec to Montreal. The hospital had, by that time, both\nshort-term and long-term beds and wanted to alter its permit to\nreflect this. The ministry promised to alter the permit after the\nmove to Montreal and this was reaffirmed by successive ministers.\nThe hospital moved and applied for its permit to be amended. However,\nits application was denied on the basis that it was no longer in\nthe public interest to have short-term beds. The court unanimously\nheld that the Minister was compelled to issue the amended permit.\nThere were two speeches. Bastarache J (with whom L'Heureux-Dubé,\nGonthier, Iacobucci, and Major JJ concurred) did not touch on the\ndoctrine of legitimate expectation. McLachlin CJC and Binnie J,\ninobiter, held that legitimate expectation\ncannot be used to ground substantive relief and that the doctrine\nof estoppel (which has more stringent requirements) should be used\nto ground substantive relief instead. 91     McLachlin\nCJC and Binnie J opined that the doctrine of legitimate expectation,\nas applied in England, performs a number of functions that are kept\ndistinct in Canada (at [24]). The doctrine has, in their view, developed into\na comprehensive code that embraces the full gamut of administrative relief,\nfrom procedural fairness to estoppel (not properly so-called) (at [26]).\nAt the high end, this represents a level of judicial intervention\nthat the Canadian courts have considered inappropriate (unless constitutional rights\nare implicated) (at [27]). Canadian cases have differentiated procedural\nfairness and legitimate expectation (at [28]). If the courts are\nto grant substantial relief, more demanding conditions precedent\nmust be fulfilled than are presently required by the doctrine of\nlegitimate expectation (at [32]). There are two further limitations:\nfirst, a purely ministerial decision, on broad grounds of public\npolicy, will typically afford the individual no procedural protection\nunless there has been an abuse of discretion (at [33]); secondly,\npublic bodies exercising legislative functions may not be amenable\nto judicial supervision (at [34]). However, estoppel may be available\nagainst a public authority in narrow circumstances (at [39]). In\nthis respect (at [42]), It is to be emphasized that the requirements\nof estoppel go well beyond the requirements of the doctrine of legitimate\nexpectations. As mentioned, the doctrine of legitimate expectations\ndoes not necessarily, though it may, involve personal knowledge\nby the applicant of the conduct of the public authority as well\nas reliance and detriment. Estoppel clearly elevates the evidentiary\nrequirements that must be met by an applicant. 92     The\ndoctrine of estoppel in the public law milieu, however, requires an\nappreciation of the legislative intent embodied in the power whose exercise\nis sought to be estopped. Therefore, circumstances that might otherwise\ncreate an estoppel may have to yield to an overriding public interest\nexpressed in the legislative text (at [47]). 93     The\nlatest pronouncement of the law as it currently stands in Canada is\ncontained in the 2013 Supreme Court case ofAgraira\nv Canada (Minster of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)(2013)\nCarswellNat 1983. In a unanimous judgment, the court reaffirmed\nthe principle that the doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot\ngive rise to substantive rights (at [97]). 94     To\nsum up, Canadian law does not grant substantive relief via the doctrine\nof legitimate expectations. Instead, an applicant seeking substantive\nrelief would have to rely on the doctrine of estoppel. Hong Kong 95     InNg Siu Tung & others v Director of Immigration[2002]\n1 HKLRD 561, the Court of Final Appeal emphatically held that the\ndoctrine of legitimate expectation can be a ground for substantive\nrelief. The case concerned constitutional challenges to certain\namendments made to the Immigration Ordinance. There were over 5000\nclaimants who made applications for legal aid to commence proceedings;\nin order to reduce the number of cases and costs, several cases\nwere chosen for a determination by the court of the common issues.\nThe government generally represented to the public that it would\nabide by the decisions of the courts. Some applicants receivedpro formareplies that the government\nwould abide by the decisions of the courts and that it was unnecessary\nto join in existing proceedings or commence fresh proceedings. The\ncases were successful in impugning the constitutionality of the\namendments. Legislation was then promulgated which prospectively\nreversed the successful cases. The legislation expressly stated\nthat it did not affect rights of abode which had been acquired pursuant\nto the judgments. The issue at stake was whether the applicants\nin the instant case were entitled to the acquired rights of abode,\nin the sense of them being in the same position as the successful parties. 96     The\nCourt of Final Appeal granted relief on the ground of substantive legitimate\nexpectation but only for the applicants who received specific representations\ninpro formareplies that it was\nunnecessary for them to join in existing proceedings or commence\nfresh proceedings. The entire court agreed that the doctrine of\nsubstantive legitimate expectation was part of Hong Kong law. 97     Li\nCJ, Chan and Riberio PJJ and Sir Anthony Mason NPJ, speaking for\na 4-1 majority, utilised the following framework: The doctrine of substantive legitimate\nexpectations recognizes that, in the absence of any overriding reason\nof law or policy excluding its operation, situations may arise in\nwhich persons may have a legitimate expectation of a substantive\noutcome or benefit, in which event failing to honour the expectation\nmay, in particular circumstances, result in such unfairness to individuals\nas to amount to an abuse of power justifying intervention by the court\n(at [92]): (a)    A\nlegitimate expectation arising from a promise or representation\nmade by or on behalf of a public authority must be taken into account\nin the decision-making process so long as to do so falls within\nthe power of the decision-maker (at [92] and [94]). (b)    Generally speaking, a representation\nmust be clear and unambiguous; if a representation is susceptible\nto multiple interpretations, the interpretation applied by the public\nauthority will be adopted (this interpretation is subject toWednesburyunreasonableness) (at [104]). (c)    The question of whether reliance is\nrequired was left open (at [109]). However, no issue as to reliance\noccurs if the representations are calculated to induce reliance\n(at [110]). (d)    Unless there are reasons recognised\nby law for not giving effect to legitimate expectations, then effect\nshould be given to them. Fairness requires the decision-maker to\ngive reasons if effect is not given to the expectation, so that\nsuch reasons may be tested in court (at [95]). (e)    Even if the decision involves the\nmaking of a political choice with reference to policy considerations,\nthe decision-maker must make the choice in the light of the legitimate\nexpectation of the parties (at [96]). If the decision-maker does\nnot take into account the legitimate expectation, the decision constitutes\nan abuse of power and will usually be vitiated by reason of failure\nto take account of a relevant consideration (at [97]). Singapore 98UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Jurong Town Corp[2011]\n3 SLR 94 (“UDL Marine”) concerned\na case where a tenant applied unsuccessfully to its landlord, a\nstatutory board, for the renewal of a lease. The application for leave\nfor judicial review was dismissed on the ground that the respondent’s act\nof not renewing the lease was not susceptible to judicial review\nbecause it was exercising itsprivatecontractual\nrights not to renew the lease. Lai Siu Chiu J commented,obiter, that both parties had not submitted\non the issue of legitimate expectation. Nevertheless, she doubted\nthat the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation was part\nof Singapore law because of the presence of competing tensions and\nher concern that the need to check against inconsistent treatment\nmust be balanced against the undesirable effects of excessively\nfettering administrative discretion (at [65] and [66]). 99     InBorissik Svetlana v Urban Redevelopment Authority[2009]\n4 SLR(R) 92 (“Borissik Svetlana”),\nthe applicant was a joint owner of a semi-detached house who applied\nfor leave for judicial review of the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s\ndecision to deny the applicant’s application for the construction\nof a detached bungalow. Leave was denied on the ground that the\napplicant had not exhausted all her remedies before applying for judicial\nreview. Tan Lee Meng J nevertheless found,obiter,\nthat the applicant could not point to any promise made to her by\na person with actual or ostensible authority. Tan J went on to state\n(at [49]): [De Smith’s Judicial\nReview(Sweet & Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2007) lists four conditions\nfor the creation of a legitimate expectation, namely that the expectation\nmust be: (i)    clear,\nunambiguous and devoid of relevant qualification; (ii)   induced by the conduct of the decision\nmaker; (iii)   made by a person with actual or\nostensible authority; and (iv)   applicable to the applicants, who\nbelong to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably\nexpected to apply. It is unclear if Tan J was referring to a procedural or substantive\nlegitimate expectation. However, at [46], Tan J said: Finally, the applicant's claim that she\nhad a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop No 2\nwould be approvedwill be considered.\n[emphasis added] The above passage seems to suggest that Tan J had procedural,\nrather than substantive, legitimate expectation in mind. 100    The\nCourt of Appeal case ofYong Vui Kong v Attorney-General[2011]\n2 SLR 1189 (“Yong Vui Kong”) concerned\nan appellant who was convicted of a drug trafficking offence and\nsentenced to death. In a concurring judgment, Andrew Phang and V\nK Rajah JJA addressed the appellant’s argument that a legitimate\nexpectation had arisen that it is the President who would make the\ndecision as to whether the appellant would be pardoned. CitingRegina v Director of Public Prosecutions, Ex parte Kebilene[2000]\n2 AC 326, they held that such a legitimate expectation could not\narise on the facts because clear statutory words will override any expectation.\nIn this respect, Art 22P(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of\nSingapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) clearly states that the President shall\nact “on the advice of the Cabinet”. 101    Prior\ncase law has thus not addressed, head-on, the issue of whether the\ndoctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is part of Singapore\nlaw. Lai J inUDL Marinedid not\nhave any submissions on this issue before her and doubted that the\ndoctrine existed. Tan J inBorissik Svetlanaostensibly had\nprocedural, rather than substantive, legitimate expectation in mind when\nhe cited a framework espoused in the sixth edition ofDe Smith. Andrew Phang and V K Rajah JJA\ninYong Vui Kongdid not address\nthe issue of whether substantive legitimate expectation is part\nof Singapore law. They dismissed the appellant’s argument on the\nbasis that no substantive legitimate expectation could have arisen\non the facts. Summary of respective submissions 102    The\napplicant here relied chiefly onBorissik Svetlanafor\nthe proposition that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation\nhas received implicit judicial recognition in Singapore. The applicant\nsubmitted that Tan J had in that case assumed that judicial review\ncould be used to protection legitimate expectations of substantive\nbenefit. The applicant further contended that a legitimate expectation\narose on the facts. Firstly, the SLA Circulars and the SLA website\nconstituted clear and unambiguous representations that the DP would\nbe computed on the basis of the DC Table. Secondly, in deciding\nwhether to acquire the Land and in determining the appropriate price\nit was willing to pay, the applicant was induced by the representations.\nThirdly, the SLA Circulars and the SLA website were circulated by\na person with actual or ostensible authority. Lastly, the applicant\nbelonged to the class of persons to whom the representations were\nreasonably expected to apply. The applicant also argued that there\nwas no way for it to discover that the SLA had considered directly-alienated\nland to be an exception to the prescribed method of assessment.\nThere was no publicly available document which stated that directly-alienated\nland was an exception to the prescribed method of assessment. There\nwas in fact no way for the applicant to find out that the Land was\ndirectly alienated to its former owner. The Land Return Clauses in\nthe two lease documents merely state that the DP would be payable\nin accordance with the DP Clauses. The DP Clause is found in all\nstate leases and there is therefore nothing to disturb the applicant’s\nunderstanding that the DP would be assessed in accordance with the\nDC Table. 103    The\nSLA relied onUDL Marinefor the\nproposition that the High Court had, in that case, doubted the existence\nof the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation in our law.\nThe SLA, however, conceded that local jurisprudence has not definitively\npronounced whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation\nis part of Singapore law. The SLA submitted that the reasons for\nand against the said doctrine are finely balanced. In England, the\ndoctrine is hedged with qualifications. Even then, the English approach\nwas categorically rejected by the Australian High Court inEx p Lam, where the court found that the\nEnglish position did not sit well with the Australian constitutional\nframework. The SLA also asserted that no expectations whatsoever\narose in this case. The threshold for a representation that is clear,\nunambiguous and devoid of qualification is a high one. Further,\nthe applicant in fact already knew or ought to have known that the\nDP in its case would be assessed via a spot valuation by the Chief\nValuer at 100% in enhancement in land value. There were media releases\nconcerning the redevelopment of a property located at Market Street.\nAny reasonable developer would have noticed that the leases contained\na special covenant — the Land Return Clause — which is not ordinarily\nfound in other State leases. 104    The\nAttorney-General argued that the doctrine of substantive legitimate\nexpectation should not be adopted in Singapore for three reasons.\nFirst, the doctrine was developed in England against the backdrop of\nthe Human Rights Act 1998 and the pressure to assimilate European doctrine\ninto the common law. Second, the underlying rationale of the doctrine\nis that of abuse of power, which is not principled. Third, the doctrine\nis inconsistent with the doctrine of separation of powers as enshrined\nin the Singapore Constitution. In any event, no legitimate expectation\narose on the facts. There was no clear, unambiguous or unqualified\nrepresentation. The SLA Circulars were directed to the general public\nand did not have the character of a contract. There was also no inducement. My decision on the doctrine\nof legitimate expectation 105    The\nabove analysis (at [97] to [100]) shows that case law in Singapore has\nnot addressed directly the issue of whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate\nexpectations is part of Singapore law. The separation of powers 106    Both\nthe SLA and the Attorney-General placed especial emphasis on the\ncases ofEx p LamandMount Sinai.  I shall deal with both cases\nin turn. 107    Both\nthe SLA and the Attorney-General relied onEx\np Lamfor the proposition that the doctrine of substantive\nlegitimate expectation was influenced by European law and is inconsistent\nwith the Australian Constitution and, more specifically, the separation\nof powers. As Singapore and Australia both have written constitutions,\nthe reasoning inEx p Lamalso applies\nto Singapore. 108    As\na preliminary matter, I note that this line of reasoning was present in\nonly McHugh and Gummow JJ’s speech and thus did not command the assent\nof the majority of the court. Gleeson CJ and Hayne J, in separate speeches,\ndid not consider the question of whether the doctrine of substantive\nlegitimate expectation ought to be part of Australian law. Callinan\nJ opined that the said doctrine is not part of Australian law but\ndid not cite the Australian Constitution and the separation of powers\nas a reason for this holding (see [87] above). This line of reasoning\nwas also not adopted by the Canadian Supreme Court inMount Sinai. 109    Secondly,\nalthough European law may have influenced English law, is the English\nsystem of government, with its unwritten Constitution, fundamentally\ndifferent from the Singaporean and Australian systems of government\nwith their written Constitutions? Implicit in the SLA’s and the Attorney-General’s\nargument is that a written constitution is a pre-requisite for the\nseparation of powers. According to this argument, the written constitutions\nof Australia and Singapore explicitly demarcate the powers that\nare to be allocated to the legislative, executive and judicial branches respectively\nand it would therefore tantamount to judicial overreach for the judiciary\nto enforce substantive legitimate expectations. However, it is clear that\nthe UK system, despite the absence of a written constitution, also recognises\nthe separation of powers. In the House of Lords decision ofRegina v Secretary of State for the Home Department,\nEx parte Fire Brigades Union and others[1995] 2 AC 513\n(“Ex p Fire Brigades”), Lord Keith\nof Kinkel said (at 567D – E): It is a feature of\nthe peculiarly British conception of the separation of powers that\nParliament, the executive and the courts have each their distinct\nand largely exclusive domain.Parliament has a legally unchallengeable\nright to make whatever laws it thinks right. The executive carries\non the administration of the country in accordance with the powers conferred\non it by law. The courts interpret the laws, and see that they are obeyed.This requires the courts on occasion to step into\nthe territory which belongs to the executive, to verify not only\nthat the powers asserted accord with the substantive law created\nby Parliament but also that the manner in which they are exercised\nconforms with the standards of fairness which Parliament must have\nintended.Concurrently with this judicial function Parliament\nhas its own special means of ensuring that the executive, in the\nexercise of delegated functions, performs in a way which Parliament\nfinds appropriate. [emphasis added in bold and in italics] 110    As\na side-note, this case was decided when the House of Lords was still\nfunctioning as a court of law, 14 years before the establishment\nof the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in 2009 which formalized\nthe separation of the legislative and the judicial functions of\nthe House of Lords in order to comply with the European Convention\non Human Rights. In this respect, I refer to a consultation paper\nentitledConstitutional Reform: A Supreme Court\nfor the United Kingdom(July 2003, CP11/03) (available\nat http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf,\nlast accessed 28 October 2013) (at para 3): It is not always understood\nthat the decisions of the ‘House of Lords’ are in practice decisions\nof the Appellate Committee and that non judicial members of the\nHouse never take part in the judgments. Nor is the extent to which\nthe Law Lords themselves have decided to refrain from getting involved\nin political issues in relation to legislation on which they might later\nhave to adjudicate always appreciated.The fact that\nthe Lord Chancellor, as the Head of the Judiciary, was entitled\nto sit in the Appellate and Judicial Committees and did so as Chairman,\nadded to the perception that their independence might be compromised\nby the arrangements.The Human Rights Act,\nspecifically in relation to Article 6 of the European Convention\non Human Rights, now requires a stricter view to be taken not only of\nanything which might undermine the independence or impartiality\nof a judicial tribunal, but even of anything which might appear\nto do so.[emphasis added in bold and in italics] 111    It\ncannot be argued, therefore, that the doctrine of substantive legitimate\nexpectation should not be law in Singapore simply because Singapore\nhas a written constitution while England, which recognises the doctrine,\ndoes not. Instead, this issue should be looked at from first principles. 112    If\nprivate individuals are expected to fulfil what they have promised, why\nshould a public authority be permitted to renege on its promises\nor ignore representations made by it? If an individual or a corporation\nmakes plans in reliance on existing publicized representations made\nby a public authority, there appears no reason in principle why\nsuch reliance should not be protected. 113    The\nupholding of legitimate expectations is eminently within the powers\nof the judiciary. In the context of private law, this is expressed through\nthe enforcement of contracts (which upholds bargains freely made) and\nthe equitable doctrine of estoppel (which upholds the reliance interest of\na representee if a representor resiles from his representation inequitably). However,\nin the public law sphere, in deciding whether a legitimate expectation\nought to be upheld, the court must remember that there are concerns\nand interests larger than the private expectation of an individual or\na corporation. If there is a public interest which overrides the expectation,\nthen the expectation ought not to be given effect to. In this way,\nI believe the judiciary can fulfil its constitutional role without arrogating\nto itself the unconstitutional position of being a super-legislature or\na super-executive. 114    In\nmy view, there ought to be no difference in principle between procedural\nand substantive legitimate expectations. The reasons enumerated\nabove do not distinguish between the procedural and the substantive\nand apply equally to both. 115    In\npractice, it may be difficult to distinguish between the procedural and\nsubstantive. This was acknowledged inMount\nSinai(at [35]): In affirming that the doctrine of legitimate\nexpectations is limited to procedural relief, it must be acknowledged\nthat in some cases it is difficult to distinguish the procedural\nfrom the substantive. In Bendahmane v. Canada, supra, for example,\na majority of the Federal Court of Appeal considered the applicant's\nclaim to the benefit of a refugee backlog reduction program to be procedural\n(p. 33) whereas the dissenting judge considered the claimed relief to\nbe substantive (p. 25). A similarly close call was made in Canada\n(Attorney General) v. Canada (Commissioner of the Inquiry on the\nBlood System), [1996] 3 F.C. 259 (T.D.). An undue focus on formal\nclassification and categorization of powers at the expense of broad\nprinciples flexibly applied may do a disservice here. The inquiry\nis better framed in terms of the underlying principle mentioned\nearlier, namely that broad public policy is pre-eminently for the\nMinister to determine, not the courts. 116    The\nSLA and the Attorney-General referred, in particular, to [27] and [28]\nofMount Sinaito buttress their\nargument that the doctrine of legitimate expectation should not\nbe recognised in Singapore. The two paragraphs cited are as follow: 27    In\nranging over such a vast territory under the banner of \"fairness\",\nit is inevitable that sub-classifications must be made to differentiate\nthe situations which warrant highly intrusive relief from those\nwhich do not. Many of the English cases on legitimate expectations\nrelied on by the respondents, at the low end, would fit comfortably\nwithin our principles of procedural fairness. At the high end they\nrepresent a level of judicial intervention in government policy\nthat our courts, to date, have considered inappropriate in the absence of\na successful challenge under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 28    Canadian cases tend to differentiate\nfor analytical purposes the related concepts of procedural fairness\nand the doctrine of legitimate expectation. There is, on the one\nhand, a concern that treating procedural fairness as a subset of\nlegitimate expectations may unnecessarily complicate and indeed inhibit\nrather than encourage the development of the highly flexible rules\nof procedural fairness: D. Wright, \"Rethinking the Doctrine of Legitimate Expectations\nin Canadian Administrative Law\" (1997), 35 Osgoode Hall L.J. 139.\nOn the other hand, there is a countervailing concern that using\na Minister's prior conduct against him as a launching pad for substantive\nrelief may strike the wrong balance between private and public interests,\nand blur the role of the court with the role of the Minister. 117    The\ntwo paragraphs, read in isolation, seem to suggest that substantive\nrelief is denied as a matter of course because of a perceived need to\nrein in inappropriate judicial intervention and that the doctrine\nof legitimate expectations has no place in Canadian law. The procedural aspect\nof the doctrine is better analysed as a matter of procedural fairness, while\nthe substantive aspect is better analysed as a matter of promissory estoppel.\nHowever, at [31], McLachlin CJC and Binnie J stated: It is difficult at one and the same time\nthus to lower the bar to the application of the doctrine of legitimate\nexpectation (for good policy reasons) but at the same time to expand\ngreatly its potency for overruling the Minister or other public\nauthority on matters of substantive policy. One would normally expect more\nintrusive forms of relief to be accompanied by more demanding evidentiary\nrequirements. The court proceeded to state that promissory estoppel is available\nagainst a public authority. Promissory estoppel is to be preferred\nto legitimate expectations because the requirements for granting\nrelief under promissory estoppel are more stringent than those for\nlegitimate expectations (at [42]): It is to be emphasized that the requirements\nof estoppel go well beyond the requirements of the doctrine of legitimate\nexpectations.As mentioned, the doctrine of\nlegitimate expectations does not necessarily, though it may, involve\npersonal knowledge by the applicant of the conduct of the public authority\nas well as reliance and detriment.Estoppel clearly elevates\nthe evidentiary requirements that must be met by an applicant. [emphasis\nadded] 118    The\ndifference between the two doctrines would therefore appear to be\nthe requirements of proof of an applicant’s personal knowledge together with\nactual reliance and detriment. The Canadian court was therefore\nnot denying substantive relief altogether but was amenable to granting\nit in a less liberal fashion, with an applicant having to prove\ncertain matters to the satisfaction of the court. The doctrine and its requirements 119    In\nmy opinion, the doctrine of legitimate expectation should be recognised\nin our law as a stand-alone head of judicial review and substantive\nrelief should be granted under the doctrine subject to certain safeguards.\nHaving regard to the case law from the various common law jurisdictions\nand applying some commonsensical principles, I believe the doctrine\ncan operate effectively and fairly in the following manner without the\ncourt overstepping its judicial role: (a)     The\napplicant must prove that the statement or representation made by\nthe public authority was unequivocal and unqualified; (i)       If the statement or representation is open to more than one\nnatural interpretation, the interpretation applied by the public\nauthority will be adopted; and (ii)       The presence of a disclaimer or non-reliance clause would cause\nthe statement or representation to be qualified. (b)     The\napplicant must prove the statement or representation was made by\nsomeone with actual or ostensible authority to do so on behalf of\nthe public authority; (c)     The\napplicant must prove that the statement or representation was made\nto him or to a class of persons to which he clearly belongs; (d)     The\napplicant must prove that it was reasonable for him to rely on the\nstatement or representation in the circumstances of his case. (i)       If the applicant knew that the statement or representation was\nmade in error and chose to capitalize on the error, he will not\nbe entitled to any relief; (ii)       Similarly, if he suspected that the statement or representation\nwas made in error and chose not to seek clarification when he could\nhave done so, he will not be entitled to any relief; (iii)       If there is reason and opportunity to\nmake enquiries and the applicant did not, he will not be entitled\nto any relief. (e)     The\napplicant must prove that he did rely on the statement or representation\nand that he suffered a detriment as a result; (f)     Even\nif all the above requirements are met, the court should nevertheless\nnot grant relief if: (i)       Giving effect to the statement or representation will result in\na breach of the law or the State’s international obligations; (ii)       Giving effect to the statement or representation will infringe\nthe accrued rights of some member of the public; (iii)       The public authority can show an overriding\nnational or public interest which justifies the frustration of the\napplicant’s expectation. Application of the doctrine’s\nrequirements to the facts 120    I\nshall first deal with the statements or representations set out\nin the SLA website. The use of the website is governed by its Terms\nof Use (see [9] above) which explicitly state that “the SLA does\nnot make any representations or warranties whatsoever” including\n“any representations or warranties as to the accuracy, completeness,\nreliability, timeliness, currentness, quality or fitness for any\nparticular purpose of the Contents of this Site”. The representations\nset out in the SLA website were therefore qualified and cannot found\na claim for substantive relief under the doctrine of legitimate\nexpectation. Faced with such a wide disclaimer, the applicant should\nhave written to the SLA to confirm its alleged understanding of\nhow the policy would work in practice and, more specifically, how\nit would impact the particular transaction that the applicant was\ncontemplating getting into. It did not do so and cannot now claim\nrelief under the doctrine. 121    I\nnext consider the SLA Circulars. The SLA Circulars were circulated to\nthe public at large. However, realistically speaking, the only people\nwho would have read (or would be expected to read) the SLA Circulars\nwere property developers or their advisors. The applicant, a property\ndeveloper, is clearly within the class of persons that the SLA Circulars\nwere targeted at. 122    The\nSLA Circulars did contain unequivocal and unqualified statements\nor representations. The 2000 SLA Circular stated that the “determination\nof DP will be based on the published [DC Table] rates”. The 2007\nSLA Circular reiterated this by its statement that the “determination\nof DP will still be based on the published [DC Table] rates”. Both\ncirculars also enumerated certain exceptions to the applicability\nof DC Table: where the use as spelt out in the particular title\nrestriction does not fit into any of the use groups and where the\nlease tenure is upgraded (only the 2000 Circular).  The two Circulars\nstated that the SLA reserves the right to determine if title restrictions\nshould be lifted. However this does not mean that the SLA also reserves\nthe further right to deviate from the DC Table if title restrictions are\nindeed lifted. Both Circulars did not state that there might be\nother unpublished exceptions or policies. 123    There\nwas no dispute that the SLA Circulars and the SLA website were published\nby or with the authority of the SLA. 124    The\napplicant must prove that it was reasonable for him to rely on the statement\nor representation. The applicant must also prove that he did rely on\nthe statement or representation and that he suffered a detriment\nas a result. The applicant averred that it had relied upon the representation\nin the SLA Circulars that DC Table rates would apply in purchasing\nthe land. It would appear therefore that reliance was placed on\nthe SLA’s publications and if the applicant now has to pay a much\nhigher DP than was represented, there would definitely be detriment\ncaused to the applicant. However, was it reasonable for the applicant\nto have relied on the SLA’s publications in the circumstances of\nthis case? 125    The\nLand Return Clause (present in the leases of both Plots) (see [4] above)\nprovided that the applicant as lessee was obliged to notify the\nlessor, the Singapore Government, if the land in question was not\nused for the purposes specified. Upon notification, the Government\nwould have a year to decide whether or not to buy over the land\nat Land Acquisition Act (Cap 152, 1985 Rev Ed) rates. Such rates\nmight turn out to be lower than the price which the land would have\nfetched in the market, simply because potential purchasers would\nhave paid a higher price in the anticipation of getting approval\nfor a change of the use of the land or for an increase in the plot\nratio. In particular, s 33(5)(e)\nof the Land Acquisition Act explicitly states that: the market value of the acquired land shall\nbe deemed not to exceed the price which a bona fide purchaser might\nreasonably be willing to pay, after taking into account the zoning\nand density requirements and any other restrictions imposed by or\nunder the Planning Act (Cap. 232) as at the date of acquisition and\nany restrictive covenants in the title of the acquired land, andno account shall be taken of any potential value\nof the land for any other use more intensive than that permitted\nby or under the Planning Act as at the date of acquisition.[emphasis\nadded] The applicant in purchasing the Land took upon itself the\nrisk of compulsory acquisition which, if it had occurred, could\nhave resulted in a huge loss. 126    The\nSLA furnished evidence that the Land Return Clause was present in\nonly 242 State leases, representing only 1.25% of the total number\nof State leases. The applicant, an experienced property developer,\nwould have known that the Land Return Clause was peculiar and atypical\nof State leases. The applicant tried to understate this by arguing\nthat the Land Return Clause merely referred back to the DP Clause\nfor the computation of the DP payable and that it was therefore\nunaware of the significance of the Land Return Clause. I was not\nconvinced by this. The Land Return Clause should have alerted an\nexperienced property developer like the applicant to the fact that\nthe Land was not under a “normal” State lease. 127    It\nwas widely reported in the local media in 2008 that Capitaland had to\npay a DP equivalent to 100% of the enhancement in land value to redevelop\nthe Market Street Car Park. At the hearing, the applicant tried\nto downplay this by saying that it understood 100% of the enhancement\nin land value to mean 100% of the enhancement in land value as indicated\nby the DC Table (because the convention after the 2007 SLA Circular\nwas to charge 70%, an increase from the 50% payable under the 2000\nSLA Circular). I accept that the local media reports did not state\nthe method upon which the 100% enhancement in value was calculated.\nHowever, the press release by Capitaland on 3 January 2008 (almost\ntwo years before Lot 1338M was acquired), stated that the said redevelopment\nwas subject to two conditions, one of which was “the payment by\nthe lessee (CCT) of 100% of the enhancement in land value as assessed\nby the Chief Valuer in a spot valuation”. 128    Considering\nthe evidence cumulatively, the irresistible inference is that the\napplicant ought to have known that the DP for the Land would not be\nassessed according to the DC Table. At the very least, the applicant should\nhave written to the SLA to ask if DC Table rates would be applied\nto State leases which contain the Land Return Clause, especially\nin the light of the widely-reported Market Street Car Park redevelopment.\nIn fact, the applicant started construction work sometime after\n8 April 2011 and before the SLA letter dated 29 November 2011, where\nthe SLA first approved the lifting of title restrictions and stated\nthat the DP would be assessed at 100% of the enhancement in land\nvalue in a spot valuation. The construction costs could very easily\nhave been incurred for nothing had the SLA not given approval for\nthe lifting of title restrictions in the first place. 129    As\nan experienced property developer going into a multi-million dollar\ntransaction, it was therefore not reasonable for the applicant to\nhave relied solely on the SLA’s publications in the circumstances\nof this case. It was in the business of making money from land development.\nIt had many professional advisors and could have easily checked\nwith the SLA on what the DP would be if it decided to buy the Land\nand embark on its redevelopment plans. In any case, the SLA had\nmade it clear in its correspondence with the applicant that the\nDP was assessed without reference to the DC Table. 130    Assuming\nthat the applicant had satisfied the first five requirements (which\nit clearly had not) for invoking the doctrine of legitimate expectation\nto claim relief, there would still be the safeguards in the sixth requirement\nto consider. As the SLA has rightfully pointed out, it is under\na statutory duty to “optimise land resources” (s 6(1)(a) of the SLA Act) and to “have regard\nto efficiency and economy and to the social, industrial and commercial\nand economic needs of Singapore” in the carrying out of its functions\n(s 6(2)(a) of the SLA Act). Its\nstatutory duty would encompass getting the best returns for the\nState when it deals with State land. This would in turn benefit\nthe public at large. It is therefore unacceptable in the circumstances\nhere to argue that the State’s finances would not suffer as much\nas the applicant’s if the SLA were to make an exception for this\ncase and not apply its unpublished policy relating to directly-alienated\nState land to the Land here. The overriding public interest must\ntherefore prevail over the financial interests of a commercial enterprise\nlike the applicant in this case.",
        "Conclusion and costs": "131    The\napplicant has failed to show irrationality on the part of the SLA\nor to establish a legitimate expectation on the facts of this case.\nAccordingly, its application for judicial review on these grounds\nis dismissed. 132    The\napplicant is to pay the costs of the SLA and of the Attorney-General,\nsuch costs to be agreed or taxed. The parties may also agree that the\ncosts be fixed by me. In that event, I will fix the amount of costs\nafter hearing their submissions on the appropriate quantum to award."
