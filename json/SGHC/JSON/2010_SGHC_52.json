        "The Accused": "8       Some personal data of the Accused is set out in the Statement of Facts,ie, that he is 59 years old, single and he worked irregularly as an odd job labourer. 9       After he was arrested, the Accused was examined by psychiatrist Dr Kenneth G W W Koh of the Institute of Mental Health. Dr Koh found that the Accused’s IQ was between 66–74, in the range bordering the upper limit of mild mental retardation and the lower limit of borderline intelligence, and that clinically he appeared to be in the borderline range.[note: 1] 10     He has a record of convictions between 1968 and 2008 for offences which fell into three categories: (a) offences against property; (b) possession and consumption of drugs; and (c) causing grievous hurt.[note: 2]",
        "The mitigation plea": "11     Counsel pleaded that:[note: 3] [The Accused] took pity on the victim on the fateful day when he noticed the young boy sleeping at the playground. He invited him to his house and offered him a place to spend the night as he did not want a young boy sleeping in the playground alone. His subsequent conduct was a result of the alcohol he consumed and his failure to appreciate the consequence of his actions.",
        "The Prosecution’s submissions on sentence": "12     The Prosecution submitted that there were aggravating factors which should be taken into consideration in sentencing: (a)     The Accused had inflicted extreme physical pain on the Victim on both occasions. The Accused also morally degraded the Victim by teaching him how to perform the revolting act of fellatio on him;[note: 4] (b)     The Accused is a hardened criminal with numerous convictions over 40 years between 1968 and 2008;[note: 5] (c)     The Accused had been eyeing the Victim as a potential target for several days before he moved in to execute his plan of subjecting the Victim to sexual abuse;[note: 6] (d)     The Accused had abused the position of trust of the Victim and exploited the age gap between them;[note: 7]and (e)     The Accused had preyed on a victim who was functioning at the mild mental retardation range of intelligence.[note: 8]",
        "Review of the aggravating factors": "13     Aggravating factors that are to be taken into consideration for sentencing have to be well-founded, and I have some reservations on some of those mentioned.",
        "The pain experienced": "14     Although the Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence referred to “extreme physical pain”, the term used in the Statement of Facts[note: 9]and by the Victim was “very painful”. Defence counsel also pointed out that there were no physical injuries revealed in the medical report,[note: 10]and no physical injury was mentioned by the Victim when he gave evidence in court.",
        "The Accused’s criminal record": "15     The Accused’s previous convictions were for offences against property, causing hurt, and drug possession and consumption. There were no convictions for sexual offences or offences against young persons. As V K Rajah J stated inPublic Prosecutor v NF[2006] 4 SLR(R) 849 at [69], when he was sentencing an accused person who had previous convictions for housebreaking and theft, and drug trafficking and consumption for rape, previous convictions for dissimilar offences were of no direct relevance for the purpose of sentencing.",
        "The Accused eyeing the Victim as a potential target": "16     The Statement of Facts stated at para 7 that: On or about 14 March 2007, sometime in the early morning, the Accused approached the Victim whilst he was sleeping at the playground. The Accused noticed that the Victim had been sleeping at the playground at Block 8, Jalan Kukoh for many days. The Accused asked the Victim why he was sleeping there. The Victim told the Accused that he had been chased out of his home by his mother’s boyfriend. The Accused then asked the Victim whether he would like to stay with him, to which the Victim agreed. The Accused then brought the Victim back to his Flat and took him under his care by offering shelter to the Victim. It was not alleged that the Accused had been eyeing the Victim as a potential target for several days, and that did not form any part of the case against him.",
        "The Accused preyed on the Victim functioning at the mild mental retardation range of intelligence": "17     The Accused may not have been aware of the Victim’s intellectual deficiency because: (a)     According to Dr Cai Yiming’s report, the Victim had impressed him as a “friendly and verbal boy who could give an account of the alleged offence”. I observed the Victim and heard his evidence in court, and he was composed and articulate, and the only problem he encountered was that he was saying “private part” and “backside” when he should have been more specific and say “penis” and “anus”. (b)     As noted by Dr Kenneth G W W Koh, the Accused himself has an IQ in the range bordering the upper limit of mild mental retardation and the lower limit of borderline intelligence. It is doubtful that he was himself able to detect the Victim’s mild mental retardation on the morning of 14 March 2007. Thus, the Prosecution’s assertion that the Accused had preyed on the Victim, taking advantage of the latter’s low IQ was not made out.",
        "Matters taken into consideration": "18     The offences that the Accused admitted to committing involved the sexual abuse of a young person for which the maximum sentence is a fine not exceeding $4,000, or imprisonment not exceeding four years, or both, under s 5(5) of the CYPA. 19     The CYPA was amended in 2001 and s 5 was introduced through that amendment. Prior to the amendment, acts of cruelty to children and young persons were offences under s 4 of the Act, but that section did not specifically refer to sexual abuse. 20     A review of the available precedents show that cases of sexual abuse of children and young persons were prosecuted under the old s 377 of the Penal Code which was repealed on 1 February 2008, and not under the old s 4 or the current s 5 of the CYPA. Consequently, there are no sentencing precedents for offences of sexual abuse prosecuted under those sections of the CYPA. 21     As an act constituting an offence under s 5 of the CYPA may also constitute an offence under the old s 377 of the Penal Code which dealt with the offence of carnal intercourse against the order of nature, the factors to be taken into consideration in sentencing for offences under that provision can also apply to offences of sexual abuse under s 5 of the CYPA. 22     InLim Hock Hin Kelvin v Public Prosecutor[1998] 1 SLR(R) 37 which dealt with sentencing tariffs for offences under the old ss 377 and 377A, the Court of Appeal ruled that: 21 In considering the appropriate tariffs for sentences, the gravity of the offence and the circumstances in which the offence was committed had to be taken into account: (a) Harm to the victims: The harm to the victims includes both the physical and the emotional harm. The physical injury may be caused as the direct result of penetration of the victim's anus (as in this case), which may be exceedingly painful. Where the victims are very young, it may leave them for life with embarrassing disabilities … In addition, the victims are exposed to the risk of sexually-transmitted diseases. What is of greater concern is that violence or threats of violence may be used to compel the victims to submit to the offender. Where violence or threats of injury are used, the punishment should be more severe to deter offenders from reoffending. The long-term emotional harm and psychological scars to the victims cannot be underestimated, though there has been caution in R v Willis (1974) 60 Cr App R 146 that the courts should not readily assume that the victims will later develop homosexuality in life because they have been sexually abused when young. Much will also depend on the support the victims receive from their families. (b) Social danger: Paedophilic offences are by their nature unpleasant and most distressing and the society has to express its marked disapproval for such harm to the young and vulnerable victims. The presumption is that the safety of the child must be paramount and chronic paedophiles who have a propensity to reoffend, because they are either totally unable or unwilling to control themselves, have to be put away for long periods. The Court went on to state that: 25 We considered the relevant circumstances of the offence in placing a particular offence according to its relative gravity: (a) Abuse of trust and authority: Where an offender is placed in a position of trust by the parents or by the victims, the breach of trust justifies a substantial sentence on the ground of general deterrence. All those who have charge of children cannot abuse their positions for the sake of gratifying their sexual urges. (b) Moral corruption: Where the offender has enticed or cajoled the victims to indulge in unnatural carnal intercourse by the promise of gifts (for example, money) this has a very corrupting effect on the young victims, especially adolescents: R v Willis. This should be reflected by a more severe sentence. It is necessary to ascertain if these factors apply in the present case.",
        "Harm to the Victim": "23     The offences did not result in any injury or disability to the Victim, and there was no violence or threat of violence used or directed at him, and he was not found to have suffered any emotional harm.",
        "Social danger": "24     The psychiatric examination of the Accused and his criminal record did not show him to be a paedophile or a serial sexual offender.",
        "Abuse of trust and authority": "25     The Accused did not stand in a position of trust and authority in relationship to the Victim. They were strangers before 14 March 2007, and the hold that the Accused had over the Victim was that he had invited him to his flat so that he would not have to spend the night at the playground or void deck. The Victim was not dependent on the Accused in any way, and could have rejected the latter’s offer, or left the flat when he made the overtures.",
        "Moral corruption": "26     There is no suggestion that the Victim is now disposed to engaging in anal intercourse or fellatio, or has continued with these practices as a means to obtain money. It was also never part of the Prosecution’s case that the Accused had enticed or cajoled the Victim into engaging in the sexual acts by promising him gifts or money.",
        "Sentencing considerations": "27     The Accused had anal intercourse with the Victim and caused him to perform fellatio on him. The commission of such acts on children and young persons cannot be condoned, and offenders will not be dealt with leniently. 28     In determining the appropriate sentence, on one hand, I did not consider that sentences at the high end of the range of up to four years’ imprisonment were appropriate because: (a)the Accused’s IQ is at the lower limit of borderline intelligence;(b)the Accused had not abused any position of trust or authority vis-à-vis the Victim, nor did he use or threaten violence on the Victim;(c)the Accused had pleaded guilty as soon as he was presented with the amended charges; and(d)the Victim did not suffer any residual physical or psychological injury.29     On the other hand, I did not think that sentences at the lower end of the range were appropriate because three offences were committed, and anal intercourse and fellatio were performed.30     In imposing sentence, I also took into account the fact that the three offences took place in one episode (or “the Sexual Incident”, as it was described in the Statement of Facts in the heading to paras 14 and 15) without any resistance or protest from the Victim.31     I sentenced the Accused to 18 months’ imprisonment for each of the three offences with the sentences for the first and second offences of anal intercourse and fellatio running consecutively, and the sentence for the third offence of anal intercourse running concurrently with the first two sentences.32     In imposing the sentences, I intended the Accused to serve three years’ imprisonment, which I consider to be appropriate in all the circumstances.[note: 1]Report of Dr Kenneth G W W Koh[note: 2]Memorandum of Certified Previous Convictions, Exhibit N[note: 3]Plea-in-mitigation, p 2[note: 4]Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence, para 6[note: 5]Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence, para 8[note: 6]Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence, para 9[note: 7]Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence, para 10[note: 8]Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence, para 13[note: 9]Statement of Facts, paras 10 and 12[note: 10]Plea-in-mitigation, p 3"
