        "(ii) The defendants’ expert": "49. The repairers called Mr Ronald Mervin Pereira as their expert\n\nwitness. Mr Pereira is a qualified marine engineer and is presently a consultant and a\n\ndirector of RIS Technical Services (S) Pte Ltd. He obtained a first class engineering\n\ncertificate of competency in July 1967 and after sailing as a third engineer and as a\n\nsecond engineer for five years, became a marine surveyor and consultant. He has had 34\n\nyears experience in this field.50. Mr Pereira was appointed in November 2001 by the repairers’\n\nsolicitors to review all pertinent documents and information including affidavits of\n\nevidence-in-chief and pleadings relating to the breakdown of the main engine of the vessel\n\nin March 1995. On the basis of all this information he prepared and submitted a report on\n\n19 December 2001 giving his opinion on the cause of the main engine breakdown.51. Mr Pereira first recited the details of the work carried out by the\n\nrepairers and noted that upon re-assembly of the main engine, it had undergone successful\n\nmooring and sea trials before returning to operation. In his opinion the works were\n\ncarried out specifically to comply with the classification society’s requirements and\n\nalthough all cylinder heads were overhauled together with the fuel pumps and injectors,\n\nthe scope of the work was insufficient to result in significant improvement of the\n\nperformance of the main engine.52. Mr Pereira considered that although the vessel was class maintained\n\nat the commencement of the voyage to Haiphong she was unseaworthy in view of the fact that\n\nthe main engine sump had been refilled with unserviceable lubricating oil. In his opinion,\n\nthe act of reusing the previously used lubricating oil, which had been removed from the\n\nmain engine sump for the purpose of cleaning it, initiated the sequence of accelerated\n\nwear of the crankshaft bearings during the sea trials (after re-assembly of the engine),\n\nwhich culminated in the seizure of no. 3 piston in its cylinder liner on 21 March 1995\n\nwhile the vessel was on loaded voyage to Haiphong.53. In Mr Pereira’s opinion, the seizure of no. 3 piston was\n\ncaused by overheating, brought about by inadequate piston cooling which probably arose\n\nfrom the blockage of the lubricating oil piping/passages providing lubricating oil cooling\n\nto the piston; the blockage being primarily caused by foreign particles and sludge present\n\nin the unserviceable lubricating oil clogging the small diameter piping/passages through\n\nwhich the lubricating oil flows to the crankshaft journals, crankpins and pistons whilst\n\nthe main engine is in operation.54. Mr Pereira considered that the main engine breakdown on 25 March\n\n1995 was an extension of the breakdown on 21 March. In his view, the damage to nos. 2, 3,\n\n4, 5 and 6 crankpin bearings already existed on 21 March but their eventual breakdown was\n\npre-empted by the seizure of no. 3 piston on that day. The crankpin bearing damage was\n\nprobably caused by inadequate lubrication to the crankpin bearings as a result of partial\n\nblockage of the lubricating oil passages in the crankshaft by foreign particles and sludge\n\npresent in the lubricating oil.55. The failure to fully overhaul nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 pistons after they\n\nhad been removed from the main engine also, in Mr Pereira’s view, contributed to the\n\nseizure of no. 3 piston in its cylinder liner on 21 March. This was because the overhaul\n\nof nos. 1 and 6 pistons had showed that the piston crown were heavily internally layered\n\nwith carbon and this condition probably also existed in the no. 3 piston crown.56. It was Mr Pereira’s considered opinion that the main\n\nbreakdowns of the vessel’s main engine on 21 and 25 March 1995 were primarily caused\n\nby the negligence of the chief engineer and the technical superintendent for the following\n\nreasons:(1) electing to reuse the unserviceable lubricating oil which had been\n\n  pumped out of the main engine sump. As the oil purifier on board the vessel had not been\n\n  operated for some time, the lubricating oil in the main engine sump was obviously in poor\n\n  condition (containing a high degree of insolubles and water) and should have undergone\n\n  reconditioning and analysis (to establish serviceability) before it was poured back into\n\n  the cleaned engine sump. The fact that the repairers were requested to clean the sump\n\n  indicates that the oil was in dirty and unserviceable condition and it was therefore\n\n  necessary to fill new lubricating oil into the sump before putting the main engine back\n\n  into operation; and(2) electing not to fully overhaul nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 pistons although\n\n  they had been removed from the main engine. The full overhaul of nos. 1 and 6 pistons\n\n  showed that they were internally layered with carbon. This should have indicated that the\n\n  internal condition of the other four pistons was similar and that their full overhaul was\n\n  necessary. By allowing the re-assembly of the main engine without such overhaul, the chief\n\n  engineer and technical superintendent acted negligently and contrary to correct\n\n  engineering practice.57. Mr Pereira also commented on the owners’ assertion that\n\nincorrect tightening of the main bearing bolts caused the damage. In his view, the\n\nincorrect tightening of the main bearing bolts and big-end bearing bolts would have\n\nresulted in damage of a different nature ie loosening of the securing nuts and detachment\n\nof the bearing caps which could have caused catastrophic impact damage to the crankshaft,\n\nbedplate and entablature, as a result of the detachment of the connecting rod from the\n\ncrankpin or dislodgement of the main bearing cap with consequent crankshaft misalignment.\n\nThe Wartsila engineers did find the crankpin bearings badly scoured and the corresponding\n\nconnecting rod housing and crankpin overheated. This finding, in Mr Pereira’s view,\n\nsupported his opinion that operating the main engine using unserviceable lubricating oil\n\nhad primarily caused the two main engine breakdowns.Findings58. Before I go on to discuss the experts’ opinions, I should make\n\nfindings on the other matters in dispute. First, the condition of the oil separator. It\n\nwas FC Chan’s position that this had not been working in early March 1995. He stated\n\nthat he had not brought up the matter to the repairers or the ABS surveyor since the oil\n\nseparator was not part of the repairers’ scope of work. This excuse seems to me to be\n\na feeble one for not mentioning that something was out of order especially since it could\n\nhave been repaired at the time and FC Chan could have given a quotation for the work and\n\nobtained instructions to carry it out. As a ship repairer it was not in his interest to\n\nfail to point out malfunctioning parts to the owner. I find his evidence on this point to\n\nbe unsatisfactory.59. I am aware that KO Chan also stated in his affidavit that the oil\n\nseparator was not working. This assertion was not contained in his statement and its\n\nstrength was also undermined during cross-examination when he admitted that he had not\n\npersonally checked the component and also that he could not be sure whether the component\n\nhad been repaired during the time the vessel was at the shipyard.60. On the other hand, WH Chan, the ABS surveyor, asserted quite firmly\n\nthat the oil separator had worked both when it was tested on its own and when it was\n\noperating as part of the engine during the trials. He had checked this component for the\n\npurpose of his survey and had no doubts about its functioning. I accept this evidence in\n\npreference to that given by the repairers as WH Chan was there as an independent assessor\n\nof the situation. He was there to ascertain whether the vessel met the class requirements\n\nand he had no interest in the outcome of the survey one way or another. His evidence on\n\nthe point was not subject to any of the doubts that undermined the testimony of WH Chan\n\nand KO Chan. I therefore find that the oil separator was functioning when the vessel left\n\nthe shipyard.61. The next issue is as to the condition of the lubricating oil. There\n\nwas no direct evidence on this point since no analysis of the oil was performed. However,\n\nthere was evidence from Mr Thompson and Mr Khoo that the vessel had run for only 3119\n\nhours since its last oil change and therefore the existing lubricating oil should have\n\nbeen in good enough condition for continued use. Mr Thompson went to investigate the\n\nsituation. He interviewed the chief engineer and saw the logbooks and he was quite clear\n\nthat the figure that he was given was correct and that there was no reason to doubt that\n\nfigure. I accept his evidence on this point. I note that FC Chan testified that the oil\n\nwas dirty. He, however, did not make any written protest about the reuse of the oil at the\n\ntime. KO Chan’s evidence on the point was of dubious reliability since he had almost\n\nsimultaneously given a contradictory account to the owners’ lawyers.62. I therefore find that there is no evidence that the lubricating oil\n\nthat was pumped out of the vessel in early March 1995 was unserviceable at the time that\n\nit was put back into the vessel. Further, accepting that only 3119 hours had elapsed since\n\nthe last oil change, this lubricating oil should have been in good enough condition for\n\nfurther use since there were more than 8,000 hours to elapse before it would have to be\n\nchanged in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation. On this point KO\n\nChan’s evidence was also instructive. He had said in his statement that he thought it\n\nsafe for the vessel to sail. Whilst he averred in court that the oil was dirty upon being\n\npressed he confirmed he had not been extremely worried about the oil, only a bit worried.\n\nOn consideration of his evidence on this point, it appears to me that the correct version\n\nwas, probably, that at the time he did consider it safe for the oil to be re-used.63. Mr Thompson’s evidence was that if the lubricating oil had\n\nbeen in poor condition, the main bearings would have been the first engine part to be\n\naffected. In this case, the class surveyor examined the main bearings for the purpose of\n\nthe special survey and found them to be in order. Thus, the lubricating oil must have been\n\nin reasonable condition. It is also noteworthy that the special survey took place only\n\nonce in every five years and therefore if components examined by the class surveyor passed\n\nthe survey, it would mean that their condition was good enough to last a further five\n\nyears. This in fact was admitted by Mr Pereira in cross-examination.64. The other preliminary issue relates to the condition of the two\n\npiston crowns that were dismantled by the repairers. FC Chan stated that he had found\n\nthese to be heavily layered with carbon and that he had drawn the chief engineer’s\n\nattention to the situation and suggested to the latter that the other piston crowns be\n\ncleaned as well. Again, his complaint was a verbal one only. One would have thought that\n\nhe would have wanted the extra business and that when his suggestion to the chief engineer\n\nwas ignored, he would have made it in writing direct to Mr Khoo in Malaysia. After all on\n\nthe contractual matters and the scope of work, he knew that instructions came from Mr\n\nKhoo. It appears to me that the situation that the repairers found on dismantling the two\n\npiston crowns was not as serious as Mr Chan later made it out to be.65. Turning to the cause of the damage to the main engine, the\n\nrepairers relied on the opinion of Mr Pereira. His evidence was based on his analysis of\n\nthe facts as gained from documents and affidavits. Unfortunately, he had not been engaged\n\nat the time of the incident and therefore had not had the opportunity of examining the\n\nengine or any of the damaged components. Also, he had not had an opportunity of speaking\n\nto the class surveyor before giving his opinion. His opinion on what could have caused the\n\nmain engine damage is set out in 56. To summarise, the use of unserviceable oil caused\n\nthe lubricating oil passages to be blocked by foreign particles and therefore the main\n\nengine was starved of lubricating oil and overheated. Secondly, the failure to fully\n\noverhaul the other four pistons meant that they continued to be heavily layered with\n\ncarbon and this contributed to the seizure of the no. 3 cylinder.66. Mr Pereira’s hypothesis is that overheating of the piston,\n\nwhich caused it to seize, was caused by lubricating oil starvation. This in turn arose\n\nfrom the blockage of the lubricating passage. The cause of the blockage was the presence\n\nof dirt in the lubricating oil. Mr Pereira posited that the lubricating oil was dirty on\n\ntwo grounds:(a) because the owners had decided to clean the main engine sump (in\n\n  fact when I asked him that he had deduced that the lubricating oil was dirty simply\n\n  because the decision was taken to clean the sump, he agreed that that was so); and(b) the lubricating oil separator had not been working for some time.As far as ground (a) is concerned, during cross-examination Mr Pereira\n\nconceded that the cleaning of the main engine lubricating oil sump was because the ABS\n\nsurveyor required it to be cleaned for the purpose of the survey. Thus, it would appear\n\nthat whether or not the sump was dirty, was irrelevant to the decision to clean it. As far\n\nas ground (b) was concerned, as I stated, Mr Pereira did not have the benefit of WH\n\nChan’s evidence that the oil separator was working when the vessel left the shipyard.\n\nThus, neither ground (a) nor ground (b) provided Mr Pereira with a solid basis for his\n\nhypothesis.67. There are other grounds on which it is difficult to accept the\n\nhypothesis that the lubricating oil was extremely dirty and therefore unserviceable. As I\n\npointed out above, the ABS surveyor found the crankshaft bearings and the main bearings to\n\nbe in satisfactory condition. Mr Pereira agreed that there was no excessive wear of these\n\nitems at the time of the damage. He was then asked to agree that that showed the\n\nlubricating oil could not have been dirty up to the time of survey. His answer was that\n\nthat was not necessarily so as the bearings may have been passed because they were within\n\ntolerance. He then admitted, however, that passing the special survey meant that the items\n\nhad been certified to be fit for the next five years. That being the case it appears\n\nimprobable to me that the bearings were at the limit of acceptability. They must have been\n\nin fairly good condition to be passed as useable for a further five years.68. Mr Pereira had also admitted that the dirt in oil by itself would\n\nnot have caused the kind of damage that the main engine sustained. He agreed that for the\n\nvarious parts to be damaged the way they were, the oil supply had to be cut off. However\n\ndirty the oil could get it would not cause this damage because as long as the oil could\n\nflow through the system it would perform its cooling function. His theory about the\n\ncausation of the damage was based on blockage of the system so that no oil got through to\n\ncool the main components.69. There was, however, a difficulty with the theory that the system\n\nwas blocked. Mr Pereira’s evidence was that the lubricating oil would have passed\n\nthrough two filters. These filters had pores that were 30 microns or three hundredth of a\n\nmillimetre in size. He also testified that the size of the oil passage in the crankshaft\n\nis between five to ten millimetres in diameter. Thus, it would appear that only very tiny\n\nparticles could pass through the filters and enter the passage. Mr Pereira asserted,\n\nhowever, that such particles could consolidate into sludge and then block the passage. Mr\n\nThompson’s evidence was that the bigger particles would not be able to enter the oil\n\npassages because the filter would trap them before they entered the engine. Even if very\n\ntiny particles went through the filters a build up of sludge would be unlikely because of\n\nthe high pressure, high velocity flow and temperature of 60C. He asserted that there are\n\na number of forces that prevent sludge build up in the passage and, if at all, sludge\n\nwould build up in the sump. Mr Pereira agreed under cross-examination that the oil flowing\n\nthrough the filters would be running at a high temperature and under great pressure though\n\nhe disagreed that that would entirely prevent build up of sludge. It appears to me that in\n\nthese circumstances and considering the minuteness of the particles that would be able to\n\npass through the filter, even if a build up of sludge could take place as asserted by Mr\n\nPereira, that build up would be a slow process and would not lead to blocking of the\n\npassage within a period as short as the 18 hours that elapsed between the vessel leaving\n\nSingapore and the no. 3 piston seizing in the South China Sea.70. Further, Mr Pereira gave evidence that the blockage was between the\n\nmain bearing and the no. 3 crankpin bearing. Even if Mr Pereira was correct in his\n\nassumption, the blockage between the main bearing and the no. 3 crankpin bearing could not\n\nhave caused damage to the other crankpins ie nos. 2, 4 and 5. The blockage theory does\n\nnot, therefore, explain all the damage sustained.71. The other reason why Mr Pereira considered the owners negligent was\n\nthat they had not ensured that all the pistons were fully overhauled. However, as I have\n\nstated, the evidence of CF Chan that pistons no. 1 and 6 were internally layered with\n\ncarbon was not satisfactory. In addition, Mr Thompson’s evidence is that he had\n\nexamined the damaged no. 3 piston and found no evidence of the piston crown being badly\n\nchoked with accumulated hardened carbon. That evidence does not support Mr Pereira’s\n\ntheory that all the other pistons must have been affected in the same way as no. 1 and no.\n\n6. It should also be noted that even though the no. 6 piston was fully overhauled, it\n\nstill seized. Mr Pereira agreed that that was so but asserted that separate factors had\n\ncaused the seizure. If that was the case, then overhauling pistons no. 2, 4 and 5 would\n\nnot necessarily have prevented them from seizing either.72. Overall, I am not able to accept the theory put forward by the\n\nrepairers as to the cause of the damage. As I have stated earlier, Mr Pereira’s\n\nopinion depended on the presence of certain facts. Once the facts he relied on were shown\n\nto be incorrect, the strength of his opinion was greatly diminished. There were also other\n\ndifficulties in the repairers’ version of events.73. The other theory put forward on the causation of the damage was\n\nthat espoused by Mr Thompson. I have set out his evidence in more detail above. I found\n\nhis evidence to be coherent and consistent. He considered that the seizure of the no. 3\n\nand no. 6 pistons and the damage to the no. 2, 4 and 5 crankpin bearings were caused by\n\nthe improper fitting of the crankpin bearings by the repairers. Mr Pereira agreed that\n\nsuch improper fitting could have caused damage of this nature but did not think that this\n\nhad happened in this case because after the main engine was assembled, sea trials had\n\ntaken place successfully. His view was that improper fitting would have manifested itself\n\nduring the sea trials.74. Mr Thompson was cross-examined on his belief that the damage was\n\ncaused by the improper fitting despite the fact that there were no signs of improper\n\nfitting during either the mooring or sea trials. He explained that during the mooring and\n\nsea trials, the damage to the bearing metal had already been initiated and that the\n\nbearings had started to wear down. As, however, the bearings were lined with a thin layer\n\nof white bearing metal which was relatively soft, this layer was the first layer to be\n\nworn down and the wear was not appreciable enough to cause obvious manifestations of\n\ndamage ie knocking sounds and, subsequently, piston seizure. With the continuous running\n\nof the engine as the voyage continued, more wear of the bearing shell metals took place.\n\nThe next layer to be eroded was the copper layer but the damage may still not have\n\nmanifested itself because the gap (or clearance) would be small since the layers are thin.\n\nAs the crankpin bearing metals became excessively worn down, a larger space (more\n\nclearance) was created which caused the ‘knocking’ because of the motion of the\n\npiston and total bearing failure occurred. Mr Thompson asserted that the damage would only\n\nmanifested itself after total failure of the bearings. I find this to be a coherent and\n\ncredible explanation of why no damage was noted during the sea trials.75. When Wartsila examined the main engine and its components after the\n\nincident, they found the main bearings to be damaged: three of them were badly scored and\n\nthe other three were lightly scored. On this basis, the repairers submitted that the\n\ndamage was due to insufficient lubrication. Mr Thompson had agreed that if the lubricating\n\noil was in poor condition or if there was insufficient lubricating oil, the main bearings\n\nwould be the first engine part to fail or would suffer severe damage or wear. He was\n\ntherefore cross-examined by counsel for the repairers in an attempt to show that the main\n\nbearing damage had occurred before the other damage sustained by the engine.76. Mr Thompson asserted that the damage to the main bearings had\n\narisen as a consequence of the other damage. He had noted in his note book at the time\n\nthat when he inspected the no. 4 and no. 6 main bearings, he had found them to have\n\nsustained damage that was a lot less severe than the crankpin damage. He took photographs\n\nof the bearings and these photographs showed that the soft bearing metal was still in\n\nexistence. This was an indication that the bearings had not been subjected to as severe\n\ndamage as the crankpin bearings had because in the latter case, the bearing metal had\n\nsustained excessive wear. The metal debris from the crankpin bearings had entered the oil\n\nand circulated with it and this is what had caused damage to the other components like the\n\nmain bearings. Mr Thompson was convinced that the debris had entered the oil only after\n\nthe crankpin bearing metals had been worn because the bearings had been inspected during\n\nthe overhaul, the liners and the piston had been calibrated and the components had not\n\nshown any appreciable physical wear at that time. He also said that visually, it was\n\nobvious that the particles embedded in the crankshaft bearings had come from the crankpin\n\nbearings or from the other excessively worn parts of the engine. He had done this visual\n\ninspection and was very sure where the metal debris had come from. Mr Thompson’s\n\ngreat advantage over Mr Pereira in this case was that he had seen the main engine and its\n\ncomponents in their damaged state and had had access to all equipment parts and personnel\n\nnecessary for the purposes of his investigation.77. Having considered all the evidence, I accept Mr Thompson’s\n\ntestimony and opinion that the cause of the damage was the improper fitting of the\n\nconnecting rod bolts or bearings by the repairers during the overhaul of the engine in mid\n\nMarch 1995.Conclusion78. As a result, there must be judgment for the plaintiffs against the\n\ndefendants as regards liability and costs. As to quantum of damages, I would like further\n\nsubmissions on this issue. I will see parties in chambers on the same.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
