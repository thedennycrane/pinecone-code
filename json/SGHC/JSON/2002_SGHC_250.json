        "Introduction": "1.\n\n        Leow Tiak Cheow, the first plaintiff, was the\n\nbeneficial shareholder of all the issued shares in Nam Kee Asphalt Pte Ltd (‘Nam\n\nKee’) i.e 5,014,000 shares. In 2000, Pan-United Industries Pte Ltd (‘PUI’),\n\nthe defendant, was interested in buying all the issued shares in Nam Kee. There were\n\nnegotiations resulting in a Memorandum of Understanding dated 12 October 2000.\n\nSubsequently, a Sale and Purchase of Assets Agreement dated 23 December 2000 was entered\n\ninto between Nam Kee, Tiak Cheow and Pan-United Engineering Pte Ltd (a related company of\n\nPUI) and a Share Sale Agreement (‘SSA’) dated 8 January 2001 was entered into\n\nbetween Tiak Cheow, Leow Tiak Chuan who is the second plaintiff and PUI. There was also a\n\nPut Option and a Deed of Indemnity but these agreements are irrelevant for present\n\npurposes.2.        Tiak\n\nChuan came to be a registered shareholder of two shares in Nam Kee in the following\n\ncircumstances. Out of the 5,014,000 shares, two had been held by one Leow Lee Choo as\n\nnominee for Tiak Cheow. The rest were registered in Tiak Cheow’s name. As Lee Choo\n\nwas in London at the material time and in anticipation of the sale of his shares in Nam\n\nKee to PUI, Tiak Cheow caused Lee Choo to transfer the two shares to the name of Tiak\n\nChuan.3.        It\n\nwas agreed that the Pan-United group would buy certain assets of Nam Kee and the shares\n\nbeneficially owned by Tiak Cheow in Nam Kee at a certain aggregate price. It was also\n\nagreed that the price be apportioned so that the consideration for the shares was\n\n$3,985,000. I would add that there was also a sweetener on top of the aggregate price but\n\nthat is not material to the dispute before me and only the terms of the SSA are material.4.        \n\nClause 3 of the SSA provides for the consideration to be payable in the following manner:‘3.1 S$3,485,000 at\n\n    Completion; and3.2 S$500,000 (\"the\n\n    Retention Sum\") less any deductions by [PUI] pursuant to Clause 10.3 without interest\n\n    at the expiry of 6 months after the Completion Date.’The Completion Date was defined\n\nto mean 15 January 2001 or such other date as the parties may agree in writing. The actual\n\ncompletion was on 17 January 2001.5.        As\n\nstated, the Retention Sum is subject to any deduction by PUI pursuant to Clause 10.3 of\n\nthe SSA. Clause 10.3 entitles PUI to deduct from the Retention Sum the amount of any claim\n\nwhich PUI may have pursuant to Clause 10.1 which in turn provides for the Plaintiffs to\n\nindemnify PUI for any breach of the warranties in the SSA.6.        The\n\nmaterial warranty is Clause 8.4.1 of the SSA. It states:‘8.4 The Vendors further\n\n    jointly and severally represents and warrants to and undertake with the Purchaser and its\n\n    successors in title … that:-8.4.1 the net tangible asset\n\n    value of the Company as at the Completion Date as reflected in the Completion Accounts,\n\n    adjusted to exclude the Completion Account Receivables, the Completion Liabilities and any\n\n    amount owed to the Company by Pan-United Engineering Pte Ltd pursuant to the Asset Sale\n\n    Agreement, will not be less than S$2,500,000;…’I will refer to the warranty\n\nunder clause 8.4.1 as ‘the NTA warranty’.7.        The\n\nCompletion Accounts are defined in the SSA to mean ‘the audited balance sheet of the\n\nCompany as at the Completion Date and the audited profit and loss statement for the period\n\nfrom 1 January 2001 to the Completion Date’.8.        \n\nClause 6.2 of the SSA provides‘6.2 The Parties shall\n\n    jointly procure, as soon as practicable and in any event within 30 days after Completion,\n\n    the preparation of the Completion Accounts which shall be prepared by the Company on the\n\n    basis of the same accounting principles as the Audited Accounts and the Nine-Months\n\n    Audited Accounts and audited by the Company’s auditors, who shall also be instructed\n\n    to certify the Completion Account Receivables and Completion Liabilities.’9.        The\n\nPlaintiffs’ position is that they are entitled to the payment of the Retention Sum\n\nand that there is no breach of the NTA warranty. The Plaintiffs’ position on the NTA\n\nwarranty is based on their assertion that there should be a revaluation of Nam Kee’s\n\nleasehold land, and buildings thereon, at 15 Sungei Kadut 3, Singapore (‘the\n\nProperty’) and the revaluation would result in a net tangible asset (‘NTA’)\n\nvalue which, when determined in accordance with clause 8.4.1, will meet the NTA warranty.\n\nIn respect of the revaluation, the Plaintiffs rely on a valuation of the Property done by\n\none Wong Kum Sek dated 3 January 2001. That valuation was done actually for the purpose of\n\nstamping the transfer of shares from Lee Choo to Tiak Chuan.10.        \n\nPUI’s primary position is that there is a breach of the NTA warranty in that the NTA\n\nvalue of Nam Kee as at the Completion Date and as reflected in the 16 May 2001 Completion\n\nAccounts, which I shall come to, and as determined in accordance with clause 8.4.1, is\n\n$2,038,808.95 only. Therefore the shortfall is $461,191.05. PUI’s primary position is\n\nbased on its stand that the Property need not be revalued for the Completion Accounts.\n\nThere was also evidence for PUI that even if revaluation should be carried out, the\n\nPlaintiffs would still be in breach of the NTA warranty because the valuation which PUI\n\nhas obtained is even lower than the book value of the Property before revaluation. However\n\nPUI’s pleadings do not assert this alternative. This means that the minimum that the\n\nPlaintiffs are entitled to is the difference between the Retention Sum and the shortfall\n\nin the NTA warranty as determined in accordance with clause 8.4.1 from the 16 May 2001\n\nCompletion Accounts i.e $500,000 - $461,191.05 = $38,808.95. In its pleadings, PUI also\n\nalleges other breaches by the Plaintiffs and counterclaimed damages. However, in the\n\ncourse of the trial, PUI abandoned its allegation of other breaches and relied solely on\n\nthe breach of the NTA warranty. This means that PUI’s counterclaim is effectively\n\nabandoned.",
        "Further facts and allegations": "11.        The\n\nstatutory auditor of Nam Kee’s accounts was Tan Peck Leng, Irving of Irving Tan &\n\nCo. After some chasing, he provided the Completion Accounts purportedly audited by him\n\nwith his cover letter dated 16 May 2001. I have refereed to this set of Completion\n\nAccounts as ‘the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts’. These Completion Accounts\n\nwere prepared and purportedly audited as at 15 January 2001, the contractual completion\n\ndate even though the actual completion date was 17 January 2001. However, no issue was\n\ntaken on the difference of two days.12.        I\n\nwould add that Irving Tan insisted that he did audit the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts,\n\nas well as a revised set of Completion Accounts forwarded with a cover letter dated 8\n\nAugust 2001 (‘the 8 August 2001 Completion Accounts’), even though each of his\n\ncover letters enclosing the respective Completion Accounts used the word\n\n‘review’ and not ‘audit’. Although he has about ten years’\n\nexperience as a certified public accountant, he said he was not aware that the Singapore\n\nStandard of Accounting made a distinction between a review and an audit. To him, the two\n\nwords were used interchangeably. On the other hand, PUI’s expert witness Mr Foong Daw\n\nChing was of the opinion that Irving Tan did not do an audit, partly because Irving Tan\n\nhimself had used the word ‘review’ and also because Irving Tan had failed to\n\ntake certain necessary steps which would have been done in an audit, for example, a bank\n\nreconciliation, and a debtors and creditors circularisation as at 15 January 2001 (NE 216\n\nand 217).13.        I\n\naccept Mr Foong’s evidence on this point. I would add that although Irving Tan said\n\nhe did not exhibit all the work he had done before coming up with the first set of\n\nCompletion Accounts i.e the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts, it is clear to me that, in\n\nany event, the work he had not exhibited pertained to the audit of the accounts up to 31\n\nDecember 2000 only as he himself admitted (NE 55). True, that work would assist him to\n\nfollow up with an audit of the accounts up to 15 January 2001, but that is a different\n\npoint. I am of the view that he did not carry out a further audit up to 15 January 2001 in\n\nrespect of the 16 May 2001 and the 8 August 2001 Completion Accounts. I find his assertion\n\nthat he had done an audit up to 15 January 2001, notwithstanding the omissions mentioned\n\nby Mr Foong and notwithstanding his cover letters that he had done a review, to be\n\nincredible. I also do not believe his assertion that he was not aware of a distinction\n\nbetween a review and an audit in the Singapore Standard of Accounting and that he used\n\n‘review’ interchangeably with ‘audit’.14.        \n\nHowever, as the Plaintiffs are taking the position that the 16 May 2001 Completion\n\nAccounts were audited and Mr Francis Xavier, Counsel for PUI, accepts that an audit would\n\nnot yield a different figure for the purpose of the NTA warranty, I am treating the 16 May\n\n2001 Completion Accounts as having been audited for the purpose of this action only.\n\nStrangely enough, Mr Xavier was still taking the point that for the 8 August 2001\n\nCompletion Accounts, such Accounts were not audited even though an audit per se would also\n\nnot yield a different figure for the purpose of the NTA warranty. The primary difference\n\nbetween the 16 May 2001 and the 8 August 2001 Completion Accounts was the inclusion in the\n\nlatter of Mr Wong’s 3 January 2001 valuation of the Property. Accordingly, for the\n\npurpose of this action only, I am also treating the 8 August 2001 Completion Accounts as\n\nhaving been audited by Irving Tan. Whether the Completion Accounts should include a\n\nrevaluation of the Property is another matter.15.        Mr\n\nXavier also took the point that, as regards the 8 August 2001 Completion Accounts, these\n\nAccounts were prepared more than 30 days after completion. On the other hand, he was\n\ncontent to accept the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts even though they too were prepared\n\nmore than 30 days after completion. It seems to me that he was blowing hot and cold again,\n\ndepending on which set of Completion Accounts was in favour of PUI. In my view, the fact\n\nthat each of the Completion Accounts was prepared more than 30 days after the completion\n\ndoes not in itself make the respective Completion Accounts invalid. There might be a\n\nbreach by one or both of the parties but that is a different matter.16.        Mr\n\nXavier also took the point that the 8 August 2001 Completion Accounts were not jointly\n\nprocured as envisaged by clause 6.2 of the SSA. Mr Xavier was using this point to argue\n\nthat Irving Tan should not have unilaterally adopted Mr Wong’s 3 January 2001\n\nvaluation for the 8 August 2001 Completion Accounts, without giving PUI a chance to\n\naddress Irving Tan on that valuation. There is some merit in this point but, in any event,\n\nit is no longer material since each side has adduced evidence before me on the valuation\n\nreport it relies on, should a revaluation be necessary.17.        \n\nComing back to the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts, it was not disputed that these\n\nAccounts showed the NTA value of Nam Kee to be $2,038,808.95 if determined in accordance\n\nwith clause 8.4.1. This would mean a breach of the NTA warranty of $2.5 million, the\n\namount of the breach being $461,191.05, as stated above.18.        I\n\ndigress briefly to deal with a suggestion by both Counsel for the opposing parties during\n\nthe trial that the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts had not been prepared and audited in\n\naccordance with clause 8.4.1. This turned out to be a misleading suggestion and caused\n\nconfusion. The SSA does not require the Completion Accounts to be prepared and audited in\n\naccordance with clause 8.4.1. It simply requires the Completion Accounts to be prepared by\n\nNam Kee under clause 6.2 ‘on the basis of the same accounting principles as the\n\nAudited Accounts and the Nine-Months Audited Accounts and audited by the Company’s\n\nauditors …’. In other words, clause 6.2 does not require Nam Kee to take into\n\naccount clause 8.4.1 when it is preparing the Completion Accounts. Nor does it require\n\nIrving Tan to take into account clause 8.4.1 when he does his audit. It is only after the\n\nCompletion Accounts have been prepared and audited in accordance with clause 6.2 that the\n\nparties will then apply the formula in clause 8.4.1 to determine whether the Plaintiffs\n\nhave met the NTA warranty or not.19.        In\n\nthis connection, paragraph 10(d) of the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim was misleading.\n\nIt states that the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts shows an NTA value of $2,723,263.74.\n\nWhile that may be true, this figure is not determined in accordance with clause 8.4.1 and\n\nhence irrelevant to the dispute about the NTA warranty. In other words, it is not the NTA\n\nvalue per se that is important in the dispute but the NTA valueas determined in\n\naccordance with clause 8.4.1that is important.20.        \n\nAfter the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts were submitted to PUI, PUI’s solicitors\n\nRajah & Tann took the position that there was a breach of the NTA warranty while the\n\nPlaintiffs’ then solicitors Leong Kwok Yan disputed the breach. I would add that the\n\nexchange of correspondence between solicitors on the NTA warranty is confusing. For\n\nexample, Rajah & Tann had assumed, even then, that the Completion Accounts had to take\n\ninto account the formula in clause 8.4.1 and hence alleged that these Completion Accounts\n\nwere not correct (AB 416). On the other hand, Leong Kwok Yan was relying on a figure from\n\nthe Completion Accounts as having met the NTA warranty without taking into account the\n\nformula in clause 8.4.1 (AB 420). As I have said, the Completion Accounts do not, per se,\n\nhave to take into account clause 8.4.1 It is only when the parties want to determine\n\nwhether the NTA warranty has been met, that the formula in clause 8.4.1 kicks in.21.        \n\nThere was subsequently a meeting on or about 2 August 2001 (‘the 2 August 2001\n\nmeeting’) at Rajah & Tann’s office attended by representatives from PUI and\n\nfrom Rajah & Tann and Tiak Cheow, his solicitor Leong Kwok Yan and Irving Tan. There\n\nwas some dispute as to whether this meeting was on a ‘without prejudice’ basis\n\nbut as the substance of the meeting was referred to by both sides in the course of the\n\ntrial without qualification, until the qualification was raised at a late stage in the\n\ntrial, I am of the view that it is too late for the parties, and in particular the\n\nPlaintiffs, to assert that evidence as to what was said at the meeting is inadmissible.22.        It\n\ntranspired that at the 2 August 2001 meeting there was an admission on behalf of the\n\nPlaintiffs that the NTA warranty had not been met because the NTA value of Nam Kee based\n\non the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts, and determined in accordance with clause 8.4.1,\n\nwas $2,038,808.95 (NE 11 line 16, 22 and 28, see also AB 447/448). Indeed, during\n\ncross-examination, Tiak Cheow again acknowledged that under the 16 May 2001 Completion\n\nAccounts, the NTA warranty had not been met (NE 11 line 11).23.        \n\nThere is a dispute whether Ng Bee Bee, a director and Senior General Manager of PUI, had\n\ntold the meeting that if the Plaintiffs could come up with another set of Completion\n\nAccounts which would show Nam Kee’s NTA value to be not less than $2.5 million, PUI\n\nwould be happy to release the Retention Sum to the Plaintiff. However, I do not have to\n\nrule on this dispute because the Plaintiffs have not pleaded this allegation either as\n\nconstituting a variation of the SSA or an estoppel of some sort.24.        \n\nWhat is not in dispute is that Tiak Cheow, his solicitor, and Irving Tan had had their own\n\ndiscussion as they were leaving the meeting and had come up with an approach which would\n\nallow the Plaintiffs to meet the NTA warranty. This was to adopt the valuation of the\n\nProperty which had been done by Mr Wong on 3 January 2001 for the purpose of stamp duty in\n\nrelation to the transfer of the two shares from Lee Choo to Tiak Chuan. Mr Wong had valued\n\nthe Property at $2.5 million which was more than the book value of the Property. According\n\nto Mr Jeffrey Beh, Counsel for the Plaintiffs, the book value was $2.003 million (NE 3).\n\nUsing Mr Wong’s valuation, Irving Tan then revised the 16 May 2001 Completion\n\nAccounts and the revised Completion Accounts were then forwarded to Nam Kee with his cover\n\nletter dated 8 August 2001. As a result, the NTA value of Nam Kee, as determined in\n\naccordance with clause 8.4.1, became $2,545,369.74 instead of $2,038,808.85 under the 16\n\nMay 2001 Completion Accounts.25.        \n\nIrving Tan sought to justify his revision of the Completion Accounts on the basis that the\n\n16 May 2001 Completion Accounts was meant for discussion purposes only and in any event Ng\n\nBee Bee had agreed at the 2 August 2001 meeting that PUI would pay the Retention Sum if\n\nthe Plaintiffs could come up with Completion Accounts showing the NTA value as at least\n\n$2.5 million, when determined in accordance with clause 8.4.1.26.        I\n\ndo not accept his first reason. His cover letter dated 16 May 2001 forwarding the\n\nCompletion Accounts did not suggest that it was for discussion purposes only. Furthermore,\n\nif it was for discussion purposes only, there would not have been an admission of a breach\n\nof the NTA warranty. In my view, the suggestion that the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts\n\nwere for discussion purposes only was a desperate excuse to justify its revision.27.        As\n\nfor the allegation about what Ng Bee Bee had said, I have already said that this was not\n\npleaded as constituting a variation or an estoppel.28.Therefore,\n\nthe main issue is whether, under the terms of the SSA, the Property should be revalued for\n\nthe Completion Accounts.",
        "Should the Property be revalued?": "29.        Mr\n\nBeh relied on the terms of clause 6.2 which I have set out in para 8 above. He also\n\nsubmitted that PUI does not dispute that it is an accounting policy of Nam Kee to revalue\n\nits leasehold land and buildings from time to time.30.        On\n\nthis point, Mr Beh was relying on Note 2.2 of Nam Kee’s accounts for the year ended\n\n31 March 2000 which states, inter alia:‘The building is subject to\n\n    24 years lease commencing February 1985. It was revalued by a professional valuers on 30\n\n    August 1997. The revalued leasehold land and building is subject to amortization for its\n\n    remaining 12.5 years.’However, in my view, this\n\nsubmission faced considerable difficulties.31.        \n\nFirst, paragraph 10(d) to (f) of the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim states:‘(d)    The\n\n    Plaintiffs state that a Completion Account dated 16 May 2001 was furnished to the\n\n    Defendants. The Completion Account showed a net tangible asset value of $2,723,263.74.\n\n    [This was misleading as I have said in para 19 above.](e)    The\n\n    Completion Account was subsequently revised which revised Completion Account, dated 8\n\n    August 2001, showed a net tangible asset value of $2,545,369.74, excluding the duly\n\n    certified Completion Account Receivables, the Completion Liabilities and any amount owed\n\n    to the Company by Pan-United Engineering Pte Ltd, in compliance with Clause 8.4.1\n\n    aforesaid.(f)In bothcases, the Completion Accounts were prepared on the basis of the same accounting\n\n    principles as the Audited Accounts and the Nine-Months Audited Accounts and were duly\n\n    audited by the said M/s Irving Tan & Co, Certified Public Accountants, in compliance\n\n    with Clause 6.2 aforesaid and in consultation with the Defendants.’[Emphasis added.]32.        I\n\ndo not see how both the Completion Accounts prepared in May and in August 2001 could have\n\nbeen prepared on the same accounting principles as one relied on the 3 January 2001\n\nvaluation of the Property whereas the other (the 16 May 2001 one) did not.33.        It\n\nwas also not pleaded specifically that the accounting principles of Nam Kee required\n\nrevaluation of the Property. Neither was it pleaded that the revaluation was done every\n\nyear. Indeed, looking at Note 2.2, there was only one revaluation between February 1985\n\nand 30 August 1997.34.        Mr\n\nBeh sought to rely on the fact that, in cross-examination, Mr Cheong Sang Hoon, a Finance\n\nand Admin Manager of PUI, was shown Note 2.2 about revaluation and he agreed that Nam Kee\n\nhad a policy of revaluing the Property ‘from time to time’. Mr Cheong also\n\nagreed that Irving Tan was permitted to take into account any revaluation of the Property\n\nin the context of the Completion Accounts (NE 203). In my view, this evidence does not go\n\nas far as Mr Beh was submitting. If there had been a revaluation for the purpose of\n\nupdating Nam Kee’s accounts, Irving Tan would have been entitled to take that\n\nrevaluation into account for the Completion Accounts. However, Mr Wong’s 3 January\n\n2001 valuation was not for the purpose of updating Nam Kee’s accounts. Besides, even\n\nIrving Tan, who had been the statutory auditor of Nam Kee for some years, did not seek a\n\nrevaluation of the Property or rely on Mr Wong’s 3 January 2001 valuation when he was\n\nauditing the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts.35.        On\n\nthis point, paragraph 6 of Irving Tan’s AEIC simply states that it was the accounting\n\npolicy and practice of Nam Kee to re-value its immovable property but paragraph 6 stops\n\nshort of stating that Nam Kee’s accounting policy required revaluation to be done\n\nevery year. Irving Tan must have realised this and that is why in paragraph 7 of his AEIC,\n\nhe relies not so much on Nam Kee’s accounting policy but on the Statement of\n\nAccounting Standards (‘SAS’). However, he could only say that under SAS 14, a\n\nproperty was required to be re-valued yearly if market conditions are volatile or between\n\nthree to five years where the market is stable.36.        \n\nThere was no specific plea by the Plaintiffs that the SAS would require revaluation of the\n\nProperty. In any event, as the Property was last revalued on 30 August 1997, the next\n\nvaluation could be in August 2002 in the absence of evidence of volatile market\n\nconditions.37.        It\n\nbears repeating that when Irving Tan was auditing the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts, he\n\ndid not seek a revaluation of the Property nor rely on Mr Wong’s 3 January 2001\n\nvaluation even though it was Irving Tan’s office who had asked that such a valuation\n\nbe done for the purpose of stamping the transfer of shares from Lee Choo to Tiak Cheow.\n\nNeither did the Plaintiffs propose a revaluation for the purpose of the Completion\n\nAccounts. The idea of using Mr Wong’s 3 January 2001 valuation came about only after\n\nit was admitted on behalf of the Plaintiffs that they had not met the NTA warranty.38.        As\n\nan aside, I would add that I notice that Note 2.2 of the accounts refers to a professional\n\nvaluation on 30 August 1997 and Tiak Cheow said in paragraph 20 of his AEIC that ‘All\n\nprevious valuations of the company’s land were undertaken by Wong Kum Sek &\n\nCo’. Yet Mr Wong’s second AEIC exhibited two earlier valuation reports in 1990\n\nand 1995 only and none in 1997. There was no evidence before me as to who had done the 30\n\nAugust 1997 valuation.39.        Mr\n\nBeh also sought to rely on a press report dated 20 January 2001 based on a press release\n\nfrom the Pan-United group stating that ‘The two wholly-owned subsidiaries of\n\nPan-United Corporation arrived at the total purchase price of $10.5 million after\n\nconsidering NKA’s earnings potential and the market value of its assets\". He\n\nsubmitted that this demonstrated that PUI had made its purchase on the market value of the\n\nassets of Nam Kee and not the book value. However, there was no other evidence that PUI\n\nwas thinking of or had obtained or relied on a revaluation of the Property for the purpose\n\nof the Completion Accounts when the SSA was signed or even as at 16 May 2001. Even Tiak\n\nCheow and Irving Tan were not thinking of relying on Mr Wong’s 3 January 2001\n\nvaluation up to 16 May 2001, even though each of them was aware that Mr Wong had done a\n\nrecent valuation for the purpose of stamp duty.40.        \n\nLikewise, although PUI had accepted the figure of $2.5 million as the value of the\n\nProperty for the purpose of stamping forms for the transfer of shares to it, this did not\n\nmean that PUI had agreed to adopt $2.5 million as the value of the Property for the\n\npurpose of the Completion Accounts. It appears to me that, whatever the reason, when the\n\nSSA was signed and when the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts were being prepared, no one\n\ngave a thought to using the $2.5 million figure for the Completion Accounts, until August\n\n2001.41.        Mr\n\nBeh then placed much reliance on the case ofPacific Century Regional Developments Ltd\n\nv Estate of Seow Khoon Seng[1997] 3 SLR 761. In that case, Pacific Century Regional\n\nDevelopments Ltd (‘PCRD’) agreed to acquire 3,510,000 shares from one Seow Khoon\n\nSeng, who had passed away, in a company called Pioneer Die Casting Co Ltd (‘Pioneer\n\nDie Casting’). One of the objectives of the agreement was the listing of Pioneer Die\n\nCasting within three years from the date of the agreement. Under clause 6.3.1 of the\n\nagreement, the deceased would have the option of re-acquiring the shares if the objective\n\nof listing failed. The relevant provision required the valuation of the shares to be based\n\non the NTA or PE of Pioneer Die Casting, whichever was the higher. Clause 6.3.2 of the\n\nagreement in that case provided:‘(a) ‘NTA’ means\n\n    the net tangible asset value of the company as at the end of the financial year\n\n    immediately preceding the exercise date based on the audited financial statements of the\n\n    companyin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practicesin Singaporeas determinedby the auditors of the company who shall decideas\n\n    expertsand not as arbitrators, and whose determination shall be final and\n\n    conclusive.’[Emphasis added.]42.        The\n\nshares of Pioneer Die Casting were not listed. One Vincent Seow, representing the estate\n\nof the deceased, then wrote on 27 September 1995 to Mr Gerard Ee of Ernst & Young to\n\nobtain a valuation of the shares as at 31 December 1994 for the purpose of exercising\n\n‘appropriate options’, meaning the option to re-acquire the shares from PCRD\n\nalthough there were various options available. Ernst & Young were the statutory\n\nauditors of Pioneer Die Casting. Mr Ee replied promptly on 28 September 1995. In his\n\nopinion, the NTA value as at 31 December 1994 was approximately $1.10 per share. However\n\nhis reply had a specific qualification which stated:‘Kindly note that the fixed\n\n    assets should be revalued for proper valuation. It includes leasehold land and building\n\n    which was last revalued based on professional valuation on 24 November 1981.’At that time, Mr Ee had not seen\n\nclause 6.3.2.43.        \n\nVincent Seow was dissatisfied with this qualification as revaluation had not been stated\n\nin the agreement or in his letter to Ernst & Young. He then met with Mr Ee and brought\n\nhis attention to clause 6.3.2 Mr Ee then issued another letter also dated 28 September\n\n1995 but the qualification was removed. However, Mr Ee maintained that he had expressly\n\nsaid that the second letter was not to be used in conjunction with clause 6.3.2 of the\n\nagreement. On 10 November 1995, the estate’s solicitors gave notice of election to\n\nre-acquire all the shares held by PCRD in Pioneer Die Casting at $1.10 per share.44.        On\n\n15 November 1995, PCRD wrote in response to this notice as well as the 28 September 1995\n\nletter from Mr Ee (which did not contain the qualification). PCRD stated that the\n\nvaluation had failed to take into account the relevant market value of the real estate\n\nproperties of Pioneer Die Casting and its subsidiaries. Also, they requested the PE figure\n\nto be determined. On 16 November 1995, PCRD’s solicitors wrote to Ernst & Young\n\nto request a valuation based on the PE. On the same day, Mr Ee replied. The relevant part\n\nof his letter stated that the value given on the shares on 28 September 1995 took the\n\nvalues as stated in the audited balance sheet as at 31 December 1994. The value was given\n\n‘in response to a general enquiry from a director and is not by reference to any\n\nterms that may be set out in any option agreement’. On 21 November 1995, Mr Ee\n\nstressed the same point in another letter to PCRD’s solicitors. In addition, he\n\ninformed them that the valuation based on PE was four cents.45.        In\n\nthe meantime, PCRD’s President had sent Mr Ee a fax on 16 November 1995 asking for\n\nhis determination of the NTA value with respect to clause 6.3.2. On 29 November 1995, Mr\n\nEe replied to state that the NTA per share was $1.50. According to Mr Ee, this value had\n\nbeen arrived at by taking into account the revaluation of the leasehold land and buildings\n\nof the group as at 31 December 1994, based upon independent professional valuers’\n\nreports.46.        The\n\ntrial judge did not think that there was room for further investigation or revaluation\n\nonce the accounts of Pioneer Die Casting had been finalised. The Court of Appeal disagreed\n\nfor three reasons.47.        \n\nFirst, clause 6.3.2 in that case provided for the NTA ‘to be based on the audited\n\nfinancial statements of the companyin accordance with generally accepted accounting\n\nprinciples and practices.’ [Emphasis added.] The Court of Appeal was of the view\n\nthat the second limb meant that the NTA would not be based solely on the audited financial\n\nstatements, otherwise the second limb would be otiose. In addition, there were six\n\naffidavits from partners of well-known accounting firms all of whom stated that if they\n\nwere appointed as an expert under clause 6.3.2, they would value the shares on the basis\n\nof revalued assets.48.        \n\nSecondly, clause 6.3.2 required the statutory auditors there to make a decision as\n\n‘experts and not as arbitrators’. If the NTA was to be based on the audited\n\nfinancial statements alone, appointing an expert to assess the NTA would seem unnecessary.\n\nOn the other hand, only an auditor, as an expert, would be in a position to revalue the\n\nfixed assets and assess the NTA as a result.49.        \n\nThirdly, the Court of Appeal was of the view that the agreement had to be looked at from a\n\ncommercial perspective. Relying on the book Share Valuations by TA Hamilton Baynes, the\n\nCourt of Appeal was of the view that basing the NTA purely on the audited financial\n\nstatements would not reflect the correct worth of the shares. The last revaluation was on\n\n24 November 1981, about 13 to 14 years earlier. No reasonable person would expect the\n\nshares to be based on figures last determined in 1981 and, again, the Court of Appeal\n\nrelied on the six affidavits from partners of well-known accounting firms which I have\n\nalready mentioned.50.        In\n\nthe case before me, the SSA is silent about revaluation as was the case of the agreement\n\nin thePCRDcase. However, many of the facts before me are somewhat different from\n\nthose in thePCRDcase.51.        \n\nFirst, clause 6.2 of the SSA does not have the second limb of clause 6.3.2 in thePCRDcase.52.        \n\nSecondly, the statutory auditors of Nam Kee are not required to act as experts. On this\n\npoint, I digress to say that the requirement of an auditor to decide as an expert and not\n\nas an arbitrator does not , by itself, necessarily mean that there must be revaluation. I\n\ndo not consider the judgment of the Court of Appeal in thePCRDcase to mean that.\n\nThe phrase ‘to decide as experts and not as arbitrators’ is often used to ensure\n\nthat the auditors’ decision is not appealable even though another phrase ‘whose\n\ndetermination shall be final and conclusive’ is used as well. In my view, the latter\n\nphrase is used merely to emphasize the point that the auditors’ decision is not\n\nappealable.53.        \n\nThirdly, while I accept that the SSA should be viewed from a commercial perspective, even\n\nthough Irving Tan claimed he had been told by one of PUI’s representatives that it\n\nwas a friendly deal (NE 35), this is not a case where the last valuation was done 13 or 14\n\nyears ago but about three and a half years ago. More importantly, unlike thePCRDcase, there was no evidence on the Plaintiffs’ side from any other auditor that a\n\nrevaluation of the Property should be done first before the accounts of Nam Kee were\n\nprepared as at the Completion Date. Indeed, it will be recalled that under clause 6.2 of\n\nthe SSA, the statutory auditors are only required to audit the Completion Accounts. They\n\nare not required to determine the NTA value under clause 8.4.1. That is for the parties to\n\nascertain from the Completion Accounts once they have been prepared and audited (up to the\n\nCompletion Date).54.        \n\nFourthly, unlike Gerard Ee in thePCRDcase, the statutory auditor Irving Tan did\n\nnot initially mention the need for a revaluation of the Property for the purpose of the\n\nCompletion Accounts. I have already set out the circumstances as to how Irving Tan came to\n\nuse the 3 January 2001 valuation of Mr Wong, after there was already an admission of a\n\nbreach of the NTA warranty.55.        The\n\nevidence of PUI’s expert witness Foong Daw Ching did not shed any further light on\n\nthis point. In his report, he said only that upon receipt of Mr Wong’s 3 January 2001\n\nvaluation report, Irving Tan should have sought the views of PUI. However, this comment\n\nappeared to apply to the revision of the Completion Accounts dated 8 August 2001. Mr Foong\n\ndid not assert, one way or the other, whether there should be, in the first place, a\n\nrevaluation under clause 6.2 of the SSA. Neither was he asked this question in\n\ncross-examination.56.        Mr\n\nBeh also submitted that PUI had recognised the need for revaluation because its solicitors\n\nRajah & Tann wrote to Irving Tan on 6 December 2001 to ask him to take into account\n\ntwo valuation reports, one of which was from CB Richard Ellis Pte Ltd (‘Richard\n\nEllis’). The other was from DTZ Debenham Tie Leung (SEA) Pte Ltd, but I have\n\ndisallowed a late application to adduce evidence from a representative of DTZ as the\n\napplication should have been made earlier. It seems to me that while the letter from Rajah\n\n& Tann does appear to suggest that PUI was proceeding on the basis of a revaluation of\n\nthe Property, it should not be read in isolation. Rajah & Tann had already on 17\n\nSeptember 2001 written to Leong Kwok Yan to object to any revaluation. Therefore their\n\nletter dated 6 December 2001 should be read to mean that, if a revaluation was necessary,\n\nPUI had obtained valuation from two other valuers.57.        In\n\nthe particular circumstances, I am of the view that Clause 6.2 of the SSA does not require\n\na revaluation of the Property and the Plaintiffs have breached the NTA warranty.",
        "Secondary Question": "58.        A\n\nsecondary question is whether there should be an adjustment nevertheless to the 16 May\n\n2001 Completion Accounts. In cross-examination, Irving Tan said that the accountant in Nam\n\nKee had applied depreciation for the two week period from 1 January to 15 January 2001. As\n\nthe depreciation charge was on an annual basis, he would put back $11,977.55 i.e increase\n\nthe NTA of Nam Kee by this sum. However, he did not explain why, in the first place, he\n\nhad included the depreciation charge when he audited the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts.\n\nIt is not as though he was unaware of this depreciation charge at the material time. He\n\ncould have rejected the depreciation charge then but he did not.59.        I\n\nam of the view that Irving Tan cannot try and revise or adjust the depreciation charge\n\nnow. While the depreciation charge is usually applied on an annual basis, it should be\n\npro-rated since the Completion Accounts were to be prepared as at 15 January 2001.",
        "The correct value of the Property\n\nas at 15 January 2001": "60.        In\n\nthe circumstances, it is not necessary for me to decide whether Mr Wong’s 3 January\n\n2001 valuation should be adopted to determine whether the NTA warranty has been breached.\n\nHowever, for completeness, I will deal with this point.61.        Mr\n\nXavier raised a number of arguments to persuade me why I should not accept Mr Wong’s\n\n3 January 2001 valuation, if a revaluation should be done, and that I should instead adopt\n\na valuation report dated 23 November 2001 by Richard Ellis which valued the Property at\n\n$1.85 million. I will mention Mr Xavier’s main arguments only.62.        \n\nFirst, Mr Wong’s 3 January 2001 valuation was not for the purpose of the SSA but for\n\nstamp duty on the transfer of shares from Lee Choo to Tiak Chuan. Even Irving Tan had\n\nsaid, during cross-examination, that he did not actually ask to see a copy of Mr\n\nWong’s 3 January 2001 valuation before issuing the 16 May 2001 Completion Accounts\n\nbecause that valuation was for a share transfer (NE 44). I would add that although Irving\n\nTan then said in re-examination that he had not thought about that valuation at the\n\nmaterial time (NE 59), he did not explain why this was so if revaluation should have been\n\ndone. The truth of the matter is that up to 16 May 2002 he did not think that a\n\nrevaluation should be done.63.        \n\nSecondly, although Mr Wong’s valuation was based on comparables, the comparable\n\nproperties were not listed in Mr Wong’s 3 January 2001 valuation. Mr Wong did not\n\ndispute that the had omitted the list of comparables in the valuation report but said that\n\nhe had had them in mind when he did the valuation. In his first AEIC, he enclosed a list\n\nof comparables. However, some of the information in that list was inaccurate as to either\n\nthe floor area or the price per square foot of a sale. Mr Wong then filed a second AEIC to\n\ninclude a list to replace the one he had exhibited to his first AEIC. In that list he\n\ncorrected the earlier errors and included information on the period remaining of the\n\nleasehold comparables. However, there were again errors in his fresh list.64.        For\n\nexample, as regards two of the comparables, the period remaining of their leases was\n\nincorrect because Mr Wong had calculated the remaining period from 15 January 2001 whereas\n\nhe should have instead calculated it from the respective dates of sales/ transfers. Mr\n\nXavier also submitted that item 3 of Mr Wong’s list of comparables (which is 16 Benoi\n\nSector) was of a property sold or transferred on 15 January 2001 i.e after Mr Wong’s\n\n3 January 2001 valuation. He could not have had this comparable in mind as at 3 January\n\n2001 and he probably included it in his subsequent list to justify his valuation. To be\n\nfair, when Mr Wong sought to include his list of comparables, he referred to it as\n\n‘evidence of value’ and he did not actually say that these were the comparables\n\nhe had had in mind when he gave his 3 January 2001 report/valuation. In cross-examination,\n\nhe said he included this property to show the trend of values (NE 78). In my view, he\n\nshould have made it clear in his list that that property was sold/ transferred after the\n\ndate of his valuation.65.        \n\nThirdly, Mr Xavier submitted that although Mr Wong had inspected the Property again before\n\nhis 3 January 2001 valuation, he had not measured the floor area of the buildings again.\n\nWhat Mr Wong had done was to adopt a figure of 4,449.2 square metres reflected in his\n\nearlier 1990 report of the Property. I would also mention that although Mr Wong used the\n\nword ‘Built-in-area’, what he meant was the floor area. The 4,449.2 square\n\nmetres was the total floor area of two office buildings, two single-storey factory\n\nbuildings and two single-storey guardhouses. Mr Wong explained that this figure was based\n\non actual site measurements as opposed to measurements taken from plans.66.        On\n\nthe other hand, Richard Ellis’ measurements, as reflected in their report, were taken\n\nfrom plans. They came up with a figure of 3,694.80 square metres excluding a covered\n\nlinkway between two production buildings and two guardhouses. However, Richard Ellis’\n\nwitness Ms Sim Hwee Yan had, prior to giving evidence, done on-site measurements, and her\n\nmeasurements resulted in a floor area of 3,754.26 square metres. She also measured the\n\ncovered linkway between two production buildings and the two guardhouses on site and if\n\nthese were taken into account, the total would be 4,059.60 square metres, still less than\n\nMr Wong’s 4,449.2 square metres.67.        \n\nUnfortunately for the Plaintiffs, Mr Wong no longer had his working papers for the 1990\n\nvaluation. Furthermore, Richard Ellis’ measurements from the plans and on-site\n\nmeasurements were not challenged during cross-examination.68.        To\n\nexplain why his measurement of the floor area was 4,449.2 square metres, Mr Wong said that\n\nhe had included the areas below the roof eaves as floor area. However, Ms Sim had, also\n\nprior to giving evidence, measured these areas to test his assertion. The areas below the\n\neaves would have resulted in an additional 970.50 square metres, if the covered linkway\n\nwas included, which would then make the total floor area 5,030.10 square metres (i.e\n\n4,059.60 + 970.50 square metres). This was quite a lot more than Mr Wong’s 4,449.20\n\nsquare metres.69.        Mr\n\nXavier also submitted that Mr Wong’s 1990 report stated that the floor area of the\n\nlarger of the two office buildings was 598 square metres, including the power station. The\n\ntotal floor area of both the office buildings was 918 square metres. This meant that the\n\nfloor area of the smaller office building was 320 square metres (i.e 918 - 598 square\n\nmetres). However, Ms Sim’s measurements on site showed the floor area of the smaller\n\noffice to be 324 square metres without taking into account the eaves area around this\n\nbuilding. This figure of 324 square metres, without the eaves area, was already more than\n\nMr Wong’s 320 square metres. The eaves area, of the smaller office building, would be\n\nanother 71.40 square metres (Exhibit D9).70.        Mr\n\nXavier submitted that Mr Wong could not have included the eaves area in his measurement in\n\n1990 of the floor area and that the explanation about the eaves area was just an excuse to\n\njustify Mr Wong’s error of 4,449.2 square metres.71.        Mr\n\nWong’s reason for including the eaves area as floor area appeared to be that the\n\neaves area was concreted and was used as part of the building. It could be used to store\n\ngoods (NE 87). On the other hand, the evidence of Ms Sim was that floor areas given in\n\ncomparables do not include the area below the eaves (NE 228). She was not challenged on\n\nthis. I do not accept Mr Wong’s reason as a good reason. The area below the eaves was\n\nalmost as much exposed to weather as the area outside of the eaves. The fact that the\n\nfloor of the eaves area was concreted was of minimal value as he himself accepted (NE 88).72.        \n\nHowever, Mr Beh submitted that on the authority ofLim Bio Hiong Roger v City\n\nDevelopmentsLtd[2000] 1 SLR 289, the eaves area should be treated as part of the\n\nfloor area for the purpose of valuation. In my view, that case did not assist Mr Beh\n\nbecause it did not concern the valuation of a property and also did not concern the eaves\n\narea. I accept Mr Xavier’s submission that Mr Wong had used the eaves area as an\n\nattempt to justify the total floor area he had reported in 1990.73.        It\n\nalso seems to me that Mr Wong had done his 3 January 2001 valuation rather casually. That\n\nis why he did not attach a list of comparables to that valuation. That is also why there\n\nwere errors in the list of comparables he tendered eventually and errors again in his\n\nrevised list. He must have known that his 3 January 2001 valuation was in respect of the\n\ntransfer of two shares only and hence did not put in as much effort as he might otherwise\n\nhave done had he been instructed to do a valuation for Nam Kee’s accounts.74.        \n\nAlthough Mr Wong’s 3 January 2001 valuation has the benefit of having been done\n\nbefore any dispute arose, Ms Sim said that Richard Ellis were told that their valuation\n\nwas for the company’s financial statement (NE 223). There was no suggestion that they\n\nknew that the valuation was required to resolve a dispute.75.        Ms\n\nSim is a director of Richard Ellis although it was a licensed valuer of Richard Ellis,\n\nClaire Woo, who did the initial leg-work such as inspecting the Property, taking\n\nphotographs, inspecting comparables, calculating floor area, and making adjustments in\n\nview of comparables. However Ms Sim said she did sit down with Claire Woo to discuss Ms\n\nWoo’s proposed valuation before the report was finalised and Ms Sim did inspect the\n\nProperty before she gave her evidence. Furthermore, as I have said, although Richard\n\nEllis’ valuation was based on measurements of floor area taken from plans, Ms Sim did\n\ngo down to the site subsequently to take measurements of the floor areas and later, the\n\neaves area, before she gave evidence.76.        \n\nAlthough Mr Beh submitted that working papers of Richard Ellis were not produced in\n\nevidence, he did not ask for them to be produced or, as I have said, challenge the\n\naccuracy of their measurements during cross-examination. Furthermore, I was quite\n\nimpressed by Ms Sim’s overall evidence which I find to be generally steady.77.        On\n\nbalance, I am of the view that the valuation report by Richard Ellis is to be preferred\n\nsubject to the qualification that Ms Sim’s on-site measurements revealed a slightly\n\nlarger floor area of 4,059.70 square metres (which includes the floor area of the covered\n\nlinkway and two guardhouses) as compared to 3,964.80 square metres (which is based on\n\nplans and excludes the covered linkway and two guardhouses). The difference is 94.9 square\n\nmetres, slightly more than 2%. In any event, Ms Sim had said that other valuers might\n\ndiffer between 5% to 10% from Richard Ellis’ valuation and her own range of the value\n\nwas $1.82 million to $1.9 million (NE 229 and 225). Using the higher end of her range i.e\n\n$1.9 million and adding 10% thereto would result in a figure of about $2.09 million which\n\nI will round up to $2.1 million.78.        \n\nAccordingly, if a revaluation of the Property should be done, I am of the view that the\n\ncorrect value thereof as at 15 January 2001 would be $2.1 million and the Completion\n\nAccounts should then be adjusted accordingly before clause 8.4.1 is applied.",
        "Conclusion": "79.        As\n\nI have concluded that the SSA does not require a revaluation of the Property, the NTA\n\nvalue, as determined in accordance with clause 8.4.1, has resulted in a shortfall of\n\n$461,191.05. After setting off the shortfall against the Retention Sum, PUI still has to\n\npay the Plaintiffs $38,808.95. I grant judgment to the Plaintiffs for $38,808.95 and\n\ninterest thereon at 6% per annum from the date of Writ to the date of judgment. PUI’s\n\ncounterclaim is dismissed. The Plaintiffs have not succeeded substantially on their claim\n\nand I will hear the parties on costs.",
        "Observation": "80.        I\n\nwould add one observation. PUI had initially raised some other defences which were\n\nunmeritorious or irrelevant. These defences were dropped only during the trial. In my\n\nview, its attempt to rely on such defences does not reflect well on it.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERSINGAPORECopyright © Government of Singapore."
