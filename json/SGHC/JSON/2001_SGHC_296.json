        "THE PROSECUTION’S CASE": "4 On Thursday, 1 March 2001, at about 1 pm, Insp Sivaraman Letchumanan\n\ninstructed SSSGT B. Chandrasegaran to conduct surveillance in the vicinity of Blk 347,\n\nJurong East Ave 1, a food centre in the Jurong East housing estate. He was told to look\n\nout for two male Indians, one of whom was known as \"Black\" (i.e. First Accused).\n\nA description of \"Black\" was given to him. SSSGT Chandrasegaran proceeded to the\n\nsaid Blk 347 in a van.5 The teams involved in this operation comprised:1) Insp Sivaraman, SSGT Md Azman, SGT S. Rajkumar, SGT Chua Yong Choon\n\n  – these four officers were together in a car belonging to the Central Narcotics\n\n  Bureau (\"CNB\"), with SGT S. Rajkumar as the driver. They left for the carpark at\n\n  Blk 448 Jurong West St 42 at about 4 pm;2) SGT Affendi Ideris and CPL D. Sivarajaa went to Blk 552 Jurong West\n\n  St 42 on a motorcycle. They kept a look out from the seventh storey of that block of flats\n\n  which was located next to the First Accused’s block of flats (Blk 554);3) W/Insp Neo Ling Sim, SSSGT Qamarul Zaman and SGT Chong Yit Ming\n\n  proceeded to the carpark at Blk 447 Jurong West St 42 in another CNB car;4) SGT Gan Kok Wee, SGT Justin Fong, SGT Lim Teong Wah and W/SGT\n\n  Jasylin Low went to the carpark at Blk 448 Jurong West St 42 in a CNB van;5) SSSGT Hansen Sebastian took a taxi to Jurong West St 42 and walked\n\n  about the area.6 At 4.25 pm, SSSGT Chandrasegaran spotted the First Accused on a\n\nmotorcycle with the registration number FS 5358P. He parked his motorcycle at a motorcycle\n\nparking lot about 15 metres from SSSGT Chandrasegaran’s stationary van. The First\n\nAccused alighted from his motorcycle and waited beside it.7 The Second Accused was then seen walking towards the First Accused.\n\nHe was carrying a yellow plastic bag. When he reached the motorcycle, the Second Accused\n\nopened the carrier box at the rear of the motorcycle, placed the yellow plastic bag in it\n\nand then shut the carrier box. Both Accused persons then had a short conversation for less\n\nthan one minute.8 After that, the First Accused got on his motorcycle and left while\n\nthe Second Accused walked empty-handed back towards the food centre. SSSGT Chandrasegaran\n\nfollowed the motorcycle which turned left into Jurong East Ave 1, continued along Jurong\n\nWest Ave 1 and then turned right into Jurong West St 42. The junction of Jurong West Ave 1\n\nand Jurong West St 42 was controlled by traffic lights and the CNB officer’s van\n\ncould not make it past the junction before the lights changed against it. SSSGT\n\nChandrasegaran thus lost sight of the First Accused’s motorcycle. He reported this to\n\nInsp Sivaraman.9 Insp Sivaraman then instructed SGT Affendi Ideris and CPL Sivarajaa\n\nto look out for the First Accused’s motorcycle. They went down from the seventh\n\nstorey of Blk 552 and cruised around the vicinity on their motorcycle. At about 4.50 pm,\n\nthey spotted the First Accused’s motorcycle parked in a motorcycle lot at the carpark\n\nof Blk 554 and reported this to Insp Sivaraman who instructed them to continue their\n\nobservation. They did not see the First Accused. They returned to their position on the\n\nseventh storey of Blk 552 to continue their look out.10 At about 5.10 pm, the two officers saw the First Accused and a\n\nfemale Indian (his wife) approaching the First Accused’s parked motorcycle. They\n\nspoke to each other for a while upon reaching the motorcycle. The First Accused then got\n\nonto his motorcycle and rode out of the carpark towards Jurong West St 42 while his wife\n\nwalked back to their flat. They immediately reported the development to Insp Sivaraman.11 They then descended from their observation point and ran towards\n\nJurong West St 42. From a distance, they saw that the First Accused had stopped his\n\nmotorcycle by the roadside. A short while later, they saw Insp Sivaraman’s vehicle\n\nintercept the First Accused.12 When Insp Sivaraman was informed that the First Accused had returned\n\nto Jurong West St 42 on his motorcycle, his team immediately proceeded to the said street\n\nin the CNB car. They saw that the First Accused had stopped by the roadside, seated\n\nastride his motorcycle and appeared to be waiting for someone. They stopped their car at\n\nan angle in front of the First Accused’s motorcycle, got out, handcuffed the First\n\nAccused and placed him under arrest at about 5.15 pm. The motorcycle’s engine was\n\nturned off and the keys removed from the ignition. The First Accused was noticed to have\n\nurinated in his pants while still seated. He was brought to stand beside the\n\nmotorcycle’s carrier box.13 Insp Sivaraman then took the keys and, before opening the\n\nmotorcycle’s carrier box, asked the First Accused in Tamil if there was anything in\n\nit. The First Accused replied in Tamil that there was \"Jamma\" inside.\n\n\"Jamma\" meant \"things\" generally but was also a street name for\n\nCannabis in Tamil.14 The carrier box was then opened using the keys. Inside the carrier\n\nbox were a yellow plastic bag with two blocks of vegetable matter containing Cannabis,\n\nwrapped with transparent plastic, a black carrier bag with a bottle of spray in it, an\n\nempty carrier bag with the name Criss Cross and a blue plastic bag containing 61 S$1\n\ncoins.15 At about 5.30 pm, with SGT Rajkumar as a witness, Insp Sivaraman\n\nasked the First Accused a series of questions in Tamil. He recorded the questions and the\n\nanswers thereto (given in Tamil) in his field book thus:\"Q: What is your name.A: Rajagopalan s/o Tamilarasan.Q: What is inside your bike Carrier.A: Drugs.Q: What kind of drugs is this?A: Ganjah (Cannabis) \"Jamma\".Q: Who does this Ganjah belong to?A: It is mine.Q: What is this Ganjah for?A: It is for sale.Q: When did you take this Ganjah?A: About 10-20mins Ago.Q: Who did you take it from?A: I took it from Paul.Q: Where did you meet Paul?A: At the Hawker’s Centre.Q: What block.A: At the Hawker Centre near Esso Petrol Station.Q: How did you contact Paul to collect the Ganjah.A: I called him at handphone no: 96101229.\"The officer then read back the questions and answers in both English\n\nand Tamil to the First Accused and asked him in Tamil whether he understood the contents,\n\ninviting him to make any changes he desired. The First Accused replied in Tamil that he\n\nunderstood the contents and that they were true and correct. He then signed in the field\n\nbook.16 The other teams arrived at the scene of arrest. At about 6 pm, Insp\n\nSivaraman instructed SSSGT Chandrasegaran to lead a party of six officers to arrest the\n\nSecond Accused. W/Insp Neo and the two officers in her team proceeded to the First\n\nAccused’s flat to search for controlled drugs. Insp Sivaraman, still holding the\n\nyellow plastic bag with the two blocks of vegetable matter, then left in the CNB van with\n\ntwo officers and the First Accused to join SSSGT Chandrasegaran’s team at Blk 347\n\nJurong East Ave 1. SSGT Hansen Sebastian was handed the keys to the First Accused’s\n\nmotorcycle and instructed to ride it behind the CNB van.17 When SSSGT Chandrasegaran’s team arrived at the said Blk 347\n\n(the food centre), he saw the Second Accused sitting beside a coffee stall having drinks\n\nwith another male Indian, Subramaniam s/o Lechumanan Suppiah. Both of them were placed\n\nunder arrest.18 On a steel cabinet behind the Second Accused, there were two black\n\nbags placed one on top of the other. SSSGT Chandrasegaran asked the Second Accused about\n\nthe ownership of the two bags. The Second Accused claimed the bag at the top with the\n\nletters \"SCTS\" was his but not the one at the bottom which had the word\n\n\"Brutini\". Nothing incriminating was found in the SCTS bag. The Brutini bag\n\nhowever contained nine bundles of vegetable matter, each wrapped with an aluminium foil, a\n\nNokia handphone battery charger, an aluminium wrapper and ten sachets of vegetable matter.\n\nThe Second Accused claimed that these things were not his.19 The Second Accused was searched and a mini-sachet of vegetable\n\nmatter was found in his left trousers pocket. Upon questioning, the Second Accused\n\nadmitted that it was Cannabis and he had it for his own consumption. SSGT Azman held on to\n\nall the items recovered at the scene.20 Insp Sivaraman then arrived in the CNB van and was informed of the\n\narrest of the two male persons. Subramaniam was handed over to Insp Sivaraman. SSSGT\n\nChandrasegaran then left the food centre with his team and the Second Accused for the\n\nSecond Accused’s flat at Blk 311 Jurong East St 32 #13-333.21 Nothing incriminating was found in the said flat. The CNB team then\n\nbrought the Second Accused to the Clementi Police Division HQ.22 In his office, at about 6.52 pm, SSSGT Chandrasegaran asked the\n\nSecond Accused three questions in English. The answers were also given in English. SGT\n\nRajkumar and SSGT Azman, still holding the seized items, were also present. The questions\n\nand answers recorded on a piece of paper were as follows:\"Q: Does the 2 black bags which were recovered from the premises\n\n  of the hawker centre where you were arrested belong to you?A: Both bags belong to me. One black bag (Singa China Travel Service\n\n  Logo) and (Berutini) brand belongs to me.Q: Do you know what is in the black bag (Berutini) which was seized\n\n  from you.A: I know that there is Marijuana in the bag but I do not know the\n\n  exact amount. I only know that is about 350 to 400 grams of Marijuana.Q: The other black bag (SCTS) logo, did it contain any drugs before we\n\n  seized it.A: The bag contained 2 kilogram of Marijuana which I handed to my\n\n  friend Raja only a few minutes before my arrest.\"The questions and answers were then read back to the Second Accused who\n\nconfirmed that they were true by signing on the piece of paper.23 At 7.15 pm, SSSGT Chandrasegaran instructed SSGT Azman to hand over\n\nthe Second Accused together with the seized items to Insp Sivaraman.24 In the meantime, Insp Sivaraman and his team left the hawker centre\n\ntogether with the First Accused and Subramaniam in the CNB van for the flat of the First\n\nAccused at Blk 554 Jurong West St 42. They arrived at 6.35 pm. One officer remained in the\n\nvan with Subramaniam while Insp Sivaraman and the other officer escorted the First Accused\n\nto his flat.25 There they met W/Insp Neo and the other two officers. A further\n\nsearch was conducted but nothing incriminating was recovered from the flat. They then left\n\nat 6.50 pm for Clementi Police Division HQ.26 At 9.25 pm, Insp Sivaraman left with three officers, the First and\n\nthe Second Accused and all the exhibits seized for the Major Investigation Branch\n\n(\"MIB\"). SGT Affendi followed them on the First Accused’s motorcycle.27 At the MIB, they met ASP Soh Thiam Loon, the Investigating Officer.\n\nThe two Accused persons were left in the conference room with two officers standing guard.\n\nInsp Sivaraman then briefed ASP Soh in the latter’s office about the events that day\n\nand handed over all the seized exhibits.28 Photographs were taken of the First Accused’s motorcycle. The\n\ndrug exhibits were then photographed and weighed in the conference room in the presence of\n\nthe First and the Second Accused. The two Accused persons were then escorted to the\n\nAlexandra Hospital for their pre-statement medical examination. Insp Sivaraman then handed\n\nover the personal properties of the Accused persons to ASP Soh and left the MIB.29 The two blocks of vegetable matter found in the yellow plastic bag\n\nwere analysed at the Narcotics Laboratory at the Centre for Forensic Science and were\n\nfound to contain 824 grams and 824.8 grams respectively of cannabis. Adding up to 1648.8\n\ngrams of cannabis, they formed the subject of the two Charges.30 Subramaniam, who was arrested at the food centre together with the\n\nSecond Accused, testified that he had gone to the food centre at past 5 pm on 1 March 2001\n\nto buy \"private Toto\" from a Chinese but did not meet him. He saw the Second\n\nAccused sitting alone drinking beer. Upon the Second Accused’s invitation, he joined\n\nhim at the table.31 When the CNB officers approached them, Subramaniam knew who they\n\nwere as he was a drug supervisee at the Clementi Police Division HQ. He did not realize\n\nthere were two bags on the steel cabinet until he was asked. He told the CNB officers that\n\nthe bags were not his. Subramaniam did not know the First Accused.32 Shiyamala d/o Kesavan is the First Accused’s wife. They were\n\nmarried in 1995 and have a 5 year old son. She worked in the Republic of Singapore Navy at\n\nTuas and supported the family financially as her husband had been unemployed since being\n\ninvolved in a motorcycle accident in 1996. The First Accused did odd jobs now and then.33 She testified that on 28 February 2001, at about 9.30 pm, she had\n\ngone to watch a movie at Westmall in Bukit Batok together with her husband and their son,\n\nRaja Mohamed (the First Accused’s uncle) and his girlfriend, Selvam (the First\n\nAccused’s friend) and his wife and their son. After the movie, Raja’s girlfriend\n\nleft the group while the First Accused and Selvam went somewhere to play cards. The rest\n\nof the group returned to the First Accused’s flat.34 The First Accused and Selvam returned home sometime in the morning.\n\nWhen Shiyamala was leaving for her work at about 7 am, both of them were still awake. She\n\nleft with Selvam’s wife who was going to the market.35 At about 8.30 am, she called the First Accused who told her he was\n\nabout to go to sleep. She informed him that she was taking the afternoon off from work and\n\nwould leave her office at about noon.36 When she returned home at about 2 pm, the First Accused was sleeping\n\non the sofa. At about 3 pm, she woke him up to eat lunch.37 While they were eating, Paul (the Second Accused) called. The First\n\nAccused then told her he wanted to go and see his friend, Paul, to borrow money from him\n\nto buy her a birthday gift. He told her that he had requested the loan from Paul a few\n\ndays earlier and that Paul had asked him to see him to take the $100. He said Paul would\n\ncall him later. She had never seen nor spoken to Paul before.38 At about 4.30 pm, the First Accused’s handphone rang. After\n\nanswering the call, the First Accused told her that Paul had called to ask him to meet him\n\nfor the $100. The First Accused said the meeting place was within Jurong and he would\n\nreturn home within ten minutes. He then left the flat.39 About ten minutes later, the First Accused telephoned her and asked\n\nher to go down from their second storey flat to the ground level.40 When she met him, he was with his motorcycle in the parking lot\n\nbetween Blks 552 and 554. They sat at the void deck of Blk 552. The First Accused was not\n\ncarrying anything and he behaved normally. She sat with her back to the carpark, opposite\n\nthe First Accused. There could have been a pillar blocking the First Accused’s view\n\nof the carpark.41 The First Accused told her he wanted to bring her to IMM for\n\nshopping. He also said Paul had asked him to deliver a bag to Paul’s friend. She\n\nasked him why Paul could not do it himself. The First Accused replied that Paul had to go\n\nsomewhere and therefore asked him to do him that favour. She asked the First Accused what\n\nwas inside the bag and to whom was it to be delivered. The First Accused said he did not\n\nknow but was expecting a call from Paul’s friend as Paul had given the First\n\nAccused’s handphone number to that friend. A call then came through and the First\n\nAccused said that Paul’s friend had called to say that he had arrived. The First\n\nAccused told her he would deliver the bag and would be back in about ten minutes. As she\n\nwas in her houseclothes then, he asked her to go up to the flat to change and he would\n\ncall her later. He then left on his motorcycle.42 Back at the flat, Shiyamala waited for her husband to call but he\n\ndid not. Subsequently, CNB officers went to the flat. That was when she learned of the\n\nFirst Accused’s arrest. Asked whether First Accused was someone who would go around\n\nleaving his motorcycle unlocked, she replied that the First Accused was a very careful\n\nman.43 Shiyamala was later recalled to the witness stand at the request of\n\nthe First Accused as there was some dispute as to the time of his arrest. She now\n\ntestified that she had seen CPL Sivarajaa walking past alone at the void deck of Blk 552\n\non 1 March 2001 and commented to her husband that he (CPL Sivarajaa) looked as if he was\n\ndrunk. She could remember him because of his coloured hair, his lips and the way he\n\nwalked. The First Accused did not respond to her remark. CPL Sivarajaa, in his testimony,\n\ndenied that he had seen them at the void deck. He stated that he and SGT Affendi Ideris\n\nworked as a team and were together.44 She further added that when she returned to the flat after speaking\n\nto the First Accused at the void deck of Blk 552, the CNB officers went to the flat within\n\none to two minutes later, at about 5.10 pm to 5.12 pm. She knew it was about that time\n\nbecause the First Accused’s sister and her fianc (Nantha Kumar), who were in the\n\nflat, had to go out at 5.15 pm because they had to meet someone by 6 pm. Her sister’s\n\nfriend, Rajan, was also in the flat at that time. At about 5.40 pm, another of the First\n\nAccused’s friends, Goudham, also went to the flat.45 She claimed that four CNB officers had gone to the flat – one\n\nfemale Chinese, two male Chinese and one male Malay. The female Chinese made one or two\n\ncalls on her handphone and also received one or two calls. At about 5.20 pm or 5.25 pm,\n\nthat female Chinese received a call informing her that the First Accused had been\n\narrested. When she mentioned the word \"arrested\", Shiyamala asked her about it\n\nand she said that her husband was arrested. The officers searched the safe in the flat\n\nwhen the First Accused was brought to the flat as the safe key was with him. The safe\n\ncontained passports and certificates only.46 Shiyamala claimed that she had informed the First Accused’s\n\nformer Counsel that there was a man who was drunk who walked past her and the First\n\nAccused at the void deck. She told this to his present Counsel only after a few days into\n\nthe trial although she was interviewed by him on the first day.47 W/Insp Neo was not called to testify at the trial as she was\n\nattending a course overseas and Counsel for the First Accused had informed the Prosecution\n\nearlier that he did not need her evidence. He confirmed in Court that he did not require\n\nW/Insp Neo to be called as a witness despite the further evidence of the First\n\nAccused’s wife.48 Her two team members testified that the three of them were\n\ninstructed to raid the First Accused’s flat at 5.25 pm on 1 March 2001 after the\n\nFirst Accused had been arrested. They witnessed the arrest from a distance. They arrived\n\nat Blk 554 at 5.35 pm and observed the flat. They only raided the flat at about 6 pm when\n\ninstructions from Insp Sivaraman were received through W/Insp Neo.49 Raja Mohamed, the First Accused’s uncle, confirmed that he was\n\nwith the First Accused and his family on 28 February 2001 and had stayed the night at the\n\nFirst Accused’s flat after the movie. He left for work at about 6 am on 1 March 2001\n\nwhen the First Accused and Selvam returned home.50 He added that in December 2000, the First Accused’s wife wanted\n\nto buy a handphone for the First Accused. As the couple often travelled to Malaysia for\n\nshopping while he looked after their son, they wanted a handphone with the autoroam\n\nfacility. She was not yet 21 years old then and therefore could not be a subscriber. The\n\nFirst Accused did not bring his identity card with him. They asked if they could use his\n\nidentity card to register for a handphone line with StarHub and he agreed. The bills were\n\nsent to the First Accused’s address.51 Rajinthran, the elder brother of the Second Accused, testified that\n\ntwo days before 1 March 2001, the Second Accused asked him to help with painting and\n\nrewiring works at their parents’ flat (where the Second Accused was also residing),\n\npromising him $50 per day of work. The Second Accused told him that another friend, Segar,\n\nwould be joining them.52 On 1 March 2001, at about 1 pm, Rajinthran arrived at the Second\n\nAccused’s flat. The Second Accused, their mother and Segar were in the flat. The\n\nSecond Accused was sleeping while Segar was pulling out the cables. Rajinthran woke the\n\nSecond Accused up and the three of them started working.53 Sometime past 2 pm, the three men walked over to the food centre at\n\nBlk 347 Jurong East. They ordered beer. The Second Accused handed to Rajinthran a 4D\n\nticket and asked him to collect the winnings of $650 from the turf club’s outlet\n\nnearby. After doing that, Rajinthran rejoined the other two men. One Mani had also joined\n\nthem. Rajinthran handed the $650 to the Second Accused who in turn gave him $50 and asked\n\nhim and Segar to purchase materials and tools from a hardware shop. They did so and\n\nreturned to the food centre.54 At about 4 pm, Segar and Rajinthran left the Second Accused and Mani\n\nand returned to the Second Accused’s flat to continue with the works.55 Sometime past 6 pm, CNB officers went to the flat with the Second\n\nAccused. They searched the flat and then left with the Second Accused.56 The First Accused’s motorcycle, a Honda CB 400, was bought on\n\nhire-purchase. Its price was $14,230. The First Accused made a downpayment of $3,000 in\n\nSeptember 2000 and had to pay $373 per month for three years. Instalments for October to\n\nDecember 2000 and for January 2001 had been paid. The First Accused had indicated that he\n\nwas self-employed. The hire-purchase company did not require information as to income.57 Ms Irene Ong, an executive with StarHub Pte Ltd, testified that the\n\nsubscriber of handphone number 90014490 was Raja Mohamed (the First Accused’s uncle)\n\nwhose address was in Taman Ho Swee. The billing address was however the First\n\nAccused’s address in Jurong West. She also furnished the call details of that\n\nhandphone from 22 February 2001 to 1 March 2001. As StarHub provided free incoming calls,\n\nonly outgoing calls from the handphone were captured in the system, showing details such\n\nas the numbers to which calls had been made. The call details showed that six calls were\n\nmade from the First Accused’s handphone to the Second Accused’s handphone number\n\n(96101229) on 1 March 2001 between 1.53 pm and 5.20 pm.58 The StarHub executive was re-called subsequently to explain a\n\ncontinuous series of ten outgoing calls made from the First Accused’s handphone to\n\nthe number 98501302 between 6.35 pm and 11.03 pm when the First Accused was already in the\n\ncustody of the CNB officers. She explained that 98501302 was StarHub’s Voicemail\n\nDepository Number. Whenever calls made to a StarHub subscriber’s handphone were not\n\nanswered, the calls would be diverted to that Voicemail Depository Number and would appear\n\nas outgoing calls from the subscriber’s handphone. This happened even if the\n\nsubscriber’s handphone was switched off.59 Seven calls were made from the First Accused’s handphone\n\nbetween 5.16 pm to 5.23 pm to various handphone numbers. He denied that those calls were\n\nmade by him as he was arrested at about 5.15 pm. He claimed that the last call made by him\n\nwas the one logged at 5.11 pm lasting 43 seconds.60 The Investigating Officer, ASP Soh Thiam Loon, testified that after\n\nthe two Accused persons were brought to MIB at 9.45 pm, he was briefed by Insp Sivaraman\n\non the facts of the case. Photographs were taken of the motorcycle and the seized\n\nexhibits. The drug exhibits were then weighed in the presence of the two Accused persons.\n\nThey were then brought to the Alexandra Hospital for their medical examination.61 When they returned at about 12.05 am on 2 March 2001, ASP Soh had\n\nthe First Accused brought into his room. He introduced Mr Y Raja Gopal as a Tamil\n\ninterpreter. The First Accused had no objection to Mr Y Raja Gopal as interpreter. With\n\nonly the three of them in the room, ASP Soh proceeded to take a statement from the First\n\nAccused pursuant to Section 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code through the Tamil\n\ninterpreter. Amendments were made by the First Accused when the recorded statement was\n\nread back to him. The First Accused then signed the statement which was in the following\n\nterms:\"One person by the name of Paul. Paul told me whether I could help\n\n  him to bring something. I agreed. Since I am looking after a child, I told him I would be\n\n  able to help him. At about 4 o’clock in the afternoon, my wife came back. Then I\n\n  telephoned Paul that I could go and help him to bring whatever thing he gave me. He also\n\n  said he would pay me S$100/- if I could bring the item which he give me and hand over to\n\n  his friend.Since my wife had already come home, I came out of my house after\n\n  handing over the child to her. Before which I telephoned Paul where to go and deliver the\n\n  goods. He asked me where can I go and deliver the goods. I told him near the bus-stop near\n\n  my house. He told me that I supposed to go and collect the item from him and wait at the\n\n  bus-stop near my house, and to deliver to a person who would come to see me at the\n\n  bus-stop. Then I went to see Paul. Paul came, carrying a plastic bag, yellow colour. I\n\n  told him I am unemployed and I am taking this S$100. I told him don’t get angry\n\n  because I know him. I asked for the S$100 which he promised. He said go and deliver first\n\n  and he would pay me tonight. He put the plastic bag into a box which was behind my\n\n  motorcycle. I drove the motorcycle to Blk 554 Jurong West St 42, my house, under my block.Then I went to speak to my wife. I told her I would come back shortly,\n\n  as I had to go and deliver some goods near the bus-stop.I drove my motorcycle to the bus-stop. I was waiting at the bus-stop.\n\n  Officers moved in and I was arrested. After they took out from the box the plastic bag.\n\n  Officers showed me the content of the bag was controlled drug.I told the officer a friend of mine by the name of Paul told me to\n\n  deliver, without knowing the contents. I am not accustomed to this type of work. I\n\n  don’t involved myself in drugs. That’s all. Paul is the one who was arrested and\n\n  sitting outside now.\"62 After the recording of the statement had been completed for the\n\nFirst Accused, he was brought out of the room and the Second Accused was brought into the\n\nroom. Again, the Investigating Officer introduced the Tamil interpreter and ascertained\n\nthat the Second Accused had no objection to him acting as such. A statement under Section\n\n122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code was then recorded from the Second Accused who chose\n\nto speak in English. Amendments were made at the request of the Second Accused. He then\n\nsigned the statement. It read:\"Around 3-something afternoon, I went for a beer with my workers.\n\n  After that, a guy from Malaysia came down and see me. He came down and he bring two bags.\n\n  So he put down there, sit down with me for a while, on the beer cabinet. I know Raja two\n\n  or three months only. He said: Paul, I am going out for a while. I’ll come back in\n\n  half-an-hour time. Before that, he said his friend, Raja, will call me. He said pass this\n\n  yellow plastic bag to him. I never said what is inside. The other bag was on the same beer\n\n  cabinet.After I met Raja, Raja called me first. I went to see him, he came in a\n\n  motorbike. Then he opened the box at the back of his motorbike. Then I just said your\n\n  friends asked me to pass to you. He also never checked what is inside.He took just the yellow plastic bag and left in his motorbike. Then I\n\n  came back to the same location, the hawker centre. I was drinking again with my worker and\n\n  brother. They also left already. Suddenly a lot of people came into where I was sitting.\n\n  They said they are CNB. They said \"you just now put the yellow plastic bag inside the\n\n  box.\" They asked whose bag was on the beer cabinet? One officer said: don’t\n\n  bullshit, this is yours. Because in the other bag, the black bag, you got this one belong\n\n  to who? So I said nobody. Then the officer took another bag and asked what is this? So I\n\n  said this is my friend’s bag (the Malaysian friend, same guy).Then they said they wanted to spot-check the house. So they came to my\n\n  house. Nothing was down there. So they bring to narcotic that side to investigate. To tell\n\n  the truth, I am an asthmatic patient. Casually, once in a blue moon, I would take\n\n  marijuana for my asthma. I buy rations of $0.20 for my own consumption. That was in my\n\n  pocket. But the Malaysian guy never come back. So I told the CNB this is what\n\n  happened.\"63 A second statement was recorded from the Second Accused at about\n\n1.40 am on 2 March 2001 in respect of some other matter. Both Accused persons were then\n\nsent to the Alexandra Hospital again for their post-statement medical examination. Later\n\nin the day, ASP Soh went to hand over the exhibits to the Health Science Authority for\n\nanalysis.64 On 23 March 2001, photos were taken of the scene at Jurong West St\n\n42 and at the food centre in Jurong East. Subsequent analysis of the two transparent\n\nwrappers from the two blocks of vegetable matter found in the yellow plastic bag did not\n\nproduce any fingerprints.65 On 21 July 2001, photos taken by SSGT Hansen Sebastian on 1 March\n\n2001 at Jurong West St 42 using a disposable camera were sent for developing. A total of\n\n$477.20 was recovered from the First Accused, including 61 S$1 coins in a blue plastic bag\n\nfound in the carrier box of the First Accused’s motorcycle. $77.10 was recovered from\n\nthe person of the Second Accused.66 In cross-examination, ASP Soh agreed that during his investigations,\n\nthe First Accused repeatedly told him that the $100 mentioned in his statement was a loan.\n\nThe First Accused also claimed that he did not know what was inside the yellow plastic bag\n\nthat the Second Accused had asked him to deliver. He disagreed however that the First\n\nAccused had said that the issue of the loan was not recorded in the statement.67 The Tamil interpreter testified that he did not keep any notes\n\nrelating to the taking of the above statements save as to the date and time he was at the\n\nMIB. Whatever the First Accused wanted to say was recorded by the Investigating Officer.\n\nHe agreed that he had used a Tamil word which could also mean \"hand over\" when\n\nhe interpreted the words in paragraph 1 of the First Accused’s statement, \"He\n\nalso said he would pay me $100 …\". That was also the Tamil word the First\n\nAccused used in relation to the $100. The same word was used for \"… he would pay\n\nme tonight\". The Tamil interpreter was a police officer before becoming a Senior\n\nInterpreter and was fully aware of the procedure for recording a statement.",
        "THE CASE FOR THE FIRST ACCUSED": "68 The First Accused was educated up to Primary 2. He could not read or\n\nwrite in English but could speak some English.69 He got to know the Second Accused about two or three months before 1\n\nMarch 2001 through a friend whom he had asked for a job and who referred him to the Second\n\nAccused. He first met the Second Accused at the food centre in Jurong East. He was told\n\nthat the Second Accused was an electrician and a plumber and owned a company. He\n\napproached the Second Accused but was told that there was no work for him at that time.\n\nBoth of them exchanged their telephone numbers.70 He met the Second Accused by chance at the same food centre another\n\ntwo or three times before 1 March 2001. They also spoke to each other casually over the\n\ntelephone. On 28 February 2001, the day before their arrest, the First Accused called the\n\nSecond Accused to ask for a loan of $100. The Second Accused told him he did not have the\n\nmoney then but would call him when he had it. The reason for the loan was that the First\n\nAccused’s wife’s birthday was on 4 March and he wanted to get her a gift. He\n\nintended to repay the loan on 10 March 2001 when his wife would receive her salary.71 Besides his wife’s salary, they had other income in the form of\n\nrental. One of the bedrooms was rented to two tenants who each paid them $300 per month.\n\nAnother bedroom was rented out to his sister who would pay between $200 to $500 per month\n\nto them. All the rentals were payable within the first three days of each month.72 On the morning of 28 February 2001, when he asked the Second Accused\n\nfor the loan of $100, he had not collected the rentals yet. He collected $600 from the two\n\ntenants in the evening of that day. He spent some on 28 February 2001 when he went for the\n\nfilm show and shopping. He also made some money in his card games. That was why when he\n\nwas arrested, he had more than $400 with him.73 On 1 March 2001, when he was lying in bed, the Second Accused called\n\nhim on his handphone (90014490) and asked whether he was free. He told the Second Accused\n\nthat he would call him back shortly.74 Two or three minutes later, he made the call logged in the StarHub\n\ncall details at 1.53 pm to the Second Accused’s handphone (at 96101229). The Second\n\nAccused told him he was renovating his mother’s flat in Jurong East and asked him\n\nwhether he could deliver some things to the Second Accused’s friend. The First\n\nAccused said he was not free then but could do it in the evening after his wife had\n\nreturned from work. The Second Accused agreed with that arrangement. The Second Accused\n\nalso said that he would let him have the $100 loan which he had requested the previous\n\nday.75 The First Accused’s wife then called him to say that she would\n\nbe returning home by 2 or 3 pm that day.76 At 1.57 pm, the First Accused telephoned the Second Accused to\n\ninform him of his wife’s early return from work and that he would be able to delivery\n\nthe things as requested by the Second Accused earlier. He told the Second Accused that he\n\nwould call him once his wife returned home.77 The First Accused’s wife returned home sometime past 3 pm on 1\n\nMarch 2001. At 3.44 pm, the First Accused called the Second Accused as promised and asked\n\nhim where he should go to deliver the things. The Second Accused said the location was\n\nnear the First Accused’s home and told the First Accused he would call him again two\n\nor three minutes later. He also asked where it would be convenient for him to deliver the\n\nthings. The First Accused informed the Second Accused to tell his friend to go to the bus\n\nstop near Blk 554, Jurong West St 42. The First Accused also said that he would call the\n\nSecond Accused when he was leaving his flat.78 At 4.26 pm, the First Accused called the Second Accused. The Second\n\nAccused told him to meet at the food centre in Jurong East. The First Accused went to the\n\nground level with his wife and, after opening their letter box, the First Accused turned\n\non the motorcycle’s engine, spoke to his wife for a while and then left alone. He was\n\nwearing a safety helmet which he had taken from the carrier box of the motorcycle. The\n\ncarrier box was shut but could be opened without using a key.79 When he arrived at the food centre in Jurong East, he parked his\n\nmotorcycle, rear in, at the motorcycle lots and sat there waiting with the engine still\n\nrunning. As the Second Accused was nowhere to be seen, he telephoned him. That, as seen in\n\nthe StarHub call details records, was the call made at 4.58 pm. The Second Accused told\n\nhim to go to the back of the food centre but the First Accused told him to meet him at the\n\nfront.80 At 4.59 pm, the First Accused made a call to a Chinese man known to\n\nhim as See Vatt. As he was still speaking on the handphone, the Second Accused and another\n\nIndian man approached. The other man stopped a short distance away while the Second\n\nAccused, holding a yellow plastic bag in one of his hands, went up to the motorcycle. The\n\nFirst Accused told the Second Accused to place the yellow plastic bag in the carrier box\n\nat the rear of the motorcycle. The Second Accused opened the carrier box and then closed\n\nit while the First Accused concluded the call on his handphone. The First Accused did not\n\nsee what was inside the yellow plastic bag. It did not occur to him to look inside as his\n\nthoughts were focused on bringing his wife shopping.81 When the Second Accused walked to the front of the motorcycle, the\n\nFirst Accused asked him for the $100 requested by him the day before, imploring him at the\n\nsame time not to be angry that he was asking for the money. This was because he was not\n\nemployed. The Second Accused told him he would give him the $100 loan that night and asked\n\nthe First Accused to telephone him later.82 He then told the First Accused \"to go fast\" as the two\n\npersons would be waiting at the aforesaid bus stop. When the First Accused asked how he\n\nwas going to identify the two persons, the Second Accused said they had been told what the\n\nFirst Accused looked like and would approach him.83 The First Accused then travelled on his motorcycle back to Jurong\n\nWest St 42. On arriving at the said bus stop, he saw no one. He then decided to go into\n\nthe carpark next to the block he lived in. He stopped at the motorcycle lots but left the\n\nengine running. He removed his safety helmet and then telephoned his wife who was in their\n\nflat, telling her to meet him at the ground level. When she went down, he saw that she had\n\nchanged from working clothes to a house dress. He told her he was taking her shopping. He\n\nswitched off the engine and got down from his motorcycle. He did not lock the carrier box.\n\nThey then walked to the next block (Blk 552) and sat on some stools.84 His wife asked him whether the Second Accused had given him the loan\n\nand the First Accused told her that he would be getting it that night. He also told her\n\nthat the Second Accused had handed him some things to be delivered and she asked him,\n\n\"What things?\". He told her he did not know what they were. She asked him why\n\nthe Second Accused could not do the delivery himself and the First Accused replied that\n\nthe Second Accused had asked for a favour. He also told her that the things had not been\n\ndelivered yet and when the intended recipients arrived at the bus stop, they or the Second\n\nAccused would telephone him. He then told her to go back up to their flat and get changed\n\nso they could go shopping.85 His wife mentioned that there was a man walking as though he was\n\ndrunk but he did not see that man as he received a couple of nuisance calls then. He\n\ncalled the telephone number of the nuisance caller (90035157) but there was silence at the\n\nother end.86 After that, as his wife went home to change, the First Accused rode\n\nhis motorcycle back to the bus stop. There was still no one around. He moved a distance\n\nahead, stopped and looked around. He was about to move off to return the things to the\n\nSecond Accused when the CNB car intercepted him by stopping in front of his motorcycle. He\n\ncould have escaped on his motorcycle if he wanted to but there was no reason why he should\n\ndo that.87 Three or four men came out of that car and someone said they were\n\nfrom CNB. His left hand was handcuffed. An officer then turned off the ignition and\n\nremoved the key. Insp Sivaraman asked him whether there was anything inside the carrier\n\nbox and he replied, \"There is thing\" in Tamil. Someone proceeded to open the\n\ncarrier box and he then heard \"Confirmed, Ganja\" and \"Cannabis\". Insp\n\nSivaraman walked to the rear of the motorcycle to look and then said, \"Go and arrest\n\nPaul\".88 The First Accused was still seated on the motorcycle. He was shocked\n\nat hearing the words \"Confirmed, Ganja\" and \"Cannabis\" and urinated in\n\nhis pants. Feeling giddy, he alighted from the motorcycle. An officer commented that the\n\nFirst Accused had urinated. He was then handcuffed on both hands.89 Insp Sivaraman seized his handphone and his wallet. The First\n\nAccused was then told to sit on the kerb. Insp Sivaraman asked him whether the things in\n\nthe yellow plastic bag were his, while writing in a notebook. As the First Accused could\n\nnot see what he was pointing at, he was told to stand up. It was then that he noticed the\n\ncontents. He denied having answered \"drugs\" or \"Ganja\". Insp Sivaraman\n\ndid not even ask the third, fourth and fifth questions recorded by him. For the sixth\n\nquestion, the question was \"When did you take the yellow bag?\" and not\n\n\"When did you take this Ganja?\". Again, in respect of the tenth question,\n\n\"Ganja\" should read \"bag\". Insp Sivaraman also asked, \"Do these\n\nthings belong to you?\" and the First Accused pointed and answered that the bag and\n\nthe spray in the box were his but the yellow plastic bag was handed over by the Second\n\nAccused.90 The questions in the notebook were not read back to the First\n\nAccused. He signed when told to do so, not knowing what he was signing. The word\n\n\"Ganja\" was never used by Insp Sivaraman.91 Where his statement under Section 122 (6) of the Criminal Procedure\n\nCode was concerned, he had said to ASP Soh that the Second Accused would give him the loan\n\nof $100 he had asked for and not that he would give him $100. When he informed the Tamil\n\ninterpreter about this, he was told that statement was a rough one and he should just\n\nconfine his statement to what had happened on 1 March 2001 and that, in that context, his\n\nwords meant that the Second Accused would be giving him the loan he had asked for earlier.92 The calls shown in the StarHub record to have been made after 5.11\n\npm were not made by the First Accused as he was already under arrest by then. However, the\n\nnumbers called were those of his friends and the Second Accused. One of the numbers called\n\nafter 5.11 pm was in fact the nuisance caller’s. Although Insp Sivaraman had allowed\n\nhim to make a telephone call at his request, he was in fact not given the opportunity to\n\ndo so.93 Counsel for the Second Accused put it to the First Accused that the\n\nSecond Accused had asked him whether he could deliver somethingfora friend. The\n\nFirst Accused said he was asked whether he could delivertoa friend. The Second\n\nAccused did not tell him that the Malaysian was not familiar with the area nor that he was\n\nwilling to give $100. He did not know whether that Malaysian was known as Ravi although he\n\nhad seen him with the Second Accused once.94 The First Accused denied that the contents of the yellow plastic bag\n\nwere altered between about 4.32 pm (the time SSSGT Chandrasegaran lost sight of his\n\nmotorcycle when it turned into Jurong West St 42) and about 4.50 pm (when it was spotted\n\nagain, parked between Blks 552 and 554). He had no reason to guard the carrier box but\n\nthere was money inside. He then agreed it was possible that the contents of the carrier\n\nbox had been tampered with without him noticing. He did not know whether the handle slots\n\nof the yellow plastic bag were knotted together. He also did not know whether the Second\n\nAccused was aware of the contents of the yellow plastic bag.95 Asked by the Prosecution why he had been making various calls to\n\n90035157 (the number which he claimed belonged to a nuisance caller) that day, the First\n\nAccused said that nuisance caller had been disturbing him on his handphone and so he\n\ncalled back to annoy the nuisance caller by remaining silent. He denied that he knew the\n\nsubscriber of that number or that he was supposed to hand over the yellow plastic bag to\n\nthat person.96 The First Accused was then referred by the Prosecution to a\n\nstatement recorded on 3 March 2001 by ASP Soh with the same Tamil interpreter in\n\nattendance. Asked where he had made reference to a loan in that statement, he maintained\n\nthat he had said from the very beginning that he had asked the Second Accused for a loan.\n\nHe denied the suggestion that the $100 promised to him was payment for his services in\n\ndelivering the drugs. He was not suspicious about the delivery because the $100 was meant\n\nto be given as a loan and not as payment. He did not ask the Second Accused what the\n\n\"thing\" was because he considered the Second Accused as his boss and did not\n\nknow that he would deal in drugs. This was the first time he had done such a delivery for\n\nthe Second Accused. He would have helped the Second Accused even if he had not offered the\n\nloan on 1 March 2001.97 When talking to his wife at the void deck of Blk 552, he sat facing\n\nthe motorcycle lots but a wall impeded his view of his motorcycle parked there. He did not\n\nlock the carrier box as it would look as if it was locked when closed.98 Nantha Kumar, the First Accused’s sister’s fianc, a\n\nMalaysian technician working here, testified that he was in the First Accused’s flat\n\nin Blk 554 on 1 March 2001 since the morning. Four CNB officers went to the flat at about\n\n5.10 pm as he and his fiance were preparing to leave the flat. They had intended to go\n\nout at 5.15 pm. He was arrested by the CNB officers.99 He could remember the time because he was supposed to meet his\n\nfriend at 5.30 pm at the BP petrol station along Jurong West Ave 1, a short distance away\n\nfrom the First Accused’s flat. They were planning to go shopping along Serangoon\n\nRoad. He had also looked at the wall clock in the flat when he was arrested. When he was\n\nbrought downstairs to the CNB van, he saw the First Accused beside it.100 Nantha Kumar maintained his evidence although shown the Arrest\n\nReport by one of the CNB officers which indicated that the raid at the First\n\nAccused’s flat was at 6.05 pm and that he was arrested then.",
        "THE CASE FOR THE SECOND ACCUSED": "101 The Second Accused was working as an electrical and plumbing\n\ncontractor before his arrest on 1 March 2001. He is not married and lived with his parents\n\nand his younger brother’s family in the Jurong East flat.102 On 28 February 2001, the occupants moved out temporarily to the\n\nSecond Accused sister’s flat as he intended to do some rewiring works in the Jurong\n\nEast flat on 1 March 2001 with the assistance of his elder brother, Rajinthran,\n\nSubramaniam and Segar. Subramaniam could not make it as his leg was hurting. The Second\n\nAccused told him to buy some food and meet them later.103 They worked in the flat from about 10.30 am to 12.30 pm and then\n\nproceeded to the food centre at Blk 347 for lunch. Subramaniam brought food and met them\n\nat the food centre. They ate and drank beer together there. The Second Accused was in a\n\nmess because of the morning’s work.104 The Second Accused then told Rajinthran and Segar to buy cement,\n\nwire and paint from a shop nearby. He also asked Rajinthran to collect his winnings in the\n\n4D lottery for him.105 While alone with Subramaniam, the Second Accused received a call\n\nfrom Malaysia. It was from a friend called Ravi. Ravi wanted something to be sent to\n\nJurong for him and was willing to pay $100 for that to be done. He said he would meet the\n\nSecond Accused at about 4 pm.106 The Second Accused then called the First Accused and asked him\n\nwhether he was free to run the errand. The First Accused said he would call the Second\n\nAccused when his wife returned from work. He called the First Accused because he had asked\n\nfor a loan of $100 the day before and the Second Accused thought he could get the $100\n\nfrom Ravi and give it to the First Accused as a loan. The First Accused called later and\n\nsaid he would be available after 3 pm.107 In the meantime, Rajinthran and Segar returned after buying the\n\ngoods and collecting the lottery winnings. The winnings were handed to the Second Accused\n\nwho told the two of them to return to the flat to continue with the work. The Second\n\nAccused remained at the food centre, drinking with Subramaniam. Subramaniam also won in\n\nthe 4D lottery and went to collect his winnings, returning to the table at about 5 pm.108 At about 4 pm, Ravi arrived at the food centre, bringing two bags\n\nwith him. After placing the two bags on the cabinet, Ravi joined the Second Accused for a\n\ndrink. While seated at the table, Ravi pointed to the bags and said there was something\n\ninside and that was the thing to be delivered. Ravi said he could not deliver it himself\n\nas he was busy and was not familiar with the Jurong area. His two friends (the intended\n\nrecipients) were also busy.109 The First Accused then called to say that he had arrived at the\n\nparking lots for motorcycles at Blk 347. The Second Accused told Ravi he could not run\n\nthat errand as he was in a mess but had asked a friend to do it and that friend was\n\nwaiting at the motorcycle parking lots. Ravi opened one of the bags, took out a yellow\n\nplastic bag and passed it to the Second Accused. The contents felt like a hard box but the\n\nSecond Accused could not look inside the yellow plastic bag as it was knotted at the top.110 The Second Accused took the yellow plastic bag and walked to meet\n\nthe First Accused, with Ravi following him. Ravi stopped halfway. The Second Accused told\n\nhim to go sit down at their table as there was beer there.111 When the Second Accused reached the First Accused’s\n\nmotorcycle, the latter had already lifted up the cover of the carrier box. He was seated\n\non the motorcycle. The Second Accused placed the yellow plastic bag in the carrier box and\n\nclosed it. He told the First Accused that the thing was to be delivered to Jurong West as\n\nindicated by Ravi. The First Accused suggested a bus stop along Jurong West St 42 as that\n\nwas near his flat and was convenient for him. Ravi would call his friends to meet the\n\nFirst Accused at the designated bus stop to collect the yellow plastic bag.112 The First Accused asked the Second Accused whether he could have\n\nthe $100 which he had asked for as a loan and was told to meet the Second Accused in the\n\nevening to collect the money. The Second Accused told the First Accused to go off fast. He\n\nthen returned to the table where Ravi was.113 At the table, the Second Accused asked Ravi about the $100 promised\n\nby him. Ravi then said he would go get the money. He left the two bags at the food centre,\n\nsaying he would return within half an hour.114 Turning to his Section 122 (6) of the Criminal Procedure Code\n\nstatement recorded on 2 March 2001, the Second Accused said that the words he had uttered\n\nto the First Accused – \"Then I just saidyourfriends asked me to pass to\n\nyou\" – should read as \"myfriends\".115 At about 5 pm, Subramaniam returned to the table at the food centre\n\nand sat down to have drinks with the Second Accused. A short while later, the CNB officers\n\narrived.116 SSSGT Chandrasegaran asked the Second Accused whether he had placed\n\nanything in the motorcycle and the Second Accused replied, \"Yes, is there any\n\nproblem?\". The CNB officer then asked, \"Do you know there are two kilos of ganja\n\ninside?\" to which the Second Accused replied, \"I don’t know\". The\n\nofficers then searched the surrounding area and the Second Accused’s body. A small\n\namount of cannabis was found in the Second Accused’s pocket.117 The officers took the black bag and asked whom it belonged to. The\n\nSecond Accused said he did not know. Beneath that bag was another one. When opened, there\n\nwas a lot of cannabis inside. The Second Accused was asked about this. SGT Raj Kumar\n\ninsisted he must have known about the bags and that they belonged to the Second Accused.\n\nThe Second Accused denied it.118 At the scene, he told SSSGT Chandrasegaran that the SCTS bag at the\n\ntop belonged to him but not the Brutini Bag at the bottom because the CNB officer had said\n\nthat both bags belonged to him and he was frightened. He had not seen the cannabis before\n\nthat and he became unsteady then. He did not know whether there was anything else left in\n\nthe SCTS bag after Ravi removed the yellow plastic bag. The handphone charger found in the\n\nBrutini Bag probably belonged to Ravi. His own charger was in the Jurong East flat and he\n\nhad no reason to bring it to the food centre.119 He did not learn anything about the First Accused nor remember any\n\ndiscussion about drug seizure after his arrest.120 At the Clementi Police Division HQ, the Second Accused said, in\n\nanswer to SSSGT Chandrasegaran’s question, that both the bags belonged to him because\n\nSGT Raj Kumar had said earlier that they must belong to him. He also admitted that there\n\nwere about 350 to 400 grammes of marijuana in the Brutini bag because the officers had\n\nshown the contents to him and estimated that amount. Similarly, he replied that the SCTS\n\nbag had 2 kilogrammes of marijuana because SSSGT Chandrasegaran had mentioned at the scene\n\nof arrest at the food centre that it could contain 2 kilogrammes. When he placed the\n\nyellow plastic bag into the motorcycle’s carrier box, he had no idea then that it\n\ncontained drugs.121 Some hours later, at about 1.54 am on 2 March 2001, when he was\n\ncharged by ASP Soh for trafficking in the drugs in the Brutini bag, he made a statement\n\nunder Section 122 (6) of the Criminal Procedure Code denying ownership of the Brutini bag\n\nand its contents. He admitted that the small amount of drugs found in his pocket was for\n\nhis own consumption.122 Upon cross-examination by Counsel for the First Accused, the Second\n\nAccused confirmed that the First Accused did not look inside the yellow plastic bag and\n\nneither did the Second Accused tell him what the contents were as the Second Accused did\n\nnot know himself.123 In cross-examination by the Prosecution, the Second Accused said he\n\ngot to know Ravi, a Malaysian, through another friend (Govind) about two years ago. He had\n\nmet Ravi four or five times. The Second Accused and Govind consumed cannabis and Ravi\n\nwould frequently be with Govind. Govind supplied the drugs. Ravi would give small amounts\n\nof cannabis to Govind who would share the drugs with the Second Accused. After Govind\n\nmigrated to Australia, Ravi used to call the Second Accused and asked whether he wanted\n\ncannabis. The Second Accused would tell him to bring small amounts if he had any and Ravi\n\nwould do so.124 Ravi used to bring a lot of food whenever he went to see the Second\n\nAccused. The Second Accused also borrowed money from Ravi. Therefore, on 1 March 2001,\n\nwhen he asked for a favour in delivering the yellow plastic bag, the Second Accused agreed\n\nto help him without thinking about or asking what the contents were. Anyway, Ravi was a\n\nrich man who could afford to pay the $100 and the Second Accused was having financial\n\nproblems.125 The Second Accused got to know the First Accused sometime in\n\nDecember 2000. That same day, the First Accused was introduced to Ravi as Ravi happened to\n\nbe at the food centre in Jurong East as well, together with the Second Accused’s\n\nfriends. The First Accused only said \"Hi\" to Ravi and then left.126 On 1 March 2001, the Second Accused had told Ravi that he could ask\n\nhis friend to go to the food centre in Jurong East to collect the thing instead of having\n\nit delivered to the Jurong West area but Ravi said his friend was busy and it would be\n\nconvenient to deliver it in the Jurong West area. Ravi’s friend would call to inform\n\nhim of the exact delivery point and Ravi would then tell the Second Accused. The Second\n\nAccused told Ravi that the person doing the delivery would be a fat person on a motorcycle\n\nand the delivery point would be the bus stop along Jurong West St 42. He also told the\n\nFirst Accused that two persons would be waiting at the said bus stop for him. After the\n\nFirst Accused left the carpark at Blk 347, he did not call the Second Accused again. The\n\nSecond Accused also did not call him to ask whether he had made the delivery because the\n\nFirst Accused was supposed to see the Second Accused again at about 6.30 pm (to collect\n\nthe money).127 The Second Accused added that Ravi was not working in Singapore. He\n\nworked in a travel bus agency possibly as a tour guide and travelled in and out of\n\nSingapore. He lived in Johor. He would come to Singapore two or three times a month and\n\neach time would meet the Second Accused at the food centre in Jurong East. He would call\n\nthe Second Accused before he arrived. Ravi drove a Malaysia registered Proton Saga.128 Elan Jelian, the younger brother of the Second Accused, testified\n\nthat the Second Accused’s handphone was a Nokia model. He had retrieved the charger\n\nfor that handphone from the Jurong East flat and had brought it to Court. The Second\n\nAccused’s contractor business was registered in Elan’s name but he worked in a\n\nshipping company.",
        "THE DECISION OF THE COURT": "129 The Prosecution has to prove against the First Accused that:(1) he was in possession of the yellow plastic bag and its contents;(2) the contents were 1648.8 grammes of cannabis;(3) he knew that the contents were cannabis; and(4) he had the cannabis in his possession for the purpose of\n\n  trafficking.130 In respect of the Second Accused, the Prosecution must prove that:(1) he abetted the First Accused by engaging with him in a conspiracy\n\n  to traffic the contents of the yellow plastic bag;(2) the contents were 1648.8 grammes of cannabis;(3) he knew that the contents were cannabis; and(4) pursuant to the conspiracy, he gave possession of the cannabis to\n\n  the First Accused for the purpose of trafficking.131 The nature and quantity of the drugs and the fact of physical\n\ncontrol over the yellow plastic bag and its contents were not in issue. The entire case\n\nhinged on the knowledge of both Accused persons as to the contents of the yellow plastic\n\nbag. The Prosecution must of course prove that the yellow plastic bag and its contents\n\nfound in the carrier box of the First Accused’s motorcycle were the same bag and\n\ncontents handed over by the Second Accused to the First Accused at Blk 347 Jurong East.132 I accepted the evidence of Insp Sivaraman on what transpired at the\n\nscene of the arrest of the First Accused along Jurong West St 42 despite the apparent\n\nerror in the time of the arrest, which was no more than ten minutes in any event. In a\n\nfast moving scene, with 14 officers located at various places reporting to him at various\n\ntimes and having to give instructions to match the events as they unfolded, minor\n\ndivergences in the timing of the events could be expected. I accepted that the First\n\nAccused was intercepted and arrested at about 5.25 pm and that all the calls shown to have\n\nbeen made from his handphone between 5.11 pm and 5.23 pm had been made by him. After all,\n\nall the calls between 5.11 pm and 5.23 pm were to telephone numbers that he had called\n\nearlier. His handphone had been seized by the CNB officers upon his arrest and if any of\n\nthem had made those calls, surely that would have been part of the investigations and\n\nthere was absolutely no need to deny it.133 I accepted that the questioning of the First Accused took place\n\nafter the carrier box of his motorcycle was opened. I also accepted that the First Accused\n\nanswered the questions posed to him by Insp Sivaraman in the presence of SGT Raj Kumar and\n\nthat all the questions and the answers had been dutifully recorded. His voluntary answers\n\nwere clearly damning to his assertion that he knew not what he was delivering. Insofar as\n\nall the other details at the scene of the arrest along Jurong West St 42 were concerned,\n\nfor instance, who removed the keys from the ignition, whether he was handcuffed to the\n\nfront or at his back, when he urinated in his pants, when he got off the motorcycle,\n\nwhether he was walking about or sitting down on the kerb, I considered them quite\n\nimmaterial to the issues at hand. I would only observe that it would be quite strange for\n\nthe CNB officers to have placed the handcuffs on only one of his hands and not both. I\n\ncertainly drew no adverse inference against the First Accused for urinating in his pants\n\nas even a less timorous innocent man could experience such an untimely discharge when\n\npounced upon by several men suddenly.134 Similarly, I accepted the evidence of the Prosecution regarding the\n\ntime of the raid led by W/Insp Neo on the First Accused’s flat. The\n\nProsecution’s timing would accord with the time of the arrest of the First Accused\n\nand it would certainly be more logical to raid the flat only after ascertaining that the\n\nFirst Accused had drugs on his motorcycle. No useful purpose would be served in any event\n\nby falsifying the time of the raid, which was corroborated by the raiding party’s\n\ntestimony and the Arrest Report.135 I would say the same regarding the contradictory testimony of the\n\nFirst Accused’s wife and CPL Sivarajaa concerning the events at the void deck of Blk\n\n552. Although the wife was a Prosecution witness, in the circumstances of this case, one\n\nshould not be too surprised if she were to try to tailor her evidence to match her\n\nhusband’s, which she would have an inkling of. Her testimony regarding CPL Sivarajaa\n\nwas nevertheless unreliable. She made no mention of him when she first gave evidence\n\nbefore the Court. It was also unlikely that she could have remembered his face so well\n\nafter 1 March 2001. If indeed she had seen someone stumbling along, it was not CPL\n\nSivarajaa. Again, there was no reason for CPL Sivarajaa to falsify this part of his\n\nevidence. He and SGT Affendi were on the lookout for the First Accused and there was no\n\nreason to mask the fact, if fact it be, that CPL Sivarajaa had indeed spotted the First\n\nAccused and his wife at the void deck.136 I accepted the First Accused’s evidence that the carrier box\n\nof his motorcycle was shut but not locked even after the yellow plastic bag was placed in\n\nit by the Second Accused. It was evident that a third person would not know it was not\n\nlocked unless he tried to open the cover of the carrier box. The First Accused rode his\n\nmotorcycle from Blk 347 back to Jurong West St 42. The CNB officers lost sight of him and\n\nhis motorcycle for only about 18 minutes between 4.32 pm to 4.50 pm. The First Accused did\n\nnot say that anyone had gone near his motorcycle. When the motorcycle was parked at the\n\nmotorcycle lots between Blks 552 and 554, it was obvious that a careful man like the First\n\nAccused would have made sure that he could still keep an eye on his motorcycle. After all,\n\neven if he knew nothing about the contents of the yellow plastic bag (which was clearly\n\nnot the case), he had money kept in the carrier box and $61 could not be a small amount\n\nfor someone who had to importune the Second Accused for a $100 loan. I had no doubt that\n\nthe yellow plastic bag and its contents found by Insp Sivaraman at the point of arrest\n\nwere the same ones placed by the Second Accused at Blk 347.137 Where the Second Accused was concerned, I accepted the evidence of\n\nSSSGT Chandrasegaran relating to the arrest at Blk 347 and the events thereafter. If the\n\nSecond Accused was so intimidated by SGT Raj Kumar’s assertions that the two bags\n\nmust be his, how did he have the gumption to acknowledge only the SCTS bag at the top and\n\nto deny ownership of the Brutini bag at the bottom? Clearly, it was because he knew that\n\nthe SCTS bag had been emptied of its contents earlier and the contents were with the First\n\nAccused and that the Brutini bag contained incriminating evidence. There was no allegation\n\nin any event that SGT Raj Kumar or any other officer had threatened him in any way.138 The recording of the questions and answers at Clementi Police\n\nDivision HQ by SSSGT Chandrasegaran was witnessed by SGT Raj Kumar and SSGT Azman. Again,\n\nno inducement, threat or promise was alleged by the Second Accused in Court. He said he\n\ncould not remember whether the CNB officers had discussed the arrest of the First Accused\n\nand the seizure of the drugs in the yellow plastic bag. It could not be that he would\n\nanswer that the SCTS bag contained 2 kilogrammes of marijuana simply because SSSGT\n\nChandrasegaran had said it could have or that he would regurgitate what he had heard about\n\nthe Brutini bag as if it was his personal knowledge. Like the First Accused’s oral\n\nstatement to Insp Sivaraman, the Second Accused’s answers to SSSGT\n\nChandrasegaran’s questions were damning and totally demolished his defence of lack of\n\nknowledge. It made no difference even if the Nokia battery charger found in the Brutini\n\nbag was not for his handphone. Only the Second Accused knew why it was inside the bag\n\ntogether with the drugs.139 Both Accused persons insisted that they did not ask nor look into\n\nthe yellow plastic bag and knew nothing about its contents. I found their evidence\n\nincredible. How could they not have at least asked what the size of the thing to be\n\ndelivered was? What if it turned out to be a table? Further, they would surely want to\n\nknow whether the thing was fragile or perishable. After all, the box-like thing could well\n\nhold a precious vase which could be easily broken or even be ice-cream which would have\n\nmelted in the carrier box!140 Ravi, the Malaysian friend, was in the travel business and had\n\ndriven to Singapore from Johor on many occasions, in particular to the food centre at\n\nJurong East. It was impossible that Ravi would be so familiar with Jurong East but was so\n\nunsure about the area around Jurong West, not more than five minutes away by car, that he\n\nhad to bring the things to Blk 347 so that they could be delivered to Jurong West St 42.\n\nAlternatively, if the intended recipients could make their way to the bus stop along\n\nJurong West St 42, they could just as well have been informed to meet Ravi at Blk 347\n\nJurong East. As a further alternative, the Second Accused could have gone in Ravi’s\n\ncar and shown him the way to Jurong West St 42. If his \"messy\" state had not\n\nstopped him from spending a few hours at a public place, I saw no reason why he should\n\nfight shy of going with Ravi for a ten-minute round trip. Ravi also did not appear to have\n\nbeen in a terrible hurry to go elsewhere.141 Ignorance is a defence only when there is no reason for suspicion\n\nand no right and opportunity of examination and ignorancesimpliciteris not enough\n\n(Yeo Choon Huat v PP[1998] 1 SLR 217). Ravi was known to the Second Accused to\n\nhave access to drugs. Taking all the facts into consideration, it was patently clear that\n\nboth the Accused persons did not need to ask or to look into the yellow plastic bag\n\nbecause they knew what was inside.142 On the issue of whether the $100 promised to the First Accused was\n\nintended to be a loan or a payment, I would say the various statements seemed to indicate\n\nit was a payment for the delivery service rather than a loan, although a loan had\n\noriginally been requested. Even if it was a loan, with the rentals already collected, it\n\nwas strange that the First Accused still required a $100 loan on 1 March 2001. Further,\n\nwhen the money was not to be handed over until the evening of 1 March 2001, it was again\n\nstrange that the First Accused, who had intended to use the money or part thereof for a\n\ngift for his wife, would immediately ask his wife to join him to go shopping. In any\n\nevent, it made no material difference to the Charges whether it was a loan or a payment as\n\neither would be some form of consideration for delivering the drugs and consideration need\n\nnot even be proved here. I emphasize at this juncture that I am not in anyway implying\n\nthat the Tamil interpreter was less than diligent or competent in his duties. On the\n\ncontrary, I felt he had interpreted faithfully during the recording of the various\n\nstatements.143 The Prosecution was entitled to invoke the presumption concerning\n\ntrafficking in Section 17 (d) of the Misuse of Drugs Act against the First Accused.\n\nHowever, in the light of what I have set out above, it was clear that the First Accused\n\nhad the drugs for the purpose of trafficking and there was no need to rely on the\n\npresumption. The Charge against the First Accused alleged trafficking \"at about 5.15\n\npm\". In my view, that approximate time was sufficient for the facts here even though\n\nI have said the arrest of the First Accused took place at about 5.25 pm. The occasion\n\nspecified in the Charge was manifestly clear to the First Accused.144 Direct evidence of a conspiracy between two or more persons would\n\nrarely be available. \"A frequent method of proving a conspiracy is to show that the\n\nwords and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object\n\nor design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by\n\narrangement beforehand\" (Lai Kam Loy & Ors v PP[1994] 1 SLR 787at page\n\n795). In my opinion, the Prosecution has proved the conspiracy alleged. Both the Accused\n\npersons were aware that they were handling drugs. They were in constant communication with\n\neach other and were obviously playing their respective roles in moving the drugs in\n\nquestion from one place to another.145 Both Charges having been proved beyond reasonable doubt, I\n\nconvicted both the Accused persons and passed the mandatory death sentence on them.Sgd:TAY YONG KWANGJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
