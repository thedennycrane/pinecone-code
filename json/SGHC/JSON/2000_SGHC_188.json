        "Reasoning": "12. I was of the view that although there were some factors pointing\n\ntowards the Italian courts as appropriate for the trial of the action, those factors did\n\nnot outweigh the factors which pointed to Singapore as the more appropriate forum. Even if\n\nthe factors had been evenly balanced, the defendant would not have been able to discharge\n\nits burden and the application would have failed. But this was not an evenly balanced\n\ncase: the weight of the factors clearly fell in favour of Singapore.13. First, the SBLCs are expressly governed by Singapore law. If the\n\naction were to be heard in Italy, legal experts from Singapore would have to be produced\n\nthere to give evidence. This would not be satisfactory: there would be language\n\ndifficulties and also differences in approach between the Italian civil law system and the\n\nSingapore common law system. Singapore law is best expounded by Singapore courts. This was\n\na very powerful factor pointing towards Singapore.14. The SBLCs also contained a non-exclusive jurisdiction in favour of\n\nthe Singapore courts. InBambang Sutrisno v Bali International Finance Ltd[1999] 3 SLR 140, the Court of Appeal held that the court should give weight to this clause even\n\nthough it is non-exclusive and gives a right to the parties to institute proceedings in\n\nany other jurisdiction they may deem fit. A clause of this nature, even though\n\nnon-exclusive, indicates that the parties consider Singapore to be an appropriate forum\n\nfor the hearing of their dispute.15. The defendant argued that weight should not be given to either the\n\ngoverning law or the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause because the SBLCs had been procured\n\nby fraud and were therefore void. I could not accept this argument. The SBLCs have not yet\n\nbeen established to be void. It is their status that is at issue in the case and the court\n\ncannot determine an interlocutory application on the basis of an allegation that has not\n\nbeen proved. In this regard, I adopt, with respect, the following view expressed by the\n\nCourt of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Ontario inAsh v Corporation of Lloyds[1992] 9 OR (3d) 755:‘The plaintiffs argue that the exclusive jurisdiction clauses\n\n  should be ignored because if there has been fraud in the circumstances surrounding the\n\n  procurement of the contracts then the contracts are void ab initio and the clauses\n\n  relating to forum are of no effect. I agree with McKeown J, and with the authorities he\n\n  cites, to the effect that an allegation that a contract is void ab initio does not make it\n\n  so until a final judgment of the court. If the plaintiffs can commence an action with an\n\n  allegation of fraud which would void the contract and thus vitiate a choice of\n\n  jurisdiction clause from the outset, then they may succeed on the merits while enjoying\n\n  their own choice of jurisdiction or fail on the merits while depriving the defendant of\n\n  the contracted choice. These clauses are too important in international commerce to permit\n\n  that anomalous result to flow.’ (per Carthy JA at p 758)The above passage was quoted in the Australian case ofFai General\n\nInsurance Co Ltd v Ocean Marine Mutual Protection and Indemnity Association Ltd[case\n\n50135 of 1996, Supreme Court, New South Wales, unreported] where the court held that the\n\nprovisions for exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in certain contracts it was\n\nconsidering, would survive the avoidance ab initio of the contracts so as to direct\n\ndetermination of the disputes over avoidance to the English courts.16. It is only logical that the governing law and jurisdiction clauses\n\nin this case are considered to be valid for the purposes of this application\n\nnotwithstanding the challenge mounted to the SBLCs by the defendant. Applications for a\n\nstay, like this, are usually heard before the defence is filed and before any trial on the\n\nmerits. If the defendant’s argument were accepted it would mean allowing the\n\ndefendant to neutralise the effect of the jurisdiction clause simply by alleging fraud on\n\nthe part of the plaintiff.17. Further, in this case the SBLCs are prima facie valid documents.\n\nThey were issued by the defendant bank and sent to the plaintiff via authenticated SWIFT.\n\nThe plaintiff was entitled to treat the issue of the documents as having been properly\n\nauthorised by the defendant. It is only if the defendant is able to prove that an employee\n\nof the plaintiff was aware that the SBLCs were issued without authority as part of the\n\nfraud, and that that employee’s knowledge has to be ascribed to the plaintiff, that\n\nthe defendant will be able to avoid the documents. Otherwise, notwithstanding\n\nPigozzo’s fraud, the defendant would be bound by the SBLCs. When a document is sent\n\nby one bank to another through the authenticated SWIFT system, the recipient bank is\n\nrelieved of making enquiries as to the validity of the document or the authority of the\n\nsender. Thus, the plaintiff’s rights under the SBLCs, including its right to rely on\n\nthe jurisdiction clause, cannot be prejudiced at an interlocutory stage by a mere\n\nallegation of fraud.18. The defendant’s strongest point was that much of its evidence\n\nwas in Italy. Its witnesses are Italian speaking and its documents in the Italian\n\nlanguage. Also the police investigators are in Italy. This factor had, however, to be\n\nbalanced against the fact that the plaintiff’s witnesses are here. They do not speak\n\nItalian and their documents are in English. Wherever the trial is held one set of\n\nwitnesses will have to travel and one set of documents would have to be translated. On\n\nbalance therefore this was a neutral factor.19. The defendant sought to add weight to this factor by stating it\n\nwould not be able to bring Pigozzo to Singapore. Pigozzo’s evidence can, however, be\n\nadduced in Singapore by video conferencing. Even if that route were not possible, the\n\ndefendant would be able to prove Pigozzo’s fraud by the testimony of his colleagues\n\nand superiors as to his authority and as to the unauthorised actions which their\n\ninvestigations revealed. As the plaintiff submitted, it is not necessary in order to prove\n\na fraud that the evidence of the fraudster himself be adduced. The fraud can be as well\n\nproved by testimony from investigators and others with knowledge of the books and\n\nprocedures of the defendant and the powers delegated to Pigozzo. Not even the police are\n\nnecessary.20. The plaintiff has a similar difficulty. Most of its witnesses could\n\ntravel to Italy if necessary. The plaintiff would not, however, be able to ensure Samuel\n\nLee’s presence at a trial in Italy since first, he is no longer their employee and\n\nsecondly, he is likely to be reluctant to go to a country where he may be arrested like\n\nPigozzo was. Whilst Pigozzo’s evidence would be helpful to the defendant, it is not\n\nessential. Samuel Lee’s testimony would, however, be essential in determining the\n\nextent of the fraud and the plaintiff’s knowledge, if any, of it since the defendant\n\nclaims that he conspired with or assisted Pigozzo in the fraud. It should be noted that at\n\nthis stage Pigozzo has not implicated Lee but if he does so in a trial in Italy the\n\nplaintiff would have great difficulty in challenging that evidence in the absence of Lee.21. The defendant named others apart from Lee and Pigozzo who were or\n\nwere suspected of being involved in the fraud. Apart from Pigozzo, none of these have any\n\nconnection with Italy. The whereabouts of two, Ghosh and one Ante Devic, a Yugoslavian,\n\nare unknown. On the other hand, one Ng Yean Kiat is a Singaporean and the defendant has\n\nalso mentioned ‘some other high level officials’ of the plaintiff as being\n\ninvolved and these must be in Singapore. Overall, the evidence necessary to prove\n\ntwo-thirds of the defendant’s case (Samuel Lee’s participation and the\n\nplaintiff’s knowledge) is to be found in Singapore rather than Italy.22. The defendant also relied on a decree of preventive seizure made by\n\nthe Italian court. This decree it said was issued at the request of the public prosecutor\n\nand was not within the control of either party. As a result of the decree, if the\n\nplaintiff were to succeed in an action in Singapore, the defendant would be in contempt of\n\nthe Italian court if it sought to satisfy the Singapore judgment. It would be in an\n\ninvidious position because it would be faced with two contradictory court orders.23. In this regard, I accepted the plaintiff’s submission that the\n\nargument was misconceived. First, the purpose of the decree was to prevent further fraud\n\nfrom being perpetrated through the use of the SBLCs. It cannot logically relieve the\n\ndefendant from honouring its legal obligations. If the defendant were right, it would be\n\nrelieved from paying from the SBLCs even if the Italian civil courts rule in the\n\nplaintiff’s favour on the SBLCs. That cannot be so. Further, the plaintiff’s\n\nexpert witness, Professor Mazzoni, stated in his affidavit that if a court of competent\n\njurisdiction rules in favour of the plaintiff on the SBLCs, an application might be made\n\nto the criminal courts to allow payment. The defendant did not deny that that could be\n\ndone. Secondly, in any event, the decree presents no difficulty for the defendant. If the\n\ndefendant is correct, the decree excuses it from paying on any judgment against it and\n\ntherefore it is the plaintiff who will be disadvantaged by the decree not the defendant.24. Having considered the factors that connected the action with Italy\n\nand those that connected it with Singapore, I was not able to conclude that Italy was\n\nclearly and distinctly the more appropriate forum. I therefore dismissed the appeal.Judith PrakashJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
