        "Introduction": "1 The appellant claimed trial before a District Judge (“DJ”) to a charge of sexual assault by penetration, an offence under s 376(2)(a) punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”). The appellant was represented for part of the trial, but his counsel discharged himself after the victim had testified. He was unrepresented for the remainder of the trial. 2 The DJ convicted the appellant and sentenced him to seven years and four months’ imprisonment, and four strokes of the cane. The DJ’s grounds of decision are reported asPublic Prosecutor v Tan Wai Luen[2020] SGDC 128 (“GD”). 3 The appellant appealed against his conviction and sentence. After hearing the parties’ submissions, I dismissed the appeal. I gave brief reasons orally for my decision at the hearing on 18 September 2020, and I now set out my full grounds of decision.",
        "Background": "4 The appellant was a Muay Thai instructor at the Encore Muay Thai gym (the “Gym”). The victim had attended a free Muay Thai trial session conducted by the appellant at the Gym where he was working in October 2016. After the session ended, she accepted the appellant’s offer of a free Thai massage. In the course of the massage, the appellant allegedly inserted his finger into her vagina. This formed the substance of the charge against the appellant.",
        "The victim’s account of events leading up to the massage": "5 On the victim’s account, she had signed up for a free Muay Thai trial class at the Gym, scheduled for 1 October 2016 at 12.00pm.1Foot Note 1×Notes of Evidence (“NE”) 15 May 2019 at p 32 ln 1–5The victim testified that she arrived late at the Gym at about 12.15pm.2Foot Note 2×NE 15 May 2019 at p 36 ln 1–3The appellant introduced himself as the instructor for the class before conducting a body analysis on her. Three other female participants then entered the Gym and joined the victim for the class, which lasted for about one to one and a half hours with two or three breaks of between five to ten minutes each.3Foot Note 3×NE 15 May 2019 at p 39 ln 1–11During two of these breaks, the victim bumped into the appellant and engaged in small talk with him.4Foot Note 4×NE 15 May 2019 at p 42 ln 1–27 6 After the trial class, the victim went to the toilet to change out of her exercise clothes. When she came out, the appellant offered her a cup of ‘Kopi-O’ (ie,black coffee), which he claimed would help to break down fats. The victim took a few sips of the coffee at his insistence. The three other participants were no longer around and she surmised that they had left.5Foot Note 5×NE 15 May 2019 at p 43 ln 1 to p 44 ln 5The appellant then showed the victim a price list and asked her to sign up for a gym package, which she declined. When the victim saw a Thai massage service listed on the said price list, she enquired as to whether the Gym offered Thai massages. The appellant responded that it did, and that he was the only one trained to offer it.6Foot Note 6×NE 15 May 2019 at p 44 ln 15–21The appellant then offered her a free massage. The victim testified that she accepted his offer because it was free, and because the appellant was trained to offer Thai massages and “should know…the places to avoid on a woman’s body”.7Foot Note 7×NE 15 May 2019 at p 45 ln 6–31",
        "The appellant’s account of events leading up to the massage": "7 The appellant testified that on the day of the alleged incident, he had told the other students to wait for the victim to arrive as she was late for class. When she reached, they commenced the Muay Thai training.8Foot Note 8×NE 9 October 2019 at p 13 ln 1–4He stopped the class for five-minute breaks as he wanted to take smoke breaks. He went down from the Gym which was on the second level to the open area at ground level to smoke, and he testified that the victim also went down to the same area to smoke. They made some small talk, and the victim asked him what the massage bed in the Gym was for. The appellant informed her that it was mainly for sports therapy and “myofascial”, which according to the appellant, was meant for muscle relaxation.9Foot Note 9×NE 9 October 2019 at p 13 ln 24 to p 14 ln 16; p 14 ln 31–32The victim then asked whether the table was used for massages, as she was under the impression that the Gym would also offer Thai massages since it was a Muay Thai gym. The appellant testified that he initially stated that the Gym did not offer massages. However, as the Gym had recently opened and he would do anything to obtain more sales, he told the victim that he could try to give her a Thai massage if she really wanted one, but that he was “not well-trained” and did not have a licence for it.10Foot Note 10×NE 9 October 2019 at p 15 ln 1–18 8 After class, the victim asked the appellant whether there was any way to cut down fats. The appellant told her that the only method he used was to drink ‘Kopi-o Kosong’, and offered to make a cup for her, which she accepted. When the other students had left and the victim was drinking her coffee, the appellant asked her whether she still wanted to have a Thai massage.11Foot Note 11×NE 9 October 2019 at p 16 ln 1–18",
        "The victim’s account of the massage and the alleged incident": "9 On the victim’s account, the appellant then told her to go behind the curtain and to take off all her clothes except for her panties and lie face down on the massage table. The victim did as instructed and used a towel to cover her back.12Foot Note 12×NE 15 May 2019 at p 48 ln 27–28When the appellant came into the area covered by the curtain, she turned around to check that it was the appellant. He then switched off the lights.13Foot Note 13×NE 15 May 2019 at p 46 ln 2–20According to the victim, he rubbed Ginvera olive oil on his hands and started to massage her calf. He then moved to massaging her thigh and then her back. Afterwards, he moved back to massaging her calf, and proceeded to massage her inner thigh area with both hands.14Foot Note 14×NE 15 May 2019 at p 52 ln 19–22; p 53 ln 15This made her feel uncomfortable, and she therefore moved her legs to indicate to the appellant that he was “not supposed to massage that”. The appellant then went back to massaging her calf.15Foot Note 15×NE 15 May 2019 at p 55 ln 22 to p 56 ln 9She testified that the appellant had shifted the towel such that his hands were in direct contact with her skin during the massage.16Foot Note 16×NE 15 May 2019 at p 57 ln 15–28At this point, the towel was shifted to the top of her back,17Foot Note 17×NE 15 May 2019 at p 58 ln 1–14but was still covering her buttocks.18Foot Note 18×NE 16 May 2019 at p 63 ln 28–30 10 The appellant then went up to her inner thigh area near her vagina,19Foot Note 19×NE 15 May 2019 at p 58 ln 15–17before his finger “went under [her] panty” and he inserted his finger into her vagina.20Foot Note 20×NE 15 May 2019 at p 59 ln 2–9; ln 28–31She testified that something was inserted which had the texture of a fingernail.21Foot Note 21×NE 15 May 2019 at p 60 ln 2–5; NE 16 May 2019 at p 2 ln 22–28When asked to use a ruler to estimate the approximate depth to which he inserted his finger, she estimated 2.5cm.22Foot Note 22×NE 15 May 2019 at p 62 ln 4–24According to the victim, it was an “in and out thing” and he put his finger into her vagina for a “few seconds”23Foot Note 23×NE 15 May 2019 at p 62 ln 28–30because she turned and shouted “Oi” at him when it happened. He then looked at her with a straight face with a “look that he didn’t did [sic] anything wrong”.24Foot Note 24×NE 15 May 2019 at p 61 ln 24–32She testified that she felt “angry”, “upset” and “very violated” because she had demonstrated trust in the appellant by accepting his offer of a massage but he had broken that trust.25Foot Note 25×NE 15 May 2019 at p 63 ln 19–25 11 Thereafter, he asked her to flip over, and he continued to massage her shoulder and legs.26Foot Note 26×NE 15 May 2019 at p 64 ln 1–4She testified that she did not leave because she was only wearing her panties and she was fearful that if she tried to leave suddenly, he could hit her or rape her. He was a Muay Thai instructor and likely to be stronger than she was.27Foot Note 27×NE 15 May 2019 at p 64 ln 17–28 12 When the massage ended an hour to an hour and a half later, the appellant walked out of the curtained area. She put on her clothes and went down the staircase to leave. She then discovered that the door was locked from the inside.28Foot Note 28×NE 15 May 2019 at p 65 ln 5–31; p 67 ln 27–30She was able to unlock the door to let herself out.29Foot Note 29×NE 15 May 2019 at p 68 ln 7–9She testified that although she did not see the appellant locking the door, he was the only staff member present and the door was locked from the inside.30Foot Note 30×NE 15 May 2019 at p 69 ln 1–4",
        "The appellant’s account of the massage and the alleged incident": "13 The appellant admitted to offering the victim a massage but denied sexually assaulting her. On his account, he started the massage from the victim’s shoulder before moving down to her legs. After he told her to flip over, he massaged her front shoulder, her knee area, her thigh and her calf. The massage lasted for about 45 to 50 minutes. Thereafter, she changed back into her clothes, and he asked her whether she would sign up for lessons with the Gym. She said that she would give it a thought and left.31Foot Note 31×NE 9 October 2019 at p 17 ln 11–31 14 During the cross-examination of the victim, Mr Walter Silvester (“Mr Silvester”) was still representing the appellant and had not yet discharged himself. Mr Silvester specifically put to the victim that the appellant “[might] have accidentally touched [her] around the vagina area and when he realised his mistake, he immediately stopped massaging the area”. The victim replied that it was not an accident.32Foot Note 32×NE 16 May 2019 at p 27 ln 24 to p 28 ln 7Mr Silvester later put to the victim that the appellant “[might] have had some accidental contact with [her] vagina but it was a mistake”. The victim responded that if it had been a mistake, the appellant would have apologised.33Foot Note 33×NE 16 May 2019 at p 47 ln 27 to p 48 ln 6Thereafter, Mr Silvester put to the victim that “if there was any contact with [her] private parts, it was … [an] accident and [she was] actually aware that it may have been an accident”.34Foot Note 34×NE 16 May 2019 at p 48 ln 17–20He then put to the victim again that she “did not tell anyone [about the alleged incident] because at that time [she was] unsure that [it] was actually intentional” and that she “thought it … could have been an accident”, to which the victim disagreed and confirmed that the act was intentional.35Foot Note 35×NE 16 May 2019 at p 50 ln 11–17He subsequently put to the victim again that she “did not say or do anything [during the massage], because nothing actually happened”, and that “[a]t most, it was an accidental touch … [b]ecause…it was dark”.36Foot Note 36×NE 16 May 2019 at p 70 ln 22 to p 71 ln 8The appellant’s counsel further put to the victim that “at most, [the appellant] may have accidentally touched [her] vagina area and [she] may have felt it such that it was a bit more forceful that [sic] she thought”, and that it was “an accident basically”.37Foot Note 37×NE 16 May 2019 at p 72 ln 14–18Finally, it was again put to the victim that “because it was slippery, it was oily, [the appellant might] have accidentally touched [her] vagina area, and [she] misconstrued this to be an insertion”, and that “this was an accident and never intentional”.38Foot Note 38×NE 16 May 2019 at p 73 ln 3–9 15 However, during the appellant’s evidence-in-chief, when he was no longer represented, he testified that there was “no way” he could have sexually assaulted the victim because “she was wearing her … undergarment and plus the … towel is covered already”. He also testified that he stopped his massage at the lower half of the victim’s thighs. In order to have sexually penetrated her, he would have needed to go nearer to the victim’s inner thighs but he did not do so.39Foot Note 39×NE 9 October 2019 at p 18 ln 21 to p 19 ln 3",
        "Events following the alleged incident": "16 It was undisputed that the victim did not make a police report immediately after the alleged incident. The victim testified that she had intended to make a police report, but that she needed to head home to look after her son who was ill. As she was about to leave the Gym, she checked her phone and noticed that her sister had sent her a WhatsApp message stating that she was taking a long time. She interpreted this message to mean that something was wrong with her son, who had already been having a fever the day before.40Foot Note 40×NE 15 May 2019 at p 69 ln 11–31; p 70 ln 5–9She explained that she did not relate the incident to her family or friends as it was “very personal” and she “[did not] want to get judged” by them.41Foot Note 41×NE 15 May 2019 at p 70 ln 19–27 17 It was also undisputed that the victim had sent text messages to the phone operated by the Gym on 2 October 2016 (ie,the day after the alleged incident) at about 11.33am, and that Ms Chan Li Ping, Vivian (“Vivian”), who was an instructor and co-owner at the Gym, had responded to the victim’s text messages and told the victim to give her a call. According to the victim, she wanted to inform Vivian about the alleged incident because the appellant might have “done it before” or “maybe he would do it in the future again to someone else”.42Foot Note 42×NE 15 May 2019 at p 71 ln 32 to p 72 ln 7 18 The victim testified that she gave Vivian a call which lasted for about five to seven minutes, during which she told Vivian that what she had messaged her was true, and that the alleged incident had happened the day before (ie, on 1 October 2016). Vivian then informed her that she would speak to the appellant about it.43Foot Note 43×NE 15 May 2019 at p 75 ln 27 to p 76 ln 15The victim did not keep in contact with Vivian or contact anyone from the Gym thereafter.44Foot Note 44×NE 20 August 2019 at p 32 ln 14–20The victim also testified that she had intended to make a police report after work but that before she could do so, she received a phone call from Bedok Police Station informing her that Vivian had lodged a police report regarding this incident.45Foot Note 45×NE 15 May 2019 at p 75 ln 18 to p 77 ln 5Following the police report, the victim was seen at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital on 2 October 2016 at the police’s request. A report dated 31 October 2016 was prepared by Dr Angsumita Pramanick (“Dr Pramanick”), a Senior Staff Registrar at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in relation to the alleged incident. 19 Vivian testified that she spoke to the appellant after the call with the victim. She showed him the text messages sent between her and the victim and asked him whether he had committed the alleged offence. The appellant allegedly “said [that] he did not [a] lot of times”. Specifically, he said that he “did not do the Thai massage, he did not finger her”, and that “[a]ll he did was to conduct the trial only”. The appellant said that “after he conducted the trial, then [the victim] left together with the rest [of the girls who came for the trial]”. Vivian further testified that she decided to make a police report because the company’s image was at stake. It could be a case of rape and they did not know whether the victim would tell others about it.46Foot Note 46×NE 20 August 2019 at p 32 ln 28 to p 33 ln 26It was undisputed that Vivian had lodged a police report on 2 October 2016 at about 2.07pm.47Foot Note 47×Record of Appeal (“ROA”) at p 434 20 The appellant also gave a police statement dated 3 October 2016, wherein he denied giving the victim a massage or having sexually assaulted her.48Foot Note 48×ROA at p 445 21 The appellant first testified during his evidence-in-chief that he had lied to the police because he “did not know the seriousness of this case”.49Foot Note 49×NE 9 October 2019 at p 19 ln 9–20Later, upon questioning from the court, the appellant stated that he lied because he “thought he was in deep trouble”. When asked to clarify what he meant, the appellant then stated that he “did not know that giving [a] false statement is a serious trouble”. Finally, he stated that he lied because:50Foot Note 50×NE 9 October 2019 at p 46 ln 20 to p 49 ln 7 … what people tell me is that, the --- whatever woman say in Singapore…even though you never do we should confirm got do---okay…because I never, um, molest her or doing the penetration assault on her. So, I denied to the police for all the incidents…",
        "The decision below": "",
        "Conviction": "22 The DJ found the victim’s evidence to be unusually convincing and determined that she had no reason to concoct a very serious allegation against the appellant (GD at [60]). She found that the appellant did insert his finger into the victim’s vagina in the course of massaging her (GD at [55]). The victim “gave a coherent, detailed, and credible account” of what the appellant had done to her, and her testimony was consistent with the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, including her text messages and phone conversation with Vivian (GD at [56]). The DJ found the victim’s explanation for not leaving the massage immediately after the sexual assault,ie,that she was afraid that the appellant might harm her, to be credible. The DJ also accepted the victim’s explanation that she did not make a police report on the same day as she wanted to take care of her sick child. The victim had also testified that she was “experiencing a mixed bag of emotions” after the incident. The DJ found that the victim’s conduct during and soon after the incident to be “reasonable and within the realm of human responses” to be expected for a sexual assault victim (GD at [58]–[59]). 23 The DJ found that in contrast, the appellant’s version of events lacked credibility. His testimony that he did not go near the victim’s inner thigh area during the massage and therefore could not have accidentally touched the victim’s vagina contradicted his earlier case of a possible accident, which was repeatedly put to the victim by his previous counsel. It was also not put to the victim that he did not massage her at her inner thigh area (GD at [61]). Further, the reasons he gave for lying to the police were “contradictory and plainly unconvincing”. He was trying to tailor his account and had given three different reasons in an attempt to explain away his lies (GD at [62]).",
        "Sentence": "24 The DJ found that as a starting point, the offence fell within Band 1of the framework inPram Nairv Public Prosecutor[2017] 2 SLR 1015 (“Pram Nair”). The present case therefore warranted a lower indicative sentence as compared to the sentence imposed inPram Nair,taking into account the overall difference in the levels of culpability and harm (GD at [71]). In particular, the present offence was committed over a much shorter duration, and the appellant had ceased offending once the victim shouted at him (GD at [82]). 25 The DJ considered that there was only one offence-specific aggravating factor in the present case, which was a limited degree of abuse of trust. The DJ found that the appellant did not act with a high degree of deliberation and planning, such that premeditation was not an aggravating factor in this case. There were also no offender-specific aggravating or mitigating factors. 26 The DJ also had regard to other post-Pram Naircases which fell into Band 1 of the framework. The DJ found that a sentence of seven years and four months’ imprisonment in addition to four strokes of the case was appropriate in the present case.",
        "The appeal against conviction": "",
        "Parties’ cases": "Appellant’s case 83 I turn next to the appeal against sentence. The appellant argued that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 84 The appellant submitted that the framework inPram Nairshould not be applicable to all cases of digital vaginal penetration without exception. The sentencing bands did not capture the full range of seriousness for offences involving digital vaginal penetration. In particular, they did not account for cases which had no offence-specific aggravating factors,  which according to the appellant included the present case, or cases where the offence-specific factors were less aggravated than that inPublic Prosecutor v Koh Nai Hock[2016] SGDC 48 (“Koh Nai Hock”).InKoh Nai Hock, the offender had held himself out as an alternative medicine practitioner. He penetrated the victim’s anus and vagina with his finger by falsely representing that he was treating her for infertility. He faced 14 charges under s 376(2) of the Penal Code, and was sentenced to two to three years’ imprisonment per charge, and a global sentence of seven years’ imprisonment. No caning was imposed as the offender was over 60 years of age. The offender’s appeal against sentence was dismissed by the High Court. 85 The appellant proposed that the lower bound of Band 1 in thePram Nairframeworkshould have been set at less than four years’ imprisonment. In making this argument, the appellant compared thePram Nairframework to the sentencing bands set out inKunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor[2018] 4 SLR 580 (“Kunasekaran”) in respect of offences under s 354(1) of the Penal Code, andGBR v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2018] 3 SLR 1048 (“GBR”) in respect of offences punishable under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. The appellant argued that theupper limitof Band 1 in the sentencing bands set out inKunasekaranandGBRwas about one-fifth of the statutory maximum sentence, whereas the lower bound of Band 1 inPram Nairwas about one-third of the statutory maximum sentence. 86 The appellant contended that the DJ had erred in finding that abuse of trust was an offence-specific aggravating factor in this case, as it was not reasonable for the victim to have placed trust in the appellant. The appellant was also not in a position of responsibility vis-à-vis the victim, such as in a doctor-patient relationship, and he had only met her for the first time that day. 87  The appellant further argued that his sentence of seven years and four months’ imprisonment and four strokes of the case, falling within Band 1 of thePram Nairframework, was disproportionate. The appellant compared the sentence imposed in this case to sentences imposed in cases of outrage of modesty and aggravated outrage of modesty, and submitted that lower sentences were imposed in those cases despite the presence of aggravating factors which were far more serious. 88 The appellant also argued that the DJ should have considered that thePram Nairframework should not have been strictly applied as there were no aggravating factors present and a very low degree of culpability and harm caused. The present case was less serious than that inKoh Nai Hock, and a sentence lower than the global sentence of seven years’ imprisonment imposed in that case would therefore be appropriate. 89 The appellant further argued that the DJ’s decision on sentence was wrong in law and manifestly excessive when the facts of the present case were compared to the cases which the DJ had relied upon in coming to her decision, namelyPram Nair,Public Prosecutor v Ridhaudin Ridhwan bin Bakri and others[2020] 4 SLR 790 (“Ridhaudin”) andPublic Prosecutor vWee Teong Boo[2019] SGHC 198, the last of which has since been overturned.  The DJ should have imposed a sentence that was far lower than that imposed inPram NairandRidhaudin. 90 The appellant thus submitted that an appropriate imprisonment term would be two years’ imprisonment, following the individual sentences imposed inKoh Nai Hockwhich was the most analogous precedent, and four strokes of the cane or such number of strokes as to adequately register the court’s disapproval of the appellant’s conduct. Respondent’s case 91 The respondent submitted that the DJ had appropriately considered the factual matrix and decided that it fell within Band 1 of the framework inPram Nair. The DJ had correctly found that abuse of trust was an aggravating factor in this case, but had erred on the side of caution in finding that premeditation in this case would not be considered as an aggravating factor. The respondent argued that the appellant had acted in a manner which was “deliberate, calculated and considered” and that the offence was therefore premeditated.109Foot Note 109×RWS at paras 58–60 92 In response to the appellant’s arguments, the respondent made the following submissions:110Foot Note 110×Certified Transcript (14 September 2020) at p 39 ln 14 to p 41 ln 6 (a) The Court of Appeal had laid down the sentencing framework for offences of sexual assault by penetration inPram Nair, which was calibrated downwards from the framework inNg Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor[2017] 2 SLR 449 (“Terence Ng”)for rape offences. (b) It would be absurd to peg the sentence for offences of sexual assault by penetration to that of outrage of modesty, as the former offences are more egregious. (c) Band 1 in thePram Nairframework applies to a situation where there are no aggravating factors. There was nothing so exceptional in the present case warranting a departure from the prescribed range of sentences in Band 1. (d) The Court of Appeal had specifically cautioned against relying onKoh Nai Hockas a precedent for individual sentences. (e) There were offence-specific aggravating factors present in this case.",
        "Decision": "93 The relevant sentencing framework for offences of sexual assault by penetration under s 376 of the Penal Code is set out inPram Nair.The framework essentially requires the sentencing court to consider the offence-specific aggravating factors to identify the appropriate sentencing band within which the offence falls (Pram Nairat [159];Terence Ngat [50], [53] and [57]). The said bands are as follows: (a)Band 1(seven to ten years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane): These cases feature no offence-specific aggravating factors, or such factor(s) are only present to a very limited extent. (b)Band 2(10 to 15 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane): These cases usually contain two or more offence-specific aggravating factors. (c)Band 3(15 to 20 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane): These involve the most serious cases, by reason of the number and intensity of the aggravating factors. 94 After identifying the sentencing band within which the offence falls, the court should then take into account any offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors to determine the appropriate sentence. 95 As submitted by the respondent, the Court of Appeal inPram Nairhad transposed theTerence Ngframework applicable to rape offences to the offence of digital penetration by lowering the range of starting sentences for each band to reflect the lesser gravity of the offence (Pram Nairat [159]). It is clear that the framework inPram Nairwas intended to capture the full range of seriousness in offending, including cases where there were no offence-specific aggravating factors or where these factors were present to a limited extent. 96 I make a brief comment in respect of the appellant’s contentions that the lower bound of Band 1 of thePram Nairsentencing framework should not start at about one-third of the statutory maximum sentence. The Court of Appeal inTerence Nghad commented on the lower bound of ten years’ imprisonment in Band 1 of the framework for rape offences, noting that it was the judicial benchmark sentence for rape of all forms, as established inChia Kim Heng Frederick v Public Prosecutor[1992] 1 SLR(R) 63 (Terence Ngat [49]). The lower bound in thePram Nairframework would similarly amount to a benchmark sentence set for digital penetration offences (involving penetration using a finger), and there was nothing objectionable about the court setting such a benchmark sentence. As the respondent also pointed out, offences involving sexual assault by penetration are generally more egregious and invasive than offences of outrage of modesty, and there was therefore no reason to peg the starting point in thePram Nairframework to that ofKunasekaranorGBR. 97 I also agreed with the respondent that the appellant’s reliance onKoh Nai Hockwas misplaced. This case pre-dated thePram Nairframework and the prosecution had not appealed against the sentence. The Court of Appeal inPram Nairhad categorised the case, which had only one offence-specific aggravating factor, as a case which would have fallen within Band 1. The court noted that the global sentence imposed in that case was seven years’ imprisonment and was therefore still broadly “somewhat consistent” with the Band 1 sentencing range, but the individual sentences of two to three years would be “some distance” from the sentencing bands. The court then explicitly cautioned against relying on the case as a precedent for individual sentences (Pram Nairat [169]). 98 The Court of Appeal also considered other precedent cases which it would categorise as falling within Bands 2 and 3, and noted that the actual sentences imposed in those cases were lower than the minimum sentences specified inPram Nairfor the respective sentencing bands. The court then stated that those cases “should not as a rule be relied upon”, and that a judge who was minded to give a similar sentence as that imposed in those cases must set out clear and coherent reasons for departing from thePram Nairsentencing bands (Pram Nairat [170]). It is clear that the sentences for cases decided pre-Pram Nairhave to be viewed with circumspection, and that the sentencing bands inPram Nairshould apply barring exceptional facts. 99 The DJ found only one offence-specific aggravating factor – abuse of trust. She formed the opinion that there was at best limited abuse of trust, and properly considered that the assault was momentary and not persistent. I agreed with her characterisation of this case as falling within the low end of Band 1 of thePram Nairframework. I saw no reason to treat this as such an exceptional case as to fall completely outside the framework. 100 The court inTerence Nghad suggested the case ofPublic Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 (“Mohammed Liton”) as an example of a case which might call for a departure from the prescribed sentencing bands for rape offences (at [49]). InMohammed Liton,the parties were in love, and had engaged in intimate and consensual sexual activities close in time to the rape and even after the rape itself, which pointed to the incident as one which was wholly unplanned and unforeseen (Mohammed Litonat [119]). Given that similar offence-specific aggravating factors that apply to rape offences would also apply to offences involving sexual assault by penetration, it is conceivable that a case with exceptional facts similar to those inMohammed Litoncould warrant a departure from the prescribed sentencing bands inPram Nair. 101 InMuhammad Anddy Faizul bin Mohd Eskah v Public Prosecutor[2020] SGCA 113 (“Muhammad Anddy”), the offender pleaded guilty to and was convicted on nine charges, with 59 charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, all of which were sexual offences. The offender was a youthful offender who was approaching 16 years of age at the time of the earliest offence and was aged 18 years by the date of his last offence. The Court of Appeal stated that it had little reason to disagree with the High Court Judge’s ruling on the sentences for each charge as they were in line with the sentencing frameworks inPram NairandTerenceNg. I note that the court also upheld two of the individual sentences for sexual assault and rape which were below the lowest ends of the sentencing frameworks inPram NairandTerence Ngrespectively.The Court of Appeal stated that the mitigating factors and the totality principle had been given sufficient consideration by the High Court Judge, resulting in the comparatively low sentences. Pertinently, the court stated that it had “little doubt that had the [offender] been older, his sentence would have been more severe” (Muhammad Anddyat [11]). 102 In the present case, the victim and the appellant were strangers, and the appellant had opportunistically sexually assaulted the victim during a massage. The appellant was also not a young offender. There was nothing exceptional about the present facts such that thePram Nairframework should not apply. 103 I also did not think that the DJ had erred in comparing the present case toRidhaudinandPram Nair, and in drawing her conclusion that the sentence in this case should be lower than that imposed in the two precedent cases. The DJ had correctly considered that the conduct of the offenders in those cases was more culpable, and categorised the present case as one falling within the lower end of Band 1 in thePram Nairframework. 104 The appellant was a first-time offender, but he had claimed trial and was thus not entitled to any sentencing discount. I was unable to find any substantial mitigating factors. 105 In the circumstances, I was of the view that the DJ’s calibration of the sentence was appropriate. The sentence was not manifestly excessive. While lower sentences may have been imposed in past cases on broadly similar facts, this is largely explicable on the basis that all the precedents cited on behalf of the appellant either pre-datedPram Nairand/or did not specifically concern offences under s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code.",

        "Conclusion": "106 For the above reasons, the appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed. I was satisfied that there was no reason to differ from the DJ’s decision. She had not erred in law or in her findings of fact. See Kee OonJudge Yu Kexin (Yu Law), Devathas Satianathan (Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP) and Poon Guokun Nicholas (Breakpoint LLC) for the appellant; Kavitha Uthrapathy (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent."
