        "Held": ", allowing the plaintiffs’\n\nappeal:(1) The following orders were made: (a)\n\nthe plaintiffs were to re-serve the wit of summons within jurisdiction for which purpose\n\nthe second defendant would appoint solicitors to accept service; (b) failing his\n\nappointment of solicitors, the default judgment against the second defendant would stand;\n\n(c) if the second defendant appointed solicitors to accept service, it would be without\n\nprejudice to his right to take fresh steps to set aside the writ; (d) pending appointment\n\nof solicitors by the second defendant to accept service, all execution proceedings by the\n\nplaintiffs were stayed (see  30).(2)Service through Malaysia\n\njudicial authorities, of writs issued in Singapore, came about as a direct result of the\n\nruling inUnited Overseas Bank Ltd v Wong Hai Ong[1999] 1 MLJ 474, extending the\n\nholding inSunkyong International Inc v Malaysian Rubber Development Corporation Bhd[1992] 2 MLJ 146(see  31 and 32).(3) Non-compliance with para 5 of the\n\nPractice Direction is not fatal and would not automatically render service thereafter by\n\nway of substituted service null and void. The Practice Direction is not law but merely a\n\ndirection for administrative purpose and incomplete compliance would only amount to an\n\nirregularity, not the setting aside of service of the writ (see  34 to 37);Re S\n\nNirmala ex-parte: The New Straits Times Press[1988] 2 MLJ 616;Karen Ahmad v\n\nStandard Chartered BankMallal’s Digest vol 2(2) 4 ed (1998 reissue);Re Yeap\n\nChee Fun ex-parte Pernas Trading[2000] 5 MLJ 510; andKoh Thong Kuang United\n\nMalayan Banking Corporation Bhd[1994] 3 MLJ 509followed.(4) Where Singapore plaintiffs are\n\ndependant on service being effected by the Malaysian judicial authorities, it would be\n\nunduly harsh to penalise the plaintiffs and or their solicitors for the acts/ omissions of\n\nthe process server (see  37).(5) Here, it cannot be disputed that the\n\nsecond defendant was fully aware, even before substituted service was effected, that a\n\nwrit had been issued against him by the plaintiffs. There was thus no question of his\n\nhaving suffered any prejudice as a result of not knowing of the advertisements (see \n\n38 and 39).(6) The purpose of the appointment\n\nrequirement at both the second defendant’s office and home could be either to ensure\n\nthat the service was successful or equally to ensure that it was unsuccessful as the\n\nsecond defendant could absent himself from the appointed venue at the appointed time. It\n\nseemed strange that a defendant, whose liability to the plaintiffs as guarantor had\n\ncrystallised because judgment had been obtained against the principal debtor, could be in\n\na position to dictate terms to the plaintiffs on how he wished to be served with their\n\nlegal process (see  40).(7) It was not unreasonable under the\n\ncircumstances for the plaintiffs to think that the second defendant was avoiding service\n\n(see  41 and 42).(8) The second defendant at no time raised\n\nthe merits of any defence he may have had to the plaintiffs’ claim against him. His\n\nentire complaint was focussed on the fact that he had been embarrassed and felt that his\n\nreputation had been somehow maligned by the advertisements (see  43).NB: 2nddefendant’s appeal\n\nvide CA 600150 of 2001 was dismissed on 24 July 2002.",

The plaintiffs in this case are a French bank with a branch in\n\nSingapore operating at No 20 Collyer Quay #01-01, Tung Centre, Singapore 049319. The first\n\ndefendants (the company) were a customer of the plaintiffs in 1998. Its loan facilities\n\nfrom the plaintiffs were guaranteed by the second defendant, who is both its director and\n\nshareholder. The company markets timber logged inter alia, in Sarawak and The Cameroons.2. Due to the decline in the demand for logs in Japan and other\n\nmarkets, the company was unable to repay the loan facilities to the plaintiffs by the due\n\ndate. Consequently, the plaintiffs' solicitors gave notice to the company on 12 February\n\n1999, that its loan facilities had been cancelled and demanded immediate repayment of the\n\nsum of US$3,616,172.15 due and outstanding as at that date. By a separate letter also\n\ndated 12 February 1999 to the second defendant, the plaintiffs' solicitors made a demand\n\non the second defendant as guarantor.3. Thereafter the plaintiffs gave the company more time to pay.\n\nPursuant to a revised schedule of repayments, the company made 3 instalment payments\n\n(albeit late) totalling US$288,750 as principal and US$130,105.03 as interest. No further\n\npayments were made after 9 July 1999.4. Consequently, the plaintiffs commenced these proceedings against\n\nboth defendants on 12 April 2000. As against the company, the plaintiffs' solicitors had\n\nno difficulty in effecting service on its registered office at No. 190, Middle Road\n\n#16-03, Fortune Centre, Singapore 188979; this was done on 28 April 2000 by the service\n\nclerk of the plaintiffs' solicitors. No appearance was entered to the writ of summons by\n\nthe company within the deadline of 8 (eight) days. Accordingly, the plaintiffs obtained\n\njudgment in default of appearance against the company on 4 July 2000.5. Service on the second defendant was considerably more difficult and\n\ncomplicated than on the company. According to the address stated on the writ of summons,\n\nthe second defendant is resident in Kuala Lumpur at No. 2109, High Rise 2, Riana Green\n\nCondominium, Jalan Tropicana Utara, 47410, Tropicana, Petaling Jaya Selangor. The address\n\nwas furnished to the plaintiffs' solicitors by a staff member of the company when the\n\nplaintiffs made unsuccessful attempts to serve letters on him at the company's office. The\n\nsecond defendant had also written to the plaintiffs' solicitors on 17 July 2000 to confirm\n\nthat he was residing at his Kuala Lumpur address; he further requested the plaintiffs to\n\nfix an appointment through his secretary, to effect service on him at his residence,\n\nfurnishing a telephone number for the purpose.6. In accordance with O 11 of the Rules of Court (the Rules), the\n\nplaintiffs applied for and obtained, an order of court (on 9 June 2000) for service to be\n\neffected outside jurisdiction on the second defendant, at his aforementioned address or\n\nelsewhere as he may be found in Malaysia. The time for entry of appearance by the second\n\ndefendant was fixed at 21 days after service of the writ.7. Pursuant to the order of court and pursuant to O 11 r 4 of the\n\nRules, the plaintiffs made a request on 6 July 2000 (through the Registrar) to the\n\nRegistrar of the High Court at Kuala Lumpur, for service on the second defendant to be\n\neffected at his Kuala Lumpur residence. The plaintiffs made inquiries on the status of\n\nservice, by letters dated 6 September and 5 December 2000 addressed to the Registrar's\n\nMalaysian counterpart and forwarded through the Registrar. On 11 January 2001, the\n\nplaintiffs' solicitors also wrote to the Registrar stating that the second defendant may\n\nbe located at the office of a Malaysian company, apart from the address stated in the\n\nwrit. Finally, on 18 January 2001, the plaintiffs' solicitors received from the Registrar,\n\na reply dated 11 January 2001 from the process server (of the Sessions and Magistrates'\n\nCourts in Petaling Jaya), advising that his service attempts on the second defendant were\n\nunsuccessful and enclosing therewith his affidavit to that effect.8. According to the process server's affidavit, he had called at the\n\nsecond defendant's residence on 20 December 2000 at 12.20pm, and was told by a female\n\nChinese there was no such person there by the name of the second defendant. Two (2) days\n\nlater, the deponent attempted service again and found the door locked. Similarly, the door\n\nwas locked when the process server attempted a third service on 23 December 2000. In a\n\nsecond affidavit filed on 19 October 2001, the process server clarified his earlier\n\naffidavit as regards the first service attempt -- he said he was told by a female Chinese\n\nthat she did not know the second defendant and there was no such person by his name at the\n\naddress.9. On 14 February 2001, the plaintiffs' officer Danny Chia spoke with\n\nthe second defendant (who was in Malaysia) on the telephone. When Danny Chia inquired\n\nwhether he was prepared to meet with the plaintiffs to discuss the claim under the\n\nguarantee, the second defendant declined; he pointed out that the plaintiffs had already\n\nissued a writ which (he repeated) could be served on him at his Kuala Lumpur residence or,\n\nat his office by prior appointment with his secretary, Elaine.10. According to the (second) affidavit filed by the plaintiffs'\n\nsolicitor Herman Jeremiah (Jeremiah) on 15 February 2001 to support the plaintiffs'\n\napplication for substituted service, the plaintiffs' solicitors interpreted the above\n\nparagraph to mean that the second defendant was deliberately evading or at least delaying,\n\nservice (by asking for prior appointment to be first made through his secretary).11. Accordingly, the plaintiffs applied (ex-parte) to court on\n\n15 February 2001 for substituted service to be effected on the second defendant by\n\nadvertising in one issue of the New Straits Times and in one issue of the Malaysian\n\nBusiness Times, the English and business dailies respectively, circulating in Malaysia.\n\nThe plaintiffs' application was granted on 22 February 2001 and pursuant thereto, notice\n\nof the writ of summons was advertised in the two (2) Malaysian newspapers on 21 March\n\n2001. As an extra step, the plaintiffs took the precaution of faxing copies of the\n\nadvertisements to the second defendant to make sure he had actual notice of the writ.12. On 10 April 2001, the second defendant wrote to the plaintiffs'\n\nsolicitors (copied to the Registrar) to object to the mode of service; he indicated he\n\nwould not be entering an appearance to the writ as his stand was that service had not been\n\nvalidly effected on him. The plaintiffs' solicitors replied on 19 April 2001 by forwarding\n\nto the second defendant's Kuala Lumpur residence (besides the writ) copies of the\n\naffidavit, application and order of court for substituted service as well as his personal\n\nguarantee. The second defendant was given time until 27 April 2001 to enter an appearance\n\nto the writ. The second defendant was separately notified about the documents which had\n\nbeen forwarded to him, by a fax from the plaintiffs' solicitors on 30 April 2001. The\n\nsecond defendant did not enter an appearance to the writ. Accordingly, on 28 May 2001, the\n\nplaintiffs entered judgment in default of appearance against the second defendant.13. On 8 August 2001, the second defendant applied to set aside the\n\nsubstituted service as well as the default judgment, in Summons in Chambers no. 1851 of\n\n2001 (the application) on the following grounds:(i) the plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the aspects of Malaysia law\n\n  that relate to the service of originating process;(ii) at all material times the plaintiffs had actual knowledge of the\n\n  whereabouts of the second defendant for the purpose of effecting personal service of the\n\n  writ of summons;(iii) the plaintiffs failed to make frank and full disclosure in their\n\n  application for the order allowing substituted service against the second defendant and(iv) the second defendant had offered by letter dated 17 July 2000 to\n\n  make an appointment to accept service of the writ of summons.The application was heard and granted by the Deputy Registrar on 18\n\nOctober 2001, against whose decision the plaintiffs appealed by way of Registrar's Appeal\n\nNo. 210 of 2001 (the Appeal).14. The Appeal came up for hearing before me on 6 November 2001 and I\n\nallowed it; parties also appeared before me on 8 November 2001 to clarify the orders I had\n\nmade earlier. The second defendant has now appealed against my decision (in Civil Appeal\n\nNo. 600150 of 2001).The application15. Before I consider the submissions raised in the court below, it\n\nwould be useful at this juncture to set out the rule governing service outside\n\njurisdiction; O 11 r 4(1) of the Rules states:(1) Where in accordance with these Rules, an originating process is to\n\n  be served on a defendant in any country with respect to which there subsists a Civil\n\n  Procedure Convention providing for service in that country of process of the High Court,\n\n  the originating process may be served —(a) through the judicial authorities of that country; or(b) through a Singapore consular authority in that country (subject to\n\n    any provision of the convention as to the nationality of persons who may be so served).16. I turn next to the arguments canvassed below on behalf of the\n\nsecond defendant. In brief, his counsel submitted that the plaintiffs had not shown that\n\nit was impractical to serve the writ personally on the second defendant, relying on O 62 r\n\n5(1) of the Malaysian Rules of the High Court 1980 (the High Court Rules) which states:If, in the case of any document which by virtue of any provision of\n\n  these Rules is required to be served personally on any person, it appears to the Court\n\n  that it is impracticable for any reason to serve that document personally on that person,\n\n  the Court may make an order in Form 135 for substituted service of that document.I should point out that the above Order was inpari materiawith\n\nour O 62 r 5(1) until the latter was removed from the Rules with effect from 18 June 2001.\n\nCounsel also submitted that service on the second defendant did not comply with Practice\n\nNote No. 1 of 1968 of the Malaysian High Court (the Practice Direction) governing\n\nsubstituted service; therefore service was bad. The plaintiffs had failed to disclose\n\ncertain material facts in their affidavit in support of their application for substituted\n\nservice and in their affidavit filed to obtain default judgment.17. Reliance was also placed on O 11 r 3(3) of the Rules which states:An originating process which is to be served out of Singapore need not\n\n  be served personally on the person required to be served so long as it is served on him in\n\n  accordance with the law of the country in which service is effected.18. The Practice Direction states:The practice governing applications for substituted service in the High\n\n  Court in Malaya shall follow that in the High Court in England, as provided for in Order\n\n  10 Rule 2 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1957. The practice, taken from the 1957 White\n\n  Book (page 88) is here reproduced:1. Two calls should be made2. The calls should be made at the defendant's residence, permanent or\n\n  temporary, if known otherwise, or if the claim relates to the defendant's business, at his\n\n  business address. If the defendant has left the address given on the writ, this should be\n\n  stated in the affidavit. If a copy of the document to be served is left, it must be in a\n\n  sealed envelope addressed to the defendant.3. The calls should be made on weekdays and at reasonable hours.4. Each call should be on separate days.5. The second call should be made by appointment by letter sent to the\n\n  defendant by ordinary prepaid letter post, giving not less than two clear days' notice,\n\n  enclosing a copy of the document to be served, and offering an opportunity of making a\n\n  different appointment.6. On keeping the appointment, the process server should inquire\n\n  whether the defendant has received the later of appointment with the copy document, and if\n\n  it is stated that the defendant is away, inquiry should be made whether or not letters are\n\n  being forwarded or should have been forwarded to an address within the jurisdiction; the\n\n  object is to show that the defendant has received communications sent to him.7. The affidavit in support of the application should deal with all the\n\n  foregoing requirements and should further state whether the letter of appointment has been\n\n  returned or not, and any answer received should be exhibited. A copy of the document to be\n\n  served should accompany the affidavit.No prescribed form is necessary for the letter of appointment.The letter of appointment should ordinarily be sent by the solicitor\n\n  for the plaintiff after ascertaining from the process server in the High Court and other\n\n  courts their available times and dates for the second call. The facts regarding the letter\n\n  of appointment should be stated in the affidavit in support.19. The second defendant's counsel submitted that the plaintiffs'/the\n\nprocess server's non-compliance with paras 5 and 7 of the Practice Direction was fatal to\n\ntheir application for substituted service. The second defendant had (in para 8 of his\n\nsupporting affidavit for the application) deposed that he runs a large conglomerate of\n\ncompanies and would usually be at his office or the offices of his business associates or\n\nconsultants during normal business hours. As such, it was unrealistic to hope to serve the\n\nwrit of summons on him at his home during normal business hours. He went further to say\n\nthat the plaintiffs should be aware of this fact as they knew the extent of his business\n\ninterests. Despite knowing his office address (as reflected in their letter dated 11\n\nJanuary 2001 to the Registrar stating that the second defendant may be located at the\n\noffices of Pan Pacific Asia Bhd), the second defendant complained that the plaintiffs'\n\nsolicitors made no attempts at service at his office. The second defendant also alleged\n\nthat the plaintiffs' solicitor Jeremiah had deliberately omitted mention of his office\n\naddress as an alternative place for service in his second affidavit (para 10supra).\n\nThis allegation was rebutted by Jeremiah in another affidavit he filed on 17 September\n\n2001, which I shall advert to later.20. The second defendant's affidavit was reinforced by an affidavit of\n\na Kuala Lumpur lawyer Jayne Koe Gaik Bee (Koe) who was called to the Malaysian Bar in\n\nJanuary 1993. Koe referred to the second defendant's letter of 17 July 2000; she observed\n\nthat the plaintiffs had refused to make an appointment for service as requested by the\n\nsecond defendant in his aforesaid letter. According to the second defendant, he received\n\nno reply to this letter.21. Koe opined that Practice Directions in Malaysia are to be strictly\n\nadhered to and non-compliance was fatal; she cited the appellate court's decisions inYeo\n\nYoo Teik v Jemaah Pengadilan Sewa, Pulau Pinang & Anor[1996] 2 MLJ 54,Raja\n\nGuppal a/l Ramasamy v Sagaran a/l Pakiam[1999] 2 MLJ 677andCapital Insurance Bhd\n\nv Kasim bin Mohd Ali[2000] 1 MLJ 193to support her proposition. The cases came afterRe S Nirmala a/p Muthiah Selvarajah t/a Shamin Properties; ex-parte The New Straits\n\nTimes Press[1988] 2 MLJ 616first gave the Practice Direction judicial recognition. I\n\nshall revert to these cases later and likewise on the authorities cited by the plaintiffs.22. Koe said she could not understand why the plaintiffs could not fix\n\nan appointment with the second defendant for service of the writ when the parties were in\n\ncommunication (according to Danny Chia's affidavit) by telephone and fax. She had been\n\ninformed by the second defendant (and she verily believed) that the plaintiffs knew that\n\nthe former was and still is a director of a public company Pan Pacific Asia Bhd, to which\n\noffice the plaintiffs had in fact forwarded copies of the newspaper advertisements. Koe\n\npointed out that an order for substituted service is only necessary if the plaintiffs had\n\ndifficulties in serving the writ of summons on the second defendant but, this had not been\n\nmade out by the plaintiffs. Consequently, the affidavit of Jeremiah, alleging that the\n\nsecond defendant was deliberately evading service and all reasonable methods/means had\n\nbeen used to effect personal service on him, could not hold water. She opined that the\n\ncourts in Malaysia take a very dim view of orders obtainedex-partewithout full\n\nand frank disclosure and have on many occasions set aside such orders. In all likelihood\n\ntherefore, she was of the view that courts in Malaysia would set aside the aforesaid order\n\nfor substituted service and by extension, the default judgmentex debito justitiae.23. The plaintiffs countered Koe's affidavit and the second defendant's\n\nsubmissions with an affidavit from a Malaysian lawyer (Adrian Hii Muo Teck [Hii] who has\n\nbeen in practice since 1995) to say that their non-compliance with the Practice Direction\n\nwas only an irregularity which did not nullify the proceedings. Hii relied on the\n\nMalaysian Court of Appeal decision inLee Tain Tshung v Hong Leong Finance Bhd[2000] 3 MLJ 364for his proposition. He opined that practice directions/notes do not have the\n\nforce of law and are intended to do no more than directions for administrative purposes,\n\ncitingOoi Bee Tat v Tan Ah Chim & Sons Sdn Bhd[1995] 3 MLJ 465.24. Hii pointed out that service was not effected by the plaintiffs but\n\nthrough the Malaysian judicial authorities. Consequently, the process of service was\n\nbeyond the control of the plaintiffs and the charge of non-compliance by the plaintiffs\n\nwith the Practice Direction was misconceived. The attempts at service by the court process\n\nserver were an official action of the Malaysian judicial authorities outside the control\n\nof the plaintiffs; any omission should not be a ground to challenge the validity of the\n\nproceedings. In any case, according to the holdings inKaren Ahmad Aliyuddin v Standard\n\nChartered BankMallal's Digest vol 2(2) 4 ed (1998 reissue) para 4141,Malayan\n\nUnitedFinance Bhd v Sun Chong Construction Sdn Bhd[1995] 4 MLJ 741and,Re\n\nYeap Chee Fun: ex-parte Pernas Trading Sdn Bhd[2000] 5 MLJ 510, courts had\n\nspecifically stated that non-compliance with para 5 of the Practice Direction was at most\n\nan irregularity which did not nullify proceedings.25. On the issue that the plaintiffs made no attempts to effect service\n\nat the second defendant's office, Hii pointed out that para 2 of the Practice Direction\n\ncontemplated that service should be effected at the defendant's residence, if known and\n\nthis was affirmed in the caseRe S Nirmala ex-parte The New Straits Times Press(para 21supra). Hii noted that except for one occasion, the second defendant\n\nhimself had requested (even in his letter dated 17 July 2000 to the plaintiffs'\n\nsolicitors) for service to be effected on him at his residence. Consequently, there was no\n\nrequirement to effect service on the second defendant at his office address.26. Hii also relied on O 62 r 5(1) of the High Court Rules (para 16supra)\n\nfor his comment that the court may make an order for substituted service if it appears to\n\nthe court that it is impracticable for any reason to serve the same personally. He argued\n\nthat it was for the plaintiff to satisfy the court that personal service had been\n\nunsuccessful and once that burden was discharged and an order granted, in an application\n\nfor substituted service, the order will not be subject to challenge;a fortiori, if\n\nthe defendant as in this case, came to know of the writ before judgment was entered\n\nagainst him. Advertisements of notices of the writ were one of the usual methods of\n\neffecting substituted service of process in Malaysia.27. Before I set out the reasons for my decision, I should also refer\n\nto two (2) other affidavits filed by the parties. The first was an affidavit filed on the\n\nsecond defendant's behalf by one Safiah Wong (Safiah) who deposed that she was/is a friend\n\nof his bodyguard (Lau Kueng Chai). Safiah admitted she was the female Chinese referred to\n\nby the court process server (Shah). She had a different version from Shah of what\n\ntranspired at the service attempt on 20 December 2000 – she denied telling Shah there\n\nwas no such person as the second defendant at the address; she had in fact told Shah that\n\nthe second defendant was not in but was at his office. Shah did not ask her for the\n\naddress of the second defendant's office nor when he was expected to be home. She had\n\ninquired of Shah why he was looking for the second defendant and was told that Shah had\n\nsome documents to serve on the second defendant relating to a case of a Singapore bank\n\nloan; Shah then left.28. The other affidavit was that of Jeremiah filed on the plaintiffs'\n\nbehalf. In his (third) affidavit (filed on 17 September 2001), Jeremiah specifically\n\naddressed the second defendant's allegation that he had failed to disclose material facts\n\nin his earlier (second) affidavit filed to support the plaintiffs' application for\n\nsubstituted service namely that:(a) he was 'careful not to allege' that the plaintiffs' Danny Chia had\n\ntold the second defendant that the plaintiffs wanted to serve the writ on the second\n\ndefendant;(b) he did not disclose the second defendant had invited the plaintiffs\n\nto effect service by prior appointment with his secretary;(c) he had omitted to state that the plaintiffs were aware that service\n\nwas possible at an alternative (office) address.29. Jeremiah rebutted the allegations by:(a) referring to his second affidavit wherein (at para 6) he had set\n\nout the full text of Danny Chia's conversation with the second defendant;(b) he had disclosed/exhibited in his second affidavit a copy of the\n\nsecond defendant's letter dated 17 July 2000;(c) stating that the fact of the second defendant having his office at\n\nthe address of Pan Pacific Asia Bhd was not material to the plaintiffs' application for\n\nsubstituted service because the plaintiffs/he had by then formed the view (albeit it may\n\nhave been erroneous) that the second defendant was evading service, due to the\n\n(mis)information contained in Shah's first affidavit, that the second defendant did not\n\nreside at the address stated to be his residence. In any event, the second defendant was\n\nsued in his personal capacity as guarantor of the company, not as a director of Pan\n\nPacific Asia Bhd or anything else to do with this company. Further, to the plaintiffs'\n\nknowledge, the second defendant had several other addresses including in Sarawak.The fact remained, Jeremiah asserted, the second defendant had no\n\ndefence on the merits to the plaintiffs' claim on the guarantee.The decision30. I had made the following orders when I allowed the Appeal with\n\ncosts in the cause, reversing the orders made below (save for costs);(a) the plaintiffs were to re-serve the writ of summons within\n\njurisdiction for which purpose the second defendant would appoint solicitors by 13\n\nNovember 2001 to accept service;(b) failing his appointment of solicitors, the default judgment against\n\nthe second defendant would stand;(c) if the second defendant appointed solicitors to accept service, it\n\nwould be without prejudice to his right to take fresh steps to set aside the writ,(d) pending appointment of solicitors by the second defendant to accept\n\nservice, all execution proceedings by the plaintiffs were stayed.Order (d) was necessary as I was informed by counsel for the plaintiffs\n\nthat his clients had commenced execution proceedings against the second defendant on the\n\ndefault judgment by seizing the second defendant's shares in the company. When the parties\n\nappeared before me on 8 November 2001 to clarify my earlier orders, the plaintiffs applied\n\nand which application I granted, to extend the writ for a further period of one (1) year.\n\nThis was necessary before the original writ which expired 12 months from 12 April 2000 as\n\nagainst the second defendant, could be re-served on him.31. As a preliminary point, it bears mentioning that service through\n\nMalaysian judicial authorities, of writs issued in Singapore, came about as a direct\n\nresult of the ruling inUnited Overseas Bank Ltd v Wong Hai Ong[1999] 1 MLJ 474,\n\nfollowing the decision by the Malaysian Court of Appeal inSunkyong International Inc v\n\nMalaysian Rubber Development Corporation Bhd[1992] 2 MLJ 146. InSunkyong'scase the (local) second defendants had obtained an ex-parte order to issue a third party\n\nnotice on the first defendant, a foreign company incorporated in the United States and, to\n\neffect service of their third party notice on the first defendant at a specified address\n\nin New York through agents of the second defendants. The first defendant applied to set\n\naside the order for service outside jurisdiction and appealed when their application was\n\nrefused. The Court of Appeal held that as there was no Civil Procedure Convention in\n\nsubsistence in the United States, O 11 r 6(2) of the High Court Rules applied and, service\n\nwould have to be effected through the government of the United States or through the\n\nMalaysian consular authority, contrary to what was ordered and done in the case.\n\nConsequently, the appeal of the first defendant was allowed and the order for service\n\noutside jurisdiction, set aside.32. The Kuching High Court inUnited Overseas Bank'scase\n\ninterpretedSunkyong'sratio decidendi to extend to service of foreign legal\n\nprocessin Malaysiahaving to go through Malaysian judicial authorities. In that\n\ncase, the plaintiffs who are a Singapore bank, commenced action against the defendant in\n\nSingapore to recover a loan the bank had extended to him. The writ and statement of claim\n\nwere served on the defendant in Kuching by the plaintiff's agents, based on an order of\n\ncourt for service outside jurisdiction granted by the Singapore court. Subsequently,\n\njudgment in default of appearance was entered against the defendant and the plaintiffs\n\nregistered the judgment in the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak. The defendant did not\n\nattempt to set aside the judgment but applied to set aside registration of the judgment\n\ninter alia, on the ground that service of the writ had not been properly effected on him.\n\nThe court extended the holding inSunkyong'scase. Not only was service of a\n\nMalaysian legal process in a foreign country through a private agent not valid (as it\n\nconstituted the exercise of the judicial powers of the Malaysian courts beyond their\n\nterritorial limits) but, service in Malaysia of foreign legal process through private\n\nagents was also not valid.33. I begin my review of the cases relied on by the two (2) Malaysian\n\nlawyers by looking at those cited by Koe. Apart fromRe S Nirmala ex-parte: The New\n\nStraits Times Press, the other three (3) cases she cited had nothing to do with the\n\nPractice Direction.Yeo Yoo Teik v Jemaah Pengadilan Sewa, Raja Guppal v SagaranandCapital Insurance Bhd v Kasimall concerned other practice directions namely Practice\n\nDirections No. 2 of 1991, No. 1 of 1996 and No. 1 of 1992 respectively, relating to\n\nextensions of time for filing of records of appeal. Further, the practice directions came\n\nunder a different regime altogether, namely the Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994, not the\n\nHigh Court Rules. Consequently, I cannot accept that it was the definitive pronouncement\n\nby the Malaysian appellate court, that the Practice Direction must be strictly adhered to\n\n(as Koe had contended in her affidavit), when it was not even the subject matter of appeal\n\nin the three (3) cases. The cases cited by Hii were more in point.34.Re S Nirmala'scase relied on by Koe (also by Hii) in fact\n\nsupported the plaintiffs' position. There, the question that arose for determination by\n\nthe High Court was whether the Registrar was right to have refused to grant an order for\n\nsubstituted service of the bankruptcy notice on the ground that the Practice Direction had\n\nnot been complied with, when the whereabouts of the person to be served were unknown to\n\nthe appellant. The court held that the Practice Direction had no application.35. Similarly, the issue inKaren Ahmad v Standard Chartered Bankwas whether the judgment creditors were required to comply with the Practice Direction,\n\nbefore they could apply for an order for substituted service of the bankruptcy petition on\n\nthe judgment debtor. As in our case, the process server had failed to comply with para 5\n\nthereof in that, he had not first made an appointment for personal service by letter with\n\nthe debtor. The High Court held that it was not necessary in all cases for the Practice\n\nDirection to be complied with. Similarly, the court inRe Yeap Chee Fun ex-parte Pernas\n\nTradingheld that there was no serious non-compliance with the substantive\n\nrequirements of the Practice Direction when an order for substituted service of a\n\nbankruptcy notice was granted, based on the process server's affidavit that he was told\n\nthe judgment debtor had gone out, on all three (3) occasions when he attempted service,\n\nand after three (3) further unsuccessful attempts were made at personal service, at\n\nanother address furnished by the judgment debtor.36. For completeness, I should also refer to the case ofKoh Thong\n\nKuang v United Malayan Banking Corporation Bhd[1994] 3 MLJ 509which decision the\n\ncourt inRe Yeap Chee Fun's case had followed. There, the respondent bank had\n\nobtained judgment and subsequently, an order for substituted service of their bankruptcy\n\nnotice against the appellant, which was then effected. He appealed when his application to\n\nset aside the bankruptcy notice (on the ground that the order for substituted service was\n\nimproperly obtained as he had resided in England for the preceding 6 years) was dismissed.\n\nThe Court of Appeal held, based on the evidence, that the bank was justified in concluding\n\nthat the appellant was deliberately evading service and was entitled to serve him at his\n\nlast known address although it was clear that he was no longer residing there. The Court\n\nsaid (per curiam) that the Practice Direction should not be applied blindly butmutatis\n\nmutandisthe facts of each situation.37. From my understanding of all the Malaysian cases referred to\n\nearlier, I do not form the view that non-compliance with para 5 of the Practice Direction\n\nis fatal and would automatically render service thereafter by way of substituted service\n\nnull and void; the Practice Direction is not law but merely a direction for administrative\n\npurpose. Incomplete compliance with para 5 of the Practice Direction would only amount to\n\nan irregularity under O 2 r 1(1) of the High Court Rules and under O 2 r 1(3), does not\n\nwarrant the setting aside of service of the writ; those provisions are inpari materiawith O 2 rr 1(1) and 1(3) of our Rules. I should add that in our case, where Singapore\n\nplaintiffs are dependant on service being effected by the Malaysian judicial authorities,\n\nit would be unduly harsh to penalise the plaintiffs and or their solicitors for the\n\nacts/omissions of the process server. The plaintiffs/their solicitors were in no position\n\nto dictate how or where service on the second defendant should be effected, once the\n\nprocess of service had begun. The suggestion made in the plaintiffs' solicitors' letter\n\ndated 11 January 2001 (for service to be attempted at the second defendant's office) may\n\nor may not be taken up by the process server. At this juncture, it would be useful to\n\nquote from a passage from the judgment inRe Yeap Chee Fun(at p 516) where the\n\ncourt said:Secondly, it was said that the judgment creditor has failed to comply\n\n  with Practice Note No. 1 of 1968……It is intended to make sure that a defendant\n\n  really gets to know of a process of the court that is to be served on him. It is aimed at\n\n  preventing a plaintiff from abusing he process of the court for example, by taking a\n\n  default judgment (later) when in fact the defendant really does not know of the\n\n  proceedings against him…38. Here, it cannot be disputed that the second defendant was fully\n\naware,even before substituted service was effected, that a writ had been issued\n\nagainst him by the plaintiffs, because of his letter dated 17 July 2000 (see para 39\n\nbelow). Consequently, there is no question of his having suffered prejudice as a result of\n\nnot knowing of the advertisements. In this regard, I quote the following extract from the\n\njudgment inKaren Ahmad v Standard Chartered(para 35supra):(2) the intention which underlies all procedure with regard to\n\n  substituted service is that the defendant will probably get to hear of the proceedings. If\n\n  this purpose is achieved, the question as to whether the application for substituted\n\n  service was in order or otherwise is no longer relevant…..39. On the related issue of prior appointment before service, I shall\n\nfirst set out the contents of the second defendant's letter dated 17 July 2000 (marked\n\nwithout prejudice) to the plaintiffs' solicitors, it states:Dear Sirs,In the High Court of the Republic of Singapore 152/2000/XBanque National De Paris vs1. Polynesia Timber Services Pte Ltd2. Philip Ling Lee KingI refer to the above.I understand that you have on behalf of Banque National de Paris filed\n\n  the above Writ of Summons against me in the above Court.Kindly be informed that I am residing in the above address. As such, if\n\n  you wish to serve the writ on me, I request that you fix an appointment through my\n\n  secretary, (Tel. No.03-77278168) to serve the writ on me at my residence.For the avoidance of any doubt, this letter shall not be treated as an\n\n  admission of your client's claim or a waiver of any of my legal rights.Kindly take note.I have several pertinent observations to make on the above letter.\n\nFirst, as the attempts at personal service of notice of the writ on him were only made\n\nfive (5) months later in December 2000, the second defendant's knowledge of the writ could\n\nonly have come from the staff of the company, when the writ was served on its registered\n\noffice on 28 April 2000. He would also have been party to the decision by the company not\n\nto enter an appearance to the writ thereby entitling the plaintiffs to enter default\n\njudgment by 4 July 2000. I say this because a search from the Registry of Companies on the\n\ncompany (exhibited to Jeremiah's third affidavit asHJ-4) revealed that the second\n\ndefendant was/is a majority shareholder of the company holding 599,999 shares (or 59.99%)\n\nof its issued 1 million shares of $1.00 value per share. I am certain therefore that the\n\nsecond defendant would have been consulted on the company's decision not to resist the\n\nplaintiffs' claim. That can only mean that the company, as the principal debtor, accepted\n\nthat it had no defence to the claim.40. It is also noteworthy from the aforesaid letter that the second\n\ndefendant asked to be served with process at his residence (albeit by prior appointment),\n\nnot at his office, contrary to the stand he took in his affidavit (para 8) that he was\n\nunlikely to be home during office hours. Consequently, there was nothing objectionable\n\nabout Shah's attempts at service at his home. It was only in his telephone conversation\n\nwith the plaintiffs' Danny Chia on 14 February 2001, that the second defendant indicated\n\nhe could also be served at his office, again by prior appointment with his secretary. The\n\nquestion then arises – if prior appointment with his secretary was required for\n\nservice at his residence (as the second defendant would otherwise be at his office during\n\noffice hours), why was there a need for the same requirement if service was going to be\n\neffected at his office at Pan Pacific Asia Bhd? The purpose of the appointment requirement\n\nat both venues could be:(a) to ensure service was successful; or(b) equally, to ensure that service would be unsuccessful as the second\n\ndefendant would absent himself from the appointed venue at the appointed time.It seems to me strange that a defendant, whose liability to the\n\nplaintiffs as guarantor has crystallised because judgment has been entered against the\n\nprincipal debtor, can dictate terms to the plaintiffs on how he wished to be served with\n\ntheir legal process.41. From his third affidavit, it is noted that the plaintiffs/Jeremiah\n\nhad concluded that the second defendant was evading service, based on what they understood\n\nShah was told at the first service attempt. Jeremiah had also deposed that contrary to\n\nwhat the second defendant had stated in his letter dated 17 July 2000, Shah was not\n\ninformed that he could return to the residence by prior appointment to effect service on\n\nthe second defendant. It was not unreasonable under the circumstances, for the\n\nplaintiffs/their solicitors to think the worse of the second defendant – that he was\n\navoiding service.42. I next refer to Safiah's affidavit. I note that although she\n\naffirmed in her para 5(iv) that she understood from Shah he had some documents to pass to\n\nthe second defendant in connection with some Singapore bank loan case, she did not\n\nelaborate further on what she did with that information – whether she conveyed it to\n\nthe second defendant's bodyguard Lau Kueng Chai and or to the second defendant in turn.43. The last significant factor to note is that, in his letter dated 10\n\nApril 2001 to the plaintiffs' solicitors (couched in language which would make any lawyer\n\nproud), the second defendant at no time raised the merits of any defence he may have, to\n\nthe plaintiffs' claim against him. His entire complaint was focussed on the fact he had\n\nbeen embarrassed and he felt that his reputation had been maligned or somehow sullied, by\n\nthe advertisements in the Malaysian dailies which he variously described aswrongful,\n\nimproper, uncalled forandunwarranted.Conclusion44. I had allowed the Appeal because in short, the second defendant had not made out\n\nthe four (4) grounds set out in the application (see para 13supra). As the main\n\nfocus of his grievances appeared to be the issue of improper service, I directed the\n\nplaintiffs to re-serve the writ within jurisdiction on the second defendant, without\n\nprejudice to his rights to take fresh steps to set aside the writ. Indeed, I went further\n\nand ordered the plaintiffs to stay execution proceedings on their default judgment against\n\nhim. Instead of availing himself of the orders I had granted, the second defendant chose\n\nto appeal against my decision.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
