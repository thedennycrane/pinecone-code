        "The Background": "2. On 20 February 1999 a fire razed two shophouses known as 23 and 25\n\nSenang Crescent (\"No. 23\" and \"No. 25\" respectively). The first\n\nplaintiffs are the owners of No. 23 and the second plaintiff was the tenant of the second\n\nstorey of that shophouse. The first defendants are the owners of No. 25. The second\n\ndefendants were the tenants of the second storey of No. 25, and the third defendants were\n\nthe tenants of the first storey of No. 25. The plaintiffs sued all three defendants for\n\ndamage arising from the fire on the ground that the fire started at No. 25 and was the\n\nresult of the negligence of the defendants. They also sued alternatively under the rule inRylands v Fletcher, and recitedres ipsa loquiturfor good measure. No claim\n\nwas made in the tort of nuisance. The first and second defendants each filed a\n\ncounter-claim on the ground that the fire started at No. 23. However, in the midst of the\n\nplaintiffs’ case at trial Mr. Cheong and Mr. Anparasan, counsel for the first and\n\nsecond defendants respectively, were granted leave to discontinue the counterclaims.3. The main issue of fact concerned the origin and cause of the fire.\n\nWhere the cause of action is founded on negligence, the origin of fire need not\n\nnecessarily be at the defendants’ premises. But, in this case the plaintiffs\n\nspecifically alleged that the point of origin and the negligent act (cause of the fire)\n\noccurred at the premises occupied by the third defendants, namely the first storey of No.\n\n25. The plaintiffs’ case was that the fire originated beneath a woodpile in the front\n\nyard of No. 25. They alleged that the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit.\n\nTheir case was that the fuses in the premises had been tampered and up-rated.\n\nConsequently, the fuses failed to break the current when the short circuit occurred. The\n\nshort circuit enabled sustained arcs (electrical sparks) to result and that ignited the\n\nfire which subsequently spread to the plaintiffs’ premises next door.4. At the close of the plaintiffs’ case counsel for the first and\n\nsecond defendants submitted that there was no case for these defendants to meet. After\n\nhearing submissions, I accepted the demurrer and dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim\n\nagainst the first and second defendants and the trial continued against the third\n\ndefendants.5. The plaintiffs’ claim against the third defendants was based on\n\nnegligence. Their case was that the fire started at the first storey of No. 25, which were\n\nthe premises occupied by the third defendants, and that the fire was caused by a sustained\n\nelectrical arc. Their case was that the third defendants were negligent in not maintaining\n\ntheir electric cables in good condition, and more importantly, failing to maintain a\n\nproper fuse box or circuit breaker. The plaintiffs called three experts. The first was Lt.\n\nRashid from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (\"SCDF\"). He was the head of a\n\nteam of three officers assigned to investigate this particular fire. The second was Dr\n\nJimmy Chen Wie Ying, an electrical engineer, and the third was Mr. Tan Jin Thong, a\n\nretired Director of the Singapore Fire Services and Deputy Commissioner of the Singapore\n\nCivil Defence Force.",
        "Lt. Rashid’s Report": "6. Lt. Rashid has about 17 years experience in the Fire Fighting\n\nService. He was the head of a team of three officers who investigated this fire. A written\n\nreport was subsequently made by the team and Lt. Rashid’s evidence in court relied\n\nlargely on that report. Recounting his investigation, Lt. Rashid said that when he arrived\n\nat the scene of the fire, the firemen were attacking the fire at No. 25 because the fire\n\nappeared most flagrant there and was spreading to No. 23 because of a north-westerly wind.\n\nHe was also told by the police officers at the scene that a passer-by on a motor-cycle saw\n\nthe flames and had gone into the premises of No. 25 where he reportedly told the police he\n\nsaw sparks coming from underneath some timber.7. He examined the fire damage and noted that No. 25 was more\n\nextensively damaged. It is not disputed that the whole of the first and second storey of\n\nNo. 25 were razed. No. 23, however, suffered extensive damage to its second storey, but\n\nits first storey was almost unscathed in comparison. Little, if any, damage by fire was\n\nsuffered by either No. 21 or No. 27, the two shophouses which sandwich No. 23 and No. 25.8. Lt. Rashid interviewed a Bangladeshi worker employed by the third\n\ndefendants. He was the only person in the third defendants’ premises at the time.\n\nThere was little dispute that the third defendants’ premises had been closed for the\n\nChinese New Year holidays from 12 February 1999 and was to re-open on 22 February 1999.\n\nThe Bangladeshi worker told Lt. Rashid that when he awoke in the middle of the night to go\n\nto the toilet he did not notice anything unusual. He woke up a second time when he felt\n\nvery warm. He went to the front windows where he noticed a great deal of heat and smoke\n\ncoming from the front yard so he ran away from the rear of the premises. Although this\n\ninterview was recorded immediately after the fire, the witness’s name and particulars\n\nwere not recorded and he had since returned to Bangladesh. A woman who lived nearby was\n\nalso interviewed but her evidence was of not much assistance in determining the origin or\n\ncause of the fire. The initial firefighters reported that they saw some electrical\n\nsparkings at the front yard of No. 25. They noted that there was a breeze blowing in the\n\nnorth-westerly direction, and the fire was spreading \"laterally and towards the\n\nrear\", that is, the fire was spreading from No. 25 towards No. 23. The\n\nplaintiffs’ two material witnesses were Mr. Udom Kasemkrai and his friend Mr. Soo\n\nChee Meng. Mr. Kasemkrai was a partner of the second plaintiffs. They carry on the\n\nbusiness of manufacturing mannequins. On 19 February 1999 Mr. Kasemkrai and Mr. Soo were\n\nworking till close to midnight rushing to complete a consignment of mannequins. Mr.\n\nKasemkrai testified that the lights in his room went out suddenly about 3.15 in the\n\nmorning of 20 February. He saw smoke coming from No. 25. When he realised that there was a\n\nfire he called Mr. Soo and then ran out of the building. He testified that he did not see\n\nany fire on the premises of No. 23 but there was fire in the front compound of No. 25. Mr.\n\nSoo gave a very similar account except that he ran back once to No. 23 to search for his\n\npassport. Mr. Kasemkrai, speaking through a Mandarin interpreter, was a difficult witness\n\nin that he was rather hard of hearing and did not come across as someone with a clear and\n\norganised mind, but I have no reason to think that he was being untruthful. Mr. Soo was\n\nquite the opposite. I found him to be generally dependable, and of all the witnesses of\n\nfact, he was the most reliable. I have little hesitation in accepting his account. On the\n\nevidence as I had just described, I am of the view that the fire probably started in the\n\nfront yard of No. 25. I note the evidence of the experts Mr. Dillon and Dr. Mullen in\n\nrespect of the general theory that the fire seemed greater at No. 25 than at No. 23\n\nbecause the fire burned through the front roofing of No. 23 and thus the fire was able to\n\nescape upwards, thereby sparing the internal ground floor from extensive damage; whereas\n\nthe tougher roofing material on the front yard of No. 25 trapped the fire and heat forcing\n\nthe fire to spread inwards resulting in severe damage to the internal ground floor of No.\n\n25. I also note their theory that the fire could have started from the front yard of No.\n\n23 and the flames leapt over the central fence dividing the two premises, into No. 25 and\n\nbecause of the heavy fireload, the flammable materials, and the architectural design, the\n\nfire at No. 25 consequently became larger than that at No. 23. I will not dismiss these\n\ntheories as impossible, but on all accounts, I find that it was more probable that the\n\nfire started at the front yard of No. 25.",
        "The Opposing Theories - The Plaintiffs’ Case": "9. That, however, was only half the story. The next crucial question\n\nwas, what caused the fire? Mr. Gn, counsel for the plaintiffs, advanced a theory of the\n\ncause of the fire. It was based on the postulations of Dr. Chen. Counsel sought support in\n\nthe evidence of Mr. Tan and Lt. Rashid. Dr. Chen was appointed Professor of Electrical\n\nEngineering in the University of Singapore in 1969. He has an impressive rsum which\n\nincludes membership in the Standing Committee of the Fire Safety Bureau. He was a\n\ncommissioner in the Commission of Inquiry into the Robinson’s fire in 1973, and\n\nChairman of the Fire Safety Appeals Advisory Board, among other appointments. Dr. Chen was\n\nof the view that the fire started about 3 am or slightly later and was caused by a short\n\ncircuit at the supply wiring to the machines located in the front yard of No. 25. He said\n\nthat the ignition was caused by electrical arcing (sparks) in the course of the short\n\ncircuit. The problem was compounded because the fuses that were supposed to cut off any\n\nover current did not work because the fuses were incorrect ones. He said that the fuses\n\nconsisted of 3 strands of copper wires instead of smaller more sensitive wires. The\n\nincorrect fuses, according to Dr. Chen allowed the short circuit to persist. Dr. Chen\n\nstated that a \"short circuit occurred at these wirings because the wirings had not\n\nbeen maintained; and most probably it had been over-loaded. Over time, the insulation on\n\nthe copper deteriorated then a short-circuit occurs\".10. The plaintiffs also called Mr. Tan, an impressively credentialled\n\nretired Director of Fire Service and former Deputy Commissioner of the Singapore Civil\n\nDefence Force. Unfortunately, Mr. Tan laboured under the disadvantage of being briefed\n\nabout a year after the fire and therefore had to work principally from documents,\n\nphotographs and instructions from the plaintiffs and their solicitors. He did, however,\n\nvisit the fire site to familiarize himself with the layout and design of the buildings,\n\nwhich had been restored in the meantime. Mr. Tan’s contribution to the\n\nplaintiffs’ cause was his agreement with Lt. Rashid that the point of origin of the\n\nfire was a wood pile in the front yard of No. 25. Lt. Rashid had based his conclusion on\n\nwhat he perceived as a \"V\" shaped burn pattern near the wood pile. He testified\n\nthat he saw this pattern when he inspected the site. Mr. Tan agreed with Lt. Rashid’s\n\nconclusion by looking at the photographs. He was of the view that the wood pile had\n\nsustained \"severe deep charring and that the burning was from a very low level\".\n\nHe also saw some burnt out electrical wirings below the stack of timber. He said that the\n\ntimber were stacked closed and would not burn easily \"especially from the bottom of\n\nthe stack\". He was of the view that burnt wiring recovered from under the wood pile\n\nwas probably the point of ignition. He said that the fire was probably smoldering and\n\nburning for about 30 to 45 minutes before flaring. That also explained why a hole had been\n\nburnt through the fence near that point.",
        "The Third Defendants’ Case": "11. The third defendants called Mr. Barry Dillon as their expert. Mr.\n\nDillon has an equally impressive rsum. He has a specialist expertise in metallurgy but\n\nhad also investigated well over 900 fires. He does not disagree with Dr. Chen’s views\n\nthat untrunked wiring may lead to a short-circuit, but he disagrees with the inference\n\nthat if the wires were trunked no short-circuit can take place. He also pointed out that\n\nsome of the wires found on the premises of No. 23 were also not trunked. Mr. Dillon was\n\nhighly critical of Mr. Tan and Lt. Rashid’s theory that the fire started at the wood\n\npile. He testified that he \"could not understand how Lt. Rashid and [Mr.] Tan can say\n\nthat the fire came from underneath. The steel frame on which the wood was stacked, it had\n\ndistorted and toppled forward. No longer evidence of wood on the top two shelves. The wood\n\nburn. Why not argue that the fire started from there? Mistake was assuming that the woods\n\nwere nicely stacked with pieces close together. If that was the case, it would be true\n\nthat the wood would burn more slowly. But that’s not the case from photos 10 and 11.\n\nThe timber had fallen. When it does, it is random and burns more quickly because of more\n\nsurface area.\"(sic).12. The position taken by Mr. Dillon, and to a large extent by Dr. Eric\n\nMullen, (originally called as an expert witness by the first defendants) was that the fire\n\nwas far too extensive for any evidence as to its origin to be ascertained. Dr. Mullen took\n\nthe position slightly further and postulated that the fire could even have started in the\n\nupper floor of No. 23 (the second plaintiffs’ premises), or on the ground floor of\n\nNo. 23 near the wall adjoining the front yards. Dr. Mullen is extremely well qualified\n\nand, like Mr. Dillon, has extensive experience as a fire investigator. He too had\n\ninvestigated over 900 fires with the firm of Dr. JH Burgoynes & Partners. Dr. Mullen\n\nis of the view that there is \"virtually zero chance\" of a short circuit causing\n\nthe fire in this case because a short circuit would have generated such a high current\n\nthat even the alleged incorrect fuses used here would have blown, thereby cutting off the\n\ncurrent flow. He also noted that no one witness, including Dr. Chen, had offered any\n\nreason why a short circuit could have arisen. Dr. Mullen was of the opinion that the\n\nplaintiffs’ theory that a short circuit occurred on a straight run cable is\n\nimpossible to sustain. The reason, he said, is that the wires do not touch, which is what\n\nhappens when a short circuit occurs. Furthermore, he explained that the arcing (electrical\n\ncurrents) can occur when the melted insulation for the wires melt and become conductors of\n\ncurrent. However, such arcing occurs after a fire has broken out and not before. Thus, he\n\nsaid, the cause of the fire here could not have been due to arcing. He testified that that\n\nexplains why the firemen saw sparks at the front yard of No. 25 when they were putting out\n\nthe fire. Dr. Mullen and Mr. Dillon were of the view that Lt. Rashid had placed too much\n\nemphasis on arcing, reports of sparkings, and melted wires. Both these experts were of the\n\nview that the sparkings were merely evidence of a serious fire attack and not the cause of\n\nthe fire. Mr. Dillon spent some time and effort explaining the greenish tone found on the\n\nwires in the fuses. Dr. Chen had suggested that this colour was caused by the heat of the\n\ncurrent. In this regard Mr. Dillon’s explanation that the green tones were caused by\n\nrain and water from the firefighters is probably more accurate. However, contrary to Mr.\n\nTeo’s fervent belief, this point is not of great significance. Mr. Teo thought that\n\nit was the centrepiece of Dr. Chen’s theory. It is not.",
        "Findings": "13. It is truly a difficult task to assess the opinions of witnesses\n\nwho are called precisely because the subject matter required specialist knowledge when the\n\njudge himself stands alone least qualified. I had dealt with the simpler of the findings\n\nthat I needed to make, namely, where did the fire originate? I accept that in a massive\n\nfire as that experienced by the two adjoining premises here, relevant evidence of the\n\ncause may have been consumed and obliterated by the fire itself. The evidence here amply\n\nsuggests that the wires were so badly burned that it was impossible to trace the\n\nconnections or yield any useful information. However, sufficient clues remain. In this\n\nregard, I accept the general theories of electrical conduct that Dr. Chen espoused. The\n\nfire, in my view, did not destroy all the evidence. I accept Mr. Gn’s submission that\n\nthe electrical sparkings seen by the witnesses indicate that there was still electricity\n\nflowing in the cables even when the fire was in full flame; otherwise no electrical sparks\n\ncould have been created. This was supported by the evidence that the switches at the\n\nisolators were left in an \"on\" position when the shop closed for the holidays.\n\nDr. Mullen and Mr. Dillon had steadfastly maintained that in the circumstances of the\n\ncase, arcing from a short circuit could not have happened. Dr. Mullen stated that the\n\nwires in question were \"straight run\" wires which could not have created an arc\n\nor short circuit. Furthermore, even if a short circuit had occurred the fuses would have\n\ntripped and the electricity supply cut off. This was so, he said, even accepting that the\n\nfuses were not of the correct quality. In my view, that conclusion can only be maintained\n\non the premise that the wires were well maintained and not defective. If the insulation\n\ncovering the live and neutral wires were broken the probability of the exposed wires\n\nmaking contact would be very high. The issue is whether there is sufficient evidence to\n\nconclude or infer that there was probably some defective cables.14. Dr. Chen was of the view that there was no evidence that there was\n\n\"an initiating fire to set the insulation smoking below the pile of wood\". He\n\nbelieved, therefore, that the cause was arcing in the wires. He disagreed with Dr.\n\nMullen’s theory of a \"dead short circuit\" which would send the current\n\nbeyond 200 amperes and blowing the fuses. In short, he drew the inference, from the\n\ncircumstances and the available clues, that the fire could only have been caused by an\n\nelectrical short circuit. In the absence of the probability of any other possible cause,\n\nhis inference, in my view, is reasonably probable.15. There is no doubt that Dr. Mullen and Mr. Dillon were exacting a\n\nhigh standard on themselves as experts in their field, but they were unable to accept Dr.\n\nChen’s opinion because they were searching for irrefutable hard evidence. The court,\n\nhowever, is not required to seek such evidence in evaluating the balance of probabilities.\n\nI am satisfied that Dr. Chen had been no less exacting on himself than Dr. Mullen or Mr.\n\nDillon but nonetheless, had established a reasonably probable theory, supported by\n\nevidence, of how the fire occurred. After taking into accounts of Dr. Mullen and Mr.\n\nDillon, I am satisfied that on a balance of probabilities the fire occurred as a result of\n\nan electrical short circuit in the premises of No. 25. The \"up-rated\" fuses were\n\nnot able to break the circuit and thereby electrical current continued to flow, resulting\n\nin the ignition of the fire. Mr. Dillon agreed that the up-rated fuses permitted a greater\n\ncurrent flow than that prescribed but he disagreed that that resulted in the ignition of\n\nthe fire. Dr. Mullen suggested that there could have been some circuit breakers in the\n\npremises but these, he said, could have been destroyed in the fire because modern circuit\n\nbreakers are made of less durable materials. I think that it is fair to say that this is\n\nspeculative contemplation because, apart from the absence of any trace of a circuit\n\nbreaker or any component part in the burned shophouse, there were no evidence from the\n\nthird defendants that they had any circuit breakers other than the three fuses in\n\nquestion. The case against the third defendants was apparent to them from the start and\n\nthe presence of circuit breakers would feature as a key component of their defence; but no\n\nevidence was adduced that there were any and I think that it is reasonable to conclude\n\nthat there were none in the old shophouse. I should add that Dr. Mullen did express the\n\nview that he could not imagine that the shophouse was served by only three fuses, but that\n\nseems to be the evidence. Furthermore, there was evidence of a circuit breaker in No. 23;\n\nnone in respect of No. 25. I do not think that it is right to assume that if there was a\n\ncircuit breaker in No. 23 it must follow that there was one in No. 25. That was not Mr.\n\nTeo’s point in any event. The circuit breakers are modern devices and must be\n\ninstalled specifically. There was no evidence of such installation in No. 25 a building of\n\nat least 30 years in age.16. I think that it is not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that\n\nthe third defendants were the ones who altered the fuses. The fuses were in premises they\n\noccupy and use. The responsibility rests with them to ensure that the electrical wires are\n\nwell insulated and the proper fuses or circuit breakers were in place. It was not disputed\n\nthat the fuses were not in conformity with the recommended 30 amperes specification. In\n\nthe circumstances, the third defendants, in failing on these counts, were negligent and\n\nthe plaintiffs’ claim against them in negligence must succeed.",
        "Res Ipsa Loquitur": "17. I had dealt with the plaintiffs plea ofres ipsa loquiturin\n\nmy grounds of decision in respect of the case concerning the first and second defendants,\n\nbut it is necessary to repeat my views in this judgment as the plaintiffs had also raised\n\nthis plea against the third defendants.Res ipsa loquituris only an evidentiary\n\ndoctrine and does not apply in this case because the plaintiffs had specifically sought to\n\nshow that the cause of the fire was an electrical ignition. That being the case, it will\n\nnot assist them to say that if they fail, the defendants must then explain how the fire\n\noccurred. This is not how the doctrine was intended to be used. The burden of proof lies\n\nwith he who asserts. Where a plaintiff asserts negligence he must prove negligence. If he\n\nis unable to assert any cause, then he may, if the circumstances permit, cryres ipsa\n\nloquiturand shift the burden of proof to the defendant to establish how the facts\n\ncomplained of occurred. The overall burden (the legal burden) of proving the\n\nplaintiffs’ case remains with the plaintiff. Where, as in this case, the plaintiff\n\nmakes a specific allegation of negligence he cannot rely on the rule to establish a\n\npreliminary case of negligence. He must proceed to prove forthwith that which he has\n\nasserted to be the defendant’s negligence, which in this instance, the plaintiffs had\n\naccomplished.18. I will hear parties on the question of costs at a later date.Choo Han TeckJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
