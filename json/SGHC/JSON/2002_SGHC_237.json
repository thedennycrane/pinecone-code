        "Findings of fact": "9\n\n        The main dispute of fact is whether the\n\nDefendants had agreed to grant an extension of time until end October 2001 for the\n\ncompletion. The persons who represented the parties throughout are the Plaintiffs’\n\ndirector Edmund Lim Cheng Kiat (\"Lim\") and the Defendants’ director, Low\n\nHang Teow (\"Low\"). There is also a third party and a most important actor in\n\nthis little drama. He is John Tan (\"Tan\") who appears to be a freelance agent\n\nand wheeler-dealerextraordinaire. He was the person who brought together the\n\nparties on the sale and purchase and had also procured for both sides other unrelated\n\nfinancing opportunities. Unfortunately neither side saw fit to call him as a witness in\n\nthis matter although he would have been able to throw much light on the case as he was the\n\nintermediary between the parties in several crucial transactions. He is the only one who\n\ncan support or contradict the evidence of the protagonists in those matters.10\n\n        It is the common position of the parties that\n\nthe entire transaction was a sale and leaseback agreement. At the time the Plaintiffs were\n\nexperiencing a severe cashflow problem and facing foreclosure by the mortgagee-bank as\n\nthey had been unable to satisfactorily service their bank facilities. It was in these\n\ncircumstances that Tan came into the picture and he was able to procure some bank\n\nfinancing for the Plaintiffs for a fee. But this was insufficient to tide the Plaintiffs\n\nover their difficult period and Tan suggested to Lim to sell the Property. Tan said that\n\nhe had buyers who were interested to make such investments. Lim said that he would be\n\nprepared to do it provided the Defendants could lease the Property back as he wished to\n\ncontinue with the business and it was expensive to relocate to another location. In the\n\nnegotiations leading up to the sale, the parties agreed that after the purchase the\n\nProperty would be leased back to the Plaintiffs at a monthly rent of $15,000, a sum which\n\nthe Defendants felt would give a satisfactory return on their investment.11\n\n        However there was just one problem: JTC did not\n\npermit their factory premises to be rented out. Lim explained that JTC required the lessor\n\nto conduct operations on the leased premises. However this problem did not seem to be\n\ninsurmountable as far as the parties were concerned. Lim said this in cross-examination:JTC does not allow a person to\n\n    buy a JTC factory to merely rent out. To overcome this, we came up with this joint\n\n    arrangement, whereby Defendant would purchase the property, machine remained there, we\n\n    would transfer our technical know how to Defendant.Lim explained that the Plaintiffs\n\nwould in their application to JTC put up a bogus proposal which stated that the Plaintiffs\n\nand Defendants were entering into a joint venture and for that purpose required the\n\ntransfer of the lease to the Defendants. Lim said that:… the joint arrangement was\n\n    to fulfill JTC's requirements. I had earlier mentioned that JTC did not allow a purchaser\n\n    to lease the property. That's why there is no $15,000 rental in [the application]\n\n    document.Lim admitted quite frankly that\n\nthey were trying to \"hoodwink\" JTC in order to get their approval for the sale.\n\nIt was in this context that the scheme fell flat arising from the delay in the CSC.12\n\n        According to Lim, after the Defendants’\n\nsolicitors served the 21-day notice to complete on 7 August, he telephoned Low about the\n\ndelay in obtaining the CSC. Low told him to \"carry on\" with the application for\n\nit. Then on 10 August, Tan contacted Lim to say that Low would be prepared to extend the\n\ncompletion on condition that the Defendants agreed to pay compensation of $15,000 per\n\nmonth until completion. This figure corresponds to the agreed rental after completion. Lim\n\nagreed. Tan said that the $15,000 advance paid in June for the August 2001 rent would be\n\nutilised towards the compensation for the month of August, and the next payment due from\n\nthe Plaintiffs would be in September 2001. To confirm this, the Plaintiffs sent a letter\n\ndated 10 August to the Defendants which states as follows:As regards the above matter, we\n\n    sincerely apologize for the delay in completion.At present, the CSC is in\n\n    process. The schedule of completing the whole process of CSC will be completed end of\n\n    October. (Attached with letter from our architect).As to show we are sincerely to\n\n    complete the sale, we will commence to pay our rent with effect from 1stAugust\n\n    2001 till the completion.13\n\n        Lim said that the Plaintiffs made two further\n\npayments of $15,000 on 5 September and 5 October to the Defendants pursuant to this\n\nagreement to extend the completion date. The payment on 5 September was made by way of a\n\ncash cheque which the Plaintiffs handed to Tan. The Plaintiffs produced a copy of that\n\ncheque which appears to show on the reverse that it was encashed on 6 September and\n\nLow’s signature is there. As for the payment of 5 October, Lim said that he made out\n\na cheque and met Low at the Pasir Panjang Hawker Centre to hand it over. However Low told\n\nhim to hand it to Tan. This was done by Jacky Tan (\"Jacky\"), the\n\nPlaintiff’s other director, on 9 October at a coffee shop in Ang Mo Kio. However Tan\n\ninformed Jacky that Low wanted it in cash. Jacky telephoned Lim and told him of this. Lim\n\ntelephoned Tan and arranged to hand over the cash to him the following day. On 10 October\n\nJacky handed $15,000 in cash to Tan at a coffee shop in Sembawang. Lim said that Low\n\nsubsequently confirmed by telephone that Tan had handed this sum to him.14\n\n        I now turn to Low’s version. From the\n\nbeginning until August 2001, it adheres to Lim’s version very closely except for one\n\ncrucial fact. That is the price. Although the Option states that the price is $1.7\n\nmillion, Low maintained that it was actually $1.8 million and he had to pay the Plaintiffs\n\n$100,000 in cash. This came about at the negotiation stage when the Plaintiffs, through\n\nTan, had asked for an additional $100,000 to be paid \"under the table\" to enable\n\nthem to \"roll\" their business. Presumably this meant that the Plaintiffs did not\n\nwish to reflect this sum in the Option and they could have access to this sum for their\n\nbusiness instead of it being paid to the bank to reduce the loan.15\n\n        Low said that the \"under the table\"\n\n$100,000 was not recorded in any document. Neither did the parties talk about when it\n\nshould be paid. However upon the grant of in-principle approval by JTC in June 2001, Tan\n\ninformed him that the Plaintiffs wanted to be paid the $100,000. Low was reluctant to do\n\nthis as there was no assurance that the sale and purchase would be completed. Tan then\n\ntold him that the Plaintiffs were prepared to sign the Tenancy Agreement and pay him a\n\ndeposit of two months’ rent plus one month’s rent in advance. Low said that it\n\nwas then that he agreed to pay the $100,000 to the Plaintiffs, as he reckoned that his\n\nexposure would be reduced by the $45,000 he would receive from them in the form of three\n\nmonths’ rent. Low gave Tan a cheque for $70,000. He said that the balance $30,000 was\n\nto come from Tan, who owed this sum to him. Low claimed that Tan had paid the $100,000 to\n\nthe Plaintiffs although he admitted that he was not present when this was done. Indeed Low\n\nsaid that all communications with the Plaintiffs in respect of this payment of $100,000\n\nwas done through Tan. He said that he knew that the Plaintiffs had received the money\n\nbecause Tan had told him not to cash the two cheques for $45,000 until after Tan had\n\nhanded the $100,000 to the Plaintiffs who could then place funds in their account for the\n\n$45,000 to be encashed.16\n\n        Low said that at no time prior to 15 August did\n\nLim propose to him to extend the completion to end October. Low pointed out that there was\n\nno need for a side agreement on compensation for late completion as there already was such\n\na provision in the Law Society Conditions that would have yielded a similar amount.17\n\n        Low deposed that after the 21-day period of the\n\nnotice to complete given by his solicitors on 7 August, he told Tan that he was no longer\n\ninterested in purchasing the Property. He requested for the return of the $100,000.\n\nAlthough Tan tried to persuade him to go through with it, he was not moved. Tan initially\n\nsaid the $100,000 would be paid in two instalments. However he later said that the\n\nPlaintiffs had changed their minds and Tan handed him three personal cheques drawn by Lim.\n\nLow said that none of these cheques were presented by the Defendants because the\n\nPlaintiffs eventually made the refunds in cash. Two of the cheques, which were for $22,000\n\nand $23,000, were subsequently returned and Low exhibited the third one, a cash cheque for\n\nthe sum of $30,000 and drawn on Lim’s personal account. However at the reverse of the\n\ncheque are the words in Lim’s handwriting: \"RETURN FOR PERSONAL LOAN\". Lim\n\nexplained that he had given this cheque to Tan as repayment for a personal loan he had\n\ntaken from him.18\n\n        Low said that eventually the Plaintiffs\n\nrefunded to him two sums, all in cash, totalling $40,000. The first refund was made on 3\n\nSeptember when Jacky gave him $25,000 in Tan’s presence. The second was a few days\n\nafter 5 October, when Lim gave him $15,000.19\n\n        I must say that Low’s version is as full\n\nof holes as Lim’s version is corroborated and consistent. Firstly, the story of the\n\n$100,000 \"under the table\" payment is rather far fetched if one were to consider\n\nwhy the Plaintiffs would agree to it without any documentation. Once the Option is\n\nexercised, the Defendants would have a specifically enforceable contract to purchase the\n\nProperty for $1.7 million (assuming no complications). In going about it in this manner\n\nthe Plaintiffs would be taking the high risk that the Defendants would renege on the\n\npromise to pay the $100,000.20\n\n        Secondly, Low seemed to have a high degree of\n\ntrust in Tan when he handed him the $70,000 to pass to the Plaintiffs. Not only did he not\n\nrequire a written acknowledgement of receipt from the Plaintiffs, he did not even get an\n\noral acknowledgement. This must be seen in the light of the fact that it was the\n\nDefendants’ case that Tan was the Plaintiffs’ property agent.21\n\n        Thirdly, Low had no explanation as to why the\n\nPlaintiffs’ solicitors letter of 15 August, which alleged that Low had agreed to\n\nextend completion to end October, was not rebutted within a reasonable time if he had not\n\nmade such a concession.22\n\n        Fourthly, Low’s story about Lim’s\n\ncheque is rather incredible. Why Lim would give the Defendants his personal cheque for\n\n$30,000 to reduce a debt owed by the Plaintiffs is rather puzzling. It would have been a\n\nsimple matter for Lim to pay this sum into the Plaintiffs’ bank so that it can be\n\nreflected as a director’s loan, and have the Plaintiffs give their cheque to the\n\nDefendants. Furthermore, Low had no cogent explanation as to why Lim would have written\n\nthe words \"return for personal loan\" and the only plausible one is that given by\n\nLim, i.e. that it was indeed a repayment of a personal loan from Tan.23\n\n        Fifthly, Low admitted receiving the\n\nPlaintiffs’ cheque dated 5 September 2001 for $15,000. The Plaintiffs had claimed\n\nthat this was compensation for late completion in respect of September. Low said that the\n\ncheque was rejected by the bank when he presented it for payment and so he passed it to\n\nTan. It was accepted that payment had been made on the cheque because there is a\n\n\"PAID\" stamp on its face. On the reverse there are the following machine printed\n\nwords:HOST SUP OVERRIDE BY SA35Drawing agst todays deposit >\n\n                                                   \n\n    10000.00KEN GLASS DESIGN ASSOCIATE PTE\n\n    LTD06/09/20012336X10271032\n\n                                          \n\n    TT26401/320/724 5\n\n                                                               \n\n    SGD $15,00077189Override By SA35Counsel for the Defendants put it\n\nas their case that \"HOST SUP OVERRIDE BY SA35\" meant that the cheque was\n\nrejected due to insufficient funds in the account. However he did not produce any evidence\n\nto support this contention. The cheque in fact appears to be paid in that same transaction\n\nbecause the word \"Paid\" is stamped on the front of the cheque. The words and\n\nsymbols at the reverse could well mean that an override was required by a person of higher\n\nauthority in the bank because the sum in the cash cheque exceeded $10,000. But this is\n\nspeculation. Whatever it is, the Defendants have not given any evidence to support a\n\ncontention that appears to contradict the ordinary meaning of the words on the face of the\n\ncheque.24\n\n        Sixthly, Low’s evidence depends heavily on\n\nTan because Low was not the one who paid the Plaintiffs the $100,000 nor the one who\n\ndirectly communicated with Lim in respect of many crucial aspects of his version of\n\nevents. Even if Low were telling the truth, it would be from his point of view and in\n\nrespect of many of the events he was relying on what Tan had told him. In particular Low\n\nwas relying wholly on Tan for his claim that he had paid the Plaintiffs $100,000\n\n\"under the table\". Therefore his failure to call Tan as a witness to support his\n\nversion of events must affect the credibility of his evidence.25\n\n        Finally those inconsistencies must be\n\ncontrasted with the well corroborated versions of the Plaintiffs’ witnesses which\n\nwere fully supported by documents. In respect of demeanour, I found Lim to be earnest and\n\ntruthful whereas Low was evasive and bare with the details.26\n\n        I therefore made the finding that Low was not\n\ntelling the truth and accepted Lim’s version of events. Specifically I found that the\n\nDefendants had agreed to extend the time for completion to end October 2001. Therefore\n\nthey were in breach of the Agreement in refusing to complete on 31 October upon the\n\nPlaintiff’s request. I also found that there was no agreement to pay the $100,000\n\n\"under the table\" and consequently no such payment took place. I further found\n\nthat the Plaintiffs had paid the Defendants $30,000 as two months’ deposit and three\n\nfurther sums of $15,000 each.27\n\n        In their Statement of Claim, the Plaintiffs had\n\nprayed for specific performance of the Agreement. However in the midst of submission on 23\n\nAugust 2002 counsel for the Plaintiffs withdrew this prayer and advised that they would\n\nonly ask for damages in law and under the Law Society Conditions.28\n\n        I disallowed the recovery. The Agreement was\n\nconditional upon the approval of JTC. Such approval was obtained through a deceptive\n\napplication by the Plaintiffs with the concurrence and co-operation of the Defendants. On\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ case, had the fact that the transaction was in reality a sale and\n\nleaseback arrangement been revealed to JTC, such approval would not have been given. This\n\nwould have rendered the Agreement null and void according to its terms.29\n\n        InBrown, Jenkinson & Co Ltd v Percy\n\nDalton (London) Ltd[1957] 2 All ER 844, the plaintiffs sought to enforce an indemnity\n\ngiven by the defendants in consideration of the issue of a clean bill of lading by the\n\ncarrier when it was not justified to do so. The headnote gives the following facts:The plaintiffs as agents for\n\n    shipowners agreed with the defendants for the shipment of one hundred barrels of\n\n    concentrated orange juice f.o.b. London to Hamburg, freight to be paid by the defendants.\n\n    The defendants stipulated that they should have clean on board bills of lading. The\n\n    barrels were in fact old and leaking, as the defendants knew and as the plaintiffs learnt\n\n    when the barrels were brought to the dock. At the request of the defendants the plaintiffs\n\n    agreed to issue and did issue bills of lading describing the goods as in \"apparent\n\n    good order and condition\", the defendants agreeing to indemnify the shipowners\n\n    against all losses or damage arising from the issue of clean bills of lading. Owing to the\n\n    condition of the barrels a considerable quantity of the orange juice leaked away before\n\n    they were delivered to the ultimate purchasers. The shipowners having paid the amount of\n\n    the loss so arising assigned to the plaintiffs their rights under the agreement of\n\n    indemnity. The plaintiffs, when they issued clean bills of lading, knew that bankers would\n\n    not ordinarily advance money against bills of lading unless the bills were clean bills of\n\n    lading, but the plaintiffs had not contemplated that anyone should be defrauded by the\n\n    issue of these bills of lading and did not know what was intended to be done with the\n\n    bills of lading by any purchasers of the goods from the defendants.30\n\n        The clean bill was requested in order to induce\n\nthe bank to advance money on the bill. The English Court of Appeal, by a majority, refused\n\nto enforce the defendants’ promise to indemnify the shipowners on the basis that it\n\narose out of a transaction which contained all the elements of the tort of deceit. Morris\n\nLJ said at p 853:The promise on which the\n\n    plaintiffs rely is, in effect, this: If you will make a false representation which will\n\n    deceive indorsees or bankers, we will indemnify you against any loss that may result to\n\n    you. I cannot think that a court should lend its aid to enforce such a bargain.31\n\n        InSuntoso Jacob v Kong Miao Ming[1986] SLR 59 the plaintiff, an Indonesian, had transferred shares in a ship-owning company to\n\nthe defendant, a Singaporean, to be held on trust by the latter for his benefit. The\n\npurpose of this was to get around the administrative requirement in force at the time that\n\na ship would be considered foreign-owned if the majority of shares in the owner-company\n\nwas not held by Singaporeans. The defendant had signed a blank transfer of the shares he\n\nheld on trust but had refused to deliver the share certificates when requested to do so by\n\nthe plaintiff. The suit was taken out for a declaration that the defendant was not\n\nentitled to the shares and that he held them as trustee for the plaintiff. The Court of\n\nAppeal upheld the decision of Lai Kew Chai J to refuse the plaintiff any remedy as he had\n\npractised a deception on the public administration.32Suntoso’s casewas applied inTan\n\nSoi v Pow Kwee Lan & Ors[1998] 3 SLR 191which concerns a Housing and Development\n\nBoard (\"HDB\") shop. The plaintiff and one Phua had entered into a trust deed in\n\n1976 by which the latter agreed to hold a tenancy for the shop on trust for the former.\n\nAfter Phua died the tenancy was registered in the name of his widow. In 1994, the HDB\n\noffered to sell the premises to the sitting tenant, namely the widow. She subsequently\n\ntransferred this offer to her four children, the second to fifth defendants, who exercised\n\nthe right accordingly and purchased an 82-year lease for the premises. The plaintiff\n\nclaimed that the premises were held on trust for him. The defendants argued,inter alia,\n\nthat the trust deed was unenforceable as it was made for the purpose of deceiving the HDB.\n\nThe court found that the purpose of the trust deed was to facilitate a scheme by which\n\nPhua allowed the plaintiff to take advantage of the benefit of the reduced rental he was\n\noffered by virtue of his status as a resettled tenant and that this offended the policy\n\nbehind the reduced rental. The trust deed was accordingly unenforceable as the plaintiff\n\ndid not come to court with clean hands33\n\n        In the present case the Plaintiffs also did not\n\ncome to the Court with clean hands. That was probably the reason that they had withdrawn\n\ntheir prayer for specific performance and asked only for damages for breach of contract.\n\nBut this prayer has two problems:(i) The first problem is the\n\n    method of assessing the loss. Although the Agreement is for sale and purchase of the\n\n    Property, the parties had intended that it existed alongside the Tenancy Agreement. The\n\n    true intention of the parties was to enter into a sale and leaseback agreement. This would\n\n    not have been permitted by JTC and therefore it would not have been possible for the\n\n    Plaintiffs to secure a corresponding sale and leaseback agreement in relation to which\n\n    their losses, if any, could be assessed.(ii) The second problem is this.\n\n    Equity deems to be done what ought to have been done. Therefore had the parties revealed\n\n    the fact of the sale and leaseback agreement to JTC, as they ought to, approval would not\n\n    have been given and pursuant to the Agreement it becomes null and void.34\n\n        Accordingly, I held that the Defendants were\n\nnot liable for damages.35\n\n        There remained the question of the $153,000\n\nthat the Defendants had paid to the stakeholders pending completion. Ordinarily losses\n\nwould lie where they fall in such situations. However the stakeholders require an order of\n\ncourt to deal with the money in their hands. I was of the view that I have a discretion in\n\nthe matter and proceeded to weigh the relative equities of the parties. In my opinion, the\n\nparties werein pari delictoin this matter and if an order was required, they\n\nshould as far as possible be returned to their original positions, i.e. a reversal of all\n\npayments would be appropriate. Counsel for the parties agreed that, after accounting for\n\nall the payments made by the parties to each other, such reversal would be achieved by an\n\norder to the stakeholders to pay the sum of $58,000 to the Plaintiffs and the balance\n\n$95,000 to the Defendants, and I so ordered.36\n\n        On the question of costs, I was of the view\n\nthat it would be appropriate to make no order as to costs.Sgd:LEE SEIU KINJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERSUPREME COURTCopyright © Government of Singapore."
