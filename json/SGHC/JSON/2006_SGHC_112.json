        "Introduction": "65        As I have already mentioned, it would be eminently appropriate to utilise the two broad headings I have adopted above in analysing as well as evaluating the respective parties’ arguments before arriving at my decision.",
        "Chambers or open court?": "7          Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr M Ravi, argued strenuously that these proceedings ought not to be heard in chambers, but, rather, in open court. The main plank of his argument was that it was in the public interest that such proceedings be heard in open court. He also sought to argue for a moregeneralrule to this effect. I have no hesitation in rejecting this last-mentioned argument. There can be no universal or all-encompassing rule to this effect. The facts and context of each set of proceedings will differ from case to case and the procedure in this regard cannot therefore be writ in stone. Indeed, the presumption in proceedings such as those in the present case is for a hearing in chambers unless special reasons can be shown. 8          Nevertheless, in view of the close linkage between this particular application and the plaintiff’s substantive application (the latter of which is in fact scheduled to be heard in open court), I ruled that there was a sufficient public interest element to justify holding the hearing of these proceedings in open court. But this, as I have mentioned, sets no precedent for the future. Nor, as I have mentioned, is it wise to even attempt to set such a precedent.",
        "The scope of the present application": "9          The present application was, as I have already mentioned, premised on an alleged contravention of r 13. However, when the defendant submitted its skeletal submissions, it referred to a whole host of other alleged incurable non-compliances with the PER in so far as the present proceedings were concerned. In summary, these included the following arguments: (a)        that the plaintiff, in citing the Attorney-General as the defendant, had in fact named the wrong defendant (and citing the Malaysian High Court decisions ofRamely bin Mansor v Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia[2000] 2 MLJ 500andDr Lee Chong Meng v Abdul Rahman bin Hj Abdullah, Returning Officer[2000] 6 MLJ 98); (b)        that there had been a failure on the part of the plaintiff to state (in her affidavit supporting her application under s 90 of the Act) her right to apply within s 93 of the Act – a requirement set out under r 5(1)(a) of the PER; (c)        that there had been a failure on the part of the plaintiff to state (in her affidavit supporting her application under s 90 of the Act) the holding and result of the election – a requirement set out under r 5(1)(b) of the PER; (d)        that there had been a failure on the part of the plaintiff to state (in her affidavit) the grounds upon which she was relying to sustain the relief sought (which grounds are set in ss 90(a) to 90(e) of the Act) – a requirement set out under r 5(1)(b) (and citing the Malaysian High Court decision ofNorbert Choong Kai Chong v Mohamed Idris bin Haji Ibrahim[1980] 1 MLJ 316(“theNorbert Choongcase”)); (e)        that there had been a failure on the part of the plaintiff to state (in her affidavit) the relief sought – a requirement apparently raised by virtue of r 5(4) of the PER. 10        It is immediately apparent that the arguments set out above – in particular the first – are substantive arguments in their own right (this is accentuated by the fact that the relevant case law was also invoked, as noted above). The problem, as I perceived it, was that it would have been unfair to have allowed the defendant to rely upon them in the present proceedings without more. Let me elaborate. 11        In the first instance, the present application was made pursuant to r 13(4) of the PER. It was a specific application focusing on non-compliance with a particular provision requiring that the plaintiff provide security for costs. In order, therefore, for the defendant to rely on theotherarguments just referred to, it was incumbent on it to apply for an amendment of the present application to include these arguments. Counsel for the defendant, Mr Jeffrey Chan Wah Teck, immediately pointed to the potential pitfall in adopting such an approach. There was, he argued, a risk of mixing the applications inasmuch as an application under r 13(4) would (if successful) result in a dismissal of the plaintiff’s substantive application, whereas if the other grounds were successfully established, this would result in the plaintiff’s substantive application being rendered a nullity for non-compliance. 12        I did point out, however, that yet another alternative approach which avoided the pitfall just mentioned would be for the defendant to take out a separate application focusing on the other arguments from non-compliance. Both the present as well as the new application could then be heard together. 13        I also pause to note that Mr Ravi was not averse to having the other grounds being heard by this court as well, provided that he was given a short adjournment. 14        In the event, Mr Chan decided on a third option – which was to proceed with the present application pursuant to r 13(4), leaving argument with regard to the other grounds for another occasion, if necessary. However, he did point out that it was incumbent on him to raise these other grounds in the present proceedings, if for no other reason than to emphasise that the defendant was not, in any way, waiving its rights to raising these grounds in a separate application in the future. 15        I turn now, briefly, to the second reason why it would have been unfair to have allowed the defendant to rely on the other arguments without more. As the present application was made pursuant to r 13(4), it was not surprising that both the plaintiff as well as Mr Ravi expressed surprise on viewing the arguments in the defendant’s skeletal submissions. In the circumstances, they were obviously unprepared to meet these other arguments. One natural solution would have been to have granted them additional time for preparation, provided the potential procedural difficulties could be ironed out. As it turned out (see the preceding paragraph), this course of action is now unnecessary. Suffice it to state that after some discussion, we were back where the original application in fact indicated we should be – focusing on the sole issue centring on the effect of the plaintiff’s non-compliance with r 13. 16        I turn now to the respective arguments for the parties in so far as this particular issue is concerned, commencing with the arguments by counsel for the defendant.",
        "The defendant’s arguments": "",
        "Precedent": "66        It is clear that the relevant case law supports the conclusion that r 13 of the PER ismandatoryand that, therefore, a failure to comply with it will result in the plaintiff’s application being dismissed if the defendant chooses to apply to this effect pursuant to r 13(4). Indeed, a failure to comply with r 13 is precisely what happened in the present proceedings. 67        As already noted above, the leading decision was handed down decades ago in theChong Thain Vuncase ([25]supra). What is of added significance is that that particular decision has more than stood the test of time – right up to the present (see, in particular, theCharlee Sohcase ([33]supra)). The rule relating to the furnishing of security in these decisions was, it should be further noted, identical to our r 13. However, it is essential, in my view, not to adopt an excessively legalistic approach and simply rest my decision on a “peg-hanging basis”. What I mean is this: that while it is extremely common for lawyers to seek and find “comfort” in a precedent (preferably “on all fours” with the case at hand), such an approach that utilises an existing precedent without more as a “peg” to hang one’s decision on, whilst helpful, ought not to be carried to extremes. Such an approach is undoubtedly an integral part of the common law process. But that ought not to be the be all and end all of the matter for, surely, the reasoning and logic of the precedent concerned must matter as well. Indeed, in the worst-case scenario, an existing precedent could in fact embody erroneous principles of law. It is therefore imperative to also examine the reasoning and rationale of the relevant precedents as well as to decide (whenever possible) the case on first principles. This is accordingly what I propose to dovis-à-visr 13. 68        I commence with the finding that the reasoning in theChong Thain Vuncase as well as in theCharlee Sohcase is logical and persuasive (see generally [25]–[34] above). However, I wish to go further. The logical and fair starting point is to examine the very language of r 13 itself, bearing in mind the very important caveat pointed out by Mr Chan above (at [20]–[22]) that I ought to confine myself, as far as is possible, to the language and four corners of the Act and the accompanying PER themselves. 69        Rule 13 has in fact been reproduced in full at [4] above. Of particular importance is para (1) thereof as it is that specific provision which not only sets out the general duty of the plaintiff (or someone on behalf of the plaintiff) to give security but also lays down the timelines concerned.Rule 13(1) reads as follows: At the time of the filing of the applicationunder section 90,or within 3 days afterwards, security for the payment of all costs, charges and expenses that may become payable by the plaintiffshall be givenon behalf of the plaintiff. [emphasis added] The words italicised above are of particular importance. Let me elaborate. 70        One will notice right from the outset at least two important (and related) points with respect to thetimeframeset out under r 13(1). 71        The first is that, on a general level, the timeframe isvery specific. In other words, it is not phrased in general terms. More importantly, there isnoexception incorporated into r 13(1) itself, for example, the provision for an extension of time if the timelines therein are not met. Indeed, the reference in r 13(1) is to two timelines, not just a single timeline. This is a point that has, to the best of my knowledge, not been canvassed in any of the case law. However, it is, as I shall point out in a moment, a significant point that arises on a plain reading of the provision itself – which is, in fact, my second point, to which I now turn. 72        Secondly, and as I have just mentioned, there are in facttwo specific timelines prescribedwithin r 13(1) itself. The first is that security shall be payable “at the time of the filing of the application”. Presumably, this is the most efficient scenario envisaged. It also presupposes that the plaintiff, having taken the time and trouble to file an application under s 90 of the Act, has also taken the time and trouble to acquaint himself or herself withallthe relevant procedure – including the provision of security as required under r 13. I pause here to note that such an application is indeed avery specific and specialisedone. It is specific because it relates to a very special procedure impugning a result in an event that does not take place every other day, to put it mildly. It is also specific because it is not only an attempt by the plaintiff to vindicate his or her rights but is also an attempt (simultaneously)to impugn and presumably take away the rights of another party (here, of the successful candidate who would normally be the defendant to such an application). I shall elaborate more on this point below as well as in the conclusion to this judgment because it goes to the very root of the concept of rights itself – viewed not merely in the abstract but in a very real and practical context. It will suffice for the present to reiterate the fact that, given,inter alia, the very specific and specialised nature of the context and its concomitant proceedings, there is a clear underlying assumption that the plaintiff would indeed be prepared, simultaneously with his or her filing of an application under s 90 of the Act, to furnish the requisite security pursuant to r 13. 73However, and this is wherethe Legislaturehas in factbuilt inavery limited exceptionwhich takes the form ofa second (and alternative) timeline, if the plaintiff doesnotin fact furnish the requisite security pursuant to r 13 at the time of the filing of the application, thenthere is a further grace period of three days to do so. This is embodied in no uncertain terms by the words “orwithin 3 days afterwards” [emphasis added] in r 13(1) itself. This further grace period presumably permits the plaintiff some extra time to garner the necessary funds. However, given the special nature of the proceedings and the need (as we have seen above in the relevant case law) for a speedy determination of the proceedings, it isan extremely limited (and, I might add, extremely specific) period of three days – no more, and no less. It is neverthelessan additionalperiod that has beenexpressly stipulated inr 13(1) itself. 74        It is clear, in my view, that the Legislature, having stipulatedtwoextremely specific timeframes in equally clear language,intended that these timeframes be adhered to strictly.In other words, the general requirement under r 13 in general and the specific timeframes stipulated in r 13(1) in particular aremandatory. There was no intention to provide for any further flexibility, nor is any indicated within the express language of r 13(1) itself. 75        I turn, now, to a related point, which I have in fact already alluded to above. Once again, this point does not appear to have been canvassed in the relevant case law although it seems to me to be one that arises clearly not only on the face of the language of the various provisions of the Act itself but also from the spirit underlying those various provisions. And that is the need to be conscious, not only of the plaintiff’s rights, but also ofthe rights or interestsof the defendant which areimpugned by an application under s 90 of the Act. As has already been noted, the present proceedings do not constitute a “normal” election petition (see [47] above). I do not wish to state more here since this leads naturally on to issues that are not before me in the present proceedings,viz, whether or not the plaintiff had filed an application against the wrong defendant in the present proceedings and whether or not (as a closely related point) the thrust and spirit of the Act (read in both logical as well as historical contexts) envisaged applications under s 90 being brought only in relation to the results of specific constituencies, and not the entire General Electionin toto. Be that as it may, it cannot, in point of fact, be denied that the present application is not “normal” inasmuch as the defendants to s 90 applications are usually the successful candidates whose seats are being impugned. However, even assuming that the plaintiff was entitled to file her application in the present proceedings against the Attorney-General, it was nevertheless undeniable that the rights of all the elected Members of Parliament in the 2006 General Election (asde factodefendants) were necessarily involved as a result of the plaintiff’s application. This actuallyunderscoresthe point I have just made with respect to viewing the relevant Act and rules fromthe perspective of the rights of the defendant (whetherde factoorde jure)as well. In other words, the strict timelines (inter alia, in r 13(1)) represented, in my view,the Legislature’s attempt to balance the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s rights which were, ex hypothesi,in irreconcilable conflict with each other. Whilst the Legislature afforded the plaintiff the right to impugn election proceedings which, if successful, would take away the defendant’s rights (including the rights of “de factodefendants” in proceedings such as the present), because of precisely the nature of the proceedings as I have just put it, the Legislature imposed strict timelines to ensure that the plaintiff’s application was mounted seriously and in good faith. Indeed, in the specific context of r 13 itself, we have seen (at [30] above) that the purposes for requiring the furnishing of security arenot only consistent with but also buttress the point made in the preceding sentence. It is undoubtedly the case that thepublic interestought to be safeguarded as well. I do not wish to detract, in any way, from this particular (and extremely important) purpose and rationale – not least because it has been embodied in authorities as august as that of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (in theDevan Naircase at [35] above). However, I do need to emphasise that there is anadditionalreason which is by no means insignificant and whichalsocontributes to the reason and rationale for the strict timelines embodied within,inter alia, r 13(1):This is to ensure that the defendant candidate’s rights are not disregarded as the plaintiff asserts his or her rights under the Act and the PER in the process. In this regard, the following observations by Singham J in theDr Shafiecase ([20]supraat [31]) might also be usefully noted: I am of the view that where it is viewed contemporaneously in the context of the other provisions of the Act … r 4 of the Election Petition Rules 1954 confirms not only the intention of the legislature to expedite the early determination of election petitionbut also to prevent any injustice on the defending candidates, whose election is being challenged, against unspecific and unforeseen allegations from irresponsible challengers. [emphasis added] 76        Returning once again to the language of r 13(1) (and another point), one cannot help but notice that the requirement for the furnishing of security on behalf of the plaintiff is couched in ostensibly mandatory language. I refer, in particular, to the phrase “shallbe given” [emphasis added]. However, in doing so, I must not be taken to be adopting a pedantic approach, much less a dogmatic one, to the effect that whenever words such as “shall” are used, the provision concerned must necessarily be mandatory. Everything depends on the specific language of, as well as the context surrounding, the provision itself. However, other things being equal, such words do suggest that the provision concerned is mandatory. I have, in fact, already canvassed not only the other parts of r 13(1) itself but also the surrounding context as well as the aims of the Act and the PER themselves, and shall therefore not repeat my analysis above. In the circumstances, it is clear to me that the word “shall” in r 13(1) means that this provision is itself mandatory. 77        I turn now to the language ofr 13(4)which is, of course, the provision under which the present proceedings have been brought by the defendant; it reads as follows: If security required by this rule to be provided is not given by the plaintiff,no further proceedings shall be hadon the application under section 90,and the defendant may applyby summons to the Judgefor an order directing the dismissal of the application under section 90 andfor the payment of the defendant’s costs. [emphasis added] 78        Mr Ravi argued, on behalf of the plaintiff, that the words “no further proceedings shall be had” in r 13(4) are not imperative in nature. Mr Chan, on behalf of the defendant, argued (not surprisingly) otherwise. If one simply reads these words alone without more, it could possibly be argued that (from a strictly literal perspective) it is inconclusive as to whether or not a non-compliance with r 13 (as was the case here) wouldnecessarilyresult in a dismissal of the plaintiff’s application. Here, again, however, I must emphasise the need to read the language of a provision not only in relation to the rest of thelanguagein that (as well as related) provision but also in the context of the general intention of the Legislature in so far as that can be ascertained. Bearing these general and fundamental guidelines in mind, let us turn now to a more detailed analysis of r 13(4) itself. 79        I have already referred to Mr Ravi’s argument in the preceding paragraph. With respect, however, what Mr Ravi failed to refer to were theremaining wordsin r 13(4) itself. In particular, whilst the words relied upon by Mr Ravi (“no further proceedings shall be had”) occur in what I consider the first limb of r 13(4), one must also have regard to thesecondlimb in that provision,and consider both limbs in context. 80        The second limb referred to in the preceding paragraph relates to the option on the part of thedefendantto “apply by summons to the Judge for an order directing the dismissal of the application under section 90 and for the payment of the defendant’s costs”. Indeed, this is precisely what transpired, thus resulting in the present proceedings. It is important, in my view, to reiterate that the defendant has theoption or choiceas to whether or not to apply for a dismissal of the application for the plaintiff’s non-compliance with r 13. What happens, then, if the defendant elects not to apply for dismissal? This question in fact gives us a clue as to why thefirstlimb of r 13(4) is phrased the way it is. In particular, it is clear that if the plaintiff has failed to comply with the requirements of r 13, “no further proceedings shall be had” with respect to his or her application under s 90 of the Act,regardlessof whether or not the defendant decides to apply for the dismissal of the plaintiff’s application. This seems to me to be an eminently fair and sensible consequence.However, and this is where thesecondlimb of r 13(4) comes into play,ifthe defendantchooses to exercisehis or her right to apply to the court for an order directing the dismissal of the plaintiff’s application under s 90 of the Act, then the plaintiff’s application must necessarily be dismissed. To reiterate, if the defendant chooses not to exercise this option or choice, thefirstlimb of r 13(4) makes it clear thatthe plaintiff cannot nevertheless take advantage of this by continuing with his or her application under s 90 of the Act. In other words, even if the defendant decides not to exercise his or her right to apply for dismissal under r 13(4), the proceedings initiated by the plaintiff would nevertheless cease. In my view, the entire structure and scheme of r 13(4) is eminently logical and fair. Rule 13(4) gives the defendant the right to apply to have the plaintiff’s application under s 90 of the Act dismissed but if, for whatever reason, the defendant chooses not to exercise this right, the plaintiff cannot take advantage of this as “no further proceedings shall be had” in relation to the plaintiff’s application under s 90 of the Actin any event. This interpretation of r 13(4) in factbuttressesthe view that I have hitherto taken to the effect that r 13 is itselfmandatoryin nature. In other words, the non-compliance with r 13 is not one that can be excused –not evenwhere the defendant himself or herself chooses not to take the matter to its logical conclusion by formally requesting that the plaintiff’s application be dismissed. 81        I pause, at this juncture, to note that while a distinction was drawn in the not too distant past between mandatory and directory provisions, the modern approach has been to focus on therelevant legislative intentioninstead. In the words of V K Rajah J in the Singapore High Court decision ofRe Rasmachayana Sulistyo; ex parte The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd[2005] 1 SLR 483at [24]: The elusive historical approach of characterising procedural provisions as eitherdirectory or mandatory is largely anachronistic today. The preferred approach in modern times in determining the validity of an Act is to understand the purpose of the relevant procedural rule as well as the scope and intent of the governing statute. This approach does not entail ignoring the usage of words such as “shall” or “must” in legislation. It suggests that anyprima facieinference raised by such words may be dislodged after taking into consideration the scope and objectives of the legislation and the consequences arising from alternative constructions. 82        Indeed, this is precisely the approach that I have adopted in the present proceedings, and which, incidentally, was also the approach adopted by Lee J in theChong Thain Vuncase ([25]supraat 73). It might, nevertheless, be helpful to observe that words such as “mandatory” and “directory” are still helpful inasmuch as they assist in focusing on thenatureof the provision concerned and (more importantly) on theconsequencesof non-compliance with it. However, such words do not, in and of themselves, aid substantively in theprocessof ascertaining whether or not the provision concerned is indeed “mandatory” or “directory”. In this regard, there is no substitute for a close analysis of the language of the provision itself set in its legislative context. 83        The approach just suggested also finds some support in the English Court of Appeal decision ofAhmed v Kennedy([36]supra), which was referred to earlier in this judgment. In that case, Simon Brown LJ, cited (at [29]) Lord Woolf MR (as he then was) inRegina v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex parte Jeyeanthan[2000] 1 WLR 354at 362, where he described the then Master of the Rolls as observing that “[the] dichotomy [between “directory” and “mandatory” provisions] is ‘only at most a first step’ and that further questions then arise to help the court decide whether in any given case non-compliance ought properly to be held fatal so as to oust the court’s jurisdiction in the matter”. The learned lord justice then reiterated (ibid) the same approach which was endorsed in the preceding paragraph, as follows: Rather, however, than spend time circling around the ultimate question, I propose to address it directly: does this legislation on its true construction give the court a discretion to waive these petitioners’ timeous non-compliance or must it be regarded as fatal to their proceedings? 84        Turning now to a separate point, thehistorical contextis, in my view, also instructive. The (present) Act has its source as far back as 1947: see the Singapore Legislative Council Elections Ordinance 1947 (No 24 of 1947) (“the 1947 Ordinance”). In particular, r 13 of the PER (found, it will be recalled, in the Fourth Schedule of the Act) corresponds to r 12 in the Third Schedule of the 1947 Ordinance. I pause to note that there were no changes effected to this rule when the 1947 Ordinance was replaced a few years later by the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance 1954 (No 26 of 1954) (“the 1954 Ordinance”). 85        Rule 13(2) of the PER reads as follows: The security shall be to an amount of not less than$5,000. If the number of charges in any application exceeds 3, additional security to an amount of$2,500shall be given in respect of each charge in excess of the first 3. [emphasis added] 86        Rule 12(2) of the Third Schedule of the 1947 Ordinance (and, subsequently, of the 1954 Ordinance) read as follows: The security shall be to an amount of not less thanone thousand dollars. If the number of charges in any petition shall exceed three, additional security to an amount offive hundred dollarsshall be given in respect of each charge in excess of the first three. The security required by this rule shall be given by a deposit of money. [emphasis added] 87        It will be seen that inalmost six decades, there has not been an enormous change in the amount of security required. Indeed, the present amounts (in the present r 13(2) of the PER) were introduced only in 1982 via the Parliamentary Elections Petition (Amendment) Rules 1982 (S 313/1982). More significantly, perhaps, the amounts stipulated in r 12(2) of the Third Schedule of the 1947 Ordinance were extremely sizable when judged against the relative exchange rates and value of money at that particular point in time. Whilst not conclusive, this is an indication that, as originally conceived, the requirement with respect to security for costs was a seriously intended one. This, in turn, supports my finding that r 13 of the PER was intended to bemandatoryin nature. 88        I note, also, that the other Malaysian decisions cited by Mr Chan also buttress my more specific finding with regard to r 13. Let me elaborate. 89        These other decisions related not so much to r 13 but, rather, to the Malaysian equivalent of r 16 of our PER (see, for example, theDevan Naircase). We have already noted that it has been clearly established in the case law (including the case just cited) that this particular rule ismandatoryin nature. 90        My analysis thus far demonstrates – unequivocally, in my view – that decisions such as theChong Thain Vuncase do not contain mere assertions without more but are more than amply justified by an analysis of the language as well as the context and rationale of r 13. At this juncture, we note, once again, the overlap between this broad category (entitled “Precedent”) and the next (entitled “General principle”). 91        I also agree with Mr Chan that the conclusion I have arrived at in the preceding paragraph is further buttressed, on a moregenerallevel, by the broader considerations set out by Lord Upjohn in theDevan Naircase (at [35] above) – in particular, the first, which centres on the need for a speedy determination of the controversy. Mr Ravi sought to meet this particular point by an argument that was more in the sphere of general principle (see [55] above). To recapitulate, Mr Ravi argued that there would, in any event, be a speedy determination of the plaintiff’s application inasmuch as the plaintiff’s application had already been fixed for hearing on 27 June 2006. With respect, however, I find this particular argument (whilst seemingly attractive at first blush) to be flawed for the following reasons. 92        Firstly, if not for the present summons taken out by the defendant under r 13(4), the plaintiff would have continued with her application without complying with r 13 of the PER. This issue might have then been raised as a preliminary jurisdictional point at the hearing on 27 June 2006 itself. This might then have resulted in an adjournment of the substantive hearing. I do not want to speculate but it would have been very surprising if a delay had not resulted along the lines I have just stated. 93        Secondly, and more importantly, I find Mr Ravi’s argument rather disingenuous. There was no guarantee that the substantive hearing would be fixed as early as it has. The fact that we now know that the hearing has been fixed early does not necessarily mean that it would have been the case in the first instance. Hindsight, as the saying goes, is 20/20 vision. In any event, and even more importantly, the entire point of the matter is that the strict timelines contained in the PER (including that embodied in r 13) were to ensure thatno further time whatsoever beyond what was stipulated in the rules themselveswas wasted. In other words, a speedy determination of the controversy is not a “wait-and-see” situation, such as the plaintiff would have us believe. It is a direct process, if you like,without the slightest delay contemplated. Besides, if one were to accept Mr Ravi’s argument, there is virtually no hearing that would not satisfy the rationale centring on a speedy hearing. This would be especially so if one adopted a “wait-and-see” approach such as that advocated by Mr Ravi, where one would actually utiliseex post factorationalisationafter ascertaining what the date of the substantive hearingwould bein order to argue that there has been no delay. Even more pertinently, as Mr Chan (very persuasively, in my view) put it, if time could be extended, where would one draw the line? What if further excuses were given by the plaintiff? This ispreciselywhy a speedy determination in the manner stated by the Privy Council in theDevan Naircase ([25]supra) centred ona strict adherence to the timelines which will,ex hypothesi, result in the certainty that is crucial in the context of elections. 94        I turn now to the precedents proffered on behalf of theplaintiff. In contrast, and as I have already noted earlier in this judgment, Mr Ravi could muster but one solitary precedent which was in the plaintiff’s favour. This is of course the decision of the Malaysian High Court in theSulaimancase ([50]supra). This decision was in fact considered by Lee J in theChong Thain Vuncase ([25]supra), and this is what the learned judge had to say about the case (at 74): I think I should mention the case ofSulaimanv.Choong Yoon Chong. There the petitioner paid sufficient deposit within the time specified but the deposit was paid to the registrar of the Supreme Court instead of the proper officer, that is, the Supervisor of the Town Council Elections. Respondent applied for theelection petition to be dismissed on the ground that no deposit by way of security for costs had been made as prescribed by theElection Petition Rules, 1954. Smith, J. thought that the action which the judge should take was entirely discretionary. He considered that as sufficient security had been paid and that there had been sufficient compliance with the spirit of the regulations it would be inequitable to refuse the petitioner a hearing of his petition. He therefore dismissed the application.That case can be distinguished from the two petitions under consideration. The Registrar of the Supreme Court is an officer of the court and he made the mistake of accepting the deposit when he should have directed the petitioner to make the payment to the proper officer. Although Smith J. did not say so in so many words his approach seems to suggest that where the mistake was that of the court, the blame should not fall on the petitioner.The question of insufficiency of security did not arise. Also the question of time did not arise. Further that case was decided before the decision of the Privy Council inDevan Nairv.Yong Kuan Teik.[emphasis added] 95        As alluded to above, Mr Chan argued that Lee J hadeffectivelyoverruled theSulaimancase, although the learned judge had sought to distinguish this decision on the two grounds set out in the above quotation. Indeed, Lee J also referred to thesubsequentPrivy Council decision in theDevan Naircase, thus buttressing Mr Chan’s point that Lee J was not really sympathetic to the decision in theSulaimancase. 96        Following from my analysis of the language and context of r 13 above (in particular, of paras (1) and (4) thereof), I do not, with respect, think that theSulaimancase ought to be followed. Quite apart from Mr Chan’s point that it stands alone in the entire jurisprudence of elections law in Malaysia, I would myself have arrived at the opposite conclusion from my own analysis of r 13 without more, which analysis I have set out in some detail above. Whilst I acknowledge that theSulaimancase dealt (as Lee J alluded to in theChong Thain Vuncase (see [94] above)) with a different issue, a central thrust adopted by Smith J in theSulaimancase (and which was an integral part of his overall decision) was that the equivalent of r 13 of the PER was directory rather than mandatory (see at [50] above). To that extent, and for the reasons I have already set out above, theSulaimancase is wrong and ought not to be followed.",
        "General principle": "97        I turn now to the various arguments from general principle tendered by both parties. I should add, however, that most of these arguments (in particular, those relating to the public interest in the speedy resolution of the controversy concerned) have already been considered in this part of the judgment relating to an analysis of the relevant case law. Indeed, only two substantive arguments from general principle remain. 98        The first is whether or not the Rules of Court apply in the present proceedings, a point on which (as we have seen) both parties have proffered diametrically opposed views. The second relates to the more general argument made by Mr Ravi to the effect that the plaintiff, having taken all reasonable steps to fulfil her obligations to furnish security for costs under r 13, ought not to be penalised harshly. I now consider these argumentsseriatim. Are the Rules of Court applicable? 99        I consider, first, the issue as to whether or not the Rules of Court apply in the context of proceedings such as these. There is, to the best of my knowledge, no specific decision covering this point in the Singapore context. This issue has therefore to be decided from first or general principles. 100      In my view, the issue can be resolved without even having recourse to either Mr Chan’s or Mr Ravi’s arguments. This is because I have found that r 13 is amandatoryprovision. If so, then it must,ex hypothesi, be complied with strictly. In other words, there can beno roomfor extension of time so that even if it were open to this court to consider the application the Rules of Court in general and the provision therein for extension of time in particular, it would make no difference to the present proceedings since it is clear, as I have elaborated upon above, that r 13 is clearly mandatory and must be complied with strictly. This interpretation is further supported by the opening words of r 3 of the PER itself (reproduced above at [44]), which state that the application of the Rules of Court, with the necessary modifications, to the practice and procedure in any proceedings under the Act is “[s]ubject tothe provisions of these Rules [viz, the PER] and of the Act [viz, the Parliamentary Elections Act]” [emphasis added]. It should also be noted that the underlying philosophy and as concomitant general approach adopted in the Rules of Court are quite different, as the underlying presumption appears to be that the provisions contained therein are generally directory rather than mandatory (reference may be made, in this regard, to O 2 r 1 of the Rules of Court). 101      However, as I have already pointed out above, the precise relationship between O 1 r 2(4) of the Rules of Court and r 3 of the PER is none too clear. It is not necessary for me to attempt to clarify this relationship (assuming that this is possible in the first instance), having regard to my holding in the preceding paragraph. I will content myself with a few tentative comments, leaving it to a later court to expound on the issue in more detail when faced with it directly. 102      It seems to me that r 3 of the PER is intended to be a “gap-filling” provision. By this I mean that the PER constitute the foundational set of rules which govern proceedings under the Act, although relevant provisions of the Rules of Court might apply, with the necessary modifications, where a certain procedural issue or step is not covered by any of the specific rules within the PER themselves. That this is the case is buttressed by the language of O 1 r 2(4) of the Rules of Court (reproduced at [45] above). Indeed, a plain reading of O 1 r 2(4) clearly envisages that the Rules of Court will have little, or no, role to play in the context of the Act itself. Pausing for the moment, the view to the effect that r 3 of the PER is intended to be “gap-filling” only is perfectly consistent with my holding to the effect that r 13 is a mandatory provision which must be complied with strictly. 103      That r 3 of the PER plays a “gap-filling” role appears to be further supported by the relevantlegislative history. 104      It is apposite to commence by setting out s 100 of the Act, as follows: Procedure and practice on applications under section 90 100.—(1) The procedure and practice on applications under section 90 shall be regulated by rules which may be made by the Rules Committee constituted and appointed under section 80 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322). (2)        The Rules contained in the Fourth Schedule shall be deemed to have been made under the powers conferred by subsection (1)and shall be amendable by rules made under that subsection. [emphasis added] 105      Section 100 was in fact present in the Act right at the outset – as s 86 of the (original) 1947 Ordinance, which read as follows: 86.—(1) The procedure and practice on election petitions shall be regulated by rules which may be made by the Rules Committee constituted and appointed under the provisions of section 88 of the Courts Ordinance. (2)        The rules contained in the Third Schedule to this Ordinance shall be deemed to have been made under the powers herein conferred. 106      It can be seen that s 100 of the Act is, in all but one substantive respect, the same as s 86 of the 1947 Ordinance, as represented principally by the italicised words at [104] above. These italicised words serve, in my view, to underscore the view expressed below (at [108]) to the effect that s 100 was originally introduced in order to pave the way for the promulgation of a new and comprehensive set of elections rules. 107      Although the 1947 Ordinance (and, hence, the (present) Act) can be traced, in the main, to the then Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Order in Council 1946 (see, for example, the Objects and Reasons to the Bill for the 1947 Ordinance in theSupplement to the Government Gazette(S 176/1947) and theReport of the Legislative Council Elections Drafting Committee(Singapore, April, 1947) (“theReport”) at pp IV–V as well as Annexure B, pp ii–iv), s 86 (and, hence, the present s 100) was completely new (see the comparative table in theReportat Annexure A, p 89). 108      It would appear that the present s 100 of our Act was originally introduced as a completely new provision altogether in order to pave the way for the promulgation of a comprehensive set of elections rules which would have taken the place of the rules in the then Third (and presently, Fourth) Schedule. However, this was not to be. The reasons are unclear. But one thing is clear: What is now r 3 of the PER was introduced in 1982 via the Parliamentary Elections Petition (Amendment) Rules 1982 (S 313/1982). Once again, however, the reasons for the introduction of r 3 are unclear. However, having regard to the legislative history behind s 100 of the Act, it might well have been the case that the rules in the Fourth Schedule of the Act were thought to be adequate and, hence, this resulted in the absence of a new set of elections rules. Nevertheless, the language and tenor of r 3 suggest that this provision was introduced in order to “fill in the gaps” in situations where the situation concerned was not otherwise provided for by the rules in the Fourth Schedule of the Act themselves. 109      The approach I have suggested is also consistent with Mr Chan’s argument which has been set out briefly above (at [43]) – but only in the end result (cf, for example, the absence of discussion of O 1 r 2(5) of the Rules of Court (reproduced at [46] above)). However, if my respective interpretations of r 3 (as a “gap-filling” provision) and r 13 (as a mandatory provision) are correct, there is no need to have recourse to Mr Chan’s argument. And, in the light of my reading of,inter alia, these rules, Mr Ravi’s argument (at [56] above) cannot succeed. The argument that reasonable steps were taken to furnish security 110      I turn, next, to Mr Ravi’s argument that the plaintiff had taken reasonable steps to furnish the requisite security for costs under r 13 and hence ought not to be penalised. With respect, I do not find this particular argument even slightly convincing in the least for the following reasons. 111      Firstly, as I have already pointed out above (at [91]), the plaintiff took steps to furnish the requisite security for costsonly after the present applicationwas taken out by the defendant. 112      Secondly, it was the plaintiff who had brought the substantive application in the first instance. In the words of Lee J in theChong Thain Vuncase (quoted at [32] above), “[p]eremptory language is used by the rules and it behoves a petitioner to study the rules carefully so that every provision is complied with”; and as the learned judge proceeded to observe (at 74): If there is a breach of the provision of this rule, it makes no difference whether the petitioner has misinterpreted or misunderstood it he must take the risk. The respondent is entitled to take advantage of a petitioner’s faults. The provisions of this rule must be strictly complied with. 113      Reference may also be made to the equally pertinent observations of Skinner J made in a similar vein in theCharlee Sohcase ([33]supra, and as quoted at some length at [34] above). 114      I should add that even on a general level, I find that the plaintiff’s arguments in this particular regard have, with respect, no merit. It would be more appropriate to state them in the conclusion to this judgment, which I do (see [115]–[118] below). I will point out that one ought not to be misled by superficially attractive arguments of sympathy without also examining closely the entire context, which also includes therightsofotherinterested parties, amongst other considerations.",
        "The plaintiff’s arguments": "",
        "The defendant’s reply": "58In reply, Mr Chan responded specifically to some of the arguments raised by Mr Ravi. 59        He first argued, referring to the judgment of Lee J in theChong Thain Vuncase ([25]supra), that the decision in theSulaimancase (which Mr Ravi had relied upon at [50] above) had been all but overruled. I will deal with this particular argument in more detail below (at [94]–[96]). 60        Secondly, he argued that the extra-legal considerations raised by Mr Ravi (see [51] above) were legally irrelevant. 61        Thirdly, and referring to the argument by Mr Ravi (at [57] above) to the effect that the plaintiff had taken reasonable steps to furnish the requisite security under r 13, Mr Chan argued that this was “only one-half of a clap”, but that one needed “two hands to clap”. He argued that Mr Ravi had omitted to refer to what I would (in the spirit of the current expression) refer to as the other side of the coin or equation. In particular, he (Mr Ravi) had not referred to the fact that this “other side” entailed considering whether or not the election officials and/or this court had thelegal powerin the first instance to accept or endorse the attempted (late) payment by the plaintiff. 62        Fourthly, Mr Chan argued that nowhere else do we find words similar to those found in r 13(4). 63        Finally, Mr Chan emphasised that the relevant election laws are neutral in nature. 64        I turn now to an analysis and evaluation of the various arguments made by both Mr Chan and Mr Ravi on behalf of their respective clients, and which I have set out briefly above.",
        "Analysis and evaluation": "",
        "Conclusion": "115      It is the duty of every court to sift the legal wheat from any (and all) irrelevant chaff. The “irrelevant chaff” in this particular instance comprised bare appeals by the plaintiff for sympathy without reference to either the relevant law or the fact that what she requested in her application involved serious legal issues and consequences. The plaintiff sought to paint the picture of one who was a mere layperson – ignorant and helpless. With respect, this was a wholly one-sided version of events which cleverly omitted to give – as common fairness required – a full as well as accurate picture that placed all the circumstances in their proper context. The fact of the matter was that this was a serious application which was submitted to the Registry of the Supreme Court in proper legal form by the plaintiff. She had initiated the main proceedings and was obviously clear about what she intended to achieve from a legal point of view (and see [1] above). To reiterate, the key issue in these proceedings was whether r 13 was a mandatory one. It clearly was for the reasons I have set out above. It was not a mere “optional extra”. The plaintiff clearly failed to comply with r 13. To accommodate the plaintiff in the present proceedings out of what would in any event be a misguided and arbitrary exercise of sympathetic feelings is to ignore, blatantly, a clear and mandatory legal rule, for which (as I have pointed out above) there is an equally clear (and no less significant) rationale. Indeed, it is precisely this clear rationale that furnishes the legal rule with its underlying spirit of justice and fairness. In the circumstances, to accede to the plaintiff’s request in the present proceedings would, in effect, be to commit two related errors simultaneously,ie, blatantly ignoring a mandatory rule out of a misguided sense of sympathy. 116      I should add that adherence to the law is the essence of the rule of law, which centres on objectivity as opposed to arbitrary subjective feelings (in this particular instance, of misguided sympathy). And respect for the law is not merely a practical necessity; it is an ideal without which arbitrariness will rear its ugly head. Merely dressing such arbitrariness up in various labels without more is to be eschewed, for labels without substance constitute not only empty rhetoric but also exceedingly dangerous things indeed – and all the more so when they have a superficial attractiveness, and nothing more. The exercise, as well as the ideal, of freedom are legitimate and real only when they are effected in accordance with the legal rules concerned. And it bears emphasising once again that the legal rule that is the focus of the present proceedings is undergirded by a clear rationale that constitutes its underlying spirit of justice and fairness. This meets – indeed roundly refutes – the charge of technicality as well as legalism or positivism which was a major plank in the plaintiff’s case in the present proceedings. 117      It is also axiomatic, commonsensical as well as just and fair that there cannot be a claim by a party for the vindication of legal rights without that party simultaneously fulfilling his or her legal responsibilities. In other words, one cannot claim one’s legal rights without fulfilling one’s legal responsibilities. The rhetoric of rights is not a licence for the unilateral appropriation of advantages without legitimate reciprocation; indeed, such conduct would bethe very antithesisof the ideal underlying the very concept of rights as legitimately conceived. As I have already mentioned, one of the plaintiff’s legal responsibilities when she was making her application – and a mandatory one at that – was to furnish the requisite security for costs stipulated under r 13. Indeed, there was an additional grace period of three days as well. Notwithstanding this, she did not fulfil those responsibilities and the defendant was therefore justified (under r 13(4)) in taking out the present application. 118      Lest it be thought that such an approach is excessively harsh, even when taking into account the underlying spirit of justice and fairness referred to above, I would only state that the Act and the PER are themselvesneutralin nature inasmuch as they could be relied upon byany partyso long as that party could bring himself or herself within the ambit and spirit of the rule(s) concerned. Indeed, in so far as a breach of r 13 was concerned, had the shoe been on the other foot, so to speak, the option would have lain with the present plaintiff to have made precisely the same application taken out by the present defendant in the present proceedings. In other words, if the present plaintiff had been the defendantinstead, and a similar situation had arisen, it would haveclearlybeen open toherto apply under r 13(4) for the application against her to be dismissed. When posed with this hypothetical situation, Mr Ravi really had no answer, save for a half-hearted response to the effect that he would not have advocated such an application. But, surely, this is beside the point. As is obvious from r 13(4) itself as well as the case law (see generally, and respectively, [77]–[80] and [31]–[34] above), the option is of course with the defendant. But that does not – and cannot – detract (in any way) from the fact that a breach of r 13 entitles the defendant concerned to take out an application to dismiss the plaintiff’s application. 119      In the circumstances, I grant an order in terms of prayers (1) and (2) of the present application. The costs of the present application, granted to the defendant under prayer (2), are to be taxed. It follows that the plaintiff’s application in Originating Summons No 1017 of 2006 is also dismissed with the costs of that application also to be taxed."
