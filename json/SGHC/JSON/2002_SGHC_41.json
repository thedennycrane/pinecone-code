On 8 January 2002, after hearing counsel for the parties, I dismissed the\n\nBank’s appeal with costs. On 6 February the Bank filed a notice of appeal against the\n\nwhole of my decision and I now give my written grounds of decision.Statement of Claim2 The following are the salient points pleaded by Ow in his Statement\n\nof Claim. The Bank is incorporated in Switzerland and has a branch in Singapore. Ow had\n\nbeen a customer of the Bank since 23 April 1997, when he signed a Facility Agreement with\n\nthe Bank in which he obtained a multi-currency overdraft facility of up to the equivalent\n\nof US$10 million (\"the Facility\"). At that time Ow had an overdraft account with\n\nthe Bank of America (\"BOA\"). The sole purpose of this exercise was to obtain a\n\nSingapore dollar loan at a lower rate of interest than what he was paying in his BOA\n\noverdraft. His dealings with the Bank were conducted through Ho Yong Chong\n\n(\"Ho\"), an employee of the Bank at the material time. Prior to the opening of\n\nthe Facility, Ho had represented to him that he could draw down on the Facility entirely\n\nin Singapore dollars notwithstanding that it was structured as a multi-currency facility.\n\nAt all material times the Bank, through Ho, was fully aware that Ow wished to draw down on\n\nhis loan in Singapore dollars in order to discharge his outstanding BOA overdraft which\n\nwas in Singapore dollars. The Facility, which was secured by a mortgage over his\n\nwife’s property, was opened in reliance upon Ho’s representations.3 On 28 July 1997 Ow, intending to draw down on the Facility to fully\n\ndischarge his BOA overdraft which stood at approximately $10 million, went to see Ho about\n\nthis. After checking with the Bank’s Credit Manager, Ho advised Ow that the Bank did\n\nnot have sufficient Singapore dollars at the time and only $3 million had been approved\n\nfor drawdown. The balance sum could be drawn down in US dollars. Ho had represented to Ow\n\nat the time that, as the Bank was obliged to provide him with Singapore dollars under the\n\nFacility, it would shortly convert the US dollar drawdown into Singapore dollars. In\n\nreliance of this assurance, Ow proceeded with the drawdown partly in Singapore dollars and\n\npartly in US dollars and used it to discharge the BOA overdraft which stood at\n\n$10,767,707.18.4 The Bank subsequently refused to convert the US dollar component of\n\nthe drawdown to Singapore dollars despite his repeated requests on various dates in 1997\n\nand 1998. The Bank gave the reason that it did not have sufficient Singapore dollars\n\navailable to convert the whole of his drawings. When the 1997 economic crises hit in late\n\n1997, Ow found that the amount purportedly outstanding in the foreign currency component\n\nof his drawings increased dramatically. The Facility Agreement provided for the drawdown\n\nto be within 80% of the value of the mortgaged property. Due to the currency fluctuation\n\nand falling property values, the Bank constantly pressured him to reduce the overdraft to\n\nkeep it within the limit.5 Ow further pleaded that another of the Bank’s officers, Davartz,\n\nhad asked him to introduce new customers to the Bank. In particular Davartz asked whether\n\nhe could meet Ow’s two sons, who were based in Johore Bahru, to discuss the opening\n\nof a Share Trading Account. Ow arranged for them to meet in Johore Bahru on 25 September\n\n1997. Thereafter Ow’s sons opened a Share Trading account with the Bank. Ow said that\n\nthe express agreement or understanding was that this account would be separate and\n\ndistinct from his accounts. The Bank subsequently reneged on that understanding and sought\n\nto treat the shares deposited by his sons as security for the Facility. His sons applied\n\nin the Malaysian courts for an injunction restraining the Bank from disposing their shares\n\nto settle Ow’s debts. An injunction was granted. However the Bank breached the\n\ninjunction and sold the shares in October 1999. This matter is the subject of legal\n\nproceedings in Malaysia.6 On 29 July 1999 the Bank agreed to convert into Singapore dollars up\n\nto the equivalent of $10 million of the foreign currency component of the drawdown. The\n\nBank refused to convert the entire foreign currency component. However on 30 August 1999\n\nthe Bank agreed to full conversion.7 On 1 September 1999 the Bank made a written demand for Ow to make\n\nfull payment of the sums of about $11.15 million and 558 million. The Bank gave Ow two\n\noptions, either pay the sum of US$1.2 million by 6 September, or sign a mandate to the\n\nBank to authorise it to realise all assets deposited and charged to it, without specifying\n\nwhat those assets were or whether they included the shares deposited by his sons in\n\nrespect of their Share Trading Account. Ow did not accept either option. The Bank’s\n\nsolicitors, M/s Khattar Wong & Partners (\"KWP\"), sent a letter dated 8\n\nSeptember 1999 in which they gave notice of termination of the Facility and demanded full\n\npayment of the sums set out above.8 On 8 October 1999 KWP wrote to Ow’s wife demanding payment of\n\nthe said sums. On 20 October, KWP served a notice on the mortgaged property requiring the\n\noccupiers to quit and deliver vacant possession within one month. On 3 December 1999 the\n\nBank commenced an action in respect of the mortgaged property in OS 1883/1999 in respect\n\nof the following sums:Principal advanced up to 12 October 1999:$19,743,516.90Principal repaid:$  3,867,554.13Principal outstanding on 3 December 1999:$15,993,367.51Interest outstanding on 3 December 1999:$       37,595.37Total outstanding on 3 December 1999:$16,030,962.889 Ow claimed that he had suffered loss and damage arising from the\n\nBank’s failure to provide him with Singapore dollars for his initial drawdown in July\n\n1997 and its subsequent failure to convert the foreign currency component to Singapore\n\ndollars. Ow prayed for a declaration that he was only liable to pay the Bank an amount\n\nrepresented by the Singapore dollar equivalent of his first drawdown on 28 July 1977\n\ntogether with interest thereon less all sums paid into the account.10 On 4 July 2000 Ow amended the Statement of Claim to include the\n\npleading that in entering into the Facility Agreement, the Bank was in breach of s\n\n29(1)(a) of the Banking Act as well as Monetary Authority of Singapore (\"MAS\")\n\nNotices 1001 and 1012 relating to limits on credit facilities to a single borrower. This\n\namendment was made after further discovery by Ow’s solicitors of documents from the\n\nBank. Ow pleaded that such breach rendered the Facility Agreement illegal and this\n\nprecluded the Bank from making any claim whatsoever against him in respect of the\n\nFacility. He prayed for a declaration that the Bank was precluded from claiming against\n\nhim as a result of this breach.Defence and Counterclaim11 The Bank pleaded as follows in its Defence and Counterclaim. The\n\nFacility Agreement was expressly stated to be a multi-currency account. Ho had not made\n\nany of the representations alleged by Ow. The Bank had no obligation under the Facility\n\nAgreement to obtain sufficient Singapore dollars for Ow to drawdown on. All foreign\n\ncurrency drawdowns were made by Ow willingly and he had made use of the Facility to engage\n\nin currency speculation.12 In respect of the alleged breaches of the Banking Act and MAS\n\nNotices, the Bank pleaded at no time had it committed any such breaches.13 The Bank counterclaimed against Ow for the repayment of the\n\noutstanding balances in the Facility which, on 14 December 1999 stood at $15,875,962.77 in\n\nrespect of the principal and $170,374.69 in respect of unpaid interest. The Bank also\n\nclaimed further interest from 14 December 1999 and expenses and legal costs on an\n\nindemnity basis.Application under O 27, r 314 The Bank’s present application is under O 27, r 3 of the Rules\n\nof Court which provides as follows:Judgment on admission of facts (O 27, r 3)3. Where admissions of fact are made by a party to a cause or\n\n  matter either by his pleadings or otherwise, any other party to the cause or matter may\n\n  apply to the Court for such judgment or order as upon those admissions he may be entitled\n\n  to, without waiting for the determination of any other question between the parties, and\n\n  the Court may give such judgment, or make such order, on the application as it thinks\n\n  just.15 Counsel for the Bank, Mr Tay, submitted that Ow had pleaded that he\n\nhad drawn down the sum of $10,767,707.18 on 28 July 1997 to discharge the BOA overdraft\n\naccount. Therefore Ow had admitted that he was liable to the Bank for at least that sum.16 Order 27, r 3 relates to admissions of fact, whether in the\n\npleadings or otherwise. If the liability turns on a question of law or mixed law and fact,\n\nadmissions of fact alone cannot determine the matter – seeShunmugam Jayakumar v\n\nJeyaretnam[1997] 2 SLR 172at 35 & 36. Therefore where a defendant admits to\n\nnegligence but denies causation there is no admission of liability – seeBlundell\n\nv Rimmer[1971] 1 All ER 1072 which is approved by the Court of Appeal inRankine v\n\nGarton Sons & Co Ltd[1979] 2 All ER 1185. There must be\"a clear\n\nadmission of facts in the face of which it is impossible for the party making it to\n\nsucceed\"-perSargant J. inEllis v Allen[1914] 1 Ch. 904 at\n\np.909. In that case the defendant’s counsel was not able to show how, with the\n\nadmissions made, the defendant would be able to succeed in defending the action. Sargant\n\nJ. gave judgment against the defendant saying (at p.909):\"I cannot conceive any circumstances which the defendant Allen\n\n  could rely on as a defence to the action, having regard to the admissions made by the\n\n  letter, and I hold that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment against him under [this\n\n  rule]\"17 In the present case, although Ow had admitted to drawing down the\n\nsum in question he had, crucially, pleaded that the Bank was precluded from recovering\n\nfrom him in view of the alleged breaches of the Banking Act and MAS Notices. If he is\n\nright on this issue, then he would not be liable. To give judgment for the Bank against Ow\n\nwould determine this issue. In an application under this rule the court would only\n\nconsider whether there is a clear admission of any fact that would entitle the other party\n\nto such judgment as he may be entitled to upon those admissions. The court would not\n\nexamine the likelihood of success of any pleading – unlike in an application under O\n\n14. Order 27, r 3 is intended to provide an immediate judgment based on clear admissions\n\nof fact and there is no scope for any consideration of the veracity of the pleadings\n\nunless it is clearly untenable. InRankine v Garton Sons & Co Ltd, Stephenson\n\nLJ. said at p.1190:\"… the plaintiff is seeking immediate judgment on admissions\n\n  of fact, and under the express terms of the rule under which he seeks it the court has to\n\n  be satisfied that he is entitled to it, and to be entitled to it he has to prove both\n\n  elements of his cause of action; and nothing short, it seems to me, of a clear admission\n\n  of liability, both of negligence causing the accident and of damage resulting from the\n\n  accident caused by the negligence, is enough to satisfy the requirements of the rule and\n\n  to entitle him to judgment. If he cannot point to an admission in clear terms of both the\n\n  necessary ingredients of his cause of action, he cannot get an interlocutory judgment. He\n\n  must wait until the judge tries the issue of damages ...\"18 In the premises, I dismissed the Bank’s appeal with costs.Sgd:LEE SEIU KINJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
