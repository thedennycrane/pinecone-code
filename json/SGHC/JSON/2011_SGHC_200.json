        "Introduction": "1       The parties, Mdm Chan Pui Yin (“the\n                    Plaintiff”) and Mr Lim Tiong Kei (“the Defendant”)\n                    were divorced after being married for more than 17 years, and the matrimonial\n                    ancillary matters came before me for determination. These included the division\n                    of the matrimonial assets, the issue of custody, care and control for the only\n                    child of the marriage, Dawn Lim Yu Fen (“Dawn”), and the issue of\n                    maintenance for the Plaintiff and Dawn. I made the following orders on 3 May\n                    2011: “5. Orders made:- (a)The Plaintiff\n                            and Defendant are to have joint custody of their daughter, Dawn, with\n                            care and control to the\n                            Plaintiff. (b)The Defendant\n                            shall have liberal access to Dawn, including overnight\n                        access. (c)The Defendant is to pay\n                            maintenance to Dawn at $2,500 per month with effect from 3 May\n                            2011. (d)The Defendant is to pay\n                            maintenance to the Plaintiff at $1 per month with effect from 3 May\n                            2011. (e)(i) The Plaintiff is\n                            awarded the sum of $1,140,000 being 30% of the matrimonial home valued\n                            at $3,800,000. (ii) The Plaintiff is awarded the sum of $3,285,238.60 being 30%\n                            (inclusive of adverse inference drawn against the Defendant) of all\n                            remaining assets valued at $10,950,795.34. (iii) Consequently, the Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff the sum of\n                            $3,491,253.39 being the total award due to the Plaintiff less the value\n                            of the assets in the Plaintiff’s sole name. (iv) The sum of $3,491,253.39 is to be paid in three\n                            instalments as follows:- (a)    The sum of $1,140,000 by 3 August\n                                    2011; (b)    The sum of $1,175,626.70 by 3 November\n                                    2011; (c)    The sum of $1,175,626.70 by 3 February\n                                    2012 (v) The sum of $103,000 due from the Plaintiff to the Defendant is to\n                            be deducted from the 1st instalment payment. (vi) The Plaintiff and Dawn are to move out of the matrimonial home\n                            within 7 days of receipt of the 1st instalment payment or the date of\n                            the Transfer of the Plaintiff’s 30% share in the matrimonial home\n                            based on a valuation of $3,800,000, whichever is the earlier. 2       The Defendant has appealed against that part of\n                    the Order of Court dated 3 May 2011 that pertains to paragraphs 5(e)(ii), (iii),\n                    and (iv). In short, the appeal is against the Plaintiff’s share of 30% of\n                    all remaining matrimonial assets valued at $10,950,795.34. The matrimonial\n                    assets in the common pool for division are tabulated in Annexure A to this\n                    Grounds of Decision. They included the property known as No 804 Dunearn Road,\n                    Singapore 289671 (“the Dunearn property”) and registered in the\n                    sole name of the Defendant, a unit known as #08-14 Golden Mile Complex, a\n                    commercial property in which the Plaintiff has an interest, her CPF monies,\n                    shares, insurance policies and bank account balances. The Dunearn property with\n                    a current value of $9.75m is the single most significant asset in the pool of\n                    matrimonial assets available for division. The total worth of the assets in the\n                    Plaintiff’s name in the pool was $933,985.21. The orders on division were\n                    for monetary sums to be paid to the Plaintiff and they were not intended to be\n                    orders for the sale of the properties. The mechanism for achieving the division\n                    ordered was for the parties to retain the assets in their respective names and\n                    for the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff the sum of $3,491,253.39 being the\n                    difference between the total sum awarded less the total worth of the assets in\n                    the Plaintiff’s name ($4,426,238.60-$933,985.21 =\n                $3,491,253.39). 3       There is no appeal against the orders made in\n                    respect of the division of the matrimonial home, namely the property known as No\n                    27 Goldhill Drive, Singapore 308975 (“the Goldhill property”). The\n                    Goldhill property was held to be the matrimonial home as on the facts in\n                    evidence the property clearly satisfied the statutory definition in\n                    s 112(10) of “matrimonial assets” in the Women’s\n                    Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed). 4       There is also no appeal against the orders on\n                    maintenance. 5       I should mention that the Defendant had\n                    initially fought the Plaintiff for sole custody, care and control of Dawn.\n                    However, counsel for the Defendant, Mr Imran Hamid (“Mr\n                    Imran”) subsequently confirmed that the Defendant would agree to an order\n                    granting both parents joint custody of Dawn with care and control to the\n                    Plaintiff. Counsel for the Plaintiff, Ms Carrie Gill (“Ms Gill”)\n                    confirmed the Plaintiff’s consent to such an order, if made. 6       Since the Defendant’s appeal is limited to\n                    paragraphs 5(e)(ii),(iii) and (iv) of the Order of Court dated 3 May 2011,\n                    for expediency, I will confine this Grounds of Decision to the division of the\n                    matrimonial assets.",
        "The factual background": "7       The parties were married on 26 February 1992.\n                    The Plaintiff instituted divorce proceedings against her husband, the Defendant,\n                    on 13 November 2008, and the Interim Judgment of Divorce IJ3515/2009 was granted\n                    on 12August 2009. The Plaintiff is presently about 58 years of age, and\n                    she works in the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce as an Associate, drawing a\n                    stated gross monthly income of $5,200. The Defendant is presently about 61 years\n                    of age and he runs his own trading company, Chop Nam Huat Sdn Bhd, in Brunei,\n                    drawing a stated net monthly income of BN$8,000. Dawn was born on 6 October 1992\n                    and she will turn 19 this year. Dawn is a student at LASALLE College of the\n                    Arts. 8       According to the Plaintiff, the couple lived in\n                    the Defendant’s apartment known as #05-02, Silver Tower, a private\n                    condominium located along Cairnhill Road when they were first married\n                    (“the Silver Tower property”). After Dawn was born, the family\n                    moved to the Goldhill property which was home to Dawn and the Plaintiff for the\n                    last 18 years. The family’s living arrangements were that the Plaintiff\n                    and Dawn resided with the Defendant’s parents in the Goldhill property,\n                    with the Defendant working and living in Brunei for the most part of the year\n                    except for the occasional visits to his family in Singapore for 10-12 days at a\n                    time. This was the family’s living arrangement for the last 18 years. The\n                    Defendant admitted to being an absent spouse and father for the most part of the\n                    year except for the occasional visits to his family in Singapore, and the annual\n                    family vacations. Family life for Dawn was growing up with one parent in the\n                    same house as her paternal grandparents, and in a family environment where her\n                    father’s many siblings would frequently drop by the Goldhill property\n                    whenever they called upon their parents. 9       In the early years of the marriage, the\n                    Plaintiff had her mother live with herself and Dawn in the Goldhill property.\n                    Her mother would care for Dawn when the Plaintiff was out at work. She would\n                    prepare Dawn’s meals as well as accompany her to kindergarten and\n                    enrichment classes. This arrangement came to an abrupt halt when the\n                    Plaintiff’s mother fractured her hip in 1997, and she went to live with\n                    her other daughter. 10     Even though the Defendant had settled into\n                    living in Brunei, he paid for the maintenance and repairs to the Goldhill\n                    property, all the household expenses, family outings, transport and vacations.\n                    He also paid for Dawn’s expenses including expenses related to her studies\n                    and her daily allowance. The Defendant also paid for the two renovations to the\n                    Goldhill property. From 2002 or 2003, after the Plaintiff had depleted her\n                    savings on medical expenses for her parents and bad investments, the Defendant\n                    gave her a monthly allowance of $1,500. The Plaintiff contended that since\n                    September 2009, the Defendant had stopped giving her the monthly allowance and\n                    Dawn’s maintenance. In the past, the Defendant would leave behind\n                    pre-signed cheques with the Plaintiff to enable her to settle Dawn’s\n                    expenses and to provide for her monthly allowance. The Defendant’s sister,\n                    Cecilia, was tasked to handle payment of utilities bills and other outgoings\n                    from funds that were deposited into a POSB joint account which the Defendant had\n                    opened with Cecilia. The Defendant claimed that he had to trouble his sister\n                    because the plaintiff did not want to be bothered by this\n                        “chore”.[note: 1] 11     The Goldhill property was purchased by the\n                    Defendant’s father in 1968. It was transferred to the Defendant and his\n                    two brothers in 1974. Later on the Defendant took over his brothers’\n                    shares. According to the Defendant, the shares were paid for by himself and his\n                    father. The Defendant became the registered owner of the Goldhill property on 8\n                    June 1993.[note: 2]It was the Defendant’s case\n                    that two-thirds of his interest in the Goldhill property was gifted to him by\n                    his father. His position was that the Goldhill property wasnota matrimonial asset as it was his parents’ matrimonial\n                        home.[note: 3]The parties tendered\n                    valuation reports of the Goldhill property and for the purposes of division, and\n                    taking the average of the two valuations, the figure of $3,800,000 was treated\n                    as its current value. Notwithstanding the Defendant’s denial, I held that\n                    the Goldhill property was the matrimonial home based on the evidence before me\n                    (see[8]above). 12     The Silver Tower property was registered in\n                    the Defendant’s name. It was bought in 1984 some eight years before the\n                    parties were married. After marriage, the parties lived there for a few months\n                    until Dawn was born. The property was sold in anenblocsale in 2007, and with the sale proceeds, the Defendant\n                    purchased the Dunearn property which was registered in his sole name. According\n                    to the Plaintiff, she wanted her husband to include her name as co-owner but he\n                    refused with the excuse that he had borrowed money to finance the purchase and\n                    he did not want her to be involved in the loan. There was only one property\n                    known as No 5 Springside Walk (“the Springside property”) that was\n                    owned by the couple in their joint names. The Springside property was a terrace\n                    house in Sembawang which was purchased in February 2001 (going by the option to\n                        purchase[note: 4]), but it was\n                    eventually sold in 2007 at a loss.",
        "Whether the Dunearn property should be considered a matrimonial asset\n                and be available for division": "13     It is patently clear from the\n                    Defendant’s Notice of Appeal filed on 2 June 2011 that his dissatisfaction\n                    with the orders made was primarily with the division of the Dunearn property.\n                    The property had appreciated in value over the years to stand at between $9m and\n                    $10.54m in the first quarter of this year based on valuation reports submitted\n                    by the parties. For the purposes of division, and by taking the average of the\n                    two valuations, the figure of $9.75m was adopted as its current value.\n                    Mr Imran’s written submissions adopted the Defendant’s stand in\n                    his affidavit: that the Dunearn property wasnota\n                    matrimonial asset.[note: 5]In the course of the hearing, however,\n                    Mr Imran departed from his written submissions, and accepted, and rightly\n                    in my view, that the Dunearn property, which was acquired during the marriage,\n                    was a matrimonial asset. His case was that the property should not be included\n                    in the pool of assets because there was no financial contribution to its\n                    acquisition from the Plaintiff, and that the Plaintiff’s non-financial\n                    contributions to the marriage and family were such that the equity of the case\n                    was not with her. He citedOng Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei\n                        Lan Kristine[2007] 2 SLR(R) 729 (“Ong Boon Huat”) in support of his proposition\n                    that the Court has the power to exclude a matrimonial asset from the pool of\n                    assets for division. 14     The Defendant’s reasons for exclusion\n                    are paraphrased as follows: that the parties had never lived at the Dunearn\n                    property, and currently the Defendant’s brother resides there; that the\n                    Plaintiff had not made any financial contribution whatsoever to the acquisition\n                    of the Dunearn property in 2007; and that it was registered in his sole\n                    name. 15     Ms Gill argued that the Plaintiff had in fact\n                    made financial contribution to the Dunearn property even though her contribution\n                    was very small. The Dunearn property was bought in February 2007 before theenblocsale of the Silver Tower property was\n                    completed in April 2007. The Plaintiff had contributed $197,812.98 to the\n                    purchase of the Springside property which was purchased for $1,358,000 in 2001.\n                    This property was sold for $1,150,000 with completion taking place in January\n                    2007, and $344,600 of the sale proceeds were utilised to pay the balance of the\n                    Option fee and Stamp fees for the Dunearn property.[note: 6] 16     The Defendant’s documentary evidence\n                    supported his assertion that the Plaintiff did not contribute financially to the\n                    acquisition of the Dunearn property and her claim that she did so was unfounded.\n                    First, the Springside property was sold at a loss of $246,673, and according to\n                    the Defendant, he had effectively absorbed the Plaintiff’s share of the\n                    loss on the property. Second, the funds withdrawn from the Plaintiff’s CPF\n                    account to finance the purchase of the Springside property were returned in full\n                    with interest to the Plaintiff’s CPF account. Third, the Defendant meant\n                    for the remaining proceeds of $927,573.42 from the sale of the Springside\n                    property to be used to pay back the money borrowed from his father to acquire\n                    the same. After $344,600 of these proceeds were used to pay for the balance of\n                    the Option fee and Stamp fees for the Dunearn property, the remaining\n                    $562,222.99 was deposited in a HSBC bank account held in the parties’\n                    joint names[note: 7]. According to the\n                    Defendant, the purchase price of the Dunearn property was about $5m and theenblocsale of the Silver Tower property\n                    yielded about $4m. To purchase the Dunearn property, the Defendant had to borrow\n                    money from his father again. With his father’s permission, he utilised\n                    $927,573.42 from the sale of the Springside property to fund the purchase of the\n                    Dunearn property (hereafter referred to as “the Springside\n                        funds”).[note: 8] 17     The Court of Appeal inNK v\n                        NL[2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 observed that the exclusion of\n                    particular matrimonial assets from the overall computation and division exercise\n                    in favour of dividing only certain assets could prejudice the fair and equitable\n                    division. Andrew Phang JA (delivering the judgment of the appellate court) at\n                        [38] agreed with the reasoning of\n                    Lee Seiu Kin JC (as he then was) inTham Lai Hoong v Fong\n                        Weng Sun Peter Vincent[2002] 1 SLR(R) 391 at [12] that: “To exclude some assets from this consideration could contribute to\n                        a misapprehension in the mind of the judge as to the extent of the\n                        matrimonial assets as well as the extent of each party’s contribution\n                        thereto...” 18     Phang JA emphasised that any attempt to\n                    exclude particular assets from the overall computation has to be strictly\n                    scrutinised as the court’s overarching duty is to achieve a just and\n                    equitable division in all the circumstances of the case (at [40]). One instance where exclusion of a\n                    matrimonial asset was allowed is the case ofOng Boon\n                        Huat. In that case, it was a short marriage- it lasted only 19\n                    months - and both spouses had treated the disputed property as a solo venture by\n                    the husband. Leong Wai Kum,Elements of Family Law in\n                        Singapore(LexisNexis, Singapore 2007) at p 643 observed\n                    that the Court of Appeal’s decision was based on the unusual facts of the\n                    case where the entire risk of the investment was for the husband to assume, and\n                    the wife could not in fairness be allowed to then ask for a share where by good\n                    fortune the property appreciated in value and the husband profited from his\n                    acquisition of the property. Professor Leong cautioned against extending the\n                    decision beyond the special facts of the case. Indeed, the Court of Appeal inNK v NL(at [40]) clarified its decision inOng Boon\n                        Huatby stating that the court’s mandate is to achieve a\n                    just and equitable division so that any attempt to persuade the court to deviate\n                    from its duty must be strictly scrutinised. 19     As mentioned earlier in[13], Mr Imran conceded that the Dunearn\n                    property was a matrimonial asset but that it should be excluded from division\n                    for the reasons alluded to in[14]above. It\n                    was not the Defendant’s case, and there was no evidence, that the Silver\n                    Tower property was gifted to the Defendant. Gifts from third parties and assets\n                    purchased with money obtained from the sale of pre-marriage assets (not gifted)\n                    are two completely different matters. The reason, so it seemed, as to why the\n                    Plaintiff’s name was not included in the Dunearn property was because the\n                    Defendant had told the Plaintiff that he did not want her to be liable for the\n                    loan taken to finance the purchase. The Defendant had not refuted the\n                    Plaintiff’s evidence on this point.[note: 9]Be that as it may, the position\n                    taken by Mr Imran at the hearing was that the property was a matrimonial\n                    asset. Crucially, as to whether it should be excluded from the pool of assets\n                    for division, the Defendant was not able to satisfy me on the evidence that this\n                    was a proper case for exclusion. In the event, the Dunearn property fell\n                    available for division. I now come to Mr Imran’s argument that the\n                    Plaintiff did not contribute financially and non-financially to the acquisition,\n                    improvement or maintenance of the Dunearn property and therefore she should not\n                    be given any share of the property. I disagreed with his submissions (see also[35]below). Typically, the court will\n                    scrutinise all the circumstances of the case, and there are many other factors\n                    that the court will take into consideration in determining a just and equitable\n                    division of the matrimonial assets (see also[33]below). 20     The court will consider the factors listed in\n                    s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter if they are applicable (per LP\n                    Thean JA inLim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng[2001] 2 SLR(R) 260 at [14]).\n                    In the present case, s 112(2)(a) is less significant to the extent of being\n                    inapplicable given the dynamics of this family. Section 112(2)(a) states: Power of court to order division of matrimonial\n                            assets 112. (2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its\n                        powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to\n                        all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters: (a) the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property\n                        or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial\n                        assets; The Plaintiff had no involvement in the Dunearn property simply\n                    because the Defendant’s style and preference was to turn to his siblings\n                    whenever he wanted help. As will be seen later, the Defendant trusted his\n                    siblings more than he did the Plaintiff. 21     In this case, the court should give\n                    consideration and weight to the indirect non-financial contributions of the\n                    Plaintiff to the marriage and welfare of the family. Section 112(2)(d)\n                    states: 112. (2) ... (d) the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of\n                        the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any\n                        aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party; 22     Section 112(2)(d) is particularly important\n                    for the home-maker wife whose contributions are likely to be to the welfare of\n                    the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family. To\n                    illustrate, I refer toYeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo\n                        Nancy[2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“Yeo\n                        Chong Lin”). In that case, the direct financial\n                    contributions were made by the husband while the indirect non-financial\n                    contributions were made by the wife. The husband also paid for the expenses of\n                    the family and the children’s education overseas. The appellate court did\n                    not disturb Judith Prakash J’s finding that the wife contributed to the\n                    family and the marriage to the best of her ability by taking on the roles of\n                    homemaker and mother. Prakash J viewed the matrimonial assets on a global basis\n                    and divided the assets to the wife and the husband in proportions of 35:65\n                    respectively. The Court of Appeal commented that “35% of a large pool of\n                    matrimonial assets would be [just] to a spouse whose contributions were all in\n                    the domestic sphere” (at [82] of the judgment). Again inKoh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah[2007] SGCA 21,\n                    the home-maker wife did not make direct contribution to the assets acquired by\n                    the husband. The wife’s claim was based on her contribution to the welfare\n                    of the family. The court recognised the importance of non-financial\n                    contributions to the welfare of the family and noted that s 112(2)(d) of\n                    the Women’s Charter obliges the court to take into account the extent of\n                    the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including\n                    looking after the home or caring for the family. Finally, inAHJ v AHK[2010] SGHC 148, both parties worked\n                    throughout the marriage. The wife claimed that her indirect contributions were\n                    demonstrated,inter alia, in her care of the\n                    husband’s parents when he was overseas and her sacrifices in giving up her\n                    studies for the family. The wife continued to work after the birth of their son\n                    who was taken care of by the wife’s mother during the daytime. In relation\n                    to a property known as the St Martin’s apartment, the wife claimed that\n                    she took care of the property and secured the tenant whilst the husband was\n                    overseas. The husband disputed this, arguing that he had given a power of\n                    attorney to his sister to deal with the property. Whilst the husband agreed that\n                    the St Martin’s property was within the pool of matrimonial properties for\n                    division, he submitted that the wife’s indirect contributions were\n                    miniscule, and that she should not be given any share of this property. Agreeing\n                    that the wife’s indirect contributions were insignificant, Tay Yong\n                    Kwang J nevertheless adopted a broad perspective in the division and\n                    awarded the wife 20% of its net value. Separately, in the division of the\n                    matrimonial home, the wife did better and was awarded 45% of the net value after\n                    deducting the outstanding loan. 23     Returning to the present case, the real issue\n                    is whether or not there was indeed evidence that the Plaintiff had made little\n                    or no indirect contribution whatsoever to the marriage and family as the\n                    Defendant wanted this court to believe. On this issue, I concluded that the\n                    evidence pointed in the Plaintiff’s favour. I now turn to the\n                    Plaintiff’s indirect contributions. Indirect contributions 24     The salient feature of this case is the\n                    family’s long term living arrangement where the Plaintiff and Dawn lived\n                    in Singapore and the Defendant worked and resided in Brunei. For the last 18\n                    years, the Plaintiff and Dawn resided at the Goldhill property together with the\n                    Defendant’s father, and when the Defendant visited Singapore he too would\n                    stay in the property. His family saw him several times a year for 10-12 days\n                    during each of his visits to Singapore. The Defendant’s mother also\n                    resided at the Goldhill property until she passed away in February\n                2008. 25     The Defendant was an absent spouse and father.\n                    The Defendant’s absence from home was felt by the Plaintiff who said that\n                    she had to cope without her husband’s emotional and physical support, and\n                    that she was Dawn’s primary caregiver and disciplinarian. Notwithstanding\n                    the Defendant’s absence, the Plaintiff maintained that she tried her best\n                    to be a filial daughter-in-law to the Defendant’s parents. She attended to\n                    their ad hoc needs and that she would make time for them whenever they needed a\n                    listening ear. On festive occasions, the Defendant’s siblings and their\n                    respective family members would gather at the Goldhill property and she would\n                    prepare the meals sometimes with the assistance of her sister-in-law. In the\n                    Defendant’s absence, she saw to preserving his family relations (the\n                    Defendant has 17 siblings (excluding spouses) and more than 30 nephews and\n                    nieces) and would observe cultural civilities like giving gifts, and making\n                    hospital visits. 26     It was not disputed that in the 1990s, the\n                    Plaintiff bought and sold shares with funds from the Defendant. The disagreement\n                    between the parties in this area concerned the amount of the capital. The\n                    Defendant alleged that he gave $1m to the Plaintiff. His complaint was that the\n                    Plaintiff had not accounted to him for the capital of $1m. In reply, the\n                    Plaintiff said that (a) she could not remember the size of the capital outlay\n                    save that they lost $800,000-$900,000 in the Asian financial crisis; and (b) the\n                    Defendant had previously accepted the losses and had never asked her to account\n                    until she filed for divorce. 27     In these proceedings, the Defendant had not\n                    produced documents to show that exactly $1m was given to the Plaintiff or used\n                    by the Plaintiff to trade in shares. I considered this omission to be unusual\n                    seeing that he was in the habit of retaining documents of concern to him, from\n                    the most important ones like papers relating to property transactions dating\n                    from as far back as the 1970s to the mundane like monthly credit card\n                    statements, catering bills and receipts. I have already gained a clear\n                    impression of his habit from the voluminous documents produced in the\n                    Defendant’s affidavits. In my view, the Defendant had yet to make good his\n                    bare assertion that $1m was given to the Plaintiff to invest. I do not therefore\n                    see a need for the Plaintiff to account to the Defendant for the $1m as he had\n                    demanded. 28     The Plaintiff accepted that with the funds\n                    provided by the Defendant she traded in shares on their behalf. It was a joint\n                    effort as she was not the sole decision maker and that she would at times\n                    consult the Defendant before making the trades. She would monitor the share\n                    prices and look after the paperwork and the settlement of the trades. It was\n                    evident that while the marriage was ongoing and the relationship between the\n                    parties was good, there was a level of cooperation and trust between them in\n                    investing in the stock market. Even though the entire or the bulk of the capital\n                    was lost during the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the inference to be drawn\n                    from the Plaintiff’s activities in the stock market as described, which\n                    was not unreasonable nor implausible, was that the Plaintiff and the Defendant\n                    wanted to make money in the stock market, and this common goal was part and\n                    parcel of their joint effort to accumulate wealth for the family. The\n                    Plaintiff’s efforts in this regard should not be ignored or trivialised\n                    simply because the venture failed. 29     Mr Imran submitted that the Defendant’s\n                    objection was to the level of contribution the Plaintiff had supposedly made\n                    during the marriage bearing in mind that the Plaintiff had a full-time job and\n                    the domestic chores were undertaken by a full-time maid who was supervised by\n                    the Defendant’s mother. The Defendant has many siblings and he maintained\n                    that they had been supportive of the Plaintiff and Dawn. For instance, his\n                    sister, Cecilia, who was a teacher used to tutor Dawn and monitor her school\n                    work. Furthermore, it was the Defendant’s siblings and full-time maid\n                    rather than the Plaintiff who cared for the Defendant’s parents. His\n                    evidence was that the maid was employed for the purpose of looking after his\n                    aging parents although she did the housework and washed and ironed the\n                    Plaintiff’s clothes. In any case, the Defendant countered that the\n                    Plaintiff could not have cared for his parents as she was constantly at odds\n                    with her mother-in-law and had complained frequently about her father-in-law.\n                    That said, Mr Imran at the hearing of 21 January 2011, however,\n                    conceded paragraph 20(w) of the Plaintiff’s 1stAffidavit which was consistent with the Plaintiff’s evidence that she\n                    tried her best to be a filial daughter-in-law to the Defendant’s\n                    parents: During the weekends, I would often go marketing whenever possible, so as\n                        to prepare home-cooked meals personally for my daughter and the\n                        Defendant’s parents at home. On many occasions, when the Defendant was\n                        in town, I would request for him to take his car from his brother to take me\n                        to the market but the Defendant often asked me to do the same, making me\n                        feel very frustrated. There are time when he would even inconvenience his\n                        sister by making her take me to the market, this making me feel that he is\n                        shirking his responsibility to others instead of fulfilling it\n                        himself. 30     It is clear that the Plaintiff was a single\n                    parent to Dawn. She was mother to Dawn, and she was involved in the daily care\n                    of the child. Although she probably received some help from the\n                    Defendant’s relatives to take care of Dawn given that she had full-time\n                    employment, it could not be denied that she was effectively a single parent and,\n                    in any event, the Defendant’s relatives should not be regarded as his\n                    proxies. Any argument that the Plaintiff was (a) a full-time working mother and\n                    could not have been Dawn’s primary caregiver; (b) assisted by a full-time\n                    maid who did the household chores; and that (c) the maid was supervised by the\n                    Defendant’s mother before her health deteriorated in October 2007 meant\n                    that her indirect contribution was minimal was totally blinkered and was\n                    therefore rejected. In the words of Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) inLee Chung Meng Joseph v Krygsman Juliet Angela[2000] 3 SLR(R) 965 at [41]\n                    (and approved by the Court of Appeal inPang Rosaline v Chan\n                        Kong Chin[2009] 4 SLR(R) 935 (“Pang Rosaline”) at [18]), “[h]aving a maid in the household, or a number of\n                    maids for that matter, does not mean abdication of parental responsibility\n                    towards the child”. Emphasising the need for cogent evidence if a spouse\n                    is to succeed in the allegation of little or no indirect contribution to the\n                    marriage, care of the household and well being of the family - it is a common\n                    occurrence in today’s society that spouses work full-time - Andrew\n                    Phang JA (delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal) said (at\n                        [19]): Indeed, the acceptance of a contrary proposition must presuppose that\n                        spouses who work full-time cannot,ipso facto,\n                        spare any time to contribute towards the marriage or the family at all and\n                        would necessarily have to sacrifice their all (and, consequently, their\n                        marriage as well as family) at the altar of work. Whilst obviously\n                        undesirable, this is not to state that such a situation is impossible.\n                        However, this would have to be established by cogent evidence. It was clear\n                        that such evidence wasnotforthcoming in the\n                        present appeal. Put simply, there was nothing in the evidence before us\n                        which suggested that the wife had, in fact, sacrificed herself as well as\n                        her family and marriage at the altar of work. 31     None of the evidence highlighted by\n                    Mr Imran pointed to or was a sign of an abdication of parental\n                    responsibility by the Plaintiff towards Dawn. Whilst Mr Imran conceded that\n                    as Dawn’s mother, the Plaintiff was the primary caregiver, Mr Imran,\n                    however, disputed the Plaintiff’s claim that she had looked after the\n                    household including the Defendant’s parents. I have already mentioned the\n                    Defendant’s claim that it was his siblings and the full-time maid rather\n                    than the Plaintiff who cared for his parents. In reply to the Defendant’s\n                    allegations in[29]above, the Plaintiff\n                    explained that despite the occasional problems with her mother-in-law, they had\n                    lived together in the same home for 16 years and that they had grown close and\n                    learned to live with each other and accommodated each other’s needs. For\n                    the sake of her mother-in-law, she only divorced the Defendant after her\n                    mother-in-law’s death. As noted, Mr Imran at the hearing of\n                    21 January 2011 conceded paragraph 20(w) of the Plaintiff’s\n                        1stAffidavit which was consistent with the\n                    Plaintiff’s position that she tried her best to be a filial\n                    daughter-in-law to the Defendant’s parents (see[29]above). 32     I now come to the Defendant’s claim that\n                    he maintained regular telephone and e-mail contact with his family whilst he was\n                    away in Brunei. He produced three emails in 2008 as proof, but this did not\n                    impress me at all.[note: 10]As I noticed earlier, the Defendant\n                    was able to exhibit numerous documents to support his assertions, and I had\n                    naturally expected to see a lot more e-mails if he had been in contact with his\n                    family as often as he wanted this court to believe. I also noticed that despite\n                    his counsel’s submissions that the Defendant “takes great care to\n                    be involved and interact with Dawn”[note: 11], the\n                    Defendant had to be reminded to keep in contact with his daughter. I have seen\n                    e-mails from the Defendant’s sister urging or reminding him to contact his\n                    daughter despite his apparent frustration at her monosyllabic responses in\n                        conversations.[note: 12]From the Defendant’s record of\n                    the annual holidays, the time spent together as a family was remarkably short in\n                    some years considering that it was their annual vacation.[note: 13]It is not disputed that the\n                    Defendant has had and continues to have a very difficult relationship with his\n                    daughter, and I did not find this state of affairs surprising since he was\n                    hardly around during her formative years. I have noted an observation made by\n                    the Defendant’s sister in her e-mail dated 31 May 2007 to the\n                    Defendant that Dawn resented his long absence.[note: 14]However, the Defendant blamed\n                    the Plaintiff for creating a rift in the father-daughter relationship, an\n                    accusation which the Plaintiff had strenuously denied and she had singled out\n                    his constant absence from Dawn’s life as the main reason for the state of\n                    their relationship, and his parenting style as another factor.",
        "Division of matrimonial assets": "33     I begin with the principles of a “just\n                    and equitable” division of matrimonial assets as Phang JA reiterated\n                    inPang Rosalineat [23] which bear repeating: The first centred on the fact that the division of matrimonial assets\n                        under s 112 of the Act is not – and cannot be – a precise\n                        mathematical exercise and that the court’s discretion is to be\n                        exercised in broad strokes instead (see, for example, the decision of this\n                        court in [Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye[2007] 3 SLR 520 at [33]-[35]]; indeed,\n                        as this court pointed out, inNK v NL[[2007]3 SLR 743 at [28]].\n                        “It is essential that courts resist the temptation to lapse into a\n                        minute scrutiny of the conduct and efforts of both spouses, which may be\n                        objectionable in disadvantaging the spouse whose efforts are difficult to\n                        evaluate in financial terms”. In this regard, it was also pointed out\n                        inNK v NL(at [22]-[27]), thatdirectfinancial contributions arenotto be considered as aprima faciestarting point although they\n                        nevertheless constitute a factor which should be considered by the court\n                        pursuant to the exercise of its discretion under s 112 of the Act\n                        (which involves what is essentially a multi-factorial approach). We have\n                        also referred to the need to ensure thatindirectcontributions are also accorded due\n                        recognition. [emphasis in original] 34     With the above principles in mind, I turn to\n                    the present case. I have taken into consideration the length of the marriage and\n                    the family’s long term living arrangement and family dynamics. I have\n                    considered the Plaintiff’s indirect contributions to the marriage and the\n                    family including her parents-in-law (see[24]-[31]above). I have\n                    also taken into consideration the Defendant’s financial as well as\n                    non-financial contributions to the acquisition of assets and to the care of the\n                    family and the home. He had provided for the family in terms of financial\n                    contributions to the household and family expenses, family holidays and the bulk\n                    of Dawn’s expenses including her school fees. I accepted that there was\n                    payment of $1,500 monthly to the Plaintiff which she used to defray expenses for\n                    the household, pets and her personal expenses. I have taken into consideration\n                    the Defendant’s medical conditions (he suffers from a growth in his brain\n                    stem and trigeminal neuralgia) and I noted his need to make provision for his\n                    own medical expenses. His health will have a bearing on his future earning\n                    capacity. Fortunately for the Defendant, he is already well-off. 35     As stated earlier, Mr Imran submitted\n                    that bearing in mind that the Plaintiff did not contribute financially to the\n                    acquisition of the matrimonial assets, and based on her indirect contributions,\n                    she should be awarded 20% of the value of the matrimonial home and certainly not\n                    as high as 50% as argued for by Ms Gill. In his view, the Plaintiff should\n                    not be given a share of the Duneran property. 36     I decided to divide the matrimonial home\n                    separately from the rest of the assets in the overall pool. As I see it, after\n                    the resolution of the ancillary matters, the Plaintiff would require housing for\n                    herself and Dawn whom she has care and control of for most of the time as the\n                    Defendant continues to reside in Brunei, and also that the Plaintiff has been\n                    given only a nominal maintenance of $1 by this court. In addition, Mr Imran\n                    informed the court that the Defendant’s father, who is in his late 80s,\n                    still lives in the Goldhill property and that the Defendant does not wish to\n                    move his father elsewhere. In this case, I was mindful that the value of the\n                    Dunearn property was significantly higher than the value of the matrimonial\n                    home, and at the same time, it was in connection with the Dunearn property that\n                    an adverse inference was drawn against the Defendant for keeping his share of a\n                    second unit in the Silver Tower condominium a secret and then revealing it as\n                    ostensibly his father’s retirement fund in the flow chart exhibited at\n                    p 38 of the Defendant’s 4thAffidavit.\n                    (see[41]to[44]below). 37     After viewing everything from a broad\n                    perspective in determining what a just and equitable division would be, I\n                    decided that the Plaintiff should received a 30% share in the Goldhill property\n                    based on the valuation of $3.8m, and I so ordered. 38     For the remaining assets available for\n                    division, they are worth $10,950,795.34. The most valuable asset is the Dunearn\n                    property. Similarly, having regard to the same factors discussed above, and in\n                    the light of the Defendant’s non-disclosures which I will come to shortly,\n                    I decided that the Plaintiff should receive a 30% share of the remaining\n                    matrimonial assets based on the value of $10,950,795.34, and I so\n                    ordered.",
        "Adverse inference and its impact on the proportion of the matrimonial\n                assets to be awarded": "39     There is a duty on parties to make full and\n                    frank disclosure of all information relevant to the ancillary proceedings (seeBG v BF[2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 at\n                        [52]), and the court is entitled to\n                    draw adverse inferences against those parties which fail to do so. An adverse\n                    inference is drawn if there is aprima faciecase\n                    of non-disclosure of material facts (seeKoh Bee Choo v Choo\n                        Chai Huahat [28]). In\n                    particular, the non-disclosure, and the inference drawn for the non-disclosure,\n                    has to be about a matter which can properly be taken into account in arriving at\n                    a fair and equitable division. If an adverse inference is drawn, one way the\n                    court can give effect to it is to order a higher proportion of the known\n                    matrimonial assets to be given to the other spouse, as was done inNK v NL. 40     In these proceedings, there was evidence that\n                    pointed towards the Defendant’s failure to disclose material facts that\n                    would have a bearing on the court’s assessment of a fair and equitable\n                    division. I should for completeness mentioned that unlike the Plaintiff, the\n                    Defendant who had equally accused the Plaintiff of non-disclosure did not come\n                    close to showing, evidentially, that her non-disclosure, if any, would affect\n                    the fair and equitable division. I therefore say no more about the\n                    Defendant’s allegations of non-disclosure and now turn to his instances of\n                    non-disclosures. 41     First, the unchallenged allegation made by the\n                    Plaintiff that the Defendant owned not only #05-02 Silver Tower but that he also\n                    owned a half share in another unit in the same development.[note: 15]In the\n                    Plaintiff’s 3rdAffidavit, she accused the\n                    Defendant of lying about the size of theenblocpayout and exhibited some e-mails and attachments thereto that pointed to (a)\n                    the Defendant’s interest in a second unit in the Silver Tower condominium,\n                    and (b) his sister’s reminders to keep the second unit a secret from the\n                    Plaintiff. At this juncture, I digress to point out that the image quality of\n                    some of the printed e-mail exhibits in the Plaintiff’s\n                        3rdAffidavit was very poor, suffering from ills\n                    such as graininess and blacked out text from the use of non-photocopy safe\n                    highlighters. The upshot of this clearly defeats the objective of highlighting a\n                    document. It is the responsibility of counsel to ensure that the client’s\n                    documentary evidence placed before the court is properly presented as the lack\n                    of care and attention to such details can adversely affect the outcome of the\n                    case. Besides, it is irritating and annoying for the reader and creates a bad\n                    impression all-round. Needless to say, the extracts referred to in this Grounds\n                    of Decision can only come from the legible portions of the exhibits. That said,\n                    the relevant extracts of three e-mails exhibited by the Plaintiff that touched\n                    on the second unit are set out below. I should mention that Messrs Lee & Lee\n                    were the lawyers involved in theenblocsale.

Sis 42     It is quite obvious that the Defendant’s\n                    sister in her e-mail of 2 April 2007 was referring to the Springside funds when\n                    she suggested to the Defendant to make use of the money in the HSBC bank.\n                    Further contemporaneous documentary evidence pointing to the Defendant’s\n                    interest in the second unit in the Silver Tower condominium including what he\n                    received for his share in the second unit is set out below: (1)     On 4 December 2007, the\n                        Defendant’s sister wrote to the Defendant:[note: 19] ... You can keep the bungalow [the Dunearn property]. Just spend a few\n                            hundred thousands to do it up and it is as good as new. why bother to\n                            tear down and rebuild.

Interestingly, the second\n                        attachment stated: “Another $2,580,593.93 (2ndunit of\n                        Silver Tower (Nam Huat) was banked in on 11 April 2007.” 43     The first e-mail-comment at[42]above is consisted with the paragraph 20(v)\n                    of the Plaintiff’s 1stAffidavit where she had\n                    earlier described the Defendant’s initial intention to re-develop the\n                    Dunearn property but the plans were cancelled and the existing house was painted\n                    before the Defendant’s brothers moved in to stay in the\n                property. 44     Exhibited at p 55 of the\n                    Defendant’s 4thAffidavit is a Maybank cheque\n                    dated 12 April 2007 and drawn on the bank account of Nam Hwatt Realty Co\n                    Pte Ltd in favour of the Defendant for the sum of $2,580,593.93. The exact\n                    figure of $2,580,593.93 was referred to in the second e-mail attachment at[42]above (the date\n                    “11 April 2007” was plainly a typographical error since the\n                    date on the cheque was 12 April 2007). Mr Imran had used this cheque\n                    as evidence of the father’s loan to purchase the Dunearn\n                        property.[note: 21]Ms Gill\n                    questioned the cheque exhibited at p 55 of the Defendant’s\n                        4thAffidavit. She observed that the Defendant\n                    had deposed that he made use of the money available from the sale of the Silver\n                    Tower and the Springside funds to pay for the Dunearn property thereby\n                    suggesting that there was no need for another substantial loan from the\n                    Defendant’s father to purchase the Dunearn property. The bulk of the sales\n                    proceeds from the sale of the Silver Tower property amounting to $3,902,347.33\n                    were deposited into a Standard Chartered E-Saver Account in the names of the\n                    Defendant and his sister, Cecilia. After paying the balance of the Option fee\n                    and stamp fee, the available Springside funds were eventually deposited into the\n                    same Standard Chartered E-Saver Account.[note: 22]The Defendant explained that\n                    Springside funds were his father’s money since the acquisition of\n                    Springside property had been financed by the father. If this was true, and\n                    assuming that counsel for the Defendant was mistaken in submitting that the\n                    cheque of $2,580,593.93 constituted the father’s loan to acquire the\n                    Dunearn property, could the cheque of $2,580,593.93 be the Defendant’s\n                    father’s “retirement funds” as alluded to in paragraph 27 of\n                    the Defendant’s 3rdAffidavit? The Defendant\n                    said that the Standard Chartered account was opened to “facilitate the\n                    purchase of another property from the proceeds of the sale of the Silver Tower\n                    property. The account was also opened to park part of my father’s\n                    retirement funds”. No further explanation was proffered as to the value\n                    of the “retirement funds” and it is certainly curious as funds\n                    “parked” in the Standard Chartered account were bound to be mixed\n                    with the Defendant’s own funds. At p 38 of his\n                        4thAffidavit, the Defendant exhibited a flow\n                    chart and in there he referred to the sum of $2,580,593.93 as “Lim Peck\n                    Oh’s funds (father)”.At paragraph 48 of the Defendant’s\n                        4thAffidavit, the Defendant claimed that moneys\n                    belonging to his father had since been returned to him. Unless substantiated by\n                    the Defendant to the contrary, the Plaintiff had, in my view, established aprima faciecase that the Maybank cheque for\n                    $2,580,593.93 was the Defendant’s share of the sale proceeds from theenblocsale of the second unit, namely #\n                    05-04, a unit registered in the name of Nam Hwatt Realty Co Pte Ltd. It was\n                    therefore the true nature of this sum of money and its whereabouts after the\n                    fixed deposit accounts were supposedly closed that the Defendant had failed to\n                    disclose. 45     I now turn to second area where the Defendant\n                    had not explained satisfactorily, and where the Plaintiff had accused him of\n                    failure to make full and frank disclosure. This related to the sum of\n                    $415,789.24 in a fixed deposit account which the Defendant said was used to pay\n                    for the Plaintiff’s debt to her of $103,677.12, the balance of which was\n                    subsequently given to Cecilia. He accepted that Cecilia in her e-mails had\n                    informed him of her investment with the money given to her but he rationalised\n                    that as the money was hers, she could do whatever she wished with the\n                        money.[note: 23]I doubted his explanation for the\n                    unambiguous language used in the e-mails is unequivocal. Despite the\n                    Defendant’s general comments in paragraph 56 of his\n                        4thAffidavit, it is quite clear from the e-mails\n                    below that the Defendant’s sister was trading in shares for herself and\n                    the Defendant.

Other instances of\n                    conduct apparent from the e-mails also bore out their penchant for secrecy. For\n                    example, in the sister’s e-mail of 27 March 2007 to the Defendant,\n                    she wrote:[note: 26] ... I am definitely sure she knows i am holding your pass books and\n                        transaction. She is a damn smart and cunning woman. ... She will never leave\n                        a multi-millionaire husband. 47     More than a year later, in an e-mail dated May\n                    3, 2008 (with the subject titled: Pre-empt), the sister advised the Defendant to\n                    protect his wealth should the Plaintiff decide to divorce the Defendant. The\n                    sister wrote:[note: 27] ... It is obvious that she is a poor wife with a husband who is hardly\n                        with her and no property in her name. ... I think it is a matter of time that she will be asking for a divorce.\n                        ... By going through a divorce, she will have access to one\n                            of your properties and cash. She has many reasons to ask for\n                        a divorce.Just in case it should happen, please think of\n                            how to protect your wealth and property. Money can be stored elsewhere without her knowledge. As\n                            for properties, you can mortgage to the bank on pretext of doing\n                            business (sic) ...Do your own thinking. I have nothing to gain. I do not expect anything from you. I am only very\n                        worried about you, Dawn and your wealth falling into (sic) her relatives\n                        instead of Dawn should she demand maintenance and large sum of money if\n                        there is a divorce.I only want you to be on your guard\n                            if such unpleasant things were to happen. It is difficult to\n                        handle an angry woman esp when she has little feelings left for you bec of\n                        built up over the years. You will have more time to think in Brunei- quiet. It\n                            is stressful but acts are facts. Thinking and planning for the worse is\n                            ok. After (sic) all, what I pre-empt may not happen at all. I too do not\n                            want such happenings. ... Please ponder over what I have written. I\n                        know it is an unpleasant email but as your sister I just want to share with\n                        you my feelings over this matter. [emphasis added] 48     As the story unfolded, the Plaintiff did file\n                    for divorce on 13thNovember 2008. Coincidentally on\n                    the same day, the Defendant received an e-mail from his brother, Ronnie Lim\n                    (“Ronnie”), reporting on the outcome of his inquiry to set up a\n                    trust. Ronnie wrote:[note: 28] Charlie, Spoke to Han Kee Fong. Basically,I told him that you\n                            are toying with the idea of a trust fund.I told him that the trust fund should include these two\n                            functions(although the trust funds will have many other\n                        uses)-starve (sic) off all potential creditors and also\n                            to minimise your matrimonial assets, in the event you should part ways\n                            with S. [emphasis added] The incriminating revelations in[47]and[48]above were\n                    unethical to say the least, and the sister’s advice and Ronnie’s\n                    inquiry on the Defendant’s behalf were quite consistent with the\n                    siblings’ past behaviour as demonstrated by the Defendant’s efforts\n                    to keep the Plaintiff in the dark as to his interest in a second apartment in\n                    Silver Tower Condominium. His willingness to maintain secrecy had severely\n                    damaged his credibility. A bare assertion by the Defendant that he had made full\n                    and frank disclosure would not be good enough in the circumstances. A terse and\n                    dismissive reply that the e-mails were obtained illegally without more would\n                    equally not suffice. 49     This leads me to the Defendant’s claim\n                    that he has no bank account in Brunei and maintained that all his cash was in\n                    his Singapore bank account. The assertion that he has no bank account in Brunei\n                    is incredulous seeing that he had worked and resided in Brunei for more than 20\n                    years, and his salary was paid in Brunei. In relation to the Defendant’s\n                    declared salary of BN$8,000 a month from the company, Chop Nam Huat Sdn Bhd, the\n                    Defendant is one of two directors of the company, and the Financial Statements\n                    for the years 2009 and 2010 indicated that sums of BN$263,250 and BN$276,250\n                    respectively were used to remunerate these directors. Looking at the figures,\n                    the Defendant’s annual director’s remuneration would, on a monthly\n                    basis, work out to more than the declared monthly sum of BN$8000. Furthermore,\n                    the Defendant’s Last Will and Testament dated 31st October\n                        2005[note: 29]and updated at an unspecified date indicated\n                    “Fixed Deposits in Brunei” as a component of his assets available\n                    for distribution although the value of these accounts was not disclosed. The\n                    Defendant, however, claimed that the 2005 Will had been revoked, but he had not\n                    explained what had become of those sizeable fixed deposits. His assertion that\n                    he does not have any fixed deposits in Brunei misses the point; it is an\n                    incomplete answer and is thus unsatisfactory and unacceptable. 50     The Defendant also appeared to have other\n                    accounts held jointly by him together with Cecilia, although he denied this and\n                    maintained that he only had one such account, POSB No. [xxx], held jointly with\n                    Cecilia and used for the purposes of paying bills. Despite acknowledging the\n                    existence of this account, the Defendant failed to disclose any other details\n                    about it, including, crucially, the remaining balance in the\n                account. 51     The evidence above supported the\n                    Plaintiff’s accusations that the Defendant had not been full and frank in\n                    his disclosure of all the information relevant to these ancillary proceedings,\n                    and accordingly I drew an adverse inference against him. 52     Given the nature of the evidence pointing\n                    towards undisclosed assets, it is impossible to even estimate what their value\n                    could amount to and add a corresponding value into the pool for division.\n                    Instead, I found it just and equitable to award the Plaintiff a higher\n                    proportion of the disclosed assets. I am fortified in my approach by the\n                    decisions ofNK v NLandYeo\n                        Chong Lin. Accordingly, as a consequence of the adverse\n                    inferences against the Defendant, I awarded the Plaintiff a further 10% of the\n                    value of the disclosed assets of $10,950,795.34.",
        "Conclusion": "53     For the reasons stated, I made the orders set\n                    out in[1]above. I also ordered that each\n                    party bear his or her own legal costs.",
