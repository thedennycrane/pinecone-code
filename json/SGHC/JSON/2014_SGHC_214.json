        "Introduction": "1       Under\nour immigration law, specifically s 57C(1) of the Immigration Act\n(“Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), it is an offence for a person\nto enter into a marriage knowing or having reason to believe that\nthe purpose of the marriage is to assist one of the parties to the\nmarriage to obtain an immigration advantage, and where any sort\nof gratification is involved. This offence is colloquially known\nas “transacting a marriage of convenience”. The appeal before me\nconcerned the arrangement, or assisting in the arrangement, of a\nmarriage of convenience, a separate offence under s 57C(2) of the\nAct. Under the latter offence, there is no requirement to show that\nany consideration or gratification is involved. 2       The\ncharge levelled against the Appellant, Mehra Radhika, a 22-year old\nfemale Indian national, was that she had committed an offence under s 57C(2)\nof the Act by arranging a marriage of convenience between one Norhayati,\na female Singapore national, and one Gagandeep, a male Indian national,\nwith the intention of assisting Gagandeep to obtain an immigration\nadvantage so as to extend his stay in Singapore. 3       Although\nthe Appellant initially claimed trial, she (later) admitted to the\nStatement of Facts without qualification and pleaded guilty to the charge\non the first day of trial. She was convicted and sentenced by the learned\nDistrict Judge (“DJ”) to eight months’ imprisonment in addition\nto the month or so that she had spent in remand prior to her being\nbailed out. The Appellant appealed against the sentence on two grounds,\nthe first being that the sentence was manifestly excessive and the\nsecond being that the sentence was arrived at by the DJ without\na proper appreciation of the facts. 4       I\nallowed the appeal and reduced the sentence of imprisonment to six months.\nThese are my full grounds of decision to supplement the brief reasons\nI gave when I disposed of the appeal after hearing the arguments.",
        "Facts": "",
        "Background": "5       The\nrelevant facts are set out in the Statement of Facts. The seed of\nthe marriage of convenience was sowed in the middle of 2012, when\nthe Appellant was first contacted by her brother in India and was\nasked for help in finding a job for Gagandeep. In response, the\nAppellant suggested that Gagandeep enter into a marriage of convenience\nwith a female Singapore national as she thought that that would\nmake it easier for him to secure a work permit. His “wife” would\nalso be able to sponsor the extension of his stay in Singapore. 6       The\nAppellant then sought the assistance of her friend, one Peer Ali, in\nFebruary 2013. The Appellant discussed the following proposed terms\nof the marriage of convenience with Peer Ali: (a) the “wife” would\nbe paid a sum of money for her involvement; (b) the “wife” would\nnot need to fulfil any marital obligations; and (c) the “wife” would\nhave to sponsor Gagandeep’s application for a Visit Pass to extend\nhis stay in Singapore. 7       Peer\nAli (evidently, through his brother) found Norhayati quite quickly.\nGagandeep arrived in Singapore shortly thereafter on 26 February 2013\nand just days later, on 2 March 2013, was brought by the Appellant\nto the Toa Payoh South Community Club where his marriage to Norhayati was\nsolemnised. After the solemnisation, the Appellant paid Peer Ali\na sum of $6,300 for his assistance. From the Statement of Facts,\nit was not clear how much of this was paid to Norhayati or if any\nof it was paid by Peer Ali to his brother. 8       The\nAppellant, along with Norhayati, Gagandeep and Peer Ali were all\nsubsequently arrested and charged. Norhayati and Gagandeep were charged\nunder s 57C(1) of the Act for entering into a marriage of convenience.\nPeer Ali was charged under s 57C(2) (as was the Appellant) for arranging\na marriage of convenience. Norhayati and Gagandeep were sentenced\nto six months’ imprisonment each while Peer Ali was sentenced to\nnine months’ imprisonment. 9       For\nease of reference, I set out the entirety of s 57C: 57C.—(1) Any\nperson who contracts or otherwise enters into a marriage — (a)    knowing or having reason\nto believe that the purpose of the marriage is to assist one of\nthe parties to the marriage to obtain an immigration advantage;\nand (b)    where\nany gratification, whether from a party to the marriage or another\nperson, is offered, given or received as an inducement or reward\nto any party to the marriage for entering into the marriage, shall be guilty of an offence and shall\nbe liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment\nfor a term not exceeding 10 years or to both. (2)    Any\nperson who arranges or otherwise assists in arranging a marriage between\n2 other persons, with the intention of assisting one of the parties\nto the marriage to obtain an immigration advantage, shall be guilty\nof an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding\n$10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or\nto both. (3)    This section shall apply to a marriage\nentered into whether in Singapore or outside Singapore. (4)    In any proceedings for an offence\nunder subsection (1) or (2), it shall be a defence for the person\ncharged with the offence to prove that, although one purpose of\nthe marriage was to assist a party to the marriage to obtain an immigration\nadvantage, the defendant believed on reasonable grounds that the\nmarriage would result in a genuine marital relationship. (5)    For the purposes of subsection (4),\nwhat constitutes a genuine marital relationship is a question of\nfact and the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of\nthe case in determining the question. (6)    In this section — “gratification” includes — (a)    money or any gift, loan,\nfee, reward, commission, valuable security or other property or\ninterest in property of any description, whether movable or immovable; (b)    any\noffice, employment or contract; (c)    any\npayment, release, discharge or liquidation of any loan, obligation\nor other liability whatsoever, whether in whole or in part; and (d)    any\nother service, favour or advantage of any description whatsoever; “immigration advantage”, in relation to\na party to a marriage, means the grant or extension of the validity\nof any visa, pass, permit or re-entry permit under this Act or the\nregulations or any order made thereunder for that party or for a\nchild or parent of that party.",
        "The DJ’s decision": "10     The\nDJ imposed what, in effect, was a nine-month term of imprisonment\non the Appellant. His reasons for doing so are contained in his\njudgment which is reported asPublic Prosecutor\nv MehraRadhika[2014]\nSGDC 206 (the “Judgment”). These may be summarised as follows: (a)     Section\n57C of the Act was enacted in December 2012 because Parliament recognised\nthat targeted legislation aimed at marriages of convenience was\nneeded in order to safeguard the security and integrity of our borders\nand to maintain law and order. (b)     As\nother courts have noted, marriages of convenience create serious\nsocial and economic problems, undermine the integrity of the immigration\nsystem, and erode the sanctity of marriage. If left unchecked, human\ntrafficking and transnational organised crime may be facilitated\nunder the cloak of a marriage of convenience. (c)     The\nlist of precedents tendered by the Prosecution showed that similar\noffences attracted between eight and 11 months’ imprisonment terms. (d)     The\nAppellant had initiated and facilitated the offence; in that sense,\nher role was crucial. The Appellant was therefore more culpable. (e)     Peer\nAli, the Appellant’s accomplice, had been sentenced to nine months’\nimprisonment. (f)     The\nAppellant had no antecedents.",
        "My decision": "11     While\nI could understand the approach that had been taken by the DJ, I\nconsidered that appellate intervention was warranted in this case\nbecause, having regard to all the relevant factors, it was evident\nthat the Appellant’s sentence was manifestly excessive.",
        "The relevant sentencing considerations": "12     The\nDJ essentially took into account five factors: (a)     first,\nParliament’s intentions behind and its reasons for enacting a provision\ntargeted at marriages of convenience; (b)     second,\nthe sentencing benchmark based on sentences previously imposed for\nsimilar offences; (c)     third,\nthe significance of the Appellant’s role in the commission of the\noffence; (d)     fourth,\nthe Appellant’s antecedents; and finally, (e)     the\nsentences imposed on the others involved this matter. 13     These\nfactors are undoubtedly relevant. But, in my judgment, they do not\nprovide a complete basis upon which the sentencing decision in this case\nshould be arrived at. 14     Some\nother considerations that ought to be factored into the sentencing\nframework for this offence were usefully highlighted by the English\nCourt of Appeal inRegina v MiluscaTheresitaOlivieira,\nKingsley JozueOramulu[2012]\nEWCA Crim 2279 (“Oramulu”). I am\ngrateful to Ms Mavis Chionh, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor,\nwho referred me to this authority. 15Oramuluwas a consolidated appeal brought\nagainst two separate decisions that were related in that both concerned\nthe English equivalent of a marriage of convenience. 16     In\nthe first case, Olivieira, a female Dutch national, and Oramulu,\na male Nigerian national, had carried out an elaborate plan which\nculminated in a ceremony of marriage in 2007 that provided Oramulu\nwith a lawful basis for residing in the United Kingdom. Over the\nnext three or four years, Oramulu sent payments totalling about\n£3,600 to Olivieira. In 2011, the police discovered that Oramulu\nwas living alone. While the police found no sign that Olivieira\nwas living with Oramulu, they did find a bag containing, amongst\nother things, a photocopy of Olivieira’s Dutch identity card, the couple’s\nmarriage certificate, Olivieira’s driving licence and some wedding photographs.\nThese were documents that could be used to substantiate the marriage,\nat least superficially, if the need arose. 17     The\nsecond case before the court inOramuluinvolved\na male Czech national, Cina. Over a period of 15 months, Cina recruited\nfive different Czech women and made arrangements for them to enter\ninto marriages of convenience with Nigerian men who wished to evade\nimmigration controls and acquire rights of movement, residence and\nemployment associated with marriage to a European Union (“EU”) national.\nCina’s fees for his services ranged from £4,000 to £5,000 for each\ncase. The women were promised something in the order of £2,000,\nalthough in at least two cases, Cina cheated the women, underpaying\nthem by £1,500 and £1,100. There was also evidence that whenever\nthe Czech women had second thoughts, Cina would prevail upon them\nto carry out the plan to fruition. In one instance, there was reasonably\nclear evidence of undue pressure bordering on a threat being exerted\non one of the women who was told, amongst other things, that if\nshe did not comply, she might expect trouble from some Nigerians\nwho might visit her at home. 18     Cina,\nOramulu and Olivieira were all charged with and convicted of an\noffence under s 25 of the Immigration Act 1971 (c 77) which provides that\na person commits an offence if he: (a)     does\nan act which facilitates the commission of a breach of immigration\nlaw by an individual who is not a citizen of the EU, (b)     knows\nor has reasonable cause for believing that the act facilitates the\ncommission of a breach of immigration law by the individual, and (c)     knows\nor has reasonable cause for believing that the individual is not\na citizen of the EU. 19     Oramulu\nand Olivieira were both sentenced to three and a half years’ imprisonment.\nAlthough Cina pleaded guilty – unlike Oramulu and Olivieira – he\nwas sentenced to a longer imprisonment term of five years. The question\nbefore the English Court of Appeal was whether there was any merit\nin their respective appeals against sentence. 20     Cina’s\nappeal was dismissed. Although the court noted that his sentence\nwas “significantly long”, it was nonetheless considered appropriate given,\nin particular, the fact that he had actively recruited the women\nto participate in his criminal enterprise; and had not only exerted\npressure on them but had also exploited them. Consideration was\nalso given to the fact that he ran a sophisticated operation and\ncarried out multiple transactions; and the entirety of his enterprise\nwas driven by the pursuit of profit. 21     Oramulu\nand Olivieira, on the other hand, had their imprisonment sentence\nreduced to thirty months. The court noted that theirs was a single transaction\nwhich was not part of a commercial operation; and although the marriage\nwas not motivated by family loyalty, friendship or other non-commercial\nmotives, and had been done for money alone, there was no element\nof exploitation by either party. Oramulu and Olivieira’s offence thus\nfell within the normal sentencing range for such offences which\nwas 18 months’ to three years’ imprisonment. 22     It\nshould also be noted that the court was alive to the evolution of\nthe legislation proscribing such marriages of convenience. The statutory maximum\nfor the offence had been increasedtwicein\nthe preceding years – from seven to ten years’ imprisonment in 1999,\nand then to 14 years’ imprisonment in 2003. There was no question,\naccording to the court, of the “significance which Parliament attaches\nto these offences” and sentencing must respond to this Parliamentary\nsignal.",
        "Applicable sentencing framework\nfor such offences": "23     In\nmy judgment, the factors considered by the DJ, together with the considerations\nthat figured inOramulu, reflect\nan appropriate sentencing framework that ought to apply to an offence\nunder s 57C(2) of the Act. In summary and broadly speaking, the\nfactors which are relevant for the purpose of sentencing are: (a)     the\ncircumstances of the offence; and (b)     the\nparticular role and the motivation of the offender. 24     In\nmy judgment, the relevant factors to be considered in relation to the\ncircumstances of the commission of the offence are: (a)     whether\nthe offence was committed in circumstances that reveal that active\nsteps were taken in an attempt to avoid detection of the offence;\nand (b)     whether\nthe offence was a one-off incident or part of a wider illicit commercial\noperation. 25     Relevant\nfactors to be considered in relation to the role and motivation\nof the offender are (a)     the\nspecific role played by offender; (b)     the\nspecific motive with which the offender committed the offence; (c)     whether\nthe offender had recruited accomplices to assist in the commission\nof the offence; and (d)     whether\nthe offender had pressured or exploited any of the other parties\ninvolved in the marriage of convenience. 26     Some\nof these factors are of general application while others are specific\nto the offence at hand. Aside from these, it will of course be relevant to\nhave regard to matters such as the offender’s antecedents as well\nas any other aggravating or mitigating factors. Legislative intention behind\ns 57C of the Act (1)   General principle 27     Legislative\nintention is relevant to and influences sentencing in various ways.\nAs a generally operative background factor, if Parliament has increased\nthe punishment for an offence on the basis that the mischief in question\nwas becoming more serious and needed to be arrested, as was the case\ninOramulu, the courts would not\nbe acting in concert with the legislative intent if they fail to\nhave regard to this in developing the appropriate sentencing framework\nor if they nonetheless err on the side of leniency in sentencing. 28     Legislative\nintention is also relevant in the assessment of the appropriateness\nof a sentence for an offence that has a statutorily prescribed range\nof sentences. InAngliss Singapore Pte Ltd\nv Public Prosecutor[2006] 4 SLR(R) 653, V K Rajah J\n(as he then was), when meting out a sentence that was close to the\nstatutory maximum, observed thus (at [87]): If a particular criminal provision prescribes\na maximum sentence that seems unduly light or lenient in relation\nto the potential seriousness of offences that fall under it, meting\nout a near-maximum sentence is not warranted unless it is demonstrated\nby the prosecution that that particular offence figures among the\nworst type of casesfalling within that prohibition.Thus, there must be a sense that the sentence is\nproportionate not only to the culpability of the offender but also\nin the context of the legislative scheme. [emphasis in original\nin italics; emphasis added in bold italics] 29     The\nprinciple is that the court should consider the range of conduct that\nmay be captured at either end of the sentencing range before considering\nwhere in that spectrum falls the particular conduct that is at issue\nin the case before it. In short, the culpability of the offender\ncannot be assessed in a vacuum. (2)   Relevance of legislative\nintention to the present case 30     As\nthe DJ noted in his Judgment, s 57C of the Act was enacted to specifically\ntarget marriages of convenience. Section 57C took effect on 19 December\n2012 pursuant to the Immigration (Amendment) Bill that was passed\non 13 August 2012. There was little elaboration on the overall object of\nenacting a specific provision targeting marriages of convenience.\nAll that the Second Minister for Home Affairs, Mr S Iswaran, explained\nwhen introducing the Bill during the Second Reading was that the\nnew law carried with it “stiff penalties [which] will serve as a\nstrong deterrent” (Singapore Parliamentary\nDebates, Official Report(13 August 2012) vol 89 (“Hansard”) at p 2). Reference was also\nmade to the existence of similar legislation in the United States\nand Australia. 31     In\nexpressly acknowledging that there was “no specific law against marriages\nof convenience” at that time (Hansardat\np 2), and by enacting such a law, the Second Reading speech suggests\nthat the position at law prior to the enactment of s 57C of the\nAct was deficient and needed to be addressed in order to keep up\nwith the changing immigration landscape. 32     Prior\nto the enactment of s 57C, transacting a marriage of convenience\nwas not an offenceper se, but acts\nassociated with a marriage of convenience were frequently prosecuted\nunder one of two pieces of legislation: s 5(b)(i)\nof the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, Rev Ed 1993) or s\n57(1)(k) of the Act. These two provisions\nwere generic provisions, in that they respectively targeted all\ntypes of corrupt acts and all false declarations made for the purpose\nof obtaining an immigration advantage. Punishment for corruption\nis a fine of up to $100,000 or imprisonment of up to five years\nor both. Punishment for a false declaration is a fine of up to $4,000\nor imprisonment of up to 12 months or both. 33     There\nare a number of significant differences between the old position and\nthe current position under s 57C of the Act. The current position, which\nis specifically targeted at marriages of convenience, draws a distinction\nbetween an offence committed by the parties to the marriage of convenience\nand an offence by a person who assisted in the arrangement of such\na marriage. After the enactment of s 57C, as I have already noted, parties\nto the marriage of convenience are convicted of an offence under\ns 57C(1) while persons who assisted with the arrangement of the\nmarriage of convenience are convicted of an offence under s 57C(2). 34     The\npunishment regimes are also different. Under both ss 57C(1) and (2)\nof the Act, which carry the same punishment, an offender is liable\nto a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years or\nboth. When compared to the generic offence of false declaration\nunder s 57(1)(k), the punishment\nfor entering into or otherwise arranging a marriage of convenience\nwas significantly increased in severity. In particular, the maximum\nimprisonment sentence was increased ten-fold. When compared to the\npunishment for corruption, the maximum fine is lower but the imprisonment\nterm was doubled. On the whole, there can be no doubt that the punishment\nregime applicable to these targeted offences is considerably more\nsevere than was the case when offenders were charged with the generic\noffences of making a false declaration or of corruption. This is unsurprising\nand coheres with the stated legislative objective of creating a strong\ndeterrent against transacting marriages of convenience. 35     Thus,\nit can safely be concluded that Parliament had intended, through\nthe enactment of s 57C of the Act and the enhanced punishment that\nwas provided for under that section, to signal that marriages of convenience\nhad become a sufficiently pressing issue that needed direct attention\nand deterrence through a targeted regime. Circumstances of the commission\nof the offence 36     In\nthe analysis that follows, I address only the offence of assisting\nin the arrangement of a marriage of convenience, that is, an offence\nunder s 57C(2) of the Act. (1)   Attempting to prevent\ndetection of the offence 37     An\noffence committed in circumstances which were designed to prevent\ndetection is a well-established aggravating factor. It has particular significance\nin the context of s 57C(2) of the Act because of the deliberate legislative\nintention behind enacting a targeted provision in the Act to deal with\nmarriages of convenience. 38     If\nthe arranger has taken active steps to prevent the detection of\nthe offence or has put in place measures designed to deceive an\ninquisitive third party into thinking that the marriage is legitimate,\nthat could be an aggravating factor that warrants a more severe\nsentence. 39     This\nis a function of the amount of planning that has gone into the commission\nof the offence (seePublic Prosecutor v Fernando\nPayagalaWadugeMalitha Kumar[2007] 2 SLR(R) 334 at [42]).\nHowever, it is important to recognise that evidence of planning,\non its own, does not always justify a harsher sentence. 40     Rather,\nplanning is typically considered an aggravating factor when it points\nto the existence of aconsideredintention\nto perpetrate the offence which in turn justifies a harsher sentence.\nIntention, in the context of sentencing, is important. At one end\nof the spectrum are offences which have been planned with deliberation;\non the other end are those which are the result of a “spur of the\nmoment” decision (see Andrew Ashworth,Sentencing\nand Criminal Justice(Cambridge University Press, 5th\nEd, 2010) (“Sentencing and Criminal Justice”)\nat p 148). 41     The\nlaw generally imposes a more severe punishment on an offender who\nhas planned the commission of the offence with great deliberation than\none who has committed the offence on a spur of the moment because the\nformer is deemed to possess a greater commitment to the criminal enterprise\nthan the latter. As Professor Andrew Ashworth explains inSentencing and Criminal Justiceat p 164: A person who plans a crime is generally\nmore culpable, because the offence is premeditated and the offender\nis therefore more fully confirmed in his criminal motivation than\nsomeone who acts on impulse, since he is more considered in his\nlawbreaking… 42     However,\nit bears noting that premeditation and planning are actually two\ndistinct concepts even though they overlap; a premeditated offence need\nnot have very much planning but a planned offence is usually premeditated. 43     This\ndistinction is an important one because it brings out the point that\nin some instances, evidence of planning, though indicative of premeditation,\nmight not in itself justify a harsher sentence. To take the example\nat hand, it is inherent in the offence of arranging a marriage of convenience\nthat there will have been some degree of premeditation. It will generally\nnot be an offence that happens on the spur of the moment. The arranger\nmust have formed an earlier intention to arrange the marriage of convenience.\nBut where active steps have been taken to attempt to conceal the\ndetection of the marriage or a notable degree of planning has gone\ninto the offence, it suggests that the criminal intent is more directed\nand the commitment to the offence greater and this is what calls\nfor a harsher sentence. (2)   Single incident or\nan illicit commercial operation 44     There\nis a fundamental difference between an offence that is committed\nas a one-off incident and one that is part of a wider illicit commercial\noperation. 45     It\nis self-evidently the case, at least as a general proposition, that\na one-off incident of arranging a marriage of convenience is likely\nto cause less harm than one effected as part of a commercial operation.\nBy its very nature, a commercial operation is designed to bring\nabout continuity of “business”, in this context, the arranging of\nmarriages of convenience. At the very least, in contrast with an\noffender who only commits the offence as a one-off incident, the\nreach or at least the potential reach of a commercial operation\nis far greater, and consequently, far more deleterious. It is this consequence\nthat needs to be especially punished and deterred and which therefore\njustifies a harsher sentence. Role and motivation of the arranger 46     The\nfactors relating to the role and motivation of an arranger are relevant\nto his culpability. The importance of each individual factor, and the\ninterplay between factors, will vary from case to case. Notwithstanding the\npotential variation, there are some general principles that ought\nto apply in every case. (1)   The specific role\nplayed by the offender 47     It\nis self-evident that the particular role played by the offender\nwill be relevant to his culpability. At one end of the spectrum,\nthe offender may be the mastermind or moving force of a major illicit\ncommercial enterprise. At the other end, the offender may have been\nacting under extreme pressure or have played a purely ancillary\nrole. 48     This\nwill be a fact-specific inquiry but as a general principle, the\nmore important and intensive the role of the arranger is, and the\ngreater the scale of the enterprise is, the more severe the punishment\nshould be. (2)   The offender’s profit\nmotivation 49     It\nis not a requirement of the offence that the arranger must profit from\narranging the marriage of convenience. The key element is simply\nthat there must be assistance in arranging a marriage of convenience,\nknowing that the marriage is to enable one of the parties to the\nmarriage to obtain an immigration advantage. This is unlike the\nposition in relation to the offence of entering into a marriage\nof convenience under s 57C(1) of the Act, where financial gratification\nis a necessary element of the offence. 50     Offenders\nmay commit such offences driven by various considerations including,\nfor instance, a misguided desire to assist a friend or relative\nas was noted inOramulu(at [22]).\nAlthough the absence of a dishonourable motivation is not a mitigating\nfactor, its presence would be an aggravating factor. Indeed, the\nlack of a profit motive would tend to militate against the likelihood\nof the offence being repeated. 51     For\nthis reason, there is enhanced culpability where the arranger is motivated\nby any form of financial gain or benefit, and this should be accompanied\nwith a harsher sentence. As a general proposition, the greater the\nreward received, the greater the punishment ought to be. 52     In\naddition, where there is an element of financial reward, a fine should\nbe imposed in addition to any term of imprisonment. InPoh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor[2014]\nSGHC 186, in relation to vice offences, I observed (at [102]) that\nfines should be imposed in such cases to annul or negate any financial\nadvantage that might have been obtained through the commission of\nthe offence. (3)   Recruiting other\naccomplices 53     There\nare a number of ways in which accomplices may be recruited by an\narranger. For instance, a “spouse” may be recruited to transact\nthe marriage of convenience, which was what happened in the second\nof the two cases inOramulu, where\nCina had recruited the Czech women to be the spouses in the marriage\nof convenience. In this situation, the arranger’s recruitment of\nthe “spouse” should not be an aggravating factor because the procurement\nof a “spouse” is a key element of brokering a marriage of convenience. 54     However,\nany other form of recruitment beyond recruiting the “spouse” could\nwell be an aggravating factor. Thus, it would be an aggravating\nfactor if the arranger recruits others to procure the “spouse” or to\nprovide assistance on other operational aspects of the criminal endeavour. 55     In\ngeneral, an arranger who has recruited more people to participate in\nthe criminal enterprise should be given a harsher sentence than\none who has not done so or who has extended the involvement of others\nto a lesser degree. (4)   Exploitation 56     Exploitation\nand the application of pressure are, without doubt, aggravating\nfactors. Indeed, as a general point, I would regard these as seriously\naggravating factors that would warrant a significantly longer term of\nimprisonment 57     The\nmanifest disregard of the rights and interests of others for the\nsole purpose of benefiting oneself is an aggravating factor because\nit accentuates and builds on the primary criminal conduct, in this\ncase, the arranging the marriage of convenience. In such circumstances,\nthere will almost always be a monetary inducement that drives the\ncommission of the offence. The additional harm inflicted by the\narranger on others to increase his own gain warrants a stiffer sentence. Crossing the custodial threshold 58     There\nis a wide range of permissible punishments for this offence beginning\nwith a fine and extending to a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years.\nThe custodial threshold will generally be crossed where any of the factors\nlisted above are present, namely: (a)     if\nactive steps were taken to conceal the offence; (b)     if\nthe offender played a major role in the commission of the offence\nas opposed to a minor or merely ancillary role; (c)     if\nthe offence was committed as part of a commercial enterprise that\nwas active in the commission of such crimes as opposed to being a\none-off incident; (d)     if\nthe offender was motivated by profit, in which case a fine should\nadditionally be imposed; (e)     if\nthe offender has recruited others (beside the “spouse”) in the course\nof committing the offence; and (f)     if\nthere has been any exploitation or pressure applied to any of the\nparticipants involved in the commission of the offence. 59     Each\nof these factors may vary in severity but on the face of it, I would regard\nitems (c) and (f) above as seriously aggravating considerations\nthat in themselves may warrant a significantly longer term of imprisonment.",
        "Application of the sentencing\nconsiderations to the Appellant": "60     I\nhave outlined six aggravating factors that are relevant to the offence of\narranging or assisting in the arrangement of a marriage of convenience.\nI reiterate that these are non-exhaustive and further, that it goes\nwithout saying that all the circumstances of the case will have\nto be balanced. 61     In\nthis case, I note that there were no factors agitating for an unusually\nstiff sentence. This was a one-off incident committed to facilitate a\nsibling’s desire to help a friend. The Appellant’s mode of arrangement\nwas basic. It is true that she initiated the idea of securing a\nmarriage of convenience, approached Peer Ali and finally brought\nGagandeep to the solemnisation venue. But none of this detracted\nfrom the fact that she was essentially following through on a scheme\nto help her brother’s friend. More importantly these factors went\nto the question of her role in this incident, to which I now turn. 62     I\nhad no difficulty accepting as a matter of principle, the DJ’s finding that\nthe Appellant’s role was significant. 63     The\nquestion, having regard to the whole range of sentencing options available,\nwas what would be the appropriate sentence to reflect the Appellant’s\noverall level of culpability? In my judgment the aggravating considerations\nin this case were the following: (a)     The\nAppellant initiated and suggested that Gagandeep enter into a marriage\nof convenience. She was initially approached for help in securing\na job for him but she opted for a wholly unwise and illegal course\n(see [58(b)] above); and (b)     She\nrecruited Peer Ali and paid him a considerable sum knowing that\nhe would involve another person, who as it eventually turned out\nwas the “spouse”, Norhayati (see [58(e)] above). 64     As\nagainst this, there appears to have been no exploitation of any\nof the parties. Moreover, as I have noted, this was a one-off incident\nand the offence was committed by the Appellant at least, not for\nany gain but in an ill-conceived attempt to accede to her brother’s\nrequest for assistance. 65     In\nthe circumstances, the aggravating factors present were sufficient to\ncross the threshold warranting a custodial sentence. However, I\ndid not think that the circumstances were so exceptional as to call\nfor the imposition of a sentence longer than six months, having\nregard to the fact that the range extended to a term of imprisonment\nof up to 10 years. Mitigating factors 66     It\nwould have been apparent from the above that there were no relevant\nmitigating factors that operated in favour of the Appellant. The Appellant’s\ncounsel, Mr S K Kumar, submitted that the medical report obtained\nby the Appellant showed that she suffered from depression, and that\nshe had only agreed to arrange the marriage of convenience because she\nfelt obliged to assist her brother. 67     In\nmy judgment there was no merit in this at all. In the first place,\nthe medical report read more like a fact-finding report than a professional medical\nopinion. The portion dealing with the Appellant’s supposed medical\ncondition was much briefer than the lengthy portion where the doctor\nset out the background facts, seemingly in an attempt to give the reader\nof the report a detailed account of what factually transpired in\nterms that were exceedingly favourable to the Appellant. 68     Moreover,\nnot only was the report patently lacking in objectivity, it was\nplainly erroneous in stating that the Appellant had been “used in\na marriage for visa scam without her knowledge.” This was simply\nincorrect. The Appellant knew what she was doing. Either the doctor\nwas told of the wrong facts and had not bothered to check them even\ncursorily or he had misunderstood the facts. On either basis it\nmilitated against any weight being given to the medical report.\nI digress to repeat the observation that experts owe their duty\nfirst and foremost to the court and not to the client who pays their\nfee. The doctor in this case did himself no credit because he did\nnot give me the sense that he had even a basic conception of the responsibility\nhe owed the court when he put himself forward as an expert. 69     Moreover,\nthe report concluded that depression set in on the Appellant “after\nher arrest”. In so far as the medical report was tendered for the\npurposes of mitigation, I did not see how any depression after the offence\ncould mitigate the Appellant’s culpability. As I pointed out to\nMr Kumar in the course of arguments, many offenders who have been apprehended\nand face the prospect of a term of imprisonment for breaking the\nlaw may feel depressed. This cannot possibly be a mitigating consideration. Sentencing precedents 70     For\ncompleteness, I should comment on the sentencing precedents briefly\nbecause the DJ placed considerable reliance on the sentence of nine months’\nimprisonment that was imposed on Peer Ali as well as the other sentencing\nprecedents provided by the Prosecution. 71     As\nregards Peer Ali, although he was party to the same transaction\nas the Appellant, the principle of parity of sentencing ought not\nto be applied blindly, without regard to the degree of culpability\nof each individual offender in committing the offending acts. I\nemphasised this recently inPublic Prosecutor\nv Marzuki bin Ahmad and another appeal[2014] SGHC 166\nat [45]. 72     To\nthe extent that Ms Chionh pressed me to apply the principle of parity\nin this case, I disagreed that this was appropriate in the present circumstances.\nWhat distinguished Peer Ali from the Appellant was that Peer Ali’s\nparticipation in the criminal endeavour was driven purely by monetary\ngain which, at least relative to the Appellant’s motivation, reflected\na greater degree of culpability. As mentioned above at [51] to [52], a\nharsher sentence is warranted where monetary profit is the motivation\nfor the offence. 73     As\nfor the other sentencing precedents, it is important to divide them into\ntwo groups. The first group comprises cases decided prior to the enactment\nof s 57C of the Act. In the light of the differences between the regime\nthen and the regime now under s 57C (see [32]–[35] above), it goes without\nsaying that the sentencing precedents under the old regime cannot be\nof assistance. 74     As\nto the second group of cases, namely, those prosecuted under s 57C(2)\nof the Act, aside from the case involving Peer Ali, there were six others\nin the list of precedents included in Ms Chionh’s written submissions.\nOf the six, the arrangers in four were sentenced to nine months’\nimprisonment and the remaining two to 10 months’ imprisonment. 75     I\nnote that the four arrangers sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment\nhad profited from the endeavour while the two arrangers sentenced\nto 10 months’ imprisonment do not appear from the Statement of Facts\nto have so profited. However, as the decisions in the latter two\ncases are unreported, and no judgment of the district court is available,\nit would be inappropriate for me to rely on the decisions in those\ncases. 76     The\nonly case amongst the six that is reported isPublic\nProsecutor v Tay SzuKhee[2014]\nSGDC 52 where the arranger was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment.\nThere, the arranger who recruited one other person (aside from the\n“spouse”) was involved in the operational aspects of the arrangement\nand made a profit of $2,000 from his crime. In my view, applying\nthe sentencing considerations that I have set out above, the fact that\nthe offender in that case committed the offence solely for profit distinguished\nthat case from the present.",
        "Conclusion": "77     For\nthese reasons, I allowed the appeal and set aside the DJ’s sentence of\neight months’ imprisonment in favour of a term of imprisonment of\nsix months."
