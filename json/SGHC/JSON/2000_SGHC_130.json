        "The judicial management regime": "7. The judicial management regime was\n\nintroduced into the law of Singapore via the enactment of the Companies (Amendment) Act\n\n1987. As commentators have observed (seeCompany Law[2ndEd] by Walter\n\nWoon andJudicial Management in Singaporeby Choong and Rajah), the aim of the\n\nlegislation was to introduce a breathing space for companies in financial difficulty.\n\nUnder the pre-existing law, such companies could not prevent their creditors from\n\nappointing receivers or commencing winding up proceedings. This meant that even companies\n\nwhich had substantial assets could be wound up because they were not liquid and could not\n\npay their debts as they fell due. Under the new regime, once a judicial manager is\n\nappointed, there is a moratorium on enforcement action by creditors and this moratorium\n\nperiod is intended to be used to find a way to save the company without having to\n\nliquidate it. The judicial management situation is, however, not intended to be permanent.\n\nThe initial order is made for a period of six months only and whilst this can be extended,\n\nthe intention is that if the company cannot be saved within a reasonable time, the\n\njudicial management will end and creditors will be allowed to wind it up or take other\n\naction to enforce recovery of their debts.8. The essential protection received by a\n\ncompany in judicial management is that civil proceedings may not be commenced against it,\n\nexisting actions are stayed, execution processes may not be carried out and the company\n\nmay not be wound up: see s 227D Companies Act (Cap 50) (‘the Act’). Upon the\n\njudicial management order being made, the board of directors is deprived of its ability to\n\nrun the company and its powers and functions are transferred to the judicial managers (s\n\n227G). They are then entitled to do all such things as may be necessary for the management\n\nof the affairs, business and property of the company and to do all other such things as\n\nthe court may by order sanction.9. Among the powers granted to the\n\njudicial managers by the Act is the power to dispose of any property of the company which\n\nis subject to a security as if the property were not subject to the security. The relevant\n\nsection is s 227H. In the case of property which is subject to a mortgage or a fixed\n\ncharge (as is the case here), however, the judicial manager can only dispose of the same\n\nwith the leave of court. Sub-section (5) of s 227H specifically provides that it shall be\n\na condition of an order made for the sale of such a property that the net proceeds of sale\n\nshall be applied towards ‘discharging the sums secured by the security’ and\n\nwhere the net proceeds of the sale are less than the sums secured by the security, the\n\nholder of the security may prove on a winding up for any balance due to him.10. It is notable that whilst the Act\n\ncontemplates that there may be situations in which it would be in the interest of the\n\ncompany in judicial management that its property should be sold although the same is\n\nsubject to a security, the Act is at pains to protect the interests of the secured\n\ncreditor. It does this by providing for the net proceeds of sale to be paid to that\n\ncreditor to discharge the company’s obligation to it in priority to any other\n\napplication of the funds. The phrase used in the relevant sub-section to refer to the\n\ncompany’s indebtedness to the secured creditor is, as pointed out above, ‘the\n\nsums secured by the security’. Practically the same expression appears in s 15 (5) of\n\nthe English Insolvency Act 1986 which gives an administrator of a company (the English\n\nequivalent of a judicial manager) a similar power to sell assets subject to a security.\n\nThis phrase was commented on by Knox J inRe ARV Aviation Ltd[1988] 4 BCC 710 at p\n\n713 in the following terms:‘In my judgment, the expression\n\n  ‘the sum secured by the security’ covers not only the capital sum secured by the\n\n  security but all interest properly payable thereunder and any costs which the proprietor\n\n  of the security is entitled to add to his security in accordance with the general law and\n\n  the terms of the instrument in question. Anything less than that would, in seems to me, be\n\n  an interference which I would not lightly expect Parliament to wish to make with the\n\n  rights of such secured creditors.’I entirely agree with his Lordship’s\n\nobservations and consider that they apply equally to the expression as it appears in s\n\n227H of the Act.11. The Act does not specify the\n\ncircumstances in which a mortgaged property belonging to a company under judicial\n\nmanagement may be redeemed. The situation is covered generally by s 227G (6) which states\n\nthat the judicial manager cannot make any payment towards discharging any debt to which\n\nthe company was subject on the making of the judicial management order unless, inter alia,\n\nthe making of the payment is authorised by the court. No guidance is given to the court by\n\nsub-section as to when and on what terms the redemption should be permitted and the\n\ndecision on giving the requisite sanction is left entirely in the discretion of the court.\n\nIt is not a situation with which a court is often faced since companies under judicial\n\nmanagement are rarely in a financial position to redeem properties which they have\n\nmortgaged as security for their indebtedness.12. It appeared to me that in any event\n\nthe secured creditor could not be placed in a worse position by the judicial\n\nmanager’s application for sanction to redeem the security than it would be placed in\n\nby the judicial manager’s application for sanction to sell the property. That would\n\nhave been exactly the result if I had accepted the judicial managers’ proposition\n\nthat for the purposes of redemption of the mortgage, the contractually agreed interest had\n\nceased to accrue on the date of the judicial management order. It would be a startling\n\nresult if a regime that was intended to afford a company a breathing space in which to\n\nre-organise its affairs could, despite the absence of any specific legislative provision\n\nto that effect, allow it to escape from the contractual obligation to pay interest\n\nembodied in a mortgage document. That would be an interference with the established rights\n\nof creditors that can only be accomplished by express legislative action. It should be\n\nnoted that the judicial managers did not dispute that the mortgage instrument which the\n\ncompany had executed provided for the security so granted to the bank to cover all\n\ninterest payable on the facilities extended by the bank.",
        "The judicial managers’ arguments": "13. The judicial managers argued that\n\nbased on Rules 41, 44 and 50 of the Companies Regulations (Cap 50) (‘the\n\nRegulations’) which deal with proof of debts in judicial management and by drawing an\n\nanalogy in respect of payments under proof of debts for company in liquidation, a creditor\n\nis only entitled to compute interest up to the date of the judicial management order. They\n\npointed out that under r 41, in a judicial management, every creditor was obliged to prove\n\nhis debt. Such proof had, pursuant to r 44(1), to be in compliance with Form 77 in the\n\nSecond Schedule to the Regulations. That form provides for the amount of the debt to be\n\ncalculated as of the date of the commencement of the judicial management. The judicial\n\nmanagers contended that since Form 77 did not provide for proof of interest after the\n\ncommencement of the judicial management, the bank was not entitled to make any claim for\n\ninterest accruing after that date.14. I considered the above argument to be\n\nmisconceived. It was muddling the creditor’s right to charge and recover interest\n\nwith its right to be involved in the judicial management. As counsel for the bank\n\nsubmitted, the purpose of requiring each creditor to file a proof of debt in a judicial\n\nmanagement is to enable the judicial manager to determine each creditor’s entitlement\n\nto participate in the scheme of judicial management and the value of voting rights in this\n\nparticipation. As Choong and Rajah state (at p 132):‘The importance in lodging a proof\n\n  cannot be overstated. The acceptance of the proof by the judicial manager is a condition\n\n  precedent to a creditor’s participation in the scheme of judicial management. Only\n\n  creditors whose claims have been accepted by the judicial manager may vote on whether to\n\n  approve the judicial manager’s proposals.’The proof of debt in a judicial management\n\ndoes not crystallise the liabilities of the company vis--vis its creditors for the\n\npurposes of repayment of debt unlike in a liquidation situation. The fact that Form 77\n\nonly calls for the calculation of interest up to the date of the judicial management order\n\ndoes not mean that interest on a secured debt would cease to accrue. What it means is that\n\nfor the purposes of determining the amount of the secured creditors’ debt and in turn\n\nhis voting rights in the judicial management, an artificial line is drawn on the date of\n\nthe order and indebtedness accruing after that date is not counted.15. Next, the judicial managers relied on\n\nr 50 of the Regulations. This reads:‘On any debt or sum, payable at a\n\n  certain time or otherwise whereon interest is not reserved or agreed for, and which is\n\n  overdue at the date of the judicial management order, the creditor may prove for interest\n\n  at a rate not exceeding 6% per annum to that date from the time when the debt or sum was\n\n  payable, if the debt or sum is payable by virtue of a written instrument at a certain\n\n  time, and if payable otherwise, then from the time when a demand in writing has been made,\n\n  giving notice that interest will be claimed from the date of the demand until the time of\n\n  payment.’They argued that if in a case where\n\ninterest had not been agreed upon, interest would only be calculated up to the date of\n\njudicial management order then in a case, as here, where interest had been agreed upon,\n\nthere would be no reason for such a debt to be treated differently and the interest to be\n\ncalculated beyond the date of the judicial management order.16. I could not accept the interpretation\n\nwhich the judicial managers gave to r 50. In my judgment, it has no effect at all on the\n\nperiod during which interest which had been the subject of a contractual agreement would\n\ncontinue to accrue. It appeared to me that r 50 was designed to allow creditors who had no\n\nprevious contractual arrangements with the company on interest to include an interest\n\ncomponent in their proofs in order to increase their voting rights. The Rule embodies the\n\nrecognition that if such creditors (usually trade creditors) were to start legal\n\nproceedings against the company and recover judgment for their debts they would, in all\n\nprobability, be awarded interest by the court. These creditors had, however, been\n\nprohibited from taking such action by the passing of the judicial management order and\n\nthus the passing of the Rule was, I considered, a way of putting these creditors,\n\nnotionally, in the situation in which they would have been had the order not been made. It\n\nwould also help such creditors have a greater say in the judicial management scheme\n\nvis--vis the secured creditors with contractually agreed interest arrangements who would\n\notherwise have greater voting rights simply by reason of the accrual of interest up the\n\ndate of the order even though the principal sum owing to them was equal or less than that\n\nowing to the trade creditor.17. Whilst it is always possible for the\n\nlegislature to abrogate contractual arrangements on interest, this must be done expressly.\n\nIt cannot be done in the convoluted fashion which judicial managers put forward ie that\n\nthe effect of expressly giving people who are not contractually entitled to interest a\n\nright to prove for interest at a particular rate up to the date of the judicial management\n\norder, is implicitly to deprive people who have such contractual rights to interest from\n\nenjoying those rights after the date of the order.18. The next argument put forward by the\n\njudicial managers relied on the fact that in the liquidation of a company, all interest\n\nwould cease to run as of the date of the winding up order. They submitted that the same\n\nrule should apply to the judicial management situation. I am afraid that I could not\n\nfollow their argument on this point at all. Liquidation and judicial management are two\n\nentirely distinct regimes with distinct legal consequences. There is absolutely no logical\n\nreason why simply because interest ceases to run against the company in liquidation it\n\nshould also cease to run against the company in judicial management. It is also not\n\ncorrect that interest ceases to run under all circumstances when the company is put into\n\nliquidation. A secured creditor is entitled to contractual interest up to the date of the\n\nliquidation of his security notwithstanding the prior winding up of the debtor company.\n\nSeeSecuritibank Ltd[1980] 1 NZL 714. It is only when the creditor is unsecured or\n\nwishes to surrender his security and prove in the liquidation as an unsecured creditor\n\nthat he is subject to the limitations on interest provided by the liquidation regime.Conclusion19. I could not find a legal or a logical\n\nbasis which justified the judicial managers’ application to stop interest on the\n\nmortgage running from the date of their appointment. The judicial managers were the agents\n\nof the company (see s 227(1)(a)) and their powers could not exceed that of their\n\nprincipal. Under the contract, the company could not redeem the mortgage except by paying\n\nall interest which had accrued up to the date of redemption. The judicial managers, as\n\nagents, could not be in a better position than their principal was. I was surprised by the\n\napplication. I am astonished by their appeal. It is wrong to use the assets of a company\n\nwhich is already in financial difficulty to pursue unsustainable legal proceedings.Judith PrakashJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
