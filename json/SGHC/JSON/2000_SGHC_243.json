        "The decision": "21. Having heard the testimony in September 2000 over three (3) days\n\nfrom Low, the second plaintiff, Kevin Ng, Angela and the second plaintiff's Indonesian\n\nlawyer (who drew up the sub-sale agreement), I had no hesitation in coming to the\n\nconclusion that there was an agreement between the parties, as reflected in the fax dated\n\n22 February 2000, that the defendants had repudiated the agreement and the plaintiffs were\n\nentitled to claim damages for such breach of contract. Accordingly I awarded judgment to\n\nthe plaintiffs in the sums of $91,200 (for the deposit they had paid) and $106,400 (for\n\nloss of profits on the aborted sub-sale to Rosemeri). The defendants have now appealed\n\nagainst my decision (in Civil Appeal No. 128 of 2000).The evidence(i) the plaintiffs' case22. The plaintiffs' case has essentially been set out in paras 2 to 15\n\nabove. As stated earlier, the second plaintiff testified for the plaintiffs and his\n\ntestimony where Low (PW1) was involved, was corroborated by the latter, in particular\n\nparas 2, 3, 5, 6 and 13.23. As for the sub-sale agreement, the plaintiffs called Bertomeno\n\nEdward Simanjuntak (Simanjuntak) from the Jakarta law firm Bernard & Associates to\n\ntestify that he had drafted the sub-sale agreement and that the same was executed in his\n\noffice by the second plaintiff and Rosemeri on the morning of 23 February 2000. As he was\n\nnot cross-examined, Simanjuntak's (PW3) evidence stood unchallenged.24. The undisputed evidence adduced in court including the following\n\nevents/facts:-(i) Low and Kevin Ng were told by the second plaintiff that the\n\n  plaintiffs needed 2 units of Mercedes 'S' cars urgently for purposes of resale;(ii) the defendants had given the quotation (see 1AB2) for 1 unit each\n\n  of the black and silver cars the plaintiffs wanted, to the second plaintiff because the\n\n  cars had landed in Singapore;(iii) the second plaintiff and Rony were supposed to inspect (finally\n\n  on 21 February 2000) the 3 Mercedes cars which the defendants had available for sale in\n\n  lieu of the black and silver units in (ii) above which had been sold to third parties. As\n\n  proof of this intended inspection, the PSA pass issued to Rony was produced as part of the\n\n  agreed documents (1AB4);(iv) the pro forma invoice was not signed by either party;(v) Angela testified that on Kevin Ng's instructions, she obtained on\n\n  22 February 2000 on the plaintiffs' behalf the quotation in 1AB10 for the freight payable\n\n  for shipment of 2 units of Mercedes to Jakarta;(vi) the exact same specifications of the substitute black cars meant\n\n  for the plaintiffs spelt out in the fax signed, stamped and dated by Kevin Ng on 22\n\n  February 2000 appeared in the subsale agreement under para 2 of Article 1 (see 1AB18).A question which would come to any person's mind, looking at the\n\nsequence of events and (iii) and (v) in particular is, why would the plaintiffs be invited\n\nto view the defendants' stock of cars, which fact Kevin Ng admitted (N/E52)? Inspection\n\nwould be unnecessary if the cars were to be sold to the plaintiffs on an indent basis. Why\n\nwould the second plaintiff need to ascertain the freight to Indonesia unless he ordered\n\nthe 2 cars on a ready basis and he required to know the landed cost (in Jakarta) of the\n\ncars before he on-sold them to his own customer?. No explanation was proffered by the\n\ndefendants or their counsel. Obtaining the cars on an indent basis would surely defeat the\n\nplaintiffs' purpose of securing them urgently in order to resell.25. My finding that the plaintiffs ordered and the defendants agreed to\n\nsell, 2 units of Mercedes on a ready basis is reinforced by the following testimony:-a. the second plaintiff had testified that if indeed he had purchased\n\n  from the defendants on an indent basis, he would have paid a lower price for the cars and\n\n  he could have chosen the colours as well as the options instead of accepting whatever\n\n  accessories the defendants then had available;b. in his written testimony, Low had stated that when he obtained\n\n  quotations for the 'S' series from suppliers (including the defendants) for the second\n\n  plaintiff when first contacted, the price for 'indent' orders was $135,000- $140,000\n\n  whereas for 'ready' orders, the price was about $150,000; the plaintiffs paid $152,000 for\n\n  each car;c. the second plaintiff had also deposed that he had purchased\n\n  accessories worth $16,000 from the defendants as reflected in the defendants' invoice at\n\n  1AB7;d. Kevin Ng had admitted (N/E53) the second plaintiff had told him the\n\n  plaintiffs needed 2 Mercedes because they had a ready buyer in Indonesia.26. If Kevin Ng's contention that he agreed to sell 1 black and 1\n\nsilver Mercedes 320 to the plaintiffs on an indent basis is to be believed, why did he\n\nhave to write the wordsDel time 7 dayson the fax? All that he needed to do was to\n\ninstruct Angela to prepare an invoice for the plaintiffs' indent order on the following\n\nday setting out all the options/accessories the second plaintiff had selected together\n\nwith the terms of delivery and payment. In this regard the testimony of the second\n\nplaintiff (N/E26) should also be borne in mind -- he did ask for an invoice (in order to\n\ncommit the defendants) but Kevin Ng could not oblige as Angela had left the office; Kevin\n\nNg's signature and the defendants' rubber stamp on the fax was the best alternative to a\n\nproper invoice which Kevin Ng promised him the following day. As the second plaintiff said\n\n(N/E25), by 22 February 2000, the defendants had already collected 30% payment from the\n\nplaintiffs, the issue was, what could the defendants give to the plaintiffs on an urgent\n\nbasis in lieu of the cars in the pro forma invoice which had been sold? The second\n\nplaintiff said the plaintiffs did not have much of a choice at the time.27. I should also point out that the pro forma invoice did not state a\n\ndelivery date; neither did the quotation which was only valid for 2 days, notwithstanding\n\nthat the former related to cars which were on the way to Singapore while the latter\n\nreferred to cars which had landed in Singapore. Hence, the 2 documents were not helpful at\n\nall in distinguishing an indent from a ready sale. However, if it were not for the urgency\n\nof the matter, why was there a necessity for the second plaintiff and Rony to wait at\n\nlength (6 hours) at the defendants' office until Kevin Ng could confirm the options that\n\ncame with the cars the plaintiffs decided to buy? It cannot be a coincidence that the\n\nplaintiffs also paid for accessories on 22 February 2000; they were meant for the cars\n\nwhich the defendants could supply. It did not make any sense for the plaintiffs to buy\n\naccessories in advance of their indent orders when they could order options at one and the\n\nsame time as the indent orders. These factors pointed to a sale to the plaintiffs on a\n\nready and not on an, indent basis.(ii) the defendantsâ€™ case28. As against the clear testimony presented by the plaintiffs and\n\ntheir witnesses, the defendants had a befuddled witness in Kevin Ng whilst Angela's\n\ntestimony supported the plaintiffs' case in regard to the payment of the deposit and the\n\ninquiry she made of freight for shipment of the cars to Jakarta. She (DW2) further\n\nrevealed that the Mercedes cars in the pro forma invoice were eventually sold to an\n\nIndonesia buyer in early March 2000.29. On his part, Kevin Ng had testified (N/E 45) that the fax he had\n\nsigned was for cars which were ready stock in Singapore and the quotation was given to him\n\nby his partner Jams Tan very late on 22 February 2000 at the plaintiffs' request, because\n\nthey wanted to know the options for the 2 black Mercedes. He admitted that when the\n\nplaintiffs' solicitors sent their letter of demand (dated 24 February 2000) alleging there\n\nwas an oral agreement relating to 2 obsidian black Mercedes S320l, he did not deny the\n\nallegation as heleft it to his lawyers to handle(N/E46). Pressed further why he\n\ndid not respond to the allegation, Kevin Ng said it was because he did not consider the\n\nfax a contract but only a quotation as the plaintiffs had not confirmed the price.\n\nMoreover, as the plaintiffs' solicitor had already made a claim against the defendants, he\n\ndecided there was no need to take the matter further. As for his failure to return the\n\ndeposit before the plaintiffs' action, Kevin Ng said it was because the plaintiffs wanted\n\nto claim more ($287,000) but admitted he never attempted to tender the sum to the\n\nplaintiffs through his solicitors. He defended his decision to sell the cars under the pro\n\nforma invoice to a third party (notwithstanding that the plaintiffs had paid him 30%\n\ndeposit) on the basis that the plaintiffs' 30% (total) payment was only received on 24\n\nFebruary 2000 when his bank advised him of their remittance. This statement was factually\n\nincorrect as the plaintiffs' TT advice from their bankers was dated 22 February 2000\n\nmeaning the sum of S$49,200 was transferred out of their account by that date and the\n\ndefendants produced the same document (see 2AB5) and no other TT advice from their own\n\nbankers, Overseas Union Bank to show the money was only received by their bank on 24\n\nFebruary 2000.30. Although I had indicated to counsel that I would only determine\n\nliability and leave the issue of damages to be assessed by the Registrar in the event the\n\nplaintiffs succeeded on their claim, I nevertheless went further to quantify the\n\nplaintiffs' damages because the figures were all before the court. It would be useful at\n\nthis juncture to set out the relevant law namely, s 51(1) and (2) of the Sale of Goods Act\n\n(the Act):-(1) Where the seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the\n\n  goods to the buyer, the buyer may maintain an action against the seller for damages for\n\n  non-delivery.(2) The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally\n\n  resulting in the ordinary course of events from the seller's breach of contract.Kevin Ng had admitted (N/E53) that not only was he told by the second\n\nplaintiff about the plaintiffs' sub-sale of the 2 units of Mercedes they purchased from\n\nthe defendants but also that the plaintiffs would suffer a loss if the cars were not\n\ndelivered to them; this was even before the plaintiffs placed their order with the\n\ndefendants.31. It would be equally useful to look at the principles enunciated inHadley\n\nv Baxendale(1854) 9 Ex 341 governing award of damages, as restated (by Asquith LJ (at\n\npp 539-540) inVictoria Laundry v (Windsor) LD v Newman Industries[1949] 2 KB 528\n\nand summarised byMcgregor on Damages(16thed p 159 para 250) as\n\nfollows:-1. It is well settled that the governing purpose of damages is to put\n\n  the party whose rights have been violated in the same position, so far as money can do so,\n\n  as if his rights had been observed. This purpose, if relentlessly pursued, would provide\n\n  him with a complete indemnity for all lossde factoresulting from a particular\n\n  breach, however improbable, however unpredictable. This, in contract at least, is\n\n  recognised as too harsh a rule; hence;2. in cases of breach of contract the aggrieved party is only entitled\n\n  to recover such part of the loss actually resulting as was at the time of the contract\n\n  reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach.3. What was at that time reasonably so foreseeable depends on the\n\n  knowledge then 'possessed' by the parties, or, at all events, by the party who later\n\n  commits the breach.4. For this purpose, knowledge 'possessed' is of two kinds; one\n\n  imputed, the other actual. Everyone, as a reasonable person, is taken to know the\n\n  'ordinary course of things' and consequently what loss is liable to result from a breach\n\n  of contract in that ordinary course. This is the subject matter of the 'first rule' inHadley\n\n  v Baxendale. But to this knowledge, which a contract breaker is assumed to possess\n\n  whether he actually possesses it or not, there may have to be added in a particular case\n\n  knowledge which he actually possesses, of special circumstances outside the 'ordinary\n\n  course of things', of such a kind that a breach in those special circumstances would be\n\n  liable to cause more loss. Such a case attracts the operation of the 'second rule' so as\n\n  to make additional loss also recoverable.5. In order to make the contract breaker liable under either rule, it\n\n  is not necessary that he should actually have asked himself what loss is liable to result\n\n  from a breach. As has often been pointed out, parties at the time of contracting\n\n  contemplate not the breach of the contract, but its performance. It suffices that, if he\n\n  had considered the question, he would as a reasonable man have concluded that the loss in\n\n  question was liable to result.6. Nor, finally, to make a particular loss recoverable, need it be\n\n  proved that upon a given state of knowledge the defendant could, as a reasonable man,\n\n  foresee that a breach must necessarily result in that loss. It is enoughâ€¦.if he could\n\n  foresee it was likely so to resultâ€¦32. Pursuant to s 51(2) of the Act and, the above rule inHadley v\n\nBaxendaleas restated inVictoria Laundry v (Windsor) LD v Newman Industries, I\n\nawarded the plaintiffs their loss of profits ($106,400) arising from the non-fulfilment of\n\nthe sub-sale agreement. I did not however award the plaintiffs the penalty of 20% of the\n\npurchase price namely $86,000 (which should be $92,000 if based on $460,000 for the 2\n\ncars) as I thought it was too remote a loss. Moreover, no evidence was produced by the\n\nplaintiffs to show that it was actually paid to their buyer Rosemeri, unlike the refund of\n\nthe 50% deposit to her.33. I had also considered whether the plaintiffs had mitigated their\n\nloss, as they were duty bound to do at law. In this regard, the plaintiffs (through their\n\nsolicitor) waited until 2 March 2000 (see 1AB54-58) before writing to other Mercedes\n\nsuppliers (3) to source for the same cars the defendants failed to supply. The second\n\nplaintiff explained (N/E30) it was because he took his solicitors' advice that the\n\nplaintiffs must mitigate their loss by 6 March 2000 if he did not hear from Kevin Ng; (the\n\ndefendants through their solicitors gave an inconclusive reply only on 7 March). I am of\n\nthe view that the lapse of 10 days from the date of the plaintiffs' solicitors' letter of\n\ndemand is not an unreasonable delay, as the plaintiffs no doubt were still hoping the\n\ndefendants would comply with their contractual obligations. In any case, the second\n\nplaintiff testified, none of the suppliers approached had ready stock, they could only\n\nprovide cars on an indent basis 2-3 weeks later.",
        "The conclusion": "34. In brief, it was clear from the documentary evidence produced in\n\ncourt that the defendants had agreed orally to supply by 29 February 2000 to the\n\nplaintiffs, 2 black Mercedes S320L inclusive of the options set out in the fax which Kevin\n\nNg signed, stamped and dated 22 February 2000. As they failed to do so and, they were made\n\naware by the second plaintiff that the plaintiffs' purchase was for purposes of re-sale,\n\nthe defendants must pay by way of damages, the plaintiffs' loss of profits as well as\n\nrefund the deposit the plaintiffs had paid. I accordingly awarded judgment to the\n\nplaintiffs on the two sums with interest at 6% per annum (from the date of the writ) and\n\ncosts to be taxed unless otherwise agreed.Lai Siu ChiuJudgeCopyright Â© Government of Singapore."
