        "Evidence adduced at trial": "4 The accused was the manager of KG Pearl, a karaoke pub at which the victim worked as a singer. On 12 July 2016, at about 2.36 am, the victim had gone into the office at KG Pearl to collect her salary as it was her last day of work there. As she was dissatisfied with the amount that was offered to her, she refused to accept the money. 5 When the victim exited the office, she picked up balls from a pool table and threw them around in an apparent tantrum. There was some dispute as to where these balls landed, and whether any danger arose from this. While the victim testified that she had thrown the balls onto the floor, the accused testified that he had seen one of the balls hit “Ben Ge”. “Ben Ge” was also referred to as “Ping Ge” during the trial. 6 The events that followed thereafter were also disputed even though there was CCTV footage of most, but not all, of the relevant events in the pub. 7 According to the victim, the accused then pointed at her and asked whether she believed he would hit her. He went towards her, grabbed her hand, and pushed her towards the wall before grabbing her neck with his right hand. He then changed hands, used his left hand to grab her neck, and slapped her with “very great force” on the left side of her face and left ear with his right hand. The accused also told her to stop throwing tantrums. The victim was very agitated and wanted to retaliate. 8 The Prosecution’s case was that the accused continued to advance towards the victim when she moved away, pointing his finger at her aggressively before grabbing her neck again. The victim pushed him away immediately, but the accused lunged forward and swung his hand at the victim’s face, hitting her on the left cheek. Subsequently, the victim fell to the floor and threw a pool ball at the accused, which missed him. Despite being restrained by others, the accused continued to advance towards the victim. 9 On the other hand, the accused stated that he approached the victim in an attempt to stop her from throwing more pool balls around. He did this by grabbing her wrists and telling her to cool down and go into the singers’ room. The victim struggled and attempted to kick the accused, who dodged the kick. As the victim attempted to move towards the pool table again, the accused used his right hand to push her chest area, below her neck, and used his left hand to grab the victim’s shoulder. By doing so, the accused managed to push the victim towards the wall. He did this because he did not want the victim to be within reach of the pool table. The victim then kicked the accused, who released her. 10 The accused’s case was that while other singers tried to intervene, the victim continued to be aggressive, pushing him away twice. He pushed her as well, in an attempt to push her towards the singers’ room and wake her up from her “alcohol-induced delirium”. His right hand then came into contact with the victim’s left cheek with “not that great” force as the victim had moved away. The victim then attempted to retaliate, but missed and fell to the floor. She then threw a pool ball towards the accused. 11 It was not disputed that an altercation between “Ping Ge”, his friend, and the victim followed. During this altercation, the victim hit her head against a pillar at KG Pearl. 12 The victim later realised that there was discomfort in her ear and that her hearing in her left ear had become poorer than her right. On medical examination, she was found to have sustained: (a) A left anterior central tympanic membrane perforation that was about 50% in size, (b) Multiple scratch marks over her bilateral upper limb, (c) Minimal swelling over the dorsum of the lateral side of the right wrist, (d) Circular abrasion over her right anterior knee, and (e) Redness over the anterior distal neck. 13 The victim had no other visible facial injuries. The hearing test conducted on her showed that she suffered mild conductive hearing loss. Two days’ medical leave was given. 14 On 15 July 2016, the victim was examined again. By this time, she had developed left ear tinnitus and dizziness with nausea. When her condition was reviewed on 30 September 2016, the eardrum perforation was marginally smaller than it was initially. A pure tone audiogram showed mild to moderate conductive hearing loss. On 6 December 2016, the victim underwent a left onlay tympanoplasty to close the eardrum perforation. However, she continued to suffer from mild conductive hearing loss in her left ear, together with persistent left sided tinnitus. Dr Ho Eu Chin (“Dr Ho”) stated that the only effective treatment available for these conditions would be a hearing aid.",
        "Decision below": "15 The Magistrate convicted the accused and found that he had caused the victim to sustain, amongst other injuries, a left anterior central tympanic membrane (or eardrum) perforation that was about 50% in size with mild conductive hearing loss (GD at [6]). 16 In reaching this conclusion, the Magistrate preferred the victim’s account. He found her evidence to be cogent, consistent, precise and corroborated in the material aspects by the medical evidence as well as the First Information Report (“FIR”). The Magistrate also set out a detailed description of the events captured by the CCTV footage at [12] of his GD, and concluded that the victim’s evidence was substantially consistent with the CCTV footage, even if some ancillary and non-material details might have been forgotten over time (GD at [41]–[42]). This substantial consistency was demonstrated by the Magistrate’s comparison of the accounts of the victim, the accused and the CCTV footage at [44] of the GD. 17 On the other hand, the Magistrate found that the accused had given the impression of an intense struggle with an overpowering victim, which was “bereft of particularity and precision”, and also grossly understated his hostility towards the victim (GD at [43]). The accused’s acts of grabbing the victim’s neck on two separate occasions and swinging his right hand towards the victim’s face was at odds with his purported desire to “talk things through nicely”. 18 The Magistrate further found that the justifications of private defence and necessity (referred to as “good faith”) did not apply in the present case, for reasons set out at [52] to [57] of his GD, and discussed in more detail from [47] below.",
        "The appeal against conviction": "",
        "The accused’s submissions": "19 The accused submitted that the Magistrate erred in his assessment of the victim’s credibility. The accused argued that the victim’s evidence was not cogent and was internally and externally inconsistent. 20 The alleged internal inconsistencies were broadly that: (a) The victim’s evidence as to where the slap had landed was inconsistent with the original charge (D1), which stated that the accused had slapped the victim’s face, without any mention of her ear or the grabbing of her neck. (b) The victim was inconsistent as to when she had pointed to the accused and raised her voice at him for making things difficult for her: during Examination-in-Chief, she said she did so when she came out of the office, before reaching the pool table, but later said she did so after throwing the pool balls. (c) While the victim testified that she was certain she had used her right hand to point at the accused, she later said she could not recall whether or not she had pointed at him when she was confronted with the CCTV footage. (d) The victim had claimed that she had “no strength to resist” the accused. She also initially denied she had pushed the accused, but later had to accept that she did so when confronted with the CCTV footage. (e) The victim initially claimed that the accused “swung” her, causing her to fall, then that he pushed her down, before finally admitting she had fallen on her own. 21 The alleged external inconsistencies were that: (a) The First Information Report (“FIR”) did not corroborate the victim’s account. The Prosecution did not clarify with the victim who the “boss” referred to therein was or what the victim had meant by “hit”. Further, the alleged grabbing of her neck was not mentioned in the FIR or in any of the medical reports. (b) The victim’s testimony that the pool balls she had thrown merely landed on the floor was inconsistent with the testimony of the Investigating Officer (“IO”) that a stern warning had been administered for a s 337(a) Penal Code offence. Further, the IO’s evidence was that the victim admitted to having been heavily intoxicated, which the victim denied having told him. (c) The accused made six points in respect of the CCTV footage. First, the victim’s suggestion that she had thrown the pool ball at the accused because he “kept chasing [her] around” was not corroborated by the footage. Second, the Prosecution’s case that the offending acts occurred during the two second “freeze” in the footage was a convenient coincidence that cast serious doubt. Third, the victim’s claim that she had no strength to resist the accused was inconsistent with the footage. Fourth, the victim’s evidence that the pool balls she had thrown landed on the floor was also not supported by the footage. Fifth, the footage was not conclusive as to whether the accused’s hand had been on the victim’s neck. Finally, while the victim claimed that she had not thrown a pool ball at the accused but instead at the floor or at the side of his leg, the footage showed that she threw a ball directly at the accused. 22 The accused further submitted that the Magistrate had erred in finding that he had the requisitemensreafor the offence. His body posture and gestures were insufficient grounds for the Magistrate’s finding that he had intended to cause hurt to the victim. The context in which his actions took place was relevant: as KG Pearl’s manager, he was responsible for safety and security at the pub. His intention was to prevent the victim from causing harm to the people or property at the pub with the pool balls and not to cause hurt to the victim. This was purportedly corroborated by the victim’s account of what the accused had said as he allegedly grabbed her neck: “what are you trying to do? You cannot just throw your tantrums here”. 23 In addition, the accused submitted that the Magistrate’s reliance on the fact that there was no evidence of any other hard slap was erroneous. Instead, the focus of the inquiry should have been whether there had been evidence of any blunt force trauma. The accused argued that the medical evidence was neutral at best, and that there were other instances which could have caused the injury sustained by the victim. 24 Lastly, the accused argued that the Magistrate conflated the defences of private defence and necessity (referred to by the accused as “good faith”), and thereby failed to provide proper reasons as to why he rejected each defence. In relation to private defence, the accused again asserted that he reasonably apprehended an attempt or continued threat by the victim to commit an offence and that his intention was to prevent her from causing further harm to the people and property at KG Pearl. In context, the accused’s actions were reasonable. The accused similarly argued that the Magistrate had erred in rejecting the defence of necessity under s 81 of the Penal Code, and that the accused had acted in good faith and exercised “due care and attention in his attempts to prevent [the victim] from causing further harm”.",
        "The Prosecution’s submissions": "25 The Prosecution submitted that the Magistrate had not erred in convicting the accused. 26 The Prosecution argued that the victim was a truthful and candid witness. This was illustrated by her various admissions, including that she had wanted to retaliate by hitting the accused, that she managed to “very quickly break free” from the accused’s grip the second time, and that she had fallen on her own when she tried to hit the accused. She had also readily admitted that she had been administered warnings by the police following the incident. Further, the Prosecution submitted that the victim’s account was internally and externally consistent: it was corroborated by the FIR, the account the victim had given to the doctor, the CCTV footage, and the injuries she had suffered. 27 The Prosecution also submitted that the Magistrate was right in dismissing the suggestion that there were other causes for the eardrum perforation. This was because Dr Ho’s evidence suggested that it was not likely that the perforation was occasioned by a very loud noise or by a fall: the perforation was present in only one ear and there was no bruising around the victim’s ear or any other parts of her head. 28 In contrast, the Prosecution submitted that the accused was an unreliable witness whose testimony was externally inconsistent, particularly with the CCTV footage and the statement given to the police (P7). For example, the Prosecution pointed out that the accused had made disparate and inconsistent claims as to why he had hit the victim on the left cheek a second time (P1A at 02:37:09). His evidence in court was that he had acted intentionally to “push her face”, while he had said in P7 that this slap was accidental and unintentional. He also embellished the account he provided in P7 by claiming that the victim had kicked at his penis. His claim that he was seeking to de-escalate the situation was contradicted by the video evidence. 29 The Prosecution further submitted that the defences of private defence and necessity were inapplicable. The accused’s attack on the victim was not induced by any reasonable apprehension of danger. The victim had already desisted before the accused went up to confront her. Even on the accused’s own case, any danger posed by the victim would have been defused after he shoved her against the wall and away from the pool table. There would have been no need to grab the victim’s neck or to slap her. He could also have pushed her away from the pool table by her arms or other less vulnerable parts of her body. Similarly, the defence of necessity was not available to the accused as any danger was not of such a nature or imminence as to justify his actions.",
        "My decision": "113 In my opinion, the Magistrate did not exercise his discretion on demonstrably wrong principles and appellate intervention in relation to the compensation order is not warranted in this case:DonohueEniliaat [40], citingKee Leong Beeand another v Public Prosecutor[1999] 2 SLR(R) 768 at [21]. 114 The main issue for consideration in the present case is whether the extent of damage is readily and easily quantifiable. The 14 May memorandum only provides estimates as to how much a mid-range hearing aid would cost on average, and the type of hearing aid suitable for the victim can only be determined with a Hearing Aid Evaluation appointment with an audiologist. The use of a hearing aid may be the only effective treatment for the victim’s conditions, but there is no suggestion that a hearing aid was strictly necessary, or even desired by the victim. The Magistrate appears to have accounted for any uncertainty in this regard by ordering a lower quantum than that which was suggested in the 14 May memorandum. While the memorandum suggests that the cost of operating a mid-range hearing aid for five years is approximately $2,751, the Magistrate only made a compensation order for $800. In my opinion, this amount was somewhat arbitrarily derived, and the Magistrate did not provide reasons for how he came to award this sum. 115 Before the Magistrate, the Prosecution submitted that “the cost of treatment could be a useful proxy to quantify the victim’s loss of amenity”. While I accept that compensation is often ordered on a rough-and-ready basis, I am not persuaded that it was correct in principle for compensation to be justified in this manner in the present case, where treatment may not be undertaken, and where the cost of such treatment is also uncertain. It would have been more appropriate, in my view, to account for the victim’s hearing loss and tinnitus by ordering compensation on the grounds of pain and suffering. This would also be consistent with the approach of the court inTay Wee Kiat. 116 InTay Wee Kiat, the court had regard to theGuidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases(Academy Publishing, 2010) and thePractitioners’ Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017). The former publication recommends $4,000 to $8,000 for “slight or occasional tinnitus with slight hearing loss” (at p 12). This is not inconsistent with the sums awarded by the courts for loss of hearing (ranging from $3,000 to $20,000) and a perforated eardrum ($5,000, agreed by the parties), indicated in the latter at p 148. 117 Even taking the lower end of the range, at $4,000, particularly since the tinnitus is described as “persistent”, the order of $800 would seem to be much too modest. However, I note that the Prosecution has not appealed against the compensation order made by the Magistrate, and had further left the matter to his discretion in the proceedings below, making no reference to any other materials for guidance in quantifying the compensation amount. 118 In the circumstances, putting aside any disagreements I may have with the basis for the compensation order and the actual quantum, I do not think it necessary to interfere with the order made in the present case. I therefore dismiss the accused’s appeal against the compensation order made by the Magistrate.",
        "The appeal against sentence": "",
        "The accused’s appeal": "55 The accused submitted that the sentence imposed by the Magistrate was manifestly excessive. According to the accused, the Magistrate failed to distinguish the cases ofKohJing Kwang,Public Prosecutor vTey Kok Peng(District Arrest Case No 912220 of 2014) (“TeyKok Peng”)andPublic Prosecutor vFeng Zhangao(Magistrate’s Arrest Case No 903682 of 2015) (“FengZhangao”), and instead wrongly found them to be “useful reference points” (GD at [65]). 56 The accused also submitted that the Magistrate erred in failing to properly consider the cases ofPublic Prosecutor v Cheng Tai Peng[2012] SGDC 121 and [2012] SGDC 104 (“Cheng Tai Peng”) andPublic Prosecutor v WongJiaxin[2010] SGDC 23 (“WongJiaxin”), which the accused argued would be more suitable reference points. The accused also argued that the Magistrate failed to considerPublic Prosecutor v AOB[2011] 2 SLR 793 (“AOB”), in which Chan Sek Keong CJ had referred toSim Yew Thong v Ng Loy Nam Thomasand other appeals[2000] 3 SLR(R) 155 (“Sim Yew Thong”) as suggesting that a custodial sentence is not imposed for a s 323 offence where the injuries are minor, there is a lack of premeditation, and the altercation is short (at [11]). According to the accused, there was no premeditation in the present case, the entire altercation lasted only 12 seconds, and the medical memorandum dated 14 May 2018 (“the 14 May memorandum”) did not state that the hearing loss was permanent. 57 Further, the accused argued that the Magistrate erred in considering the accused’s purported “sustained aggression” as an aggravating factor. This was not part of the charge and the accused had voluntarily stopped any purported aggression towards the victim. Similarly, the accused argued that undue weight was placed on his antecedents for unlawful assembly and rioting, since two of these offences took place more than 16 years ago. With regard to the accused’s 2014 conviction under s 143 of the Penal Code, the accused argued that he had not been the aggressor in that case, and that the facts were entirely different from those in the present appeal. 58 In contrast, the accused argued that the Magistrate placed insufficient weight on the accused’s evidence that he had been trying to restrain the victim, despite the fact that the Magistrate had found that the altercation was triggered by the victim’s initial act of throwing the pool balls, and that it was reasonable for the accused to “[take] it upon himself to quell the disturbance”. 59 The accused further submitted that weight should be placed on the fact that he was only charged on 18 May 2017 even though the incident took place on 12 July 2016. He argued that there was no intelligible reason for the delay in charging him. 60 The accused therefore urged the court to reduce his sentence to a fine.",
        "The Prosecution’s appeal": "61 The Prosecution appealed against the sentenced imposed by the Magistrate on the basis that the Magistrate failed to: (a) utilise the maximum penalty prescribed for an offence unders 323 of the Penal Code, which is two years’ imprisonment; (b) apply his mind to determine precisely where the accused’s conduct and the resulting harm fell within the spectrum of punishment devised by Parliament despite finding that he had caused “serious injury to the victim”, demonstrated “sustained aggression”, and “targeted the vulnerable parts of the victim’s body”; and (c) give due weight to the aggravating factors, in particular, that Low was a recalcitrant offender with a record of violence. 62 In its submissions, the Prosecution applied the approach adopted inPublic Prosecutorv BDB[2018] 1 SLR 127 (“BDB”), which pertained to the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code. This approach has been set out below, at [67] to [69]. The Prosecution extrapolated from the starting points set out by the Court of Appeal inBDBto proportionately deduce indicative starting points under s 323. Voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code(BDBat [56])Voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code(proposed by the Prosecution)DeathEight years’ imprisonment19 months’ imprisonmentMultiple fractures of the type and gravity as in the sixth charge inBDBThree years’ and six months’ imprisonmentEight months’ imprisonment 63 The Prosecution then argued that the indicative starting point in this case should be four months’ imprisonment. This was apparently derived through a comparison with the case ofPublic Prosecutor v Holman, Benjamin John[2018] SGHC 237 (“Holman Benjamin John”). 64 InHolman Benjamin John, a first-time offender who pleaded guilty to a s 323 charge was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment on appeal. This involved an altercation at an MRT platform, in which the accused pushed the victim, slapped him on the cheek, and punched him multiple times on his face. Some of these punches were inflicted while the victim was crouching on the ground. The victim pushed the accused away twice and punched him once during the scuffle, which lasted a minute or two. The parties were eventually separated by passers-by. The victim suffered a nasal bone fracture, two 2-cm lacerations over the nasal bridge and bruising over the left temple. He was also given seven days’ medical leave. At the material time, the accused was intoxicated and there were many other commuters at the platform. 65 The Prosecution then argued that as the injuries suffered by the victim in the present case were more serious than those inHolman Benjamin John, the appropriate indicative starting point in the present case would be four months’ imprisonment. Given the accused’s “sustained aggression” and antecedents, the Prosecution argued that the appropriate sentence would be at least five months’ imprisonment. According to the Prosecution, this would also be in line with the sentencing precedents, namely,Cheng Tai Peng,TeyKok Peng,FengZhangaoandKohJing Kwang.",
        "Sentencing guidelines for s 323 offences": "66 I begin by considering the application of the two-step approach inBDBto s 323 cases. 67 InBDB, the Court of Appeal set out a two-step sentencing approach for cases involving charges under s 325 of the Penal Code. The first step is to determine an indicative starting point for sentencing based on the seriousness of the injury. The seriousness of the injury caused to the victim should be assessed along a spectrum, having regard to considerations such as the nature and permanence of the injury. The Court of Appeal also stated that, in determining the indicative starting point, courts ought to have regard to the full breadth of the permitted sentencing range, while allowing room for the sentencing judge to make adjustments based on the offender’s culpability and other relevant circumstances (BDBat [55], [57] to [59]). 68 Having reviewed precedents in which serious injuries were caused, the Court of Appeal identified indicative starting points for offences unders 325 of the Penal Code, as follows (at [56]): (a) Causing death: around eight years; and (b) Causing multiple fractures of the type and gravity as in the sixth charge inBDB: around three years and six months. 69 At the second step, the indicative starting point should be adjusted either upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors (BDBat [55]). The Court of Appeal identified a non-exhaustive list of aggravating factors at [62]. Of relevance to the present case is the manner and duration of the attack, and the offender’s relevant antecedents. Typical mitigating factors were also identified at [71] ofBDB. 70 The Prosecution argues that the application of theBDBapproach tos 323 offences is justified because the mischief which both s 323 and s 325 seek to address, as well as their elements, are the same. I note that inBDBat [56], the Court of Appeal had explained why the hurt caused is a good indicator of the gravity of a s 325 offence by stating that: In our judgment, given the inherent mischief that underlies the offence under s 325, and considering thatamore severe sentencing range is prescribed for this offence (compared to the offence of voluntarily causing simple hurt unders 323) precisely becausegrievoushurt has been caused, the factor that should guide the court’s determination of the indicative starting point for sentencing should be theseriousness of the hurt causedto the victim. … [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold] 71 The Court of Appeal had also said (at [55]) that the seriousness of the injury underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s 325. This is inapplicable to s 323 offences. Where less serious hurt is concerned, it may fairly be said that other factors, including those going towards culpability, may carry greater weight. To an extent, this is consistent with the approach taken by the courts thus far in setting out sentencing guidance in specific categories of s 323 offences identified on the basis of factors other than the severity of hurt. This includes offences against public transport workers (Wong Hoi Lenv Public Prosecutor[2009] 1 SLR(R) 115) and domestic helpers (Tay Wee Kiatand another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2018] 4 SLR 1315). 72 While s 325 encompasses a broad spectrum of different forms of grievous hurt ranging from a simple fracture to death ([56] ofBDB), s 323 encompasses an even broader one ranging from transient bodily pain to death (s 319 of the Penal Code). This can be contrasted with the lower maximum permissible punishment provided for under s 323. Under s 323, the imprisonment term ordered may only extend to two years, while under s 325 it may extend to ten years. In short, s 323 carries a narrower sentencing range for a wider spectrum of hurt. 73 I therefore do not think it would be principled to proportionately deduce indicative starting points for s 323 in the mathematical manner suggested by the Prosecution. This is underscored by the fact that what would be a relatively serious injury under s 323 (eg, a simple fracture) would not necessarily be equally so under the scope of s 325. Fundamentally, the severity of the hurt must be assessed against the spectrum of offending behaviour captured by the offence, as well as the full range of sentencing options. 74 Further, to my mind, there is also a degree of artificiality involved in setting out indicative starting points for death and multiple fractures as suggested by the Prosecution. As the accused noted at the appeal before me, the Court of Appeal had determined the starting points after having reviewed the relevant precedents. There is greater difficulty in doing so for such grievous injuries in the s 323 context as it appears that such cases are usually prosecuted under aggravated versions of this offence, such as s 325 or s 326. 75 I also do not agree with the manner in which the Prosecution has derived its indicative starting point for the injuries sustained in the present case, where there is similarly a dearth of closely analogous precedents. As a matter of principle, it is not appropriate to attempt to derive an indicative starting point on the basis of a single case. This is particularly where the case that the Prosecution relied upon involved vastly different facts. The case ofHolman Benjamin Johninvolved a nasal fracture which was sustained as a result of an altercation which took place on an MRT platform at rush hour, and which caused a degree of disruption. The offender in that case was a first-time offender who had pleaded guilty. It would be inappropriate to attempt to derive an indicative starting point by analogising solely fromHolman Benjamin John. 76 Given the considerations I have outlined above, a more principled way of approaching the sentencing of s 323 offences would be to devise sentencing bands. This would not only give due regard to the full range of sentencing options, but also allow sufficient room for the sentencing judge to make adjustments based on the offender’s culpability and other relevant circumstances (BDBat [59]). The latter consideration is key in s 323 offences particularly because of the relatively circumscribed sentencing range compared to the wide spectrum of hurt encapsulated. The sentencing band approach would also minimise the possible arbitrariness of determining indicative starting points for specific types of hurt without the assistance of comparable precedents. 77 I now turn to describe the sentencing framework. In my judgment, it is appropriate to prescribe three broad sentencing bands providing indicative sentencing ranges based on the hurt caused by the offence. As a considerable number of s 323 cases are uncontested, the following bands are for a first-time offender who pleads guilty: BandHurt causedIndicative sentencing range1Low harm: no visible injury or minor hurt such asbruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasionsFines or short custodial term up to four weeks2Moderate harm: hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory functionBetween four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment3Serious harm: serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical proceduresBetween six to 24 months’ imprisonment 78 Appropriate calibrations can be made in situations where offenders have claimed trial. In sentencing an offender under s 323 of the Penal Code, the court should therefore undertake a two-step inquiry: (a) First, the court should identify the sentencing band and where the particular case falls within the applicable indicative sentencing range by considering the hurt caused by the offence. This would allow the court to derive the appropriate indicative starting point. (b) Next, the court should make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on its assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors. This may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable indicative sentencing range. The aggravating and mitigating factors identified inBDBat [62] to [70] and [71] to [75] respectively are relevant at this step. 79 For clarity, I should state that at the first step of this inquiry, the court should only have regard to the actual, and not potential, harm caused by the offence. This would ensure greater consistency in identifying the appropriate sentencing band since the potential harm that may be caused must be inferred from the circumstances of the offending. In contrast, the actual harm caused is usually readily ascertainable. Further, the factors relating to harm and culpability often affect both considerations, as the High Court acknowledged inPublic Prosecutor v YeoEk Boon Jeffrey and another matter[2018] 3 SLR 1080at [60]. In determining the potential harm caused by an offender, a court must often make an inference on the basis of factors which would otherwise go to culpability, such as the numbers of offenders involved, the use or attempted use of a dangerous implement and so on. The risk of double-counting therefore arises where potential harm is concerned. For analytical clarity, therefore, it would be preferable for these factors to be considered at the second step of this inquiry. As always, the sentencing court should guard against double-counting any factor. Band 1 80 The first band pertains to “non-aggravated” offences. This includes offences where even if there is visible injury, the hurt caused is minor, such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions. In the majority of these cases, a fine may be appropriate where the offender’s culpability is found to be low. This is consistent withSim Yew Thong, which was interpreted inAOBat [11] as suggesting that a custodial sentence is generally not imposed for a s 323 offence when (a) the offender’s actions were not premeditated; (b) the victim’s injuries were minor; and (c) the altercation lasted for only a short time. 81 I reiterate that the indicative ranges provided are merely starting points. There may be cases in which minor harm is caused, but where the custodial threshold is crossed such that a sentence up to or even in excess of four weeks’ imprisonment may be warranted. This may be due to, for example, a particular need for deterrence resulting from the offender’s antecedents, the need to protect a specific category of victim, or where there are factors indicating a high level of culpability, such as the use of a weapon, or a premeditated or group attack. 82 The accused citedWongJiaxin, in which a fine had been imposed. In that case, the accused, along with two others, had assaulted the victim, causing the victim to suffer a perforated right tympanic membrane, a contusion over the right zygomatic arch, and a swollen right ear with bruising. The victim was given two days’ medical leave. The accused pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a fine of $4000. It appears that this was on the basis that the accused had only hit the victim once, and had apparently done so spontaneously in an attempt to help his friend. On the specific facts of that case, the District Judge had concluded at [14] that the perforated ear drum was not a serious injury because the Prosecution made no mention of it and the medical report presumably did not indicate otherwise. There is no indication from the District Judge’s Grounds of Decision that the victim suffered any hearing loss from this injury. As such, the District Judge observed that the case was “on the borderline of the custody threshold”. This case therefore fell within Band 1 of the framework. Band 2 83 This band includes cases in which moderate harm was caused. This would include simple fractures, temporary or mild loss of hearing or sight. It would also include injuries that result in hospitalisation for a short time and/or a substantial period of medical leave. 84 The cases ofCheng Tai Peng,TeyKok Peng, andHolmanBenjamin John, discussed below, are examples of cases which would fall into Band 2 of the framework. As I shall explain in due course, the present case falls within Band 2 as well. Band 3 85 The third band covers cases in which serious hurt has been caused to the victim. This would generally include serious injuries of a permanent nature, or which necessitate significant surgical procedures. For example, this may include the permanent scarring of the face, permanent loss of sight or hearing, paralysis, and the loss of life or limb. This would generally be accompanied by extended periods of hospitalisation or medical leave. Where there are factors that increase culpability, sentences should be calibrated upwards from the starting point identified. 86 An example of a case which would fall into Band 3 isAbdul Aziz bin Omar v Public Prosecutor(Magistrate’s Appeal No 145 of 2000/01), cited inSentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) at p 194. In this case, the offender was unhappy with the victim, his brother, for revealing information about their family to other people. The offender confronted the victim and an argument ensued. A struggle took place and the victim began to kick the offender on his legs. The offender punched the victim on the face and neck a few times. The victim collapsed, lost consciousness, and later died in the hospital from “vaso-vagal inhibition due to blow to the neck”. On appeal, the offender was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. 87Koh Jing Kwangwas a case which would have fallen within Band 3 given that the victim had sustained a skull fracture. On appeal, I imposed a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment, which would be outside the indicative sentencing range for Band 3. This reflected his significantly lower culpability, since I had held that the accused could not be held to account for the full extent of the consequences suffered by the victim (at [62]).",
        "The appeal against the compensation order": "105 The Magistrate had exercised his discretion under s 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) in imposing a compensation order in the sum of $800. This was to provide for the possibility that the victim might procure a hearing aid. The accused has appealed against this order on the basis that it was wrong in law. 106 The law in this area is clear. Section 359 CPC imposes an obligation upon a court before which an offender is convicted to consider whether or not to order compensation and to make such an order if it considers it appropriate to do so (Tay Wee Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2018] 5 SLR 438 (“Tay Wee Kiat”) at [6]). 107 The relevant principles for the exercise of the court’s discretion were set out inTay Wee Kiatat [6] to [11]andSohMeiyun v Public Prosecutor[2014] 3 SLR 299 at [56] to [60]. First, compensation orders are not intended to punish offenders but instead to allow a victim to recover compensation where a civil suit is an inadequate or impractical remedy. This includes, but is not confined to, cases where the victim is impecunious. Second, compensation should only be ordered in clear cases where the fact and extent of damage are either agreed, or readily and easily ascertainable on the evidence. Third, the court should adopt a broad common-sense approach in assessing whether compensation should be awarded, and not allow itself to be enmeshed in “refined questions of causation” (Tay Wee Kiatat [9], citingPublic Prosecutor v DonohueEnilia[2005] 1 SLR(R) 220 (“DonohueEnilia”) at [22]). The court should be able to say, with a high degree of confidence, that the damage in question has been caused by the offence under circumstances which would ordinarily entitle the victim to damages. Fourth, the amount of compensation ordered should not exceed what would be reasonably obtainable in civil proceedings, and the order should only be made in respect of the injury which results from the offence for which the offender is convicted. Fifth, the order should not be oppressive, and the court must be satisfied that the accused will have the means to pay it within a reasonable time. 108 The accused submitted that the Magistrate had erred in law in imposing the compensation order. His arguments were threefold. 109 First, the quantum of compensation was derived based on the figures as set out in the 14 May memorandum by Dr Ho. However, the 14 May memorandum did not provide any estimate of the actual cost of treatment for the victim, but merely provided an illustrative figure for the estimated cost of a mid-range hearing aid. This is inadequate as the type of hearing aid which would be suitable was not determined. 110 Second, it is uncertain whether a hearing aid is necessary. The victim’s hearing loss is “very mild”. The victim had had no problems testifying in court without the hearing aid, and had not obtained a hearing aid in the two years following the offence. As such, the accused submits that the extent of the victim’s injuries and her likely expenses are speculative, and that the compensation order was made arbitrarily and without sufficient evidence. 111 Third, the accused urged the court to consider the fact that he had, with the assistance of KG Pearl, reimbursed the victim for all medical expenses incurred before he had even been charged. 112 On the other hand, the Prosecution argued that the Magistrate had not erred in making the order. First, the Prosecution argued that the victim belongs to a class of victims for whom it is impractical to commence a civil suit. This is because the victim is not resident in Singapore, and there is some evidence of her impecuniosity. Second, the damage suffered by the victim was readily and easily ascertainable: the Magistrate was entitled to consider the typical cost of treatment which the victim would have to undergo to treat her condition. This was particularly since the use of the hearing aid was the only effective treatment for the victim’s conditions. Third, the compensation order was not oppressive on the accused, who was not impecunious.",
        "Conclusion": "119 For the above reasons, I dismiss the accused’s appeals. I allow the Prosecution’s appeal and enhance the accused’s imprisonment term to four months. See Kee OonJudge  Ngiam Hian Theng, Diana, Sunil Sudheesan and Joel Ng for the appellant in MA 9240/2018/01 and the respondent in MA 9240/2018/02;Hay Hung Chun and Sheryl Yeo for the respondentin MA 9240/2018/01 and the appellant in MA 9240/2018/02."
