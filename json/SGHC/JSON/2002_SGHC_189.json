        "The facts": "2        This was a claim for\n\ndamages arising out of personal injuries suffered as a result of an industrial accident at\n\nher employer’s (the defendants) premises. On 12 April 2000, the plaintiff was\n\npunching metal work pieces using a power press machine, when her hands were crushed\n\nagainst the tooling die by the ram of the machine. Both her hands had to be amputated.3        The action was commenced in\n\nthe District Court, but was later transferred to the High Court on 11 December 2000 by\n\nconsent pursuant to section 38 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321). The trial was set\n\ndown for one day with two witnesses for the plaintiff and six witnesses for the\n\ndefendants. On the day of the trial, the parties came to a settlement and the defendants\n\nadmitted liability for the accident on a 100% basis. Interlocutory judgment with damages\n\nto be assessed was recorded by the court. The assessment of damages before the assistant\n\nregistrar took one and a half days, with one day for the taking of evidence from the\n\nwitnesses, followed by half a day of arguments by counsel. The plaintiff was awarded a\n\ntotal of $729,659.10 in damages.",
        "The law with respect to taxation of costs": "4        The procedure and rules\n\nwith regard to taxation of costs is governed by Order 59 of the Rules of Court (Revised\n\nEdition 1997). The fundamental tenet on a taxation of costs is that of reasonableness,\n\nwhether on a standard or indemnity basis.5        Appendix 1 to Order 59 sets\n\nout the principles which the taxing Registrar should apply in awarding costs. Paragraph\n\n1(1) states that the amount of costs allowed is in the discretion of the Registrar.\n\nHowever, in exercising this discretion, the Registrar is to have regard to all the\n\nrelevant circumstances, and in particular, to the matters listed in paragraphs 1(2)(a) to\n\n(f).6        In coming to my decision on\n\nthe costs to be awarded for the Bill, I was guided by and applied the legal principles\n\nespoused above.7        At the taxation hearing\n\nbefore me, the main argument put forth by the defendants’ solicitors was that the\n\naction was a straightforward one which involved no complex issues of law or fact. The\n\nauthorities relied on were similar to those used in numerous other cases of the same\n\nnature. The plaintiff’s solicitor, on the other hand, submitted that the amount of\n\n$85,000 sought in Section 1 was justifiable – first, quantification of the\n\nplaintiff’s damages was difficult as the plaintiff could not decide whether to opt\n\nfor hand transplantation or myo-electric hands. There were also no precedents which were\n\ndirectly on point, which necessitated much research into both local and English case law.\n\nIn addition, much groundwork had been done for the trial and assessment.8        The court noted that the\n\npresent case, although not complicated in its facts, was unique in that it involved the\n\namputation of both hands, for which there was no clear and direct case authority. I\n\naccepted that the plaintiff’s solicitors had to carry out more detailed research\n\nbefore they could arrive at an appropriate figure of damages in this regard. Even though\n\nthe case did not go on for the one-day trial, all the preparatory work towards the trial\n\nhad already been completed. The plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence was 56 pages. The\n\nbundle of pleadings was 25 pages. The bundle of authorities was 77 pages. The 9-page\n\nopening statement was also prepared. For the getting-up work up to entering of the consent\n\ninterlocutory judgment, I awarded $14,000.9        The hearing for the\n\nassessment of damages lasted one and a half days in total, including arguments by counsel.\n\nThe plaintiff’s counsel’s opening statement was 21 pages. The defendant’s\n\ncounsel’s opening statement was 43 pages. Four witnesses, including one expert\n\nmedical witnesses, gave evidence. I awarded $26,000 for the work done in respect of the\n\nassessment of damages. In total, I awarded $40,000 for Section 1.10        Both the plaintiff and the\n\ndefendants filed reviews of taxation. At the hearing of the review of taxation, the\n\narguments presented were essentially a re-hash of those put forth at the initial hearing\n\nfor taxation. I found no reason to disturb my earlier findings. Hence, I dismissed both\n\nreviews.Sgd:THIAN YEE SZEASSISTANT REGISTRARCopyright © Government of Singapore."
