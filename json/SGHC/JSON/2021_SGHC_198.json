        "Parties and the genesis of the opposition proceedings below": "2 The applicant is a company based in Shanghai, in the People’s Republic of China (“China”), and has been established since 2001. It is in the business of manufacturing and supplying products such as plastic valves and fittings, and the production, design and development of industrial piping systems for both domestic and international markets.1Foot Note 1×Statutory Declaration of Wang Qiu Bin (“Wang’s SD”) of 17 July 2019 at [6]: Bundle of Documents (“BOD”) at p 173.Since around January 2011, the applicant claims to have been exporting its products into Singapore.2Foot Note 2×Wang’s SD at [8]: BOD at p 174. 3 On 7 October 2015, the applicant filed its International Registration No. 1292448 for the application mark (“the Application Mark”), designating Singapore. The Application Mark is as follows:3Foot Note 3×BOD at p 4.  4 On 17 March 2016, the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (“IPOS”) was notified of the applicant’s International Registration designating Singapore. The applicant’s Singapore application under Trade Mark No. 40201605065Y is in Classes 17, 19 and 20 in respect of the following goods:4Foot Note 4×Wang’s SD at [4]: BOD at p 172; Wang’s SD at [11]: BOD at p 174. (a) Class 17: Sealing rings; casings for pipes, not of metal; junctions for pipes, not of metal; plastic pipes; plastic board; plastic poles; plastic strips; flexible tubes, not of metal; clack valves of rubber;(b) Class 19: Rigid pipes, not of metal; water-pipes, not of metal; rigid pipes for building, not of metal; plastic ducts used in construction; drain traps or valves, not of metal or plastic; water pipes, not of metal; water-pipe valves, not of plastic or metal; building materials, not of metal; reinforcing materials, not of metal, for building; and(c) Class 20: Clips for cables and pipes, not of metal; valves, not of metal, other than parts of machines; water-pipe valves of plastic; drain valves of plastic; fiber reinforced plastic container; plastic trough for cables and wires; valves, not of metal, other than parts of machines. 5 The respondent filed its Notice of Opposition to oppose the registration of the Application Mark on 6 February 2018.5Foot Note 5×Notice of Opposition p 7: BOD at p 12.The respondent is a company organised and existing under the laws of the US. It was founded in 1901 and the respondent’s company name and related trade marks comprising “Charlotte” are derived from the name of the city, Charlotte, in North Carolina of the US, where the respondent was first set up and remains headquartered. The respondent manufactures pipes and fittings for plumbing and industrial systems and claims to be one of the world’s leading manufacturers in respect of these products.6Foot Note 6×Statutory Declaration of Brad Muller of 22 March 2019 (“Muller’s SD”) at [3]: BOD at p 40.It distributes its products through partners in the US, Latin America, the Middle East, Oceania and Asia, including Singapore.7Foot Note 7×Muller’s SD at [4]: BOD at p 40. 6 In the opposition proceedings below, the respondent relied on its registered mark in Singapore (“the Respondent’s Registered Mark”) and its unregistered marks (“the Respondent’s Unregistered Marks”). 7 Details of the Respondent’s Registered Mark are as follows:8Foot Note 8×Muller’s SD at [6], Annex 3: BOD at pp 40, 70–72.

        "The decision below": "10 In this section, I only highlight salient points of the Adjudicator’s GD which will assist in appreciating the nature and relevance of the further evidence sought to be adduced in SUM 1081. The respondent’s opposition is founded on ss 8(2)(b) (similarity with earlier registered mark), 8(4)(b)(i) read with 8(4)(a) (well known trade mark) and 8(7)(a) (passing off) of the TMA. 11 The Adjudicator rejected a preliminary objection by the applicant to the respondent’s reliance on the Respondent’s Unregistered Marks. The applicant argued that the respondent failed to plead these marks.10Foot Note 10×GD at [15].However, the Adjudicator found that “there was sufficient reference in [the respondent’s] pleadings and the evidence tendered, to the [respondent’s] common law rights in [the Respondent’s Unregistered Marks]”.11Foot Note 11×GD at [20]. 12 The Adjudicator then allowed the opposition under s 8(7)(a) of the TMA on the basis that the Application Mark had passed off the Respondent’s Unregistered Marks.12Foot Note 12×GD at [68], [74], [79], [82].She recognised the respondent’s goodwill in Singapore from 2013 to 2015 based on invoices from the respondent to its Singapore distributor, Agru Technology Pte Ltd (“Agru Tech”) on which the Respondent’s Unregistered Logo Mark was printed (“the Respondent-Agru Tech Invoices”).13Foot Note 13×Muller’s SD at Annex 6: BOD at pp 91–106.The Adjudicator also accepted, as evidence of goodwill, invoices from Agru Tech to consumers in Singapore, from 2014 to 2015 (“the Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices”).14Foot Note 14×GD at [68].Although neither the Respondent’s Registered Mark nor the Respondent’s Unregistered Marks are printed on the Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices, the Adjudicator held that the description of the products on these invoices “appeared to correspond with the description of products sold from the [respondent] to Agru Tech and the description of the [respondent’s] products on Agru Tech’s website”.15Foot Note 15×GD at [50], [68].For completeness, the Adjudicator dismissed the opposition under s 8(2)(b) of the TMA because the Respondent’s Registered Mark was registered after the application for the International Registration of the Application Mark was filed.16Foot Note 16×GD at [31]–[32], [54]. 13 The applicant appeals against the Adjudicator’s decision to allow the opposition under s 8(7)(a) of the TMA. Its grounds of appeal include that:17Foot Note 17×Applicant’s Bundle of Documents (“ABOD”) at p 3. (a) The Adjudicator erred in concluding that the Respondent’s Unregistered Logo Mark should be considered for the purposes of the respondent’s opposition;(b) The Adjudicator erred in concluding that the respondent had goodwill in Singapore as of 7 October 2015 as a result of use of the Respondent’s Unregistered Logo Mark; and/or(c) The Adjudicator erred in concluding that the use of the Application Mark would constitute a misrepresentation giving rise to a likelihood of confusion with the relevant sector of the public.",
        "Facts pertaining to SUM 1081": "14 On 5 March 2021, the applicant filed SUM 1081 for leave to adduce further evidence, in Wang Qiu Bin’s (“Mr Wang”) first affidavit of 19 March 2021 (“Mr Wang’s First Affidavit”), for TA 2/2021. Mr Wang is the general manager of the applicant.18Foot Note 18×Wang Qiu Bin’s 1st Affidavit of 19 March 2021 (“Wang’s 1st Affidavit”) at [1]: ABOD at p 64.The applicant groups its further evidence into two categories: (a) the Import Evidence;19Foot Note 19×Wang’s 1st Affidavit at [9]–[34], pp 43–160: ABOD at pp 67–77, 106–223.and (b) the SCH 80 Evidence.20Foot Note 20×Wang’s 1st Affidavit at [36]–[46], pp 162–307: ABOD at pp 77–79, 225–307. 15 The Import Evidence, in essence, aims to prove “use of the Application Mark in Singapore prior to the earliest date which the [r]espondent was found in the GD to allegedly have goodwill, which is 17 December 2013”.21Foot Note 21×Applicant’s submissions of 3 May 2021 (“AS”) at [19].The applicant classifies the Import Evidence into four categories and claims that the evidence shows:22Foot Note 22×AS at [17]. (a) sales of products bearing the Application Mark to Hyflux Membrane Manufacturing (S) Pte Ltd (“Hyflux”) in Singapore in January 2012;(b) sales of products bearing the Application Mark to Hyflux in Singapore from February to April 2012;(c) sales of products bearing the Application Mark to Hyflux in June 2012;(d) the installation of the applicant’s goods bearing the Application Mark in the Hyflux Tuaspring water desalination plant in Singapore (“the Hyflux Desalination Plant”) on or before 26 August 2013. 16 With regards the SCH 80 Evidence, the applicant is of the view that the Adjudicator erred in finding, from the Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices, that Agru Tech had supplied the respondent’s products to customers in Singapore.23Foot Note 23×AS at p 20, heading V(c).On the applicant’s reading of [68] of the GD, the Adjudicator erroneously concluded that the terms “SCH 80”, “Schedule 80” or “PVC SCH 80” (“the SCH 80 Terms”) found in the Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices were distinctive of the respondent’s goods. The relevant portions of [68] and [50] of the GD (the latter paragraph being cross-referenced in the former) state as follows: 68 … As mentioned (at [50] above), the invoices from Agru Tech to its consumers contained descriptions of products which appeared to correspond with the description of products sold from the [respondent] to Agru Tech and the description of the [respondent] products on Agru Tech’s website. It was clear that there were sales conducted by the [respondent] of its products during the period from 2013 to 2015. 50  … As for the [Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices], while there was no clear use of any of the [Respondent’s] Unregistered Marks on these invoices, the descriptions of the products (to which the marks were applied), i.e “PVC SCH 80…”, appeared to correspond with the description of products sold from the [respondent] to Agru Tech and the description of the [respondent’s] products on Agru Tech’s website. 17 The applicant’s SCH 80 Evidence aims to show that, in fact, these are “generic terms and/or specifications which are widely used in industry”.24Foot Note 24×AS at [42].Put another way, the Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices do not evidence sales of therespondent’sgoods by Agru Tech to consumers in Singapore. The SCH 80 Evidence consists of: (a) the definition of PVC;25Foot Note 25×Wang’s 1st Affidavit at [42], pp 162–171: ABOD at pp 225–234.(b) websites illustrating the meaning of Schedule 80;26Foot Note 26×Wang’s 1st Affidavit at [43], pp 172–195: ABOD at pp 235–258.and(c) sales brochures from companies around the world which sell PVC Schedule 80 pipes.27Foot Note 27×Wang’s 1st Affidavit at [44], pp 196–307: ABOD at pp 259–370.",
        "The parties’ cases": "18 The applicant argues that theLadd v Marshall[1954] 1 WLR 1489 (“Ladd v Marshall”) conditions, traditionally applied to determine the admissibility of further evidence on appeal, are not the only relevant factors in trade mark proceedings.28Foot Note 28×AS at [12].It urges the court to consider, in addition, the factors enumerated inHunt-Wesson Inc’s Trade Mark Application[1996] RPC 233 (“Hunt-Wesson”) (“theHunt-Wessonfactors”) (see [32] below). 19 With regards the Import Evidence, the applicant initially argued in its written submissions that it could not have adduced this evidence earlier due to the defects in the respondent’s pleadings below. However, at the hearing before me, when asked whether the distinctive element of the Respondent’s Registered Mark and Respondent’s Unregistered Marks is “CHARLOTTE”, the applicant accepted that this was the case.29Foot Note 29×Minute sheet of 14 May 2021 (“MS”) at pp 2–3.Coupled with the fact that it had claimed user of the Application Mark since 2011 in its statutory declarations (see [42] below), the applicant recognised that it would have difficulty showing that the Import Evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence.30Foot Note 30×MS at p 3.The applicant also submits that the Import Evidence is highly significant to the outcome of the appeal and is credible. It further argues that the respondent will not suffer prejudice which cannot be compensated by costs, and that allowing its application will avoid multiplicity of proceedings (ie, the need to separately oppose any applications for the registration of the Respondent’s Unregistered Marks). 20 With regards the SCH 80 Evidence, the applicant submits that the need for this evidence only arose due to [68] of the GD. Such evidence is highly significant as it affects the existence of the respondent’s goodwill and is credible.31Foot Note 31×AS at [44], [45]. 21 The applicant also submits that the court has the power to remit this matter to the Adjudicator under O 55 r 6(5) of the ROC or its inherent power.32Foot Note 32×Applicant’s further submissions of 28 May 2021 (“AFS”) at pp 2–7.However, as there is no necessity for remission in this case,33Foot Note 33×AFS at [11].the existence of this power is no impediment to granting its application. 22 The respondent also submits that both theLadd v Marshallconditions andHunt-Wessonfactors are relevant.34Foot Note 34×Respondent’s submissions of 3 May 2021 (“RS”) at [75].As to their application to the facts, the respondent argues that none of theLadd v Marshallconditions andHunt-Wessonfactors support granting the application. In the main, the respondent highlights that the further evidence could have been adduced earlier and that the applicant is now attempting to cure defects in its case by responding to the GD.35Foot Note 35×RS at [86]. 23 With regards the Import Evidence, the respondent questions its authenticity36Foot Note 36×RS at [72].and submits that the further evidence will not have an important influence on the result of the appeal. In respect of the latter point, the respondent points out,inter alia, that the Import Evidence does not prove sales of the applicant’s goods in Singapore by reference to the Application Mark37Foot Note 37×RS at [50].and that the applicant did not plead prior goodwill.38Foot Note 38×RS at [46]. 24 As for the SCH 80 Evidence, the respondent argues that besides the SCH 80 Terms, there are other identifiers in the descriptions of the goods sold which are common to both the Respondent-Agru Tech Invoices and Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices which the Adjudicator could have relied on to find that Agru Tech was selling the respondent’s goods.39Foot Note 39×RS at [64].In any case, the existence of its goodwill is also premised on the respondent’s sales to Agru Tech itself from 2013 to 2015, as evidenced in the Respondent-Agru Tech Invoices.40Foot Note 40×RS at [65]. 25 In addition, the respondent submits that allowing the application will cause it prejudice which cannot be compensated by costs and undermines finality in the opposition. Finality is undermined as the court has the power to remit the case to the Adjudicator under O 87 r 4(2) ROC and remission would be appropriate if the application is granted so as to,inter alia, allow cross-examination of Mr Wang.41Foot Note 41×Respondent’s further submissions of 28 May 2021 (“RFS”) at [17].Finally, the respondent argues that there is no public interest in granting the application as a party asserting a proprietary right in a trade mark has the responsibility to advance its entire case, including all relevant material in support thereof.42Foot Note 42×RS at [110].",
        "Issues to be determined": "26 Based on the foregoing, the issues for my determination are: (a) What is the test to be applied in deciding whether to grant leave for further evidence to be adduced under O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC?(b) Whether the Import Evidence should be admitted on appeal under O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC?(c) Whether the SCH 80 Evidence should be admitted on appeal under O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC?",
        "The test for adducing further evidence on appeal under O 87 r 4(2) ROC": "27 Both parties are in broad agreement as to the proper test to be applied to determine if further evidence should be adduced on appeal under O 87 r 4(2) ROC.43Foot Note 43×AS at [10]; RS at [23]–[24].Namely, the factors endorsed by the Court of Appeal inMartek Biosciences Corp v Cargill International Trading Pte Ltd[2011] 1 SLR 1287 (“Martek”) in respect of O 87A r 13(2) ROC (appeals from the Registrar of Patents (“the Patents Registrar”))are also relevant under O 87 r 4(2) ROC (appeals from the Registrar of Trade Marks (“the TM Registrar”)). 28 The applicable provision in this case, O 87 r 4(2) ROC, provides that: An appeal shall be by way of rehearing and the evidence used on appeal shall be the same as that used before the Registrar [of Trade Marks] and, except with the leave of the Court, no further evidence shall be given. 29 O 87 r 4(2) isin pari materiawith O 87A r 13(2) ROC. The latter is the equivalent provision in respect of patent proceedings: An appeal shall be by way of rehearing and the evidence used on appeal shall be the same as that used before the Registrar [of Patents] and, except with the leave of the Court, no further evidence shall be given. 30 Before turning to the Court of Appeal’s pronouncement inMartek, by way of context, I ought to set out the general test for adducing further evidence on appeal. The former O 57 r 13(2) of the Rules of Court (2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2006”) conferred on the Court of Appeal the power to admit further evidence on appeals from the High Court. TheLadd v Marshalltest was applied to determine if further evidence should be admitted on appeals from the High Court to the Court of Appeal (Martekat [12]–[13]). TheLadd v Marshalltest prescribes that the further evidence sought to be adduced (Martekat [11]): (a) must not have been obtainable with reasonable diligence for use at the trial;(b) must be such that, if given, would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; and(c) must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible. Following the constitution of the Appellate Division of the High Court and corresponding amendments to the ROC, the court’s power under the formerO 57 r 13(2) of the ROC 2006 may be found in O 57 r 13(1) read with O 55D r 11(1) of today’s ROC (appeals to the Court of Appeal). 31Martekat [12] makes clear that theLadd v Marshallconditions give effect to the requirement of “special grounds” being proven before further evidence may be adduced on appeal, other than for evidence as to matters which occurred after the date of the decision being appealed (O 57 r 13(1) read withO 55D r 11(1) ROC). For ease of reference, O 55D r 11(1) and O 57 r 13(1) of the ROC state as follows: General powers of Court (O. 55D, r. 11) 11.—(1) The General Division shall have power to receive further evidence on questions of fact, either by oral examination in the General Division, by affidavit, or by deposition taken before an examiner, but no such further evidence (other than evidence as to matters which have occurred after the date of the decision from which the appeal is brought) may be given except onspecial grounds. … General powers of Court (O. 57, r. 13) 13.—(1)  In hearing and deciding an appeal, the Court of Appeal has all the powers and duties, as to amendment and otherwise, of the General Division. … [emphasis in original in bold; emphasis added in bold italics] 32  However, the Court of Appeal inMartekheld that having regard to: (a) the fact that the requirement of “special grounds” is not found in O 87A r 13(2) of the ROC (at [12]); and (b) the nature of proceedings for revocation of patents (which affects the public’s interest in a way not found in private litigation between two parties) (at [14]), theLadd v Marshalltest should not be prescribed as a strict test for the purposes of an application to adduce further evidence under O 87A r 13(2) of the ROC (at [35]). In practical terms, this means that although theLadd v Marshallconditions are “useful”, just because the applicant has not satisfied all theLadd v Marshallconditions does not mean that its application must necessarily fail (at [11], [35]). The court should go further to consider whether there are any other compelling factors which make it “just” to admit the further evidence in question (at [17], [35]). In this regard, the other considerations stated by Laddie J inHunt-Wessonat 242, while non-exhaustive, are relevant: (a) whether the evidence could have been filed earlier and, if so, how much earlier;(b) if the evidence could have been filed earlier, what explanation for the late filing has been offered to explain the delay;(c) the nature of the trade mark;(d) the nature of the objections to it;(e) the potential significance of the new evidence;(f) whether or not the other side will be significantly prejudiced by the admission of the evidence in a way which cannot be compensated,eg, by an order for costs;(g) the desirability of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings; and(h) the public interest in not admitting onto the register invalid trade marks. 33 Having considered the parties’ submissions and the Court of Appeal’s reasoning inMartek, I find that the approach inMartekdescribed in the preceding paragraph (“theMartekapproach”) should be adopted in respect ofO 87 r 4(2) of the ROC. My reasons are as follows. 34 First, as a matter of principle, the reasons for which the Court of Appeal inMartekheld that theLadd v Marshalltest should not be strictly applied under O 87A r 13(2) apply equally under O 87 r 4(2). Namely, there is no need to prove “special grounds” under either provision in order to adduce further evidence on appeal. Further, the registration of both patents and trade marks does not merely affect the parties to the particular proceedings in question, but have “repercussions on the market at large” (Martekat [14]). Like the proprietor of a patent, a proprietor of a registered trade mark in Singapore enjoys a monopoly within the jurisdiction in connection with,inter alia, “the use of his trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical to, or similar with, the goods or services within the specification of goods/services of his registration” (Ng-Loy Wee Loon,Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore(Sweet & Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2014) at para 20.3.3; s 27 of the TMA). Put another way, the statutory monopoly granted by registration of a trade mark affects “all traders in the country” (Hunt-Wessonat 241). 35 Second, the Court of Appeal inMartekitself recognised the similarities, highlighted in the preceding paragraph, between patent and trade mark proceedings (at [10], [13]–[14]). Additionally,Hunt-Wesson, the case in which Laddie J enumerated the factors endorsed by the Court of Appeal inMartekin connection with O 87A r 13(2) ROC, involved an appeal against the dismissal of an opposition to atrade markregistration (at 236). 36 Third, the two-step analysis prescribed by the Court of Appeal inAnan Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd vVTB Bank (Public Joint Stock Co)[2019] 2 SLR 341 (“AnanGroup”) to assist in determining how strictly to apply theLadd v Marshalltest in any given case supports the adoption of theMartekapproach in trade mark proceedings. The two-step analysis is as follows (Anan Groupat [57]–[58]): (a) First, the court should consider the nature of the proceedings below and evaluate the extent to which they bear the characteristics of a full trial, or whether it more closely resembles an interlocutory appeal. In appeals against a judgment after trial or a hearing bearing the characteristics of a trial, the interests of finality assume heightened importance, and the court should apply the requirements inLadd v Marshallwith its full rigour, subject to the second stage of the analysis. On the other hand, in interlocutory appeals or appeals arising out of hearings which lack the characteristics of a trial, the court remains guided by the rule inLadd v Marshallbut is not obliged to apply it in an unattenuated manner. (b) Second, if the court determines thatLadd v Marshallshould be applied strictly due to the nature of the proceedings below, the court should then determine if there are any other reasons for which theLadd v Marshallrequirements should be relaxed in the interests of justice. Such cases for relaxation would fall into three categories: (i) the new evidence reveals a fraud that has been perpetrated on the trial court; (ii) the applicant was prevented from adducing the fresh evidence during the hearing below in circumstances which amount to a denial of natural justice; and (iii) the subject matter of the dispute engenders interests of particular importance whether to the litigant or to the society at large. In each of these categories, the court is entitled to determine whetherLadd v Marshallshould be relaxed in the particular circumstances of the case so as to achieve justice on the facts. 37 Under the first step, I take the view that proceedings before the TM Registrar are in some ways akin to full trials. This is because parties put in evidence by way of statutory declarations and the TM Registrar may direct the taking of oral evidence and cross-examination of witnesses (Trade Marks Rules (2008 Rev Ed) (“TMR”), rr 69(1) and 69(3)). My characterisation of trade mark proceedings aligns with the Court of Appeal’s in relation to proceedings before the Patents Registrar (Martekat [14];Ananat [54]). InMartek, the Court of Appeal accepted that proceedings before the Patents Registrar are in some ways akin to full trials with oral evidence being adduced and cross-examination taking place. The court explains that this (at [14]): … entails that each party in a proceeding before the Patents Registrar must put its entire case before the Patents Registrar. It would be highly undesirable to freely permit parties, after the Patents Registrar has decided a matter, to adduce further evidence in an appeal from the Patents Registrar’s decision to the High Court Primafacie, the nature of trade mark proceedings weighs in favour of a strict application of theLadd v Marshallconditions. 38 However, at the second step of theAnananalysis, the public interest implications of trade mark proceedings described at [36(b)(iii)] above render the uncompromising application of theLadd v Marshallconditions inappropriate. Under theMartekapproach, the non-exhaustiveHunt-Wessonfactors are relevant considerations to the court’s discretion on how far to relax theLadd v Marshallconditions. But, as the Court of Appeal cautioned inAnanat [46], theLadd v Marshallconditions are not automatically relaxed if a case falls into one of the identified categories in step two of the analysis. Thus, when applying theMartekapproach, courts must pay close attention to the specific circumstances of each case. 39 For all these reasons, theMartekapproach should be adopted to determine whether to grant leave for further evidence to be adduced under O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC. I will now apply this approach to each category of further evidence sought to be adduced in this application.",
        "Whether the Import Evidence should be admitted on appeal under O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC?": "",
        "Ladd v Marshall conditions": "101 I accept that the firstLadd v Marshallcondition is satisfied. Given the nature of its case in proceedings below, the applicant was not required to show that the SCH 80 Terms in the Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices did not refer to the respondent’s goods. As a general submission before the Adjudicator, the applicant argued that all the invoices in Annex 6 of Mr Muller’s Statutory Declaration (including the Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices) were “irrelevant and must be disregarded since they post-date” the date on which the applicant first used the Application Mark in Singapore (ie, when the alleged act of passing off started).97Foot Note 97×Applicant’s written submissions at [109]: BOD at p 1101.This is a temporal objection. In what seems to be an additional challenge on top of its temporal objection, Mr Wang alleged in his statutory declaration that “the [respondent’s] evidence vis-à-vis its alleged sales in Singapore are all self-serving documents that the [respondent] has prepared at its end”.98Foot Note 98×Wang’s SD at [21(b)]: BOD at p 181; Counter-statement of 6 August 2018 at [13]: BOD at p 31. 102 The need to adduce the SCH 80 Evidence only arose due to [68] of the GD (see [16] above). On the applicant’s interpretation, the Adjudicator erred in finding that the SCH 80 Terms found in the Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices were distinctive of the respondent’s goods. Correspondingly, the finding that Agru Tech was distributing the respondent’s goods in Singapore is baseless. As the issue of whether the SCH 80 Terms are distinctive of the respondent’s goods only arose on appeal, I find that it was “reasonably not apprehended” that the SCH 80 Evidence would or could have a bearing on the case at hand (Public Prosecutor v MohdAriffan bin Mohd Hassan[2018] 1 SLR 544 at [68], affirmed inAnan Groupat [43]). I deem the requirement of non-availability to be satisfied. 103 However, I am not convinced that the secondLadd v Marshallcondition is fulfilled. I accept the respondent’s submission that there is another common identifier of the goods being sold in the Respondent-Agru Tech Invoices and Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices.99Foot Note 99×RS at [64]; MS at p 8.This common identifier supports the inference that the goods sold by the respondent to Agru Tech were being distributed by the latter to consumers in Singapore. Put another way, even assuming that the Adjudicator erred in finding that the SCH 80 Terms are distinctive of the respondent’s goods, and relied on such distinctiveness to conclude that Agru Tech was distributing the respondent’s goods in Singapore (“the Singapore Distribution Conclusion”), the Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices may continue to support the Singapore Distribution Conclusion. 104  This common identifier is the serial number (eg, #835-005) tagged to each good sold by the respondent. The serial numbers are used in both the Respondent-Agru Tech Invoices and Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices.100Foot Note 100×RS at [64].For instance, I set out several serial numbers and the corresponding good named in a Respondent-Agru Tech Invoice dated 17 December 2013: Serial NumberRespondent’s good#835-005PVC 08101 1/2 SCH 80 Female Adapter SXFPT101Foot Note 101×Diggs’ 1st Affidavit at p 118: ABOD at p 655.#835-007PVC 08101 3/4 SCH 80 Female Adapter SXFPT102Foot Note 102×Diggs’ 1st Affidavit at p 118: ABOD at p 655.#835-010PVC 08101 1 SCH 80 Female Adapter S X FPT103Foot Note 103×Diggs’ 1st Affidavit at p 119: ABOD at p 656. 105 In Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices issued in 2014 and 2015 to various entities in Singapore, identical serial numbers are used in relation to goods with highly similar descriptions: Serial NumberDescription of good sold by Agru Tech#835-005PVC SCH 80 Female Adapter, ½\" (SOC x FIPT)104Foot Note 104×Diggs’ 1st Affidavit at p 135: ABOD at p 672.#835-007PVC SCH 80 Female Adapter, ¾\" (SOC x FIPT)105Foot Note 105×Diggs’ 1st Affidavit at p 137: ABOD at p 674.#835-010PVC SCH 80 Female Adapter, 1\" (SOC x FIPT)106Foot Note 106×Diggs’ 1st Affidavit at p 133: ABOD at p 670. 106 The common serial numbers in the Respondent-Agru Tech Invoices and Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices may therefore show that Agru Tech was distributing the respondent’s goods in Singapore. 107 In any event, I agree with the respondent that the Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices are not necessary to sustain the finding that the respondent had goodwill from 2013 to 2015.107Foot Note 107×Diggs’ 1st Affidavit at [57]; ABOD, at p 557.As the Adjudicator accepted,108Foot Note 108×GD at [68]–[69].the sales evidenced by the Respondent-Agru Tech Invoices also establish the respondent’s goodwill from 2013 to 2015.109Foot Note 109×RS at [65]; Muller’s SD at [12], pp 53–68: BOD at pp 42, 91–106. 108 Finally, given the respondent is not disputing that the SCH 80 Terms are general descriptors,110Foot Note 110×RS at [67]; Diggs’ 1st Affidavit at [55]: ABOD at p 556.the SCH 80 Evidence is redundant. 109 For these reasons, I fail to see how the SCH 80 Evidence is likely to have an importance influence on the outcome of the appeal. 110 With regards the thirdLadd v Marshallcondition, the respondent questions the credibility of the SCH 80 Evidence because it is being adduced late.111Foot Note 111×RS at [69], [73].However, since the respondent accepts that the SCH 80 Evidence is “largely publicly available information”,112Foot Note 112×RS at [81].I do not think there are serious doubts as to its apparent credibility. The thirdLadd v Marshallcondition is satisfied.",
        "Hunt-Wesson factors": "111 For theHunt-Wessonfactors pertaining to the delay in adducing the SCH 80 Evidence and the potential significance of the new evidence, I repeat my earlier findings in respect of the relevantLadd v Marshallconditions (see [102], [109] and [110] above). 112 As for the remainingHunt-Wessonfactors discussed in connection with the Import Evidence,viz, prejudice, multiplicity of proceedings and public interest, I regard these as being neutral to the question of whether the SCH 80 Evidence should be admitted. The respondent accepts that the SCH 80 Terms are not distinctive of its goods and services, but are general descriptors. It follows that there will be no need to remit the matter to the TM Registrar to take further evidence relating to the SCH 80 Evidence, and that the resolution of the matter will not be prolonged if the SCH 80 Evidence is admitted. The prejudice spoken of at [71] and [84] above will not be caused by the admission of the SCH 80 Evidence.",
        "Conclusion on the Import Evidence": "97 As the Court of Appeal held inAnanGroup(at [59]), in assessing the proportionality of an application: … [T]he court is in every instance conducting a balancing exercise between the interests of finality of proceedings and the entitlement of a successful respondent to rely on a judgment in his favour on the one hand, and the right of the applicant to put forth relevant and credible evidence to persuade the appellate court that the justice of the case lies with him. … 98 On balance, I take the view that the applicant is attempting to take a second bite of the cherry by re-litigating the matter in light of the Import Evidence. Theprima faciepresumption in s 116A of the EA (which affects the second and thirdLadd v Marshallconditions as explained at [49]) and the possibility of multiplicity as described by the applicant (see [86] above) must be weighed against the following countervailing factors: (a) the applicant squandered multiple opportunities to adduce the Import Evidence before the TM Registrar (see [42]–[45] above);(b) allowing the application will cause prejudice which cannot be compensated by costs (see [71], [84] above); and(c) the credibility of material portions of the Import Evidence is questionable, ultimately preventing me from finding that the third and secondLadd v Marshallconditions are unsatisfied (see [67] above). 99 These countervailing factors show that the justice of the case does not call for the admission of the Import Evidence. The Court of Appeal inAnanat [45] made clear that “a disappointed party will not be allowed to retrieve lost ground by relying on evidence he should have put before the court below, especially when he has expressly elected to withhold that evidence”. Having made the strategic decision not to accept the Adjudicator’s offer to respond to the Respondent’s Unregistered Marks at the hearing below, the applicant now has to live by its choice. 100 Needless to say, the applicant’s conduct of this case leaves much to be desired. However, given the procedural context of this case (see [11], [44] above), I emphasise the need for greater discipline in drafting a Notice of Opposition and Counter-statement. I distil the following principles fromDEMON ALETrade Mark[2000] RPC 345 at 357–358 (“DEMON ALE”): (a) For the purpose of registration proceedings before the TM Registrar, a Notice of Opposition and Counter-statement are in effect pleadings (CLUB EUROPETrade Mark[2000] RPC 329 at 336): It is the function of pleadings to define the issues between the parties. Notices of opposition and counterstatements play the part of pleadings in contested trademark registration applications. To some extent supporting statutory declarations may be regarded as complementing that pleading function. (b) Each party’s pleadings must be full in the sense that they outline each of the grounds relied upon and state the case relied upon in support of those grounds (DEMON ALEat 357): Considerations of justice, fairness, efficiency and economy combine to make it necessary for the pleadings of the parties in Registry proceedings to provide a focused statement of the grounds upon which they intend to maintain that the tribunal should or should not do what it has been asked to do. The statement should not be prolix. It should, however, be full in the sense indicated by Mr Simon Thorley Q.C. inCOFFEEMIXTrade Mark[1998] R.P.C 717 at 722: “It must be full in the sense that it must outline each of the grounds … relied upon and state the case relied upon in support of those grounds. It should be as succinct as possible, but it must be complete”. (c) The pleadings should identify the issues to which the evidence will be directed, so that no party is taken by surprise (Julian Higgins’ Trade Mark Application[2000] RPC 321 at 326): If the pleadings do not identify the right issues, the issues the parties propose to argue about, then it cannot be expected that with any consistency the right evidence will be adduced at the hearing. The pleadings are supposed to identify the issues to which evidence will be directed. If the pleadings do not properly identify the issues someone, sooner or later, is going to be taken by surprise. (d) The TM Registrar has the power to direct parties to supplement incomplete pleadings under r 81B of the TMR. This rule provides that at any stage of the proceedings, the TM Registrar may direct any party to produce or file any document, information or evidence which the TM Registrar may reasonably require. Geoffrey Hobbs QC’s observations on a similar rule in UK are instructive (DEMON ALEat 357): If a party fails to provide sufficient information in his pleadings as to the nature or extent of the grounds upon which he relies, the registrar“may direct that such ….. information as he may reasonably require should befiled within such period as he may specify”under rule 51 of the Trade Marks Rules 1994. … A direction may be given under rule 51 by the registrar ... of his own motion or upon the application of a party to the proceedings before him.

        "Conclusion on the SCH 80 Evidence": "113 While the first and thirdLadd v Marshallconditions are satisfied, I decline to grant leave to adduce the SCH 80 Evidence. I see no reason to allow the application since the secondLadd v Marshallcondition is not fulfilled. Namely: (a) the respondent is not disputing the very fact that the SCH 80 Evidence seeks to prove – that the SCH 80 Terms are general descriptors; and (b) even if the SCH 80 Terms are general descriptors, as explained above at [103]–[106], there is another common identifier of the goods being sold in the Respondent-Agru Tech Invoices and Agru Tech-Singapore Consumers Invoices which show that the respondent’s goods were being sold by Agru Tech to other Singapore consumers.",
        "Conclusion": "114 I conclude by emphasising the importance of two points: (a) First, parties ought to produce all relevant evidence for opposition proceedings before the TM Registrar. Parties should not take the position that because opposition proceedings concern the registration of trade marks, leave will always be granted by the High Court to adduce further evidence in an appeal.(b) Second, parties must exercise discipline in drafting a Notice of Opposition and Counter-statement to clearly and concisely state the grounds each party relies on such that the real issues in dispute can be brought to light and the right evidence adduced. All trade marks relied on (whether registered or unregistered) must be specifically stated with the relevant details. 115 For all the foregoing reasons, SUM 1081 is dismissed. It follows that the respondent’s affidavits in reply to the applicant’s affidavits filed in support of its application in SUM 1081 are also inadmissible for the purposes of TA 2/2021. I will hear parties on costs separately.
