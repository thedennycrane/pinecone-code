        "The background": "10 The Petitioner is the holder of a Higher School Certificate. The\n\nRespondent obtained a certificate in art from the Baharuddin Vocational Institute.11 After leaving school, the Petitioner worked as an assistant manager\n\nfrom 1970 to 1971 in Mono Trading Company, which was his uncle’s sole proprietorship\n\nfirm. He was paid $400 a month. When Mono Trading Company was converted to a private\n\nlimited company known as Mono Trading Company Pte Ltd, the Petitioner was promoted to\n\nmanager. He left Mono Trading Company Pte Ltd sometime in 1979. His last drawn salary was\n\n$800 a month. From the date of the marriage in 1975, the Petitioner’s salaries went\n\ninto the pool from which drawings were made for the family’s expenses, investments\n\nand savings.12 While working for his uncle, the Petitioner learned from his younger\n\nbrother who was the section lead of the Anglo Chinese School band that the band needed\n\nuniforms for its members. Through the introduction of his brother, the Petitioner obtained\n\nthe order from the band’s teacher in charge to supply the uniforms. The order was\n\nsubcontracted and satisfactorily fulfilled. From this, the Petitioner saw the potential in\n\nstarting a family business to supply uniforms and costumes to schools. This led to the\n\nPetitioner setting up Volks International Enterprise after discussions with the\n\nRespondent.13 Volks International Enterprise was registered in 1975 with the\n\nRespondent as sole proprietress. I accepted the Petitioner’s explanation that this\n\nwas because he was still working for Mono Trading Company Pte Ltd. The registered address\n\nof the firm was 73 Ming Teck Park, Singapore, which was his father’s home. It was\n\nlater changed to 72 Circular Road which was his father’s clinic and medicine shop.\n\nHis father is a Chinese physician. It was the Petitioner who came up with the name and who\n\narranged for the firm’s letterhead to be designed by one of his friends. It was\n\nthrough the efforts of the Petitioner that the firm obtained orders from the\n\nExtra-Curricular Activities Centre of the Ministry of Education for supplying uniforms and\n\ncostumes to schools for the Youth Festival. Having had her training in art, the Respondent\n\nworked as the designer, with the Petitioner overseeing the management and business aspects\n\nof the firm.14 The Petitioner’s participation in the business is confirmed by\n\ninvoices with the Petitioner’s handwritten notes on them. The Petitioner also signed\n\noff as Manager.15 Although the Respondent was the designer, not much creative\n\ndesigning for uniforms and costumes was required, especially for uniforms as the designs\n\nwere pre-determined by the schools. When they went to the schools to obtain the orders,\n\nthe Respondent would take the measurements and the Petitioner would do the recording. He\n\nwould then sort out the measurements, obtain samples of textiles, confirm orders for\n\nmaterials and purchases, make arrangement to subcontract the orders, collect and deliver\n\nthe uniforms and bank in payments received.16 In 1979, they decided to go into the garment business as well. So\n\nthey set up Volks Fashion House. It was also registered with the Respondent as sole\n\nproprietress because the Petitioner was still working for Mono Trading Company Pte Ltd.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Petitioner resigned from Mono Trading Company Pte Ltd to attend\n\nfulltime to the two family businesses. His responsibilities included taking orders,\n\npricing the goods, displaying the goods, attending to customers, sales and purchasing,\n\nsupervising staff, stock-checking and finance. He even typed some of the invoices.17 The activities of both businesses were largely seasonal. In order to\n\nhave an even spread throughout the year, the Petitioner set up Aya Business Company in\n\n1981 with himself as sole proprietor. Its business was in wholesale supply of garments\n\nimported by Volks International Enterprise.18 The profits from these family businesses were drawn to maintain the\n\nfamily, and the excess channeled into savings and investments.19 In the meantime, although the Petitioner had resigned from Mono\n\nTrading Company Pte Ltd, he remained a guarantor for the company’s bank facilities at\n\nhis uncle’s request. When his uncle became ill with cancer, the company was unable to\n\npay its debts. The Petitioner as the guarantor for its debts was accordingly made a\n\nbankrupt in 1983. Because of his bankruptcy, Aya Business Company closed down.20 From 1984 to 1986, the Petitioner took up a part-time job at Robert\n\n& Stanley Credit Corporation while he continued to manage Volks International\n\nEnterprise and Volks Fashion House. He was paid by Robert & Stanley Credit Corporation\n\na salary of $1000 with commission averaging $500 per month. He paid monthly $70 to the\n\nOfficial Assignee and the balance was deposited into the Respondent’s bank account\n\nand/or went towards helping to pay for the family’s expenses.21 For two years from 1984, he also helped out at a bean sprout factory\n\nat night between 11.00 pm and 1.00 am. His earnings of about $2000 to $3000 a month were\n\npaid to Volks International Enterprise because he was still a bankrupt.22 In 1990, the Petitioner started working at his father’s clinic\n\nas a Chinese physician. At the same time, he took a part-time course in Chinese medicine,\n\nattending classes three nights a week. He was paid $2000 a month by his father. He\n\nmaintained his family with his salaries while continuing to help in the two family\n\nbusinesses on a part-time basis.23 From 1993 to 1995, the Petitioner set up his own practice as a\n\nChinese physician under the name and style of ‘Tan Khye Hua Chinese Physician’.\n\nBecause he was still a bankrupt, the business was registered with the Respondent as the\n\nsole proprietress. His earnings as a Chinese physician also went into the pool from which\n\nfunds were drawn for the family’s expenses and investments or accumulated as savings.24 In 1995, after his discharge from bankruptcy, the Petitioner\n\nrequested the Respondent to transfer to him the business name registration of ‘Tan\n\nKhye Hua Chinese Physician’, the Respondent refused. The Petitioner then registered\n\nhis own sole proprietorship ‘Khye Hua Chinese Physician’ under which he now\n\npractises as a Chinese physician.",

But she has made large withdrawals from time to time amounting to\n\n$309,448.86 and RM14,000. Except for $46,193.24 which were double entries, the Respondent\n\nhas not satisfactorily accounted for the balance and the large withdrawals made by her\n\nover the years.(vii) Shares. Even though the Respondent had admitted to withdrawing\n\n  $79,440.01 for the purchase of shares, the only shares disclosed was one lot of Eng Wah\n\n  Ltd shares worth $735.(viii) Volks Florists & Gifts, value not known.28 In division of matrimonial assets the factors that have to be taken\n\ninto account are set out in s.112 of the Women’s Charter. Matrimonial assets are\n\nassets acquired or improved upon by the parties during the marriage. To have an equitable\n\ndivision of the matrimonial assets, I must have regard to the contribution of the parties\n\nto their acquisition.29 The Respondent claimed that the assets were acquired by her from the\n\nprofits she made from Volks International Enterprise and Volks Fashion House. It is quite\n\nclear from the evidence that the Petitioner was actively involved in the running of the\n\ntwo firms. They were registered in the name of the Respondent because of the\n\nPetitioner’s employment with Mono Trading Company Pte Ltd. The bank accounts were\n\noperated and all the assets except the matrimonial flat were registered in the\n\nRespondent’s name because of the Petitioner’s bankruptcy. In any case, the\n\nprofits from the two businesses would not have enabled her to acquire so many properties.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1994, the average monthly profits was only $1273.09. Quite clearly, the\n\npayment for these assets were supplemented by contributions from the Petitioner’s\n\nsalaries and his other earnings from the various jobs he took on.30 I was therefore of the view that in the absence of clear evidence to\n\nthe contrary, the property should be treated as having been acquired by them jointly with\n\nequal contribution from each party. On this basis, I found the contributions of each party\n\nto the acquisition of the matrimonial assets to be as follows:(i)Matrimonial flatPetitionerRespondent(a) Initial capital payment$9,399.00-(b) Downpayment (cash) (taken on joint basis)$1,095$1,095(c) Initial renovations$10,000-(d) CPF (towards loan)$24,161-(e) Cash contribution (estimated, taken on joint basis)$7,326$7,326(f) Subsequent renovations (taken on joint basis)$16,000$16,000(g) Property Tax (23 years at about $100 per year)$2,300-$70,281$24,421(~ 74.21%)(~ 25.79%)(ii)Bukit Merah ClinicFrom the monthly payments evidenced by the cheques issued by the\n\n  Petitioner in favour of the Respondent and the bank-in slips of the same into the\n\n  Respondent’s DBS account no. 008-4906-8, the contribution of the Petitioner came up\n\n  to 88% and that of the Respondent 12%.(iii) The remaining matrimonial assets were acquired from the joint\n\nearnings and savings and hence financial contribution of the parties was 50:50.31 On non-financial contributions, there is no doubt that the\n\nRespondent would have played a bigger role in the care of the children and the home. This\n\nis usual in a family in which the spouses come from traditional Chinese backgrounds. The\n\nPetitioner also would have less time to devote to the family because of the various jobs\n\nhe held to supplement the income from the two businesses.32 Based on the financial and non-financial contributions of the\n\nparties, the Petitioner should be entitled to at least 50% of the matrimonial assets. But\n\ntaking into account the needs of each party and to avoid dislocation due to disposal of\n\nthe matrimonial assets on a 50:50 division, I made the orders appealed against. In the\n\ncase of the matrimonial flat, I ordered that the Respondent transfer her interest to the\n\nPetitioner so that he and the daughter and the son, if he later chooses to stay with the\n\nfather, could have a home to live in.33 I also ordered the Respondent to transfer the Bukit Merah Clinic to\n\nthe Petitioner because he needs it to carry on his practice as a Chinese physician. The\n\nRespondent was given the Ghim Moh Shophouse so that she could continue her business of\n\nVolks Florists & Gifts on a portion of the first storey and let out the remaining\n\nportion as before. The second storey could be her residence.34 The Respondent was allowed to retain whatever else was in her name\n\nincluding her unexplained vast cash withdrawals from her bank accounts into which their\n\njoint earnings were paid.35 On this basis, without taking into the account the rentals from the\n\nGhim Moh Shophouse and the Johore properties appropriated by her, the award worked out to\n\na division in the region of 45:55 per cent to the Petitioner and the Respondent\n\nrespectively.36 On maintenance for the son, the Petitioner was ordered to pay to the\n\nRespondent $350 a month with effect from 1 October 1999 as long as the son resides with\n\nher. In addition, the Petitioner is to pay for the son’s education, and his personal\n\nexpenses with a daily allowance. For the Respondent’s maintenance and upkeep, the\n\nPetitioner was ordered to pay her monthly $400 with effect from 1 October 1999. I made\n\nthis award bearing in mind her own income from Volks Florists & Gifts and the rentals\n\nthat she will continue to receive from the properties that she is to keep.37 On costs, these ancillary proceedings were as acrimonious as the\n\ndivorce proceedings because of the stand taken by the Respondent. She relied on the\n\nPetitioner’s bankruptcy to belittle the financial contribution of the Petitioner in\n\nthe acquisition of, and to deny him a share in, the assets registered and paid for with\n\nfunds from bank accounts in her name. This was what she stated in her affidavit of 24\n\nAugust 1999:\"His salary throughout was not enough to maintain the family and\n\n  himself [indeed from day 1 of the marriage he never gave me any maintenance for the family\n\n  until 19 years later (in June 1994) when he paid maintenance of $2500/- for the 1sttime]. He was a bankrupt for more than 12 years during which I gave him financial\n\n  assistance and moral support. During his bankruptcy, he studied part-time and helped in\n\n  his father’s shop and did not earn the kind of money which could help him acquire any\n\n  of the matrimonial assets (except part of the matrimonial flat as admitted). If not for my\n\n  hard work and efforts, there would be no matrimonial assets (except the flat) to fight\n\n  over.\"It was however clear to me these matrimonial assets were acquired and\n\nthe bank accounts operated in the Respondent’s name, because of the Petitioner’s\n\nbankruptcy. But when it came to maintenance, she claimed a sum of $103,800 as amount short\n\npaid over the years, dating her claims back to June 1994 when the Petitioner was still a\n\nbankrupt. As these ancillary proceedings had been unnecessarily protracted by the stand\n\ntaken by the Respondent, I ordered her to pay two-thirds of the Petitioner’s taxed\n\ncosts.GOH JOON SENGJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
