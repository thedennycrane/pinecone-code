        "Section 216A": "11     Section 216A received the attention of the Court of Appeal inPang Yong Hock v PKS Contracts Services Pte Ltd[2004] 3 SLR 1(“Pang Yong Hock”). The Court referred to earlier decisions of the High Court inTeo Gek Luang v Ng Ai Tiong[1999] 1 SLR 434(“Teo Gek Luang”) andAgus Irawan v Toh Teck Chye[2002] 2 SLR 198(“Agus Irawan”) with approval. InTeo Gek Luang, Lai Kew Chai J held at [15] that when an application under s 216A was made: [T]he court at the leave stage was not called upon to adjudicate on the disputes of facts and inferences, relying merely on affidavit evidence. Those matters would be for trial. The court had to see if there was prima facie merit to it. Similarly, inAgus Irawan, where the question was where the burden to prove good faith lay, Choo Han Teck JC held that it was for the party opposing the s 216A application to show that it was not made in good faith. 12     The Court of Appeal explained at [19] ofPang Yong Hockthat s 216A was enacted: for the protection of genuinely aggrieved minority interests and for doing justice to a company while ensuring that the company’s directors are not unduly hampered in their management decisions by loud but unreasonable dissidents attempting to drive the corporate vehicle from the back seat. 13     Regarding the “good faith” requirement in ss (3)(b), the Court held at [20] that: The best way of demonstrating good faith is to show a legitimate claim which the directors are unreasonably reluctant to pursue with the appropriate vigour or at all. Naturally, the parties opposing a s 216A application will seek to show that the application is motivated by an ulterior purpose, such as dislike, ill-feeling or other personal reasons, rather than by the applicant’s concern for the company. Hostility between the factions involved is bound to be present in most of such applications. It is therefore generally insufficient evidence of lack of good faith on the part of the applicant. However, if the opposing parties are able to show that the applicant is so motivated by vendetta, perceived or real, that his judgment will be clouded by purely personal considerations, that may be sufficient for the court to find a lack of good faith on his part. An applicant’s good faith would also be in doubt if he appears set on damaging or destroying the company out of sheer spite or worse, for the benefit of a competitor. It will also raise the question whether the intended action is going to be in the interests of the company at all. To this extent, there is an interplay of the requirements in s 216A(3)(b) and (c). 14     It went on at [21] to state that in deciding on the “interests of the company” requirement in ss (3)(c), a court must: weigh all the circumstances and decide whether the claim ought to be pursued. Whether the company stands “to gain substantially in money or in money’s worth” (perChoo JC inAgus Irawan) relates more to the issue of whether it is in the interests of the company to pursue the claim rather than whether the claim is meritorious or not. A $100 claim may be meritorious but it may not be expedient to commence an action for it. The company may have genuine commercial considerations for not wanting to pursue certain claims. Perhaps it does not want to damage a good, long-term, profitable relationship. It could also be that it does not wish to generate bad publicity for itself because of some important negotiations which are underway. The interests of a company are, of course, not to be measured only in monetary terms. A company may engage in litigation over matters with no monetary implication, e.g. its employment policy. 15     The Court added at [22] that in deciding whether to approve an application for leave to commence a derivative action: the court should also consider whether there is another adequate remedy available, such as the winding up of the company (Barrett v Duckett[1995] 1 BCLC 243).",
        "Good faith": "16     The first proposed defendant averred in his affidavit that the proposed derivative action was motivated by the second plaintiff’s personal vendetta against the proposed defendants. The first proposed defendant then went on to set out a history of the alleged acrimony going back to the mid-1990s. 17     The second proposed defendant in his affidavit deposed that the second plaintiff had, in 2004, wanted the proposed defendants to buy him out of the company on his terms. The proposed defendants found his terms unreasonable and rejected them. The second proposed defendant contended that the sole motivating factor in this application was to coerce the proposed defendants to accept those terms. 18     There is no doubt that there had been serious disagreements between the plaintiffs (particularly the second plaintiff) and the proposed defendants (particularly the second proposed defendant) for more than a decade. There is still a strong degree of distrust and personal hostility between them. But such sentiments, however deep, do not constitute bad faith. As the Court of Appeal had explained inPang Yong Hockat [20]: Hostility between the factions involved is bound to be present in most of such applications. It is therefore generally insufficient evidence of lack of good faith on the part of the applicant. However, if the opposing parties are able to show that the applicant is so motivated by vendetta, perceived or real, that his judgment will be clouded by purely personal considerations, that may be sufficient for the court to find a lack of good faith on his part. 19     The good faith requirement for making an application for leave to bring an action in the name of a company is satisfied when the applicant is shown to be acting in the interests of the company. As the purpose of derivative actions is to promote the interests of the company, a personal dislike for the proposed defendants will not defeat such an application unless the application is merely an extension of that animosity and is not made with the intention to promote or protect the company’s interests. 20     The derivative action provisions in our Companies Act are modelled on the provisions in the Canada Business Corporations Act R.S.C. 1985, c. C–44. Section 216A(2) and (3) of our Act are similar to s 239(1) and (2) of the Canadian act. For this reason, decisions on the relevant Canadian provisions are useful guides to the construction of our provisions. InIntercontinental Precious Metals Inc. v Cooke[1994] 4 WWR 66, a decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court, Tysoe J ruled that the fact that there is a shareholder battle does not lead to the inference that an application is motivated by bad faith. InPrimex Investments Ltd v Northwest Sports Enterprises Ltd[1996] 4 WWR 54, another decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court, Tysoe J held that in a situation where an applicant was acting out of self-interest in wanting to prosecute a derivative action in the name of a company, and the applicant’s self-interest coincided with the interests of the company, the applicant’s self-interest did not mean that his application was made in bad faith. 21     A derivative action can be struck out if it is not prosecuted in good faith. InBarrett v Duckett & Ors[1995] 1 BCLC 243(“Barrett”), the English Court of Appeal struck out a derivative action brought by a shareholder of a company against her former son-in-law and his wife by a subsequent marriage. Peter Gibson LJ found, at 245, that: On its face it is an action brought by a shareholder to right grievous wrongs done to the company of which she is a shareholder. But unfortunately the circumstances in which the action is brought and pursued include a bitter matrimonial dispute between the plaintiff’s daughter and the primary defendant. That bitterness appears to have infected decisions taken in relation to these proceedings, added to which there has been a notable lack of realism on the part of the plaintiff and her advisers. The litigation, even though it has not progressed beyond certain interlocutory steps, appears to have exhausted the finances of the plaintiff and, while the amounts claimed for the company are large, to an objective observer the likelihood of significant recoveries seems very small indeed. The two individual defendants who have been served with the proceedings are on legal aid. The result so far is that this litigation has been ruinous to the plaintiff and has caused heavy costs to be incurred by the public purse.  22     The learned judge found that personal rather than financial considerations appeared to be impelling the plaintiff to pursue the action, and he was convinced that the plaintiff was not pursuing the action bona fide on behalf of the company. He struck out the action with the concurrence of Beldam LJ and Russell LJ. 23     In the present case, there is a history of hostility between the plaintiffs and the proposed defendants. However, the plaintiffs cannot be said to be motivated by personal rather than financial considerations in pursuing their disputes with the proposed defendants and the company. 24     If the proposed action succeeds, there will be benefits to the company, and to them as shareholders of the company. Their good faith in making the application cannot be impugned by their grievances over the proposed defendants’ rejection of their claims in respect of the Lau Family Trust and the Family Assets.",
        "The interests of the company": "25     A derivative action is in the interests of the company when it is prosecuted for the benefit of the company. The benefit should be real – in monetary or other terms – in order to justify the costs and effort of pursuing the action when the company itself had not proceeded with the action. Towards this end, an applicant should not only identify causes of action and allege breach of fiduciary duties, breach of contract, negligence, etc, but also show that the company had sustained or may sustain real loss or damage as a result of these failures and that there are some prospects of obtaining relief or redress through the proposed action. 26     It is therefore necessary to look at each complaint set out in[5], and ascertain if it is in the company’s interests to have it litigated. I will refer to each complaint as it is enumerated in para 8 of the draft statement of claim. Complaint (a) 27     This concerns a payment of $4,406,589.23 from the company’s overdraft account to the fictitious Hawker Enterprise Ltd which the company should not have made. This is a claim in the interests of the company. Complaint (b)(i) 28     The complaint is that out of a sum of $487,405.99 withdrawn in 2001 for payments to the first plaintiff and the three proposed defendants, the first plaintiff did not receive his share of $53,166.75. The complaint is also that $5,000 of the sum withdrawn was unaccounted for. The first plaintiff has not deposed any affidavit or made any complaint to the company that he did not receive the payment. Neither plaintiff referred to the $5,000 allegedly unaccounted for in their respective affidavits. It is not in the interests of the company to make a claim so bereft of substance. Complaint (b)(iii) 29     This involves the use of $2 million of the company’s monies to purchase a property in Marsiling. The property was transferred to a company, the shareholders of which were the second proposed defendant and his brother. The property was subsequently sold for more than $18 million. It is in the company’s interests to pursue this claim. Complaint (b)(iv) 30     The plaintiffs are unhappy that the company purchased a property in Shenzhen without a proper valuation or the company’s approval. There is no allegation that the company sustained loss as a result of the purchase. The plaintiffs have not shown that it is in the interests of the company to pursue this matter. Complaint (c) 31     This complaint relates to false trades between the company and Drilbo, whereby the company made payments to Drilbo’s invoices for these transactions. It is in the company’s interests to sue the proposed defendants over these payments. Complaints (d) and (e) 32     These complaints relate to false transactions with two other companies, Manfield and Aichi. However, there are no allegations that the company had made payments or incurred any liabilities in these transactions. For this reason, the plaintiffs have not shown that it is in the company’s interests to sue the proposed defendants over these transactions. Complaints (f) (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (vi) and (vii) 33     These were complaints concerning the forgery of the second plaintiff’s signature on company documents, the late payment of dividends to the second plaintiff, the failure to notify the plaintiffs of company meetings, the filing of the company’s annual returns before the company’s accounts were approved by the company and the failure to have the company’s accounts properly audited. The plaintiffs made no assertion that these acts and omissions had placed the company in a position where it would be in its interests to sue the proposed defendants over these matters. Complaint (f) (v) 34     Complaint (f) (v) differs from complaints (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (vi) and (vii). It relates to the first and second proposed defendants’ use of company funds to purchase a property in Hong Kong and the proposed defendants’ failure to account for this property and the income generated from it. A derivative action on this matter is in the interests of the company. Complaint (g) 35     This arises out of the company’s involvement in tax evasion which resulted in the company having to pay a composition fine of $4,573,167.33. Since the company incurred loss, this claim which may result in recovery of the loss from the proposed defendants is in the company’s interests.",
        "Alternative remedy of winding up": "36     InPang Yong Hock, the Court of Appeal did not authorise a derivative action and upheld the trial court’s ruling that the company should be wound up instead. In its decision, the Court of Appeal referred to and agreed with Peter Gibson LJ’s statement inBarrett(at 250) that: if another adequate remedy is available, the court will not allow the derivative action to proceed. 37     InBarrett, a winding up petition had been filed before the derivative action. InPang Yong Hock, the winding up petition had not been filed when the trial judge had dismissed the application. However, it was filed by the time the appeal came before the Court of Appeal. 38     The company inBarrettwas in a deadlock because of disagreements between the two parties, each of whom held 50% of the company’s shares. The company had ceased trading and was probably insolvent. InPang Yong Hock, there was a deadlock in the company because two factions of shareholders were unable to co-exist. The company had not filed its statutory accounts or held the statutory meetings. 39     In the present case, no petition has been filed. In December 2006, the second proposed defendant gave notice for the directors of the company to resolve that the company be wound up voluntarily so that “all shareholders get their share in the company fairly”, but the proposal was not taken up and no further action was taken. The second proposed defendant did not allude to this proposal in his affidavit, and the notice came up in these proceedings only as an exhibit in the second plaintiff’s affidavit. The proposed defendants have not stated in their affidavits that they intend to wind up the company, nor have they stated that winding up is an appropriate solution to the disputes between the parties. None of the parties in the present case has asserted that the company is in deadlock or insolvent; nor have they deposed that it has ceased to trade or that it may not be able to continue to trade. 40     While the winding up of a company may be preferable to the prosecution of derivative actions inBarrettandPang Yong Hock, this does not apply to the present case.",
        "Conclusion": "41     Leave is granted to the plaintiffs to bring an action on behalf of the company against the proposed defendants on the complaints that I found are in the interests of the company to pursue. Each party is to pay its own costs in this application. 42     The plaintiffs are to have conduct of the action including any execution proceedings. I will not make any order on the plaintiffs’ prayer that the company pay the plaintiffs’ costs in the action on an indemnity basis. I will leave that to the trial judge, as the appropriate costs order will have to take into account the manner in which the action is prosecuted."
