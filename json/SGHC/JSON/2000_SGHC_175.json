        "Maintenance": "7. In October 1999, when the parties first\n\nfiled their affidavits in relation to the ancillary matters, both parties were in steady\n\nemployment and earning regular incomes. The husband was an industrial engineer with a\n\ngross monthly salary of $4,000 and a take home pay of $3,200. He estimated his expenses as\n\nbeing $2,929 per month and this included expenditure on his children when they were with\n\nhim, an allowance for his parents and transport costs. He resided in the matrimonial flat\n\nand the instalments for the flat were met in equal parts by contributions from his and the\n\nwife’s CPF monies.8. The wife was also an industrial\n\nengineer. At the time of the hearing, she and the children were living with her sister and\n\nbrother-in-law and their children. The wife received a gross pay of $3,574 and after\n\ndeductions for CPF ($714) and an item called ESPP, her take-home pay each month amounted\n\nto $2,499.60. She put her own monthly and household expenses at $1,542. This included\n\nsalary and levy for the maid amounting to $700, food of $400 and transport of $200. She\n\nestimated the children’s monthly expenses as coming to $1,599 per month, a figure\n\nthat the husband challenged. He considered their expenses to be not more than $800 a\n\nmonth.9. In an affidavit filed in late December\n\n1999, the wife stated that she had been given notice that her services with her then\n\nemployer would no longer be required and that she would be retrenched with effect from 31\n\nJanuary 2000.10. The learned District Judge awarded a\n\ntotal sum of $1,200 as monthly maintenance for the wife and children as she was of the\n\nview that this amount was reasonable in the light of the wife and children’s\n\nexpenses. This was a sum that was well within the husband’s capabilities considering\n\nthat he took home $3,200 a month. The District Judge noted that monthly he spent $950 on\n\nhis car and some $300 on insurance policies. She was obviously of the view that these were\n\nluxuries and the expenditure could, if necessary, be reduced so as to allow him to meet\n\nhis maintenance obligations.11. When I first heard the appeal on this\n\nissue, the material before me was the same as that which had been before the District\n\nJudge. At that stage, I considered that the children’s expenses had been somewhat\n\ninflated by the wife and that at the tender ages of five and two, they were unlikely to\n\nrequire as many expensive classes as she had put in her list. I thought it would also be\n\nuseful to distinguish between the maintenance paid for the children and that paid for the\n\nwife as these were separate issues and a lump sum would have a tax impact that could be\n\nreduced if separate awards were made.12. The children’s monthly expenses\n\nas itemised by the wife were as follows:Child care for Ren Xiang\n\n      (older son)$ 250Phonics classes$ 40Medical$ 40Diapers$ 55Milk powder$ 130Fish$ 80Haircut$ 12Entertainment/toys$ 251Clothing$ 111Festive occasions\n\n      (birthday/Lantern festival/Chinese New Year)$ 57Stationery$ 30Books$ 123Swimming/organ classes$ 200Tuition$ 120Pocket money$ 60Savings for children$ 40_______$1,599====13. Looking at that list, I considered the\n\nexpenses to be on the high side especially in relation to entertainment, stationery and\n\nbooks, swimming classes and tuition. The items listed as ‘pocket money’ and\n\n‘savings for children’ were unnecessary. I considered that $1,200 a month would\n\nbe more than adequate to maintain these children at this stage. Once they went to primary\n\nschool, the expenses might increase but, for the moment, the sum would be sufficient. I\n\nalso considered that the father should bear a higher proportion of the children’s\n\nexpenses than the mother should since he was the higher income earner. I therefore ordered\n\nhim to pay $800 a month as their maintenance.14. As for the wife’s expenses, I\n\nconsidered that most of these could be met from her own income. The husband, however,\n\nshould contribute to her maintenance as he was in a financial position to do so and the\n\nwife should be able to maintain a reasonable standard of living. For the time being I\n\nconsidered a contribution of $200 a month from the husband to be sufficient. In this\n\nconnection, I noted that although the wife had been retrenched from her previous\n\nemployment, the terms of the entrenchment were generous. She was entitled to receive one\n\nmonth’s salary for each year of service with her former employer. As she had worked\n\nthere since 1989, this amounted to about ten months’ salary. Further, she would get\n\ncompensation for accumulated leave. Although she had been retrenched, it seemed unlikely\n\nthat the wife would be unemployed for long. At that stage, the wife appeared to be well\n\ncapable of continuing to earn a decent living. She also had considerable financial\n\nresources.15. As stated earlier, on 28 April, the\n\nwife filed a further affidavit. In this, she set out tables of the family’s revised\n\nmonthly expenses with effect from January 2000. In total these amounted to $4,131.83 an\n\nincrease of almost $1,000 or 31.5% over the figures given only seven months earlier. The\n\nwife also gave information about her then employment position. She stated that she was\n\nworking as a software engineer on a three-month contract ending on 20 May 2000. As such,\n\nshe earned a basic salary of $2,300 per month and had a net salary of $1,839 per month.\n\nShe had been employed on a project basis and had flexible hours. She had a certain quota\n\nof work to complete a day, which she did by working on her computer at home.16. When the issue of maintenance was\n\nbrought up again on 26 May, I had to consider whether I should restore the District\n\nJudge’s order on maintenance or whether the variation I had made to that order should\n\nstand. There was no question of my raising the total amount awarded as maintenance since\n\nthe wife had not appealed against the lower court’s decision. Despite having filed an\n\naffidavit that showed an apparent increase in her expenses, the wife made little attempt\n\nto argue that the original maintenance order should be restored. Instead, her main focus\n\nwas the flat and through her counsel she indicated that she was willing to waive all claim\n\nfor maintenance for herself and the children in return for an order that the flat be\n\ntransferred to her on the basis that she had a 50% share in it and would pay the husband\n\naccordingly.17. Looking through the wife’s\n\naffidavit of 18 April, I noted that instead of claiming an expense of $700 a month for the\n\nmaid’s employment expenses, she claimed a sum of $600 a month as a fee paid to her\n\nsister for the use of the maid’s services and lodging. It turned out that the maid\n\nwas employed by the sister rather than the wife. Then there was a substantial increase in\n\nthe family’s food needs: from $610 in October to $1,350 in April (calculated on the\n\nbasis of five dollars per person per meal per day for each of three daily meals). Her\n\nexpenditure on insurance policies had increased by $100 and she also claimed the cost of\n\ncourse fees at $5,253 per annum or $487.75 per month.18. As for the children, the older\n\nchild’s expenses came up to $519 a month of which $126 was for toys and outings and\n\n$50 was for books and stationery whilst the younger’s came up to $487 a month of\n\nwhich $80 was for entertainment and $35 for books and study aids. Even on the revised\n\nfigures, the children’s expenses totalled only $1,006 (including milk powder but\n\nexcluding other food). Once food costs were added, I estimated her expenditure on the boys\n\nwould not exceed $1,300. The maintenance award I had made was not out of line with these\n\nexpenses and I did not think it was necessary to change it.19. As for the wife’s own expenses,\n\nit seemed to me that she was re-calculating them for maximum benefit. I could not\n\nunderstand how they could have changed so much in a few months especially considering that\n\nover those few months her income had, according to her, gone down. Yet her expenditure had\n\nincreased. The wife produced a receipt from a computer school showing that she had paid\n\nthem fees of $3,283.64 in December 1999 and a receipt from the Singapore Institute of\n\nManagement dated 20 January 2000 for $5,253 which was apparently charged to her as fees\n\nfor three separate courses. It appeared that the wife had decided to undertake these\n\ncourses after the divorce. There was no explanation as to why she had found it necessary\n\nto do this (or take so many courses) and whilst professional upgrading is always a\n\ncommendable undertaking, I did not think that in the present circumstances she could use\n\nthe expenditure to justify a reinstatement of the original maintenance order. In any case,\n\nit was clear that the wife was quite willing to give up maintenance from the husband in\n\nreturn for the flat. It appeared to me that in making this offer, she must have done her\n\nsums and decided that she was able to support herself even if she had to forego any\n\ncontribution from the husband. In that light, I considered there was no good reason why I\n\nshould vary the decision I had made on maintenance on 13 April.",
        "The matrimonial flat": "20. The matrimonial flat was unit #14-644\n\nat Block 587 Hougang Avenue 4. It was purchased in January 1997 and thus at the time of\n\nthe ancillary hearing, five years had not elapsed from the date of purchase. Accordingly,\n\nit could not be sold in the open market. The learned District Judge held that in these\n\ncircumstances, the flat had no market value. She also noted that the wife would not be in\n\na financial position to keep the flat and assume the mortgage loan of over $200,000. In\n\nfact the wife had not even asked for this. Neither could the husband retain the flat\n\nbecause he did not have a family nucleus. That being the case, the learned District Judge\n\ndecided that the flat was not an asset that could be divided between the parties and the\n\nonly option left to her was to order that it be surrendered to the HDB.21. The husband’s position on appeal\n\nwas that he would be able to form the family nucleus needed to take over the flat as his\n\nparents were willing to sell their own flat and move in with him. He therefore wanted the\n\nDistrict Judge’s decision set aside and the wife ordered to transfer her share in the\n\nflat to him. It should be noted that his original submission that the flat should be\n\ntransferred to him was based on his application for custody of the children, which, if\n\nsuccessful, would have given him the required family nucleus. At the hearing below, once\n\nit was decided that custody should remain with the wife, the husband did not, apparently,\n\nqualify to retain the flat. By the time the matter was heard before me, however, the\n\nsituation had changed. The HDB had indicated that they would be willing to regard the\n\nhusband and his parents as a family unit as long as the parents sold their existing flat.22. The wife’s initial position as\n\nshown in the submissions of her counsel tendered on 13 April was that the decision of the\n\nDistrict Judge was correct as the wife had obtained custody of the children and the\n\nhusband was unable to form a separate family nucleus. She also submitted that she would\n\nnot be in a financial position to retain the flat and thus the only option open to the\n\ncourt was to confirm the surrender of the flat to the HDB.23. By the time the issue of the division\n\nof the flat was argued at length on 26 May, the wife had completely changed her position.\n\nShe now wanted the flat to be transferred to her on the basis that she needed a home for\n\nherself and the children and that this would be the best home. She was willing to forego\n\nmaintenance for herself and the children if the court would order that the transfer take\n\nplace on the basis of each party having an equal share in the premises. It should be noted\n\nhere that the husband was willing to allow the wife an equal share in the flat if it was\n\ntransferred to him and she agreed to forego maintenance. If not, he considered that her\n\ninterest in it did not exceed 35%.24. Since the parties were now actively\n\ndisputing each other’s share in the flat, my first task was to determine what\n\nfinancial contributions each of them had made to its acquisition. The wife calculated her\n\ncontributions as amounting to $87,104.74 whilst the husband’s contributions were\n\n$124,818.06. In coming to these totals, she attributed the amount of $70,000, which had\n\nbeen spent on renovating the flat, to the parties in equal shares. This sum had been\n\nderived from the parties’ gains from the sale of an earlier flat at Bedok and the\n\nwife’s contention was that they were equally entitled to these. In terms of direct\n\ncontributions therefore, the wife averred that she had contributed 41% of the cost of\n\nacquisition of the flat and the husband had contributed 58%.25. The husband did not accept that the\n\nproceeds of sale of the Bedok flat belonged equally to the parties. He calculated his\n\ncontributions to the acquisition of that flat as amounting to $40,000 (67% of the cost),\n\nmade up of $27,000 from CPF and $13,000 cash contribution. He put the wife’s\n\ncontributions at $20,000 (33%) coming entirely from CPF. In her affidavit in reply the\n\nwife accepted that the husband had contributed $40,000 to the Bedok flat in the manner\n\nasserted by him. She, however, disagreed that her contribution had been only $20,000. She\n\nsaid that the payment from her CPF funds had been $20,709.50. Additionally, she had paid\n\n$1,000 as a cash deposit, a further $5,000 in cash and the agent’s fee of $660. The\n\ndocuments which the wife produced showed that she had withdrawn $3,000 from her savings\n\naccount in October 1992 and a further $660, described as agent’s fees, in December\n\n1992. She also produced evidence from the CPF Board showing the withdrawal of $20,709.50.\n\nAll in all, the wife was able to show a contribution of $24,369.50 to the Bedok flat. This\n\nmeant she had contributed 37.8% of its cost and the husband had contributed 62.2%.26. Coming back to the matrimonial flat, I\n\naccepted that the wife’s share of the $70,000 spent on renovation was $26,600 (having\n\nrounded up the 37.8% to 38%) and thus together with her CPF contributions she had\n\ncontributed altogether $66,419.06. As for the husband, I took his CPF contributions of\n\n$83,267.57 and added the sum of $47,400 representing his share of the renovation cost and\n\nthe sum of $8,000 that he had paid in cash. This $8,000 was evidenced to my satisfaction\n\nby the husband’s POSB account book. The husband’s total contribution was\n\ntherefore $134,667.37. In terms of percentage therefore, the wife contributed 33% and the\n\nhusband 67%.27. I next had to consider the wife’s\n\nnon-financial contributions. She asked the court to take into account the following\n\nfactors:(a) after she left the matrimonial flat in\n\n  October 1998, the husband had rent free occupation of the flat;(b) he paid no maintenance for the\n\n  children and her until the ancillary orders were made in January 2000;(c) she had been and still was the\n\n  children’s primary care giver.28. I noted that this was a relatively\n\nshort marriage: the parties lived together for five and a half years. Throughout the\n\nmarriage, the wife held down a full time job. Once the children came, they were looked\n\nafter by babysitters for substantial periods though the main responsibility remained with\n\nthe wife especially when the husband was away in 1995/1996. After the wife left the\n\nmatrimonial home, the children were cared for by the husband and his parents until June\n\n1999 when she was able to gain their custody pursuant to an interim custody order to which\n\nthe husband consented. In the circumstances, I put the wife’s non-financial\n\ncontribution to the marriage at ten percent.29. The matrimonial flat is an executive\n\napartment with a floor area of approximately 140 square metres. It has three bedrooms, a\n\nstudy, a storeroom, two bathrooms, a living cum dining and a kitchen. The valuation\n\ncarried out in April 2000 valued it at $480,000. This valuation was made on the basis of\n\nwhat the flat would be considered worth if the parties wanted a mortgage loan. The flat\n\ncould not be valued on an open market basis as it was not saleable. At that time, the\n\noutstanding mortgage loan was approximately $205,000. The equity which the parties had in\n\nthe flat was therefore worth around $275,000.30. As I had found that the wife should be\n\ngiven a 43% share in the flat for both her financial and non-financial contributions to\n\nthe flat and the family, she would have had to pay the husband some $156,750 in order to\n\nbuy over his 57% share in it. The wife had urged me very strongly to let her take over the\n\nflat by paying the husband only 50% of its equity value on the basis that she would forego\n\nmaintenance for herself and the boys. I did not accept this submission. The children are\n\nyoung. Their expenses are likely to increase and I did not consider it correct to take\n\naway their right to maintenance from their father at this early stage of their lives. The\n\nwife might be confident of being able to support them in the future but one cannot\n\ndiscount any number of contingencies happening which could either impair or remove her\n\nability to support the family. Further, the husband’s ability to support his children\n\nmight increase over time and if such an order was made it would prevent the children from\n\nenjoying the fruits of such an increase in income.31. The wife also sought to impress upon\n\nme that she had the better claim to the flat as the children needed a roof over their\n\nheads. This was true. It was not in my judgment necessary, however, that they should have\n\nthat particular roof over their heads. They were young and adaptable and were not of an\n\nage to be adversely affected by a change in homes. There was nothing to stop the wife from\n\npurchasing a smaller but adequate flat in the resale market. In any case, until the appeal\n\nshe had not found it necessary to ask for the flat. She was quite content for it to go\n\nback to the HDB and for herself and the boys to remain at her sister’s home for the\n\ntime being.32. In this case, there was no question of\n\nselling the flat in the open market. It had to go to either the husband or the wife.\n\nWhilst I could have ordered the husband to transfer his share in the flat to the wife in\n\nreturn for payment of $156,750 or thereabouts, I did not consider that the wise course to\n\ntake. According to the submissions made on behalf of the wife in early April, she was not\n\nin a financial position to retain the flat. Nothing had changed in May. Further, the\n\nwife’s CPF monies were not sufficient to pay the husband off entirely. She would have\n\nhad to find cash of at least $50,000 and would also have to take on the burden of the\n\nexisting mortgage that was at that time being serviced equally by both parties. That would\n\nhave been a financial strain. I did not think it right to put the wife in that position.\n\nOn the face of it, the husband was the higher income earner and would find it easier to\n\nservice the loan. He would have also help from his parents. With the money that the wife\n\ngot from the husband and her existing funds in CPF, she would be in a very good position\n\nto buy an adequate home for herself and the children without burdening herself too\n\ngreatly.33. For the above reasons, I allowed the\n\nhusband’s appeal in relation to the flat and ordered the wife to transfer her share\n\nin it to him.34. Having thought about the matter\n\nfurther, there is one additional order that I should have made in order to be fair to the\n\nwife. That is that the husband should, as from the date of my order, service 57% of the\n\nmonthly instalment due on the mortgage loan on the flat. Alternatively, he would at the\n\ntime of transfer have to reimburse her, in addition to her share in its equity, the total\n\nexcess amount she had contributed to all instalments from the date of my order. This,\n\nhowever, is something that can be remedied by the appellate court if the wife does not\n\nsucceed in her appeal.Costs35. The husband asked for the costs of the\n\nappeal. He pointed out that he had largely succeeded in that he had obtained more liberal\n\naccess, the maintenance amount payable to the wife had been reduced and his appeal on the\n\nmatrimonial property had been allowed. Further, the wife had prolonged the appeal by\n\nmaking further arguments on access and maintenance on which she did not succeed. I\n\nconsidered that the husband had been largely successful in his appeal although he had\n\nfailed to change the custody order. I therefore ordered that the wife pay a portion of the\n\nhusband’s costs of appeal fixed at $3,000 which sum was to be deducted from the\n\nentitlement in respect of the transfer of the flat.Judith PrakashJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
