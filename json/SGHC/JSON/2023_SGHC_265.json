        "The fourth charge: Culpable Homicide (s 304(b)of the Penal Code)": "9 Taking first the charge of killing Umaisyah.  Your callous, despicable act ended her life.  Not only in the physical assault, but in failing to call for assistance. 10 The prosecution seeks the imposition under the law in force at the time of the offence of the maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment as well as 12 strokes of the cane even though you have pleaded guilty.  Your lawyers have argued for seven years’ imprisonment. 11 While normally a plea of guilt would attract a reduction in sentence because of the saving of time and resources, your acts here were so reprehensible and your criminal responsibility so great, that I agree with the prosecution’s submission that the maximum sentence should be imposed on you.  The maximum sentence is left usually for the worst cases.  I am satisfied that your killing of Umaisyah is among the worst cases of culpable homicide.  You had slapped her on her face so much that she went weak; she had to sit on the floor; she then stopped crying and gasped for air.  Blood was in her mouth and liquid came out of her mouth or nose.  She suffered from a concussive seizure.  Umaisyah jerked a few times, and only the white parts of her eyes were visible, her lips turned blue, and she stopped breathing.  You did not get medical assistance because you and your wife were afraid that you would get into trouble for causing her injuries and you were also worried that you would be arrested for drug consumption.  Neither is an excuse.  Had you called for medical help there was perhaps some chance of Umaisyah being helped and treated; there was some chance of Umaisyah living. 12 Slapping a 2½-year-old child to such an extent that she would stop breathing and suffer a concussive seizure is unbelievable.  It was nothing less than the infliction of gratuitous violence without regard for her safety and well-being.  You did so even though she was but a toddler, defenceless and vulnerable, not capable clearly of being able to withstand the violence inflicted, and capable of little else but to cry in response to it.  She could not resist, she could not fight back, she could not run away.  What you did went beyond any level of reasonable discipline; it was vicious, callous, and heinous. 13 Against these points, what was raised in your mitigation did not help you.  It is said that this was not premediated, and in the spur of the moment.  It may be that the attack was not planned, but it is clear from the other charges that you are a violent person, ready to strike and to hit.  The fact that you did not plan to hit counts for little.  The fact that after your assault you tried to resuscitate her could not help you either. 14 I am satisfied that the maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment should be imposed on you.  I am also satisfied that you should suffer 12 strokes of the cane.  These sentences are in line with the guidance given in cases such asPublic Prosecutor v AFR[2011] 3 SLR 833 andPublic Prosecutorv BDB[2018] 1 SLR 127 (“Public Prosecutor v BDB”).",
        "The eight charge: Abuse (s 5(5)(b)of the Children and Young Persons Act)": "15 You are charged with ill-treating your stepchild, who was about six at the time, by causing him unnecessary physical suffering by hitting him over a year or so, with a belt, a hanger, and your hand; slapping; and punching him.  The prosecution seeks imprisonment of 30 to 36 months.  Your lawyers have sought between 24 to 30 months’ imprisonment. 16 Your ready resort not just to violence, but to abuse those in your care, who looked to you for love, care, and protection, is deplorable.  There is little to operate by way of mitigation.  You need to be punished severely for what you have done, and others who may behave like you have to be deterred from doing the same. 17 Terms of imprisonment of between six months and one year were imposed inPublic Prosecutor v BDBandPublic Prosecutor v Azlin bte Arujunah and other appeals[2022] 2 SLR 825.  These were for less persistent and less continued abuse than what you did here.  I hereby impose a sentence of three years’ imprisonment on this charge.",
        "The first charge: Rioting (s 147 of the Penal Code)": "18 The offence covered by your rioting charge, involved you and the others with you punching and kicking the victim after pulling the victim out of a van.  The victim suffered bleeding in the brain, fractures around the eye, and bruising and swelling of his left ear, with a total of three days’ hospitalisation.  You had pulled your ex-girlfriend out of the taxi that she was trying to leave in and took her away in your vehicle.  The rioting occurred in in the early hours of the morning, along Beach Road.  Again, you show an inclination to violence and a disregard and disrespect for the law.  You committed this offence while on the run from the drug supervision centre. 19 What I must underline to those like you is that Singapore is an orderly and peaceful country; those who disturb its peace through acts of violence, whether in daylight or nighttime, wherever it may be in Singapore, can only expect a harsh response.  They will be punished and punished severely. The Defence has highlighted that two of the other rioters were not sentenced to caning.  Where rioting disrupts public order in a significant way, such as on a public road, even in the early hours of the morning, the court should consider imposing caning, both to punish and deter.  I cannot see why caning should not have been imposed on the other two rioters by the lower court, but their matters are not before me. 20 The prosecution seeks a sentence of at least 2½ years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. 21 The charges taken into consideration, and your overall criminal conduct call for a heavy sentence.  You had committed the offence while having absconded from your supervision sentence.  And even after you were arrested for this rioting offence, you breached bail.  I am satisfied taking these factors into account as well as your tendency to commit violence a sentence of 2½ years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane is indeed appropriate.  That sentence is within the range of the usual guidance for rioting cases.",
        "The third charge: Consumption of Drugs (s 8(b)(ii)of the Misuse of Drugs Act)": "22 Finally, you consumed methamphetamine while on the run after violating bail.  This was not your first drug offence.  You have continued to abuse drugs. 23 The prosecution argues for 5½ to six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane on this charge.  The Defence argues for the minimum of five years and three strokes of the cane. 24 Given your antecedents for drug offences, the fact that you were already on bail and on the run when you consumed the methamphetamine, and the charges taken into consideration, especially the breach of supervision, you are sentenced to six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.",
        "Running of sentence": "25 In determining how the sentences should run, I am mindful of the totality principle and that the overall sentence should not be crushing; that is, it should not be disproportionate to your overall criminal responsibility.  In line with the guidance inADF v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2010] 1 SLR 874 andPublic Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan[2018] 5 SLR 799, I am satisfied that the punishment for these separate offences should all run consecutively.  You have embraced violence as a response to those around you.  That merits severe punishment and retribution.  You have flouted the law on drugs again and again.  You have displayed persistent and pernicious criminality; there is a strong public interest in deterring criminality of the sort you displayed: in particular, multiple victims have suffered from your acts and your tendency to violence.  Each criminal act should be punished in full. 26 Your total sentence of imprisonment is thus 21½ years.  The total caning is 18 strokes.  These sentences are to run from 1 July 2018. Aedit AbdullahJudge of the High Court Wong Woon Kwong SC, Norine Tan Yan Ling, Phoebe Tan Hern Hwei and Asran Abdul Samad (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution; Ramesh Chandr Tiwary (Ramesh Tiwary), Si Hoe Tat Chorng (Acacia Legal LLC) and Harjeet Kaur Dhaliwal (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the accused.",
