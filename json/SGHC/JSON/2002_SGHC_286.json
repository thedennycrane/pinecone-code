        "(i)\n\n        The plaintiffs’ burden of proof": "14.\n\n        Trans-Link did not present the court with any\n\nevidence on the accident to the machine. In its final submissions, it stated that it\n\nrequired Patec to prove its case of negligence in respect of the accident. Patec had\n\nattempted to show the circumstances in which the damage was sustained by adducing the\n\nevidence of a surveyor appointed to investigate the accident.15.\n\n        Ms Klongpitayapong is the managing director of\n\nMcLarens (Thailand) Ltd. She testified that on 24 November 2000, her company received\n\ninstructions from Patec’s insurers in Singapore to inspect one damaged machine at\n\nBITEC and to interview witnesses to determine the cause of the damage. Ms Klongpitayapong\n\nassigned one Chatri Chaimee, a surveyor working for McLarens, to conduct the inspection.\n\nMr Chaimee later reported his findings to Ms Klongpitayapong and as he could not speak or\n\nwrite English, Ms Klongpitayapong prepared the survey report reflecting these findings. On\n\ncompletion of the report, she reviewed its contents with Mr Chaimee and he confirmed that\n\nthe contents were correct. Ms Klongpitayapong then signed the report. A copy of the report\n\nwas attached to her affidavit of evidence-in-chief.16.\n\n        Mr Chaimee did not give evidence. Ms\n\nKlongpitayapong testified that he had left the employ of McLarens and that although she\n\nhad tried to contact him and ask him to come to court, her attempts had been unsuccessful.\n\nShe had spoken to him once but he was not willing to testify. She did not know his present\n\nwhereabouts.17.\n\n        The report contained the only evidence that\n\nPatec was able to adduce as to the circumstances in which the machine was damaged.\n\nTrans-Link objected to the admission of the report on the basis that it was not based on\n\nMs Klongpitayapong’s personal knowledge but was derived from information received\n\nfrom Mr Chaimee. It submitted that the report could not be admitted under s 32(b) of the\n\nEvidence Act (Cap 97) on the basis of a commentary fromHalsbury’s Laws of\n\nSingapore(vol 10) at pps 206 and 207 which reads:‘Under Section 32(b) of the\n\n    Evidence Act, a written statement made by a person who cannot be called as a witness in\n\n    the prescribed sense in the ordinary course of business is a relevant fact. … A\n\n    document used in commerce, written or assigned by him and the date of a letter or other\n\n    document usually dated, written or signed by him is also relevant.…The section envisages evidence of\n\n    written statements made in the ordinary course of business; oral statements made in the\n\n    ordinary course of business are inadmissible under the section.’Trans-Link argued that this meant\n\nthat for s 32(b) to apply to the report, the report must have been written by Mr Chaimee\n\nhimself in the first place. As the report had been prepared from an oral statement taken\n\nfrom Mr Chaimee, it was inadmissible.18.\n\n        I do not accept the above submission. As Patec\n\npointed out, the wording of s 32 does contemplate the admission of oral statements. The\n\nsection reads:’32. Statements,written\n\n    or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead or who cannot be found,\n\n    … are themselves relevant facts in the following cases:…(b) when the statement was made\n\n    by such person in the ordinary course of business, and in particular when it consists of\n\n    any entry or memorandum made by him in books kept in the ordinary course of business or in\n\n    the discharge of professional duty, or of an acknowledgement written or signed by him, or\n\n    of the date of a letter or other document usually dated, written of signed by him’\n\n    (emphasis added)19.\n\n        A plain reading of s 32(b) envisages the\n\nadmissibility of verbal statements made by a person in the ordinary course of business\n\nalthough that section does give examples of particular documents, made in the course of\n\nbusiness, that would be admissible. The enumeration of these various documents in\n\nsub-paragraph (b) does not detract from the general description at the beginning of the\n\nsection which clearly states that both oral and written statements may be admitted. This\n\nposition is recognised bySarkar’s Law of Evidence(15thEd), vol 1\n\npg 684. The passage fromHalsbury’s Laws of Singaporerelied on by Trans-Link\n\ndid not cite any case in support.20.\n\n        Thus, in determining whether the statement is\n\nadmissible, the manner in which it was made is not relevant. What is relevant is whether\n\nthe statement was made in the ordinary course of business. In this instance, it was Mr\n\nChaimee’s duty as a surveyor to investigate and report on matters such as the\n\nincident in question. He was also required to put up a report on his investigations.\n\nMaking reports whether verbal or written would therefore be part of his ordinary duties.\n\nIn this case, however, he would not have been able to put up a report in English as must\n\nhave been required by the instructing insurers from Singapore as he was not conversant\n\nwith the language. Ms Klongpitayapong’s unshaken evidence was that she prepared the\n\nreport because of her knowledge of English but that it was based on Mr Chaimee’s\n\nstatements and that when the report was completed, he confirmed its contents to be\n\ncorrect. It appears to me that Mr Chaimee’s oral statements were made in the ordinary\n\ncourse of his business and that of his employers and that the report should be admissible\n\non that basis. Trans-Link did not dispute that the other requirements of s 32 had been met\n\nie that Mr Chaimee was a person who could not be found.21.\n\n        Accordingly, I hold that the report made by Mr\n\nChaimee is admissible.22.\n\n        In any case, Trans-Link had waived its right to\n\nobject to the admissibility of the survey report by agreeing that it should be included as\n\npart of the Agreed Bundle without making any reservations on admissibility. The effect of\n\nthe parties’ agreement to the inclusion of the report as one of the agreed documents\n\nis that they had agreed that it would be admissible without formal proof. Whilst\n\nTrans-Link was free to ask questions relating to the report and would not be barred from\n\nmaking submissions on the truth of its contents, the report would stand as evidence in\n\ncourt once it had been admitted as part of the Agreed Bundle. That this is the rule is\n\nplain from the following passages of the judgment of Lai Kew Chai J inGoh Ya Tian v\n\nTan Song Gou[1981] 2 MLJ 317:‘InYap Choo Hoo v Tahir\n\n    bin Yasin, it was held by Mr Justice Sharma that a document even forming part of an\n\n    Agreed Bundle has got to be proved, although it need not be formally and strictly proved.\n\n    Even if one understands the qualification of this decision (as to which I am not sure), I\n\n    must respectfully disagree with his reasoning which was delivered orally. …… The learned judge failed\n\n    to appreciate that the documents are admitted into evidence without formal proof. They do\n\n    form part and parcel of the evidence. … The party having agreed to the document is\n\n    perfectly entitled to rebut or reduce the evidential or probative effect of the contents\n\n    of the document by other evidence. What is clear is that the documents in the Agreed\n\n    Bundle are admitted into evidence by consent without production of the maker or the\n\n    originals and the contents do form part of the evidence before the court.’ (at p\n\n    318-319)23.\n\n        In the report it was stated that the surveyor\n\nhad attended at BITEC on 24 November 2000. He found the damaged machine on a wooden pallet\n\nand covered by a tarpaulin sheet pending shipment back to Singapore. One Mr Wittaya of\n\nTrans-Link Express (BKK) Ltd informed the surveyor that he had witnessed the accident. The\n\ntruck carrying the machine had arrived at exhibition hall no. 103 on 10 November and the\n\ncargo had remained on the truck until 12 November 2000. On that date, the truck driver had\n\nremoved the chains securing the machine and had then driven the truck into the hall at\n\nabout 2200 hours. In the course of entering the hall, the truck made a right turn and the\n\nmachine fell off the trailer and onto the ground.24.\n\n        Trans-Link admitted that the machine had been\n\ndamaged while it was in its custody. The evidence contained in the report was sufficient\n\nto show negligence in the transport of the machine into the exhibition hall. No one was\n\ncalled from Trans-Link’s associated company in Thailand to refute that evidence. I\n\nwas satisfied that Patec had discharged its burden of proof. In any case, Trans-Link as\n\nbailee of the machine was under a duty to keep it in the same good order and condition as\n\nit was when it was received into Trans-Link’s care. Having admitted that the damage\n\nwas sustained while the machine was in its care, Trans-Link had the burden of showing that\n\nthe damage did not result from any breach of duty on its part. Trans-Link made no effort\n\nto discharge that burden.",
        "(ii)\n\n        Did the conditions form part of the contract?": "25.\n\n        It is Trans-Link’s submission that the\n\nSFFA Conditions were incorporated in the contract between the parties by Patec’s\n\nsignature of the CoA on 9 October 2000. As can be seen from  8, that document contains\n\nan express clause stating that Trans-Link does business on the terms of the SFFA\n\nConditions and a further clause acknowledging that use of Trans-Link’s services\n\nimplies acknowledgement and acceptance of the SFFA Conditions. The SFFA Conditions were\n\nprinted on a separate document which was not supplied to Patec in the course of the\n\nparties’ negotiations. It should be noted, however, that Patec did not ask for the\n\nSFFA Conditions either, although each document sent by Trans-Link to Patec contained a\n\nclause giving notice that business was transacted only in accordance with them.\n\nPatec’s witnesses conceded that this clause was legible, clear and appeared in bold\n\non all correspondence from Trans-Link. Mr Yeo Kim Chye, a director and the executive vice\n\npresident of Patec, who had experience in signing contracts on behalf of Patec, also\n\nagreed that even if the terms of the conditions had not been read, they nevertheless\n\napplied to the contract by virtue of clauses 1 and 5 of the CoA.26.\n\n        Trans-Link relied on the case ofL’Estrange\n\nv F Graucob Ltd[1934] 2 KB 394 as authority for the proposition that a person who\n\nsigns a contractual document is bound by its terms even though he has not read them. It\n\nalso cited the local authority ofConsmat Singapore (Pte Ltd) v Bank of America\n\nNational Trust & Savings Association[1992] 2 SLR 828where LP Thean J held:‘The plaintiffs’\n\n    contention that cl 3(c) was an onerous and unreasonable provision and that the defendants\n\n    had not taken fair and sufficient steps to draw the plaintiffs’ attention to that\n\n    clause was unsustainable because the plaintiffs, having signed the general agreement must\n\n    be taken to have read and understood the terms thereof. The plaintiffs signed the general\n\n    agreement and accepted it without modification. It was too late therefore for the\n\n    plaintiffs to complain that cl 3(c) had not been brought home to them.’27.\n\n        The difficulty, if any, arises because, unlike\n\nin theConsmatandL’Estrangecases, the SFFA Conditions were not\n\ncontained in the document that Patec signed but were contained in a separate document\n\naltogether and this document was not given to Patec. Trans-Link contended that this made\n\nno difference because the signed document, the CoA, clearly incorporated the SFFA\n\nConditions. It cited two cases in support.28.\n\n        The first isRapiscan Asia Pte Ltd v Global\n\nContainer Freight Pte Ltd[2002] 2 SLR 325which also dealt with the incorporation of\n\nthe SFFA Conditions. Rajendran J held that a clause very similar to the incorporating\n\nclause in the present case was sufficient to incorporate the SFFA Conditions as part of\n\nthe contract between the parties there. While the case notes do not expressly say so, it\n\nappears that inRapiscana copy of the standard terms had not been given to the\n\ncustomer as only quotations were sent to the customer. The judge observed:‘Every page of the two\n\n    quotations faxed to OSM by Global on 4 and 5 December 2000, had printed on it the\n\n    following qualification:All business and transactions\n\n      entered into by or on behalf of the Company is subject to the Singapore Freight Forwarders\n\n      Association Standard Trading Conditions [the SFFA Conditions], copy available upon\n\n      request.’It was submitted, on behalf of\n\n    Global, and I accept that submission, that in view of the fact that it was made known to\n\n    Rapsican, before Global agreed to undertake the shipment, that the shipment was subject to\n\n    SFFA Conditions, the contract of carriage that was entered into was subject to those\n\n    conditions.’29.\n\n        In the second authority,Circle Freight\n\nInternational Ltd v Medeast Gulf Exports Ltd[1987] (unreported decision of the\n\nQueen’s Bench Division) reference was made to another unreported case which held that\n\nreference to a term in a contractual document is deemed reasonable notice of the term. InCircle\n\nFreight, Stuart-Smith J said:‘My attention has been drawn\n\n    to decision of Court of Appeal in a case calledKeaton, Sons & Co V Carl Prior Ltd(unreported), a decision of Ackner, LJ, Gough, LJ and sir Roger Ormrod, given on 14thMarch 1985. That was a case which, in fact, involved the IFF conditions. At first sight it\n\n    lends considerable support to the plaintiffs’ contention because of the factual\n\n    similarities. In that case the Court of Appeal reversed the trial judge and found that the\n\n    IFF terms had been incorporated.In my judgment there is an\n\n    important distinction between that case and the present one, which is this. Before the\n\n    contract was entered into in that case, the freight forwarders sent a letter to the\n\n    defendants indicating that all business was to be transacted in accordance with the\n\n    standard trading conditions of the company. That was a circular letter which was sent to\n\n    all members of the association (of which the defendants were a member) to indicate how the\n\n    transport of the goods would be arranged. More importantly, the letter was followed by a\n\n    further circular letter which described the package deal which was open for acceptance by\n\n    the plaintiffs. That document itself also contained the clause to which I have referred. I\n\n    should have added that the clause contained the words \"copies application\"\n\n    which, presumably, means \"copies on application\". The actual terms relied upon\n\n    were not, in that case, as in this case, ever sent to the other contracting party. The\n\n    contract was then made following a visit by the defendants’ representative to the\n\n    plaintiffs’ premises, where they discussed the arrangements, and instructions were\n\n    given to move the machinery in question.It seems to me to be clear that the letter\n\n    – the package deal – was a contractual document, the contract in question\n\n    being partly in writing and partly oral as a result of the meeting between the parties.In\n\n    that case, therefore, the clause which incorporated the conditions was contained in one of\n\n    the contractual documents.In this case that is not so. There were no contractual\n\n    documents here. The contract was entirely oral and made on the telephone.’ (Emphasis\n\n    added)30.\n\n        Patec did not dispute that the CoA contained\n\nclauses which incorporated the SFFA Conditions. Their contention was that the\n\nincorporating clause was insufficient to incorporate clauses 27 and 30 because those are\n\nparticularly onerous or unusual clauses or are clauses which involve the abrogation of a\n\nright given by statute. Patec submitted that where clauses of this nature are concerned,\n\nthey cannot be incorporated by reference by one party unless that party has brought them\n\nfairly and reasonably to the attention of the other party.31.\n\n        Leaving aside, for the time being, the issue of\n\nwhether either clause 27 or clause 30 of the conditions or both are unusual or\n\nparticularly onerous or involve the abrogation of a statutory right, I will first consider\n\nwhether the authorities cited by Patec in support of their contention apply in a case\n\nwhere a set of conditions has been specifically incorporated in a contract by a document\n\nsigned by the party whom it is sought to bind.32.\n\n        Patec first cited 12-015 fromChitty on\n\nContracts(1999) vol 1 which states:‘Onerous or unusual\n\n    terms.Although the party receiving the document knows it contains conditions, if the\n\n    particular condition relied on is one which is a particularly onerous or unusual term, or\n\n    is one which involves the abrogation of a right given by statute, the party tendering the\n\n    document must show that it has been brought fairly and reasonably to the other’s\n\n    attention. \"Some clauses which I have seen,\" said Denning LJ, \"would need\n\n    to be printed in red ink on the face of the document with a red hand pointing to it before\n\n    the notice could be held to be sufficient.’Chapter 12 ofChittydeals\n\nwith the express terms of a contract and Part 1 of this chapter is entitled ‘Proof of\n\nTerms’. Paragraph 12-015 appears under section (b) of Part 1 and the first paragraph\n\nin that section,  12-008 reads:‘Contracts in standard\n\n    form. A different problem may arise in proving the terms of the agreement where it is\n\n    sought to show that there are contained in a contract in standard form, ie in some ticket,\n\n    receipt, or standard form document. If a party signs a contractual document he will\n\n    normally bound by its terms. More often, however, the document is simply handed to him at\n\n    the time of making the contract and the question will then arise whether the printed\n\n    conditions which it contains have become terms of the contract. …’After that general statement, the\n\nsection goes on to deal with the principles to be applied in answering the question\n\nwhether printed conditions on a separate document handed to a party have contractual\n\nforce. Paragraph 12-015 dealing with onerous or unusual terms is a part of that\n\ndiscussion. As can be seen from the foregoing, this entire discussion takes place in the\n\ncontext of a situation in which a document containing terms is handed over physically at\n\nthe time the contract is made and the party receiving it would be, most often, in the\n\nposition of wanting to make an immediate contract and would not have had previous contact\n\nor negotiations with the other party. Nothing would be signed by the recipient of the\n\ndocument. That is not the situation which applied in this case as the parties here were in\n\ncontact with each other for more than a month before concluding the contract and during\n\nthat period active negotiations on the main terms of the contract took place.33.\n\n        The quotation from Lord Denning which appears\n\nin 12-015 is taken from the case ofJ Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw[1956] 1 WLR 461.\n\nIn this case the plaintiff sent some casks of orange juice to the defendant warehouseman\n\nfor storage. On receipt of the goods, the defendant issued a receipt for them called a\n\n‘landing account’ which stated on its face that the defendant’s conditions\n\nas printed on the back of the document covered the goods in storage. One of these printed\n\nconditions exempted the defendant from liability for loss of the goods even when the loss\n\narose from the defendant’s negligence. This was a classic case of an attempt to\n\nincorporate standard form conditions into a contract by way of an unsigned document handed\n\nover at the time of making the contract.34.\n\n        Denning LJ’s observation was adopted in\n\nthe English Court of Appeal decision inInterfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual\n\nProgrammes Ltd[1989] 1 QB 433 where it was held that where clauses incorporated into\n\na contract contained a particularly onerous or unusual condition, the party seeking to\n\nenforce that condition had to show that it had been brought fairly and reasonably to the\n\nattention of the other party. That too was a case where no written contract was signed and\n\nthe conditions were handed over at the time the contract was made. What had happened was\n\nthat the plaintiffs who ran a photographic transparency lending library, delivered to the\n\ndefendants 47 transparencies on loan after receiving a telephone enquiry from the\n\ndefendants. The transparencies were accompanied by a delivery note containing nine printed\n\nconditions and the issue was whether one of them which imposed punitive fees for\n\ntransparencies not returned within 14 days of delivery had been incorporated as part of\n\nthe contract.35.\n\n        TheInterfotocase was distinguished by\n\nThean J inConsmaton the basis that the contract inConsmatwas signed. Goh\n\nJoon Seng J, however, appliedInterfotoinHakko Products Pte Ltd v Danzas\n\n(Singapore) Pte Ltd[2000] 3 SLR 488where the defendant freight forwarder sent the\n\nplaintiff a quotation for transport of the plaintiff’s machine from Germany to\n\nSingapore. At the bottom of the quotation appeared a clause, the incorporating clause,\n\nthat read ‘All business transacted in accordance with SAAA’s standard trading\n\nconditions. Copy available on application.’ The plaintiff accepted this quotation and\n\nthe machine was damaged in transit. The issue was whether clauses 15 and 16 of the\n\nSAAA’s standard trading conditions, which operated to restrict the defendant’s\n\nliability for damage, applied to the contract. Goh J noted that the incorporating clause\n\nwas in very small print and was not legible and thus the plaintiff had not seen it. He\n\nheld, on the basis ofInterfoto,that the incorporating clause and the exemption\n\nand limitation of liability clauses should have been brought to the plaintiff’s\n\nattention and as they had not they were not part of the contract. It appears to me thatHakko’scase is distinguishable from the facts before me because the incorporating clause here was\n\nadmittedly legible and also there is no indication from the report ofHakko’scase that the plaintiff there signed any document equivalent to the CoA here.36.\n\n        More helpful to Patec is a pair of Canadian\n\ncases. The first isTilden Rent-A-Car Co v Clendenning[1978] 83 DLR 3d 400 where\n\nMr Clendenning on hiring a car from Tilden signed a hire contract but did not read it. Mr\n\nClendenning elected to pay an additional premium for ‘collision damage waiver’\n\nwhich he understood to amount to full insurance for damage to the vehicle. The contract\n\nprovided in fine and faint print that this waiver would not apply if the car was driven by\n\na person who had consumed intoxicating liquor. Mr Clendenning drove the car while\n\nintoxicated and caused it damage. Tilden then sought to recover the cost of repairing the\n\ncar and relied on the fine print at the back of the contract. Its case was dismissed at\n\ntrial on the ground that the explanation of the waiver given by Tilden’s employees on\n\nprevious occasions on which Mr Clendenning had dealt with them had amounted to a\n\nmisrepresentation. Tilden’s appeal was also dismissed with the Ontario Court of\n\nAppeal holding that a signature can only be relied on as manifesting assent to a document\n\nwhen it is reasonable for the party relying on the signed document to believe that the\n\nsignor really did assent to its contents. In a transaction such as a car rental contract,\n\nwhere the plaintiff emphasises in its advertising the speed and ease of the transaction,\n\nit can be held to know that its customers do not really assent to all the provisions of\n\nthe documents they sign, and in such circumstances the plaintiff cannot rely on unusual\n\nand onerous printed terms not drawn to the customers’ attention.37.\n\n        In the other case,Trident Holdings Ltd v\n\nDanand Investments Ltd,21 C.L.R. 240 and, on appeal 39 B.L.R. 296, Trident submitted\n\na quotation to Danand in relation to some construction works. The parties then sat down to\n\nnegotiate and, during the course of the meeting, Danand suggested various changes to the\n\nquotation both in relation to language and in relation to the items of work to be done and\n\nprice. The changes and added language were all hand-written by Danand’s\n\nrepresentative and initialled by both him and Trident’s representative. The quotation\n\nhad a portion captioned ‘Acceptance’ followed by appropriate acceptance language\n\nwith a place for signature. This was not signed by Danand’s representative. At the\n\nend of the discussion each party kept a copy of the initialled quotation and Danand’s\n\nrepresentative wrote on his copy ‘Contract to follow’, these words being a\n\nreference to a standard form of contract used by Danand. The standard form contract\n\ndocument was never signed and the issue that arose was whether a contract had nevertheless\n\ncome into existence.38.\n\n        In the Ontario District Court, the court of\n\nfirst instance, it was held that the proposal in the form in which it emerged from the\n\nmeeting itself embodied a complete contract. The work to be done was specified and there\n\nwere no major terms left to be negotiated. Execution of a further contract was not a\n\ncondition of the bargain. The standard form contract which included certain clauses on\n\nwhich Danand wished to rely did not apply since that form of contract was not signed or\n\npresented for Trident’s signature. On appeal, the Ontario Supreme Court held:‘The contract that the\n\n    parties signed was found by the trial judge to embody a complete contract. If Danand\n\n    wished to have all of the special terms of its standard form contract incorporated into\n\n    the contractual relationship (some of them, such as the one under consideration, being\n\n    very disadvantageous to the party contracting with one of Mr. Greenspoon’s\n\n    companies), it should have seen to it that this form was signed. Until this was done,\n\n    there was a contract with no need to import any additional terms and I do not think that\n\n    there was any reasonable basis for doing so. The evidence which could be brought to bear\n\n    on the matter of implication, such as that which was submitted to relate to the previous\n\n    courses of dealing, is not sufficiently cogent. Further, the fact that Mr. Di Battista\n\n    would probably have signed the standard form contract is not sufficient to import the term\n\n    in question into the contract that in fact was made. Mr. Di Battista gave evidence that he\n\n    was ignorant of the term. (per Morden J.A. at  30)Patec submitted that applyingTrident\n\nHoldings Ltd, the conditions here had to be signed before Patec could be bound by\n\nclauses 27 and 30.39.\n\n        Having considered the authorities, I am of the\n\nopinion that the fact that the incorporating clause here was contained in a document that\n\nwas signed by Patec, resulted in the conditions being incorporated as part of the contract\n\nbetween the parties notwithstanding that Patec did not have a copy of them and had not\n\nread them. I hold that the conditions were incorporated as a whole and that the line of\n\nauthorities that decides that onerous and unusual conditions cannot be incorporated unless\n\nthe attention of the party sought to be bound has been specifically drawn to them does not\n\napply to a case like this where there is a signed contract with an explicit incorporating\n\nclause. As far as the authorities are concerned, as I have shown above, all those that\n\napply the specific notice requirement for onerous clauses are cases in which there was no\n\nsigned contract. The only exception is theTildencase. I do not consider theTridentcase an exception as the contract that was found to exist by the court was a contract\n\nwhich was concluded partly orally and partly in writing and the written part did not\n\ncontain an express incorporation clause referring to Danand’s standard term contract.\n\nThe court there, as was clear from the judgment of the Court of Appeal, was asked to make\n\na finding of incorporation by implication which would be supported by evidence on a\n\nprevious course of dealing.40.\n\n        WhilstTildendirectly supports\n\nPatec’s position, I decline to follow it. In my judgment, it is not in accordance\n\nwith the common law position in England and in Singapore. Where a party has signed a\n\ncontract after having been given notice, by way of a clear incorporating clause such as\n\nthe one used in the present case, of what would be included among the contractual terms,\n\nthat party cannot afterwards assert that it is not bound by some of the terms on the\n\nground that the same are onerous and unusual and had not been drawn specifically to its\n\nattention. Contracting parties must have a care for their own legal positions by\n\nascertaining what terms are to be part of a contract before signing it. If they do not do\n\nso, they will be bound by those terms except to the extent that the UCTA offers them\n\nrelief. InAEG (UK) Ltd v Logic Resource Limited[1995] (unreported decision of the\n\nCourt of Appeal), Hobhouse LJ expressed the opinion that whilst in the past there may have\n\nbeen a tendency to introduce more strict criteria in relation to the question of whether\n\nparticular terms had been incorporated into a contract by reference:‘… this is no longer\n\n    necessary in view of the Unfair Contract Terms Act. The reasonableness of clauses is the\n\n    subject matter of the Unfair Contract Terms Act and it is under the provisions of that Act\n\n    that problems of unreasonable clauses should be addressed and the solution found.’Whilst Hobhouse LJ was in the\n\nminority in that case (one which involved conditions printed at the back of a confirmation\n\nof order document), I respectfully agree and adopt his view which accords with common\n\nsense.41.\n\n        In the result I hold that all the SFFA\n\nConditions including clauses 27 and 30 were incorporated as part of the contract between\n\nPatec and Trans-Link.",
        "(iv)\n\n        The requirement of reasonableness under UCTA": "42.\n\n        Under s 3 of UCTA, as between contracting\n\nparties where one of them deals on the other’s written standard terms of business, as\n\nagainst that party the other cannot by reference to any contract term exclude or restrict\n\nhis liability for breach of the contract except insofar as the contract term satisfies the\n\nrequirement of reasonableness.43.\n\n        The test of reasonableness is provided in s 11.\n\nThis, so far as relevant, reads:‘11. – (1) In relation\n\n    to a contract term, the requirement of reasonableness of the purposes of this Part …\n\n    is that the term shall have been a fair and reasonable one to be included having regard to\n\n    the circumstances which were, or ought reasonably to have been, known to or in the\n\n    contemplation of the parties when the contract was made.(2) …(3) …(4) Where by reference to a\n\n    contract term or notice a person seeks to restrict liability to a specified sum of money,\n\n    and the question arises (under this or any other Act) whether the term or notice satisfies\n\n    the requirement of reasonableness, regard shall be had in particular (but without\n\n    prejudice to subsection (2) in the case of contract terms to –(a) the resources which he could\n\n      expect to be available to him for the purpose of meeting the liability should it arise;\n\n      and(b) how far it was open to him to\n\n      cover himself by insurance.(5) It is for those claiming that\n\n    a contract term or notice satisfies the requirement of reasonableness to show that it\n\n    does.’44.\n\n        From the section it is clear that the onus of\n\nproving that any particular restrictive clause in a contract is reasonable lies on the\n\nparty so asserting, in this case, Trans-Link. Secondly, the time for determining the\n\nreasonableness of the term is the time when the contract is made and not the time when it\n\nis breached nor the time when the issue arises in court.45.\n\n        Section 11 was considered inKenwell &\n\nCo Pte Ltd v Southern Ocean Shipbuilding Co Pte Ltd[1999] 1 SLR 214. Warren Khoo J\n\nheld there that the fact that the parties were business or commercial entities dealing\n\nwith each other in the course of business per se did not go towards satisfying the\n\nreasonableness requirement. The mere fact that a party had apparently willingly entered\n\ninto a contract containing exclusion and limitation terms also did not prevent him from\n\nsubsequently raising questions of reasonableness. Further, a provision that was commonly\n\nfound in an industry may be reasonable by reason of it being in common use; but it could\n\nalso be unreasonable nevertheless. The question whether a contractual term satisfied the\n\nrequirement of reasonableness depended on the facts of each case. In principle, a term\n\nwhich had been found to satisfy the reasonableness requirement in one case may not satisfy\n\nit in another.46.\n\n        Trans-Link made an argument that because Patec\n\nclearly had notice of the application of the SFFA Conditions to the contract by way of the\n\nincorporating clause which was repeated seven times in each quotation which was forwarded\n\nto Patec and its representatives showed a blas attitude to the content of the SFFA\n\nConditions, being content to sit back and wait for Trans-Link to highlight the conditions\n\nto them, the Court ought to allow enforcement of the conditions. Counsel went so far as to\n\nsubmit that preventing enforcement of the SFFA Conditions would amount to relieving\n\nparties who have been incompetent in contractual negotiations of their contractual\n\nresponsibility and transferring the burden of such responsibility to the Courts.47.\n\n        I cannot accept that argument.Kenwell’scase is clear authority for the principle that even if a party knowingly enters a contract\n\nwith a restrictive condition he will still be able to seek the protection of UCTA. That\n\nprinciple emanates from the language of UCTA itself as the statute was passed to allow\n\nparties to contracts to be relieved of the burden of unfair contractual terms provided the\n\ncontracts concerned fall within the legislation. Since this contract is covered by s 3 of\n\nUCTA in that Patec dealt on Trans-Link’s written standard terms of business, Patec is\n\nentitled to require Trans-Link to establish that the exclusion and limitation clauses pass\n\nthe reasonableness test.",
        "(v)\n\n        Are clauses 27 and 30 in accordance with\n\ninternational and local custom/practice?": "48.\n\n        As part of its case that the clauses concerned\n\nare reasonable, Trans-Link sought to establish that they are in accordance with\n\ninternational and local custom/ practice. I will consider this issue first as it relates\n\nto both clauses before going on to consider the clauses individually as, in other\n\nrespects, the bases for promoting the reasonableness of each of them are different.49.\n\n        As evidence of the applicable international and\n\nlocal practice, Trans-Link adduced testimony from Mr Ronald George Willis, Mr Lim Hwee\n\nHong Stanley and Mr Nicholas Charles Sansom.50.\n\n        Mr Lim is in the freight forwarding business.\n\nIn 1992, he became chairman of the SSFA. He remains the chairman of the association under\n\nits new name of Singapore Logistics Association (‘SLA’). Mr Lim testified that\n\nthe SLA currently has 265 members and represents the majority of established logistics\n\nproviders in the Singapore freight forwarding industry. It is a member of FIATA, the\n\ninternational federation of national freight forwarding associations. According to Mr Lim,\n\nthe SFFA Conditions were drawn up in 1986 and were modelled on the standard trading\n\nconditions of the British International Freight Association (‘BIFA’). In the\n\nyear 2000, the SLA adopted an amended set of conditions which I shall refer to as the SLA\n\nConditions. Clauses 27 and 30 of the SFFA Conditions also appear in the SLA Conditions and\n\nthe wording of both sets of clauses is identical save that in cl 27 of the SFFA Conditions\n\nliability is limited to $5 per kilogram whereas in the equivalent of the SLA Conditions,\n\nliability is limited to $1 per kilogram. The maximum liability of $100,000 remains the\n\nsame in both cases.51.\n\n        Patec submitted that Trans-Link had failed to\n\nestablish that it was the custom of freight forwarders in Singapore to carry on business\n\non the basis of the SFFA Conditions. It pointed out that under cross-examination Mr Lim\n\nagreed that in the year 2000, the SLA had recommended that its members adopt the new SLA\n\nConditions and that as far as he knew most members were using them rather than the SFFA\n\nConditions. Although Mr Lim acknowledged that he was not aware how many of the SLA’s\n\nmembers were still using the SFFA Conditions in the year 2000, he agreed with the\n\nassertion put to him by Patec’s counsel that it was not the custom in 2000 for\n\nfreight forwarders in Singapore to trade on the SFFA Conditions. He did, however, maintain\n\nthat in 2000 it was the custom for freight forwarders to trade on the SLA Conditions.52.\n\n        Patec did not adduce any evidence of its own in\n\nrelation to the custom followed by freight forwarders in Singapore. The furthest it went\n\nwas to adduce evidence of the previous contracts that it had with its regular freight\n\nforwarder, one Mr Eric Wong. These contracts did not contain any standard terms and\n\nconditions excluding or limiting liability. On the other hand, it should be noted that\n\nbefore Patec concluded the contract with Trans-Link it had also conducted negotiations\n\nwith a freight forwarding company named R.E. Rogers Singapore (Pte) Ltd\n\n(‘Rogers’). Rogers sent Patec a number of quotations and a confirmation of\n\nacceptance form. In each of its quotations, a clause at the bottom appeared which stated:\n\n‘All business is handled in accordance with our terms and conditions of trading. Copy\n\navailable upon request’. The confirmation of acceptance form had wording that was\n\npractically identical to the wording of Trans-Link’s CoA. In particular, clause 1\n\nread ‘All business is only transacted in accordance with the Singapore Logistics\n\nAssociations (SLA) Standard Trading Conditions (1986). Copy is available upon\n\napplication’. It would appear that Rogers traded on the updated SFFA Conditions in\n\nthe form of the SLA Conditions.53.\n\n        From the evidence of Mr Lim and the other\n\nevidence available to me in the case, I conclude that in the year 2000, there were freight\n\nforwarders in Singapore who adopted the SLA Conditions and there were others who adopted\n\nthe SFFA Conditions. There were some who did not adopt either but companies that were\n\nmembers of the SLA were likely to be using either the current or previous standard form\n\nterms and conditions. Whichever set of conditions was applied, they contained time bar and\n\nlimitation of liability clauses.54.\n\n        Mr Willis was called to give evidence on the\n\ninternational practice of freight forwarders. He is currently the vice president of BIFA\n\nand a member of the FIATA Advisory Body Legal Matters. He testified that both the nine\n\nmonth time bar and the limitation of liability provisions contained within the SFFA\n\nConditions are internationally accepted customs of trade, approved by two independent\n\nbodies, namely ICC and UNCTAD. He confirmed that such restrictive clauses appear in the\n\nBIFA standard terms and conditions which were initially compiled in full co-operation with\n\nthe British Shippers Council and are registered with the British Office of Fair Trading.\n\nThese restrictions appeared in every set of freight forwarding conditions that he had ever\n\nseen and he considered them both justified and reasonable. Patec did not adduce any\n\nevidence at all on the international position.55.\n\n        I am satisfied that internationally it is the\n\npractice of freight forwarders to trade on standard terms which include time bar periods\n\nand limitation of liability clauses. I am also satisfied that in Singapore it is the\n\npractice of freight forwarders generally who are members of the SLA, to also trade on\n\neither the SLA Conditions or their predecessor, the SFFA Conditions. This holding is, of\n\ncourse, not the end of the matter because I have to consider whether each of the disputed\n\nclauses is reasonable in the specific circumstances of the contract between Patec and\n\nTrans-Link.",
        "(vi)\n\n        Is clause 30 reasonable?": "56.\n\n        Clause 30 of the SFFA Conditions reads:‘The Company [Trans-Link]\n\n    shall be discharged of any liability whatsoever unless:(i) Notice of any claim is\n\n    received in writing by the Company or its agent within 14 days after the date specified in\n\n    (b) below,(ii) suit is brought in the\n\n    proper forum and written notice hereof received by the Company within 9 months after the\n\n    date specified in (b) below.(b)(i) in the case of damage to\n\n    Goods, the date of delivery of the Goods, and in the case of loss of the Goods, the date\n\n    the Goods should have been delivered.(ii) in the case of delay or\n\n    non-delivery of the Goods, the date that the Goods should have been delivered.(iii) in any other case, the\n\n    event giving rise to the claim.’Bearing in mind that the normal\n\nlimitation period when goods are damaged due to a breach of contract is six years, a time\n\nbar period of nine months is a substantial restriction of the rights of the party whose\n\ngoods have been damaged.57.\n\n        Mr Lim asserted, in relation to clause 30, that\n\nthe nine month time bar is a necessary feature in multimodal transport. It has been\n\nadopted by many internationally accepted multimodal terms and conditions. He explained\n\nthat in the freight forwarding business, it is common for more than one mode of\n\ntransportation to be required and for the freight forwarder to subcontract segments of the\n\njourney to third parties. Often, the subcontracts with third parties are subject to rules\n\napplied by international conventions which in themselves contain time limits for the\n\ncommencement of suit. In the case of carriage of goods by sea, for example, suit must be\n\ncommenced within one year of loss of damage pursuant to the provisions of the Hague Rules\n\nor the Hague Visby Rules. Accordingly, a nine month time bar in a contract between the\n\nfreight forwarder and its customer is crucial to ensure that the freight forwarder has\n\nsufficient to consider and investigate any claim by its customer and protect its position\n\nagainst subcontractors if necessary. The nine month time bar is not therefore an arbitrary\n\nlimitation period adopted and imposed by the freight forwarding industry.58.\n\n        Mr Willis echoed Mr Lim’s views. He stated\n\nthat the nine month time bar is a world-wide standard within the freight forwarding\n\nindustry as is evidenced by its inclusion as clause 17 in the FIATA Multimodal Transport\n\nBill of Lading and clause 10 in the FIATA Model Rules for Freight Forwarding services. The\n\nUNCTAD/ICC Rules for Multimodal are contained in ICC Publication 481 also have a nine\n\nmonth time bar. Mr Willis also confirmed the rationale given by Mr Lim for the adoption of\n\nthe nine month time bar.59.\n\n        On the other hand, there are various\n\ninternational transport conventions that provide lengthier time bars. Under the United\n\nNations draft Convention on International Multimodal Transport of Goods, the suggested\n\ntime bar period is two years and there are conventions relating to international carriage\n\nof goods by road and by rail which provide for a one year time bar. The time bar for air\n\ncarriage under the Warsaw Convention is two years. Mr Willis’ response when he was\n\nasked why the forwarder adopted a nine month time bar period in the light of the longer\n\ntime bar periods for different types of travel was that it was clearer for the forwarder\n\nto have a nine month period rather than something dependent on his subcontract with the\n\nactual carrier. Such a provision would also put the cargo interest in a worse situation\n\nbecause he would have to work out which time period was applicable depending on whether\n\nthe cargo was damaged during air, sea or land carriage and the facts might not be clear.60.\n\n        All of the above are general considerations.\n\nTrans-Link have to satisfy me that in the particular circumstances of this case, nine\n\nmonths, which is five years and three months shorter than the statutorily bestowed time\n\nperiod, is a reasonable period. Patec submitted that there were two justifications for the\n\nperiod. The first was that the nine month period was, according to the evidence, necessary\n\nto protect their right of recourse against the third party actual carrier should the loss\n\nor damage occur whilst in the custody of that carrier.61.\n\n        The carriage in this case involved land\n\ntransport in Singapore for which the six year period would otherwise be applicable, a sea\n\njourney to Bangkok from Singapore for which the applicable time bar provision would be\n\nfound in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (Cap 33), and land transport in Bangkok and the\n\nsea voyage back to Singapore. No evidence was adduced as to the time bar period in Bangkok\n\nfor claims of this kind or as to any time bar period either statutorily or contractually\n\napplicable for the sea voyage back to Singapore. In the latter case either the Hague Rules\n\nor the Hague Visby Rules would most probably apply but Trans-Link did not produce evidence\n\non this.62.\n\n        Patec submitted that there was no evidence that\n\nthere was a one year time bar applicable to any stage of the contemplated carriage. As far\n\nas the sea carriage was concerned, the only evidence available was as to the carriage from\n\nSingapore and under our Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, the Hague Visby Rules would be\n\ncompulsorily applicable to that carriage. Patec contended that whilst the general time bar\n\nprovided by the Hague Visby Rules is one year, in the case of an indemnity action, Article\n\nIII r 6biswould apply. This reads:‘An action for indemnity\n\n    against a third person may be brought even after the expiration of the year provided for\n\n    in the preceding paragraph if brought within the time allowed by the law of the Court\n\n    seized of the case. However, the time allowed shall be not less than 3 months, commencing\n\n    from the day when the person bringing such action for indemnity has settled the claim or\n\n    has been served with process in the action against himself.’If this rule is applicable then\n\neven if Trans-Link was sued by its client after the expiry of the one year time period, it\n\nwould still have a further three months thereafter in which to sue the ocean carrier.63.\n\n        Trans-Link submitted that r 6bisonly\n\napplies to carriers who have subcontracted the carriage to a second carrier under a bill\n\nof lading. In support, it cited the following passage fromScrutton on Charterparties\n\nand Bills of Lading(20thEd) at p 437:‘Since the Rules apply\n\n    directly only to contracts covered by a bill of lading, this new Rule is intended\n\n    presumably to deal with situations where the carrier under a particular bill of lading is\n\n    himself in the position of shipper or consignee under another bill of lading, for instance\n\n    where there has been transhipment for part of the voyage. For the indemnity period in Rule\n\n    6b is to apply, it is only necessary that the contract under which the recourse claim is\n\n    brought should be subject to the Rules, and it does not matter that the contract under\n\n    which the underlying claim was brought was not so subject.’A similar passage inChorley\n\nand Giles’ Shipping Lawwas also quoted by Trans-Link. It should be noted,\n\nhowever, that in both extracts whilst the writers cite the situation of transhipment as\n\nthe situation which the rule seeks to cover, neither of them expressly states that a\n\nfreight forwarder who seeks to obtain an indemnity against a contractual liability to his\n\ncustomer (which liability arises out of a contract which is not a bill of lading) cannot\n\nrely on that rule when seeking to enforce the bill of lading contract between himself and\n\nthe actual carrier. Further, while Lord Brandon in the case ofThe Xingcheng[1987] 2 LLR 210 remarked that the case to which r 6bisapplied was a transhipment type\n\ncase, he also stated that there was no express requirement in that rule that the liability\n\nto the cargo owner in respect of which one shipowner claimed an indemnity against another\n\nmust also arise under a contract of carriage to which the Hague Visby Rules applied and\n\nthat there was no good reason why such a requirement should be implied (at p 213).The\n\nXingchengwas decided some five years afterTheVechscroon[1982] 1 LLR\n\n301. In the latter case, a transport company had contracted to carry goods from Ireland to\n\nParis in a refrigerated vehicle and whilst this vehicle was on board a ferry, it\n\noverturned and the goods were damaged. The transport company paid the owners of the goods\n\nand claimed an indemnity from the ferry owner. The ferry owner raised an argument of time\n\nbar under the Hague Rules but it was held that the Hague Visby Rules applied to the\n\ncarriage and because of the operation of r 6bisthe action was not time barred.\n\nThis case was not disapproved of inThe Xinghcheng.I find it of assistance that\n\nthe transport company in that case was able to rely on r. 6bisto extend the time\n\nfor bringing the indemnity action beyond the one year time limit under Article III r. 6\n\neven though it was not itself a shipowner or sea carrier. This case shows that, as the\n\ngenerality of its language implies, the operation of r. 6bisextends beyond the\n\ntranshipment situation.64.\n\n        Trans-Link has not satisfied me that in the\n\ncircumstances of this contract between itself and Patec it was necessary for Trans-Link to\n\nput a nine month time bar in place in order to protect its right of recourse against the\n\nthird party actual carrier should the loss or damage have occurred whilst the goods were\n\nin the custody of the third party. The only evidence that any part of the carriage was\n\nsubject to a time bar period of less than six years related to the carriage from Singapore\n\nto Bangkok. As that leg was covered by the Hague Visby Rules, had the damage occurred\n\nwhile the goods were on board them.v. Asia Express, Trans-Link would have been\n\nable to rely on r.6bisto extend the time in which it could claim an indemnity\n\nfrom the owners of that vessel and would not need the protection of a nine month time bar\n\nperiod for that purpose.65.\n\n        The next justification for the nine month time\n\nbar period related to insurance. In this respect, Trans-Link relied on the testimony of Mr\n\nNicholas Charles Sansom, the managing director of Thomas Miller (South East Asia) Pte Ltd,\n\nthe managers of the Singapore branches of The Through Transport Mutual Insurance\n\nAssociation (EurAsia) Ltd (‘TT Club’) and the Untied Kingdom Mutual Steamship\n\nAssurance Association (Bermuda) Ltd (‘UK P&I Club’). The TT Club and the UK\n\nP&I Club provide insurance coverage for shipowners. Mr Sansom testified that the TT\n\nClub recommends that its members have a nine month time limit in their trading conditions.\n\nHe stated that a time limit means that an estimate for a potential claim can be removed\n\nfrom an insured’s claims record once time has expired. The existence and value of\n\nestimates on a claims record have a significant and direct effect on premium and therefore\n\na time limit helps to reduce insurance costs. In cross-examination, Mr Sansom agreed it\n\nwould still be possible to obtain insurance even if the freight forwarder contracted on\n\nterms that provided for a longer time bar period. He also said that the additional premium\n\nfor an extended time bar period would not result in the premium being so prohibitive that\n\nthe freight forwarder could not do profitable business after that. In the case of the TT\n\nClub, if a freight forwarder asked the Club for cover when its contract provided for a 12\n\nmonth time bar period there would be no additional premium charged initially but this\n\nmight result in additional premium later if the absence of a nine month time bar made the\n\nmember’s claims record worse. Mr Sansom was not able to give very definite evidence\n\nof the link between increased premium and a longer time bar period because in the\n\norganisations he represents the premium charged to each member is calculated on that\n\nmember’s claims record which results from a number of factors and not only the time\n\nbar period provided for in the contract of carriage. All he could say was that the time\n\nbar could possibly play a part.66.\n\n        In the light of Mr Sansom’s evidence,\n\nTrans-Link submitted that although the absence of a nine month time bar may not\n\nimmediately impact the amount of premium payable by the freight forwarder, it will\n\nultimately have a bearing on the premium subsequently payable by the freight forwarder.\n\nThe inability of a freight forwarder to seek recourse against the actual carrier will\n\ndeteriorate the freight forwarder’s claims record.67.\n\n        At the material time, Trans-Link did have\n\ninsurance covering any liability it incurred in the course of its business. It did not\n\ncall any evidence from this insurance company. I was not told by its insurer that it was a\n\ncondition of the cover that a nine month time bar be imposed. Nor was any evidence given\n\nthat that particular insurance company would have charged a prohibitive rate of premium\n\nhad it been asked to cover business that had a longer time bar period. Trans-Link, at the\n\nrequest of Patec, disclosed a copy of the insurance renewal certificate issued for the\n\nyear 2000. That certificate showed that Trans-Link had cover for bailee liability of up to\n\nUS$1 million per incident with a deductible of US$4 million. There was nothing in the\n\ncertificate to indicate that Trans-Link was required to trade on the SFFA Conditions in\n\norder to obtain cover. The actual insurance policy was produced in the course of the trial\n\nbut it was not established to my satisfaction that by virtue of that policy coverage would\n\nonly attach if Trans-Link traded on the SSFA Conditions. It therefore appears to me that\n\nTrans-Link has not shown, on the balance of probabilities, that in the year 2000 it\n\nrequired a nine month time bar in order to insure itself, at reasonable rates, for\n\nliability incurred as a bailee.68.\n\n        Overall, I am of the view that Trans-Link has\n\nnot discharged the onus of showing that the nine month time bar period imposed by cl 30 is\n\nreasonable in relation to the contract for the carriage of the Patec machine from\n\nSingapore to Bangkok and back again. As cl 30 has not been shown to be reasonable, it\n\nfollows that Patec’s claim is not time barred.(vii)\n\n        Is clause 27 reasonable?69.\n\n        Clause 27 provides that in respect of any goods\n\nlost, damaged, misdirected or misdelivered, the liability of Trans-Link is limited to the\n\nleast of (i) the value of the goods, (ii) $5 per gross kilogram of the goods or (iii)\n\n$100,000. Under cl 28 compensation is to be calculated by reference to the invoice value\n\nof the goods plus freight and insurance if paid. Clause 29 is also relevant in this\n\nconnection. It provides that: ‘by special agreement in writing and on payment of\n\nadditional charges, higher compensation may be claimed from [Trans-Link] not exceeding the\n\nvalue of the goods or the agreed value, whichever is the lesser’.70.\n\n        In this regard, Mr Sansom’s evidence was\n\nthat financial limitations of liability are essential to world trade. Without limitations\n\nof liability, transporters of cargo (including freight forwarders) might not be able to\n\nobtain liability insurance. Even if available, the insurance would be very expensive and\n\nit may not be possible to pass the additional cost to the cargo owner. Cargo interests are\n\nable to protect their interests by taking out cargo insurance. The liability of a\n\ntransporter of cargo will usually be subject to a financial limit which varies depending\n\non the mode of transport and the country of the transporter. In Mr Sansom’s view, the\n\nlimitation of liability under the SFFA Conditions was not unreasonable or exceptional.71.\n\n        Mr Willis gave evidence on the limits of\n\nliability imposed under other sets of standard terms and international conventions. He\n\nsaid that the present international standard of forwarders’ limitation is based upon\n\nthe Special Drawing Right (‘SDR’) and stands at 2 SDRs per kilogram. This limit\n\nis found in both the FIATA Model Rules and the BIFA 2000 terms. 2 SDRs per kilogram\n\npresently amounts to approximately $3.52 per kilogram and is therefore a lower sum than\n\nthe $5 per kilogram offered under cl 27.72.\n\n        In its submissions, Patec specifically drew\n\nattention to the higher limit of 17 SDR ($49.58) per kilogram imposed for air cargo by the\n\nWarsaw regime and the limit of $1,563.65 per package or $4.69 per kilogram, whichever is\n\nthe higher, imposed by the Hague Visby Rules. It also submitted a table showing the\n\nlimitation limits under nine different regimes, most of which were higher than that\n\nprovided by cl 27. Patec submitted that the limitation amount provided for under cl 27 was\n\nnot reasonable in comparison with these other limits.73.\n\n        Trans-Link argued that it would be wrong to\n\njudge the reasonableness of cl 27 by comparing it with the other limits available under\n\nthe various transport conventions. If Patec’s argument was to be accepted, then all\n\nconventions should have the same liability limits and this could not be so in the\n\ninternational transport industry simply because different conventions cater for different\n\ncargo and different circumstances. Thus, Trans-Link submitted, it would only be relevant\n\nto look at limitation of liability clauses of other associations of freight forwarders.\n\nThe FIATA limit was 2 SDR, the BIFA was also 2 SDR and the Hong Kong Freight\n\nForwarders’ Association limit was HK$10 ($2.50) per kilogram. Further, the Hague\n\nVisby Rules provides for a 2 SDR limit. When all these limits are compared with the $5 per\n\nkilogram limit under cl 27, the latter is clearly seen to be reasonable.74.\n\n        The need for a limitation of liability clause\n\nin the freight forwarding context was considered in the English appeal case ofOverseas\n\nMedical Supplies Limited v Orient Transport Services Limited[1999] EWCA Civ 1449. In\n\nthat case, the reasonableness of cl 29(A) of BIFA, which was a financial limitation\n\nclause, was considered by the court. The defendant was contractually obliged to arrange\n\nfor insurance on behalf of the plaintiff but failed to do so. The defendant then sought to\n\nrely on cl 29(A) to limit its liability. The court held that whilst the financial\n\nlimitation clause was not reasonable in respect of the forwarder’s obligation to\n\ninsure (which was in issue), it was reasonable in respect of the forwarder’s general\n\nliability. Potter LJ cited the following part of the trial judge’s (Judge Kenney)\n\ndecision with approval:‘In the transport business,\n\n    as I have said, losses are common and frequently unavoidable. That is not so in arranging\n\n    insurance of the kind with which we are concerned here. The scope for things to go wrong\n\n    is vastly less and there is usually an opportunity to put things right, because the\n\n    arrangements have to be settled prior to the commencement of the risk. Equally, in my\n\n    judgment, fairness and reasonableness of limiting liability in each case cannot be\n\n    equated. In the transport business owner and carrier are likely to be insured. The\n\n    owner’s insurance which is indemnity insurance, would be cheaper than the\n\n    carrier’s liability insurance. Sorting out the carrier’s liability for loss can\n\n    be a complex, uncertain and expensive process. Therefore limitations or even exclusions of\n\n    liability for the carrier are apt to be considered reasonable.’75.\n\n        It is clear from the foregoing that limitation\n\nof liability clauses are wide spread in the transport industry. Some of them have even\n\nbeen given the force of law like the Hague Visby Rules and the Warsaw regime. The limits\n\napplicable vary widely but as far as freight forwarders are concerned, the limit in cl 27\n\nappears to be at the higher end of the scale. It is also important that cl 29 envisaged a\n\nsituation in which in consideration of a special payment the limit would be increased to\n\nthe value of the goods. Clause 27 therefore was capable of adjustment by a monetary means.\n\nIt is clear from the CoA that Trans-Link’s freight for the carriage was based on the\n\nweight of the goods. In such circumstances, it is reasonable that its liability is also\n\nbased on weight and that if the customer desires an increased liability on the part of the\n\nforwarder, it should also have to pay an increased tariff.76.\n\n        Patec argued that cl 27 was unreasonable\n\nbecause Trans-Link was insured and there was no evidence that Trans-Link had insufficient\n\nresources to satisfy Patec’s claim. It must, however, be emphasised that Patec was\n\nitself insured. It was expressly stated in the quotation and at cl 3 of the CoA that it\n\nwas Patec’s responsibility to arrange insurance to cover the machine during transport\n\nto the exhibition, display at the exhibition and during its return voyage. Patec accepted\n\nthat it could have asked Trans-Link to arrange the insurance for a higher freight. That\n\noption was rejected. More importantly, Patec’s insurance was a cargo policy and, as\n\nrecognised in theOverseas Medical Suppliescase, would most likely be cheaper than\n\nthe liability policy which Trans-Link had taken out. Therefore, there was never the\n\npossibility that Pateck would be left without recourse for the full damage. On this basis,\n\nit was reasonable for Trans-Link to limit its liability in accordance with the terms of cl\n\n27.77.\n\n        Patec also submitted that it only had a limited\n\nchoice of contractors for on-site handling at BITEC. It argued that Trans-Link was in a\n\nstrong bargaining position since the other companies who offered similar services traded\n\non similar trading conditions. It also submitted that it had no opportunity of entering a\n\nsimilar contract with anyone else without the exemption clause. There was no effective or\n\npracticable free choice available to it to select freight forwarders on terms other than\n\nthe SFFA Conditions.78.\n\n        The evidence, however, was that whilst there\n\nwas limited choice for on-site handling at the exhibition hall, there was full freedom of\n\nchoice for Patec in respect of the transport of the machine up to the door step of BITEC.\n\nIn fact, had Patec wanted to avoid the SFFA Conditions entirely, it could have engaged its\n\nusual land contractor Mr Eric Wong who appeared to trade without any limiting terms and\n\nconditions. Patec’s decision to engage Trans-Link was, however, according to its\n\nevidence, viewed as a commercially sensible decision as it obtained a complete package\n\nfrom Trans-Link. Patec did not consider Eric Wong for this reason and it rejected the\n\ncompeting bid from Rogers who was also offering a complete package because\n\nTrans-Link’s prices were more competitive. The decision to engage Trans-Link was\n\ntherefore a calculated one with a view to minimising costs and in the interest of\n\npracticability and convenience given the various options available to Patec. I accept\n\nTrans-Link’s submission that when a party chooses to engage a forwarder out of\n\nconvenience and price, it can hardly be said that the forwarder had the superior position\n\nalleged by Patec. Patec did have bargaining power and it chose Trans-Link as its freight\n\nforwarder after carefully considering its other options.79.\n\n        In the light of all the circumstances of this\n\ncontract, I find cl 27 to be reasonable. Trans-Link is entitled to limit its liability to\n\n$100,000.Conclusion80.\n\n        There will be judgment for Patec in the sum of\n\n$100,000. I will hear the parties on costs.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
