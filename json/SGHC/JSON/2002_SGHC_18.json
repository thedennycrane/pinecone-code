        "Introduction": "1. Steelcrete Construction & Engineering Pte Ltd (the plaintiffs)\n\nwere incorporated in Singapore in 1992 and are building contractors. James Low (the\n\ndefendant) is a businessman dealing in pet foods and is the regional wholesale distributor\n\nfor certain pet products (including dog/bird foods, accessories and shampoo) while his\n\nwife is a professional pet groomer. The defendant had also operated a pet shop for more\n\nthan 15 years. In that regard, he owned/owns a company Pets 'N' Pedigree Pte Ltd\n\n(previously known as Pet Resorts Pte Ltd). The third party is a sole-proprietorship of one\n\nChan Yew Fai (Chan) who is a professional engineer by training and qualification.",
        "The facts": "2. In 1996, the defendant decided to build/develop a farm for the\n\npurposes of breeding, training and boarding dogs (the project). To that end and purpose,\n\nhe applied for and obtained, under an agreement dated 2 May 1996 (the lease) a piece of\n\nleasehold land at Pasir Ris Drive 12 (the site) from the Primary Production Department\n\n(PPD) which is now known as the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA);\n\nthe site was part of Loyang Agrotechnology Park. Having secured the site, the defendant\n\nthen called for tenders for the project in November 1996. Nine (9) contractors (including\n\nthe plaintiffs and the defendant's own brother Low Teck Soon using his firm's name Plus\n\nFactor Builder) tendered for construction of the project. However, none were awarded the\n\ncontract for the project when the tender closed on 27 November 1996 and, the plaintiffs\n\nwere refunded the deposit for their tender price of $1,613,289; the project was held in\n\nabeyance.3. In January-February 1997, the plaintiffs' director Teo Hock Lee\n\n(Teo) was contacted by the defendant and, following what Teo described as 'heavy\n\nnegotiations' between them which continued until May 1997, the plaintiffs were awarded a\n\ncontract for the project at the lump sum price of $1,270,000 (the contract sum). Strangely\n\nenough, the plaintiffs and the defendant signed two (2) contracts, prepared by Chan (on\n\nthe defendant's instructions), based on the Singapore Institute of Architects' (SIA)\n\nBuilding Contract (Lump Sum) both dated 28 May 1997, one in the contract sum (the\n\ncontract) and the other for $1,613,289 (the second contract). Equally perplexing was the\n\nfact that before the two (2) contracts were signed, Chan issued identical letters (2) of\n\naward to the plaintiffs one dated 20 May and the other dated 26 May, 1997 (the letters of\n\naward), the first in the sum of $1,270,000 and the other in the sum of $1,613,289. The\n\ndefendant appointed Chan as the 'Qualified Person' for the project (for both 'structural'\n\nand 'architectural' works), as required under s 6(3) of the Building Control Act Cap 29,\n\nby a letter dated 2 July 1996 (the letter of appointment) wherein he agreed to engage Chan\n\nas the principal consultant, at a lump sum fee of $52,000.4. The plaintiffs' scope of works comprised the following:-a.one indoor training ground building;b.one office building;c.one utility room building;d.one residence;e.two catteries;f.four kennels;g.internal driveway drain;h.sanitary lines including chambers and sewerage treatment plant;i.entrance culvert.which (according to the plaintiffs but not told to Chan until later)\n\nwas agreed to be constructed in three (3) phases with the third and final phase to be\n\ncompleted by 31 December 1999, as required by PPD/AVA. According to Teo, the following\n\nitems were also discussed and agreed between the parties (but denied by the defendant):-i.there would be no retention sums;ii.there would be no performance bond (amounting to 10% of the contract sum);iii.all progress claims would be submitted to the defendant for payment;iv.the third party would not issue interim certificates of payment;v.items in the second contract would be substituted/varied.I should add that the above items contradicted the terms of the two (2)\n\ncontracts signed by the parties as well as the letters of award as in the latter, Chan had\n\nrequested the plaintiffs to furnish a performance bond, insurance and workmen's\n\ncompensation policies to his office as soon as possible. Teo prepared a hand-written work\n\nschedule (see AB280) which he said the defendant agreed to as, subsequently he typed and\n\nfaxed it to the defendant who signed and faxed it back to him. Teo did procure insurance\n\npolicies for third-party liability (in the sum of $1,270,000) and workmen's compensation\n\n(in the sum of $254,000) for the project.5. The plaintiffs commenced construction on the project on or about 1\n\nOctober 1997, after receipt of the Building Plan Approval dated 29 September 1997.\n\nEarlier, they had also received a Notice of Permit to Commence Works dated 7 June 1997. It\n\nwas only when construction of the project was well underway, namely on 16 July 1999, that\n\nChan was requested by the defendant to administer the contract. Prior thereto, up to 12\n\nJuly 1999, the plaintiffs claimed (but which the defendant denied) that the defendant\n\nhimself administered the contract. Chan’s office however did supervise the\n\nplaintiffs’ construction. Whenever Teo or the defendant requested for inspection,\n\nChan or his assistant Chua Kay Soon Raymond (Chua) would visit the site. By July 1999, the\n\nplaintiffs had submitted their 5thprogress claim and had received\n\npart-payments totalling $400,000 on their previous four (4) progress claims (inclusive of\n\nGST amounting to $12,000). The balance of $411,224.91 outstanding on the earlier progress\n\nclaims was not and never paid by the defendant. The first three (3) progress claims of the\n\nplaintiffs were addressed to Pet Resorts Pte Ltd while the 4thwas addressed to\n\nPets 'N' Pedigree Pte Ltd; Teo testified this was at the defendant's request (which was\n\ndenied). The 5thprogress payment was forwarded to Chan and was addressed to\n\nthe defendant. Because of the defendant's refusal/inability to pay the balance on the\n\nplaintiffs' first four (4) progress payments, Teo alleged that it caused the plaintiffs in\n\nturn to suffer cash flow problems.6. A meeting was held on 9 July 1999 (the first meeting) attended by\n\nTeo, the defendant, the defendant's brother Low Teck Soon (Low), an architect Anthony Lim\n\nMeng Siah (Anthony Lim) and Chua from Chan's office. At the meeting (as minuted by Low),\n\nthe defendant expressed concern over the works being behind schedule; he requested a\n\ncatch-up programme from the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs did not agree with the minutes of\n\nthe meeting because (according to Teo) a number of items Teo brought up at the discussion\n\nwere not recorded. He denied that the plaintiffs were behind schedule or, that the\n\ndefendant had requested a work schedule from him in March 1998. Consequently, there was no\n\nreason for him to provide a 'catch-up' programme as minuted. The first meeting was\n\nfollowed by a second meeting on 12 July 1999 which Teo did not attend because (he said) he\n\nwas neither informed nor invited.7. By July 1999, the plaintiffs had completed the office block, utility\n\nroom, pet shop, kennels 3 and 4, main entrance fencing as well as the electrical works.\n\nTeo claimed that as work progressed, the defendant made various changes to the building\n\nplans (the indoor training ground was changed to a pet shop) and postponed work on phases\n\n2 and 3 due to lack of funds. Further, the defendant revised the works to be done under\n\nthe three (3) phases while sometimes, changes were required by the relevant authorities,\n\nsuch as that from sliding windows to adjustable louvre windows. The plaintiffs' solicitors\n\nhad written to Chan on 20 July 1999 (AB327) to record the substantial variations to the\n\noriginal contract.8. Teo explained that the plaintiffs did not build the sewerage plant\n\n(under the revised phase 1) because the (approved) building plans of Chan provided for a\n\n10- persons treatment plant; however, the PPD/AVA required the defendant to provide a\n\n30-persons treatment plant. The defendant was still considering the cost of constructing\n\nthe plant (for which Teo had given an estimate of $100,000-$120,000) when the plaintiffs'\n\nservices were terminated. I should point out however, that the plaintiffs did not have any\n\ncommunication with the PPD/AVA at any time. What they understood of PPD/AVA's requirements\n\nwere conveyed to them by the defendant and or Chan. Neither were they aware of the terms\n\nof the lease awarded to the defendant (although Teo knew the deadline from PPD for\n\ncompletion of the project was 31 December 1999). Consequently, the plaintiffs were unaware\n\nwhether their work schedule in 3 phases was accepted by the PPD.9. The plaintiffs continued working (solely according to Teo) on the\n\nproject until 4 September 1999; they then received a certificate of termination dated 15\n\nSeptember 1999 from Anthony Lim, who had been appointed by the defendant to take over from\n\nChan as the 'Qualified Person' for the project. After some delay (allegedly because the\n\ndefendant denied them access), the plaintiffs finally removed their equipment from the\n\nsite on 3 November 1999. Unfortunately by then (Teo said), the plaintiffs' charts and work\n\nprogrammes could no longer be found. Chan's appointment was terminated by a letter from\n\nthe defendant's solicitors dated 4 September 1999.10. Notwithstanding that the project was uncompleted, the plaintiffs\n\nalleged that the defendant used the completed structures without first obtaining a\n\ntemporary occupation permit (TOP), despite a written warning from Chan (in 1998) that it\n\nwas illegal to do so. The defendant had stored his pet food materials at the site since\n\nend 1997/early 1998 and, had leased out kennels for dogs to third parties in 1998,\n\nincluding Alpha Dog Patrol Pte Ltd, even before a proper sanitary and sewerage system was\n\ninstalled. Further, the defendant visited the site at least 3-4 days every week. On those\n\nvisits, Teo would accompany the defendant as he went round the site to verify the work for\n\nwhich the plaintiffs had submitted their progress claims.",
        "The claim": "11. In February 2001, the plaintiffs commenced Suit 139 of 2001\n\nclaiming the sum of $411,224.91 outstanding on progress claims nos. 1 to 4, the sum of\n\n$42,660.54 on progress claim no. 5 and $5,000 (excluding GST of $1,429.81) for additional\n\nworks (relating to alteration of discharge canals). There was also a claim for loss of\n\nprofits amounting to $356,096.75 thereby bringing the plaintiffs' total claim to\n\n$816,412.01. The plaintiffs had a third additional claim for damages. The plaintiffs\n\nfurther averred that the termination certificate issued by Anthony Lim was wrongful and\n\ninvalid.12. In the (lengthy) defence and counterclaim the defendant:a.denied the oral agreement set out in para 4(i) to (v) above;b.contended there was no variation from the contract that the plaintiffs\n\n      would build a 10-persons treatment plant at the sum of $20,470;c.denied there was a second contract in the amount of $1,613,289 or any\n\n      other sum;d.denied there was a variation in the commencement date, that the project\n\n      was to be completed in phases or that there was any change in the timeframe for completion\n\n      namely, 18 months from the Permit/Notice of Commencement of Works, by 6 December 1998;e.contended that the plaintiffs failed to apply for an extension of time by\n\n      21 July 1999 as required by Chan;f.alleged that the plaintiffs failed in various material aspects to comply\n\n      with all requirements relating to quality and workmanship (which he particularised);g.denied he visited the site on diverse dates to inspect the quality of\n\n      materials and goods as alleged or at all;h.professed he had no knowledge of technical matters as a layman and relied\n\n      on the integrity and expertise of the plaintiffs and Chan;i.alleged that the plaintiffs took advantage of his ignorance and misled him\n\n      into making payment although interim certificates were never issued:j.averred he had no recollection of having requested for works outside the\n\n      contract and denied he was liable for such works, for which no certificates were issued;k.denied he gave instructions to deviate from the approved plans;l.contended he was entitled to occupy some of the buildings with the consent\n\n      of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs and Chan should have but failed to inform him that, a\n\n      TOP had not been issued and they were to be blamed for any breach of the Building Control\n\n      Act;m.denied Anthony Lim was not a Qualified Person. In any case, the plaintiffs\n\n      had waived any objections to such an appointment by their solicitors' letter of consent\n\n      dated 11 September 1999;n.alleged it was the plaintiffs not he, who had repudiated the contract as\n\n      they were not willing and able to continue with the contract;o.contended that the works completed by the plaintiffs were worthless or\n\n      worth no more than the sum of $400,000 he had paid.13. Initially (April 2000), the plaintiffs commenced arbitration\n\nproceedings against the defendant, pursuant to clause 37 of the conditions of the\n\ncontract. However, as Chan was not a party to either contract, he could not be forced into\n\narbitration with the parties. Arbitration proceedings were therefore discontinued by order\n\nof court on 15 January 2001 (on the defendant's application in Originating Summons No.\n\n1876 of 2000 against the plaintiffs and Chan under s 3 of the Arbitration Act [Cap 10]\n\nthat it would otherwise result in a multiplicity of proceedings) even though dates had\n\nalready been given after 9 months' of arbitration between the parties. Clearly, the\n\ndefendant was dragging his feet. The order of court went further to direct that the\n\nplaintiffs commence fresh proceedings in the High Court and set timeframes for the filing\n\nof pleadings; Suit 139 of 2001 was commenced as a result. I should also mention that in\n\nanother (earlier) set of proceedings, (Originating Summons No. 1500 of 1999) the defendant\n\napplied for possession of the site from the plaintiffs who then applied for a stay under s\n\n7 of the Arbitration Act, by reason of the arbitration clause in the contract. The\n\nplaintiffs eventually withdrew their application while Originating Summons No. 1500 of\n\n1999 was discontinued by the defendant.14. The defendant had separately sued Chan earlier in August 2000 in\n\nSuit No. 564 of 2000 alleging that the latter had failed to exercise all due professional\n\nskill and care in the performance of his duties as the defendant's principal consultant. I\n\nshall return to the defendant's allegations against Chan in the course of my findings. On\n\nhis part, Chan filed not only a (lengthy) defence to the defendant's statement of claim\n\nbut also a counterclaim for the outstanding balance ($22,575) of his fees.15. On 15 March 2001, the court ordered Suits Nos. 564 of 2000 and 139\n\nof 2001 to be consolidated, with the earlier suit being the primary action and, that Chan\n\nbe joined as the Third Party to the later action.The plaintiffs' case16. The plaintiffs called two (2) witnesses. I have in fact outlined\n\nthe plaintiffs' case generally in paras 2-10 above. Consequently, I turn my attention now\n\nto the further evidence adduced from Teo (PW1) under cross-examination by counsel for the\n\nother two (2) parties. Questioned on why his company signed two(2) contracts with the\n\ndefendant, Teo revealed (N/E 49) that he understood that the second contract was meant for\n\nfinancing reasons when the parties went to Chan's office to sign both contracts; this was\n\nhowever denied (N/E 75) by the defendant who claimed he was able to and financed the\n\nproject, personally.17. Although the defendant denied signing it, Teo said his letter dated\n\n16 May 1997 (AB277) had been signed by the defendant when he delivered the document\n\npersonally to the defendant, and it confirmed the following terms:(i)the project would be in 3 phases with phase 1 to be completed in 6 months:(ii)commencement date would be 2 weeks from receipt of permit to commence\n\n      work;(iii)phases 2 and 3 would be discussed and fixed in due time;(iv)liquidated damages would be $200/- per day.In turn, Teo faxed the document to Chan on 19 May 1997, according to\n\nthe fax transmission on the document; however when Chan testified (N/E 222), he said he\n\ndid not have the copy in his file. On 19 March 1998 the plaintiffs faxed to the defendant\n\na work schedule (see AB467 or 2AB533) for the three (3) phases of the contract as follows:Phase 1Expected commencement dateExpected completion dateConstruction of utility1 Oct 199730 June 1998Construction of pet shop(wrongly dated 31 June)Construction of Kennel 3 & 4Construction of external worksPhase 2Construction of kennel 1 & 22 Jan 199930 June 1999Construction of external worksPhase 3Construction of catteries 1 & 22 July 199931 Dec 1999Construction of officeConstruction of residenceConstruction of external worksSurprisingly, counsel for the defendant (N/E 23) took the position that\n\nthe defendant did not sign the above work schedule even though it was clear (from the fax\n\ntransmission details) that the defendant (after appending his signature under the stamp of\n\nPet Resorts Pte Ltd) faxed it to Chan and on the following day, Chan's assistant Chua\n\nforwarded it in turn to the PPD (at 2AB534). This stand necessitated calling a\n\nrepresentative from PPD/AVA to testify. Under the above work schedule, the third and final\n\nphase was to be completed by 31 December 1999, which deadline was confirmed by PPD in\n\ntheir letter to Pet Resorts Pte Ltd dated 29 December 1998 (AB471). Teo testified that\n\nsince the defendant neither objected nor wrote to him as regards the work schedule, he\n\nassumed that the commencement date for phase 1 would be 1 October 1997 and he proceeded on\n\nthat basis. However, the commencement dates for phases 2 and 3 were not adhered to as the\n\ndefendant held him back. I also should point out phase 1 of the work schedule agreed on 19\n\nMarch 1998 differed from the earlier one dated 19 May 1997 in that the latter included an\n\noffice and residence blocks, there was no pet shop whilst the kennels to be built were 1\n\nand 3 and not 3 and 4.18. It was Teo's evidence that when he received the letter of award\n\nwith a request to furnish a performance bond, he had telephoned Chan to say no bond was\n\nrequired. Teo opined that Chan acted fairly and independently but the defendant put\n\npressure on Chan to terminate the plaintiffs' contract (N/E 35); this testimony was\n\ncorroborated by Chan (N/E 206) who said he was under pressure by the defendant's brother\n\nLow, to impose liquidated damages on the plaintiffs and to terminate their contract. Low\n\nhad also insisted that the plaintiffs furnish a bond for 10% of the full contract value\n\n(in July 1999), against Chan’s suggestion that it should be based on the balance of\n\nthe contract. When Chan indicated there were no grounds to terminate the plaintiffs’\n\ncontract, Chan’s own services were terminated. Although he was aware that Chan was\n\nstated to be the quantity surveyor in the contract, Teo said he knew Chan was not a\n\nquantity surveyor just as he knew (and so did the defendant) that Chan was not an\n\narchitect.19. Although he had agreed to commence work within 2 weeks of receipt\n\nof the permit to commence work (dated 7 June 1997), Teo testified that the plaintiffs\n\ncould not do so as the building plans were approved much later (29 September 1997). In any\n\ncase he contended that the permit to commence work did not form part of the contract\n\ndocuments. Further, neither the defendant nor Chan wrote to the plaintiffs to request that\n\nthey commence work nor was a date for commencement inserted into the contract. After\n\nsigning the contract, the defendant was still uncertain on the phases for the project.\n\nEven so, while waiting for approval of the building plans, the plaintiffs mobilised their\n\nequipment, workers and carried out site organisation work. I should point out that\n\naccording to the letter from the PPD dated 24 August 1998 (2AB542) to the defendant, the\n\nlatter was supposed to finish 5 of the 10 approved farm structures by 29 September 1998;\n\nthis the defendant failed to do as by September 1998, only three (3) structures had been\n\nerected.20. Teo testified that amendments were made to approved drawings\n\nsometimes on Chan's instructions and at other times at the personal (verbal) request of\n\nthe defendant including:-a.dismantling the completed chain-link fence and constructing a brick wall\n\n      instead with welded mesh on top;b.dismantling the diseased animals ward and replacing with 2 rooms;c.constructing the kennels to the edge of the internal drain instead of to\n\n      the edge of the kennel boundary so as to give the animals an opportunity to exercise;d.building a full brick wall without fence instead of a high fence with\n\n      brick wall;e.constructing a concrete finish yard in place of a sand finish yard;f.repositioning and reducing the width of the drain running through the\n\n      kennels;g.changing the glass windows in each block to adjustable glass louvres when\n\n      approval was obtained to change the indoor training ground to a pet shop;h.changing the design of the main gate.Questioned by counsel for Chan, Teo testified he did not inform Chan of\n\nthe changes effected at the defendant's request; he felt it was the defendant's duty to do\n\nso. As far as Teo was aware, neither did the defendant inform Chan. As far as item 20(g)\n\nwas concerned, he said the defendant complained of the change in windows onlyafterthe plaintiffs had commenced arbitration, well after the louvre windows had been installed\n\nand seen at site by the defendant.21. Teo maintained that the 30-persons treatment plant was outside the\n\nplaintiffs' scope of works in any event as, the plaintiffs' contractual obligation was to\n\nbuild a 10- persons treatment plant. However, they were informed by Chan that the Ministry\n\nof the Environment (MOE) would only approve a 30-persons treatment plant. Teo then\n\nrendered a fresh quotation for such a plant at the defendant's request which the latter\n\nrejected as too expensive. Instead, the defendant obtained a quotation in the sum of\n\n$70,000 from another contractor (Yong Yang Construction) in June 1999 to whom he\n\ncounter-offered $50,000 but, which was rejected (see AB528). Teo had then informed the\n\ndefendant that the work schedule needed to be adjusted as, the plaintiffs' completion of\n\nphase 1 hinged on the 30-persons treatment plant which work the plaintiffs had to\n\nco-ordinate with the defendant's contractor. However, the defendant never raised the\n\nsubject again after the first discussion on or about 18 June 1999; neither did he appoint\n\nany contractor for the revised treatment plant. Teo surmised it was because the defendant\n\nwas in financial difficulties.22. Teo disputed the defendant's claim of ignorance as a layman. On the\n\ncontrary, the defendant was a shrewd and experienced businessman who visited the site\n\nregularly and was apprised on the works in progress by him and, the defendant was able to\n\nvary the contract with regards to interim certificates. Teo said the defendant was even\n\nable to provide a layout plan to Chan by a fax dated 8 January 1997 (see 2AB79-80).23. As for the meeting on 9 July 1999, Teo said the concerns he raised\n\nwere not recorded, namely the urgency of the construction of the 30 persons treatment\n\nplant and when the work under the remaining phases 2 and 3 should be done. He disagreed\n\nwith the minutes on these items:a.the plaintiffs' work schedule was very much behind schedule;b.the plaintiffs should submit a catch-up programme on 16 July 1999;c.that the plaintiffs had failed to furnish a banker's guarantee up to that\n\n      date and were required to furnish one if they intended to continue with the contract;d.that the plaintiffs were in delay for about 12 months and liquidated\n\n      damages were $200 per day;e.the plaintiffs were to apply to Chan for extensions of time.Consequently, he faxed (on 20 July 1999) the plaintiffs' undated letter\n\nto the defendant to record his disagreement with the minutes.24. As stated in para 6 above, Teo was unaware of the second meeting\n\nheld on 12 July 1999. However, it was attended by Chan (and Low) who wrote to the\n\nplaintiffs on 16 July 1999 (AB291) referring to the same and requiring the plaintiffs to\n\nsubmit that very day, progress claims for work done, applications for extensions of time\n\n(substantiated), variations claims and a programme for completion of outstanding works.\n\nWhen the plaintiffs (not surprisingly) did not respond, Chan sent a reminder dated 20 July\n\n1999 (see AB293). However, Teo said he did forward to Chan evidence of the plaintiffs'\n\nperformance bond and insurance, after 19 July 1999. Teo reiterated that it was orally\n\nagreed between himself and the defendant that no performance bond was required as, if\n\nindeed it was called for, the plaintiffs would have had no difficulty in coming up with a\n\nbond for $127,000 (10% of the contract sum).25. Questioned why the plaintiffs had contended (in their pleadings)\n\nthat the notice of termination issued by Anthony Lim was invalid, Teo explained it was\n\nbecause the former had to be first registered with the Building Control Authority as a\n\n'qualified person' for the project before he could issue such a notice.26. I had earlier mentioned the plaintiffs' claim for loss of (gross)\n\nprofits in passing. Cross-examined, Teo explained that his figure ($356,096.75) was based\n\non blocks he had not yet constructed but for which he had already fabricated some trusses\n\nwhich he removed from the site and sold off as scrap when the plaintiffs' contract was\n\nterminated.27. The plaintiffs' other witness was professional engineer Jonathan\n\nPortwood (Portwood). The plaintiffs' quantity surveyor John Priestley was not called to\n\ntestify although he had filed his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. The reason was because I\n\nhad informed the parties at the outset that I was only determining liability and quantum\n\nof the plaintiffs' claim, should I rule in their favour, would be assessed by the\n\nRegistrar at a later stage, with further evidence on quantum to be adduced if necessary,\n\nfrom witnesses such as John Priestley. For the same reason, the defendant's quantity\n\nsurveyor Lim Ang Beng Hock did not testify and neither did Chan's expert, professional\n\nengineer Shek Kam Chew.28. Consequently, Portwood was the plaintiffs' only other witness. He\n\nwas appointed by the plaintiffs to check the welding works/trusses for the buildings they\n\nhad erected at the site. For the purpose, Portwood visited the site on 28 May and 20 June\n\n2001 and, he was provided with copies of:(i)the reports (3) of Setsco Services Pte Ltd (Setsco);(ii)the letter dated 19 May 2000 (with report attached) to the defendant from\n\n      PP Project Consultants (Project Consultants);(iii)the (coring) test results of RAK Materials Consultants Pte Ltd (RAK)commissioned by the defendant. The several reports cast doubt on the\n\nconcrete strength and structural integrity of the buildings. In brief, Setsco had reported\n\nthat the weld sizes/thickness were below those specified in the drawings, two (2) trusses\n\nwere missing from the roof of the utility room while some trusses were not fully/properly\n\nwelded. Project Consultants' professional engineer Looi Poh Yun (Looi) itemised eight (8)\n\nconstruction defects in his aforesaid letter and made five (5) recommendations.29. In his written testimony, Portwood opined that while some welding\n\n(kennels 3 and 4) were less than what had been specified in the drawings, they were\n\nnonetheless of reasonable and consistent quality for that type of building; the defects\n\nwere certainly not life-threatening. Portwood said he based his opinion on the\n\nPWD-approved structural drawings and the relevant extract from the British Standards Code\n\nof Practice (seeP2) applicable at the time of construction. He testified he had\n\nclimbed up the roof during his inspection to check the welds of the trusses there. He\n\ndisagreed with Setsco's findings that the thickness was 3-5mm when the drawings called for\n\n6mm; the thickness appeared to be more like 4-5mm for what he believed were the heaviest\n\ntrusses for each building. However, he did observe that some bolts and isolated welds were\n\nmissing and recommended that they should be inserted and welded respectively, save for\n\ntruss number 3 in the utility room which was not in the drawing and hence, could not be\n\nsaid to be missing.30. Portwood also criticised the coring tests carried out by Setsco;\n\nthe location plans for the tests were inaccurate and it was hard to tell where they had\n\ncarried out the coring for the tests conducted by RAK. Further, although RAK’s report\n\nshowed the office building contained low concrete levels, his visual inspection indicated\n\nno signs of structural distress or significant cracking in that area. The areas which\n\nindicated low concrete were the external apron slabs of the pet shop, the utility room,\n\nkennels and the office block. However, those were non-critical load bearing structures\n\nwhich should be hacked up and the concrete recast. Portwood recommended that load tests\n\nshould first be carried out to determine whether the slabs needed to be removed or merely\n\nstrengthened. In that regard, Portwood testified that the plaintiffs attempted to do a\n\nload test at the site on Saturday 30 June 2001 but could not gain entry. All other cores\n\ninside buildings showed acceptable concrete strength, including the pet shop. The rusting\n\nof the kennels was attributable to bird droppings and failure to remove the same; he\n\nproduced a summary (seeP3) of his findings.",
        "The defendant's case": "31. The plaintiffs' various allegations were all denied by the\n\ndefendant as reflected in his lengthy defence. This included denying having discussions\n\nwith the plaintiffs; he said his discussions were with Chan’s assistant. He could not\n\nrecall whether he had sent copies of the plaintiffs' first four progress payments to Chan\n\n(N/E 100). He also denied he had agreed to the change from sliding to louvre windows for\n\nthe indoor training ground. He maintained that construction of the sewage treatment plant\n\nhad no bearing on completion of the farm and denied (N/E 93) he was not interested to\n\nbuild the treatment plant as at 6 December 1998 because he lacked the funds. I should\n\npoint out however, that the defendant's testimony was contradicted by that of his own\n\nexpert Looi (N/E 158) who confirmed that no TOP or partial TOP, can be obtained for the\n\nproject without a sewage treatment plant.32. In the initial stages of his oral testimony, the defendant\n\nrepeatedly prefaced his answer with the statement ‘I don’t know anything'to questions from counsel for the other two (2) parties. Eventually, I interjected and\n\nadvised the defendant that such a stock answer did little to help his case. Even then, I\n\nwas prompted at a later stage (N/E 113) to remind the defendant that his answer was highly\n\nunsatisfactory. When Chan testified (N/E218) and was questioned by the court, he disagreed\n\nthat the defendantdidn’t know anything.33. I shall first set out the more significant aspects of the\n\ndefendant’s testimony. He alleged that his understanding that Chan was an architect\n\nas well as a professional engineer came from Chan's assistant. He had told Chua that any\n\nchanges had to have written confirmation from him whereas the alleged variation work of\n\nthe plaintiffs was not. He denied he instructed Teo to do additional works (which included\n\ninstallation of false ceilings in the pet shop/utility room) notwithstanding numerous\n\nletters to him from the plaintiffs confirming such additional works (see AB283 and 286) --\n\nhe only instructed tiling for the office block (N/E 124). The defendant claimed he knew\n\nnothing about building a pet farm let alone the training/breeding of dogs. He further\n\nalleged that he paid the plaintiffs direct on their progress claims on the advice of Chua\n\n(with whom he mainly dealt and who had told the defendant that Chan/he were not involved\n\nin payments). He paid the plaintiffs without checking that the works claimed for had been\n\ndone; this was because he did not understand interim certificates at the time and was not\n\nfamiliar with building contracts. Yet in his fax to Chan on 9 July 1996 (see 2AB14), it\n\nwas noted that the defendant required Chan to include a title-deed land survey in Chan's\n\nquotation of $52,000 to act as consultant. Questioned on this fax, the defendant said he\n\nincluded the requirement on the advice of a neighbour (Ericsson Pet Farm). The defendant\n\nwas also able to pass drawings to Chan/Chua to help them to design the pet farm; he said\n\nhe obtained them from a very famous company in the United States. He explained he was able\n\nto provide a layout plan of the utility/storage room in his letter dated 8 January 1997\n\n(2AB79-80) to Chan because both the letter and plan were drafted by Chua.34. The defendant said he was not told by Chan or Chua that Chan’s\n\nscope of works did not include administration of the project; he denied he administered\n\nthe contract himself. If it was not Chan's responsibility to administer the contract, the\n\ndefendant wondered why he had to make eight (8) monthly progress payments of $1,450 each\n\nto Chan, under the letter of appointment. When asked why he had not corrected the minutes\n\nfor the second meeting wherein it was recorded (item 5.1) that Chan had stated he was not\n\nadministering the contract, the defendant said it was because he was more concerned with\n\nthe catch-up programme (N/E 102). He gave the same answer when questioned why he did not\n\nrebut Chan's letter to him dated 16 July 1999 (2AB615) stating that Chan would henceforth\n\ntake over administration of the contract. When his attention was drawn to his letter dated\n\n6 August 1999 (AB480-481) to Chan wherein he had itemised all the plaintiffs' works which\n\nwere not in compliance with drawings, the defendant said it was done on the advice of Low.35. Queried why he had signed the second contract, the defendant\n\nprofessed ignorance (N/E 80-81) saying he signed many documents and did not know; the\n\nquestion should be directed to Chan. Although he agreed that it was strange of Chan to\n\nissue two (2) letters of award to the plaintiffs, the defendant said (N/E 113) he merely\n\nfiled up the second letter of award dated 26 May 1997 (AB279) for $1,613,289 – he may\n\nhave thought Chan made a mistake, or he may have overlooked it or he may have thought it\n\nrelated to the first letter of award, notwithstanding the vast difference of $343,289\n\nbetween the figures in the two letters. Indeed, it was the defendant's evidence that most\n\nof the time, he filed up the correspondence he received from the plaintiffs/Chan without\n\nreading as'he left the project to them'(N/E 129).36. Although the defendant initially claimed that he had handed a copy\n\nof the lease to Chan such that the latter knew all the terms and conditions therein, this\n\nwas retracted under cross-examination. Similarly, under cross-examination (N/E 111), the\n\ndefendant agreed that construction was to be in three (3) phases. Yet in the next breadth\n\n(N/E 112), he maintained it was still wrong of Chan to allow construction in three (3)\n\nphases as alleged in his statement of claim in Suit 564 of 2000. When he was shown Chan's\n\nletter to him dated 10 August 1999 advising him that occupation without a TOP was illegal,\n\nthe defendant also shifted his stand and said he was unaware of the requirement when he\n\nfirst occupied the buildings in 1998. He further justified his occupation by pointing to\n\nthe fact that his neighbour Topbreed Trading had occupied their premises for five (5)\n\nyears before they obtained TOP. In any case, Alpha Dog Patrol Pte Ltd helped him to look\n\nafter the site. During cross-examination (see N/E 117-118) the defendant withdrew his\n\nallegation that he relied on the tender results in selecting the plaintiffs but he still\n\ninsisted that Chan failed to award the contract to a competent contractor. Further,\n\nalthough counsel for Chan drew his attention to the fact that it was the Central Building\n\nPlan Unit which required the construction of a 30-persons treatment plant in June 1997\n\n(see 2AB438), the defendant maintained his pleaded case that it was Chan who had\n\nwrongfully allowed the 10-persons plant to be varied.37. The defendant alleged that the plaintiffs' services were terminated\n\nbecause they refused to provide a catch-up programme. Notwithstanding his pleaded case\n\nthat the plaintiffs' works were either worthless or only worth what he had paid ($400,000)\n\nthem, the defendant admitted that his only complaint as regards kennels 3 and 4 was, they\n\nwere rusty. Questioned by the court, he agreed that if the rust could be rectified, he\n\nwould accept the kennels, subject to what his experts had to say. He claimed that although\n\nhe visited the site weekly, it was only for short periods to store his supplies.38. Although one of his main complaints against the plaintiffs was the\n\ndelay in completing the project (before he terminated their services), the defendant only\n\nrequested his new consultant Looi to obtain TOP in the last quarter of 2000 although he\n\nhad appointed Looi (whom he first approached in the last quarter of 1999) as early as 23\n\nJanuary 2000; the defendant could not explain the delay.39. A senior officer from PPD/AVA, Lim Bock Seng (Lim), was called as a\n\nwitness on the plaintiffs' work schedule. Lim (DW2) confirmed that his department did\n\nreceive the work schedule on 23 March 1998 (seeD1) from Chan but its copy did not\n\nhave the defendant' signature. Consequently, his testimony did little to assist the court.40. Looi (DW3), a professional engineer (in civil engineering) was the\n\ndefendant's last witness. He was the author of the report by Project Consultants relied on\n\nby the defendant to support the contention that the buildings erected by the plaintiffs\n\nwere structurally unsound. In his report (D2) Looi said he studied the tender\n\nspecifications and approved plans when he was appointed by the defendant to take over from\n\nChan. He then inspected the site and discovered many discrepancies between what was\n\nconstructed and the specifications/plans as well as a number of defects. Consequently, he\n\nhad advised the defendant to defer applying for TOP until details and other items were\n\nrectified.41. Looi's main complaint was the inadequate welding of the joints in\n\nthe steel structures and the inadequate thickness of the concrete slabs and footings,\n\nwhich deficiencies were addressed by Portwood in his evidence (paras 28-30supra).\n\nHe had relied on the tests carried out by Setsco and RAK. Looi was unyielding in his\n\nrejection of the plaintiffs' workmanship; he had recommended to the Commissioner of\n\nBuildings (by his letter dated 18 June 2001 at 2DB3) that the office block should be\n\ndemolished and rebuilt and, the other structures rectified. When cross-examined, Looi\n\nagreed that rectification of weak footings may not require such a drastic measure as\n\ndemolition of the entire building. He opined however, that load tests were unnecessary and\n\nirrelevant for under-strength footings.42. Looi agreed with counsel for Chan there was nothing structurally\n\nwrong with the concrete slabs as they sat on the ground, even though their thickness was\n\nless than what was specified; admittedly, insufficient concrete in slabs would not affect\n\nthe buildings' safety although it meant that the plaintiffs were short on quality. As for\n\nthe concrete footings, Looi said he was prepared to consider the plaintiffs' proposals to\n\nstrengthen them by way of rectification. However he refused to do the necessary\n\ncalculations to determine the actual strength of the footings, saying that was not his\n\nduty. When shown the calculations (TP5) done by Chan, Looi did not disagree.\n\nAccording to Setsco's tests, 2 out of 10 footings were unacceptable.43. Looi was prepared to accept Portwood's recommendation that missing\n\nbolts and welds should be inserted where necessary. With regard to welds, Looi agreed with\n\nChan's counsel that SISIR's code of practice (2AB780C) provided an acceptable standard.\n\nLooi's attention was drawn to the fact that SISIR's standard for minimum thickness for\n\nwelds in accordance with the approved drawings was 3mm and, Portwood's summary (P1)\n\nof welds done by plaintiffs based on Setsco's test results showed no welds were below 3mm;\n\nhe then admitted that the welds were not defective; he said he had relied on British\n\nstandards although Singapore standards were in no way inferior.44. Another criticism by Looi pertained to the inspection chambers, the\n\nconstruction of which he alleged did not comply with MOE's Code of Practice for Sanitary\n\nPlumbing and Drainage System (the Code) – they were incomplete, had no proper\n\nconcrete covers and there were holes in the ground. He complained that the underground\n\npipes (beneath the driveway) were made of PVC instead of cast iron; the driveway was also\n\nnot properly constructed, neither was the drain (being constructed of bricks instead of\n\nconcrete). Counsel for the plaintiffs drew Looi's attention to the discrepancy between his\n\nfinding and that of the defendant's quantity surveyor Lim Ang Beng Hock, who said the\n\npipes were made of clay. That was again to be contrasted with the invoice of the\n\nplaintiffs' plumbing sub-contractors OCS-Contractors Pte Ltd (dated 26 July 1999 at AB545)\n\nwhich stated that UPVC pipes were laid. Looi agreed with counsel that unlike PVC, UPVC is\n\nan acceptable material for sanitary drainage system, according to the Code. He volunteered\n\nthe information that UPVC is more heavy duty than PVC. When pressed by counsel for Chan\n\n(N/E 187), Looi was unable to identify any provision/section in the Code that stipulated\n\nwhat materials pipes must be made of.45. Photographs were attached to Looi's report which had been taken in\n\nOctober 1999. Looi took new photographs in the first quarter of 2000 after his\n\nappointment; these showed the inspection chambers in worse condition than that reflected\n\nin his earlier photographs. It was revealed to Looi in cross-examination by Chan's\n\ncounsel, that the plaintiffs were not furnished with plans for construction of the\n\ninspection chambers. Hence, the plaintiffs' only recourse was to follow the specifications\n\nof MOE's Code for such construction.46. Although Looi's report had referred to trial holes he had made to\n\ncheck the inspection chambers, he was unable to pin-point their locations; he said he had\n\nmade random checks. Neither was he on site when Setsco took concrete core samples on 29\n\nMarch 2001 for tests to be carried out, although done at his request (when the defendant\n\ntold him of this case). As such, Looi was unable to confirm where the samples came from.\n\nConsequently, in the midst of Looi's cross-examination and in the light of his\n\ndisagreement with counsel on the exact location of the pipes/inspection chambers, I\n\ndirected all parties (with their respective counsel) to visit the site.47. After the visit on 9 July 2001, it was reported back to me that all\n\nthree (3) parties agreed that the pipes between inspection chambers were made of cast\n\niron, the dispute was whether they were made of heavy cast iron (as the plaintiffs\n\ncontended) or only cast iron. Additional photographs were taken by Looi which confirmed\n\nthat the pipes were indeed made of UPVC (N/E 170). I was also informed that the parties\n\nfound only one (1) trial hole previously done by Looi (between inspection chambers 2a and\n\n2) and Looi had agreed there were no others. I was moved to comment to Looi (N/E 171) that\n\nthe excavations/inspections which counsel for the defendant proposed then to carry out\n\nshould have been done by Looi 1 years earlier, to determine the material used for the\n\nunderground pipes. As the site inspection still did not resolve the dispute between the\n\nplaintiffs and the defendant, I ordered parties to re-visit the site after which Teo would\n\nbe recalled to the witness stand. I further ordered that the costs of recalling Teo and\n\nany prolonging of the trial would be borne by the defendant in any event since no\n\nsatisfactory explanation was given why such inspection/excavation could not have been done\n\nby or for Looi, 18 months earlier. In that regard, I rejected Looi's later explanation\n\n(when questioned by counsel for Chan) that his duty was to apply for TOP and he was\n\nconcerned with structural parts not non-structural items like galvanising of pipes\n\n(N/E181); he had chosen to comment on non-structural items in his report, including\n\nplumbing and sewage.48. A second site inspection was made by the parties on 10 July 2001.\n\nBoth Teo and Chan confirmed the pipes were indeed made of UPVC. Teo added (when recalled\n\nto the stand) that he was willing to reduce his claim to take into account the inadequate\n\nfootings; he said he had earlier offered to rectify the defect but his offer was rejected.\n\nHe was also prepared to omit his claim for 6-7m in length of the sewage pipes.49. When his attention was drawn to Chan's fee of $52,000, Looi\n\nexpressed no opinion on whether it included contract administration; he said it depended\n\non the oral agreement between the parties, as Chan's duties were clearly spelt out in the\n\nletter of appointment. Although he was aware, Looi did not know when the plaintiffs'\n\nservices were actually terminated. More significant was the revelation by Looi (N/E 195)\n\nthat since his appointment, the defendant had done nothing by way of rectification works,\n\nbecause the defendant was not prepared to spend any more money.",
        "The third party's case": "50. In his written testimony, Chan deposed it was the defendant who had\n\napproached him, based on the recommendation of Topbreed Trading Company (Topbreed) for\n\nwhom Chan had also acted as the project consultant, when Topbreed built a dog farm three\n\n(3) lots away from the site. Chan had set out the terms and conditions for his services in\n\nthe letter of appointment which the defendant accepted on 9 July 1996 by a letter (2AB14)\n\nwritten on the letterhead of Outram Marketing Services. Although the defendant's said\n\nletter stated he would instruct his solicitor to follow-up with Chan on the terms and\n\nconditions of the letter of appointment, the defendant never did. The letter of\n\nappointment did not include administration of the contract; hence Chan was not responsible\n\nfor certification and control of payments to the plaintiffs until he was specifically\n\ninstructed to do so on 12 July 1999. Neither did the letter of appointment cover design\n\nand installation of electrical works. Earlier, when cross-examining the defendant, Chan's\n\ncounsel had drawn the defendant's attention to the letterhead used by Chan for the letter\n\nof appointment; it clearly stated at the lower left corner:Consulting architect: Freddie Chia Ho KhengConsulting engineer: Francis Chan Yaw FaiConsequently, the defendant could not have engaged Chan as nor thought\n\nhe was, an architect; he well-knew Chan was an engineer. Further, Chan had applied to the\n\nDirector-General of Public Works for a waiver of the requirement for an architect’s\n\nsignature on the plans and it was granted on 26 September 1997. Plans submitted by Chan\n\nwere signed by him in the capacity of professional engineer and endorsed with the\n\ndefendant’s signature. Chan had also given his business card to the defendant.51. Chan denied the defendant's allegation that he failed to award the\n\ncontract to a competent contractor, it was not he but the defendant who appointed the\n\nplaintiffs which appointment was not based on the results of the tender; even the lowest\n\ntender exceeded the defendant's budget and, the plaintiffs' tender was not the lowest.\n\nNeither was Chan privy to the negotiations between the parties which led to the\n\nplaintiffs' appointment by the defendant. Contrary to the defendant's denial, Chan said it\n\nwas the defendant who telephoned him on or about 26 May 1997, and requested him to prepare\n\nthe second letter of award; the defendant volunteered the information that he (the\n\ndefendant) needed it to borrow money from a bank; Chan acceded to the request. It was for\n\nthe same reason that Chan subsequently prepared the second contract for signature by the\n\nplaintiffs and the defendant. Despite the express terms in the contract(s), Chan said the\n\ndefendant well-knew that there was never any intention to bind him to the duties of an\n\narchitect and or quantity surveyor. Chan had inserted his name as architect and quantity\n\nsurveyor in the contract(s) as a favour to the defendant.Chan was also never involved with\n\narchitectural drawings which task he delegated to Chua.52. Chan revealed that after his initial submission of plans to the PPD\n\non 2 August 1996, plans were amended and re-submitted four (4) more times, between 2\n\nAugust 1996 and 18 March 1997, due to the defendant's requests for changes, before\n\napproval was granted on 20 March 1997. Sometimes, changes were agreed between the\n\nplaintiffs and the defendant without Chan's knowledge, one example being the variation of\n\nmaterial from concrete to bricks for the drains, another being the change in width of the\n\ndrains and a third being the non-galvanising of the steel partitions around the kennels.\n\nIn addition to the PPD, Chan made submissions to other government departments, between 20\n\nMarch 1997 and 22 May 1999, for which he incurred fees of $14,430. As he had agreed with\n\nthe defendant to absorb his expenses, Chan said it meant his actual fees were $37,570\n\n($52,000-$14,430).53. Chan deposed he was not provided with a schedule of works for the\n\nplumbing done by the plaintiffs’ subcontractor as which result he did not know and\n\ncould not now determine, what type of pipes were and where they were, installed. Had the\n\ndefendant alerted him that PVC pipes were being used, Chan would have instructed the\n\nplaintiffs to use the correct pipes. In any case, construction of sewage pipes and\n\ninspection chambers are not critical structural elements. As a result of the two (2) site\n\nvisits I ordered and based on the testimony of Chan and Teo, it has now been established\n\nthat the plaintiffs installed UPVC not PVC, pipes.54. Apparently, Chan had consulted quantity surveyors PEB Consultants\n\n(PEB) when the defendant indicated on or about 12 July 1999 that he intended to terminate\n\nthe plaintiffs' services. As Chan was unable to give PEB the reasons for such intended\n\ntermination, Chan inquired of the defendant who did not respond. Similarly, the defendant\n\ndid not reply to Chan's letter asking for instructions on the letter from the plaintiffs'\n\nsolicitors dated 20 July 1999 (2AB618) concerning variations and changes to the contract,\n\nnor to Chan's letter dated 17 August 1999 (2AB659-661) where he had set out the full\n\nhistory of the project up to that date (including the reason for the second contract and\n\nthat the defendant himself administered the contract up to 12 August 1999), nor to Chan's\n\nletter dated 10 August 1999 (2AB638) seeking clarification on phases 1 and 2 of the\n\nproject. Chan surmised that the defendant probably obtained the idea to administer the\n\ncontract himself from Topbreed for whose project Chan did not administer the contract;\n\nTopbreed merely engaged a contractor to do the work, without even calling for a tender.55. Cross-examined on the defective footings, Chan echoed\n\nPortwood’s testimony that the steel structures were perfectly safe as they showed no\n\nsigns of buckling, even on 9 July 2001. Chan was also of the opinion that it was\n\nunnecessary to demolish the office block because the footings were under-strength. At an\n\nestimated cost of $10,000 and two (2) weeks’ work, Chan proposed a method of\n\nrectification which included adding concrete of the desired strength to the footings; the\n\nslabs did not require rectification as they did not sit on the footings but were\n\nself-supporting.56. Questioned by counsel for the defendant, Chan explained that the\n\nfootings were constructed in February 1998; he did supervise the concreting of the office\n\nblock prior to which he ordered a cube test to be done. However, he was not shown the\n\nresults although he had asked Teo, who said he would furnish the same but never did. As\n\nthe cube tests previously submitted to him for other blocks were good, Chan had assumed\n\nalbeit wrongly, that the office block footings would also be acceptable. Chan pointed out\n\nthat even if the cube tests had been satisfactory, it did not mean the core tests would be\n\ngood as it still depended on how the actual concrete was poured into the footings and such\n\nfactors as curing and vibration as well as the way the cube was being made. It emerged\n\nfrom Chan's testimony (N/E 240) that, a possible cause for the footings in the office\n\nblock being under-strength was due to the plaintiffs' use of site-mix concrete instead of\n\nthe ready-mix concrete used for the other four (4) blocks. Chan was told by Teo that the\n\nchange was necessitated by cost-cutting as the plaintiffs had not been properly paid, at\n\nthe time when Teo asked for permission to use site-mix concrete.57. As for the driveway, Chan testified it was not completed. The\n\nplaintiffs had only put in the base/sub-base comprising of used crusher-run; they had yet\n\nto top-up the base with hard core and then asphalt or concrete to finish the job. I should\n\npoint out that according to Chan (and Looi in cross-examination), the driveway appeared to\n\nhave been well used by the defendant after the plaintiffs’ services were terminated,\n\nnotwithstanding that it was not paved; there had been containers parked on or along it. I\n\nwas informed that the driveway is a private road, not a public road which needs to be\n\nhanded to the Public Works Department in due course. Consequently, there are no stringent\n\nspecifications on how it should be built.58. On the other complaints raised by Looi and or the defendant, Chan\n\nacknowledged that the finish in kennel 3 was not 100% as he had said in his written\n\ntestimony but, no tiles were laid in kennel 4; hence there could be no missing tiles\n\nthere. This resulted from negotiations between the plaintiffs and the defendant.59. Chan testified that the 8 monthly progress payments of $1,450 each\n\nin item (k) in the letter of appointment were for supervision by himself (as the part-time\n\nclerk-of- works) and by Chua; he had estimated that the project would take 8 months to\n\ncomplete. In that regard Chan said he had visited the site in October, November, December\n\n1997, February 1998 and on 4 September 1999, when his services were terminated. When he\n\nvisited on 9 July 2001, Chan found the site overgrown with grass and lacking maintenance;\n\nthe place was at a standstill (N/E 238), unlike his visit on 4 September 1999 when the\n\nsite was in very good condition.60. I turn next to the testimony of the second and last witness for the\n\nThird Party namely Chua (TPW2). Chua testified he took charge of the project on 2 July\n\n1996 after the letter of appointment was signed. He worked closely with the defendant in\n\nsubmission of drawings; the latter provided him with a lot of information and documents to\n\nshow how other countries designed dog farms, including brochures. After the drawings were\n\ncompleted, Chua sent them to the defendant for signature prior to submission to the\n\nauthorities. Chua revealed that simultaneous with this project, he was working on another\n\nproject for the defendant – a warehouse at Bukit Batok Industrial Park; hence they\n\nmet very often. Chua denied he was instructed by the defendant that any additional works\n\nrequired a quotation and the defendant's prior approval before commencement of work. He\n\nalso denied the defendant's claim that he had directed the defendant to pay the plaintiffs\n\ndirect on progress claims. On the contrary, it was the defendant who would inform him that\n\nthe latter had valued the works on site after they were completed; the defendant never\n\ntold him about progress claims 1 to 4.61. Chua recalled that in February 1999, he was told by Teo and the\n\ndefendant that the Diseased Animals Isolation Ward had been constructed not in accordance\n\nwith the approved plans. It necessitated Chua going to the site to take measurements and\n\nsubmitting amended plans. At the same time, following discussions between Teo and the\n\ndefendant, he prepared a sketch of the fencing facing Pasir Ris Drive 12, which he also\n\nsubmitted to the authorities and which was approved.62. Chua testified that when The Third Party received PPD's letter\n\ndated 15 October 1997 (2AB507) inquiring as to the development on the farm, he had\n\ntelephoned the defendant who replied he was in Germany and would return to Singapore on 29\n\nOctober 1997, after which he would contact Chua but he did not. When Chua received the\n\nfirst reminder from PPD dated 4 December 197 (2AB518) followed by the second dated 26\n\nFebruary 1989 (2AB532), he pressed the defendant. The defendant then faxed to Chua the\n\nwork schedule he had earlier agreed with Teo (see 2AB533) but which Chan said he did not\n\nrecall seeing, until the arbitration proceedings between the plaintiffs and the defendant.\n\nChua then forwarded it to the PPD on 20 March 1998.63. Chua revealed that the change of sliding doors to louvre windows\n\nwas required by PPD and this was known to the defendant. Indeed, it was at the defendant's\n\nrequest that Chua had visited the PPD on 20 September 1996, when their Dr Lou explained\n\nthe reason for the requirement. Chua followed up by submitting amended proposal plans to\n\nthe department on 9 October 1996, which letter he copied to the defendant who did not\n\nobject to the change, contrary to his testimony. When counsel for the defendant\n\ncross-examined Chua, he suggested (N/E 248) that the defendant wanted sliding instead of\n\nlouvre, windows because if the dogs were to jump out, they would not hurt themselves. This\n\nwas to be contrasted with the defendant’s earlier testimony (N/E 76) that he wanted\n\nsliding windows so that when dogs were trained on rainy days, people outside could see the\n\ndogs by sliding open the windows. As I told his counsel, the defendant’s shift in\n\nposition spoke a lot of his credibility. Chua’s response was, that the defendant\n\nnever explained his requirement for sliding windows.64. Chua revealed that although it was not the job of the Third Party\n\nto administer the contract and he so advised the defendant, the latter kept calling him to\n\nchase the plaintiffs to finish the project. When Chua spoke to Teo, he was told that the\n\ndefendant had not paid the plaintiffs. However, when he reverted to the defendant, Chua\n\nwas told that the plaintiffs had been overpaid and many things on the site were not what\n\nthe defendant wanted. Chua then advised the defendant that as the parties had agreed on\n\nliquidated damages, if the defendant accepted the items outside the contract, then the\n\ndefendant would not have to pay the plaintiffs. He suggested that the parties met to\n\nresolve the dispute but, he did not hear from either party thereafter.",
        "The findings": "65.    It is quite clear to me on the evidence whose version of\n\nevents is the more probable. I accept the testimony of Teo, Chan and Chua as being more\n\ncredible and consistent with the documents and correspondence before the court; I cannot\n\nsay the same of the defendant. He was untruthful and less than forthright, even when\n\nconfronted with unassailable evidence, on which I referred to certain instances earlier.66. I have no doubt that the following represent the true facts of this\n\ndispute:-(i) the defendant requested Chan to prepare two letters of award and\n\n  two contracts in favour of the plaintiffs, with the second contract being used to obtain a\n\n  higher loan from the bank which was financing the project for the defendant;(ii) the defendant could not have believed that Chan was an architect\n\n  as he claimed; there was no reason for either Chan or Chua to have misrepresented to him\n\n  Chan's qualifications; the defendant needed a professional engineer as a 'qualified\n\n  person' not an architect since the project involved minimal architectural details, to save\n\n  costs;(iii) the defendant chose to administer the contract (up to 12 July\n\n  1999) himself again to save costs; I believe he relied on his contractor brother Low to\n\n  help him verify the plaintiffs’ progress claims;(iv) whatever variation works carried out by the plaintiffs were done\n\n  on the defendant's oral instructions to Teo, usually without informing Chan or Chua;\n\n  neither the plaintiffs nor the defendant adhered to the express terms of the contract;(v) the defendant was not the nave layman he attempted to portray\n\n  himself as; indeed, the more he repeated the refrain ‘I don’t know\n\n  anything’the less convincing he sounded;(vi) Chan was not aware of the work schedule agreed between the\n\n  plaintiffs and the defendant, that the project would be constructed in three (3) phases.\n\n  It was Chua who forwarded the agreed work schedule to the PPD (para 62supra), not\n\n  Chan. Otherwise, there would be no reason for Chan to have sought clarification from the\n\n  defendant on phases 1 and 2, in his letter dated 10 August 1999 (para 54supra);(vii) it was the defendant who wanted the project to be completed in\n\n  three (3) phases in order to ease his financial burden; he moved forward the office block\n\n  from phase 3 to phase 1 to show to his prospective Australian investor but delayed the\n\n  works for the other 2 phases. The fact that PPD did not approve of the 3 phases for the\n\n  work schedule did not mean that the parties did not agree to it beforehand;(viii) the minutes of the first meeting (9 July 1999) were inaccurate\n\n  – the defendant/his brother looked for an excuse to terminate the plaintiffs'\n\n  contract; hence their trumped-up accusation that the plaintiffs had delayed the project\n\n  and had to provide a 'catch-up' programme. That was why the defendant did not/could not\n\n  furnish reasons for termination of the plaintiffs' contract to Chan, as per the latter's\n\n  request in his letter dated 10 August 1999 (2AB640);(ix) there being no valid reasons for termination of the plaintiffs'\n\n  contract, the defendant is liable for such wrongful termination. Therefore there is no\n\n  need for me to consider whether Anthony Lim not being a registered 'qualified person'\n\n  within the provisions of the Building Control Act for this project, could have issued a\n\n  notice of termination to the plaintiffs on 15 September 1999;(x) the present sorry state of the site/the project is due to the\n\n  defendant's neglect and lack of maintenance, not due to the plaintiffs' defective works,\n\n  since more than two (2) years have lapsed from the time the plaintiffs' services were\n\n  terminated;(xi) the defendant's plea in his defence that the works completed by\n\n  the plaintiffs are worthless or only worth $400,000 (that being the sum he actually paid\n\n  to the plaintiffs) is untrue and without merit; it is an attempt to take undue and unfair\n\n  advantage of the plaintiffs and to get a bargain basement price for his pet farm. Indeed,\n\n  his entire defence is without merit, so is his counterclaim.67. I turn my attention next to the testimony of the defendant's expert\n\nLooi. At one stage (N/E 186) I had told Looi that he should not shut his mind to the\n\npossibility of rectification of the plaintiffs' defective works. That remark was prompted\n\nby Looi’s uncompromising refusal to consider any suggestions at all to rectify the\n\nunder-strength footings in lieu of demolition, from either Portwood or Chan. As his own\n\nreport was found to have shortcoming, as well as Setsco’s reports upon which his\n\nfindings were based, Looi did himself an injustice by not appearing to be unbiased.\n\nLooi’s finding that the welds were greatly reduced in thickness was proven wrong by\n\nPortwood. His quick dismissal of the need for a load test is another example; a third\n\nexample was his complaint that the surface water channels were defective only because\n\nbrickwork was used instead of reinforced concrete. In terms of function, Looi had agreed\n\nwith Chan’s counsel that there was no difference between the two. It was due to no\n\nfault of the plaintiffs that the inspection chambers and the driveway were not completed.\n\nI am therefore of the view that Looi lacked independent judgment; I am not prepared to\n\naccept his evidence. I much prefer the testimony of Portwood and Chan. Both (and Teo) did\n\nnot deny that the footings were defective and needed rectification. Their recommendations\n\nare worth considering, once the estimated costs have been verified by quotations, subject\n\nto load tests being carried out. Teo readily made concessions where the plaintiffs’\n\nwork fell short of required specifications or standards, an example being his willingness\n\nto omit 6-7m length for his company’s claim for the sewage pipes.68. Consequently, there will be judgment for the plaintiffs in the\n\namount of $453,885.45 made up as follows:(i)balance outstanding on progress claims nos. 1 to 4$411,224.91(ii)progress claim no. 5$ 42,660.54together with interest at 6% per annum from the date of this writ, and costs.69. In the light of the plaintiffs' admission of defects to the\n\nfootings works, there shall be a stay of execution on $80,000/- of the judgment sum, until\n\nsuch time as the quantum for the cost of strengthening/reinforcing/replacing the footings\n\nhas been ascertained, together with the appropriate reduction for the 6-7m of pipes for\n\nthe sewage works which claim the plaintiffs have agreed to waive. Further, deductions\n\nshould be made for the works necessary to complete the inspection chambers, the driveway,\n\nremoval of rust from kennels 3 and 4, omission of the 10-persons sewage treatment plant\n\nnot built by the plaintiffs and any other works not built or completed by the plaintiffs,\n\nin accordance with the contract. This would include a reduction for the shortfall (from\n\n6mm) in thickness of the welds. Although I disallow the plaintiffs' claim for loss of\n\nprofits of $356,096.75 (not proven), they are not precluded from adducing evidence at the\n\nassessment hearing, of the loss/damages they had suffered in disposing of the trusses they\n\nhad fabricated (in readiness for construction), after their services were terminated.70. The omissions, deductions and damages referred to earlier shall be\n\nassessed by the Registrar, with the costs of such assessment to be reserved to the\n\nRegistrar. The parties are at liberty to call their quantity surveyors to testify at the\n\nassessment or, in the case of Chan, his professional engineer Lim Ang Beng Hock (Eric).\n\nEvidence adduced at this trial shall form part of the evidence for the assessment but,\n\nparties arenot allowedto adduce further testimony on liability, to\n\ncontradict/rebut the evidence already presented before this court.71. Needless to say, the defendant's counterclaim against the\n\nplaintiffs is dismissed with costs, together with his Third Party claim against Chan.\n\nNeither claim has any merit in the light of my earlier findings. There shall be judgment\n\nfor the Third Party's counterclaim against the defendant in the sum of $22,575/- for the\n\noutstanding balance of Chan's agreed fees of $52,000/-, together with interest (at 6% per\n\nannum) from the date of the writ in Suit No. 564 of 2000 and costs.Sgd:LAI SIU SHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
