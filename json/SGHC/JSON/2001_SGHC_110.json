        "Q12) Why did you say that you had taken advantage of Annie by having sex with\n\n  her?": "A12) It was impulse and without her consents.Q13) Why do you say that you had sex with Annie without her consent?A13) Because I acted on impulse.Q14) Did Annie at anytime agree to have sex with you that night?A14) No.Q15) Did you at anytime ask Annie whether you can have sex with her that night?A15) No.Q16) Since you did not ask Annie whether you could have sex with her and she\n\n  did not at anytime agree to have sex with you that night, why did you still engage in sexual\n\n  intercourse with Annie?A16) I had the urge to have sex.Q17) Did Annie respond to you physically or verbally when you had sex with her\n\n  that night?A17) She was groaning.Q18) In your further statement recorded on 31.12.99 in A5, you stated that when\n\n  you laid down on the bed beside Annie and before you started kissing her, you had asked her\n\n  whether you can have sex with her. However, just now at A15, you had stated that you did not at\n\n  anytime asked Annie whether you can have sex with her that night. Can you explain which is the\n\n  correct version?A18)The correct version is that I did not ask her for permission to have\n\n  sex with her.Q19) Since you did not ask Annie for permission to have sex with her, why did\n\n  you state in your further statement recorded on 31.12.99 that you had asked Annie for her\n\n  permission to have sex with her?A19) After going through the Lie-detector test, the examiner spoke to me and\n\n  asked me to tell the truth. So I told him the truth that I had the urge to have sex with Annie and\n\n  I did not ask her for permission.",
        "Q24)That night in your house, do you think that Annie had allowed you to\n\n  have sex with her that night?": "A24)Not sure.Q25) Since you are not sure, that night, whether Annie allowed you to have sex\n\n  with her, what made you go ahead to have sex with her?A25) I just had the urge to have sex with her.Q26) In A12 just now, you had stated that you had taken advantage of Annie by\n\n  having sex with Annie on impulse and without her consents. Why did you say that Annie did not\n\n  consent to the sex?A26) Because after going through the lie detector test, I decided to tell you\n\n  the truth.Q27) So what is the truth now?A27)I had sex without Annies consent.Q28) Why didnt you tell me when I first recorded your statement on 31.12.99?A28) I just wanted to go home that time.Q29) Since Annie did not consent to have sex with you, what made you think that\n\n  Annie would allow you to have sex with her?A29) I dont know.Q30)Did Annie do anything to indicate that she allowed you to have sex with\n\n  her?A30)No.(Emphasis added)17. In his statement tendered in his defence he described the events thus37. Annie was still sleeping on the bed. As I entered the room, Annie got up\n\n  from the bed and stood up and said that she wanted to vomit. So I followed her out of the room and\n\n  she walked by herself to the kitchen toilet.38. She vomited in the toilet. Just at this moment my sister (Lina Chang Ying\n\n  Siew) woke up and came out of her room, which was next to my room.39. She asked me why I was opening and closing the door so loudly. At that time\n\n  Annie was in the toilet. I told my sister to go back to sleep. My sister went back to her room.40. After Annie finished vomiting, I followed her back to my bedroom. I placed\n\n  her on the bed. At this moment Annies pager sounded. I took her pager, which was on my study\n\n  table and gave it to her.41. After looking at her pager, she asked for a phone and I gave her my\n\n  handphone. She called someone and she spoke to someone by the name Kelvin. Then she hung and gave\n\n  me back the phone and went back to sleep on my bed.45. I then lay down on the bed beside Annie, intending to sleep.46. I remember I fell asleep for a short while.47. When I woke up, I had the urge to have sex with Annie.48. I started to kiss Annie on the lips. She responded and kissed me back. She\n\n  put her tongue in my mouth, and I put my tongue in her mouth.49. I then started to lift the spaghetti strap blouse that she was wearing and\n\n  removed the blouse.50. I then pulled down her skirt.51. I then unhooked her bra (it was a back-fastening bra) and I removed her\n\n  panties.52. All the while when I was removing her blouse, skirt, bra and panties, she\n\n  also assisted me by lifting up her arms and buttocks.53. When Annie was naked, I then started to remove my T-shirt, shorts and\n\n  underwear.54. Then, I lay on top of Annie and I spread open Annies legs and I inserted\n\n  my penis into her vagina.55. I had no difficulty penetrating her. She was lubricated in her vagina.56. Then I thrust my penis in and out of her vagina.57. When I was thrusting my penis in and out of her vagina, both her hands were\n\n  holding onto my arms. Apart from this, she just lay on the bed without any movement of her body or\n\n  limbs, but she was groaning.58. We stopped having sex because I could not maintain my erection. I did not\n\n  ejaculate in her or outside her.18. He referred to his statement of 31 December and retracted that part where he\n\nhad said that the complainant pushed him off while he was having sex with her. His explanation was\n\nthat he made the statement so that he would complete the statement and go home earlier lest ASP Ting\n\nwould question him in a threatening manner. This has to be considered against his acceptance that\n\nthis statement was a voluntary statement and against the fact that it was never put to ASP Ting that\n\nshe was impatient or threatening towards him during the recording of his statements.Evaluation of the evidence19. There was no dispute that sexual intercourse took place. The accused conceded\n\nthat he did not obtain the complainants oral consent for that. The defence that can be deduced\n\nfrom his last statement (which I shall refer to as his s 371 statement) was that she had consented\n\nby conduct by responding to his kiss and raising her arms and buttocks when he undressed her.20. There were difficulties with the defence. There was the contrary account in\n\nthe statement of 31 May 2000 which was recorded on his initiative.21. The May statement was made five months after the rape investigations against\n\nhim commenced. He was aware that the investigations were ongoing as he was required to go for a lie\n\ndetector test. He went back to ASP Ting after the test and told her that he wanted to make a further\n\nstatement. Then he told her that he had sex with the complainant on an impulse without seeking or\n\nobtaining her consent, and further that she had not done anything to indicate that she allowed him\n\nto have sex with her. In the statement he confirmed that it was voluntarily, and he was not\n\nthreatened or assaulted, that no promise had been made to him, that he chose to speak in a mixture\n\nof English and Mandarin during the recording, and that he understood the investigation officer fully\n\nduring the recording.22. When his counsel brought him through the statement, he elaborated that he had\n\ntaken advantage of the complainant because she was upset and she was vulnerable.23. After revising the account given in December 1999 with the May statement, the\n\naccused gave a third version of the events in s 371 statement.24. When counsel went into the issue of consent with him, he explained that when\n\nhe referred to consent in the May statement, he meant verbal consent as he was under the impression\n\nthat rape was sex without verbal consent.25. I did not accept the explanation. The accused was 23 years old. He had\n\nobtained his N level certificate as well as a Certificate on Office Skills from the Institute of\n\nTechnical Education and was serving as a Second Sergeant in the Singapore Armed Forces. Having\n\nobserved him, and taking into account his background, I found that it was not credible that he\n\nthought that consensual sex is sex with oral consent, and that without it, it is rape however\n\nwilling the partner may be. In any event, he went beyond verbal consent in the statement, and\n\nconfirmed that there was also no consent by conduct.26. It must be remembered that the statement of 31 May was made entirely on the\n\naccuseds initiative. Neither the officer who conducted the lie detector test nor ASP Ting\n\nrequested him to make the statement. He told the former that he wanted to see the latter, and he\n\nwent to see ASP Ting because in his own words, he decided to tell the truth and make changes to his\n\nearlier statements.27. When I considered the complainants evidence, it was clear that she had had\n\ntoo much to drink. She was unhappy and was crying, and did not want to be sent home because she did\n\nnot want her parents to know she was drunk. She was vomiting intermittently and feeling nauseated,\n\nand even after arriving at the accuseds apartment she had to get up from the bed to go to the\n\ntoilet to vomit again returning to the bed to sleep. When her sleep was interrupted by her pager,\n\nshe went back to sleep after accessing her voice mail.28. The complainant could not be in an amorous state in that condition. Her\n\nevidence that she had not consented to have sex with the accused was confirmed by the accused\n\nhimself. Her calls to her friends recounting the events corroborated her evidence.29. I invited defence counsel to suggest a reason for the complainant to cry rape\n\nif she had consented (the accused did not offer any explanation himself). Counsels response was\n\nthat the burden was not on the defence to deal with that. While he was correct that there was no\n\nduty on the defence, it would have helped the defence if a persuasive reason was offered. To his\n\ncredit, counsel tried to assist, submitting that it is very hard to attribute motives and that\n\n\"(w)e can only go by a persons conduct and by a simple account of what happened. Thats\n\nall we have. When it comes to motives we are really, really hard put.\"30. In the closing submissions counsel complained of shortcomings in the\n\nrecording of the accuseds statements. The accused made his statements in a mixture of English and\n\nMandarin and ASP Ting could not recall the Mandarin expressions used which were recorded as\n\n\"consent\", \"agree\", \"allow\" and \"permission\".31. Nothing really turned on this. ASP Tings knowledge of Mandarin was not\n\nquestioned as she majored in Chinese Studies at the university. The statements themselves were\n\nrecorded in simple language, and the accused had not alleged that anything he said was omitted, or\n\nthat what was recorded did not emanate from him or was wrongly recorded. What was recorded was\n\nsimple and clear  that she did not give verbal consent or do anything which indicated consent.32. Counsel also referred to the complainants ability to access her voice mail\n\nand the calls that she was alleged to have made from the mobile phone reflected her actual condition\n\nthat morning.33. The complainants use of her pager and the mobile phone fit in the overall\n\npicture of her state in the apartment. It was not the prosecutions case that she was totally\n\nphysically or mentally disabled. The evidence was that she could go to the toilet to vomit, she was\n\naware of the accuseds advances, she resisted him to a point by turning her head to avoid his\n\nkisses and by pushing him. Her ability to use the pager and the mobile phone was not exceptional in\n\nthe circumstances.34. After reviewing the evidence, I found that the prosecution had proved its\n\ncase against the accused on both charges and that he had not raised any doubt that he had sex with\n\nthe complainant without her consent in any form.Sentence35. In the commission of the offences, there was no violence, threat of violence,\n\nabduction or wrongful confinement. There was also no preconceived plot by the accused. He could not\n\nhave known that the complainant would be drunk, or that she would not want to be sent back to her\n\nown home. The offences were committed because of his impulse to have sex with the complainant when\n\nthe opportunity presented itself. The accused has no antecedents and there is no real likelihood\n\nthat he would repeat the offence. On the other side of the scale, he denied the charges and went\n\nthrough a trial of seven days. Keeping in mind the principles set down inChia Kim Heng Frederick\n\nv PP[1992] 1 SLR 361, I sentenced the accused to eight years imprisonment and six strokes of\n\nthe cane on the first charge and eight years imprisonment on the second charge, with the custodial\n\nsentences to run concurrently in view of the proximity in time and other circumstances of the two\n\noffences.",
