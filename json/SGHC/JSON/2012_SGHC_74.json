        "The background": "4       The applicant avers that she is a resident voter\n                    of Hougang SMC. 5       She avers that she had previously sought\n                    financial advice and assistance from her then Member of Parliament of Hougang\n                    SMC (“MP”), Mr Yaw Shin Leong (“Mr Yaw”)\n                    of the Workers’ Party, for whom she had voted in the last general\n                    election. He had invited her to follow up with him. 6       She avers that on 15 February 2012, the\n                    Workers’ Party declared that Mr Yaw had been expelled from the party.\n                    His parliamentary seat was thereafter declared vacant. 7       The applicant avers that she is deprived of an\n                    MP and that although she is being assisted by Workers’ Party MPs from the\n                    adjacent Aljunied Group Representative Constituency (“GRC”), she\n                    avers that they do not represent her vote. 8       She avers that she has a right to be represented\n                    by an MP whom she had an opportunity of choosing. She has made this application\n                    to clarify the law and to seek the Declarations and Mandatory\n                Orders.",
        "The threshold for O 53 leave applications": "9       Applications for O 53 prerogative orders\n                    require the leave of court. One of the purposes of the requirement of leave is\n                    to sieve out groundless applicationsin limine.\n                    The Court of Appeal inPublic Service Commission v Lai Swee\n                        Lin Linda[2001] 1 SLR(R) 133 explained that the\n                    requirement of seeking the leave of court (at [23]) was: … intended to be a means of filtering out groundless or hopeless\n                        cases at an early stage, and its aim is to prevent a wasteful use of\n                        judicial time and to protect public bodies from harassment (whether\n                        intentional or otherwise) that might arise from a need to delay implementing\n                        decisions, where the legality of such decisions is being challenged.\n                        … 10     Leave is not granted unless the court is\n                    satisfied that: (i) the matter complained of is susceptible to judicial\n                    review; (ii) the applicant has sufficient interest in the matter; and\n                    (iii) the material before the court discloses an arguable orprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion in favour of\n                    granting leave. Additionally, as these orders are discretionary remedies, the\n                    court has a discretion to refuse leave where the circumstances warrant a refusal\n                    (seeSingaporeCivilProcedure 2007(G P Selvam chief ed) (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2007) at\n                    para 53/8/22). 11     It was not disputed for purposes of the leave\n                    application that the matter relates to the performance of powers and duties\n                    which involve a public element and thus is susceptible to judicial review. It\n                    was also not disputed that the applicant has sufficient interest in the\n                    matter. 12     The main issue in dispute in this leave\n                    application was whether the material before the court disclosed an arguable orprima faciecase in favour of granting leave.\n                    I noted what the Court of Appeal inChan Hiang Leng Colin and\n                        others v Minister for Information and the Arts[1996]\n                    1 SLR(R) 294 had to say on the meaning and scope of the phrases\n                    ‘aprima faciecase of reasonable\n                    suspicion’ and ‘what might on further consideration turn out to be\n                    an arguable case’ (at [22]): This passage appears susceptible to two slightly\n                            different interpretations. One isthat the court should\n                        quickly peruse the material put before it and consider\n                            whether such material discloses “what might on further\n                        consideration turn out to be an arguable case”. The other is that the\n                        applicant had to make out a “prima\n                            faciecase of reasonable suspicion”. In our view, both\n                        tests present a very low threshold and it is questionable whether there is\n                        really any difference in substance between the two interpretations. The Court of Appeal (at [25]) then ruled that: ... What is required is not aprima faciecase, but aprima faciecase of reasonable\n                        suspicion. If the latter can be shown, then it cannot be said that the\n                        application must necessarily fail, for there would then appear to be an\n                        “arguable case”. 13     Counsel addressed me primarily on the issue of\n                    whether the material before me raised an arguable or aprima\n                        faciecase of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting\n                    leave.",
        "The relationship between O 53 and O 15 r 16": "14     Pursuant to amendments to O 53 made in\n                    May 2011, a public law declaration may now be sought under O 53\n                    r 1(1)(a). Previously, public law declarations had to be separately\n                    commenced under O 15 r 16. 15     In these proceedings, the AG’s counsel\n                    took the position that while leave is not required for a declaration under\n                    O 15 r 16, O 53 does not permit the applicant to pray for a\n                    declaration until and unless she has first obtained the Court’s leave to\n                    apply for a prerogative order,i.e., the Mandatory Order. 16     Counsel for the applicant did not dispute the\n                    AG’s counsel’s position, but gave notice that if the court did not\n                    grant leave for the Mandatory Order application to be heard, he would\n                    immediately be filing an application under O 15 r 16 for the\n                    declarations sought here, for which no leave of court is required. In support he\n                    relied on V K Rajah J’s observation (as he then was) inChee Siok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 at [20]: ... The court rules are designed essentially to facilitate workflow and\n                        not to impede legitimate legal grievances. They are the vassals and vessels\n                        and not the masters of substantive justice. ... 17     At the threshold, it would appear that\n                    declarations sought under O 53 are subject to the language of O 53 and\n                    require leave of court whilst declarations sought under O 15 r 16 do\n                    not require leave of court but are subject to the normal requirements includinglocus standiand a live dispute. 18     I have directed parties to prepare further\n                    submissions on the above issue at the substantive hearing.",
        "The Mandatory Order": "19     Counsel for the applicant argued that the\n                    court may issue a mandatory order to compel the Prime Minister to exercise his\n                    powers in accordance with the law. When a seat in Parliament has become vacant,\n                    Article 49(1) of the Constitution states that: … the vacancy shall be filled by election in the manner provided by\n                        or under any law relating to Parliamentary elections for the time being in\n                        force. 20     Counsel for the applicant argued, that the\n                    word “shall” suggests that it is mandatory for by-elections to be\n                    called. If so, he argued that the Prime Minister does not have a discretion as\n                    to whether to hold a by-election in Hougang SMC. Counsel for the applicant\n                    argued further that the Prime Minister does not have an unfettered discretion as\n                    to the timing of the by-election. He submitted that even though there is no\n                    constitutional or statutory requirement to call by-elections within a specified\n                    time period, s 52 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed)\n                    suggests that elections should be called within a reasonable time. 21     The AG’s counsel argued that the\n                    application for the Mandatory Order is misconceived in law and in fact for the\n                    following reasons: (a)     There is no executive decision that\n                        could properly be the subject of the prerogative order as the Prime Minister\n                        is presently exercising his discretion to decide when to call the\n                        by-election in Hougang SMC; (b)     It directs the Prime Minister on the particular way he is\n                        to exercise his discretion thus disregarding the discretion conferred on him\n                        by the Constitution to decide when to call the by election;\n                    and (c)     It usurps the\n                        power of the Prime Minister under the Constitution to decide, in his\n                        discretion when to call the by election in Hougang SMC and transgresses the\n                        doctrine of separation of powers. 22     The AG’s counsel pointed out that on\n                    9 March 2012 the Prime Minister had stated in Parliament that he intended\n                    to call a by-election and that he is considering the relevant factors in\n                    deciding when to call the by-election (“the Prime Minister’s\n                    9 March Statement”). 23     In reply, counsel for the applicant pointed\n                    out that the Prime Minister’s 9 March Statement only spoke of his\n                    intention to hold a by-election. Counsel for the applicant observed that that\n                    was very different from saying that he was compelled to hold one. In this\n                    regard, and citing the case ofPadfield v Minister of\n                        Agriculture, Fisheries and Food[1968] AC 967 at 1041,\n                    counsel for the applicant submitted that the Prime Minister, by stating that he\n                    had the power to decide “whether and when” to call an election,\n                    had “misinterpreted the law or proceeded on an erroneous view of the\n                    law”. He conceded that the Prime Minister has a discretion as to the\n                    timing of a by-election and that the applicant is not seeking a specific date\n                    for the announcement of a by-election.",
        "The Declarations": "24     Counsel for the applicant submitted that\n                    public law declarations have “significant legal utility” in that\n                    they can conclusively settle the legal boundaries within which administrative\n                    determinations would have to proceed. 25     The AG’s counsel submitted that the\n                    First and Second Declarations are entirely academic and theoretical in light of\n                    the Prime Minister’s 9 March Statement. He argued that courts do not\n                    burden themselves by granting declarations which raise theoretical issues or\n                    which serve no useful purpose. In addition, if the court were to grant the\n                    Second Declaration, it would be substituting its discretion for that of the\n                    Prime Minister’s. 26     Counsel for the applicant earlier informed the\n                    AG’s counsel and the court that he would if necessary immediately apply\n                    under O 15 r 16 for the First and Second Declarations to be considered\n                    as standalone declarations for which the leave of court is not required. In\n                    light of this, the question of whether the quite separate requirements for\n                    standalone declarations have been met would have to be determined at a\n                    substantive hearing, which this O 53 leave hearing is not. 27     I asked counsel whether this court at this\n                    leave stage, is to examine each and every prayer of the OS and consider any\n                    severance process. Counsel did not make any submissions on this question. In any\n                    event, the applicant would have to establish her case for the First Declaration\n                    (whether under O 53 or O 15 r 16), quite apart from and before\n                    any consequential Second Declaration and the Mandatory Order are\n                    considered.",
        "Conclusion": "28     The applicant has filed this OS for leave to\n                    be heard in court for declarations and a mandatory order relating to the Prime\n                    Minister’s powers with respect to elections and the filling of vacancies\n                    of seats of MPs under Arts. 12, 39(1) and 49(1) of the Constitution of the\n                    Republic of Singapore. 29     Based on what was presented and submitted to\n                    me for the purposes of the leave application, without making any comment or\n                    decision on the merits or the substantive legal issues, I granted leave for a\n                    judicial review hearing as I was of the view that the very low threshold for\n                    leave has been met."
