        "Injury to the left tibia, fibula and\n\nmalleolus": "6 Dr Sarbjit Singh, a consultant\n\northopaedic surgeon attached to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital attended to the Plaintiff from\n\nthe start and had continued to be in charge of her case. He stated in his report of 27\n\nNovember 1997 thatShe sustained an open compound fracture of\n\n  the left tibia and fibula and a closed fracture medial malleolus of the left ankle.Wound debridement, external fixator\n\n  application of the left tibia and fibula and internal fixation of the left ankle fracture\n\n  was done on the same day.She was discharged from hospital on\n\n  14.5.97.Patient developed delayed union of the\n\n  fractured left tibia requiring posterolateral bone grafting on 1.8.97.When last seen on 7.11.97, the wounds had\n\n  healed well. The fracture site was mobile with a varus deformity. She is still on\n\n  follow-up.and in a later report dated 9 November\n\n1998, he added thatPatient developed delayed union of the\n\n  fractured left tibia requiring posterolateral bone grafting on 1 August 97. Serial x-rays\n\n  confirmed to show poor fracture union.Acute shortening and Ilizarov distraction\n\n  osteotomy of the left tibia was done on 10 March 98.Serial x-rays showed good progression of\n\n  the distraction site. Limited bone grafting was done on 10 June 98.The fracture united on follow-up and the\n\n  frame was removed on 9 September 98.She is presently walking partial weight\n\n  bearing. Patient has residual stiffness of the left ankle.7 In his last report dated 6 August 1999\n\nhe notedThe non-union of the left tibia healed on\n\n  follow-up. She has mild stiffness of the left ankle and lack 15 ankle dorsiflexion.Presently, she walks with a shoe raise.\n\n  Her left knee range of motion is full and painless.8 The Plaintiff was also seen by\n\northopaedic consultants in private practice. In particular, Dr Liang Te Shan submitted his\n\nreport based upon an examination on 2 February 1999 that1. She is markedly hyposthetic from the\n\n  mid shin level downwards. Her sole sensation to pressure and pain is reduced making skin\n\n  pressure sores likely.2. She has chronic limb pain. This is from\n\n  a combination of nerve injuries, altered weight bearing biomechanics from bone malunions,\n\n  ankle fusion, subtalar fibrodesis and flexion contractures causing clawing of the toes.\n\n  (bone fusion, soft tissue joint scarring, muscle loss and scarring resulting in\n\n  contractures.)She is basically unable to use her left\n\n  leg to walk without pain and cannot be employed in her prior occupation in a lounge.3. There is in addition unsightly scars\n\n  and atrophic/poor quality soft tissue in the leg and foot.Assessment:Mdm Goh has suffered very severe injuries\n\n  to her left leg. She also has other problems requiring consultation with other physicians\n\n  and psychiatrists. Her injuries have resulted in many months of painful treatment,\n\n  multiple surgeries and loss of gainful employment.Although surgery was successful in\n\n  preserving her left leg, the leg is functionally useless. In addition, she has chronic\n\n  persistant disabling pain that often results in dependancy on sedatives, psychiatric\n\n  modifying drugs and in some, narcotic analgesics.In my opinion, she is better off with her\n\n  leg amputated below the knee as her function (and cosmesis with an artificial limb) would\n\n  be far superior.As it is, she has little to show in\n\n  beneficial terms for the pain and suffering she has endured. She may well decide\n\n  eventually to have a below knee amputation to remove the painful useless limb and then may\n\n  be rehabilitated back into gainful employment.9 At the hearing before the Assistant\n\nRegistrar Dr Singh expanded on parts of his reports. He explained that an Ilizarov\n\ndistraction is a technique to get a fracture site to heal. This involves cutting the bone\n\nand placing the leg in a frame, after which the bone is lengthened by gradual adjustments\n\nof the frame over a period of 6 months.10 Dr Singh also explained that the loss\n\nof 15 ankle dorsiflexion meant that the Plaintiff’s foot could not be horizontal,\n\nbut would point downwards at 15. This is a permanent disability which requires her to\n\nwear a shoe with a shoe raise to walk, and even with that, she will walk with a very mild\n\nlimp. She is now able to walk short distances of about 30 metres and her walking is\n\nexpected to improve, but there will be some pain and discomfort in the left forefoot and\n\nthe ankle.11 He also commented to the matters raised\n\nin Dr Liang’s report. He disagreed that the Plaintiff’s left leg is functionally\n\nuseless, and considered amputation very unlikely.12 When Dr Liang gave evidence he\n\nconfirmed that he saw the Plaintiff only once before he put up his report. After the\n\nreport, he saw the Plaintiff once again on 15 July 1999. On the second occasion, she was\n\non a wheelchair. Although he said he tried to get her out of the wheelchair, she was\n\nunwilling to put weight on her leg because of her pain.13 On the Plaintiff’s own evidence,\n\nher condition has improved since Dr Liang saw her. She testified before the Assistant\n\nRegistrar that she can walk about 10 steps in her orthopaedic shoes with the help of a\n\nwalking stick before she felt pain. She mentioned that she experienced pain when she\n\nwalked, but did not complain of the chronic persistent disabling pain Dr Liang referred to\n\nin his report. She did not say that her left leg is functionally useless, and did not\n\nexpress any intention to have it amputated. Indeed it was not clear whether the question\n\nof amputation has been brought up to her for consideration.14 I preferred Dr Singh’s evidence on\n\nthe Plaintiff’s condition to Dr Liang’s. Dr Singh had a greater knowledge of the\n\nPlaintiff’s condition than Dr Liang and the Plaintiff’s own evidence was more\n\nconsistent with his assessment. Dr Liang could have been of greater assistance if he had\n\nseen in the Plaintiff more often than he did, and closer to the hearing before the\n\nAssistant Registrar.15 It appears from the evidence that the\n\nclosed fracture of the medial malleolus healed without problems, as did the open compound\n\nfracture of the left fibula. The fractured tibia was more troublesome. A delayed union\n\nrequired bone grafting and Ilizarov distraction before it healed properly. The fracture of\n\nthe medial malleolus of the left ankle has also healed with a 15 loss of dorsiflexion\n\n(upward flexing) in the left ankle. She has a slight limp and discomfort when she walks\n\nand she can only walk short distances now although that would improve in time.16 Counsel for both parties cited\n\nprecedent awards for injuries similar to those suffered by the Plaintiff. Two relatively\n\nrecent awards for fractures of the tibia and fibula with residual disabilities were of\n\nparticular assistance.17 InAlagamalai s/o Veerasamy v Chan\n\nLian Chan,November 1994 MMD 1603, a 39-year-old police officer suffered comminuted\n\nfractures of the distal shafts of the left tibia and fibula. There was malunion at the\n\nfracture site with disuse atrophy of the bones. The left leg was shortened by 2 cm, and\n\nthe lower half of the leg was deformed. There was limitation of movement in the left ankle\n\n- 5 loss of dorsiflexion as well as 15 loss of plantarflexion (downward flexing). He\n\nwalked with an obvious limp and was unable to squat fully. He was awarded $20,000 in 1994.18 InLai Sin Wah v Ng Soo NgohJanuary 1999 MCL 72 a 42-year-old carpenter had comminuted fractures of the tibia and\n\nfibula. His right leg was infected, malunited and shortened. He experienced chronic pain\n\nover the fractured right leg aggravated by heavy lifting and chronic discharge from the\n\nright shin. He had a limping gait and unsightly bowing of the right shin, and was unable\n\nto run, jog or squat. For these injuries he was awarded $25,000 in 1998.19 An older 1991 award for similar\n\nfractures with residual disabilities was also referred to. This was inParakatt Sajeev\n\ns/o Kunniyer Damodara Kurup v Camperon Bernard–Singapore Piling Civil\n\nContractors Pte Ltd[1996] MD 991.A 28-year-old carpenter sustained an open\n\nwound over the medial aspect of the left leg and open fracture of the left tibia and\n\nfibula. External fixation and split skin graft were applied to the open wound. He\n\ndeveloped an infected non-union which required treatment by debridement and Gentamycin\n\nbeads, but even with the treatment infection may flare up again in the future. The\n\nresidual disabilities were two large scars, a stiff ankle and difficulty in squatting and\n\nrapid ambulation. $36,000 was awarded for these injuries. This is higher than the 1994 and\n\n1998 awards as the residual injuries were less severe, with no shortening or deformity. I\n\naccepted the two later awards to be more reflective of the current levels of awards for\n\nsuch injuries.20 For the injuries to the malleolus and\n\nthe ankle two awards made in 1992 were cited. $12,000 was awarded to a 21-year-old\n\nconstruction worker for a closed fracture of the medial malleolus with stiffness of the\n\nankle inLee Wee Yee & Anor v Koh Geok Chee & OrsDecember 1992 MMD 1574.\n\nInMohamad Aliman bin Kassim v Zulkifli bin Abdul Latib & Anor1998 MD 1750,\n\n$20,000 was awarded to a 52-year-old driver/storekeeper for an open fracture of the right\n\nmedial malleolus with puncture wound over the fracture site, resulting in permanent slight\n\nrestriction in dorsiflexion of the ankle as well as osteoarthritis in the ankle which may\n\nlead to pain that require treatment.21 I used these awards as guides and\n\nbenchmarks. I took into account the differences in the forms and severity of injuries eg\n\nthe Plaintiff’s limited ability to walk and the fact that her fractures have healed\n\nwithout shortening, the overlap between the three fractures to her lower limb, and the age\n\nof the Plaintiff. After considering these matters, I concluded that an award of $40,000\n\nfor the lower limb injuries was appropriate, and reduced the Assistant Registrar’s\n\nawards for these injuries by $10,000.",
        "Post-traumatic stress disorder": "22 Three psychiatrists gave evidence on\n\nthe post-traumatic stress disorder the Plaintiff developed. Dr Kwek Seow Khee of the\n\nDepartment of Psychological Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital who had attended to the\n\nPlaintiff submitted a report dated 21 July 1999 thatMdm Goh developed Posttraumatic Stress\n\n  Disorder following the fall of the lift she was in from 19thstorey. Her\n\n  symptoms were elaborated in the previous report submitted by my colleague dated 4 Feb 99.She has been regular with her follow-up as\n\n  well as with her medication. Though fairly stable on the whole up to her last visit, her\n\n  symptoms tended to get worse when she ran out of medication. Her treatment also needed\n\n  adjustment at times when she experienced new stressors, such as the repeated\n\n  hospitalization for operations.She continues to experience fear each time\n\n  she enters a lift and have startle response at the hearing of noise produced by appliances\n\n  e.g. air-conditioner. She needs to be accompanied for most part of her daily life and has\n\n  to avoid items that would remind her of her traumatic experience such as a violent scene\n\n  from a television show.She has departed from her previous\n\n  confident character and outgoing lifestyle and has tended now to be dependent on people\n\n  and medication.It is likely that she needs ongoing\n\n  treatment for the foreseeable future.23 Dr Tan Lay Ling of the Department of\n\nGeriatric Psychiatry, Woodbridge Hospital is the colleague Dr Kwek referred to. Dr Tan\n\nreported on 4 February 1999 thatMdm Goh was referred to the Psychological\n\n  Department by the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 9 July\n\n  97. Mdm Goh apparently sustained an open compound fracture of the left tibia and fibula\n\n  and a closed fracture medial malleolus of the left ankle when the lift she was in fell 19\n\n  floors. She requested for a psychiatric referral as she was complaining of insomnia\n\n  following the accident.Mdm Goh reported having insomnia since her\n\n  accident on 4 May 97. She would experience recurrent, intrusive images of the scene of the\n\n  accident that disturbed her sleep. She also worries that her air-conditioner would fall on\n\n  her while she sleeps and would startle easily at the slightest noise in the room. She\n\n  developed intense fear and avoidance of taking lifts. She was also anxious and had\n\n  difficulty concentrating on what she was doing.Mdm Goh was diagnosed to be suffering from\n\n  a posttraumatic stress disorder following the accident. She was started on medications\n\n  with regular outpatient follow-up.When she was last reviewed on 14 Jan 99,\n\n  her sleep has improved with the medications, but she was still rather anxious. She was not\n\n  noted to be depressed.24 The Plaintiff saw Dr Peh Lai Huat on 2\n\nFebruary 1999 for a second opinion. He noted in his report of 19 August 99 thatBesides her physical injuries, she\n\n  suffered from psychological symptoms after the incident in May 1997 in which she was\n\n  inside a falling lift. These include anxiety and being easily frightened by noises. When\n\n  she partially overcame her fears of using lifts, she grew alarmed when there were many\n\n  people in the lift or when the lift showed signs of not closing properly. She manifested\n\n  phobic avoidance in such situations by letting the lift go first or insisting on getting\n\n  out of it immediately.These signs and symptoms indicate that she\n\n  developed Post-traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the lift incident.She was initially depressed and had\n\n  insomnia. Her physical disabilities and restrictions of lifestyle were factors\n\n  contributing to her despondency and anxieties about her future.She received treatment for her condition\n\n  at the Department of Psychological Medicine of Tan Tock Seng Hospital but continued to be\n\n  symptomatic. When I reviewed her on 19 August 1999, her mental state was anxious and she\n\n  reported being startled by loud noises such as that from the air-conditioner at home. She\n\n  would also have tremors of her body when she came across television scenes of disasters\n\n  and would avoid them.In my opinion, Mdm Goh Eng Hong has not\n\n  fully recovered from her psychiatric disorder and needs continuation of treatment. The\n\n  physical and mental trauma she suffered and the loss of functional abilities put her risk\n\n  of depression, even in the future. The psychological part of her rehabilitation needs to\n\n  be taken into consideration, in addition to the treatment of her post-traumatic stress\n\n  disorder.25 Only one precedent for an award for\n\npost-traumatic stress disorder was cited to me, namelyPang Koi Fa v Lim Djoe Phing[1993] 3 SLR 317. The plaintiff was a lady of 51 whose daughter\n\ndied as a result of the negligence of the defendant, a neurosurgeon. No report of her\n\ncondition was set out, but it can be gathered from the judgment that the plaintiff was\n\ndistraught when her daughter died. She was on the verge of a breakdown and almost\n\ncommitted suicide. She complained of heart palpitations, breathlessness, insomnia, crying\n\nepisodes, loss of interest in her work and social life. She was preoccupied with memories\n\nof her daughter, and preserved her daughter’s room at home and her desk at her\n\noffice. There was evidence that she underwent a personality change; she stopped cooking\n\nfor the family, became over-protective of her son and quarrelled frequently with her\n\nhusband. Her psychiatrist diagnosed her to be suffering from post-traumatic stress\n\ndisorder and pathological grief, with the grief bringing on the disorder. She was awarded\n\n$30,000 general damages.26 The signs and symptons described were\n\nas severe, if not more severe than the Plaintiff’s. Furthermore counsel for the\n\nSecond Defendants drew attention to the fact that while both ladies developed stress\n\ndisorder, the plaintiff inPang Koi Faalso experienced pathological grief. He\n\nargued that the Plaintiff should not get more than the $30,000 the latter received. I\n\ncould not fault the reasoning, and reduced the award under this head from $40,000 to\n\n$30,000.Loss of income27 The Plaintiff had claimed that she was\n\nearning $6,635 a month at the time of the accident. She was appointed as a host mamasan in\n\nApril 1997, after a 2-week trial period. She had a group of 8 to 10 \"daughters\"\n\nunder her charge. She received from the lounge $110 for each bottle of Martell or Hennessy\n\nbrandy opened by customers entertained by her or her \"daughters\". She claimed\n\nthat she kept these payments to herself because all the customers were her customers, and\n\nthe \"daughters\" were only entitled to the tips they received from the customers.28 Prior to becoming a host mamasan, she\n\nwas a freelance mamasan from 1988 to 1992. She explained that a freelance mamasan is not\n\nemployed by or attached to a nightclub, and accompanies her customers to the nightclubs\n\nthey patronise. A host mamasan entertains her customers at a fixed establishment, but she\n\nis also not under its employment. The Plaintiff claimed that her takings as a freelance\n\nmamasan were more than $3,000 a month, but she did not say whether that was before or\n\nafter she shared the takings with her \"daughters\" (as freelance mamasans do).29 The Plaintiff did not produce any\n\ndocumentary evidence to support her claim on her earnings. She called Gan Chin Kuan, a\n\npartner of the Volvo (KTV) Karaoke Lounge (since renamed Classic KTV Karaoke Lounge), as\n\nher witness.30 His evidence was that the Plaintiff had\n\na 2-week trial period as a host mamasan from about 10 March 1997 and became as a regular\n\nhost mamasan from 3 April 1997. He confirmed that the Plaintiff received $110 for each\n\nbottle of liquor opened by customers entertained by the Plaintiff or her\n\n\"daughters\". He produced vouchers recording payment of $6,635 to her in April\n\n1997.31 However Mr Gan contradicted the\n\nPlaintiff’s claim that all the customers entertained by her and her\n\n\"daughters\" were her customers. He was quite firm that about 30% of them were\n\ncustomers of the \"daughters\".32 The Assistant Registrar did not accept\n\nthe Plaintiff’s claim that she earned $6,635 as a host mamasan. He held thatThe Plaintiff’s evidence in court was\n\n  that the full $6,635 commission was hers to keep and that her girls shared no part of it,\n\n  their remuneration consisting solely of tips given by their customers. In my view, the\n\n  possibility of the $6,635 commission having to be distributed between the Plaintiff and\n\n  her girls cannot be overlooked. Apart from the fact that the Plaintiff’s testimony\n\n  was wholly self-serving and uncorroborated by any documentary evidence or the evidence of\n\n  her girls (none of whom were called), the owner of the lounge’s (Gan Chin Kuan)\n\n  testimony was that for all of the Plaintiff and her girls’ work, he would pay a lump\n\n  sum commission to the Plaintiff and it was up to the Plaintiff to remunerate her girls, if\n\n  at all. There is thus a real possibility that the Plaintiff merely retained part of her\n\n  $6,635. This is particularly likely in light of the owner’s testimony that he knew as\n\n  a fact that the customers who patronised the Plaintiff and her girls belonged to both the\n\n  Plaintiff and her girls. There was consequently no reason for the Plaintiff to pocket the\n\n  full commission when some of the customers were actually not hers.33 He set the Plaintiff’s pre-trial\n\nincome at $2,200 per month, applied a multiplier of 33 months and awarded $72,600\n\npre-trial loss of earnings. The Plaintiff did not appeal against this award, which I\n\nupheld against the Second Defendants’ appeal.34 The Plaintiff has appealed against my\n\nvariation of the Assistant Registrar’s award for post-trial loss of earnings of\n\n$2,700 a month for 5 years, which worked on to $162,000.35 The Assistant Registrar set the higher\n\nmultiplicand for the post-trial earnings with the explanation thatThe pre-trial multiplicand is\n\n  significantly lower than the post-trial multiplicand because the economy was bad for the\n\n  second half of 1997, 1998 and for part of 1999. The services that the Plaintiff provided\n\n  was in the nature of a luxury item and therefore its performance was expected to fluctuate\n\n  with the economy...As for the post-trial multiplicand I have decided that $2,700 per month\n\n  was reasonable.36 It was not the Plaintiff’s case\n\nthat her earnings would have increased in 1999. She made her claims for pre-trial and\n\npost-trial loss of earnings on the same multiplicand of $6,635 per month. No submission on\n\neconomic fluctuations was made by counsel. There was no evidence before the Assistant\n\nRegistrar the state of the karaoke lounge business over that period or how that would\n\nimpact on a mamasan’s earnings. With no input from persons in the trade like Mr Gan\n\nor the Plaintiff’s former colleagues, these are not matters on which judicial notice\n\ncan be taken.37 Consequently, I did not uplift the\n\nmultiplicand for the post-trial loss and kept it at $2,200.38 That left the multiplier to be\n\nestablished. The Assistant Registrar set it at 5 years \"considering that the\n\nPlaintiff is already 54 at the time of the trial and the fact that the job in question is\n\ndependant on age\". There was little evidence to help the court. The Plaintiff said\n\nnothing about it in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, and only mentioned during\n\nre-examination that she could have worked for \"10 odd years\" if she was not\n\ninjured. Mr Gan told the Assistant Registrar that host mamasans can work for as long as\n\nthey want if they have their customers and \"daughters\", and that he had seen\n\nthem working to between 50 and 60, but he was non-committal about their working beyond 60.39 It is not clear what retirement age the\n\nAssistant Registrar adopted. I found that 60 years would be fair on the evidence\n\navailable. It is trite law that in assessing lost future income, the multiplier to be\n\napplied is not the full measure of the lost working years. This was made clear by the\n\nPrivy Council inLai Wee Lian v Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd[1984-1985] SLR 10, where Lord Fraser of Tullybelton held that in the selection of an appropriate\n\nmultiplier discounts should be made for the inevitable contingencies and uncertainties of\n\nhuman life and working capacity, as well as the fact that an award for lost future\n\nearnings is received in an accelerated lump sum payment.40 Looking at the Plaintiff’s\n\nemployment record, she was working as a host mamasan for about a month and was a freelance\n\nmamasan before that. From the evidence it can be inferred that mamasans are prone to come\n\nand go, as are the lounges and nightclubs they operate in.41 Apart from the lower limb injuries and\n\nstress disorder, the Plaintiff was having problems with her eyes which would affect her\n\nability to work. She developed cataracts in both eyes after the accident.The left eye underwent surgery in\n\nSeptember 1997, and the right eye was operated on in August 1999. The Plaintiff deposed on\n\n29 November 1999 that she was still having trouble with her vision, with numerical figures\n\nappearing sometimes reversed as in a mirror image, or upside down, or as entirely\n\ndifferent figures, and vision of her left eye is blur. The Assistant Registrar had found\n\nthat the eye condition was not connected to the accident and the Plaintiff had not\n\nappealed against this finding.42 After taking these matters into\n\nconsideration, I found that the multiplier of 5 years is not justified, and I set it at 3\n\nyears. Consequently I reduced the award for post-trial loss of income to $2,200 for 3\n\nyears, or $79,200, from the $162,000 awarded by the Assistant Registrar.Kan Ting ChiuJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
