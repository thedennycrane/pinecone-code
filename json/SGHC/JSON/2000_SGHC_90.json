        "The cautioned statement": "7. In the afternoon of 11 April the investigation officer recorded her\n\ncautioned statement in which she statedA Chinese man asked me to keep some packets for him. He told me that he\n\n  would collect the packets from me one or two days later. When I took the packets to my\n\n  master bedroom, I then discovered that the packets were opium. I immediately went out of\n\n  my flat to look for the Chinese man but he had already gone. I was thinking whether to\n\n  call the police or to wait for the Chinese man to collect the packets back from me. When\n\n  the police came, I opened the door and led the policemen to my bedroom where the packets\n\n  were. I do not know the name of this Chinese man. I can only recognise him by sight. I do\n\n  not know why this Chinese man handed these packages to me to keep for him.The investigation statements8. On 13 April, the recording of her investigation statements commenced\n\nwhich was completed over several days. I will paraphrase the contents of the\n\nstatements.Statement of 13 April9. On the night of 10 April she received a page on her pager. When she\n\ncalled back, a man answered in Hokkien who said his name was Ah Tan and that he was a\n\nfriend of her husband and asked her to keep something for him. She asked him what they\n\nwere but he only said that there were only a few packets, without saying what they were.\n\nNevertheless she agreed to keep them for him. On the next morning, which was Sunday 11\n\nApril she received a telephone call from another Chinese man. This man told her that he\n\nhad the things with him on the ground floor and was coming up to the third storey but he\n\ndid not know her flat. She told him that she would be standing at the door of her flat.\n\nShe went outside her door and saw a Chinese man came up the staircase carrying a blue bag\n\nand a red plastic bag. He placed them on the floor and went back down the stairs without\n\nspeaking to her.10. She took the two bags to her flat and into her bedroom. When she\n\ndetected a strong odour of opium she looked into the bags and saw packets wrapped in brown\n\nmasking tape. She wrapped the packets in newspapers and put each packet separately in a\n\nplastic bag, and then placed all eight packets under her bed. At that time she was\n\ndeciding whether to call the police or wait for Ah Tan to collect the packets.Statement of 15 April11. She wrapped the packets because the odour of opium was becoming\n\nunbearable. After placing the packets under the bed she waited to see if Ah Tan would call\n\nher. If he did not call, she would tell her sons about the opium when they woke up. A\n\nshort while later, there was a knock on the door, and she let the officers in.12. Ah Tan had never called her at home or at her stall, and she had\n\nonly contacted him once, when she returned his page. He did not offer her any payment for\n\nher help, but promised to collect the packets after a day or two.13. When she was shown a photograph of Tan Kok Hwa, she recognised him\n\nas a friend of her late husband, but she added that \"I did not know his name as my\n\nhusband never introduced him to me and I have never spoken to him. After the death of my\n\nhusband he never came by again. I do not know if he was the person who called me.\"",
        "Statement of 21 April": "14. Ah Tan had spoken to her about a week before 10 April. Except that\n\nhe told her that he was a friend of her husband, she cannot remember the conversation they\n\nhad.15. On the night of 10 April she was at a wedding dinner. When she\n\nreturned home she found an unfamiliar number on her pager. She called the number and Ah\n\nTan answered. He told her again he was her husband’s friend and asked her to keep a\n\nfew packets for him for a day or two which would be delivered to her flat in one or two\n\ndays’ time. Although she asked him what the packets were, he did not tell her.Statement of 29 April16. When the man brought the bags she did not tell him to leave them on\n\nthe staircase landing. After she discovered that those packets were opium, she was waiting\n\nfor Ah Tan to call her. If he did not call her before her sons woke up, she would call the\n\npolice. She did not think of calling Ah Tan although she could retrieve his telephone\n\nnumber from her pager.17. Referring to a photograph of Tan Kok Hwa, she said \"… I\n\ndo not know if this is the same \"Ah Tan\" who told me to keep the packages of\n\nopium for him. It could have possibly been some other person by the name of \"Ah\n\nTan\" who told me to do this, claiming to be my late husband’s friend.\"18. Some care was taken in recording these statements. Every one of\n\nthem was signed by her, and that before each statement was recorded, all the previous\n\nstatements were read to her.19. From the admissions in these statements, I found that there was a\n\ncase for her to enter her defence.",
        "The defence": "20. The accused is a widow. She stayed with two of her children at the\n\nflat, and was running a seafood stall with her eldest son. She met Tan Kok Hwa whom she\n\nknow as Ah Tan when he visited her late husband at the seafood stall. Her husband told her\n\nAh Tan had a kelong in Changi and was engaged in road construction.21. Ah Tan was a good friend of her husband, who had been kind to her\n\nfamily. He had lent her husband $40,000 to pay off his gambling debts, given another loan\n\nof $25,000 for them to renovate their flat and provided the funds for her son’s\n\neducation in Australia. Her husband had quantified the total debt to Ah Tan at $82,000. Ah\n\nTan had also proposed going into the restaurant business with her eldest son, although\n\nthat was not taken up. He was also instrumental in getting her and her husband to\n\nreconcile after they were divorced.22. When her husband (technically her former husband as they did not\n\nremarry after the reconciliation) was alive, he had kept things for Ah Tan in the flat.\n\nHer husband told her that Ah Tan brought the things from Pasir Panjang and had kept them\n\nin their flat because it was closer to Pasir Panjang than his own home.23. During that time, the things were brought to the flat in boxes by\n\nAh Tan or other persons on his behalf, and this would take place weekly or fortnightly.\n\nHer husband told her that they were dry foodstuff, but she did not open the boxes to\n\nexamine them.24. Ah Tan continued to keep things with her after her husband’s\n\ndeath. In February 1999 he telephoned her and asked to keep a few packets in her flat to\n\nbe collected in two days. She agreed and a box was sent to the flat of another son where\n\nshe was staying at that time. Ah Tan’s worker collected the box from her two days\n\nlater.25. About one week before her arrest on 11 April Ah Tan spoke to her\n\nagain and asked to keep a few packets in the flat again. She asked him how many packets\n\nthere would be and what they were, but he only told her that there would be a few packets.26. Ah Tan paged her again on the night of 10 April when she was at a\n\nwedding dinner. When she returned home she returned the call, and found that it was from\n\nAh Tan. He asked if he could keep a few packets in her flat the following morning, and she\n\nagreed. It was arranged that the person delivering them would call her when he arrived.27. On the morning of 11 April she received a telephone call. The\n\ncaller told her that he had some things for her. She instructed him to bring them up to\n\nthe third floor lift landing, and then she went out of her flat to meet him.28. She saw a Chinese man coming up the stairs with a travelling bag\n\nand a red plastic bag. She asked him if he was sent by Ah Tan to deliver the things, and\n\nhe confirmed that. She instructed him to leave them on the floor, and she carried them\n\nback to her bedroom.29. The travelling bag had a tear and there was a smell of opium. She\n\nrecognised the smell because her husband consumed opium. She was shocked by the smell and\n\nran out of her flat to look for the man who delivered the bags. Her intention was to\n\nascertain if he had delivered the wrong things from Ah Tan and to tell him to take them\n\nback. She failed to locate the man, and returned to her room. By that time the opium smell\n\nwas becoming unbearably strong and she was frightened. She realised that Ah Tan wanted to\n\nkeep the packets in her flat. She wrapped the packets in newspaper and placed them in\n\nplastic bags to reduce the odour. She tried to wake up her eldest son to talk to him, but\n\nbefore they could talk, the officers came.30. She was frightened when she was questioned by them. She did not\n\nanswer when she was asked why she brought the opium into the flat becauseIt did occur to me that this was Ah Tan’s things but the person\n\n  who delivered the things was a worker. To make it clear Ah Tan put his things in my place\n\n  but the person who delivered the things was a worker. If I were to say these things belong\n\n  to Ah Tan, what happens if it did not belong to him? This is drug. If this drug did not\n\n  belong to Ah Tan, if I say this belongs to Ah Tan, what happens if Ah Tan was not the\n\n  owner of these things? I was frightened then and I did not know how should I reply. So I\n\n  dare not say anything.31. She was referred by her counsel to her cautioned statement. She\n\nsaid she was frightened when she made it and had mentioned one man when there were two\n\nmen, Ah Tan and the man who made the delivery.32. When she made the statement, she was certain in her mind that Ah\n\nTan was involved with the opium. Nevertheless she did not mention Ah Tan in the statement\n\nbecause she could not bring herself to mention his name and wanted Ah Tan to admit his own\n\ninvolvement because he was a good friend of her husband.33. She was next referred to the statement of 13 April. She said that\n\nthe statement was wrong where it stated that in the telephone conversation of the night of\n\n10 April Ah Tan identified himself as Ah Tan, a friend of her husband.. She also corrected\n\nthat part of the statement where she said that she did not talk to the man who delivered\n\nthe packets. She also explained that she did not mention going outside the flat to look\n\nfor the man because she had forgotten that when she made the statement.34. With regard to the statement of 15 April she admitted she was wrong\n\nin saying that Ah Tan had never called her at home or at her stall but she could not\n\nexplain why she made this misstatement.35. She also admitted that she was not telling the truth when she\n\nstated that she did not know Tan Kok Hwa’s name and had never spoken to him because\n\nher husband did not introduce them, and when she that she did not know if he was the\n\nperson who called her on 10 April. She also could not explain why she made those\n\nmisstatements.36. Next her counsel referred her to her statement of 21 April. She\n\ncorrected the account of her conversations with Ah Tan the week before 10 April and on 10\n\nApril. Ah Tan did not say that he was a good friend of her husband. Again, she could not\n\nexplain why she made the misstatement.37. She went on to say that the statement was also wrong where she said\n\nthat she did not tell the man delivering the bags to place them on the staircase landing\n\nbecause she had told him to leave them there, but again she was not able to explain why\n\nshe said that in the statement. She was also unable to explain why she did not disclose\n\nthe conversation she had with that man.38. She was then referred to her statement that after she discovered\n\nthat the bags contained opium, she waited for Ah Tan’s call and if Ah Tan did not\n\ncall before her sons woke up, she would call the police. She confirmed to her counsel that\n\nshe had that intention, and she would have told the police there was opium in her house\n\nthat Ah Tan had left them for her to keep, and she would tell them about Ah Tan and what\n\nshe knew about him so that they can find and arrest him. She explained that she did not do\n\nthat in the investigation statement of 21 April because she knew Ah Tan was arrested by\n\nthat time and she was hoping that he would admit his connection to the drugs on his own.39. Her attention was drawn to the fact that when Inspector Jenny Tan\n\nquestioned her before she knew of Ah Tan’s arrest, she did not say anything about Ah\n\nTan. Her counsel asked why she did not, her answer was \"I cannot recall. I can’t\n\nthink of it.\"40. When she was cross-examined by the prosecutor the next day, the\n\naccused did a complete turn around and said that she had not thought of calling the police\n\nand that her previous evidence was untrue.41. The matter became more confused during re-examination. She changed\n\nher position again; she affirmed that she had intended to call the police, and that her\n\nevidence in cross-examination that she had no intention of calling the police was not the\n\ntruth. Her explanation for the confusion was \"I had intention to call for police and\n\nI cannot understand why I gave a different answer to the prosecutor when the question was\n\nasked.\"42. Her two sons who were in the flat during the raid gave evidence\n\nwhich did not relate to the main issues of the trial. Tan Kok Hwa and Lim Beng Soon, who\n\ndelivered the two bags were not called as witnesses by the prosecution or the defence\n\nalthough both of them were available.",
        "Evaluation of the evidence": "43. The accused was in possession of the packets in her bedroom. By her\n\nevidence she also knew they were opium when she became aware of the opium odour. Apart\n\nfrom bringing them into her bedroom, she wrapped them with newspapers and placed them in\n\nplastic bags. She did not call Ah Tan to complain about the opium, or insist that he took\n\nthem away.44. On these facts, a presumption arose under section 17 of the Misuse\n\nof Drugs Act that she had the drugs in her possession for the purpose of trafficking. The\n\ncritical issue was whether she had rebutted it.45. Her defence was that the drugs did not belong to her and that she\n\nhad only agreed to store some packets for Ah Tan, that she only knew they were opium after\n\nshe took possession of them and that she was not willing to keep opium for Ah Tan.46. There was no reason to disbelieve her disclaimer of ownership. Her\n\nevidence that Ah Tan had stored things in her flat was not disputed. However, that was not\n\nsufficient to exonerate her from culpability. Ownership is not a necessary element of\n\ntrafficking. Persons who transport drugs for others as well as those who hold drugs as\n\nbailees for their owners are also culpable – seeSze Siew Luan v PP[1997] 2 SLR 522.47. The crucial question was whether the accused was a knowing bailee\n\nof the opium. She said that Ah Tan did not tell her that the bags contained opium. She\n\nalso said that she was surprised to find the opium, and intended to call the police just\n\nbefore her flat was raided.48. If she was an unwilling bailee, one would expect her to take every\n\nopportunity to protest her innocence and disclose how Ah Tan had induced her into keeping\n\nthe packets for him. Her behaviour in the bedroom , and during the raid and the\n\ninvestigations did not bear that out.49. She said that when she realised that the bags contained opium, she\n\nwent out of the flat to look for the man who had delivered them. This was reflected in her\n\ncautioned statement, but not in her investigation statements where she gave a detailed\n\naccount of the events of that morning. She said that they did not speak when he made the\n\ndelivery, but her evidence in court was that after he confirmed that Ah Tan sent him and\n\nshe told him to leave the bags at the staircase landing.50. The opium was in her room for about 15 minutes before the raid.\n\nThere was time for her to call Ah Tan, or to take the drugs back to the staircase landing\n\nwhere the man had left them. Instead, she took them out of the bags, wrapped them and put\n\nthem under the bed and bedcover.51. If she had intended to report her discovery to the police,\n\nInspector Jenny Tan gave her the opportunity for her to mention Ah Tan and his request to\n\nstore his things in her flat, but she remained silent when asked how the opium came to be\n\nin the room.52. Even after she was charged with trafficking she still failed to\n\nmention Ah Tan in her cautioned statement. When she eventually mentioned Ah Tan in her\n\ninvestigation statements, she was still not telling all that she knew. She refused to\n\nidentify Tan Kok Hwa as Ah Tan and she did not reveal that he was a good friend of her\n\nfamily, but described him as someone who had to identify himself to her as a friend of her\n\nlate husband.53. What she said in the flat, during the investigations and in court\n\nwas marked with inconsistencies, contradictions and unanswered questions. It did not\n\npresent a picture of a person who had unwittingly stored drugs in her house and was\n\nanxious to explain her innocence by telling the plain truth.54. Her counsel took considerable pains to get her to explain and\n\nresolve the inconsistencies and I gave him and her all the leeway to do that. Despite the\n\neffort and the indulgence, she did not present a consistent account of the events. Instead\n\nshe contradicted and retracted her own evidence, and failed to explain the misstatements\n\nshe made. After reviewing her evidence, I found she had not given credible evidence that\n\nsupported her innocence and that she had not rebutted the presumption on a balance of\n\nprobabilities.55. In those circumstances, I found her guilty and convicted her on the\n\ncharge and imposed the mandatory sentence on her.Kan Ting ChiuJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
