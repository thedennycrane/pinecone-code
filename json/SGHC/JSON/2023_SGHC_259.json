        "Introduction": "1 At the heart of this dispute is a conservation shophouse located at 11 Martaban Road, Singapore 328639 (“11 Martaban”). The registered proprietor of 11 Martaban is the first defendant, Dr Chiang Hai Ding (“Dr Chiang”). 2 The second defendant, Mr Chiang Joon Arn (“Mr Chiang”), is Dr Chiang’s son. Mr Chiang and the plaintiff, Ms Tan Hui Min Sabrina Alberta (“Ms Tan”), are undergoing divorce proceedings. 3 Ms Tan seeks a declaration that she and/or Mr Chiang are the beneficial owners of 11 Martaban. The defendants, on the other hand, contend that 11 Martaban belongs solely to Dr Chiang.",
        "Undisputed facts": "",
        "The parties": "4 Ms Tan and Mr Chiang (“the Couple”) registered their marriage on 21 December 2011.1Foot Note 1×Agreed List of Non-Issues (“AL”) at S/N 1 and S/N 2.In their divorce proceedingsvideFC/D 4921/2020, interim judgment was granted on 7 May 2021.2Foot Note 2×AL at S/N 3.Dr Chiang is a former civil servant and Member of Parliament.3Foot Note 3×AL at S/N 5. 5 Ms Tan is a chartered accountant.4Foot Note 4×AL at S/N 8.From 1994 to 1997, Ms Tan was an auditor at Ernst and Young (“EY”). At that time, Mr Chiang also worked at EY, and it was then that the Couple met. In 1997, Ms Tan moved to work at Saatchi & Saatchi as a senior accountant for two years. From 1999 to 2002, Ms Tan was the Finance Director at Carlson Marketing Group.5Foot Note 5×AL at S/N 7 and S/N 10. 6 Ms Tan resigned from Carlson Marketing Group in 2002 to join Mr Chiang in Boston, United States of America (“US”), where he was posted for work by EY.6Foot Note 6×AL at S/N 11.There, the Couple set up a joint bank account with the Bank of America.7Foot Note 7×AL at S/N 12.They later opened another joint bank account in Singapore, with OCBC Bank.8Foot Note 8×AL at S/N 13.I shall refer to these as “the Two Joint Accounts”. 7 Around 2005 to 2006, the Couple purchased a Housing Development Board (“HDB”) flat at Pinnacle @ Duxton (“the Pinnacle Flat”) for $306,500 in their joint names. Ms Tan’s parents paid the $2,000 application fee on behalf of the Couple.9Foot Note 9×AL at S/N 14.Eventually, this was used as the matrimonial home.",
        "Purchase of 11 Martaban": "8 In or around 2009, Ms Tan and Mr Steven Kwang (“Mr Kwang”), the Chiang family’s property agent, went for various viewings of shophouses across Singapore.10Foot Note 10×AL at S/N 16.11 Martaban was first identified by Ms Tan in 2009. She then told Mr Chiang about it.11Foot Note 11×AL at S/N 17.In the same year, 11 Martaban was purchased for $2,100,000 and registered in Dr Chiang’s sole name. Mr Chiang did not have sufficient funds to pay the downpayment amount of $820,000. Therefore, Mr Chiang and Dr Chiang paid approximately $520,000 and $300,000, respectively, towards the downpayment of the property.12Foot Note 12×AL at S/N 18 and S/N 19.The remaining purchase price was financed by a mortgage of $1,280,000 taken out in Mr Chiang’s sole name (“the Mortgage”).13Foot Note 13×AL at S/N 22.",
        "The Couple’s involvement in 11 Martaban": "9 After its purchase, 11 Martaban was rented out. Its rental income was used to finance the Mortgage repayments. When 11 Martaban was not rented out, Mr Chiang would service the Mortgage.14Foot Note 14×AL at S/N 24.Mr Chiang also paid the property tax for 11 Martaban for at least the past six years.15Foot Note 15×AL at S/N 25.Mr Chiang also reimbursed Dr Chiang for income tax payments arising from the property’s rental income that the latter had made.16Foot Note 16×AL at S/N 26. 10 Turning to Ms Tan’s involvement, in September 2014, Ms Tan reviewed and amended a tenancy agreement for 11 Martaban.17Foot Note 17×AL at S/N 27.Sometime between 2014 and 2015, there were roof water leakages in 11 Martaban. Ms Tan sourced suitable contractors and reviewed quotations to fix the leakage problem. After she found a suitable contractor, she oversaw the rectification works to resolve the issue.18Foot Note 18×AL at S/N 28.Moreover, Ms Tan also liaised with Mr Kwang to check a tenant out of 11 Martaban in April 2016.19Foot Note 19×AL at S/N 30. 11 In 2017, Ms Tan was diagnosed with endometrial cancer, and she began receiving treatment.20Foot Note 20×AL at S/N 31.Sometime in 2017, a real estate agent, Ms Loh Suat Hui (“Ms Loh”) was appointed as the estate agent for 11 Martaban.21Foot Note 21×AL at S/N 32.As at the date of the filing of the Defence, the property had been in a state of disrepair since 2018 and had not been tenanted since that time.22Foot Note 22×AL at S/N 33.",
        "The breakdown in the relationship": "12 On 30 October 2020, Ms Tan commenced divorce proceedings against Mr Chiang.23Foot Note 23×AL at S/N 35.The present suit arises out of the divorce proceedings, as the parties disagree as to whether 11 Martaban forms part of the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided. Should the property belong solely to Dr Chiang, it would not be a matrimonial asset.",
        "The parties’ cases": "13 Ms Tan’s main case is that although 11 Martaban was purchased before their marriage, all along, the parties had intended that Dr Chiang hold it on trust for the Couple. As such, they are the true beneficial owners of the property.24Foot Note 24×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions (“PCS”) at para 1(a). 14 Ms Tan’s narrative is that the Couple always dreamed of owning and living in a shophouse.25Foot Note 25×PCS at para 20.11 Martaban was their joint investment.26Foot Note 26×PCS at paras 26–40.The Couple only used Dr Chiang’s name to purchase the property because they could not purchase it under their names. After the purchase of the Pinnacle Flat, they had to fulfil HDB’s “minimum occupancy period” (“MOP”) of five years before any purchase of private property could be made (“the HDB MOP restriction”).27Foot Note 27×PCS at paras 33–34. 15 After the purchase of 11 Martaban, the Couple bore the expenses28Foot Note 28×PCS at paras 98–101.and reaped all of the benefits of the property.29Foot Note 29×PCS at para 82.As framed, Ms Tan’s claim is premised on a common intention constructive trust over the property in favour of the Couple, and I shall refer to the alleged understanding of the parties as “the Alleged Arrangement”. 16 Further, and in the alternative, Ms Tan alleges that a resulting trust has arisen such that the Couple are the beneficial owners of 11 Martaban.30Foot Note 30×PCS at para 1(b).Ms Tan’s position is that the Couple had paid towards the downpayment of the property and taken up the liability for the Mortgage, which gives rise to a presumed resulting trust at law. Ms Tan contends that a resulting trust arises in favour of the Couple as full beneficial owners and that the defendants are unable to rebut this presumption as the Couple did not intend to benefit Dr Chiang with 11 Martaban.31Foot Note 31×PCS at para 118.As regards Dr Chiang’s contribution of $300,000 to 11 Martaban’s purchase price, this was a loan and is accordingly to be taken as the Couple’s joint contribution.32Foot Note 32×PCS at para 121.However, should the court find that Dr Chiang’s contribution of $300,000 was personal to him, and not a loan to the Couple, then the beneficial ownership would be 85.72% in favour of the Couple and 14.28% in favour of Dr Chiang.33Foot Note 33×PCS at para 122.I shall refer to this as the “First Alternative Case”. 17 Further, and in the alternative, Ms Tan says that should the court find that Mr Chiang’s contributions were for himself only and not made on behalf of the Couple, then the resulting trust arises solely in favour of Mr Chiang.34Foot Note 34×PCS at para 1(c).Within this alternative case, should Dr Chiang’s contribution of $300,000 be treated as his personal contribution towards 11 Martaban, Mr Chiang and Dr Chiang would hold the property as 85.72% and 14.28% beneficial owners respectively.35Foot Note 35×PCS at para 122.I shall refer to this as the “Second Alternative Case”. 18 Turning to the defendants’ case, Dr Chiang and Mr Chiang’s main defence is that there was no agreement between the parties for 11 Martaban to be held by Dr Chiang on behalf of the Couple.36Foot Note 36×Defendants’ Closing Submissions (“DCS”) at para 25.11 Martaban was not purchased pursuant to the Alleged Arrangement37Foot Note 37×DCS at para 55.and the parties’ conduct following the purchase of the property was inconsistent with the Alleged Arrangement.38Foot Note 38×DCS at para 60. 19 The defendants’ narrative is that Dr Chiang invests in properties. He expressed his interest in buying a shophouse to Mr Chiang, and Mr Chiang and Ms Tan helped in the search for 11 Martaban.39Foot Note 39×DCS at paras 104–105.After 11 Martaban was identified, Mr Chiang wanted to help his father realise this dream of owning a shophouse. As Dr Chiang did not qualify for any bank loans, Mr Chiang agreed to take out the Mortgage in his name (to be financed by the rental proceeds).40Foot Note 40×DCS at paras 106 and 109.As a gift to his father, Mr Chiang also wanted to pay the downpayment in full. Due to insufficiency of funds, he was only able to pay $520,000.41Foot Note 41×DCS at paras 107–108.As 11 Martaban was a gift to Dr Chiang, all of Mr Chiang’s contributions to the property were meant to benefit Dr Chiang.42Foot Note 42×DCS at paras 95 and 111.I shall refer to this as the “Gift Narrative”.",
        "Whether Ms Tan’s pleadings limit her claim to the Couple being joint beneficiaries": "20 Before I set out the substantive issues, as a preliminary matter, the defendants take issue with Ms Tan’s alternative case that Dr Chiang holds 11 Martaban on trustsolelyfor Mr Chiang’s benefit. This is because Ms Tan’s pleaded case has always referred to the Couple asjointbeneficiaries of the alleged trust.43Foot Note 43×DCS at paras 14–15.Accordingly, Ms Tan’s claim, on either a common intention constructive trust or resulting trust, should be limited to the Couple being joint beneficiaries.44Foot Note 44×DCS at para 9. 21 To be fair to Ms Tan, while the defendants argue that Ms Tan’s case on both a common intention constructive trustandresulting trust should be limited to the Couple being joint beneficiaries, as I set out above, Ms Tan does not claim for a common intention constructive trust whereby Dr Chiang holds 11 Martaban for Mr Chiang’s sole benefit. This much is clear from the written submissions.45Foot Note 45×PCS at para 1.Further, when addressing the preliminary objection in her reply submissions, Ms Tan does not at all allude to the possibility of a common intention constructive trust in favour of only Mr Chiang.46Foot Note 46×See Plaintiff’s Reply Closing Submissions (“PRCS”) at paras 28–36.Accordingly, it seems that the defendants’ preliminary objection as regards the constructive trust was only made to foreclose any possibility of this court declaring the existence of a common intention constructive trust in favour of Mr Chiang only. Therefore, I shall only address the preliminary objection in relation to a resulting trust for the sole benefit of Mr Chiang,ie,the Second Alternative Case.",
        "The parties’ arguments": "22 The defendants’ basis for the objection is that Ms Tan’s pleaded case has always referred to the Couple asjointbeneficiaries of an alleged trust.47Foot Note 47×DCS at para 14.Nowhere do the pleadings point to Mr Chiang being the sole beneficiary to the exclusion of Ms Tan.48Foot Note 48×DCS at para 15.While Ms Tan has sought to rely on her claimed relief as the basis for the position, this does not assist her as the issue is not whether Ms Tan has claimed for alternative relief, but whether she has pleaded the material facts to support the cause of action upon which the relief is claimed.49Foot Note 49×DCS at para 17. 23 In any event, even if the pleaded relief is taken into account, a plain reading of its express wording suggests that Ms Tan’s real case is that the Couple are the beneficial owners of 11 Martaban. In her Statement of Claim, Ms Tan seeks “[a] declaration that the 1st Defendant is holding Martaban on behalf of the Plaintiff and/or the 2nd Defendant,who are the beneficial owners of Martaban[(“Prayer 1”)]” [emphasis added].50Foot Note 50×DCS at paras 18–19; Statement of Claim at para 20(1). 24 Moreover, Ms Tan’s claim is always premised on the factual assertion that the Couple are joint beneficiaries. Prior to the commencement of these proceedings, Ms Tan’s solicitors wrote to Mr Chiang’s solicitors, setting out her claim that 11 Martaban was a “joint investment” between the Couple and held on trust on behalf of the Couple by Dr Chiang (“the Letter”).51Foot Note 51×DCS at para 20. 25 In contrast, Ms Tan argues that the objection is without merit for the following reasons: (a) First, all material facts were pleaded and placed before the court,52Foot Note 52×PRCS at paras 30–31.and the Second Alternative Case was put to the defendants at trial.53Foot Note 53×PRCS at para 33. (b) Second, in any event, the defendants were not taken by surprise and were fully aware of Ms Tan’s pleaded case at the outset. In this connection, Ms Tan points to the defendants’ Opening Statement, where they expressly state that Ms Tan is seeking a declaration that Dr Chiang holds 11 Martaban for herand/orMr Chiang. The defendants also agreed in the Agreed List of Non-Issues that one of the issues to be determined in this suit is “whether a resulting trust arises, such that the [Ms Tan]and/or[Mr Chiang] are the beneficial owners of 11 Martaban [emphasis added]”.54Foot Note 54×PCS at para 124; AL at S/N 3. (c) Third, if Prayer 1 is defective, the court can still grant Ms Tan the alternative relief under Prayer 3 of the Statement of Claim, where Ms Tan has prayed for further and/or other reliefs as the court deems fit.55Foot Note 55×PRCS at para 30; Statement of Claim (“SOC”) at para 20(3). (d) Fourth, it is a non-starter for the defendants to assert that Ms Tan is barred from running the Second Alternative Case on the basis of the Letter, as Ms Tan cannot possibly be bound by the Letter in any way in her claim.56Foot Note 56×PRCS at para 34.",
        "The legal principles on pleadings": "26 It is a well-established principle that parties are bound by their pleadings, and the court is prohibited from making decisions on issues that have not been pleaded by the parties. However, if a legal outcome is to be relied upon, it is not necessary to explicitly state that outcome in the pleadings. What is crucial is that the pleadings contain, at the very least, the essential facts that support the cause of action relied on:Ho Soo Tong and others v Ho Soo Fong and others[2023] SGHC 90 (“Ho Soo Tong”) at [43]. The party can then develop the legal consequences of those facts in submissions:Acute Result Holdings Ltd v CGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd (formerly known as CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd)[2022] SGHC 45 at [64]. The fundamental purpose of the law of pleadings is to prevent unforeseen surprises from arising during trial:Ho Soo Tongat [43].",
        "Analysis": "Whether Dr Chiang’s contribution of $300,000 was a loan 104 In relation to claims based on resulting trust,ie,the First Alternative Case and the Second Alternative Case, Ms Tan’s position is that Dr Chiang’s contribution of $300,000 was a loan to the Couple (see [16] above). However, as stated above (at [68]), I do not accept that, on balance, Dr Chiang’s contribution of $300,000 to the property’s downpayment was a loan to the Couple. In the absence of any other position by Ms Tan, as Ms Tan accepts, this amount would be treated as Dr Chiang’s personal contribution towards the property in his name.165Foot Note 165×PRCS at para 31(a). Whether Mr Chiang’s financial contributions were made on behalf of the Couple 105 As set out at [16] above, the First Alternative Case is premised on Mr Chiang’s contributions being attributed to the Couple, thereby giving rise to the resulting trust in favour of the Couple. 106 However, as I have discussed at [77] above, Ms Tan did not contribute to any part of the purchase price of 11 Martaban or towards the repayments of the Mortgage. All the financial contributions were made directly by Mr Chiang. The question which sometimes arises, as to how to treat subsequent payments of mortgage instalments, isirrelevanthere because there is no suggestion that any party other than Mr Chiang agreed to make or made any of the subsequent mortgage repayments. 107 Before me, there was simply no concrete evidence showing that Mr Chiang made the financial contributions on the Couple’s behalf. I accepted (at [39] above) that at the material time, the Couple were in a serious relationship and made some joint financial decisions. However, they did not manage all their finances jointly. Without any more evidence that these substantial contributions were made on the Couple’s behalf, the bare assertion by Ms Tan does not suffice. In fact, I note that for the Pinnacle Flat (which was meant to be the matrimonial home), Ms Tan made direct financial contributions on her own, and did not appear to rely on Mr Chiang to pay on her behalf. Accordingly, I find that Mr Chiang’s financial contributions towards the property were his own. This means that the First Alternative Case is not made out. The defendants’ respective financial contributions 108 By the above, the respective financial contributions by Mr Chiang and Dr Chiang (as set out at [8]) would give rise to the following beneficial interests in 11 Martaban under a presumed resulting trust:  Direct financial contributionsS/No.ContributionValueProportion (%)Mr Chiang’s contributions1Downpayment$520,0002Liability incurred for the Mortgage$1,280,000Sub-total$1,800,00085.71%Dr Chiang’s contributions3Downpayment$300,000Sub-total$300,00014.29%Total$2,100,000100.00% 109 Ms Tan used the same figures for computation. However, she has arrived at 85.72% and 14.28%. There is a negligible difference of 0.01%, which I surmise arises from Ms Tanrounding upthe percentage of Mr Chiang’s contribution as against Dr Chiang. I will, therefore, use the proportions of 85.71% and 14.29%. 110 A presumption of resulting trust may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary (Lau Siew Kimat [36]). It may also be rebutted by the presumption of advancement (Lau Siew Kimat [57];Chan Yuen Lanat [160(e)]), which arises as a consequence of a pre-existing relationship between the parties to the acquisition, where the contributor is regarded as morally obliged to provide for the person benefiting (Lau Siew Kimat [58]). However, contributions from child to father, as is the case here, do not fall within a recognised category that may attract the presumption of advancement. Indeed, equity does not readily presume that children generally intend to make gifts to their parents:Ang Hai San Henry v Ang Bee Lin Elizabeth and another[2010] SGHC 353 at [8]. Accordingly, the presumption of advancement does not arise in favour of Dr Chiang. As I have rejected the Gift Narrative, the presumption of resulting trust, which has arisen in the present case, remains unrebutted.",
        "Issues to be determined": "33 In light of the above, the main case turns on the question of whether the Alleged Arrangement exists,ie,that there was a common intention shared by the parties that Dr Chiang would hold 11 Martaban on trust for the Couple when the property was acquired. If the answer to the question is “yes”, then the issue of whether a resulting trust has arisen will be moot, as Dr Chiang would hold the beneficial interest of 11 Martaban in accordance with that common intention and not in the manner under a resulting trust:Chan Yuen Lanat [158] and [160(b)]. However, if the answer is “no”, I will then proceed to consider whether a resulting trust has arisen either in favour of the Couple,ie,the First Alternative Case, or in favour of Mr Chiang only,ie,the Second Alternative Case. If a resulting trust has arisen on either alternative case, the proportions of beneficial interests must also be determined. Intertwined with all of these issues is the question of whether 11 Martaban was a gift by Mr Chiang to Dr Chiang,ie, the Gift Narrative. With that, I consider the main case.",
        "Whether a common intention constructive trust has arisen": "",
        "The applicable legal principles": "102 To reiterate, a presumption of resulting trust may arise when a person makes a voluntary contribution (wholly or in part) to the purchase price of a property which was vested in another (Lau Siew Kimat [34];Chan Yuen Lanat [36]). As a resulting trust crystallises at the point in which the property in question was acquired, the quantification of each party’s share of the beneficial interest in the property is determined by his or her “direct” contribution to the purchase price of the property (Lau Siew Kimat [112]–[113]). Such “direct” contributions include the sumsborrowedby a mortgagor to be used for the purchase and subsequent payments of the mortgage instalments (by a person other than the mortgagor) made pursuant to an agreement between the parties at the time the mortgage was taken out (Lau Siew Kimat [115]–[117];SuEmmanuelat [87]–[89]). 103 To recapitulate, Mr Chiang and Dr Chiang paid approximately $520,000 and $300,000, respectively, to the downpayment of 11 Martaban. The remaining purchase price was financed by a Mortgage of $1,280,000 taken out in Mr Chiang’s sole name (see [8] above). As I have rejected the Gift Narrative as an afterthought, there is an absence of evidence pointing to a clear intention on the part of Mr Chiang to benefit Dr Chiang. Therefore, it is appropriate to invoke the presumption of resulting trust (Chan Yuen Lanat [51]–[52];Su Emmanuelat [79]).",
        "Whether a resulting trust has arisen": "",
        "Conclusion": "111 To sum up, I reject Ms Tan’s claim that 11 Martaban belongs to the Couple, and I also disbelieve the defendants’ claim that the property is an outright gift by Mr Chiang to Dr Chiang. 112 Based on the available evidence before me, it appears to me that this was what happened. In happier times, the Couple desired to own a shophouse, but they were unable to purchase 11 Martaban in their own names. Dr Chiang stepped in to assist by allowing the property to be registered in his name. Mr Chiang was to pay for the property, and he would be the beneficial owner of the property. In relation to Ms Tan’s interests, nothing was expressly agreed upon. She was not expected to, and did not, contribute financially. However, given that she was about to marry Mr Chiang, Ms Tan did not object to the arrangement. In fact, Ms Tan was willing to be involved in the acquisition of the property and in taking care of the property after its purchase. After all, it would be Mr Chiang’s asset. As it transpired, Mr Chiang was short of funds, and Dr Chiang contributed towards the downpayment of the property. While this gained Dr Chiang a small beneficial interest in the property, it was not meant to be an outright gift to him. 113 By all of the above, Ms Tan’s claims that the Couple is jointly entitled to the full beneficial interest of 11 Martaban under a common constructive trust or resulting trust are dismissed for insufficiency of evidence. 114 Given that Mr Chiang contributed 85.71% towards the purchase price of 11 Martaban, I make a declaration that Dr Chiang holds 85.71% of the beneficial interest in the property on behalf of Mr Chiang under a resulting trust. For the avoidance of doubt, Dr Chiang is the beneficial owner of 14.29% of the property. 115 As I stated at [12] above, Ms Tan and Mr Chiang are engaged in ongoing divorce proceedings. Whether Mr Chiang’s beneficial interest in 85.71% of 11 Martaban forms part of the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided now falls to be determined in those proceedings. 116 Parties are to file their submissions on costs within two weeks of this judgment.
