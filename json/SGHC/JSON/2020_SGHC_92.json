        "Introduction": "1 The accused, Toh Sia Guan, was charged with murdering the deceased, Goh Eng Thiam, in the course of a fight in the Geylang neighbourhood,1Foot Note 1×Prosecution’s closing submissions dated 3 February 2020 (“PCS”) at para 1pursuant to s 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”). He was convicted after trial and sentenced to life imprisonment. He has now appealed against both his conviction and sentence.",
        "Background": "",
        "The charge": "2 The charge read that:2Foot Note 2×PCS at pp 1 to 2; Charge Sheet of 17 July 2019 [The accused], on 9 July 2016, sometime between about 7.55 am and 7.57 am, at Lorong 23 Geylang, Singapore, did commit murder by causing such bodily injury as is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of one Goh Eng Thiam, and [he had] thereby committed an offence under s 300(c) and punishable under s 302(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). 3 The punishment prescribed under s 302 of the Penal Code was either death or imprisonment for life.",
        "Agreed Facts": "4 A Statement of Agreed Facts was signed by the parties under s 267(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”).3Foot Note 3×Statement of Agreed Facts dated 31 July 2019 (“SAF”)The material portions were as follows. First information report 5 On 9 July 2016, at about 7:58 am, Mr Ong Yong Teck (“Mr Ong”), a taxi driver, informed the police via call that: there was a Chinese man (the deceased) standing at Lorong 23 Geylang with blood all over his body; he had a wooden pole with him; and another Chinese man (the accused) also with blood on his body was seen walking towards Lorong 21.4Foot Note 4×SAF at p 2Paramedics arrived at about 8:09 am.5Foot Note 5×SAF at para 5By that time, the deceased lay in a pool of blood with his head on the kerb.6Foot Note 6×SAF at para 5A paramedic found that there was no pulse, he was not breathing and his pupils were dilated.7Foot Note 7×SAF at para 5An electrocardiogram test performed on the deceased showed an asystole (a flat line); as such, the deceased was pronounced dead at 8:11 am.8Foot Note 8×SAF at para 5The paramedic saw that there was a bloodied knife sheathed in its plastic cover (“the murder knife”), on the right side of the deceased, and a wooden stick (“the wooden stick”) lying near his left leg.9Foot Note 9×SAF at para 5 The first fight 6 At about 7:39 am that day, the accused encountered the deceased at Victoria Food Court at No 2 Lorong 23 Geylang.10Foot Note 10×SAF at paras 7 and 9The accused had stopped his bicycle near the food court where the deceased was sitting.11Foot Note 11×SAF at para 9The accused thought the deceased was staring at him; to defuse the tension, the accused asked the deceased whether he sold Chinese medicine.12Foot Note 12×SAF at para 9This made the deceased angry and he shouted Hokkien vulgarities at the accused.13Foot Note 13×SAF at para 9A fight ensued (the “first fight”), and was captured by CCTV cameras, showing the time to be about 7:40 am.14Foot Note 14×SAF at para 9 7 After the first fight, the accused went and bought a pair of slippers and the murder knife from a shop at No 43 Lorong 25 Geylang.15Foot Note 15×SAF at para 12In the meantime, the deceased approached Wang Heng, an acquaintance of his, at the back of a restaurant at 9 Aljunied Road, to clean himself up, and also spoke on the phone with Yeo Kok Chong (“Yeo”), his flatmate.16Foot Note 16×SAF at paras 3, 7 and 12 The second fight 8 Shortly after, the accused then returned to Lorong 23 Geylang where he encountered the deceased, and at about 7:55 am, another fight ensued between the accused and deceased (the “second fight”); this fight was again partly captured by CCTV cameras.17Foot Note 17×SAF at paras 13 to 14The accused left the scene at about 7:57:22 am, with his shirt bloodstained and wearing only one slipper.18Foot Note 18×SAF at para 14 The accused’s movement after the second fight 9 After leaving the scene, the deceased removed his bloodstained shirt and put on another shirt which he took from a clothesline in the area.19Foot Note 19×SAF at para 18He then purchased slippers from a supermarket.20Foot Note 20×SAF at para 18He left the Geylang area and did not return there.21Foot Note 21×SAF at para 18Twelve days later, he was arrested at Labrador Park MRT station, following a sighting in the area.22Foot Note 22×SAF at para 19 Subsequent reports 10 An autopsy was performed on the deceased by Dr Paul Chui (“Dr Chui”), who certified the cause of death to be a stab wound to the right upper arm that was V-shaped (the “fatal injury”).23Foot Note 23×SAF at paras 20 to 21It was subsequently clarified that the deceased had two groups of injuries, namely:24Foot Note 24×SAF at para 23incised/stab wounds which could have arisen from contact with a bladed weapon such as a knife; and other injuries which were minor injuries. The fatal injury was amongst the first category, and it was a through and through stab wound on the inside of the right upper arm that could in the ordinary course of nature cause death.25Foot Note 25×SAF at para 24 11 Toxicology reports indicated the absence of alcohol and drugs in the samples of the deceased’s blood and urine.26Foot Note 26×SAF at para 25 12 Forensic analysis showed that eight recent areas of damage were found on the deceased’s bloodied red and white striped collared T-shirt:27Foot Note 27×SAF at paras 26 and 27; Agreed Bundle (Amended) (“AB”) at p 182 (a) Six cuts on the left sleeve; (b) A 30 mm long linear cut on the left chest region; and (c) A two-segmented cut with segments measuring 40 mm long and 28 mm long on the right sleeve. 13 Fibre examination, damage examination and results of the simulation experiments showed that the murder knife could have caused the cuts.28Foot Note 28×SAF at para 27 14 DNA analysis showed that the deceased’s DNA was found on the wooden stick, the murder knife, the plastic sheath, and his collared T-shirt, whereas the accused’s DNA profile was not found on all of these.29Foot Note 29×SAF at para 29Both the accused’s and deceased’s DNA were found on a pair of pants worn by the accused on the day of the incident.30Foot Note 30×SAF at para 29 15 Medical analysis of the accused showed that the accused had old healing injuries:31Foot Note 31×SAF at para 30wounds over the back of his right hand; and bruising over his left hand. 16 A psychiatric assessment found that the accused:32Foot Note 32×SAF at para 31was not suffering from any mental disorder or intellectual disability; was not of unsound mind at the time of the alleged offence; would have been aware of the nature of his actions at the time of the alleged offence; and was fit to give his plea. 17 Various statements were recorded from the accused, which were given voluntarily.33Foot Note 33×SAF at paras 32 to 33",
        "The Autopsy report": "18 There was an autopsy report by Dr Chui adduced in the agreed bundle, although not included in the agreed facts.34Foot Note 34×AB at p 80The autopsy report set out the injuries suffered by the deceased, amongst which included, of note:35Foot Note 35×AB at pp 80 to 82 (a) a slicing tangential laceration injury to the left side of the face;36Foot Note 36×AB at p 80, number 4; p 95 para 3 (b) multiple stab wounds on the scalp,37Foot Note 37×AB at p 80, numbers 1 and 2likely to have been caused by vertical downward actions;38Foot Note 38×AB at p 95, para 3 (c) a stab wound on the chest;39Foot Note 39×AB at p 81, number 8and (d) the fatal injury: a through and through V-shaped stab wound to the inside of the right upper arm, formed by two stab wounds joined at the apex of the “V”, completely cutting the right branchial artery and cutting into the basilic vein.40Foot Note 40×AB at p 81, number 9; AB at p 96 19 The “two stab wounds” of the fatal injury described in the autopsy report was later clarified by Dr Chui at trial to refer to a singular cut/ impact, with one entry wound and one exit wound, together forming the V-shape.41Foot Note 41×Notes of Evidence (“NE”) 7 August 2019 at pp 15 to 16",
        "Witnesses and Video recording": "20 Only one of the Prosecution’s witnesses, Mr Ang Yong Ping (“Mr Ang”), was a direct witness to a part of the fight.42Foot Note 42×NE 6 August 2019 at p 68; PCS at para 14The Prosecution did not adduce other direct witnesses, although it seemed that there were some, since Mr Ang in his statement testified that there had been other on-lookers.43Foot Note 43×AB at p 49The CCTV footage also showed that there were passer-bys which should have had seen the fight.44Foot Note 44×P332, video titled “22 – 6C Lor 23(Cam1)” 21 The CCTV footage captured part of the first fight and a fraction of the second fight, but they did not capture the causing of the fatal injury or the other stab wounds. The available footage only recorded a few seconds showing the lower half of the bodies of the accused and deceased during the second fight.45Foot Note 45×P332, video titled “TCFB_0365_2016 Annex B” (“stitch video”) at 10:23 to 10:28 of stitch video run time, which correlates to 8:27:37 am to 8:27:42 am of CCTV time (see also P478 s/n 16; and AB pp 221 to 230)",
        "The Prosecution’s Case": "22 The Prosecution argued that there were four elements to prove murder under s 300(c) of the Penal Code, as set out by the Court of Appeal inPublic Prosecutor v LimPoh Lye and another[2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (“LimPoh Lye”) at [17] citingVirsaSingh v State of PunjabAIR 1958 SC 465 (“VirsaSingh”):46Foot Note 46×PCS at para 49 (a) It must be objectively established that a bodily injury is present; (b) The nature of the injury must be proved; (c) There must have been an intention to inflect that particular bodily injury,ie.it must not have been accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended; and (d) The injury inflicted must be sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. 23 With regards to the third element, it is not necessary to show that the accused appreciated the seriousness of the wounds or that it would lead to death (LimPoh Lyeat [18] and [40]); the enquiry necessarily proceeds along broad lines based on common sense (VirsaSinghat [21]); and the Prosecution only has to show that the accused intended the particular but not the precise injury (LimPoh Lyeat [37]).47Foot Note 47×PCS at para 50 24 The Prosecution contended that the only issues in dispute were whether the accused had inflicted the fatal injury (the “actusreus”), and whether he had had the intention to inflict that particular injury (the “mensrea”).48Foot Note 48×PCS at paras 58 to 59It was argued that themensreawould be fulfilled if the Prosecution proves an intent to stab the deceased’s upper arm torso area.49Foot Note 49×PCS at para 52The other elements were not in dispute.50Foot Note 50×PCS at para 58 25 The Prosecution’s case is that both elements were satisfied, relying solely on circumstantial evidence.51Foot Note 51×PCS at para 53Where the prosecution relies solely on circumstantial evidence, the test is that the evidence must inevitably and inexorably lead the court to a single conclusion of the accused’s guilt (Public Prosecutor v Chee CheongHin Constance[2006] 2 SLR(R) 24 at [85]).52Foot Note 52×PCS at para 53This was argued to be met in the present case. 26 The circumstantial evidences relied on for proving bothactusreusandmensreawere largely the same. 27   Firstly, the Prosecution pointed to the accused being the aggressor:53Foot Note 53×PCS at paras 60, 63 to 68the accused was enraged, purchased a knife, promptly returned to Lorong 23 Geylang and had charged first at the deceased, sparking the incident; the accused did not desist his attack, delivering several effective punches even whilst and after the deceased tried to disarm the knife; and the accused suffered little injury from the incident. 28 Second, even though Mr Ang did not witness the causing of the fatal injury, the fatal injury must have had been inflicted by the accused in the earlier part of the fight before Mr Ang came onto the scene:54Foot Note 54×PCS at paras 69 to 72the accused had held the knife firmly in his hand during the earlier part of the fight whilst exchanging blows with the deceased; the entire fight lasted about two minutes but Mr Ang came onto the scene only after about a minute into the fight; when Mr Ang came onto the scene, he observed the deceased’s shirt to be soaked in his own blood such that it appeared red in colour; according to Dr Chui, only the fatal injury would have resulted in torrential bleeding, whereas the only other stab wound through the shirt, namely, the chest wound, had only resulted in slight bleeding; and the CCTV footage, which only caught the lower half of the bodies of the accused and the deceased, showed rapid footwork which made it evident that the parties were trading blows whilst facing each other. 29 Third, the accused admitted to holding the knife tightly in front of his chest, and since the accused and the deceased were around similar height, the position of the knife matched Dr Chui’s evidence as to how the fatal injury could have been caused.55Foot Note 55×PCS at paras 73 and 74 30 Fourth, the Prosecution argued that the fact that multiple stab wounds were inflicted on the deceased’s upper body pointed to the accused’s culpability: aside from the fatal injury, other knife wounds were inflicted on the face, ear, chest, scalp and left upper arm.56Foot Note 56×PCS at paras 75 to 77 31 Finally, the accused had dashed off after the fight, even abandoning the bicycle that he claimed was the purpose of him returning to Lorong 23 Geylang, showing that he was trying to evade the consequences of stabbing the deceased.57Foot Note 57×PCS at paras 78 to 80 32 In response to the Defence, the Prosecution submitted that the accused’s testimony should be rejected, as it was self-serving and devoid of credit; he was evasive, inconsistent, and unbelievable.58Foot Note 58×PCS at paras 82 to 86His claim that he did not know that the deceased suffered various stab wounds was not believable; his explanation that the wounds were accidentally caused were also not believable.59Foot Note 59×PCS at paras 87 to 93The testimony of Xu Aihang who allegedly saw the deceased flipping tables did not assist the accused.60Foot Note 60×PCS at para 94 33 No legal defences were available, particularly sudden fight or private defence.61Foot Note 61×PCS at paras 95 to 97 34 The Prosecution did not submit on sentence.62Foot Note 62×NE 2 March 2020 at p 7",
        "The Defence’s Case": "35 The Defence did not dispute the legal framework provided by the Prosecution.63Foot Note 63×Defence’s Closing Submissions dated 30 January 2020 (“DCS”) at para 20The main submissions were that there was noactusreusandmensrea.64Foot Note 64×DCS at para 15 36 The Defence argued that the accused did not inflict the fatal injury, or alternatively, even if he did, it was unintended.65Foot Note 65×DCS at para 15An alternative factual scenario was raised, that the deceased could have caused the fatal injury by impaling his own arm on the knife while in the midst of the second fight.66Foot Note 66×DCS at para 39 37 The Defence argued that the evidence supported that there was a reasonable doubt that the accused caused the fatal injury. The accused’s evidence that he did not stab the deceased in any manner on purpose was accurate, consistent and credible.67Foot Note 67×DCS at para 41Inspector Lim Boon Wah Daniel (“Insp Daniel”) agreed that the accused’s testimony had been detailed, specific and consistent,68Foot Note 68×DCS at para 80and his memory was sharp.69Foot Note 69×DCS at para 79ASP Thinagaran s/o S. Krishnasamy (“ASP Thinagaran”) had described the accused’s evidence as being matter of fact.70Foot Note 70×DCS at para 90ASP Thinagaran also agreed that the accused was cooperative in investigations, and was forthright in his statements.71Foot Note 71×DCS at paras 99 to 100Both Insp Daniel and ASP Thinagaran also agreed that the accused had never stated that he had stabbed the deceased in the right upper arm.72Foot Note 72×DCS at paras 83, 93 to 95 38 Mr Ang had testified that he had not seen the accused stabbing the deceased, and further, that the deceased had held the knife during the later part of the fight.73Foot Note 73×DCS at para 48Dr Chui had accepted that there was a possibility that the deceased’s arm could have impaled itself on the knife during the fight, causing the fatal injury.74Foot Note 74×DCS at para 39Further, Dr Chui was unable to tell who caused the stab wound, and was not willing to commit himself.75Foot Note 75×DCS at paras 64 and 68 39 The Defence also argued that there was a discrepancy between ASP Thinagaran’s field diary notes and the accused’s first contemporaneous statement.76Foot Note 76×DCS at para 81In the former, ASP Thinagaran recorded that the accused stabbed the deceased in the stomach,77Foot Note 77×Supplementary Bundles of Documents Volume 1 (“1SBD”) at p 44whereas in the latter, the accused merely stated that he did not know how he stabbed the accused.78Foot Note 78×AB at p 240; 40 The Defence argued that the accused was not trying to pick a fight with the deceased. The accused only bought the murder knife for self-protection, and went back to Lorong 23 Geylang to retrieve his bicycle, which had cost him S$192.79Foot Note 79×DCS at paras 143 to 146, 157The bicycle was important to him as he was a rag and bone man with bad legs.80Foot Note 80×DCS at para 155The accused loitered in the shop for some time before purchasing the murder knife, and he also chose to take a longer route back to Lorong 23 Geylang, which showed that the accused wanted to avoid the deceased, and that the knife was indeed for self-protection.81Foot Note 81×DCS at para 150Further, the murder knife was not even removed from its plastic sheath, which would have been done if the accused intended to stab the deceased.82Foot Note 82×DCS at paras 152 to 153 41 There were also some other points raised: the deceased did not mention that the accused stabbed him during his phone call to Yeo after the incident;83Foot Note 83×DCS at para 164the accused was of low IQ;84Foot Note 84×DCS at para 171the deceased was a gambler with bad temper;85Foot Note 85×DCS at para 179the deceased was younger, stronger and more aggressive than the accused;86Foot Note 86×DCS at para 189and the accused fled from the scene not because he had stabbed the deceased, but because he had lost control of the knife, feared for his life and was escaping.87Foot Note 87×DCS at paras 194 to 197 42 In relation to the sentence, the Defence argued that if the accused was convicted under s 300(c), life imprisonment should be awarded instead of the death penalty as there had been no viciousness or blatant disregard for human life; the cause of death was a single stab wound which occurred in the middle of a fight, where the deceased had been the younger and stronger, and had been aggressive.88Foot Note 88×NE 2 March 2020 at pp 3 to 4",
        "The Decision": "",
        "Summary of findings": "43 I concluded from the evidence and submissions that the charge was made out against the accused. The requirements under s 300(c) had been elucidated inLimPoh Lye([22] above).The issues were only theactusreusandmensrea, as the other circumstances had been fulfilled. 44 I took into account that despite the presence of the security cameras and the fight occurring on a street, there was only circumstantial evidence concerning whether the accused did inflict the fatal injury and what his state of mind was. There was no witness in court who could testify to the actual stabbing, nor was there anything else in the evidence that directly implicated the accused. 45 Nonetheless, considering the evidence, theactusreusandmensreawere established beyond reasonable doubt. Aside from the fatal injury, the deceased had suffered multiple other injuries on the head and torso, some of which were clearly not self-inflicted or accidentally inflicted. Further, it was the accused who had sought out the deceased and initiated the incident. In addition, the fatal injury must have had been inflicted during the first part of the second fight when the accused firmly held the knife and when they were trading blows. The cumulative effect of these separate pieces of evidence was that the fatal injury was caused by the accused, and that he did so intentionally. The alternative explanations that the fatal injury was caused by the deceased impaling himself, or that it was caused accidentally by the accused, were of such a remote degree that it could not have been said to raise any reasonable doubt. 46 No legal defences were made out on the facts.",
        "The legal framework": "47 As set out by the Prosecution (above at [22] to [23]), the elements under s 300(c) of the Penal Code were set out by the Court of Appeal inLimPoh Lyeat [17] citingVirsaSingh([22] above):89Foot Note 89×PCS at para 49 (a) It must be objectively established that a bodily injury is present; (b) The nature of the injury must be proved; (c) There must have been an intention to inflect that particular bodily injury,ie.it must not have been accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended; and (d) The injury inflicted must be sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. 48 Although not explicitly mentioned in the above, it is obvious that there is also theactusreusrequirement that the bodily injury must actually be inflicted by the accused, and a causation requirement that the bodily injury was the one that had indeed caused the death (Chan Lie Sian v Public Prosecutor[2019] 2 SLR 439 (“Chan Lie Sian”) at [79] to [81]). Section 300 explains when culpable homicide amounts to murder, and must be read with the culpable homicide provision under s 299 Penal Code which requires the elements ofactusreusand causation.",
        "The issues": "49 The only disputed elements in the present case were theactusreusandmensreaelements (defined above at [24]), namely, whether the accused inflicted the fatal injury, and whether he intended to inflict it. 50 It was not disputed that the V-shaped stab wound was the fatal injury and that it was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death (above at [10]).",
        "The requisite level of particularity": "51 With regards to themensrea, the Prosecution only has to show that the accused caused the particular but not the precise injury (LimPoh Lyeat [37]).90Foot Note 90×PCS at para 50 52 Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan & Chan Wing Cheong,Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore(LexisNexis, 2015, Revised 2nd Ed) (“YMC”) at paras 9.84 to 9.85 suggested that there were two possible interpretations of whatLimPoh Lyemeant, that the injury intended only had to be particular and not precise. First, “particular” could be interpreted to mean something less specific than “precise”, such that the injury intended only had to be in the region of that area, and not the specific area. This interpretation deals with the location of the intended injury, and also its depth. Second, the reference to particularity only meant that the accused did not have to intend the consequences of the injury, but that he must still have had intended the injury to the specific part of the body. This interpretation deals with the harm caused by the intended injury. The Prosecution argued that the first interpretation must be the right one.91Foot Note 91×PCS at para 52 53 I accepted thatLimPoh Lyeintended the first meaning. The location and depth of the injury intended does not have to be overly precise, but merely sufficiently particular. The second meaning seemed to have had read too much into the distinction which did not seem supported by the text of the judgment. In any case, the same result would have had been reached on the facts regardless of which interpretation was adopted. Apart fromLimPoh Lye, the first rule is also supported by policy and precedents. 54 There are two competing interests at play in determining the requisite level of particularity. On one hand, the test cannot be so narrow so as to be impossible to prove. On the other hand, it cannot be too broad such that the accused is convicted of murder for an injury he did not intend. A broad-based, simple and common-sense approach has to be adopted (VirsaSinghat [21]), drawing a middle ground between the competing interests. This has to be a fact specific inquiry, depending on the circumstances of each case. 55 Using the present case as an example, it would defy common sense to expect that the Prosecution prove that the accused intended to stab the right upper arm medially, precisely 9.5cm to 10cm distal to the right axillary floor, to a depth of 7cm.92Foot Note 92×AB at p 81On the other hand, as stated inLimPoh Lyeat [22], it cannot have been “some other kind of injury” that was intended, such as a stab to the right forearm, in the present case. 56 The precedents on s 300(c) show that themensreawill usually be satisfied if the Prosecution proves intention to attack the limb where the injury was found. InLimPoh Lye,mensreawas established by finding that the accused persons intended to stab the deceased’s thigh (at [39]). InChan Lie Sian([48] above),mensreawas establishing by finding that the accused intended to hit the deceased’s head (at [43(a)], [69], [81]). The same was found inPublic Prosecutor vEllarry bin Puling and another[2011] SGHC 214 at [46] to [48]. InWangWenfeng v Public Prosecutor[2012] 4 SLR 590 (“WangWenfeng”),mensreawas made out as there must have been “a firm hand intent on bringing the knife towards [the deceased’s] chest” (at [35]). InPublic Prosecutor v Chia Kee Chen and another appeal[2018] 2 SLR 249 (“Chia Kee Chen”), the issue was pitched as whether there was intention to inflict the fatal craniofacial injuries on the deceased (at [47], [61]). InPublic Prosecutor vBoh Soon Ho[2020] SGHC 58 (“BohSoon Ho”), the court held thatmensreawas satisfied if there was intention to attack “the part of the body where the injury was found” (at [45(c)]). 57 None of these cases required an intention to attack the specific location within the limb, but pegged the level of specificity as just being the limb itself. 58 Turning back to the present case, I found that the Prosecution’s submissions were not clear on what was the necessary level of particularity required. Certain parts of the written closing submissions referred to a required intention to stab the “upper arm torso area”, whereas others referred to a required intention to stab the “right upper arm”. For example, on one hand, it was stated that: “it is sufficient to show that the accused intended to cause the particular injury of a stab wound to [the deceased’s] upper arm torso area… [which] would include the right upper arm area”;93Foot Note 93×PCS at para 52“[i]t does not lie in the mouth of an accused who savagely inflicts numerous stab wounds all over the upper arm torso area of a moving target to then claim that he was not guilty of murder just because he did not intentionally aim for… the right upper arm”;94Foot Note 94×PCS at para 52and “if the accused was targeting the upper arm torso area, he must have intended to stab… the right upper arm”.95Foot Note 95×PCS at para 52These statements pitched the upper arm torso area as the requisite level of particularity. 59 On the other hand, it was later stated that: “[t]he Prosecution relies on circumstantial evidence to prove that the accused intentionally stabbed… the right upper arm”;96Foot Note 96×` PCS at para 53“[i]t is plain that the accused intentionally stabbed… the right upper arm”;97Foot Note 97×PCS at para 60and “[i]t is beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended to stab… [the deceased’s] right upper arm”.98Foot Note 98×PCS at para 108 60 These differing statements reflected conflicting tests as to themensrearequired. The Prosecution seemed to be saying that an intent to stab the upper arm torso area would be sufficient, but at the same time, that this would somehow logically necessarily translate to an intent to stab the right upper arm, and that in any case, there was a specific intent to stab the right upper arm. 61 The Defence argued that there was no specific intent to stab the deceased’s right upper arm, and alternatively, that there was no intent to stab the deceased at all.99Foot Note 99×DCS at paras 198, 203No mention was made about the Prosecution’s arguments regarding the upper arm torso area. 62 As will be seen below, I found that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to stab the deceased’s right upper arm area. Since this narrower test was satisfied, there was no need for me to discuss the broader test pertaining to the upper arm torso area. 63 It was also unclear if the broader test would have been sufficiently particular to meet the requirements of s 300(c). The Prosecution produced no authority to show that s 300(c) had ever been applied in such a broad way.100Foot Note 100×PCS at para 52As shown above at [56], the authorities in general basedmensreaon an intention to strike the particular limb. The Prosecution argued that such a broad test should be allowed in the present case, where the parties were in a fight, and it was difficult for the accused to target only a specific body part.101Foot Note 101×PCS at para 52Nevertheless, I do not propose to deal with the issue, and the appropriateness of such a broad test would have to be considered in another case where the issue is squarely before the court. 64 Themensreatest applied in the present case was the narrower test of whether the accused intended to stab the right upper arm.",
        "Actus Reus and Mens rea": "65 In the present case, theactusreusandmensreawere mainly proven via the same overlapping evidence. 66 The following circumstances, although insufficient when seen individually, taken cumulatively, showed beyond a reasonable doubt theactusreusandmensreathat the accused intended to inflict the fatal injury: (a) When the injury must have been caused; (b) The number, location and type of the injuries; and (c) The conduct of the accused. When the injury must have been caused 67 I found that the fatal injury must have had been caused in the earlier part of the second fight when the accused held the knife and parties were exchanging blows on their feet.102Foot Note 102×PCS at pp 39 to 40 68 The fatal injury must have had been inflicted before Mr Ang came onto the scene. Mr Ang testified that when he came onto the scene, the deceased’s shirt had already been “soaked in blood” such that it appeared to be red in colour.103Foot Note 103×PCS at para 71; NE 6 August 2019 at p 72 at line 7According to Dr Chui, the fatal injury would have caused torrential bleeding;104Foot Note 104×NE 7 August 2019 p 16 at line 16; PCS at para 71in contrast, the only other stab wound through the deceased’s shirt was the wound to the chest,105Foot Note 105×AB at p 81which Dr Chui described as only having caused “slight haemorrhage”, in other words, slight bleeding.106Foot Note 106×The Prosecution used the phrase “slight bleeding” in its closing submissions at para 71; Dr Chui used the phrase “slight haemorrhage” in his report (AB at p 81 at para 8) and the phrase “bleeding” in his EIC (NE 7 August 2019 at p 13 line 4)Hence, the blood that Mr Ang observed must have had been due to the already-inflicted fatal injury. 69 In addition, Mr Ang testified that when he came onto the scene, the accused had already lost control of the knife; he saw that it was the deceased who was holding onto the knife, with the accused holding onto the deceased’s hand which held the knife.107Foot Note 107×NE 6 August 2019 at p 73The knife was held far away relative to the deceased’s body, to the side, about an arm’s length away.108Foot Note 108×NE 6 August 2019 at p 73Although he saw the two struggling on the floor and also standing up to punch each other, he did not see any stabbing or slashing, or the knife being used.109Foot Note 109×NE 6 August 2019 at pp 73 to 74This is consistent with the inference that the fatal injury must have been caused before Mr Ang came onto the scene. This also supports that the other stabbing injuries such as the chest injury and the scalp injuries were also caused before he came onto the scene. 70 Finally, Mr Ang observed that the deceased appeared to be losing and “had no more strength in him” after the struggle.110Foot Note 110×PCS at para 14; AB at pp 49 to 50The accused was delivering more effective punches, even though the deceased was younger and more able-bodied.111Foot Note 111×AB at pp 49 to 51, para 7The weakening of the deceased was likely due to blood loss, and was consistent with Dr Chui’s testimony that the deceased would start feeling dizzy a couple of minutes after sustaining the fatal injury. 71 I hence found that the fatal injury was not caused when the accused and deceased were struggling and rolling on the ground,112Foot Note 112×AB pp 49 to 50 at paras 3 and 7but was caused in the earlier part of the second fight, before they were seen rolling on the ground by Mr Ang. 72 Before Mr Ang came onto the scene, the accused was holding the knife and the parties were exchanging blows on their feet. The CCTV evidence captured the lower body movement of some portion of the first part of the fight, from 7:55:37 am to 7:55:42 am, showing the legs of both parties moving rapidly while they were facing each other, as if in a fight, which made it clear that parties had been exchanging blows with their arms whilst facing each other.113Foot Note 113×PCS at para 72; stitch video at 10:23 to 10:28 of stitch video run time, which correlates to 8:27:37 am to 8:27:42 am of CCTV timeThe accused admitted at trial that there had been an altercation which occurred while they were standing:114Foot Note 114×NE 20 November 2019 at p 12 line 21the deceased attacked him;115Foot Note 115×NE 20 November 2019 at p 12 line 21he had stabbed the deceased in the stomach region (likely the chest wound);116Foot Note 116×NE 20 November 2019 at pp 7 to 22and he had been holding the knife in front of his chest during this starting part of the fight.117Foot Note 117×NE 20 November 2019 at p 20 line 27; PCS at para 74; P483 to 484 (photos of accused holding the knife in court during simulation)The accused testified that this was before the parties began struggling.118Foot Note 118×NE 20 November 2019 at p 20 lines 29 to 30This first part of the exchange must have had been when the fatal injury was caused. 73 Based on the CCTV evidence, the fight started at around 7:55:35 am,119Foot Note 119×PCS at para 70; stitch video at around 10:21 of stitch video run time, 8:27:35 am of CCTV time (the CCTV time was approximately 32 minutes faster than actual time, as can be seen by comparing the CCTV time to the time on Mr Ong’s taxi camera, at footnote 164 below)and lasted until around 7:57:22 am when the accused was captured fleeing the scene.120Foot Note 120×PCS at para 70; stitch video at 11:30 to 11:42 of stitch video run time, which correlates to 7:57:16 am to 7:57:28 am of Mr Ong’s taxi camera timeMr Ang came onto the scene at around 7:56:31 am,121Foot Note 121×PCS at para 71; P332, video titled “22 – 6C Lor 23(Cam1)” at 16:33 run time, corresponding to 8:28:31 CCTV time; NE 6 August 2019 at pp 67 to 68which meant that the fight had already been ongoing for about a minute. This provided ample time for the fatal injury and other injuries to be inflicted. The number, location and type of injuries seen 74 As set out above at [18], the deceased suffered multiple stab injuries, including to his scalp, chest and arm. The number, location, and manner in which the injuries were caused supported that they were intentionally caused by the accused. 75 The injuries were specifically located at vulnerable parts of the deceased’s body. In addition, some non-negligible degree of force had been exerted in causing these injuries, judging from their depth and length. The chest injury was a vertical inward stab that was 7.5cm deep, penetrating the left pectoralis muscle;122Foot Note 122×AB at p 81the fatal injury was also a stab that was about 7cm deep; one scalp stab wound was very long, at 12cm, extending from the top of the scalp down to the left ear; another scalp stab wound had a depth of about 3cm;123Foot Note 123×AB at p 80and a third scalp wound was 0.5cm long.124Foot Note 124×AB at p 80The three scalp wounds did not merely penetrate the skin, but also scratched the hard skull bone, although only superficially, leaving visible marks on the skull.125Foot Note 125×P226 to P230 (autopsy photos)Some of these appeared long, as seen from the autopsy photos.126Foot Note 126×P226 to P230 (autopsy photos) 76 The non-negligible force exerted and location of these injuries supported an inference that they were intentional. If these relatively more forceful stab injuries were caused accidentally or unintentionally, one would have expected them to be spread out all over the body, limbs and legs. Instead, there were mainly only minor abrasions and lacerations to the deceased’s other body parts,127Foot Note 127×AB at pp 80 to 81some of which Dr Chui testified were defensive injuries caused by fending off a bladed weapon, whilst some others were only minor.128Foot Note 128×AB at pp 95 to 96In contrast, the earlier mentioned stab wounds, which were relatively deeper and more serious, were all at the vulnerable regions. 77 Further, it is notable that the medical evidence showed (below at [98]), and the accused also admitted,129Foot Note 129×NE 20 November 2019 at p 17that he did not suffer any knife injuries at all as a result of the fight. This showed that the use of the knife was largely one-sided, with the accused attacking the deceased. Hence, the injuries were more likely to have been caused when the accused had firm control of the knife in the earlier part of the fight, instead of during the struggle, where equal injuries to both parties would have had been more likely. 78 In addition, the sheer number of these injuries supported that they were intentional. The Court of Appeal inWangWenfeng(above at [56]) acknowledged that there was force to the argument that a large number of stab wounds (five in that case) supported that they were more likely to have been intentional (at [34] to [35]). 79 Finally, the manner in which the injuries were caused also supported that they were intentional. Dr Chui’s autopsy report stated that the 12cm long scalp injury extended downwards.130Foot Note 130×AB at p 80He testified that it was likely caused by a vertical stab to the head which then skidded along the side of the skull as it came downwards until the ear.131Foot Note 131×NE 7 August 2019 at p 10Dr Chui testified that two other head injuries were similarly likely to have had been caused by a vertical downward action.132Foot Note 132×AB at p 95In addition, these scalp wounds were located on the upper left side of the head, rather high up, slightly towards the back.133Foot Note 133×P226 to P230The position and manner in which these injuries were caused made it anatomically difficult and highly unlikely for them to have been self-inflicted, or caused accidentally during the rolling around on the ground. It supported the inference that the accused had caused these injuries intentionally. 80 The above showed that accused had been repeatedly attacking the deceased with the knife at vulnerable locations using non-negligible force which led to the inference that as part of the attack, he had also intentionally caused the fatal injury. The conduct of the accused 81 The Defence tried to paint the accused as merely acting in self-defence, buying the knife for protection, and that he merely went back to get his bicycle ([40] above). I found that this was not proven on the facts, and instead agreed with the Prosecution that the evidence showed that the accused was the aggressor and went back to attack the deceased. 82 The accused had been angry with the deceased after the first fight,134Foot Note 134×AB at p 354which had been intense and involved both parties punching each other and also hitting each other with a wooden stick.135Foot Note 135×NE 19 November 2019 at pp 49 to 50The accused eventually ended up at the losing end of the first fight, running away when the deceased attacked him with the wooden stick.136Foot Note 136×NE 19 November 2019 at p 51The accused then went and bought the murder knife and returned to the fight scene, less than 20 minutes after the first fight (above at [6] and [8]). The CCTV evidence showed that when the accused saw the deceased, the accused ran towards the deceased, instead of fleeing from him.137Foot Note 137×PCS at para 60; stitch video at 10:21 to 10:23 of stitch video run time, corresponding to 8:27:35 am to 8:27:37 am of the CCTV timeThese circumstances supported the inference that the accused sought out the deceased to attack him. 83 The accused’s claim that he was only trying to look for his bicycle and wanted the knife merely for protection did not gel with his behaviour: he did not seem to have displayed the caution or wariness one would have expected in the situation from a person who only wanted to get his bicycle, choosing to head directly to the same area, just a few minutes after the first fight, when he could have waited longer before returning; he did not try to scout from afar or peer around corners to see if the deceased was still there; and when he saw the deceased, instead of running away, he rushed headlong into the second fight. The fact that the accused ran towards the deceased also led to the inference that whatever the accused’s earlier intentions may have been, by that point he wanted to cause injury to the deceased. 84 The accused’s conduct as set out here would not, alone, have had proven that the accused caused, and intended to cause, the fatal injury. However, it supported this inference, and had to be seen in totality with the other circumstantial evidences. Cumulative effect 85 The cumulative effect of the separate pieces of evidence mentioned above proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the fatal injury was caused by the accused, and that he did so intentionally. As will be shown below, the alternative explanations that the injury was not caused by the accused, or that they were caused unintentionally, were of such a remote degree that they could not have been said to raise any reasonable doubt.",
        "Defence’s arguments": "Miscellaneous points 86 The various other points raised by the Defence (at [35] to [41] above) also did not assist: although the murder knife was still wrapped in the plastic sheath, it was still used and clearly did not affect its effectiveness as a murder weapon; the accused’s claim to have only seen the deceased at the last minute was irrelevant as the fact was that he still chose to charge towards him instead of running away; the fact that the bicycle was relatively expensive and important to the accused as a rag and bone man may have been one of the tangential reasons why he had gone back, but it did not dispel that the accused had formed the requisite intent to attack the deceased; the accused’s loitering in the shop before buying the murder knife was equivocal and could have been because he was contemplating whether to attack the deceased or not; the fact that the accused took a longer route back was equivocal and not necessarily because he wanted to avoid the deceased; the deceased’s relative youth and strength compared to the accused, bad temper and gambling habits were immaterial to theactusreusandmensrea; the accused’s low IQ was similarly not material to proving these elements – there was nothing in the report which showed that the accused was incapable of forming an intention to stab the deceased;138Foot Note 138×1SBD at pp 18 to 24the deceased’s failure to mention to Yeo that he was stabbed was also equivocal and did not show that he was not stabbed intentionally by the accused; and finally, the Defence had rightly pointed out that the fact that the accused had fled could be explained for other reasons and I had not given much weight to it. Alternative theory 87 The Defence also raised the alternative theory that the deceased had impaled himself on the knife when he threw a punch at the accused.139Foot Note 139×DCS at para 12It was not mentioned whether this punch was supposed to have had occurred when the parties were exchanging blows on their feet, or when they were on the ground struggling. The Defence relied heavily on Dr Chui’s testimony that it was medically possible for the fatal injury to have been caused in this way.140Foot Note 140×DCS at para 39 88 Although medically possible, Dr Chui had emphasised that generalised interpretation of injuries must be exercised with caution, and must be understood in light of the context of the event and relative position of the parties.141Foot Note 141×AB at p 95I found that based on the circumstances, the alternative scenario was too remote of a possibility. 89 As stated above, I had found that the fatal injury had been inflicted before the parties were rolling on the ground (at [71]) above). Hence, any alleged self-impaling could have only happened when the parties were still trading blows. 90 However, for such scenario to happen, the deceased must have had been facing the accused when he had thrown the punch and must have had seen the knife. The knife must have had been around his chest level, outstretched towards him, with the tip facing him. To make out the theory that the deceased impaled himself, without any intended action by the accused, the knife must also have been held in a stationary manner, such that it was not the accused who moved the knife towards the deceased, but only the deceased who moved towards the knife. I found it unthinkable that the deceased would recklessly rush towards the knife and punch the accused, impaling himself on a stationary knife in such manner. Hence, I did not accept this alternative theory. 91 The Defence argued that where two versions of fact are possible, the accused’s version should be preferred.142Foot Note 142×DCS at para 199This was inaccurate as conviction of the accused did not require proof beyond a shadow of a doubt, but merely beyond reasonable doubt (TookLeng How v Public Prosecutor[2006] 2 SLR(R) 70 at [28]); a possibility had to constitute a reasonable doubt before it could displace a conviction. In the present case, I found that the alternative theory was merely a remote possibility, given the strength of the inferences as to theactusreusandmensreashown above, and did not displace the conviction. Accused’s testimony and statements 92 The accused testified at trial that he did not know about the existence of all the stab wounds, including the fatal injury,143Foot Note 143×NE 20 November 2019 at p 18 lines 15, 22; p 19 line 5except for a stabbing wound around the stomach area (possibly the chest wound) which he admitted he may have caused by accident.144Foot Note 144×NE 20 November 2019 at pp 10 to 12The accused denied causing all the other stab wounds. 93 The accused’s testimony at trial largely corresponded with the accused’s statements. In the accused’s contemporaneous statement on 21 July 2016, he stated that he did not know how he stabbed the deceased.145Foot Note 145×AB at p 240In a further statement on 23 July 2016, the only mention the accused made of any stabbing was that: “I think the [deceased] had run into my knife and got stabbed”.146Foot Note 146×AB at p 348In another further statement on 25 July 2016, the accused stated that he was not sure how the deceased suffered the long incised wound on the side of the head, and that he was confused.147Foot Note 147×AB at p 356In relation to the chest injury, the accused said that he could have cut the deceased in the course of the struggle, without any intention to do so.148Foot Note 148×AB at p 357In relation to the fatal injury, the accused said that the deceased could have sustained it during the course of the struggle, but did not admit to inflicting it nor intentionally causing it.149Foot Note 149×AB at p 357 94 The Defence argued that the accused’s testimony and statements had been accurate, consistent and credible (above at [37]).150Foot Note 150×DCS at para 41The Defence referred to Insp Daniel and ASP Thinagaran’s testimony at trial to show that the accused had been consistent, cooperative and matter of fact in his statements (above at [37]). 95 In spite of the above, I did not accept the accused’s testimony. Although the accused’s repeated denials of theactusreusandmensreawere internally consistent and leaned in support of his defence, the credibility of his testimony also had to be evaluated by considering its consistency with the objective evidence, as well as the accused’s demeanour (FaridaBegam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor[2001] 3 SLR(R) 592 at [9]).151Foot Note 151×PCS at para 82 96 I found that the accused’s testimony was outweighed by the objective evidence discussed above, namely: the number, location and manner of the stab wounds; the conduct of the accused; and the timing that the injury would have had been caused. 97 In addition, there were various parts of his testimony that conflicted with the objective evidence, weakening the accused’s credibility as a whole. First, the accused testified that he was in the middle of the road when he saw the deceased and the deceased saw him, that he just stood in the middle of the road, and that it was the deceased who charged towards the accused to attack him.152Foot Note 152×NE 19 November 2019 at p 16However, this conflicted with the CCTV evidence which showed that the accused had ran towards the deceased (above at [82]). 98 Second, the accused testified that after charging at him, the deceased hit him on the head and arm with the wooden stick, causing bleeding in both areas.153Foot Note 153×NE 19 November 2019 at pp 16 and 19However, the medical examination of the accused conducted after his arrest, about 12 days after the fight, showed that he had no obvious fresh physical injury, and that the craniofacial, neurological and cervical spine examination in relation to the described head injury produced no remarkable results.154Foot Note 154×AB at p 103The only injuries found were mild injuries at the right hand dorsum and left hand ulnar.155Foot Note 155×AB at p 103 99 Third, when asked whether he agreed that all the knife injuries were suffered by the deceased (since the accused admitted to suffering no knife injuries), the accused claimed that he had thought the deceased was not injured after the fight.156Foot Note 156×NE 20 November 2019 at p 17This was incredulous as the accused must clearly have had seen the deceased’s shirt being completely soaked red in blood. It also contradicted the accused’s earlier contemporaneous statement where he stated: “I know the deceased bleeding quite badly” [sic].157Foot Note 157×AB at p 241This showed that the accused must have had known of at least some of the stab wounds, despite his denial of knowledge. 100 Fourth, the accused claimed to have only walked away at normal pace after the fight.158Foot Note 158×NE 20 November 2019 at p 9 line 6This contradicted the recording from Mr Ong’s taxi which showed the accused running off,159Foot Note 159×Stitch video at 11:30 to 11:42 stitch video run time, corresponding to the time reflected on Mr Ong’s taxi camera at 7:57:16 am to 7:57:28 amas well as the testimony of Mr Ang who had observed the accused running away.160Foot Note 160×AB at p 49 at para 4 101 Fifth, the accused claimed that when he left the scene after the second fight, the deceased chased him with the knife for about a dozen feet.161Foot Note 161×NE 20 November 2019 at p 38This contradicted the video footage from Mr Ong’s taxi which showed that after the accused fled, the deceased stood unsteadily on the road, trying to pick something from the floor.162Foot Note 162×PCS at para 86; Stitch video at about 11:45 to 11:50 stitch video run time, corresponding to the time reflected on Mr Ong’s taxi camera at 7:57:31 am to 7:57:36 amThis was also showed by the CCTV evidence.163Foot Note 163×Stitch video at about 11:58 to 12:19 stitch video run time, correlating to 8:29:28 am to 8:29:49 am of CCTV time (7:57:37 am of Mr Ong’s taxi camera seemed to correlate to 8:29:37 am of the CCTV time; the latter seemed to have been faster by 32 minutes) 102 These inconsistencies between the accused’s testimony and the objective facts diminished his credibility and affected the weight that could be given to his denial of theactusreusandmensrea. 103 In addition, I found that the evidence of Insp Daniel and ASP Thinagaran did not materially assist the accused. It was clear that they were only testifying as to what was stated to them by the accused, and not as to the truth of whether the accused committed the stabbings. 104 The Defence referred to a discrepancy in the statements (above at [39]): ASP Thinagaran recorded in the field diary that the accused stabbed the deceased in the chest, whereas the accused in the contemporaneous statement merely stated that he did not know how he stabbed the deceased. I found that this was not material as I did not rely on the field diary statement in convicting the accused. 105 For these reasons, the Defence’s arguments did not make out a reasonable doubt.",
        "Possible Defences": "106 The accused did not invoke any legal defences. In any case, I found that the legal defences were not satisfied. 107 The defence of accident under s 80 of the Penal Code was not established as it required the doing of a lawful act with proper care and caution, which was clearly not the case here where the accused charged at the deceased with a knife and stabbed him. 108 Sudden fight under Exception 4 to s 300 of the Penal Code was also excluded because the fight was not sudden in the heat of passion; if there had been an interval between the quarrel and the fight, reason would prevail, and reason would definitely overcome passion and the fight cannot be said to be sudden (YMCat para 30.12). It could not be said that the quarrel escalated into the fight with no opportunity for the parties to regain their composure (YMCat para 30.12): the initial quarrel had taken place already 15 minutes ago; the accused had time to leave the scene and calm down, and even loitered around at the shop deliberating whether to purchase the murder knife (above at [40]); and he chose to buy the murder knife, went back to the scene and charged at the deceased. Hence, the fight could not be said to have had been sudden. Further, there had been undue advantage as was seen from the multiple and severe one-sided injuries inflicted on the deceased, as opposed to the lack of any knife wounds on the accused (above at [74] to [77]) (YMCat para 30.32). 109 Private defence under s 100 of the Penal Code and/or exceeding private defence under Exception 2 to s 300 of the Penal Code were also not established for similar reasons. The defence did not even arise because it was the accused who had been the aggressor, seeking out the deceased with a knife (TanChor Jin v Public Prosecutor[2008] 4 SLR(R) 306 at [46(c)]). The accused did not prove that the deceased had assaulted him, reasonably causing apprehension of grievous harm (s 100(b) Penal Code). The one-sided injuries showed that the harm inflicted had been unnecessary, and since I had found that these were intended, the accused had intended more harm than necessary.",
        "Conviction": "110 Considering all of the evidence, I was satisfied that the charge under s 300(c) of the Penal Code was made out beyond a reasonable doubt.",
        "Sentence": "111 The accused hence had to be punished under s 302(2) Penal Code, with either death or life imprisonment, being liable to caning if the latter was imposed. The Defence argued in favour of life imprisonment whereas the Prosecution did not submit on sentence.",
        "The Law": "112 The framework for the exercise of sentencing discretion under s 302(2) Penal Code has been set out by a line of Court of Appeal authorities. In essence, the death penalty is warranted where the actions of the offender outrage the feelings of the community, such as by exhibiting viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life (Chan Lie Sian(above at [48]) at [84];Public Prosecutorv Kho Jabing[2015] 2 SLR 112 (“KhoJabing”) at [44]–[45];MichealAnak Garing v Public Prosecutor[2017] 1 SLR 748 at [47]; andChia Kee Chen(above at [56]) at [110]). 113 It is the manner in which the offender acted which takes centre stage; relevant considerations include the number of stabs or blows inflicted, the area of injury, the duration of the attack, the force used, the mental state of the offender, and the offender’s actual role or participation in the attack (Chan Lie Sianat [85];KhoJabingat [45];Chia Kee Chenat [110]).",
        "Submissions": "114 The Defence argued that the accused did not manifest a blatant disregard of human life, nor was he so vicious so as to outrage the feelings of the community.164Foot Note 164×NE 2 March 2020 at p 6 lines 12 to 14The fatal injury was a single stab wound inflicted in the course of the fight, which pitted the accused against a younger, stronger and more aggressive opponent.165Foot Note 165×NE 2 March 2020 at p 3The accused did not know that the injury was fatal.166Foot Note 166×NE 2 March 2020 at p 4 lines 13 to 15The gruesomeness of the scene should not affect the outcome.167Foot Note 167×NE 2 March 2020 at p 4 115 The accused was 64 years old at the time of the incident; 67 at the point of sentencing.168Foot Note 168×NE 2 March 2020 at p 5He had a number of ailments;169Foot Note 169×NE 2 March 2020 at p 5he was of low IQ, with slow processing of information.170Foot Note 170×NE 2 March 2020 at p 6It was highlighted that the Prosecution was not seeking the death sentence.171Foot Note 171×NE 2 March 2020 at p 6",
        "Decision and Analysis": "116 I accepted the arguments of the Defence. The death penalty was not called for in the circumstances here. 117 The Prosecution bears the burden of proving that the actions of the accused outraged the feelings of the community (Chan Lie Sianat [93]), and this was not done, as the Prosecution did not make submissions. 118 In any case, the factors weighed against the death penalty. 119 First, I accepted the Defence’s contention that the accused did not know that the injury was fatal, either during the time of attack or after the attack (above at [92]). This supported that there was no blatant disregard for human life (Chan Lie Sianat [88]). 120 Second, in contrast to cases such asChia Kee Chen([56] above) andKhoJabing([112] above) where the death penalty was awarded, it was not proven in the present case that the accused had any intention to want the victim to suffer as much as possible, or that the accused inflicted completely unnecessary additional blows even after the accused stopped reacting (seeChan Lie Sianat [91]). Here, the accused and deceased were fighting, and the stabs were inflicted whilst the deceased was still alive and retaliating. The fight lasted only about two minutes, which was even shorter than the 15 minutes inChan Lie Sian, which the court had implied to be relatively short (at [90]). Further, as testified by Mr Ang, a good part of the fight involved struggling on the ground and exchanging of blows (above at [69] to [72]). The duration of the one-sided stabbing must not have lasted more than a minute. 121 Third, in contrast toChia Kee Chen, the present case lacked the high degree of premeditation and planning, which was a factor supporting the death penalty in that case (at [139]). 122 Fourth, the level of viciousness in the present case, whilst certainly very reprehensible, was not of such degree so as to outrage the feelings of the community. As a reference point, the viciousness in the present case paled in comparison toChia Kee Chen. In that case, the Court of Appeal found that the “viciousness of the attack cannot be denied”, based on the following evidence (at [140]): Bloodstains were found on the ground near the Deceased’s car, on its windows as well as on the ceiling of the car park above the car... Bloodstains were also found on the ceiling, rear door and both side walls of the cabin of the van; further, a wooden floorboard that was originally in the cabin of the van was stained with blood... This showed that a violent assault against the Deceased had already commenced in the car park where he was abducted, and continued in the cabin of the van. The various blunt force blows were directed at the Deceased’s face, a vulnerable part of his body. As a result of the assault, the Deceased suffered extensive fractures in his skull: almost every bone from the bottom of his eye socket to his lower jaw was fractured... 123 There, the accused and two accomplices had ambushed the deceased the moment he exited his car at the carpark, assaulted him, dragged him into their van, tied his hands and legs with nylon rope, and began smashing his head, face and body with a hammer-like object, causing the above mentioned injuries and blood stains (at [16], [17], [51], [58]). 124 WhilstChia Kee Chenshould not be seen as setting a low watermark for the requisite level of viciousness, it assisted the accused that the viciousness in the present case was substantially milder. 125 Finally, the Defence rightly pointed out that the court should not be distracted by the gruesomeness of the scene (Chan Lie Sianat [93]). 126 The above factors seen in totality supported that the death penalty should not be imposed. It was sufficient and proportionate to the accused’s culpability to impose a sentence of life imprisonment, with effect from 21 July 2016, the date of first remand. No caning could be imposed because of the accused’s age.",
        "Conclusion": "127 For the reasons above, the accused was convicted and sentenced accordingly. Aedit AbdullahJudge Eugene Lee Yee Leng, Claire Poh Hui Jing and Senthilkumaran Sabapathy (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the prosecution; Wong Seow Pin (S P Wong & Co) and Wong Li-Yen Dew (Dew Chambers) for the accused."
