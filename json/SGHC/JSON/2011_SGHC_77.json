        "Official communications privilege": "4       Section 126(1) of the Evidence Act provides\n                    that: Official communications 126. —(1) No public officer shall be\n                        compelled to disclose communications made to him in official confidence when\n                        he considers that the public interest would suffer by the disclosure. 5       The Court of Appeal has held inZainal bin Kuning v Chan Sin Mian[1996]\n                    2 SLR(R) 858 at [32] that, when the s 126(1) official\n                    communications privilege is asserted, “it is for the court to decide\n                    whether the communication in question was made to the public officer in official\n                    confidence and it is for the officer concerned to decide whether public\n                    interests would suffer by the disclosure of the communication”. On the\n                    facts, the Court of Appeal accepted that the relevant documents were\n                    communicated in official confidence and held that thebona\n                        fidedetermination of the relevant officers that the public\n                    interest would suffer by their disclosure was sufficient to establish the\n                    privilege. 6       In the present case, Mr Goh Chin Keong, a\n                    senior assistant director of investigations in the Workplace Health and Safety\n                    Inspectorate, deposed in support of the Ministry’s assertion of the\n                    official communications privilege in relation to the MATCOR report, that: The MATCOR report was commissioned by the Occupational Safety & Health\n                        Inspectorate, MOM, so that its Investigating Officers can benefit from the\n                        expert advice concerning the cause of the accident and decide where the\n                        criminal liability for the accident lay. The MATCOR report forms part of the\n                        Investigation Papers, and the MATCOR report was furnished to MOM in official\n                        confidence. The MATCOR report is not intended to facilitate the gathering\n                        and collation of evidence for the benefit of private litigants in the\n                        pursuit of their private interests. There is a broad public interest in facilitating investigations and having\n                        the swift apprehension and punishment of offenders for worksite accidents,\n                        in order to maintain public safety. Furthering this public interest requires\n                        MATCOR to be forthcoming and candid in its report to the Occupational Safety\n                        & Health Inspectorate, MOM. The MATCOR report includes the opinions and\n                        comments of the expert which are confidential in nature and made to assist\n                        public officers in determining the causal and liability issues for the\n                        worksite accident for the purposes of criminal investigations. The 1stDefendant [iethe applicant] was the occupier of the premises when the\n                        accident happened, making it a potential accused person. The\n                            2ndand 3rdDefendants, who are the suppliers of the crane and steel wire rope\n                        respectively, are also potential accused persons. Disclosure of the MATCOR\n                        report is against the public interest as it breaches the confidentiality of\n                        the MATCOR report which forms part of the Investigation Papers. For the\n                        above reasons, I strongly believe that the public interest would suffer if\n                        the MATCOR report commissioned by and furnished to the Occupational Safety\n                        & Health Inspectorate, MOM, were to be disclosed in the present\n                        matter. 7       Counsel for the applicant did not dispute that\n                    the MATCOR report was made in official confidence. Instead, he argued that\n                    public interest against disclosure, as stated by Mr Goh, was outweighed by\n                    the public interest in the administration of justice, which militates in favour\n                    of disclosure. In support of his argument, counsel referred to the decision of\n                    the district court inRe E (guardianship of an\n                        infant)[2003] SGDC 84. 8       Now, I accept that, under s 126(1), the\n                    relevant public officer does not have an unfettered discretion to determine that\n                    the public interest would suffer by the disclosure of the relevant\n                    communications. As the Court of Appeal held inChng Suan Tze\n                        v Minister for Home Affairs[1988] 2 SLR(R) 525 at\n                    [86], “the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to\n                    the rule of law. All power has legal limits and the rule of law demands that the\n                    courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power.”\n                    Similarly, the Court of Appeal inZainal bin Kuning v Chan\n                        Sin Mian(supra[5]) was careful to state that the\n                    determinations of public interest in that case were madebona\n                        fide. More generally, I would say that the court can review the\n                    legality of a determination of public interest under s 126(1) on the usual\n                    grounds known to administrative law. Certiorari will not issue if the\n                    proceedings were not made under Order 53 of the Rules of Court\n                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed), but the court can nevertheless\n                    disregard an illegal assertion of public interest. 9       But the argument made by counsel for the\n                    applicant does not go towards the legality of Mr Goh’s determination.\n                    It goes towards the merits of Mr Goh’s determination, which are\n                    within Mr Goh’s discretion. Therefore, unless Mr Goh’s\n                    determination was irrational in theWednesburysense, and this is hardly the case, I cannot review the same, but must instead\n                    accept it for the purposes of s 126(1). 10     I do not think thatRe\n                        E(supra[7]) assists the applicant. In that case, the\n                    learned district judge applied the common law balancing test in deciding whether\n                    or not to compel Singapore Immigration and Registration to give discovery and\n                    answer interrogatories, and concluded that the public interest in maintaining\n                    the confidentiality of information pertaining to national defence and internal\n                    security outweighed the public interest of the administration of justice in the\n                    disclosure of evidence. Unlike in this case, the s 126(1) privilege was not\n                    asserted. This is critical, because the s 126(1) privilege does not, as\n                    shown above, depend on a balancing test by the court, but on the determination\n                    of the relevant public officer. SoRe Eis wholly\n                    distinguishable. Also, I should add, with great respect, that the balancing test\n                    applied inRe Eappears to be inconsistent with\n                    the s 126(1) privilege and may, to the extent of the inconsistency, have\n                    been repealed by virtue of s 2(2) of the Evidence Act. 11     I initially had some doubts as to whether\n                    Mr Goh was the correct officer to make the determination that the public\n                    interest would suffer by the disclosure of the MATCOR report. Under\n                    s 126(1), the officer who makes the determination must be the officer to\n                    whom the relevant communication was made. There was nothing in his affidavit to\n                    show that the MATCOR report was made to Mr Goh. However, counsel for the\n                    Attorney-General pointed out that the MATCOR report was commissioned by the\n                    Workplace Health and Safety Inspectorate and made to it, and argued therefore\n                    that Mr Goh, as a senior assistant director of the Inspectorate, was a\n                    proper officer under s 126(1). I accept this argument. A communication can\n                    be made to a group of officers or a single officer. In the case of the former,\n                    any officer in the group with the necessary authority can make the relevant\n                    determination under s 126(1). 12     I therefore hold that the s 126(1)\n                    official communications privilege was validly asserted over the MATCOR\n                    report.",
        "Litigation privilege": "13     Litigation privilege was examined by the Court\n                    of Appeal inSkandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ),\n                        Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd[2007] 2 SLR(R) 367. The Court of Appeal held (at [67]) that\n                    litigation privilege at common law was envisaged by s 131 of the Evidence\n                    Act, and not inconsistent with ss 128 and 131 of the same Act read together. It\n                    also set out the two elements of litigation privilege. First, there must be a\n                    reasonable prospect of litigation. Secondly, the legal advice must be taken for\n                    the dominant purpose of anticipated or contemplated litigation. 14     If I may say so respectfully, the Court of\n                    Appeal was right to specify in that litigation privilege in our law is based on\n                    ss 128 and 131 of the Evidence Act, for otherwise the privilege would be\n                    inconsistent with the Evidence Act, under which evidence is admissible if\n                    relevant, unless specifically excepted:Law Society of\n                        Singapore v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis[2008]\n                    2 SLR(R) 239. 15     On the facts, Mr Goh deposed that: I verily believe that the MATCOR report is privileged from disclosure as\n                        it is protected by litigation privilege. As the\n                            1st, 2ndand\n                            3rdDefendants are potential accused persons,\n                        the Occupational Safety & Health Inspectorate commissioned MATCOR\n                        Technology & Services Pte Ltd to prepare the MATCOR report in reasonable\n                        contemplation of criminal proceedings. 16     I have considerable difficulty in seeing how\n                    ss 128 and 131, which form the basis of litigation privilege in our law,\n                    would apply to the MATCOR report. Now, ss 128 and 131 provide as\n                    follows: Professional communications 128. —(1) No advocate or solicitor\n                        shall at any time be permitted, unless with his client’s express\n                        consent, to disclose any communication made to him in the course and for the\n                        purpose of his employment as such advocate or solicitor by or on behalf of\n                        his client, or to state the contents or condition of any document with which\n                        he has become acquainted in the course and for the purpose of his\n                        professional employment, or to disclose any advice given by him to his\n                        client in the course and for the purpose of such employment. Confidential communications with legal\n                            advisers 131. No one shall be compelled to disclose\n                        to the court any confidential communication which has taken place between\n                        him and his legal professional adviser unless he offers himself as a\n                        witness, in which case he may be compelled to disclose any such\n                        communications as may appear to the court necessary to be known in order to\n                        explain any evidence which he has given, but no others. MATCOR is certainly not an advocate or a solicitor for the purposes of\n                    s 128, or, unless the term is stretched beyond recognition, a legal\n                    professional adviser for the purposes of s 131. Can the two sections be\n                    extended beyond their language? I rather doubt so, given the scheme of the\n                    Evidence Act, where evidence is admissible if relevant, unless specifically\n                    excepted. At any rate, a full analysis would be rather involved and quite\n                    unnecessary on the facts, given my finding that the s 126(1) privilege\n                    applies to the MATCOR report. 17     I also have considerable difficulty with the\n                    proposition, advanced by counsel for the Attorney-General, that litigation\n                    privilege, as it is understood in civil proceedings, applies in exactly the same\n                    way to criminal proceedings, for which the MATCOR report was commissioned. If\n                    this is right then all material made in the course of criminal investigation\n                    would be caught by the privilege. This is a very broad proposition, and not\n                    supported by precedent or practice. Now, it can be argued that litigation\n                    privilege in civil law applies to the discovery of investigative material in\n                    civil proceedings but not the disclosure of the same investigative material in\n                    criminal proceedings, which would be governed by the rules of criminal\n                    procedure. But this would raise larger issues about the nature and scope of\n                    litigation privilege and, once again, a full analysis would be rather involved\n                    and quite unnecessary. 18     I therefore express no concluded opinion on\n                    litigation privilege.",
        "Conclusion": "19     I therefore dismiss the application on the\n                    ground that Mr Goh had validly asserted the official communications\n                    privilege in s 126(1) of the Evidence Act in respect of the MATCOR\n                    report. 20     Counsel agreed that the Attorney-General was\n                    entitled to costs regardless of the outcome. I so order, and fix costs at\n                    $1,200, including disbursements."
