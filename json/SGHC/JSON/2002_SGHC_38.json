        "The Defendant’s affidavit of 18 October 2001": "13. The Defendant was born in Surabaya, Indonesia, on 13 April 1975.\n\nThe Plaintiff is about 80 years old. She first met the Plaintiff, one of the richest men\n\nin Indonesia, in Jakarta in March 1992 when she was about 17 years old. She had gone to\n\nJakarta, after completing High School, with an aunt to visit her cousin who was then also\n\na \"companion\" of the Plaintiff and being maintained by him in a house bought by\n\nhim for her. The aunt was the mother of the said cousin.14. Initially, the Plaintiff did not know the Defendant was staying in\n\nthe cousin’s house as she would stay out of sight upstairs. In May or June 1992, his\n\nbody guards informed him of her presence. She was then introduced to the Plaintiff who\n\ninvited here to lunch but she declined. One or two weeks later, she returned to Surabaya.15. She passed her High School examinations and wanted to study\n\neconomics at tertiary level but could not afford to do so.16. In February 1993, she met the Plaintiff again when he went to\n\nSurabaya with the cousin during Chinese New Year. The Plaintiff told the Defendant that if\n\nshe needed a job after graduation from university, she could approach him for help.17. In 1994, the Defendant went to work in a factory in Taiwan for\n\nabout half a year. In 1995, she decided to study Economic Management in Universitas Putra\n\nBangsa. She worked during the day and attended lectures in the evening.18. In December 1996, she gave up her studies and moved to Semarang to\n\nlive with her brother. She worked as a bank teller from February to June 1997.19. When she became jobless and had no one to turn to for support, she\n\ndecided to contact the Plaintiff. He invited her to Jakarta and she went there with a very\n\nclose friend, Magdalena Kurniawati Limanto, in August 1997. She regarded Magdalena as her\n\nsister. They stayed in a hotel arranged by the Plaintiff. The costs of the trip by air and\n\nthe hotel charges were borne by the Plaintiff.20. The Plaintiff visited them and told the Defendant that he had\n\nseparated from her cousin. She was to learn from him subsequently that he had wanted to\n\nsell the house which was in her cousin’s name but she was unwilling to do so.\n\nSubsequently, her cousin sold the house without the Plaintiff’s knowledge, kept the\n\nproceeds of sale and moved back to Surabaya.21. The Plaintiff then informed the Defendant that he had feelings for\n\nher since their first meeting in 1992. He told her that he would take care of her and her\n\nfamily if she would \"marry\" him. He would buy her a house and take care of all\n\nher material needs for the rest of her life.22. On 7 September 1997, they \"married\" in a hotel in\n\nJakarta. The Defendant stayed in hotels and the Plaintiff visited her from time to time.\n\nHe told her he was looking for a suitable house to buy for her. About 2 months later, the\n\nPlaintiff arranged for her to move into a house owned by his company and provided a\n\ncompany car for her use. He forbade her from working, saying he wanted her to concentrate\n\non looking after him.23. When the riots broke out in Jakarta in May 1998, the Plaintiff was\n\nout of Indonesia. He did not return home but came to Singapore instead. He arranged for\n\nthe Defendant to move to Surabaya for a few days and then to Singapore where she stayed in\n\nthe Apollo Hotel. The Plaintiff stayed with his family in the Cluny Road bungalow. He\n\nwould visit her and spent time with her in the hotel room from time to time.24. After a couple of weeks, the Defendant returned to Jakarta as\n\ninstructed by the Plaintiff who remained in Singapore.25. In June or July 1998, the Plaintiff told her that as the situation\n\nin Jakarta was volatile, it was best for her if he bought a property for her in Singapore\n\nwhere she would live in comfort and safety. He asked her to look for a freehold property\n\nin Districts 9, 10 or 11.26. The Defendant, her sister and her brother then came to Singapore\n\nfor this purpose. They stayed in the Apollo Hotel and were introduced by the duty manager\n\nto an estate agent (who is the wife of Mr Ganesh and who introduced the Defendant to his\n\nlaw firm). After viewing several properties, they were brought to Signature Park where 2\n\nunits were for sale. After negotiations, she agreed to purchase the unit in issue for\n\n$700,000/-. The Plaintiff was informed by telephone. The property was purchased in the\n\nDefendant’s name as requested by the Plaintiff who paid the purchase price.27. At the Plaintiff’s request, the Defendant returned to Jakarta\n\non 10 September 1998 and proceeded to buy furniture and other accessories for the\n\nSignature Park property. These were then shipped to Singapore in a container. She also\n\npurchased other items in Singapore for the property. All these were given to her by the\n\nPlaintiff for her use.28. In October 1998, the Defendant and her \"sister\",\n\nMagdalena, moved into the said property. The Plaintiff would visit and spend time with the\n\nDefendant from time to time. He told her that he wanted her to execute a document to\n\nexplain how she came to own the property and that such a document was necessary for her\n\nprotection because the Singapore Government might want to investigate how she was able to\n\nmake the purchase. Having no knowledge of Singapore law and having absolute trust in the\n\nPlaintiff, with whom she was having a very good relationship, she agreed to execute such a\n\ndocument.29. The contents of the document were dictated by the Plaintiff to\n\nMagdalena in the Indonesian language. He then instructed Magdalena to bring the draft to\n\nMr Ganesh and to instruct him to prepare the document in English. When that had been done,\n\nthe Plaintiff dictated some amendments thereto to Magdalena who wrote them out in the\n\nIndonesian language on the draft. The amended draft was then faxed by the Defendant to the\n\nlawyer on 14 October 1998.30. The Defendant, accompanied by Magdalena, then went to the\n\nlawyers’s office to sign the document. Mr Ganesh explained the contents to her but\n\nalso said at the same time that the Plaintiff had informed him that the purpose for the\n\npreparation of the document was to enable the Defendant to explain to the Singapore\n\nGovernment or authorities how she was able to acquire the property in case inquiries were\n\nmade. Since this was the same reason mentioned by the Plaintiff, the Defendant signed the\n\ndocument. The document was signed by the Plaintiff in the Signature Park property after it\n\nwas interpreted to him by Magdelena.31. The Defendant resumed her studies while in Singapore. She took an\n\nEnglish course at Inlingua for about 3 months and also studied English at the British\n\nCouncil for about 1 month. Magdalena also took up courses here. All the expenses of the\n\nDefendant were paid for by the Plaintiff who also bought her a new BMW 520i.32. Around March 1999, the Plaintiff told the Defendant he wished to\n\nacquire some more properties in Singapore. He wanted to buy another property for her so\n\nthat she could live in one and earn rental income from the other and thus would have no\n\nfinancial worries for the rest of her life. They were very much in love then and the\n\nDefendant cried because she was deeply moved by the Plaintiff’s feelings and concern\n\nfor her. The Plaintiff then bought for her a property at 28 Scotts Road #03-04\n\n(\"Scotts 28\") again funding the entire purchase.33. Shortly thereafter, the Plaintiff told the Defendant that he would\n\nlike her to sign the same kind of document for Scotts 28 that she did for the Signature\n\nPark property, repeating the reason for the need to do that. Similarly, ignorant of the\n\nlaw here and trusting the Plaintiff completely, the Defendant was prepared to sign the\n\ndocument requested by the Plaintiff.34. Soon thereafter, the Plaintiff stunned the Defendant one day by\n\nconfessing to her that he had developed feelings for her \"sister\", Magdelena,\n\nand wanted her to be another of his \"wives\". The Defendant was deeply hurt but\n\nsaid nothing to him. The Plaintiff pestered her to persuade Magdelena to be his\n\n\"wife\". The Defendant told Magdelena about this and she was shocked. She\n\ndeclined the proposal and told the Plaintiff so.35. Thereafter, the Plaintiff’s attitude and feelings towards the\n\nDefendant changed. He became very insistent that the Defendant sign the aforesaid document\n\nin respect of Scotts 28 and the Defendant began to be suspicious about his true intentions\n\ntowards her. She therefore kept delaying the execution of the document with excuses. That\n\nled to quarrels. The Defendant kept reminding the Plaintiff of his earlier assurances to\n\nher that both the properties were hers.36. Around May 2000, the Plaintiff told the Defendant that they should\n\nmove back to Jakarta where he had prepared a house owned by one of his companies for her.\n\nHe therefore wanted her to execute a power of attorney for him to sell the 2 properties in\n\nSingapore, claiming that he had lost the document of 7 October 1998. By this time, she was\n\nsure that the Plaintiff was trying to get rid of her and she refused to execute any such\n\ndocument, leading to frequent quarrels. During the quarrels, he also said he wanted to\n\nsell the 2 properties as he was in financial difficulties. It became obvious to the\n\nDefendant that the Plaintiff was angry that Magdalena had rejected his advances and wanted\n\nto vent his anger on the Defendant because she kept refusing to persuade Magdalena to be\n\nhis \"wife\".37. In order to escape the frequent quarrels, the Defendant and\n\nMagdelena left Singapore on 28 November 2000 and had no further contact with the\n\nPlaintiff.38. The Defendant maintained that there was never any loan given by the\n\nPlaintiff to her as she was clearly in no position to repay any loan of such a substantial\n\namount. She maintained that the Signature Park property was a gift to her. The title deeds\n\nwere in her possession all this time.39. The Defendant claimed she had been misled about the contents and\n\nthe effects of the Acknowledgement of Debt document of 7 October 1998 which was never\n\nintended to be a binding loan document. This was further buttressed by the fact that the\n\nPlaintiff had requested her to execute a power of attorney in his favour in November 2000\n\nto enable him to sell the Signature Park property. There would be no need for a power of\n\nattorney if the document of 7 October 1998 was intended to be valid and enforceable. She\n\nalso had a counterclaim against the Plaintiff for damages for conversion as he had removed\n\nall her movable properties in the Signature Park property.",
        "Magdalena’s affidavit of 18 October 2001": "40. Magdalena stated that she met the Defendant in High School in 1989\n\nand became so close to her that each regarded the other as a sister. She went with the\n\nDefendant to meet the Plaintiff in August 1997 as she also intended to seek his help in\n\ngetting a job. On the second day of their stay in Jakarta, the Plaintiff gave her some\n\nmoney and asked her to go shopping as he had something to discuss in private with the\n\nDefendant. When she returned to the hotel, she was told by them that they were getting\n\n\"married\".41. She confirmed that the Plaintiff had told the Defendant that he was\n\nlooking for a house in Jakarta to purchase for her. When they moved into the house owned\n\nby the Plaintiff’s company, the Plaintiff forbade the Defendant to work and told\n\nMagdalena not to work as well so that she could keep the Defendant company. Both of them\n\nhad to massage the Plaintiff daily. The Plaintiff gave Magdalena some money monthly for\n\nher expenses.42. In Singapore, Magdalena was with the Defendant at all material\n\ntimes save for the moments of intimacy between the Plaintiff and the Defendant in their\n\nbedroom. She was therefore able to confirm what the Defendant said in her affidavit.43. As for the Plaintiff’s proposal to her, she was shocked as she\n\nhad always regarded him as her brother-in-law. She did not give him an answer immediately\n\nas she wanted to figure out a way of telling him without hurting his feelings. The\n\nPlaintiff subsequently asked her in front of the Defendant whether she would\n\n\"marry\" him, offering her a condominium unit in Gardenville at 10 Walshe Road.\n\nShe requested the Defendant to leave them alone and then told the Plaintiff that she could\n\nnot \"marry\" him. He became very angry, telling her that he had never been\n\nrejected by anyone. He also became angry with the Defendant because he felt the Defendant\n\nshould have persuaded Magdalena to \"marry\" him. His attitude towards them\n\nchanged and he started pestering the Defendant to sell the Scotts 28 property.44. They had no hint at all that the Plaintiff was contemplating legal\n\naction against the Defendant. Magdalena tried her best to patch things up between the\n\ncouple but failed as the Plaintiff was adamant about selling both properties and was\n\ninsistent about the Defendant having to sign certain documents that he had instructed Mr\n\nGanesh to prepare. The Defendant had no knowledge what those documents were although the\n\nPlaintiff did tell her that one of them was a power of attorney. She knew that the\n\nDefendant was not prepared to sign anything. She had no doubt that the 2 properties were\n\ngifts by the Plaintiff to the Defendant as they had a very loving relationship at the\n\nmaterial time until Magdalena’s rejection of his proposal.",
        "Plaintiff’s affidavit of 23 November 2001": "45. The Plaintiff in response stated that he acceded to the\n\nDefendant’s request to let Magdalena live with her as they were very close to each\n\nother and the Defendant was afraid to live alone.46. Although he paid for the two properties and the furnishings, he\n\nnever told the Defendant that they were gifts to her. There was no reason to buy them as\n\ngifts as he had already purchased a house for the Defendant in her hometown of Surabaya in\n\nJanuary 1998. In early 2000, he arranged for the property to be completely rebuilt for her\n\nas a permanent home and the house was ready in October 2000.47. He had always intended to set up home for the Defendant in\n\nIndonesia. She is an Indonesian Citizen. He spent much of his time in Indonesia and it\n\nwould be convenient for him to visit her there. Her study visa was temporary. The purchase\n\nof the two properties in Singapore during the downturn was for his investment purposes\n\nand, at the same time, would provide the Defendant with accommodation here. It was\n\nludicrous that he would give the Defendant the two properties worth more than S$3million\n\nwhen she was unable to live in Singapore permanently to enjoy them. It would make far\n\nbetter sense if he were to give her cash instead.48. The Scotts 28 property is the subject of a separate legal action.\n\nAt the time it was being purchased in 1999, the Plaintiff had serious health problems and\n\nwas hospitalized on many occasions. The Defendant sought to take advantage of his poor\n\nhealth and advanced years and tried to take away the Scotts 28 property from him. That was\n\nthe cause for the unhappiness in the middle of 2000 when he found out and not any alleged\n\nspurning by Magdalena in whom he had no romantic interest and who was married to the\n\nDefendant’s brother.49. The Defendant had failed to arrange the documentation instructed by\n\nthe Plaintiff in respect of Scotts 28. Further, when the Plaintiff wanted to sell it, she\n\ntold him that it was tenanted, she had taken 2 years of rent in advance which was placed\n\nin fixed deposit and she wanted to use the interest as additional living expenses\n\nespecially during the periods of his prolonged absence. Scotts 28 was never rented out.\n\nShe had sold the BMW 520i within a year without telling him. She lied that the courses she\n\nhad enrolled in were for much longer periods and took money from him to pay for them.50. The Defendant was now more interested in enriching herself at the\n\nPlaintiff’s expense and that was why she and Magdalena were making the allegations\n\ncontained in their affidavits.",
        "The Decision of the Court": "51. The Defendant contended that Mr Ganesh had said that the \"sole\n\npurpose\" of the Acknowledgement of Debt document of 7 October 1998 was to show the\n\nsource of the Defendant’s funds. Since that was the \"sole purpose\" for the\n\nDefendant to sign the document, it did not matter anymore what other words were in the\n\ndocument although those other words were explained by the lawyer. It was further argued\n\nthat if the Plaintiff had an unexpressed purpose in mind, then he had deceived the lawyer.52. The Defendant relied on the decision of the Privy Council inTyagaraja\n\nMudaliar & Another v. Vedathanni[1936] MLJ Rep. 62, an appeal from India. There,\n\na document only intended to create evidence of the undivided status of a Hindu family\n\nincluded an agreement that the widow signing the document relinquish her claims for\n\nmaintenance. When the widow sought to recover arrears of maintenance, it was held that\n\noral evidence in disproof of the alleged agreement, that the document was never intended\n\nto operate as a agreement but was brought into existence solely for the purpose of\n\ncreating evidence of some other matter, stood exactly on the same footing as evidence that\n\na signature was forged. Such oral evidence could therefore be adduced.53. The Defendant submitted that it was a question of fact what exactly\n\nthe document of 7 October 1998 was meant to be. The Plaintiff had not denied the purpose\n\nwas as indicated by the lawyer. His solicitors had asked Mr Ganesh whether that was one of\n\nthe purposes but Mr Ganesh replied otherwise. The Defendant was not told that the other\n\nprovisions in that document were to make it an enforceable loan agreement.54. It should be noted that the widow in that case had refused to sign\n\nthe document when it was presented to her 3 days after her husband’s death. She was\n\ninduced to do so 2 days later by representations that it would not be acted on and that\n\nits only purpose was to provide evidence of the undivided status of the family. The\n\nDefendant in our case was under no pressure of any sort, emotional or otherwise. Indeed,\n\nshe said that the relationship between her and the Plaintiff then was a very loving one.\n\nThere was not even any evidence that the document had to be signed in a great hurry.55. There was no doubt that Mr Ganesh did tell her what the Plaintiff\n\nsaid the purpose of the document was. The lawyer certainly did not tell her that that was\n\nthe sole or only purpose or that the other clauses were thrown in as decoys and were not\n\nmeant to be acted upon. The stated purpose was true in any event and was achieved –\n\nthe document did show that the money came from the Plaintiff as a loan and not as a gift\n\nand the other provisions reinforced that fact rather than detracted from it to any extent.56. What was so sinister about this purchase anyway? It was not as if\n\nthe Plaintiff was not entitled under Singapore law to make the purchase and was using the\n\nDefendant as a front to fool the authorities here. Their relationship was very good and\n\nthe money was his to do as he pleased. What need was there for him to trick the Defendant\n\nin any way? If it was meant to be a gift from lavish \"husband\" to beloved\n\n\"wife\", why not just say so?57. The evidence showed that Mr Ganesh faithfully and accurately\n\nexplained everything to the Defendant who raised no protest or query about the terms,\n\nobviously because that was the understanding she had with her \"husband\", her\n\nprovider of all material things. The amendments pertaining to the power of sale must have\n\ncome from the Plaintiff rather than the Defendant, contrary to the Plaintiff’s\n\nassertions, but that did not change anything of substance here. Indeed, it would be\n\nfurther evidence of the Plaintiff wanting to be doubly sure there was no doubt who owned\n\nthe property, which would be the Defendant’s only if the Plaintiff should pass away\n\nwithout having dealt with the property.58. Clearly, the Defendant had no defence to the Plaintiff’s claim\n\nand had raised nothing that would merit a trial. I therefore allowed the Plaintiff’s\n\nappeal and gave judgment as claimed. I awarded the Plaintiff $5000/- costs for the entire\n\naction.Sgd:TAY YONG KWANGJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
