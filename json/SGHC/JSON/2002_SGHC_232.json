        "Facts as to the first charge": "6        The following were the\n\nfacts as found by the trial judge.7        Staff Sgt Wong Vee Kong,\n\nthe prosecution’s first witness, entered the Tiananmen KTV & Lounge at 12.50am on\n\n23 December 2001. He was in plain clothes and was accompanied by a group of officers, also\n\nin plain clothes. Due to his seniority, Staff Sgt Wong led the group. Staff Sgt Wong\n\nsurveyed the premises and spotted some goings-on in KTV room 18, where he observed a woman\n\ndancing with a customer. He also observed that two more women were chatting and sitting\n\nwith some other customers in the same room. These observations prompted Staff Sgt\n\nWong’s to enter the room whereupon he identified himself as a police officer. In the\n\ncourse of his questioning and the subsequent arrests, Staff Sgt Wong identified the two\n\nwomen who were sitting with the customers as Liu Hong Lian (Liu) and Zhang Chong Ling\n\n(Zhang). It was undisputed that these two women were employed as singers by the appellant.\n\nThe Licensing Conditions for Nightclubs/Cocktail Lounges/Discotheques/Restaurants states\n\nthat :The licensee shall ensure that the singers do not sit or dance with the\n\n    customers.As against the dancer, Gao Hong Mei, no subsequent action was taken as\n\nStaff Sgt Wong was satisfied that she was brought in as a guest.",
        "The appellant’s challenge on conviction under the first charge": "8        The appellant disputed the\n\ntrial judge’s finding that Zhang and Liu were sitting with the customers, but did not\n\nprovide any evidence to persuade this court to disregard trial judge’s findings on\n\nthis matter. The district judge stated at pages 11 and 12 of his grounds of decision:In the present case, if Staff Sgt Wong’s evidence is believed, the\n\n    ingredients of [the first charge] would have been satisfied. Having carefully considered\n\n    the matter, I found Staff Sgt Wong to be a reliable witness and that it is inconceivable\n\n    that he could have been mistaken about seeing Liu and Zhang.There was nothing in the appellant’s submission nor in anything\n\nthe trial judge said on this matter that could persuade this court to alter the trial\n\njudge’s findings. InAng Jwee Herng v PP[2001] 2 SLR 474I re-stated the\n\nfollowing principle:It is settled law that an appellate court will be slow to overturn\n\n    findings of fact by the trial judge especially when an assessment of the credibility and\n\n    veracity of the witness has been made.This principle has been used in a whole host of case law -Shamsul\n\nbin Abdullah v PPMA145/2002;Lim Ah Poh v PP[1992] 1 SLR 713at 719;Teo\n\nKeng Pong v PP[1996] 3 SLR 329at 342;Ng Soo Hin v PP[1994] 1 SLR 105;Sundara\n\nMoorthy Lankatharan v PP[1997] 3 SLR 464.9        The three reasons given by\n\nthe trial judge as to why he came to the conclusion that the two singers, Zhang and Liu,\n\nwere sitting with the customers were sound. The trial judge stated that Staff Sgt Wong had\n\nenough observation time before entering room 18 to confirm that the women were sitting\n\nwith the customers. Secondly, the trial judge stated there was not any evidence produced\n\nby the appellant to show that Staff Sgt Wong was less than diligent in his observation\n\nskills. The appellant’s contention that Staff Sgt Wong was totally fixated on the\n\ndancer and not on the women sitting with the customers was totally speculative, and the\n\ntrial judge was quite right to dispose of such a far-fetched theory. Thirdly, Staff Sgt\n\nWong wasted no time in checking on the three women in room 18. During the checking, the\n\ntwo women who were sitting with the customers produced their professional visit passes .10        The appellant did not\n\ndispute that Zhang and Liu were singers employed at his KTV Lounge. For these reasons,\n\nthere could be no dispute as to the trial judge’s findings that these singers sat\n\nwith the customers.11        The appellant had a second\n\nargument which challenged his conviction under the first charge. He contended that the\n\ntrial judge erred in law and in fact in finding that the unavailability of Liu and Zhang\n\nwas not fatal to the prosecution’s case.12        Zhang and Liu returned to\n\nChina before the start of the trial in the district court. The two of them had insisted on\n\nreturning home. As the trial judge observed, the authorities in Singapore had no power to\n\ndetain them as they were not immigration offenders.13        The unavailability of\n\nZhang and Liu as witnesses during the trial could not work to extinguish the\n\nappellant’s culpability. The reason why the prosecution did not call Zhang and Liu\n\nwas because had left the country and not because their presence as trial witnesses would\n\njeopardise the prosecution’s case. This was addressed by the trial judge and there\n\nwas no reason to second-guess his application of the law on the matter.14        No adverse inference could\n\nalso be drawn against the prosecution under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act. I\n\nheld inR Yoganathan v PP[1999] 4 SLR 264at 278 that, although the prosecution\n\ndid not call certain witnesses to give evidence and likewise declined to produce PW1 for\n\nfurther cross-examination at the close of its case, the presumption under s116\n\nillustration (g) of the Evidence Act did not operate. This was because the witnesses who\n\nwere not produced were not essential to the prosecution’s case, and neither did the\n\nprosecution withhold evidence from the court or the appellant. Important for our purposes\n\nin this case was the fact that the adverse inference under s 116 illustration (g) of the\n\nEvidence Act is discretionary. Illustration (g) under s116 reads:..... that evidence which could be and is not produced would if\n\n    produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds itWith the guidance ofR Yoganathan, no adverse inference should\n\nbe drawn from the fact that Zhang and Liu returned to China. No ill-motivation on the part\n\nof the prosecution can be latched onto the women’s innocent desire to return home. I\n\nruled inAng Jwee Herng[2001] 2 SLR 474that the prosecution has no\n\nobligation to call any particular witness, unless the failure to do so could be shown to\n\nbe motivated by an intention to hinder or hamper the defence. This principle consolidated\n\nitself in the judgments inChua Keem Long v PP[1996] 1 SLR 510andRoy S\n\nSelvarajah v PP[1998] 3 SLR 517.15        Of importance was the fact\n\nthat the trial judge found Staff Sgt Wong a credible witness and that his testimony was\n\nsufficient to confirm that Zhang and Liu were sitting with the customers. For these\n\nreasons, the appellant’s claim that there were insufficient witnesses must fail.16        The appellant’s third\n\nchallenge to his conviction under the first charge was that the trial judge imposed on him\n\ntoo great a burden to ensure that his singers did not sit with customers. He listed out\n\nall the ways in which he tried to prevent his singers from sitting with customers. Amongst\n\nthe ‘preventive measures’ he listed in his submission were :a    All employees must have a valid work\n\n    permitb    No one below 18 years old is allowed into the\n\n    loungec    The staff is closely supervised by the\n\n    ‘Mummys’ in the lounged    The singers employed are briefed and constantly\n\n    reminded that they are not to sit with customerse    The singers are further briefed and reminded not\n\n    even to mingle with customers, even in passageways or by any form of chit-chattingThe appellant further stated that he personally walked around the\n\nlounge to ensure that no conditions of the licence were breached. Thus, the\n\nappellant’s argument was that, in light of all these preventive measures, he should\n\nbe excused from liability since he fulfilled the condition ‘the licenseeshall\n\nensurethat the singers do not sit with the customers.’ I found that the\n\nappellant did not reach the threshold needed to fulfil the ‘shall ensure’\n\ncondition. It was my belief that the appellant knew of the goings-on in the KTV rooms but\n\nturned a blind eye to them. If the appellant said, as he did, that he regularly did his\n\nrounds to ensure that no breach took place, why did it only take a short while for Staff\n\nSgt Wong to realise that there was a clear breach in room 18? Could it be that the\n\nbreaches only occurred when the big boss was away? (in this case, the appellant was away\n\nfrom the lounge when the raid happened) – I did not think so. This was because the\n\nappellant had stated that he was not the only person who did the patrolling. The\n\n‘Mummys’ or ‘Mamasans’ patrolled also. If the KTV rooms were brightly\n\nlit, the insides of which were able to be seen from the corridors, as has been deduced\n\nfrom the evidence, why would it be so difficult to ensure that no singer sat with a\n\ncustomer? The appellant and his ‘Mummys’ most certainly do do their rounds of\n\npatrol but turn a blind eye to the goings-on in the KTV rooms. I would say that he is\n\nguilty of Nelsonian knowledge – he knows the true facts of things but turns a blind\n\neye to them as Lord Nelson did in putting his telescope to his blind eye and declaring,\n\n‘I see no ships, I see no ships.’ The appellant was guilty of such knowledge\n\n– he knew of the trend of singers sitting with customers. At the time of the raid\n\nonly 25 rooms were occupied. It was not difficult to ensure that singers did not sit with\n\ncustomers in 25 rooms, if the patrols are done diligently. Furthermore, the appellant\n\nstated in cross-examination that he had only 8 singers, and that he took just five to ten\n\nminutes to complete his patrol. There were only eight singers to keep an eye on. And the\n\npatrol only took five to ten minutes. How difficult could it be to keep the place in\n\ncheck? – Not difficult; if the intention is to keep the place in check. From what the\n\nappellant stated on his own accord, it is my view that he ‘turned a blind eye’\n\nto what was really going on in the rooms. For this reason, the ‘shall ensure’\n\ncondition had not been met.17        This was far from making\n\nliability, stemming from the breach of the licensing conditions, strict. Here, the\n\nappellant, although taking the preventive measures, did not possess the intention of\n\nstamping out the breaches of the conditions under the licence. The appellant had Nelsonian\n\nknowledge – he turned a blind eye. The preventive actions were not coupled with a\n\ngenuine desire to prevent the breaches. This was where the appellant counsel’s\n\nargument fell short.18        Thus, the appellant’s\n\ncontention that he took all reasonable and necessary steps to prevent the breach from\n\nhappening was off-tangent. What threw it off was his knowledge.19        For these reasons, the\n\nappeal against conviction under the first charge was dismissed.",
        "Facts as to the second and third charges": "20        On the night of the raid,\n\nNarcotics Officer Gopinathan (NO Gopinathan) was instructed to enter KTV room 19. This he\n\ndid. There were four male customers and two women in the room. NO Gopinathan identified\n\nhimself and stated that he was in plain clothes. In his evidence, he stated that the two\n\nwomen were sitting beside the male customers. After NO Gopinathan had done the initial\n\ninvestigation, he returned to Central Division. The two women in room 19 followed him. The\n\ncase was then handed over to officer Adrian Oong Chun Chang. The two women, Li and Dong,\n\nrequested to return to China. As they were not found to be immigration offenders, they\n\nwere released.21        It was the\n\nprosecution’s case, which was agreed to by the trial judge, that these two women were\n\nthe ones who were sitting and serving the four customers that night.22        The issue here stemmed\n\nfrom the following condition which a licensee must fulfil. According to the\n\n‘Licensing Conditions for Nightclubs/Cocktail\n\nLounges/Discotheques/Restaurants/Bars’:The licensee shall ensure that onlyregisteredwaitresses,\n\n    bar-girls, and lounge-hostesses are permitted to serve customers.Dong and Li were not registered and, on the strength of the prosecution\n\nwitnesses, the trial judge found the appellant in breach of the above condition. The\n\nappellant contested this finding on several grounds.",
        "The appellant’s challenge on convictions under the second and\n\nthird charge respectively": "23        The appellant contended\n\nthat the trial judge erred in law and in fact in finding that both Li and Dong had been\n\nsufficiently identified. The arrest report showed that, the two women were Dong and Li. As\n\nNO Gopinathan stated in his examination-in-chief:After I had finished, I handed over the particulars to\n\n    one of the In-Charge and escorted the females to the holding area. We then went back to\n\n    Central Division.The two females from room 19 followed me. Officer Adrian Oong\n\n    Chun Chang lodged an arrest report. I gave the particulars to Oong who lodged the report.\n\n    I verified the arrest report. (my emphasis)There was hardly any slip in the correct identification of these two\n\nwomen, Dong and Li.24        The appellant also\n\ncontended that the trial judge erred in law and fact by accepting and giving too much\n\nweight to the evidence of Cheok Ah Lek (Cheok) and Liew Fatt Nien (Liew), who were two of\n\nthe four customers in room 19 that night. Liew and Cheok were prosecution witnesses.25        To this end, it is apt to\n\nre-emphasise the trial judge’s own apprehensions toward Liew’s testimony that\n\nDong and Li were definitely the women in room 19. The trial judge’s apprehension\n\nstemmed from the fact that Liew had confirmed the two women as the two women in room 19 a\n\ngood six months after the raid. The important point here was that the trial judge did take\n\nthis into consideration. It is apt to cite a key part of his ruling on this matter:I am of the view thateven without Liew’s identification\n\n    evidence, the identification of Li and Dong as the two women sitting with Cheok,\n\n    Liew and their friends at the material time had been properly established….Staff Sgt\n\n    Oong Chun Chang corroborated Narcotics Officer Gopinathan’s evidence relating to the\n\n    making of the arrest report (exhibit P10). According to the arrest report, (a) the two\n\n    women arrested were Li Jin Hong and Dong Jing Yi, and (b) the two women were sitting\n\n    together with Kwek Leng Kee (Kwek) and Ong Teng Koon (Ong) (the other two customers).\n\n    During the trial, the defence did not challenge at all these aspects of the\n\n    prosecution’s case. (my emphasis)This, the trial judge stated, was enough to overcome the few\n\ninconsistencies between the evidence of Liew, Cheok, and NO Gopinathan. There was nothing\n\nsubmitted which should prompt this Court to second-guess the learned judge’s findings\n\non the matter.26        The appellant’s third\n\nchallenge as regards the second and third charges was that the trial judge erred in law\n\nand in fact in finding that the prosecution’s failure to call Li and Dong, and Kwek\n\nand Ong (the other two customers) was not fatal to the prosecution’s case.27        The trial judge\n\nspecifically tackled the issue of the absence of these four persons at trial. He stated,\n\nat para 44 of his grounds of decision:I am of the opinion that the fact that neither Li, Dong, Kwek, nor Ong\n\n    gave evidence did not create a lacuna in the Prosecution’s case as there was direct\n\n    and credible evidence from other material witnesses.With this statement in mind, the credibility of the material witnesses\n\nwhich included Narcotics Officer Gopinathan and customer Cheok ought not to be\n\nsecond-guessed by this Court.28        The appellant’s\n\nfourth challenge as regards the second and third charges was that the trial judge erred in\n\nlaw and in fact in finding that Li and Dong were serving customers and working in room 19.\n\nThe issue here was that Li and Dong were not registered – there was no dispute as to\n\nthis. Couple this fact with the following finding of the trial judge’s and it was\n\nvery difficult to allow such a claim by the appellant. At para 46 of his grounds of\n\ndecision, the trial judge stated:There is clear evidence that Li and Dong were serving\n\n    customers in KTV room 19. Both Cheok and Liew gave evidence that during their karaoke\n\n    session, the women were (a) sitting with the customers, (b) pouring drinks for them, and\n\n    (c) joining in the singing. Their evidence is corroborated by Narcotics Officer Gopinathan\n\n    who testified that at the time of entering KTV room 19, he heard some loud music from the\n\n    room. After entering, Narcotics Officer Gopinathan observed two women, later established\n\n    to be Li and Dong, to be sitting with the customers and that there were some glasses and\n\n    liquor bottles in the room.The trial judge’s reservation toward Liew’s evidence was only\n\nlimited to his identification evidence as regards Li and Dong. Quite simply, therefore,\n\nthe women were not on the register but were pouring and serving the four men drinks.29        But could Li and Dong have\n\nbeen guests of the men? – Or could the two women have entered the KTV lounge without\n\nthe appellant’s management knowing about it? However, it was clear that the trial\n\njudge was satisfied with the fact that Li and Dong were not the guests of the four men,\n\nand there was no reason why this court should differ from this conclusion. What about the\n\ntheory that Li and Dong could have slipped into the KTV Lounge? – The very testimony\n\nof the appellant closed the door on such an argument. The following verbatim, at page 47\n\nof the notes of evidence (cross-examination of appellant), was telling:Q You have advised or alerted your reception staff to stop people from\n\n    sneaking in to enjoy KTV facilities, at company’s expense?A Yes. Instructions given to reception to ascertain whether person\n\n    entering is a customer or otherwise.Q Often difficult to ensure no outsider enters KTV because you have\n\n    only three reception staff?A Disagree.Q At anytime, how many receptionists on duty at the counter?A At least one.Q Staff at counter would be able to see who enters?A Normally, we would have a captain to entertain them. If the\n\n    receptionist leads the customer to the rooms, the captain would be at the reception.If the KTV Lounge was as tight in its procedure as to who was allowed\n\nin and who was not, as the appellant suggested in his testimony, how then could Li and\n\nDong have slipped by the checks? The fact of the matter was that they did not even need to\n\nsneak in, as their presence was known to the management. To this end, I agreed with the\n\ntrial judge’s assessment, at para 52 of his grounds of decision, that:On the totality of the evidence, I find that Li and Dong had been\n\n    permitted to serve at the Lounge by the appellant and his management.To argue that Dong and Li were free-lance hostesses and should\n\ntherefore not have to be registered in order to serve was to make a nonsense of the\n\nregistering condition. The register exists to keep track of the employment arrangements in\n\nthe lounge industry. If it were otherwise, there would only be a handful of registered\n\nservers and a whole host of free-lancers. For these reasons, this last contention of the\n\nappellant’s must fail.30        The appellant’s\n\nrecord offered him no favours. He had been fined no less than six times for breach of the\n\nPublic Entertainment and Meetings Act over a period of 12 years. The last sentence was\n\npassed on 5 November 2001 for providing public entertainment in contravention of a\n\ncondition in a licence under s18(1)(c) of the Public Entertainment and Meetings Act. The\n\nfine of $8500 was paid in full, as were all his other fines. Separate from his breaches of\n\nthe Public Entertainment Act was his selling of intoxicating liquor to under aged persons\n\nin a licensed premises – for which he was fined $800 on 4 January 1990. Again, he\n\npaid this fine in full. We must stop these licensees from treating fines as part of their\n\nbusiness losses. Such an attitude belittles the law. A heavy fine will wake up licensees\n\nin the same position as the appellant to the fact that fines too can be costly and, as a\n\ndeterrent sentence, the $27,000 fine imposed by the district judge is a good start.31        The appeal was dismissed.",
