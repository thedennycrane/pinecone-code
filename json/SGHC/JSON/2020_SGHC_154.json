        "Introduction": "1 The underlying claims in this action relate to,inter alia, the manufacturing of memory cards and Ink Die cards by the plaintiff/respondent (the “plaintiff”) from semi-conductor wafers sold to the plaintiff by the defendant/appellant (the “defendant”). 2 In Summons 4653 of 2019, the plaintiff applied for summary judgment against the defendant (the “defendant”) for a claim amounting to USD 490,443.42 in respect of various unpaid invoices. In the alternative, the plaintiff sought summary judgment for a lower sum of USD 378,247.40 after taking into account the defendant’s quantified counterclaims.1Foot Note 1×HC/SUM 4653/2019; Minute Sheet (HC/SUM 4653/2019) at p 2 (in respect of alternative judgment for the lower sum)At the hearing below, the assistant registrar granted the plaintiff summary judgment for the full extent of its claim (the “judgment”).2Foot Note 2×HC/ORC 8249/2019The defendant appealed against the assistant registrar’s decision. 3 In Summons 479 of 2020 (“SUM 479/2020”), the defendant applied for leave to adduce further evidence for the appeal. This evidence took the form of a further affidavit from the defendant’s director and Chief Financial Officer. 4 Both the appeal and SUM 479/2020 came before me on 17 February 2020. I first dealt with SUM 479/2020 and, after hearing the parties, I allowed the application. I then proceeded to hear the appeal proper, also on 17 February, and reserved judgment. I delivered judgment orally on 12 March 2020, allowing the appeal in part. I granted the defendant conditional leave to defend part of the plaintiff’s claim amounting to USD 25,343.92. Consequently, I substituted the judgment granted by the assistant registrar with judgment against the defendant for the sum of USD 465,099.50 (the “revised judgment”). I declined to order a stay of execution of the revised judgment pending the determination of the defendant’s counterclaims.3Foot Note 3×HC/ORC 1955/2020 5 As the defendant has since filed an appeal against my decision (in CA/CA 57 of 2020), I provide my written grounds of decision.",
        "Background": "6 The plaintiff is a company incorporated in the Republic of Korea. It was, at all material times, in the business of developing and selling semi-conductor equipment and providing semi-conductor packaging services.4Foot Note 4×Plaintiff’s Submissions at para 3The defendant is a company incorporated in Singapore and is in the business of selling computer hardware and related equipment.5Foot Note 5×Defendant’s Submissions at para 9 7 From time to time, the defendant purchased semi-conductor wafers from SK Hynix Asia Pte Ltd (“Hynix”), and sold them to the plaintiff. The defendant would then issue invoices to the plaintiff when the wafers were delivered to the latter.6Foot Note 6×1st Affidavit of Seung Lee at paras 10, 12; Defendant’s Submissions at para 10The plaintiff would use these wafers to manufacture memory cards, which it then sold to the defendant.7Foot Note 7×1st Affidavit of Seung Lee at para 10The plaintiff would thereafter issue its invoices to the defendant for the memory cards manufactured and sold when they were delivered to the defendant.8Foot Note 8×Defendant’s Submissions at para 11 8 The Hynix semi-conductor wafers that were sent to the plaintiff contained ink die, a raw material that could be extracted, tested, and used to fabricate lower-grade, but still commercially viable, micro-SD cards (“Ink Die Cards”). The plaintiff assisted the defendant with the extraction of ink die from the wafers delivered to it, and conducted tests on the extracted ink die to determine the net quantity of viable ink die that could be used to manufacture Ink Die Cards (the “Ink Die Services”). When the plaintiff had completed the extraction and tests, it notified the defendant of the amount payable for the Ink Die Services and provided the defendant with a fee quote for manufacturing the Ink Die Cards from the viable extracted ink die.9Foot Note 9×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) at paras 7–9; Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) at para 8; 2nd Affidavit of Alrasu Shanmugam at paras 14 - 16 9 In its Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1), the plaintiff claimed that various invoices had been issued by the defendant to the plaintiff andvice versa. The invoices issued by the plaintiff to the defendant from 13 November 2018 to 20 February 2019 amounted to USD 3,639,168.82. The defendant, on the other hand, issued four invoices to the plaintiff amounting to USD 3,098,725.40. After these sums were set-off against each other and taking into account a further sum of USD 50,000 which had been paid by the defendant to the plaintiff on 8 January 2019, a net sum of USD 490,443.42 was owed to the plaintiff by the defendant.10Foot Note 10×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) at para 4The defendant did not dispute the quantum of the unpaid invoices.11Foot Note 11×Plaintiff’s Submissions at para 6; Defendant’s Submissions at paras 18–19Of the total sum claimed by the plaintiff, USD 465,099.50 relates to the manufacturing and sale of memory cards from 13 November 2018 to 22 January 2019 (the “Time Period”).12Foot Note 12×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) at para 4; Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) at para 5The remaining USD 25,343.92 relates to one invoice (the “USD 25,343.92 Invoice”) issued by the plaintiff for the Ink Die Services and manufacturing of the Ink Die Cards.13Foot Note 13×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) at para 11; Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) at para 8 10 The defendant argued that it should be granted unconditional leave to defend the  plaintiff’s claim as it had a plausible counterclaims amounting to a defence of legal or equitable set-off, and that it had raised triable issues of law and/or fact in its defence.14Foot Note 14×Defendant’s Submissions at para 6(a)Alternatively, the defendant argued that the execution of any judgment granted in the plaintiff’s favour should be stayed pending the hearing and disposal of the defendant’s counterclaims.15Foot Note 15×Defendant’s Submissions at para 6(b) 11 In respect of the plaintiff’s claim for the outstanding invoices amounting to USD 465,099.50 (the “USD 465,099.50 Invoices”), the defendant claimed (i) that the plaintiff had failed to deliver manufactured memory cards to the defendant on time (the “delay counterclaim”), and (ii) that there was a shortfall in the quantity of memory cards delivered to the defendant (the “shortfall counterclaim”). As a result, the defendant suffered loss and damage which it was entitled to set-off against the plaintiff’s claim.16Foot Note 16×Defendant’s Submissions at para 18The defendant quantified the shortfall counterclaim at USD 17,999.50.17Foot Note 17×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) at paras 33; 39It did not quantify the delay counterclaim apart from quantifying its alleged losses as a result of the cancellation of certain purchase orders by one customer (see [53] below). 12 As for the plaintiff’s claim on the USD 25,343.92 Invoice, the defendant contended that of the full invoice amount, the plaintiff was not entitled to USD 21,284.95 as the Ink Die cards delivered to the defendant were faulty or defective (the “faulty cards defence”).18Foot Note 18×Defendant’s Submissions at para 19(c)In addition, the faulty or defective Ink Die cards caused the defendant loss of profits amounting to USD 14,625.52, which it was entitled to raise as a counterclaim and set-off against the USD 25,343.92 Invoice (the “faulty cards counterclaim”).19Foot Note 19×Defendant’s Submissions at para 19(d)",
        "The Issues": "13 The issues to be decided by me in this appeal are as follows: (a) Whether the defendant should be granted leave to defend the plaintiff’s claim, whether in full or in part; and (b) If leave to defend is not granted to the defendant or only granted for part of the plaintiff’s claim, whether a stay of execution should be granted on the judgment (or part thereof) obtained by the plaintiff pending the hearing and disposal of the defendant’s counterclaim.",
        "Splitting the Plaintiff’s claims": "14 As a preliminary point, O 14 r 3 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (the “ROC”) provides that unless on the hearing of an application under O 14 r 1 of the ROC the defendant satisfies the court that there is an issue or question in dispute that ought to be tried with respect to the claim or part of a claim to which the application relates, or there ought for some other reason to be a trial of that claim or part, the court may give judgment for the plaintiff against that defendant on that claimor partas may be just having regard to the nature of the remedy or relief claimed. 15 On a plain reading of O 14 r 3 of the ROC, having regard to the nature of the remedy or relief claimed by a plaintiff, the court may in an appropriate case give a defendant leave to defend a part of the plaintiff’s claim and grant summary judgment over the residue. There is, therefore, no obstacle in this case to this court assessing the plaintiff’s claim for the USD 465,099.50 Invoices and the claim for the USD 25,343.92 Invoice separately. During the hearing, the defendant’s counsel, Ms Charmaine Chan-Richard, also separated the treatment of the plaintiff’s claims in her submissions in a similar fashion. I will therefore consider each of these claims in turn, but before I do so, I first touch on the applicable legal principles.",
        "The Law": "16 The legal principles governing an application for summary judgment are well-settled. The plaintiff has to first demonstrate aprima faciecase for summary judgment. If he cannot do so, the application ought to be dismissed. Once the plaintiff has crossed that threshold, the tactical burden then shifts to the defendant opposing the application (M2B World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko[2015] 1 SLR 325 (“M2B”) at [17]-[18]). 17 In order to obtain leave to defend, a defendant must “establish that there is a fair or reasonable probability that he has a real orbona fidedefence” (M2Bat [17]). 18 Our courts have repeatedly emphasised that leave to defend would not be granted if “all the defendant provides is a mere assertion, contained in an affidavit, of a given situation which forms the basis of his defence” (M2Bat [19], citingProsperous Credit Pte Ltd v Gen Hwa Franchise International Pte Ltdand others[1998] 1 SLR(R) 53 at [14]). Therefore, bare assertions in an affidavit will not get a defendant very far in resisting an application for summary judgment against him. The assertions must be supported by some evidence, whether direct or indirect, and the evidence itself must be reasonably capable of belief (Singapore Civil Procedure 2020, vol 1(Chua Lee Ming editor-in-chief) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2019) (“Singapore Civil Procedure”) at para 14/4/5). 19 Following from the principles above, the court will not grant leave if the assertions in the affidavit are equivocal, lacking in precision, inconsistent with undisputed contemporary documents or other statements from the same deponent, or inherently improbable in themselves (M2Bat [19] citingBank Negara Malaysia v Mohd Ismail[1992] 1 MLJ 400). As pointedly noted by Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) inAbdul Salam Asanaru Pillai (trading as South Kerala Cashew Exporters) v Nomanbhoy & Sons Pte Ltd[2007] 2 SLR(R) 856 (“Abdul Salam”) at [39], whilst a summary judgment application is not to be dealt with as if it were a trial on affidavits, it does not mean that anything stated in the affidavits is to be accepted without rational consideration to determine if there is a fair or reasonable probability of a real defence. 20 The approach to be adopted in determining whether summary judgment ought to be ordered where there is a subsisting counterclaim is helpfully summarised inSingapore Civil Procedureat para 14/4/10 as follows: Whether a summary judgment ought to be ordered where there was a subsisting counterclaim will be decided based on a practical framework. First, if the counterclaim was plausible and second, if the plausible counterclaim amounted to a defence of set-off (legal or equitable), then unconditional leave to defend would be granted in respect of the entire claim. On the other hand, if the counterclaim did not amount to a defence of set-off and it was clear that the claim must succeed, and that the plaintiff would only be put to expense in proving his claim, then judgment ought to be given to the plaintiff in respect of the entire claim. Nevertheless, where the plausible counterclaim was sufficiently connected to the claim and where there were grounds for a stay of execution in light of the connected and plausible counterclaim, the court may exercise its discretion to stay the execution on the judgment until the counterclaim had been tried (Kim Seng Orchid Pte. Ltd. v. Lim Kah Hin (trading as Yik Zhuan Orchid Garden)[2018] 3 S.L.R. 34 at [97]–[98]) 21 Where a counterclaim is not sufficiently plausible as to amount to abona fidedefence, the court can nevertheless consider whether it would be appropriate to grant conditional leave to defend. In this regard, the Court of Appeal inAkfel Commodities Turkey Holding Anonim Sirketi v Townsend, Adam[2019] 2 SLR 412 (“Akfel”) held at [41] that where “what the defendant has shown does not amount to a fair probability of abona fidedefence, but only that the defence raised is not hopeless, it is warranted for the court to impose conditional leave to defend”. The court would “reserve the grant of conditional leave to cases where the defendant’s evidence hasnot yet reachedthe level of showing a reasonable probability of abona fidedefence, a fair case for defence, reasonable grounds for setting up a defence or a fair probability of abona fidedefence” (Akfelat [51]). 22 As held inAbdul Salamat [44] and affirmed by the Court of Appeal inAkfelat [46],a “condition is appropriate when the court has the sense that although it cannot be said that the claimed defence is so hopeless that, in truth, there is no defence, the overall impression is such that some demonstration of commitment on the part of the defendant to the claimed defence is called for”.",
        "The USD 465,099.50 Invoices Claim": "23 Having set out in the foregoing paragraphs the principles germane to this appeal, I turn now to the plaintiff’s claims. I start with a summary of the parties’ arguments on the defendant’s delay and shortfall counterclaims.",
        "Parties’ Submissions": "Delay Counterclaim 24 At the outset, it is worth noting that the defendant did not at any material time dispute receiving the memory cards that formed the subject of the USD 465,099.50 Invoices. Nor did the defendant dispute the amount claimed by the plaintiff under the USD 465,099.50 Invoices at any material time (leaving aside the counterclaims raised by the defendant in this action by way of set-off). On this score alone, I was satisfied that the plaintiff had demonstrated aprima faciecase for summary judgment. The tactical burden therefore shifted to the defendant to satisfy me that there existed a fair or reasonable probability of abona fidedefence. 25 In relation to its delay counterclaim, the defendant submitted that the parties had an oral agreement in place as to when the memory cards should be delivered. The defendant’s case was that the cards would be delivered within seven to ten days of the plaintiff receiving the Hynix semi-conductor wafers. The defendant contended that, in breach of this agreement, the plaintiff did not deliver the memory cards under the USD 465,099.50 Invoices on time.20Foot Note 20×Defendant’s Submissions at para 49In addition, the plaintiff also failed to deliver the memory cards on time in 2018 outside the Time Period.21Foot Note 21×Defendant’s Submissions at paras 49–50In contrast, the plaintiff’s case was that the memory cards would only be delivered within seven to ten days of the plaintiff receiving the Hynix semi-conductor wafers and another component known as the ASolid flash controllers.22Foot Note 22×Plaintiff’s Submissions at para 53.2 26 The defendant further submitted that the plaintiff was aware (and admitted in the pleadings) that the market in 2018 for memory cards was a volatile one, and that there was either an implied term or an understanding between the parties that time was of the essence in respect of the delivery of memory cards to the defendant.23Foot Note 23×Defendant’s Submissions at para 51In order to demonstrate that the plaintiff knew the dates on which it received the Hynix semi-conductor wafers and the quantity of wafers received, the defendant exhibited,inter alia,documents to prove Hynix’s delivery of semi-conductor wafers to the plaintiff during the Time Period.24Foot Note 24×2nd Affidavit of Alrasu Shanmugam at para 32; pp 45-71 (Exhibit SA-7)It also exhibited and referred to documents to establish the quantity of memory cards delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant and the dates on which the cards were delivered during the Time Period. The defendant argued that the delay in delivery of memory cards from the plaintiff to the defendant could be evidenced by comparing the dates on which Hynix semi-conductors were delivered to the plaintiff, and the dates on which the plaintiff delivered memory cards to the defendant.25Foot Note 25×2nd Certified Transcript at p 2 ln 24-33; 2nd Affidavit of Alrasu Shanmugam at para 34; pp 73-112 (Exhibit SA-8); 1st Affidavit of Seung Lee at pp 28-74 27 The defendant also asserted that the plaintiff had not made out its case that the cards would only be delivered within seven to ten days of the plaintiff receiving the Hynix semi-conductor wafersandthe ASolid flash controllers.26Foot Note 26×2nd Certified Transcript at p 3 ln 14-16According to the defendant, there was no such agreement.27Foot Note 27×Defendant’s Submissions at para 54 28 In support of this submission, the defendant highlighted that the plaintiff did not adduce evidence of when it received the ASolid flash controllers, which would have been necessary to show when the delivery dates were intended to be.28Foot Note 28×2nd Certified Transcript at p 3 ln 14-17Certain Powerpoint slides that the plaintiff sought to rely on to evidence the parties’ agreement (see [30] below) also did not mention ASolid flash controllers, and there was no evidence that the slides were sent to the defendant at the material time.29Foot Note 29×Defendant’s Submissions at paras 52-53; 2nd Certified Transcript at p 3 ln 19-25Finally, the instant message exchanges that took place at the material time between the plaintiff’s and defendant’s representatives via the messaging platform known as KakaoTalk (“Kakao”) adduced by the plaintiff in evidence did not contain discussions on actual delivery dates or timings, and therefore did not support the plaintiff’s contention that the dates and timings of delivery were subject to discussion and agreement between parties.30Foot Note 30×2nd Certified Transcript at p 3 ln 31 to p 4 ln 17 29 Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Aaron Leong, advanced three main submissions in support of the plaintiff’s case. First, he submitted that the defendant knew or ought to have known that it required both the Hynix semi-conductor wafers and ASolid flash controllers for the manufacturing of memory cards, and that accordingly, it would have been obvious that the manufacturing process could only commence after the receipt of both materials.31Foot Note 31×Plaintiff’s Submissions at para 53.2.2 – 53.2.4In support of this submission, the plaintiff made reference to records of Kakao conversations between Mr Seung Lee, the Vice President (Sales Division) of the plaintiff (“Mr Lee”) and Mr Ashish Aggarwala of the Defendant (“Mr Aggarwala”). Mr Aggarwala was the main contact person through whom the plaintiff engaged with the defendant.32Foot Note 32×1st Affidavit of Seung Lee at para 19In a Kakao conversation on 12 March 2018, Mr Lee and Mr Aggarwala had a discussion about assembly costs, and this conversation demonstrated the defendant’s knowledge that the plaintiff also required ASolid flash controllers in the manufacturing process.33Foot Note 33×1st Affidavit of Bong Won Wook at p 14; Second Certified Transcript at p 9 ln 23-28 30 As for delivery time, Mr Leong submitted that this was one of the standard terms and conditions that applied to transactions between the plaintiff and its customers, and this term was not discussed between the parties.34Foot Note 34×Plaintiff’s Submissions at para 53.2.1The plaintiff also exhibited certain Powerpoint slides which it claimed had been sent to the defendant containing the plaintiff’s business proposal. One of the slides contained the statement “Delivery- From 7 days after receiving materials”. Notwithstanding this, the parties understood that delivery would in fact commence within 7 to 10 days after it received the materials because the plaintiff would only purchase the ASolid flash controllers after receiving the Hynix semi-conductor wafers, which process took an additional two to three days.35Foot Note 35×1st Affidavit of Seung Lee at paras 30.2.1- 30.2.2; p 96The plaintiff contended that the documents which the defendant sought to rely on (see [26] above) did not show that the time for delivery was 7 to 10 days after delivery of only the Hynix semi-conductor wafers, and therefore did not support their case.36Foot Note 36×Second Certified Transcript at p 9 ln 11-17 31 Mr Leong’s second argument was that the exact shipment schedule for the memory cards was discussed and adjusted for each purchase order, and as such there could not have been delays as alleged by the defendant.37Foot Note 37×Plaintiff’s Submissions at paras 53.3.-54To illustrate this point, Mr Leong referred to certain Kakao chats between Mr Lee and Mr Aggarwala. These chats showed that on one occasion, they discussed the type and quantity of memory cards to be shipped, and on another occasion,whenthe plaintiff would be able to receive Hynix semi-conductor wafers from the defendant in order for the plaintiff to be able to manufacture memory cards and ship them to the defendant.38Foot Note 38×Plaintiffs Submissions at para 53.3; 1st Affidavit of Bong Won Wook at paras 17-18, pp 20-22Mr Leong submitted that these chat records showed that there was flexibility in the delivery schedule to be agreed between the parties, and the defendant had not shown any evidence to prove that there was a fixed timeframe for delivery as it now alleged.39Foot Note 39×Second Certified Transcript at p 10 ln 9-13 32 Third, Mr Leong submitted that the defendant did not, at any time before this suit was commenced, raise any dispute on any of the invoices issued by the plaintiff at the material time or mention any alleged counterclaim.40Foot Note 40×Plaintiff’s Submissions at para 55Given that the defendant pleaded that time of delivery was of the essence, it would follow that the defendant should have raised objections with the plaintiff to the late shipments or to the payment of invoices had there in fact been delays in delivery by the plaintiff and/or any losses thereby suffered by the defendant, as now asserted by the defendant. None of the affidavits filed by the defendant to resist the summary judgment application contained any evidence of any objections, whether by way of correspondence or otherwise, being raised by the defendant.41Foot Note 41×Second Certified Transcript at p 10 ln 15-25 33 To buttress this argument, the plaintiff adduced a number of Kakao chat conversations between Mr Lee and Mr Aggarwala, demonstrating not just an absence of any protests or complaints by the defendant about any alleged delays, but acknowledgements by the defendant on a number of occasions (even before the Time Period) of its obligation to pay the plaintiff amounts outstanding, and that it had not done so.42Foot Note 42×Second Certified Transcript at p 10 ln 27-30Relevant portions of some of the exchanges on Kakao are reproduced below:43Foot Note 43×1st Affidavit of Bong Won Wook at pp 30-33 23 May 2018 1:40 Mr Lee: Hi Ashish 1:41 We need payment update.

Leave my message to Shan. We’re going legal solution if he doesn’t pay all overdue by tomorrow 12:39 Mr Aggarwala: ok I will inform him 12:39 Mr Lee: It’s not mine. CEO’s direction 12:39 Mr Aggarwala: alright got it [emphasis added] 34 Apart from Kakao chat conversations, the plaintiff also adduced email correspondence between Mr Lee and the defendant’s director and Chief Financial Officer Mr Shanmugam Alrasu (“Mr Shanmugam”) from February to April 2019. In these email exchanges, Mr Shanmugam informed Mr Lee that the defendant needed more time to make payment of the amounts outstanding. In none of these emails did the defendant raise any issues or complaints of delay or any alleged losses suffered by the defendant arising from such delay.44Foot Note 44×Second Certified Transcript at p 10 ln 32 to p 11 ln 2; 1st Affidavit of Seung Lee at para 17Nor was there any intimation of any counterclaim. 35 A number of the email replies sent by Mr Shanmugam to Mr Lee were in response to Mr Lee’s threat, in an email sent by him on 6 March 2019 to Mr Shanmugam, that the plaintiff would be compelled to take legal action if the sums then owed to the plaintiff (amounting to slightly more than USD 465,000) remained unpaid. This threat was repeated in subsequent emails of 21 March, 22 March and 8 April 2019. These were some of Mr Shanmugam’s replies to Mr Lee’s emails:45Foot Note 45×1st Affidavit of Seung Lee at pp 79-87 6 March 2019 2.33pm Dear Seung, As you know that the memory market is very bad and all our collections are not coming on time. In addition to this, the currency fluctuation in the developing countries where we are operating also affecting our collections. We need at least a month to come out from the currency issue and get our collections. Appreciate if you can give us some (sic) to give you the payment plan and settle the due.  13 March 2019 2.58pm Dear Seung, I am really feel bad on the employee layoff.

Appreciate if you can allow us some more time to resolve this.  8 April 2019 4.42pm Hi Seung, Currently the new investment process is going on. Need at least a month or two. [emphasis added] 36 Even when the defendant received the plaintiff’s lawyers’ letter of demand in June 2019, the defendant remained silent and did not raise any concerns of delay or hint at any counterclaim.46Foot Note 46×2nd Certified Transcript at p 12 ln 2-6; 1st Affidavit of Seung Lee at pp 90-92 Shortfall Counterclaim 37 As for the shortfall counterclaim (see [11]), the defendant’s case, in essence, was that the plaintiff did not deliver the same quantity of memory cards to the defendant as represented by the quantity of Hynix semi-conductor wafers sold and delivered to the plaintiff by the defendant.47Foot Note 47×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) at paras 29 - 30On the other hand, the plaintiff submitted that there was an agreement between the parties that the production yield would be 99.6%. This meant that the quantity of memory cards manufactured by the plaintiff would be 99.6% of the quantity of Hynix semi-conductor wafers received and/or 99.6% of the quantity of memory cards stated in the defendant’s purchase order.48Foot Note 48×Plaintiff’s Submissions at para 58In support of its case, the plaintiff referred to the Powerpoint slides mentioned at [30] above; one of the slides showed various percentages of contract yield, the highest being 99.6%.49Foot Note 49×1st Affidavit of Seung Lee at pp 94-95; 2nd Certified Transcript at p 11 ln 11-16The plaintiff also submitted that the defendant did not provide any proof that the plaintiff had to deliver 100% of the quantity stated in the defendant’s purchase orders.50Foot Note 50×Plaintiff’s Submissions at para 57; 2nd Certified Transcript at p 11 ln 11-16In addition, the plaintiff had delivered to the defendant memory cards in excess of the requisite 99.6% contract yield out of goodwill. Those cards were marked as being of no commercial value as they were given to the defendant for free.51Foot Note 51×Plaintiff’s Submissions at para 59 38 In response, the defendant submitted that the Powerpoint slides which the plaintiff sought to rely on did not support the plaintiff’s case that it only had to deliver 99.6% of the quantity of memory cards stated in the purchase orders.52Foot Note 52×2nd Certified Transcript at p 5 ln 5-9Insofar as the plaintiff contended that they also shipped memory cards to the defendant in excess of the 99.6% contract yield, the defendant argued that those memory cards represented rejected, defective samples which had no commercial value.53Foot Note 53×2nd Certified Transcript at p 5 ln 15-18The defendant referred to an invoice issued by the plaintiff which contained the notations “No Commercial Value” and “Reject” in relation to two cartons of memory cards.54Foot Note 54×2nd Certified Transcript at p 4 ln 15-18; 1st Affidavit of Seung Lee at p 100 39 Finally, as with the delay counterclaim, the defendant did not raise any complaints of any shortfall(s) in delivery at any time prior to commencement of this action by the plaintiff (see [32] to [35]).55Foot Note 55×Plaintiff’s Submissions at para 60In fact, the defendant made an interim payment to the plaintiff of USD 50,000 in January 2019 following several chasers from the plaintiff. The plaintiff submitted that this partial payment showed that the defendant was trying to pay the monies owed as and when they were able to, and that if it had any valid orbona fidecounterclaims, it would not have made payment of that sum.56Foot Note 56×2nd Certified Transcript at p 11 ln 29-33; 2nd Affidavit of Alrasu Shanmugam at para 27",
        "Analysis and My Decision": "69 In this case, while the defendant had adduced an email in support of its allegation that the Ink Die Cards were faulty, the question does arise as to why the defendant did not bring up the issue in any other subsequent correspondence with the plaintiff. The defendant’s silence buttresses the plaintiff’s argument that the defendant had merely asserted that the Ink Die cards were faulty/defective, but provided little evidence in support of its claim.  However, at the same time, the assertion by the plaintiff that its representative had (in a telephone conversation) spoken to the defendant about this after receiving the defendant’s email is also not corroborated by any evidence. The defendant also did not provide any basis for the quantification of its counterclaim. It merely asserts that its loss of profits is quantified at USD 14,625.52 without providing any details as to how such a precise amount was arrived at. 70 Overall, while I did not think that the threshold of a fair probability of a real orbona fidedefence had quite been met by the defendant based on the (at best) minimal evidence adduced, I ultimately found that this part of the claimed defence was nevertheless not so hopeless that the defendant should be shut out from defending it altogether. Following the principles laid down inAbdul Salam([19]supra) andAkfel([21]supra)(see [21]–[22] above),this was, in my view, an appropriate case where the defendant should be given leave to defend this part of the plaintiff’s claim but on condition that security be furnished by it as a demonstration of its commitment to its claimed defence. 71 I therefore granted the defendant conditional leave to defend this part of the plaintiff’s claimfor the sum of USD 25,343.92. 72 I was conscious that the sum claimed by the plaintiff of USD 25,343.92 spannedboththe defendant’s faulty/defective cardsdefenceand its faulty/defective cardscounterclaim. I wish to make it clear that in granting the defendant conditional leave to defend this part of the plaintiff’s claim, I was not acknowledging the viability of the defendant’s faulty/defective cards counterclaim. As it stands, the faulty/defective cards counterclaim is also based on not much more than a bare assertion and one email from the defendant to the plaintiff. Rather, I considered that the defendant had pleaded its case such that the faulty/defective cards defence and the faulty/defective cards counterclaim,taken together, constituted its response to the plaintiff’s claim for the USD 25,343.92 Invoice. Further, the defendant’s defence and counterclaim on the USD 25,343.92 Invoice claim are clearly interlinked, in that the counterclaim is contingent upon the success of the defence. Given that I have found the faulty/defective cards defence to be not so hopeless as to warrant summary judgment, I decided to grant the defendant conditional leave to defend the entire sum claimed by the plaintiff under the USD 25,343.92 Invoice.",
        "The USD 25,343.92 Invoice Claim": "",
        "Parties’ submissions": "68 As for the USD 25,343.92 Invoice claim, the defendant’s defence was that the plaintiff was not entitled to USD 21,284.95 as the goods supplied by the plaintiff were faulty/ defective.  In addition, the defendant submitted that it had a counterclaim amounting to USD 14,625.52 for lost profits due to the supply by the plaintiff of the defective goods, which it could raise by way of set-off.75Foot Note 75×Defendant’s Submissions at paras 19(c)-(d); 78The defendant submitted that whether the goods were faulty/defective is a matter to be determined at trial. The defendant adduced email correspondence wherein the defendant’s representative informed the plaintiff’s representatives by email on 19 March 2019 that the Ink Die cards were not working.76Foot Note 76×2nd Affidavit of Alrasu Shanmugam at paras 21-24; p 41 (Exhibit SA-6)The email states as follows: Dear Warren, The recently shipped 4gb, 8gb inkdie Cards our customer telling all the Cards are not working. microSD 4GB (AM2691LT) 12, 602 microSD 4GB (AK2689) 9,626 microSD 8GB (AK2689) 23,266 microSD 8GB (AM2691LT) 2,683 What are the controllers used for the above Cards. Can we get the Firmware to upgrade the cards? How Can we make the cards working? The breakdown of the memory cards in the email correspondence matches that of the February 2019 invoice.77Foot Note 77×2nd Affidavit of Alrasu Shanmugam at para 23; p 40The defendant also argued that the plaintiff did not demand payment for this February 2019 invoice prior to the commencement of the suit, and the invoice was also not included in the plaintiff’s initial unamended Statement of Claim.78Foot Note 78×2nd Certified Transcript at p 8 ln 9-11The plaintiff submitted that it had asked the defendant, in a telephone conversation, to send some of the faulty/ defective Ink Die Cards to the plaintiff for it to investigate, but the defendant did not do so. The defendant also did not mention that the Ink Die cards were defective at any other point in time thereafter, such as in further emails or Kakao chat messages. As the defendant did not make any further requests for a return or replacement of the allegedly faulty Ink Die Cards, the plaintiff assumed the issue had been resolved.79Foot Note 79×1st Affidavit of Bong Won Wook at paras 10-11The defendant’s allegation that the cards were faulty was also a bare allegation.80Foot Note 80×2nd Certified Transcript at p 12 ln 16-20In relation to the telephone conversation which the plaintiff stated it had with the defendant, the defendant submitted that it did not have any further right of reply to the affidavit in which the plaintiff had made reference to this telephone conversation. Nonetheless, the defendant argued that whether this conversation even took place and what was said were matters to be proved by evidence at trial.81Foot Note 81×2nd Certified Transcript at p 14 ln 12-17",
        "Stay of Execution": "73 Having granted the defendant conditional leave to defend the claim in relation to the USD 25,343.92 Invoice, the question remains whether the revised judgment granted in relation to the USD 465,099.50 Invoice should be stayed pending determination of the defendant’s shortfall and delay counterclaims. 74 The defendant argued that if the court upheld the judgment, it should be stayed pending the hearing and disposal of its counterclaims, for the following reasons: first, there was a close degree of connection between the plaintiff’s claim in the suit and the defendant’s counterclaims; second, the defendant hadbona fideand strong counterclaims; and third, that the plaintiff’s financial status meant that it was unlikely to be able to satisfy any judgment, if granted, on the counterclaims.82Foot Note 82×Defendant’s Submissions at paras 6(b);104 – 108. 75 The plaintiff relied onKim Seng Orchid([58]supra) and argued that the court should not grant a stay of execution where a counterclaim was not a plausible one. It submitted that the defendant’s evidence was such that its counterclaim was unlikely to succeed at trial, and accordingly, a stay of execution should not be granted.83Foot Note 83×2nd Certified Transcript at p 12 ln 32 to p 13 ln 12 76 In the present case, as I have determined that the defendant’s delay and shortfall counterclaims were not plausible, it follows that a stay of execution should not be granted. Whether a counterclaim had the requisite degree of plausibility is the first step in the framework set out inKim Seng Orchid([58]supra) at [98]: (a)Step 1: whether the counterclaim is plausible— the court should first consider whether the counterclaim is plausible,ie, whether it is reasonably possible for the counterclaim to succeed at trial (or in the slightly tortured formulation adopted inSheppards, whether the counterclaim is “so far plausible that it [is] not unreasonably possible for it to succeed if brought to trial”). If the counterclaim isnotplausible, then its presence ought not to stand in the way of the plaintiff obtaining summary judgment of its whole claim, without any stay pending the determination of the counterclaim, and the court should so rule. If the court finds that the counterclaimisplausible, thenStep 2follows. … [emphasis in original] 77 For the same reasons that I rejected the defendant’s submission that it should be granted unconditional leave to defend on the basis of its counterclaims, I also rejected the defendant’s alternative submission that I should order a stay of execution of the revised judgment pending the determination of the defendant’s counterclaims. As I found that the counterclaims were not plausible, their presence should not stand in the way of the plaintiff obtaining the revised judgment without any stay of execution pending the determination of the counterclaims. 78 Ms Chan-Richard relied onHawley & Hazel Chemical Co (S) Pte Ltd v Szu Ming Trading Pte Ltd[2008] SGHC 13 (“Hawley & Hazel”) in an attempt to persuade me that there should be a stay of execution pending the determination of the defendant’s counterclaimseven ifI was of the view that the counterclaims were not viable.84Foot Note 84×2nd Certified Transcript at p 7 ln 30 to p 8 ln 2 79 InHawley & Hazel, Justice Lai Siu Chiu (as she then was) allowed the plaintiff’s appeal against the assistant registrar’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s summary judgment application against the defendant. Lai J granted the plaintiff summary judgment on its whole claim but also stayed execution of the judgment pending the counterclaim even though she “entertained grave doubts on its merits” at [36]. 80 In my view,Hawley & Hazeldid not assist the defendant. First, each case has to be determined on its own facts. Second, whether to grant a stay of execution pending determination of a counterclaim is ultimately a matter of the court’s discretion. From the judgment inHawley & Hazel, the reasons why the stay was granted are not apparent. I also note thatHawley & Hazelwas decided beforeKim SengOrchid([58]supra) where the practical framework to guide a court when determining a summary judgment application was set out. As I have held at [76], applying Step 1 of theKim SengOrchidframework to the facts of this case, the revised judgment granted to the plaintiff should not be stayed pending determination of the defendant’s counterclaims.",
        "Conclusion": "81 For the above reasons, I allowed the defendant’s appeal in part, to the extent that conditional leave was granted to the defendant to defend the plaintiff’s claim pertaining to the USD 25,343.92 Invoice. Leave to defend was granted on the condition that the defendant furnished security in the sum of USD 25,343.92 by way of a payment of that sum into court or by such other mode of security as may be agreed by the parties.  The security was to be furnished by the defendant within 21 days of the date of my order, and parties were given liberty to apply. 82 The judgment below in respect of the plaintiff’s claim forthe sum of USD 465,099.50 was to stand with no stay of execution. To that extent, the judgment below was substituted with judgment against the defendant for the sum of USD 465,099.50. 83 As for costs, both parties agreed that in substance, the plaintiff had succeeded and should be awarded costs of the appeal. The defendant submitted that a sum of $3,500 (inclusive of disbursements) would be appropriate whereas the plaintiff submitted that $5,000 would be appropriate. In accordance with the costs guidelines set out in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions, I ordered costs of the appeal to be fixed at $4,000 inclusive of disbursements to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff.85Foot Note 85×Certified Transcript (12 March 2020) at pp 10-11As for the costs of the hearing below, Ms Chan-Richard submitted that as the defendant had succeeded partially, the costs order should be varied to $8,000. Mr Leong, on the other hand, argued that the costs order below should remain. I agreed with Mr Leong and accordingly, did not disturb the assistant registrar’s order on costs.
