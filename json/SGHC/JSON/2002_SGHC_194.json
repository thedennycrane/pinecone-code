        "The facts": "3        The appellant is Mohammed\n\nWalik Shafiq Bin Adzhar Sah, a 17 year old male. The facts of the case were not in\n\ndispute. On 20 April 2002, at about 4.20 am, the appellant was spotted by a police officer\n\noutside a shop unit at Blk 57 Marine Terrace, sitting on a light pink-coloured mountain\n\nbike. The police officer approached the appellant with the intention to conduct a spot\n\ncheck on him. However, the appellant rode off on the bike upon seeing the police officer\n\napproaching.4        The police officer gave\n\nchase and intercepted the appellant, who fell off his bike. He fled on foot towards Blk 13\n\nMarine Terrace. The officer conducted a search on Blk 13 and detained the appellant on the\n\n7thfloor of that block.5        Upon questioning as to how\n\nhe came to possess the mountain bike, the appellant informed the police officer that his\n\nfriend, one ‘Boy’ had lent it to him. The appellant was unable to locate\n\n‘Boy’ and he was thereupon arrested on suspicion of having fraudulently obtained\n\nthe mountain bike.",
        "Appeal against sentence": "6        The appellant pleaded\n\nguilty to the charge before the Magistrate’s Court. Before this Court, he appealed\n\nfor a prison sentence instead of a sentence of reformative training. In passing sentence,\n\nthe district judge, sitting as a magistrate, was mindful of the fact that rehabilitation\n\nis the dominant objective in sentencing a youthful offender. He weighed carefully the\n\nmitigating factors of the plea of guilt, the recovery of the property and the\n\nappellant’s youth. He also considered the aggravating circumstances, namely that the\n\nappellant had previously been sent to the Singapore Boys’ Home for the offences of\n\narmed robbery, putting a person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion, and\n\nvoluntarily causing hurt; as well as the fact that the appellant had committed the present\n\noffence less than a year after his formal discharge from the Boys’ Home.7        The judge, after\n\nconsidering the foregoing factors, was satisfied that the matters mentioned in s 13(1) of\n\nthe Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (\"CPC\") were present. Section 13(1)\n\nprovides as follows:13 – (1)    Where a person is\n\n    convicted by the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment\n\n    and that person –(a)    is on the day of his conviction, not less than 16\n\n      but under 21 years of age; or(b)    is, on the day of his conviction, not less than\n\n      14 but under 16 years of age and has, prior to his conviction, been dealt with by a court\n\n      in connection with another offence and had, in respect of that other offence, been ordered\n\n      to be sent to an approved school established under section 62 of the Children and Young\n\n      Persons Act (Cap. 38),andthe High Court or District Court(as the case may be)\n\n    is satisfied, having regard to his character and previous conduct and to the circumstances\n\n    of the offence of which he is convicted, that it is expedient with a view to his\n\n    reformation and the prevention of crime that he should undergo a period of training in a\n\n    reformative training centre, that Court may, in lieu of any other sentence, pass a\n\n    sentence of reformative training\". [Emphasis added]The judge then proceeded to sentence the appellant to undergo\n\nreformative training. In doing so, the judge rightly recognised the fact that under s\n\n13(1), only the High Court or District Court may award the sentence of reformative\n\ntraining. However, the judge fell into error in thinking that he held the sentencing\n\npowers of a District Court due to his concurrent appointment as a district judge, even\n\nthough he was acting in the capacity of a magistrate in the present case. InPP v Nyu\n\nTiong Lam & Ors[1996] 1 SLR 273, it was decided that a district judge acting in\n\nthe capacity of a magistrate only held the sentencing powers of a Magistrate’s Court.\n\nThe reason is that when the prosecution classifies a case as a ‘Magistrate Arrest\n\nCase’ (\"MAC\"), as in the present case, it is tacitly invoking the\n\njurisdiction of a Magistrate’s Court. It is irrelevant that the judicial officer who\n\nhears the MAC happens to be a district judge. Otherwise, it will be grossly unfair to an\n\naccused, who may have chosen to plead guilty on the understanding that a \"MAC\"\n\nclassification means that the sentencing limits of a Magistrate’s Court applies.8        The correct course of\n\naction for the judge to take in this case was to commit the appellant in custody for\n\nsentence by a District Court under s 13(2) CPC. If the District Court, upon inquiring into\n\nthe circumstances of the case, is also satisfied of the matters mentioned in s 13(1) CPC,\n\nit may then proceed to sentence him to reformative training under s 13(3)(a) CPC. It is\n\nnot within the powers of a Magistrate’s Court to sentence the appellant to undergo\n\nreformative training without going through the District Court.9        The judge has therefore\n\nexceeded his sentencing powers. In my opinion, this was an appropriate case for the High\n\nCourt to exercise its powers of revision, as conferred by s 268(1) CPC. One of the\n\npurposes behind conferring powers of revision on the High Court is to ensure that any\n\nsentence awarded by lower courts falls within their sentencing jurisdiction. This appears\n\nclearly from s 266(1) CPC which reads as follows:266 –(1) The High Court may call for and examine\n\n    the record of any criminal proceeding before any subordinate court for the purpose of\n\n    satisfying itself as to thecorrectness, legality or propriety of any finding,\n\n    sentenceor order recorded or passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings\n\n    of that subordinate court. [Emphasis added]10        Towards this end, s 268(1)\n\nspecifically provides that the High Court, under its revisionary jurisdiction, may\n\nexercise any of the powers under s 256 CPC which is otherwise exercisable only upon an\n\nappeal. Section 256(b)(i) in turn provides that the High Court has the power to:…reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or\n\n    discharge the accused ororder him to be retried by a court of competent\n\n    jurisdictionor committed for trial; [Emphasis added]As will be clear by now, the court of competent jurisdiction in the\n\npresent case to award reformative training is the District Court, and not the\n\nMagistrate’s Court. Therefore, under the powers of revision conferred by s 268(1)\n\nCPC, read with s 256(b)(i), I ordered the sentence of reformative training to be set aside\n\nand the case remitted to the Magistrate’s Court for the Magistrate’s Court to\n\ncommit the appellant in custody for sentence to a District Court under s 13(2) CPC.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeRepublic of SingaporeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
