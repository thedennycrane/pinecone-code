        "Raffles Junior College": "4          In the Raffles Junior College project, the only evidence relating to the alleged breach of the contract was the evidence that there were some stains on the glass supplied and installed by the plaintiff. While the evidence also showed that the stains consisted of a “white powdery substance”, it also showed that the stains had been cleaned off and had not recurred since. The claim was made only because, as counsel conceded, the defendant wanted a warranty that such stains would not recur. The plaintiff refused to provide the warranty. No one knows whether the stains would recur because there was no evidence as to what the stains were. Mr Pillai informed me that they were a white powdery substance but that was not sufficiently helpful. Furthermore, the warranty sought was a post-contract warranty and the plaintiffs were not obliged to give such a warranty. I am of the view that there was no merit in this counterclaim.",
        "UMCI": "5          It was not disputed that the defendant did not plead particulars of the defects alleged in the UMCI project. In the absence of specific pleadings, the defendant adduced evidence that the defects were in fact de-lamination of the glass supplied. Initially it claimed a sum of $106,860 being the cost of replacement. However, it then amended the claim to $74,031.81. There was little, if any, evidence to establish that there was indeed a problem of de-lamination, and, if so, to what extent the glass was affected. There was inadequate evidence other than the bare assertion that the defects were found in the glass when it was delivered to the defendant. Neither the architect nor the quantity surveyor testified as to what the defects were that resulted in the architect’s direction that some of the glass be replaced. There was no evidence which identified that the defects in question were due to de-lamination as opposed to broken or damaged glass for which the plaintiff would not have been liable. The purchase orders for replacement adduced by the defendant referred to such broken and damaged glass. It was therefore required to identify which were broken, or damaged, and which were de-laminated. I am not satisfied that the defendant had proved its case on the counterclaim for this project.",
        "Yishun Church": "6          The same points relating to the UMCI project, also apply to the Yishun Church project. In this project, the defendant amended its claim from $114,000 to $75,453 without explanation. I am unable to ascertain which of the glass panels the two figures relate to. It is not known which of the glass panels were affected. The pastor or other representative of the church whom the defendant said had spotted the de-lamination was not called to testify. It is not sufficient to claim that glass panels were damaged without identifying the damaged pieces and the actual damage. The supplier is entitled to know if he was responsible for the damage if it had, in fact, occurred. The correspondence showed that there was a dispute as to what the actual cause of de-lamination was. No conclusive determination was subsequently made. Hence, all that I could find was that the client had complained to its architect of water seepage and the complaint was directed by the architect to the defendant, who then blamed it on the plaintiff. I am not able to say that the seepage was caused by defective glass supplied by the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s supplier, Best Safety-Glass MFG (S) Pte Ltd, wrote on 16 October 2003 to say that the defect was due to the design of the structure and not inherent in the glass. There was no evidence to refute this sufficiently. I would therefore dismiss the counterclaim in respect of this project.",
        "Seagate": "7          The claim as to the defect in the Seagate project was that 428 pieces of the spandrel glass supplied were distorted beyond the internationally accepted tolerance level. There was, remarkably, no evidence of either the defective glass or the distorted glass, save for the oral testimony of the defendant’s witness, Ramesh. His evidence was to the effect that he knew what distorted glass was like. Perhaps he was qualified to tell whether there was distortion in glass, but in a claim for damages, such evidence requires some tangible proof such as photographs, for example, so that an accurate identification and itemisation of the pieces affected can be made. Furthermore, there was also no evidence that the distortion was beyond the accepted tolerance level – no evidence was led to show what that was. Hence, the defendant made a late attempt to put in a report made by SETSCO, but I rejected that report because it was sprung in the midst of trial. If that was permitted, the plaintiff would be entitled to challenge the report and that, in turn, would re-open the entire case because the pleadings might have to be amended and the identification of the affected glass made and rebutted. I am not convinced that there was any prejudice because this was evidence that the defendant had and ought to have pleaded and produced before the trial. The defendant had to stand or fall by the case it presented. The counterclaim for this project, therefore, also failed. 8          For the reasons above, the plaintiff’s claim was allowed and the defendant’s counterclaim was dismissed."
