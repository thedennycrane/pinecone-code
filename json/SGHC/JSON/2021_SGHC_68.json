        "Introduction": "1 The accused, Ahmed Salim, a 32-year-old male Bangladeshi national, was tried before me for the murder of one Nurhidayati Bt Wartono Surata (“Yati”). At the end of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proven its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I convicted the accused on the charge of murder and imposed the mandatory death sentence on him. The accused has appealed against his conviction and I now set out below the grounds of my decision. 2 The charge on which the accused was tried read as follows: That you, … on 30 December 2018, sometime between 5.15 p.m. and 8.15 p.m., in Room 307 of the Golden Dragon Hotel located at No. 61 Westerhout Road, Singapore 397662, did commit murder of one Nurhidayati Bt Wartono Surata, Female / 34 years old, with the intention of causing death, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 300(a) punishable under s 302(1) of the Penal Code (Cap [224], 2008 Rev Ed).",
        "Facts": "3 It was not disputed that the accused killed Yati on the evening of 30 December 2018 at the Golden Dragon Hotel located at No. 61 Westerhout Road, Singapore 397662 (“the Hotel”). The facts of the relationship between the accused and Yati were also not contentious for the most part. I will first set out the key elements of the factual narrative, which are primarily based on the Agreed Statement of Facts filed jointly by the parties and, where necessary, supplemented by the evidence adduced at trial.",
        "Background": "4 At the material time, the accused was employed as a painter by Ferh International Pte Ltd (“Ferh”) and stayed at a dormitory at 500 Old Choa Chu Kang Road, Sungei Tengah Lodge, Singapore 698924 (“the Dormitory”). Yati, a female Indonesian national, was working as a domestic helper at the material time.1Foot Note 1×Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”), paras 1–2. 5 The relationship between the accused and Yati began sometime in May 2012. They met on alternate Sundays and had sex about once a month.2Foot Note 2×ASOF, para 3.The accused’s evidence was that he would give Yati about $50–$100 every month; and in addition, he bought her various things and even helped to pay off her debts and loans.3Foot Note 3×Agreed Bundle of Documents (“AB”) vol 2, p 966, para 9; p 979, para 15; pp 990–991, para 62.In his words, “[t]he clothes she was wearing, all the things she had in her room, everything was given by me, bought with my money … whatever a person gives to his wife, I did the same”.4Foot Note 4×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 18 lines 27–29. 6 The relationship between the accused and Yati developed and, in November 2017, they agreed to get married in December 2018.5Foot Note 5×ASOF, para 3.Although they had not yet gotten married, the accused testified that he regarded his relationship with Yati as that of “husband and wife” and that they had promised to be faithful to each other.6Foot Note 6×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 17 lines 6–15. 7 Sometime in May or June 2018, Yati started dating one Shamim Shamizur Rahman (“Shamim”), a Bangladeshi plumber working in Singapore. They would meet about once a month on Sundays. As the accused would call Yati every day,7Foot Note 7×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 44 line 10.he began to suspect that she was seeing someone else when she became uncontactable one Sunday. He confronted her and she admitted that she was in a relationship with Shamim. Following the confrontation, the accused asked his mother and his friend to help him look for a wife in Bangladesh. His mother found him a potential wife and arranged for his marriage in Bangladesh in February 2019.8Foot Note 8×ASOF, para 4. 8 The accused and Yati reconciled sometime in July or August 2018 and resumed their meetings on alternate Sundays. They continued dating each other even after the accused informed Yati about his upcoming arranged marriage. Both of them continued to argue over Yati’s relationship with Shamim. On one occasion, when they argued over Yati’s relationship with Shamim, the accused pressed a towel over Yati’s mouth. He released the towel when she started to struggle. Frightened, Yati apologised to the accused.9Foot Note 9×ASOF, para 5; 2AB982, para 24. 9 Sometime in late October 2018 and early November 2018, Yati got to know one Hanifa Mohammad Abu (“Hanifa”) on Facebook. Hanifa was a Bangladeshi working in Singapore as a general fitter. About a week later, he and Yati started meeting each other every Sunday morning; and they had sex within three weeks of getting to know each other. Yati admitted to Hanifa that she was in a relationship with the accused and told him that the accused had an arranged marriage in Bangladesh. She also sent Hanifa a screenshot of the accused’s WhatsApp profile. Yati promised Hanifa that she would end her relationship with the accused, and she and Hanifa continued dating.10Foot Note 10×ASOF, para 6. 10 On 9 December 2018, the accused once again suspected Yati of seeing someone else when he could not contact her. That night, Yati called the accused. She revealed to him that she had a new boyfriend (ie, Hanifa) and told him to return to Bangladesh for his arranged marriage. The accused asked to meet Yati on 23 December 2018 and she agreed.11Foot Note 11×ASOF, para 7; 2AB980, para 19. 11 On 23 December 2018, the accused and Yati checked into a room at the Hotel. Yati told the accused that she did not meet Hanifa in person and that she would continue to meet the accused. However, this was untrue as she had met Hanifa in the morning prior to meeting the accused on 23 December 2018.12Foot Note 12×2AB916–917, para 5.She also repaid a loan of $500 to the accused. After they parted ways, Yati called the accused that same evening to break up with him. He persuaded her to meet him at the Hotel for a final time on 30 December 2018.13Foot Note 13×ASOF, paras 8–9.",
        "The events on 30 December 2018": "12 On the morning of 30 December 2018, the accused withdrew nearly all of his savings from a teller machine near the Dormitory, leaving only $37 in his bank account.14Foot Note 14×ASOF, para 10; 3AB1028–1029.He had a rope with him in the pocket of the trousers that he wore to meet Yati,15Foot Note 15×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 14 lines 11–12.but as will be seen, the Prosecution and the Defence provided sharply differing reasons for this. 13 The accused met Yati at the block where she stayed with her employer at around 4pm. They took a taxi to Paya Lebar for Yati to collect facial cream from her friend. They then took a train from the Paya Lebar Mass Rapid Transit (“MRT”) station to Aljunied MRT station and made their way to the Hotel.16Foot Note 16×ASOF, para 11. 14 After paying $40 for a three-hour stay, the accused and Yati checked into room 307 of the Hotel (“the Room”) at around 5.15pm. They had sex for the first time that night and remained naked thereafter. The accused attempted to convince Yati to break up with Hanifa but to no avail. She also refused to let the accused check her mobile phone.17Foot Note 17×ASOF, para 12; transcript of 22 September 2020, p 10 line 21 to p 12 line 6.The accused wrapped a bath towel around her neck for the first time that night and threatened to kill her if she continued dating Hanifa and if she did not allow him to check her phone.18Foot Note 18×2AB993, para 73.However, he then released the towel and they had sex again. 15 The accused provided starkly different accounts in his statements and in his oral testimony as to what happened thereafter. According to his statements and his interviews with the psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) Dr Christopher Cheok (“Dr Cheok”), after he and Yati had sex for the second time, Yati told him that it would be the last time that they would meet. He then wrapped the towel around her neck for the second time that night. Yati was not cowed by the accused’s threat to kill her and told him: “If you want to kill me, kill me. With you, this is my last meet. I don’t want to see you again and I will not leave [Hanifa].”19Foot Note 19×2AB983, para 27; 3AB152–154; transcript of 22 September 2020, p 11 line 28 to p 12 line 7.Upon hearing this, the accused tightened the towel around her neck. 16 At trial, however, the accused said that after they had had sex for the second time that night, Yati told him: “You do sex with me … means you do sex with your mother.” He allegedly responded by wrapping a towel around his hand and pressing the towel against Yati’s mouth. He then removed his hand and told Yati: “Because of … a man, you are saying all these bad things about me and my mother. Then let me call [Hanifa].” He tried to get Yati’s phone in order to check the contents thereof and to call Hanifa.20Foot Note 20×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 22 line 11 to p 25 line 9. 17 The accused also testified at trial that it was at this juncture that Yati told him: “[Hanifa] is better than you. He is better than you in the hotel … he is better in bed … he is better financially. If you don’t believe … next week I will go with him, will make a video and show you”21Foot Note 21×3AB23.(“the Humiliating Words”).  According to the accused’s testimony at trial, he was provoked by the Humiliating Words and lost his self-control; and this was why he proceeded to strangle Yati. 18 The Prosecution disputed that Yati had uttered these Humiliating Words to the accused on 30 December 2018 and pointed out,inter alia, that these words had never once been mentioned in the accused’s statements. 19 In any event, the accused did not (for the most part) dispute the account he had given in his investigative statements of the acts he had carried out in killing Yati.  He wrapped the towel around Yati’s neck and tightened it. He then stepped on one end of the towel and pulled at the other end.22Foot Note 22×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 51 lines 28–30.Yati became motionless soon after and the accused removed the towel from her neck. The accused then retrieved the rope which had been in his trouser pocket and tied it around Yati’s neck.23Foot Note 23×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 13 line 8 to p 14 line 14.He tightened the rope and tied “about two or three knots” with it.24Foot Note 24×2AB983, para 29. 20 Thereafter, the accused also pressed a towel over Yati’s mouth for about ten to 15 seconds with considerable force25Foot Note 25×2AB999, para 90.and observed that her face had turned blackish.26Foot Note 26×2AB999, para 90.Finally, he twisted her head from left to right with “a force of about 6–7, out of the spectrum [to] 10 where 1 [was] the least force used and 10 [was] the most force used”.27Foot Note 27×2AB999, para 91.It should be noted that in his investigative statements, the accused explained that he had strangled Yati with the rope and twisted her head from left to right in order to ensure that she would not survive.28Foot Note 28×2AB983, para 28; 2AB999, para 91.In his oral testimony at trial, however, the accused’s account was that he did so purely to stop a sound that he heard coming out from Yati’s mouth.29Foot Note 29×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 53 line 3 to p 54 line 15. 21 The accused proceeded to take a shower as he was sweating.30Foot Note 30×2AB995, para 79.He also put Yati’s clothes back on her body as he did not want anyone else to see her naked. He then placed her on her left side, covered her with a blanket and left the Room.31Foot Note 31×2AB995–996, para 81. 22 At around 8.15pm, the accused went to the Hotel reception to extend the room booking. He haggled with the hotel staff over the price of extending the room booking and eventually paid $30 for a two-hour long extension.32Foot Note 32×Transcript of 15 September 2020, p 121 line 27 to p 123 line 11.Thereafter, he left the Hotel and bought a can of “Red Bull” at a provision shop nearby.33Foot Note 33×ASOF, para 14. 23 The accused then returned to the Room. He observed that Yati was in the same position that he had left her. He took all her cash amounting to around $30, her mobile phone and her ez-link card, switched off the air-conditioner and lights in the Room, and left the Hotel.34Foot Note 34×ASOF, para 15. 24 That night, the accused also spoke to Hanifa on the phone several times.35Foot Note 35×ASOF, para 16.Hanifa testified that he had tried to call both Yati’s and the accused’s phone numbers that night, and that he knew that the accused was holding onto Yati’s phone.36Foot Note 36×Transcript of 15 September 2020, p 114 line 9 to p 115 line 15.In these exchanges, the accused persistently interrogated Hanifa about his relationship with Yati. Hanifa testified that the accused sounded “angry” and that he “talked in a loud voice”.37Foot Note 37×Transcript of 15 September 2020, p 115 lines 16–21.",
        "The arrest of the accused": "25 The accused called his colleague and roommate, Khalik Md Abdul (“Khalik”), twice at about 8pm and 8.45pm, to ask for Khalik’s whereabouts. Khalik informed the accused that he was at a provision shop within the Dormitory.38Foot Note 38×2AB930, para 3.Shortly thereafter, the accused returned to the Dormitory and bought some food at the canteen. He then handed $1,000 in cash to Khalik, who agreed to help the accused remit the money to the accused’s father in Bangladesh.39Foot Note 39×2AB930, para 4.The accused told Khalik that he had killed someone.40Foot Note 40×ASOF, para 17. 26 The accused then told his roommates that he would be returning to Bangladesh and offered them the food that he had earlier bought at the canteen. He also offered food to others in the neighbouring room. After talking to his colleagues, the accused took a shower and left the Dormitory. He loitered around Geylang before checking into Kim Tian Hotel (Han) located at 29 Lor 4 Geylang, Singapore 399281, at around 2am the next morning. He checked out of the hotel at around 5am and loitered in a park at Boon Lay.41Foot Note 41×ASOF, para 18. 27 At around 9am, the accused sent a WhatsApp message to one Zoe Lau (“Zoe”), who was in charge of human resource matters at Ferh. He told Zoe that he needed to return to Bangladesh that very day as he had some problems back at home. At Zoe’s direction, the accused called Ferh’s owner, Fadhillah bin Sahamat (“Fadhillah”), and requested to return to Bangladesh that day. Fadhillah told the accused to go to the Ferh office to discuss the matter.42Foot Note 42×ASOF, para 19.Unbeknownst to the accused, the police had already been in touch with Fadhillah by then. When the accused arrived at the Ferh office at around 10.45am, he was arrested by the police officers who were waiting in the office.43Foot Note 43×ASOF, para 20.",
        "The discovery of Yati’s body and the autopsy": "28 At about 10.15pm on 30 December 2018, Mr Lee Peng Yuan (“Mr Lee”), the Hotel receptionist, called the Room as the two-hour extension had expired. As nobody answered the call, Mr Lee went to the Room. He knocked on the door but received no response. He then unlocked the door and entered the Room with a duplicate key.44Foot Note 44×ASOF, para 21. 29 Mr Lee saw Yati lying on the bed. He tried waking her up but she remained unresponsive. He then left the Room and called the police at around 10.45pm. 30 Paramedics from Paya Lebar Fire Station were dispatched to the Hotel. At about 10.53pm, the paramedics arrived at the Hotel and went to the Room. One of the paramedics, Paramedic Sergeant Nabilah binte Sadali (“W/Sgt Nabilah”), saw Yati lying on her side on the bed, covered in a blanket up to her shoulders. When the paramedics removed the blanket, they observed Yati to be unresponsive.  There was a towel stained with blood next to her. W/Sgt Nabilah checked Yati’s body and observed that there was blood coming out of her nose and left ear, and that her face was swollen. She also felt the rope tied around Yati’s neck.45Foot Note 45×ASOF, paras 23–25.Yati was pronounced dead at 11.02pm. 31 On 31 December 2018, Dr Lee Chin Thye (“Dr Lee”), a Consultant Forensic Pathologist with the Health Sciences Authority, conducted an autopsy on Yati. When conducting an external examination of Yati’s body, he noted that there was a ligature, comprising a grey fabric rope measuring 0.5cm in thickness and approximately 100cm in length, around Yati’s neck. The rope had been wound a total of four times around her neck and a knot had been tied with the rope at the left side of the front of her neck.46Foot Note 46×1AB23–24.Dr Lee further noted that the only external injury to the body was a complex ligature mark around Yati’s neck,47Foot Note 47×1AB24–25.and that the ligature mark was consistent with the rope that had been found around her neck.48Foot Note 48×Transcript of 16 September 2020, p 86 lines 11–13. 32 Dr Lee found the cause of Yati’s death to be strangulation and cervical spine injury.49Foot Note 49×1AB27.He also testified that it was possible that Yati had been strangled with a towel before being strangled with the rope, given that strangulation with a towel would not leave much of a mark on the neck.50Foot Note 50×Transcript of 16 September 2020, p 86 lines 3–20.However, whether the cause of Yati’s death was strangulation with a towel or strangulation with a rope, it was undisputed that the accused had caused Yati’s death.",
        "The accused’s statements": "33 A total of five police statements were recorded from the accused and comprised: (a) a cautioned statement recorded on 31 December 2018 by Assistant Superintendent of Police Lee Tien Huat Chris, pursuant to s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”); and (b) four long statements recorded by Assistant Superintendent of Police Teo Ko Sing (“ASP Teo”) on 3 January 2019, 4  January 2019, 7 January 2019 and 8 January 2019 respectively, pursuant to s 22 of the CPC. 34 While the Defence did not contest the voluntariness of the accused’s statements, the accuracy of these statements became a bone of contention at trial. 35 The gist of the accused’s statements was that upon learning of Yati’s relationship with Hanifa on 9 December 2018, the accused had decided to kill her, and he had come up with a plan whereby he would kill her if she refused to leave Hanifa and to stay with him (the accused) until his departure for Bangladesh. In this regard, the accused’s statements contained numerous references to his having “decided” to kill Yati even before 30 December 2018, and certainly on 30 December 2018 when she refused to break up with Hanifa.51Foot Note 51×See,eg, 2AB981, para 20; 2AB983, para 27; 2AB993, para 71; 2AB995, para 80.The accused further elaborated in his statements that he had “chose[n]” to kill Yati with a rope because it was illegal to carry sharp weapons in public whereas it would be easy to keep the rope in his pocket;52Foot Note 52×2AB981, para 21.he had deliberately brought the rope along with him to the Hotel on 30 December 2018 for the purpose of killing her.53Foot Note 53×2AB992, para 67; 2AB993, para 72.The accused also stated in his cautioned statement that he “admitted to the charge” because “[he] did it out of anger, because [he had] proof that [Yati had] another relationship with another guy”.54Foot Note 54×2AB945.",
        "The Prosecution’s case": "36 The Prosecution’s case was that the accused had planned to kill Yati prior to 30 December 2018 and on as early as 9 December 2018, when he found out that Yati was dating Hanifa.55Foot Note 55×Prosecution’s closing submissions (“PCS”), para 25.He came up with an internal “algorithm” or “decision tree”: in gist, he decided that he would kill her if she refused to break up with Hanifa but that he would not do so if she agreed to end her relationship with Hanifa and to continue dating him until he returned to Bangladesh for his marriage.56Foot Note 56×PCS, paras 25, 26, 31, 78(c) and 102.He had arranged to meet Yati at the Hotel on 23 December 2018 in order to execute his plan to kill her, but did not do so on that day because she convinced him that she would continue seeing him and that she had not met Hanifa in person.57Foot Note 57×PCS, para 27(b).When Yati subsequently called the accused to break up with him after they had parted ways on 23 December 2018, the accused was infuriated and once again resolved to kill her. In persuading her to meet him for a final time at the Hotel on 30 December 2018, the accused had intended to kill her if she refused to end her relationship with Hanifa.58Foot Note 58×PCS, para 27(c).The accused had intentionally brought the rope along with him when he met Yati at the Hotel on 23 December 2018 and on 30 December 2018 in order to execute his plan to kill her if she did not agree to date him exclusively.59Foot Note 59×PCS, paras 27(c), 28(c) and 30(a); Prosecution’s reply submissions (“PRS”), paras 3–8. 37 In this regard, the Prosecution argued that the accused’s statements were accurate recorded – including those passages in which he had spoken of having “decided” to kill Yati prior to 30 December 2018 and on as early as 9 December 2018.60Foot Note 60×PRS, paras 9–17.The Prosecution also relied on the evidence of Dr Cheok, a Senior Consultant with the Department of Forensic Psychiatry of the IMH, in order to bolster its case of a premeditated killing.61Foot Note 61×PCS, paras 26 and 28; 3AB120, para 4. 38 While the Prosecution accepted that the accused was suffering from adjustment disorder (“AD”) at the time of the killing, they argued that he could not avail himself of the partial defence of diminished responsibility as his AD did not substantially impair his mental responsibility.62Foot Note 62×PCS, paras 67, 72 and 91.As for the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation, the Prosecution’s primary case was that the Humiliating Words – which the Defence relied on as the “provocation - were never uttered and were fabricated by the accused.63Foot Note 63×PCS, paras 36 and 92.The Prosecution further contended that, in any event, the Humiliating Words were not objectively grave or sudden64Foot Note 64×PCS, para 92.and that the accused had not been deprived of self-control at the time of the killing.65Foot Note 65×PCS, paras 95, 96 and 98.",
        "The Defence’s case": "39 In their closing submissions, the Defence said that the accused “did not intend to kill [Yati]”: according to the Defence, the Prosecution could not prove that the accused “intended to kill [Yati] beyond a reasonable doubt”, and the court was urged to “exercise its powers to convict the accused under section 300(c) of the [Penal Code] instead”.66Foot Note 66×Defence’s closing submissions (“DCS”), paras 4 and 91. 40 The Defence also relied on the partial defences of diminished responsibility and grave and sudden provocation. As for the former, the Defence cited the opinion of Dr Ung Eng Khean (“Dr Ung”), whom they called as their psychiatric expert.  In reliance on Dr Ung’s evidence, the Defence argued that the accused’s AD “significantly contributed to his offence by ‘making his emotions more labile (unstable) especially exacerbating his feelings of anger as well as reducing his self-control and impairing his judgment (leading to his making inappropriate choices’”.67Foot Note 67×DCS, para 73.As for the latter, the Defence contended that the Humiliating Words had indeed been uttered by Yati to the accused, that these Humiliating Words were objectively grave and sudden, and that they had caused the accused to lose self-control.68Foot Note 68×DCS, paras 36, 58–63 and 69; Defence’s reply submissions (“DRS”), paras 13 and 16.Additionally, the gravity of the Humiliating Words was amplified by the accused’s AD.69Foot Note 69×DCS, para 68.",
        "The issues to be determined": "41 It was not disputed that the accused had caused Yati’s death. As such, the following issues arose for my determination: (a) whether the accused had intended to cause Yati’s death; (b) whether the Defence had proven the partial defence of diminished responsibility on a balance of probabilities; and (c) whether the Defence had proven the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation on a balance of probabilities. 42 I address each of these issues in turn.",
        "Whether the accused intended to cause Yati’s death": "43 At the outset, it should be noted that in putting forward the broad proposition that the accused “did not intend to kill [Yati]”, the Defence was really saying two things.  Firstly, it was saying that the Prosecution had failed to prove themens rearequired for an offence under s 300(a) – namely, the intention of causing Yati’s death. This was why the Defence’s submissions concluded with the suggestion that the accused should be convicted of an offence under s 300(c) instead – which would have entailed a finding that the accused’s intention was only to cause bodily injury to Yati. Secondly, in saying that the accused “did not intend to kill [Yati]”, the Defence was also contending that the accused’s killing of Yati was not carried out in accordance with a “premeditated plan”.70Foot Note 70×PCS, paras 79(a) and 86. 44 I will first deal with the argument regarding the absence of any intention to cause death.  In considering this argument, it was important to bear in mind the physical acts which were carried out by the accused against Yati in the moments leading up to her death.  These were described by the accused in the investigative statements recorded by the police.  I noted of course that at trial, the accused disavowed all references in the investigative statements to any “decision” or “plan” on his part to kill Yati.  However, even shorn of these references, the accused’s description of the physical actsper sewas in my view highly instructive as to his intention in carrying out these acts.  In gist, he described two separate acts of strangulation: the strangulation performed with a towel, followed by the strangulation using the rope which had been inside his trouser pocket.  In addition to (and subsequent to) the two acts of strangulation, he also described how he had pressed down on Yati’s nose and mouth using a towel, and finally, how he had twisted her head from left to right.  He also described the steps he took in carrying out each of these acts and the degree of force he employed.  I set out below the passages from his statements in which the various physical acts were described, starting with the strangulation using the towel: (a) From the accused’s investigative statement of 4 January 2019:71Foot Note 71×2AB994–995. 77 I was seated beside her at her left when I rounded the towel twice on her neck.  I started to pull the towel when she challenged me to kill her.  While I was tightening the towel, I pushed her onto the bed … Once, she was in prone position on the bed. I used my right foot to step on one end of the towel onto the bed and I pulled upwards the other end of the towel with my two hands.  This was when I saw blood at one of ‘Yati’ ear [sic] … 78 On the spectrum of 1-10 of strength I applied to pull the towel, 1 as the least strength applied and 10 as the most strength applied.  When she was still in the sitting position, I pulled the towel at the strength of 4-5.  When she was in the prone position, I pulled the towel at the strength of 7-8.  When I saw blood coming out of ‘Yati’ ear, I pulled the towel at the strength of 10. 79 She was struggling when I pulled the towel.  ‘Yati’ kicked her legs and she was pulling the towel away from her neck with her two hands.  When I started to step on the towel and applied full strength, I saw she was unconscious shortly.  I removed the towel and I heard some sound coming from ‘Yati’ mouth.  When I noticed that some sound was coming out from ‘Yati’, I took the rope from my back pocket.  I rounded the rope around her neck for about 2-3 times.  I tightened the rope around her neck with the strength at 7.  I secured the rope with 2-3 knots.  I did not notice any bleeding flowing out from her ear. … (b) From the accused’s investigative statement of 7 January 2019:72Foot Note 72×2AB999. 90 … [A]fter I tied down the knots and before I put on ‘Yati’s’ clothings on her, I could still hear very low sound coming out from ‘Yati’s’ mouth or nose as suchI placed the towel over her face, andI pressed my right hand downwards on top of the towel around her mouth and nose region.  I applied a force of 10, out of the spectrum 10where 1 at the least force used and 10 as the most force used.I held my right[hand] for about 10 to 15 seconds before I let go of my hand.The sound stopped when I let go of my hand.  I removed the towel from her face … I did not observe any bleeding from ‘Yati’ at her face areas but I observed her face turned blackish. … 91 …[A]fter I pressed her mouth and nose downwards, I twisted ‘Yati’ head from left to right once and let go.  I applied a force of about 6-7, out of the spectrum 10where 1 at the least force used and 10 as the most force used. … [emphasis added] 45 Apart from the description given in his investigative statements, during a site visit and “scene re-enactment” at the Hotel on 7 January 2019, the accused also gave a demonstration to ASP Teo of how he had strangled Yati, first with the towel and then with the rope.73Foot Note 73×2AB955–959, paras 43–59; also 2AB1005–1012. 46 By and large, the accused’s description of the physical acts carried out against Yati in the moments leading up to her death was borne out by the forensic pathologist’s (ie, Dr Lee’s) findings as to the injuries sustained by Yati and the cause of her death.74Foot Note 74×1AB22–27.In the re-enactment he carried out for ASP Teo on 7 January 2019, the accused had demonstrated how he had placed the rope75Foot Note 75×This was referred to as a “string” by ASP Teo in her conditioned statement at 2AB958, but it was not disputed that the item referred to was the rope which the accused had kept in his trouser pocket.around Yati’s neck, crossed it behind her neck, then “rounded” it around her neck, and finally tied a series of knots in the rope.76Foot Note 76×2AB957–958, paras 53 and 54.In examining Yati’s body, Dr Lee noted that a ligature in the form of a grey fabric rope was found around her neck, tied as follows: it was wound a total of four times around her neck, “first wound twice around the entire neck, immediately over the skin and under the hair around the back of the neck”, “then wound twice around the entire neck, going over the hair around the back of the neck”, and “knotted with a granny knot measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm at the left side of the front of the neck”.77Foot Note 77×1AB23–24.Dr Lee also noted a “complex ligature mark” which was “present circumferentially around [Yati’s] neck, corresponding to the overlying ligature”.78Foot Note 78×1AB24.A dissection of the neck revealed the following injuries: haemorrhages in the thyrohyoid muscles bilaterally; pre-vertebral haemorrhage around the midline at the level of the C4/5 cervical vertebrae; dislocation of the C4/5 intervertebral joint; and extensive epidural haemorrhage within the cervical spinal canal.79Foot Note 79×1AB25.Dr Lee concluded that the cause of death was “strangulation and cervical spine injury”.80Foot Note 80×1AB27.None of Dr Lee’s findings was challenged by the Defence at trial. 47 Indeed, although at trial the accused denied vehemently having said anything about a “decision” or a “plan” to kill Yati, he did not disavow the bulk of the narrative he had provided in his statements about the physical acts carried out against Yati in the moments leading up to her death.  What he did dispute in cross-examination was, firstly, the number of times he had placed the towel around Yati’s neck before finally strangling her: in his statements, he described the strangulation as having taken place on the third occasion when he had placed the towel around her neck; in cross-examination, he claimed that he had placed the towel around her neck a total of four times and that he had only tightened the towel on the fourth occasion.81Foot Note 81×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 46 line 20 to p 47 line 30.In addition, he denied that he had committed the subsequent acts of strangulation with the rope, pressing on Yati’s mouth and nose, and twisting of her head because he thought that she was not yet dead and wanted to ensure that she would not survive: according to his oral testimony, by the time he came to use the rope, he already “thought she had died”.82Foot Note 82×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 51 line 28 to p 53 line 18. 48 Neither of the above objections went towards refuting the account given in his statements of the physical acts carried out against Yati in the moments leading up to her death.  In my view, the number, the nature and the sequence of these physical acts clearly demonstrated an intention to cause Yati’s death.  To put it bluntly, the accused visited multiple, successive acts of violence on Yati within a short span of time. This was not, moreover, a case of mere slaps or punches: he strangled her twice using two different implements, pressed down hard on her mouth and nose (“a force of 10, out of the spectrum 10”), and twisted her head from left to right.  He could not have intended anything else other than her death. 49      It should also be pointed out that although in his interviews with Dr Ung the accused denied having formed any plan to kill Yati prior to 30 December 2018, Dr Ung’s notes of the interview on 19 May 2020 recorded the accused as having said that he had “decided to kill [Yati] on 3rd time of strangling (on 30th December 2018)”.83Foot Note 83×3AB21.At trial, the Defence did not challenge the accuracy of this portion of Dr Ung’s notes. That the accused himself had admitted to having “decided to kill [Yati] on 3rd time of strangling (on 30th December 2018)” further supported the inference that his intention at the time of carrying out the physical acts of strangulation was to cause Yati’s death. 50 For the reasons set out in [44]–[49], I was satisfied that the accused’s intention at the material time was to cause death.",
        "Whether the accused’s killing of Yati was carried out in accordance with a “premeditated plan”": "51 In submitting that the accused “did not intend to kill [Yati]”, the Defence’s other contention was that the killing was not carried out in accordance with a premeditated plan.  According to the accused, he had merely “thought” about killing Yati prior to 30 December 2018 but had not formulated any real plan nor come to a firm decision to do so. Instead, he had simply lost all self-control and acted impulsively on 30 December 2018 upon hearing Yati utter the Humiliating Words to him in the Room. This version of events – as presented to Dr Ung and at trial – turned on two key factual propositions: firstly, that various statements documented in the accused’s police statements and in his interviews with Dr Cheok could not be relied on because he had never made those statements; and secondly, that the Humiliating Words had indeed been spoken by Yati to the accused on 30 December 2018.",
        "Whether the accused told the police in his investigative statements that he had decided to kill Yati": "52 I address first the accused’s claims about the statements recorded from him by the police.  The accused claimed that he had “never told [ASP Teo] and the Interpreter of his Section 22 CPC Statements that he ‘decided’ to kill [Yati]”.84Foot Note 84×DCS, para 8.In this connection, the accused came up with a number of allegations against Mohammad Zahurul Hasan (“Hasan”), who had acted as the Bengali interpreter for the recording of all five of his investigative statements.  According to the accused, Hasan spoke in a “very literary” and “well-educated” language; and the accused did not understand some of the words used by Hasan.85Foot Note 85×Transcript of 23 September 2018, p 8 lines 1–10.In particular, according to the accused, he had “never heard or used” the Bengali word for “decide” until Hasan used it.86Foot Note 86×Transcript of 23 September 2018, p 10 lines 1–8.In fact, he had not even realised the meaning of the word “decide” until his cell-mate at Changi Prison got hold of his statements.87Foot Note 87×Transcript of 23 September 2018, p 8 lines 12–23.The accused himself had never told Hasan that he had “decided” to kill Yati.  What he had said was that he had been “thinking” about whether to kill her after discovering her infidelity and asking himself how he should deal with her: it was Hasan who had used the word “decided” in interpreting what he (the accused) had said.88Foot Note 88×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 21 line 3 to p 22 line 25; p 31 lines 13–29. 53 Thus, for example, in paragraph 20 of his investigative statement of 3 January 2019, the accused was recorded as having said this:89Foot Note 89×2AB981. … On 9 December 2018, when [Yati] first told me that she had a new boyfriend,I decided that I wanted to kill her.[emphasis added] According to the accused, the italicised words were never said by him to Hasan or to ASP Teo.  Instead, what he had told Hasan was this:90Foot Note 90×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 22 lines 21–25. … [O]n 9th December, I was so angry.  I was very angry.  So I was telling myself,‘What should I do?  How should I deal with her?  Should I kill her? … [W]hat was the correct way to handle this?’ Whether I should slap her, should kill her, what is the correct way to handle her, I did not know.That’s what I told Mr Hasan.  [emphasis added] 54 I rejected the accused’s assertion that he had “never told [ASP Teo] and [Hasan] that he ‘decided’ to kill [Yati]”.  I found the accused’s evidence about what he had purportedly said to Hasan and about Hasan’s alleged errors in interpreting his statements to be entirely unbelievable.  My reasons were as follows. 55 Firstly, the evidence from Hasan91Foot Note 91×Transcript of 16 September 2020, p 26 lines 1–14.– which was not disputed – showed that at the end of the recording of each investigative statement, that statement would be read back and interpreted to the accused on the same day, and the accused would be asked if he wished to make any amendments.  It was also not disputed that on 3 January 2019, the accused had made various amendments to the investigative statement recorded from him that day. These were the handwritten amendments seen, for example, at paragraph 15 of the statement, wherein the accused had volunteered additional details about Yati’s spare phone and about how he had returned her the phone he had taken from her earlier.92Foot Note 92×2AB979.Similarly, on 4 January 2019, the accused also made various amendments to the investigative statement recorded from him that day, and these were again handwritten in the body of the said statement.  For example, the handwritten amendments at paragraph 67 of the statement of 4 January 2019 showed that the accused had volunteered additional details about the rope which was eventually used to strangle Yati.93Foot Note 93×2AB992.On 7 January 2019, the accused had also made amendments to the investigative statement recorded from him that day.  Thus, for example, the handwritten amendments at paragraph 98 of the statement of 7 January 2019 showed that the accused had volunteered additional details about how he had noticed blood stains on the towel – but not blood coming out from Yati – at the point when he started putting her clothing on her body and positioning her body on the bed.94Foot Note 94×2AB1001. 56 The accused did not deny that the handwritten amendments in his investigative statements were made at his request at the end of the recording of each statement.  In addition to being given the opportunity at the end of the recording of each statement to make amendments to that statement, the statement-recording on 4 January 2019 and on 7 January 2019 was preceded by Hasan reading back and interpreting to the accused the statement(s) recorded in the previous session(s), and ASP Teo asking the accused (through Hasan) if he wished to make any amendments to the previous statement(s).  This meant that on 4 January 2019, before any statement was recorded from the accused, the statement of 3 January 2019 was read back and interpreted to him; and he was asked if he wished to make any “correction, deletion or addition to it”.  Similarly, on 7 January 2019, before any statement was recorded from the accused, the statements of 3 January 2019 and 4 January 2019 were read back and interpreted to him; and he was asked if he wished to make any “correction, deletion or addition” to those statements.  This process was documented at the start of the statements of 4 January 2019 and 7 January 2019 respectively.95Foot Note 95×2AB987 and 2AB998.As for 8 January 2019, the accused refused to have his statements of 3 January 2019, 4 January 2019 and 7 January 2019 read back to him, and informed ASP Teo that he did not wish to make any correction, deletion or addition to those statements.96Foot Note 96×2AB1019. 57 On each occasion on 4 January 2019 and 7 January 2019, the accused requested to make various amendments to his previous statements.  In particular, on 4 January 2019, when his statement of 3 January 2019 was read back by Hasan and the accused was asked if he wished to make any correction, deletion or addition to that statement, he specifically requested to amend paragraph 20.  This was the paragraph with the sentence “I decided that I wanted to kill her”.  The accused requested that the following sentences be added at the end of paragraph 20:97Foot Note 97×2AB989, para 52. Every day, I received call from ‘Yati’ at 9.30pm.  After she had relationship with ‘Hanifi’, she did not call me.  When I tried to call her, I found her phone engaged until 11.30 pm.  All these made me angrier.  Basically, when I could not talk to her, I felt very angry. 58 It should be added that Hasan testified that the accused raised no complaints in the course of the recording of his statements.  Certainly he did not complain that he could not understand Hasan or that Hasan had misinterpreted parts of his statements.  Hasan’s testimony in this respect was not challenged by the Defence. 59 I found it telling that the accused had his statements read back to him several times, that he was presented with multiple opportunities to amend those statements, and that he did make amendments (including substantive amendments).  It raised serious questions as to why the accused did nothing about those parts of the statements in which he was recorded as saying he had “decided” to kill Yati.  Even more tellingly, when pressed to clarify exactly what he had said to Hasan and how Hasan had interpreted his statement back to him, the accused’s evidence became increasingly incoherent and unbelievable.  I take paragraph 20 of the accused’s statement of 3 January 2019 as an example.  In examination-in-chief, although he started by claiming that he had told Hasan he was “thinking” about what to do and whether to kill Yati, he shifted after a while to claiming that “[t]hese words came from … Hasan”.98Foot Note 98×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 31 line 23.According to him:99Foot Note 99×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 31 lines 16–29. [Hasan] asked me, ‘When did you think of killing Yati?’  My answer was, ‘December 9th.’  That time, he told me, ‘So you have decided to kill her.’  And I didn’t understand the big Bengali word and I said, ‘Yes.’ 60    In cross-examination, when the accused was asked what Bengali word Hasan had used for “decided” when reading the statement back to him, the accused prevaricated, initially claiming that he was “thinking of many things, particularly like [his] family” at the material time and that he “[did] not really remember what [Hasan] said because at that time, [he] did not really pay attention [to] what [Hasan] was saying”.100Foot Note 100×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 4 line 28 to p 5 line 18.This was despite his having said in examination-in-chief that Hasan had used “the big Bengali word” which he could not understand.  When it was pointed out to him that he had managed to make multiple amendments to the statement of 3 January 2019 and even to paragraph 20 itself, the accused’s testimony shifted again: he claimed that “[s]ometimes [he] heard [Hasan], sometimes [he] did not”; that “[s]ometimes [he] felt like talking, sometimes [he] didn’t feel like talking”;101Foot Note 101×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 9 lines 4–11.and that although he had made some amendments to that statement, “after a while [he] really got irritated” so he had told Hasan there was “[n]o need to read everything” back to him before signing off on the statement.102Foot Note 102×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 8 lines 17–28. 61 With respect, the above evidence made no sense, since it was clear that despite his avowed lack of interest in the contents of the statement being read back to him, the accused had nevertheless madesubstantiveamendments to various parts of the statement, including paragraph 20.  Indeed, in respect of paragraph 20, when this was read back to him on 4 January 2019, not only had he volunteered details of Yati’s failure to call him at night after she started a relationship with Hanifa and of his own anger at her behaviour (as noted at [57]), he had even added details about her trip to collect “two boxes of facial cream” from a friend on 30 December 2018 prior to their going to the Hotel.103Foot Note 103×2AB989, paras 51–52.Given his attention to detailvis-à-visthe contents of paragraph 20, it beggared belief that he should have failed to pay attention to the crucial sentence, “I decided that I wanted to kill her”. 62 It appeared that the accused realised the tenuous quality of the above evidence because when questioned further by the Prosecution, he suddenly asserted that Hasan had used the Bengali word “sirdhanto”, which meant “decide”.  Indeed, not only did the accused purport to recall Hasan’s use of the word “sirdhanto”, he was able to contrast this with the court interpreter’s use of the word “thik” (which the latter had explained was an “easier” Bengali word for “decided”) and to assert that he himself had used the Bengali word “bahapchi”104Foot Note 104×Misspelt as “papci” in the transcript of 24 September 2020, p 13 line 4.(translated by the court interpreter as “thinking”105Foot Note 105×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 29 line 29 to p 31 line 9.):106Foot Note 106×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 13 lines 1–5. [F]rom … your mouth [ie, the court interpreter], two words came out.  One isthik kora ci.  Another issirdhanto.  Hasan said, ‘Ami sirdhantoniyechi.’  And you [ie, the court interpreter] said ‘Ami thik kora[ci].’  And I said, ‘Ami papci[ie,bahapchi]’.  I always wanted to say, ‘Ami papci[ie,bahapchi].’  I do not know how this word got changed.  I do not know. 63  Having given the above evidence, when he was asked by me to confirm that Hasan had used the word “sirdhanto”, the accused appeared to baulk at providing such confirmation.  On the one hand, he appeared to retreat at one point to his earlier claims about not remembering what Hasan had said.  He also claimed that in fact, he did not know the two words “sirdhanto” and “thik” (as in “thik kora ci”), despite having – just moments prior - distinguished these two words from the word “bahapci” which he said he had used.107Foot Note 107×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 13 line 6 to p 14 line 5.On the other hand, he also subsequently claimed that where he was recorded as having said that he had “decided that [he] wanted to kill Yati” (paragraph 20 of the 3 January 2019 statement) and that he had “decided to kill her” (paragraph 27 of the same statement), “[t]he sentences were formed by [Hasan]”.108Foot Note 108×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 28 lines 14–17.When asked to clarify what he meant when he said these sentences had been “formed” by Hasan, he claimed – after much stalling and equivocation – that Hasan had asked him, “Have you decided that you wanted to kill her”, to which he had said “yes”.109Foot Note 109×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 28 line 19 to p 30 line 19.When asked why he had said “yes” if he had never used the word “decided” himself, he claimed that he had said “yes” because he did not know the meaning of the word “decided” and understood Hasan to be simply asking him if he had killed Yati.110Foot Note 110×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 30 lines 20–30. 64 In further cross-examination,111Foot Note 111×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 11 lines 3–27.the accused was referred to Question 5 in his statement of 4 January 2019, in which ASP Teo had focused specifically on the sentence in paragraph 20 of his 3 January 2019 statement, “On 9 December 2018, when she (‘Yati’) first told me that she had another  boyfriend, I decided that I wanted to kill her”, and asked him to “further elaborate on this”.  In response to ASP Teo’s request for further elaboration, the accused gave the following response:112Foot Note 112×2AB992. 67 I was inside my dormitory when I found out that ‘Yati’ got a new Bangladeshi boyfriend.  It happened on 9 December 2018 in the evening.  I was so angry and I told myself that I would kill ‘Yati’.  I looked around and found the rope that was near my bed. The rope could be found attached at the hood of the jacket.  It was soft, tough, and easy for me to keep the rope inside my pocket.  I knew that I could strangle her to death.  I chose the hotel because I would not be able to strangle her in other locations.  Besides, I had a plan to question her to see if she agreed with me or not.  I wanted her to promise me to break up with her boyfriend.  If she listened to me and broke up the relationship, I would not kill her.  I told myself that I would bring the rope with me and kill ‘Yati’ the next time we were in the Hotel. 68 I did not meet ‘Yati’ on 16 December 2018. I brought my rope with me on 23 December 2018.  On 23 December 2018, when we were in the hotel, she answered all questions and agreed with me that she would continue to meet me.  When I asked her about the new relationship, she told me that she did not meet [Hanifa] and they merely talked on phone and Facebook messenger.  So, I decided not to proceed with my plan as she did not make me angry. 69 On 30 December 2018, I met ‘Yati’ in the hotel.  She did not agree with me.  She did not want to break up with [Hanifa].  I strangled her to death. 65    Again, the accused’s responses in paragraphs 67–69 of his 4 January 2019 statement were telling, because ASP Teo had specifically drawn his attention to the sentence containing the words “I decided that I wanted to kill her”.  That he could have failed to notice at that juncture the use of the word “decided” again beggared belief.  Indeed, having had his attention drawn to the said sentence, he responded to the request for elaboration by supplying details of his “plan” – namely, to question Yati to see if she would agree to break up with her new boyfriend, and to kill her if she did not agree.  In other words, far from denying any decision to kill Yati, the accused’s response affirmed the earlier statement about his decision to kill her. 66 At trial, of course, the accused did not accept that he had said anything about a decision or a plan to kill Yati.  When he was asked how Hasan had interpreted the words “I decided that I wanted to kill her” when interpreting Question 5 to him, his answers became increasingly convoluted and unbelievable.  First, he claimed that Hasan had used the Bengali words for both “think” and “decide” when interpreting Question 5.  He claimed that he did not remember exactly whether Hasan had used the Bengali word “sirdhanto” or “thik” – but he appeared quite certain that the word “bhabso” was used by Hasan for “think”.  He even suggested that there were “many” Bengali words which could be used for the English word “think”.  However, when the Prosecution sought to get him to pin down the meaning of the Bengali word “bhabso”, he again shifted position and declared that he had believed all three words – “sirdhanto”, “thik” and “bhabso” – to “[mean] the same thing”.  On being questioned further by the Prosecution, his answers became entirely illogical as he vacillated between repeating that Hasan had used the Bengali word “bhabso” and denying any memory of what Hasan had said.  I set out below the relevant extract from the trial transcript:113Foot Note 113×Transcript of 24 September 2020, p 16 line 10 to p 19 line 10. Accused: How did he translated this question [ie, Question 5] to me, I do not fully remember.  I remember a little bit.  If you want me to tell you, I can tell you. … Accused: He told me, ‘When did you think that you will kill Yati?’  My answer was 9th December.  Then he again said on 9th – I do not exactly remember which Bengali word he said, whether it was ‘sirdhanto’ or ‘thik’ … But I didn’t understand it fully.  I didn’t think about it. I said yes. Court:  Sorry, you said yes in answer to what exactly? Accused: He said, ‘On that date, you decided to kill her?’  I said yes.  This is how the whole thing went. Court: … So what word did Hasan use for ‘think’ when he said, ‘When did you think you will kill Yati’? Accused: ‘Bhabso’.  This English word ‘think’ – how many Bengali words can be used for ‘think’. If you want to know, then all my problems will be solved. … Accused: He asked me in simple way, ‘When did youbhabsoto kill her?’  Then I said, ‘Yes, 9th December.’ DPP: What does the word ‘bhabso’ mean to you? … Accused: – ‘bhabso’, ‘thik kora’, ‘sirdhanto’, I thought all these words meant the same thing. DPP: … when [Question 5] was posed to you and interpreted by Hasan, the word that Hasan used was ‘bhabso’? You recall now that he used the word ‘bhabso’? Accused: All these words, he used.  So I used whatever word – I followed his words, whatever he used. DPP: … when Mr Hasan interpreted question 5 to you, how did he interpret the phrase or how did he interpret ‘I decided that I wanted to kill her’?  What word did he use to interpret ‘decide’ or ‘decided’? Accused: I told you earlier I do not exactly remember. DPP: So your answer is that you do not exactly remember, right? Accused: Yes, I do not remember. DPP: Right.  So earlier, when you said ‘bhabso’ when you said … Mr Hasan said ‘bhabso’, did he actually say ‘bhabso’ or is it the case that you can’t remember now? … Accused: … I had limited knowledge when he asked me.  He asked the question … like this in simple Bengali, ‘When did you think of killing her?’  He used the word ‘bhabso’.  If a simple Bangladeshi person asks you, ‘When did you think of killing a person?’, the simple word they used, ‘bhabso’, ‘cinta’ – they used those words – he used those words. Court: Sorry, ‘he used those words’, who used those words? Accused: People used those words but Hasan, exactly what word he used, I do not remember. 67 I have set out in some detail the accused’s evidence in order to illustrate the evasiveness he displayed as he flip-flopped between different – often opposing – positions.  In my view, the accused plainly appreciated that his attempt at trial to disavow all previous statements about having “decided” to kill Yati lacked credibility, given,inter alia, the many opportunities he had been given to amend and/or to elaborate on those previous statements. In consequence, he became extremely skittish about being pinned down to any definite account of how exactly those statements had been interpreted to him; and to resist nailing his colours to the mast (so to speak), he would jump from one position to another, alternating between proclaiming his inability to recall Hasan’s words and attributing all sorts of statements to Hasan.  In short, his story about having merely told Hasan he was “thinking” about killing Yati was precisely that – a story, made up as an afterthought, to explain away the incriminating portions of his statements. 68 Moreover, if in fact all that the accused had told Hasan was that he was “thinking” about whether to kill Yati, there was no reason for Hasan to convey to ASP Teo something entirely different.  From the accused’s own evidence at trial, assuming he had said in Bengali that he was “thinking”, he would have used either the word “bahapchi” or the word “bhabso”.  It was simply not possible that Hasan – a certified interpreter of 18 years’ standing – would have confused these Bengali words for “think” with the Bengali words for “decide” (“sirdhanto” or “thik”).  The Defence did not suggest to Hasan that he had somehow misheard the accused. 69 As for the suggestion that Hasan had used the word “decide” in posing questions to the accused and that the accused had simply said “yes” to his question without knowing what the word meant, I found this suggestion equally unbelievable.  I have explained earlier why I found the accused’s evidence in this respect to be riddled with inconsistencies and lacking in credibility.  It should also be noted that in cross-examining ASP Teo, Defence counsel had put it to her that every specific question she had asked of the accused during the statement-recording was recorded in the body of the relevant statement; and that if there were any other questions, they would have been merely of a clarificatory nature, along the lines of “You said this. I don’t understand what it means”.114Foot Note 114×Transcript of 16 September 2020, p 116 lines 10–15.According to the Defence’s case, therefore, it would have been Hasan himself (and not ASP Teo) who took the initiative to introduce the word “decide” into the recording process when the accused had never used the word at all and did not even know what it meant. In my view, this was an entirely baseless proposition.  The Defence did not suggest why – in the absence of any specific questions from ASP Teo as to whether or when the accused had decided to kill Yati – Hasan should have found it necessary to put such questions of his own to the accused. Certainly I could not see any reason why – as the interpreter – Hasan would have gone on such a frolic of his own and put words in the accused’s mouth. 70 For the reasons set out in [55]–[69], I did not believe the accused’s denial of a premeditated plan to kill Yati.  I found that the accused did indeed tell the police that as early as 9 December 2018, he had decided he wanted to kill Yati after learning of her new relationship (paragraph 20 of the 3 January 2019 statement); and further, that his plan was to ask her to break up with her new boyfriend – and to kill her if she did not agree (paragraph 67 of the 4 January 2019 statement).",
        "Why the accused brought the rope along with him on 30 December 2018": "71 The existence of such a plan was corroborated by the accused’s own admissions in his investigative statements as to why he had brought a rope along with him on 30 December 2018.  In his statement of 3 January 2019, the accused said that the rope “belonged” to one of his old jackets, and that although he had discarded the jacket long ago, he had kept the rope “to be used to tie [his] laundries together before washing”.115Foot Note 115×2AB981, para 21.He said at one point that he “chose to kill ‘Yati’ with a rope with no real reason”.116Foot Note 116×2AB981, para 21.However, he also explained that he “felt that rope was easy to keep in the pocket” and that he had concerns about “sharp weapon[s] like knife” which he knew were “prohibited to carry in public”.117Foot Note 117×2AB981, para 21.As noted earlier, when he was subsequently asked on 4 January 2019 to elaborate on his earlier statement (in paragraph 20 of the 3 January 2019 statement) that he had “decided that [he] wanted to kill [Yati]”, the accused disclosed that on 9 December 2018, when he became “so angry” on hearing of Yati’s new boyfriend and “told [himself] that [he] would kill [her]”, he had looked around and found the rope.  It will be recalled that he also explained118Foot Note 118×2AB992, para 67.that this rope was “soft, tough, and easy … to keep … inside [his] pocket”.   His plan was to kill Yati if she refused to leave her new boyfriend: he knew that he could strangle her to death, and he “told [himself] that [he] would bring the rope with [him] and kill ‘Yati’ the next time [they] were in the Hotel”.119Foot Note 119×2AB992, para 67.He did in fact bring the rope with him on 23 December 2018 but did not kill Yati that day because she agreed to continue seeing him and assured him that she did not meet with Hanifa.120Foot Note 120×2AB992, para 68.On 30 December 2018, however, she refused to break up with Hanifa, and the accused “strangled her to death”.121Foot Note 121×2AB992, para 69. 72 At trial, contrary to the account he had given in his investigative statements, the accused claimed that the presence of the rope in his pocket on 30 December 2018 was entirely fortuitous.  According to the accused, he had used the rope to tie his laundry on 9 December 2018.  While doing his laundry that day, he had been talking to Yati on the telephone and had become “very angry” upon hearing about her new boyfriend.  It was at that point that it “came to [his] head that [he] will kill her with that rope”.  He put the rope in his pocket after finishing his laundry.  The next day, he reconciled with Yati, and “everything was okay”.  He did not bother to remove the rope from his pocket, because in any event he “always” kept the rope in his pocket.  He wore the same pair of trousers (with the pocket containing the rope) when he went to meet Yati on 23 December 2018 and on 30 December 2018, because these were the trousers he “usually” wore: these trousers had “quite a number of pockets”, and he wore them for going out. Since he wore the same pair of trousers on 23 December 2018 and 30 December 2018, the rope “was with [him] as well” inside the pocket, but he “didn’t carry that rope to kill [Yati]” on 30 December 2018: it just so happened that the rope was “[a]lways in [his] pocket”.122Foot Note 122×Transcript of 22 December 2020, p 32 lines 2–27. 73 I did not believe the accused’s narrative at trial about why he had the rope with him on 30 December 2018.  My reasons were as follows.  Quite apart from the details which the accused himself had volunteered in paragraph 67 of his 4 January 2019 statement, in that same statement-recording session, ASP Teo had drawn his attention to his mention of the rope in paragraph 21 of his 3 January 2019 statement and had specifically asked him to elaborate on why he had taken a rope with him on 30 December 2018.123Foot Note 123×2AB992, Question 6.I reproduce below the accused’s response to ASP Teo:124Foot Note 124×2AB992–993. 70 Since 9 December 2018, I decided that I would bring with me the rope when I knew we would be going to a Hotel.  Usually, we would plan on Friday, and we would confirm if we were going to the Hotel on Saturday.  So, on Sunday, I would know that I need to bring the rope with me. 71 Between 23 December 2018 to 30 December 2018, I was quarrelling with ‘Yati’ everyday about [Hanifa].  At night, I tried to call ‘Yati’ but ‘Yati’ number was always engaged.  During the day time, I called ‘Yati’ and she received the call.  I asked her why she did not pick up my call.  I also asked her why she was closer with [Hanifa] and forgot me.  During this time, ‘Yati’ blocked my number and me in Facebook.  I was not sure if it happened on Thursday and Friday.  I contacted ‘Yati’s’ mother in Indonesia.  However, I was unable to speak Malay and her mother was unable to speak in English.  I then messaged ‘Yati’s’ sister to seek her help to get ‘Yati’ to contact me.  About half an hour later, ‘Yati’ called me.  ‘Yati’ said that our relationship had ended on 23 December 2018 when she paid me the last $500.  She also said that she had sex with me as per my request so everything was over.  I insisted to meet her and talk to me in person.  She agreed to meet up with me and she told me that it would be the last time we met.  I was very angry and I knew that I would kill her when I met her on 30 December 2018. 72 In fact, I wore the same pant and shirt on 23 December 2018 and 30 December 2018.  I did not remove the rope from my back pocket on 23 December 2018.  Although I did not remove the rope from my back pocket on 23 December 2018, I knew that the rope was inside my pocket when I was going to meet ‘Yati’ on 30 December 2018.  I deliberately chose the same set of attire so that I would bring the rope out with me. 74 Again, I found the above response telling because it was provided by the accused after his attention had been drawn by ASP Teo to the issue of the rope.  If the presence of the rope in his pocket on 30 December 2018 was merely fortuitous, one would have expected him to say so to ASP Teo.  He did not.  Indeed, reading the above response together with his response in the preceding paragraphs 67–69 of the same statement, it was clear that the rope played an integral part in his plan to kill Yati: he chose it because it was tough, yet easy to keep in his pocket; he knew he could strangle Yati with it; he planned to strangle her in a hotel; and he made sure to bring the rope with him whenever he knew he and Yati would be going to a hotel.  This was why he had the rope with him on 23 December 2018 and on 30 December 2018.  In other words, the fact that he had the rope with him on 30 December 2018 was the result of a considered decision: it was not a coincidence nor an accident of ill fortune. 75 At trial, the accused sought once again to blame Hasan for those portions of his statements which dealt with his possession of the rope.  According to the accused, he knew that he had killed Yati with the rope; he “didn’t want to explain everything” and “wanted to cut short the whole thing”:125Foot Note 125×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 32 line 28 to p 33 line 5. So whatever [Hasan] said about the rope, I said, ‘Yes, yes.’ And the question came from Hasan about the rope and I said, ‘Yes.’ 76  I found the accused’s explanation unbelievable.  His assertion that he had “wanted to cut short” the statement-recording – and that he had simply answered “Yes, yes” to whatever Hasan asked about the rope – was refuted by the contents of his investigative statements, which showed that he had taken the trouble to provide various details about the rope: for example, the fact that the rope had been part of an old jacket; the use he had habitually made of it when doing his laundry; the ease with which it could be kept in his pocket, as compared to a prohibited weapon such as a knife; and his decision to bring it with him after 9 December 2018 whenever he knew he and Yati would be going to a hotel.  These were details which Hasan could not have known, and which – even if Hasan had asked about the rope – could not have been conveyed via the brief answer “Yes, yes”.  They were details which had to have been volunteered by the accused himself.  The same reasoning would apply even if it was ASP Teo who had asked the accused (through Hasan) about the rope – although in this connection, I should add that it was never put to ASP Teo thatshehad asked the accused questions about the rope, nor were any such questions by her recorded in the statements. 77 Finally, the Defence argued that the fact that the accused had used a towel to strangle Yati showed that “the rope was not part of a pre-meditated plan to kill [Yati] with that particular item”.126Foot Note 126×DCS, para 23.With respect, this argument ignored facts which the accused himself had volunteered.  It was not disputed that there were two acts of strangulation – the first involving the use of the towel, the second involving the use of the rope.  According to the accused’s narrative, the rope was kept in the pocket of his trousers on 30 December 2018, just as it had been kept there on 23 December 2018.  At the point of the first act of strangulation, both the accused and Yati were naked.127Foot Note 127×2AB981, para 22.In other words, the accused did not have the rope close at hand at that point.  He did have the towel in his hand at that point, according to his narrative.  He had already “rounded” the towel around Yati’s neck twice – and at one point, even around his own neck – while trying to convince her to break up with Hanifa and to stay in a relationship with him (the accused) until his return to Bangladesh.128Foot Note 128×2AB982, para 26; 2AB993–994, paras 73–75.When she refused and when he told her “Today, I will kill you”, he was holding the same towel and he “rounded” her neck with it again.  He started to tighten the towel after she “challenged” him to kill her; and this was how he came to strangle her with the towel.129Foot Note 129×2AB994, para 75.In the circumstances, the use of the towel in the first act of strangulation was purely a matter of convenience: the towel was what the accused happened to have in his hands when Yati made the fatal decision to refuse once more his plea that they continue their relationship.  Significantly, when he decided to commit the second act of strangulation, he chose to do so with the rope, which he took from his trouser pocket; and from his own narrative, his use of the rope was not some hasty fumbling act but a deliberate one involving,inter alia, the “crossing” of the rope behind Yati’s neck and the tying of several knots.130Foot Note 130×2AB957–958, paras 53 and 54. 78 For the reasons set out in [73]–[77], I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the accused had brought the rope with him on 30 December 2018 as part of a premeditated plan to kill Yati.",
        "Whether the accused’s statements to Dr Cheok should be given any weight": "79 In addition to challenging the incriminating portions of his investigative statements in which he had spoken of his decision to kill Yati and his plan to use the rope, the accused also took issue with Dr Cheok’s interview notes.  The Defence’s main objections were in respect of certain parts of these interview notes in which Dr Cheok had recorded the accused relating to him a “plan” to kill Yati.  According to the Defence, no weight should be given to those parts of Dr Cheok’s interview notes because various defects in the interview process for all three interviews rendered the interview notes unsafe to rely on. In particular, the Defence objected to any weight being given to the following statements and comments recorded by Dr Cheok in his notes: (a) From the interview notes of 21 January 2019:131Foot Note 131×3AB152. He [ie, the accused] planned to take [Yati to a] hotel, he brought a rope with him to strangle her. … ‘I spent so much money’ ‘If she had waited 1 month for me to go home’ … He had planned to kill her; if she apologised and agreed to be in a relationship for 1 more month, he would not kill her … He had brought rope to the hotel in his pants pocket (b) From the interview notes of 25 January 2019:132Foot Note 132×3AB161. Q: When did you start to think about killing her A: About 9 Dec, I went to see her at her place in Serangoon.  On that day, she came down and started scolding me and spoke to me very angrily.  On previous occasions, she would embrace me.  On 9 Dec, I called her around 1 pm.  She did not pick up phone, I called many times and left voice messages.  I spoke vulgarities, ‘fucking woman’.  Then finally when I could not contact her at 7 pm I went to Serangoon.  I overheard she was talking to employer that someone is disturbing me ‘can I call the police’.  I started thinking of killing her in June 1x and July 1x and she cried and stopped seeing him and I stopped thinking about killing her.  On Dec 9, I started planning to kill her. … 80 The Defence argued that it was unsafe to rely on Dr Cheok’s notes because – according to the accused – Dr Cheok already had the accused’s police statements at the first interview on 21 January 2019;133Foot Note 133×Transcript of 18 September 2020, p 84 lines 19–22.Dr Cheok conducted nearly all of the first interview and at least half of the second interview in English without the Bengali interpreter being present;134Foot Note 134×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 50 lines 5–32; p 52 lines 9–12; DCS, paras 29–32; DRS, para 10.and Dr Cheok merely asked a few questions about the accused’s sleep while omitting to ask any case-related questions during the third interview.135Foot Note 135×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 52 lines 1–3; transcript of 23 September 2020, p 79 lines 22–32. 81 I found the Defence’s objections to Dr Cheok’s interview notes to be without merit. Notably, the accused’s allegations about the Bengali interpreter’s absence for the most part during these interviews were unsupported – indeed, controverted – by the objective evidence.  In respect of the first interview by Dr Cheok on 21 January 2019, the CAMS tracking report maintained by the prison authorities showed that Dr Cheok had arrived for the interview at the Changi Medical Complex at 1.57pm on that day, while the Bengali interpreter Md Sirajul Islam (“Sirajul”) had arrived at 2.18pm.  Subsequently, Sirajul had left at 3.44pm while Dr Cheok had left at 3.46pm.136Foot Note 136×Transcript of 25 September 2020, p 114 lines 3–16.The CAMS tracking report showed, therefore, that Sirajul had arrived soon after Dr Cheok’s arrival, and not towards the end of the interview as the accused claimed. Dr Cheok’s evidence was that the 21 minutes prior to Sirajul’s arrival would have been used as “some degree of administrative time” (escorting the accused to the interview room, uncuffing  him, getting him seated, cuffing him again and so on).137Foot Note 137×Transcript of 25 September 2020, p 114 line 17 to p 115 line 11.The formal interview would have started with his recording the accused’s personal particulars and explaining the purpose of the interview as well as the issue of confidentialityvis-à-visthe contents of the interview: Sirajul would have been present right from the start of the formal interview.138Foot Note 138×Transcript of 25 September 2020, p 129 line 8 to p 130 line 11.Dr Cheok’s evidence on this score was corroborated by Sirajul himself.139Foot Note 139×Transcript of 28 September 2020, p 8 line 31 to p 10 line 22.I should add that given the terminology which would have had to be explained to the accused when he was briefed about the purpose of the interview (“psychiatric assessment”, “Institute of Mental Health”, “confidentiality”,etc), I found it extremely unlikely that Dr Cheok would have attempted to explain the various terms to the accused in English.  At the same time, given the accused’s indisputably limited grasp of English, it was also extremely unlikely that Dr Cheok could have elicited all the information recorded in his interview notes without the assistance of an interpreter. 82 It should be pointed out that in making allegations about Sirajul’s absence on 21 January 2019, the Defence appeared to have misunderstood some of the evidence.  The Defence claimed that Dr Cheok’s interview notes for 21 January 2019 showed that Sirajul was only present at about 3.30pm.140Foot Note 140×DCS, para 29.This was a misapprehension of Dr Cheok’s notes.  In fact, Dr Cheok had clearly recorded in his notes that the interview commenced at 2pm, with Sirajul present as interpreter;141Foot Note 141×3AB144, under “Telephone No / Contact Person” and “Date of Clerking”.and that at 3.30pm on the same day, he had spoken via telephone with the accused’s mother in Bangladesh, again with Sirajul present as interpreter.142Foot Note 142×3AB158. 83 As for the second interview on 25 January 2019, the CAMS tracking report showed that Sirajul had arrived at 10.12am, slightly ahead of Dr Cheok who had arrived at 10.18am; and both of them had left at 10.53am.143Foot Note 143×Transcript of 25 September 2020, p 118 lines 23–30.Again, therefore, the CAMS tracking report supported Dr Cheok’s assertion that Sirajul was present for the entire interview.  This was confirmed by Sirajul himself.144Foot Note 144×Transcript of 28 September 2020, p 11 line 17 to p 13 line 18. 84 As for the third interview on 28 January 2019, the CAMS tracking report showed that Dr Cheok had arrived at 2.13pm and left at 2.43pm, while Sirajul had arrived at 2.29pm and left at 2.43pm.145Foot Note 145×Transcript of 28 September 2020, p 14 lines 7–22.Dr Cheok testified that the third interview would typically be shorter than the preceding two because by then, most of the information required for the psychiatric assessment would have been obtained.146Foot Note 146×Transcript of 25 September 2020, p 121 lines 24–28.Dr Cheok denied that he had merely asked the accused about his sleep without asking any case-related questions.  This was borne out by his interview notes, as these notes documented certain case-related information that Dr Cheok could not have known without asking the accused (for example, the fact that Yati had met Hanifa on Facebook).147Foot Note 147×3AB164. 85 Dr Cheok further denied having had the accused’s investigative statements during the interviews.  He produced in court the only summary of facts he had been provided with by the police prior to interviewing the accused.148Foot Note 148×Exhibit P133.This was a very brief document which mentioned five things: the discovery of Yati’s corpse in the Room; Yati’s and the accused’s brief personal particulars; the existence of a “romantic relationship” between them; the certified cause of Yati’s death; and the fact that the accused had been charged for the offence of murder.  I accepted Dr Cheok’s evidence.  If the police had in fact provided him with the accused’s investigative statements, it made no sense for them to give him concurrently the brief summary of facts: such a document would have been superfluous if Dr Cheok already had the investigative statements in hand.  In any event, if Dr Cheok really had been given the investigative statements by the police prior to his interviews with the accused, I did not see (and the Defence was unable to suggest) any reason why he should have felt it necessary to lie about it. 86 For the reasons set out in [81]–[85], I rejected the Defence’s submission that it was unsafe to rely on Dr Cheok’s interview notes. 87 Dr Cheok’s interview notes were relevant because,inter alia, they established that the accused had narrated to Dr Cheok a version of events largely similar to the version narrated in his investigative statements.  In particular, the accused had told Dr Cheok about his “plan” to bring Yati to the Hotel and to kill her if she refused to remain in the relationship with him until he returned to Bangladesh. As with the accused’s investigative statements, therefore, Dr Cheok’s interview notes supported the Prosecution’s contention that the accused’s killing of Yati was carried out in accordance with a premeditated plan. 88 Dr Cheok’s interview notes were also relevant to the determination of another important issue: namely, whether Yati had in fact spoken the Humiliating Words to the accused in the Room on 30 December 2018.  I next address this issue.",
        "Whether the alleged Humiliating Words were in fact spoken by Yati to the accused in the Room on 30 December 2018": "89 As I noted earlier at [51], the accused’s contention that he had killed Yati completely on impulse and not in accordance with any premeditated plan rested on two key factual propositions.  The first was that he had never told the police – or Dr Cheok – about a decision or a plan to kill Yati.  The second was that Yati had spoken the Humiliating Words to him in the Room on 30 December 2018.  I have explained why I rejected the first proposition.  I will now explain why I also rejected the second proposition. 90 To recap: in its closing submissions, the Defence identified the following as the Humiliating Words:149Foot Note 149×DCS, para 34; 3AB6. … he [ie, Hanifa] is better than you.  He is better than you in the hotel … he is better in bed … he is better financially.  If you don’t believe … next week I will go with him, will make a video and show you. 91 According to the accused, the Humiliating Words were the trigger for his actions in strangling Yati to death: when he heard her say these words, he “went crazy”, he “lost control”, his “mind [was] blank”, “he had the thought to kill her”150Foot Note 150×3AB6; 3AB21; 3AB23.– and that was precisely what he did. 92 Given the momentous impact which the Humiliating Words had on the accused, one would have expected him to mention Yati’s utterance of these words to the police and/or to Dr Cheok when he was interviewed by them.  Yet, as the accused himself admitted, he said nothing at all about the Humiliating Words to the police and to Dr Cheok.  It was not disputed that the first time he brought up Yati’s alleged utterance of the Humiliating Words was at his interview with Dr Ung on 19 May 2020151Foot Note 151×3AB21.– some 17 months after the killing of Yati.  The accused’s failure to make any mention of the Humiliating Words to the police and/or to Dr Cheok in the weeks following the killing struck me as being highly anomalous, and ultimately, fatal to his credibility, particularly since he was unable to provide any coherent explanation for the omissions. 93 In so far as his statements to the police were concerned, the accused came up with a few different answers when asked why he had not mentioned the Humiliating Words in any of these statements.  In respect of his cautioned statement,152Foot Note 152×2AB945.the accused claimed that the recording officer (ASP Lee Tien Huat Chris, “ASP Lee”) had told him that he was “stupid” to have killed “the girl” (ie, Yati), and that now his “life go away”.153Foot Note 153×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 35 line 9 to p 36 line 28.The accused thought that in saying this, ASP Lee “was feeling bad for [him] because [he] was going to die”; and that since he was “going to die”, he would not mention the Humiliating Words in giving his cautioned statement.154Foot Note 154×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 36 line 27 to p 37 line 18.Secondly, he thought that ASP Lee “might get annoyed, angry” if he mentioned “all these things”, so he decided to “be precise” and “say whatever [he] wanted to say” in “a shortcut way”.155Foot Note 155×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 37 lines 14–18. 94 I found the accused’s explanationsvis-à-vishis cautioned statement glib and lacking in credibility.  The accused himself had described ASP Lee as having spoken to him in a “very kind” and “nice” manner during the statement-recording.156Foot Note 156×Transcript of 22 September 2020, p 8 line 12 and p 9 line 26; transcript of 23 September 2020, p 29 line 18 to p 30 line 13.It seemed to me quite unbelievable that the “kind” and “nice” ASP Lee should have taken it upon himself to admonish and alarm the accused by telling him that he was “stupid” and that his life would “go away”.  Furthermore, there was simply no reason for ASP Lee to admonish and alarm the accused in this manner: he had no connection with the case other than having been requested to record the cautioned statement from the accused, and he was not aware of the details of the case – not even that a rope had been used.157Foot Note 157×Transcript of 16 September 2020, p 92 lines 7–10 and 16–23.Defence counsel himself put it to ASP Lee that it was not his job to elicit more details from the accused during the recording of the cautioned statement: his job was just to record whatever the accused said to him.158Foot Note 158×Transcript of 16 September 2020, p 98 lines 17–21; p 99 lines 4–5.In the circumstances, it would have made no sense for ASP Lee to make any comments to the accused about his actions. 95 In any event, even assuming that ASP Lee had somehow taken it upon himself to tell the accused that he was “stupid” and that his life would “go away”, there was no logical connection between these comments and the accused’s alleged decision to refrain from mentioning the Humiliating Words in his cautioned statement.  When the accused was asked to explain what one had to do with the other, he could not provide any explanation and ended up merely repeating, “I was going to die”.159Foot Note 159×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 37 lines 9–14; p 38 lines 22–23.I should add that it did not appear to me the accused meant by this statement that he had fatalistically decided it was futile to say anything of importance in his cautioned statement.  Indeed, despite having allegedly concluded that he “was going to die”, he had still found it necessary to state in his cautioned statement that he had proof of Yati having had “another relationship with another guy”, that he had “spent a lot of money on her” and that she had “cheated” on him.160Foot Note 160×2AB945. 96 As for the accused’s claims about having been afraid to anger ASP Lee by saying too much, this appeared to me to be just as unbelievable as his claim about ASP Lee calling him “stupid”.  As noted above, Defence counsel had put it to ASP Lee that his job was simply to record whatever the accused said: it was not put to ASP Lee that he had tried to cut the accused off in the course of his narrative.  Not was it put to ASP Lee that he had given the accused the impression he was required to give his cautioned statement in a “shortcut way”.  There was no reason, therefore, why the accused should have felt apprehensive about mentioning details such as the Humiliating Words.  Indeed the contents of the accused’s cautioned statement disproved his allegations about having been afraid to say too much.  As noted above, the accused had sought to explain the killing of Yati by saying that he had done it “out of anger, because [he had] proof that she ha[d] another relationship with another guy” and she had “cheated” on him after he had “spent a lot of money on her”.  He had also given details of how he strangled Yati first with a towel and then with a rope.  It did not appear to me that he felt in any way constrained in what he could say or how much he could say. 97 For the reasons set out in [94]–[96], I rejected the accused’s explanations for why he omitted to mention the Humiliating Words in his cautioned statement. 98 In respect of his investigative statements, the accused said he had two reasons why he did not mention the Humiliating Words to ASP Teo.161Foot Note 161×Transcript ot 23 September 2020, p 57 lines 7–19.First, he claimed that he did not mention the Humiliating Words to ASP Teo “because she was a lady” (to which he subsequently added, “[s]he looked like my girlfriend”); and he felt that it would not be nice to say such things to a lady.162Foot Note 162×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 57 lines 20–29.Second, the accused claimed that he did not mention the Humiliating Words because he “was going to die”:163Foot Note 163×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 56 lines 1–17 and p 57 lines 18–19.according to him, although he had thought at one point of telling ASP Teo about the Humiliating Words when she asked him why he had killed Yati, he decided against it because164Foot Note 164×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 56 lines 16–17.– … I will die soon, what’s the point? 99 As with his reasons for not telling ASP Lee about the Humiliating Words, the accused’s stated reasons for not mentioning those words to ASP Teo also rang false.  First, I found it unbelievable that he was so fearful of offending a “lady” like ASP Teo that he could not bring himself to repeat the words.  After all, in recounting to ASP Teo the events of 30 December 2018, he had already told her about having sex with Yati twice in the Room, about their remaining naked in the Room even as they continued to quarrel over Yati’s relationship with Hanifa,165Foot Note 165×2AB981, para 22.and about Yati telling him after sex that “she was a prostitute”  and asking him “how much [he] could pay her”.166Foot Note 166×2AB993–, para 73.Given that he had felt able to mention all these things to ASP Teo without worrying about her taking offence, it was highly improbable that he would have suddenly developed concerns about her getting offended at hearing the Humiliating Words. 100 Second, I found it equally unbelievable that the accused refrained from mentioning the Humiliating Words because he thought he would “die soon”.  When he was asked to clarify why such a thought would have inhibited him from mentioning those words, his explanations were illogical and incongruous.  At one point in cross-examination, as noted earlier, he himself had said, “I decided not to [mention the Humiliating Words] because I will die soon, what’s the point”.167Foot Note 167×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 56 lines 15–17.He was asked whether this meant he had decided not to bring up the “hurtful” words because he saw no point in giving more facts or more particulars.  He demurred.168Foot Note 168×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 62 line 15 to p 63 line 30.When he was asked to clarify what he had meant, he was unable to do so.  Instead, he asserted that he “didn’t say much about what [his] girlfriend said to [him] or did to [him]”.169Foot Note 169×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 64 lines 1–10.However, looking at the contents of his investigative statements, this assertion was simply untrue.  Far from having exercised restraint in disclosing what Yati had said or done to him, he had provided a copious amount of information about Yati’s behaviour towards him which included the rude or harsh things she had said and done to him.  For example, he said that he had “spent a lot of money on her” and had bought her things such as a pre-paid phone card.170Foot Note 170×2AB986, para 39.He also volunteered details of how she had taken money from him: when she needed money to build a house in Indonesia, she had asked him to cancel his home leave and to give her money; and he had done so by helping her pay off a loan at the rate of $283 per month over a five-month period.171Foot Note 171×2AB979, para 15.As noted earlier, he had mentioned her telling him after sex on 30 December 2018 that “she was a prostitute” and asking him how much he could pay her.  He had also mentioned her telling him to “leave her alone” and reneging on her earlier promise not to take another boyfriend by saying that “this was depending on her mind and luck”.172Foot Note 172×2AB981, para 22; 2AB989, para 53.In short, contrary to the accused’s claims, his statements to the police revealed that he had much to say about what Yati had said and done to him. 101 For the reasons set out in [99]–[100], I rejected the accused’s explanations as to why he omitted to mention the Humiliating Words in his investigative statements. 102 In respect of his interviews with Dr Cheok, the accused initially claimed that he did not say anything about the Humiliating Words because he had been told that Dr Cheok was a “doctor for [his] head”:173Foot Note 173×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 68 lines 29–32. He was going to check my head.  I didn’t want to tell him all those words because it was my understanding what will those words help him.  In Bangladesh also, we don’t tell doctors so many things. 103 I did not believe the above explanation.  First, Dr Cheok testified that he had explained to the accused the purpose of the interviews; in particular, the fact that he was a staff from the IMH, that he had been directed by the court to conduct a psychiatric assessment (and not a “medical physical examination”), and that his report would be tendered to the court.174Foot Note 174×Transcript of 25 September 2020, p 117 line 7 to p 118 line 1.Dr Cheok was clear that it was standard practice for such information to be given to an accused person who was the subject of a court-mandated psychiatric assessment.175Foot Note 175×Transcript of 25 September 2020, p 116 line 28 to p 117 line 4.I did not think, therefore, that the accused could have been unaware of the reason why Dr Cheok was interviewing him. 104 Indeed, as the Prosecution pointed out in cross-examination, it was apparent from Dr Cheok’s interview notes that he had specifically asked the accused, “Please help me understand why you killed her”.176Foot Note 176×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 67 lines 28–32; 3AB160.Tellingly, when this line in Dr Cheok’s interview notes was highlighted to the accused, he replied evasively at first that Dr Cheok had asked only “[h]alf the question”.177Foot Note 177×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 68 lines 3–4.When pressed, he conceded that Dr Cheok had asked, “Why did you kill the girl?”178Foot Note 178×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 68 lines 7–13.When asked again why he had failed to tell Dr Cheok about the Humiliating Words which had (according to him) led to his strangling Yati, he could provide no coherent explanation and merely asserted that he had “decided not to say those words … [he] didn’t want to say those words to the doctor”.179Foot Note 179×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 70 lines 15–27.Yet, once again, this assertion was plainly unbelievable because Dr Cheok’s interview notes showed that the accused had – in answer to the question about why he had killed Yati – articulated a number of reasons.  Thus for example he had said:180Foot Note 180×3AB160. Because she does not talk to me nicely Whenever I call her she was harsh with me If she spoke to me nicely, if I go my way you go your way I may decide not to kill her I told her to tell your boyfriend not to call you for 1 month after I am married You are free to mix with him 105 Considering that he had been prepared to tell Dr Cheok he killed Yati because,inter alia, she did not talk to him “nicely” and was harsh with him, there was no reason why the accused should have decided to refrain from mentioning the Humiliating Words allegedly uttered by Yati on 30 December 2018.  When he was pressed further, he simply retreated to the bare statement that he had “decided not to tell” Dr Cheok181Foot Note 181×Transcript of 23 September 2020, p 74 lines 21–24.– which was no answer at all. 106 For the reasons set out in [103]–[105], I rejected the accused’s explanations as to why he omitted to mention the Humiliating Words in his interviews with Dr Cheok. 107 To sum up, therefore: given the significance of the Humiliating Words in relation to the accused’s actions in killing Yati, one would have expected him to mention this when he was interviewed by the police and Dr Cheok.  This was all the more so when he had taken the trouble to provide both the police and Dr Cheok with details of various things said and done by Yati in the Room on 30 December 2018.  As noted above, none of the accused’s explanations for his failure to mention the Humiliating Words could be believed.  In my view, the accused’s account of these Humiliating Words to Dr Ung some 17 months after Yati’s death – and subsequently at trial – was yet another story he had made up.  Pertinently, Dr Ung agreed at trial that in criminal cases of this nature, there would be “the motivation to falsify, distort or exaggerate facts to avoid punishment”; and that the “lapse of time” after the killing “would have given [the accused] more time to think up and come up with such falsehoods, distortions and exaggerations”.182Foot Note 182×Transcript of 25 September 2020, p 36 line 30 to p 37 line 6.With respect, this was in my view precisely what the accused had done.  It was clear that having killed Yati in accordance with his premeditated plan, he later decided to find some way of avoiding or minimising responsibility for the killing.  To do so, he had to,inter alia, rebut any inference of premeditation or pre-planning; and this was why, more than a year thereafter, he came up with the story of the Humiliating Words (in addition to the other falsehoods I have earlier addressed – see [52]–[70], [72]–[78] and [80]–[86]). 108 To recap: the accused’s claim about the alleged utterance of the Humiliating Words by Yati was an important part of the narrative of the killing which he presented to Dr Ung and at trial – his narrative being one of an “impulsive” killing, committed in the spur of the moment, and without any premeditation or planning.  Clearly, the alleged utterance of these Humiliating Words was central to the two partial defences which the accused invoked: that of diminished responsibility (Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code) (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”)), and that of grave and sudden provocation (Exception 1 to s 300 of the PC.  I next address in turn the accused’s reliance on each of these partial defences.",
        "Whether the partial defence of diminished responsibility was made out by the accused": "",
        "The applicable test": "159 In respect of the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation, the Prosecution and the Defence were agreed on the requirements which had to be met in order for this defence to be made out.  InPathip Selvan s/o Sugumaran v Public Prosecutor[2012] 4 SLR 453 (“Pathip”), the CA held that there were two distinct requirements for the defence of provocation to apply (at [34]): First, it must be shown that the accused was deprived of self-control by the provocation (‘the subjective test’).  Secondly, the provocation must be grave and sudden, and it has to be determined whether an ordinary person of the same sex and age as the accused, sharing his characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation, would have been so provoked as to lose self-control (‘the objective test’). 160 In respect of the subjective test, the CA inPathipfollowed (at [35]) the definition of loss of self-control adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal inRegina v Duffy[1949] 1 All ER 932: namely, “sudden and temporary loss of self-control, rendering the accused so subject to passion as to make him … for the moment not master of his mind”. 161 Importantly, the CA inPathipalso pointed out that where a killing was premeditated, the question of loss of self-control was “without more, quite irrelevant” (at [36]). 162 In respect of the objective test, it was held inPathip(at [51]) that the conduct of the accused must be assessed by reference to the reasonable person with a broadly similar background.  In this connection, there was “[n]o single abstract standard of reasonableness [to] be laid down”: this was a “fact-centric assessment that ha[d] to be made in the context of the established facts”.  In assessing whether the objective test was met, there were two types of characteristics which the court could take into account: characteristics affecting a similarly placed reasonable man’s level of self-control and characteristics affecting the gravity of the provocation (at [51]). However, an accused’s exceptional hot temper alone should not be taken to exonerate an exceedingly violent response (at [51]).",
        "Applying the test to the facts of the present case": "163 In the present case, the Defence unequivocally identified the Humiliating Words as the provocation relied on for the accused’s invocation of the partial defence under Exception 1.251Foot Note 251×DCS, para 34.For the reasons I have set out at [90]–[107], I found that there were no such words spoken by Yati to the accused on 30 December 2018.  In other words, the factual premise for the accused’s reliance on the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation was non-existent. 164 In any event, for the reasons I have set out at [51]–[87], I found that this was a premeditated killing.  After learning about Yati’s new Bangladeshi boyfriend on 9 December 2018, the accused had already decided to kill her; he developed an algorithm whereby he would kill her if she refused to continue their relationship but would spare her if she agreed; and he came up with a step-by-step plan for the killing.  Since this was a premeditated killing, the question of loss of self-control by the accused was without more, quite irrelevant. 165 Further, even assuming the Humiliating Words had been spoken by Yati, the evidence set out at [129]–[143] showed clearly that there was no loss of self-control by the accused throughout the killing.  Looking at the series, the nature  and the sequence of acts the accused performed throughout the killing, he went about making sure of Yati’s death in a purposeful and systematic manner: strangling her with the towel; retrieving the rope and tightening it around her neck with multiple knots to effect a second strangulation; pressing on her mouth and nose with a towel; and finally twisting her head forcefully.  On the evidence before me, it was simplynotpossible to describe this case as a crime of impulse committed in the heat of the moment. 166 I should add that the Prosecution relied on,inter alia,evidence of the accused’s post-killing conduct in contending that there was no loss of self-control (for example, his actions in extending the hotel room rental, haggling over the room rental rate, and taking Yati’s valuables with him).252Foot Note 252×PCS, para 98.In this connection, as the CA pointed out inPathip(at [42]), “whether post-killing conduct can be taken into account depends on the facts of each case”. I considered that where the actions in question were carried out after some time had already elapsed from the killing, it might not be fair to rely on them as direct evidence of the accused’s self-control at the time of the killing.  However, while I did not rely on the accused’s conduct post-killing to make any inferences about his self-control at the time of the killing, nothing about his conduct post-killing militated against my finding that he did not lose self-control; in fact, quite the opposite. 167 Finally, even assuming the Humiliating Words were uttered by Yati, I did not find that on a balance of probabilities, an ordinary person of the same age and sex as the accused, sharing his characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation, would have been so provoked as to suddenly lose his self-control. This was so even if the accused’s AD was included as one of the characteristics to be considered.  Even assuming the Humiliating Words were spoken, they could not be viewed in isolation; and their effects on the accused had to be considered against the background of their relationship:Pathipat [59].  As the Prosecution pointed out, although the accused and Yati had a long history together, by mid-2018 their relationship had broken down.  It was not disputed that even before her relationship with Hanifa, Yati had already cheated on the accused by having a relationship with another Bangladeshi man (Shamim) in May or June 2018.  It was also not disputed that even after Yati broke up with Shamim and reconciled with the accused, he had gone ahead with his plans for an arranged marriage, going so far as to apply for home leave in February 2019 to return to Bangladesh for the wedding.  While he had demanded that Yati continue her relationship with him until his return to Bangladesh, he was prepared for the possibility of rebuff: as he disclosed in his investigative statement of 3 January 2019,253Foot Note 253×2AB980, paras 18–19.by the evening of 23 December 2018 she had already made it clear that she would not remain in a relationship with him even for the one month before his departure for Bangladesh, and she maintained this position right up to 30 December 2018.  The accused himself noted that by this time, Yati was not picking up his calls; and even when she acceded to his request for a meeting in person, she told him “it would be the last time [they] met”.  In the accused’s own words, she “was closer with [Hanifa]”;254Foot Note 254×2AB993, para 71.and this was something he already recognised even before 30 December 2018. 168 In light of the above evidence, even assuming Yati had spoken the Humiliating Words to the accused on 30 December 2018, I did not find it probable that the utterance of these words would have transported the accused’s passions to such an extent that he lost his self-control momentarily. 169 Given the heavy reliance placed by the Defence onPathip, I should make it clear that I considered the present case to be very much distinguishable fromPathip.  First, it must be remembered that inPathip, it was accepted by the Prosecution, the Defence and the CA that the killing was not premeditated.  In contrast, in the present case, the evidence pointed clearly to a premeditated killing. 170 Secondly, unlike the alleged provocation in the present case, the provocation inPathipwas sudden. The CA inPathipfound that the appellant had arranged to meet the deceased to reconcile with rather than to harm – let alone, to kill – her: for example, he had arranged to meet the deceased in a public place and had asked for her mother’s permission to marry her.  Shortly before proceeding to meet the deceased, he had also told his friends that he was going to meet her and would return with her later.  He had thus expected the deceased to beg for his forgiveness, with the two of them reconciling thereafter.  This was not the case with the present accused: as noted earlier, he was well aware by 23 December 2018 that Yati would not remain in a relationship with him even for the one month pending his return to Bangladesh. 171 It should also be noted that the killing inPathipwas clearly carried out in an “entirely random and frenzied manner” [emphasis in original omitted] with numerous external injuries inflicted over multiple regions of the deceased’s body (Pathipat [41]).  In contrast, as highlighted earlier, the evidence in this case showed the killing of Yati to have been methodically executed and far from frenzied.",
        "Summary": "172 For the reasons I have set out in [163]–[171], I held that the accused was unable to establish the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation on a balance of probabilities.",
        "Whether the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation was made out by the accused": "",
        "The submission by the Defence for a conviction under an alternative charge under s 300(c)": "173 Given the findings I made in this case, there were simply no grounds for the belated contention in the Defence’s closing submissions that the accused ought to be convicted of an alternative charge under s 300(c) of the PC.  Section 300(c) relates to culpable homicide done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, where the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.  As I explained at [43]–[50], however, in the present case there could be no doubt at all that the accused acted with the intention to cause Yati’s death.",
        "Conclusion": "174 For the foregoing reasons, I held that the Prosecution had proven the charge of murder against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I also held that the accused was unable to avail himself of either the partial defence of diminished responsibility or the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation. I therefore convicted the accused of the charge of murder under s 300(a) of the PC. 175 Under s 302(1) of the PC, whoever commits murder within the meaning of s 300(a) shall be punished with death.  Having convicted the accused of the charge under s 300(a), I accordingly imposed the mandatory death sentence.
