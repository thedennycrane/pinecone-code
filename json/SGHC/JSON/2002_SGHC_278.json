        "Chitty": ", in the above\n\nparagraph, considers the circumstances in which a statement of opinion and a promise to do\n\nsomething at a future date can constitute the tort of misrepresentation. It will be noted\n\nthat where a representation does not relate to an existing or past fact but is an\n\nexpression of opinion or intention, the representation can still be actionable if the\n\nrepresentee establishes that the representor, at the time of the representation, did not\n\nor could not have had that opinion or intention.23.        In\n\nthe case ofBestland Development Pte Ltd v Thasin Development Pte Ltd(unreported,\n\n13 February 1991), Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) cited with approval the paragraph from\n\nChitty quoted above and went on to say:\"The first question to\n\n    determine is, are the alleged statements representations?To constitute a\n\n    representation, a statement must relate to a matter of fact. It must be a matter of\n\n    present or past fact: see 31 Halsbury’s Law (4thEdition) para 1005. A\n\n    distinction ought to be drawn between a representation of an existing fact and a promise\n\n    to do something in the future. Furthermore, mere praise by a man of his own goods or\n\n    undertaking is a matter ofpuffing and pushingand does not amount to\n\n    representation. However, a statement of opinion may in certain circumstances involve a\n\n    statement of fact. This was explained by Bowen LJ inSmith v Land and House Property\n\n    Corporation(1885) 28 Ch.D 7 at 15 as follows:-‘… it is often\n\n      fallaciously assumed that a statement of opinion cannot involve the statement of a fact.\n\n      In a case when the facts are equally well known to both parties, what one of them says to\n\n      the other is frequently nothing but an expression of opinion. The statement of such\n\n      opinion is in a sense a statement of fact, about the condition of the man’s own mind,\n\n      but only of an irrelevant fact, for it is of no consequence what the opinion is. But if\n\n      the facts are not equally known to both sides, then a statement of opinion by the one who\n\n      knows the facts best involves very often a statement of a material fact, for he impliedly\n\n      states that he knows facts which justify his opinion.\"(Emphasis added.)I will revert to the question of\n\n\"puffing and pushing\" referred to by Chao J later in this judgment.24.        At\n\nthe time that the Brochure and the other documents containing the impugned representations\n\nwere sent to the invitees, only provisional building permission (with requirements) had\n\nbeen obtained from the URA and construction of the Club had barely begun.\n\nThe representations impugned by the plaintiffs in paragraph 9 of the Amended\n\nStatement of Claim relate therefore to what the Club was expected to be like when\n\ncompleted. Those representations were therefore not statements of past or present fact but\n\nstatements of intention or (perhaps) opinion.25.        \n\nRepresentations of intention can be actionable if it can be shown that the defendants made\n\nthose representations without having any intention of complying with those\n\nrepresentations. If that was the plaintiffs’ case, then the court would embark on the\n\nexercise of determining the state of mind of the defendants at the time the\n\nrepresentations were made. That, however, was not the plaintiffs’ case. The\n\nplaintiffs did not, either in the pleadings or in the course of the hearing, seek to put\n\nin issue the state of the defendants’ mind at the relevant time. To the contrary, the\n\nplaintiffs’ position was that the state of the plaintiffs’ mind was irrelevant\n\nto their claim on misrepresentation.26.        In\n\nthis connection, Ms Lim submitted that there was no rule of law or equity that statements\n\nof intention or promises by a representor can never amount to a \"representation\"\n\ncapable of giving rise to a claim for misrepresentation. In support, she relied on a\n\nnumber of cases where statements of intention had given rise to actionable\n\nmisrepresentation. In particular, she quoted the paragraph from the judgment of Chao J\n\ninBestland Development(quoted above). I would have no difficulty accepting\n\nMs Lim’s submission if the plaintiffs had pleaded that the defendants, at the time\n\nthey made the statements in question, knew or ought to have known that the statements were\n\nfalse. But that was not the plaintiffs’ case. Their case was that the representations\n\n(enumerated in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Amended Statement of Claim) \"turned\n\nout\" to be false.27.        It\n\nwas the plaintiffs’ case that there was no need for them to concern themselves with\n\nor prove the state of mind of the defendants at the time the representations were made\n\nsince the relief the plaintiffs were seeking was under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation\n\nAct, Ch 390. That section read as follows:\"2(1) Where a person has\n\n    entered into a contractafter a misrepresentation has been made to him by another partythereto and as a result thereof he has suffered loss, then, if the person making the\n\n    misrepresentation would be liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation\n\n    been made fraudulently, that person shall be so liablenotwithstanding that the\n\n    misrepresentation was not made fraudulently, unless he proves that he had reasonable\n\n    ground to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts\n\n    represented were true.\"(Emphasis added.)Ms Lim submitted that there was\n\nno requirement under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act to plead the representor’s\n\nstate of mind and that to succeed under s 2(1) the plaintiffs need only prove the\n\nrepresentations made, the falsity of those representations and the loss suffered.\n\nThe falsity of the representations, Ms Lim submitted, was established by the evidence\n\nadduced by the plaintiffs that the Club by reason of having accepted an excessive number\n\nof members was unable to serve its members to the standards of a premier club that had\n\nbeen promised in the promotional material.28.        In\n\nsupport of her submissions, Ms Lim referred the court to a specimen pleading under the\n\nMisrepresentation Act given in Bullen & Leake \"Precedents of Pleadings\"\n\n(14thEd) Vol. 2 at 817. No other authority was cited by Ms Lim. In that\n\nspecimen, after the representations that induced the plaintiffs to enter into the contract\n\nhad been set out, there was a specific plea that each of those representations was in fact\n\nfalse and particulars were given as to why it was alleged that those representations were\n\nfalse. The representations set down in that specimen, I would also note, were\n\nrepresentations of existing facts. The specimen precedent was therefore of no\n\nassistance to the plaintiffs in this case.29.        Mr\n\nShanmugam, in his response, submitted that whatever other changes the Misrepresentation\n\nAct may have brought about to the law, it did not effect any change on the question of\n\nwhat sort of representations were actionable. In support, he cited an article jointly\n\nauthored by Atiyah and Treitel entitled \"Misrepresentation Act 1967\", 30\n\n(MLR) 369 where the learned authors in dealing with identical provisions in the English\n\nAct, state:\"The Act leaves many\n\n    important points to be decided in accordance with the old law. Thus the definition of\n\n    ‘misrepresentation’ has not been affected: the term continues to exclude mere\n\n    puffs, representations of law and representations as to the future.\"(Emphasis added.)Mr Shanmugam also drew the\n\ncourt’s attention to the recent case ofSpice Girls Ltd(\"SGL\")v\n\nAprilia World Service BV(‘AWS’), [2002] EWCA Civ 15, where at paragraph 12\n\nSir Andrew Morritt V-C, after setting out s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967,\n\nobserved:\"Thus liability depends on\n\n    four elements: (a) a misrepresentation made by one person to another, (b) a\n\n    subsequent contract between them, (c) consequential loss and (d)an absence, at the\n\n    time the contract was made, of a belief or reasonable grounds therefor in the truth of the\n\n    facts represented. If all those conditions are satisfied then the representor is\n\n    liable to the representee for such damages as would be payable if the misrepresentation\n\n    had been made fraudulently.\"Those observations, Mr Shanmugam\n\nsubmitted, do not reflect the far-reaching changes to the law of misrepresentation that Ms\n\nLim claimed had been effected by the Misrepresentation Act.30.        In\n\ntheSpice Girlscase the agent of SGL had sent a fax to AWS shortly before the\n\nAgreement was entered into confirming the commitment of each of the five Spice Girls to\n\nfuture implementation of the project. At that time, one of the five Spice Girls, Ms Geri\n\nHalliwell, had told the other Spice Girls that she would soon be leaving the group. In\n\ndealing with the effect of the representation contained in the fax the court said:\"We consider that the fax of\n\n    30 March 1998 contained express representations by SGL as to the commitment of each of the\n\n    Spice Girls to the future implementation of all the terms of the heads of agreement as\n\n    subsequently incorporated into the formal agreement to be concluded between SGL and\n\n    Aprilia. That statement was untrue because SGL knew that the term of the agreement for\n\n    which provision was made in the heads of agreement was 12 months and that there was a risk\n\n    that Ms Halliwell would leave after only six of them. … The unqualified assurance as\n\n    to the commitment of each Spice Girl to the entire commercial sponsorship described in the\n\n    heads of agreement contained within it theimplied representation that SGL did not know\n\n    of any matter which might falsify the assurance. That was a representation of fact and it\n\n    was false.\"(Emphasis added.)It is relevant to note that in\n\ntheSpice Girlscase, AWS had specifically pleaded that the fax contained an\n\nexpress or implied representation that SGL was unaware of any matter which might give AWS\n\nreason to believe that the Spice Girls might cease to consist of all five members during\n\nthe minimum term of the Agreement. There was no similar plea relating to the state of mind\n\nof the defendants in our present case.31.        I\n\naccept Mr Shanmugam’s submission that the Misrepresentation Act did not effect any\n\nmaterial change to the common law concept of misrepresentation: mere puffs,\n\nrepresentations of law and representations as to the future all continued to be excluded\n\nfrom the ambit of that tort even after the said Act came into effect. The law continued to\n\nbe that a representation as to future conduct did not, by its very nature, constitute a\n\nmisrepresentation unless, implied therein, was a representation of present or past facts\n\nwhich was untrue. There was no allegation in these proceedings of any such implied\n\nrepresentation.32.        I\n\nam satisfied that the representations in the Brochure and Q&A Sheet impugned by the\n\nplaintiffs were, in the context of the pleadings and the evidence in this case, not\n\nactionable representations for the purposes of the tort of misrepresentation. The\n\nplaintiffs’ claim based on misrepresentation therefore fails.Salesmen’s puff.33.        \n\nEulogistic commendation by a salesman of the wares that he touts is a common and expected\n\nfeature of the market place. Courts are therefore reluctant to rescind contracts of sale\n\nmerely on account of the exuberant and exaggerated language employed by salesmen.\n\nThis reluctance is reflected in the maxim \"Caveat Emptor\" or\n\n\"Buyer Beware\". When Chao Hick Tin J inBestland Development(quoted\n\nabove) described praise by a salesman promoting his goods as \"a matter of puffing and\n\npushing\" that did not amount to misrepresentation, Chao J was recognising this maxim.34.        Mr\n\nShanmugam sought to persuade the court that the grandiloquent claims (not his words)\n\ncontained in the Brochure should be recognised for what they truly were – ie\n\nsalesmen’s puff – and should not form the foundation for an action either in\n\nmisrepresentation or in contract. I need not consider this submission in respect of the\n\nclaim in misrepresentation as I have already dismissed that claim on the grounds that the\n\nimpugned representations were not of a nature that was actionable. The submission,\n\nhowever, remains relevant in considering the claim in contract. There is a distinction\n\nbetween promotional statements that are mere puff and promotional statements that are\n\noutside the ambit of mere puff. Certain statements – although clearly promotional in\n\nnature – may, individually or taken together, amount to a binding promise that is\n\npart of the contract between the parties. Such statements would not be mere puff.The claim in contract.35.        As\n\nnoted in paragraph 9 above, it was not in dispute that the declarations contained in the\n\napplication form – in particular, the declaration that applicant would abide by\n\nthe Rules – became, upon acceptance of the application, contractually binding between\n\nthat applicant and the defendants. What was in dispute was whether that was the entire\n\ncontract between the parties or whether some or all of the impugned representations also\n\nconstituted terms of that contract.36.        Ms\n\nLim submitted that, if it was the intention of the defendants that the terms in the\n\napplication form were to be the entire contract, the defendants could and should have so\n\nstipulated in the application form. The absence of such a stipulation, Ms Lim submitted,\n\nprevented the defendants from alleging that other terms could not be implied. I cannot\n\naccept that submission. In my view, all that the absence of such a stipulation meant was\n\nthat it made it easier for the plaintiffs to argue that the contract between the parties\n\nwas not confined to the declarations in the application form.37.        \n\nAlthough the defendants’ case was that the declarations contained in the application\n\nform constituted the entire contract between the successful applicant and the defendants,\n\nI will in this judgment where appropriate treat the defendants’ case as being that\n\nthe Rules constituted the entire contract between the parties. I do this because for the\n\npurpose of this case, except for the declaration referring to the Rules, all the other\n\ndeclarations are of no particular significance.38.        Ms\n\nLim submitted that if the representations in the Brochure and other documents were not\n\ngiven legal effect, the defendants could, with impunity, ignore all those representations\n\nand – except where those representations were actionable for the purposes of the tort\n\nof misrepresentation – provide facilities and a level of services and ambience far\n\ninferior to and/or very different from what the defendants had been promised in the\n\npromotional material. She submitted that as the Rules did not spell out the facilities the\n\ndefendants were obliged to provide, the defendants could, for example, provide car parking\n\nspace for (say) 100 cars when 600 spaces had been promised or provide a small wading pool\n\nwhen a large pool had been promised. In this context, Ms Lim pointed out that the\n\nCourt of Appeal, in its interlocutory judgment, had alluded to certain of the impugned\n\nrepresentations as being specific indications of what members could expect from the Club.\n\nThis was at page 348 of the report where the Court of Appeal said:\"3. … The action is\n\n    based on a common law prospectus issued by RTC when inviting members of the public to join\n\n    the club. The prospectus comprised the following documents:(1) a letter of invitation dated\n\n    9 November 1996;(2) a brochure;(3) a document giving general\n\n    information in the form of questions and answers.4. The prospectus promised\n\n    ‘lavish reception and facilities’ and that the club would be ‘without peer\n\n    in terms of size, facilities and sheer opulence’.It also gave, inter alia,\n\n    the following specific indications as to what members could expect:(1) there would be about 600 car\n\n    parking lots for members;(2) the exclusive and limited\n\n    membership would be fully transferable;(3) the total built-up area would\n\n    be in excess of 400,000 sq ft.\"(Emphasis added.)She submitted that specific\n\nindications given by the defendants in the promotional material ought to be given legal\n\neffect.39.        Ms\n\nLim submitted that if the court gave no contractual effect to such promises, the\n\nplaintiffs would have no recourse against the defendants even for the most cynical\n\ndisregard by the defendants of such representations/promises. That submission is not quite\n\ncorrect. There would be recourse in the tort of misrepresentation. But, as discussed\n\nearlier, to succeed in misrepresentation the plaintiff would have to show that the\n\nrepresentations were false at the time they were made in that the representor had no\n\nintention of fulfilling that representation. In the present case, the plaintiffs’\n\nclaim under misrepresentation failed because the plaintiffs not only did not seek to\n\nallege that the representations were false when they were made but took the position that\n\nthe state of mind of the representor was irrelevant.40.        The\n\nRules did not specify any limit to the number of members that the defendants could admit\n\nand it gave full authority to the defendants to determine, from time to time, the entrance\n\nfee payable. Unless constrained by the court, Ms Lim submitted, the defendants could flood\n\nthe Club by issuing many more thousands of memberships (even at reduced prices) and make\n\nthe demand on space at the Club so tight, that the claims in the promotional literature\n\nthat this was to be a premier club without peer in Singapore, would be sheer mockery.41.        The\n\nRules granted members a licence to use and enjoy the facilities at the Club up to October\n\n2026 but the Rules did not define what those facilities would be. Instead, the Rules\n\nmerely stated:\"2. It is the intention of\n\n    the Proprietor to provide for the use and enjoyment by the Members of facilities (the\n\n    ‘Facilities’) for recreation, entertainment, dining and/or such other activities\n\n    as the Proprietor may from time to time in its absolute discretion decide.\"It is not very clear whether the\n\nphrase \"in its absolute discretion decide\" qualifies only the \"other\n\nactivities\" or whether it also qualifies the facilities for \"recreation,\n\nentertainment and dining\" in the first part of the rule. The way the rule is drafted\n\nit appears to qualify only the \"other activities\". This would mean that there is\n\nnothing in the Rules to indicate what the facilities for recreation, entertainment and\n\ndining consisted of. Further, the Rules do not make any reference to the standards of\n\nservice and ambience that the defendants were required to provide to the members.42.        In\n\nview of the lack of any detail in the Rules on crucial matters like what facilities the\n\ndefendants were obliged to provide and the standards of service they were required to\n\nmaintain, it would, Ms Lim submitted, not make sense for this court to hold that\n\nthe Rules constituted the entire contract of membership. The only way to give some\n\ncommercial sense to the situation, she submitted, would be to consider the underlying\n\nmessage in the impugned representations – that this would be an exclusive and premier\n\nclub – as part of the contractual obligations of the defendants to its members.43.        Ms\n\nLim conceded that some of the descriptions in the promotional material may well be\n\nsalesmen’s puff: a distinction would have to be made between statements that were\n\nmere puffs and statements intended to be binding. She submitted that in deciding what was\n\nmere puff and what were promises intended to be relied on, the test should be an objective\n\none: the test of the reasonable man.44.        The\n\nplaintiffs’ claim in contract was spelt out in the following paragraphs of the\n\nAmended Statement of Claim:\"11. Additionally or\n\n    alternatively, the representations and the holding-out set out above became terms of the\n\n    contractual licences spawned by the acceptance of the Plaintiffs and other members of the\n\n    Class.12. The Plaintiffs and other\n\n    members of the Class on the faith of the representations as set out above and the contents\n\n    of thecommon lawprospectus as a whole subscribed to and became the founder\n\n    members. Each of them paid the subscription in the sum of S$28,000. All made their\n\n    applications not later than 30 November 1996. In addition, they paid monthly subscriptions\n\n    and deposits for the Food and Beverage Account.\"The representations referred to\n\nin paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Amended Statement of Claim were the same\n\nrepresentations that the plaintiffs relied on for their claim in misrepresentation. I have\n\nset out these representations in full in paragraphs 14 and 15 above.45.        The\n\nalleged breach of the contract by the defendants was pleaded in paragraph 14 of the\n\nAmended Statement of Claim:\"14. Additionally or\n\n    alternatively, by reason of the matters set out in paragraph 13, the Defendant was in\n\n    breach of the contract of the terms as asserted above.\"I have, at paragraph 16 above,\n\nset out in full paragraph 13 of the Amended Statement of Claim. In effect, what the\n\nplaintiffs were alleging was that the impugned representations set out in paragraphs 9 and\n\n10 of the Amended Statement of Claim as the basis of their claim in misrepresentation,\n\nwere also the promises that constituted the contractual obligations of the defendants. In\n\nfailing to honour those promises the defendants, she submitted, were in breach of their\n\ncontractual obligations to the plaintiffs.46.        \n\nParagraph 13 of the Amended Statement of Claim gave particulars of the terms of the\n\ncontract alleged to have been breached. In substance, the breaches complained of were\n\nas follows:(a) The defendants accepted\n\n    19,000 members at $28,000 per member.(b) There was no public launch at\n\n    $40,000 for the second class of members.(c) The Club was opened in March\n\n    2000 and not end 1998 as promised.(d) The huge number of\n\n    applications accepted as members resulted in the facilities at the Club being grossly\n\n    inadequate and not measuring up to the impugned representations.(e) Not all the facilities stated\n\n    in the impugned representations were available to members.(f) The defendants failed to\n\n    provide club facilities matching the standards promised in the impugned representations.(g) The membership became\n\n    virtually useless.As the above are the breaches\n\ncomplained of by the plaintiffs, it would be necessary to consider in respect of each of\n\nthem whether the terms allegedly breached, were, in the first place, terms of the\n\ncontract.(a)    Accepting\n\n19,000 members at $28,000.47.        \n\nNone of the impugned representations go anywhere near suggesting that that the defendants\n\nrepresented that there would be a cap on membership numbers either at 19,000 or at any\n\nother specified figure. In fact, Ms Lim had specifically conceded that this was so\n\n(see paragraph 17 above). As there was no specific representation as to the number of\n\nmembers, it would follow that there was no specific contractual term precluding the\n\ndefendants from accepting 19,000 members.(b)    No public\n\nlaunch at $40,000.48.        On\n\nthe evidence, it was established that there was a launch of membership at $40,000. It was\n\nin evidence that in fact 56 persons were accepted as ordinary members at this price. There\n\nis therefore no merit in this claim for breach even if this was such a contractual term.(c)    The Club\n\nbeing opened in March 2000 instead of end 1998.49.        It\n\nwas not in dispute that the defendants had initially expected that the Club would be\n\nopened in late 1998 and had made this known to the invitees. This was, however, only a\n\nstatement of expectation and was not, in my view, a statement intended to be a term of the\n\ncontract of membership.(d)    The\n\ndefendants would refrain from accepting a membership so large that the Club’s\n\nfacilities would become inadequate and the Club would not be a premier club.50.        The\n\nthrust of Ms Lim’s arguments, minus the emotive content, was that the defendants had\n\npromised that the Club would be a premier club in Singapore. This promise, Ms Lim\n\nsubmitted, was a crucial one in attracting the plaintiffs to apply for membership and was\n\nan express if not an implied term of the contract. She submitted that by taking in 19,000\n\nmembers – a number that was in excess of what the facilities at the Club could cope\n\nwith – the defendants had breached that term.51.        In\n\nconsidering this submission, the underlying question that needs to be answered is whether\n\nthe impugned representations gave rise to a contractual term that the Club would have the\n\nsort of facilities and services that would make it a premier club. I will revert to this\n\nquestion shortly.(e) Not all facilities were\n\navailable to members.52.        In\n\nthe Brochure there was a page headed \"Facilities at a Glance\" in which all the\n\nfood and beverage (\"F&B\") outlets, recreational facilities and other\n\nactivity areas were listed. Amongst the nearly 40 items listed were a library and a\n\ncomputer room. The complaint by the plaintiffs was that these two facilities were not\n\nprovided. The defendants’ response was that a reading area with books and chairs\n\nhad been provided and that was the library. Therefore, even if the provision of a library\n\nwas a contractual term, as a library had been provided, the question of any breach of that\n\nterm did not arise. In this context, I would note that the promotional material contained\n\nno particulars of what the library would be like. In any event, taking the cue from the\n\npromotional material as to the sort of \"prestige club\" that the defendants\n\nenvisaged, the provision of library facilities could not have been a significant feature\n\nof the club envisaged.53.        Mr\n\nShanmugam submitted that the listing of these two items on that page was no more than a\n\nprojection of what the facilities at the Club were likely to be. There was, he submitted,\n\nno intention on the part of the defendants to bind themselves to provide these two\n\nfacilities. In any event the library was provided for – it was only the proposal for\n\na computer that had been shelved. A computer room may well be introduced if the defendants\n\nfelt that there was a sufficient demand for it. Taking into consideration that in the\n\npromotional material, no prominence was given to these two facilities, I accept Mr\n\nShanmugam’s submission that the provision of these two items were not contractual\n\nobligations but merely projections of what the Club, when built, was expected to have.(f)    Failing to\n\nprovide facilities matching the standards promised.54.        \n\nThis claim arises from the allegation of overcrowding. It appears to be connected to\n\nand contained within claim (d) above.(g)    The\n\nmembership becoming virtually useless.55.        \n\nThere was no evidence adduced that the membership had in fact become \"virtually\n\nuseless\". At best, this claim is also a facet of claim (d) above.The terms of the contract.56.        The\n\ndefendants’ case was that the write-up in the invitation letter, the Brochure and the\n\nQ&A Sheet were no more than invitations to treat. It was the defendants’ case\n\nthat the terms contained in the application form (in particular the Rules) were the terms\n\non which each applicant was offering to join the Club and when that application was\n\naccepted, those terms became the entire contract between the applicant and the defendants.57.        The\n\nRules make it abundantly clear – and this I suppose would be a fairly common feature\n\nin proprietary clubs – that the proprietors (ie the defendants) were in complete\n\ncharge and had practically unfettered rights to run the Club as they chose. And there was\n\nnothing in the Rules specifying the sort of facilities, the sort of ambience and level of\n\nservices that the defendants were obliged to provide. In short, the main selling points of\n\nthe Club – its exclusivity, its up-market ambience, its prestige, its facilities\n\nand the quality of its services – were all not specified to in the Rules.58.        The\n\nplaintiffs’ witnesses testified that the main reason they joined the Club was because\n\nit was to be an exclusive club with the ambience, service and facilities of a premier\n\nclub. I accept that evidence. I was more than satisfied that the plaintiffs who testified\n\njoined the Club because they took seriously the promise by the defendants in their\n\npromotional material that this would be a premier club with first-class facilities and\n\nservices. Ms Lim submitted, and there was considerable merit in that submission, that the\n\nabsence of these rather crucial terms in the Rules indicated that the Rules could not be\n\nthe entire contract between the parties.59.        \n\nNumerous authorities were cited by both sides as to the circumstances in which courts\n\nwould hold that statements found in promotional literature constituted terms (implied or\n\notherwise) of the contract. The underlying basis for accepting such statements as terms of\n\nthe contract is the intention of the parties. If the court, applying an objective test,\n\nconcludes that a reasonable man looking at the promotional material would have concluded\n\nthat the promoter intended that the statements (or some of the statements) therein were to\n\nbe taken seriously, then those statements were likely to be terms of the contract.60.        In\n\nthe present case, looking at the factual matrix in which the statements were made –\n\nincluding the endorsement and co-promotion of the Club by reputable financial institutions\n\n– the representations that this was to be a premier club with first-class facilities\n\nand services seems to me to be more than mere puff. Such representations were, in my view,\n\nintended to be taken seriously. They were intended as a promise from the defendants\n\nthat the Club, when functional, will meet those standards. It was this promise that led\n\npeople like Tan Chin Seng (the 1stplaintiff) to join the Club.61.        In\n\nthis regard, the following comments made by Sir Oliver Popplewell in1406 Pub Company v\n\nHoare & Anor(Ch.D – 2 March 2001) (although Mr Shanmugam tried to\n\ndistinguish the case on the facts) are apposite:\"I look at the totality of\n\n    the evidence and ask what a reasonable outside observer would infer from all the\n\n    circumstances. The Claimants are, of course, entitled to take advantage of any legal point\n\n    but I cannot help but think that an outside observer would think their conduct somewhat\n\n    shabby. … This was part and parcel of a well presented sales pitch relating to\n\n    important terms of contract and intended to form part of the contract. I am satisfied that\n\n    the Claimants, through Mr Hughes and the brochure, did give the promises and assurances;\n\n    did intend that the Defendants should act on them; did intend them to be part of the\n\n    contract and the Defendants did act on them. They would not otherwise have entered into\n\n    the contract.\"The invitation letter, the\n\nBrochure and the Q&A Sheet in this case were part of a \"well presented sales\n\npitch\" by the defendants containing important terms. The defendants did intend that\n\nthe invitees should act on those terms and some of the invitees did act on them. I am\n\nsatisfied that the plaintiffs who testified before me would not, but for the promises in\n\nthe promotional material relating to the exclusivity, ambience and services at the Club,\n\nhave entered into the membership contract. Ignoring the subjective views of the plaintiffs\n\nand applying instead the objective test of the reasonable man, I find that a reasonable\n\nman looking at the promotional material would have concluded that the defendants were\n\nserious about this Club being a premier club with first-class facilities. Viewed\n\nobjectively the representations to that effect were, in my view, part of the\n\ncontract.62.        \n\nRule 6.1 specifically provides that the Club shall consist of such number of members as\n\nthe proprietors may in their discretion from time to time admit. If this was an unfettered\n\ndiscretion, it would detract from the promise of the defendants – which I have held\n\nto be a contractual term – to provide an exclusive and premier club. If the\n\ndefendants admit more members than what the facilities at the Club could reasonably cope\n\nwith, then the Club would no longer be the kind of club that was promised. Rule 6.1 would\n\ntherefore have to be read subject to the defendants’ obligation to provide a club\n\nwith the qualities promised. This will mean that, in exercising their rights under Rule\n\n6.1 to admit members, the defendants will have to ensure that they do not admit so large a\n\nnumber that their obligation to provide and run a premier club would be compromised. The\n\ndiscretion given to the defendants under Rule 6.1 would, to that extent, be curtailed. To\n\nput it in an alternative way: to give business efficacy to the contract, I would imply as\n\na term of the contract that the defendants would exercise their discretion under Rule 6.1\n\nin such manner that there would be no breach of the defendants’ obligations to\n\nprovide the sort of club promised in the promotional material.The facilities, ambience and\n\nservice at the Club.63.        At\n\nthe invitation of the parties, I visited the Club and was shown all its facilities. The\n\nClub was spacious and its facilities were certainly up-market. Whilst the dcor of the\n\nClub may not be to everyone’s taste, there can be no doubt that the physical\n\nfacilities and ambience matched the adjectives \"opulent\" and \"lavish\"\n\nused in the promotional material. In fact, there was no serious complaint by the\n\nplaintiffs about the ambience or the quality of the physical facilities provided.64.        The\n\nplaintiffs’ main complaint was that by admitting 19,000 persons (19,048 including the\n\n56 \"ordinary\" members) as members, the demand for the usage of facilities and\n\nservices at the Club became so strained that the Club was not the premier club that the\n\ndefendants had contracted to provide. I now turn to consider whether the demands on the\n\nfacilities brought about by the large membership that was admitted were such that the Club\n\ndid not meet the first-class standards of a premier club that was promised.Did the defendants breach their\n\ncontractual undertaking to provide a premier club?65.        The\n\nClub was initially scheduled to open in June 1998 but because of construction delays and\n\ndelays in getting various approvals, that schedule could not be met. The opening of the\n\nClub was an event that the thousands who had joined were eagerly awaiting – an\n\neagerness made keener by the delay in the opening date. When the Club did open, large\n\nnumbers of members/guests turned up at the Club during the initial weeks and months. This\n\nresulted in overcrowding and congestion. Matters were not helped by the fact that the\n\ndefendants provided free food during the initial weeks.66.        It\n\nis pertinent to note that the bulk of the complaints made by the plaintiffs about\n\nfacilities at the Club related to this initial few months and to festive days, after the\n\ninitial period, when the demand at the F&B outlets, especially at the Caf &\n\nTerrace, still remained high. The usage of the pool during weekends, especially during\n\nschool holidays, was very high and the gym also saw high usage during the more popular\n\nhours. The defendants did not seek to deny that there was a high demand for Club\n\nfacilities during the initial months but pointed out that thereafter matters settled down\n\nto a more regular routine. It was the defendants’ case that after the initial months\n\nthe facilities at the Club were in fact under-utilised. They therefore denied any failure\n\non their part to provide the premier club that had been promised.67.        A\n\ngreat deal of detailed evidence was adduced by both sides on the utilisation of club\n\nfacilities. The defendants maintained computer records of transactions at the various\n\noutlets and printouts of the daily and monthly sales at the F&B outlets were produced.\n\nMs Lim objected to the production of these printouts. I saw no merit in that objection.\n\nThese were accounting records kept in the normal course of business and were admissible\n\nunder s 34 of the Evidence Act.68.        Ms\n\nLim, relying on the case ofRegina Fur Co Ltd v Bossom[1958] 2 LLR 425, also\n\nobjected to the defendants being allowed to adduce evidence of usage. In that case, Lord\n\nEvershed held that where the defence is one of a bare denial:\"… the onus remains\n\n    throughout upon the plaintiffs to establish the case they are alleging. Where such is the\n\n    form of the pleadings, it is not only not obligatory upon the defendants but it is not\n\n    even permissible for them to proceed to put forward some affirmative case which they have\n\n    not pleaded or alleged; and it is not, therefore, right that they should, by\n\n    cross-examination of the plaintiffs or otherwise, suggest such an affirmative case.\"Ms Lim submitted that the defence\n\nraised in this case was one of bare denial and the defendants therefore ought not to be\n\nallowed to adduce evidence of usage.69.        Mr\n\nShanmugam disagreed. He submitted that the principle in theFurcase applied only\n\nwhere the defendants put the plaintiffs to strict proof and admitted nothing. The present\n\ncase, he submitted, was not of the same genre. In the present case, the defendants had not\n\njust put the plaintiffs to strict proof – the defendants had also denied that the\n\nClub was overcrowded. The defendants were therefore entitled to put forward evidence to\n\nshow that the Club was not overcrowded.70.        I\n\naccept the submission of Mr Shanmugam. The defence in this case was not the sort of bare\n\ndenial that Lord Evershed was dealing with in theFurcase. The defendants here\n\nwere entitled to adduce evidence, in support of their plea, that there was no\n\novercrowding.71.        The\n\nplaintiffs adduced evidence – albeit anecdotal – that even outside the initial\n\nlaunch period (when some degree of congestion was to be expected), the number of\n\nmembers/spouses/guests patronising some of the facilities at the Club was so great that\n\npatrons had, at times, to queue for some time to get a place. It was alleged that some\n\nmembers had even walked away in disgust. The defendants admitted that even after the\n\ninitial months there may have been occasions when members could not immediately get a\n\nplace at the venue of their choice but this, it was claimed, happened rarely. And\n\nwhen it did, it was during public holidays or festive seasons when demand was bound to be\n\nhigh. It was, the defendants submitted, a common feature in all popular restaurants\n\nwherever situate – whether in a prestigious club or not – for there to be high\n\ndemand during such periods.72.        I\n\ndo not propose to rehearse here the evidence relating to usage that was adduced by the two\n\nsides. The evidence was not only from witnesses of fact (including employees of the Club)\n\nbut also from expert witnesses familiar with the operations of clubs and comparisons were\n\nmade between this Club and various other premier clubs in the region. Having heard all the\n\nevidence, I come to the conclusion that the demands on a number of facilities at the Club\n\n(especially the Caf & Terrace; the Chinese restaurant; the swimming pool; the gym;\n\nand the bathing/sauna facilities) were, at times, such that there was considerable\n\npressure on the defendants to cope. This pressure arose because the available facilities\n\nhad to serve the needs of the large membership of 19,000 persons (and their spouses and\n\ntheir guests).73.        \n\nAlthough I find that there was, at times, considerable pressure on the defendants to cope\n\nwith the needs of so many members, I do not find that that pressure was such that it\n\ncrossed the line where it could be said that the Club was no longer the premier club that\n\nwas promised. I would also add, in case the defendants are inclined to admit even more\n\nmembers, that the pressure was very close to that line. Admission of more members can\n\neasily result in that line being crossed. In my view, the membership of the Club, as it\n\nnow stands, is just about the very maximum permissible to sustain the Club as a premier\n\nclub.74.        For\n\nthe above reasons, I dismiss with costs the claims made by the plaintiffs.Sgd:S.
