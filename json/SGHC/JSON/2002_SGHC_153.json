        "Introduction": "The appellant, Heng Aik Peng\n\n(\"Heng\"), was charged under s 7 read with s 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap\n\n195) for abetting one Peh Gim Chuan (\"Peh\"), through a conspiracy, to import a\n\ncontrolled drug into Singapore. At the end of the trial, the district judge convicted Heng\n\nbased on evidence in several statements made by Peh to the Central Narcotics Bureau\n\n(\"CNB\") and sentenced him to 6 years imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. He\n\nappealed against his conviction and after considering arguments from his counsel, I\n\ndismissed the appeal. I now set out my reasons.",
        "Facts": "2        On 3 August 2001, CNB\n\nofficers at Changi Airport suspected several men of being involved in the importation of\n\ncontrolled drugs and arrested them after they returned from Cambodia. Heng and two of his\n\nfriends, Koh Swee Beng and Goh Thiam Soon, were arrested first. Several minutes later, Peh\n\nand another man, Wong Lew Keong (\"Wong\"), were also arrested. Upon examining\n\nPeh’s luggage, the CNB officers found,inter alia, a 'Johnson’s baby\n\npowder' bottle which was filled with a suspicious white substance as well as a mineral\n\nwater bottle. It was later discovered that the substance was the controlled drug,\n\nKetamine, and that this drug was also dissolved in the liquid found in the mineral water\n\nbottle. The total amount of drugs in the two containers totalled 119.16 grams of Ketamine.3        In the early hours of 4\n\nAugust 2001, Peh made a statement to the CNB officers. Two further statements were\n\nrecorded on 21 August 2001 and 23 November 2001. In these statements, Peh implicated Heng,\n\nalleging that Heng had brought him to Cambodia for the purpose of bringing the Ketamine\n\nback into Singapore. According to those statements, Peh met Heng about three months before\n\nhis arrest. At that time, he was working in a handphone shop and the latter had come to\n\nthe shop for his phone to be repaired. Peh subsequently left his job with the handphone\n\nshop and was in financial trouble, having stood as a guarantor for his friends who had\n\nborrowed some money from loan-sharks. As his friends could not repay the loans, Peh owed\n\nthe loan-sharks between $10,000 - $15,000. Peh approached Heng for financial help,\n\nwhereupon the latter suggested that he follow him to Cambodia to do business and promised\n\nthat he would receive about three to four thousand dollars when he returned. Peh agreed\n\nand Heng booked and paid for Peh’s tickets. The duo left for Cambodia on 31 July\n\n2001, accompanied by several of Heng’s friends.4        The statements also stated\n\nthat while in Cambodia, Peh, Heng and their friends consumed Ketamine and Heng suggested\n\nthat they bring some Ketamine back to Singapore. He told Peh that a friend of his would\n\npay him about three to four thousand dollars if he brought the Ketamine back to Singapore.\n\nOn 3 August 2001, the day that Peh and the others were returning to Singapore, the\n\nhotel-keeper gave Peh one small ‘Johnson’ Baby powder bottle and one large\n\nmineral water bottle containing some clear liquid. At the airport, Heng told Peh that the\n\ncontainers held Ketamine and instructed him to be careful when he cleared customs at\n\nChangi Airport. Apparently, Heng also told Peh that after he brought the drugs back to\n\nSingapore, Heng would contact him by telephone to arrange to get the drugs from him.\n\nHowever, this did not transpire as Peh, Heng and their friends were arrested soon after\n\nthey arrived in Singapore.5        At the trial, the\n\nprosecution called several witnesses to the stand, including Peh, Heng’s friends who\n\nhad accompanied them to Cambodia, and the CNB officers who had arrested the men and took\n\ndown Peh’s statements. However, apart from Peh’s statements, none of the\n\nevidence directly implicated Heng as being involved in Peh’s trafficking of the\n\ndrugs. It was therefore significant that Peh retracted his statements at the trial and\n\nalleged that he had brought in the drugs on his own accord. Peh testified that before his\n\nfirst statement was recorded, he was told by a Chinese CNB officer that he would be dealt\n\nwith seriously if he did not tell the truth. Thereafter, he was asked to reveal the\n\nidentity of the person who told him to commit the offence. Peh thought that he would be\n\nbeaten up if he did not provide a name and in order to convince the CNB officers that\n\nothers were involved, he mentioned Heng’s name and sought to push all the blame onto\n\nhim. Apparently, Peh felt that Heng was the most appropriate person to pin the blame on\n\nbecause he was the closest person to him. He also thought that if he\n\n\"co-operated\" with the CNB in this way, he would escape the death penalty.6        According to Peh, the\n\ncircumstances relating to his trip to Cambodia were as follows. In March or April 2001, he\n\nbecame acquainted with Heng, who was a friend of his former employer, Dave Gwee Soon Seng\n\n(\"Dave\"), and who used to frequently visit the handphone shop where Peh worked.\n\nIn July 2001, Peh told Heng that he was going to Cambodia with Dave and asked if he wanted\n\nto accompany them. Heng indicated his willingness to follow them and on 31 July, he left\n\nfor Cambodia with Peh, Dave and several of his friends. The following day, Peh asked a\n\nfriend, one \"Ah Dee\", a resident in Cambodia, to get some Ketamine for his\n\nfriends’ and his own consumption. Indeed, the group of men took doses of the drug at\n\na discotheque. However, before they left, Peh took the leftovers and subsequently put it\n\ninto the 'Johnson’s baby powder' bottle that was found in his luggage. Peh paid for\n\nall the drugs and when asked why he did this, his reply was that he could not expect his\n\nfriends to pay for his expenses all the time.7        As for the mineral water\n\nbottle that contained the Ketamine, Peh testified that he had asked Ah Dee to prepare some\n\nmore drugs for him to bring home. On the third and final day of his trip, a hotel staff\n\ncame into his room and left the bottle on his table when he was having a bath. When Peh\n\nemerged from the toilet, he removed the cap of the bottle and was about to take a drink\n\nwhen he detected a certain smell and realised that it was Ketamine.8        Apparently, only Heng knew\n\nthat Peh was carrying drugs back to Singapore. At the Cambodia airport, Peh confided in\n\nHeng that he was bringing back some Ketamine for his own consumption because he heard that\n\nit would help him with his weight problem. Upon hearing this, Heng cautioned him,\n\ninforming him that there had been very stringent checks lately. Apart from this, Heng was\n\nnot involved in his plan to bring the drugs into Singapore.9        Heng's defence at the trial\n\nwas a bare denial. He testified that he had gone to Cambodia with Peh and Dave to look for\n\nbusiness opportunities and to gamble. Apparently, he hardly knew Peh, having only met him\n\nat Dave's shop. He admitted that he saw Peh at Changi airport where the group of friends\n\nmet. Moreover, they stayed at the same hotel and also went to the discotheque together.\n\nHowever, he denied abetting Peh to bring the drugs into Singapore, claiming that he did\n\nnot even know that Peh was bringing drugs into Singapore.",
        "The decision below": "10        Despite Peh’s\n\nretraction of his statement and Heng’s protestations of innocence, the trial judge\n\ndismissed Heng and Peh’s evidence, choosing to believe the account in Peh’s\n\nstatements instead. In particular, he found Heng to be evasive in his oral testimony, and\n\nheld that Heng only sought to distance himself from any form of association with Peh even\n\nthough it was obvious that they knew each other. One of the points he relied on for this\n\nfinding was the fact that in his statement to the CNB recorded on 4 August 2001, Heng gave\n\nthe impression that he met Peh for the first time at the airport on 31 July 2001. In a\n\nfurther statement he made on 23 August 2001, he even went so far as to state unequivocally\n\nthat he had not met Peh before the trip. However, when he was cross-examined on the latter\n\nstatement, he admitted that this was untrue.11        Furthermore, Heng denied\n\nasking Peh to go to Cambodia with his friends, claiming that he was not even aware that\n\nPeh was going to Cambodia. However, Dave testified that a week before their departure,\n\nHeng had approached Dave with a group of his friends and had asked him to book flight\n\ntickets for them. Dave clearly recalled that Peh was also present to place a booking for\n\nthe tickets. It was therefore apparent that Heng knew that Peh was going to Cambodia.12        In terms of specific\n\ndetails, Heng’s evidence was also less than desirable. For example, he was unable to\n\nrecall whether he occupied a window seat during his flight back to Singapore but was very\n\ncertain that Peh was not seated next to him. This was contradicted by Wong, who testified\n\nthat Heng occupied a window seat and sat beside Peh and one of their friends.13        As for Peh, the trial\n\njudge was satisfied that the evidence suggested that his statements provided a more\n\nreliable account of the circumstances surrounding the offence. For instance, Wong\n\ntestified that on the plane back to Singapore, he heard Heng telling Peh to be careful.\n\nWhile Peh and Heng denied this, the incident was also described in Peh’s statement\n\nrecorded on 23 November 2001 at the Queenstown Remand Prison. Interestingly, this\n\nstatement was made after Peh was convicted and sentenced on 8 November 2001 and as such,\n\nthere was no longer any necessity for him to continue shifting the blame on Heng if this\n\nwas not true. Yet he continued to assert Heng’s involvement in his trafficking of the\n\nKetamine. It was also for this reason that the trial judge rejected Peh’s claim that\n\nhe had pinned the blame on Heng because he feared being beaten up and thought that this\n\nwould do his case some good. While this may have been plausible when he gave his first\n\nstatement, it really would not have hurt him to tell the truth after he was convicted and\n\nsentenced.14        The trial judge was also\n\nunmoved by Peh’s protestations that he had \"aimlessly\" implicated Heng\n\nbecause he was closer to Heng, whereas he was not well acquainted with the others. This\n\ncontention was illogical and unbelievable. If he had indeed wanted to lie in his\n\nstatement, the judge was of the opinion that it would have made more sense for Peh to\n\nframe the others and not Heng, as they were mere acquaintances of Peh’s.15        Apart from Peh’s\n\ninexplicable explanations for his statements, the trial judge was of the view that there\n\nwere no material inconsistencies or contradictions in the statements and that this was a\n\nstrong indication that they were closer to the truth than Peh and Heng’s accounts.\n\nAlso, as the first statement was taken just several hours after his arrest, the facts\n\nwould have been fresh in Peh’s mind and when confronted with incriminating facts, he\n\nwould have had little opportunity to concoct a detailed story implicating Heng. Yet he\n\ngave explicit details in the statement that only he could have known.16        Ultimately, the trial\n\njudge felt that the statements were a clear, reasonable and logical recollection of the\n\nfacts, which indicated that they contained a truthful account of the events. Having\n\nobserved Peh’s demeanour and examined the evidence, the trial judge concluded that\n\nPeh’s oral evidence was unreliable and untruthful. He then impeached Peh’s\n\ncredit and substituted his oral testimony with what he had stated in his statements.17        As a result of the above\n\nconclusions, the trial judge convicted Heng, mindful of the elements required for a person\n\nto be convicted for abetment by conspiracy as well as the need to treat the evidence of an\n\naccomplice with caution. He then sentenced Heng to an imprisonment term of 6 years and 6\n\nstrokes of the cane.",
        "The appeal": "18        In his written\n\nsubmissions, Heng challenged the trial judge’s decision on a number of grounds. These\n\ncan be grouped into three main submissions, the most noteworthy one being that the judge\n\nfailed to adequately consider all the unsatisfactory features in Peh’s statements,\n\nwhich cast serious doubt on their reliability and cogency. In this respect, Heng contended\n\nthat the judge erred in concluding that there were no discrepancies and contradictions in\n\nthe statements and that these strongly indicated that the statements were untrue. To\n\nsupport this contention, he highlighted a number of points, the significant ones being\n\nthat:i        In one of the statements,\n\n    Peh stated that he would be paid between $3,000 to $4,000 for carrying the drugs. However\n\n    in another statement, he did not give an amount but merely said that he would be given\n\n    \"a reward\";ii        Peh claimed that he heard\n\n    Heng and his friends discussing a CNB operation in Singapore. However, this was a bare\n\n    assertion in the statement totally unsupported by the other witnesses who were present in\n\n    Cambodia when the conversation allegedly occurred;iii        Peh had given two\n\n    different versions of when and where Heng told him to be careful when he came out of the\n\n    customs checkpoint in Singapore. In his first statement of 4 August 2001, Peh stated that\n\n    Heng told him that the bottles contained Ketamine and cautioned him before they departed\n\n    for the airport in Cambodia. Yet in his second statement of 21 August 2001, Peh claimed\n\n    that Heng told him that the two bottles contained Ketamine while they were at the airport\n\n    in Cambodia;iv        In the statements and oral\n\n    evidence, the unchallenged evidence was that Peh and Heng did not have each other’s\n\n    contact numbers. However, in one of the statements, Peh stated that Heng would contact him\n\n    to collect the drugs after they arrived in Singapore; andv        Peh would not have agreed\n\n    to bring the drugs into Singapore for only $3,000 to $4,000, considering the serious\n\n    consequences of being arrested for drug trafficking and the fact that the sum would not\n\n    have alleviated his debts of some $10,000 to $15,000.19        I found point (i) to be\n\nentirely unmeritorious since the statements were evidently not inconsistent on this issue.\n\nAs for points (ii) and (iii), Heng was entitled to raise these issues as they were valid.\n\nHowever, the facts in issue were relatively immaterial and these minor inconsistencies did\n\nnot convince me that the trial judge’s conclusions were thereby unsupportable and\n\nwrong. Ultimately, in spite of the minor inconsistency stated in point (iii), what the\n\nstatements consistently maintain is that Heng had asked Peh to carry the Ketamine into\n\nSingapore.20        Turning to the allegation\n\nthat Peh and Heng did not have each other’s contact numbers, my view on this issue\n\nwas that it was really a non-starter because there was evidence that at least one of the\n\nduo knew the other’s handphone number. At the trial, a member of the group, Wong,\n\ngave evidence that at Changi Airport, he saw Peh using the phone and Peh told him that he\n\nwas trying to contact Heng. Flowing from this piece of evidence, two plausible conclusions\n\ncould be reached. First, Peh knew Heng’s number but Heng did not know Peh’s\n\nnumber. This would mean that Peh lied in his statement because Heng could not have called\n\nPeh. The second possibility is that both parties knew each other’s numbers, which\n\nwould mean that Peh’s statement was accurate because Heng could call him. Either\n\nalternatives were possible but they were common in one respect – Peh and Heng lied in\n\ncourt when they said that they did not know each other’s telephone numbers. As such,\n\nthis provided the trial judge with yet another ground in concluding that Peh’s\n\nstatement was more credible and believable than Peh and Heng’s evidence in court.21        Finally, in respect of\n\nHeng’s argument that the statements were untrue as Peh would not have agreed to bring\n\nthe drugs into Singapore for only $3,000 to $4,000, I found it quite plausible that Peh\n\nwould have agreed to do so, despite his assertion to the contrary at the trial. After all,\n\nit was Peh’s own evidence that he was heavily indebted to loan-sharks and that the\n\nloan amount was increasing. He was desperate and could therefore have consented to carry\n\nthe drugs for $3,000 to $4,000 in order to reduce his debt.22        Heng’s second\n\nsubmission was that even if Peh’s explanation for lying was not logical, that did not\n\nmean that the statements contained the truth. This was true. However, the burden of proof\n\nthat the prosecution had to discharge was one of beyond reasonable doubt and not certainty\n\nbeyond a shadow of doubt: seeMiller v Minister of Pensions[1947] 2 All ER 372 at\n\n373 andPP v Ang Soon Huat[1991] 1 MLJ 1at 13. As Peh’s explanation for\n\nmaking the false statements were not logical, my view was that the judge reasonably\n\nconcluded that Peh was lying and that the statements were true, or at least that they were\n\ncloser to the truth than his testimony in court.23        Heng’s third main\n\nsubmission was that the trial judge erred in concluding that he was an evasive witness\n\nsimply because one aspect of his evidence was not consistent with his statement recorded\n\nby the CNB. In his statement, he had stated that he had only met Peh at Changi Airport on\n\nthe day they departed for Cambodia. In his evidence in Court, however, he admitted that he\n\nhad met Peh some months before they left for Cambodia and agreed that his statement was\n\nuntrue. In spite of this concession, Heng took the position that the judge should not have\n\nconcluded that he was evasive as he had not lied because of any feelings of guilt but in\n\norder to distance himself from Peh, who had been arrested for drug trafficking.24        In support of his\n\ncontention that the trial judge should not have found him evasive, Heng’s counsel\n\nreferred to my decision inEr Joo Nguang v PP[2000] 3 SLR 645. Unfortunately, he\n\ncompletely misconstrued the principle for which that case stands for.Er Joo Nguang v\n\nPPwas also a case involving conspiracy by abetment. In that case, the first appellant\n\nwas the managing director of a freight forwarder. The second appellant was the managing\n\ndirector of a retail company, which had purchased certain goods from a Filipino\n\nbusinessman (PW13) that were eventually shipped by the first appellant. Under the terms of\n\npayment, the second appellant was to pay for the goods in order to get the bills of lading\n\nand thereafter obtain the goods from the first appellant. However, shortly after the goods\n\narrived in Singapore, he contacted the first appellant and told him that he needed the\n\ngoods urgently and that he would pay for the goods and obtain the duly endorsed bills of\n\nlading later. The first appellant duly released the goods and when PW13 contacted him on\n\nnumerous occasions to ascertain the whereabouts of his goods and to instruct him not to\n\nrelease the goods, he lied to PW13 and assured him that they were still in his custody.\n\nSome of the goods were eventually sold by the second appellant and the two appellants were\n\ncharged for abetting each other to commit criminal breach of trust of the missing goods.25        After considering the\n\nevidence, I allowed the first appellant’s appeal and acquitted him. In doing so, I\n\nrelied on the English Court of Appeal’s decision inR v Lucas[1981] QB 720\n\nand held that the mere fact that an accused told lies should not be taken as evidence of\n\nhis guilt, although these lies could, in appropriate circumstances, amount to\n\ncorroboration when it indicated a consciousness of guilt. However, before such lies could\n\nbe used as corroborative evidence, I held that four criteria had to be satisfied. First,\n\nthe lie must be deliberate. Secondly it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly, the\n\nmotive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. Fourthly the\n\nstatement must be clearly shown to be a lie by independent evidence. With these principles\n\nin mind, I held that the first appellant’s lies were not sufficient to indicate any\n\nconsciousness of guilt for releasing the goods dishonestly because he did not lie due to a\n\nrealisation of ‘guilt’ but because of an ‘innocent motive’, namely to\n\nbuy time for himself in the hope that PW13 and the second appellant would work out their\n\ndifferences.26        The circumstances of the\n\npresent case were clearly not similar to those inEr Joo Nguang v PP. In that case,\n\nthe prosecution sought to rely on the lies told by the first appellant to prove that he\n\nwas guilty, whereas Heng’s lie was merely referred to by the trial judge as a basis\n\nfor rejecting his evidence for lack of creditworthiness. In my judgment, there was nothing\n\nunsound with the trial judge’s treatment of Heng’s lie. In convicting Heng, the\n\ntrial judge did not rely on Heng’s lie for its evidentiary value as corroborative\n\nevidence, which would have necessitated the application of the criteria stated inEr\n\nJoo Nguang v PP. Instead, he properly used it to determine Heng’s credibility as\n\na witness.27        The distinction between\n\nrelying on an accused’s lies as evidence of guilt and forming a view that his\n\nevidence is not creditworthy because of certain lies is an extremely important one. As\n\npointed out by the court inR v Lucas[1981] QB 720, an accused person may lie for\n\na variety of reasons not connected with guilt of the offences. As such, it is dangerous to\n\nconvict an accused person based on the fact that he lied, unless the criteria inEr Joo\n\nNguang v PPare satisfied. On the other hand, there can be no objection to a\n\ncourt’s reliance on such lies to reach a finding that an accused person’s\n\nevidence lacks creditworthiness, since the lack of credibility does not automatically lead\n\nto his conviction. I found Heng’s submission, thatEr Joo Guang v PPshould be\n\nconstrued to stand for the proposition that so long as an accused person had a valid\n\nexplanation for lying in court, a judge should never find him to be evasive and\n\nuntruthful, to be totally without merit. Such a proposition, which does not appreciate the\n\ndistinction mentioned above, would cripple the legal process as it would effectively\n\nhandicap judges, who have always relied on the veracity and accuracy of witness’\n\nstatements and oral evidence in considering the weight to be placed on their evidence. I\n\nshould also add that none of the numerous cases that have dealt with the treatment of an\n\naccused person’s lies, such asR v Lucas,PP v Yeo Choon Poh[1994] 2 SLR 867and Rv Goodway[1993] 4 All ER 894, give any credence to such a\n\nproposition. In fact, they clearly state that a court need only treat an accused\n\nperson’s lies with caution when they are being relied on as corroborative evidence.28        Ultimately, while Heng\n\nraised one or two valid points in his submissions, his appeal centred on overturning the\n\ntrial judge’s findings of fact. The principle governing such an appeal is clear: an\n\nappellate court will be slow to disturb a trial judge’s findings of fact unless they\n\nare plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence: seeLim Ah Poh v PP[1992] 1 SLR 713andAnthony Ler Wee Teang v PP[2002] 2 SLR 281. After examining the\n\nevidence and scrutinising the trial judge’s grounds, I agreed with his conclusions.29        Apart from the factors\n\nraised by the trial judge, I should also add that there were other factors which showed\n\nthat Peh was not a creditworthy witness. First and foremost, he lied to the court about\n\nthe source of his financial difficulties, claiming that his debts came about because he\n\nstood as a surety for friends who needed to be bailed out of prison. He subsequently\n\nadmitted that this was untrue and that his debts were sustained when he stood as guarantor\n\nto his friends’ debts to certain loan-sharks. Quite apart from this, Heng and\n\nPeh’s oral evidence also led to many unanswered questions. For example, while it is\n\nundisputed that Peh was in serious financial trouble and jobless, his evidence was that he\n\npurchased Ketamine for the entire group’s consumption because he could not expect his\n\nfriends to pay for everything. Furthermore, while Peh and Heng claimed to have gone to\n\nCambodia for business, their days and nights were mainly centred on gambling and\n\nentertainment, activities which Peh could not afford.30        Bearing these factors in\n\nmind, as well as the fact that the trial judge had ample opportunity to consider the\n\ndemeanour of Heng, Peh and the other witnesses at the trial, I found no basis for saying\n\nthat the trial judge’s findings of fact were plainly wrong or against the weight of\n\nthe evidence. As such, I dismissed Heng’s appeal against his conviction.",
