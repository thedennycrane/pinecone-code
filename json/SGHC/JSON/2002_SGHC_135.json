        "ARGUMENTS": "10.        Mr Tan Yeow Hiang, Counsel\n\nfor the Developer, submitted that the High Court had no jurisdiction to order the\n\ntransfer. He referred to various provisions in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap\n\n322) and in the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321).",
        "Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322)": "11.        Section 18(1) to (3)\n\nstates:‘Powers of High Court18.(1)     The High Court shall have\n\n    such powers as are vested in it by any written law for the time being in force in\n\n    Singapore.(2)    \n\n    Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the High Court shall have the\n\n    powers set out in the First Schedule.(3)     The\n\n    powers referred to in subsection (2) shall be exercised in accordance with any written law\n\n    or Rules of Court relating to them.’12.        Clause 10 of the First\n\nSchedule to the SCJA states:‘Transfer of proceedings10.    Power to transfer any proceedings\n\n    to any other court or to or from any subordinate court, and in the case of transfer to or\n\n    from a subordinate court to give any directions as to the further conduct thereof, except\n\n    that this power shall be exercised in such manner as may be prescribed by Rules of\n\n    Court.’13.        Mr Tan stressed that the\n\npower mentioned in Clause 10 was to be exercised ‘in accordance with any written law\n\nor Rules of Court relating to [it]’ and the relevant written law was the Subordinate\n\nCourts Act (Cap 321).",
        "Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321)": "14.        Mr Tan submitted that\n\nthere are three relevant sections in the Subordinate Courts Act relating to the transfer\n\nof an action to the High Court i.e sections 24, 38 and 41.15.        The relevant provision in\n\ns 24 is s 24(1). It states:‘Transfer of counterclaim from District Court to High Cour24.(1)     Where, in an action\n\n    founded on contract or tort in a District Court, any counterclaim or set-off and\n\n      counterclaim of any defendant involves a matter beyond the jurisdiction of the\n\n    District Court, any party to the action may apply to the High Court, within such time as\n\n    may be prescribed by Rules of Court, for an order that the whole proceedings, or the\n\n    proceedings on the counterclaim or set-off and counterclaim, be transferred to the High\n\n    Court.’16.        Section 38 states:‘General power to transfer from District Court to High Court38.    Where it is made to appear to the\n\n    High Court, on the application of a party to any civil proceeding pending in a District\n\n    Court, that the proceeding by reason of its involving some important question of law, or\n\n    being a test case, or for any other sufficient reason, is one which should be tried in the\n\n    High Court, it may order the record to be transferred to the High Court.’17.       The relevant provision in s 41\n\nis s 41(1) which states:‘Allocation of proceeding to High Court41.(1)     The Chief Justice may,\n\n    where he considers it necessary or expedient to improve efficiency in the administration\n\n    of justice and to provide for more speedy disposal of proceedings commenced in the\n\n    District Courts, by order direct such class or classes or description of proceedings as\n\n    may be specified in the order to be heard and determined by the High Court.’18.        Mr Tan submitted that all\n\nthese three provisions show that the transfer of proceedings to the High Court is of\n\nproceedings in the District Court. There is no mention of a transfer of proceedings in the\n\nMagistrate’s Court to the High Court. Applying the expressio unius est exclusio\n\nalterius rule for statutory interpretation, he submitted that Parliament did not intend to\n\nallow an application to be made to transfer a claim/counterclaim from the\n\nMagistrate’s Court to the High Court.19.        He also referred to s 53\n\nof the Subordinate Courts Act which states:‘Transfer from Magistrate’s Courts to District Courts53. A Magistrate’s Court may, either of its own\n\n    motion or on the application of a party to an action, transfer the action to a District\n\n    Court on the ground that some important question of law or fact is likely to arise.’20.        His point was that s 53\n\nreinforced his submission because it provided for a transfer from the Magistrate’s\n\nCourt only to the District Court, and even then, only on the ground ‘that some\n\nimportant question of law or fact is likely to arise’.21.        For the Purchasers, Mr Loh\n\nKim Kee submitted that Clause 10 (of the First Schedule to the SCJA) did not restrict the\n\ncourt from which a transfer could be made by the High Court. The power therein was to\n\ntransfer to or from ‘any subordinate court’ and not just to or from a District\n\nCourt.22.        He also relied on O 89 r\n\n2(1) of the Rules of Court which states:‘Procedure on transfer from the Subordinate Courts (O.89, r.2)2. (1)     Where an order is made by\n\n    the High Court for the transfer of any proceedings from the Subordinate Courts to the High\n\n    Court, the Registrar of the Subordinate Courts must send to the Registrar of the Supreme\n\n    Court the file of the proceedings, all documents, exhibits and a certified copy of the\n\n    notes of evidence (if any) of the proceedings.’23.        This provision also did\n\nnot state that the transfer from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court was restricted\n\nto a transfer from the District Court.24.        Mr Tan countered Mr\n\nLoh’s reliance on O 89 r 2(1) by referring to O 89 r 1(1) which states:‘Time for making application under sections 24,37 and 39 (O.89, r.1)1.(1)    Any application to the High\n\n    Court under sections 24, 37 and 39 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Chapter 321) must be\n\n    made by originating summons in Form 7.’25.        I should add that:(a)    the reference to s 39 of the\n\n    Subordinate Courts Act is probably incorrect as s 39 does not deal with the transfer of\n\n    proceedings. The reference should probably be to s 38 instead,(b)    the heading for O 89 r 1(1) is\n\n    inappropriate as the substance thereof does not deal with the time for making an\n\n       application.26.        Mr Tan’s point was\n\nthat O 89 r 1(1) envisaged the transfer of proceedings only under the provisions\n\nidentified therein and those provisions did not specify a transfer from the\n\nMagistrate’s Court to the High Court.27.        According to Mr Tan and Mr\n\nLoh, the Parliamentary Reports did not assist in the interpretation of the SCJA or the\n\nSubordinate Courts Act.",
        "MY DECISION": "28.        I was of the view that\n\nClause 10 of the First Schedule to the SCJA must be read subject to s 18(3) which\n\nspecifically provides that the powers referred to in s 18(2), which in turn refers to the\n\nFirst Schedule, ‘shall be exercised in accordance with any written law or Rules of\n\nCourt relating to them’.29.        This is consistent with s\n\n18(1) which provides that the ‘High Court shall have such powers as are vested in it\n\nby any written law …’.30.        The written law that was\n\nrelevant for the purpose of the application before me was the Subordinate Courts Act.31.        I was of the view that Mr\n\nTan was correct in his submission that the scheme under that Act envisaged a transfer of\n\nproceedings from only the District Court to the High Court and not from the\n\nMagistrate’s Court to the High Court.32.        As regards the Rules of\n\nCourt, O 89 r 1(1) did not specifically say that a transfer from a subordinate court to\n\nthe High Court is restricted to proceedings in a District Court. It was specifying only\n\nthe form to be used in an application for transfer under the three sections named therein.33.        However, I was of the view\n\nthat the reference to only the three sections mentioned therein which in turn refer to a\n\ntransfer from the District Court to the High Court (ss 24 and 38) or from the High Court\n\nto the District Court (s 37), reinforced the scheme I have mentioned under the Subordinate\n\nCourts Act.34.        Furthermore, although rule\n\n2(1) refers generally to the transfer of ‘any proceedings from the Subordinate Courts\n\nto the High Court’, it should be interpreted in a manner consistent with, and not\n\ncontrary to, the scheme under the Subordinate Courts Act.35.        In my view, there is no\n\ninconsistency between O 89 r 2(1) with that scheme. In any event, subsidiary legislation\n\ncannot over-ride primary legislation.36.        Mr Loh brought up another\n\npoint. He said that if the Purchasers had to file a fresh suit in the High Court, and\n\nwithdraw the counterclaim in the MC suit, they may be caught by a time-bar, in so far as\n\nthe earlier period in respect of their claim was concerned. In my view, the\n\nPurchasers’ claim should not have been filed as a counterclaim in the MC suit in the\n\nfirst place. I should add that Mr Loh was unable to say why this had been done as his firm\n\nwas not acting for the Purchasers at the relevant time.37.        As for the question as to\n\nwhat should be done with regard to the Developer’s claim, it was up to the Developer\n\nto decide whether to proceed with it or withdraw it and file the claim as a counterclaim\n\nin the High Court suit to be filed by the Purchasers so that both claims could be dealt\n\nwith together. While this was far from ideal, it was the result of the scheme of things\n\nprevailing.38.        It may well be that there\n\nshould be some law reform to address the situation which has arisen so that, in future, a\n\nparty in the High Court can apply to have proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court\n\ntransferred to the High Court, if the circumstances warrant such an order. Likewise, for\n\nthe transfer of proceedings from the Magistrate’s Court to the District Court which\n\nis at present limited to an important question of law or fact. However, the question of\n\nlaw reform is a separate matter.39.        In the circumstances, I\n\ndismissed the application with costs.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERSINGAPORECopyright © Government of Singapore."
