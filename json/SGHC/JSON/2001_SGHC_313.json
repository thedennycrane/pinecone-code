        "Close of prosecution": "23 At the close of the prosecution’s case, counsel for the accused\n\ndid not make any submission. Nevertheless, after hearing the prosecution’s submission\n\nand having regard to all the evidence adduced, I was satisfied that the prosecution had\n\nmade out a case, which if unrebutted would warrant the conviction of the accused.\n\nConsequently the standard allocution was administered and the courses open explained to\n\nhim. In the event, the accused elected to give evidence from the witness box.",
        "Evidence of the accused": "24 The evidence of the accused, insofar as was material, was as\n\nfollows.",
        "Family background and personal circumstances": "25 He was born in Thailand on 28 August 1974. He was known to his\n\nfriends and family as ‘Uthorn’. His father is a farmer. His mother is currently\n\nmentally incapacitated, unable to work and sometimes even unable to visit temples. He is\n\nthe youngest in a family of seven children. He studied up to secondary six in a Thai\n\nmedium school. He left school at the age of about 18 and started working as a factory hand\n\nand later as a construction worker.26 He was once married to a woman named ‘Urai Wan’. She bore\n\nhim a child, a boy who is now three years of age. His family has a history of mental\n\nillness. His mother has been mentally ill for some time and is on medication. One of his\n\nbrothers also suffers from mental illness amounting to insanity.27 Whilst he was in Thailand, at times he did not know what he was\n\nactually doing. Whenever he tried to think a little more, his head became ‘hot’.\n\nAs a result, his father took him to Dr Samsak, a medical doctor and was given some\n\nmedication for his symptoms. The medicine prescribed to him was similar to those given to\n\nhis mother. Since then he had been on medication to alleviate bouts of stress he would\n\nconstantly be under.28 He also suffered from sleeplessness. To rid of it, he had to resort\n\nto paracetamol tablets; the dosage for each occasion increased from three tablets\n\ninitially to six to seven later.29 His wife left him for another man who is younger than her. As he\n\nloved her dearly, he entertained thoughts of ending his life. He even went to the extent\n\nof handing over a gun to his wife on one occasion and invited her to commit suicide\n\njointly with him. Fortunately, his mother happened to arrive at the scene and the tragedy\n\ndid not materialise. On another occasion before his wife left him for good, he rode a\n\nmotorcycle with his wife as a pillion and crashed into a lamp post. The result was that\n\nboth of them were injured and he had to spend about two months in the hospital for a\n\nbroken shoulder bone. He also on several occasions together with his wife attempted to end\n\ntheir lives by hanging. But on each occasion, his wife would call for help and the\n\nattempts did not succeed.30 He did not understand what was happening to him. He was greatly\n\naffected by his separation from his wife and son. He in fact wanted to take care of his\n\nson but his mother-in-law would not let him.31 At times he was not conscious of what he was doing. Sometimes he\n\nleft home naked; he was forgetful; he became very suspicious for no apparent reason; he\n\ndid not trust anyone. Before he came to Singapore he always carried guns. He was under\n\nstress and used to shoot aimlessly into the sky. He did not however seek any medical\n\nattention because he was afraid of seeing doctors but he visited the clinic his mother\n\nused to go to.32 He was tormented by one of his elder brothers. This brother used to\n\nbully him and beat him up for no reason. He did not seem to like him. He recalled an\n\ninstance when his brother used a knife to cut him up so badly that he was given 11\n\nstitches for the injuries. He was also often mocked by his fellow pupils in school because\n\nhe used to do things which the others did not. He used to wear clothes inside out when he\n\ncame out of the bathroom. He also frequently shouted whilst the classes were in session.\n\nWhilst in Thailand he used to smoke a lot and drink so excessively that once he had to be\n\nwarded in a hospital for about two or three weeks. He drank because he wanted to relieve\n\nhis stress.",
        "First visit to Singapore": "33 He first came to Singapore sometime in 1998. Although he was told\n\nthat he would be entering Singapore lawfully by the person to whom he had paid 50,000 Baht\n\nto arrange the trip, things took an ugly turn when he arrived in Malaysia. There he was,\n\nto his dissapointment, made to hide inside a bus and was smuggled into Singapore. He was\n\ncaught upon arrival, arrested for illegal entry and in the event repatriated to Thailand\n\nat the end of 1998.",
        "Next visit": "34 Sometime at the end of 1999, he returned to Singapore, this time\n\nlegally. He paid about 100,000 Baht to the agent for this trip. He was employed by Lean\n\nHin Lee Contractor Pte Ltd on a valid work permit. He was paid a salary of $23 per day.\n\nHis normal working hours were from 8.00am to 5.00pm. After that it was overtime work.\n\nInitially he used to work even on Sundays. He was required to do all sorts of work at the\n\nconstruction site involving digging, formwork, cementing, dismantling and sometimes\n\nsteel-work. For his work, he was issued with a normal hammer, a hook hammer, a safety\n\nhelmet, a bag of nails and a spanner. He identified exh P-177 as the hook hammer that was\n\nissued to him.35 Recounting his relationship with his fellow workers and roommates at\n\nthe construction site, he said he treated them with respect as his elders. However, for\n\nreasons unknown to him, he did not like to talk to them and seldom did.36 Initially, when he first started at his job, he was able to cope\n\nwith his work. Later he encountered problems. About a month prior to his arrest, his\n\nfaculties did not seem to function well. His performance was dotted with\n\n‘mistakes’. He was under stress and lost interest in doing overtime work as he\n\ndid not have the will power to do so (page 1027 of the NE). Yet, he forced himself to work\n\nfor fear that his salary would be deducted. He wanted to return to Thailand and he made\n\nthis known to his boss Ah Chai (PW-24 Chew). He could not concentrate on his work; his\n\nhead was very hot and that seemed to recur almost everyday. Whenever he had such a\n\nsensation, he would pour water on his head; he took paracetamol daily; his body was weak\n\n(page 1029 of the NE). He had constant headaches and was unable to sleep. To relieve his\n\nstress he began to shout. This he did either by going to the seaside near his quarters\n\nafter work or whilst sitting (page 1030, lines 1 to 5 of the NE).37 He visited Pasir Ris Park almost everyday and spent countless hours\n\nthere without being aware of the time he remained there. On one occasion when he looked at\n\na child at the park, he could not control his emotions and started crying with the result\n\nthat the person who accompanied the child had to take the child away from that place.38 He did not confide his problems to anyone, not even to his foreman.\n\nHe did not trust anyone. He liked listening to their stories but no one knew his.\n\nCommenting on the evidence of his colleagues who said he used to listen to music whilst he\n\nwas in his room, he said that he did but most of the songs he used to listen concerned\n\nlife as they had the effect of alleviating his stress.39 He claimed that he drank a lot to relieve stress (page 1033 and 1034\n\nof the NE). Recalling the incident when he injured a dog, he said that about one or two\n\nmonths prior to his arrest, after he finished work at about 5.00pm, he made a telephone\n\ncall to his father. His father told him that he missed his grandson, referring to the\n\naccused’s infant son. As the accused also missed his son he informed his father that\n\nhe wanted to return home. He then kept himself inside his room for a while. Later he came\n\ndown to the kitchen area where he saw his colleague Samran drinking. Saneh and Somphan\n\nalso joined them.40 Presently, Samran left the kitchen area briefly to buy another\n\ndrink, leaving the accused, Somphan and Saneh behind. Moments later the accused also left\n\nthe place to retrieve the cell phone he had left in his quarters for charging its battery\n\nand returned immediately thereafter. Samran also returned at about this time. Whilst all\n\nof them were resuming their drinks, Samran complained to them that he had lost $200 which\n\nhe had kept inside his cell phone. None of them present believed that Samran had indeed\n\nlost any money. The accused who had only $100 with him showed Samran the cash and\n\ninstantly removed a gold chain he was wearing, handed it to Samran telling him that he\n\ncould sell the chain, take $200 from the proceeds and return the balance to him. Samran\n\ndeclined the offer.41 Later, the accused got up to prepare food for the others. At that\n\ntime, he heard his colleagues talking about their family, their wives and children.\n\nSuddenly, whilst the accused was slicing the meat, he grabbed hold of the dog standing\n\nnearby and used the kitchen knife to slash its back. He did not know what he was doing and\n\nregained his faculties only when he heard the dog crying (page 1040 of the NE). He did not\n\nknow why he hurt the dog.42 Narrating his friendship with his girlfriend Phensuwan he said that\n\nhe had first met her about three to four months prior to his arrest when she used to come\n\nto the worksite to sell food. Later they became close. In examination-in-chief, the\n\naccused claimed that he had sex with her on one or two occasions. But in\n\ncross-examination, he denied having sex with her and said that he did not have any sexual\n\nurge and could not perform.43 He claimed that he had been intending to end his relationship with\n\nPhensuwan as he was aware that they both belonged to different backgrounds and worse, her\n\nmother did not quite like him. However, he could not end the relationship as he felt that\n\nsuch a move would hurt her.44 Speaking about the gambling sessions that went on at the worksite on\n\npay days, he confirmed that he and his colleagues usually played a card game known as\n\n‘Poke Deng’ on pay days and invariably on all occasions he would be the banker.\n\nHe claimed that except on 9 June 2000 when he lost about $400, he was very successful in\n\ngambling and that he was never short of cash. He denied that on 9 June 2000, after losing\n\nall his cash, he approached Samran for a loan. As to the suggestion that he was broke on\n\n14 June 2000 and as a result his girlfriend had to foot his MRT fare, pay for his dinner\n\nand offer him $10, he denied it. He claimed that he would never accept any monetary help\n\nfrom anyone other than his mother. He asserted that he had about $400 with him that day\n\nbut when Phensuwan gave him $10 he did not decline it and simply kept it in his wallet,\n\nalthough he was puzzled by her offer.45 He said that he had been a friend of one Wanchai Meeying (Wanchai)\n\nsince young. Wanchai arrived in Singapore illegally and managed to find a good employer.\n\nThey met frequently. Wanchai had become his confidant to whom the accused could relate his\n\npersonal problems. When he was depressed he would always confide in him. Wanchai tried to\n\nhelp him by taking him to church.46 He claimed that after 9 June 2000 until his arrest on 16 June 2000,\n\nhe did not do any work at the construction site. He averred that after collecting his\n\nsalary on 9 June 2000 he informed his supervisor that he was not going to work anymore.\n\nHowever, each night he returned to his quarters to sleep there. He stopped work because he\n\nwas ‘discouraged … did not feel like working and [was] unable to work …\n\n(page 1081, lines 19-20).",
        "Events of 14 June 2000": "47 On 14 June 2000 he was with Wanchai the whole day. Later after\n\ndinner at a Geylang seafood restaurant both of them ambled along to Golden Mile Complex at\n\nBeach Road. On their way, they came across a group of Thais near a park. One of the group\n\nmembers who looked inebriate uttered something. Wanchai and the accused ignored him.\n\nSuddenly, a slipper was hurled in the direction of Wanchai and landed on his back. Wanchai\n\nwas not amused. He turned around, walked up to the drunk who threw the missile, confronted\n\nthe person and told him that one Thai should not behave in that manner to another Thai.\n\nSuddenly, there was a brawl and one of the Thais in the group punched Wanchai. The accused\n\nmanaged to steer Wanchai out of the melee and as they started running from the scene,\n\nthree or four persons from the group gave chase and eventually caught up with the accused\n\nand Wanchai. A fight ensued. In the end, both of them were able to subdue the assailants.\n\nThe accused presently heard an object dropping on the ground and he instinctively picked\n\nit up (page 1087 lines 11 and 12 of the NE).48 In the event, both of them bounded up to the Golden Mile Complex and\n\nstopped close to a bus-stop near the complex. There the accused tucked the object which he\n\nhad earlier picked up under his jacket. He was at that time wearing a pair of trousers, a\n\nT-shirt and a jacket over it. The object he had just tucked in was a metal pipe.49 He noticed Wanchai who was bleeding from his nose was wiping the\n\nblood with his T-shirt. Shortly thereafter, Wanchai left the accused after intimating that\n\nthey should meet again the following day at the Golden Mile Complex.50 The accused managed to get an NTUC taxi to take him to his quarters\n\nfor the night. After he boarded the taxi, he told the taxi driver to proceed to Lorong\n\nHalus. He told him to take the expressway towards Jalan Eunos through Kaki Bukit and\n\nthence to Pasir Ris.51 The accused was seated at the rear of the taxi somewhere near to the\n\ncentre and gave directions to the taxi driver. The driver followed his instructions and\n\ncontinued driving. Suddenly the accused sensed something amiss. He noticed that the taxi\n\ndriver was peering at him through the rear view mirror. The accused then looked at himself\n\nand realised that the left front of his jacket was stained with blood. The accused tried\n\nto avoid the gaze of the driver and moved to the left. The driver still kept on looking at\n\nhim. The accused became uncomfortable and started imagining a lot of things. Soon the\n\ndriver asked him in English: ‘You fighting’ (page 1097, lines 1 to 8). The\n\naccused shook his head and replied: ‘No, no.’ He was worried. He thought that\n\nthe taxi driver was going to call the police through his handphone. When he saw the driver\n\npressing some numbers on his phone, the accused made a gutteral sound: \"Ahem\n\nAhem\" – as if clearing his throat. The driver at once put aside his phone. The\n\ndriver muttered something in Chinese which the accused could not make out. He felt very\n\nuneasy and was unable to relate the thoughts which went through his mind (page 1100 of the\n\nNE).52 The taxi had by now arrived at Lorong Halus. The accused changed his\n\nmind at this point of time and instructed the taxi driver to continue driving straight.\n\nThe driver obliged. In the event, they came to a traffic light at a cross-junction nearby.\n\nThe accused directed the driver to turn left without knowing where that route would lead\n\nthem to. Shortly thereafter, the accused told the taxi driver to stop and inquired about\n\nthe fare.53 At this juncture, the taxi driver again attempted to use his phone.\n\nThe accused could not really recall what had happened thereafter. When he regained\n\nconsciousness, he noticed that the taxi driver had already collapsed (page 1102, lines 6\n\nto 10 of the NE). Presently, he grabbed the handphone from the dashboard of the vehicle,\n\nopened the vehicle door and bolted towards the cross-junction nearby.54 He recalled that when he saw the taxi driver collapse, he was\n\nholding the metal pipe which he had earlier tucked under the waistband of his trousers.55 As he arrived at the cross-junction after the incident, he happened\n\nto observe the 7-Eleven store which he used to patronize on many an occasion. Once he had\n\nregained his bearings, he started running and soon arrived at a bus-stop. There he noticed\n\nthat the metal pipe he was holding was stained with blood. He also realised that he was\n\nalso then holding the driver’s handphone as well as his wallet (page 1104 of the NE).\n\nHe then discarded the blood-stained metal pipe and his jacket into a dustbin. Thereafter,\n\nhe examined the taxi driver’s wallet and after removing the driver’s senior\n\ncitizen’s card and cash amounting to $60, he discarded the wallet into a dustbin.56 He was frustrated with himself and did not understand ‘how [he]\n\nhad used the pipe to hit [the taxi driver] (page 1107, lines 1 to 10).57 When he viewed the taxi driver’s senior citizen card, he was\n\nreminded of his father; the driver looked like his father. His father had always advised\n\nhim to face things and not to run away from problems. The accused mused: ‘I really\n\nwant someone to answer my questions’ … (page 1111, line 17 of the NE) [about]\n\nthe ‘things that had happened to me, why and how it had happened’ (page 1112,\n\nline 1 of the NE).58 He did not know why he decided to take the $60 from the wallet\n\nbefore he threw it away. As to the hand phone he removed from the taxi, he wanted to\n\ndestroy it first but in the end he retained it with him. From the bus-stop he walked\n\ntowards his work site.59 On the way to his quarters (which was about 200 metres from the\n\nbus-stop) he kept on looking at the taxi-driver’s senior citizen card until he was\n\nable to memorise the name of the driver. Before he reached his living quarters, he stopped\n\nby at a Chinese altar at the construction site office where he lighted a few joss sticks\n\nand prayed for forgiveness and the well-being of the wounded driver.60 Eventually he arrived at his quarters. He could not sleep even after\n\na shower. He was confused. He wished someone could understand and help him. He then\n\ndecided to call the police and dialled 999. However, when he heard a woman’s voice on\n\nthe other end, he was at a loss and was unable to communicate. As he knew only a few words\n\nof English, he left the phone unattended for a short period. He wanted to relate to the\n\npolice what had happened but in the event he did not.61 Subsequently, he decided to call Montree with a view to getting in\n\ntouch with his friend Tossapol to tell him everything about the incident. Tossapol and\n\nMontree were located at a different work place, a few kilometres away. Montree could not\n\nbe reached. The handphone he had with him was in the ‘on-mode’ all the while.\n\nSometime later he heard the phone ring. He pressed the ‘yes’ button to answer\n\nthe phone but the caller did not say anything. After that he switched the phone off.62 On the morning of 15 June 2000, he did not go to work. Instead, he\n\nwent to Golden Mile Complex at about 9.00 to 10.00am to meet Wanchai. He did not relate to\n\nWanchai what had happened the preceding night. The accused by then had made up his mind\n\nnot to run away. He surmised that had he related the events to Wanchai, the latter would\n\nhave smuggled him away, even though his passport was still with his employers.63 Wanchai told the accused that he had to leave for home to attend to\n\nsome problems. The accused then gave him $300 leaving a balance of about $100 excluding\n\nthe money he had taken from the taxi driver’s wallet.64 Sometime around noon that day, the accused returned to his quarters\n\nand learnt that a team of police officers had visited the site earlier. He was also told\n\nthat his supervisor Chew wanted to see him in the canteen. He later saw his supervisor and\n\nwhen asked, informed him that he would report for work the next day, although he really\n\ndid not intend to work any longer.65 After speaking with his supervisor, he left his quarters to meet\n\nTossapol. On his way, at the entrance to the Pasir Ris MRT Station, he handed the $60\n\nwhich he had taken from the taxi driver to a disabled person busking nearby. He then took\n\nout the SIM card from the handphone of the taxi driver and threw it in the dustbin nearby.\n\nThis done, he left for Tossapol’s quarters near Jalan Eunos. He did not, however,\n\nmeet Tossapol as he was advised by one of the foremen to leave the place immediately.\n\nThere were some policemen present at the site.66 He later returned to his worksite. Before reaching his living\n\nquarters he stopped at the Chinese altar again. There, after saying prayers, he took out\n\nthe card of the taxi driver in his possession, tore it into two, placed it on top of an\n\nempty paint tin lying in the vicinity and returned to his quarters. Once at his quarters,\n\nhe placed the handphone in one of his safety boots. He placed one of his wallets which\n\ncontained the photograph of his girlfriend in another boot.67 He said that before his arrest he also met his girlfriend on the\n\nnight of 15 June 2000. He told her that it was likely that he would be arrested and if the\n\npolice were to question her, she should say that she was with him at the Golden Mile\n\nComplex from 6.00pm on 14 June 2000 till 6.00 am the following day (ie, 15 June 2000). His\n\ngirlfriend was very distressed. She suggested to him that he should leave Singapore for\n\nThailand and stay with her elder brother’s friends at a military camp there. But he\n\nmade it known to her that he was not going to run away.68 He was arrested at about 4.15am on 16 June 2000 and thereafter taken\n\nto the CID. At the CID lock-up he tried to harm himself by banging his head against the\n\nwall. Following an alarm raised by two of his cell mates, he was transferred to a padded\n\ncell. There again he tried to harm himself by removing some wires from the padding. His\n\nattempts were thwarted. He said that he banged his head against the wall because his head\n\nwas filled with a lot of thoughts (page 1164, line 4 of the NE). He was thinking about the\n\ntaxi driver as he did not expect the driver to die.69 After he was transferred to the Queenstown Remand Prison, he again\n\ntried to hang himself. He tore a towel into small ribbons, joined them together and made a\n\nloop. He then used some toilet tissues to cover the lens of the surveillance camera inside\n\nthe cell. He was planning to end his life. Whilst he was at it, the warden of the remand\n\nprison arrived and in the event he was transferred to another cell where he was chained to\n\na bed for sometime. At some point in time of his remand, he was also sent to Changi Prison\n\nHospital where he remained for a few days.70 He produced a copy of a letter which he wrote to Wanchai Meeying\n\nwhilst he was at the Queenstown Remand Prison. This letter produced by the defence (exh\n\nD-1/P-131) reads as follows:I wish to tell you about what had happened in detail as I feel it is\n\n  the right time to do so.It is only now since my arrest that my mind is in a state of peace\n\n  Previously, I was very stressed like I had been in the past. They never understood me at\n\n  all. For over ten years that we knew each other, I think you are the only person who\n\n  understands me the most. We have lived and grown up together.All the while before my payday, the 9th, I have accompanied\n\n  you to look for a job in Jurong until the last day – the date of the incident. That\n\n  night, there was a group of people drinking rice wine. One of the people from the group\n\n  threw his shoes and hit your back. After our separation at the bus stop, I took a taxi\n\n  back to my quarters. On the way the problem developed. The taxi driver saw some blood\n\n  stains on my shirt and kept staring at them. The blood stains were from your bleeding nose\n\n  earlier. I felt a very deep sense of mistrust and self-consciousness, something that I\n\n  felt before on many occasions. It felt as if he really wanted to tell on me. I did not\n\n  feel like my usual self.Before the taxi was going to turn into Lorong Ah Loo, I told the taxi\n\n  driver to go straight until the car reached a cross section. I instructed him to turn\n\n  left. Earlier, I saw him trying to call the police so many times that it aroused my\n\n  suspicions. When the taxi turned into the left lane as I instructed, I told him to stop\n\n  the car. I saw him pressing the fare meter and trying to dial numbers on his phone once\n\n  more. I used a metal object, which I took from the group of people mentioned earlier, to\n\n  hit his head. At that time, I did not know how it had happened. I saw him collapse. I\n\n  grabbed his phone and took his wallet, which was placed on the dashboard. I quickly ran to\n\n  a bus stop and stopped there. I did not know then as to why I took his wallet along with\n\n  me. I tried very hard to find the reasons but to no avail. I took off my shirt and threw\n\n  it together with the metal object into the rubbish bin at the bus stop. I opened the\n\n  wallet and took out the taxi driver’s card and some money before throwing the wallet\n\n  into the rubbish bin without checking other items in it. The amount of money, I took if I\n\n  am not wrong, was about $60/-.I walked back to my quarters. On the way, I kept looking at the\n\n  driver’s card until I could remember his name clearly. His name was Ong Huay Dee,\n\n  aged 65, Singapore national. When I reached the site office where a Chinese alter was set\n\n  up nearby, I lighted some joss sticks to pray for his forgiveness and prayed to Buddha\n\n  that nothing would happen to him. I returned to my quarters. That whole night I could not\n\n  sleep at all. The following morning, I decided to call the police. I did dial but I, as\n\n  you know my English was poor and I was afraid the police might not understand me, later\n\n  changed my mind. I called \"Montree\" instead with the intention of telling\n\n  \"Thotsaphon\" about what had happened but the line was engaged.That morning, I thought very hard about what to do. I heard the phone\n\n  rang about 2-3 times and that made me more nervous. I did not tell my colleagues at the\n\n  work site about the incident as I was still confused. I took a shower and later left for\n\n  Golden Mile Complex to meet you as arranged earlier. When you saw me, you asked me what\n\n  had happened as I looked unwell. I told you that there was nothing wrong with me. I did\n\n  not tell you about the incident because I did not want you to worry about me. After I gave\n\n  you some money for your trip back to Thailand, I returned to my quarters. While I was\n\n  there, my friends told me that the police had earlier come to our work site. I had, at\n\n  that moment in time, thought the police came to look for me. I then went to the G & W\n\n  construction site where \"Thotsaphon\" worked. Upon arriving there, I saw the\n\n  police arrested my friends. I thought the police must have known every thing about the\n\n  incident and would arrest me at my quarters that night.I went to meet my girl friend, Nong Tan, at Geylang, Lor 30. I did not\n\n  tell her about the incident but instead instructed her if any person asked her about my\n\n  whereabouts on the night before, she had to tell them she was with me that night. At that\n\n  time, I thought if I were to be apprehended by the police, I would ask to see her at the\n\n  police station.Do you still remember that beggar? I gave him the money I took from Mr\n\n  Ong Huay Dee. I also discarded his phone’s SIM card into a rubbish bin at the MRT\n\n  station. I later went back to my site office again. There, I lighted some joss sticks and\n\n  swore that I would not run away from the police. All these while, the taxi driver’s\n\n  card was with me. I went back to the alter to ask for his forgiveness again. Thereafter, I\n\n  placed the card on a can and returned to my quarters.As expected, the police came to the quarters. While I was being\n\n  handcuffed, I felt my face being stamped by a police’s boot. I have never been\n\n  treated as such manner since birth. They never gave me any chance to speak. I had no\n\n  opportunity to speak from the date of my arrest until I was transferred to Changi prison.\n\n  I did confide in 2 strangers. It was so stressful that I thought of committing suicide at\n\n  the C.I.D. once and at the Queenstown prison about 2 – 3 times. I found myself\n\n  pulling my hair continuously until I almost became bald. I also resorted to writing to\n\n  relieve my stress. I even asked the prison wardens to kill me.They believe that they have all the evidence to convict me. I just want\n\n  them to understand my feelings. While I was in C.I.D., I was told that Mr. Ong Huay Dee\n\n  had passed away. Upon hearing the news, I was very saddened. I believed they thought I\n\n  must have intended to kill him. You and my parents know me well that I have never had such\n\n  ill intention in my life.I cried the whole of last night and decided that this was going to be\n\n  the last time I would think of this case. I do not want such a terrible incident to happen\n\n  to me again.Do you remember what I told you about my dream of coming here again and\n\n  the reasons – the cleanliness and progress of this country. I tried to study very\n\n  hard so that I could pass the skill tests. I did not only pass the tests but also emerged\n\n  as number one in my class. As a result, my dream was realised and I am now here.Since youth, I have, for almost 25 years, been dreaming of owning a\n\n  hand phone and I really had one in Singapore. Unfortunately, I had such a bad friend like\n\n  \"Montree\" who caused me trouble. I did not expect that my return to Singapore\n\n  this time has shattered my dreams.I believe you can understand my feeling now. You also know that I have\n\n  a mental problem as you even took me to a church.I want you to pass this letter to my father, mother, sisters and\n\n  brothers to read so that they will know what has happened to me. I hope they will\n\n  understand me.Even though, Singapore has a lot of rules and regulations, I have\n\n  complied and never challenged them. You must know that I am capable of this.71 The next witness called by the defence was Supt Lim Chong Teng from\n\nthe Queenstown Remand Prison. In his evidence, he confirmed that the accused was reported\n\nto have attempted to commit suicide on one occasion by joining pieces of a torn towel. He\n\nfurther mentioned that on a separate occasion, the accused used toilet paper to block a\n\nclosed circuit TV camera installed in his cell. Supt Lim added that the accused also on an\n\noccasion scribbled some poems in memory of his girlfriend and his mother. The words were\n\nwritten in blood.72 The other witness for the defence was Dr Douglas Kong Sim Guan\n\n(‘Dr Kong’), a consultant psychiatrist in private practice. His opinion as\n\nappears in his report dated 22 January 2001 reads thus:OpinionFrom the account provided by Khwan-On and the mental state\n\n  examination, it is my opinion that Khwan-On has been suffering from a Major Depression\n\n  since the beginning of 2000. This depression is characterized by symptoms of insomnia,\n\n  depression, weepiness, suicidal and negative thoughts, social withdrawal, early morning\n\n  awakening, feelings of tension (relieved by shouting) and abuse of alcohol. He also had\n\n  somatic symptoms of palpitation, breathlessness (dyspnoea), headaches, sensation of his\n\n  head bursting and a \"hot\" sensation. Khwan-On was predisposed to a Major\n\n  Depressive illness by the following factors: his mother had a history of psychiatric\n\n  treatment, he had a history of physical abuse from his eldest brother for many years, he\n\n  had an introverted personality and related poorly with a tendency to keep things to\n\n  himself and marital difficulties including being rejected by his wife and feeling\n\n  inadequate, insecure and a loss of self-esteem.This Major Depression had been untreated and Khwan-On had relied on\n\n  shouting to relieve his tension, and crying and alcohol to relieve his sensation of pain\n\n  and sadness. His depression had caused him to sometimes lose control of himself and when\n\n  he was upset and dazed by his friend’s description of their happy families, he\n\n  instinctively became affected and without realizing, he was inflicting harm with a knife\n\n  on a helpless dog. Fortunately, he realized it when he saw blood and stopped what he did.\n\n  However, the incident in the taxi was not so. If not for the scuffle that occurred when\n\n  Wanchai was attacked by some Thai men, which led to Wanchai having a bleeding nose, his\n\n  shirt would not have been bloodstained and his taxi ride back home would be uneventful as\n\n  it had been previously.As it turned out, Wanchai sustained a bleeding nose during the scuffle\n\n  and in his desire to help, Wanchai’s bleed got to stained his shirt and picked up a\n\n  metal rod thrown at them. It was the bloodstained shirt that attracted the attention of\n\n  the taxi driver who according to Khwan-On tried to contact the police on the handphone.\n\n  The taxi driver was probably being civic minded or doing it for his self-protection in\n\n  case he would be harmed by the passenger that was Khwan-On. But the action of the taxi\n\n  driver caused Khwan-On to be fearful and somewhat paranoid. Khwan-On was probably\n\n  sensitized to criminal offences by his arrest for being an illegal worker on his first\n\n  visit to Singapore. Having been caned and having been in jail, a fear of the law and the\n\n  police of Singapore would have been ingrained in his memory. These fears were likely to be\n\n  aroused by the act of the taxi driver dialing a number three times causing Khwan-On to\n\n  deduce that the number dialed was the number to the police, 999. These paranoid fears\n\n  about what would happened to him if the police were to apprehend him for whatever reasons\n\n  probably prompted him to move away from the driver’s gaze and to direct the driver\n\n  away from his actual worksite where he stayed.If he had alighted safely and got away, the alleged offence would not\n\n  have occurred. It was unfortunate that the driver had dailed the handphone and this caused\n\n  him to be in a state of panic which caused him to be in a dazed or dissociative state\n\n  similar to that of the dazed state a month before the alleged offence when he used a knife\n\n  to cut a harmless dog. This state of panic induced by his paranoid fears as to what would\n\n  happen if the driver succeeded in informing the police led Khwan-On to develop a Paranoid\n\n  Reaction. His instinctive reaction was to protect himself and as he had the metal rod\n\n  which he picked up at the scene of the scuffle to protect himself, he used it to venge his\n\n  anger and frustration at the taxidriver. He then took the object of his fear, the\n\n  handphone and the wallet together with it and fled.He appeared to be acting in the belief that the driver was out to harm\n\n  him by calling the police. He also appeared to harbour beliefs that if the police were to\n\n  find him with a bloodstained shirt, he would be in trouble with the law again and since\n\n  the Depression had impaired his judgment and reasoning process, it was natural that these\n\n  beliefs became transformed into paranoid fears and thoughts upon which he acted and thus\n\n  he assaulted the taxi driver in the belief that he was defending himself without knowing\n\n  why. He was in a state of confusion, his mind was dazed and he was probably in a\n\n  dissociative state induced by the Depressive Illness as well as the paranoid fears and the\n\n  attendant Paranoid Reaction that was activated by the driver’s actions. It is\n\n  therefore my opinion that the Depression had impaired his perception, judgment,\n\n  concentration, and executive function. Due to a confluence of circumstances which included\n\n  the scuffle, the bloodstain and the metal rod and the behaviour of the taxi driver;\n\n  paranoid ideas, fears and thoughts were aroused and activated. These constituted a\n\n  Paranoid Reaction which caused him to dissociate when he went into a state of panic just\n\n  before he was about to alight and set in motion by the perception that the driver was\n\n  dialing for the police. As such, Khwan-On might not be in full control of his mental\n\n  capacity at the time of the offence and he might not be aware of the likely consequences\n\n  of his actions as he acted in a state of confusion and panic. In this sense, Khwan-On was\n\n  labouring under a defective state of mind momentarily when he was committing the alleged\n\n  offence and the offence was committed as a result of a reaction to coincidental\n\n  circumstances occurring in sequence rather than that of a premeditated plan that he\n\n  conceived of prior to the offence. Khwan-On came out of the confusional state which\n\n  characterised his Paranoid Reaction, when he reached the second bus stop and he sat down\n\n  in a safe place and had the time to contemplate what he had just done. The realization\n\n  that he had done something terrible and wrong set in at that time and he began to have\n\n  feelings of revulsion and remorse over the events with attendant feelings of anger and\n\n  regret.73 In his testimony, Dr Kong said that having heard and observed the\n\naccused testifying in court, he was of the view that the accused probably suffered\n\ndissociative amnesia. Dr Kong further said that the narration of crucial events in the\n\naccused’s police statements as well as in court as to what happened in the taxi, was\n\nprobably a reconstructed account. He suggested that the reconstruction was done by the\n\naccused after being made aware of the events by the police. Dr Kong stated that\n\ndissociative amnesia could set in when a person is under severe stress. Further according\n\nto him, in the case of the accused it set in when the taxi driver pressed the meter and\n\nattempted to use the hand phone. Dr Kong opined that the accused came out of the\n\ndissociative state when he was at the bus stop. Dr Kong’s explanation of the\n\naccused’s behaviour in the taxi was that he was suffering from a brief psychotic\n\ndisorder.74 Dr Kong further testified that the accused fulfilled the criteria\n\nfor major depression. Commenting on the attempt by the accused to call the police just\n\nafter the incident, Dr Kong said that it reflected a remorseful action on the part of the\n\naccused to get people to understand what he had gone through.75 During cross-examination Dr Kong conceded that in his medical report\n\nhe did not mention ‘brief psychotic disorder’ and ‘dissociative\n\namnesia’. Dr Kong amended his medical report to read that \"the accused had been\n\nsuffering from a major depression which had its beginnings from January to February\n\n2000\" instead of his earlier assertion that \"the accused had been suffering from\n\na major depression from the beginning of January to February 2000.\"76 In sum, Dr Kong’s conclusion was that in the months of May and\n\nJune 2000, the accused was suffering from major depression (page 1660, lines 13 to 19 of\n\nthe NE). He also opined that a depressed person can work at tremendous cost to himself\n\n(page 1666, lines 2 to 11 of the NE) and that explained how he was able to make between\n\n$4,000 to $5,000 a month in gambling for a number of months.",
        "Rebuttal evidence": "77 Dr Tan was recalled by the prosecution to rebut and comment on the\n\nevidence of Dr Kong without any objection from the defence. The substance of Dr Tan’s\n\nrebuttal evidence had been succinctly recapitulated by the learned DPP in her submission\n\nand the salient features therein were to the following effect.78 Dr Tan testified that having regard to the diagnostic guidelines in\n\nICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases) which he had applied in assessing the\n\naccused, he was of the opinion that the accused was not suffering from any depressive\n\nepisode preceding, or at the time of, the offence. According to the diagnostic guidelines\n\nin the ICD-10, for a definite diagnosis of a depressive episode, at least two of the\n\nfollowing symptoms must be presented:(i) depressed mood;(ii) loss of interest and enjoyment;(iii) increased fatiguability;plus at least two of the following symptoms:(i) reduced concentration and attention;(ii) reduced self-esteem and self confidence;(iii) ideas of guilt and unworthiness;(iv) bleak and pessimistic views of the future;(v) ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide;(vi) disturbed sleep;(vii) diminished appetite.79 Dr Tan asserted that the accused was not suffering from any\n\ndepressive episode preceding, or at the time the offence was committed. His reasons were\n\nas follows.(i) The accused was able to maintain an active sexual relationship with\n\n  Phensuwan. It was unlikely that the accused would be able to do that if he were indeed\n\n  depressed. At any rate, if the accused had been depressed before the killing, he would be\n\n  suffering from anhedonia ie. a condition where one lacks the ability to enjoy oneself.(ii) The evidence also showed that the accused listened to music,\n\n  socialised with his Thai friends at Golden Mile Complex on Sundays, gambled on payday\n\n  every month from the time he arrived in Singapore till the time of his arrest. A person\n\n  would have considerable difficulty in continuing with social work or domestic activities\n\n  if he were suffering from moderate to severe depressive episodes.(iii) There was evidence that the accused was working overtime on\n\n  sixteen occasions in the month of May, and on three days out of nine days in June 2000. If\n\n  the accused was indeed suffering from depressive episodes, it was unlikely that he would\n\n  be able to work overtime so frequently.(iv) Poh (the accused’s supervisor) had informed Dr Tan that the\n\n  accused worked like other Thai workers. In addition, the testimony of the other Thai\n\n  workers who were the accused’s colleagues was that they did not observe any behaviour\n\n  of the accused which suggested that he had a mental illness. This evidence supported the\n\n  view that the accused was able to work normally and was not depressed prior to or at the\n\n  time of the commission of the offence.(v) The accused had told Dr Tan that he did not work from 9 June 2000\n\n  onwards until the date of the offence because he was busy trying to secure employment for\n\n  his friend \"Wanchai Meeying\". If the accused had been severely depressed on 15\n\n  June 2000, he would have been in a poor state by 9 June 2000 and would not have the will\n\n  nor the capacity to actively job-search for a friend in the one week preceding the\n\n  offence.(vi) In addition, the accused was able to give a clear account of the\n\n  events of the evening before and after the offence was committed. He was able to give\n\n  clear and precise directions to the deceased as he (the accused) guided him from Golden\n\n  Mile Complex to Pasir Ris, and he was also able to give details of the events culminating\n\n  in the accused hitting the deceased on the head and thereafter running away from the scene\n\n  and disposing of some of the deceased’s belongings.80 Dr Tan expressed his view that the accused was not suffering from\n\nany depressive episode, applying either the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines or the DSM-IV\n\ndiagnostic guidelines. The DSM-IV diagnostic guidelines are similar to the ICD-10\n\nguidelines.81 Dr Tan, however, mentioned in his psychiatric report (P-121) that\n\nthe accused was suffering from a mild depressive episode post-offence, after his arrest,\n\nas classified under F32.0 ICD-10. Dr Tan had also tendered literature to show that the\n\naccused’s suicide attempts whilst in custody was not due to him being severely\n\ndepressed at the time of the offence but due to reactive depression based on his later\n\ncircumstances that he was facing a serious charge and had been deprived of his liberty.82 Dr Tan’s conclusion was that the accused was not suffering from\n\nany mental illness that had impaired his mental responsibility at the time of the offence.83 The prosecution also called with the leave of court another worker\n\nby the name of Noordin Bin Mohd Amin (PW-45) to rebut the averments of the accused in\n\nrelation to his mental condition during the last few months of his employment with Lean\n\nHin Lee. Noordin testified that in June 2000 he was a construction carpenter with Lian Hin\n\nLee. He was in their employment for about 10 years and had been working at the worksite at\n\nLorong Halus between April and June 2000. He said that he worked with the accused from\n\nabout May 2000 to June 2000. The accused was in his team and Noordin’s role in the\n\nteam was to direct the Thai workers in the work they should carry out. He spoke little\n\nThai and instructions were given by him to the Thai workers mostly by sign language.84 Noordin denied that the accused had told him that he did not want to\n\nwork any further and wanted to return home. The accused did not tell him at any stage that\n\nhe was ill or that his memory was so bad that he was unable to work. According to Noordin\n\nthe accused was able to follow instructions and was able to complete the job allocated to\n\nhim. He added that the work assigned by him to the accused was no easier than what was\n\nassigned to others in the team. He described the accused’s standard of work as\n\n\"OK\" but the accused was sometimes careless. When asked to clarify he said that\n\nthe accused at times had the tendency to walk around and smoke cigarettes.",
        "Conclusion": "85 The charge against the accused was an offence of murder punishable\n\nunder s 302 of the Penal Code. The Indian Supreme Court inVirsa Singh v State of\n\nPunjabAIR 1958 SC 465 (per Bose J) at 467 dealing with the third limb of s 300 of\n\nthe Indian Penal Code which is identical to the provisions of our Penal Code, enumerated\n\nthe requisite ingredients that ought to be established and proved to bring home the charge\n\nof murder against an accused, in the following terms:First, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is\n\n  present;Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely\n\n  objective investigations.Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that\n\n  particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or\n\n  that some other kind of injury was intended.…Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described\n\n  made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary\n\n  course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective and inferential and has\n\n  nothing to do with the intention of the offender.86 InMimi Wong & Anor v Public Prosecutor[1972] 2 MLJ 75at 78, the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal affirmed the principles enunciated by\n\nthe Indian Supreme Court inVirsa Singhas follows:… we are in full agreement with the Supreme Court of India inVirsa\n\n  Singhv.State of Punjabwhere the correct legal position as regards the third\n\n  limb of section 300 of the Indian Penal Code (which is in identical terms with our section\n\n  300) has been set out in the judgment of Bose J.87 InPublic Prosecutor v Visuvanathan[1978] 1 MLJ 159at 161, Choor Singh J further elucidated the application of the third limb to s 300 of the\n\nPenal Code in these terms:… all that the prosecution need prove is –1. that the accused did an act which caused the death of the deceased;2. that the said act was done with the intention of causing bodily\n\n    injury;3. that the injury caused –(a) was intended and was not accidental or otherwise unintentional; and(b) was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.There is no other requirement. …88 InTan Cheow Bock v Public Prosecutor[1991] 3 MLJ 404at 410, the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal again reaffirmed the principles articulated\n\ninVisuvanathan.89 Returning to the issues at hand, there was no dispute that the\n\nprosecution had conclusively proved that: (a) the accused was the one who had inflicted\n\nthe injuries found on the deceased; and (b) the injuries, particularly items 1 and 4 which\n\nwere found inflicted on the deceased’s head were, according to the forensic\n\npathologist Dr Teo, sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the\n\nvictim.90 The only aspect which was put in issue at the trial concerned the\n\nmental responsibility of the accused. In this, there were two strands in the arguments\n\nadvanced on his behalf by the defence counsel. First, it was submitted that the accused at\n\nthe time he inflicted those injuries was suffering from an abnormality of mind as had\n\nsubstantially impaired his mental responsibility so as to avail him of the defence of\n\ndiminished responsibility as provided under Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code.91 In this connection, reliance and references were made to the\n\naccused’s background, his behavioural pattern both in his home country as well as at\n\nhis work place in Singapore and most importantly the opinion of Dr Douglas Kong who\n\nmaintained that the accused’s mental responsibility was substantially impaired at the\n\ntime of the commission of the offence.92 The second strand of counsel’s argument was in a way hinged to\n\nthe former. Here, it was argued that inasmuch as the accused was suffering from a mental\n\nabnormality during the commission of the offence, the prosecution could not have been said\n\nto have proven its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.93 Before evaluating the medical evidence adduced in this case, it\n\nwould be instructive to call to mind some well-established principles in relation to the\n\naspect of mental abnormality and the defence of diminished responsibility.94 The concept of diminished responsibility was introduced into English\n\nlaw by s 2(1) of the Homicide Act 1957 which provides:… that a person shall not be guilty of murder if he was suffering\n\n  from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded\n\n  development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as\n\n  substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in doing or\n\n  being a party to the killing.\" As such, the defence of diminished responsibility\n\n  reduces the crime from murder to manslaughter.95 This particular defence based on s 2(1) of the English Act (supra)\n\nwas introduced almost in its entirety in Singapore in 1961. Exception 7 to s 300 of the\n\nPenal Code provides:\"Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender was suffering\n\n  from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded\n\n  development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as\n\n  substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the\n\n  death or being a party to causing the death.\"96 There have been a number of decisions dealing with this defence over\n\nthe years yet the most authoritative exposition of the law on this matter was by Lord\n\nParker CJ inR v Byrne(1960) 2 QB 396 at page 403, where he defined\n\n‘abnormality of mind’ as being:… a state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings\n\n  that the reasonable man would term it abnormal. It appears to us to be wide enough to\n\n  cover the mind’s activities in all its aspects, not only the perception of physical\n\n  acts and matters, and the ability to form a rational judgment whether an act is right or\n\n  wrong, but also the ability to exercise will power to control physical acts in accordance\n\n  with that rational judgment. …97 As to the requisite burden of proof in relation to exceptions to any\n\ncriminal statutes defining any offence, section 107 of the Evidence Act provides as\n\nfollows:When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the\n\n  existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the exceptions in the Penal\n\n  Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same\n\n  Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the court shall presume the\n\n  absence of circumstances.98 InJayasena v The Queen(1970) AC 618, the Privy\n\nCouncil observed that the foregoing section places a legal burden on the accused if he\n\nwants to rely on any exception to liability in the Penal Code or for that matter on any\n\nother exception or provisos in any law defining the offence.99 InN Govindasamy v Public Prosecutor(1976) 2 MLJ 49,\n\nthe Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal regarded the law as well settled byJayasenaand held that the accused had the burden to prove on a balance of probabilities, the\n\nexistence of circumstances entitling him to a defence.100 InWalton v R(1978) 1 All ER 542, an appeal where\n\nthe issue of diminished responsibility was considered, Lord Keith of Kinkel delivering the\n\nadvice of the Privy Council commented at page 546g-h:These cases make clear thaton an issue of diminished responsibility\n\n  the jury are entitled and indeed bound to consider not only the medical evidence but the\n\n  evidence on the whole facts and circumstances of the case.These include the nature of\n\n  the killing, the conduct of the accused before, at the time of and after it and any\n\n  history of mental abnormality.It being recognised that the jury on occasion may\n\n  properly refuse to accept medical evidence, it follows that they must be entitled sto\n\n  consider the quality and weight of that evidence.As was pointed out by Lord Parker CJ\n\n  inR. v. Byrne, what the jury are essentially seeking to ascertain is whether at\n\n  the time of the killing the accused was suffering from a state of mind bordering on but\n\n  not amounting to insanity. That task is to be approached in a broad common sense way.\n\n  …101 There is yet another principle which requires mention at this\n\njuncture. InR v Vinagre[1979] 69 Cr App R at 104, Lawton LJ said:… \"We are sure that it was never intended that pleas should\n\n  be accepted on flimsy grounds … It seems to us that pleas to manslaughter on grounds\n\n  of diminished responsibility should only be accepted where there is clear evidence of\n\n  mental imbalance.\"102 Reverting to the facts in this case, as stated earlier, several\n\nbackground matters concerning the accused were relied on by his counsel to advance the\n\ndefence of diminished responsibility.103 Now, first dealing with the mental state of the accused whilst he\n\nwas in Thailand, it was said that the accused was suffering from mental illness even when\n\nhe was in Thailand and was receiving treatment from one Dr Somsak almost everyday for\n\nabout six months before his arrival in Singapore. Curiously, no confirmatory evidence was\n\nforthcoming from the defence in this regard despite a long interval between hearings ie\n\nfrom 23 February 2001 and 23 July 2001. When asked, counsel for the accused could only say\n\nthat his instructions were not to pursue that matter. In my determination, an indifferent\n\nanswer such as the one given did not lend weight to the accused’s account of his\n\nantecedent mental condition.104 The next aspect was in relation to the accused’s mental state\n\nwhilst in Singapore. In this regard the accused’s claim was that during the months of\n\nMay to June 2000, he was unable to concentrate on his work; he had frequent headaches; his\n\nbrain was not functioning properly; he was suffering from extreme stress and as a result\n\nhis work hours diminished. But the evidence of his colleagues and the work records\n\nproduced in told narrated a different story. It appeared from his work records that in the\n\nmonths of May and June he was working as usual. His records established that he had\n\nclocked three days overtime in June. However, it should be noted that he stopped work on 9\n\nJune 2000. His fellow workers at the worksite also testified that they did not notice that\n\nthere was anything wrong with the accused either in relation to his work or in relation to\n\nhis general disposition. The accused’s claim that he suffered from lack of\n\nconcentration also did not tie up with his gambling success when the accused asserted that\n\nhe was in fact netting about $4,000 to $5,000 a month from gambling alone and that he had\n\nlost only once on 9 June 2000. This story coupled with his unwitting averment that he was\n\nall the time the banker in gambling sessions, did not seem to support the defence\n\ncontention that the accused was suffering from deficit of concentration and stress.105 Returning to Dr Kong’s evidence, with respect, I must say that\n\nit contained some major inconsistencies. First of all Dr Kong who had earlier reported\n\nthat the accused had been suffering from a major depression \"since the beginning\n\nof 2000\" modified it during cross-examination to read that the accused had been\n\nsuffering from a major depression \"which had its beginnings from January/February\n\n2000.\" Secondly, in his written report he did not mention that the accused was\n\nsuffering from \"dissociative amnesia\", a clinical term which is quite distinct\n\nfrom the \"dissociative state\" he had mentioned in the report. Another notable\n\ninconsistency was in relation to the clinical term: Paranoid Reaction. Dr Kong said that\n\nalthough he had used the term ‘Paranoid Reaction’ in his report, what he really\n\nmeant was ‘Brief Psychotic Disorder’106 Dr Kong’s evidence in court was that the accused had all the\n\nsymptoms (1 to 9) of Major Depressive Episode (DSM IV) based on (a) his examination of the\n\naccused; (b) the testimony of the accused and (c) the evidence of other witnesses in\n\ncourt. Dr Kong’s amended opinion was that the accused was suffering from a major\n\ndepression which had the beginnings from January to February 2000. However from the\n\nevidence proffered by witnesses, such an opinion was not founded on any credible evidence.\n\nNone of the witnesses had come across the accused being in a depressed mood nearly every\n\nday (symptom 1 of Major Depressive Episode in DSM-IV) nor did he appear to have suffered\n\nfrom a markedly diminished interest in all or almost all activities nearly every day\n\n(symptom 2). On the contrary, the evidence of his girlfriend, the accused’s\n\ncolleagues and friends was that the accused was behaving no differently from the others.\n\nThere was also no credible evidence to support the defendants’ assertion that the\n\naccused had a decrease or increase in his appetite nearly everyday (symptom 3), nor was\n\nthere any evidence to suggest that he was suffering from any psychomotor retardation\n\n(symptom 5). In fact, the facts pointed to the contrary since all his colleagues testified\n\nthat they had not noticed anything abnormal about the accused and that there was nothing\n\nto suggest that his reflexes were slow. The prosecution expert Dr Tan, after citing\n\nclinical literature said that where a person was suffering from psychomotor retardation,\n\nhe would take up to a few minutes to answer even the simplest questions. Dr Tan opined\n\nthat the fact the accused had injured Samran’s dog, did not in itself mean that the\n\naccused was suffering from psychomotor agitation as it was probable that the accused could\n\nhave been intoxicated at that time.107 Further, the accused did not appear to have suffered from any\n\nfatigue or loss of energy (symptom 6). On the contrary, his supervisors and Noordin bin\n\nMohd Amin had testified that the accused worked like other workers and was able to carry\n\nout his work properly and was not found to be lethargic.108 There was also no evidence from the accused’s girlfriend or\n\nfrom his other friends (Montree and Tossapol) or from his fellow workers that the accused\n\nhad manifested any indication or clue as to his alleged recurrent thoughts of death.\n\nFurther, according to Dr Tan, the suicide attempts whilst the accused was in custody was\n\ndue to his frustration and fear after his arrest and hence, the accused did not satisfy\n\nsymptom 9.109 The evidence adduced by the prosecution further seemed to suggest\n\nthat the accused was not in a depressed state and was able to go about his daily routine\n\nno different from others and maintain social ties normally. It should also be noted that\n\nthe girlfriend of the accused did not observe the accused to be in a low or depressed mood\n\nmost of the day nearly everyday. He was able to enjoy her company whenever they were\n\ntogether.110 Dr Tan had stressed the importance of taking objective facts into\n\nconsideration in assessing whether a person was suffering from any depressive episodes.\n\nThis aspect appeared to be missing in the analysis of Dr Kong who seemed to have relied\n\nmainly on the subjective account given by the accused. In addition, Dr Tan also stated\n\nthat for the accused to qualify as suffering from Major Depression, he had to satisfy five\n\nor more of the criteria stated in DSM-IV within the same two-week period.111 In Dr Tan’s expert opinion the accused only qualified for\n\nsymptom 4 which was insomnia. Dr Tan stated that other than the subjective account of\n\ninsomnia given by the accused, he did not satisfy any other criteria as set out in the\n\nDSM-IV for Major Depressive Episode and other than the accused’s claim that he had\n\nother symptoms, Dr Tan was unable to find any independent evidence to support the\n\naccused’s claims.112 Another important feature in the evidence of the accused was that\n\nhe did not work from 9 June 2000 onwards until the date of the offence because he was busy\n\ntrying to secure employment for his friend Wanchai. Dr Tan pointed out that if the\n\naccused’s mental illness had come to a head on 15 June 2000, as was suggested by Dr\n\nKong, the accused would be in a poor state by 9 June 2000 and would not have the will nor\n\nthe capacity to actively job-search for a friend in the one week preceding the offence.113 Dr Kong’s view was that the accused was suffering from\n\ndissociative amnesia. He had apparently formed this opinion only after he had listened to\n\nthe accused’s evidence in court. This was never reflected in his psychiatric report.\n\nAt any rate, Dr Kong did not satisfy the diagnostic criteria provided in DSM-IV-300.12.114 Dr Kong claimed that although he had opined in his psychiatric\n\nreport that the accused was suffering from a Paranoid Reaction (categorised as F23.3 in\n\nthe ICD-10), he actually meant \"Brief Psychotic Disorder\" as defined in Kaplan\n\nand Saddock’s Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry. Dr Kong tried to explain that he\n\nhad diagnosed the accused \"functionally\" and not \"clinically\" by\n\nterming the accused’s state of mind as a Paranoid Reaction in his report when\n\nactually the phenomenon was a ‘Brief Psychotic Disorder’.115 Table 13. 1-4 of Kaplan and Saddock’s Comprehensive Textbook\n\nof Psychiatry sets out that for there to be a diagnosis of Brief Psychotic Episode,\n\nfollowing the conditions must be satisfied:A. Presence of one (or more) of the following symptoms:(1) delusions(2) hallucinations(3) disorganised speech (e.g. frequent derailment or incoherence)(4) grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviourNote:Do not include a symptom if it is a culturally sanctioned\n\n  response pattern,B. Duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day but less\n\n  than 1 month, with eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning.C. The disturbance is not better accounted for by a mood disorder with\n\n  psychotic features, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophrenia and is not due to the\n\n  direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a\n\n  general medical condition.116 Dr Kong opined that the accused satisfied Condition A of Table 13.\n\n1-4 as he was suffering from the ‘delusion’ that the deceased was going to call\n\nthe police and that he was suffering from ‘grossly disorganised behaviour’ at\n\nthe time of the offence. Dr Kong equated \"delusion\" in his report with the\n\nsentence in his report that reads: \"… [He] also appeared to harbour beliefs that\n\nif the police were to find him with a blood-stained shirt, he would be in trouble with the\n\nlaw again and since the Depression had impaired his judgement and reasoning process, it\n\nwas natural that these beliefs became transformed into paranoid fears and thoughts\n\n…\". Dr Kong has also equated \"grossly disorganised behaviour\" in his\n\nreport with \"confusional state.\" Once again Dr Kong’s views seemed to be\n\ndogged by the ills of omission. In my view, it was strange that Dr Kong did not mention\n\ndelusions and grossly disorganised behaviour in his report if that was his analysis. Dr\n\nKong tried to explain this by saying that he did not wish to place the accused \"in\n\nbaskets\".117 Dr Tan’s rebuttal evidence on this was that the accused’s\n\nimpression that the deceased was going to call the police was a mistaken belief and was\n\nnot a delusion. Dr Tan explained that a delusion was a false belief that he had no basis.\n\nHowever, the accused in this case had a basis for thinking that the deceased was going to\n\ncall the police ie, the fact that he was involved in a fight earlier and was wearing a\n\nblood-stained jacket. His belief was therefore not a delusion.118 Dr Tan further testified that there was no evidence that the\n\naccused was suffering from delusions or grossly disorganised behaviour since the accused\n\nhad exhibited purposive behaviour and knew what he was doing.119 Dr Kong’s evidence was that although the Brief Psychotic\n\nDisorder had only lasted 20 to 25 minutes, the accused qualified under Condition B of\n\nTable 13.1-4.120 In rebuttal Dr Tan said that it was unlikely for a Brief Psychotic\n\nDisorder to set in during such a short span of time. Dr Tan’s evidence on this was\n\nthat 20 to 25 minutes was a far cry from the requirement of ‘1 day’ in Kaplan\n\nand Saddock. Dr Tan’s criticism was that even though laxity can be given to the time\n\nframe, it should not be applied as generously as Dr Kong had done. Dr Tan’s opinion\n\nwas that if the disorder had persisted for example 18 hours then the patient may still\n\nqualify under Condition B (seeKaplan and Saddock, Table 13 1-4).121 Reviewing the totality of the evidence, in my determination, the\n\ndefence of diminished responsibility had not been made out on balance of probabilities. In\n\nthis regard, I found the accused had not been truthful in his assertions. His claim in the\n\nwitness box that he removed the metal object from his waist and hit the driver at the back\n\nof his head about two to three times in his statement of 15 June 2000 was not something\n\nreconstructed as claimed by Dr Kong. In my opinion, he appeared to be fully conscious and\n\nwas in possession of all his mental faculties throughout the entire taxi journey to the\n\nextent that he could give the driver very clear instructions as to the path as well as the\n\nturnings to be taken throughout the entire journey. In my determination, the injuries\n\ninflicted on the accused were not something done in a moment of daze and dissociative\n\nstate but in a moment of full clarity and consciousness. Dr Kong’s evidence in my\n\nview suffered from lack of consistency and appeared to be replete with\n\nover-generalisation. In my opinion, Dr Tan’s analysis appeared to possess both\n\nobjectivity and consistency. In the event, I accepted the evidence of Dr Tan that the\n\naccused was not suffering from any abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his\n\nmental responsibility at the time of the commission of the offence although he suffered a\n\npost-arrest depressive episode.122 In my determination, the prosecution had discharged its ultimate\n\nburden in proving the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and that the\n\ndefence of diminished responsibility as well as the defence based on lack of requisite\n\nintention raised on behalf of the accused were plainly unsustainable. There was no\n\nevidence that the accused was suffering from any abnormality of mind prior to or at the\n\ntime of the commission of the offence. In my view, the offence committed was willed and\n\ncarried out in a cold-blooded manner. In the end, I was satisfied that the prosecution had\n\nindeed proven its case against him beyond a reasonable doubt and that he had not, on a\n\nbalance of probabilities established his defence. Consequently, I found him guilty of the\n\ncharge on which he was tried, convicted him and sentenced him to death.Sgd:MPH RUBINJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
