        "Azman’s statements": "7.\n\n        The first officer to question Azman was\n\nInspector Herman bin Mohamed Hamli. Insp Herman recorded the exchange2-Insp Herman : The stuff inside the Umbro\n\n  bag [the travelling bag recovered from the taxi] belongs to who?Azman : I do not know. Sam asked me to go\n\n  to Kranji and he told me later someone will give.Insp Herman : Who is Sam?Azman : Sam is my friend. I do not know\n\n  his number.Insp Herman : What is the stuff inside?Azman : I do not know.8.\n\n        Azman was brought into the apartment, and he,\n\nRuzaini and Isnin were questioned on the drugs found there. He said that he did not know\n\nwho the drugs belonged to.39. Later on Insp Herman questioned Azman\n\nfurther4-Insp Herman : The stuff inside the house\n\n  belongs to who?Azman : I do not know.Insp Herman : How did the keys to this\n\n  house is inside your bag?Azman : This morning, Sam called my\n\n  handphone. He asked me to come to this house. He hid the keys inside the plants in front\n\n  of the house. I took the keys and went inside. I smoked heroin. Later, a man from Malaysia\n\n  called my handphone. He asked me to go to Kranji to receive stuff.Insp Herman : After you took the bag what\n\n  happened?Azman : I waited. Sam called me asking me\n\n  to come here. I took a taxi to come here but I was arrested.10.\n\n        On 22 August 2001 Azman made a cautioned\n\nstatement to a charge of trafficking the drugs recovered from the taxi, in which he said5I do not admit to the charge. I was not\n\n  aware that the thing I was carrying contain drugs. I received instructions from a friend\n\n  to carry the bag. I was then told to send the bag to a Condominium in Upper Changi Road.\n\n  Another person would then received the bag.He also made another cautioned statement\n\nin response to a charge of trafficking the drugs in the apartment. In this cautioned\n\nstatement6he denied the charge.11.\n\n        Two investigations statements were recorded\n\nfrom him on 27 and 29 August.7In the first statement, he stated that on the\n\nday of the arrest he received a call from a friend he knows as Brother, who is a male\n\nMalaysian Malay. Brother told him that there would be work for him later, and instructed\n\nhim to go to Cascadale condominium to collect the keys to unit #02-02 from the letter box.\n\nHe was to go to the kitchen of the apartment, collect a black bag holding more than\n\n$40,000 and go to Kranji MRT station where he was to meet a person and exchange the money\n\nfor a bag. He went to the apartment as instructed. He found the bag of money, took a drink\n\nand left the apartment with the bag. He took a taxi to Kranji MRT station. On the way\n\nthere he received a call from Brother that he was not to give the money to the person at\n\nthe station. At the station, he met with a male Chinese who arrived in a van. That person\n\nplaced the bag in front of him and left. He took the bag and boarded another taxi to go\n\nback to Upper Changi Road. While he was in the taxi Brother called again and told him that\n\nsomeone would collect the money and the bag from him at the lobby of Cascadale\n\ncondominium. In the event he was arrested before reaching his destination.12.\n\n        In the second statement, Azman said that he had\n\nworked for Brother on a previous occasion. On that occasion Brother offered him a job\n\ncollecting VCDs. He went to Kranji MRT station and collected two bags from a man and he\n\ndelivered to Brother at Beach Road and was paid $2000. Three days prior to his arrest,\n\nBrother asked if he could do a similar job for him, and he agreed.",
        "Ruzaini’s statements": "13.\n\n        Ruzaini made his first statement8to\n\nStation Inspector Ronnie See Su Khoon. He told S.I. See that he was waiting for his friend\n\nAzman as they had arranged to meet at the garden of Cascadale condominium and go to\n\nOrchard Road. He had not gone into the apartment and the drugs in the apartment did not\n\nbelong to him, and he did not know anything about them.9He repeated to Insp.\n\nHerman that he did not know who the drugs belonged to10when the inspector\n\nquestioned him.14.\n\n        On 22 August, in answer to a joint charge with\n\nhis two co-accused for trafficking the drugs recovered in the apartment, he made a\n\ncautioned statement thatI was arrested at the car park and not in\n\n  the house. I was not in possession of any drugs when I was arrested. I do not know\n\n  anything about the drugs found in the house.11",
        "Isnin’s statements": "15.\n\n        When Isnin was questioned by Insp. Herman on\n\nthe day of arrest he stated that he did not know who the drugs in the apartment belonged\n\nto.12On 18 August he gave a cautioned statement13thatI received instructions from my friend to\n\n  pack drugs but he was not the one who was arrested together with me. I do not know\n\n  anything about the 43 packets of heroin. I only found out about it when CNB found the\n\n  heroin. That’s all.16.\n\n        Subsequently a series of investigation\n\nstatements were recorded from him. In a statement recorded on 23 August,14Isnin said that in the morning of the day of arrest he received a telephone call from\n\nRuzaini. Ruzaini said he needed his help, which he understood to be to pack drugs. That\n\nafternoon Azman also called him. Azman asked if he was going to \"the place\" and\n\nsaid Ruzaini would be there, but he did not name the place. Isnin decided to check with a\n\nfriend he called Brother who had instructed him to send food and provisions to the\n\napartment as well as to pack drugs there on earlier occasions. When he telephoned Brother,\n\nhe was told to buy some drinks to the apartment and to pack drugs. (In a subsequent\n\nstatement he added that Brother did not inform him of the amount of the drugs or their\n\nwhereabouts.15) He carried out Brother’s instructions. He bought some\n\ndrinks and went to Cascadale condominium. He took the keys to the apartment from the\n\nletter box and entered the apartment at about 2.45 pm. There was no one there. He went to\n\nthe master bedroom and saw some heroin on the floor and a bowl of heroin. He settled down\n\nand started to pack the heroin. About half an hour later, he heard some noise outside the\n\napartment’s main door and saw some men outside. He placed a chair against the door to\n\nprevent it from being opened, and tried to dispose of the sachets of heroin into the\n\ntoilet bowl. His efforts were futile because the officers entered the apartment, and\n\narrested him. He only knew about the drugs in the master bedroom, and did not know of the\n\nother drugs recovered in the apartment. The drugs did not belong to him, and he did not\n\nknow if they belonged to Azman or Ruzaini.17.\n\n        In a statement made on 27 August16Isnin explained that he had been to the apartment on other occasions prior to his arrest.\n\nOn the first occasion, about two weeks earlier, he brought provisions and a mini-compo\n\nsound system there on Brother’s instructions. When he arrived at the apartment\n\nRuzaini and his girlfriend (whose name is Rohaizan or Rose) were at the apartment. He\n\ndeposited the things he brought, and left without packing any drugs. Two or three days\n\nlater he went to the apartment again on the instructions of Brother who had told him to\n\npack drugs. On this occasion he gained entry with keys taken from the letter box. There\n\nwas no one else there. He packed 50 sachets of heroin in the master bedroom and left. On\n\n16 August, the day before his arrest, Brother instructed him to pack drugs in the\n\napartment again. On this occasion, Ruzaini let him in. Azman was also there, and the three\n\nof them packed drugs together.18.\n\n        In a further statement dated 29 August,17he stated that he had gone to the apartment three times to pack drugs. When he was there\n\nalone in the apartment to pack drugs on the first occasion he checked some areas of the\n\napartment, in the course of which he touched the ceiling of the kitchen, the kitchen\n\ntoilet and the master bedroom toilet for drugs, but he did not find any drugs.1819.\n\n        In his next investigation statement of 5\n\nSeptember,19Isnin described Brother as an Indian Muslim and his mobile phone\n\nnumber is 90223824. When he was shown the photograph of Ismadi bin Kasban (the subscriber\n\nof telephone 90223824), he responded that he did not know that person or his name.20",
        "Other evidence": "20.\n\n        There was other evidence adduced by the\n\nprosecution which formed part of the whole case.21.Fingerprints.Fingerprints were found on\n\nthe false ceiling boards of the master bedroom toilet and the kitchen toilet false ceiling\n\nwhere the 23 and 20 packets of heroin were concealed. When the prints were examined the\n\nfingerprint on the false ceiling board of the master bedroom toilet was ascertained to be\n\nIsnin’s, and that on the false ceiling board of the kitchen toilet was Azman’s.22.Rohaizan binte Buang’s evidence.She\n\nis the girlfriend of Ruzaini and is also known as Rose. In her statement admitted in\n\nevidence,21she stated that in late July 2001 Ruzaini had asked her to rent an\n\napartment for him to stay with his friends. She saw an advertisement of the apartment, and\n\non 24 July22they went to view it. She took up the tenancy and paid the deposit\n\nand rental with money provided by Ruzaini. When she received the apartment keys she handed\n\nthem to Ruzaini. A few days later she went to the apartment. Ruzaini who was there alone\n\ntold her that his friend was staying in the master bedroom. When she visited him next,\n\nAzman was in the living room, and Ruzaini informed her that Azman was staying there.23.\n\n        Azman’s counsel did not dispute her\n\nassertion that Azman was at the apartment with Ruzaini. Ruzaini’s counsel did not\n\ndispute her evidence that Ruzaini had told her that he wanted to rent the apartment for\n\nhim and his friends to stay in or put to her that Ruzaini told her that he was renting the\n\napartment on behalf of a friend.24.Identity of Brother.The investigation\n\nofficer ascertained that the telephone number 90223824 which Azman and Isnin stated to be\n\nBrother’s telephone number was subscribed by someone by the name of Ismadi bin\n\nKasban. He obtained this person’s photograph from the national registration\n\nauthorities and showed it to all three accused persons. Each of them said that it was not\n\nthe photograph of Brother.23Brother was described differently by each of them.\n\nAzman described the Brother he knew as a Malaysian Malay, whereas the Brother Isnin dealt\n\nwith is an Indian Muslim, and according to Ruzaini, Brother is a Malaysian Chinese Muslim.25.\n\n        The investigation officer did not contact\n\nIsmadi bin Kasban or arrange for his statement to be taken. He felt that this was not\n\nnecessary because he was not identified by the three accused and because their\n\ndescriptions of Brother differed. He could have done more. Ismadi bin Kasban could have\n\nshed light on the shadowy Brother. He could confirm if he was known as Brother, and if he\n\nknew any of the accused. If he was in possession of the mobile phone, he could explain the\n\ncalls with the accused. If he was not in possession of the phone, he may identify the\n\nperson who did. The investigation officer was right in concluding that the three\n\naccuseds’ descriptions of Brother and their failure to identify Ismadi bin\n\nKasban’s photograph were unsatisfactory. That was cause for further investigations.26.\n\n        There was evidence adduced on the newspaper\n\nused to wrap the packets of drugs, the call tracing records of the accuseds’\n\ntelephones. However this evidence did not really add to the case for the prosecution or\n\nthe defence.",
        "Close of the prosecution case": "27.\n\n        The evidence against Azman was that he was at\n\nthe apartment before going to Kranji MRT station. He had the keys to the apartment, and by\n\ns.18(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act he was presumed to be in possession of the drugs in the\n\napartment. His fingerprint was on the ceiling board of the kitchen toilet. There was also\n\nIsnin’s statement that he was packing drugs at the apartment on the day before (16\n\nAugust).28.\n\n        For Ruzaini, the evidence was that he rented\n\nthe apartment through Rohaizan, and had received the apartment keys. There was\n\nIsnin’s statement that he was in the apartment after the keys were delivered to him,\n\nand that he was there on 16 August packing drugs. Isnin had also stated that Ruzaini\n\ntelephoned him on 17 August and asked for help, which he understood to mean help to pack\n\ndrugs. Azman had stated that he was going to Cascadale condominium to deliver the bag he\n\ncollected from Kranji MRT station to someone waiting for him there and Ruzaini had stated\n\nin his statement that he was waiting for Azman when he was arrested.29.\n\n        Lastly, for Isnin, he had the keys to the\n\napartment, his fingerprint was on the false ceiling board on the master bedroom toilet\n\nwhere 23 packets of heroin were concealed, and he admitted to packing drugs in the\n\napartment before and on the day of his arrest.30.\n\n        I found that a reasonable inference can be\n\ndrawn that the three of them were in possession of the drugs in the apartment for the\n\npurpose of trafficking. That was sufficient to establish aprima faciecase for the\n\naccused to be called on to enter their defences – seeTan Chuan Ten v PP[1997] 2 SLR 348at para 25.",
        "Azman’s defence": "31.\n\n        On 17 August he received a call from his friend\n\nBrother who is a Malaysian Malay.24Brother wanted him to collect VCDs for him\n\nfrom Kranji. Brother’s instructions were that he was to go to Cascadale condominium\n\nfirst to collect the money for the VCDs from apartment #02-02. He did not know where\n\nCascadale condominium and the apartment were and Brother gave him the directions.25He went to Cascadale condominium, collected the keys to the apartment from the letter box\n\nand gained access to the apartment. He went to a bedroom and took the money which was\n\nabout $40,000. After taking the money, he went to the kitchen and had a drink and then to\n\nthe kitchen toilet to urinate. While he was there he noticed the false ceiling opening was\n\nslightly open, and he raised himself on the toilet bowl and closed it. He went to the\n\nliving room, smoked some heroin, then left the apartment for Kranji MRT station by taxi.\n\nOn the way there Brother called. Brother instructed him not to pay the money to the person\n\ndelivering the VCDs. He was to return to Cascadale condominium after collecting the VCDs\n\nand someone will be waiting for him, and he was to hand the money, keys and bag of VCDs to\n\nthis person. He went to Kranji MRT station, received a bag from a man there and proceeded\n\nto bring it back to Cascadale condominium. He presumed the contents to be VCDs because in\n\na similar transaction two weeks earlier, they were VCDs.26His trip was\n\ndisrupted by the CNB officers who arrested him. He added by way of clarification that when\n\nhe told Insp. Herman about Sam, he was referring to Brother as he knew him by both names.2732.\n\n        Azman admitted that he knew Ruzaini and Isnin\n\nand was in regular contact with them over the telephone when they would talk about\n\nfootball.33.\n\n        Under cross-examination Azman said that he had\n\nnot been to the apartment prior to the date of arrest. He confirmed that Brother had given\n\nhim his telephone numbers, 9022382428and 97865007.29He denied\n\nIsnin’s counsel’s assertion that he and Ruzaini were there on 16 August packing\n\ndrugs.34.\n\n        The prosecutor asked him why he had stated in\n\nhis statement of 29 August30that he did not have the contact number of\n\nBrother. His explanation was that he could not remember the number as he had entered them\n\ninto his mobile phone.31He claimed that he had told several CNB officers\n\nincluding Insp. Herman, that Brother’s contact number was in the mobile phone.32(This was not put to any of the officers, none of whom had mentioned this in his\n\nevidence.)35.\n\n        On further cross-examination by the prosecutor,\n\nAzman admitted that he stated in his investigation statement dated 12 September that\n\nBrother had instructed him on 17 August that after collecting the bag, he was to telephone\n\nsomeone called Boy and to deliver the bag to him.33Azman also admitted that\n\nBoy was Ruzaini.34When asked why he did not say that in court, Azman explained\n\nthat he had made that up because he suspected Ruzaini as they had intended to go out\n\ntogether that day, and he was confused after his arrest.3536.\n\n        Azman also agreed with the prosecution that\n\nwhen he was arrested, he knew that the officers were CNB officers.36He was\n\nasked why he told them he did not know what was in the bag, when he thought he was\n\ncollecting VCDs, his answer was he was in shock.3737.\n\n        Lastly, Azman admitted when he was asked about\n\nthe fingerprint on the false ceiling of the kitchen toilet, he denied that he touched it.38His explanation for this was that he was in shock when he said that on 30 August.3938.\n\n        The prosecutor confronted him with another part\n\nof that statement40where he said he did not call Isnin on 17 August between\n\n1-2 pm, contrary to his evidence in court that he had called Isnin.41His\n\nexplanation was that he lied because he did not know if Isnin was involved with the drugs\n\nand did not want to commit himself either way.42",
        "Ruzaini’s defence": "39.\n\n        Ruzaini explained his involvement with the\n\napartment. The apartment was rented for a Malaysian Chinese Muslim friend Brother, who\n\nwanted his help to rent an apartment. He in turn told Rohaizan that Brother needed his\n\nhelp to rent an apartment.43(This did not come out in Rohaizan’s\n\nevidence, and was not put to her by Ruzaini’s counsel.) When the apartment was\n\nsecured, Rohaizan handed the apartment keys to him44and he delivered them to\n\nBrother’s girlfriend about a week later. During that week only Rohaizan had visited\n\nhim at the apartment.4540.\n\n        On 17 August he received a call that his\n\nadopted mother was warded at the National University Hospital (\"NUH\"). He took a\n\nshower and went directly to the hospital and reached there sometime after 11 am.4641.\n\n        At 9.45 am he telephoned Isnin and told him\n\nthat he needed his help.47He received a call from Azman at 2.49 pm.48They agreed to go to Orchard Road together, and arranged to meet at Cascadale condominium\n\nfirst. Sometime after 3 pm, he took a taxi from Tampines Mall to Cascadale condominium.\n\nAzman was not there and did not answer his calls. About 5 minutes later the CNB officers\n\ncame and arrested him. They took him to the apartment. He did not have the keys to the\n\napartment on him and had no knowledge of or anything to do with the drugs found in the\n\napartment.42.\n\n        In answer to his counsel’s question,\n\nRuzaini said that he had called Isnin on the telephone that morning and asked Isnin for\n\nhis help with transport. (It was not put to Isnin that he was asked to help with\n\ntransport). He needed Isnin’s help to bring a few items of clothings to his adopted\n\nmother. He denied that he was at the apartment with Isnin and Azman on 16 August. He\n\nclaimed that Isnin made those allegations against him because Isnin suspected that he was\n\na CNB informer.43.\n\n        In cross-examination by Azman’s counsel,\n\nRuzaini confirmed that he did not meet Azman on 16 August, that Azman had never visited\n\nhim at the apartment, and that he did not tell Rohaizan that Azman stayed at the\n\napartment.44.\n\n        In response to questions by counsel for Isnin,\n\nRuzaini said that Isnin had told him that he thought Ruzaini was a CNB informer while they\n\nwere at the Subordinate Courts lockup. (This was denied by Isnin.)45.\n\n        The prosecutor referred him to his\n\ninvestigation statements where he said that he did not know Azman and Isnin. He agreed\n\nthis was untrue.49The prosecutor also asked him to explain why Rohaizan did\n\nnot say that he told her that the apartment was rented for Brother, and why it was not put\n\nto her in cross-examination. His response was \"I have nothing to say.\"5046.\n\n        The prosecutor also referred him to other parts\n\nof his statements. In a statement dated 4 September51he said that Azman was\n\nnot the person who arranged to meet him at Cascadale condominium to go to Orchard Road\n\ntogether. This was in direct contradiction with his evidence in court that they had\n\narranged to meet. Ruzaini’s explanation was that his evidence was correct and he made\n\nthe untrue statement because he was in shock and was confused,52more than two\n\nweeks after he was arrested.47.\n\n        He had also said in the statement that he had\n\nknown Azman for about 2 weeks whereas his evidence was that they first met much earlier,\n\nin a drug rehabilitation centre, and then renewed their acquaintance in May/June 2001.\n\nAgain, he explained that the statement was wrong and was made while he was in shock and\n\nconfused.5348.\n\n        In the same statement54he stated\n\nthat he had not seen Isnin before although his evidence in court was that they had known\n\none another since 2000. Initially Ruzaini offered the same explanation – that the\n\nstatement was wrong because he was in shock and was confused when he made it, then he\n\nadmitted that he did not want to be involved with Isnin.5549.\n\n        In a later statement of 10 September,56he stated that he did not know someone called Man. In court he admitted that Man was\n\nAzman. In another part of the statement57he denied that he was known as Kecik\n\nwhen in fact Isnin called him by that name58and he said that he had not heard\n\nof Nin, when he knew Isnin by that name. The same reason were given for these\n\ndiscrepancies, that he was in a state of shock.59In re-examination, he said\n\nthat \"At that time I was in a state of shock. That’s why I lied.\"60",
        "Isnin’s defence": "50.\n\n        He knew Azman and Ruzaini before their arrest.\n\nHe knew Brother, an Indian Muslim because they were from the same kampong. One month\n\nbefore their arrest, they renewed their friendship. He agreed to help Brother by\n\ndelivering drinks, biscuits and other edibles to the apartment. Subsequently Brother\n\ntelephoned him, and gave him the address and told him that there was someone at the\n\napartment. He did as was instructed and took the items to the apartment. Ruzaini and\n\nRohaizan were there. He left the items at the apartment and left. Two or three days later,\n\nBrother instructed him to take more food and a mini-compo sound system to the apartment.\n\nHe went to the apartment with those items, and again he met Ruzaini and Rohaizan at the\n\napartment.51.\n\n        He went to the apartment on a third occasion in\n\nthe beginning of August, for a different purpose. On this occasion, Brother asked for his\n\nhelp to pack \"a few packets\" of drugs.61He did not elaborate on the\n\nnumber or size of packets. Brother told him to collect the keys to the apartment from the\n\nletter box and to get to pack the drugs in the master bedroom.52.\n\n        He went to the apartment and he checked through\n\nthe apartment. He gave two reasons for doing that. The first was that when he saw the\n\ndrugs in the master bedroom, and became frightened because he had not seen such a large\n\nquantity of drugs before. This lead him to check the whole apartment to ascertain if there\n\nwere more drugs.62The second reason was that Brother had asked him to check\n\nthe apartment for breakage and damage.63(It was not made clear why Brother\n\nwanted him to check for breakage and damage on this visit and not the earlier visits.) So\n\nhe went through the apartment, including the false ceiling of the kitchen toilet, where he\n\nremoved the ceiling board to look at the concealed pipes, then he went to the master\n\nbedroom and saw the drugs.6453.\n\n        There was an inconsistency in the two accounts\n\ni.e., whether the search was done before or after he saw the drugs in the master bedroom.\n\nIn cross-examination he went on to say that he checked the kitchen and kitchen toilet\n\ntwice, before and after he saw the drugs.65In any event he did not find any\n\nmore drugs. But he was sufficiently concerned by what he saw that he called Brother, who\n\ntold him to continue packing. He packed the drugs into more than 50 sachets66and left.54.\n\n        His next visit was on 16 August. Brother called\n\nhim to go to the apartment and pack drugs again. On this occasion Ruzaini and Azman were\n\nthere before him, and they packed drugs into 80-150 sachets.6755.\n\n        On 17 August (the day of arrest) Ruzaini called\n\nhim at about 9.45 am. Ruzaini told him that his mother was at NUH, and that he needed his\n\nhelp. He understood that to mean that Ruzaini wanted his help to pack drugs. It was not\n\nput to him that Ruzaini told him he needed help with transport.68In the\n\nafternoon Azman also called to tell him that he and Ruzaini would be going to \"that\n\nplace\" and asked if he was going. Azman called him again later in the day and told\n\nhim that Brother wanted him to go to \"that place\". He called Brother and was\n\ntold to bring drinks and titbits to the apartment, get the keys from the letter box to\n\ngain entry and pack drugs.6956.\n\n        He did as he was told. While he was packing\n\ndrugs, the CNB officers raided the apartment. He tried to flush the drugs down the toilet\n\nbowl, but was arrested before he completed that. He did not suspect that Ruzaini was a CNB\n\ninformer70and had not accused him of being that,71and had told the\n\ntruth in his investigation statements.",
        "Evaluation of the evidence": "57.\n\n        When Azman was arrested, he had the keys to the\n\napartment on him. He had collected the bag containing 30 packets of heroin, and was going\n\nto deliver it to someone at Cascadale condominium. Inside the apartment his fingerprint\n\nwas found on the kitchen ceiling where 20 packets of heroin were hidden. There was\n\nIsnin’s evidence that he was at the apartment on 16 August packing drugs, and that he\n\ngave instructions to Isnin which the latter understood were for him to go and pack drugs\n\nthere on 17 August.58.\n\n        He claimed that he did not know anything about\n\nthe drugs he collected, or those found in the house. However his conduct after his arrest\n\nand his account of the events raised serious questions over his credibility. He admitted\n\nthat he told many falsehoods in his investigation statements in the weeks after his arrest\n\nbecause he was in shock and that he lied to distance himself from Ruzaini and Isnin.59.\n\n        His evidence was that he believed the bag he\n\ncollected contained VCDs, but when he was questioned, he did not say that they were VCDs,\n\nbut claimed ignorance instead.60.\n\n        When he was questioned about the apartment, he\n\nsaid that Sam had asked him to collect them, and that he had taken the apartment keys from\n\ninside the plants in front of the house.72There were no plants hiding the keys\n\nand that was changed to the letter box. In his defence, the instructions came from\n\nBrother, who is the same person he had earlier referred to only as Sam.61.\n\n        I did not accept his explanation for his\n\nfingerprint on the kitchen toilet false ceiling. During the investigations, he\n\nspecifically denied touching it.73I did not accept his explanation that he put\n\nhis hand on the ceiling board to put it in its proper position. He was at the apartment to\n\ncollect the money to pay for the bag he was to collect at Kranji, not to do housekeeping.\n\nIf he had adjusted the ceiling board out of a sense of orderliness, there was no reason\n\nwhy he should not mention it when he was asked about it during the investigation.62.\n\n        There was evidence which showed that Azman had\n\nbeen to the apartment on previous occasions. Rohaizan said she saw him with Ruzaini when\n\nshe visited the apartment, and she was not challenged. Isnin testified that Azman was at\n\nthe apartment on 16 August 2001 packing drugs.63.\n\n        I rejected Azman’s defence that he had no\n\nknowledge of the drugs in the flat, and had nothing to do with them. His evidence,\n\nexemplified by his changing positions on the retrieval of the apartment keys, the\n\ninstructions from Sam, the false ceiling, whether he had been to the apartment before the\n\nday of arrest was unsatisfactory and cannot be believed.64.\n\n        Ruzaini used Rohaizan to rent the apartment and\n\nreceived the apartment keys from her. She saw him with Azman when she visited the flat.\n\nIsnin had also stated that Ruzaini and Rohaizan were in the apartment when he brought food\n\nand drinks there, and that Ruzaini and Azman were there with him on 16 August 2001 when\n\nthey packed drugs together. Isnin had also said that Ruzaini telephoned him on 17 August\n\n2001 for his help, which he understood to be help to pack drugs in the apartment.\n\nRuzaini’s evidence was that he needed help to carry some clothes to his adopted\n\nmother. He said that he had asked Isnin for help with transport, but that was not put to\n\nIsnin. It was also not put to Isnin that he was wrong to think that the request was for\n\nhelp to pack drugs when help was specifically sought for transport. When Isnin went to the\n\napartment and found the drugs, that confirmed his understanding that Ruzaini wanted his\n\nhelp to pack drugs.65.\n\n        His explanation for renting the apartment did\n\nnot stand up to examination. He said that he rented it for Brother, and had told Rohaizan\n\nthat when they looked for the apartment. Rohaizan’s evidence was that he told her he\n\nwanted an apartment for him to stay in with his friends. Her evidence was not disputed,\n\nand it was not put to her that she was told that the apartment was rented for his friend.\n\nRohaizan’s unchallenged evidence that she had gone to the apartment to meet Ruzaini\n\non several occasions showed that he had more to do with the apartment than being\n\nBrother’s proxy for renting it.66.\n\n        His defence that he was waiting for Azman when\n\nhe was arrested. He said they arranged to meet at Cascadale condominium to go to Orchard\n\nRoad. This ran counter to Isnin’s evidence that Ruzaini had called him to help pack\n\ndrugs, and Azman told him that Azman and Ruzaini would be there.67.\n\n        Isnin was arrested in the apartment while he\n\nwas packing drugs. By his own admission he had packed drugs there on two previous\n\noccasions, once alone and once with Azman and Ruzaini. He had the keys to the apartment,\n\nand his fingerprint was on the master bedroom false ceiling where 23 packets of heroin\n\nwere hidden.68.\n\n        He knew that there was a lot of drugs in the\n\npremises, enough to cause him to search the apartment and call Brother. His account of the\n\nsearch was varied. Did he search because Brother told him to check for damage, or because\n\nhe saw the drugs, and did he search before he saw the drugs, or after, or both before and\n\nafter?69.\n\n        I accepted Isnin’s evidence that he, Azman\n\nand Ruzaini were packing drugs in the apartment on 16 August as well as his evidence that\n\nRuzaini and Azman called him and spoke to him about going to the \"place\" on 17\n\nAugust. He had already disclosed this in his investigation statements. Isnin was not\n\nseeking any advantage for himself by making these admissions. He was not trying to shift\n\nblame to Azman and Ruzaini or extricate himself, and was implicating himself instead.70.\n\n        The evidence before me was that after Ruzaini\n\nobtained the keys to the apartment on 24 July, he was at the apartment, and Azman and\n\nIsnin were also there. It was not innocuous presence. They were there together on 16\n\nAugust to pack heroin, and 80-120 sachets of that were packed, obviously for the purpose\n\nof trafficking. Azman and Isnin also left their fingerprints where the heroin was hidden.71.\n\n        Their involvement with the apartment and the\n\ndrugs there did not cease on 16 August. The packing of drugs was not completed. There was\n\nmore heroin to be packed. On 17 August each of them still had something to do with the\n\napartment. Azman was there before he went to collect the bag of 30 packets of heroin from\n\nKranji MRT station, and he was returning to the condominium with the bag. Ruzaini was at\n\nthe driveway of the condominium waiting for Azman. Isnin went to the apartment after\n\nreceiving calls from Ruzaini and Azman about going to the apartment, and was at the\n\napartment packing drugs when he was arrested.72.\n\n        When they were arrested the three of them were\n\nstill involved with packing drugs in the apartment. They were in possession of the drugs\n\nin the apartment for the common intention of trafficking. I therefore found them guilty\n\nand convicted them.Sgd:Kan Ting ChiuJudge----------------------------------------------------------------------------1Their photographs were issued to the officers before they were arrested.PS48 para 2, Notes of Evidence page 184, P3122P126A3P126B4P126C5P1306P1917P131 and P1328P127A9P127B10P126B11P19012P126B13P18914P24315P24416P24417P24518P245 para 3019P24620P24721PS1922See PS2023Notes of Evidence pages 410-1, 43424Notes of Evidence pages 524, 57325Notes of Evidence pages 524, 528, 574-526Notes of Evidence pages 54227Notes of Evidence pages 55128Notes of Evidence pages 57129notes of Evidence pages 56730P132 para 931Notes of Evidence pages 583, 59532Notes of Evidence pages 59733P316 para 5134Notes of Evidence page 60535Notes of Evidence pages 610-1, 65536Notes of Evidence page 61537Notes of Evidence page 61538P317 para 3039Notes of Evidence page 65240P317 para 2541Notes of Evidence page 621, P243 para 442Notes of Evidence pages 654-543Notes of Evidence pages 667 & 74044Notes of Evidence page 67045Notes of Evidence page 67646Notes of Evidence pages 681 & 76347Notes of Evidence pages 682, 71048Notes of Evidence page 72949Notes of Evidence page 73050Notes of Evidence page 74051P318 paras 7 & 1252Notes of Evidence page 78053Notes of Evidence page 78254P318 para 1355Notes of Evidence page 78456P319 para 4257P319 para 4358P319 para 5559 Notes of Evidence pages 787-860Notes of Evidence page 79661Notes of Evidence page 82462Notes of Evidence pages 826-763Notes of Evidence page 82864Notes of Evidence page 83165Notes of Evidence pages 981-266Notes of Evidence page 99767Notes of Evidence pages 911 and 100268Notes of Evidence page 91469Notes of Evidence page 84970Notes of Evidence page 86571Notes of Evidence page 88872P12673P 317 para 30Copyright © Government of Singapore."
