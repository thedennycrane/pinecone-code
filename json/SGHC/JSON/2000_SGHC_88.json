        "`Prior to 24 July 1998, [NS] did not act as quickly as it could and should have done with a view to obtaining [JTC`s] consent to the sale in that`": "`after being notified by [JTC] on 20 March 1998 that the application had not been successful because of [NS] was not able to meet [JTC`s] `value added and space utilisation requirements` [NS] did not submit a new application for consent until 20 May 1998`The sale was subject to the written consent of JTC being obtained by SIG. See special condition 1(a). SIG applied to JTC for its consent on 18 December 1997. In the event that such consent was not obtained or should be refused for any reason whatsoever by 27 May 1998 the sale was to become null and void. See special condition 2(a). As alleged by SIG in its statement of claim the consent had been refused by 27 May 1998. It was refused on 20 March 1998. The consent that was refused was the consent applied for by SIG. Down to about 20 May 1998 there was nothing or nothing further to be done by NS to obtain the consent for the sale which SIG was to obtain.On or about 20 May 1998 the parties agreed to an extension of time. That would not by itself make any difference. If by 27 May 1998 consent had been refused it would still have been refused by 27 July 1998. It was not a case of the  consent not having been obtained yet. The statement of claim alleges that `the purpose of the extension was to enable [NS] to appeal to [JTC] for its consent to the sale` and this is admitted by NS in its defence. I think what this means is that when the extension of time was agreed upon the parties also agreed that the sale agreement was still in full force and effect and that NS would appeal to JTC for its consent to buy from SIG and this consent would be the consent for the sale to be obtained by SIG under the sale agreement. I think the parties also agreed that the appeal would be made by NS making the second submission which it did on 20 May 1998.It is not necessary to say anything more but there are some letters among the documents which may be referred to. The reason given by JTC for not giving its consent was that NS was not able to meet its `value-add and space utilisation requirements`. By letter dated 23 March 1998 SIG`s solicitors alleged that NS was in breach of warranty as regards the 60%:40% space utilization requirement in special condition 1(a).On 26 March 1998 NS`s solicitors wrote to JTC to point out that the application was made on the basis of 60% of the gross floor area for production and 40% for storage and office space and that the details of floor space usage showed even a higher percentage for production. This is in accordance with the warranty. As to meeting JTC`s `value-add` or added value requirements there is nothing that NS could reasonably do or be reasonably expected to do. In any case there is no evidence as to what those requirements were or in what way they were not met.On 11 April 1998 JTC wrote to advise that it was looking into the matter and would revert in due course. On 19 May 1998 NS`s solicitors wrote to JTC to enquire as to the outcome of the application. On 20 May 1998 they wrote again and in addition made the second submission. In my judgment NS was not in breach of contract as alleged.`[NS] did not then request [JTC] to deal with its new application with expedition`On 4 June 1998 JTC wrote to NS`s solicitors to advise that it was in the process of `evaluating the proposal` and would get back to them as soon as possible. On 13 July 1998 JTC wrote to NS`s solicitors:2 Please be informed that we require your client, Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd, to submit the following to us:(i) a letter of undertaking that Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd will utilize 90% of the area for manufacturing/assembly/servicing purposes and 10% of the area for office space.(ii) an unaudited or audited Statement of Accounts from 1/1/98 to 30/6/98.(iii) a letter of undertaking that Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd will complete the building and fulfill all investment criteria as stipulated in the building agreement dated 25 October 1996, in particular with reference to cll 2(viii) and 4.3 Looking forward to your reply soonest possible. Thank you.The letters of undertaking went beyond what was reasonable for NS to do (as between SIG and NS) and the accounts were for a period just 13 days ended. Nevertheless these were provided on 20 July 1998. On 24 July 1998 JTC wrote to ask how sales of $17. 02m could be achieved for the year to 31 December 1998 and a complete reply was given on 27 July 1998.I do not see that in these circumstances there was any duty on the part of NS to request JTC to deal with the second submission with expedition. In my judgment NS was not in breach of contract as alleged.`[NS] did not respond to [JTC`s] requirement for further information and written undertakings, albeit that the requirement was communicated to [NS] on 13 July 1998, until 20 July 1998 (when it could and should have responded to it by 15 July 1998 at the latest)`I have set out the terms of JTC`s letter of 13 July 1998. Under special condition 1(a) of the sale agreement NS warranted that it would comply with a 60%:40% space utilization requirement. It was now required to give an undertaking to use not less than 90% of the space for production and not more than 10% for office. Details of space utilization given in its solicitors` letter of 26 March 1998 showed 77% for production.I would have thought that it would be reasonable to allow some time for space utilization to be reconsidered before giving an undertaking in terms required by JTC. The accounting period ended 30 June 1998. Again some time would have to be allowed for the accounts to be done. In the event NS took seven days to deliver the documents asked for. No evidence has been given that it could have complied with the requirements earlier or that it could have done so in two days as alleged by SIG. In my judgment NS was not in breach of contract as alleged.",
        "`[NS] did not comply with [JTC`s] requirement, made on 24 July 1998, for an explanation as to the apparent discrepancy between its gross sales for the first half of 1998 and its projection for the whole of 1998`": "There was no discrepancy apparent or otherwise. JTC`s letter of 24 July 1998 has already been given above. JTC asked NS to advise how it could achieve sales of $17. 02m for the year to 31 December 1998 (as projected in its second submission made on 20 May 1998) when its actual sales for the six months to 30 June 1998 were only $5. 28m.NS was in the business of manufacturing corrugated paper cartons, CPO (computer print-outs) and SOP (sorted office paper) from waste paper for export to Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines and Korea. It explained in its solicitors` letter that the projections had not been achieved in view of the economic downturn which particularly affected these four countries. NS only managed $5. 28m in the first half of 1998 `through great effort` and was confident of achieving $2. 5m in the second half. That would make $7. 78m for the year which still had more than five months to run. The letter concluded by saying that the position would be reviewed from time to time. It was an admission that the projected sales were not going to be or were unlikely to be achieved.Ms Lai Sin Yee is the customer service manager of JTC and during the relevant time she was the senior lease management officer. She said that towards the end of this case she was kept informed and she has had the benefit of going through JTC`s file records.Ms Lai was referred to NS`s solicitors` letter of 27 July 1998 during examination in chief. Her evidence was:Q: PB-113. Complied with JTC`s requirement?(Note: PB-113 is a copy of the letter of 27 July 1998. )A: No. Data not sufficient.(To court):To us information not sufficient. Can`t see from records if Miss Poh has actually asked from applicant to re-submit whole of Part IV. Also no record of any communication to applicant after PB-113The information was not sufficient for JTC but she did not say in what way it was not. I think it was in that sense that she said NS had not complied with JTC`s requirement. In fact NS had complied. It admitted that the projected sales were not going to be or were unlikely to be achieved. It gave a revised projection of $7. 78m for the year to 31 December 1998.Later Ms Lai was referred to JTC`s letter dated 19 August 1998 to SIG`s solicitors. This was in reply to their letter of 14 August 1998 which stated:... please let us know the reason(s) for the Corporation`s delay in giving the necessary consent to the parties` application on an immediate basis.We are however given to understand that you had requested from the purchasers the following two items:(1) to submit the company`s past audited account to show the company`s turnover exceeding $17m as represented; and(2) to resubmit the projection for 1998 taking into consideration the first half year unaudited account turnover of about $5. 2mwhich are still outstanding from the purchasers. Please confirm.There is no evidence that JTC had requested the two items. Ms Lai could see no record of this. NS had not represented sales exceeding $17m. In its second submission made in May 1998 it projected sales of $17. 02m for the year to 31 December 1998 which was then still current. The statement was untrue. It was an impolite letter. It accused JTC of delay in giving its consent. It presumed without any basis that its consent would be given.JTC`s reply written by Ms Poh sated:Please take note it is not that JTC has failed to give the necessary consent to the sale and purchase of the abovementioned property but we would require the re-submission of the projected 1998 figures before we can proceed further.It did not say that re-submission of the 1998 projected sales had been called for. Its letter of 24 July 1998 only asked to be advised how the projected sales could be achieved. This is wholly inconsistent with a request for a re-submission. Such a  request if any could only have been made after receipt of NS`s solicitors` letter of 27 July 1998. As Ms Lai said in evidence there was no reply to that letter and in any event time for obtaining JTC`s consent would have expired. In my judgment NS was not in breach of contract as alleged.",
        "`[NS] could and should have provided [JTC] with that explanation before 1. 30pm on 27 July 1998`": "No evidence has been given in support of this allegation. Even if the explanation had been provided before 1. 30pm on 27 July 1998 there is no evidence that it would have served any purpose.On 21 October 1998 SIG`s solicitors (instructed in place of the previous solicitors) wrote to JTC and put a number of questions to it including:In the event that PK Wong & Advani or Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd had responded with (1) only the aforesaid clarification, (2) both the clarification and re-submission (whether simultaneous or otherwise), please confirm if you would have been in a position in each case to grant your consent to the assignment of the above property.PK Wong & Advani were NS`s solicitors. JTC`s answer in its letter of 29 October 1998 was:In the event that PK Wong & Advani or Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd had responded with (1) only the aforesaid clarification, (2) both the clarification and re-submission (whether simultaneous or otherwise), we would not have been in a position to grant consent immediately as the application needed to be evaluated based on our list of criteria.Ms Lai was referred to JTC`s answer under cross-examination and her evidence was:Q: PB-157. Item 2(f). If defendant had re-submitted whole of Part IV revised between 24 and 27/7/98 JTC in a position to grant approval?(Note: PB-157 is a copy of JTC`s letter of 29 October 1998 and item 2(f) is the para stated above. )A: Assuming data correct and sufficient we would normally need 18 working days from full submission of data.On re-examination she said:Q: Normally 18 working days. Difference to answer if applicant merely submitting additional data and not whole application?A: If only some additional information required upon submission of data would take about three to five working days to give consent letter.(To court): Depends on earlier submission. If shortly before would still require more time. Also depends on additional information required and information given. May require further investigation. May take more time.In my judgment SIG has not made good this allegation.",
        "`[NS] did not re-submit the said revised projection for 1998 as [JTC], to the knowledge of [NS],required [NS] to do in order to be in a position to grant written consent to the sale by 27 July 1998`": "JTC`s letter of 29 October 1998 which was also written by Ms Poh contains a statement that `re-submission of complete data` was requested byJTC verbally on 24 July 1998. This allegation was made earlier and was denied by NS in its solicitors` letter to JTC on 12 October 1998. JTC`s reply again written by Ms Poh stated:According to our records, we did inform your client, Mr Louis from Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd, verbally on 24 July 1998 about the `re-submission of complete data`. We had required Newspaper Seng Pte Ltd to furnish a realistic figure to the original figure of S$17. 02m, which they pleaded was unattainable in your letter of 27 July 1998, and to re-fill Part IV of the application form for the assignment to facilitate our evaluation.Ms Lai`s evidence is that there were no such records. It seems quite clear on a plain reading of the letter that if someone on behalf of JTC did in fact make known to NS its requirement for NS to refill Part IV of the application form that person would have done so after rather than before NS had `pleaded` that `the original figure ... was unattainable` in its solicitors` letter of 27 July 1998.Mr Kasi said that Ms Poh would be in court on 27 January 2000 to testify. On 27 January 2000 Mr Kasi said he had spoken to her and he was unable to obtain an affidavit from her. He did not call her and SIG closed its case without her evidence.In my judgment it has not been proved that NS was informed or knew at any time before its solicitors` letter of 27 July 1998 was sent to JTC or at any time at all that JTC required it to re-submit a revised projection for 1998 or as alleged.",
        "`The projection of gross sales for 1998 as set out in [NS`s] letter to [JTC] dated 27 July 1998 was not a genuine projection, but was, as it was intended to be, an intentional understatement of the projected sales for 1998, made with a view to deterring [JTC] from granting consent to the sale`": "There is no evidence that any of the statements made in the letter of 27 July 1998 was untrue or inaccurate. There is no evidence as to the actual sales achieved for 1998. The evidence as to sales of $5. 28m for the six months ended 30 June 1998 was unchallenged. The economic downturn referred to in the letter is a matter of such notoriety that I may take judicial notice of it. I have not been called upon by NS to do so but I see no reason to believe that it did not exist. The estimate of $2. 5m sales for the six months to the end of the financial year does not appear to be anything other than a genuine estimate.In my judgment it has not been proved that the projection of sales for 1998 in the letter of 27 July 1998 was not a genuine projection. It has not been proved that it was an understatement of the projected sales or that NS had intended to understate such sales or had done so for the reason alleged.If JTC`s consent is not obtained by 27 July 1998 or is refused `for any reason whatsoever` the sale becomes null and void. That is what special condition 2(a) plainly says.JTC`s consent may fail without any default on the part of either party. It may also fail by reason of some default. It seems to me to be unlikely that `any reason whatsoever` in special condition 2(a) will include default on the part of the party seeking to treat the contract as null and void unless the contract construed as a whole points to some other construction.Special condition 2(b) provides that `in the further event` that the JTC`s consent fails `due to the neglect and/or default of either party other than in respect of the representations and warranties herein` then neither party is to be compensated for loss and expenses suffered and incurred as a result of the defaulting party`s act of default and/or neglect. Quite clearly the parties intended to make special provision for the particular case or `further event` of a failure of the consent which is due to neglect or default.Under special condition 2(b) where there is neglect or default which causes the consent to fail then except as provided neither party is entitled to compensation for loss or expense. Such loss or expense can only arise if the sale agreement cannot be carried into effect and it cannot be carried into effect without JTC`s consent. But it is not every kind of neglect or default that has the effect of conferring exemption upon the party in default. Excluded and expressly so excluded is neglect or default `in respect of the representations and warranties [in the sale agreement]`.The sale agreement provides for the sale and purchase of the land subject to theterms and conditionsmentioned. Clause 8 of the sale agreement provides that the sale is subject to thespecial conditionswhich are set out. Clause 9 incorporates thegeneral conditionsof sale known as `The Singapore Law Society Conditions of Sale` in so far as they are not varied by or inconsistent with thespecial conditionsandother termscontained in the sale agreement. Special condition 13 provides (as does special condition 19 also) that theterms and conditionsof the sale agreement remain in full force and effect and do not merge with the transfer of the land on completion.In these provisions the draftsman has employed the expressions `terms and conditions`, `special conditions`, `general conditions` and `terms`. In contrast special condition 1(a) provides that NSwarrantsthat it will comply with the 60%:40% space utilization requirement. Special condition 16 provides that SIGwarrantsthat all additions and alterations to the buildings constructed on the land which are not in accordance with plans approved by JTC have been carried out with the approval of the relevant authorities. Special condition 21(3) provides that SIG warrants that it has complied with and will continue to comply with the terms of the JTC agreement of 25 October 1996. Finally special condition 24 provides that SIG warrants and represents that the land area is 4,964 sq m and the built up area of the buildings is 3,067. 63 sq m. Provision is also made for variation of the price in the event of variations in the areas.The sale agreement was negotiated between the parties and the form of the agreement was amended and finally settled between separate solicitors representing the parties. I think the expressions `representations` and `warranties` have been used to refer to those matters provided for in special conditions 1(a),  16, 21(3) and 24. The parties clearly attach great importance to these matters and it appears that these are the sort of matters which would attract such attention.Mr Kasi submitted that there was no significance in the choice of expressions so that `warranties` in special condition 2(b) meant no more than `terms`. I am unable to agree. `Neglect and/or default of either party` must be neglect or default in respect of some provision of the sale agreement. If `warranties` means no more than terms then there would be no point in providing for neglect or default and then excluding neglect or default in respect of warranties. In place of the whole of special condition 2(b) all that would be necessary if that be the intention is to qualify `any reason whatsoever` in special condition 2(a) by excludingneglect or defaultof either party.The only warranty given by NS is to comply with the 60%:40% space utilization requirement. This it has undertaken to do with JTC. Since the utilization will not commence before JTC`s consent is obtained and the sale completed an undertaking is all that can be given at that stage. In any case it is not SIG`s case that there has been any default in respect of this warranty.Mr Kasi submitted that NS was slow or delayed in submitting its application and in responding to JTC`s request at various stages. He referred toSelvadurai Pala Krishnan & Partners v Francis Adrian & Co Pte Ltd & AnorSLR 403. I have found that NS was not in default or in breach of contract as alleged and there is no evidence of tardiness or delay and even if NS was in default in this respect it would not be liable to compensate SIG but in any case I do not see howSelvadurai Pala Krishnan & Partnersassists.In that case the sale was subject to the approval of JTC to the purchasers` application for use of the property formanufacturing wooden container sleevesand the purchasers were to apply within seven days for the approval. FA Chua J said at p 407:The [purchasers] were under an obligation to take all reasonable steps to obtain such approval from JTC.The evidence clearly shows that the delay in getting JTC`s approval was due entirely to the [purchasers] trying to obtain approval for the storage of stuffed containers when it had been clear to them as early as 12 October 1983, that the JTC would not approve the application.The contract was made on 22 September 1983 and if the approval was not granted by 8 December 1983 then the contract was off. The purchasers applied for approval to use the propertyfor storage of stuffed containersand persisted in their application down to 2 December 1983. Approval was not granted by the time limited or at all. That case has no application to the case before me.The sale agreement has become null and void as JTC`s consent for the sale was refused or was not obtained by 27 July 1998. The failure of the consent was not caused by any neglect or default on the part of NS but even if it was the neglect or default was not in respect of any representations or warranties within the meaning of special condition 2(b) and SIG is not entitled to any compensation for any loss or expense suffered or incurred as a result of the neglect or default.The counterclaim of NS is for a declaration. There will be judgment accordingly.Outcome:Plaintiffs` claim dismissed; defendants` counterclaim allowed.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
