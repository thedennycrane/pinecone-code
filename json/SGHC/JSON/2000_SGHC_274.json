        "The claim": "1.    Admiralty in Rem No 774 of 1998 and In Rem Suit no\n\n773 of 1998 were isochrorous actions. This judgment arises from the former.2.    This action was brought against the ship or vessel\n\n\"VIRGO I\" ex \"KAPITAN VOLOSHIN\" of the Port of Belize.3.    Belize is the main port in the small Central\n\nAmerican state called Belize. Formerly it was British Honduras. It remains within the\n\nCommonwealth. Its laws are based on the British System. It has an open ship registry. In\n\ngeneral vessels owned by foreigners may be registered at its port and fly its flag.4.    The action was brought by its crew to recover\n\nwages and other benefits. The crew were all Lithuanians.5.    The action was filed on 18 November 1998. The\n\nvessel was arrested the same day.6.    Singapore Technologies Marine Ltd (\"ST\n\nMarine\") had a claim against the vessel. ST Marine had claims against the vessel for\n\nrepairs, goods supplied and services rendered at their shipyard at Tuas. They asserted\n\nthat they did so at the request of \"the defendants, their servants or agents\".\n\nIn order to protect their interest ST Marine obtained leave and entered appearance as\n\ninterveners. At the time of arrest the vessel was moored at the shipyard of ST Marine.7.    No appearance was entered by the owners of the\n\nvessels. So on 15 December 1998 the crew filed a notice of motion for judgment in default\n\nof appearance. The ship-master of the vessel made and filed an affidavit in support of the\n\napplication for default judgment. The master exhibited a copy of his contract followed by\n\ncopies of the relevant signed pages of the other plaintiffs’ contracts with the\n\ndefendants. The contracting party on the shipowners’ side in each cases was TRANSFLOT\n\nKLAIPEDA. The master exhibited several salary sheets bearing this stamp : M.V. \"VIRGO\n\nI\", BELIZE CITY, REGISTRATION NO. 019831150. The master’s signature appeared on\n\nthe salary sheets.8.    On 13 January 1999, the master filed a\n\nsupplementary affidavit. In this he stated that Falkland Investments SA were the owners of\n\nthe \"VIRGO I\". He exhibited a letter of authorisation addressed to Klaipeda\n\nTransflot Fleet. It made reference to M/V KAPITAN VOLOSHIN later to be renamed \"VIRGO\n\nI\". He further confirmed that Tranflot Kkaipeda represented the plaintiffs (the crew)\n\nand recruited them for Falkland.9.    In April 1999 Bankassure Insurance Services Ltd\n\nand Aon Group Limited (\"the insurers\") filed an action in personam (Suit No 609\n\nof 1999) against Falkland Investments Ltd. The statement of claim asserted that Falkland\n\n\"were the mortgagees in possession and/or the registered owners of the VIRGO I and\n\nKAY\" and that the insurers placed or effected insurances for crew liability and port\n\nrisk for Fakland’s VIRGO I and KAY. They obtained default judgment against Falkland\n\nfor about US$134,000 ON 25 May 1999. In an affidavit the insurers exhibited many debit\n\nnotes from 30 December 1997 to 15 December 1998 having Falkland Investments Ltd as the\n\nassured. The debit notes were in respect of the VIRGO I and the KAY. The insurers obtained\n\na stop order against the proceeds of the sale of the VIRGO I to protect the judgment they\n\nhad obtained.10.    On 15 January 1999, Mr Lee Sieu Kin JC granted\n\njudgment for the plaintiffs. In the meantime on 29 December 1998 the vessels were ordered\n\nto be appraised and sold.11.    In the event, the \"VIRGO I\" was sold\n\nfor S$3,910,000. The price was below the appraised value of the vessel.12.    In the meantime on 12 February 1998 ST Marine too\n\nhad obtained judgment in default of appearance in Admiralty in Rem No 854 of 1998. ST\n\nMarine filed an affidavit exhibiting an invoice which stated owner’s name as Falkland\n\nInvestments Ltd.Owners enter the stage13.    On 19 June 1999 Falkland Investments Ltd applied\n\nby summons in chambers to enter an appearance as defendants. Leave was necessary because\n\njudgment had already been entered. In support of the application legal counsel for\n\nFalkland Investments Ltd filed an affidavit. It exhibited the provisional registration\n\ncertificate issued at the Belize ship registry \"evidencing the fact that Falkland\n\nInvestments Ltd were owners of the vessel\". It was issued on 28 July 1998. He further\n\nexhibited an agreement dated 16 January 1998 evidencing the \"transfer of ownership of\n\nthe KAPITAN VOLOSHIN from Vladivostock Base of Trawling and Refrigeratory Fleet to\n\nFalkland Investments Ltd upon the signing of the agreement\".14.    Lawyers, who acting on behalf of the crew filed\n\naffidavits by the master asserting that Falkland Investments Ltd were the owners of the\n\n\"VIRGO I\", now opposed the application of Falkland Investments Ltd to enter an\n\nappearance. They now appeared on behalf of Vladivostock Base of Trawling and Refrigeratory\n\nFleet (\"VBTRF\"). In the event of Falkland Investments Ltd obtained an order to\n\nenter an appearance. This was made by Mr Tay Yong Kwang JC on 21 July 1999. He made a\n\nqualified order, but eminently sensible order. It read as follows :\"1. [Falkland] be at liberty to enter an appearance as defendants\n\n  in this action.2. This order does not determine the issue as to who is the true owner\n\n  of the vessel and therefore the proceeds of sale.3. [VBTRF] is to take out an application to enter an appearance or to\n\n  intervene in this action within 3 weeks from the date hereof together with supporting\n\n  affidavits.4. No application for payment out of the balance of the proceeds of\n\n  sale be taken out by [Falkland] until after 3 weeks from the date hereof or until further\n\n  order.5. Costs of the appeal be reserved.\"15.    Armed with the order Falkland Investments Ltd on\n\n28 July 1999 entered an appearance as owners. On 17 August 1999 filed a Notice of Motion\n\nNo 251 of 1999 for payment to them or their solicitors the balance of the proceeds of the\n\nsale of the \"VIRGO I\".16.    In the meantime VBTRF intervened in the\n\nproceedings.17.    The next significant development was the filing\n\nof Notice of Motion No 288 of 1999. It was filed on 27 September 1999 by VBTRF. By that\n\napplication VBTRF sought the following orders :\"(1) the determination of the issue of the validity and\n\n  enforceability of the purported Agreement dated 16 January 1998 allegedly made between\n\n  [Falkland] and [VBTRF] be reserved and remitted to the Primorskiy Krai Arbitration Court;\n\n  and that until such final determination thereof all further proceedings herein are to be\n\n  stayed;(2) alternatively, that the purported Agreement dated 16 January 1998\n\n  allegedly made between [Falkland] and [VBTRF] be declared null and void and to have been\n\n  of no effect whatsoever;and that [VBTRF] be substituted as the owners of the ship or\n\n  vessel ‘Virgo I’ (previously known as the ‘Kapitan Voloshin’) [as] the\n\n  defendants herein in place of ‘[Falkland]’; and(3) the costs of these proceedings and this application be taxed and\n\n  paid by [Falkland] to [VBTRF].\"18.    This was two months after Mr Tay Yong Kwang JC\n\nmade the order granting leave to Falkland Investments Ltd to enter an appearance as\n\nowners. At this time VBTRF was in the hands of liquidators in Russia.19.    Originally Notice of Motion 288 of 1999 came up\n\nfor hearing on 15 October 1999. On that day VBTRF had not filed any affidavit in support\n\nof their application. They were still casting about. So it was adjourned.20.    Notice of Motion 288 of 1999 came up for hearing\n\non 23 February 2000. There was no hearing, however. This was because VBTRF had failed to\n\ncomply with an order for security against them. The hearing was adjourned to 27 April\n\n2000. Once again there was no hearing. The hearing was adjourned to 26 May 2000.21.    On 26 May 2000 the Notice of Motion 288 of 1999\n\ncame up for hearing before me. Once again there was no hearing on the issues. It was\n\nadjourned to 20 May 2000.22.    Finally, I heard the Notice of Motion 288 of 1999\n\non 30 June and 3 July 2000. By then more than one year had expired since VBTRF came on the\n\nscene in June 1999 opposing Falkland’s application to enter appearance as owners.23.    After hearing arguments I denied the motion. I\n\nshall now give my reasons.24.    The admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court is\n\nbased on an International Convention – that is the Brussels Convention. Under the\n\nHigh Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act, the High Court has in rem jurisdiction over\n\nforeign vessels in respect of a wide range of maritime matters. Such jurisdiction is based\n\non reciprocity among maritime nations to assist each other in respect of maritime matters.25.    It is in keeping with that spirit and letter that\n\nthe Singapore High Court allowed and caused the arrest of the \"VIRGO I\". The\n\narrest was done on the basis of the vessel belonged to the Port of Belize. The master and\n\ncrew invoked the jurisdiction on the basis that the vessel belonged to the Port of Belize\n\nand her owners were Falkland Investments Ltd. The ship entered Singapore showing the flag\n\nof Belize.26.    ST Marine supplied goods and rendered services\n\nand later instituted admiralty in rem action on the assertion that Falkland Investments\n\nLtd were the owners of the \"VIRGO I\". Singapore exercised in rem jurisdiction\n\nover the ship on the basis that Falkland Investments Ltd were the owners. It would be\n\nwholly incongruous, if at all possible, now to relinquish the jurisdiction after the sale.\n\nThe sale proceeds are in Singapore subject to the adjudicating power of the Court that\n\narrested and sold the ship. I did not think that I had power to transfer the proceedings\n\nor stay the proceedings after the Singapore High Court has given two judgments (one for\n\nthe crew and the other for ST Marine) and made payments out of the proceeds in respect of\n\nliabilities incurred by Falkland Investments Ltd. If Falkland Investments Ltd says that\n\nthe moneys in the High Court belong to them it is the responsibility of this court to\n\nadjudicate on it and not leave the matter to be decided by another Court in another land.\n\nIf I were to relinquish the case at this last stage it would shatter the confidence which\n\nthe nations of the world have in our administration of justice.27.    The dismissal of the second prayer follows from\n\nthe dismissal of the first prayer. Mr Tay Yong Kwang JC had already given leave to\n\nFalkland Investments Ltd to enter an appearance as owner. There was no appeal against that\n\norder. It must stand. Pursuant to direction given by Mr Tay Yong Kwang JC, VBTRF\n\nintervened in the action and entered an appearance as interveners. The nett effect and\n\nresult of that was to afford every reasonable opportunity to be heard. Falkland\n\nInvestments Ltd had to establish their entitlement to the balance of the proceeds of the\n\nsale of the ship. VBTRF had the right to contest the claim of Falkland Investments Ltd.\n\nVBTRF would have the opportunity to be heard in the application for payment out by\n\nFalkland Investments Ltd. VBTRF’s application was unnecessary in the circumstances.\n\nIt was a side wind. VBTRF should take the bull by the horn and not pull it by the tail.\n\nAccordingly I denied it.G P SelvamJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
