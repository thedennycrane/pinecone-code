        "Introduction": "1 The accused, Tristan Tan Yi Rui, was charged under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) for trafficking in a controlled drug, by having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking a packet containing not less than 337.6g of methamphetamine (“the Drugs”).1Foot Note 1×Arraigned Charge dated 17 September 2021 at p 1.Having considered the submissions and the evidence, I found the accused guilty of the offence and convicted him of the charge. Given that his role had not been restricted to that of a courier,ie, within the meaning of s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA, and no certificate of substantive assistance was issued by the Public Prosecutor,2Foot Note 2×Notes of Evidence (“NEs”) (9 February 2023) at p 6 lines 8–23, 31–p 7 lines 1–4.I sentenced him to death pursuant to s 33(1) of the MDA read with the Second Schedule therein. These Grounds of Decision explain my decision on conviction and sentence.",
        "Background": "2 On the morning of 27 September 2018, a team of Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers proceeded to the area around Fourth Lok Yang Road to conduct an operation involving PW51 Muhammad Hakam bin Suliman (“Hakam”),3Foot Note 3×Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”) at para 2.who was suspected of being involved in drug activities.4Foot Note 4×Statement of Station Inspector Tay Keng Chye dated 13 August 2020 at para 3 (Agreed Bundle (“AB”) at p 102). 3 At about 6.15pm, the accused, who was driving a white Volkswagen car (“the white car”), parked outside 3 Fourth Lok Yang Road. PW46 Muhammad Hanis bin Mohamed Mokhtar (“Hanis”) was seated in the front passenger seat of the white car.5Foot Note 5×ASOF at para 3. 4 At about 7.40pm, a green Suzuki car (“the green car”) arrived at 3 Fourth Lok Yang Road as well.6Foot Note 6×ASOF at para 4.Hakam exited the green car and Hanis exited the white car.7Foot Note 7×ASOF at para 4; Statement of Staff Sergeant Au Yong Hong Mian dated 13 August 2020 at para 5 (AB at p 130).They met and proceeded to board the white car together, which the accused then drove to the vicinity of a coffee shop located at 21 Kian Teck Road (“the Kian Teck Road coffee shop”).8Foot Note 8×ASOF at para 4.Hanis alighted from the white car and entered the coffee shop for a short while before returning to the white car.9Foot Note 9×ASOF at para 4.The accused then drove the white car back to Fourth Lok Yang Road.10Foot Note 10×ASOF at para 4. 5 At about 8.20pm, two unknown riders, on motorcycles bearing Malaysian licence plates, arrived at Fourth Lok Yang Road. One of the unknown riders met up with Hakam behind the white car.11Foot Note 11×ASOF at para 5.Both motorcycles left Fourth Lok Yang Road thereafter.12Foot Note 12×ASOF at para 5. 6 Shortly thereafter, the accused drove the white car from Fourth Lok Yang Road to a Housing Development Board (“HDB”) block in Tampines, with Hanis still seated in the front passenger seat.13Foot Note 13×ASOF at paras 6–7.Upon arrival, the accused stopped the white car along the service road beside the block.14Foot Note 14×ASOF at para 7.A team of CNB officers then moved in to arrest the accused and Hanis.15Foot Note 15×ASOF at para 8. 7 The officers proceeded to carry out a search on the white car in the presence of the accused and Hanis.16Foot Note 16×ASOF at para 9.A red and black taped bundle was retrieved from the white car (“the bundle”) and was thereafter sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.17Foot Note 17×ASOF at paras 9 and 16.The bundle contained a plastic packet, which was found to contain not less than 499.0g of crystalline substance, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 337.6g of methamphetamine.18Foot Note 18×ASOF at para 17.",
        "The parties’ respective cases": "",
        "The Prosecution’s case": "8 The Prosecution submitted that the accused possessed the Drugs, knew the Drugs to be methamphetamine, and intended to traffic in the Drugs.19Foot Note 19×Prosecution’s Closing Submissions dated 5 December 2022 (“PCS”) at para 14.The Prosecution sought to prove the accused’s possession of the Drugs and knowledge of their nature, whilst relying on the presumption under s 17(h) of the MDA to establish the element of trafficking.20Foot Note 20×PCS at para 14. 9 The Prosecution relied on a few key pieces of evidence to show that the accused intended to and did take possession of the Drugs by making arrangements with an individual known to him as “Hari”,21Foot Note 21×PCS at para 15.whom the accused testified had previously supplied him with small amounts of methamphetamine for his own consumption.22Foot Note 22×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 10 line 29; p 11 line 12. 10 First, the Prosecution relied on messages found on two mobile phones which allegedly belonged to the accused, “TT-HP1” and “TT-HP2”. The messages on TT-HP1 allegedly showed the accused’s intention to take possession of the Drugs knowing that it was methamphetamine, and to traffic in the Drugs.23Foot Note 23×PCS at para 16.These messages essentially involved negotiations between the user of TT-HP1 and Hari regarding the sale and handover of the Drugs.24Foot Note 24×Exhibit P96 (Aide Memoire for selected WhatsApp messages extracted from “TT-HP1”) at pp 1–16. 11 The Prosecution argued that, contrary to the accused’s testimony that TT-HP1 had been used by other persons,25Foot Note 25×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 34 lines 8–10; p 35 lines 20–21; p 72 lines 1–11.the accused had in fact been the sole user of TT-HP1, and hence the messages found on TT-HP1 discussing the sale of drugs on 27 September 2018 had been sent by the accused.26Foot Note 26×PCS at para 43.In support of this argument, the Prosecution relied on personal messages found on TT-HP1 between the accused and his then-fiancée, PW53 Ho Yan Yan “Sherane” (“Sherane”),27Foot Note 27×PCS at paras 31–39.which the accused acknowledged had all been sent by him.28Foot Note 28×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 77 lines 9–12.The Prosecution also contended that the striking similarity in the content of the messages found on TT-HP1 and the messages found on TT-HP2, which the accused testified was his personal mobile phone, indicated that the accused had been the sole user of TT-HP1.29Foot Note 29×PCS at para 17, 40–43. 12 The Prosecution argued further that “Travis”, the individual whom the accused testified had passed him TT-HP1 on the day of the arrest, was not a real person and did not exist outside of the accused’s story.30Foot Note 30×PCS at para 44.Instead, “Travis” was the accused’s alias which he used for his drug transactions.31Foot Note 31×PCS at para 45.This was evidenced by messages found on TT-HP2 which showed the accused telling his friends to contact TT-HP1 for the purpose of drug transactions, and to address him as “Travis” when doing so.32Foot Note 32×PCS at para 45(b). 13 Next, the Prosecution relied on the testimony of Hanis, who had been arrested in the front passenger seat of the white car driven by the accused at the material time. Hanis testified that the day of the arrest was the first time he had met the accused and that he was only there to facilitate, on behalf of Hari, the accused’s collection of the Drugs that evening.33Foot Note 33×PCS at para 18.He explained that his role was to “see through” the deal on behalf of Hari.34Foot Note 34×PCS at para 19.His evidence was that the accused had taken possession of the bundle from Hakam, and that the accused had been in the midst of packing his things, including the bundle, which the accused had placed near the handbrake area of the white car, at the time of the arrest.35Foot Note 35×PCS at para 19. 14 Lastly, the Prosecution relied on the presence of the accused’s DNA on the interior of the bundle to show that he had taken possession of the Drugs. The Prosecution drew attention specifically to the fact that the DNA was found not on the exterior surface of the bundle, but rather on the packet wrapped within it.36Foot Note 36×PCS at paras 20 and 61. 15 The Prosecution argued that taken together, these key pieces of evidence proved that the accused had intended to take possession of the Drugs and knew the Drugs were methamphetamine. First, the fact that the accused was the sole user and author of the messages found on TT-HP1 showed that he had arranged for the purchase and receipt of the Drugs.37Foot Note 37×PCS at para 51.The element of possession was further supported by Hanis’ evidence of the accused’s possession of the Drugs as well as the presence of the accused’s DNA on the packet of methamphetamine which was wrapped within the bundle.38Foot Note 38×PCS at paras 56 and 61. 16 As for the element of possession with intention to traffic, the Prosecution relied on the presumption of trafficking under s 17(h) of the MDA.39Foot Note 39×PCS at para 73.The Prosecution argued that the Defence had not succeeded in rebutting this presumption.40Foot Note 40×PCS at paras 73 and 79.Furthermore, the messages on TT-HP1 indicated that the accused had been actively engaged in trafficking activity.41Foot Note 41×PCS at paras 77–78.",
        "The accused’s version of events": "17 The accused testified that he was a regular drug user and that Hari was his supplier.42Foot Note 42×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 10 line 29; p 11 line 12.He would usually buy 1.25g of methamphetamine each time from Hari, which would last him about three to four days.43Foot Note 43×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 39 lines 5–10; NEs (23 February 2022) at p 3 lines 28–32.Sometimes, Hari would give the accused drugs for free, in exchange for the accused doing him favours.44Foot Note 44×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 11 lines 9–10.These favours usually involved the accused ferrying Hari’s friends around in his car or helping them to withdraw money.45Foot Note 45×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 34 lines 1–3. 18 The accused testified that on 27 September 2018, at roughly 4am in the morning, he had called Hari to order some methamphetamine for his own consumption. They agreed to meet in Bedok for the accused to collect this order. However, instead of accepting the accused’s payment, Hari declined and told the accused that if he agreed to do him a favour, Hari would not charge him for that order. The accused agreed to perform the favour, which was to accompany Hari, albeit in separate cars, from Bedok to Anson Road and then to Marina South Pier.46Foot Note 46×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 16 lines 14–26. 19 After accompanying Hari to Marina South Pier, the accused made his way back to his then-fiancée, Sherane’s, flat in Tampines.47Foot Note 47×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 17 lines 1–6.However, shortly after he returned to the flat, Hari called him and told him to meet Travis, one of Hari’s friends, and send Travis to Marina South Pier.48Foot Note 48×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 17 lines 5–11; NEs (23 February 2022) at p 22 line 7–p 23 line 7.The accused proceeded to meet Travis and to send him to Marina South Pier.49Foot Note 49×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 17 lines 13–20.After spending some time waiting in the car at Marina South Pier, Travis left the car and told the accused to meet Hari back in Tampines.50Foot Note 50×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 17 lines 18–26.It was then that Travis allegedly left the mobile phone, TT-HP1, in the accused’s car.51Foot Note 51×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 17 lines 18–20.As observed earlier at [10], the Prosecution’s case relied significantly on the messages found on TT-HP1. Thus, the questions of the ownership of TT-HP1 and the messages which were found on it were crucial in this case and will be discussed in greater detail below. 20 After leaving Marina South Pier, the accused returned to Tampines and met Hari, who then asked the accused to meet Travis again at a nearby multi-storey carpark.52Foot Note 52×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 17 line 30–p 18 line 10.Upon meeting Travis at the muti-storey carpark, the accused was asked by Travis, ostensibly on the instructions of Hari, to meet Hanis, another friend of Hari’s, at another HDB block in Tampines.53Foot Note 53×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 18 line 12–p 20 line 24. 21 The accused proceeded to meet Hanis, who instructed him to drive to the Lok Yang area in Tuas.54Foot Note 54×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 21 lines 6–13.The accused thus drove to Fourth Lok Yang Road with Hanis in his car.55Foot Note 55×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 21 line 19.Upon reaching Fourth Lok Yang Road, and after waiting for a while, the accused saw Hanis talking to Hakam outside the car.56Foot Note 56×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 22 lines 13–18.Thereafter, he drove Hanis and Hakam to get cigarettes and drinks at the Kian Teck Road coffee shop.57Foot Note 57×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 23 lines 1–4.He then drove them back to Fourth Lok Yang Road.58Foot Note 58×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 23 lines 20–22. 22 The accused, Hanis and Hakam waited at Fourth Lok Yang Road for some time, with Hanis and Hakam outside the car, before a motorcycle arrived and stopped next to the accused’s car.59Foot Note 59×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 25 lines 6–14.Upon the arrival of the motorcycle, Hanis returned to the passenger seat whilst Hakam met the motorcyclist.60Foot Note 60×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 25 lines 10–19.The motorcyclist handed a red plastic bag to Hakam, who handed it to the accused through the window of the car.61Foot Note 61×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 25 lines 21–25.The accused took the red plastic bag and passed it to Hanis.62Foot Note 62×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 26 lines 2–6.Hakam proceeded to hand some money over to the motorcyclist, who then left the location.63Foot Note 63×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 26 lines 8–25.Hakam returned to his own vehicle which was across the street,64Foot Note 64×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 26 lines 24–25.after which the accused and Hanis left Fourth Lok Yang Road for Tampines in the accused’s car.65Foot Note 65×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 26 lines 27–28. 23 When the accused and Hanis reached Sherane’s block in Tampines, he parked the car and stepped out of it. It was then that the CNB officers moved in to arrest him.66Foot Note 66×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 26 line 30–p 27 line 2.",
        "The Defence’s case": "24 The Defence argued, in line with the accused’s version of events, that the messages found on TT-HP1 relating to discussions on the sale of drugs on 27 September 2018 had not been sent by the accused.67Foot Note 67×Defence Closing Submissions dated 6 December 2022 (“DCS”) at para 23.Instead, TT-HP1 was not the accused’s mobile phone and had in fact been used by a number of people at the material time.68Foot Note 68×DCS at para 21.The Defence also contended that “Travis” was not a nickname or alias which the accused used to conduct drug transactions; instead, Travis was a distinct person who had sent the messages to Hari found on TT-HP1, arranging for the transaction on 27 September 2018.69Foot Note 69×DCS at para 21. 25 The Defence further argued that the Drugs had not been meant for the accused and instead that Hari and members of his group had purchased the Drugs for themselves. Thus, the accused had merely been acting as a driver for Hanis, who had been tasked to collect the Drugs for the group. In support of this narrative, the Defence relied on WhatsApp conversations between members of Hari’s group,70Foot Note 70×DCS at paras 28 and 34.which will be discussed in greater detail later. 26 Based on the above reasons, the Defence submitted that the accused merely performed the role of a driver in the transaction involving the Drugs on 27 September 2018, and that he possessed neither knowledge of the nature of the Drugs nor an intention to traffic in them.71Foot Note 71×DCS at paras 48 and 54–58.Hence, the charge was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.72Foot Note 72×DCS at para 59.",
        "The issues to be determined": "27 The following issues arose for determination: (a) Common evidential issues going to credibility and strength of evidence. There were several issues which straddled various elements of the charge, and which had to be dealt with holistically: (i) the use of TT-HP1, which underpinned the evidence relied upon by the Prosecution in respect of the elements of the charge;(ii) the Defence’s contention that Hari and members of his group had bought the Drugs for themselves;(iii) the accused’s actions on the day of the arrest;(iv) Hanis’ credibility; and(v) the evidence of PW52 Muhammad Arif bin Roslan (“Arif”) and PW51 Hakam. (b) The elements of the charge itself, namely: (i) whether the accused’s possession of the Drugs was established;(ii) whether the accused’s knowledge of the nature of the Drugs was established; and(iii) whether the accused’s possession of the Drugs was for the purpose of trafficking.",
        "Common evidential issues": "",
        "The use of the mobile phone TT-HP1": "28 The question of the identity of the user of TT-HP1 formed the crux of this case. This was because the messages found on TT-HP1 involved the user of TT-HP1 negotiating the purchase and handover of drugs from Hari, with the handover to take place on 27 September 2018.73Foot Note 73×Exhibit P96 at p 8 S/Ns 155–159, p 10 S/N 215–p 11 S/N 227.These messages included an exchange between the user of TT-HP1 and Hari on 25 September 2018, in which the user of TT-HP1 asked if it would be possible to arrange a sale of drugs before Hari went on a trip for ten days. This exchange of messages appeared as follows (note that “ESKIMO” was the WhatsApp username of the user of TT-HP1):74Foot Note 74×Exhibit P96 at p 8 S/Ns 155–159. ESKIMO: Bro really when u are away there isnt at all any way to be able to arrange my loadings? ESKIMO: Cos im thinking not only like after this current load ESKIMO: U away 10 days might need 2 probably or even 3 ESKIMO: [Crying face emoticons] ESKIMO: Just tell me when all is confirmed 29 On 27 September 2018 itself, the owner of TT-HP1 tried to negotiate with Hari a reduction in price for the drugs to be handed over and confirmed that he would be receiving twice the usual order from Hari, since Hari would be away for ten days. When Hari replied “[i]f [you] don’t want it’s ok”, the user of TT-HP1 answered “I want of [course]!!!”, thereby confirming that he wished to proceed with the transaction. The messages are reproduced below (note that “AYAM REP” was Hari’s WhatsApp username):75Foot Note 75×Exhibit P96 at p 10 S/N 215–p 11 S/N 227. ESKIMO: Anw what i wanna ask u is…the 250 seond will is there a drop in price or even charge me as 500g nye harge? AYAM REP: Credit kan? ESKIMO: Yes credit ESKIMO: Today im handing over 5400 for as pernormakl order. ESKIMO: However i will be receiving twice the normal order ESKIMO: Due to u being 10 days away ESKIMO: Correct? AYAM REP: If u don’t want it’s ok ESKIMO: I want of cos!!! ESKIMO: Haha ESKIMO: The 10 days u awayi no need pening kepala ESKIMO: Its a genius arrangement ESKIMO: Swear it is 30 Thus, it appears from the exchange between the user of TT-HP1 and Hari that the user of TT-HP1 had negotiated a deal with Hari for a larger-than-usual order of drugs, in view of the fact that Hari was going away for 10 days. The handover of the drugs was to be performed on 27 September 2018, as shown by the messages “[t]oday im handing over 5400 for as pernormakl order” followed by “[h]owever i will be receiving twice the normal order”.76Foot Note 76×Exhibit P96 at p 10 S/Ns 218–219.While the Prosecution sought to rely on the accused’s confirmations during cross-examination to prove that these exchanges related to the sale of the Drugs specifically,77Foot Note 77×PCS at paras 54 and 71(c); NEs (24 February 2022) at p 39 line 15–p 40 line 3.the aforesaid confirmations were not a reliable basis on which to establish such a finding: the accused’s position at trial was that he did not send these messages, accordingly, the Prosecution’s questioning of the accused on these WhatsApp messages required the accused to comment on conversations which he claimed not to have participated in. In this context, the accused’s answers on what he thought these messages related to were irrelevant in ascertaining what they were truly about. 31 Nevertheless, it suffices to say that the messages indicated clearly that the user of TT-HP1 had negotiated for the purchase and handover of drugs from Hari – the quantity of which was much larger than his usual order – with the handover to be performed on 27 September 2018. The Prosecution sought to rely on these messages, which they alleged had been sent by the accused, to show that the accused had purchased the Drugs from Hari and thus had intended to take possession of the packet of methamphetamine that was passed to him at the Lok Yang area on 27 September 2018.78Foot Note 78×PCS at para 54.The Prosecution’s case was that TT-HP1 was a mobile phone used by the accused to conduct his drug transactions, and that he went by the alias “Travis” when using TT-HP1.79Foot Note 79×PCS at para 46.Thus, the messages sent in TT-HP1 regarding the sale of drugs on 27 September 2018 were in fact sent by the accused, leading to the conclusion that he had arranged to purchase the Drugs from Hari.80Foot Note 80×PCS at para 51. 32 The fact that these messages involved arrangements between the user of TT-HP1 and Hari for the sale of the Drugs was not disputed by the Defence.81Foot Note 81×DCS at para 21.Rather, the Defence submitted that it was Travis, instead of the accused, who had communicated with Hari to arrange this transaction.82Foot Note 82×DCS at paras 21 and 23.The Defence’s case was that TT-HP1 was owned by either Hari or Travis and would only be passed to the accused for the purpose of contacting Hari when he was carrying out favours for them.83Foot Note 83×DCS at para 21; NEs (22 February 2022) at p 34 lines 8–10; p 35 lines 20–21; p 72 lines 1–11.Thus, the messages sent in TT-HP1 regarding the sale of the Drugs were not sent by the accused, but instead by Travis.84Foot Note 84×DCS at para 21. 33 I was satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that TT-HP1 was used by the accused up to and at the time of the transaction involving the Drugs, and that the messages sent on TT-HP1 concerning the drug transaction on 27 September 2018 were all sent by him as well. Three pieces of evidence supported this conclusion: (a) personal messages found on TT-HP1; (b) messages sent from TT-HP2 to the accused’s contacts; and (c) the striking similarity between messages sent from TT-HP1 and TT-HP2. 34 First, the messages found on TT-HP1, between the accused and his then-fiancée, Sherane, were very personal and were not of the sort that would have been left on a mobile phone that was being shared or used by others. Some messages involved deeply personal quarrels between the accused and Sherane.85Foot Note 85×Exhibit P96 at pp 57–78.Other messages involved the sharing of individual thoughts and concerns86Foot Note 86×Exhibit P96 at p 61.and the arrangement of daily errands such as sending their child to school87Foot Note 87×Exhibit P96 at p 60 S/Ns 73–85; p 71 S/Ns 329–335; pp 72–73 S/Ns 362–393.– matters which were unlikely to be discussed on a phone which was allegedly used by other persons and only passed to the accused when he was doing favours for Hari and Travis. The existence of these personal messages on TT-HP1 indicated that the accused was the sole user of TT-HP1. 35 Second, messages sent from both TT-HP1 and TT-HP2 to the accused’s contacts showed that TT-HP1 belonged to the accused and was used by him to conduct drug transactions. The accused acknowledged that TT-HP2 was his own personal mobile phone.88Foot Note 88×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 60 lines 25–26; NEs (23 February 2022) at p 10 lines 4–8.When the accused’s contact, saved in TT-HP2 as “CHUN HOWE A P K” (“Chun Howe”), messaged the accused on TT-HP2 asking for help to secure drugs,89Foot Note 89×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 41 line 17–p 42 line 10.the accused sent him the number for TT-HP1, telling him to “[c]ontact that number” and characterising it as “[m]y other numbet [sic]”.90Foot Note 90×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 41 line 27–p 42 line 4; p 42 lines 22–31; Exhibit P-CD3 at Annex E p 83 S/Ns 1905 and 1907.When cross-examined on why he told Chun Howe this, the accused replied “I don’t know why” and “it’s just the other number I’m holding”.91Foot Note 91×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 43 lines 8–12. 36 Similarly, when communicating with another contact, “AH BOI Y S L” (“Ah Boi”), on TT-HP2 regarding the acquisition of drugs, the accused was asked by Ah Boi “U got any other nicknames to call u?”, to which the accused replied “Travis”.92Foot Note 92×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 43 line 17–p 44 line 4; Exhibit P-CD3 at Annex E p 472 S/Ns 10788–10789.He then told Ah Boi “[m]y this line name Travis”,93Foot Note 93×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 44 lines 8–10; Exhibit P-CD3 at Annex E p 471 S/N 10790.before sending him the number for TT-HP1.94Foot Note 94×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 44 lines 16–18; Exhibit P-CD3 at Annex E p 472 S/N 10796.About an hour later, Ah Boi messaged TT-HP1, asking to purchase drugs.95Foot Note 95×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 47 line 20–p 48 line 22; Exhibit P-CD2 at Annex C p 397 S/Ns 1883–1887. 37 Taken together, the messages between the accused, Chun Howe, and Ah Boi showed that the accused had used TT-HP1 for drug transactions, and, when asked by his contacts for drugs, had indicated to them in the messages on his personal mobile phone TT-HP2 that TT-HP1 was his other phone which they should contact for the purpose of arranging drug purchases. The accused also told Ah Boi to address him as “Travis” when contacting TT-HP1 – this indicated that “Travis” was an alias which the accused used when conducting drug transactions on TT-HP1. 38 Other messages on TT-HP1 indicated that the accused’s contacts knew that they were communicating with the accused when they messaged TT-HP1. For example, a series of messages between the user of TT-HP1 and “STEPH” (“Steph”) on 18 August 2018 showed them discussing orders of drugs.96Foot Note 96×Exhibit P96 at p 32 S/N 1–p 33 S/N 25, NEs (24 February 2022) at p 34 lines 5–12.In one of these messages, Steph told the user of TT-HP1 “[o]ne day you at sch nearby hear I shout TRISTANNNN you must come down save me”.97Foot Note 97×Exhibit P96 at p 32 S/N 20.The accused confirmed in cross-examination that Steph was one of his friends.98Foot Note 98×NEs (24 February 2022) at p 34 lines 2–4.Similarly, in a conversation between the user of TT-HP1 and “TIN AV” (“Tin AV”) on 14 July 2018, Tin AV opened the conversation by simply saying “Tris”, to which the user of TT-HP1 replied “Yes”.99Foot Note 99×Exhibit P-CD2 at Annex C p 9678, S/Ns 47404–47405.After agreeing on a purchase of drugs and its collection from the accused’s house, Tin AV asked “Tris? You coming now? If not [I] can go meet you”, to which the user of TT-HP1 replied “U come over”.100Foot Note 100×Exhibit P-CD2 at Annex C p 9681, S/Ns 47417–47418. 39 These messages between the user of TT-HP1, Steph, and Tin AV showed that both Steph and Tin AV were aware, without any prompting from the user of TT-HP1, that they would be communicating with the accused by messaging TT-HP1. This was not consistent with the accused’s account that TT-HP1 was being used by multiple persons and would only be with him on occasions where he was out doing favours for Hari or Travis. Rather, the messages from Steph and Tin AV suggested that the accused was the sole user of TT-HP1, and his contacts knew that. The replies from the user of TT-HP1, which did not correct Steph and TIN AV’s addressing of him as “Tris” or “Tristan”, were also telling – they showed that each time, it was the accused who had replied to the messages on TT-HP1. 40 Lastly, there were messages sent from TT-HP1 regarding drug transactions which the accused claimed were not sent by him, but which bore remarkable similarities to messages sent from TT-HP2, his personal mobile phone. On 30 July 2018, the accused, using TT-HP2, complained to Sherane about the quality of a shipment of methamphetamine which he had received.101Foot Note 101×P96 at p 61 S/Ns 100–103; NEs (23 February 2022 at p 69 lines 19–21.The following day, on 31 July 2018, the user of TT-HP1 sent a message to Hari and “Hong Taxi 1”, another contact, informing them that there was an issue with a shipment of methamphetamine and attempting to assure them that the issue would be resolved.102Foot Note 102×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 69 line 1–p 70 line 14; P96 at pp 1–2 S/Ns 15–18, pp 35–36 S/Ns 35–37. 41 On another occasion, the user of TT-HP1 sent messages to Hari at around 5am on 27 September 2018, expressing alarm and surprise that a meeting at Marina South Pier was supposed to have taken place at 5am instead of 5pm.103Foot Note 103×Exhibit P96 at pp 9–10 S/Ns 196–206.The accused denied having been the user of TT-HP1 at that time.104Foot Note 104×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 68 lines 10–14.The messages read as follows:105Foot Note 105×Exhibit P-CD2 at Annex C pp 2827–2830 S/Ns 13610–13623. AYAM REP: Wry? AYAM REP: Takmo kecoh bro…. ESKIMO: Hey bro ESKIMO: Im home ESKIMO: What happen? AYAM REP: 0500hrs ESKIMO: HUH?? ESKIMO: We pagi??? AYAM REP: Yest I tell u bro ESKIMO: I thot was pm! ESKIMO: I know its 5 AYAM REP: No bro..they are at msp already ESKIMO: Omg its now???!!! ESKIMO: Fuck im flying down 42 At around 8am on 27 September 2018, the accused sent a series of messages to Sherane on TT-HP2, expressing similar unhappiness about a mix-up in timing for a meeting which took place in the morning but which the accused had thought was scheduled for the afternoon.106Foot Note 106×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 65 line 22–p 66 line 24.The messages read as follows:107Foot Note 107×Exhibit P-CD3 at Annex E p 281 S/Ns 6443–6449. Tristan: Im at msp now waitung ti load Tristan: Omg had a major miscounication ytd Tristan: My guy said standby from 630 to 830 Tristan: Obviously since when is morning right? Tristan: This fucking time its am. Morning 43 These conversations showed a striking similarity in the content of the messages sent from TT-HP1 and TT-HP2 regarding the drug transactions. These messages did not merely describe a strikingly similar mix-up but also bore similarity in the feelings and sentiments which the sender of the messages expressed. This indicated that the messages on both phones had been sent by the same person –ie, the accused. 44 Overall, the overwhelming weight of the evidence was in favour of the conclusion that TT-HP1 had been used solely by the accused, primarily for the purpose of conducting drug transactions. First, he used TT-HP1 to discuss personal matters with his then-fiancée, Sherane. He also sent messages from TT-HP2 telling his contacts to contact him on TT-HP1 for the purpose of discussing drug transactions. Despite him telling them to address him as “Travis” when contacting TT-HP1, some of the accused’s contacts continued to address him as “Tristan” or “Tris”, and he did not correct them when they did so. Finally, the messages sent on TT-HP1 and TT-HP2 were on some occasions so similar in content, feelings, and sentiments as to lead to the conclusion that they must have been sent by the same person, namely the accused. 45 All of this supported the narrative that TT-HP1 was the accused’s own mobile phone, which he used to conduct drug transactions and which he attempted to distance himself from by asking others to call him “Travis” when sending messages to that phone. In contrast, the Defence contended that TT-HP1 had been used by various persons, and that on 27 September 2018, the accused had only used TT-HP1 at certain times,ie, when the phone had been passed to him by Travis. Specifically, the accused testified that Travis had left TT-HP1 with him at Marina South Pier sometime in the afternoon of 27 September 2018, such that the messages sent from TT-HP1 to Hari prior to 3.03pm had been sent by Travis, but the messages sent from TT-HP1 to Hari from 3.03pm until 3.29pm had been sent by the accused.108Foot Note 108×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 75 lines 17–25; NEs (23 February 2022) at p 56 lines 4–15.The accused testified that the messages sent to Hari after 3.29pm had been sent by Travis, as the accused had met with Travis again back at Tampines. The accused explained that Travis had taken over the phone until 5.30pm, which had been when he left TT-HP1 with the accused again, and after which the messages sent to Hari had all been sent by the accused.109Foot Note 109×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 56 line 16–p 57 line 4. 46 However, even putting aside the various threads of evidence which showed that the accused had been the sole user of TT-HP1, there were other inconsistencies with the Defence’s account relating to the use of TT-HP1. First, while the accused testified that on 27 September 2018 TT-HP1 had been first left in his use at 3.03pm, he had in fact been messaging Sherane on TT-HP1 from as early as 12.11pm:110Foot Note 110×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 60 lines 20–28.Sherane had messaged TT-HP1 at 12.11pm to ask the accused where he was, to which the accused replied “Msp”.111Foot Note 111×Exhibit P96 at p 73 S/Ns 399–400.When cross-examined on this apparent inconsistency, the accused’s only explanation for it was that at 12pm, he had been waiting with Travis at Marina South Pier, and that “[i]f Sherane messaged this phone, Travis would have passed [it] to me”.112Foot Note 112×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 61 lines 1–8.I did not find this explanation to be convincing as it seemed to be contrived andad hoc. Furthermore, and quite tellingly, it was Sherane whofirstmessaged the accused at 12.11pm, asking him where he was. This showed that Sherane was confident that the accused would be using the phone at the time and thus she contacted TT-HP1 directly with the expectation that the accused would reply. This did not comport with the accused’s account that TT-HP1 would only have been with him sporadically. When questioned on this, the accused simply answered that he had been using TT-HP1 so much that Sherane would just contact him there.113Foot Note 113×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 63 lines 8–14.This explanation was not convincing either, as it likewise did not comport with the accused’s evidence that TT-HP1 would only have been used by him sporadically, whenever he was doing favours for Hari or Travis. Instead, I found that these inconsistencies were best explained by the Prosecution’s account that the accused had always been the sole user of TT-HP1 and Sherane had been aware of this. 47 The time periods during which Travis allegedly had TT-HP1 also seemed remarkably convenient for the accused’s case. They all coincided with the timing of messages which related to the drug transaction on 27 September 2018. First, the accused testified that prior to 3.03pm, all messages sent from TT-HP1 to Hari on 27 September 2018 had been sent by Travis.114Foot Note 114×Exhibit P96 at p 19 S/N 341; NEs (22 February 2022) at p 75 lines 15–18; NEs (23 February 2022) at p 55 lines 29–p 56 line 3; NEs (24 February 2022) at p 43 lines 13–19.These included the messages relating to the discussion of the sale and handover of drugs on that day. Next, the accused testified that from 3.03pm to 3.29pm, the messages sent from TT-HP1 to Hari had been sent by him.115Foot Note 115×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 75 line 30; NEs (23 February 2022) at p 56 lines 4–9.These messages did not relate to the drug transaction and were not incriminating. However, for the time period between 3.29pm and 5.30pm, during which the messages sent from TT-HP1 to Hari had discussed the price of the drugs,116Foot Note 116×Exhibit P96 at p 18 S/Ns 325–340.the accused testified that Travis had taken over the phone again.117Foot Note 117×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 56 lines 16–19.And at the precise moment when the messages switched from discussing the price for the drugs to other matters – there was a gap of only 14 seconds between the last message at 5.30.01pm discussing the drug transaction (which the accused testified Travis had sent) and the next message at 5.30.15pm comprising a photograph of a book (which the accused testified had been sent by himself to Hari)118Foot Note 118×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 56 lines 23–27; p 57 lines 5–10.– the accused testified that he had taken over the phone from Travis.119Foot Note 119×Exhibit P96 at p 19 S/N 341; NEs (23 February 2022) at p 57 lines 5–19.Overall, this account of the phone being passed to-and-fro between the accused and Travis on 27 September 2018, with Travis conveniently, at least for the purposes of the accused’s defence, having possession of it whenever incriminating messages were sent to Hari, was not believable and appeared to have been intricately constructed to dissociate the accused from these messages. 48 Furthermore, the accused’s account and explanations had to be considered against all the evidence discussed above – including the accused’s personal messages found on TT-HP1, the messages on TT-HP2 telling his friends to contact him on TT-HP1, and the similarities between the messages on both phones – which showed that TT-HP1 had been used solely by the accused and primarily for the purpose of conducting drug transactions. In light of all these reasons, I did not accept the Defence’s arguments relating to the use of TT-HP1. The evidence clearly did not comport with the accused’s account that TT-HP1 would only be passed to the accused by Hari or Travis on the occasions when he was out doing favours for them and for the limited purpose of contacting Hari. Thus, I was satisfied that TT-HP1 was used solely by the accused and therefore that the messages sent on TT-HP1 negotiating the sale of drugs on 27 September 2018 were sent by him.",
        "The Defence’s contention that Hari and members of his group bought the Drugs for themselves": "49 The Defence argued, in line with its overall version of events, that the accused did not intend to purchase the Drugs and the Drugs were not meant for the accused. Rather, Hari and the members of his group were the ones who had planned to purchase the Drugs, and the accused had merely acted as a driver for Hanis, who had been tasked to collect the Drugs.120Foot Note 120×DCS at para 3.Thus, the accused did not have possession of the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking.121Foot Note 121×DCS at para 3. 50 In support of this theory, the Defence relied on WhatsApp messages found on Hanis’ handphone, “MHB-HP2”.122Foot Note 122×DCS at para 33.First, the Defence contended that two WhatsApp messages between Hanis and Hari on 27 September 2018 showed that the Drugs were not meant for the accused.123Foot Note 123×DCS at para 28.The first message, sent by Hari to Hanis concerning the transaction involving the Drugs, read “[a]nd don’t disclose anything”, to which Hanis responded with the second message, which was an emoticon of a smirking face.124Foot Note 124×DCS at para 29; AB at p 230.During cross-examination, Hanis testified that he assumed, by Hari’s message, that Hari did not want Hanis to introduce one of Hari’s friends, known as “Luffy”, to the accused.125Foot Note 125×DCS at para 30; NEs (24 November 2021) at p 5 lines 14–16, 30–32–p 6 lines 1–2.However, the Defence argued that Hanis was not being truthful in court, and that these messages showed instead that Hari did not want Hanis to disclose anything about their drug deal, which also involved Luffy, to the accused.126Foot Note 126×DCS at para 31. 51 The Defence also submitted that certain WhatsApp messages between Hari and the members of his group; namely Hanis, Luffy and another individual known as “Cico2”, showed that they had planned to buy the Drugs for themselves.127Foot Note 127×DCS at paras 33–43; Exhibit D4 (WhatsApp messages between Hanis and Cico2 on 27 September 2018 from 4:32am onwards); Exhibit D7 (WhatsApp messages between Hanis, Cico2, Hari, and Luffy on 27 September 2018).First, the Defence referred to a conversation between Cico2 and Hanis on 27 September 2018 where Cico2 informed Hanis that Hari had a drug order for $9,200.128Foot Note 128×DCS at para 35, Exhibit D4 at p 1 S/N 2.Next, the Defence referred to a group chat created by Cico2 on the morning of 27 September 2018 which included Hari, Hanis, Cico2 and Luffy.129Foot Note 129×DCS at para 37; Exhibit D7.These messages essentially involved discussions between the members of the group regarding the sale and collection of the Drugs on that day.130Foot Note 130×DCS at para 39–41; Exhibit D7. 52 The Defence’s contention that Hari and his group bought the Drugs for themselves was not credible. In relation to the conversation between Hanis and Hari where Hari told Hanis “[a]nd don’t disclose anything”, the messages appeared to support Hanis’ evidence that Hari had not wanted Hanis to introduce Luffy to the accused. A few messages after Hari told Hanis “don’t disclose anything”, he told Hanis “[the accused] is not to meet anybody…only u”, followed by the message “[o]nly u n me can meet laffy”.131Foot Note 131×AB at p 231.Thus, this exchange did not show that the accused had not known about the drug transaction and/or that he was being kept in the dark about it; rather, it seemed to concern Hari’s desire to conceal the identity of one of his contacts from the accused. 53 As regards the messages between Cico2 and Hanis as well as the group chat which included Hari and the members of his group, these did not show that the Drugs had been purchased by the group for themselves rather than for the accused. The conversation between Cico2 and Hanis simply involved Cico2 informing Hanis that Hari had a drug order for $9,200.132Foot Note 132×Exhibit D4 at p 1 S/N 2.The messages in the group chat involved arrangements being made, by Hari’s group, for the collection of the Drugs. For example, Cico2 messaged the group on the morning of 27 September 2018 “[s]o now we are waiting for the confirmation of time, place and amount to give upon collection of the 500g”.133Foot Note 133×Exhibit D7 at p 1 S/N 3.Other messages concerned the price for the Drugs as well as arrangements for payment, with Cico2 messaging the group “we will agree on 9.2 for 500g”, to which Luffy replies “[c]an”, and Cico2 later says “[s]o wat we have now is 7k..and we are asking whether the balance of 2.2k can be settled in 4 days”.134Foot Note 134×Exhibit D7 at p 2 S/Ns 12–13; p 3 S/N 19.Although these messages were not clear on who exactly was making payment and to whom, it suffices to note that the discussion of collection and payment for the Drugs by members of Hari’s group was not inconsistent with the narrative borne out by the accused’s messages on TT-HP1. The messages on TT-HP1 showed the accused negotiating with Hari for the purchase and handover of drugs on 27 September 2018; hence, Hari was acting as his supplier in this transaction and presumably procured the drugs from another source. Indeed, the accused himself testified that at the Lok Yang area, the red plastic bag containing the bundle and the packet of drugs had been handed over to Hakam by one of the motorcyclists riding a Malaysian-registered motorcycle.135Foot Note 135×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 25 lines 21–23.Thus, the discussion between members of Hari’s group regarding the collection of and payment for the Drugs was not inconsistent with Hari’s role as the accused’s supplier and the accused’s role as the buyer and ultimate recipient of the Drugs. Members of Hari’s group would have had to arrange for the collection of the Drugs from a source, which appeared to be precisely what they were doing in the WhatsApp conversations. Thus, the messages did not support the Defence’s submission that the Drugs were being purchased by members of Hari’s grouprather than the accused himself, and that the accused had merely been acting as a driver on that day.",
        "The accused’s actions on the day of the arrest": "54 The accused’s account of the events on 27 September 2018 showed him going through a rather circuitous and long-drawn sequence of driving to various destinations and waiting at several of these destinations for many hours. The day began with him driving from Sherane’s flat in Tampines to meet Hari at Bedok, slightly after 4am.136Foot Note 136×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 11 lines 23–25, 32–p 12 line 1.After meeting Hari, the two of them drove, in separate cars, to Anson Road.137Foot Note 137×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 14 lines 8–12.They reached Anson Road at around 6am, following which the accused waited in his car for what he agreed to be “quite a while”.138Foot Note 138×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 16 lines 4–7.Closer to 7am, Hari told the accused to drive to Marina South Pier, which he did, and there he waited for some time again.139Foot Note 139×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 18 lines 25–27; p 19 lines 20–21.After waiting at Marina South Pier, Hari told the accused to drive back home.140Foot Note 140×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 21 lines 1–3.This was at around 9–10am.141Foot Note 141×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 22 line 3.However, shortly after returning to Sherane’s flat, the accused got a phone call from Hari telling him to pick Travis up from another block in Tampines and to send him to Marina South Pier.142Foot Note 142×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 22 line 29–p 23 line 7.At this stage, the accused had been driving around according to Hari’s instructions for around seven hours, which he testified was already the longest such session to date.143Foot Note 143×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 23 lines 14–17. 55 After driving Travis to Marina South Pier, the accused waited there for what he agreed was probably “1 or 2 hours”.144Foot Note 144×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 25 lines 21–22.Eventually, Travis left the car and told the accused to drive back to Tampines to meet Hari.145Foot Note 145×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 26 lines 27–29.At this point, more than eight hours had passed since the accused started driving at 4am in the morning, and he testified that at this time he still did not know why he was being asked to drive around and wait at these various locations.146Foot Note 146×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 28 lines 9–12. 56 Upon meeting the accused in Tampines, Hari told the accused to meet Travis again at a nearby block.147Foot Note 147×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 30 lines 27–30.Travis then told the accused to drive to meet Hanis at another block in Tampines.148Foot Note 148×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 35 lines 1–5.The accused did so and was then instructed by Hanis to drive to the Lok Yang area in Tuas.149Foot Note 149×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 21 lines 6–13.There, in the accused’s words, “there was a lot of waiting”,150Foot Note 150×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 25 line 6.before the drug transaction finally took place at around 8.20pm.151Foot Note 151×ASOF at para 5.After that, the accused drove back to Sherane’s block in Tampines, whereupon he was arrested when he got out of the car. 57 Thus, the accused’s account of the events on 27 September 2018 involved him driving to various locations, some of them repeated ones, and waiting for long periods of time at several locations. The truth of some of the details provided by the accused was doubtful; for example, given the finding that Travis was not a real person and was instead the accused’s alias, it was unclear what exactly happened during the times the accused testified to have met and spent time with Travis. Nevertheless, the important part of the accused’s testimony was that he had spent more than 16 hours (from 4am till past 8pm) driving around according to Hari’s instructions. The fact that he had spent time driving to and waiting at various locations on that day was corroborated by messages sent by him to Sherane from both TT-HP1 and TT-HP2. On TT-HP2, the accused had messaged Sherane at 8.21am on 27 September 2018, telling her “Im at msp now waitung ti load”.152Foot Note 152×P-CD3 at Annex E p 281 S/N 6443.This corroborated his account of having waited at Marina South Pier that morning.153Foot Note 153×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 18 lines 25–27; p 19 lines 20–21.On TT-HP1, the accused had told Sherane at 12.11pm that he was at “Msp”,154Foot Note 154×P-CD2 at Annex C p 6085 S/N 29512.which corroborated his evidence that he had returned to Marina South Pier sometime around noon.155Foot Note 155×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 24 line 31–p 25 line 1.Later that day, at 7.47pm, the accused messaged Sherane on TT-HP1 saying that he was “[l]oading still”.156Foot Note 156×P-CD2 at Annex C p 6089 S/N 29529.When asked by her “[w]hy so Long one?”,157Foot Note 157×P-CD2 at Annex C p 6089 S/N 29530.he replied “[f]rom mornihgntill night”, followed by “[h]aven even got shit”.158Foot Note 158×P-CD2 at Annex C p 6089 S/N 29531; p 6090 S/N 29535.This corroborated his account that he had spent much of the day waiting for protracted periods of time. 58 The accused further testified that, throughout the day, he did not even ask why he was being instructed to drive to the various locations and to wait at them.159Foot Note 159×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 13 lines 29–30; p 20 lines 8–9; p 23 lines 18–26.Only on one occasion – early in the morning at Anson Road – did he testify to having asked Hari what they were waiting there for.160Foot Note 160×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 17 line 3.However, when cross-examined on what Hari’s answer was, the accused stated that he could not remember.161Foot Note 161×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 17 lines 7, 11–12.In relation to the time spent waiting at the Lok Yang area, when cross-examined on what he thought he was waiting there for, the accused replied “I don’t know what [was] it all about”.162Foot Note 162×NEs (1 March 2022) at p 17 line 26. 59 The explanation the accused gave for going along with Hari’s instructions throughout the day was that he was already happy to have received 1.25g of free methamphetamine from Hari when they first met at Bedok.163Foot Note 163×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 13 lines 16–18; p 20 lines 11–15.He also added that he thought that by continuing to follow Hari’s instructions, he might receive additional drugs.164Foot Note 164×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 20 lines 28–31.He testified that he felt that day’s events had been “just like all the other times”, referring to other instances where he had performed favours for Hari,165Foot Note 165×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 29 line 7.and that he had decided to just “go along with it”166Foot Note 166×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 29 line 15.and “go with the flow”.167Foot Note 167×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 31 line 32.This was despite his admission that what he was asked to do that day had been different from the usual favours of ferrying Hari’s friends around and withdrawing money,168Foot Note 168×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 17 line 26–p 18 line 3; p 18 lines 12–14.as well as the fact that that session of doing favours for Hari had been by far the longest one yet.169Foot Note 169×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 23 line 15. 60 On the whole, I found it implausible that the accused had been willing to follow Hari’s instructions throughout the day, spending an inordinate amount of time driving in a circuitous sequence whilst waiting for many hours at various locations, simply because he was happy to have obtained 1.25g of free methamphetamine and because Hari might have given him additional free drugs. The enticement from the small amount of free drugs was far too low to justify the tiresome sequence of tasks the accused was asked to do that day. It was also particularly striking that the accused did not ask and was not told at any point why he was being asked to follow the instructions, and yet he continued to comply. This lack of questions from the accused did not comport with the image of a person who had no idea as to why he was being asked to perform these strange favours. 61 Rather, I accepted the Prosecution’s argument that in line with the narrative borne out by the messages in TT-HP1, which showed the accused negotiating for the sale and handover of drugs from Hari on 27 September 2018, the accused had followed Hari’s instructions throughout that day with a view to eventually taking possession of the Drugs at some point. Furthermore, the messages cited above at [57] from TT-HP1 to Sherane showed that the accused had known that he had been involved in “loading” throughout the day, since he told her in the morning “Im at msp now waitung ti load”170Foot Note 170×P-CD3 at Annex E p 281 S/N 6443.and later in the evening “[l]oading still”.171Foot Note 171×P-CD2 at Annex C p 6089 S/N 29529.When the accused was at the Lok Yang area,172Foot Note 172×ASOF at para 4.he had also messaged Sherane “[a]nything happen watch where [I] go”, followed a while later by “[d]ealing right now … heart thumping harder n faster”.173Foot Note 173×Exhibit P96 at p 74 S/Ns 412–413, p 78 S/N 466.All these messages showed that contrary to the accused’s account, he had been aware that the events that day were all related to the “loading” of drugs. 62 Thus, the more credible explanation for the accused’s actions on the day of arrest was not that he had innocently followed Hari’s instructions because he was happy to have received some free drugs and wanted to get more, but rather that he had followed Hari’s instructions in order to ultimately receive the Drugs. This reason – the prospect of receiving the Drugs at the end of the day – carried the necessary inducement for the accused to tolerate the tedious sequence of driving to and waiting at various locations.",
        "Hanis’ credibility": "63 The credibility of Hanis’ evidence was also an important issue in the present case. Hanis had accompanied the accused, on Hari’s instructions, to the Lok Yang area.174Foot Note 174×NEs (23 November 2021) at p 68 line 15–p 69 line 2.There, Hanis had met up with Hakam,175Foot Note 175×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 22 lines 13–18.and was later seated in the passenger seat of the accused’s vehicle when Hakam passed the red and black bundle to the accused through the window of the vehicle.176Foot Note 176×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 25 lines 10–19. 64 The Prosecution relied on several key parts of Hanis’ evidence. First, Hanis testified that his role in the transaction on 27 September 2018 had been to facilitate the accused’s collection of the Drugs on behalf of Hari.177Foot Note 177×NEs (23 November 2021) at p 66 lines 15–23; p 67 lines 20–21; p 68 lines 4–6.He also gave evidence that the accused had taken possession of the bundle when Hakam passed it to the accused through the vehicle window.178Foot Note 178×NEs (23 November 2021) at p 74 line 17–p 75 line 12.The Prosecution relied on these parts of Hanis’ evidence to show that the accused had in fact taken possession of the Drugs that evening.179Foot Note 179×PCS at paras 56 and 60. 65 Hanis’ evidence was also important for refuting the Defence’s case that Hari and the members of his group had intended to purchase the Drugs for themselves, and that Hanis was supposed to collect the Drugs on behalf of them.180Foot Note 180×DCS at para 43.In the first place, his evidence that he had acted as a middleman to facilitate the accused’s collection of the Drugs refuted the Defence’s contention that Hari and the members of his group had been the intended ultimate recipients of the Drugs. The Defence also cross-examined Hanis on the messages found on his handphone, “MHB-HP2” (which have been discussed above at [50]–[51]) and suggested to him that the messages supported the theory that Hanis was supposed to have taken possession of the Drugs that evening on behalf of his group. However, as observed above at [50] and [52], Hanis testified that the messages from Hari asking him not to disclose anything to the accused related to the concealment of Luffy’s identity, as opposed to the Defence’s submission that Hari was trying to keep the accused in the dark with respect to the drug transaction. Overall, he disagreed with the Defence’s theory that he, rather than the accused, was supposed to take possession of the Drugs.181Foot Note 181×NEs (24 November 2021) at p 76 line 30–p 77 line 2. 66 The Defence sought to discredit Hanis’ evidence, contending that Hanis had lied during the investigations regarding his involvement and that he would have wanted to avoid a capital charge.182Foot Note 182×DCS at para 44.The Defence put to Hanis, at trial, that in order to escape a capital charge for being the one in possession of the Drugs, he had to testify that the Drugs were meant for the accused and that he had merely been helping the accused to collect the Drugs.183Foot Note 183×NEs (25 November 2021) at p 41 lines 10–14.Hanis disagreed.184Foot Note 184×NEs (25 November 2021) at p 41 line 15. 67 I found Hanis to be a credible witness despite his involvement in the criminal activity and his attempts to downplay his role in the transaction, which included his repeated emphasis at trial that his role was that of a middleman only185Foot Note 185×NEs (23 November 2021) at p 66 line 20; NEs (24 November 2021) at p 8 lines 19–20; NEs (25 November 2021) at p 62 line 29.whose task had simply been to bring “somebody to meet somebody else”186Foot Note 186×NEs (24 November 2021) at p 8 lines 19–20.and who had “no involvement” in the planning of the drug transactions.187Foot Note 187×NEs (25 November 2021) at p 63 lines 2–6.Importantly, Hanis’ evidence relating to the events on 27 September 2018 and his role in the transaction was corroborated by the messages found on TT-HP1 and MHB-HP2. Hanis’ testimony cohered with the narrative borne out by these messages. First, the messages in MHB-HP2 showed that Hanis had indeed been asked by Hari to facilitate the accused’s collection of the Drugs. Hanis had messaged Hari the planned location of the transaction on 27 September 2018, saying “3 forth Lok Yang rd”.188Foot Note 188×AB at p 256 S/N 62.Referring to the accused, Hari had instructed Hanis to “[c]ollect money from him 8500”.189Foot Note 189×AB at p 256 S/N 67.This sum of $8,500 was consistent with messages in TT-HP1 in which the accused confirmed with Hari that the amount of cash he was to hand over to Hari was “8500”.190Foot Note 190×Exhibit P96 at p 18 S/N 336.These matching amounts showed that the accused had indeed been meant to pay Hari for the transaction that day, with the payment to be collected by Hanis. 68 Hari also informed Hanis of the vehicle which the accused drove, telling Hanis “[h]e drives a Volkswagen jetta”.191Foot Note 191×AB at p 256 S/N 68.When Hanis told Hari that he was already in the accused’s car, Hari replied “[h]e n u together go”,192Foot Note 192×AB at p 257 S/N 76.and reminded Hanis to “double check” the $8,500 that was to come from the accused.193Foot Note 193×AB at p 257 S/N 81.Hanis then attempted to confirm with Hari that all the Drugs were meant for the accused, asking “[o]kay then the goods to collect are all his/hers eh?”194Foot Note 194×AB at p 257 S/N 86.Hari replied “[s]o, it is just to bring him/her to meet that Laffy. Collect goods and take money eh”.195Foot Note 195×AB at p 258 S/N 87. 69 Thus, the exchange of messages between Hari and Hanis cohered with Hanis’ narrative rather than the Defence’s case theory. The messages indicated that Hanis had been instructed by Hari to facilitate the accused’s collection of the Drugs and collect the agreed amount of money from the accused. Nothing in the messages supported the accused’s narrative that Hanis was supposed to be the ultimate recipient of the Drugs (on behalf of Hari’s group), and that the accused had merely been involved as a driver. 70 The messages found on TT-HP1 also corroborated Hanis’ narrative. As observed above at [48], the accused had been the user of TT-HP1 at all times and had sent the messages on 25 and 27 September 2018 arranging the sale and handover of drugs from Hari. This was in line with Hanis’ evidence that the accused, not Hanis, was meant to collect the Drugs that day. 71 Thus, in light of the corroboration provided by the messages in both MHB-HP2 and TT-HP1, I found Hanis’ narrative relating to the transaction involving the Drugs to be credible. Hanis’ role was to facilitate the accused’s collection of the Drugs on 27 September 2018, and the accused was the ultimate recipient of the Drugs who was meant to and did take possession of the Drugs that day.",
        "The evidence of PW52 Arif and PW51 Hakam": "72 I turn to address the evidence of two witnesses, PW52 Arif and PW51 Hakam, who were called as rebuttal witnesses for the Prosecution towards the end of the trial. Both the Prosecution and the Defence claimed that these two individuals formed important parts of the other side’s case, with the Prosecution stating that it eventually called them as rebuttal witnesses largely so that the Defence would have the opportunity to cross-examine them.196Foot Note 196×PCS at para 84; NEs (12 January 2023) at p 15 lines 5–30. 73 The Defence submitted that Arif was in fact the person known to the accused as “Hari” who had supplied the accused with the Drugs.197Foot Note 197×DCS at paras 46–48.However, in cross-examination, Arif disagreed with the Defence that he was “Hari”.198Foot Note 198×NEs (27 September 2022) at p 31 lines 8–17.He also denied having ever known or met either the accused or Hanis.199Foot Note 199×NEs (27 September 2022) at p 22 line 28–p 23 line 4; p 28 lines 5–11; p 30 lines 13–21.The Defence argued that these denials showed that Arif did not want to tell the truth in court because he and his associates were in fact the ones who had ordered the Drugs, and therefore he had decided to deny their involvement and let the accused take the blame for the Drugs.200Foot Note 200×DCS at para 48. 74 I did not accept the Defence’s argument on this point. Arif’s evidence did not raise any reasonable doubt as to the Prosecution’s case. Essentially, he denied having any links to Hari, Hanis, or the accused. This could not be extrapolated to raise any reasonable doubt that contrary to the Prosecution’s case, he and his associates had in fact been the ones who had purchased the Drugs. Importantly, Arif’s denials did not affect the crucial evidence underpinning the Prosecution’s case, which centred on the messages found on the accused’s mobile phones rather than any evidence coming from Hari. 75 Similarly, Hakam’s evidence was of limited probative value and did not affect the Prosecution’s case – he mostly responded in cross-examination that he could not remember the details of what had happened during the handover of the Drugs.201Foot Note 201×NEs (27 September 2022) at p 13 line 26–p 16 line 9; p 18 lines 2–19.Thus, neither the evidence of Arif and Hakam nor the manner or lateness of their being called as witnesses raised any reasonable doubt as to the Prosecution’s case.",
        "Summary of common evidential issues": "76 The collective picture painted by the evidence discussed above showed that the accused had intended to take possession of the Drugs on 27 September 2018 and did in fact take possession of the Drugs. The messages in TT-HP1, which had all been sent by the accused, showed that the accused had negotiated for the sale and purchase of drugs from Hari, with the handover to have taken place on 27 September 2018. The accused’s actions on the day of arrest – following Hari’s instructions to various locations and waiting for long periods of time at these locations – were only plausible if he had been planning to take possession of the Drugs that day. Indeed, the messages to Sherane on TT-HP1 showed that the accused had known that the activities that day related to the “loading” of drugs. Furthermore, the messages in Hanis’ handphone, MHB-HP2, showed that Hari, Hanis and other members of Hari’s group had arranged for the collection of the Drugs by the accused on 27 September 2018. Finally, Hanis testified that the accused had in fact taken possession of the Drugs from Hakam at the Lok Yang area. 77 Taken together, the clear conclusion was that the accused’s negotiation with Hari on TT-HP1 had been for the sale and handover of the Drugs on 27 September 2018, and that he had intended to and had in fact taken possession of the Drugs at the Lok Yang area that day. 78 The Defence’s attempts to avoid this conclusion were incredible. I could not accept that the messages on TT-HP1 had been sent by Travis rather than the accused, as the evidence showed that the accused had been the sole user of TT-HP1, and Travis appeared to have been an alias which he used when conducting drug transactions. Neither could I accept the Defence’s narrative that the accused had merely been acting as a driver for Hanis and Hari and that Hari’s group had purchased the Drugs for themselves. The messages on MHB-HP2 relied upon by the Defence did not support this narrative and were instead consistent with the Prosecution’s case – corroborated by the messages in TT-HP1 – that Hari and the members of his group had been acting as the accused’s suppliers in the transaction. 79 The factual background established by these evidential threads informed and supported the analysis in the next section, relating to the legal elements of the offence.",
        "The elements of the charge": "",
        "The applicable law": "80 The charge under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA read as follows:202Foot Note 202×Arraigned Charge dated 17 September 2021 at p 1. That you, TRISTAN TAN YI RUI, on 27 September 2018 at about 9.01pm, at Blk 230J Tampines Street 21, Singapore, did traffic in a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”),to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking one red and black taped bundle which contained one ziplock packet containing not less than 499.0g of crystalline substance, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 337.6g of methamphetamine, without authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the MDA, and punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA, and further, upon your conviction under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the MDA, you may alternatively be liable to be punished under section 33B of the MDA. 81 The elements of an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA were laid out inMohammad Rizwan bin Akbar Husain v PP and another appeal and other matters[2014] 3 SLR 721 at [59] and are as follows: (a) possession of a controlled drug;(b) knowledge of the nature of the drug; and(c) possession of the drug for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised. 82 Several presumptions may apply in respect of the offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA. First, possession of a controlled drug may be presumed pursuant to s 18(1) of the MDA, which provides,inter alia, that any person who is proved to have had in his or her possession or custody or under his or her control anything containing a controlled drug is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have had that drug in his or her possession. 83 Second, knowledge of the nature of the drug may be presumed under s 18(2) of the MDA, which provides that any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his or her possession is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have known the nature of that drug. 84 Third, under s 17 of the MDA, any person who is proved to have had in his or her possession more than certain prescribed amounts of controlled drugs is presumed to have had the relevant drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved otherwise. Under s 17(h) of the MDA, the prescribed amount of methamphetamine which triggers this presumption is 25g. 85 The presumptions under s 18 of the MDA relating to possession and knowledge of the nature of the drug, and the presumption under s 17 of the MDA relating to trafficking, cannot run together:Zainal bin Hamad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2018] 2 SLR 1119 (“Zainal bin Hamad”) at [45]–[49]. The presumption under s 17 of the MDA only arises where a person isprovedto have had in their possession more than the specified amounts of certain drugs. Thus, where a person is presumed, rather than proved, to have possession and knowledge of the nature of the drug under s 18 of the MDA, the presumption of trafficking under s 17 cannot be relied on:Zainal bin Hamadat [47]–[49]. Hence, the Prosecution in the present case sought to prove the elements of possession and knowledge of the nature of the Drugs, whilst relying only on the presumption of possession for the purpose of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA.",
        "Whether possession of the Drugs was established": "86  Possession of drugs, as an ingredient of the offence of trafficking under the MDA, requires physical possession or custody over the drugs as well as knowledge of the existence of the thing which is later found to be a controlled drug:Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor[2019] 2 SLR 254 at [31] and [35]. 87 The accused’s possession of the Drugs was made out. This was established first by the evidence of Hanis that the accused had in fact taken possession of the bundle from Hakam, who had handed the bundle to the accused through the window of the accused’s car.203Foot Note 203×NEs (23 November 2021) at p 74 line 20–p 75 line 9.This was in line with, as observed earlier at [77], other evidence, such as the messages in TT-HP1 and MHB-HP2, as well as the accused’s actions on the day of arrest which indicated that he had intended to take possession of the Drugs at the Lok Yang area. 88 Second, the accused’s possession of the Drugs was also established by the presence of the accused’s DNA on the packet of powdery substance wrapped within the bundle.204Foot Note 204×ASOF at para 21; Exhibit P34 at Matchable Contributor “S150363” (DNA Profiling Report dated 23 November 2018) at p 4 (AB p 45).The Defence attempted to show that there could have been inadvertent transfers of the accused’s DNA to the packet. To this end, the Defence suggested several possible scenarios, including possible transference of the accused’s DNA from the surface of the car seat,205Foot Note 205×NEs (19 November 2021) at p 49 lines 1–16.or transfer of the accused’s DNA by means of a handshake or other physical contact with a person who then touched the packet.206Foot Note 206×NEs (19 November 2021) at p 47 lines 7–19; p 48 lines 4–9.However, these scenarios were wholly speculative and were to be juxtaposed against the clear evidence of Hanis, supported by the narrative borne out by the messages in TT-HP1 and MHB-HP2, that the accused had meant to and did take possession of the bundle and the packet. Thus, the Defence’s attempts to show the possibility of inadvertent transfers of the accused’s DNA did not raise any reasonable doubt as to the fact that the accused had handled the packet. 89 It was particularly incriminating that the accused’s DNA was found not on the exterior surface of the bundle, but rather on the packet which was within the bundle. A photograph of the bundle, “A1”, and the packet, “A1A”, is reproduced below:207Foot Note 207×Exhibit P-CD1, image 14.  Figure 1: Photograph of exhibits A1, A1A and A1B 90 The presence of the accused’s DNA on the packet, “A1A”, showed that the accused had not merely handled the bundle but had also handled the packet within the bundle. 91 The fact that the bundle and the packet had been in the vehicle where another person, namely Hanis, had been present, did not mean that actual possession was lost. Possession would only be called into question if there was some indication of possession being transferred to the other person in that context, such as an attempt at exclusion by the other person. There was no such indication that possession had been transferred to Hanis. In any event, given the evidence of Hanis, which was to be preferred, the accused, not Hanis, was supposed to take possession of the Drugs and the accused did so. 92 Another element of the charge was knowledge of the existence of the thing which was later found to be a controlled drug. The accused’s handling of the packet showed that he certainly had knowledge of the existence of the packet and the substance contained within it. As can be seen from fig 1, the packet itself was transparent and any person who handled it would thereby have been aware of the powdery substance in it, which was later found to contain methamphetamine. I was therefore satisfied that the accused had knowledge of the existence of the powdery substance within the packet, and therefore that his possession of the Drugs was established. 93 I observe that the Prosecution did not rely on s 21 of the MDA, under which any controlled drug found in any vehicle is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have been in the possession of the owner of the vehicle and of the person in charge of the vehicle for the time being. This was presumably due to the Prosecution’s decision to rely on the s 17 presumption of possession for the purpose of trafficking, which required them to prove possession and hence precluded them from relying on any presumption of possession under the MDA.",
        "Whether knowledge of the nature of the Drugs was established": "94 The accused’s knowledge of the nature of the Drugs was established by the messages found in TT-HP1 concerning the sale and handover of drugs on 27 September 2018. Whilst these messages did not specifically mention that the drugs to be handed over were methamphetamine, it was clear when viewed against the entire factual context that the messages were indeed about the sale of the Drugs specifically –ie,methamphetamine. For example, other messages on TT-HP1 showed that the accused had known that he would be collecting methamphetamine at the Lok Yang area. At 5.45pm on 27 September 2018, when Hanis had entered the accused’s car in Tampines but they had not left for Lok Yang yet,208Foot Note 208×Exhibit P96 at p 20 S/N 345–359.Hari messaged the accused on TT-HP1, saying “spare me 25 later can?? and price u give?”.209Foot Note 209×Exhibit P96 at p 20 S/N 346.The accused did not dispute that he had been using TT-HP1 at this point in time as, according to him, Travis had left TT-HP1 with him from 5.30pm onwards that day.210Foot Note 210×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 57 lines 16–25.In cross-examination, the accused confirmed that Hari’s message was referring to 25g of methamphetamine.211Foot Note 211×NEs (24 February 2022) at p 49 lines 14–22; NEs (24 February 2022) at p 64 line 31–p 65 line 1.Following that message, Hari then told the accused to pass this 25g of methamphetamine to Hanis.212Foot Note 212×Exhibit P96 at p 20 S/N 349.At 6.27pm, the accused replied Hari, quoting him $700 for that amount of methamphetamine and showing his appreciation to Hari for “hooking me up”.213Foot Note 213×Exhibit P96 at p 21 S/Ns 355–358.At trial, the accused denied that he had agreed to spare Hari the 25g of methamphetamine, saying that it was Travis who had told him to pass 25g to Hanis.214Foot Note 214×NEs (24 February 2022) at p 66 lines 22–23; p 67 line 13.However, since I have found that Travis was not a separate person, there was in fact no such person who had told the accused to pass 25g to Hanis. The accused was therefore the one who had agreed with Hari to pass 25g of methamphetamine to Hanis. In any case, the accused’s reliance on the fact that Travis had told him to pass the 25g of methamphetamine to Hanis did not detract from the fact that the messages showed that he had known that a package of methamphetamine was going to be handed over at Lok Yang. Coupled with the context which showed that the accused had negotiated with Hari for the handover of drugs at Lok Yang on 27 September 2018, the accused’s agreement in these messages (which had been sent just before he drove to Lok Yang) to spare Hari 25g of methamphetamine “later” confirmed that he had known that he would be receiving a package of methamphetamine specifically at the Lok Yang area that day, from which the 25g was to be derived. 95 Furthermore, other facts also showed that the accused had known the nature of the Drugs. The messages on TT-HP1 between the accused and Hari often discussed the sale of “white”,215Foot Note 215×For example, P-CD2 at Annex C p 2731 S/N 13133; p 2729 S/N 13122; p 2728 S/N 13117; p 2720 S/N 13076; p 2710 S/Ns 13026–13027.which was confirmed by the accused and PW45 ASP Zhong Kang Tai to refer to methamphetamine.216Foot Note 216×NEs (23 November 2021) at p 29 line 18; NEs (24 February 2022) at p 35 lines 16–18.Also, the messages between Hanis and Cico2 made clear that the transaction on 27 September 2018, which had been negotiated by the accused, was for “white” – at 4.33am on 27 September 2018, Hanis had asked Cico2 if the transaction that day was “for green or white”, to which Cico2 replied “[w]hite”.217Foot Note 217×Exhibit D4 at p 1 S/Ns 5–6.Finally, the accused had actually gone to the Lok Yang area on 27 September 2018, intending to take collection of drugs, and had knowingly taken possession of the packet of white crystalline substance. Thus, the factual context was as such: the accused had often discussed the sale of methamphetamine with Hari; the accused had negotiated for the purchase of drugs from Hari on 27 September 2018; Hanis’ messages confirmed that that transaction was for methamphetamine; and the accused had gone to the Lok Yang area and taken possession of what he knew to be a packet of white crystalline substance. In light of these facts, although the messages on TT-HP1 did not explicitly say that the drugs to be sold were methamphetamine, it was clear that the accused had known that the transaction he had negotiated with Hari was for the sale of the Drugs –ie, methamphetamine – specifically, as opposed to some other type of drugs. Indeed, the Defence did not dispute that the messages on TT-HP1 were about the sale and handover of the Drugs specifically.218Foot Note 218×DCS at para 21.Thus, the accused had actual knowledge that the nature of the Drugs he received at the Lok Yang area that day was methamphetamine.",
        "Whether possession of the Drugs was for the purpose of trafficking": "96 Given that the accused was in possession of not less than 337.6g of methamphetamine, the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA applied: Presumption concerning trafficking 17.Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than — … (h) 25 grammes of methamphetamine; … whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation or mixture, shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose. 97 In addition to relying on the presumption of trafficking above, the Prosecution argued that the sheer amount of methamphetamine involved – not less than 337.6g – indicated that the accused could not have taken possession of the Drugs for his own consumption.219Foot Note 219×PCS at para 73.The Prosecution further contended that the accused had intended to repack a 25g portion of the Drugs and traffic that amount to Hanis, who testified that the accused had told him to collect 25g of methamphetamine after the deal was completed.220Foot Note 220×PCS at para 74; NEs (23 November 2021) at p 77 lines 2–9.Lastly, the Prosecution argued that the accused’s admission to having sold small quantities of methamphetamine to his friends before,221Foot Note 221×PCS at paras 77–79; NEs (22 February 2022) at p 39 lines 18–26; NEs (23 February 2022) at p 4 lines 4–12.coupled with messages on TT-HP1 which showed that he had discussed fairly large quantities of methamphetamine with his friends,222Foot Note 222×PCS at paras 77–79; NEs (24 February 2022) at p 33 line 23–p 34 line 12.indicated that he had been actively engaged in trafficking activity. This supported a finding that he had possessed the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking. 98 The Defence argued, in line with its case theory, that the accused had not intended to purchase the Drugs and the Drugs had not been meant for him. Rather, Hari and the members of his group were the ones who had planned to purchase the Drugs, and the accused had merely acted as a driver for Hanis who had been tasked to collect the Drugs.223Foot Note 223×DCS at para 3.Thus, the accused did not possess the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking.224Foot Note 224×DCS at para 3. 99 In respect of the Prosecution’s arguments, I could not conclude that the quantity of the Drugs alone was actual proof of an intention on the part of the accused to traffic in the Drugs. Also, the repacking of the Drugs for a smaller portion to be passed on to Hanis did not indicate trafficking of the Drugs as a whole. The quantity to be repacked, 25g, was significantly smaller than the quantity in the accused’s possession. As observed earlier at [94], the messages on TT-HP1 indicated that the repacking of 25g of the Drugs, to be sold to Hari for $700, had been done as a favour from the accused to Hari for setting him up with the transaction. Thus, this arrangement to repack and sell 25g of the Drugs was a special one agreed to by the accused in view of Hari’s help, and could not be relied on to show that the rest of the Drugs would similarly be sold off by the accused. 100 The accused’s prior trafficking activity also could not be relied upon to prove that the accused had intended to traffic in the Drugs. In respect of this, the Prosecution referred to the accused’s testimony that he had sold small amounts of methamphetamine – less than 1g each time – to his friends.225Foot Note 225×NEs (23 February 2022) at p 4 lines 20–24; NEs (22 February 2022) at p 39 lines 24–26.The Prosecution also referenced messages on TT-HP1 in which the accused had discussed larger amounts of methamphetamine with his contacts.226Foot Note 226×PCS at para 78.For example, a conversation with Hari on 28 August 2018 discussed three quantities of methamphetamine – 25g, 12.5g, and 5g.227Foot Note 227×Exhibit P96 at p 26 S/N 6; NEs (24 February 2022) at p 33 line 23–p 34 line 1.In another conversation with Steph on 18 August 2018, the accused referred to 50g of methamphetamine.228Foot Note 228×Exhibit P96 at p 32 S/N 3, NEs (24 February 2022) at p 34 lines 2–9. 101 With respect to the messages with Hari and Steph, it was not clear whether they related to the accusedsellingthe quantities of methamphetamine referred to. Indeed, the Prosecution did not allege so, only going so far as to say that these messages had involved discussions about these various quantities of methamphetamine.229Foot Note 229×PCS at para 78.Such discussions which were not clearly about trafficking even in relation to those previous amounts of methamphetamine certainly could not be extrapolated to show that the accused had planned to traffic in the Drugs. 102 As for the accused’s admission that he had previously sold small amounts of methamphetamine to his friends, the Prosecution’s reliance on this piece of evidence appeared to contravene the rule against similar fact evidence. Whilst it is well-established in Singapore that there is no strict rule against the admission of similar fact evidence, with ss 14 and 15 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) permitting reliance on similar fact evidence where such evidence is used to demonstrate the state of mind of the accused (seeRosman bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor[2017] 1 SLR 10 at [32] andTan Meng Jee v Public Prosecutor[1996] 2 SLR(R) 178 (“Tan Meng Jee”) at [40]), a balancing process weighing the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect must be applied in determining whether similar fact evidence should be admitted under those provisions:Tan Meng Jeeat [50]. Three factors should be considered in this balancing process; namely, cogency, strength of inference and relevance:Tan Meng Jeeat [52]. 103 The cogency of the evidence here was not in question, since the source of the evidence was the accused’s own testimony. However, the strength of inference and the relevance of this evidence was doubtful: the accused’s evidence was that he had sold or given small amounts of methamphetamine to his friends, with these amounts having been derived from the usual packets of 1.25g of methamphetamine which Hari would have given or sold to him.230Foot Note 230×NEs (22 February 2022) at p 39 lines 5–26.This was quite different from the conduct which the Prosecution sought to prove –ie, that the accused had purchased the Drugs (which contained not less than 337.6g of methamphetamine) and intended to traffic the whole amount. Thus, the probative value of this evidence in showing the accused’s state of mind with respect to the Drugs was low. It did not follow, simply from the accused’s prior acts of selling to his friends small amounts of methamphetamine, which he had derived from the supply for his own consumption, that he had intended to traffic in the Drugs, which contained a quantity of methamphetamine several hundred times larger than the amounts he admitted to having previously sold. Thus, the probative value of this evidence was significantly outweighed by its prejudicial effect and could not be relied on by the Prosecution to show that the accused had possessed the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking. 104 However, the Defence failed to rebut the presumption of possession for the purpose of trafficking on the balance of probabilities. The Defence essentially relied on the argument that the accused had not intended to possess the Drugs in the first place and had not known that the bundle contained methamphetamine, even if Hakam had indeed passed the bundle to him.231Foot Note 231×DCS at paras 57–58.However, as observed earlier at [78], the Defence’s account that Hari and his group had purchased the Drugs for themselves, with the accused merely acting as a driver for Hanis, was incredible. Rather, the evidence showed that the accused had negotiated for the purchase of the Drugs from Hari and had intended to and had in fact taken possession of the Drugs at the Lok Yang area. In view of this finding, the Defence’s argument that the accused had not intended to possess the Drugs and had not known that the bundle contained methamphetamine could not stand. Thus, the Defence failed to rebut the presumption under s 17(h) of the MDA that the accused had possessed the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking. The result was that the presumption applied, and thus the element of possession for the purpose of trafficking was made out. 105 Overall, all three elements of the charge for trafficking in a controlled drug were made out. I therefore found the accused to be guilty of the charge and convicted him accordingly.",
        "Other matters": "106 The Prosecution submitted that the accused’s lies in his statements to the police corroborated his guilt. Specifically, the Prosecution contended that the accused’s lie in his statements that TT-HP1 had belonged to Travis232Foot Note 232×AB at p 182 para 10; p 188.satisfied the four criteria set out inPublic Prosecutor v Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi[2015] SGCA 33 (“Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi”) at [60] for what has been termed in case law as a “Lucaslie” –ie, alie which amounts to corroboration of guilt.233Foot Note 233×PCS at para 81.These criteria are as follows: (a) the lie told out of court is deliberate;(b) it relates to a material issue;(c) the motive for the lie is a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth; and(d) the statement must clearly be shown to be a lie by independent evidence. 107 These criteria appeared to be satisfied in relation to the accused’s lie in his statements that TT-HP1 had belonged to Travis. The lie told in his statements was deliberate and related to a material issue as the messages on TT-HP1 related to the arrangement of the sale and handover of drugs on 27 September 2018. These messages were highly incriminating and the accused’s creation of the person of “Travis”, who had allegedly owned TT-HP1, must have stemmed from the accused’s guilt and fear of the truth, which was that he was the owner of TT-HP1 who had in fact sent these messages. This truth was evident from the evidence analysed earlier. 108 Thus, the criteria inIlechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudifor a “Lucaslie” appeared to be satisfied in the present case. Nevertheless, great emphasis should not be placed on the corroborative effect of this lie. As was the case inPP v Lau Boon Huat[1997] SGHC 148 (at [53]), there was no special requirement for corroboration of the accused’s guilt in the present case and the evidence discussed above already established the accused’s guilt without any need for corroboration from the lies in his statements.",
        "Sentence": "109 The accused’s role in the transaction involving the Drugs was clearly not limited to that of a courier. Rather, the evidence showed that he had negotiated the purchase and handover of the Drugs. The PP also did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance to the accused.234Foot Note 234×NEs (9 February 2023) at p 6 lines 8–23, 31–p 7 lines 1–4.Thus, there was no room for the application of the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B(1)(a) read with s 33(2) of the MDA. Accordingly, pursuant to s 33(1) of the MDA read with the Second Schedule therein, which prescribes the death sentence where the offence of unauthorised trafficking in controlled drugs containing more than 250g of methamphetamine is made out, I sentenced the accused to death.",
        "Conclusion": "110 The Prosecution made out its case beyond any reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the charge for trafficking in a controlled drug, by having had in his possession for the purpose of trafficking a packet containing not less than 337.6g of methamphetamine. I therefore convicted the accused of the charge and sentenced him to death.
