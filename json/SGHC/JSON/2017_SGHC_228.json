        "Introduction": "1 The three accused persons in this case were tried jointly on charges of trafficking in diamorphine. The first accused person, Muhammad Farid bin Sudi (“Farid”), and the third accused person, Tika Pesik (“Tika”), each claimed trial to a single charge of trafficking in a controlled drug, namely 26.29g of diamorphine, in furtherance of their common intention, an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The second accused person, Hamzah bin Ibrahim (“Hamzah”), claimed trial to a charge of having the 26.29g of diamorphine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA. 2 The charges stated that Farid and Tika made arrangements between 19 and 20 December 2013 for Farid to deliver two packets of granular/powdery substance (which, on analysis, was found to contain 26.29g of diamorphine) to Hamzah on 20 December 2013, and that Farid did so on that day from about 1.40pm to 2 pm while he was in a car with Hamzah. 3 At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the elements of the respective charges were made out against each of the accused persons, and I convicted them accordingly. 4 The prescribed punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA, read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, is death. Section 33B(1)(a) provides that if the two requirements set out in s 33B(2) are satisfied, the court has a discretion not to impose the death penalty. The first requirement is that the acts of the accused were restricted to those listed in s 33B(2)(a)(i)–(iv) – acts which have been referred to as those of a “courier”. The second requirement, as stated in s 33B(2)(b), is that the Public Prosecutor (“PP”) certifies that the accused person has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. 5 I found that: (a) Farid met both requirements. His role in the transaction was to deliver the drugs to Hamzah. His packing of the drugs into a plastic bag was incidental to the delivery and he thus acted as no more than a courier. The PP issued a certificate of substantive assistance. Hence, I imposed the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane on him. (b) Hamzah only met the second requirement. He was issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the PP. However, it was clear to me that his purpose after taking delivery of the drugs was to sell them. His involvement in the transaction went beyond that of a courier. I passed the mandatory death sentence on him. (c) Tika met neither requirement. She had coordinated the supply of the drugs to Hamzah through Farid and another person and could not be said to have acted as a courier. Also, she was not issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the PP. Hence, I passed the mandatory sentence of death on her. 6 Hamzah and Tika have each filed an appeal against their conviction and sentence. I now provide the reasons for my decision.",
        "The undisputed facts": "7 I will first set out the undisputed facts.",
        "Arrest of the accused persons and seizure of the exhibits": "8 On 20 December 2013, at about 1.40pm, Farid drove a car bearing registration number SGM 8355Y (“the Car”) to Deck 5 of the multi-storey carpark at Block 632 Senja Road. He parked the Car near the walkway link on Deck 5. Hamzah walked from the walkway link towards the Car, boarded it, and sat in the front passenger seat.1Foot Note 1×PP’s Closing Submissions at para 8. 9 Farid drove the Car to Dairy Farm Crescent. At about 2pm, Farid stopped the Car along Dairy Farm Crescent, before Dairy Farm Road, and turned on the hazard lights. Hamzah alighted and crossed the road towards the rubbish collection point at Dairy Farm Crescent.2Foot Note 2×PP’s Closing Submissions at para 9. 10 When he was near the rubbish collection point, officers from the CNB moved in and arrested Hamzah. Farid, who was still in the driver’s seat of the Car, was also placed under arrest.3Foot Note 3×PP’s Closing Submissions at para 10. 11 Farid and Hamzah were escorted by CNB officers in two vehicles to Deck A2 of the multi-storey carpark at Block 217A Petir Road. Farid was in the Car, while Hamzah was in a CNB vehicle. At the carpark, the Car was searched in the presence of Farid and Hamzah.4Foot Note 4×PP’s Closing Submissions at para 11. 12 The CNB officers took a number of items from the Car as exhibits. The following are the significant exhibits:5Foot Note 5×PP’s Closing Submissions at para 12 (Exhibits can be found as attachment to P99). (a) A white plastic bag (bearing the logo “Giant”) containing a sheet of newspaper, one larger plastic packet of brown granular powdery substance (“A1A1”) and one small plastic packet of brown granular powdery substance (“A1A2”). The contents within the two packets formed the subject matter of the charges; (b) A white plastic bag containing both a packet of empty white plastic bags of the same type and three packets of empty zip lock bags. (c) A stack of Singapore dollar bills tied with a red rubber band, amounting to $1,800; (d) A white plastic bag (bearing the logo “FairPrice”) containing a stack of Singapore dollar bills tied with two red rubber bands, amounting to $4,510; (e) A sling bag containing a packet wrapped and taped with brown paper. The packet contained a plastic packet which itself contained 10 packets of granular/powdery substance. There was another white plastic bag, tied with a red rubber band, containing brown granular/powdery substance; (f) A “Davidoff” perfume box containing a plastic packet containing one packet of crystalline substance, two packets of brown granular/powdery substance and one packet of empty zip lock bags; (g) An improvised utensil; and (h) A digital weighing scale. 13 Also, certain personal possessions of Farid and Hamzah were seized, including Farid’s mobile phone (marked as “MF-HP”), and Hamzah’s two mobile phones (marked as “H-HP1” and “H-HP2”). 14 On 8 September 2014 at about 3.35pm, Tika was stopped at Woodlands Checkpoint when she attempted to enter Singapore as she had been placed on the “wanted persons” list. There were three other people in the car with her, K Saravanan A/L Kuppusamy (“Saravanan”), her husband Ahmad Hanafi bin Sudi and her son Muhammad Firdaus bin Ahmad Hanafi.6Foot Note 6×PP’s Closing Submissions at para 23.",
        "Analysis of exhibits by the Health Sciences Authority": "15 On 24 December 2013, A1A1 and A1A2 were submitted by the CNB to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.7Foot Note 7×PP’s Closing Submissions at para 17. 16 Exhibit A1A1 was analysed and found to contain not less than 18.28 g of diamorphine, which is a Class A controlled drug under the first Schedule to the MDA.8Foot Note 8×Agreed Bundle of Documents (“ABD”) p 253.Exhibit A1A2 was analysed and found to contain not less than 8.01 g of diamorphine.9Foot Note 9×ABD p 255.In total, exhibits A1A1 and A1A2 were found to contain not less than 26.29g of diamorphine, and formed the subject matter of the charges. 17 HSA’s analysis also revealed that Farid’s DNA was found on10Foot Note 10×PP’s Closing Submissions at para 21.the “Giant” plastic bag, the exterior of A1A2, the sling bag, some of the packets of brown granular/powdery substance inside the sling bag, the packet of crystalline substance inside the perfume box, the packets of brown granular/powder substance inside the perfume box, and the digital weighing scale. Hamzah’s DNA was found on the exterior surface of the digital weighing scale.11Foot Note 11×PP’s Closing Submissions at para 22.",
        "Statements of the accused persons": "18 Pursuant to s 258(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), the Prosecution tendered certain statements recorded from the accused persons in the course of investigations as part of its case. There were no objections from the accused persons as to their admissibility, although at [26]–[27] below, I set out how Hamzah vacillated on the admissibility of his statements. Also, I pause to add that while Farid and Hamzah did not dispute the contents of their statements (which implicated all three accused persons), Tika alleged that Farid and Hamzah had falsely implicated her in drug dealings. The significance of this allegation will be dealt with from [58] onwards.",
        "Statements made by Farid": "19 Eight statements were recorded from Farid, and all of them were admitted into evidence. These were: (a) The contemporaneous statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC recorded on 20 December 2013 at 3.07pm by Staff Sergeant Norizan binte Merabzul;12Foot Note 12×ABD p 336–341; pp 393–394. (b) The cautioned statement recorded under s 23 of the CPC on 21 December 2013 by Station Inspector Muhammed Nizammudin (“SI Nizamuddin”)13Foot Note 13×ABD pp 515–517.; (c) Five long statements recorded by SI Nizamuddin under s 22 of the CPC on 22 December 2013, 23 December 2013, 24 December 2013, 14 July 2014 and 27 August 2014. These were marked as “P98”, “P99”, “P100” , “P101” and “P102”; and (d) A long statement recorded on 9 September 2014 under s 22 of the CPC by Station Inspector Fathli bin Mohd Yusof (“SI Fathli”).14Foot Note 14×ABD pp 545–560. 20 In his contemporaneous statement, Farid said that the plastic bags and money found in the Car belonged to Hamzah. He said that the other plastic bags which contained “chocolate powder” had been taken in the morning at Woodlands from an “Indian person from Malaysia”.15Foot Note 15×ABD p 393.He described himself as a “drug sender” who would need to wait for a call to be told where to send the drugs. 21 In his cautioned statement, Farid said that he was “not willing to take the responsibility as the drugs [were] not [his]”16Foot Note 16×ABD p 517.. He added that “[t]hey just told me to send the drugs to the people who will call me”, although he did not identify who “they” referred to. 22 Of the five long statements, P98, P99, and P100 were significant in that they contained an extensive account of Farid’s involvement in the transaction for which he was arrested and similar previous transactions. According to these statements: (a) Farid was also known as “Boy”. He had come to know of a person named “Nana” when a friend of his, “Farid Botak” had called her using his mobile phone. That was also how Nana got his mobile number. Nana called him in August or September 2013 saying she was looking for Farid Botak who, according to her, had run away with “drug” money. Farid said he was looking for Farid Botak too. Nana gave him directions to Farid Botak’s house.17Foot Note 17×P98 at paras 5–12. (b) A few weeks later, Nana contacted him again. She offered him a job of picking parcels up in Singapore from Malaysians and sending them to people in Singapore.18Foot Note 18×P98 at para 13.He agreed. He did not ask what the parcels contained. (c) He first did a delivery for Nana in October 2013 using a car he had rented.19Foot Note 19×P98 at para 13.On this occasion, he collected a parcel from a Malaysian Indian man in Tuas. Nana called him to check that he had received the parcel. Someone then called him and asked him to send the parcel to Bukit Panjang.20Foot Note 20×P98 at para 14.That person turned out to be Hamzah, who was the recipient of Farid’s first delivery. Hamzah gave him a stack of cash and asked him to pass it to Nana, although Hamzah referred to her as “Ika”.21Foot Note 21×P98 at para 15.Farid then went back to the Tuas area and passed the money to a different male Malaysian. (d) Farid did three similar deliveries for Nana after that first time. The second delivery took place one week after the first job. The third delivery was in November. Farid claimed that he only knew that the parcels that he delivered for Nana contained drugs on this third time.22Foot Note 22×P99 at para 20.The fourth delivery was on 18 December 2013. (e) On the last two of these three later deliveries, Nana offered to pay for him to rent a car to do the delivery. The delivery on 18 December 2013 was done using a car he had rented. This was the Car that he was arrested in. (f) The fifth delivery was what formed the basis of the charge against him. Nana called him at about 11pm on 19 December 2013 and told him about a pick up at Woodlands at 5am the next day. At 1am on 20 December, an Indian male he referred to as “Macha”, who identified himself as Nana’s friend, called him from a Malaysian mobile number and said that he would go with him to Woodlands “to wait for the pick-up of the drugs”.23Foot Note 23×P99 at para 37.When Farid reached Woodlands, another male Malaysian gave him a sling bag and a plastic bag that had a brown packet. (g) Farid then called Nana to inform her he had “collected the drugs”. He then went to the void deck at Kang Ching Road. He called Nana and told her that the “drugs that were inside [his] bag were very messy” and he wanted to ask her which packets were meant for whom.24Foot Note 24×P99 at para 39; P100 at para 49.He then packed the drugs according to her instructions. In particular, he wrapped two packets of “panas” in newspaper and put it in the “Giant” plastic bag – these were A1A1 and A1A2. Nana told him that these two packets were for Hamzah.25Foot Note 25×P99 at para 41. (h) On the day he was arrested, that is, 20 December 2013, he received a call at 11am from Nana telling him to go to meet Hamzah. Later, Hamzah called him and asked to meet at the multi-storey carpark at Senja Road. When he entered the Car, Hamzah was carrying the white plastic bag (containing empty white plastic bags of the same type and three packets of empty zip lock bags) referred to at [12(b)] above. Hamzah took out the “Fairprice” plastic bag containing money (see [12(d)]) and placed it in the front compartment of the Car. Hamzah also took out a stack of dollar bills from his pocket (see [12(c)]) and asked Farid to count if there was $1,800 or $1,900.26Foot Note 26×P100, at para 42. (i) Hamzah asked him to drive out of the multi-storey carpark. As they made their way towards Dairy Farm Road, Hamzah took out A1A1 and A1A2 in the plastic bag and felt them in his hands.27Foot Note 27×P100 at para 52. (j) They reached Dairy Farm Road at close to 2pm. Hamzah asked him to stop the car, whereupon he alighted and, according to Farid, was “looking for a place to pack thepanasthat he [had] just collected…into smaller packets”. Hamzah asked Farid to wait for him.28Foot Note 28×P100 at para 54.At that point, Hamzah was arrested. 23 P101 recorded Farid’s query about the weight of the drugs in the charge he was facing, and his wish to be given a chance because he had cooperated with CNB in its investigations. 24 P102 recorded that Farid had been shown a photograph board of 12 female Malay subjects and he identified one of these females as the “Nana” or “Kakak” that he had referred to in the previous statements.29Foot Note 29×P102 at para 73.The person he identified was Tika. 25 In the last statement on 9 September 2014, it was stated that Farid had been shown photographs of 12 male Indians and that he identified one of them as the “Macha” he had referred to in the previous statements. “Macha” was Saravanan.30Foot Note 30×ABD pp 545, 549 and 560Farid recalled that sometime in September to October 2013, at Tuas, “Macha” had passed him a package kept in a plastic bag which Farid then “delivered to people”.31Foot Note 31×ABD pp 545.",
        "Statements made by Hamzah": "26 In total, seven statements were recorded from Hamzah. On 25 January 2017, being the second day of the trial, the Prosecution admitted six of these statements into evidence. At that point, counsel for Hamzah, Mr Luke Lee (“Mr Lee”) indicated that there was no challenge by Hamzah as to their admissibility.32Foot Note 32×Transcript (25 January 2017) at p 39, lines 29–30.However, on 9 February 2017, being the sixth day of the trial, Mr Lee informed the court that based on fresh instructions,33Foot Note 33×Transcript (9 February 2017) at p 1, line 8; p 8, line 14.Hamzah wished to dispute the voluntariness of the statements. To that end, Mr Lee applied to recall certain Prosecution witnesses pursuant to s 283(1) of the CPC. The Prosecution objected to the application, submitting that the power to recall a witness pursuant to s 283(1) of the CPC should only be exercised at the close of the case for the defence. As the Prosecution had yet to close its case, the application was premature. Instead, it was open to Hamzah, in his defence, to raise his objections, and then, if necessary thereafter, to apply to court to recall the relevant witnesses. 27 Section 283(1) of the CPC provides that a court may, “on the application of the prosecution or the defence, at the close of the case for the defence… recall and re-examine a person already examined.” I agreed with the Prosecution that the application was premature and that it was not the appropriate stage of the proceedings to apply to recall the Prosecution witnesses. I note that subsequently, when Hamzah gave evidence in his defence, Hamzah confirmed that he would not be challenging the admissibility of the statements. In fact, his evidence closely followed the contents of the statements. 28 I now turn to the six statements admitted into evidence which were: (a) A cautioned statement recorded under s 23 of the CPC on 21 December 2013 by SI Nizamuddin;34Foot Note 34×ABD pp 512–514. (b) Four long statements recorded by SI Nizamuddin under s 22 of the CPC on 25 December 2013, 26 December 2013, 14 July 2014 and 27 August 2014. These were marked as “P92”, “P93”, “P94” and “P95”; and (c) A long statement recorded on 9 September 2014 by SI Fathli (“P96”). 29 In his cautioned statement, Hamzah claimed that he did not know what was inside the Car, and that he only asked Farid to send him to Dairy Farm Crescent so he could apply for a job. He claimed he would have brought the drugs along with him if he had intended to traffic them.35Foot Note 35×ABD p 514. 30 The gist of P92 to P93 was as follows: (a) Hamzah had been selling heroin for “Farid Botak”. He would pay Farid Botak for a packet of heroin and repack them into straws which he would sell individually.36Foot Note 36×P92 at para 4.After some time he started to sell heroin by the packet.37Foot Note 37×P92 at para 5.Farid Botak also asked him to “jalan” his “barang” for him – this meant “sell” his “heroin”. He was to take heroin from Farid Botak, deliver it to people who ordered from Farid Botak, and then collect the money from them so as to pass it to Farid Botak. He knew that Farid Botak got his heroin from a woman named “Ika”.38Foot Note 38×P92 at para 6.He had seen Farid Botak with Ika in a car once before. (b) Hamzah referred to Farid as “Boy”.39Foot Note 39×P92 at para 6.At some point, Ika called him to ask if he wouldjalanheroin for her. He agreed. She said she would give him “setengah bola” (which was about 200g of heroin worth $2,400) on credit, and he could pay her back after he had sold it. Ika told him to collect the heroin from Boy. Hamzah collected the heroin from Boy, repacked it and resold it. He managed to sell that heroin in three days.40Foot Note 40×P92 at para 9. (c) After the first sale, Ika had confidence in him and started contacting him every few days to ask if he would take heroin from her. He would usually collect the heroin from Boy. He would usually ask Boy to drive to different places (usually in the Bukit Timah or Bukit Panjang area near his residence) where he could collect the heroin. He would usually pay Boy for “satu bola”, and sometimes he would take an additionalsetengah bolaon credit.41Foot Note 41×P92 at paras 10–12. (d) On 18 December 2013, Ika called him at night and asked if he wanted to “take heroin from her”.42Foot Note 42×P93 at para 18.He agreed. On the morning of 19 December 2013, he called Boy at 9am and asked him to come to the multi-storey car park at Bukit Panjang.43Foot Note 43×P93 at para 19.He paid Boy forsatu bolaof heroin. Boy then drove him to Punggol Place. He then repacked the heroin in a vacant house that he had the keys to. Boy went up to the house but just sat at a corner while he repacked thesatu bolainto smaller packets of heroin. He managed to sell off all those packets within that day – 19 December 2013.44Foot Note 44×P93 at paras 20–27. (e) That night, at about 7 pm, Ika called him to ask if he wanted to take heroin the next day.45Foot Note 45×P93 at para 29.He agreed and orderedsatu bolaof heroin from her. On 20 December 2013, he called Boy at about 8am to check if thesatu bolaof heroin was ready for collection.46Foot Note 46×P93 at para 30.It was ready. He thus asked Boy to go to the multi-storey carpark at Senja Road. He brought small plastic packets which he placed at the dustbin area while he waited for Boy to call him. Boy arrived and he went to meet Boy at the fifth storey of the multi-storey carpark, bringing with him the small plastic packets he had earlier left at the dustbin area. He got into the Car. Boy said he had “satu setengah bola” and asked if he wanted all of it. He said he wanted all of that heroin. However, he had only $4,500 even thoughsatu bolacost $4,750. He said he would pay Boy the remaining $250 for thesatu bolaand take the remainingsetengah bolaon credit.47Foot Note 47×P93 at para 31.This was not the first time had had been given more heroin than he had asked for from Ika, nor the first time he had taken the extra heroin on credit.48Foot Note 48×P93 at para 32. (f) When Boy and he reached Dairy Farm Road, he got off the Car and left thesatu setengah bolaof heroin near the handbrake of the Car. He also left the empty plastic packets (see [12(b)]) on the front passenger seat floor.49Foot Note 49×P93 at para 33. (g) He also said that the digital weighing scale (see [12(h)]) was what he had used to repack the heroin on 19 December 2013 at the house at Punggol Place. The weighing scale belonged to Boy and he had only wanted to borrow it from him.50Foot Note 50×P93 at para 34. 31 P94 recorded Hamzah as saying that he would be able to identify Ika if he was shown her photo51Foot Note 51×P94 at para 37.. Then, P95 recorded that Hamzah identified “Ika” from photographs shown to him.52Foot Note 52×P95 at para 38.That person was Tika.",
        "Statements made by Tika": "32 Seven statements were recorded from Tika. The Prosecution tendered only one statement, being the cautioned statement recorded under s 23 of the CPC on 10 September 2014 by SI Nizamuddin.53Foot Note 53×ABD pp 518–520.In it, Tika stated that she had nothing to say in response to the charge.",
        "Close of the Prosecution’s case": "33 At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I found that there was sufficient evidence against each of the accused persons and called upon them to give evidence in their own defence. Farid and Hamzah each gave evidence in their own defence and did not call any witnesses. Besides giving evidence in her own defence, Tika called Saravanan as a witness.",
        "The first accused’s defence": "34 Farid did not dispute the Prosecution’s case against him. His case was that in August or September 2013, he became acquainted with Tika. Sometime in October 2013, he was recruited by Tika to deliver drugs for her. In gist, Farid emphasised that he was but a courier who collected and delivered drugs on the instructions of Tika. In respect of the transaction which formed the subject matter of the charge against him, Farid gave an account of the events of 19 and 20 December 2013 which was consistent with the contents of the statements (see [22] above).",
        "The second accused’s defence": "35 Like Farid, Hamzah offered no substantive defence. Consistent with the contents of his statements as set out at [30] above, he recounted the events on 19 and 20 December 2013. He admitted to making arrangements with Tika to purchasesatubolaof heroin. When he collected the same from Farid, he agreed to purchase an additionalsetangah bolaon credit from Tika. He took delivery of the drugs from Farid while in the Car, during the drive from Senja Road to the junction of Dairy Farm Crescent and Dairy Farm Road. He knew that “A1A1” and “A1A2” contained heroin. At this juncture, I should add that it was not disputed by the parties that, in the Malay language, “satu bola”, “setengah bola”and “satu setengah bola” mean “one ball”, “half a ball” and “one-and-a-half balls” respectively.",
        "The third accused’s defence": "36 As for Tika, she denied any involvement in the transaction. Specifically, she denied having made any arrangements with Farid to deliver the drugs to Hamzah, or having made any arrangements to sell drugs to Hamzah. She claimed to have been “played out” by Saravanan, who was selling drugs, possibly to Farid. At the material time, she was in a relationship with Saravanan, and was staying in his house. Her explanation for the calls made by Farid to her mobile phone was that Saravanan would have had access to her mobile phone and might have used it to contact Farid. Also, it was her position that Farid and Hamzah had falsely implicated her.",
        "The law": "37 Section 5(1)(a) of the MDA provides: Trafficking in controlled drugs 5.—(1) Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore — (a) to traffic in a controlled drug; … (2)  For the purposes of this Act, a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking. By s 2 of the MDA, “traffic” is defined to include “sell”, “send”, “transport” and “deliver”. 38 Farid and Tika were charged with trafficking by delivering to Hamzah 26.29g of diamorphine pursuant to a common intention, an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA read with s 34 of the Penal Code. Section 34 of the Penal Code provides: Each of several persons liable for an act done by all, in like manner as if done by him alone 34.  When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. 39 It is instructive to refer to the Court of Appeal’s decision inMuhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters[2014] 3 SLR 721 (“Ridzuan”). That was a case which also involved two persons charged jointly for trafficking in diamorphine in furtherance of a common intention, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA as well as s 34 of the Penal Code. The Court of Appeal explained how s 5(1)(a) of the MDA interacts with s 34 of the Penal Code. (a) The purpose of s 34 is to impose constructive liability on a secondary offender in relation to an offence arising from a criminal act committed by the actual doer in furtherance of the common intention shared by both of them (at [27]). The actual doer in that case was convicted of trafficking in a controlled drug pursuant to s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA (at [28]). (b) Where the elements of s 34 are satisfied, constructive liability for the criminal act which constitutes an offence is imputed to the secondary offender. There is no need for the elements of that offence to be made out additionally against the secondary offender (at [29]).  Hence, in that case, there was strictly speaking no need for the elements of s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) to be made out against the secondary offender. (c) To impute liability to a secondary offender under s 34, three elements must be shown: the criminal act, the common intention and participation (at [34]). (d) The criminal act encompasses the aggregate of diverse acts done by the actual doer and secondary offender which collectively give rise to the offence that they have been charged with (at [35]). In that case, the criminal act encompassed the secondary offender’s arrangements to take delivery of the bundles of drugs and the actual doer’s collection of the drugs. (e) The common intention can form before or during the commission of an offence (at [41]). The existence of the common intention must frequently be inferred from the offenders’ conduct and all other relevant circumstances (at [42]). The common intention must include the intention to commit the very criminal act done by the actual doer; only then will the criminal act done by the actual doer be considered to have been done in furtherance of the common intention of the actual doer and the secondary offender (at [43]). In that case, the common intention of both the actual doer and secondary offender was to collect any number of bundles of heroin. This thus encompassed the very criminal act for which the actual doer was charged – possession of seven bundles of heroin for the purpose of trafficking (at [56]). In this regard, the Court also found that the secondary offender knew that the drugs being collected were heroin (at [52]). (f) The element of participation requires that the secondary offender participates in any of the diverse acts which altogether forms the unity of criminal behaviour resulting in the offence for which they are charged (at [36]). In that case, the element of participation was made out based on the secondary offender’s arranging for the collection of the bundles and relaying instructions to the actual doer to collect the bundles. 40 Here, Farid is the actual doer and Tika the secondary offender. Applying the propositions above, the Prosecution bore the burden of proving the following. (a) First, that Farid committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA. To make out this offence against Farid the Prosecution must prove theactus reusandmens rea: (a) trafficking, without authorisation, in a controlled drug, and (b) knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug. Knowledge of a controlled drug may either be proved or presumed by invoking the presumptions in s 18 of the MDA (which I will refer to below). (b) Next, to impute liability to Tika under s 34 of the Penal Code for the offence which arose from the criminal act committed by Farid, the Prosecution had to show three things. (c) First, that there was a criminal act committed by Farid and Tika. The “criminal act” here refers to the aggregate of diverse acts committed by Farid and Tika which collectively give rise to the offence they have been charged with. It would encompass the arrangements Farid and Tika made for Farid to collect the controlled drug and deliver it to Hamzah, and his actual act of delivery. (d) Second, that there was a common intention between Farid and Tika to commit the very criminal act done by Farid, namely trafficking in a controlled drug by delivering it to Hamzah, and that the criminal act committed by Farid was in furtherance of the common intention shared by him and Tika. (e) Third, that Tika participated in any of the diverse acts which constituted the act of trafficking for which she and Farid were charged. The Prosecution’s case, as particularised in the charge against her, is that she participated in the arrangements for the delivery. This was by (i) calling Farid to ask him to collect and deliver controlled drugs, (ii) receiving calls from him in which he confirmed he had received drugs, and in which she instructed him on packing the drugs, and (iii) calling him to tell him to meet Hamzah and pass the latter the controlled drugs. 41 Hamzah was charged with having in his possession, for the purpose of trafficking, 26.29g of diamorphine. This is an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA when read with s 5(2). The elements for a charge of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA are: (a) possession of a controlled drug, which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(1) or s 18(4) of the MDA; (b) knowledge of the nature of the drug, which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA; and (c) proof that possession of the drug was for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised (Ridzuanat [59]). 42 In relation to possession and knowledge generally, there are rebuttable presumptions in s 18 of the MDA: Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs 18.—(1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control — (a) anything containing a controlled drug; … shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession. (2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. (3)  The presumptions provided for in this section shall not be rebutted by proof that the accused never had physical possession of the controlled drug. (4)  Where one of 2 or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them.",
        "Decision on conviction": "43 I will first explain my decision to convict Farid and Tika before turning to my decision to convict Hamzah. In relation to Farid and Tika, there is a considerable overlap in evidence. It is convenient to start by considering the criminal act done by Farid and Tika and the common intention between them to do that act. I will then consider whether the elements of s 5(1)(a) of the MDA are made out against Farid, before considering whether liability could attach to Tika by s 34 of the Penal Code based on the three elements mentioned above (at [40(b)] to [40(e)] in light of her defence.",
        "Farid": "83 Having heard the parties’ submissions, I found on a balance of probabilities that Farid’s involvement in the offence was restricted to delivering the drugs to Hamzah. I accepted the submission of both the Prosecution and counsel for Farid that his packing of the drugs in a plastic bag pursuant to Tika’s instructions was incidental to the act of delivery. 84 The drugs in A1A1 and A1A2 had already been packed in that form when Farid collected them. He simply wrapped both these bundles in newspaper and put them in a plastic bag. I was conscious that the Court of Appeal had said, inProsecutor v Chum Tat Suan and another[2015] 1 SLR 834 (at [68]) that: Acts necessary for transporting, sending or delivering the drugs cannot include packing, for instance, as packing is not a necessary element of moving an object from one point to another. Simply put, a courier is someone who receives the drugs and transmits them in exactly the same form in which they were received without any alteration or adulteration. 85 However, the kind of packing contemplated by the Court of Appeal was someone who packs by “ensuring that the right type and quantity of drugs go into the right packaging”Public Prosecutor v Yogaras Poongavanam[2015] SGHC 193 (“Yogaras”) at [28]; it is the kind of packing that facilitates further distribution or sale. Hence, segregating the drugs into smaller packets is not the kind of “packing” that is incidental to delivery (see,eg,Public Prosecutor v Ranjit Singh Gill Menjeet Singh and another[2017] 3 SLR 66 at [63]–[64] andPublic Prosecutor v Zainudin bin Mohamed and another[2017] 3 SLR 317 at [57] and [99]), whereas the wrapping or camouflaging of bundles containing drugs is(Yogaras). 86 In this case, wrapping the two bundles A1A1 and A1A2 in newspaper was purely for the purpose of identifying that these were the bundles to be delivered to Hamzah. It was an act incidental to delivery. 87 The PP issued Farid with a certificate of substantive assistance. Accordingly, I imposed the mandatory alternative sentence of life imprisonment and the minimum 15 strokes of the cane on him.",
        "Tika": "90 As for Tika, the Prosecution submitted that she was not a courier because she had directed the entire transaction and had gotten Farid to deliver drugs on her behalf to her customer Hamzah. She had instructed Farid on how to sort the drugs and to whom they were to be delivered.110Foot Note 110×Transcript (15 June 2017) at p 7, lines 20–25.Counsel for Tika did not submit that her role was that of a courier. 91 It was clear that Tika could not in any way be described as a “courier”. She had coordinated the supply of the drugs to Hamzah to Farid through the Malaysian from whom Farid had collected the drugs at Woodlands. Moreover, the PP did not issue Tika with a certificate of substantive assistance.111Foot Note 111×Transcript (15 June 2017) at p 12, lines 17–23.Accordingly, I imposed the mandatory sentence of death on her. Hoo Sheau PengJudicial Commissioner Wong Woon Kwong and Sarah Shi (Attorney-General’s Chambers)for the Public Prosecutor;Mahmood Gaznavi s/o Bashir Muhammad (Mahmood Gaznavi & Partners) and Mahadevan Lukshumayeh (ST Chelvan & Company)for the first accused; Luke Lee Yoon Tet (Luke Lee & Co) and Sukdave Singh s/o Banta Singh (Winchester Law LLC) for the second accused; Mohamed Niroze Idroos and Mohamed Baiross (IRB Law LLP) for the third accused.",
        "Hamzah": "88 The Prosecution submitted that Hamzah was not a courier because he received the drugs with the intention to repack them into smaller packets and sell them to his customers.107Foot Note 107×Transcript (15 June 2017) at p 7, lines 18–20.Mr Lee, in written closing submissions, argued that Hamzah’s role was limited to that of a courier108Foot Note 108×D2’s Closing Submissions at para 8.but conceded in oral submissions that such a submission would, in light of all the evidence, be unsustainable.109Foot Note 109×Transcript (15 June 2017) at p 10, line 11. 89 It was evident that Hamzah’s purpose after taking delivery of the drugs was to sell the drugs. He had brought along smaller empty plastic packets for the purpose of repacking the drugs and then selling them subsequently. His role therefore went beyond that of a courier. Hence, although the PP issued a certificate of substantive assistance, the alternative sentencing regime was not available. Thus, I passed the mandatory sentence of death on Hamzah.",
        "Decision on sentence": "80 I now turn to my decision on sentence. The prescribed punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA, read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, is death. But there is an alternative sentencing regime in s 33B of the MDA allowing the court the discretion to impose a mandatory term of imprisonment for life and 15 strokes of the cane. 81 The relevant provisions read: Discretion of court not to impose sentence of death in certain circumstances 33B.—(1) Where a person commits or attempts to commit an offence under section 5(1) or 7, being an offence punishable with death under the sixth column of the Second Schedule, and he is convicted thereof, the court — (a) may, if the person satisfies the requirements of subsection (2), instead of imposing the death penalty, sentence the person to imprisonment for life and, if the person is sentenced to life imprisonment, he shall also be sentenced to caning of not less than 15 strokes … (2) The requirements referred to in subsection (1)(a) are as follows: (a) the person convicted proves, on a balance of probabilities, that his involvement in the offence under section 5(1) or 7 was restricted — (i) to transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug; (ii) to offering to transport, send or deliver a controlled drug; (iii) to doing or offering to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of his transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug; or (iv) to any combination of activities in sub‑paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii); and (b) the Public Prosecutor certifies to any court that, in his determination, the person has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. 82 For a court to have the discretion to impose the alternative sentence, an offender must show that his acts fell within s 33B(2)(a)(i)–(iv) of the MDA and must also receive a certificate of substantive assistance from the PP. The decision to give or withhold such a certificate is at the sole discretion of the PP: s 18(4) of the MDA."
