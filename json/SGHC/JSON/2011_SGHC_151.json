        "Introduction": "1       This was an application by the plaintiff for an\n                    interim payment of $80,000 from the first defendant pursuant to O 29\n                    r 10 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)\n                    (“the Rules of Court”). I granted the plaintiff’s\n                    application, and, given the novelty of some of the issues involved, I now\n                    provide the grounds of my decision. 2       Under O 29 r 11(1) of the Rules of\n                    Court, the court has the power to make an order for interim payment, but this\n                    power is curtailed in the circumstances provided for in O 29 r 11(2).\n                    For convenience, the relevant provisions of O 29 r 11 are as\n                    follows: Order for interim payment in respect of damages (O. 29,\n                            r. 11) 11.—(1) If, on the\n                        hearing of an application under Rule 10 in an action for damages, the Court\n                        is satisfied — … (b) that the plaintiff has obtained\n                            judgment against the defendant for damages to be assessed;\n                            … … the Court may, if it thinks fit and subject to paragraph (2), order the\n                        defendant to make an interim payment of such amount as it thinks just, not\n                        exceeding a reasonable proportion of the damages which in the opinion of the\n                        Court are likely to be recovered by the plaintiff after taking into account\n                        any relevant contributory negligence and any set-off, cross-claim or\n                        counterclaim on which the defendant may be entitled to rely. (2) No order shall be made under paragraph (1) in an action\n                        for personal injuries if it appears to the Court that the defendant is not a\n                        person falling within one of the following categories: (a) a person who is insured in respect\n                            of the plaintiff’s claim; or (b) a person whose means and resources\n                            are such as to enable him to make the interim payment. 3       It was not disputed that O 29\n                        r 11(1)(b) of the Rules of Court was\n                    satisfied, since the plaintiff had obtained interlocutory judgment against the\n                    first defendant (see[9]below). Instead, the\n                    dispute was essentially as to O 29 r 11(2),ie, whether the first defendant was “a person who is\n                    insured in respect of the plaintiff’s claim” or “a person\n                    whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make the interim\n                    payment”. Due to the somewhat awkward phrasing of O 29 r 11(2),\n                    I should clarify that in these grounds, when I refer to either limb of O 29\n                    r 11(2) “applying” or being “satisfied”, I mean\n                    that an interim payment cannot be ordered,ie, the\n                    defendant isnot, for instance, a person who is\n                    insured in respect of the plaintiff’s claim.",
        "Background": "",
        "Suit 74 of 2010": "4       On 15 October 2008, at about 3.03am, while\n                    riding his motorcycle along the Pan Island Expressway, the plaintiff was\n                    involved in a serious road accident when a motor car (“SGT 6356X”)\n                    driven by the first defendant collided into him. As a result of the accident,\n                    the plaintiff suffered serious injuries which necessitated the amputation of a\n                    portion of his left leg. 5       The first defendant was not in fact the owner of\n                    SGT 6356X. That person was his sister, Lua Bee Leng Sally (“Sally\n                    Lua”), who had been issued a comprehensive motor insurance policy\n                    (“the Policy”) by M/s Allianz Insurance Company of Singapore Pte\n                    Ltd ( “Allianz” or the “second defendant”, depending\n                    on the capacity in which it acted). As required by the Motor Vehicles\n                    (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed)\n                    (“the Act”), the Policy provided insurance coverage to Sally Lua\n                    and other authorised drivers of SGT 6356X in respect of,inter alia, third party risks. It should be said that the first\n                    defendant was driving SGT 6356X with the authority of Sally Lua, and would,prima facieat least, therefore have been\n                    insured under the Policy. 6       Subsequently, in respect of the accident, the\n                    first defendant was charged with, and on 13 August 2010 convicted of,inter alia, an offence of driving while under\n                    the influence of drink under s 67(1)(b) of\n                    the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed). 7       The plaintiff then commenced the present suit\n                    against the first defendant, who, as is common in these types of cases, was\n                    initially represented by M/s Global Law Alliance LLC (“Global\n                    Law”), the solicitors for Allianz. On 25 June 2010, however, Global\n                    Law wrote to the first defendant, stating that Allianz repudiated liability\n                    under the Policy to indemnify him against the plaintiff’s claim, on\n                    account of the fact that the first defendant had been driving while under the\n                    influence of alcohol. Allianz’s purported repudiation of liability under\n                    the Policy was pursuant to cl 5.3, which provided: 5.3When are you not insured? You are not insured under any part of this Policy: a)    if Your Car is being\n                            driven by a person … iv)    who has more than the legal limit of any\n                                alcohol in his blood or breath … 8       Once Allianz purported to repudiate liability\n                    under the Policy, Global Law was no longer in a position to act for the first\n                    defendant, and, accordingly, on 26 October 2010 the first defendant engaged\n                    M/s KhattarWong to represent him. Immediately thereafter, on 27 October\n                    2010, Allianz applied to be joined as the second defendant, represented by\n                    Global Law, which application was granted on 24 November 2010. However, at\n                    all points in these proceedings, no direct claim was being made by the plaintiff\n                    against the second defendant. 9       On 11 January 2011, the trial was heard by\n                    Andrew Ang J, and interlocutory judgment was entered in favour of the\n                    plaintiff against the first defendant only, with costs and damages reserved to\n                    the Registrar.",
        "Summons 1368 of 2011: first hearing": "10     That was the background against which the\n                    parties appeared before me on 11 May 2011 in respect of the plaintiff’s\n                    application for interim payment. It was quite clear that O 29\n                        r 11(1)(b) of the Rules of Court was\n                    satisfied (see[3]above), and so the\n                    remaining question was whether O 29 r 11(2) precluded me from\n                    entertaining the plaintiff’s application. 11     Counsel for the second defendant, Mr Niru\n                    Pillai, was unfortunately scheduled to attend another hearing, and therefore was\n                    only able to briefly set out the second defendant’s position. This was to\n                    the effect that the second defendant did not consider itself to be in a position\n                    to consent or object to the application, because it had repudiated liabilityvis-à-visthe first defendant, and its\n                    statutory obligation under s 9 of the Act to satisfy a judgment obtained by\n                    the plaintiff was only triggered when the plaintiff obtained afinaljudgment. Mr Pillai thereafter left it to the\n                    first defendant to deal with the plaintiff’s application. 12     Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr N\n                    Srinivasan, clarified that interim payment was only being sought against the\n                    first defendant and not the second defendant. Mr Srinivasan’s\n                    submission in support of the application was essentially that, notwithstanding\n                    that the second defendant had purported to repudiate its liability under the\n                    Policy, nonetheless the first defendant was still “a person who is\n                    insured in respect of the plaintiff’s claim”, and therefore\n                    O 29 r 11(2)(a) of the Rules of Court\n                    did not apply. For this proposition Mr Srinivasan relied onDu Zhao Di (suing as Committee of the Person and Estate of Jiang\n                        Hui Ping) v Lee Chee Yian (Mayban General Assurance, intervener)[2007] SGHC 88 (“Du Zhao\n                    Di”), which he submitted was on all fours with the present\n                    case, save that inDu Zhao Diinterlocutory\n                    judgment had not been obtained. 13     Counsel for the first defendant,\n                    Mr Patrick Yeo, objected to the plaintiff’s application. He allied\n                    himself with the second defendant’s position and argued that, since the\n                    second defendant had repudiated liability under the Policy, and given that the\n                    second defendant was not obliged under the Act to satisfy interlocutory\n                    judgments, the second defendant was therefore not obliged to meet any order of\n                    interim payment. According to the English Court of Appeal inO’Driscoll v Sleigh and another(unreported,\n                    20 November 1984) (“O’Driscoll”), cited with approval inDu Zhao Di, the test under O 29 r 11(2)(a) was whether the insurer would be obliged to meet any\n                    interim award. Since the second defendant was not so obliged, Mr Yeo\n                    submitted, the first defendant was not “a person who is insured in\n                    respect of the plaintiff’s claim” and therefore O 29\n                        r 11(2)(a) applied, making it\n                    impermissible for me to make an order for interim payment. 14     There was also some argument as to O 29\n                        r 11(2)(b),ie, whether the first defendant was “a person whose means\n                    and resources are such as to enable him to make the interim payment”.\n                    Mr Srinivasan argued that since the first defendant had been able to retain\n                    KhattarWong throughout these proceedings (as well as proceedings in the\n                    Subordinate Courts in respect of his criminal charges), O 29\n                        r 11(2)(b) did not apply, while\n                    Mr Yeo’s response was that no affidavit evidence had been produced by\n                    the plaintiff as to the first defendant’s means and\n                resources. 15     As I required some time to consider\n                    parties’ arguments, as well as the applicability ofDu\n                        Zhao Di, I reserved my judgment.",
        "Summons 1368 of 2011: second hearing": "16     After considering the matter, however, I was\n                    concerned that certain points had not been fully addressed during the hearing,\n                    and I therefore invited parties to clarify the following: (a)The authorities on which the second defendant\n                            claimed to take the position that, under s 9 of the Act, it was\n                            only obliged to satisfy final and not interlocutory\n                        judgments;(b)The burden of proof under O 29 r 11(2)\n                            of the Rules of Court;(c)Evidence as to the means and resources of the\n                            first defendant for the purposes of O 29 r 11(2)(b); and(d)Whether, if interim payment was ordered, it could\n                            be paid to the plaintiff personally, or whether it had to be paid to the\n                            Public Trustee pursuant to s 9 of the Act.17     Parties appeared before me again on\n                    13 June 2011, and, after hearing arguments from counsel for all parties on\n                    the above points, I granted the plaintiff’s application.Issues18     The issues which arose for my consideration,\n                    therefore, were as follows:(a)     Whether, notwithstanding that the\n                        second defendant had purported to repudiate its liability under the Policy,\n                        the first defendant was nonetheless “a person who is insured in\n                        respect of the plaintiff’s claims” within the meaning of\n                        O 29 r 11(2)(a) of the Rules of\n                        Court; and(b)     Who\n                        bore the burden of proving whether the first defendant was “a person\n                        whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make the interim\n                        payment” within the meaning of O 29 r 11(2)(b), and whether that burden had been\n                        discharged;(c)     Whether, if neither O 29 r 11(2)(a)\n                        nor O 29 r 11(2)(b) was applicable,\n                        I ought to exercise my discretion to order interim payment, and if so the\n                        amount of interim payment to be granted; and(d)     Whether, if interim payment was ordered, it\n                        could be paid to the plaintiff personally, or whether, under s 9 of the\n                        Act, it had to be paid to the Public Trustee.O 29 r 11(2)(a) of the Rules of Court20     I should say that, unlike the second issue\n                    under O 29 r 11(2)(b) of the Rules of\n                    Court (see[47]below), no question of\n                    burden of proof arose under O 29 r 11(2)(a), because, as Mr Srinivasan rightly pointed out, the\n                    parties being agreed on all material facts, the only questions were questions of\n                    law,viz, the meaning of the phrase “a\n                    person who is insured in respect of the plaintiff’s claim” and\n                    whether the agreed facts fell within O 29 r 11(2)(a) as properly construed. Although this question was ostensibly\n                    one of construction of O 29 r 11(2)(a),\n                    that task was made more difficult due to the fact that the scheme of compulsory\n                    third party motor insurance under the Act had to be taken into account, because\n                    whether or not the first defendant was “insured in respect of the\n                    plaintiff’s claim” depended very much on some of the provisions of\n                    the Act.The Act21     The Act originally derived from the UK’s\n                    Road Traffic Act 1930 (c 43) (UK) (“the RTA 1930”) and its\n                    many iterations, the most material for present purposes being the Road Traffic\n                    Act 1934 (c 50) (UK) (“the RTA 1934”), Road Traffic Act 1972\n                    (c 20) (UK) (“the RTA 1972”) and Road Traffic Act 1988\n                    (c 52) (UK) (“the RTA 1988”). The Act was introduced to\n                    ensure that innocent victims of road accidents (“third parties”)\n                    would be adequately protected in the event of fatality or bodily injury. As Tan\n                    Lee Meng,Insurance Law in Singapore(Butterworths\n                    Asia, 2nded, 1997) explains at p 573:The [Act], which is intended to safeguard the legal rights of third\n                        parties who have been injured or killed by persons who use motor vehicles on\n                        the road, establishes a system for compulsory motor insurance in Singapore\n                        with regard to third party liability. It requires a motor insurer to meet\n                        the insured’s obligations to a third party… in the event that\n                        the insured does not do so.22     Some salient features of the Act should be\n                    mentioned. Under s 3 of the Act, all users of motor vehicles must be issued\n                    an insurance policy which insures the user and other authorised drivers against\n                    third party risks, in particular, liability incurred by the user in respect of\n                    the death or bodily injury of any person as a result of the use of the motor\n                    vehicle (see s 4(1)(b) of the Act). The\n                    insured person must also be issued a certificate of insurance under s 4(9)\n                    of the Act. Once those requirements have been complied with, the Act’s\n                    object is then to see that any third parties who are the victims of road\n                    accidents will generally receive the compensation they are entitled to, and it\n                    achieves this by,inter alia, statutorily removing\n                    some of the insurer’s freedom to contract out of its liabilities to the\n                    insured person. Under ss 7 and 8 of the Act, for instance, the third\n                    party’s position has been considerably strengthened by legislative\n                    intervention, because where these sections apply, certain attempts by the\n                    insurer to restrict or exclude its liability under the insurance policy to\n                    indemnify the insured person are rendered ineffective, and the insurer will be\n                    contractually obliged to indemnify the insured person under the insurance policy\n                    in respect of the third party’s claim against the insured person for\n                    damages, which sums the insurer may be able to recover from the insured person\n                    (as of right in the case of s 8 of the Act, but only if the insurance\n                    policy so provides in the case of s 7). As I will be referring to ss 7\n                    and 8 later in these grounds, it will be useful to set out exactly what they\n                    provide:Certain conditions in policies or securities to be of\n                            no effect7.—(1) Any condition in a policy or\n                        security issued or given for the purposes of this Act providing that no\n                        liability shall arise under the policy or security or that any liability so\n                        arising shall cease in the event of some specified thing being done or\n                        omitted to be done after the happening of the event giving rise to a claim\n                        under the policy or security shall be of no effect in connection with such\n                        claims as are mentioned in section 4 (1) (b)\n                            [ie, claims in respect of death or bodily\n                        injury by third parties].(2) Nothing in this section shall be taken to render void any provision in\n                        a policy or security requiring the person insured or secured to repay to the\n                        insurer or the giver of the security any sums which the latter may have\n                        become liable to pay under the policy or security and which have been\n                        applied to the satisfaction of the claims of third parties.Avoidance of restrictions on scope of policies covering\n                            third-party risks8.—(1) Where a\n                        certificate of insurance has been issued under section 4 (9) to the person\n                        by whom a policy has been effected, so much of the policy as purports to\n                        restrict the insurance of the persons insured thereby by reference to any of\n                        the following matters:(a) the age or physical or mental\n                            condition of persons driving the vehicle;(b) the condition of the vehicle;(c) the number of persons that the\n                            vehicle carries;(d) the weight or physical\n                            characteristics of the goods that the vehicle carries;(e) the times at which or the areas\n                            within which the vehicle is used;(f) the horse-power or value of the\n                            vehicle;(g) the carrying on the vehicle of any\n                            particular apparatus;

……23     It was apparent, therefore, that simply\n                    because the second defendant had purported to repudiate its liability to\n                    indemnify the first defendant under the Policy in respect of the\n                    plaintiff’s claim, it did not follow that the first defendant was not\n                    therefore “insured”: it might have been that, as a matter of law,\n                    such repudiation was ineffective due to one of the provisions of the Act, as was\n                    held to be the case inDu Zhao Di.Du Zhao Di24     The facts ofDu Zhao\n                        Di, as Mr Srinivasan noted, were materially similar to those\n                    in the present case. The plaintiff and defendant were involved in an accident\n                    when the defendant opened the door of his car and the plaintiff, while riding a\n                    bicycle, collided into the open door. The plaintiff sued the defendant seeking\n                    substantial damages. The defendant was initially represented by lawyers acting\n                    for the intervener, Mayban General Assurance Berhad, who had issued a third\n                    party motor vehicle insurance policy to the defendant. However, as a result of\n                    the defendant’s non-cooperation in the preparation of the defence, the\n                    intervener purportedly repudiated liability on the insurance policy. The matter\n                    then came before the learned assistant registrar (“AR”)\n                    Mr Mohamed Faizal on the plaintiff’s application for an interim\n                    payment. One of the grounds on which the intervener opposed the application was\n                    that, given that it had repudiated liability to the defendant under the\n                    insurance policy, the defendant was not “insured in respect of the\n                    plaintiff’s claim” within the meaning of O 29\n                        r 11(2)(a).25     The learned AR rejected this argument. He held\n                    that the intervener’s repudiation of liability under the insurance policy\n                    would not affect the plaintiff for the following reasons:33    … Insofar as the [plaintiff] was concerned,\n                            such a breach of the insurance contract on the part of the defendant\n                            that would afford repudiation can only operateinter\n                                partesand notomni partes.\n                            Put another way, there was no doubt that, so far as the [plaintiff] was\n                            concerned, the [defendant] was covered by a valid policy of insurance,\n                            for it is conventional wisdom that “conditions precedent to\n                            liability and conditions subsequent to avoiding liability cannot be used\n                            in respect of claims by a third party in respect of injury or death\n                            which has been caused by the injured tortfeasor”: see Goh-Low\n                            Soen Yinet al, “Insurance\n                            Law”,Articles on Singapore Law(24, 2005). For that reason, if, in fact, the term does attempt to\n                            impinge upon the rights of third parties (such as the [plaintiff] here),\n                            it must necessarily be held to be void (at leastvis-à-visthe third party), forsuch\n                                a term would be the quintessential form of term that would fall foul\n                                of s 7(1) of the Act…34    Therefore… I was of the view that the\n                            [intervener] would, by virtue of the above reasoning, be treated, so far\n                            as the [plaintiff] was concerned, as insurers with a duty to indemnify\n                            the defendant in respect of the claim. No reliance can be had to the\n                            purported repudiation for the purposes of any action that had been\n                            commenced by a third party, since such third party could not, in law, be\n                            burdened by the ramifications of such a term that may otherwise be\n                            binding on the partiesinter partes. As\n                            such,it was not open for the [intervener] to argue\n                                that there had been repudiation since such repudiation was\n                                predicated upon the efficacy of a term that had no effectvis-à-visthe [plaintiff].[emphasis added in bold]The learned AR’s reasoning in these passages could be summarised\n                    as follows. The intervener’s purported repudiation of its liability under\n                    the insurance policy to indemnify the defendant in respect of the\n                    plaintiff’s claim was of no effect as far as the plaintiff was concerned,\n                    because it fell foul of s 7(1) of the Act (see[22]above). Therefore, by operation of s 7(1), the\n                    intervener was still contractually obliged to indemnify the defendant under the\n                    insurance policy in respect of the plaintiff’s claim. As a result, the\n                    defendant was to be considered “insured in respect of the\n                    plaintiff’s claim” under O 29 r 11(2)(a) of the Rules of Court, and an interim payment could be (and\n                    was) ordered.O’Driscoll26     At [35] ofDu Zhao Di, the learned AR\n                    found support for his approach in the English case ofO’Driscoll, where the plaintiff was a passenger in a bus\n                    and was injured when the bus braked suddenly, as a result of the first\n                    defendant’s motor car losing a wheel and skidding across the road. The\n                    first defendant was covered by a policy of motor insurance, which on the face of\n                    it covered his potential liability to the plaintiff in respect of the accident.\n                    However, as inDu Zhao Diand the present case,\n                    his insurers purported to repudiate their liability to him under the policy, on\n                    the basis of certain clauses to the effect that the insurers would be relieved\n                    of liability if the first defendant’s vehicle was defective or if he\n                    failed to give notice of the accident to them within a specified time. The\n                    question for the Court of Appeal, therefore, was whether the insurers’\n                    purported repudiation of liability meant that the first defendant was not\n                    “a person who is insured in respect of the plaintiff’s\n                    claims” within the meaning of Order 29, rule 11(2)(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court (SI 1965/1776) (“the\n                    RSC”) (in pari materiawith O 29\n                        r 11(2)(a) of the ROC).27     Griffiths LJ held that the purpose of Order\n                    29, rule 11(2) of the RSC was to ensure that interim payments would only be\n                    ordered where it was likely that such an order would be met, either because the\n                    defendant was insured and it could be assumed that the insurance company would\n                    meet the interim payment, or because the defendant himself had the means and\n                    resources to make the interim payment. Griffiths LJ stated that the\n                    “obvious purpose” of Order 29, rule 11(2) of the RSC was to ensure\n                    that “costs and time are not wasted in making applications for interim\n                    payments which, however meritorious, have no realistic likelihood of being\n                    met.” Accordingly, his Lordship construed Order 29, rule 11(2)(a) of the RSC as being concerned with whether\n                    “there is a policy in existence which obliges an insurer to meet an\n                    interim award”. As stated (see[13]above), this conclusion was adopted by the learned AR inDu\n                        Zhao Di(at [37]), and I\n                    would add my respectful agreement that Griffiths LJ’s views enunciate the\n                    true purpose of O 29 r 11(2) of the ROC.28     On the facts ofO’Driscoll, Griffiths LJ held that the application of\n                    Order 29, rule 11(2)(a) of the RSC was not\n                    attracted, as a result of s 148 of the RTA 1972, subsection (2) of which\n                    was in all material respects identical to s 7 of the Act, while subsection\n                    (1) corresponded to s 8 of the Act (see[22]above). It will be recalled that the insurers inO’Driscollattempted to repudiate liability to the\n                    first defendant under the policy pursuant to clauses relating to the condition\n                    of the vehicle and notice to be given by the first defendant. Insofar as\n                    reliance on the former clause was concerned, that was rendered ineffective by\n                        s 148(1)(b) of the RTA 1972\n                    (corresponding to s 8(1)(b) of the Act),\n                    while the insurer’s attempt to invoke the latter clause was nullified by\n                    s 148(2) of the RTA 1972 (corresponding to s 7(1) of the Act).\n                    Consequently, Griffiths LJ concluded that “[s]o the position is that\n                    insurers will, by virtue of those two subsections, be treated, so far as the\n                    plaintiff is concerned, as insurers with a duty to indemnify the first defendant\n                    in respect of her claim”, and therefore the first defendant was\n                    “insured in respect of the plaintiff’s claim”, and Order 29,\n                    rule 11(2)(a) of the RSC did not\n                apply.Discussion(1)   Authorities inapplicable29     Notwithstanding the fact that bothDu Zhao DiandO’Driscollappeared to be strongly in the\n                    plaintiff’s favour, I was of the view that neither authority directly\n                    applied on the facts of this case, because both judgments turned on legislative\n                    provisions which did not apply here.30     BothDu Zhao DiandO’Driscollrelied on s 7 of the Act\n                    (or its English equivalent) to hold that the purported repudiations of liability\n                    under the respective policies were of no effect (vis-à-visthe plaintiffs). Unfortunately, s 7 of the Act\n                    only applies where the contractual clause in question relieves the insurer of\n                    liability “in the event of some specified thing being done or omitted to\n                    be doneafter the happening of the event giving rise to a\n                        claim under the policy” [emphasis added]. InDu Zhao Di, the “specified thing” was the\n                    defendant’s non-cooperation in the preparation of the defence, while inO’Driscollit was the first\n                    defendant’s failure to give sufficient notice. Both of these\n                    unquestionably occurred after the happening of the event which gave rise to a\n                    claim under the respective policies,viz, the\n                    accidents. In this case, however, the “specified thing” was the\n                    first defendant’s driving while under the influence of alcohol (see[7]above), which occurredbeforethe accident, and as a result s 7 of the Act\n                    could not apply.31     Admittedly, it was possible to reach a\n                    different conclusion if one was inclined to take a very narrow reading of\n                    cl 5.3 of the Policy. On such a reading, whether SGT 6356X was driven by a\n                    person with “more than the legal limit of any alcohol in his blood or\n                    breath” could only be determined with any certainty when the driver was\n                    charged or upon his conviction by a court of law, and if so then in this case\n                    that determination only took placeafterthe\n                    occurrence of the accident giving rise to the plaintiff’s claim. Such a\n                    reading of cl 5.3, however, was highly strained and surely did not reflect\n                    the intention of the parties to the Policy, and as such was not an\n                    interpretation which I considered as being open to me to take.32     The decision inO’Driscollalso rested on the English equivalent of\n                        s 8(1)(b) of the Act (see[28]above), but clearly cl 5.3 of the Policy\n                    had nothing to do with “the condition of the\n                vehicle”.(2)   Section 8(1)(a) of the\n                Act33     Notwithstanding this, however,O’Driscollshowed the way forward, because if\n                    cl 5.3 of the Policy fell foul of any of the other limbs of s 8(1) of\n                    the Act, the second defendant’s purported repudiation of liability under\n                    the Policy would have been of no effectvis-à-visthe plaintiff. The prime candidate in this respect was s 8(1)(a),ie, could cl 5.3\n                    be regarded as a term of the Policy which purported to “restrict the\n                    insurance of the person insured… by reference to… (a) the age or\n                    physical or mental condition of persons driving the vehicle”? In other\n                    words, could driving under the influence of alcohol be said to relate to a\n                    “physical or mental condition”?34     Robert Merkin,Colinvaux’s Law of Insurance(Sweet & Maxwell,\n                        9thed, 2010) at para 22-036, says of\n                        s 148(2)(a) of the RTA 1988 (in pari materiawith s 8(1)(a) of the Act):… This does not extend to a condition requiring the assured to\n                        exercise reasonable care and to employ only steady and sober drivers, butconditions prohibiting driving by persons under the\n                            influence of drugs or alcohol are outlawed.[emphasis added]Unfortunately, the authorities cited in relation to this last\n                    proposition wereLouden v British Merchants’ Insurance\n                        Co Ltd[1961] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 154\n                        (“Louden”),Criminal Proceedings against Rafael Ruiz Bernáldez, Case\n                    C-129/94 [1996] ECR I-289 (“Bernáldez”), a decision of the European Court of Justice,\n                    andStorebrand Skadeforsikring AS v Finanger[2000] Lloyd’s Rep IR 462 (“Finanger”), a decision of the European Free Trade\n                    Association Court.Loudenwill be discussed later\n                    (see[36]below), while bothBernáldezandFinangerproceeded on the basis of European Union law and were therefore of no assistance\n                    to me.35     In Robert Merkin and Jeremy Stuart-Smith,The Law of Motor Insurance(Sweet &\n                    Maxwell, 2004) at para 5-138, the following passage appears in a discussion of\n                        s 148(2)(a) of the RTA 1988:The insurers may not rely upon any policy term relating to “the age\n                        or physical or mental condition of persons driving the vehicle.”This provisionhas been held not extend\n                            [sic] to a condition requiring the assured\n                        to exercise reasonable care and to employ only steady and sober drivers,\n                        although itclearly extends to conditions which purport\n                            to restrict the insurers’ liability where the vehicle is being\n                            driven by persons under the influence of drugs or alcohol. InBernaldezthe European Court of Justice\n                        confirmed that a compulsory cover could not exclude liability for loss or\n                        damage inflicted by a drunken driver.The English courts\n                            had independently reached the view prior to the adoption of compulsory\n                            insurance that intoxication was no defence to a claim on a\n                            policy.[emphasis added in bold]Tinline v White Cross Insurance Association,\n                        Limited[1921] 3 KB 327 (“Tinline”) andJames v British General\n                        Insurance Company, Limited[1927] 2 KB 311\n                        (“James”), which were cited as\n                    authorities for the final sentence in the above quotation, were unhelpful, for\n                    they preceded the introduction of compulsory third party motor insurance, and\n                    they only decided that, as a matter of public policy, an insured person was not\n                    precluded from suing his insurer for an indemnity in respect of liability\n                    incurred by him towards a third party who had been killed or injured as a result\n                    of the insured person’s criminal conduct, as long as such conduct was\n                    negligent rather than intentional (see to similar effect the decision of the\n                    Singapore Court of Appeal inThe New India Assurance Co Ltd v\n                        Woo Ching Fong[1962] MLJ 432).TinlineandJames, therefore, were\n                    decided solely on the basis that the rule of public policy known asex turpi causa non oritur actiodid not apply, and,\n                    because in neither case was there a clause in the insurance policy by which the\n                    insurer purported to restrict the scope of the policy or exclude its liability\n                    by reference to the insured person’s criminal behaviour,TinlineandJamesdid not\n                    need to consider whether the insurers could rely on such a clause.36     InLouden(which\n                    was the authority cited inThe Law of Motor\n                        Insurancein relation to the proposition that\n                        s 148(2)(a) of the RTA 1988\n                    “clearly extends to conditions which purport to restrict the\n                    insurers’ liability where the vehicle is being driven by persons under the\n                    influence of… alcohol” (see[35]above)), the court was required to confront just such a\n                    question. There the insured person had taken out a comprehensive motor insurance\n                    policy, which contained an exclusion clause stating that the insurer would not\n                    be liable under the policy to the insured person in respect of bodily injury\n                    “sustained whilst under the influence of… intoxicating\n                    liquor”. The insured person died as a result of an accident which\n                    occurred while he was under the influence of alcohol, and the question was\n                    whether the insurer was liable under the policy to the insured person’s\n                    estate. Lawton J held (at 158) that, on the evidence, the insured person\n                    had been under the influence of intoxicating liquor within the meaning of the\n                    exclusion clause (on which see[41]below),\n                    and gave judgment for the insurer. However,Loudenwas not directly relevant because, there being no claim by a third party, there\n                    was no consideration of the English equivalent of s 8(1)(a) of the Act.37     Similarly, inMarcel Beller\n                        Ltd v Hayden[1978] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 472\n                        (“Marcell Beller”), a life\n                    assurance policy excluded liability for “death… directly or\n                    indirectly resulting from… the insured person’s own criminal\n                    act”, and the insured person had died in a road accident caused by his\n                    driving under the influence of drink contrary to s 5 of the RTA 1972. The\n                    court held that the insurer was entitled to rely on the exclusion clause and\n                    deny liability to the insured person. Again, however,Marcell\n                        Bellerwas not quite on point because no question of compulsory\n                    third party motor insurance was involved.38     The above cases therefore fell into two\n                    categories. There were cases (James) which held\n                    that, at common law, an insurer could not exclude liability (under the doctrine\n                    ofex turpi causa) to indemnify the insured person\n                    against a third party’s claim by reference to the insured person’s\n                    drink driving, but where the policy in question did not contain an exclusion\n                    clause. There were also cases (LoudenandMarcel Beller) which held that, at common law,\n                    an insurer could exclude liability to the insured person by reference to an\n                    exclusion clause relating to his being under the influence of alcohol or his\n                    criminal behaviour, but which only concerned the insured person’s own\n                    claim, and not a claim by him for an indemnity in respect of damages to be paid\n                    to a third party victim.39     Consequently, somewhat surprisingly, it\n                    appeared that the question of whether a clause in an insurance policy, such as\n                    cl 5.3 of the Policy, which excluded the insurer’s liability to\n                    indemnify the insured person against a third party’s claim where the\n                    insured person had been driving under the influence of alcohol fell foul of\n                        s 8(1)(a) of the Act was untouched by\n                    authority, and it was open to me to consider the matter from first\n                    principles.40     It seemed to me that there was every reason to\n                    construe s 8(1)(a) of the Act as nullifying\n                    cl 5.3 of the Policy.41     First, on a literal interpretation, I could\n                    not see how a clause in an insurance policy which referred to the driver of a\n                    vehicle having “more than the legal limit of any alcohol in his blood or\n                    breath” did not relate to the “physical or mental\n                    condition” of the person driving the vehicle. A contamination of a\n                    person’s bloodstream by a foreign substance (such as alcohol) seemed to me\n                    to be eminently a matter of that person’s “physical…\n                    condition”. The manner in which the exemption clause inLoudenhad been construed was also instructive in this\n                    regard. Lawton J, in interpreting the words “under the influence of\n                    intoxicating liquor”, applied a construction which had long been settled\n                    in England since the case ofMair v Railway Passengers\n                        Assurance Company, Ltd(1877) 37 LT 356,viz, that those words connoted the disturbance of\n                    “the balance of a man’s mind” or “the quiet, calm,\n                    intelligent exercise of the faculties” (Loudenat 157). That appeared to me to indicate that exclusion\n                    clauses in insurance policies which referred to driving under the influence of\n                    alcohol (or variants thereof) were to be understood as relating to the\n                    “mental condition” of the driver.42     Second, a purposive interpretation (as\n                    required by s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed))\n                    led to the same conclusion. Section 8 of the Act had its origins in s 10 of\n                    the RTA 1934 (seeColinvaux’s Law of\n                        Insuranceat para 22-036 at fn 309), which was enacted to ensure\n                    that the system of compulsory third party motor insurance established by the RTA\n                    1930 was not circumvented and undermined by motor insurers contracting out of\n                    liability by imposing terms and conditions of their choosing (seeZurich General Accident and Liability Insurance Company, Limited v\n                        Morrison and others[1942] 2 KB 53 at 61 to 62\n                        (perGoddard LJ)). Section 10 of the RTA\n                    1934 (and now s 8 of the Act) was to be seen, therefore, as preventing\n                    motor insurers from excluding liability for common risks, in keeping with the\n                    avowed purpose of the Act of ensuring compensation to third party victims of\n                    road accidents (see[21]above). Viewed in\n                    this light, it was entirely understandable for the UK Parliament to have\n                    provided that insurers could not escape liability by stipulating that the\n                    insurance policy did not cover liabilities arising, for example, from drivers\n                    being underage (now embodied in s 8(1)(a) of\n                    the Act), or in poor health (s 8(1)(a)), or\n                    from vehicles that were poorly maintained (s 8(1)(b)) or overloaded (s 8(1)(c)\n                    and (d)). That these occurrences were frequent\n                    dangers in 1934 could be seen from the fact that most if not all of them were\n                    prohibited under the RTA 1930 (see for instance ss 3, 5, 9, 25 and 30 of\n                    the RTA 1930), and I considered it reasonable to regard driving while under the\n                    influence of drink (proscribed by s 15 of the RTA 1930) as a common risk\n                    that insurers were to be prevented from deploying as a basis on which to escape\n                    liability under the insurance policy.43     In addition, I did not regard this\n                    construction of s 8(1)(a) of the Act as being\n                    particularly oppressive towards motor insurers, who were, after all, given a\n                    statutory right under s 8(3) of the Act (see[22]above) to claw back from the insured person whatever moneys\n                    had to be paid out as a result.Conclusion on O 29 r 11(2)(a) of the ROC44     For the foregoing reasons, I concluded that\n                    the second defendant’s purported repudiation of liability under the Policy\n                    to indemnify the first defendant in respect of the plaintiff’s claim,\n                    pursuant to cl 5.3 of the Policy, was of no effect as far as the plaintiff\n                    was concerned, by operation of s 8(1)(a) of\n                    the Act. As such, the second defendant was still contractually obliged to\n                    indemnify the first defendant against the plaintiff’s claim, and that\n                    being the case, there was clearly a policy of motor insurance in existence which\n                    obliged an insurer to meet an interim payment, and therefore, in accordance with\n                    Griffith LJ’s views inO’Driscoll(see[27]above), O 29\n                        r 11(2)(a) of the Rules of Court did not\n                    apply.O 29 r 11(2)(b) of the Rules of Court45     It was held inDu Zhao\n                        Di(at [29]) that the two\n                    limbs of O 29 r 11(2) were to be read disjunctively, so it was\n                    sufficient for the success of the plaintiff’s application that at least\n                    one of the limbs of O 29 r 11(2) did not apply.46     In the event that I was wrong in my\n                    construction of O 29 r 11(2)(a) of the\n                    Rules of Court, therefore, it was necessary to consider whether the same result\n                    would be reached (ie, that the interim payment\n                    could be ordered), because O 29 r 11(2)(b) did not apply.Burden of proof47     Given the dispute between the parties over\n                    whether the evidence in this case established that the first defendant was\n                    “a person whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make the\n                    interim payment”, whether O 29 r 11(2)(b) applied turned on the issue of the burden of proof, hence my\n                    invitation to parties to address me on this point (see[16]above).48     Again, what authorities there were shed little\n                    light on this matter. NeitherDu Zhao DinorO’Driscollwas applicable, because it\n                    was either assumed without argument that the burden rested on the plaintiff\n                        (Du Zhao Diat [23] and [30]), or it\n                    was accepted that O 29 r 11(2)(b) in\n                    fact applied,ie, the defendant did not have the\n                    means and resources to enable him to make the interim payment (O’Driscoll). Indeed, I was not directed to any\n                    case where the question of the burden of proof under O 29\n                        r 11(2)(b) had arisen for explicit\n                    consideration.49     Although I was initially inclined to the view\n                    that the burden of proof under O 29 r 11(2)(b) rested with the plaintiff, I eventually decided that the\n                    burden of proof was on the first defendant, as a result of ss 105 and 108\n                    of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”),\n                    which provide:Burden of proof as to particular fact105. The burden of proof as to any\n                        particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its\n                        existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact\n                        shall lie on any particular person.…Burden of proving fact especially within\n                            knowledge108. When any fact is especially within the\n                        knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.50     InWong Leong Wei Edward\n                        and another v Acclaim Insurance Brokers Pte Ltd[2010] SGHC 352 at [29],\n                    Steven Chong J approved the view (seeSir John Woodroffe\n                        & Syed Amir Ali’s Law of Evidence(V Kesava Rao ed)\n                    (LexisNexis Butterworths Wadhwa Nagpur, 18thed,\n                    2008) at p 4476) that s 108 was:… designed to meet certain exceptional cases in which it would be\n                        impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult, for the [plaintiff]\n                        to establish facts which are ‘especially’ within the knowledge\n                        of the [defendant] and which [the defendant] could prove without difficulty\n                        or inconvenience… The word ‘especially’… means\n                        facts that are pre-eminently or exceptionally within his knowledge.51     Whether the first defendant had the\n                    “means and resources… to enable him to make the interim\n                    payment” within the meaning of O 29 r 11(2)(b) was a fact especially within the first defendant’s\n                    knowledge, and the first defendant could (dis)prove it without difficulty or\n                    inconvenience, whereas it would be impossible or disproportionately difficult\n                    for the plaintiff to prove it. After all, it was hard to imagine who else but\n                    the first defendant would have knowledge of his financial affairs. Consequently,\n                    the first defendant bore the burden of proving that he was not “a person\n                    whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make the interim\n                    payment”, whether as a particular fact the existence of which he wished\n                    me to believe under s 105 of the EA, or as a fact especially within his\n                    knowledge under s 108 of the EA.52     I found clear support for this approach inThe “Asia Star”[2010]\n                    2 SLR 1154, a decision of the Court of Appeal on the duty to mitigate\n                    in the context of a breach of a voyage charterparty by the appellant\n                    shipowner’s failure to deliver the chartered vessel. In rejecting the\n                    respondent charterer’s argument that it had acted reasonably in refusing\n                    to spend US$399,500 to engage an alternative available vessel (“thePuma”) and thereby mitigate its loss,\n                    because of its impecuniosity, the Court of Appeal held that the burden of\n                    proving the fact that chartering thePumawould\n                    have been financially prohibitive lay on the respondent, stating (at [63]):In the present case, the respondent wished to rely on the alleged fact\n                        that the additional US$399,500 which it would have had to pay if it had\n                        chartered thePumawas a financially\n                        prohibitive sum that it could not afford –ie,it wanted the court to\n                            believe in the existence of this fact (see s 105 of the Evidence\n                            Act). This fact was “especially within the knowledge of [the\n                            respondent]” for the purposes of s 108 of the Evidence Act\n                            since only the respondent could be fully aware of all the relevant\n                            particulars of its own financial position at the material\n                            time.Thus, … the respondent must\n                            satisfactorily establish with cogent evidence that itwasindeed unable to afford to spend an additional US$399,500\n                            at the material point in time…[emphasis added in bold]Discharging the burden53     The next question was whether the first\n                    defendant had discharged his burden of proof by adducing evidence that he was\n                    not “a person whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make\n                    the interim payment” under O 29 r 11(2)(b) of the Rules of Court.54     No affidavit evidence was produced by the\n                    first defendant to prove that he lacked the means and resources to enable him to\n                    make the interim payment. In contrast, as Mr Srinivasan pointed out, the\n                    first defendant had retained KhattarWong throughout these proceedings and those\n                    in the Subordinate Courts (see[14]above),\n                    and I was entitled to presume under s 116(f)\n                    of the EA that, in the common course of business, KhattarWong would have charged\n                    (and the first defendant would have agreed to pay) a not insignificant retainer.\n                    On that basis, I was not persuaded that O 29 r 11(2)(b) of the Rules of Court had been made out by the first\n                    defendant.Whether to order interim payment and the quantum to be\n                ordered55     This issue could be taken relatively shortly.\n                    Since neither O 29 r 11(2)(a) nor\n                        (b) of the Rules of Court applied, it was\n                    appropriate for me to exercise my discretion to order interim payment in view of\n                    the plaintiff’s dire injuries and his consequent need to pay for his\n                    medical treatment, which I was told is ongoing. As for the quantum, Mr Yeo\n                    very fairly conceded at the first hearing that if interim payment was to be\n                    ordered, he would not quarrel with the sum of $80,000.Whether interim payment was to be paid to the plaintiff\n                personally56     This issue initially arose because I\n                    considered it possible that, if s 9 of the Act applied in this case, under\n                        s 9(1)(a), an interim payment obtained by\n                    the plaintiff against the first defendant, being a sum payable under a judgment\n                    in respect of a liability required to be covered by the Policy, had to be paid\n                    by the second defendant to the Public Trustee (see[22]above).57     However, upon further consideration, it became\n                    clear to me that s 9 of the Act was not being invoked (because the\n                    plaintiff was not making a direct claim against the second defendant but was\n                    merely applying for interim payment against the first defendant) and, unlike\n                    s 8 (see[44]above), had no other\n                    relevance in this case. Therefore, as a matter of course, interim payment was to\n                    be paid by the first defendant to the plaintiff personally.58     I should add that, thus far, I have not\n                    referred to the first and second defendants’ submission that, under\n                    s 9 of the Act, the second defendant is only obliged to satisfy final and\n                    not interlocutory judgments (see[11]and[13]above). Nonetheless, as both\n                    defendants founded themselves strongly upon this argument, it would be a\n                    disservice to their counsels’ efforts if I did not articulate my reasons\n                    for agreeing with their submissions, albeit only tentatively, because the\n                    question of whether s 9 of the Act applied to interlocutory as well as\n                    final judgments appeared never to have arisen before and I was therefore\n                    unguided by authority on an issue which was not directly pertinent to this\n                    application.59     First, although s 9 of the Act does not\n                    in terms distinguish between final and interlocutory judgments, some of the\n                    language in s 9,eg, s 9(2)(a) which speaks of a “judgmentfor a sumnot exceeding the relevant amount” [emphasis\n                    added] (see[22]above), more naturally\n                    described final rather than interlocutory judgments (see also\n                        s 9(3)(b) which speaks of\n                    “execution” of the judgment – interlocutory judgments cannot\n                    be enforced (Tan Kim Seng v Ibrahim Victor Adam[2004] 1 SLR(R) 181 at [31])).60     Second, in virtually all the cases in which\n                    s 9 had been successfully relied upon, the third party had obtained final\n                    judgment against the insured person. Indeed, it was difficult to imagine why the\n                    third party would need to rely on s 9 of the Act to enforce an\n                    interlocutory judgment (obtained against the tortfeasor) against the insurer by\n                    applying for an interim payment to be paid by the insurer to the Public Trustee.\n                    The only situation in which such a course of action was conceivably necessary\n                    was where the insurer had purported to repudiate liability to the insured\n                    person, but such repudiation was rendered ineffectivevis-à-visthe third party due to ss 7 or 8 of the Act, and\n                    the third party had obtained interlocutory judgment and an order for interim\n                    payment against the insured person, who then absconded from jurisdiction. Even\n                    so, however, it was surely more principled to require the third party to avail\n                    himself of the normal measures for executing court orders (to enforce the order\n                    for interim payment), and/or proceed expeditiously to final judgment before\n                    resorting to s 9 of the Act, than to distort the natural language of\n                    s 9 in order to force it to encompass interlocutory\n                judgments.61     My attention was also drawn toThe Public Trustee Practice Circular 1 of 2004: Administration of\n                        Accident Compensation Monies under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and\n                        Compensation) Act (Cap 189), para 7 of which stated\n                    clearly that “[t]he Public Trustee will not administer any cases for\n                    interim payment only”. Although this was, strictly speaking, an\n                    administrative restriction imposed by the Public Trustee rather than a legal one\n                    under s 9 of the Act, the Public Trustee’s position reinforced the\n                    view that, in practice, there was little or no need for the third party to use\n                    s 9 of the Act to enforce an interlocutory judgment (obtained against the\n                    tortfeasor) against the insurer.62     Had it been necessary to decide the point,\n                    therefore, I should have thought that s 9 of the Act ought to be construed\n                    as covering only final and not interlocutory judgments. Fortunately, however,\n                    the point did not arise in the present case, and therefore I need say no more\n                    about this issue.Conclusion63     For all the foregoing reasons, I granted the\n                    plaintiff’s application for an interim payment of $80,000 from the first\n                    defendant, pursuant to which I made an order in terms of prayers 1 and 2 of the\n                    summons.64     Since the plaintiff succeeded against the\n                    first defendant, I ordered that costs of $2,000 be paid by the latter to the\n                    former. However, as the second defendant had been unnecessarily burdened by\n                    these proceedings despite the fact that the plaintiff had no direct claim\n                    against it, I ordered that the plaintiff pay costs of $500 to the second\n                    defendant.",
        "Issues": "18     The issues which arose for my consideration,\n                    therefore, were as follows: (a)     Whether, notwithstanding that the\n                        second defendant had purported to repudiate its liability under the Policy,\n                        the first defendant was nonetheless “a person who is insured in\n                        respect of the plaintiff’s claims” within the meaning of\n                        O 29 r 11(2)(a) of the Rules of\n                        Court; and (b)     Who\n                        bore the burden of proving whether the first defendant was “a person\n                        whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make the interim\n                        payment” within the meaning of O 29 r 11(2)(b), and whether that burden had been\n                        discharged; (c)     Whether, if neither O 29 r 11(2)(a)\n                        nor O 29 r 11(2)(b) was applicable,\n                        I ought to exercise my discretion to order interim payment, and if so the\n                        amount of interim payment to be granted; and (d)     Whether, if interim payment was ordered, it\n                        could be paid to the plaintiff personally, or whether, under s 9 of the\n                        Act, it had to be paid to the Public Trustee.",
        "O 29 r 11(2)(a) of the Rules of Court": "20     I should say that, unlike the second issue\n                    under O 29 r 11(2)(b) of the Rules of\n                    Court (see[47]below), no question of\n                    burden of proof arose under O 29 r 11(2)(a), because, as Mr Srinivasan rightly pointed out, the\n                    parties being agreed on all material facts, the only questions were questions of\n                    law,viz, the meaning of the phrase “a\n                    person who is insured in respect of the plaintiff’s claim” and\n                    whether the agreed facts fell within O 29 r 11(2)(a) as properly construed. Although this question was ostensibly\n                    one of construction of O 29 r 11(2)(a),\n                    that task was made more difficult due to the fact that the scheme of compulsory\n                    third party motor insurance under the Act had to be taken into account, because\n                    whether or not the first defendant was “insured in respect of the\n                    plaintiff’s claim” depended very much on some of the provisions of\n                    the Act. The Act 21     The Act originally derived from the UK’s\n                    Road Traffic Act 1930 (c 43) (UK) (“the RTA 1930”) and its\n                    many iterations, the most material for present purposes being the Road Traffic\n                    Act 1934 (c 50) (UK) (“the RTA 1934”), Road Traffic Act 1972\n                    (c 20) (UK) (“the RTA 1972”) and Road Traffic Act 1988\n                    (c 52) (UK) (“the RTA 1988”). The Act was introduced to\n                    ensure that innocent victims of road accidents (“third parties”)\n                    would be adequately protected in the event of fatality or bodily injury. As Tan\n                    Lee Meng,Insurance Law in Singapore(Butterworths\n                    Asia, 2nded, 1997) explains at p 573: The [Act], which is intended to safeguard the legal rights of third\n                        parties who have been injured or killed by persons who use motor vehicles on\n                        the road, establishes a system for compulsory motor insurance in Singapore\n                        with regard to third party liability. It requires a motor insurer to meet\n                        the insured’s obligations to a third party… in the event that\n                        the insured does not do so. 22     Some salient features of the Act should be\n                    mentioned. Under s 3 of the Act, all users of motor vehicles must be issued\n                    an insurance policy which insures the user and other authorised drivers against\n                    third party risks, in particular, liability incurred by the user in respect of\n                    the death or bodily injury of any person as a result of the use of the motor\n                    vehicle (see s 4(1)(b) of the Act). The\n                    insured person must also be issued a certificate of insurance under s 4(9)\n                    of the Act. Once those requirements have been complied with, the Act’s\n                    object is then to see that any third parties who are the victims of road\n                    accidents will generally receive the compensation they are entitled to, and it\n                    achieves this by,inter alia, statutorily removing\n                    some of the insurer’s freedom to contract out of its liabilities to the\n                    insured person. Under ss 7 and 8 of the Act, for instance, the third\n                    party’s position has been considerably strengthened by legislative\n                    intervention, because where these sections apply, certain attempts by the\n                    insurer to restrict or exclude its liability under the insurance policy to\n                    indemnify the insured person are rendered ineffective, and the insurer will be\n                    contractually obliged to indemnify the insured person under the insurance policy\n                    in respect of the third party’s claim against the insured person for\n                    damages, which sums the insurer may be able to recover from the insured person\n                    (as of right in the case of s 8 of the Act, but only if the insurance\n                    policy so provides in the case of s 7). As I will be referring to ss 7\n                    and 8 later in these grounds, it will be useful to set out exactly what they\n                    provide: Certain conditions in policies or securities to be of\n                            no effect 7.—(1) Any condition in a policy or\n                        security issued or given for the purposes of this Act providing that no\n                        liability shall arise under the policy or security or that any liability so\n                        arising shall cease in the event of some specified thing being done or\n                        omitted to be done after the happening of the event giving rise to a claim\n                        under the policy or security shall be of no effect in connection with such\n                        claims as are mentioned in section 4 (1) (b)\n                            [ie, claims in respect of death or bodily\n                        injury by third parties]. (2) Nothing in this section shall be taken to render void any provision in\n                        a policy or security requiring the person insured or secured to repay to the\n                        insurer or the giver of the security any sums which the latter may have\n                        become liable to pay under the policy or security and which have been\n                        applied to the satisfaction of the claims of third parties. Avoidance of restrictions on scope of policies covering\n                            third-party risks 8.—(1) Where a\n                        certificate of insurance has been issued under section 4 (9) to the person\n                        by whom a policy has been effected, so much of the policy as purports to\n                        restrict the insurance of the persons insured thereby by reference to any of\n                        the following matters: (a) the age or physical or mental\n                            condition of persons driving the vehicle; (b) the condition of the vehicle; (c) the number of persons that the\n                            vehicle carries; (d) the weight or physical\n                            characteristics of the goods that the vehicle carries; (e) the times at which or the areas\n                            within which the vehicle is used; (f) the horse-power or value of the\n                            vehicle; (g) the carrying on the vehicle of any\n                            particular apparatus; or (h) the carrying on the vehicle of any\n                            particular means of identification other than any means of\n                            identification required to be carried by or under the Road Traffic Act\n                            (Cap 276), shall as respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a\n                        policy under section 4 (1) (b) be of no\n                        effect. (2) Nothing in this section shall require an insurer to pay any sum in\n                        respect of the liability of any person otherwise than in or towards the\n                        discharge of that liability. (3) Any sum paid by an insurer in or towards the discharge of any\n                        liability of any person which is covered by the policy by virtue only of\n                        this section shall be recoverable by the insurer from that person. Finally, s 9 of the Act gives the third party who has obtained\n                    judgment against the insured person a statutory right of action against the\n                    insurer, allowing the third party to directly enforce his judgment against the\n                    insurer, even if the insurer has avoided or cancelled the policy and is not\n                    therefore liable to the insured person: Duty of insurers to satisfy judgments against persons\n                            insured in respect of third-party risks 9.—(1) If after a\n                        certificate of insurance has been issued under section 4 (9) to the person\n                        by whom a policy has been effected judgment in respect of any such liability\n                        as is required to be covered by a policy under section 4 (1) (b) (being a liability covered by the terms of the\n                        policy) is obtained against any person insured by the policy then,\n                        notwithstanding that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel or may\n                        have avoided or cancelled the policy, the insurer shall, subject to this\n                        section, pay to the Public Trustee as trustee for the persons entitled\n                        thereto — (a) any sum payable thereunder in\n                            respect of the liability including any amount payable in respect of\n                            costs; and (b) any sum payable in respect of\n                            interest on that sum by virtue of any written law relating to interest\n                            on judgments. (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) providing for the payment\n                        to the Public Trustee — (a) where the judgment is for a sum not\n                            exceeding the relevant amount, the insurer may pay the sum to the person\n                            or persons entitled to the benefit of the judgment; … (3) No sum shall be payable by an insurer under subsections\n                        (1) and (2) — … (b) in respect of any judgment so long\n                            as execution thereon is stayed pending an appeal; … … 23     It was apparent, therefore, that simply\n                    because the second defendant had purported to repudiate its liability to\n                    indemnify the first defendant under the Policy in respect of the\n                    plaintiff’s claim, it did not follow that the first defendant was not\n                    therefore “insured”: it might have been that, as a matter of law,\n                    such repudiation was ineffective due to one of the provisions of the Act, as was\n                    held to be the case inDu Zhao Di. Du Zhao Di 24     The facts ofDu Zhao\n                        Di, as Mr Srinivasan noted, were materially similar to those\n                    in the present case. The plaintiff and defendant were involved in an accident\n                    when the defendant opened the door of his car and the plaintiff, while riding a\n                    bicycle, collided into the open door. The plaintiff sued the defendant seeking\n                    substantial damages. The defendant was initially represented by lawyers acting\n                    for the intervener, Mayban General Assurance Berhad, who had issued a third\n                    party motor vehicle insurance policy to the defendant. However, as a result of\n                    the defendant’s non-cooperation in the preparation of the defence, the\n                    intervener purportedly repudiated liability on the insurance policy. The matter\n                    then came before the learned assistant registrar (“AR”)\n                    Mr Mohamed Faizal on the plaintiff’s application for an interim\n                    payment. One of the grounds on which the intervener opposed the application was\n                    that, given that it had repudiated liability to the defendant under the\n                    insurance policy, the defendant was not “insured in respect of the\n                    plaintiff’s claim” within the meaning of O 29\n                        r 11(2)(a). 25     The learned AR rejected this argument. He held\n                    that the intervener’s repudiation of liability under the insurance policy\n                    would not affect the plaintiff for the following reasons: 33    … Insofar as the [plaintiff] was concerned,\n                            such a breach of the insurance contract on the part of the defendant\n                            that would afford repudiation can only operateinter\n                                partesand notomni partes.\n                            Put another way, there was no doubt that, so far as the [plaintiff] was\n                            concerned, the [defendant] was covered by a valid policy of insurance,\n                            for it is conventional wisdom that “conditions precedent to\n                            liability and conditions subsequent to avoiding liability cannot be used\n                            in respect of claims by a third party in respect of injury or death\n                            which has been caused by the injured tortfeasor”: see Goh-Low\n                            Soen Yinet al, “Insurance\n                            Law”,Articles on Singapore Law(24, 2005). For that reason, if, in fact, the term does attempt to\n                            impinge upon the rights of third parties (such as the [plaintiff] here),\n                            it must necessarily be held to be void (at leastvis-à-visthe third party), forsuch\n                                a term would be the quintessential form of term that would fall foul\n                                of s 7(1) of the Act… 34    Therefore… I was of the view that the\n                            [intervener] would, by virtue of the above reasoning, be treated, so far\n                            as the [plaintiff] was concerned, as insurers with a duty to indemnify\n                            the defendant in respect of the claim. No reliance can be had to the\n                            purported repudiation for the purposes of any action that had been\n                            commenced by a third party, since such third party could not, in law, be\n                            burdened by the ramifications of such a term that may otherwise be\n                            binding on the partiesinter partes. As\n                            such,it was not open for the [intervener] to argue\n                                that there had been repudiation since such repudiation was\n                                predicated upon the efficacy of a term that had no effectvis-à-visthe [plaintiff]. [emphasis added in bold] The learned AR’s reasoning in these passages could be summarised\n                    as follows. The intervener’s purported repudiation of its liability under\n                    the insurance policy to indemnify the defendant in respect of the\n                    plaintiff’s claim was of no effect as far as the plaintiff was concerned,\n                    because it fell foul of s 7(1) of the Act (see[22]above). Therefore, by operation of s 7(1), the\n                    intervener was still contractually obliged to indemnify the defendant under the\n                    insurance policy in respect of the plaintiff’s claim. As a result, the\n                    defendant was to be considered “insured in respect of the\n                    plaintiff’s claim” under O 29 r 11(2)(a) of the Rules of Court, and an interim payment could be (and\n                    was) ordered. O’Driscoll 26     At [35] ofDu Zhao Di, the learned AR\n                    found support for his approach in the English case ofO’Driscoll, where the plaintiff was a passenger in a bus\n                    and was injured when the bus braked suddenly, as a result of the first\n                    defendant’s motor car losing a wheel and skidding across the road. The\n                    first defendant was covered by a policy of motor insurance, which on the face of\n                    it covered his potential liability to the plaintiff in respect of the accident.\n                    However, as inDu Zhao Diand the present case,\n                    his insurers purported to repudiate their liability to him under the policy, on\n                    the basis of certain clauses to the effect that the insurers would be relieved\n                    of liability if the first defendant’s vehicle was defective or if he\n                    failed to give notice of the accident to them within a specified time. The\n                    question for the Court of Appeal, therefore, was whether the insurers’\n                    purported repudiation of liability meant that the first defendant was not\n                    “a person who is insured in respect of the plaintiff’s\n                    claims” within the meaning of Order 29, rule 11(2)(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court (SI 1965/1776) (“the\n                    RSC”) (in pari materiawith O 29\n                        r 11(2)(a) of the ROC). 27     Griffiths LJ held that the purpose of Order\n                    29, rule 11(2) of the RSC was to ensure that interim payments would only be\n                    ordered where it was likely that such an order would be met, either because the\n                    defendant was insured and it could be assumed that the insurance company would\n                    meet the interim payment, or because the defendant himself had the means and\n                    resources to make the interim payment. Griffiths LJ stated that the\n                    “obvious purpose” of Order 29, rule 11(2) of the RSC was to ensure\n                    that “costs and time are not wasted in making applications for interim\n                    payments which, however meritorious, have no realistic likelihood of being\n                    met.” Accordingly, his Lordship construed Order 29, rule 11(2)(a) of the RSC as being concerned with whether\n                    “there is a policy in existence which obliges an insurer to meet an\n                    interim award”. As stated (see[13]above), this conclusion was adopted by the learned AR inDu\n                        Zhao Di(at [37]), and I\n                    would add my respectful agreement that Griffiths LJ’s views enunciate the\n                    true purpose of O 29 r 11(2) of the ROC. 28     On the facts ofO’Driscoll, Griffiths LJ held that the application of\n                    Order 29, rule 11(2)(a) of the RSC was not\n                    attracted, as a result of s 148 of the RTA 1972, subsection (2) of which\n                    was in all material respects identical to s 7 of the Act, while subsection\n                    (1) corresponded to s 8 of the Act (see[22]above). It will be recalled that the insurers inO’Driscollattempted to repudiate liability to the\n                    first defendant under the policy pursuant to clauses relating to the condition\n                    of the vehicle and notice to be given by the first defendant. Insofar as\n                    reliance on the former clause was concerned, that was rendered ineffective by\n                        s 148(1)(b) of the RTA 1972\n                    (corresponding to s 8(1)(b) of the Act),\n                    while the insurer’s attempt to invoke the latter clause was nullified by\n                    s 148(2) of the RTA 1972 (corresponding to s 7(1) of the Act).\n                    Consequently, Griffiths LJ concluded that “[s]o the position is that\n                    insurers will, by virtue of those two subsections, be treated, so far as the\n                    plaintiff is concerned, as insurers with a duty to indemnify the first defendant\n                    in respect of her claim”, and therefore the first defendant was\n                    “insured in respect of the plaintiff’s claim”, and Order 29,\n                    rule 11(2)(a) of the RSC did not\n                apply. Discussion (1)   Authorities inapplicable 29     Notwithstanding the fact that bothDu Zhao DiandO’Driscollappeared to be strongly in the\n                    plaintiff’s favour, I was of the view that neither authority directly\n                    applied on the facts of this case, because both judgments turned on legislative\n                    provisions which did not apply here. 30     BothDu Zhao DiandO’Driscollrelied on s 7 of the Act\n                    (or its English equivalent) to hold that the purported repudiations of liability\n                    under the respective policies were of no effect (vis-à-visthe plaintiffs). Unfortunately, s 7 of the Act\n                    only applies where the contractual clause in question relieves the insurer of\n                    liability “in the event of some specified thing being done or omitted to\n                    be doneafter the happening of the event giving rise to a\n                        claim under the policy” [emphasis added]. InDu Zhao Di, the “specified thing” was the\n                    defendant’s non-cooperation in the preparation of the defence, while inO’Driscollit was the first\n                    defendant’s failure to give sufficient notice. Both of these\n                    unquestionably occurred after the happening of the event which gave rise to a\n                    claim under the respective policies,viz, the\n                    accidents. In this case, however, the “specified thing” was the\n                    first defendant’s driving while under the influence of alcohol (see[7]above), which occurredbeforethe accident, and as a result s 7 of the Act\n                    could not apply. 31     Admittedly, it was possible to reach a\n                    different conclusion if one was inclined to take a very narrow reading of\n                    cl 5.3 of the Policy. On such a reading, whether SGT 6356X was driven by a\n                    person with “more than the legal limit of any alcohol in his blood or\n                    breath” could only be determined with any certainty when the driver was\n                    charged or upon his conviction by a court of law, and if so then in this case\n                    that determination only took placeafterthe\n                    occurrence of the accident giving rise to the plaintiff’s claim. Such a\n                    reading of cl 5.3, however, was highly strained and surely did not reflect\n                    the intention of the parties to the Policy, and as such was not an\n                    interpretation which I considered as being open to me to take. 32     The decision inO’Driscollalso rested on the English equivalent of\n                        s 8(1)(b) of the Act (see[28]above), but clearly cl 5.3 of the Policy\n                    had nothing to do with “the condition of the\n                vehicle”. (2)   Section 8(1)(a) of the\n                Act 33     Notwithstanding this, however,O’Driscollshowed the way forward, because if\n                    cl 5.3 of the Policy fell foul of any of the other limbs of s 8(1) of\n                    the Act, the second defendant’s purported repudiation of liability under\n                    the Policy would have been of no effectvis-à-visthe plaintiff. The prime candidate in this respect was s 8(1)(a),ie, could cl 5.3\n                    be regarded as a term of the Policy which purported to “restrict the\n                    insurance of the person insured… by reference to… (a) the age or\n                    physical or mental condition of persons driving the vehicle”? In other\n                    words, could driving under the influence of alcohol be said to relate to a\n                    “physical or mental condition”? 34     Robert Merkin,Colinvaux’s Law of Insurance(Sweet & Maxwell,\n                        9thed, 2010) at para 22-036, says of\n                        s 148(2)(a) of the RTA 1988 (in pari materiawith s 8(1)(a) of the Act): … This does not extend to a condition requiring the assured to\n                        exercise reasonable care and to employ only steady and sober drivers, butconditions prohibiting driving by persons under the\n                            influence of drugs or alcohol are outlawed.

InBernaldezthe European Court of Justice\n                        confirmed that a compulsory cover could not exclude liability for loss or\n                        damage inflicted by a drunken driver.The English courts\n                            had independently reached the view prior to the adoption of compulsory\n                            insurance that intoxication was no defence to a claim on a\n                            policy.

There the insured person had taken out a comprehensive motor insurance\n                    policy, which contained an exclusion clause stating that the insurer would not\n                    be liable under the policy to the insured person in respect of bodily injury\n                    “sustained whilst under the influence of… intoxicating\n                    liquor”. The insured person died as a result of an accident which\n                    occurred while he was under the influence of alcohol, and the question was\n                    whether the insurer was liable under the policy to the insured person’s\n                    estate. Lawton J held (at 158) that, on the evidence, the insured person\n                    had been under the influence of intoxicating liquor within the meaning of the\n                    exclusion clause (on which see[41]below),\n                    and gave judgment for the insurer. However,Loudenwas not directly relevant because, there being no claim by a third party, there\n                    was no consideration of the English equivalent of s 8(1)(a) of the Act. 37     Similarly, inMarcel Beller\n                        Ltd v Hayden[1978] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 472\n                        (“Marcell Beller”), a life\n                    assurance policy excluded liability for “death… directly or\n                    indirectly resulting from… the insured person’s own criminal\n                    act”, and the insured person had died in a road accident caused by his\n                    driving under the influence of drink contrary to s 5 of the RTA 1972. The\n                    court held that the insurer was entitled to rely on the exclusion clause and\n                    deny liability to the insured person. Again, however,Marcell\n                        Bellerwas not quite on point because no question of compulsory\n                    third party motor insurance was involved. 38     The above cases therefore fell into two\n                    categories. There were cases (James) which held\n                    that, at common law, an insurer could not exclude liability (under the doctrine\n                    ofex turpi causa) to indemnify the insured person\n                    against a third party’s claim by reference to the insured person’s\n                    drink driving, but where the policy in question did not contain an exclusion\n                    clause. There were also cases (LoudenandMarcel Beller) which held that, at common law,\n                    an insurer could exclude liability to the insured person by reference to an\n                    exclusion clause relating to his being under the influence of alcohol or his\n                    criminal behaviour, but which only concerned the insured person’s own\n                    claim, and not a claim by him for an indemnity in respect of damages to be paid\n                    to a third party victim. 39     Consequently, somewhat surprisingly, it\n                    appeared that the question of whether a clause in an insurance policy, such as\n                    cl 5.3 of the Policy, which excluded the insurer’s liability to\n                    indemnify the insured person against a third party’s claim where the\n                    insured person had been driving under the influence of alcohol fell foul of\n                        s 8(1)(a) of the Act was untouched by\n                    authority, and it was open to me to consider the matter from first\n                    principles. 40     It seemed to me that there was every reason to\n                    construe s 8(1)(a) of the Act as nullifying\n                    cl 5.3 of the Policy. 41     First, on a literal interpretation, I could\n                    not see how a clause in an insurance policy which referred to the driver of a\n                    vehicle having “more than the legal limit of any alcohol in his blood or\n                    breath” did not relate to the “physical or mental\n                    condition” of the person driving the vehicle. A contamination of a\n                    person’s bloodstream by a foreign substance (such as alcohol) seemed to me\n                    to be eminently a matter of that person’s “physical…\n                    condition”. The manner in which the exemption clause inLoudenhad been construed was also instructive in this\n                    regard. Lawton J, in interpreting the words “under the influence of\n                    intoxicating liquor”, applied a construction which had long been settled\n                    in England since the case ofMair v Railway Passengers\n                        Assurance Company, Ltd(1877) 37 LT 356,viz, that those words connoted the disturbance of\n                    “the balance of a man’s mind” or “the quiet, calm,\n                    intelligent exercise of the faculties” (Loudenat 157). That appeared to me to indicate that exclusion\n                    clauses in insurance policies which referred to driving under the influence of\n                    alcohol (or variants thereof) were to be understood as relating to the\n                    “mental condition” of the driver. 42     Second, a purposive interpretation (as\n                    required by s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed))\n                    led to the same conclusion. Section 8 of the Act had its origins in s 10 of\n                    the RTA 1934 (seeColinvaux’s Law of\n                        Insuranceat para 22-036 at fn 309), which was enacted to ensure\n                    that the system of compulsory third party motor insurance established by the RTA\n                    1930 was not circumvented and undermined by motor insurers contracting out of\n                    liability by imposing terms and conditions of their choosing (seeZurich General Accident and Liability Insurance Company, Limited v\n                        Morrison and others[1942] 2 KB 53 at 61 to 62\n                        (perGoddard LJ)). Section 10 of the RTA\n                    1934 (and now s 8 of the Act) was to be seen, therefore, as preventing\n                    motor insurers from excluding liability for common risks, in keeping with the\n                    avowed purpose of the Act of ensuring compensation to third party victims of\n                    road accidents (see[21]above). Viewed in\n                    this light, it was entirely understandable for the UK Parliament to have\n                    provided that insurers could not escape liability by stipulating that the\n                    insurance policy did not cover liabilities arising, for example, from drivers\n                    being underage (now embodied in s 8(1)(a) of\n                    the Act), or in poor health (s 8(1)(a)), or\n                    from vehicles that were poorly maintained (s 8(1)(b)) or overloaded (s 8(1)(c)\n                    and (d)). That these occurrences were frequent\n                    dangers in 1934 could be seen from the fact that most if not all of them were\n                    prohibited under the RTA 1930 (see for instance ss 3, 5, 9, 25 and 30 of\n                    the RTA 1930), and I considered it reasonable to regard driving while under the\n                    influence of drink (proscribed by s 15 of the RTA 1930) as a common risk\n                    that insurers were to be prevented from deploying as a basis on which to escape\n                    liability under the insurance policy. 43     In addition, I did not regard this\n                    construction of s 8(1)(a) of the Act as being\n                    particularly oppressive towards motor insurers, who were, after all, given a\n                    statutory right under s 8(3) of the Act (see[22]above) to claw back from the insured person whatever moneys\n                    had to be paid out as a result. Conclusion on O 29 r 11(2)(a) of the ROC 44     For the foregoing reasons, I concluded that\n                    the second defendant’s purported repudiation of liability under the Policy\n                    to indemnify the first defendant in respect of the plaintiff’s claim,\n                    pursuant to cl 5.3 of the Policy, was of no effect as far as the plaintiff\n                    was concerned, by operation of s 8(1)(a) of\n                    the Act. As such, the second defendant was still contractually obliged to\n                    indemnify the first defendant against the plaintiff’s claim, and that\n                    being the case, there was clearly a policy of motor insurance in existence which\n                    obliged an insurer to meet an interim payment, and therefore, in accordance with\n                    Griffith LJ’s views inO’Driscoll(see[27]above), O 29\n                        r 11(2)(a) of the Rules of Court did not\n                    apply.",
        "O 29 r 11(2)(b) of the Rules of Court": "45     It was held inDu Zhao\n                        Di(at [29]) that the two\n                    limbs of O 29 r 11(2) were to be read disjunctively, so it was\n                    sufficient for the success of the plaintiff’s application that at least\n                    one of the limbs of O 29 r 11(2) did not apply. 46     In the event that I was wrong in my\n                    construction of O 29 r 11(2)(a) of the\n                    Rules of Court, therefore, it was necessary to consider whether the same result\n                    would be reached (ie, that the interim payment\n                    could be ordered), because O 29 r 11(2)(b) did not apply. Burden of proof 47     Given the dispute between the parties over\n                    whether the evidence in this case established that the first defendant was\n                    “a person whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make the\n                    interim payment”, whether O 29 r 11(2)(b) applied turned on the issue of the burden of proof, hence my\n                    invitation to parties to address me on this point (see[16]above). 48     Again, what authorities there were shed little\n                    light on this matter. NeitherDu Zhao DinorO’Driscollwas applicable, because it\n                    was either assumed without argument that the burden rested on the plaintiff\n                        (Du Zhao Diat [23] and [30]), or it\n                    was accepted that O 29 r 11(2)(b) in\n                    fact applied,ie, the defendant did not have the\n                    means and resources to enable him to make the interim payment (O’Driscoll). Indeed, I was not directed to any\n                    case where the question of the burden of proof under O 29\n                        r 11(2)(b) had arisen for explicit\n                    consideration. 49     Although I was initially inclined to the view\n                    that the burden of proof under O 29 r 11(2)(b) rested with the plaintiff, I eventually decided that the\n                    burden of proof was on the first defendant, as a result of ss 105 and 108\n                    of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”),\n                    which provide: Burden of proof as to particular fact 105. The burden of proof as to any\n                        particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its\n                        existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact\n                        shall lie on any particular person. … Burden of proving fact especially within\n                            knowledge 108. When any fact is especially within the\n                        knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him. 50     InWong Leong Wei Edward\n                        and another v Acclaim Insurance Brokers Pte Ltd[2010] SGHC 352 at [29],\n                    Steven Chong J approved the view (seeSir John Woodroffe\n                        & Syed Amir Ali’s Law of Evidence(V Kesava Rao ed)\n                    (LexisNexis Butterworths Wadhwa Nagpur, 18thed,\n                    2008) at p 4476) that s 108 was: … designed to meet certain exceptional cases in which it would be\n                        impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult, for the [plaintiff]\n                        to establish facts which are ‘especially’ within the knowledge\n                        of the [defendant] and which [the defendant] could prove without difficulty\n                        or inconvenience… The word ‘especially’… means\n                        facts that are pre-eminently or exceptionally within his knowledge. 51     Whether the first defendant had the\n                    “means and resources… to enable him to make the interim\n                    payment” within the meaning of O 29 r 11(2)(b) was a fact especially within the first defendant’s\n                    knowledge, and the first defendant could (dis)prove it without difficulty or\n                    inconvenience, whereas it would be impossible or disproportionately difficult\n                    for the plaintiff to prove it. After all, it was hard to imagine who else but\n                    the first defendant would have knowledge of his financial affairs. Consequently,\n                    the first defendant bore the burden of proving that he was not “a person\n                    whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make the interim\n                    payment”, whether as a particular fact the existence of which he wished\n                    me to believe under s 105 of the EA, or as a fact especially within his\n                    knowledge under s 108 of the EA. 52     I found clear support for this approach inThe “Asia Star”[2010]\n                    2 SLR 1154, a decision of the Court of Appeal on the duty to mitigate\n                    in the context of a breach of a voyage charterparty by the appellant\n                    shipowner’s failure to deliver the chartered vessel. In rejecting the\n                    respondent charterer’s argument that it had acted reasonably in refusing\n                    to spend US$399,500 to engage an alternative available vessel (“thePuma”) and thereby mitigate its loss,\n                    because of its impecuniosity, the Court of Appeal held that the burden of\n                    proving the fact that chartering thePumawould\n                    have been financially prohibitive lay on the respondent, stating (at [63]): In the present case, the respondent wished to rely on the alleged fact\n                        that the additional US$399,500 which it would have had to pay if it had\n                        chartered thePumawas a financially\n                        prohibitive sum that it could not afford –ie,it wanted the court to\n                            believe in the existence of this fact (see s 105 of the Evidence\n                            Act). This fact was “especially within the knowledge of [the\n                            respondent]” for the purposes of s 108 of the Evidence Act\n                            since only the respondent could be fully aware of all the relevant\n                            particulars of its own financial position at the material\n                            time.Thus, … the respondent must\n                            satisfactorily establish with cogent evidence that itwasindeed unable to afford to spend an additional US$399,500\n                            at the material point in time… [emphasis added in bold] Discharging the burden 53     The next question was whether the first\n                    defendant had discharged his burden of proof by adducing evidence that he was\n                    not “a person whose means and resources are such as to enable him to make\n                    the interim payment” under O 29 r 11(2)(b) of the Rules of Court. 54     No affidavit evidence was produced by the\n                    first defendant to prove that he lacked the means and resources to enable him to\n                    make the interim payment. In contrast, as Mr Srinivasan pointed out, the\n                    first defendant had retained KhattarWong throughout these proceedings and those\n                    in the Subordinate Courts (see[14]above),\n                    and I was entitled to presume under s 116(f)\n                    of the EA that, in the common course of business, KhattarWong would have charged\n                    (and the first defendant would have agreed to pay) a not insignificant retainer.\n                    On that basis, I was not persuaded that O 29 r 11(2)(b) of the Rules of Court had been made out by the first\n                    defendant.",
        "Whether to order interim payment and the quantum to be\n                ordered": "55     This issue could be taken relatively shortly.\n                    Since neither O 29 r 11(2)(a) nor\n                        (b) of the Rules of Court applied, it was\n                    appropriate for me to exercise my discretion to order interim payment in view of\n                    the plaintiff’s dire injuries and his consequent need to pay for his\n                    medical treatment, which I was told is ongoing. As for the quantum, Mr Yeo\n                    very fairly conceded at the first hearing that if interim payment was to be\n                    ordered, he would not quarrel with the sum of $80,000.",
        "Whether interim payment was to be paid to the plaintiff\n                personally": "56     This issue initially arose because I\n                    considered it possible that, if s 9 of the Act applied in this case, under\n                        s 9(1)(a), an interim payment obtained by\n                    the plaintiff against the first defendant, being a sum payable under a judgment\n                    in respect of a liability required to be covered by the Policy, had to be paid\n                    by the second defendant to the Public Trustee (see[22]above). 57     However, upon further consideration, it became\n                    clear to me that s 9 of the Act was not being invoked (because the\n                    plaintiff was not making a direct claim against the second defendant but was\n                    merely applying for interim payment against the first defendant) and, unlike\n                    s 8 (see[44]above), had no other\n                    relevance in this case. Therefore, as a matter of course, interim payment was to\n                    be paid by the first defendant to the plaintiff personally. 58     I should add that, thus far, I have not\n                    referred to the first and second defendants’ submission that, under\n                    s 9 of the Act, the second defendant is only obliged to satisfy final and\n                    not interlocutory judgments (see[11]and[13]above). Nonetheless, as both\n                    defendants founded themselves strongly upon this argument, it would be a\n                    disservice to their counsels’ efforts if I did not articulate my reasons\n                    for agreeing with their submissions, albeit only tentatively, because the\n                    question of whether s 9 of the Act applied to interlocutory as well as\n                    final judgments appeared never to have arisen before and I was therefore\n                    unguided by authority on an issue which was not directly pertinent to this\n                    application. 59     First, although s 9 of the Act does not\n                    in terms distinguish between final and interlocutory judgments, some of the\n                    language in s 9,eg, s 9(2)(a) which speaks of a “judgmentfor a sumnot exceeding the relevant amount” [emphasis\n                    added] (see[22]above), more naturally\n                    described final rather than interlocutory judgments (see also\n                        s 9(3)(b) which speaks of\n                    “execution” of the judgment – interlocutory judgments cannot\n                    be enforced (Tan Kim Seng v Ibrahim Victor Adam[2004] 1 SLR(R) 181 at [31])). 60     Second, in virtually all the cases in which\n                    s 9 had been successfully relied upon, the third party had obtained final\n                    judgment against the insured person. Indeed, it was difficult to imagine why the\n                    third party would need to rely on s 9 of the Act to enforce an\n                    interlocutory judgment (obtained against the tortfeasor) against the insurer by\n                    applying for an interim payment to be paid by the insurer to the Public Trustee.\n                    The only situation in which such a course of action was conceivably necessary\n                    was where the insurer had purported to repudiate liability to the insured\n                    person, but such repudiation was rendered ineffectivevis-à-visthe third party due to ss 7 or 8 of the Act, and\n                    the third party had obtained interlocutory judgment and an order for interim\n                    payment against the insured person, who then absconded from jurisdiction. Even\n                    so, however, it was surely more principled to require the third party to avail\n                    himself of the normal measures for executing court orders (to enforce the order\n                    for interim payment), and/or proceed expeditiously to final judgment before\n                    resorting to s 9 of the Act, than to distort the natural language of\n                    s 9 in order to force it to encompass interlocutory\n                judgments. 61     My attention was also drawn toThe Public Trustee Practice Circular 1 of 2004: Administration of\n                        Accident Compensation Monies under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and\n                        Compensation) Act (Cap 189), para 7 of which stated\n                    clearly that “[t]he Public Trustee will not administer any cases for\n                    interim payment only”. Although this was, strictly speaking, an\n                    administrative restriction imposed by the Public Trustee rather than a legal one\n                    under s 9 of the Act, the Public Trustee’s position reinforced the\n                    view that, in practice, there was little or no need for the third party to use\n                    s 9 of the Act to enforce an interlocutory judgment (obtained against the\n                    tortfeasor) against the insurer. 62     Had it been necessary to decide the point,\n                    therefore, I should have thought that s 9 of the Act ought to be construed\n                    as covering only final and not interlocutory judgments. Fortunately, however,\n                    the point did not arise in the present case, and therefore I need say no more\n                    about this issue.",
        "Conclusion": "63     For all the foregoing reasons, I granted the\n                    plaintiff’s application for an interim payment of $80,000 from the first\n                    defendant, pursuant to which I made an order in terms of prayers 1 and 2 of the\n                    summons. 64     Since the plaintiff succeeded against the\n                    first defendant, I ordered that costs of $2,000 be paid by the latter to the\n                    former. However, as the second defendant had been unnecessarily burdened by\n                    these proceedings despite the fact that the plaintiff had no direct claim\n                    against it, I ordered that the plaintiff pay costs of $500 to the second\n                    defendant."
