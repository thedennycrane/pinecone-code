        "The decision below": "3        Section 30 reads:30(1) – Any person who has in his possession any obscene film\n\n    shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to afine of not less\n\n    than $500 for each such filmhe had in his possession (but not to exceed in the\n\n    aggregate $20,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.30(2) Any person who has in his possession any obscene film knowing or\n\n    having reasonable cause to believe the film to be obscene shall be guilty of an offence\n\n    andshall be liable on conviction-(a) to a fine of $1,000 for each such film in his possession (but not\n\n      to exceed in the aggregate $40,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months\n\n      or to both;(b) in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine of not\n\n      less than $2,000 for each such film in his possession (but not to exceed in the aggregate\n\n      $80,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. [emphasis added]4        There are three possible\n\ninterpretations of the phrase \"shall be liable … to a fine of $1,000 for each\n\nsuch film\" in s 30(2)(a). First, a ‘fixed quantum’ of $1,000 must be\n\nimposed. Secondly, the maximum fine which may be imposed is $1,000 and thirdly, the\n\nminimum fined which must be imposed is $1,000. In imposing a fine of $500 per film on Loo,\n\nthe district judge interpreted the phrase to mean that he had a discretion to impose a\n\nmaximum fine of $1,000 per film, i.e. the second possible interpretation.5        The district judge rejected\n\nthe first possible interpretation, i.e. that s 30(2)(a) prescribes a fixed quantum of\n\n$1,000. He found that there was no compelling reason for Parliament to remove the\n\ncourt’s discretion entirely only for the first offence of knowingly possessing\n\nobscene films when it clearly allowed the courts a discretion in sentencing all the other\n\noffences in the Act. In particular, s 30(2)(b) confers a discretion on the courts in\n\nrespect of sentencing repeat offenders of the same offence of knowingly possessing obscene\n\nfilms as it expressly stipulates a mandatory minimum fine of $2,000, subject to an\n\naggregate of $80,000. There should be no reason why the court should have a discretion in\n\nimposing a sentence for repeat offenders, but not first time offenders. Reading s 30(2)(a)\n\nliterally would lead to absurdity for another reason. Under s 30(1), if a person is\n\nconvicted of a strict liability offence of possession of an obscene film, the court has\n\nthe power to impose a fine of at least $500 per film but not exceeding $20,000 in\n\naggregate. It would be absurd if the court must impose a fixed fine of $1,000 for the\n\noffence of knowingly possessing an obscene film while it retains the discretion to impose\n\na fine of more than $1,000 for the lesser offence of mere possession of obscene films.6        As between the second\n\ninterpretation, i.e. that the court has the discretion to impose a maximum fine of $1,000,\n\nand the third interpretation, i.e. that the court has the discretion to impose a minimum\n\nfine of $1,000, the district judge initially chose the second interpretation. He explained\n\nthat he was influenced by the fact that,prima facie, the expression \"shall be\n\nliable\" does not connote any specific mandatory sentence, much less any mandatory\n\nminimum sentence. He relied on the decisions of the High Court inPP v Lee Soon Lee\n\nVincent[1998] 3 SLR 552, at  14, followed inChng Gim Huat v PP[2000] 3 SLR 262for this proposition.7        However, in his grounds, he\n\nadmitted that the second interpretation was not correct. With the benefit of further\n\nresearch and hindsight, he agreed with the contention of the DPP in this revision that the\n\nthird interpretation was the correct one. This was because a speech made in Parliament by\n\nthe Minister for Information and the Arts during the Second Reading of the Films\n\n(Amendment) Bill on 27 February 1998 clarified the intention of Parliament to impose a\n\nmandatory minimum fine of $1,000 for the offence of possession of obscene films. The\n\nMinister made the following statement:Sir, the current penalties are clearly not of sufficient\n\n    deterrence. In this Bill, we are therefore proposing enhanced penalties…..For the\n\n    possession of obscene film and videos, theminimum finewill also be doubled\n\n    from $500 to $1,000 per film, up to a maximum of $40,000. [emphasis mine]",
        "My decision": "8        In my view, the DPP and the\n\ndistrict judge rightly adopted the interpretation that s 30(2)(a) gives the court a\n\ndiscretion to impose a fine of not less than $1,000 per film with an aggregate not\n\nexceeding $40,000.9        The district judge\n\ncorrectly rejected the literal interpretation of s 30(2)(a). He elucidated clearly the\n\nabsurdity and anomaly that would result if a literal interpretation was adopted such that\n\nthe courts’ hands were tied in sentencing because it would have to impose a fixed\n\nfine of $1,000 per film. Such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the approach\n\ntaken by the draftsman in the rest of s 30, as pointed out by the district judge whose\n\nreasoning I have set out at  5.10        The remaining issue was\n\nwhether $1,000 is the maximum or minimum fine that the court can impose when it exercises\n\nits discretion in sentencing. The language of s 30(2)(a) is ambiguous. Difficulties arise\n\nin both interpreting $1,000 as a maximum or minimum fine. The imposition of a maximum fine\n\nof $1,000 appears to be inconsistent with the rest of s 30 which empowers the court to\n\nimpose a discretionary fine subject to a mandatory minimum for all the other offences of\n\npossession of obscene films. On the other hand, the expression \"shall be liable\"\n\ndoes not,prima facie, connote any specific mandatory punishment, such as a fixed\n\nquantum of fine:PP v Lee Soon Lee Vincent.A fortiori, the phrase does not\n\nnecessarily impose a mandatory minimum sentence.11        In the face of the\n\nambiguity in the statutory language, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or\n\nobject underlying s 30(2)(a) would be preferred to one which would not do so: s 9A(1) of\n\nthe Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 1997 ed.). Furthermore, since this s 30(2)(a) is ambiguous\n\nand a literal reading of the provision is manifestly absurd or unreasonable, in view of\n\nits context, purpose and object, I am entitled to take into account any relevant debates\n\nin Parliament to interpret it, pursuant to s 9A(2)(b) read with s 9A(3)(d) of the\n\nInterpretation Act.12        In the present case, the\n\nintention of Parliament in amending s 30(2)(a) was clearly stated in the speech made by\n\nthe Minister for Information and the Arts in Parliament during the Second Reading of the\n\nFilms (Amendment) Bill on 27 February 1998. In the passage of his speech quoted at  7,\n\nthe Minister referred to the doubling of the \"minimum fine\" from $500 to $1,000\n\nper film, up to a maximum of $40,000, for the possession of obscene films, so as to ensure\n\nthat the penalties serve as a sufficient deterrence.13        The Minister’s\n\nreference to the previous minimum fine of $500 was a reference to the old statutory\n\nscheme, i.e. the Films Act (1981 ed.). Section 29(1)(a) of the old Act, which dealt with\n\nthe offence of possession of obscene films, stated that any person who has in his\n\npossession any obscene film shall be guilty of an offence and \"shall be liable on\n\nconviction ….to a fine ofnot less than $500for each such film he had in his\n\npossession (but not to exceed in aggregate $20,000)...\". The wording of the section\n\nclearly and expressly provided for a minimum fine of $500 per film, for the offence of\n\npossession of obscene films.14        Section 30(2)(a) of the\n\npresent Films Act was enacted to put into effect Parliament’s intention to raise the\n\n\"minimum fine\" from $500, as stipulated in s 29(1)(a) of the old Act, to $1,000\n\nper film. Unfortunately, the draftsman of the present Films Act did not retain the clear\n\nwording of s 29(1)(a), i.e. that an offender was liable \"to a fine of not less than\n\n$X\" to reflect the intention of Parliament to retain the scheme of minimum fines.\n\nInstead, the draftsman adopted the ambiguous language of \"shall be liable on\n\nconviction to a fine of $1,000…\". In my view, this was a slip in drafting.\n\nConsequently, the literal reading of s 30(2)(a) does not reflect the true intention of\n\nParliament and should be rejected. Applying s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act, s 30(2)(a)\n\nmust be read to impose a mandatory minimum fine of $1,000 per film for the offence of\n\nknowingly being in possession of obscene films to give effect to the clear and express\n\nintention of Parliament in enacting the subsection.15        For the sake of\n\ncompleteness, it was also necessary to deal with the effect of s 41 of the Interpretation\n\nAct. That section stipulates that:Whenever in any written law a penalty is provided for an\n\n    offence, such provision shall imply that such offence shall be punishable upon conviction\n\n    by a penalty not exceeding (except as may be otherwise expressly mentioned in the written\n\n    law) the penalty provided.A straight application of s 41 of the Interpretation Act to the\n\nconstruction of s 30(2)(a) would mean that a court in sentencing offenders under the\n\nsubsection can only impose a maximum fine of $1,000. The application of s 41 of the\n\nInterpretation Act conflicts with the application of s 9A(1) of the same Act. The DPP\n\ncontended that s 9A(1) should take precedence over s 41. I agreed with him. Section 9A(1)\n\nencapsulates the fundamental and paramount principle that a purposive interpretation of\n\nstatutes is to be preferred as it gives effect to Parliament’s intention. Bearing in\n\nmind that the court’s role in the interpretation and application of the law is to\n\ngive effect to, and not hinder the fulfillment of, Parliament’s intention, s 9A(1)\n\nshould take precedence over any other tools of statutory interpretation, including s 41.\n\nAccordingly, s 41 should not prevent the court from adopting an interpretation of s\n\n30(2)(a) which gives effect to Parliament’s intention to impose a minimum fine of\n\n$1,000 per film.",
        "Conclusion": "16        For the above reasons, I\n\nallowed the petition for criminal revision and enhanced the fine imposed on Loo from $500\n\nto $1,000 per film for each of the three obscene films that he possessed contrary to s\n\n30(2)(a) of the Act, i.e. the total fine imposed was increased from $1,500 to $3,000.\n\nSince Loo had already paid the fines of $1,500 previously imposed on him by the district\n\njudge, he must pay an additional fine of $1,500 or serve 15 days imprisonment in default.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeRepublic of SingaporeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
