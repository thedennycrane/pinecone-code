        "The rules on discovery": "10     The first defendant had applied for the discovery of the documents under O 24 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court, which governs the discovery of particular documents in contradistinction to r 2(1) which applies to the first stage of general discovery. 11     Under r 5(3), a document is subject to particular discovery if it is: (a) a document on which the party relies or will rely; (b) a document which could — (i) adversely affect his own case; (ii) adversely affect another party’s case; or (iii) support another party’s case; and (c) a document which may lead the party seeking discovery of it to a train of inquiry resulting in his obtaining information which may — (i) adversely affect his own case; (ii) adversely affect another party’s case; or (iii) support another party’s case. 12     Particular discovery under r 5(3) differs from general discovery under r 1(2) in that whereas general discovery is restricted to documents under classes (a) and (b), particular discovery also extends to class (c) documents which do not contain the information under class (b), but which may lead to a train of inquiry resulting in obtaining of information under class (b). 13     The entitlement to discovery, whether general or particular, is conditional to the discovery being necessary. Order 24 r 7 stipulates that: the Court may, if satisfied that discovery is not necessary, or not necessary at that stage of the cause or matter, dismiss or, as the case may be, adjourn the application and shall in any case refuse to make such an order if and so far as it is of opinion that discovery is not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs. 14     The operation of the rules of discovery was explained by the Court of Appeal inTan Chin Seng & Ors v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd[2002] 3 SLR 345: 13    [T]he rules governing discovery have undergone some important changes when they were reformed in 1996. Not only was the previous system of mutual discovery by parties after the close of pleadings replaced by a system of discovery by orders of court, the applicable test is also different. The previous test, to determine whether documents should be discovered, was governed by the words ‘relating to any matter in question between them in the action’ found in the previous O 24 r 2(1). This test was elucidated in the often quoted judgment of Brett LJ in the celebrated caseCompagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v Peruvian Guano Co(1882) 11 QBD 55 at 62–63: … documents to be produced are not confined to those, which would be evidence either to prove or to disprove any matter in question in the action … The doctrine seems to me to go farther than that and to go as far as the principle which I am about to lay down. It seems to me that every document relates to the matters in question in the action, which not only would be evidence upon any issue, but also which, it is reasonable to suppose, contains information which may — not which must — either directly or indirectly enable the party [requiring discovery] either to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary … A document can properly be said to contain information which may enable the party [requiring discovery] to advance his own case or to damage the case of his adversary; if it is a document which may fairly lead him to a train of inquiry, which may have either of these two consequences. 14    So documents which were indirectly relevant by reason of their potential to set off ‘a train of inquiry’ resulting in the discovery of evidence of direct relevance were discoverable. But this somewhat open-ended criteria often gave rise to difficulties in application to particular circumstances, abuses or fishing. It also gave rise to a trend of discovering huge volumes of insignificant documents. 15    The criteria adopted by the new rules are more specific. They are set out in O 24 r 1(2): The documents which a party to a cause or matter may be ordered to discover under paragraph (1) are as follows: (a)   the documents on which the party relies or will rely; and (b)   the documents which could — (i) adversely affect his own case; (ii) adversely affect another party’s case; or (iii) support another party’s case. There is, in addition, an overriding principle prescribed in r 7, which is, that the discovery must be ‘necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs’. 16    Documents which are now discoverable, other than those on which a party relies or will rely (r 1(2)(a)), will be those which could (1) adversely affect the party’s own case; (2) adversely affect another party’s case; or (3) support another party’s case. It should be noted that the word there is ‘could’ not ‘would’. So a document which has the ‘potential of affecting’ the party from whom the document is requested, is obliged to discover the same. 17    Thus caution must be exercised when considering decisions which were made under the previous rules because, in the words of Jeffrey Pinsler onSingapore Court PracticeO 24, ‘a document is no longer discoverable merely because there is some connection (irrespective of the nature of the link) between it and the issue in the case’. Documents which were required to be discovered under the concept of ‘train of inquiry’ are no longer discoverable under the present O 24 r 1. However, this is not to say that the concept of ‘train of inquiry’ has been removed from the Rules. It has reappeared in r 5 which relates to discovery of specific documents. 18    However, it must not thereby be taken that cases decided under the previous rules are no longer pertinent. As was the position under the previous rules, one of the essential preconditions to be satisfied before discovery will be ordered is that of ‘relevance’. Whether a document would affect that party’s claim, or adversely affect another party’s case, or support another party’s case, must depend on the issues pleaded in the action. The cases that shed light on ‘relevancy’ are just as useful today. 19    Some of the principles on ‘relevancy’ established by the cases are the following. InThorpe’s case (referred to earlier) it was decided that a document was not discoverable if it was to be used only for the purpose of cross-examination to establish credibility of witnesses. A discovered document can also be blanked out in part if the blanked out portion is irrelevant to the issues of the action:GE Capital Corporate Finance Group v Bankers Trust Co[1995] 2 All ER 993; [1995] 1 WLR 172. The discovery process should not be allowed to ‘fish’ a cause of action: seeWright Norman v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp[1992] 2 SLR 710. Where an allegation is not pleaded, seeking discovery of a document to back up such an allegation constitutes fishing:Marks & Spencer plc v Granada TV(unreported, 8 April 1997). 15     The plaintiff objected to the discovery of the documents in question on the grounds that the classes of documents are too wide and oppressive, and that the documents are not necessary for the fair disposal of the case or for saving costs. 16     I will refer to the application for the documents in (a) to (e) first. The first defendant’s defence is that when he ended his involvement with the plaintiff in March 2001, the plaintiff was financially sound. His defence is that the plaintiff’s subsequent financial weakness had resulted from decisions and actions taken after March 2001. These documents come under r 5(3)(b) and (c). 17     Are they too wide and oppressive? That argument was made before me and led me to restrict the discovery to documents in respect of any expenditure or payments over S$500,000.00 made by the plaintiff out of the plaintiff’s cash and/or assets. 18     Width and oppression should be viewed in the context of the circumstances. Discovery ofalldocuments in the classes would be too wide and oppressive, as it would extend to documents which do not relate to the plaintiff’s financial activities, and it may be oppressive if it extends to every expenditure and payment of the plaintiff. The $500,000 qualification narrows the discovery to matters and documents which had a significant impact on the plaintiff’s finances. The restricted discovery of these documents is not too wide or oppressive, and comes properly under r 5(3). 19     The documents under (f) are of a different nature. The ‘China exploration’ expenditure is not directly in issue as it was incurred after March 2001. The first defendant was not involved with it, and there was no allegation by the plaintiff that the expenditure was improper or excessive. However, the documents fall under r 5(3)(a) because they enable a comparison to be made between payments for consultancy services made for the ‘China exploration’ project over which the plaintiff has no complaints, and the payments for consultancy services rendered by the first defendant, which the plaintiff alleges to be unreasonable and unjustified. 20     Is the discovery of the documents necessary for disposing fairly of the action or for saving costs? Taking into consideration the substantial claims, the financial resources of the parties and the tenacity with which the action has been conducted by the parties, it is very likely that the facts and issues will be fully examined and contested at the trial. Documents relevant to the issues will be identified, and their production will be sought. Documents produced in the course of a trial can result in long and unfocused examination because of counsel’s unfamiliarity with the documents and lack of preparation. Another consequence may be that time has to be given for the documents to be studied, and where necessary, referred to experts. This would disrupt the progress of the hearing and add to the length and the costs of the trial. The discovery of the documents in the circumstances is necessary for disposing fairly of the action and for saving costs."
