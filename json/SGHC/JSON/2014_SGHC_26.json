        "Introduction": "1       This\nis an appeal against the decision of the learned Assistant Registrar\nKan Shuk Weng (“the AR”) in Summons No 2743 of 2013 (“SUM 2743/2013”)\ngiven on 25 July 2013. SUM 2743/2013 concerned a discovery order\nfor certain documents which were allegedly covered by the Official Secrets\nAct (Cap 213, 2012 Rev Ed) (“OSA”). After hearing the arguments of\nboth parties, with consideration given especially to the fact that\nthe OSA was involved, I am dismissing the appeal and I now give\nmy reasons.",
        "Background facts": "2       The\nplaintiff, Elbow Holdings Pte Ltd (“the Plaintiff”), is a private limited\nliability company incorporated in Singapore. The Plaintiff owns\nand operates an “Australian themed” bar and bistro called “South\nCoast Bar & Bistro” at Units “#01-R7” and “#B1-R7” of the Marina\nBay Sands Shoppes Singapore (“the Premises”). The Premises were\nsubsequently renamed “The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands”. The unit\nnumbers have also been renamed as “#01-85” and “#01-85 at B1 level”\nrespectively. It appears that Unit “#01-85” is a kiosk located on\nthe Promenade (“the Promenade Kiosk”), whereas Unit “#01-85 at B1\nlevel” is a basement kitchen (“the Basement Kitchen”) used to serve\nthe Promenade Kiosk. 3       The\ndefendant, Marina Bay Sands Pte Ltd (“the Defendant”), is a private\nlimited liability company incorporated under the laws of Singapore. It\nmanages The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. 4       The\ndispute between the parties in the main suit, Suit No 954 of 2012 (“S\n954/2012”), arises in connection with a lease agreement for the\nPremises (as well as the actual lease itself) which was signed by\nthe parties on or around 8 March 2010 (“the Lease Agreement”). The\nWrit of Summons and Statement of Claim were issued by the Plaintiff\non 7 November 2012. The Defence and Counterclaim was filed on 3\nDecember 2012 and subsequently amended on 3 January 2013. This was\nfollowed by the Plaintiff’s Reply and Defence to Counterclaim filed\non 20 December 2012 and further amended on 18 January 2013. 5       The\nPlaintiff’s case is advanced on two fronts, briefly summarised as follows.\nFirst, the Plaintiff argues that it was induced into concluding\nthe Lease Agreement as a result of certain representations alleged\nto have been made by or on behalf of the Defendant during the pre-signing\nnegotiations. These representations essentially concerned the right\nof the Plaintiff to use certain outdoor areas, and for the ease\nof convenience, these representations will be referred to as “the\nOutdoor Space Representations”. The Plaintiff’s assertion is that\nthe Outdoor Space Representations were false, and on this basis,\nit has brought a claim against the Defendant for relief under s\n2 of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed). In addition,\nthe Plaintiff has also brought a claim for breach of a collateral contract\n(where the Defendant was said to have permitted the Plaintiff to use\nthe outdoor spaces) as well as a claim based on proprietary estoppel. Without\ndelving into the precise details and substantive merits of the main action,\nthe Plaintiff is essentially alleging that the space it was entitled\nto use turned out to be much less than what they had been led to\nbelieve. This, of course, is denied by the Defendant. 6       The\nsecond front advanced by the Plaintiff is the assertion that the Defendant\nhad committed a number of breaches in relation to the Lease Agreement:\nnamely, breach of an express and/or implied covenant in the Lease\nAgreement that the Defendant possessed a leasehold interest in the Premises,\nbreach of an express term or covenant of the Lease Agreement that\nthe term of the Lease was to be for a period of six years, as well\nas a general assertion of repudiatory breach of the Lease Agreement. 7       On\n29 May 2013 the Plaintiff, by way of SUM 2743/2013, took out an application\nfor specific discovery of certain documents. Subject to some minor\nvariations, the AR on 25 July 2013 allowed the Plaintiff’s application. The\nDefendant is now appealing against the decision of the AR. Before\nI turn to the applicable legal principles, it will be helpful to\nfirst set out the background to the dispute (insofar as it is relevant\nto the claim for specific discovery) so as to provide the proper\ncontext in which the application for specific discovery was made.",
        "The parties’ pleaded case": "8       In\nits Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff asserts that prior to the conclusion\nof the Lease Agreement, the Plaintiff and the Defendant were engaged\nin negotiations on the commercial and legal terms of the lease.[note: 1]These negotiations were said to have\ncommenced in around March 2009 and were only concluded about a year\nlater. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant made a number of\nrepresentations during the course of negotiations concerning the\nPlaintiff’s right, as tenant of the Premises, to use certain outdoor\nspaces without further payment. The essence of the representations\nwas that the Plaintiff would have the use of the “biggest outdoor\narea along the Marina Bay Sands Promenade”, which would “be able\nto accommodate hundreds of customers drinking all the way to the waterfront\nedge of the Promenade.”[note: 2]The Outdoor Space Representations were\nallegedly made both orally and in writing by a number of alleged agents\nof the Defendant. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant induced the\nPlaintiff to believe throughout the course of negotiations that\nit had a right to use the outdoor space area around and at the front\nof the Kiosk.[note: 3]It was on the basis of these\nOutdoor Space Representations that the Plaintiff entered into the\nAgreement for Lease (and also the Lease itself) on 8 March 2010\nand thereafter commenced design and fitting works for the establishment\nof the South Coast Bar & Bistro. 9       Subsequently\n(between April and June 2010), the Plaintiff was informed by the\nDefendant that the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) had imposed\nrestrictions over the use of the outdoor spaces described as Outdoor\nAreas A, B and C.[note: 4]In mid-June 2010, the Defendant was\ngranted a Temporary Occupation Licence (“TOL”) to occupy Outdoor Areas\nA and B on a monthly basis. The TOL did not allow the construction of\nany pergolas or other cover over the outdoor seating areas. Later,\nin November 2011, the Defendant instructed the Plaintiff to stop\nusing Outdoor Area B and to remove all outdoor furniture in that\narea.[note: 5]Finally, on or about\n29 February 2012, the URA amended the TOL, limiting the area of\nuse that is subject to the TOL to just Outdoor Area A. The Plaintiff’s\ncase is that the Defendant never informed the Plaintiff during the\nlease negotiations that URA approval was necessary for the Plaintiff’s\nuse and occupation of the outdoor areas. 10     The\nDefendant denies most of the alleged representations and specifically\nasserts in its Defence and Counterclaim dated 3 January 2013 that\nthe Plaintiff had been informed that its use of the outdoor areas\nwas subject to the approval of both the Defendant and the URA.[note: 6]Indeed, the Defendant asserts\nthat:[note: 7] … the Plaintiff knew that The Shoppes at\nMarina Bay Sands was a new development under construction and accordingly,\nthe lease of the Premises (including the conditions relating thereto)\nwould be subject to the approval of the Government of the Republic\nof Singapore (the “State”) and/or relevant authorities. ... 11     The\nDefendant is also relying on the Entire Agreement Clause in the Lease\nAgreement to exclude any representations that may have been made in\nthe course of negotiations. This includes: (a)     Clause\n6.18.1 which states,inter alia,\nthat: The STB [Singapore Tourism Board] is seized\nof the Land to be comprised in a State Lease (“Head Lease”) to be\nissued in favour of the STB by the President of the Republic of\nSingapore ... for a leasehold estate for an unexpired portion of\na term of 60 years… (b)     Clause\n6.18.2 which states that: The Landlord [Marina Bay Sands] has an\ninterest in the Land on which the Development is situated comprised\nin a superior Lease granted or to be granted by the STB to the Landlord\n... (c)     Clause\n6.12.2 which states that: The Landlord is not bound by any representations\nor promises with respect to the Development or the Premises if they\nare not stated in the Entire Agreement whether written or oral,\nexpress or implied by common law, statute, or custom… (d)     Clause\n6.12.3 which states that: The Tenant confirms that it has not agreed\nto, or executed this Lease relying on any representations made by\nthe Landlord or on its behalf which is not stated in the Entire\nAgreement. 12     Leaving\naside (for the moment) the claims brought in respect of the Outdoor\nSpace Representations, a number of connected issues arise in this case\nconcerning: (i) the right or title of the Defendant to enter into\nthe Lease Agreement (and the Lease) (“the Title Term”); and (ii)\nthe obligation to provide the Plaintiff with a lease of the Premises\nfor a period of six years (“the Duration Term”). 13     Put\nat its most basic, the Plaintiff claims that the Defendant did not\nin fact possess the leasehold interest in the Premises at the time\nwhen it signed the Lease Agreement with the Plaintiff[note: 8]and that the Defendant had committed\nan anticipatory breach of the Duration Term on 11 June 2012 when\nthe Plaintiff was informed by the Defendant that alicencefor\nUnit “#01-R7” [“#01-85”] would be issued for the remainder of the\nterm of the Lease. 14     With\nrespect to the claim that the Defendant had breached the express/implied\nTitle Term, the Plaintiff has made reference to the Development\nAgreement (“DA”) between the Defendant and the Government of Singapore,\nas well as the Head Lease and the Superior Lease.[note: 9]At this juncture, it is noted\nthat the DA was concluded between the Defendant and the Singapore\nTourism Board (“STB”). Whether the STB is to be regarded as the\nGovernment or as having concluded the contract on behalf of the\nGovernment is a matter in dispute. The Defendant denies any breach\nof the express/implied Title Term and further asserts that the email communication\nwith the Plaintiff on 11 June 2012 was made in the context of an\nagreement between both parties to restructure their relationship.[note: 10]In brief, the Defendant asserts\nthat the Plaintiff was informed “in or around” 2010 that the Letter\nof Offer and Lease might have to be amended as a result of the discussions\ntaking place between the Defendant and the URA. In February 2011,\nit is said that the Plaintiff was informed that the parties may have\nto execute new commercial documents. Subsequently, on around 23 May\n2011, it is pleaded that the State and the Defendant had entered\ninto a licence agreement which contained the terms and conditions\ngoverning the use of the waterfront promenade area (where the Promenade\nKiosk was located). This agreement was effective from 15 October\n2010. In view of the State licence, the Defendant asserts that it\nprepared documents to vary the terms of the Letter of Offer and\nLease Agreement, such that the Basement Kitchen would remain the\nsubject matter of alease, whereas\nthe Promenade Kiosk would be the subject matter of alicencewith effect from 3 December 2010.\nThese documents were said to have been delivered to the Plaintiff\n(via email) on 11 June 2012. It is also claimed that the Plaintiff\nhad accepted and agreed to the variation.",
        "The hearing below – documents\nrequested by specific discovery and the decision of the AR": "15     SUM\n2743/2013 was an application by the Plaintiff for specific discovery\npursuant to O 24 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)\n(“ROC”). The documents requested were set out in the Schedule to\nthe Summons and organised under nine categories. For convenience,\nthe nine categories and a few of the sub-paragraphsub-paragraphs\n(of especial importance) are set out below: (1)Documents relating to the leasehold interest held by the Defendant over\nthe Premises (as defined at paragraph 1 of the Statement of Claim filed\non 7 November 2012 … including but not limited to: (i)the Development Agreement between the Defendant and the Government\nof Singapore and the documents evidencing the Defendant’s efforts\nin obtaining clearance from the Singapore Tourism Board to disclose\nthe same; … (2)Documents evidencing whether the Defendant had a sufficient leasehold\ninterest in the Premises to make an offer to grant the Lease to the\nPlaintiff as at 17 February 2010 including but not limited to … (3)Documents evidencing whether the Defendant\nhad a sufficient leasehold interest in the Premises to grant the\nLease to the Plaintiff on or after 8 March 2010 including but not\nlimited to … (4)Documents relating to the Defendant’s\nfailure to countersign or execute a counterpart of the Lease, including\nbut not limited to … (5)Documents evidencing that the URA\nrequired the “surrender” of the Premises as stated in the email\nfrom the Defendant to the Plaintiff dated 23 July 2012 (6:12PM)\nincluding but not limited to: (i)Correspondence (including but not limited to letters, faxes, emails\nand/or memoranda) between: a.    the\nDefendant’s employees; b.    the Defendant and its agent(s); c.    the Defendant and the URA whether directly\nor through agent(s) of the Defendant; and d.    the Defendant and other parties whether\ndirectly or through agent(s) of the Defendant. (ii)Minutes of meetings, telephone attendance notes and/or other records\nof communication between: a.    the\nDefendant’s employees; b.    the Defendant and its agent(s); and c.    the Defendant and the URA whether directly\nor through agent(s) of the Defendant; and d.    the Defendant and other parties whether\ndirectly or through agent(s) of the Defendant. (6)Documents relating to the use of the Outdoor Seating Areas\n… including but not limited to … (7)Documents relating to the use of the\nOutdoor Standing Area … including but not limited to … (8)Documents relating to the provision\nof shelter over the Outdoor Seating Areas … including but not limited\nto … (9)Documents relating to the design of\nthe Premises and the Outdoor Seating Areas including but not limited\nto … 16     The\nSummons for specific discovery was heard by the AR on 17 July 2013.\nThe AR, at [4] of her oral judgment delivered on 25 July 2013, was\nof the view that the documents sought to be discovered were relevant\nto the proceedings between the parties. Indeed, the AR commented\nthat the requested documents were similar in nature to those already\ndisclosed by the Defendant in its List of Documents filed on 6 March\n2013 and the Plaintiff’s List of Documents filed on 13 March 2013.\nThat being so, the AR rejected the Defendant’s arguments that were\nlargely based on irrelevance and failure by the Plaintiff to demonstrate\nthat the documents were in the possession, custody or power of the\nDefendant. In this regard, the main issue before the AR concerned\nthe possible application of s 5 of the OSA to the documents covered\nby categories 1(i) and 5 of the Schedule (as set out above in [15]).\n These concerned (in the main): (a)     the\nDA between the Defendant and the STB; (b)     documents\nrelating to the Defendant’s efforts to obtain clearance from STB\nto disclose the same; and (c)     documents\nevidencing that the URA had required the “surrender” of the Premises\nas stated in the email from the Defendant to the Plaintiff dated\n23 July 2012. 17     After\nconsidering the submissions of both parties, the AR held (at [19])\nthat s 5 of the OSA did not apply and that in any case, there was\nno evidence before the court to show that the documents were obtained\nor given under official confidence. There was also no evidence from\nany Government official that public interests would suffer if the\ndocuments and correspondence were disclosed. 18     As\na result, the AR allowed the Plaintiff’s application (subject to\nsome minor amendments). The minor amendments concerned limiting\nthe meaning of the phrase “agent to the Defendant’s agents referred\nto in the pleadings”. 19     On\n7 August 2013, the Defendant appealed against the whole of the AR’s\ndecision by way of Registrar’s Appeal No 275 of 2013 (“RA 275/2013”).\nShortly before the hearing of RA 275/2013, the Defendant informed\nthe Plaintiff and this court that it would only be proceeding with the\nappeal in respect of categories 1(i) and 5 of the Schedule. 20     RA\n275/2013 was first heard by me on 9 September 2013. After hearing\nthe arguments and submissions of both parties, the matter was adjourned\nfor parties to prepare further submissions on the applicability\nof the OSA and s 125 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) in\nrelation to the definition of the phrase “affairs of State”. The\nhearing resumed on 8 November 2013 and I reserved judgment upon\nthe conclusion of the hearing.",
        "Issues before this court": "21     Order\n24 rule 5(1) of the ROC permits a party to apply for an order for\ndiscovery of specific documents or a specific class of documents\nwithin the possession, custody or power of another party. Discovery\nwill only be granted if the conditions set out in O 24 r 5(3) are\nsatisfied. In brief, this requires the document over which discovery\nis sought to be one which could adversely affect his own case or\nthe case of another party or which might support another party’s\ncase. This includes documents that may lead to a “train of inquiry”\nresulting in the obtaining of further information which may adversely\naffect his own case or another party’s case or support another party’s\ncase. 22     It\nis noted that even if the requirements of O 24 r 5 are satisfied\nby the applicant, the court still retains a discretion under O 24\nr 7 to reject the application for discovery on the basis that it\nis not necessary at that stage of the cause or matter, or at all.Singapore Civil Procedure 2013(G P Selvam gen\ned) (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2013) explains at para 24/7/1 that\nO 24 r 7 sets out the overriding principle that discovery must be\nnecessary for either the fair disposal of the matter or the saving\nof costs. That said, once the applicant has established relevancy,\nthe burden lies on the respondent to demonstrate that discovery\nis not necessary for the fair disposal of the matter, or for the\nsaving of costs. 23     The\ntwo issues before me are, therefore, as follows: (a)     First,\nare the documents requested for relevant for the fair disposal of\nthe matter or the saving of costs? (“Issue 1”) (b)     Second,\neven if they are relevant, are the documents protected by the OSA\nsuch that they should not be disclosed? (“Issue 2”)",
        "Issue 1 – Relevance of the documents\nrequested": "24     Category\n1(i) is essentially concerned with the DA signed by the Defendant\nand the STB. The Plaintiff’s case is that the DA is relevant to\nthe issues that have arisen — in particular, the question as to\nthe nature of the interest which the Defendant possessed in respect\nof the Premises and the assertion that the URA had required the\nsurrender of the Premises. In this respect, it will be recalled\nthat the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant includes the breach\nof an express and/or implied Title Term in that the Defendant did\nnot in fact possess the requisite leasehold interest in the Premises\nto conclude the Agreement for Lease and the Lease itself.[note: 11]Furthermore, a claim is also made\nfor the anticipatory breach of the Duration Term by reason of the\nissuance of alicencefor the remainder\nof the term with respect to Unit “#01-R7”.[note: 12] 25     Insofar\nas the DA between the Defendant and the STB is concerned, there\nappears to be little doubt as to its relevance to the pleaded issues. Indeed,\nit appears from the Defendant’s written submissions (on appeal) that\nthe crux of its argument in relation to the DA was not so much of\nits relevance, but as to whether the DA was protected from discovery\nby virtue of the OSA and other related arguments. 26     On\nthe question of relevance, the position in respect of the documents evidencing\nthe efforts made by the Defendant to obtain clearance from STB is\nfar less clear. In this regard, the Defendant maintains the position\nthat these documents are not relevant to the pleaded issues. Counsel\nfor the Defendant submits that the arguments made by the Plaintiff\nbefore the AR only concerned relevance in relation to the DA and\nnot relevance with regard to the Defendant’s efforts to obtain clearance.\nLooking at the matter afresh, it is not immediately apparent to\nthis court as to how the documents relating to the Defendant’s efforts\nto obtain clearance are relevant or indeed, if relevant, why it\nis necessary for these documents to be disclosed at this stage of\nthe proceedings for either the fair disposal of the matter or the saving\nof costs. 27     In\nany event, at the hearing before me on 9 September 2013, the Plaintiff\nstated that it was no longer pursuing the discovery of documents relating\nto the efforts made by the Defendant to obtain clearance from the STB,\nbut that this was without prejudice to their right to file a fresh application\nfor specific discovery of the same at a later stage in the proceedings. 28     I\nturn now to consider the issue of relevance in relation to the documents\nevidencing that the URA had required the “surrender” of the Premises\nas stated in the email dated 23 July 2012 (“URA Surrender Documents”)\nfrom the Defendant to the Plaintiff. 29     Leaving\naside possible objections on the grounds of the OSA and other related\narguments, the relevance and necessity for disclosing the URA Surrender\nDocuments is contested by the Defendant. In the first place, counsel\nfor the Defendant submits that the Plaintiff merely made a bare assertion\nthat the documents were in the Defendant’s possession, custody or\npower. In any case, the Defendant points out that it had already informed\nthe Plaintiff by way of a letter dated 9 May 2013 that save for\nthe Request for Proposal and the DA, there are no further documents evidencing\nURA’s request for the Premises to be surrendered. In this regard,\nthe Defendant adds that the application for the discovery of the URA\nSurrender Documents was no more than a “fishing expedition”, especially\nin light of the broad terms in which the order was sought: all communications\nbetween the Defendant’s employees, the Defendant and its agents(s),\nthe Defendant and the URA whether directly or through agent(s) of\nthe Defendant and the Defendant andother partieswhether directly\nor through agent(s) of the Defendant. It was for this reason (as described\nin the Defendant’s written submissions) that the AR limited the scope\nof discovery under this category to documents with the URA, the Defendant’s\nemployees, and their respective agents as specified in the pleadings.\nThe AR declined to order discovery with respect to the documents\nwith “other parties.” 30     Given\nthe clear statement by the Defendant that it does not have any other\ndocuments relating to the URA Surrender Documents and the absence\nof any evidence to the contrary, the documents under this category are\n(at least for the time being) confined to the DA and the Request\nfor Proposal. The DA is also a document sought under Category 1(i)\nand the main objection that remains is the claim for protection\nunder the OSA and other related arguments. The Request for Proposal\n(which appears to be a document that predates and relates to the\nDA) is similarly subject to a claim for privilege under the OSA.",
        "Issue 2 – The Development Agreement\nand the OSA": "31     Section\n5(1) and (2) of the OSA provides as follows: Wrongful\ncommunication, etc., of information 5.—(1) If any person having in his possession or control any\nsecret official code word, countersign or password, or any photograph,\ndrawing, plan, model, article, note, document or information which\n— (a)    relates\nto or is used in a prohibited place or anything in such a place; (b)    relates to munitions of war; (c)    has been made or obtained in contravention\nof this Act; (d)    has been entrusted in confidence to\nhim by any person holding office under the Government; or (e)    he has obtained, or to which he has\nhad access, owing to his position as a person who holds or has held\noffice under the Government, or as a person who holds, or has held\na contract made on behalf of the Government or any specified organisation,\nor as a person who is or has been employed under a person who holds\nor has held such an office or contract, does any of the following: (i)    communicates\ndirectly or indirectly any such information or thing as aforesaid\nto any foreign Power other than a foreign Power to whom he is duly\nauthorised to communicate it, or to any person other than a person\nto whom he is authorised to communicate it or to whom it is his\nduty to communicate it; (ii)   uses any such information or thing\nas aforesaid for the benefit of any foreign Power other than a foreign\nPower for whose benefit he is authorised to use it, or in any manner\nprejudicial to the safety or interests of Singapore; (iii)   retains in his possession or control\nany such thing as aforesaid when he has no right to retain it, or\nwhen it is contrary to his duty to retain it, or fails to comply\nwith all lawful directions issued by lawful authority with regard\nto the return or disposal thereof; (iv)   fails to take reasonable care of,\nor so conducts himself as to endanger the safety or secrecy of,\nany such information or thing as aforesaid, that person shall be guilty of an offence (2)    If\nany person receives any secret official code word, countersign, password,\nor any photograph, drawing, plan, model, article note, document or\ninformation knowing, or having reasonable ground to believe, at\nthe time when he receives it, that the code word, countersign, password,\nphotograph, drawing, plan, model, article note, document or information\nis communicated to him in contravention of this Act, he shall be\nguilty of an offence unless he proves that the communication to\nhim of  the code word, countersign, password, photograph, drawing,\nplan, model, article note, document or information was contrary\nto his desire. 32     The\ncase for the Defendant, put simply, is that the DA signed by the Defendant\nand the STB is a document that falls within s 5(1) of the OSA and\nthat the Defendant obtained the document as a person who holds a contract\nmade on behalf of the Government or any specified organisation. That\nbeing so, the Defendant asserts that disclosure of the DA by the Defendant\nto the Plaintiff will be an offence by virtue of s 5(1)(e) and (i)\nof the OSA. 33     It\nis clear that for s 5(1)(e) to apply, it is necessary to establish\nthe following elements: (a)     Possession\nor control of (i) any secret official code word, countersign or\npassword or (ii) any photograph, drawing, plan, model, article,\nnote, document or information (“the Protected Material”);, and (b)     That\nthe person with possession or control, had obtained or has had access\nto the Protected Material owing to his position as a person who\nholds or has held office under the Government, or as a person who\nholds, or has held a contract made on behalf of the Government or\nany specified organisation, or as a person who is or has been employed\nunder a person who holds or has held such an office or contract.",
        "The relevant protected material": "34     InPublic Prosecutor v Bridges Christopher[1997]\n3 SLR(R) 467 (“Bridges”), the respondent,\na lawyer, was convicted by the District Court of six charges under\nthe OSA. 35     The\nfirst group of three charges was for offences under s 5(2) of the OSA,\nwhile the second group of three charges was for offences under s 5(1)(c)(i)\nof the OSA. All six charges arose from the fact that the respondent\nhad received, from a Police Staff Sergeant in the Criminal Investigation\nDepartment (“the PSS”), information as to the change of addresses\nof certain persons who were named in the charges. These persons were\nindividuals with whom another lawyer (a friend and relative of the respondent)\nwas having problems serving court documents on account that they\nhad changed their addresses. On three different occasions, the other lawyer\nrequested the respondent’s assistance to determine the latest addresses\nof four individuals. The respondent was able to obtain and supply the\ninformation as requested to the lawyer/friend. At the trial, it\nwas not disputed that the respondent had obtained the information\nfrom the PSS. What was unclear was how the PSS had obtained the\nupdated addresses. There were a number of possibilities: (i) The\ninformation could have been obtained by the PSS from the National\nRegistration Office’s on-line system with the assistance of an analyst\nteam. This on-line system was secret and could not be accessed by\nmembers of the public. (ii) From the Registry of Vehicles, provided\nthe car licence plate number was known. (iii) From the Registry\nof Land Titles and Deeds by way of a title search of the property with\nthe mukim, lot number or address. (iv) By searching (which is said\nto be a laborious process) the 1992 electoral registers. (v) With\nthe assistance of private search agencies. 36     The\nHigh Court quashed the convictions on the basis that the Prosecution\nhad failed to prove that the information relating to the change of\naddresses was or had been “secret official” and because the Prosecution had\nnot established even aprima faciecase\nthat the information was official information protected by the OSA.\nThe High Court also found that the respondent lacked the necessarymens rearequired to establish an offence under\ns 5(2) and s 5(1)(c)(i) of the OSA. 37     Following\nthe High Court judgment, the Public Prosecutor applied under s 60\nof the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1985 Rev Ed) to\nreserve eight questions of law of public interest for the Court\nof Appeal (subsequently recast into six questions by the High Court).\nOne question raised was whether information that has been published,\nreleased or made available to the public by a person authorised\nto do so nevertheless remains information falling within s 5 of\nthe OSA. On this, M Karthigesu JA (delivering the judgment for the\nCourt of Appeal) held (at [35]) that: As a matter of construction the collocation\nof words in s 5(1) of the Act logically fall into two groups: “any\nsecret official code word, countersign or password” is one group\n(“the first group”) and the other group is, “any photograph, drawing,\nplan, model, article, note, document or information” (“the second\ngroup)”. ... 38     The\nimportant point that follows is that items in the second group do not\nnecessarily have to be “secret official” in order to fall within\ns 5(1) of the OSA. Whether items in the second group fall within\ns 5(1) depends on whether one or more of sub-paragraphs (a)–(e)\nare applicable. One example illustrating the operation of s 5(1)\nand the second group given by the Court of Appeal was a photograph.\nIn order for a photograph to be covered under the OSA, it does not\nhave to be a “secret official” photograph as such. Whether s 5(1)\napplies depends on whether one or more of the sub-paragraphs apply.\nFor example, a photograph of a military camp would be covered not\nbecause it is “secret official” but because it “relates to … a prohibited\nplace” (assuming that the military camp in question is a prohibited\nplace). If so, the photograph will fall within s 5(1)(a). Where\nan item within the second group falls within one or more of the\nsub-paragraphs (a)–(e), an offence will have been committed if the\nitem (eg, a photograph) was used\nin one of the ways specified in paragraphs (i)–(iv) of s 5(1) (with\nthe requisitemens rea). 39     It\nfollows that in the present case, in order for s 5(1) of the OSA\nto apply, it is necessary to show that the DA (which is essentially\na document) is caught by one or more of sub-paragraphs (a)–(e) of\ns 5(1). In this case, the relevant sub-paragraph is (e). 40     Before\nI turn to consider the parties’ submissions on sub-paragraph (e),\nit will be convenient to first deal with a point of law that has\narisen in connection with s 5(1) as a whole. This concerns whether\ninformation that is already in the public domain can be the subject\nmatter of a charge under s 5 of the OSA.",
        "Information in the public domain": "41     In\ntheBridgesdecision, M Karthigesu\nJA at [39] postulates that: ... Information may be in the public domain\n(a) because its knowledge is universal like “the sun rises in the\neast”; or (b) information initially “protected” by s 5 being information\nwhich a public servant learns in the course of his public or official\nduty entering the public domain by the authority of the appropriate\ngovernment authority. As the Public Prosecutor says the Act does\nnot apply to this kind of information. Information which indisputedly\n[sic] is already in the public domain\ncould never beobtained in contravention of\nthe Act. An essential ingredient of the offence would\nalways be lacking. The same applies to information initially “protected”\nby the Act entering the public domain. The former category of information\nbecause of its universality belies proof while information in the\nlatter category raises a question of fact to be proved or disproved.\nEven the poster advertising beer with a photograph of a swimsuit\nclad model … would not be a photograph “protected” under s 5(1)(a)\nsimply because it is used as decoration in the mess of an army camp.\nIt must be shown torelate to or that it was\nused in a prohibited placeor anything in such a place\n… which is a matter of proof, the onus of which is on the Prosecution. [emphasis in original] 42     The\nrespondent inBridgeswas prosecuted\nfor an offence under s 5(2) of the OSA for receiving information\nknowing or having reasonable ground to believe that, at the time\nwhen he received it, the information was communicated to him in\ncontravention of the OSA. It followed that, to succeed, the Prosecution\nwould have to first prove that the communication by the PSS to the\nrespondent was “in contravention of the Act”. This would require\nshowing that the communication by the PSS was itself caught under s 5(1)(d)\nor (e) read together with s 5(1)(i) of the OSA. In short, as M Karthigesu\nJA held at [40], this would require proof that the PSS had (i) obtained\nthe information from an official government source in his capacity\nas a field intelligence officer; and (ii) communicated the information\nto the respondent, a person to whom the PSS was not authorised to\ncommunicate it to (or to whom it was not his duty to communicate\nit). If so, the PSS would have committed an offence under s 5(1)\nof the OSA. The liability of the PSS in this way would be that of\na “giver” of the information. The liability of the respondent, if\nany, was that of a “receiver” under s 5(2). This would require proof\nof not only receipt, but specifically receipt with the necessarymens rea(knowing or having reasonable\ngrounds to believe that the communication was in contravention of\nthe OSA).  On the evidence, the Court of Appeal held (at [44]) that\nthe Prosecution had failed to prove that the respondent had reasonable\ngrounds to believe that the information given to him was “protected”\ninformation. Thus, it was said that “this vital element in the ingredient\nof themens rearequired to be proved\nby the Prosecution was notprima facieproved”. 43     The\nrespondent inBridgeswas also prosecuted\nfor an offence under s 5(1)(c)(i) for having himself communicated\nthe information to the “other lawyer”. This also required proof\nof the necessarymens rea: knowledge\nthat the information had been obtained by the respondent in contravention\nof the OSA and knowledge that he had no authority or duty to communicate the\ninformation to the “other lawyer”. By “protected information”, the Court\nof Appeal meant that the information “wasobtainedby\nthe communicator in contravention of the Act and that it wascommunicatedto another in contravention\nof the Act”. It was in this context that M Karthigesu JA at [45]\ncommented that “mere possession of the ‘protected’ information …\ndoes not constitute an offence”. It is very likely that this is also\nthe context in which Question 1(b) of the criminal reference was answered.\nThat question, it will be recalled, asks whether: … information that has been published,\nreleased or made available to the public by a person authorised\nto do so nevertheless remain information falling within s 5 of the\nOSA? 44     The\n“negative” answer given by the Court of Appeal at [60] must be understood\nin this context. The statement by the Court of Appeal at [39] was\nthat information in the public domain (such as the fact that the\nsun always rises in the east) could never be obtained in contravention\nof the OSA. Given that such information could be obtained from a\nmyriad of public sources (or what is commonly referred to as “general\nknowledge”), how could the Prosecution ever prove that the information\nhad been obtained in contravention of the OSA? In such cases, as\nM Karthigesu JA stated at [39], the universality of the information\nin such a case belies proof. The position in other cases where the\ninformation was initially protected but which had subsequently become\npublic knowledge was different in that the Prosecution might still\nbe able to establish the necessary elements laid out in s 5(1)(a)–(e)\nand s 5(2). The example given was the use of a photograph depicting\na swimsuit model as a decoration in an army camp. The Prosecution\nwould have to prove that the information (ie,\nthe poster and depicted images) was covered by one of the limbs\nunder s 5(1), such as information which “relates to or is used in\na prohibited place”. If so, the information could still be “protected”\nin the sense of falling within s 5(1)(a)–(e) and an offence could\nstill be made out under s 5(1)(i) or s 5(2), subject to the requisitemens reabeing established. 45     In\nthe present case, the Plaintiff claimed that it was able to obtain (whattheystated seemed to be) a copy of the\nDA (as well as a copy of the Supplemental Agreement to the DA dated\n11 August 2009) by way of an online Internet search. As deposed\nat para 9 of Aaron Joseph Kearney’s affidavit filed on behalf of\nthe Plaintiff on 25 June 2013 (“AJK-1”), the contents of the agreements\nwere also said to have been disclosed in Las Vegas Sands Corporation’s\nAnnual Report for 2011 (“2011 Annual Report”). In reply, the Defendant\nhas explained (at para 8 of the affidavit filed by Fang Fu-Cun Kevin\non behalf of the Defendant on 10 July 2013) that the “limited disclosure”\nwas required by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\nand any disclosure was for this purpose only. Whilst there may be\nsome uncertainty as to whether the online copies that the Plaintiff\nhas been able to locate are accurate copies of the DA, there is no\ndoubt that the online searches were conducted using standard Internet search\nengines. For the avoidance of doubt, this court notes that there\nis no suggestion that the online searches were improper. 46     Where\ninformation has been made available on the Internet, a serious question\narises as to whether the information remains “confidential” or whether\nit has entered the public domain so far as the law of confidence\nis concerned. In the context of the equitable action to protect\nconfidential information, once information is readily accessible\nto members of the public, the information will lack the necessary\nquality of confidence that is required to support the claim. Even\nwhere the publication of information is in an overseas jurisdiction,\nit does not mean that the court is prevented from finding that the\ninformation has entered into the public domain within the jurisdiction.\nSeeeg,Franchi\nv Franchi[1967] RPC 149, and generallyAttorney-General\nv Guardian Newspapers Ltd and Others[1987] 1 WLR 1248\nandAttorney-General v Observer Ltd and Others[1990]\n1 AC 109. See also the helpful commentary, Ng Siew Kuan, “The Spycatcher\nSaga: Its Implications and Effect on the Law of Confidence” (1990)\n32 Mal LR 1. In the modern information age of the Internet and the\nWorld Wide Web, news originating locally may rapidly become international\nnews in a short period of time. Where members of the public in Singapore\nare able to (lawfully) access a foreign hosted website and locate\nuploaded information, serious difficulties will arise in sustaining\nany claim to confidentiality, although this will still depend largely\non the circumstances of each case, including how readily accessible\nthe website is to the public. It does not, however, follow that\nsuch information loses any protection that it might have enjoyed\nunder the OSA. Information to be protected under the OSA does not\nhave to be confidential information as such. Indeed, leaving aside matters\nof universal general knowledge such as the sun rising in the east,\nit is clear fromBridgesthat information\nwhich has become publicly accessible may still be protected under\ns 5(1). 47     In\nthis respect, much will depend on the basis on which s 5(1) is said to\napply. Under s 5(1)(e), the OSA applies to any document or information which\na person has obtained owing to his position as someone who holds\nor has held a contract made on behalf of the Government or any specified organisation.\nThere is no requirement that the document or information has to\nbe of a confidential (let alone secret) nature. If the document\nor information can be proved to fall within s 5(1)(e), the person\nwho has possession or control commits an offence under s 5(1)(i)\nif he communicates the document or information to a person to whom\nhe is not authorised to communicate or to whom he has no duty to\ncommunicate. Assuming that s 5(1) does apply to the DA, the Defendant’s\nposition is that it cannot be compelled to grant discovery to the\nPlaintiff without the consent (ie,\nauthorisation) of the Government or the specified organisation. 48     The\nquestion to be addressed is whether s 5(1) applies to the DA. This depends\nnot so much on whether the DA is confidential, secret or publicly available\nby means of appropriate Internet searches, but whether the Defendant\nis a person who had obtained the DA owing to his position as someone\nwho held a contract made on behalf of the Government or any specified\norganisation. 49     There\nis no dispute that the DA was entered into between the Defendant\nand the STB. It is also not disputed that the Defendant obtained possession\nof its copy of the DA as a result of the contract. The key issue\nis whether the contract was made by or on behalf of the Government\nor any specified organisation. 50     The\nterm “Government” is not expressly defined in the OSA. Section 2\nof the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) simply defines it\nas meaning “the Government of Singapore”.  The Online Oxford Dictionary defines\ngovernment as “the group of people with the authority to govern\na country or state; a particular ministry in office”. On the other\nhand, the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines it as including: 5 a : the organization, machinery, or agency\nthrough which a political unit exercises authority and performs\nfunctions and which is usually classified according to the distribution\nof power within it b : the complex of political institutions,\nlaws, and customs through which the function of governing is carried\nout. 51     The\nSTB is a statutory board set up pursuant to the Singapore Tourism\nBoard Act (Cap 305B, 1997 Rev Ed) (“STB Act”). The present STB Act\ndates back to the Tourist Board Ordinance 1963 (Ordinance 35 of 1963).\nThe functions of the STB are broadly set out in s 7, of which the relevant\nportions provide that: Functions\nof Board 7.—(1) The functions of the\nBoard shall be — (a)    to\ndevelop and promote Singapore as a travel and tourist destination; (b)    to advise the Government on matters\nrelating to travel and tourism; … (d)    to\nexercise licensing and regulatory functions in respect of such tourism\nenterprises as the Board may determine. 52     The\npowers of the STB are set out in s 8, of which the relevant portions\nprovide that: Powers\nof Board 8. Subject to this Act, the\nBoard may carry on such activities as appear to the Board to be\nadvantageous, necessary or convenient for it to carry on for or\nin connection with the discharge of its functions and duties under\nthis Act and, in particular, the Board may exercise the following\npowers: (a)    to\nact as an agent for the Government or, with approval of the Minister,\nfor any person, body or organisation for the transaction of any\nbusiness connected with the tourism enterprise; … (g)    to\nacquire, take on lease, hire, hold and enjoy movable and immovable\nproperty and to convey, assign, surrender, charge, mortgage, demise,\ntransfer or otherwise dispose of, or deal with, any movable or immovable\nproperty belonging to the Board upon such terms as the Board considers\nfit; … (i)    to\nenter into any contract or agreement for carrying out the purposes\nof this Act. … 53     Tourism\nenterprise is defined in s 2 as including any other undertaking\n“including any convention, exhibition, show, fair, publicity campaign\nor theme park, intended wholly or in part for the benefit of, or\nfor the purpose of attracting, visitors to Singapore”. 54     The\nSTB is run by a Board comprising the Chairman, the Chief Executive\nand 10 other members appointed by the Minister. Other examples of\nstatutory boards in Singapore include the Civil Aviation Authority\nof Singapore, the Casino Regulatory Authority of Singapore, the Intellectual\nProperty Office of Singapore, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, the TCM Practitioners\nBoard and the URA. Former statutory boards which have since been\ncorporatised include the National University of Singapore. 55     Prior\nto its amendment in 2001, s 5(1)(e) of the OSA did not include the\nreference to “specified organisation”. Instead, the provision simply applied\nto cases where the person held a contract made on behalf of the Government.\n The problem with the pre-amendment provision was that with the\never increasing number of statutory bodies being set up in Singapore\n(covering numerous areas of activity ranging from education to transport\nand beyond), the question was bound to arise in respect of the extent\nto which the provisions of the OSA were applicable to these statutory boards,\nincluding cases where the statutory board had entered into contractual\narrangements with other persons. This appears to have been the problem\nwhich prompted the Government to table the Official Secrets (Amendment)\nBill in Parliament in 2001 so as to extend the OSA to expressly\ncover statutory boards as listed in the Schedule to the OSA.  The background\nconsiderations which led to the 2001 amendments are important, and\nthey were addressed by the then Minister of State for Home Affairs,\nAssociate Professor Ho Peng Kee, as set out inSingapore Parliamentary\nDebates, Official Report(25 July 2001) vol 73 at cols 1934–1936\n(Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Minister of State for Home Affairs): Sir, the Official Secrets Act (OSA) guards\nagainst disclosure of official documents and information as this\ncan be detrimental to national and public interest. It is with this\nobjective that I am presenting this Bill today. Sir, increasingly, many governmental functions\nhave been devolved to statutory bodies. This ensures that the public\nsector continues to remain nimble and responsive to challenges of\nthe future. This also allows statutory bodies to have greater flexibility\nto compete in the recruitment of professional talent by tapping\nexternal expertise from either local or overseas organisations.\nWith the greater flexibility, statutory bodies will better harness their\nprofessional capabilities and concentrate on developing their core competencies,\nwhilst the Ministries focus on the core functions of policy planning\nand resource allocation … Sir, this devolution of functions results\nin officers in these statutory bodies having access to official\ninformation. This is inevitable as the officers require this information\nto discharge their functions properly and effectively. The OSA currently\nonly covers Ministries. To ensure that the provisions of the OSA\ncontinue to cover these officers, it is necessary to extend the\nscope of the Act to include selective statutory bodies. Prior to\nconversion into a statutory body, such information would have been\nhandled by the officers as Ministry officials and therefore covered\nunder the OSA. Hence, what this Bill essentially does is to restore\nthe position to what it was before the formation of the statutory\nbodies. It also extends coverage to new matters that the designated\nstatutory bodies may cover. There is thus no change to the substantive\nscope of the OSA’s provisions. Currently, some of these selected statutory\nbodies are covered by the statutory bodies and Government companies’\nProtection of Secrecy Act (PSA) but the scope of PSA is narrower than\nthe OSA. This is not satisfactory in so far as official information\nvital to national security and national interest is concerned. Hence\nthese selected statutory bodies are now placed under the OSA. The Bill proposes to amend the OSA by introducing\na Schedule of Organisations comprising selected statutory bodies\nand DSO National Laboratories to be protected under the OSA. In\nthis way, the provisions relating to wrongful communication of information,\nfalsification of reports, forgery, personation and possession of\nfalse documents will apply to these organisations. The President\ncan amend this Schedule from time to time by notification in the\nGazette. Sir, MHA has consulted all the Ministries\nto identify the statutory bodies under their charge that handle\nofficial information vital to national security or national interest.\n… Sir, with these amendments, we aim to ensure\nthat official information continues to be properly protected and\nmanaged. This can only be for Singapore’s good. 56     At\nthe date of the proceedings, the Schedule sets out a list of 28 statutory\nboards. These are the Building and Construction Authority; Casino\nRegulatory Authority of Singapore; Central Provident Fund Board; Civil\nAviation Authority of Singapore; Civil Service College; Competition Commission\nof Singapore; Council for Private Education; Defence Science and\nTechnology Agency; DSO National Laboratories; Economic Development\nBoard; Energy Market Authority of Singapore; Government of Singapore\nInvestment Corporation Private Limited and its subsidiary corporations;\nHousing and Development Board; Info-communications Development Authority\nof Singapore; Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore; International\nEnterprise Singapore Board; Jurong Town Corporation; Land Transport\nAuthority of Singapore; Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore;\nMedia Development Authority of Singapore; Monetary Authority of\nSingapore; National Environment Agency; National Heritage Board;\nPublic Utilities Board; Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board;\nSingapore Land Authority; Singapore Workforce Development Agency\nand the URA. It is to be noted that there are more than 40 statutory\nboards in Singapore and the STB is not one of those named in the\nSchedule. Given the remarks made by the Minister and the extensive\nlist of statutory boards set out in the Schedule, the “omission”\nof the STB from the Schedule must have been a matter on which there\nhad been deliberation. 57     Indeed,\nit is to be noted that the STB is listed in the Schedule to the Statutory\nBodies and Government Companies (Protection of Secrecy) Act (Cap\n319, 2004 Rev Ed) (“PSA”). The PSA is an Act enacted in 1983 to protect\nthe “secrecy of information of statutory bodies and Government companies”.\nThe PSA protects any secret or confidential document or information\nobtained by virtue of a person’s position as a member, officer, employee\nor agent of any organisation specified in the Schedule. The STB, together\nwith the URA, is listed in the Schedule to the PSA (together with some\n30 other statutory boards). Thus, I am unable to accept the Defendant’s\nsubmission that even though the STB is not listed as a specified organisation\nin the Schedule to the OSA, it can nonetheless still be included simply\non the basis that it is part of the Government. Such an interpretation is\nnot consistent with the legislative history of the relevant provisions\nand would render the 2001 amendments otiose. 58     The\nDefendant’s argument on the OSA in this appeal did not, however,\nrest solely on the submission that the reference to Government included\nthe STB. In addition, another point was raised to the effect that\ns 5(1) is applicable if the contract in question (ie,\nthe DA) was made by the STBon behalfof\nthe Government. It is this argument that I now turn to.",
        "Did the STB enter the contract\non behalf of the Government?": "59     Under\nthe STB Act, s 3(2) provides that the STB is a “body corporate” possessing\nthe power to sue and be sued in its corporate name, and to perform\nall the acts which bodies corporate may by law perform. In carrying\nout and discharging its functions and duties, s 8(a) provides that the\nBoard “may”,inter alia, “act as\nagent for the Government” in relation to the “transaction of any\nbusiness connected with any tourism enterprise”. Other powers conferred\non the STB under s 8 include (under sub-paragraph (i)) the power\n“to enter into any contract or agreement for carrying out the purposes\nof [the] Act”. The Plaintiff rightly submitted that whilst the STBmayact as an agent for the Government,\nit does not necessarily follow that inall\ncases, the STB enters into commercial contracts/arrangements\nas an agent for or on behalf of the Government. Any assumption that\nthe STBalwaysacts on behalf of\nthe Government does not sit easily with s 8 and the broader rationale\nof devolving power and responsibility to the statutory boards so\nas to allow them to be nimble and responsive in the face of new\nchallenges. 60     In\nthe present case, the STB is not a party to the proceedings. The Plaintiff\nrightly draws the court’s attention to the fact that no affidavit\nhas been filed by the STB confirming their position on the DA and\nin particular, whether the DA was entered into on behalf of the\nGovernment. That said, the Defendant did, during the appeal hearing,\nproduce a letter to the court from the STB objecting to the disclosure\nof the DA. The Plaintiff was, however, not given sight of the letter\nand the position remains that there is no affidavit from the STB\nas to its position. 61     On\nthis point, counsel for the Plaintiff referred the court to the\nCourt of Appeal decision ofZainal bin Kuning\nand others v Chan Sin MianMichael\nand another[1996] 2 SLR(R) 858 (“Zainal”).\nThis was a case where the appellants had sued the respondents for\nwrongful arrest and malicious prosecution. An issue arose as to\nwhether the trial judge had properly refused to grant their application\nfor specific discovery of certain documents reflecting communications\nbetween the first respondent (a police inspector attached to the\nCriminal Investigation Department) and the Deputy Public Prosecutor.\nSection 126 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Rev Ed) provides that: No public officer shall be compelled to\ndisclose communications made to him in official confidence when\nhe considers that the public interest would suffer by the disclosure. 62     On\nthe facts, L P Thean JA, in delivering the judgment of the court, noted\n(at [33]) that affidavits had been sworn or affirmed by the officer\nin charge of the case, the Deputy Public Prosecutor and the Attorney-General to\nthe effect that the documents sought were given or received as part\nof the official duties of the officers concerned and that public\ninterest would suffer by the disclosure of these communications\nmade to them in official confidence. For this reason, Thean JA held\nthat the trial judge was fully justified in refusing to grant discovery\nof the documents. It bears noting thatZainaldid\nnot concern s 5(1) of the OSA.  Nevertheless, the Plaintiff raises\nthe point that a similar approach might be taken in relation to\ns 5(1). If a claim for “privilege” is raised on the basis that the\nSTB had entered into the DAon behalf ofthe Government, the burden falls on the\nDefendant to establish that this was in fact the position. No affidavit\nhad been filed by any representative of the STB or the Government.\nIndeed, the Plaintiff has pointed out that no affidavit was filed\nto explain why the disclosure of the contents of the DA (and the\nRequest for Proposal) would be injurious to the public interest. 63     As\nnoted above, the Plaintiff, by way of AJK-1, asserts that in any event,\nthey have been able to obtain a copy of the DA dated 11 December 2009\n(and the Supplemental Agreement). The contents of the agreements were\nalso disclosed in the 2011 Annual Report. Copies of both agreements were\nalso attached as exhibits to AJK-1. 64     I\nmake the following brief comments on these exhibits. First, the\n2011 Annual Report sets out a summary of the DA with the STB, which\nruns into some eleven (main) paragraphs and a number of subsidiary\nparagraphs as well. The opening sentence states: On August 23, 2006, our wholly owned subsidiary,\nMarina Bay Sands Pte. Ltd. (“MBS”), entered into a development agreement,\nas amended by a supplementary agreement on December 11, 2009 (the\n“Development Agreement”) with the STB to design, develop, construct\nand operate the Marina Bay Sands. 65     Further\ndown the summary, it is also stated that: Under the terms of the Development Agreement,\nMBS agreed to design, develop and construct the integrated resort\nin accordance with the plans set forth in its response to the Request\nfor Proposal, which was accepted by the STB. 66     The\n2011 Annual Report does not set out the actual DA, the Supplemental\nAgreement or the Request for Proposal. That said, it is noted that\nPart IV of the 2011 Annual Report (ie,\nExhibits and Financial Statement Schedules) refers to the DA and\nthe Supplemental Agreement to the DA in the list of exhibits. Moreover,\nthe copy of the DA (and the Supplemental Agreement) exhibited in\nAJK-1 appears to be extracted from an online website. Whether the\ncopy extracted is a true and accurate copy of the actual DA and\nthe Supplemental Agreement is not clear, given that neither the\nDefendant nor the STB has confirmed the authenticity of the documents\nin question. I, therefore, confine my further comments on the STB\nand the DA (as well as the Supplemental Agreement) to what is set\nout in the 2011 Annual Report. Bearing in mind that the 2011 Annual\nReport only provides a summary of the agreements (although it does\nappear that the actual agreements were referred to in the list of\nexhibits), there is no express indication that the STB was entering\ninto the agreements on behalf of the Government. The 2011 Annual\nReport does, however, refer to the fact that under the DA, the Defendant\nwas required to be licensed by the relevant gaming authorities before\nit could actually commence operating the casino under the casino\nconcession. The 2011 Annual Report also sets out the term (duration)\nof the casino concession provided for under the DA and goes on to\nstate that “the Singapore Government may terminate the casino concession\nprior to its expiration in order to serve the best interests of\nthe public, in which event fair compensation will be paid to MBS.” 67     It\nis the Defendant who advances the argument that the agreements between\nthe Defendant and the STB were entered into by the STB on behalf of\nthe Government and that accordingly, the Defendant is to be regarded\nas a person who has held a contract made on behalf of the Government\nso as to bring it within s 5(1)(e) of the OSA. The Defendant does\nnot appear to deny the relevance of the DA (and the Supplemental\nAgreement). Instead, the Defendant’s argument against discovery\nis predicated on the assertion that it is unable to disclose the\ndocuments as this would amount to an offence under s 5(1)(i) of\nthe OSA. In these circumstances and based on the material before\nthe court, I find that the Defendant has not established that the\nagreements were entered into by the STB on behalf of the Government. In\nsaying this, the court does take note of the Defendant’s written submissions\nthat the “Defendant has confirmed on affidavit that the Development\nAgreement was issued to the Defendant by the STB on behalf of the\nGovernment”. This may well be so. Nevertheless, the fact that the STB\ncould have entered into the contract on behalf of the Government\nis not enough to establish that this was in fact the case. In coming\nto this view, I also note that the Defendant has stated in its written\nsubmissions that the STB had confirmed that it is not agreeable\nto the disclosure of the DA and the Supplemental Agreement for the\npurposes of the present proceedings. The point remains that there\nis no affidavit from the STB in these proceedings to set out its\nposition. Neither has there been any attempt by the STB to intervene\nso as to formally record its objections. The fact that the court\nwas shown a letter indicating the STB’s objection has been referred\nto above. The letter has not been exhibited in any affidavit before\nthe court and indeed, it appears that the Plaintiff has not even\nseen the letter and was thus unable to respond. On the other hand,\nit appears that the AR was given sight of the STB letter. This led\nthe AR to state, at [6] of her decision, that “both the STB and\nthe URA declined to give consent”. In these circumstances, based\non the material placed before me in the current proceedings, this\ncourt is not satisfied that the Defendant has established that the\nDA was entered into by the STB on behalf of the Singapore Government.",
        "Evidence as to affairs of State": "68     I\nturn now to consider the next ground upon which the Defendant has\nrelied on to resist discovery of the DA, which is that the DA is\nevidence as to affairs of State. 69     Section\n125 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) states that: No one shall be permitted to produce any\nunpublished official record relating to affairs of State, or to\ngive any evidence derived therefrom, except with permission of the\nofficer at the head of the Department concerned, who shall give\nor withhold such permission as he thinks fit, subject, however,\nto the control of the Minister. 70     In\norder to succeed, it is clear that the Defendant would have to show,inter alia, that the document in question\nwas (i) unpublished, (ii) an official record, and (iii) that it\nrelated to affairs of State. Even if it is accepted that the DA\nhas not yet been published (notwithstanding the permitted referral and\nexposure of the agreement in the 2011 Annual Report), it is still necessary\nto demonstrate that the DA is an “official record” which relates\nto “affairs of State”. It is the latter term to which I now turn. 71     The\nDefendant submits that the concept embodied by the term clearly covers\nany document protected by the official secrets legislation, citing Jeffrey\nPinsler,Singapore Court Practice(LexisNexis,\n2009) at p 655, where it is stated: ... Clearly, it covers documents protected\nby ‘official secrets’ legislation (see s 5 of the Official Secrets\nAct), documents relating to public security such as national defence\n… and confidential government documents including cabinet minutes,\npolicy documents and documents the disclosure of which would be\ndetrimental to foreign relations … 72     The\nassertion that an “affair of State” covers any document that is protected\nunder s 5 of the OSA, whilst understandable, calls for closer examination.\nSection 5 of the OSA is a complex provision which is capable of\ncovering a very wide variety of material. As discussed above, care\nis needed before a conclusion can be drawn as to whether any document\nor information is protected material. In the present case, the Defendant\nargues that the DA signed by the Defendant and the STB is a document\nthat falls within s 5(1) and that the Defendant obtained the document\nas a person who holds a contract made on behalf of the Government\nor any specified organisation. That being so, the Defendant asserts\nthat its disclosure of the DA to the Plaintiff will amount to an\noffence under s 5(1)(e) and s 5(1)(i) of the OSA. It follows that\nsince this court is not satisfied that the DA was indeed signed\nby the STB on behalf of the Government, the Defendant cannot gain\nany mileage on the basis of the submission that any document falling\nwithin s 5 of the OSA must be taken to relate to an “affair of State”. 73     The\nDefendant has also relied on a number of case authorities in support\nof its argument on how “affairs of State” ought to be construed. 74     The\nfirst isChan Hiang Leng Colin and others v\nPublic Prosecutor[1994] 3 SLR(R) 209 (“Colin\nChan”). In this case, Yong Pung How CJ refused to order\nthe production of certain files and documents of various Ministries\ndue to the importance of protecting the confidentiality of state papers.\n This case concerned convictions under the Undesirable Publications\nAct (Cap 338, 1985 Rev Ed) in respect of certain publications by\nthe Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. These publications were\nthe subject of Gazette Notifications. One of the issues that arose\nin the appeal concerned the production of files and documents of\nthe relevant Ministries relating to the Gazette Notifications. It\nwas in this context that Yong CJ remarked (at [40]) that, quite\napart from s 125, he “was not convinced ... that the public interest\ndictated that such documents be produced before this court” and\nthat the “importance of preserving the confidentiality of state\npapers need not be stressed”.  The present case is clearly different\nfrom the facts inColin Chanand\nthus provides little support for the Defendant’s case. 75     The\nsecond case isRe Siah MooiGuat[1988] 2 SLR(R) 165, which was cited\nfor the proposition that in cases turning on s 125, it was for the Minister,\nand not the court, to decide whether it was in the public interest for\ncertain information to be disclosed. That case concerned an application by\na foreigner for an order ofcertiorarito\nquash the decision that revoked her re-entry permit and employment\npass. T S Sinnathuray J (at [36]) states that: ... It is laid in the second affidavit\nfor the Minister that he had considered information from a reliable\nsource on the applicant’s conduct and activities, and that he was\nof the view that the information, if disclosed, would endanger the\nconfidentiality of the source and that would not be in the public\ninterest. ... 76     It\nwas in this context that the learned judge held (at [36]) that it\nwas for the Minister, and not the court, to decide whether it was\nin the public interest that the information should be disclosed.\nAgain, the facts and circumstances ofSiah\nMooiGuatare rather\ndifferent from the case at hand. In the first place, the confidentiality\nof the information in the DA must be affected by the (consensual)\nexposure in the 2011 Annual Report. Second, it is by no means clear\nthat the DA does relate to an “affair of State”. Moreover, there\nis no affidavit by the STB or the Minister before the court on “affair\nof State” or the general public interest. 77     In\naddition to the above cases, the Defendant also referred this court to\na number of foreign authorities:B A Rao &\nOrs v Sapuran Kaur & Anor[1978] 2 MLJ 146 (“B A Rao”);Wix Corporation\nSouth East Asia SdnBhd v Minister\nfor Labour and Manpower & Ors[1980] 1 MLJ 224 (“Wix Corporation”) andThe\nLife Insurance Corporation of India v B BSingla & OrsCivil Revision No 2475\nof 2008 (“Life Insurance Corporation”).\nThe first two are decisions on s 123 of the Malaysian Evidence Act\n1950. Both were cited for the general proposition that (i) the term,\n“affair of State”, was not defined in the Evidence Act because its\nexistence would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case;\nand (ii) that it was for the court to decide whether there was a\nbasis for the claim to “affair of State”. InB\nA Rao, the Federal Court of Malaysia held that a report\nof a Committee of Inquiry into a death at a hospital was not an\naffair of State. InWix Corporation,\nthe Malaysian court found that a report by the Director General\nof Industrial Relations (relating to an employment dispute) was\nnot an affair of State. Finally,Life Insurance\nCorporationwas an Indian case from the High Court of\nPunjab and Haryana on s 123 of the Indian Evidence Act 1872, where\nit was held that an annual confidential report of an employee did\nnot attract the privilege. 78     The\nPlaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the DA and lease arrangements\nwere strictly commercial transactions and that the disclosure of\nthe same could not be said to be detrimental to national and public interests.\nThe Plaintiff points out that this assertion is consistent with\nthe Defendant’s own disclosure of the DA and/or its contents in\nits annual reports – this is so even if that disclosure was for\nthe purposes of complying with the requirements of the United States\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. Cases cited by the Plaintiff\nin support of its argument that commercial transactions or dealings\n(even those entered into by the Government) were not necessarily\nprivileged as being an “affair of State” (whose disclosure is injurious\nto the public interest) includedBurmah Oil Co\nLtd v Governor and Company of the Bank of England and Another[1980] AC\n1090,Robinson v State of South Australia (No\n2)[1931] AC 704 andWix Corporation.\nThat said, it is noted that there is no immutable rule that a document\nwhich records a commercial transaction can never be an “affair of\nState”. Further, the degree of relevancy and its importance to a\nfair disposal of the dispute between the parties is also a factor\nto be taken into account. 79     In\nthe present case, the Plaintiff submits that even though the AR\nwas showed a letter stating that the STB had objected to the disclosure,\nthe AR went on to hold (at [23]) that “there is no evidence before\nthis court that the documents or correspondences were obtained or\ngiven in official confidence, nor is there any evidence from any\ngovernment official that public interests would suffer by the disclosure\nof documents or correspondence”.  After reviewing the helpful submissions\nof both parties, I have come to the view that the Defendant has\nnot established a basis for the claim to protection on the ground\nof “affairs of State”. In any case, I would also add (in passing)\nthat not only does the DA appear to be a document which records\na commercial transaction between the STB and the Defendant, the\ngeneral relevance of the document to the substantive issues at hand\nis, at the very least, reasonably clear. In saying this, the court\nis not in any way suggesting that the contents of the DA will necessarily\nbe decisive for either the Plaintiff or the Defendant. Nevertheless,\nit does appear to be a document that will assist in the fair resolution\nof the dispute between the parties. For the sake of clarity, neither\nis this court making any holding in relation to the original request\nfor discovery of the correspondence evidencing the attempts made\nby the Defendant to secure consent from the STB. Leaving aside the\nissues relating to s 5 of the OSA and “affairs of State”, the relevance\nof these correspondences to the substantive issues in the main dispute\nappears rather doubtful at this stage. 80     I\nturn now to touch briefly on the position of the URA.  In the original request\nfor specific discovery, the Plaintiff (at para 5 of the Schedule)\nsought disclosure of the documents evidencing the URA’s request\nfor the premises to be surrendered. This category refers to correspondences,\nas well as minutes of meetings on the surrender request. The response\nof the Defendant was that save for the DA and the Request for Proposal,\nthere are no documents evidencing URA’s request for the premises\nto be surrendered.[note: 13]That being so, the principal\ndispute in relation to this part of the specific discovery request\nwas, for all practical purposes, confined to the DA signed by the\nDefendant with the STB as well as the Request for Proposal that\npre-dated the DA and which provisions were incorporated by reference\ninto the DA. The dispute here is largely the same as that discussed above\nin relation to the STB: s 5 of the OSA and s 125 of the Evidence\nAct. The main difference is that the Request for Proposal does not\nappear to have been made available online and publicly disclosed.\n That said, the Request for Proposal was itself referred to in the\n2011 Annual Report. This court notes that, whilst the URA is listed\nas a specified organisation in the OSA, there is no suggestion that\nthe DA including the Supplemental Agreement or the Request for Proposal\nwas made with the URA. Given the decision made in respect of the\nclaim by the Defendant to privilege in respect of the STB (whether\nunder the OSA or the Evidence Act), it follows that the claim also\nfails here.",
        "Conclusion": "81     The\nDefendant’s appeal against the decision of the AR in SUM 2743/2013\nis dismissed. 82     For\nthe sake of clarity and completeness, this court is reminded that on\n9 September 2013, when the case was first argued on appeal, the\nmatter was adjourned for further submissions on the OSA and the\nscope of “affairs of State”. At that hearing, the court was informed\nthat the appeal had been narrowed to Categories 1(i) and 5 of the\nSchedule. That being so, this court ordered discovery for the rest\nof the documents (in the other categories/paragraphs) in accordance\nwith the AR’s Order. The appeal, therefore, turned only on these\ntwo categories of the Schedule. 83     Costs\nare awarded to the Plaintiff and to be taxed.
