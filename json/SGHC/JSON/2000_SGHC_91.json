        "Final speeches": "11 Predictably, there was no submission from defence counsel. The\n\nprosecution’s submission was that since the evidence tendered by the prosecution\n\nremained unrebutted and that the accused did not come forward to give evidence from the\n\nwitness box or offer any explanation, the accused ought to be convicted of the charge.",
        "Recall of Dr Lui Chi Pang and conclusion": "12 At the close of the whole case, despite the accused’s decision\n\nnot to contest the charge and to remain silent, I reviewed all the evidence as was\n\nincumbent on me. During the review, it occurred to me that the scientific evidence as\n\nconcerns the analysis of drugs required further elucidation. Consequently, Dr Lui Chi Pang\n\nwas recalled to clarify certain aspects of his evidence relating to the chemical tests\n\ncarried out by him on the intact branches which were identified by him as cannabis\n\nfollowing his macroscopic and microscopic examinations of the matter submitted to him.13 It should be observed presently that Dr Lui in his earlier evidence\n\nhad stated that before a certificate could be issued confirming that the subject matter\n\nwas cannabis, it had to undergo three obligatory test phases: visual or macroscopic;\n\nmicroscopic and chemical analysis. I need not detail the processes involved at any length\n\nfor they had been adequately dealt with in a host of cases decided by our courts and in\n\nthis connection reference can be made toPublic Prosecutor v Teo Tiang Hoe(Criminal Case No 8 of 1995, unreported, at para 41; see also CCA No 25 of 1995\n\n(unreported));Public Prosecutor v Abdul Raman Bin Yusof & 2 Ors(Criminal Case No 4 of 1996, unreported, at paras 48 to 54 therein; see also[1996] 3 SLR 15(CA) at page 26 D-F and page 27 C-E); andPublic Prosecutor v Manogaran s/o R\n\nRamu(Criminal Case No 44 of 1996; see also[1997] 1 SLR 22at 38G (CA)). In\n\nregard to the chemical tests, Dr Lui mentioned that those tests were carried out to\n\ndetermine whether the vegetable matter ie the intact branches which in his view\n\nconstituted the plant cannabis, contained the requisite amount of cannabinol and\n\ntetra-hydrocannabinol above the range of 0.5%.14 Dr Lui then disclosed to the court that in relation to the\n\ncertificates issued by him namely P-44, P-45, P-46, P-47 and P-49, his chemical tests were\n\nconfined to only about 80% and the remainder was returned to the CNB. In this connection\n\nparticulars given by him were as follows:Court Exhibit NoPage reference in PI notesAmount certified (in grams)Amount actually chemically tested (in grams)P44Page 22139.90116.00P45Page 2326.8022.58P46Page 24297.60238.80P47Page 25255.90207.60P49Page 27643.90592.30Total:1,364.101,177.2815 It would appear from the details provided, that out of a total of\n\n1,364.10g of intact vegetable matter, Dr Lui subjected only 1,177.28g of the vegetable\n\nmatter to chemical tests. The remainder ie, 186.82g of the intact branches were not\n\nchemically analysed and a question then loomed as to whether the untested intact branches\n\nindeed contained the requisite amount of tetra-hydrocannabinol and cannabinol. A similar\n\nproblem arose in the case ofPublic Prosecutor v Abdul Raman(supra)\n\nwhere out of 852.35g of intact material, chemical tests were carried out only on 590.23g.\n\nAs a result, not being persuaded that the untested portion contained the requisite\n\nchemical elements, I amended the charge to one of trafficking in only 590.23g of cannabis.\n\nWhen the decision went up on appeal, the amendment made was expressly approved by the\n\nCourt of Appeal. Karthigesu JA in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal said at\n\npage 27C-E.In our judgment, therefore, what Dr Lee’s evidence amounts to is\n\n  that when he had broken down the compressed block of greenish vegetable matter which\n\n  weighed 982,38g nett, only 852.35g satisfied the macroscopic and microscopic examinations\n\n  he carried out for cannabis.The chemical tests were carried out on 590.23g of the\n\n  852.35g which showed the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol above the average\n\n  of 0.5% and were proved to be cannabis. Since this was over the 500g of cannabis which\n\n  attracts the death penalty no chemical tests were carried out on the remainder 362.12g,\n\n  which had been returned to the investigating officer. In the circumstances the learned\n\n  trial judge rightly amended the trafficking in cannabis charge from 852.3g to 590.23g.\n\n  [Emphasis added.]16 Reverting to the issue at hand, it did not escape my attention that\n\nthat Dr Lui agreed with a suggestion contained in a leading question by the learned DPP,\n\nthat even though he had not subjected all the intact branches to chemical tests, he was,\n\nnevertheless, confident that all the intact branches were in his view cannabis. In my\n\nview, the question was not so much as to whether Dr Lui was confident or certain about his\n\nconclusions. What mattered, particularly in a criminal trial such as this involving\n\ncapital punishment, was whether the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nthe whole of the 1,364.10g was cannabis. In this case, the absence of chemical tests on\n\nportions of the intact branches raised a reasonable doubt as to whether the untested\n\nportion of the vegetable matter indeed contained the requisite amount of cannabinol and\n\ntetra-hydrocannabinol.17 As was held by this court as well as the Court of Appeal inAbdul\n\nRaman, I could only conclude that the analysis carried out by the DSS had\n\nestablished conclusively that the seized substance contained at least 1,177.28g of\n\ncannabis and not 1,364.10g of cannabis as averred to in the charge.18 In the circumstances, the charge the accused faced required an\n\namendment by the deletion of the figure 1,364.10g appearing therein and inserting therefor\n\nthe figure 1,177.28g which amendment I duly made. However, inasmuch as the amended figure\n\nfell way beyond the critical boundary mark of 500g of cannabis and since the amended\n\ncharge did not in any way alter the character, nature or ingredient of the charge, I found\n\nit unnecessary at the closing stage of the proceedings to undertake any other formalities\n\nsuch as reading of the charge, recording a fresh plea and recalling of witnesses.\n\nConsequently, having amended the charge and having reviewed all the evidence in its\n\ntotality, I was satisfied that the prosecution had discharged its ultimate burden in\n\nproving the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt on the amended charge and\n\nthat he had not on balance of probabilities established his defence. In the premises the\n\naccused was found guilty of the amended charge, convicted and sentenced to the only\n\npunishment prescribed under the law.19 As regards the other charge which was stood down pending the outcome\n\nof the trial, the accused was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal pursuant to s\n\n177 of the Criminal Procedure Code.Dated this 24thday of May 2000.M P H RubinJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
