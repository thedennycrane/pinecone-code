        "The decision of the court": "8       The term “share capital”, in relation to a company, has several distinct meanings. In Charlesworth’sCompany Law, Geoffrey Morse, (Sweet & Maxwell, 17th Ed, 2005), it was observed at p 139 that: [t]he word “capital” used in connection with a company has several different meanings, thus it may mean the nominal or authorised share capital, the issued or allotted share capital, the paid-up share capital or the reserve share capital of the company. 9       The question at the outset was which type of share capital did Article 32 in MDG’s Articles of Association relate to? In my view, it was clear that at the time of MDG’s incorporation, Article 32 was understood to govern an increase in authorised share capital and not an increase in paid-up or issued share capital within the authorised capital. Apart from the authorities cited by the second defendant (see [5] above), in Charlesworth’sCompany Law([8]supra) it was observed at p 147 that: Increase in capital Every increase of the nominal or authorised capital figure in the memorandum, must be effected by the company in general meeting: s.121. If the articles authorise the increase of capital, whether an ordinary or a special resolution is required depends on the articles. Table A, reg.32 provides: “The company may be ordinary resolution – (a) increase its share capital by new shares of such amount as the resolution prescribes; …” 10     In a similar vein,Gore-Browne on Companies, vol 2 (Jordans, 45th Ed, 2003) (Update 64) noted at para 26.2 that: Increase of capital The ‘capital’ referred to here is the nominal capital authorised by the memorandum of association, and must not be confused with the issued capital or the paid-up capital. It follows that to make an issue of shares already authorised, or to make a call upon the shares already issued, would increase the issued share capital or the paid-up capital respectively, but neither proceeding would be such an increase of capital as to fall within the provisions of the Companies Act as described hereafter. By virtue of s 121 of the Companies Act 1985, a company limited by shares, or a company limited by guarantee and having a share capital, may, if authorised by its articles (see e g 1985 Table A, reg 32), increase its share capital by new shares of such amount as it thinks expedient. The increase must be effected by the company in general meeting, unless a private company takes advantage of the statutory written resolution procedure. 11     The above authorities are squarely applicable to the case at hand as the English Companies Act 1985, Table A, reg 32, wasin pari materiawith Art 40 of the pre-amended Table A and therefore with Article 32. 12     Interpreting Article 32 to apply only to authorised share capital would also be consistent with Article 4(a) of MDG’s Articles of Association, which accords the directors of MDG the power and discretion to issue authorised but unissued shares. For the above reasons, I was of the view that at the time MDG was incorporated, Article 32 applied exclusively to an increase in authorised share capital. 13     I turn now to the plaintiffs’ submissions that given that the concept of authorised share capital has since been abolished, Article 32 should then be re-interpreted to apply to all share issuances and that “[Article 32] provide that [MDG’s] shareholders must authorise any share issuance in general meeting” (see para 58 of the plaintiffs’ written submissions). I rejected the said submissions for the following reasons. 14     First, the plaintiffs’ re-interpretation of Article 32 would mean that every time the company decides to issue shares, shareholders’ approval must first be sought. This is so as Article 32 does not have a blanket annual approval provision similar to that in s 161(2) of the Companies Act. As noted at [12] above, such an interpretation would run counter to Article 4(a) whose effect is to devolve the general powers of the company to issue shares to MDG’s board. 15     Second, it would be recalled that the Articles of Association constitute a contract between the company and its members and among the membersinter se. Here, it is trite law that in the interpretation of any term of a contract, the proper approach is to examine its meaning in the light of circumstances existing at the time the contract was made, and not through the prism of subsequent events: see in general Kim Lewison,The Interpretation of Contracts(Sweet & Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2007) at pp 111 and 112 which cited,inter alia,Union Insurance Society of Canton Ltd v George Wills & Co[1916] 1 AC 281 where the Privy Council stated, at p 288, that: It is immaterial to the construction of the contract to consider subsequent events. The intention of the parties must be gathered from the language of the contract, the subject-matter, and the circumstances in existence at the time it was made. 16     In the circumstances, I was of the view that it would not be proper to take into account the fact that the concept of authorised share capital had been subsequently abolished in determining the true construction of Article 32. I accepted the defendants’ submissions that a contract should not be interpreted in the light of subsequent events as “[o]therwise one might have the result that a contract meant one thing the day it was signed, but by reason of subsequent events meant something different a month or a year later”; citingWhitworth Street Estates (Manchester) Ltd v James Miller & Partners Ltd[1970] AC 583 (“Whitworth”) at 603. 17     Although Whitworth is a case which involves the subsequent conduct of the parties while the present case involves a subsequent change of the law, I was of the view that the principle elucidated in Whitworth applies equally to the case at hand. A contract must be interpreted in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it was made. Here, the abolition of the concept of authorised share capital took place some five years after the Articles of Association of MDG had been adopted. This subsequent event should not cause a change in the interpretation of Article 32. In the premises, I agreed with the defendants’ submission that Article 32, as it stood, had been rendered otiose by the change in the law and ceased to have any practical effect. 18     While such a conclusion might, at first blush, appear to givecarte blancheto a company’s board to issue an unlimited number of shares, it is to be noted that s 161 of the Companies Act requires that, notwithstanding anything in a company’s Memorandum or Articles of Association, the prior approval of the company in general meeting is to be obtained before the directors may exercise any power of the company to issue shares. Section 161 also provides that such approval may be unconditional orsubject to conditions. Thus, notwithstanding the redundancy of Article 32, the directors’ powers to issue shares could still be circumscribed by the company’s shareholders in general meeting. 19     For the foregoing reasons, I was of the view that the Resolution did not contravene the Articles of Association of MDG. Accordingly, I dismissed the plaintiffs’ application with costs."
