        "Introduction": "1       This is an application for\n                    the determination of ancillary matters. I have to decide on\n                    the division of matrimonial assets and the issue of\n                    maintenance for the defendant and a child who has been\n                    accepted as a member of the family.",
        "Background facts": "2       The plaintiff (“the\n                    Husband”) and the defendant (“the\n                    Wife”) were married on 24 March\n                        1979.[note: 1]They have been living\n                    apart since 1996.[note: 2]They had one child, one\n                    Yong Jun, who is currently 30 years of age.[note: 3]The Husband also had\n                    two other children from another relationship,viz, one Yong Wei and one Yong\n                        Li.[note: 4]They are\n                    both currently 23 years old and are financially dependent on\n                    the Husband.[note: 5]Yong\n                    Li was accepted as a member of the family. 3       The Husband applied for and\n                    obtained an interim judgment for divorce on 2 July\n                        2008.[note: 6]The\n                    ground for divorce was that the parties had lived apart for\n                    a continuous period of at least four years immediately\n                    preceding the filing of the writ of divorce.[note: 7]The\n                    interim judgment was made final on 17 March\n                        2010.[note: 8]The Husband has\n                    since remarried. His current wife is one Fan Yu Yan\n                        (“Fan”).[note: 9]",
        "Issues": "4       I have to consider the\n                    following issues: (a)     the division of\n                        matrimonial assets; (b)     maintenance for the Wife;\n                        and (c)     maintenance for Yong\n                Li.",
        "Division of matrimonial assets": "5       The Court of Appeal held inNK v NL[2007] 3 SLR(R)\n                    743 (“NK”) that\n                    there are two broad approaches to the division of\n                    matrimonial assets,viz, the\n                    “global assessment methodology” and the\n                    “classification methodology (seeNKat [31]–[32]). I will adopt the global assessment\n                    methodology in the present case. It would be conducive to\n                    fairness and justice to adopt this approach to minimise the\n                    reshuffling of assets. 6       I will analyse the issue of\n                    the division of matrimonial assets in the following\n                    manner: (a)     determining and\n                        valuing the pool of matrimonial\n                    assets; (b)     considering the direct contributions\n                        of the parties; (c)     considering the indirect contributions\n                        of the parties; (d)     deciding on a just and equitable\n                        apportionment of the matrimonial assets and making\n                        orders to achieve this most\n                conveniently.",
        "Step 1: Determining and valuing the pool of\n                matrimonial assets": "The definition of matrimonial assets 7       Section 112(10) of the\n                    Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)\n                    (“the Charter”) provides for the following\n                    definition of matrimonial assets: (10)  In this section,\n                            “matrimonial asset”\n                            means — (a)    any asset\n                                acquired before the marriage by one party or\n                                both parties to the\n                            marriage — (i)    ordinarily used or\n                                    enjoyed by both parties or one or more of\n                                    their children while the parties are\n                                    residing together for shelter or\n                                    transportation or for household, education,\n                                    recreational, social or aesthetic purposes;\n                                    or (ii)   which has been\n                                    substantially improved during the marriage\n                                    by the other party or by both parties to the\n                                    marriage; and (b)    any other asset of any\n                                nature acquired during the marriage by one party\n                                or both parties to the marriage, but does not include any asset (not being a\n                        matrimonial home) that has been acquired by one party at\n                        any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been\n                        substantially improved during the marriage by the other\n                        party or by both parties to the marriage. The operative date for determining the\n                matrimonial assets 8       As held in a recent Court of\n                    Appeal decision (viz,Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo\n                        Nancy[2011] 2 SLR 1157\n                        (“Nancy\n                    Tay”)), there is no single operative date\n                    that would be applicable in all cases. On the facts in this\n                    case, I reached the conclusion that an appropriate cut-off\n                    date was the date of the interim judgment for divorce\n                    because the hearing for the determination of ancillary\n                    matters took place more than three years after the interim\n                    judgment for divorce was obtained. For the same reason, I am\n                    of the view that the appropriate date for the determination\n                    of the matrimonial assets in the present case is the date of\n                    the interim judgment. As I have noted above, interim\n                    judgment was obtained on 2 July 2008 (see[3]above). The hearing of the\n                    ancillary matters only took place on 14 November\n                    2011. 9       It should be noted that for\n                    assets acquired after this operative date, the funds used to\n                    acquire the assets should be restored to the common pool for\n                    the purpose of the division of matrimonial assets (seeNancy Tayat [33]). This is necessary\n                    in order to prevent spouses from dissipating the common pool\n                    after interim judgment has been granted (ibid). The operative date for valuing the matrimonial\n                assets 10     Jointly owned assets\n                    should be valued at the date of the judgment for ancillary\n                    matters. Matrimonial assets that are held in the names of\n                    each party,ie, separately\n                    owned matrimonial assets, should be valued at the date on\n                    which the matrimonial assets were determined. However, it\n                    must be noted that these dates are just starting points.\n                    They may be departed from in appropriate cases in order to\n                    reach a just and equitable division. Jointly owned assets (1)   The matrimonial home 11     The parties’\n                    matrimonial home at Block 103 Cashew Road #15-01 Cashew\n                    Heights Singapore 679674 (“the Matrimonial\n                    Home”) was purchased in 1991.[note: 10]The outstanding\n                    mortgage loan on the Matrimonial Home is S$141,501.38 as at\n                    31 December 2009 (this is the most recent figure that\n                    the parties have placed before me).[note: 11]The Husband’s counsel referred me to recent\n                    transactions in 2011 (as reflected in the Urban\n                    Redevelopment Authority’s records of caveats lodged\n                    against properties in the same condominium) which suggested\n                    a valuation of around S$1.3m to S$1.45m.[note: 12]The most recent\n                    transaction was in the amount of S$1,388,000.[note: 13]Deducting the outstanding mortgage loan from that figure, I\n                    will adopt a valuation of S$1,246,498.62. (2)   Joint account 12     The parties have a joint\n                    account with the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation\n                    (“the Joint Account”). The latest available\n                    balance in the account (as at 31 May 2010) is\n                        S$3,118.02.[note: 14] Assets held in the Husband’s own\n                name (1)   Motor vehicles 13     As of the date of the\n                    interim judgment, the Husband had three vehicles in his\n                        name:[note: 15] (a)     A\n                        “Mercedes Benz 240E” motor vehicle with\n                        the registration number SDH 6688L (“the\n                        Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle”); (b)     A\n                        “Mitsubishi Colt 1.5” motor vehicle with\n                        the registration number SDP 6886P (“the\n                        Mitsubishi Colt 1.5 Vehicle”);\n                    and (c)     An “Alfa Romeo 2.0” motor vehicle\n                        with the registration number SDP 6006P (“the\n                        Alfa Romeo 2.0 Vehicle”). 14     According to the\n                    Husband’s first affidavit of assets and means (which\n                    was filed on 8 June 2009), the values of the vehicles\n                    and the outstanding loans on the vehicles were as\n                        follows:[note: 16] VehicleValueOutstanding loanThe Mercedes Benz 240E\n                                        VehicleS$59,345S$61,469.40 (as at\n                                        3 April 2009)The Mitsubishi Colt\n                                        1.5 VehicleS$16,900S$36,880 (as at\n                                        30 June 2008)The Alfa Romeo 2.0\n                                        VehicleS$45,001S$111,030.75 (as at\n                                        2 March 2009   15     The values of the vehicles\n                    in the preceding paragraph were based on open market values\n                    as obtained from the Land Transport Authority\n                    (“LTA”). The Husband later recognised that it\n                    was incorrect to have used those figures.[note: 17]He\n                    then provided the court with values based on figures\n                    obtained from the website www.sgcarmart.com on\n                    31 January 2011. By this time, however, the Husband had\n                    sold the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle and acquired a\n                    “Mercedes Benz 250E” motor vehicle with the\n                    same registration number of SDH 6688L (“the\n                    Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle”).[note: 18]Hence, he provided a market value for the Mercedes Benz 250E\n                    Vehicle instead of the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle. This was\n                    an error because, as I explain below, the Mercedes Benz 250E\n                    Vehicle is not a matrimonial asset (see[18]below). The market values\n                    of the other two vehicles (viz, the Mitsubishi Colt 1.5 Vehicle and the\n                    Alfa Romeo 2.0 Vehicle) as at 31 January 2011, together\n                    with updated figures for the outstanding loans on those\n                    vehicles, is as follows: VehicleValue[note: 19]Outstanding loan[note: 20]The Mitsubishi Colt\n                                        1.5 VehicleS$31,000S$16,406.15 (as at\n                                        24 June 2010)The Alfa Romeo 2.0\n                                        VehicleS$64,800S$84,586.13 (as at\n                                        30 June 2008)   16     It would have been ideal\n                    if the parties had provided me with the market values and\n                    outstanding loans as at the date of the interim judgment.\n                    Unfortunately, the parties have not provided me with those\n                    figures. I must, however, do the best that I can on the\n                    evidence available. I accept the Husband’s valuation\n                    of the Mitsubishi Colt 1.5 Vehicle and the Alfa Romeo 2.0\n                    Vehicle. Taking the latest available figures (ie, the figures in the table at[15]above), I value\n                    the Mitsubishi Colt 1.5 Vehicle at S$14,593.85. I will\n                    disregard the Alfa Romeo 2.0 Vehicle because it has a\n                    negative value (seeNancy Tayat [61] where cars\n                    bought on hire-purchase were disregarded because they were\n                    of negative value). 17     As for the Mercedes Benz\n                    240E Vehicle, the Husband has only provided me with the open\n                    market value of that vehicle from the LTA (see[14]above). However, it is\n                    possible to deduce a more accurate value from other evidence\n                    on the record. As noted above, the Husband sold the Mercedes\n                    Benz 240E Vehicle and acquired the Mercedes Benz 250E\n                    Vehicle in January 2010. According to the “order\n                    specifications / booking form” for the Mercedes Benz\n                    250E Vehicle (“the Order Form”), another\n                    vehicle was traded-in for S$84,000 in the same\n                        transaction.[note: 21]Although\n                    the Order Form does not provide the particulars of the\n                    vehicle that was traded-in, I gather from the text of the\n                    Husband’s third affidavit of assets and means that the\n                    vehicle traded-in was the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle. In\n                    this affidavit, the Husband explained that one of his\n                    reasons for selling the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle was that\n                    he was advised that it was better to sell it because\n                    “it could still fetch a better price of [S]$84,000(in January 2010) before it\n                    approached the 6thyear by April\n                    2010” [emphasis added].[note: 22]I therefore\n                    find that the market price of the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle\n                    was approximately S$84,000. I should reiterate that this is\n                    not the ideal way of valuing the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle\n                    because what I should determine is the market price of the\n                    Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle as at the date of the interim\n                    judgment. On this approach, the value of the Mercedes Benz\n                    240E Vehicle is S$22,530.60 (this figure is derived by\n                    deducting the only available figure for the outstanding loan\n                    for the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle (viz, S$61,469.40 (as at 3 April 2009)\n                    – see the table at[14]above) from my estimation of the market\n                    price of the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle (viz, $84,000)). 18     As noted above, the\n                    Husband purchased the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle in January\n                    2010. He claimed that he held the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle\n                    on trust for Chong Park Medical Hall (S) Pte Ltd\n                    (“Chong Park Singapore”).[note: 23]I\n                    do not accept his bare assertion that the Mercedes Benz 250E\n                    Vehicle, which was registered in his name, was held on\n                    trust. The Husband produced no documentary evidence to\n                    support the existence of the trust. I find, however, that\n                    the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle is not a matrimonial asset\n                    simply because it was acquired after the date of the interim\n                    judgment.

I have no alternative but to\n                    adopt the surrender values of the three Great Eastern Life\n                    policies in the Husband’s second affidavit of assets\n                    and means because the Husband’s first affidavit of\n                    assets and means does not provide the relevant\n                    figures. 20     I find that the\n                    Husband’s insurance policies have the surrender values\n                    as stated in the table at[19]above. The Husband provided\n                    documentation from the respective insurers to support his\n                    figures. As the Wife did not propose an exchange rate, I\n                    will use the Husband’s proposed exchange rate of\n                    RM2.47 per unit of SGD.[note: 34]At this\n                    exchange rate, the two Great Eastern Life policies in the\n                    table at[19]above are\n                    valued at S$26,632.62 and S$25,261.34,\n                respectively. 21     Before me, the\n                    Wife’s counsel submitted that the Husband had taken\n                    out a loan of S$36,000 against the Great Eastern Life Policy\n                    in 2005.[note: 35]As the\n                    Husband’s counsel submitted, no allegation had been\n                    made before of a loan being taken up against the\n                        policy.[note: 36]I\n                    will disregard the Wife’s allegation of a loan in the\n                    absence of any documentary evidence to support the existence\n                    of the loan. (3)   Shares in listed companies 22     The Husband had shares in\n                    listed companies with a market value of S$14,911.14 as at\n                    31 August 2008.[note: 37]I will\n                    adopt this valuation in preference to an updated figure that\n                    the Husband provided in his second affidavit of assets and\n                    means. (4)   Shares in private companies 23     In his first affidavit of\n                    assets and means, the Husband listed the following companies\n                    under the section entitled “Any Other\n                        Issues/Information”:[note: 38] (a)     Chong Park\n                        Singapore; (b)     Chong Park Medical Hall Sdn Bhd\n                        (“Chong Park\n                    Malaysia”); (c)     Jun Marketing Snd Bhd (“Jun\n                        Marketing”); and (d)     Rhino Distributors Sdn Bhd\n                        (“Rhino Distributors”).

However, the letter from Mr Goh which was\n                    exhibited in the affidavit stated that Mr Goh was referred\n                    the reports on Jun Marketing and IDR Superior (see p 79\n                    of the same affidavit). Be that as it may, Mr Goh\n                    criticised the reports in the following terms:[note: 56] … (a)We noted that both\n                            reports are not signed and dated to prove their\n                            origins. (b)We\n                            noted that the reports include no name(s) and\n                            qualification(s) of the preparer(s) to prove that\n                            they are prepared by professionals with relevant\n                            professional competencies. We also noted that the\n                            reports include no relevant source materials on\n                            which the valuations are based upon, i.e. relevant\n                            financial statements and market research materials\n                            leading to the provision of equity premiums and risk\n                            premiums. (c)We\n                            noted that the reports are addressed to just [the\n                            Husband] and not to a general\n                        audience. (d)We\n                            noted that the figures used in the report, Valuation\n                            of the Equity of [the Husband] in [Jun Marketing]\n                            differ from the figures reported in the balance\n                            sheet as at 30 September 2008 of the said\n                            company. (e)We\n                            noted the reference number (AF 0155) stated on the\n                            cover pages of both reports and did a World Wide Web\n                            search. Our search results show that the search on\n                            the list of CPA in Malaysia has audit firm number\n                            AF0155. We also noted that the reports are not printed\n                            with their official letterhead, company registration\n                            number and any other professional accreditation\n                            reference numbers. (f)With respect to [Jun\n                            Marketing], we noted that source materials, such as\n                            financial statements including statements of\n                            comprehensive incomes, financial position and\n                            changes in equity, are not included in the report to\n                            substantiate the facts mentioned\n                        therein. With respect to [IDR Superior], we noted the premium\n                        of 18% arise [sic] from\n                        the fact that the company is an owner-operated business.\n                        Little literature has been written on such\n                        company-specific risk premium in particular. We noted\n                        that there are no document and information to\n                        substantiate the premium rates used in the report. This\n                        information may include the following: 1)A market research report on the\n                            risk premiums of Malaysian companies of similar\n                            attributes including company size and business\n                            types 2)Documents to provide basis for\n                            the premium allocated for an owner-operated\n                            business, with supporting information from average\n                            market rates of such premium 3)Financial statements including\n                            income statement, balance sheet and statement of\n                            changes in equity. … 27     The formal objections to\n                    the valuation reports, such as the absence of a date or the\n                    names and qualifications of the authors, were addressed in\n                    the Husband’s third affidavit of assets and means. In\n                    this affidavit, he exhibited the cover pages of the reports\n                    which state the dates, names and qualifications of the\n                    author of the reports.[note: 57]As for the\n                    other criticisms, the Wife did not provide her own\n                    valuations of the companies in a manner that addressed the\n                    criticisms. The approach that she took was to simply\n                    criticise aspects of the valuations by the Husband. This\n                    leaves me with some difficulty as to how I should value the\n                    Husband’s shares in the companies. 28     I note that the Court of\n                    Appeal inNKordered the\n                    parties to agree to appoint a valuer to value a company\n                    within a time period, failing which the court would appoint\n                    a valuer (seeNKat [54]). The court further\n                    ordered that the valuation would be final (seeNKat [54]). The dispute did not, however, end\n                    there. The husband inNKinvoked the “liberty to apply” clause in the\n                    court’s order to dispute the valuation of the\n                    court-appointed valuer and to seek a revaluation (seeNK v NL[2010]\n                    4 SLR 792at [5]). 29     One option is to follow\n                    the approach of the Court of Appeal inNKby ordering the parties to agree to\n                    appoint another valuer within a time period, failing which I\n                    could appoint a valuer. However, the situation in the\n                    present case is different from that inNK. The Court of Appeal inNKdid not have a valuation report\n                    before it. In contrast, I already have valuation\n                    reports. 30     In my view, it is not in\n                    the interests of fairness and justice to order a further\n                    valuation. Such a course would prolong the resolution of the\n                    ancillary matters further and would entail further costs for\n                    both parties. Notwithstanding Mr Goh’s criticisms, I\n                    accept the Husband’s figures as they are the only\n                    available evidence before the court of the value of his\n                    shares in the companies. Applying the exchange rate that I\n                    adoptedvis-à-visthe\n                    insurance policies (see[20]above), the Husband’s shares have\n                    the following values in SGD: CompanyValuationChong Park\n                                        SingaporeS$147,273Jun\n                                        MarketingS$0.40Rhino\n                                        DistributorsNilIDR\n                                        SuperiorS$119,270.04Chong Park\n                                        PharmaceuticalsS$39,549.39   (5)   Money in bank accounts 31     In his first affidavit of\n                    assets and means, the Husband stated that he had the\n                    following amounts in his bank accounts:[note: 58] Bank accountBalanceDevelopment Bank of\n                                        Singapore (“DBS”) account\n                                        (“the DBS\n                                        Account”)S$5,468.82 (as at\n                                        31 October\n                                    2008)Post Office Savings\n                                        Bank (“POSB”) account\n                                        (joint savings account with Yong Li)\n                                        (“the POSB\n                                        Account”)S$2,100.20 (as at\n                                        14 October\n                                    2008)The Hongkong and\n                                        Shanghai Banking Corporation (Malaysia)\n                                        account (joint account with Yong Jun)\n                                        (“the HSBC\n                                        Account”)RM34,109.27 (as at\n                                        3 September\n                                    2008)   The Husband also included the balances in the\n                    corporate accounts for his companies. The Husband does not\n                    explain the reason for including these corporate accounts in\n                    his first affidavit of assets and means (viz, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation\n                        ­– S$34,443.06, United Overseas\n                    Bank (Malaysia) – RM18,305.38 and United Overseas Bank\n                    – RM20,000). These accounts are not mentioned in his\n                    second affidavit of assets and means. This appears to be an\n                    error. 32     In his second affidavit of\n                    assets and means, the Husband provided an update of the\n                    balances in his accounts:[note: 59] (a)     The DBS Account\n                        had gone into overdraft in the amount of S$3,449.25 (as\n                        at 31 March 2010). (b)     The balance in the HSBC\n                        Account had reduced substantially to RM3,498.91 (as at\n                        28 February 2010). (c)     The POSB Account had been\n                        closed on 19 February 2009 and the outstanding\n                        balance of S$2,269.07 was deposited into the DBS\n                            Account.[note: 60] I will\n                    adopt the balances in the Husband’s first affidavit of\n                    assets and means because those balances are closer in time\n                    to the interim judgment. 33     In addition, the Husband\n                    disclosed that he had two further accounts:[note: 61] Bank accountBalancePublic Growth\n                                        FundRM42,440.36 (as at\n                                        31 January\n                                    2010)Standard Chartered\n                                        AccountRM2,796.69 (as at\n                                        20 June 2010)   The Husband has not provided me with the balances\n                    in the above accounts as at the date of the interim\n                    judgment. In the absence of any better evidence, I will\n                    include the amounts stated in the table above in the common\n                    pool. 34     The Husband also disclosed\n                    that he used to have four Standard Chartered Bank accounts\n                    which were closed.[note: 62]He claimed\n                    that the balances in the accounts were withdrawn and used\n                    for financing the operations of one of his companies, Rhino\n                        Distributors.[note: 63]In my\n                    view, the reason why the accounts were closed is immaterial.\n                    The money in those accounts were matrimonial assets. From an\n                    examination of the relevant bank statements, the accounts\n                    had the following amounts before they were\n                        closed:[note: 64] (a)     RM20,008.15; (b)     RM10,024.41; (c)     RM5,012.20;\n                        and (d)     RM1,112.99. In the\n                    absence of any evidence as to the amounts in these closed\n                    accounts as at the date of the interim judgment, I will\n                    include the above amounts in the common pool. 35     It should be noted that\n                    the Wife claimed that a RM250,000 structured investment that\n                    the Husband had with HSBC (“the HSBC Structured\n                    Investment”) should be included as part of the\n                    matrimonial assets.[note: 65]The HSBC\n                    Structured Investment was later redeemed prematurely by six\n                    months. The redemption amount was paid into the\n                    Husband’s bank account.[note: 66]The\n                    Husband explained that the HSBC Structured Investment was\n                    used for Yong Jun’s overseas education (Yong Jun\n                    confirmed this in an affidavit).[note: 67]The\n                    Husband said that after Yong Jun’s education was\n                    completed, the Husband withdrew the balance and used it to\n                    pay for legal fees for proceedings against Chong Park\n                    Malaysia and Rhino Distributors, as well as for payment to\n                        suppliers.[note: 68]In any event, the HSBC Structured Investment was taken up on\n                    13 August 2008, after the interim judgment was\n                    finalised. Hence, it is not a matrimonial\n                asset. 36     In summary, the following\n                    amounts of cash in the Husband’s bank accounts should\n                    be included in the common pool: Bank accountBalanceThe DBS\n                                        AccountS$5,468.82The POSB\n                                        AccountS$2,100.20The HSBC\n                                        AccountRM34,109.27Public Growth\n                                        FundRM42,440.36Standard Chartered\n                                        Bank AccountRM2,796.69Closed Standard\n                                        Chartered Bank\n                                    accountRM20,008.15Closed Standard\n                                        Chartered Bank\n                                    accountRM10,024.41Closed Standard\n                                        Chartered Bank\n                                    accountRM5,012.20Closed Standard\n                                        Chartered Bank\n                                    accountRM1,112.99Total\n                                        (S$)S$7,569.02Total\n                                        (RM)RM115,504.07   37     Using the same exchange\n                    rate of RM2.47 per unit of SGD, the value of the\n                    Husband’s RM deposits is equivalent to\n                    S$46,762.78. (6)   Money in Central Provident Fund\n                (“CPF”) accounts 38     In his first affidavit of\n                    assets and means, the Husband reproduced a statement of the\n                    balances in his CPF accounts.[note: 69]He had\n                    S$32,475.71 in his Medisave Account and S$59,507.32 in his\n                    Retirement Account. His Ordinary Account and Special Account\n                    had zero balances.[note: 70]Those\n                    amounts are part of the common pool. I will not take into\n                    account the updated figures provided in the Husband’s\n                    second affidavit of assets and means. 39     It should be noted that\n                    the Husband admits that he withdrew the amount of\n                    S$62,557.77 from one of his CPF accounts on 23 November\n                        2007.[note: 71]This\n                    money was deposited into the DBS Account on 26 November\n                        2007.[note: 72]The\n                    Wife’s counsel submitted that this money should be\n                    reflected as part of the matrimonial assets.[note: 73]I agree with the\n                    Husband’s counsel that this amount should not be\n                    included in the common pool. The money was withdrawn and\n                    deposited into the DBS Account well before the divorce\n                    proceedings had even commenced. (7)   Club memberships 40     In his first affidavit of\n                    assets and means, the Husband only disclosed that he was a\n                    member of Raffles Town Club\n                        (“RTC”).[note: 74]He\n                    deposed that his RTC membership had “hardly any\n                        value”.[note: 75] 41     In his second affidavit of\n                    assets and means, the Husband disclosed that he was also a\n                    member of the Starhill Golf Club in Malaysia\n                    (“Starhill”) and the Singapore Recreation Club\n                        (“SRC”).[note: 76]He\n                    estimated the market price of his Starhill membership at\n                    S$2,000 and his SRC membership at S$11,500 by referring to\n                    advertisements in the “Classified” section of\n                    The Straits Times.[note: 77]After\n                    taking into account transfer fees, his Starhill membership\n                    had a negative value and his SRC membership had a value of\n                        S$8,290.[note: 78] 42     I accept the\n                    Husband’s valuation of his SRC membership at\n                    S$8,290. (8)   Property purchased with new\n                wife 43     On 14 August 2005,\n                    the Husband purchased a property at Block 810 Bedok\n                    Reservoir Road #09-10 Baywater Condo, Singapore 479241\n                    (“the Baywater Property”) together with his\n                    current wife, Fan.[note: 79] 44     I first have to determine\n                    the value of the Baywater Property at the time of the\n                    interim judgment. In his first affidavit of assets and\n                    means, the Husband estimated that the Baywater Property had\n                    a value of S$600,000.[note: 80]However, the\n                    Husband did not provide any basis or documentary evidence\n                    for his estimation. It was only in his second affidavit of\n                    assets and means that he provided an estimation of S$862,330\n                    based on transacted prices as at April 2010.[note: 81]In the absence of better evidence of the value of the\n                    Baywater Property, I accept the Husband’s estimation\n                    of S$862,330. The outstanding mortgage loan as at\n                    5 February 2010 is S$385,421.63.[note: 82]Hence, I estimate the net value of the Baywater Property to\n                    be S$476,908.37. 45     I next have to determine\n                    the value of theHusband’s\n                        shareof the Baywater Property at the time of\n                    the interim judgment. The Husband and Fan are joint tenants\n                    of the Baywater Property.[note: 83]At the time\n                    of the interim judgment, the Husband was not married to Fan\n                    (according to the Husband’s counsel, the Husband and\n                    Fan married in 2010[note: 84]).\n                    Their contributions to the purchase price of the Baywater\n                    Property were unequal, with Fan contributing\n                        more.[note: 85]In view of\n                    their unequal contributions, at the time of the interim\n                    judgment, there would have been a presumption of resulting\n                    trust,ie, the Husband and Fan\n                    would be presumed to hold the Baywater Property as tenants\n                    in common at equity in the proportions of their contribution\n                    to the purchase price (seeLau Siew Kim v\n                        Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another[2008] 2\n                    SLR(R) 108 (“Lau Siew\n                        Kim”) at [107]). There would not have\n                    been a counter-presumption of advancement because, at the\n                    time of the interim judgment, the Husband and Fan were not\n                    in a spousal relationship and the conventional position is\n                    that the presumption of advancement does not apply in ade factospousal\n                    relationship (seeLau Siew Kimat [73]). Although\n                    the Court of Appeal inLau Siew\n                        Kimdid not exclude the possibility of a\n                    future argument for the expansion of the presumption to such\n                    relationships (seeLau Siew\n                        Kimat [74]), no argument was made by either party\n                    that the presumption of advancement was applicable as\n                    between the Husband and Fan at the time of the interim\n                    judgment. I see no reason why the presumption of resulting\n                    trust would be rebutted in the present case. Hence, I find\n                    that at the time of the interim judgment, the Husband and\n                    Fan held the Baywater Property as tenants in common at\n                    equity in the proportions of their contributions to the\n                    purchase price. As for the proportions held by the Husband\n                    and Fan, mortgage repayments and other financial\n                    contributions after the acquisition of the Baywater Property\n                    will not be considered unless there was an agreement between\n                    them on the repayment of the mortgage (seeLau Siew Kimat [115]–[116]).\n                    There is no evidence of an agreement between the Husband and\n                    Fan on the amounts that they would each contribute towards\n                    the mortgage on the Baywater Property. Hence, I can only\n                    take into account their contributions to the downpayment. In\n                    this regard, I accept that the Husband contributed S$45,590\n                    and Fan contributed S$75,810 to the S$121,400\n                        downpayment.[note: 86]On this\n                    view, the Husband’s share of the Baywater Property was\n                    37.5% at the time of the interim judgment. On my valuation\n                    of the Baywater Property, the Husband share is accordingly\n                    worth S$179,317.55. Assets held in the Wife’s own\n                name (1)   Insurance policies 46     The Wife disclosed in her\n                    third affidavit of assets and means that she purchased an\n                    insurance policy in 1978 before her marriage. This policy\n                    matured on 28 May 2000, well before the interim\n                        judgment.[note: 87]This\n                    is not a matrimonial asset. (2)   Shares in listed companies 47     The Wife has shares in\n                    listed companies. Those shares were worth a total of\n                    S$173,446.19, US$3,320 and HK$6,600 as at 31 July\n                        2008.[note: 88]She separately holds shares in listed companies through her\n                    CPF Investment Account. Those shares were valued at\n                    S$150,644.37 as at 31 July 2008.[note: 89]I will\n                    adopt these valuations of her shares in preference to an\n                    updated figure that she provided in a later affidavit of\n                    assets and means.[note: 90]I will use the Husband’s proposed exchange rates of\n                    US$0.83 per unit of SGD and HK$6.48 per unit of SGD to\n                    determine the SGD equivalents of the shares held in USD and\n                    HKD respectively.[note: 91]Applying\n                    these exchange rates, the USD denominated shares are worth\n                    S$4,000 and HKD denominated shares are worth\n                    S$1,018.52. 48     In her third affidavit of\n                    assets and means, the Wife deposed that she had\n                    inadvertently omitted to disclose that she has shares in\n                    various Malaysian listed companies. Those shares were\n                    acquired more than 10 years ago.[note: 92]She estimated that\n                    those shares were worth approximately S$10,000.[note: 93]I\n                    note that the Wife used the currency symbol (ie, “$”) for her\n                    Malaysian shares in both her affidavit (at [63]) and her written\n                    submissions (at p 8). In her affidavit, she used the\n                    currency symbol for all assets denominated in SGD. Hence, I\n                    deduced that her Malaysian shares were valued atS$10,000. The Husband, however, has\n                    stated the value of the Malaysian shares atRM10,000 (see Annex B to the\n                    Husband’s Skeletal Arguments). It is not possible to\n                    determine the true value from the Bursa Malaysia statements\n                    that the Wife exhibited in her affidavit because those\n                    statements do not state the market values of the shares. I\n                    therefore assume the figure to be in SGD. These shares are\n                    matrimonial assets. (3)   Unit trusts 49     The Wife also has\n                    investments in unit trusts. Although she disclosed that she\n                    had such investments in her first affidavit of assets and\n                    means, the values of her investments and the full list of\n                    her investments were not clearly stated. I will adopt the\n                    following valuation of her investments as stated in her\n                    third affidavit of assets and means:[note: 94] Unit trustValue“First State\n                                        Global Balanced Fund” (held with\n                                        First State\n                                    Investments)S$2,980.01“Templeton\n                                        Global Balanced Fund Class A (ACC)\n                                        SGD” (held with Franklin\n                                        Templeton\n                                    Investments)US$2,472.53“Eight\n                                        Portfolio C” (held with DBS Asset\n                                        Management)S$5,228.72“Schroder Asian\n                                        Growth Fund (S$ Class)” (held\n                                        with Schroders)S$3,949.89“Lionglobal\n                                        Singapore/Malaysia Fund SGD\n                                        Class” (held with Lion Global\n                                        Investors Ltd)S$6,653.92Total\n                                        SGDS$18,812.54Total\n                                        USDUS$2,472.53   Using the exchange rate adopted above in relation\n                    to the Wife’s shares (see[47]above), the Wife’s investment in\n                    USD unit trusts is worth S$2,978.95. (4)   Shares in private companies 50     The Wife did not disclose\n                    in her affidavits of assets and means that she was a\n                    shareholder of Chong Park Singapore. However, in his second\n                    affidavit of assets and means, the Husband deposed that the\n                    Wife owned 49% of the shares in Chong Park\n                        Singapore.[note: 95]In his written\n                    submissions, the Wife’s counsel stated that the Wife\n                    owned 49% of the shares in Chong Park Singapore.[note: 96] 51     I have already accepted\n                    the Husband’s valuation of his shares in Chong Park\n                    Singapore (see[30]above). Adjusting his valuation, I value the Wife’s\n                    shares in Chong Park Singapore at\n                S$141,497.79. (5)   Money in bank accounts 52     As disclosed in her first\n                    affidavit of assets and means, the Wife had the sum of\n                    S$21,807.16 in a joint account with Yong Jun as at\n                    11 August 2008.[note: 97]I will adopt this\n                    figure in preference to the updated figure in a subsequent\n                    affidavit. (6)   Money in CPF accounts 53     In her first affidavit of\n                    assets and means, the Wife reproduced her CPF Statement of\n                    Account for January to December 2007. This statement\n                    disclosed that she had the following amounts in her\n                    respective accounts: (a)     Ordinary\n                        Account: S$21,392.19; (b)     Special Account: S$3,901.80;\n                        and (c)     Medisave Account:\n                    S$26539.11. I will use these figures in\n                    preference to updated figures provided in later\n                    affidavits.

        "Step 2: Considering the direct financial\n                contributions of the parties": "55     There was initially a\n                    dispute on the extent of the Wife’s direct cash\n                    contributions to the Matrimonial Home. The Wife asserted\n                    that she paid an amount of S$14,688 as part of the\n                    downpayment and that she contributed S$10,000 for\n                        renovations.[note: 98]The\n                    Husband disputed this.[note: 99]However, at the hearing before me, both counsel agreed that\n                    it was “not really disputed” that the\n                    proportions of the direct contributions were 75:25 in favour\n                    of the Husband. In the light of this concession, I find that\n                    the direct contributions to the Matrimonial Home were in the\n                    ratio of 75:25 in the Husband’s favour. 56     Apart from the\n                    contributions to the Matrimonial Home, the Husband deposed\n                    in his third affidavit of assets and means to paying for\n                    utility bills, telephone bills, television and cable\n                    television charges, management corporation charges,\n                    household maintenance and repairs.[note: 100]",
        "Step 3: Considering the indirect contributions of\n                the parties": "57     The Wife resigned from her\n                    employment as a personal assistant in 1993 to take care of\n                    Yong Jun and Yong Li.[note: 101]There\n                    was initially some dispute as to whether the Wife cared for\n                    the children. In his second affidavit of assets and means,\n                    the Husband deposed that his mother took care of the\n                    children, that he enlisted a maid to assist in caring for\n                    the children and that the Wife “hardly looked after\n                    the children”.[note: 102]The\n                    Wife contested this.[note: 103]She also\n                    referred to an affidavit filed by her former maid in which\n                    it was deposed that the Husband’s mother did not play\n                    a role in Yong Li’s care. The former maid also said\n                    that the Wife showed Yong Li “unconditional\n                    care” and that the Wife was a “full-time\n                    mother” after she gave up her employment.[note: 104]Yong Jun\n                    and Yong Li also filed affidavits. Yong Jun deposed that the\n                    Wife was an “exemplary mother” and that she\n                    committed to being a full-time mother after she resigned\n                    from her employment in 1993.[note: 105]Yong Li\n                    expressed her gratitude at the Wife’s acceptance of\n                    her notwithstanding that she was not her biological\n                        daughter.[note: 106]She also\n                    explained that she was cared for by her mother with the\n                    assistance of their former maid.[note: 107]I accept\n                    that the Wife made extensive indirect contributions in\n                    caring for the children. Indeed, in his written submissions,\n                    the Husband’s counsel submitted that the Husband\n                    acknowledged and was grateful for the role that the Wife\n                    played in the care of Yong Jun and Yong Li.[note: 108] 58     However, the Husband\n                    asserted that he also helped to care for the\n                        children.[note: 109]He\n                    referred in this regard to affidavits deposed to by Yong Jun\n                    and Yong Li: (a)     Yong Jun deposed\n                        that his father contributed financially to the\n                            family.[note: 110]He\n                        also paid for his overseas education.[note: 111]Yong Jun said that he would not have graduated without\n                        the Husband’s “moral and financial\n                            support”.[note: 112]Yong\n                        Jun also recounted that his father bought him the Alfa\n                        Romeo 2.0 Vehicle as a reward for his good results at a\n                            polytechnic.[note: 113]Yong\n                        Jun further deposed that the Husband assisted him with\n                        starting a business by the name of “Alldo\n                        Resources Sdn Bhd” (“Alldo\n                            Resources”).[note: 114]He claimed that the Husband assisted him with running\n                        the business when Yong Jun decided to further his\n                        education overseas.[note: 115] (b)     Yong Li deposed\n                        that the Husband has been supporting the family\n                            financially.[note: 116]The\n                        Husband also covered her expenses and gave her the money\n                        that she needed, both for education expenses as well as\n                        other expenses such as holiday trips.[note: 117] 59     On the basis of the\n                    evidence of Yong Jun and Yong Li, which I accept, I find\n                    that the Husband also contributed both financially and\n                    non-financially to the care for the children. However, it is\n                    fair to say that the Wife’s contributions were more\n                    substantial. The Husband’s non-financial contributions\n                    were supportive in nature. 60     The Wife also claimed to\n                    have contributed to Chong Park Singapore after her\n                    resignation from her previous employment in 1993. She\n                    explained that she oversaw the company’s operations\n                    together with the Husband and joined him on overseas trips.\n                    She claimed that she provided the “essential\n                    backup” in Singapore that the Husband could rely\n                    upon, such that he was able to travel overseas for long\n                        periods.[note: 118]The\n                    Husband disputed this. He claimed that the Wife’s role\n                    was “nominal”. He said that she merely signed\n                    documents for the company as a director. He claimed that she\n                    hardly went to the company’s office and did not go for\n                    sales trips. She did not also travel for\n                        business.[note: 119] 61     I find the Wife’s\n                    claims of having contributed extensively to Chong Park\n                    Singapore to be inconsistent with her claim that she was a\n                    full time caregiver to her children upon her resignation\n                    from her previous employment in 1993. I find that it is more\n                    likely that she was a full time mother from 1993 and that\n                    she played, at most, a minor role in Chong Park\n                    Singapore.",
        "Step 4: Deciding on a just and equitable\n                apportionment of the matrimonial assets and making orders to\n                achieve this most conveniently": "Preliminary issue: Should an adverse inference be\n                drawn against either party? (1)   The law on drawing adverse\n                inferences 62     The parties have a duty of\n                    full and frank disclosure (seeNKat [57]). If a party fails to comply with this\n                    duty, an adverse inference may be drawn. There are at least\n                    two possible consequences to the drawing of an adverse\n                    inference. First, the court may divide the matrimonial\n                    assets on the basis of the assets that were disclosed (seeNKat [58]). This approach\n                    entails ordering a higher proportion of the disclosed assets\n                    to the other party (seeNKat\n                        [62]).\n                    Alternatively, the court may determine the value of the\n                    undeclared assets (seeNKat\n                        [59]). In\n                    pursuing this second approach, the court must be careful not\n                    to be unnecessarily speculative in determining the values of\n                    the undeclared assets (seeNKat [61]). As will be\n                    seen, I have adopted the first approach because there is no\n                    basis for me to determine the true amount of the undeclared\n                    assets with any accuracy. (2)   Analysis 63     Both the Wife and the\n                    Husband have alleged that the other has failed in his or her\n                    obligation to give full and frank disclosure. (A)   Alleged non-disclosures by the\n                Husband (I)   Failure to disclose the existence of\n                interests in two companies until second affidavit of assets and\n                means 64     The Wife first referred to\n                    the fact that the Husband did not disclose the existence of\n                    his interests in Chong Park Pharmaceutical and IDR Superior\n                    until his second affidavit of assets and means, which was\n                    filed on 21 September 2010 (see[23]–[24]above), even though he\n                    had earlier disclosed in an answer to interrogatories filed\n                    on 19 November 2009 that “he had no other\n                    business entities in Singapore or\n                        elsewhere”.[note: 120]It should be\n                    noted that the existence of his interests in the two\n                    companies was first raised by the Wife in her second\n                    affidavit of assets and means dated 22 February\n                        2010.[note: 121] 65     The Husband’s\n                    explanation for this was that his first affidavit of assets\n                    and means and his answers to interrogatories were filed by\n                    his previous solicitors and were incomplete.[note: 122]He\n                    corrected this omission by making full disclosure in his\n                    subsequent affidavit. 66     I do not accept the\n                    Husband’s explanation. The very first page of his\n                    first affidavit of assets and means stated that he\n                    “made full and frank disclosure of [his] assets and\n                    means” and that he has “no other assets and\n                    means aside from what has been disclosed in [the]\n                        [a]ffidavit”.[note: 123]It should\n                    have been clear to the Husband that he had a duty to\n                    disclose all his assets. He cannot hide behind the\n                    convenient fact that he had a change of\n                solicitors. (II)   Income from companies in Singapore and\n                MAlaysia 67     The Wife referred to Chong\n                    Park Singapore’s balance sheet for the financial year\n                    which ended on 31 July 2009.[note: 124]This balance sheet\n                    indicated that an amount of S$727,944 was due to Chong Park\n                    Singapore’s directors in 2008. For the year 2009, this\n                    amount was reduced by S$111,043 to S$616,901. The cash flow\n                    statement in the balance sheet indicated that this amount\n                    was paid to directors.[note: 125]The\n                    Wife pointed out that Chong Park Singapore has only two\n                    directors,viz, the Husband\n                    and herself. As she did not receive any payment, she\n                    submitted that the payment must have been made to the\n                        Husband.[note: 126]The\n                    Husband has not disclosed that he received such a\n                        payment.[note: 127] 68     The Husband’s\n                    explanation for the amount reflected in the balance sheet as\n                    being due to the directors is that those monies were loans\n                    given by his mother, aunt and uncle to Chong Park Singapore.\n                    He claims that the benefit of those loans was transferred to\n                    him when they transferred their shares to him in\n                        1989.[note: 128] 69     The Husband’s\n                    explanation does not satisfactorily explain the reason for\n                    the reduction in the amount due to the directors. Even if\n                    the amount reflected as being due to the directors was a\n                    loan from the Husband’s relatives, he has not\n                    explained the reason for thereductionin that amount in 2009 with an\n                    accompanying outward cash flow. He has not also contradicted\n                    the Wife’s assertion that she did not receive the\n                    amount of S$111,043. The only remaining possibility is that\n                    the Husband received that amount. His failure to disclose\n                    this fact was a breach of his duty of full and frank\n                    disclosure. 70     The Wife next referred to\n                    inconsistencies in the Husband’s affidavits on the\n                    source of his declared income from Malaysia.[note: 129]For\n                    example, the Husband’s first affidavit of assets and\n                    means stated that he drew a RM96,000 annual income from Jun\n                        Marketing.[note: 130]However, he later claimed that this income was from Chong\n                    Park Pharmaceuticals in 2007 and from IDR Superior in\n                        2008.[note: 131]She\n                    also referred to the financial statements of the Malaysian\n                    companies of which the Husband was a director. These\n                    financial statements indicated that directors’ fees,\n                    remuneration and bonuses of various amounts were paid. The\n                    amounts that were paid out exceeded the Husband’s\n                    disclosed Malaysia-sourced income (ie, RM96,000 per annum).[note: 132]The Wife\n                    submitted that it was “logical to believe”\n                    that the Husband received most if not all of the money that\n                    these companies paid to its directors.[note: 133] 71     The Husband explained that\n                    the inconsistencies in relation to the source of his income\n                    were mistakes.[note: 134]As for\n                    the directors’ fees paid by the other Malaysian\n                    companies, he explained that hisfellow\n                        directorsreceived those amounts.[note: 135]He\n                    asserted that his annual income from Malaysia was, as\n                    declared,viz,\n                        RM96,000.[note: 136]As\n                    documentary evidence, he produced his Malaysian tax\n                        return.[note: 137]He also\n                    produced the income tax notices of his fellow directors\n                    disclosing that they received the relevant directors’\n                    fees, remuneration and bonuses.[note: 138]At the hearing before me,\n                    his counsel also offered to arrange for these directors to\n                    file affidavits to confirm that they received those\n                        amounts.[note: 139] 72     I accept the\n                    Husband’s explanations for the inconsistencies in the\n                    source of his income. I also accept that his\n                    Malaysia-sourced income was only RM96,000. His assertion\n                    that he only received that amount was not unsubstantiated.\n                    He was able to produce documentary evidence which, on its\n                    face, supported his assertion. (III)   Loan from Alldo Resources to Rhino\n                Distributors 73     The Wife also referred to\n                    the unaudited balance sheets of Rhino Distributors for the\n                    years which ended on 31 December 2007 and\n                    31 December 2008. The balance sheets disclosed a loan\n                    from Alldo Resources in the amount of\n                        RM1,139,229.32.[note: 140]The\n                    Wife submitted that Yong Jun, who was a director and 50%\n                    owner of Alldo Resources, was a cover for the\n                        Husband.[note: 141]She\n                    asserted that the Husband was running Alldo Resources even\n                    though he claimed to have no interest in the\n                        company.[note: 142] 74     The Husband referred to an\n                    affidavit by Yong Jun in which Yong Jun deposed that he is a\n                    director and shareholder of Alldo Resources and that the\n                    Husband had helped him to run the business while he was\n                    studying in Australia.[note: 143]As for\n                    the loan from Alldo Resources to Rhino Distributors, the\n                    Husband pointed out that theauditedaccounts of Rhino Distributors do\n                    not reveal that such a loan was made.[note: 144] 75     I accept that the\n                    Husband’s role in Alldo Resources was to assist Yong\n                    Jun in running the business. There is no reason to\n                    disbelieve Yong Jun’s evidence that he was a\n                    shareholder and director of Alldo Resources and that his\n                    father’s role in the company was to simply assist him\n                    in running it in his absence. In view of this finding, the\n                    issue of whether a loan was made to Rhino Distributors is\n                    immaterial. (IV)   Expenses beyond disclosed\n                income 76     The Wife submitted that\n                    the Husband’s disclosed monthly expenses totalled\n                    S$20,875, excluding his own personal and other\n                        expenses.[note: 145]The Husband’s counsel disputed this estimation. He\n                    said it included Yong Jun’s expenses for his overseas\n                    education even though Yong Jun had completed his\n                        education.[note: 146]However, even so, the Husband’s expenses exceeded his\n                    declared monthly income of S$6,163.50 and\n                        RM8,000.[note: 147]At the\n                    exchange rate of RM2.47 per unit of SGD (see[20]above), his net monthly\n                    income is S$9,402.37. His expenses far exceed his\n                    income. 77     The Husband’s\n                    explanation for how he is able to cope with the shortfall is\n                    as follows:[note: 148] (a)     He charged some\n                        of his expenses, such as for his cars and his meals, to\n                        his companies. (b)     The expenses for his car (the\n                        Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle) were paid for by Chong Park\n                        Singapore. (c)     Fan assisted him financially by\n                        making contributions to his personal\n                    expenses. 78     I do not accept the\n                    Husband’s explanation for how he is able to maintain\n                    his expenses with his current income. Even if the first two\n                    explanations are taken into account, the shortfall is still\n                    substantial. His claim that Fan assists him financially is a\n                    bare assertion. The Husband must have some other undisclosed\n                    assets or sources of income to support his\n                expenses. (V)   Other assets 79     The Wife claimed that the\n                    Husband tried to hide his purchase of the Mercedes Benz 250E\n                        Vehicle.[note: 149] 80     I accept the\n                    Husband’s explanation that the non-disclosure of the\n                    purchase was not intentional. The Husband’s\n                    explanation is that the non-disclosure of the new vehicle\n                    was an error because it had the same license number as his\n                    previous vehicle (ie, the\n                    Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle). He further explained that he\n                    had no intention to hide the purchase because he exhibited a\n                    document on the Preferential Additional Registration Fee /\n                    Certificate of Entitlement rebate for the Mercedes Benz 250E\n                    Vehicle in his second affidavit of assets and means. If his\n                    non-disclosure was intentional, he would not have disclosed\n                    that document.[note: 150] 81     Finally, the Wife referred\n                    to the Husband’s failure to disclose the existence of\n                    his four Standard Chartered Bank accounts (see[34]above). The Wife first\n                    raised the existence of three of these accounts in her\n                    second affidavit of assets and means dated 23 February\n                        2010.[note: 151]The Husband\n                    then disclosed the four accounts in his second affidavit of\n                    assets and means dated 21 September 2010.[note: 152]The\n                    Husband’s explanation for his non-disclosure was that\n                    the accounts were closed and the balances were used to\n                    finance the operations of Rhino Distributors. His\n                    explanation was not satisfactory because the accounts were\n                    only closed in the course of 2009.[note: 153]There is no reason\n                    why the accounts should not have been disclosed in his first\n                    affidavit of assets and means. (B)   Alleged non-disclosures by the\n                Wife 82     The Husband argued that an\n                    adverse inference should be drawn against the Wife for her\n                    alleged non-disclosure of income. These arguments were made\n                    in the context of the Wife’s claims for maintenance.\n                    However, they are also relevant to the issue of division of\n                    matrimonial assets. Hence, I will consider his arguments\n                    here. 83     The Husband first argued\n                    that the Wife claimed to have given tuition for about 10\n                    hours a week, which earned her S$540 per month. The Husband\n                    argued that the figures did not tally because, according to\n                    him, the market rate for tuition is at least S$40–S$50\n                    per hour. Hence, the Wife should be earning a total of\n                    S$1,600–S$2,000 a month.[note: 154]He\n                    also argued that the Wife’s disclosures of her recent\n                    jobs, and her income from those jobs, were not supported by\n                    any documentary evidence. I accept the Wife’s\n                    explanation that her income from tuition was not as much as\n                    the Husband asserted because of her relatively lower level\n                    of education (she has an “Ordinary” Level\n                    General Certificate of Education).[note: 155]I do\n                    not consider her failure to produce documentary evidence to\n                    substantiate her other sources of income to be of any\n                    significance. The Wife actually disclosed that she received\n                    income from those sources. 84     Next, the Husband argued\n                    that the Wife failed to disclose her dividend income from\n                    her shares.[note: 156]The\n                    Wife’s explanation was that she was not able to obtain\n                    records of the dividends that she received in the years 2008\n                    and 2009 and that she was only able to deduce the amount of\n                    dividends that she earned in the year 2010.[note: 157]I find\n                    that the Wife did not deliberately fail to disclose her\n                    dividend income. Her very first affidavit of assets and\n                    means exhibited her notice of assessment of taxable income\n                    (dated 5 August 2008).[note: 158]This\n                    assessment noted her dividend income. 85     Finally, the Husband\n                    submits that the Wife failed to disclose the existence of\n                    her investments in unit trusts and her shares in Malaysian\n                    companies until her third affidavit of assets and\n                        means.[note: 159]This\n                    is not strictly accurate because her first affidavit of\n                    assets and means exhibited her CPF Investment Scheme Special\n                    Account Investment Portfolio.[note: 160]This\n                    portfolio statement disclosed three of her investments in\n                    unit trusts. Hence, the Wife could only be said to have\n                    breached her duty of full and frank disclosurevis-à-visone of her investments and\n                    her investment in Malaysian shares (which she claims was\n                    inadvertent – see[48]above). The just and equitable apportionment 86     The Husband submitted that\n                    the Matrimonial Home should be sold, with the proceeds to be\n                    apportioned in the ratio of 60:40 in his favour. He further\n                    proposed that each party retain the assets held in his or\n                    her name.[note: 161] 87     The Wife submitted that\n                    the Husband’s share of the Matrimonial Home should be\n                    transferred to her because she has been living there since\n                    its purchase and she wants to retain her present lifestyle.\n                    She proposed that the Husband transfer his share without any\n                    refund to his CPF account. She also proposed that the\n                    Husband should repay the outstanding mortgage\n                        loan.[note: 162]As for the\n                    other assets, she made the following proposals:[note: 163] (a)     She will not\n                        “make a claim” on the Husband’s\n                        share of the Baywater Property.[note: 164] (b)     Chong Park\n                        Singapore should be valued and the Husband should buy\n                        over her share in Chong Park Singapore at 50% of the\n                        determined value. (c)     The Husband’s Malaysian\n                        companies should be valued and the Wife should be\n                        entitled to 50% of the Husband’s shares in the\n                        companies. (d)     The Husband is to repay the\n                        outstanding loan taken on the Great Eastern Life Policy\n                        (see[21]above).\n                        The Wife submitted that the Great Eastern Life Policy\n                        should be maintained because insurers are unwilling to\n                        provide her with coverage because of her medical\n                        condition (she suffers from Systemic Lupus\n                        Erythematosus, scoliosis and myofascial\n                            syndrome[note: 165]). (e)     The Wife should be\n                        given 50% of the Husband’s money in his bank\n                        accounts (including the amount in the Public Growth\n                        Fund). (f)     The Wife also proposed that she be\n                        given 50% of the HSBC Structured Investment. However,\n                        this proposal is no longer tenable in view of my\n                        conclusion that this investment was not a matrimonial\n                        asset (see[35]above). (g)     The Wife will not “make a\n                        claim” on the Husband’s CPF savings and\n                        shares in listed companies. (h)     The Husband should transfer\n                        his SRC membership to the Wife. (i)     The Husband should\n                        transfer ownership of the Alfa Romeo 2.0 Vehicle to the\n                        Wife. He should repay the outstanding loan on the\n                        vehicle. (j)     The Wife should be allowed to keep\n                        her shares in listed companies because she claims to\n                        have started her investments before her marriage. She\n                        further claims that some of the shares belonged to her\n                        father. (k)     The Wife should retain her CPF\n                        monies, investments in unit trusts, shares in Malaysian\n                        companies and her savings in her bank account with Yong\n                        Jun. 88     The Wife’s approach\n                    will entail more costs and administrative burden for both\n                    parties because several assets will have to be transferred.\n                    As I noted above, I consider it to be in the interests of\n                    fairness and justice that I take a global approach to\n                    dividing the matrimonial assets in the light of the direct\n                    and indirect contributions, as well as other relevant\n                    factors (see[5]above). 89     In addition to the factors\n                    that I have already considered above (viz, the direct and indirect contributions\n                    and the non-disclosures), I should also consider the\n                    following in deciding on the proportion of the\n                    division: (a)     There is no\n                        indication that the Wife paid any rent for her exclusive\n                        occupation of the Matrimonial Home since the Husband\n                        moved out in 1996. This is a relevant consideration\n                        under the Charter (see s 112(2)(f) of the\n                        Charter); (b)     The parties had a fairly long\n                        marriage (they were married for 31 years), however, they\n                        were also separated for an extended period of 14\n                        years. 90     Taking into account the\n                    direct and indirect contributions of the parties, the\n                    non-disclosures by the parties (with the Husband’s\n                    non-disclosures being more substantial), the fact that the\n                    Wife enjoyed a substantial period of rent-free occupation\n                    and the fact that the parties were separated for a\n                    substantial proportion of their long marriage, I order that\n                    the matrimonial assets should be divided equally. On this\n                    division, each party is entitled to\n                S$1,290,245.22. 91     The Wife requested in her\n                    skeletal arguments for the Husband to repay a S$36,000 loan\n                    that she alleges he took out against the Great Eastern Life\n                    Policy (see[21]above).\n                    The fact that this loan was taken out before was not\n                    previously disclosed. It was suggested above at[21]that there is no evidence\n                    of the existence of the loan. I therefore disregard this\n                    allegation. Consequential orders 92     I make these orders with a\n                    view to minimising the reshuffling of assets and ensuring a\n                    clean break in the parties’ relationship: (a)     The Wife is to\n                        transfer her shares in Chong Park Singapore to the\n                        Husband for a nominal consideration of S$1. With this\n                        order, the assets in the Wife’s name will be\n                        reduced to S$434,540.83. A sum of S$855,704.39 would\n                        have to be paid to her to equalise the division of\n                        matrimonial assets. I will round this down to\n                        S$855,000. (b)     The Matrimonial Home is to be sold on\n                        the open market within a period of six months from the\n                        date of this judgment, with liberty to apply for further\n                        extensions if necessary. A sum of S$855,000 from the\n                        sale proceeds is to be paid to the Wife. This amountincludesthe CPF\n                        monies which she spent in the purchase of the\n                        Matrimonial Home. (c)     The remainder of the sale proceeds is\n                        to be paid to the Husband. (d)     The Joint Account is to be\n                        closed. The remaining balance is to be paid to the\n                        Husband.",

If\n                                one takes a case where there is a decree granted\n                                to a wife petitioner on the grounds of five\n                                years’ separation and no question arises\n                                of misconduct by either husband or wife, the\n                                wife may be receiving an appreciable income of\n                                her own—for example from practice as a\n                                doctor or from the profits of a\n                                business—which is much greater than that\n                                of her husband. From the way the parties behaved\n                                before the breakdown, it may be clear that, but\n                                for the breakdown, the wife would have continued\n                                to be the financial mainstay of the family. It\n                                would hardly be right for the husband to claim\n                                that, on divorce, he was entitled to be put back\n                                in his financial status quo, even if this meant\n                                the wife's paying him more than half her\n                                income. It is notoriously true that two\n                                separate homes are much more expensive to run\n                                than one. It will, therefore, in almost every\n                                case be impracticable so to reallocate the\n                                resources of the parties as to put one spouse in\n                                his or her pre-breakdown financial position\n                                without drastically reducing the standard of\n                                living of the other. In some cases, for example\n                                where that other's conduct is the more\n                                blameworthy, this may be a fair result. But\n                                where there is no question of one being more to\n                                blame than the other, it will not be fair. The\n                                principle underlying the Amendment is that the\n                                court should aim at getting as near as possible\n                                to putting both parties in their pre-breakdown\n                                financial position, so that, where some\n                                reduction in the standard of living is\n                                inevitable (as it usually will be), that\n                                reduction is shared and not borne entirely by\n                                one party—save where his own bad conduct\n                                makes it just that he should be the one to\n                                suffer the greater financial\n                            loss. [emphasis added] Consequently (and in accordance with this commonsense\n                        holistic approach), our courts have held,inter alia, that a former wife\n                        must, where possible, exert reasonable efforts to secure\n                        gainful employment and contribute to preserve her\n                        pre-breakdown lifestyle: see, for\n                            example,Quek Lee\n                            Tiamat [22] andNI v\n                            NJat [14]–[16]. [emphasis in original] 96     The Husband submitted that\n                    the Wife has a large share portfolio from which she earns\n                    “sizeable dividends”. He also submitted that\n                    she has not disclosed the sources of her income and that she\n                    can earn as much as S$4,800 to S$6,000 per month, if not\n                    more. Given these circumstances, he submitted that no order\n                    of maintenance should be made.[note: 166]It should\n                    be noted that the Husband’s allegations in relation to\n                    the Wife’s sources of income and the amount that she\n                    earned from tuition have been dealt with above (see[83]). I accepted\n                    the Wife’s explanations. 97     The Wife estimated her\n                    monthly expenses at S$3,260. She submitted that in order to\n                    sustain her present lifestyle, she would need monthly\n                    maintenance in the sum of S$5,000. This represents an\n                    increase of S$1,500 from the S$3,500 that she used to\n                    receive from the Husband after she resigned from her\n                    employment in 1993. She justified the increased amount on\n                    the basis of an increase in living and medical costs and her\n                    need to employ a full-time maid in the light of her medical\n                        condition.[note: 167]She also\n                    wanted her maintenance payments to be backdated to the date\n                    of filing of the writ for divorce. She submitted that she\n                    should receive lump sum maintenance of S$720,000 on the\n                    basis of a 12-year multiplier.[note: 168] 98     In my view, maintenance in\n                    the amount of S$720,000 was extravagant in the light of the\n                    assets and means of the parties. As I have noted above, the\n                    Husband has not fully disclosed his assets and income.\n                    However, his non-disclosures were taken into account in the\n                    division of matrimonial assets, with the effect that the\n                    Wife was awarded a higher proportion of the matrimonial\n                    assets than I would have awarded if full disclosure was\n                    made. I should also take into account the fact that the Wife\n                    has a considerable portfolio of shares from which she earned\n                    a dividend income of S$6,056 in the year 2008.[note: 169]She\n                    is also presently working as a part-time teaching assistant,\n                    from which she derived an income of between S$200 and S$500\n                    per month.[note: 170] 99     In my view, a sum that is\n                    more reasonable in view of the Husband’s means is\n                    S$2,000 per month. This is not too far from the S$1,600 per\n                    month maintenance payment that the Husband proposed in his\n                    first affidavit of assets and means.[note: 171]Neither is it\n                    far from the amount that the Wife sought in her first\n                    affidavit of assets and means (she sought an amount of\n                        S$3,000).[note: 172]I would\n                    prefer to order lump sum maintenance. There is no fixed rule\n                    on the multiplier to be used for this purpose (seeFoo Ah Yanat [18]). The Husband was 55\n                    years of age at the time of the filing of his first\n                    affidavit of assets and means on 8 June 2009. This\n                    means that he is presently 57 or 58 years old. The Wife is\n                    54 or 55 years old at present. In the circumstances, a\n                    multiplier of 12 years would be excessive. I will use a\n                    multiplier of eight years. On this multiplier, the lump sum\n                    maintenance award is S$192,000. This sum is to be paid\n                    within a month of the completion of the sale of the\n                    Matrimonial Home. 100    The Wife also sought the\n                    recovery of arrears of maintenance in the amount of\n                    S$49,378.48 from 2005 to 2008.[note: 173]She\n                    claims that, since 2005, when the Husband purchased the\n                    Baywater Property, he ceased reimbursing her for monthly\n                    expenses. She claimed that the Husband only paid her S$1,000\n                        sporadically.[note: 174]The\n                    Husband disputed the Wife’s claims for arrears. He\n                    asserted that there is no basis for such a claim. He also\n                    pointed out that the court had made an order for him to pay\n                    monthly maintenance of S$1,000 from November 2008. No order\n                    was made for the payment of arrears.[note: 175]I agree.\n                    The Wife has not explained the basis for her to claim those\n                    amounts, which allegedly accruedpriorto the institution of the divorce\n                    proceedings, in these ancillary proceedings.",
        "Maintenance of Yong Li": "101    Yong Li is presently\n                    above the age of 21 years. She is undergoing her university\n                    education. She is entitled to maintenance under\n                    s 69(5)(c) of the Charter. The Husband is presently\n                    paying for her expenses and her school fees.[note: 176]Yong Li\n                    confirmed in an affidavit that the Husband is indeed paying\n                    for her educational and other additional\n                        expenses.[note: 177] 102    In the circumstances, I\n                    will make no order for the Husband to pay the Wife\n                    maintenance for Yong Li. Yong Li may, of course, apply for\n                    maintenance herself should the Husband cease to pay her\n                    maintenance (see s 69(3)(b) of the\n                Charter).",
        "Conclusion": "103    Considering all the\n                    facts and circumstances of this case, I make no order as to\n                    costs subject to the following.
