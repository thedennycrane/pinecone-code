        "(i) Late delivery": "7. There are 2 aspects to the issue of late delivery. Firstly, the parties had originally agreed\n\non delivery by 30 March 2000, failing which liquidated damages would be imposed. The Plaintiffs\n\nagree that this deadline was not met and that pursuant to this provision they are liable for the sum\n\nof EUR 33,333. However this only comprises a small part of the total that the Defendants are\n\nclaiming under the BG.8. The dispute lies in the second aspect of this matter. The new deadline for delivery was 30\n\nApril 2000. Should the Plaintiffs fail to achieve this, liquidated damages at a rate of 2.5% per\n\nmonth (pro rated daily) would be payable. The Defendants allege that delivery was effected only on 6\n\nMay 2001 and that the liquidated damages for this amounts to EUR 32,876. The Plaintiffs do not\n\ndisagree with the arithmetic, but allege that they had complied with the delivery provision by 30\n\nApril 2000.9. The Plaintiffs' case is as follows. The delivery provision in the amended contract, clause\n\n10.2(b), reads as follows:\"Subject to this Agreement if the Vessel is not completed by the Builder as evidenced by\n\n  the execution by the parties of the Protocol of Completion on or before 29 February 2000 at the\n\n  Port of Delivery, or the Vessel does not arrive in Pointe-a-Pitre on or before 30 April 2000, the\n\n  Operator shall have the right to rescind the sale of the Vessel by notice to the Builder and upon\n\n  doing so title to the Vessel shall revert to and revest in the Builder. The Builder shall pay to\n\n  the Purchaser as liquidated damages an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Basic Purchase\n\n  Price.\"The Plaintiffs say that the Passion arrived at Point-a-Pitre before 20 April 2000 and therefore\n\nthey had satisfied this provision.10. The Defendants contend that delivery was only completed at the earliest on 6 May. They said\n\nthat while the Passion may have arrived at Guadeloupe on 23 April, she was not offloaded from the\n\ncargo vessel; instead the Plaintiffs' sub-contractors began work on the required modifications. The\n\nPassion was unloaded on 25 April and the sub-contractors continued with the modification works. It\n\nwas not until 5 May that the Plaintiffs requested the Defendants to sign the Protocol of Completion.\n\nThe Defendants refused to sign it on various grounds, some of which are dealt with below. At the\n\nhearing before me, they were prepared to accept that delivery was made on 6 May as they took over\n\nthe Passion on that date.11. The Plaintiffs point out that the Passion did \"arrive\" at Pointe-a-Pitre before 30\n\nApril 2000, even if she was not operational by then. The Defendants contend that this provision\n\nrequired that she be operational by then. This question is one for the arbitrator to determine but\n\nit cannot be said that the Defendants' position is untenable. This is because the Plaintiffs'\n\nposition, taken to the extreme, would mean that so long as all the components of the Passion are at\n\nPointe-a-Pitre, they are not under any obligation to get her to be operational by a stipulated date.\n\nIn my view, it cannot be said that the Defendants were unreasonable in holding the view that because\n\nthe Plaintiffs only requested them to sign the Protocol of Completion on 5 May, liquidated damages\n\nfor late delivery is payable up to that date.",
        "(ii) Failure to attain specified speed": "12. Clause 15.1 of the Agreement provides as follows:\"15 PERFORMANCE15.1 Speed (a) The Builder hereby warrants that the continuous speed of the Vessel shall be 40\n\n  knots at 5816 kw corresponding to 100% of maximum continuous power with a load of 41.5 tons, in\n\n  calm weather, wind and sea not exceeding Beaufort 3 and 2 respectively, with clean hull.(b) If the actual continuous speed of the Vessel during sea trials varies from the guaranteed\n\n    value of 40 knots, the Basic Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows -Actual continuous speed Reduction in Speed (knots) Basic Purchase Price (percent) up to 39.5\n\nknots 0 below 39.5 knots USD 10,000 per 0.1 knotShould the actual continuous speed as measured on sea trials fall below 37.50 knots the Operator\n\nshall have the right to reject the Vessel and terminate this Agreement.\"13. Sea trials were conducted on 27 and 28 January 2000 at which the Passion attained a maximum\n\ncontinuous speed of 41.9 knots and an average of 41.35 knots. The Plaintiffs argue that the vessel\n\nwas therefore in conformity with clause 15.1(a) and there was no basis for the Defendants' complaint\n\nin this respect.14. The Defendants say that the sea trial was defective in that the engines of the vessel were\n\noverloaded to achieve that speed. In support of this, the Defendants exhibited a letter from the\n\nengine supplier which stated that the engines were overloaded by about 8.3% to 13.9% during the sea\n\ntrials and warned that the warranty for those engines would be affected unless corrective action was\n\ntaken in respect of the overloading problem. By the time the engine supplier sent this letter, the\n\nvessel was already being transported to Point-a-Pitre. Therefore a further sea trial in Singapore\n\nwas impossible.15. The Defendants engaged a surveyor to conduct sea trials at Guadeloupe on 26 and 27 June 2000.\n\nThe surveyor reported a speed of between 37 and 38 knots. Based on an average of 37.5 knots, the\n\nDefendants say that the formula in clause 15.1(b) entitles them to make a claim for US$250,000 which\n\nis equivalent to approximately EUR285,000.16. The Plaintiffs allege that this sea trial was not done in their presence as required under\n\nthe Agreement. This is not disputed by the Defendants. However this does not detract from the fact\n\nthat there is a claim by the Defendants against the Plaintiffs in respect of the speed performance\n\nof the Passion. It would be necessary for the arbitrator determine whether the Plaintiffs have\n\nsatisfied this provision. Whether this is done by a further sea trial or by some other means would\n\nbe a matter for the arbitrator to decide. For the present, the Defendants have this claim, and so\n\nfar as they have been capable of determining it, the Passion could only reach 37.5 knots and their\n\nclaim rested on that basis. I cannot see anything unreasonable in that position.",
        "(iii) Miscellaneous defects": "17. The Defendants alleged that there were various defects to the Passion that were not rectified\n\nby the time they took over the vessel and that they either had repaired or would have to do so.\n\nHowever at the hearing before me the Defendants had not provided any quantification of these repair\n\ncosts. Therefore I would have to disregard them in relation to this application.",
        "(iv) Fifth engine": "18. The Passion was designed as a vessel with 4 engines. However the Agreement, as modified,\n\nobliges the Plaintiffs to supply a fifth engine which is to be used as a spare. This obligation is\n\nnot denied by the Plaintiffs. Neither do they deny that the Passion was supplied without the fifth\n\nengine. However the Plaintiffs raised issues as to whether they were liable to the Defendants for\n\nthis engine rather than to a third party. The Plaintiffs also submit that the BG states that it is\n\nfor the purposes of securing their obligations pursuant to clauses 10.2(b), 14.7, 15.1 and 19 of the\n\nAgreement and only to those clauses. Therefore even if they were in breach of their obligations to\n\nsupply the fifth engine, this was outside the scope of the BG.19. The Defendants contend that this breach did fall within one of those provisions, namely\n\nclause 10.2(b) which is set out in paragraph 9 above. This relates to the completion or arrival of\n\nthe \"Vessel\". The Defendants say that the Passion was not in conformity with the\n\nspecifications and therefore did not fall within the definition of \"Vessel\" in the\n\nAgreement. That term is defined in clause 1.1 as meaning (emphasis added):\" a 43 metre Catamaran vessel with all its components which is the subject of this\n\n  Agreement having the Yard Number H162 allocated to it by the Builder to be, or being constructed,\n\n  awaiting delivery or delivered as the case may be.\"Thus, the Defendants argue, if the Passion did not have all its components, she was not the\n\n\"Vessel\" as defined. The term \"components\" is defined in the same clause as\n\nmeaning:\" everything which forms or is intended to form part of the Vessel or to be placed in\n\n  or on the Vessel and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes the hull,\n\n  engines, machinery, appliances, appurtenances, equipment, gear, fittings, furniture and\n\n  stores;\"Since she did not have the fifth engine which is one of the \"components\" of the\n\n\"Vessel\", it would follow that the Passion was not the \"Vessel\" as defined in\n\nthe Agreement. Therefore the Plaintiffs were in breach of their delivery obligation under clause\n\n10.2(b).20. Although the Defendants' argument appears to be a technical one, nevertheless it is not\n\nuntenable and one which ought to be dealt with by the arbitrator. Accordingly, I am satisfied that\n\nthe Defendants' claim in this respect is perfectly reasonable. It is for a sum of EUR 278,000 and\n\nthe Plaintiffs do not deny that this is the price of an engine.",
        "Unconscionability and fraud": "21. The Defendants' claims appear to be entirely reasonable. In any event, there is clearly no\n\nfraud. The only question is whether it is unconscionable for them to make the demand. In Eltraco\n\nInternational Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd[2000] 4 SLR 290the Court of Appeal stated that in considering\n\nunconscionability, the entire picture must be viewed, taking into account all the relevant factors.\n\nIn the matter before them the court found that it was not unconscionable for a beneficiary to make a\n\ncall on a demand bond where there was a genuine dispute between the parties on liability. The court\n\nsaid at para 32:\"32. At the time the respondents called on the bond on 18 February 2000, the appellants\n\n  had clearly not rectified all the defects listed in the November 2000 schedule. The earlier joint\n\n  inspection of 2 February 2000 is evidence of that. Furthermore, the appellants also disputed that\n\n  they were liable for all the defects. Quite clearly, there were genuine disputes between the\n\n  parties - both as to the extent of the defect liability and the cost of the rectification works.\n\n  In the circumstances, the learned judge was entitled to find that as regards both matters, the\n\n  extent of the defect liability and the cost for rectifying the same, were unclear to him. In the\n\n  light of the foregoing, we do not see how the call on the bond by the respondents can be termed to\n\n  be abusive. The respondents are entitled to protect their own interest. In our opinion, there is\n\n  nothing improper on the part of the respondents in calling on the bond. The defendants` concern\n\n  was further aggravated by the fact that there was some evidence then that the appellants were in\n\n  financial difficulties.\"22. In the present case, the BG was issued for the purpose of providing \"security for the\n\nfulfilment of the obligations\" of the Plaintiffs under the Agreement. It is an undertaking by\n\nthe bank to pay upon receipt of the Defendants' written demand. It is an ordinary on-demand bond\n\nclearly intended to entitle the Defendants the right to receive such sum from the bank as they, in\n\ntheir bona fide view, determine that the Plaintiffs are liable to them under the relevant provisions\n\nof the Agreement. A demand made by the Plaintiffs on the grounds described above would fall within\n\nwhat is contemplated in the Agreement. In those circumstances, I cannot see how such a demand would\n\nbe unconscionable as would move the court to continue the injunction. Accordingly I discharged it.",
        "Material non-disclosure": "23. The Defendants also point out that the Plaintiffs had, in their application for the ex parte\n\ninjunction, failed to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts. They submit that the\n\nnature of the non-disclosure of itself justifies discharging the injunction.24. The ex parte application was supported by an affidavit filed by Priscilla Lim, a director of\n\nthe Plaintiffs. After citing the relevant provisions of the Agreement, Lim said in paragraph 9 that:\n\n\"9. The Plaintiffs delivered the Vessel to the Port of Final Delivery on 23 April 2000. The\n\nDefendants, however, wrongfully refused to take delivery of the Vessel until 5 May 2000 and\n\nwrongfully refused to sign the Protocol of Transit.\"Lim then continued by saying that the Defendants unilaterally declared that the Vessel only\n\narrived on 15 May 2000 and claimed liquidated damages on that basis. No mention was made of the\n\nbasis of the Defendants' claim as I had set out above, i.e. that the Passion was not unloaded from\n\nthe carrier vessel until 25 April, that the Plaintiffs' sub-contractors were working on her\n\nthereafter and that it was not until 5 May that the Plaintiffs requested the Defendants to sign the\n\nProtocol of Completion. The impression given by Lim is that the Defendants had absolutely no basis\n\nfor their claim of late delivery and therefore their behaviour was fraudulent.25. The affidavit then turns to the Defendants' claim in relation to the speed of the vessel. Lim\n\nsaid that it was made fraudulently because:(i) sea trials conducted jointly in Singapore recorded a speed of 41.7 knots which was above\n\n  the 40 knots specified;(ii) the Defendants' allegation that the Vessel was not up to speed was based on sea trials\n\n  conducted by them in the absence of the Plaintiffs' representatives;(iii) the conditions of the Defendants' unilateral sea trials were suspect because the weather\n\n  conditions were not recorded; and(iv) the modification works carried out would at most have reduced the speed by 0.5 to 1.0\n\n  knots.26. Lim thus gave the impression that a proper sea trial had been done in Singapore and that it\n\nwas witnessed by both parties. At that sea trial the Passion had recorded a speed of 41.7 knots,\n\nwell in excess of the specified speed of 40 knots. Therefore it was fraudulent of the Defendants to\n\ngo on to conduct a further speed trial under spurious conditions in which the Plaintiffs'\n\nrepresentatives were not present and then claim that the Passion did not attain the speed specified.\n\nLim did not disclose in her affidavit that the sea trial in Singapore was unacceptable because the\n\nengines were overloaded when the speeds of 41.7 knots was achieved.27. A party applying ex parte for an injunction on an urgent basis owes a duty to the court to\n\nset out all the relevant facts, in particular any possible defence that would weaken his case for an\n\ninjunction. But even if there has been material non-disclosure, the court nevertheless has the\n\ndiscretion to continue an injunction if the justice of the case requires it: see Dauphin Offshore\n\nEngineering & Trading Pte Ltd v The Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al\n\nNahyan[2000] 1 SLR 657at para 48. In the present case, not only did Lim fail to\n\ndisclose those matters which she was aware of and highlight the relevant correspondence in her\n\naffidavit, she had gone out of the way to paint a wholly different picture in order to attach fraud\n\non the Defendants and in so doing had misled the court. The Plaintiffs had presented such a\n\ndistorted view of the facts that to ignore their non-disclosure would be to reward such behaviour\n\nand encourage similar acts by other parties. Therefore, on this basis alone, the injunction ought to\n\nbe discharged.",
        "English law": "28. The foregoing are sufficient grounds for my decision to discharge the injunction. However in\n\nthe course of writing this judgment, I discovered an interesting point which deserves ventilation.29. Both the Agreement and BG are expressed to be governed by English law. It was held in New\n\nCivilbuild Pte Ltd v Guobena Snd Bhd[1999] 1 SLR 374that there was no concept of unconscionability in English\n\nlaw in relation to on-demand bonds and that fraud was the sole exception. The court went on to find\n\nthat the Court of Appeal in Bocotra Construction Pte Ltd v A-G (No 2)[1995] 2 SLR 733did not rule otherwise, notwithstanding that the term\n\nunconscionability was used in that judgment. However in GHL Pte Ltd v Unitrack Building Construction\n\nPte Ltd[1999] 4 SLR 604the Court of Appeal disagreed with that view and held\n\nthat the court in Bocotra had made a conscious departure from English law in that unconscionability\n\nwas another exception under Singapore law. The court held (at para 16):\"It is abundantly clear from the judgment that the court expressly held that `fraud or\n\n  unconscionability` was a ground on which the court would interfere and restrain the enforcement of\n\n  a performance bond. It is significant that in that judgment the court on no less than three\n\n  occasions referred consistently to `fraud or unconscionability` as a ground for the grant of an\n\n  injunction. We should add that the concept of `unconscionability` was adopted after deliberation,\n\n  and was not inadvertently inserted as a result of a slip; nor was it intended to be used\n\n  synonymously or interchangeably with `fraud`. There is nothing in that judgment which can be said\n\n  to indicate or suggest that the court did not decide that `unconscionability` alone is not a\n\n  separate ground as distinct from fraud. We accept that to that extent, Bocotra is a departure, and\n\n  if we may respectfully say so, a conscious departure, from the English position.\"30. This position is reinforced in the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Eltraco\n\nInternational Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd[2000] 4 SLR 290. In that judgment, the court referred to the English\n\ndecision of Cargill International SA & Anor v Bangladesh Sugar & Food Industries Corp [1996] 4 All ER 563 and observed as follows (at para 38):\"38 There is one other observation on Cargill International which we should make. If the\n\n  fact situation in that case were to recur in a Singapore case, the court here might well have\n\n  issued a restraint on the call since unconscionability is a ground on which a Singapore court\n\n  would grant restraint, unlike the position in England.\"31. As unconscionability is not an exception in English law, there is the question as to whether\n\nthe Plaintiffs may rely upon this ground in addition to fraud because the relevant contracts, i.e.\n\nthe Agreement and the BG, are governed by English law. However this issue is not necessary for my\n\ndecision and I did not have the benefit of submissions from counsel. Therefore I will be content to\n\nmerely raise it here and leave this question to be decided elsewhere.Sgd:LEE SEIU KINJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
