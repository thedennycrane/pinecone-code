        "The Statement of Facts": "The Accused person is Lee Chuan Leong Vincent (hereinafter \"the\n\naccused\") male / 33 years, NRIC : S 1773673 F of Blk 552 Pasir Ris St 52 #10-87.2. The victim is Yong Sze Hui, (hereinafter \" the victim \")\n\n  female / 14 years, a Secondary 2 student of Monk’s Hill Secondary School. She is\n\n  residing at No. 25 Sian Tuan Avenue, Singapore.3. Investigations revealed that sometime in early August 1999, the\n\n  accused met Zhou Jian Guang @ Guo Ping, ( hereinafter \"Guo Ping\" ), male / 26\n\n  years and Shi Song Jing @ Ah Jing ) male / 29 years at a coffee shop located behind\n\n  Hougang Plaza. Guo Ping and Ah Jing are both nationals of the People’s Republic of\n\n  China. Guo Ping and Ah Jing asked the accused whether he could help them find a job in\n\n  Singapore. A few days later, they met up again at a hawker centre in Hougang. There, the\n\n  accused suggested that they conduct a kidnap for ransom and came up with the details to\n\n  execute the scheme. Guo Ping and Ah Jing agreed to the plan suggested by the accused.4. On 25 August 1999, the accused rented a house at No. 43 Lorong\n\n  Kismis through a housing agent from Mr K Sivanathan. The accused paid for the rental of\n\n  the house by way of a United Overseas Bank ( \"UOB\" ) cheque amounting to $2,600.\n\n  The accused also paid the housing agent, Mr Tham See Weng, $325 as commission by way of\n\n  another UOB cheque. The purpose of renting this house was to keep the victim there for the\n\n  duration of the kidnapping.5. On 26 August 1999, the accused proceeded to M/s National Automobile\n\n  Service at Block 5033 Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park 2 #01-279. There, he rented a Toyota\n\n  LiteAce motor van, bearing registration number GQ 3466 Y (hereinafter \"the\n\n  vehicle\" ). The accused paid for the rental of the vehicle using his Overseas Chinese\n\n  Banking Corporation Visa credit card.6. On the same day, the accused went to a shop in Ubi Industrial\n\n  Estate. There, he paid for a pair of false vehicle licence plates bearing number GQ 6292.\n\n  Later that day, the accused and Ah Jing fixed the false licence plates on to the vehicle.7 From 26 August 1999 till 8 September 1999, the accused, together with\n\n  Guo Ping and Ah Jing, drove around Singapore looking for victims to kidnap. The profile of\n\n  their intended target was that of a young schoolgirl. They decided to roam the Bukit Timah\n\n  area as they felt that it was a \"rich man\" area.8. On 9 September 1999, the victim was walking alone along Sian Tuan\n\n  Avenue on her way home. Near the junction of Sian Tuan Ave and Hua Guan Lane, the vehicle\n\n  was driven up to the victim. The accused was the driver of the vehicle. Ah Jing grabbed\n\n  the victim and pulled her into the van while Guo Ping closed the sliding door of the van\n\n  As the accused drove off, Guo Ping and Ah Jing blindfolded the victim and tied her up\n\n  using adhesive tapes.9. Upon arriving at No. 43 Lorong Kismis, the victim was carried into\n\n  one of the bedrooms of the house by Ah Jing. The accused then asked the victim questions\n\n  pertaining to her family’s wealth and background. The accused also obtained the\n\n  victim’s father’s handphone and residence telephone numbers from her.10. Shortly before 9.00 p.m. on 9 September 1999, the victim’s\n\n  father, Mr Yong Cher Keng, ( hereinafter \"Mr Yong\" ) received a call on his\n\n  handphone from the accused who spoke in Mandarin. The accused informed Mr Yong that the\n\n  victim was in his hands and demanded a sum of $500,000 for the release of the victim if he\n\n  wanted to see the victim again. The accused then hung up the phone.11. About 3 minutes later, Mr Yong again received another call from the\n\n  accused on his handphone. This time, the accused asked him if he had any problem in\n\n  raising the said amount of $500,000. Mr Yong expressed his difficulty in raising the\n\n  money. The accused then informed Mr Yong that he would call him back about half an hour\n\n  later. Immediately after this call, Mr Yong called ‘999’ and reported the matter\n\n  to the police.12. From the time of the police report till the release of the victim\n\n  there were numerous calls made by the accused to Mr Yong. Mr Yong negotiated with the\n\n  accused for the ransom to be reduced and it was eventually agreed that the amount would be\n\n  $330,000. During three of the phone calls, Mr Yong was allowed to speak to the victim. On\n\n  the instructions of the accused, the victim told Mr Yong that she was safe and that he\n\n  should not alert the Police and that he should get the ransom money ready. The accused\n\n  also told Mr Yong to put the ransom money in a bag for delivery. Mr Yong replied that he\n\n  had a black bag that he would use for the purpose.13. In the evening on 11 September 1999, the accused gave instructions\n\n  for Mr Yong to drive to Ponggol Marina Park to deliver the ransom money. Mr Yong complied,\n\n  bringing along with him a black bag containing $330,000. Thereafter, Mr Yong was told to\n\n  drive to Blk 127 Tampines St 11 where he was given further instructions on his handphone\n\n  by Ah Jing as to where to drop off the money. The bag containing the money was finally\n\n  dropped off at the grass verge near the overhead bridge. There the money was collected by\n\n  the accused and Ah Jing. On the way back, they threw the bag out of the car after\n\n  transferring the money into another carrier. Ah Jing then alighted from the car somewhere\n\n  at Hougang taking along with him the ransom money as the accused and he felt they were\n\n  being followed.14. Guo Ping remained with the victim in the house at No. 43, Lorong\n\n  Kismis when Ah Jing went with the accused to collect the ransom money. She was blindfolded\n\n  throughout her stay at No. 43 Lorong Kismis for a period of about 60 hours.15. On 12 September 1999 at about 7.40 a.m., the victim was released.\n\n  She managed to take a taxi and return home.16. At about 8.00 a.m., upon confirming that the victim had already\n\n  been safely released, the police arrested the accused at his residence at Blk 552 Pasir\n\n  Ris St 52 #10-87. On 14 September 1999 at 12.35 a.m., Guo Ping and Ah Jing were arrested\n\n  at a HDB flat in Telok Blangah Crescent.Mitigation Plea3.    Counsel for the accused urged the court to take\n\ninto account the accused’s plea of guilt as a mitigating factor. He submitted that\n\nthe accused realised that what he did was wrong. He admitted his wrong to the police in\n\nhis first statement and had maintained that stand throughout. Counsel submitted that only\n\na sentence of life imprisonment should be imposed because:(a) no acts of violence or injury was inflicted on the victim;(b) although there were some words of threats uttered to the victim,\n\n  none of the threats were carried out;(c) the victim was not specifically targetted;(d) the victim was taken care of and provided with food and her daily\n\n  needs while under captivity.4.    Counsel stated that the accused deeply regretted\n\nthe trauma caused to the victim including the pain and hardship caused to the family.\n\nAdditionally, he would testify for the prosecution in the pending trial against his\n\naccomplices, Zhou Jian Guang and Shi Song Jing. Some personal background of the accused\n\nwas given as part of the mitigation. Apparently, the accused was driven to commit the\n\nkidnapping because of the heavy financial losses he suffered in his share trading and the\n\nmounting medical bills arising from the late stage of his wife’s pregnancy at that\n\ntime. He was desperate. He therefore suggested the kidnapping scheme to Jian Guang and\n\nSong Jing whereby they could all be enriched. Counsel explained that the accused had to\n\nhire the van and rent the house to hide the kidnapped victim because his accomplices were\n\nforeign Chinese nationals and had no valid documents. It was not disputed by the\n\nprosecution that the accused fully cooperated with the police in their investigations and\n\nhad led the police to the place where the victim was detained. He had informed the police\n\nof the identity of his accomplices and had assisted the police officers in trapping them.5.    Counsel further submitted that caning was\n\ninappropriate and that life imprisonment itself was a sufficient deterrent. He referred me\n\nto:1.Sia Ah Kew & Ors v. P.P.(1972-1974) SLR 2082.P.P. v. Lee Soon Lee Vincent(1998) 3 SLR 552 @ 555",
        "My decision": "6.    I did not think it was appropriate to sentence the\n\naccused to death as the accused had pleaded guilty, he and his two accomplices were not\n\narmed and the victim was not ill-treated or hurt in any way except for the trauma which\n\nshe suffered from being kidnapped and blindfolded for a considerable period of time. I\n\ndecided that the alternative sentence of life imprisonment was the proper sentence in the\n\nparticular circumstances of this case. However, I was at first minded to impose 6 strokes\n\nof the cane on the accused having regard to the fact that he was the mastermind, who\n\nhatched this detestable criminal scheme to kidnap for ransom a young vulnerable schoolgirl\n\nand he had further drawn in other persons to help him carry it through. A young schoolgirl\n\nwas made to suffer the trauma of being kidnapped and blindfolded for some 60 hours.\n\nSometimes the deleterious psychological effects could be more serious and longer lasting\n\nthan the pain from physical injury. The victim’s parents and other family members\n\nmust have been put to extreme anxiety and worry, more particularly since the kidnappers\n\nhad threatened to kill the child if the ransom sum was not paid.7.    After hearing the persuasive mitigation by defence\n\ncounsel, I invited the prosecution to submit on the sentence. However, the learned DPP, Mr\n\nFrancis Tseng, informed me that he was not making any submissions.8.    Therefore, having regard to the accused’s\n\nplea of guilt, the absence of a criminal record, his full cooperation with the police\n\nduring the entire investigations, his willingness to testify for the prosecution against\n\nhis accomplices, the character references that were placed before me, and after taking\n\ninto account other significant facts that the kidnappers were not armed, the victim was\n\nnot hurt and was well looked after and released as soon as the ransom was paid, I decided\n\nto be lenient to the accused and did not impose any caning. Accordingly, I sentenced him\n\nto the minimum sentence of life imprisonment without any caning and backdated that\n\nsentence to the date of his remand. Despite this, the accused is dissatisfied with the\n\nsentence and has appealed.Dated this 4th day of May 2000.CHAN SENG ONNJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
