        "My Decision": "14.        I have taken into account the mitigation plea and the factors specifically mentioned by the prosecution.15.        I also take into account the period over which the incidents took place between August 1997 to about 21 November 2001.16.        The only reason why the accused’s Counsel submitted that he was not a habitual offender was because the accused had no previous convictions. However, he had habitually inflicted himself upon the victim over four years on various occasions at various locations (as revealed in the nine charges) when he was aware of what he was doing.17.        As regards the possible long-term effects that the accused’s actions may have on the victim, there may also be possible feelings of guilt by the victim, especially if she is blamed by her mother and the rest of the family for the accused’s incarceration. I hope that they realise that she is not to blame.18.        The accused has only himself to blame. He, and only he, must take the responsibility for his heinous actions. I do not see any reason why his sentence should be more lenient than others in similar situations.19.        On the 2ndcharge, I sentence the accused to 12 years’ imprisonment. This sentence is to run from the date of his arrest.20.        On the 8thcharge, I sentence the accused to 12 years’ imprisonment. This sentence is to run concurrently with the sentence on the 2ndcharge.21.        On the 9thcharge, I sentence the accused to 12 years’ imprisonment. This sentence is to run consecutively after the sentence in relation to the 2ndcharge.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
