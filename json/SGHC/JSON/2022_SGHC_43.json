        "Introduction": "1 In HC/OS 920/2021 (“OS 920”), the plaintiff, Hunan Xiangzhong Mining Group Limited applies, pursuant to s 10(3)(a) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”), for a declaration that the sole arbitrator, Mr Timothy Cooke (“Arbitrator”), does not have jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings in Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) Arbitration No 934 of 2020 (“Arbitration”). In a Ruling on Jurisdiction dated 12 August 2021 (“Jurisdiction Decision”), the Arbitrator ruled that he has jurisdiction over the Arbitration.1Foot Note 1×Zhao Meiqing’s affidavit dated 6 September 2021 (“Zhao’s affidavit”) at pp 17 to 36. 2 It is well established that an application made under s 10(3) of the IAA is to be reviewed by the courtde novo. In considering the matter afresh, the court will consider the arbitral tribunal’s views on its jurisdiction, as what the tribunal has said might well be persuasive. However, beyond this, the court is not bound to accept or take into account the arbitral tribunal’s findings on the matter (SanumInvestments Ltd v Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic[2016] 5 SLR 536 at [41]). 3 The central controversy in OS 920 pertains to the validity of the Arbitrator’s appointment. In essence, the plaintiff contends that the appointment of the Arbitrator was not in accordance with the parties’ agreement in the arbitration agreement contained in the underlying contract between the parties (see [7] below).2Foot Note 2×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions dated 25 November 2021 (“PWS”) at para 20.The relevant part of the arbitration agreement prescribed that “THE TRIBUNAL SHALL CONSIST OF A SINGLE ARBITRATORAGREED UPON BY BOTH PARTIES, ORIF NOT SO AGREED,BY THE CHAIRMANFOR THE TIME BEING OF SIAC” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]. Since the Arbitrator in this case was appointed bythe Presidentof the Court of Arbitration of the SIAC (“President”) and notthe Chairmanof the SIAC (“Chairman”), the plaintiff’s position is that the Arbitrator’s appointment is invalid.3Foot Note 3×PWS at paras 6 and 8.In response, the defendant submits that the appointment procedures were correctly observed and the Arbitrator was properly appointed under the SIAC Rules (6th edition, 1 August 2016) (“SIAC Rules 2016”).4Foot Note 4×Defendant’s Written Submissions dated 25 November 2021 (“DWS”) at paras 52 to 53.In any case, the plaintiff’s application should fail because it was made to the Arbitrator out of time.5Foot Note 5×DWS at para 51. 4 At the outset, I note that the parties do not dispute that the institutional authority responsible for the appointment of arbitrators for arbitrations conducted under the SIAC’s arbitration rules has changed over time. Before April 2013, the appointment of arbitrators was made by the Chairman. For example, r 6.3 of the SIAC Rules (4th edition, 1 July 2010) stated that “In all cases, the arbitrators nominated by the parties, or by any third person including the arbitrators already appointed, shall be subject to appointment by the Chairman in his discretion”. Following an internal reorganisation within the SIAC which,inter alia, created the office of the President, in r 6.3 of the SIAC Rules (5th edition, 1 April 2013) (“SIAC Rules 2013”), the reference to Chairman was amended to the President. Rules 1.3 and 1.4 of the SIAC Rules 2013 also expressly amended the previous editions of the SIAC Rules to state that “Chairman” would from 1 April 2013 onwards mean “President”. 5 In this judgment, I address the effect of these retrospective amendments and the proper construction of arbitration agreements that may have been drafted on the basis of the previous editions of the SIAC Rules. I begin with the factual background pertinent to the present case.",
        "Factual background": "6 The plaintiff in OS 920 is a company incorporated in the People’s Republic of China and was the respondent in the Arbitration.6Foot Note 6×Zhao’s affidavit at para 6.The defendant is a company incorporated in Singapore and was the claimant in the Arbitration.7Foot Note 7×Zhao’s affidavit at para 7. 7 The parties’ dispute in the Arbitration arose out of a contract dated 18 May 2020 for the sale and purchase of a cargo of 280,000 barrels of light cycle oil plus/minus 10% at the defendant’s option (“Contract”).8Foot Note 8×Zhao’s affidavit at para 8; Mangkaiyarkarasi d/o Panneer Selvam’s affidavit dated 14 October 2021 (“MPS’ affidavit”) at para 6.Clause 16 of the Contract contained the relevant arbitration agreement (“Arbitration Agreement”) and stated as follows: 16) LAW & ARBITRATION THE CONTRACT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SINGAPORE LAW, NOT INCLUDING ANY CONFLICT OF LAWS OR RULES. ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY QUESTION REGARDING ITS EXISTENCE, VALIDITY OR TERMINATION SHALL BE REFERRED TO AND FINALLY RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION IN SINGAPORE TO THE EXCLUSION OF ANY OTHER FORUM OR JURISDICTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARBITRATION RULES OF THE SINGAPORE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION CENTRE (SIAC RULES) FOR THE TIME BEING IN FORCE WHICH RULES ARE DEEMED TO BE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS CLAUSE. THE TRIBUNAL SHALL CONSIST OF A SINGLE ARBITRATOR AGREED UPON BY BOTH PARTIES, OR IF NOT SO AGREED, BY THE CHAIRMAN FOR THE TIME BEING OF SIAC. THE PLACE OF THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE SINGAPORE. THE LANGUAGE OF THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE ENGLISH. THE REASONED ARBITRATION AWARD SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING UPON BOTH PARTIES WITHOUT RECOURSE TO ANY COURTS. ANY COSTS RELATED TO ARBITRATION, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY’S FEES, SHALL BE BORNE BY THE LOSING PARTY. THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS AND THE SALE OF GOODS ACT SHALL NOT APPLY TO THIS CONTRACT[.] 8 The defendant commenced the Arbitration on 14 September 2020.9Foot Note 9×Zhao’s affidavit at para 10; MPS’ affidavit at para 8.In its Notice of Arbitration, the defendant proposed the appointment of a sole arbitrator and sought the plaintiff’s agreement. It also proposed for the Arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the expedited procedure under r 5 of the SIAC Rules 2016.10Foot Note 10×Zhao’s affidavit at pp 62 to 63; MPS’ affidavit at para 9.It should be noted that the defendant stated in the Notice of Arbitration that “In accordance with the Arbitration Agreement, it has been agreed as follows: - … (b) The Tribunal shall consist of a single arbitrator agreed upon by both parties, or if not so agreed,appointedby the Chairman of the SIAC” [emphasis added].11Foot Note 11×Zhao’s affidavit at p 57 (para 10).I will deal with the significance of this statement below. 9 The plaintiff neither responded to the Notice of Arbitration nor provided any comments on the constitution of the tribunal or whether the expedited procedure should apply. On 26 October 2020, the defendant wrote to the SIAC stating that more than 21 days had passed since the date of commencement of the Arbitration and parties have not reached an agreement on the nomination of the sole arbitrator. The defendant requested that the President proceed to appoint the sole arbitrator and determine the expedited procedure application.12Foot Note 12×Zhao’s affidavit at p 21 (para 13). 10 On 27 October 2020, the SIAC responded and requested that the plaintiff provide its comments on the expedited procedure application, failing which, the application would be placed before the President for determination. Again, there was no response from the plaintiff. The defendant thereafter repeated its request for the President to determine the expedited procedure and the appointment of the sole arbitrator on 3 November 2020. On 4 November 2020, the SIAC confirmed that the expedited procedure application would be placed before the President for determination.13Foot Note 13×Zhao’s affidavit at p 21 (paras 14 to 16). 11 After inviting comments from the parties on 23 November 2020 regarding the appointment of the sole arbitrator and receiving no response from the plaintiff, the SIAC announced on 14 December 2020 that it had requested the President to make the appointment. The President appointed the Arbitrator in accordance with r 10.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016 on 29 December 2020.14Foot Note 14×Zhao’s affidavit at p 21 (paras 17 to 19). 12 The Arbitrator held a preliminary meeting on 11 January 2021 and directed that the defendant arrange for all relevant correspondence, notices, procedural orders, directions and documents to be served on the plaintiff. The defendant (as claimant in the Arbitration) proceeded to file its memorial on 25 February 2021. Despite being ordered to do so by 5 April and then 12 April 2021, the plaintiff did not file any memorial and did not communicate with the defendant, the Arbitrator or the SIAC. The Arbitrator also invited the plaintiff to confirm its availability to attend a procedural conference call on 14 April 2021 but there was again no response. At the procedural conference call, the Arbitrator directed that an evidential hearing take place remotely on 17 May 2021 at 10.00am. He directed that the order be served on the plaintiff by courier and by local lawyers at the plaintiff’s two known addresses.15Foot Note 15×Zhao’s affidavit at p 22 (paras 22 to 26). 13 The evidential hearing subsequently took place on 17 May 2021, and the plaintiff did not attend the hearing. The defendant submitted a memorandum of service recording that all relevant correspondence, notices, procedural orders, directions, submissions and documents were couriered and/or personally served on the plaintiff. The Arbitrator was satisfied that the plaintiff was aware of the evidential hearing and had been provided with the necessary details to participate remotely. At the end of the hearing, the Arbitrator directed that the defendant file any further written submissions including those on costs by 31 May 2021 and the plaintiff to file any written submissions it wished to make by 14 June 2021.16Foot Note 16×Zhao’s affidavit at pp 22 to 23 (paras 26 to 29). 14 The plaintiff only appointed counsel on 25 May 2021. The defendant, the SIAC and the Arbitrator were informed of this in an email from the plaintiff’s solicitors, Wee Swee Teow LLP, on 27 May 2021.17Foot Note 17×Zhao’s affidavit at pp 23 (para 30) and 132.The Arbitrator responded the same day remarking that he understood that the plaintiff “has been provided with copies of documents relating to [the Arbitration] from the outset” and stated that since the Arbitration was being conducted under the expedited procedure, the final award was to be rendered within six months of the constitution of the tribunal. He also stated that the evidential hearing had taken place and a final award was due by 1 July 2021. In the circumstances, the Arbitrator requested that the plaintiff clarify why it had waited so long before instructing counsel in the Arbitration and what steps it intended to take given that it had apparently chosen not to participate until 27 May 2021.18Foot Note 18×Zhao’s affidavit at p 23 (para 30). 15 The plaintiff, through its solicitors, responded substantively on 31 May 2021 asserting that the Arbitrator had not been appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement and protested the continuation of the Arbitration. The plaintiff made certain proposals for the future conduct of the proceedings but did not address the Arbitrator’s query as to why it had not participated in the Arbitration thus far.19Foot Note 19×Zhao’s affidavit at p 23 (para 31). 16 On 1 June 2021, the Arbitrator wrote to the secretariat of the SIAC, copying the parties, seeking an explanation of the steps that had been taken in relation to his appointment. On 3 June 2021, the SIAC responded in the following terms: When making the appointment, we noted that the arbitration clause provides ‘The Tribunal shall consist of a single arbitrator agreed upon by both parties, or if not so agreed, by the Chairman for the time being of SIAC’. The Chairman was unable to make the appointment. We also noted that the President of the SIAC Court of Arbitration (‘President’) has decided that the proceedings be conducted under the expedited procedure. We proceeded to request the President to appoint the sole arbitrator pursuant to Rule 10.2 of the SIAC Rules and let the Parties know that the President would make the appointment (as stated in our email to the Parties dated 14 December 2020). 17 On 8 June 2021, the defendant sought certain clarifications from the SIAC regarding the appointment process and the SIAC responded on 23 June 2021 as follows: Please be informed that although the Chairman is unable to appoint an arbitrator under the SIAC Rules 2016, the practice under SIAC Rules 9.2 and 10.2 is to allow the Chairman to nominate an arbitrator for appointment by the President, provided the Chairman is not conflicted. Here, because the Chairman had reported a conflict, no request was made to the Chairman to appoint the sole arbitrator.",
        "The jurisdictional challenge and the Jurisdiction Decision": "18 On 23 June 2021, the plaintiff wrote to the Arbitrator and the defendant stating that it intended to make a jurisdictional challenge under r 28 of the SIAC Rules 2016 read with Art 16 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“Model Law”), and the application was made on 28 June 2021.20Foot Note 20×Zhao’s affidavit at pp 164 to 167 (paras 7 to 9).The plaintiff objected to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator on the basis that his appointment was not in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement. It also sought a declaration that the application was made within time.21Foot Note 21×Zhao’s affidavit at p 24 (para 38).Written submissions were filed by the parties and an oral hearing of the application took place at the plaintiff’s request on 26 July 2021.22Foot Note 22×Zhao’s affidavit at p 24 (para 35). 19 The parties agreed that the Arbitrator had jurisdiction to determine the plaintiff’s jurisdictional challenge and that the application should be determined as a preliminary issue.23Foot Note 23×Zhao’s affidavit at p 24 (paras 36 to 37).The parties also agreed that the Arbitration was governed by the SIAC Rules 2016.24Foot Note 24×Zhao’s affidavit at p 27 (para 59.1). 20 In the Jurisdiction Decision, the Arbitrator dismissed the plaintiff’s application and ruled that he had jurisdiction to determine the dispute between the parties.25Foot Note 25×Zhao’s affidavit at p 19 (para 2).The Arbitrator considered that the plaintiff’s application was premised on arguments that the President did not have power to appoint the Arbitrator and this power properly vested in the Chairman for two reasons. Firstly, the reference to the Chairman in the Arbitration Agreement is to be construed as an agreement by the parties to have the Chairman appoint the Arbitrator and this was intended to displace anything to the contrary in the rules of arbitration incorporated (ie,rr 9.2, 9.3 and 10 of the SIAC Rules 2016). The plaintiff’s position was that the Arbitration Agreement incorporated the appointment provisions of earlier editions of the SIAC Rules where the Chairman did in fact have the power to appoint the arbitrator. Secondly, if the language used in the Arbitration Agreement did not displace rr 9.2, 9.3 and 10 of the SIAC Rules 2016, then the language of the Arbitration Agreement is inconsistent with those rules and the parties’ express language should prevail over the conflicting provisions of the SIAC Rules 2016. The Arbitrator considered that both of these were questions of construction of the Arbitration Agreement. It was the plaintiff’s case that the President was not permitted to appoint the sole arbitrator as the parties had agreed for the Chairman to do so. Therefore, the Arbitrator’s appointment by the President cannot stand.26Foot Note 26×Zhao’s affidavit at pp 26 to 27 (paras 55 to 57). 21 As regards the construction of the Arbitration Agreement, the Arbitrator disagreed that the parties objectively intended for the Chairman to appoint the Arbitrator or to derogate from the appointment provisions in the SIAC Rules 2016.27Foot Note 27×Zhao’s affidavit at p 32 (para 79).He gave the following reasons in support of his decision: (a) The Arbitration Agreement provides that a sole arbitrator is to be “agreed” by the parties. It does not provide that the parties or the Chairman are to “nominate” or “appoint” the Arbitrator. This suggests that parties did not draw a distinction between a situation where parties “agreed” an arbitrator (be that by a nomination or an appointment) or when the Chairman chose one. In the context of rr 9.2 and 9.3 SIAC Rules 2016 which provide that where parties have agreed to appoint an arbitrator (or have agreed for a third party to appoint one), such agreement isdeemedto be an agreement tonominate.28Foot Note 28×Zhao’s affidavit at pp 28 to 30 (paras 61, 63 and 68). (b) The parties did not agree that the Chairman was to play a special role in the constitution of the tribunal that would displace the provisions in the SIAC Rules 2016. If parties intended for the Chairman to “appoint” (rather than “nominate”) the sole arbitrator, notwithstanding that the SIAC Rules 2016 incorporated at the time of commencement of proceedings may provide otherwise, they would have stated so explicitly. Mere reference to the Chairman is not sufficient.29Foot Note 29×Zhao’s affidavit at p 29 (para 63). (c) The Arbitrator noted that whilst the earlier editions of the SIAC Rules in 2007 and 2009 provided for the Chairman to make appointments, those earlier rules had been amended in the SIAC Rules 2013 to provide for the President to make appointments (see also [4] above). Thus, any reference to Chairman in the older editions of the SIAC Rules is deemed to be a reference to the President. The effect of this is that the appointment provisions of the SIAC Rules, regardless of whether the 2007, 2010 or 2013 edition was incorporated, provide for the President to appoint or confirm any nomination of a sole arbitrator by the parties or a third party. The parties cannot have intended to have incorporated an appointment mechanism from an earlier edition of the SIAC Rules in its unamended form without having set this out expressly. Therefore, the parties’ mere reference to the Chairman in the Arbitration Agreement is simply a reference to a third party to nominate the sole arbitrator.30Foot Note 30×Zhao’s affidavit at p 29 (para 64). (d) The parties expressly provided that the SIAC Rules “currently in force” were deemed incorporated into the Arbitration Agreement. This indicates that the parties intended for the most up-to-date rules to apply when proceedings were commenced. They did not specifically carve out from that express incorporation some historical (and since amended) provisions relating to the appointment of the tribunal.31Foot Note 31×Zhao’s affidavit at p 29 (para 65). (e) The Arbitrator rejected the plaintiff’s argument that the Arbitration Agreement displaces r 10.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016. The Arbitration Agreement does not state as such. Rule 10 is also not prefaced by words such as “unless the parties have agreed otherwise”. Thus, the Arbitration Agreement is to be read with rather than in contrast to r 10. Rule 10.1 provides that parties may seek to agree to have a person serve as sole arbitrator and where such an agreement is reached, it is subject to appointment by the President pursuant to r 9.3. The parties’ provision that they would agree upon the sole arbitrator was consistent with r 10.1. The part that read “or if not so agreed, by the Chairman for the time being of SIAC” when read with r 9.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016 clearly means that if parties could not agree on a nomination, it was for the Chairman to nominate. Pursuant to r 9.3, any such nomination would be subject to appointment by the President. Clear unambiguous wording would have been required to displace the provisions of rr 9.2 and 9.3 of the SIAC Rules 2016 which the parties incorporated into the Arbitration Agreement. This was not present.32Foot Note 32×Zhao’s affidavit at pp 30 to 31 (paras 69 to 71). (f) Rule 10 of the SIAC Rules 2016 applies where the parties have agreed to nominate a sole arbitrator and/or where they have agreed that a third party is to nominate an arbitrator. Rule 10.2 concerns two circumstances where the President is to appoint a sole arbitrator, namely: (a) where the parties have not reached agreement on the nomination of a sole arbitrator within 21 days (or such other period as may be agreed by the parties or set by the Registrar); or (b) if at any time either party makes such a request. The first situation would also apply where a party does not participate in the proceedings at all. The Arbitrator considered that this provision “caters for the situation where the parties’ agreed procedure for appointing a sole arbitrator has failed, either because the parties have not been able to agree a nomination, or where a third party nominator has not made a nomination”. Rule 10.2 therefore empowers the President to make the appointment so that the arbitral process is not stymied. It has a similar effect to Art 11(4) of the Model Law which allows a party to request a statutory appointing authority to make an appointment where the parties’ chosen process has failed.33Foot Note 33×Zhao’s affidavit at pp 31 to 32 (paras 73 to 77). (g) The parties did not state that they intended to supplant the right to request the President to appoint a sole arbitrator at any time under r 10.2 with the right for the Chairman to “appoint” or “nominate” one (which nomination would have been subject to appointment by the President). As a matter of construction, this was not the parties’ objective intention. Instead, the parties agreed on a mechanism for nomination in the Arbitration Agreement and at the same time incorporated r 10.2. By doing so, the parties intended for these provisions to be read together and provided for a fall-back mechanism to ensure the timely appointment of the tribunal in the event their own intended mechanism failed.34Foot Note 34×Zhao’s affidavit at p 32 (para 78). 22 The Arbitrator found that the nomination process undertaken by the SIAC was entirely proper and in accordance with the parties’ agreement.35Foot Note 35×Zhao’s affidavit at p 33 (para 87).The plaintiff did not respond to the defendant’s proposal for the nomination of a sole arbitrator in the Notice of Arbitration.36Foot Note 36×Zhao’s affidavit at p 32 (para 81).Thereafter, the defendant wrote to the SIAC on three occasions requesting the President to appoint a sole arbitrator because 21 days had passed and parties had not agreed on the nomination of an arbitrator.37Foot Note 37×Zhao’s affidavit at pp 32 to 33 (paras 82 to 84).Upon determining that the Chairman had a conflict, the SIAC did not approach him for a nomination.38Foot Note 38×Zhao’s affidavit at p 33 (para 85).By 14 December 2020, the SIAC approached the President for an appointment.39Foot Note 39×Zhao’s affidavit at p 33 (para 86).The SIAC had been requested by the defendant to appoint the sole arbitrator. Further, since 21 days had passed without a nomination from the parties, the President was empowered by r 10.2 to make the appointment in any event.40Foot Note 40×Zhao’s affidavit at pp 33 to 34 (para 87).The Arbitrator saw no need for the SIAC to have informed the parties of the Chairman’s inability to make a nomination since all that would have happened was that the defendant would presumably have reiterated its request for the President to appoint and the plaintiff would likely have made no comment since it chose not to participate in the proceedings.41Foot Note 41×Zhao’s affidavit at p 34 (para 88).Thus, the Arbitrator found that he had jurisdiction over the Arbitration.42Foot Note 42×Zhao’s affidavit at p 34 (para 89). 23 The Arbitrator also found that the plaintiff’s jurisdictional objection was out of time. The plaintiff did not participate in the Arbitration proceedings until 27 May 2021 and provided no explanation as to why it failed to respond to the Notice of Arbitration. It also did not provide any comments on the nomination of a sole arbitrator or respond to any of the correspondence between the defendant and the SIAC prior to the appointment of the Arbitrator. Since there was no suggestion that the Arbitration was not brought to the plaintiff’s attention or that it was somehow unable to appear, it appeared that it chose not to participate until the last moment in the Arbitration.43Foot Note 43×Zhao’s affidavit at pp 34 to 35 (paras 90 to 92). 24 The Arbitrator rejected the plaintiff’s argument that since it has not served a statement of defence, it was not out of time in filing the jurisdictional objection. By Procedural Order No 1 dated 18 January 2021 (“PO No 1”), the Arbitrator directed the plaintiff to file its memorial, including its statement of defence, witness evidence and documents by 5 April 2021 (and subsequently granted a short extension to 12 April 2021). The Arbitrator did not consider r 28.3 of the SIAC Rules 2016 to permit a respondent not to file a statement of defence at all and then seek to contest jurisdiction months later. The purpose of the rule was to ensure that where a respondent participates in the proceedings, it must file a jurisdictional objection by the time it responds substantively to the claim brought against it. Where it fails to file a statement of defence at all and provides no explanation for not doing so, the position it is adopting is that it chose not to file a statement of defence. The Arbitrator considered that to also be a choice not to file a jurisdictional objection pursuant to the SIAC Rules 2016. There is no injustice in requiring a respondent to file a jurisdictional objection within a specific time frame. If there is a justifiable delay explaining why the respondent may not have filed such an objection in time, the tribunal is empowered under r 28.3 to admit the objection outside the stipulated time. In the absence of any justification at all by the plaintiff, the Arbitrator held that its jurisdictional objection was out of time.44Foot Note 44×Zhao’s affidavit at p 35 (paras 93 to 97).",
        "The parties’ cases": "25 As detailed above at [3], the plaintiff’s case is that the appointment of the Arbitrator was not in accordance with the parties’ agreement in the Arbitration Agreement.45Foot Note 45×PWS at para 20. 26 Firstly, the plaintiff relies on the importance of party autonomy in arguing that the Arbitration Agreement’s reference to “Chairman” must be strictly upheld. A ruling that a reference to “Chairman” could allow an appointment to be made by the “President” instead would lead to difficulties in enforcement of the award in foreign jurisdictions.46Foot Note 46×PWS at para 25; Notes of Arguments (2 December 2021) (“NOA”) at pp 3 (lines 9 to 11) and 8 (lines 12 to 13). 27 Secondly, the plaintiff argues that the parties agreed that the Chairman was to nominate and appoint an arbitrator for the arbitration proceedings.47Foot Note 47×PWS at paras 29 to 32.Under r 10.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016, there should be no split between appointment and nomination, unless parties expressly and unequivocally provided in their agreement for such a split.48Foot Note 48×PWS at para 33.Further, the defendant had stated in its own Notice of Arbitration that the Chairman was to appoint the sole arbitrator and this is confirmation of parties’ objective intentions.49Foot Note 49×NOA at p 3 (lines 21 to 32).The plaintiff contends that the Chairman still has institutional powers of appointment and thus, conceptually it was akin to parties agreeing to apply an earlier edition of the SIAC Rules. While the plaintiff does not contend that an earlier edition of SIAC Rules was incorporated, it is not necessary to decide which edition of the SIAC Rules would be applicable because in this case, the parties used the word “Chairman” in the arbitration agreement and effect should be given to that choice.50Foot Note 50×NOA at p 8 (lines 24 to 32).Thus, the Arbitrator erred in finding that the parties intended for the Chairman to nominate but not appoint the Arbitrator. 28 Thirdly, even if parties had agreed that the Chairman was to nominate but not appoint the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator’s appointment was still improper because the Chairman did not nominate the Arbitrator in this case. Instead, it was the President who nominated the Arbitrator. Since the Arbitrator’s appointment was not in accordance with the agreed nomination steps and parties’ agreement, it is defective.51Foot Note 51×PWS at paras 35 to 37.In the Jurisdiction Decision, the Arbitrator erred in not considering whether his nomination had been duly carried out despite his finding that “parties agreed [on] a mechanism for nomination in the Arbitration Agreement”.52Foot Note 52×PWS at para 38.The plaintiff also argues that since the Chairman was unable to perform a function that the parties had stipulated for, it was incumbent on the SIAC to inform the parties contemporaneously and offer suggestions on what else could be done, and to act on such decisions that the parties may have agreed on subsequently. The SIAC did not do so and has not provided any reason for not doing so.53Foot Note 53×PWS at paras 42 to 45; NOA at p 4 (lines 5 to 15). 29 The parties did not intend for r 10.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016 to apply at all or be a “fallback” because they specifically referred to “Chairman” in the Arbitration Agreement. There is no authority that r 10.2 is a fallback provision. Even if it acts as a fallback, the Chairman still has to at least nominate the sole arbitrator but that was not done in this case. The Arbitrator thus erred in finding that r 10.2 was a fallback provision and that it applied.54Foot Note 54×PWS at paras 49 to 51; NOA at p 4 (lines 22 to 32). 30 Finally, the plaintiff argues that its jurisdictional challenge was made within time because no statement of defence had been filed.55Foot Note 55×PWS at paras 52 to 56.Alternatively, procedural rules should not be allowed to defeat substantive justice and are in any case subject to the rules of natural justice. Thus, even if its jurisdictional objection was out of time, its objection should still be heard and considered in full regardless of the absence of any reason for the delay.56Foot Note 56×PWS at para 57; NOA at p 2 (lines 17 to 19). 31 In response, the defendant’s case is that the appointment of the Arbitrator under r 10.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016 is in accordance with parties’ agreement.57Foot Note 57×DWS at para 16.The Arbitration Agreement, properly construed, provides for the following methods of appointing the sole arbitrator: (a) nomination by the parties and appointment by the President; (b) nomination by the Chairman and appointment by the President; and (c) appointment by the President in accordance with r 10.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016.58Foot Note 58×DWS at para 19. 32 The defendant also argues that the Arbitration Agreement provides that, if the parties are unable to agree, the Chairman may nominate an arbitrator who will then be appointed by the President. The words “appoint” and “nominate” do not appear in the Arbitration Agreement.59Foot Note 59×DWS at para 28.Rule 9.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016 clearly states that any agreement for a party or a third person to appoint an arbitrator will be deemed an agreement to nominate an arbitrator.60Foot Note 60×DWS at para 20.1.The Chairman is one such third person.61Foot Note 61×DWS at para 38.2.Since the Arbitration Agreement provides that parties were to agree upon a sole arbitrator and in effect nominate the arbitrator who would then be appointed by the President in accordance with r 9.3 of the SIAC Rules 2016, the alternative regarding a third person should be read in the same way such that the Chairman may nominate an arbitrator who will then be appointed by the President.62Foot Note 62×DWS at paras 30 to 31. 33 There is no basis to assert that the Arbitrator canonlybe properly appointed if he is appointed by either the parties or the Chairman.63Foot Note 63×DWS at para 20.1.Rule 10.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016, which was incorporated by reference in the Arbitration Agreement, applies in the present case. It provides a further mechanism for the appointment of the arbitrator by allowing the President to appoint the sole arbitrator.64Foot Note 64×DWS at paras 32 to 37. 34 Further, there is no basis to assert that the Chairman still retains institutional powers of appointment.65Foot Note 65×DWS at para 20.2; NOA at pp 5 (lines 29 to 32) to 6 (lines 1 to 8).The fact that the Chairman once held powers of confirmation under older editions of the SIAC Rules does not mean that the Chairman currently holds any such powers, or that by mere reference to the Chairman, parties intended to replace the relevant provisions of the SIAC Rules 2016 with particular provisions from previous editions of the SIAC Rules.66Foot Note 66×DWS at paras 20.2 and 38.3.The defendant also highlighted that the SIAC Rules 2013 amended all prior editions of the SIAC Rules such that Chairman would, from 1 April 2013 onwards, refer to the President.67Foot Note 67×DWS at para 40. 35 Finally, the defendant submits that the plaintiff’s jurisdictional challenge was out of time. The plaintiff failed to file its statement of defence and memorial by the deadline specified by the Arbitrator in PO No 1 (ie, 5 April 2021 and subsequently extended to 12 April 2021) and did not participate in the proceedings until 27 May 2021. Considering that the plaintiff had full notice of the Arbitration and all directions and timelines made therein, it cannot choose not to file its memorial, allow proceedings to continue and then raise a jurisdictional objection at the eleventh hour after the evidential hearing had been completed.68Foot Note 68×DWS at paras 44 to 51.If the plaintiff’s submissions are to be accepted, it would make a mockery of the Arbitrator’s directions on the filing of pleadings.69Foot Note 69×NOA at p 5 (lines 8 to 10).",

Similarly, the defendant’s arguments to the contrary have also already been summarised above at [32]–[34].",
        "Analysis and decision": "65 The guiding principles as regards the construction of an arbitration agreement have been explained by the Court of Appeal inInsigmaTechnology Co Ltd v Alstom Technology Ltd[2009] 3 SLR(R) 936 (at [30]–[34]) as follows: 30 Our first observation is that an arbitration agreement (such as the Arbitration Agreement) should be construed like any other form of commercial agreement (see Julian D M Lew QC, Loukas A Mistelis & Stefan M Kröll,Comparative International Commercial Arbitration(Kluwer Law International, 2003) at para 7-60). The fundamental principle of documentary interpretation is to give effect to the intention of the parties as expressed in the document. 31  Our second observation is that, where the parties have evinced a clear intention to settle any dispute by arbitration, the court should give effect to such intention, even if certain aspects of the agreement may be ambiguous, inconsistent, incomplete or lacking in certain particulars (seeHalsbury’s Laws of Singapore,vol 2 (LexisNexis, 2003 Reissue, 2003) at para 20.017) so long as the arbitration can be carried out without prejudice to the rights of either party and so long as giving effect to such intention does not result in an arbitration that is not within the contemplation of either party. This approach is similar to the ‘principle of effective interpretation’ in international arbitration law, which was described inFouchard, Gaillard, Goldman on International Commercial Arbitration(Kluwer Law International, 1999) (Emmanuel Gaillard & John Savage eds) (‘Fouchard’) at p 258 as follows: B. – THE PRINCIPLE OF EFFECTIVE INTERPRETATION 478. — The second principle of interpretation of arbitration agreements is the principle of effective interpretation. This principle is inspired by provisions such as Article 1157 of the French Civil Code, according to which ‘where a clause can be interpreted in two different ways, the interpretation enabling the clause to be effective should be adopted in preference to that which prevents the clause from being effective.’ This common-sense rule whereby, if in doubt, one should ‘prefer the interpretation which gives meaning to the words, rather than that which renders them useless or nonsensical,’ is widely accepted not only by the courts but also by arbitrators who readily acknowledge it to be a ‘universally recognized rule of interpretation.’ To give just one example of the application of this principle, an arbitral tribunal interpreting a pathological clause held that: when inserting an arbitration clause in their contract the intention of the parties must be presumed to have been willing to establish an effective machinery for the settlement of disputes covered by the arbitration clause. 32 A subsidiary principle to the principle of effective interpretation is the principle that an arbitration agreement should also not be interpreted restrictively or strictly. An arbitration agreement is not a statute. This was noted inFouchardat pp 260–261: D. – REJECTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF STRICT INTERPRETATION … [T]his principle [that an arbitration agreement should be interpreted ‘restrictively’] is generally rejected in international arbitration. It is based on the idea that an arbitration agreement constitutes an exception to the principle of the jurisdiction of the courts, and that, as laws of exception are strictly interpreted, the same should apply to arbitration agreements. … This has been frequently confirmed in arbitral case law. For example, the Decision on Jurisdiction rendered in theAmcoarbitration sets out the principle in general terms: like any other convention, a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed restrictively, nor, as a matter of fact, broadly or liberally. It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties: such a method of interpretation is but the application of the fundamental principlepacta suntservanda, a principle common, indeed, to all systems of internal law and to international law. The interpretation of arbitration agreements by the French courts has, likewise, never been strict nor restrictive. 33 Another subsidiary principle is that, as far as possible, a commercially logical and sensible construction is to be preferred over another that is commercially illogical (seeLaw Debenture Trust Corporation Plc vElektrim Finance BV[2005] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 755 at [39]). In the present case, the Judge applied this principle at [33]–[34] of the Judgment: In the absence of an administering authority, the adoption of the ICC Rules is likely to be construed as designating the ICC to be the institution conducting the arbitration. Further the selection of a particular institutional arbitral body to conduct the arbitration will be construed as also selecting the rules of that body to govern the procedure adopted in the arbitration. [David Joseph QC,Jurisdiction and Arbitration Agreements and their Enforcement(Sweet & Maxwell, 2005)] states at para 4.27: In many cases parties will expressly agree to submit disputes to a particular institutional arbitral body. … An agreement to refer disputes to such a body will be deemed to incorporate an agreement to abide by the rules and procedures of that body in force at the time arbitration is commenced. Not only will the arbitration be governed by that institution’s rules but it will also be administered by that organisation. The present case, however, despite the nomination of the SIAC as the body to conduct the arbitration, is not an example of institutional arbitration by the SIAC, since the arbitration agreement specifically designated the use of [the] ICC Rules instead. …By designating a separate administering authority, the parties indicated that the adoption of the ICC Rules was not a selection of the administering authority but only an agreement for the arbitration to take place by reference to those rules. 34 This approach to the interpretation of an arbitration agreement is necessary to uphold the underlying and fundamental principle of party autonomy as far as possible in the selection of the kind of arbitration and the terms of the arbitration. Given the inherently private and consensual nature of arbitration, our courts will ordinarily respect the principle of party autonomy and give effect to (workable) agreed arbitration arrangements in international arbitration, subject only to any public policy considerations to the contrary. [emphasis in original in italics] 66 These “guiding principles of primary importance” were summarised by Vinodh Coomaraswamy J inBNA v BNB and another[2019] SGHC 142 (at [22]–[26]) as follows: (a) Firstly, the principles for construing an arbitration agreement are assimilated with those applicable for construing any other commercial agreement. The fundamental objective of construing a commercial agreement is to give effect to the parties’ intention as they have manifested it objectively in that agreement. So too, the fundamental purpose of construing an arbitration agreement is to give effect to the parties’ intention as they have manifested it objectively in their arbitration agreement. (b) Secondly, the court should, as far as possible, construe an arbitration agreement so as to give effect to a clear intention evinced by the parties to settle their disputes by arbitration. This gives rise to two subsidiary principles: first, that the courts should not construe an arbitration agreement restrictively or strictly and second, the courts should prefer a commercially logical and sensible construction over one which is commercially illogical. (c) Thirdly, a defect in an arbitration agreement does not render it voidab initiounless the defect is so fundamental or irretrievable as to negate the parties’ intent or agreement to arbitrate. 67 Having regard to these principles, I find that the Arbitrator wascorrectin finding that he had jurisdiction over the Arbitration and his appointment was in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement. 68 To recapitulate, the relevant sentence in the Arbitration Agreement states that “THE TRIBUNAL SHALL CONSIST OF A SINGLE ARBITRATORAGREED UPONBYBOTH PARTIES, ORIF NOT SO AGREED, BY THE CHAIRMANFOR THE TIME BEING OF SIAC” [emphasis added in bold italics]. The crux of the plaintiff’s case is that the Arbitration Agreement requires the sole (or single) arbitrator to beappointedby the Chairman, or alternatively to be at leastnominatedby the Chairman and since neither of these steps were undertaken, the Arbitrator’s appointment by the President of the SIAC was invalid. 69 In my judgment, the plaintiff’s argument that the sole arbitrator is to beappointedby the Chairman is incorrect and misconceived. The parties used the words “agreed upon by” in the Arbitration Agreement instead of the terms “nominate” or “appoint”. Thus, they did not appear to have distinguished between the concepts of nomination or appointment in the Arbitration Agreement. However, since parties expressly incorporated the SIAC Rules 2016 by reference in the Arbitration Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement must be construed with the SIAC Rules 2016 in mind as context. Rules 9.2 and 9.3 of the SIAC Rules 2016 in turn state as follows: 9.2 If the parties haveagreed that any arbitrator is to beappointedby one or more of the parties, or by a third personincluding by the arbitrators already appointed, that agreementshall bedeemedanagreement to nominatean arbitrator under these Rules. 9.3In all cases, the arbitrators nominated by the parties, or by any third person including by the arbitrators already appointed, shall besubject to appointment by the President in his discretion. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 70 The phrase “in all cases” in r 9.3 of the SIAC Rules 2016 indicates thatallappointments of the arbitratorsshall bemade bythe Presidentin his discretion. The effect of r 9.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016 is that even if the Arbitration Agreement had explicitly stated that parties were to appoint an arbitrator, this would bedeemedas only amounting to an agreement to nominate an arbitrator. In my view, this puts paid to Mr Lee’s contention that because the parties used the word “Chairman”, this necessarily means that the Chairman is toappointthe sole arbitrator. Reading the Arbitration Agreement harmoniously with rr 9.2 and 9.3 of the SIAC Rules 2016, the parties are deemed to have intended to agree to nominate a sole arbitrator, or alternatively, to have the Chairman nominate the sole arbitrator. I see no reason not to consider the Chairman to be a “third person” that parties have agreed may nominate the sole arbitrator within the meaning of r 9.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016. 71 I also reject the plaintiff’s argument that the Chairman has or retains any institutional powers of appointment or that the sentence in question in the Arbitration Agreement is conceptually akin to parties agreeing to apply an earlier edition of the SIAC Rules. As explained at [4] above, the Chairman possessed institutional powers to appoint a sole arbitrator before April 2013. However, in r 6.3 of the SIAC Rules 2013, the reference to Chairman was amended to the President. Additionally, rr 1.3 and 1.4 of the SIAC Rules 2013 expressly amended the previous editions of the SIAC Rules to state that “Chairman” would from 1 April 2013 onwards mean “President”. Therefore, at the time when parties chose to incorporate the SIAC Rules 2016 by reference into the Arbitration Agreement (ie, on 18 May 2020 when the Contract was concluded) (see [7] above), they must be taken to have known that the Chairman no longer had or retained any institutional powers to appoint an arbitrator. On the contrary, it was only the President under r 9.3 of the SIAC Rules 2016 who was conferred that power, upon nomination by the parties or a third person. Thus, the Arbitrator was, in my view, undoubtedly correct in noting that “if the parties intended for the Chairman to‘appoint’(rather than‘nominate’) the sole arbitrator, notwithstanding that the SIAC Rules incorporated at the time of commencement of proceedings may provide otherwise, they would have stated so explicitly; mere reference to the Chairman is not sufficient”.75Foot Note 75×Zhao’s affidavit at p 29 (para 63).Similarly, I cannot see how it would be conceptually sound to come to the conclusion that the parties wanted an earlier edition of the SIAC Rules to apply simply by using the word Chairman in the Arbitration Agreement. 72 Mr Lee conceded that if the Arbitration Agreement refers to a party with no institutional appointment function or power, the Arbitration Agreement would be interpreted to mean that party was tonominatethe sole arbitrator. During the hearing before me, Mr Lee raised an example where, if instead of Chairman, the Arbitration Agreement had referred to the Chief Justice, then the Arbitration Agreement would be read to mean that the Chief Justice was to nominate the sole arbitrator because the Chief Justice did not have any powers of appointment.76Foot Note 76×PWS at para 58.Following on from Mr Lee’s example, it would therefore follow that a similar analysis must naturally also apply to the parties since the parties do not have any institutional authority to appoint an arbitrator. As noted in John Choong, Mark Mangan,et al,A Guide to the SIAC Arbitration Rules(Oxford University Press, 2nd edition, 2018) (“A Guide to the SIAC Rules”) at para 8.12, “Parties cannot ‘appoint’ arbitrators directly to a tribunal, even if they purport to do so in their agreement. The parties have the right to ‘nominate’ a candidate and thereafter the SIAC President makes the formal appointment”. Given my conclusion above that the Chairman does not have or retain any institutional powers to appoint an arbitrator, the Arbitration Agreement, when properly construed, simply provides for the Chairman (as a third person) tonominatethe sole arbitrator in the event that the parties are unable to agree on who to nominate, and for the President to subsequently appoint the sole arbitrator. 73 The plaintiff places considerable reliance on the defendant’s Notice of Arbitration which stated that the sole arbitrator was to beappointedby the Chairman (see [8] above). Mr Lee also submits that the defendant did not address this point at all and that the Arbitrator also failed to give any consideration to this point in the Jurisdiction Decision.77Foot Note 77×PWS at para 31. 74 I have not placed much weight on this argument in assessing the proper construction of the Arbitration Agreement. I do not discount the possibility that the reference in the Notice of Arbitration was an honest mistake although I accept that there was no evidence or assertion that it was. Even if it was not a mistake, it would, in my view, only amount to a unilateral and subjective expression of the defendant’s understanding of the Arbitration Agreement post-contract, as opposed to an express confirmation of the parties’ objective intention at the time of contracting. Ultimately, the proper construction of the relevant sentence in the Arbitration Agreement must be objectively ascertained applying the guiding principles I have alluded to above at [65]–[66]. 75 In my judgment, that lone reference by the defendant in its Notice of Arbitration is insufficient to outweigh the importance of seeking to achieve a harmonious reading of the Arbitration Agreement with the provisions in the SIAC Rules 2016, which the parties incorporated expressly by reference into the Arbitration Agreement. Looking at the matter in the round, the proper construction of the parties’ objective intentions is that they intended for the Chairman (as a third person) tonominatethe sole arbitrator and for the President toappointthe sole arbitrator. 76 The plaintiff also contends that r 10.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016 does not apply at all and cannot be a “fallback” provision because the parties specifically referred to “Chairman” in the Arbitration Agreement.78Foot Note 78×PWS at paras 49 to 51; NOA at p 4 (lines 22 to 32).Rule 10.2 provides that: 10.2If within 21 days after the date of commencement of the arbitration, or within the period otherwise agreed by the parties or set by the Registrar,the parties have not reached agreement on the nomination of a sole arbitrator, or if at any time either party so requests, the President shall appoint the sole arbitrator.[emphasis added] 77 I reject the plaintiff’s argument. Nothing in the Arbitration Agreement indicates the parties’ intention to disapply r 10.2. I see no basis to find that that the mere use of the word “Chairman” can have the effect contended for by the plaintiff. I also agree with the Arbitrator that it is relevant to note that r 10.2 is not prefaced by words such as “unless the parties have agreed otherwise”.79Foot Note 79×Zhao’s affidavit at p 30 (para 69).Where parties have expressly incorporated a set of institutional rules to govern the conduct of arbitral proceedings between them, they should not be lightly assumed to have intended to disapply particular provisions of those institutional rules unless that intention is clearly expressed in the arbitration agreement or if such objective intention of the parties to create such a carve-out is clear as a matter of construction. In the absence of any such clear indications, the court should incline towards reading the arbitration agreement harmoniously with thewholeof the institutional rules aschosenby the parties. Thus, in the case before me, if the mechanism stipulated in the Arbitration Agreement (ie, to nominate the sole arbitrator according to parties’ agreement or alternatively by the Chairman’s choice) failed, r 10.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016 remains applicable as a fallback mechanism. Contrary to the plaintiff’s submission, the Arbitrator’s appointment isnotinvalid simply because the Arbitrator was not appointed or nominated by the Chairman. Nor does it mean that the Arbitrator’s appointment was not in accordance with the parties’ agreement. 78 If the plaintiff’s argument is to be accepted, this would mean that if the Chairman was unavailable or unable toappointan arbitrator for whatever reason, the Arbitration Agreement would be hamstrung and rendered unworkable. The plaintiff even suggests that in such a scenario, it would be necessary for the SIAC to go back to the parties to inform them of this development and to act on such decisions that the partiesmay agreeon subsequently (see [28] above). However, this suggestion is problematic for a number of reasons. 79 First, there is no indication in the wording of the Arbitration Agreement that such a scenario was envisaged by the parties. Second, such an interpretation would also be commercially absurd and runs contrary to the principle of effective interpretation. It is also likely to generate undue uncertainty and inefficiency since itassumesthat parties will agree on a fallback upon being consulted by the SIAC but that begs the question – what if parties cannot come to an agreement? On the plaintiff’s case, the Arbitration Agreement would be unworkable or in s 6 IAA parlance, it would be rendered “inoperative or incapable of being performed”. However, in order not to defeat the expectations of commercial parties, that is a conclusion that a court will not arrive at lightly, particularly when it can arrive at a commercially logical conclusion that upholds the sanctity and efficacy of the Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the guiding principles mentioned above at [65]–[66]. In my view, the purpose behind the fallback provision in r 10.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016 is this. In cases where the parties are unable to come to an agreement on who to nominate or if for some reason the mechanism in the arbitration agreement becomes unworkable, the President may, in accordance with r 10.2, simply appoint the sole arbitrator and thereby allow the arbitral proceedings to validly continue. In my judgment, this reading of the Arbitration Agreement is to be preferred simply because it is (a) a commercially sensible interpretation and (b) one that does not render the Arbitration Agreement invalid or incapable of being performed. 80 Finally, the plaintiff also relies on paras 8.29–8.33 ofA Guide to the SIAC Rulesfor the proposition that r 10.2 is not a “stopgap mechanism” which allows the President to appoint the arbitrator in all cases. Instead, it is just to facilitate the expedited formation of the tribunal so that neither party can delay the constitution of the tribunal.80Foot Note 80×Zhao’s affidavit at p 289. 81 Paragraphs 8.29–8.33 ofA Guide to the SIAC Rulesstates as follows: 2. Rule 10.2 … a. Default procedure for the nomination and appointment of a sole arbitrator 8.29Parties have a limited time within which they can seek to reach an agreement on a sole arbitrator. This ensures that one or more parties cannot derail the arbitration simply by refusing to cooperate in the constitution of the tribunal. 8.30Rule 10.2 provides that in the event the parties fail to reach an agreement on a sole arbitrator within 21 days after the date of the commencement of the arbitration (ie the receipt by the Registrar of the complete Notice of Arbitration (39)), or at any time if a party so requests, (40) the SIAC President ‘shall appoint the sole arbitrator’. (41) The Registrar may decide (42) or the parties may agree to extend or reduce the 21-day time limit referenced in Rule 10.2 for the parties to reach an agreement on a sole arbitrator. 8.31When required to act under Rule 10.2, the SIAC President generally chooses a candidate from the SIAC Panel of Arbitrators (which, as already noted, is not a constraint on the parties when making their nominations). … The SIAC President may appoint an arbitrator who is not on the SIAC Panel of Arbitrators but who appears on SIAC’s so-called ‘reserve list’, which is often used for relatively low-value disputes. (45) 8.32The SIAC President must take into account any criteria for the appointment of arbitrators agreed by the parties in their contract or set by relevant legislation. (46) The SIAC Practice Note for Administered Cases further provides that ‘in all cases, the objective is to appoint an arbitrator with the attributes of integrity and competence, who is independent and impartial, and who will be perceived as such by the parties’. (47) 8.33For cases with a large amount in dispute, involving State parties or involving complicated questions of law, the SIAC President may choose an arbitrator in consultation with two or more members of the SIAC Court and with the assistance of the SIAC Secretariat. … 82 From this extract, the plaintiff highlights footnote 41 which states “… Rule 10.2 refers to the ‘appointment’ of an arbitrator by the SIAC President. The SIAC President appoints all arbitrators pursuant to Rule 9.3. Thus, the reference to ‘appointment’ in Rule 10.2 refers to both the selection of an arbitrator candidate on a party’s behalf and his or her appointment by the SIAC President”.81Foot Note 81×Zhao’s affidavit at pp 290 and 292.The plaintiff argues that the comment in this footnote shows that there should be no split in appointment and nomination functions, unless parties expressly and unequivocally provided that there is to be such a split.82Foot Note 82×PWS at paras 33 to 34.The plaintiff argues that this is one such case. 83 In my view, the plaintiff’s reliance onA Guide to the SIAC Rulesis entirely misplaced. The footnote quoted above goes nowhere near supporting the plaintiff’s argument. It merely states that where r 10.2 applies, the President selects and appoints the arbitrator, which in and of itself is an uncontroversial comment and a correct interpretation of r 10.2 – but that is as far as the footnote goes. In fact, the footnote acknowledges that under r 9.3 of the SIAC Rules 2016, the President appointsallarbitrators. Logically, this power operates even where parties have nominated an arbitrator or requested a third person to do so. In any case, the footnote comment does not detract from r 10.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016 being a fallback where there is no nomination of the sole arbitrator by the parties or a third person. 84 Under r 10.2 of the SIAC Rules 2016, where more than 21 days have passed after the date of commencement of the arbitration, and either (a) “the parties have not reached agreement on the nomination of a sole arbitrator” or (b) “if at any time either party so requests”, the President shall appoint the sole arbitrator. In the present case, after 21 days from the commencement of Arbitration, the plaintiff did not reply to the defendant’s proposed nomination of a sole arbitrator. Thus, parties were clearly unable to reach agreement on the nomination of a sole arbitrator. The Chairman was, as explained by the SIAC (see [17] above), also unable to nominate the sole arbitrator due to a conflict. Additionally, as stated above at [22], the defendant wrote to the SIAC onthree occasionsrequesting the President to appoint a sole arbitrator because 21 days had passed and parties had not agreed on the nomination of an arbitrator.83Foot Note 83×Zhao’s affidavit at pp 32 to 33 (paras 82 to 84).In these circumstances, r 10.2 was in my view triggered. Accordingly, the SIAC did not err in requesting the President to appoint the Arbitrator and thus, when the President appointed the Arbitrator, it was in accordance with the parties’ agreement in the Arbitration Agreement. 85 Given that I have found that the Arbitrator has jurisdiction over the Arbitration, I do not see any merit to the plaintiff’s contention that any resulting award in the Arbitration may face challenges in enforcement overseas – it does not provide a legitimate reason for the court to rule that the Arbitrator does not have jurisdiction. In any event, it is not the place of this court to second-guess the potential success or failure of any challenges that may be mounted against enforcement of any resulting award from the Arbitration. That a foreign enforcement court may come to a different view and decline enforcement is a feature and potential risk inherent within the very architecture of the Model Law and the New York Convention – parties are taken to have accepted that potential risk when they agree to arbitration as their choice of dispute resolution.",
