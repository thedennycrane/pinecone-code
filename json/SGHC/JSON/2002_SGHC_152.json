        "BACKGROUND": "6.        In or around 1963 or 1966,\n\nthe parents of the parties started the Business. The mother is Mdm Pang and the father was\n\nTan Suan Kui. There was conflicting evidence as to what the business name was at that time\n\nbut that is not material. The Business was subsequently carried on in No. 64 SGW and the\n\nfamily lived on top i.e in No. 64A SGW. 64/64A had been bought by the parents in or about\n\n1966 using monies from the Business.7.        On 4 May 1973, 30 MD was\n\nregistered in the name of the parents as joint tenants. Presumably the purchase monies\n\nwere also from the Business. Both parents ran the Business with some help from the three\n\nsons as and when each was old enough to help out.8.        In 1982, the father died.\n\nAt the time of the father’s death, Teck Khong was about 32 years of age, Teck Hing\n\nwas about 25 years of age and Pian Meng was about 24 years of age. Mdm Pang would have\n\nbeen about 57 years of age.9.        30 MD became registered in\n\nMdm Pang’s sole name, as the remaining joint tenant. 64/64A SGW also became\n\nregistered in her sole name. As for the Business, Mdm Pang relied primarily on Pian Meng\n\nto assist her, but, on all accounts, she was the one in charge. She was a determined\n\nperson, energetic and sociable (NE 118).10.        Pian Meng appeared to have\n\nthe highest level of education among the three sons. He stopped his education at\n\n‘A’ levels whereas Teck Khong’s and Teck Hing’s education stopped at\n\nSecondary Two or thereabouts.11.        Pian Meng was also the\n\nmost able of the three sons. After the father’s death, it was he who would help his\n\nmother to liaise with bankers i.e Kwangtung Provincial Bank (‘KPB’) and the\n\nrelevant authorities. He was also the cashier of the Business and was the sole signatory\n\nof the Business’ cheques as Mdm Pang did not sign cheques. He had also apparently\n\nbecome a guarantor to KPB, after the father died, whereas neither of the Plaintiffs was a\n\nguarantor. He was also instrumental in renovating the business premises in 1986, and\n\npersuading Mdm Pang to run a karaoke pub also at the business premises in 1990 (although\n\nTeck Khong claimed he was the one who persuaded Mdm Pang), and in 1992 to focus on the\n\nkaraoke pub business. Teck Khong helped in some cleaning work and acted as a bouncer. Teck\n\nHing worked as a cook.12.        The entire family,\n\nincluding the father, had a gambling habit.13.        The eldest son Teck Khong\n\nhad a violent temper and often had serious rows with his father. As a result, his father\n\nhad wanted to disown him. Teck Khong also had serious rows with Mdm Pang.14.        He was married in 1974. He\n\nhad a daughter from this marriage but his wife divorced him and took the child with her\n\naround 1980. He then married a woman from Hainan, China in 1992 and had a son from this\n\nmarriage. He bought a property in Hainan with the help of Mdm Pang but when he divorced\n\nhis second wife, that property was transferred to her as part of a divorce settlement.15.        Subsequently, he placed a\n\ndown payment to buy another property in Hainan, again with the help of Mdm Pang, but the\n\npurchase was not completed because the developer had discontinued its business.16.        In or about 1994, Teck\n\nKhong asked his mother to make him a partner in the Business but his mother declined.17.        In 1995, he married his\n\nthird wife, also from Hainan, but this marriage also ended in divorce in 1997.18.        In June or July 1997, Teck\n\nKhong caused a fire in 64/64A SGW because of a cigarette butt he had left. As a result,\n\nthere was a violent quarrel between Mdm Pang and him in which he threw a glass either at\n\nher which Pian Meng deflected or he threw a glass onto the ground.19.        In around April 1999, he\n\nresided with Pian Meng and his family at rented premises at 47 Walmer Drive. He married a\n\nfourth time in 2000. His fourth wife is also from Hainan. She was also residing at 47\n\nWalmer Drive until about July 2000 when Teck Khong and her moved back to 64A SGW. This was\n\nbecause by then Pian Meng’s wife had made a revelation when she had had a quarrel\n\nwith Pian Meng. Teck Khong said she ‘revealed that [Pian Meng] has swallowed the\n\nbrothers’ money’ (NE 40). Also, Pian Meng’s mother-in-law was not happy\n\nwith Teck Khong’s wife (NE 41).20.        The second son, Teck Hing,\n\nmarried one Wang Ah Choo who is known as Anna. She also helped in the Business by working\n\nin the kitchen peeling potatoes, cooking and washing the dishes (NE 100). They have three\n\ndaughters. Apparently, living conditions became crowded at 64A SGW when the third child\n\nwas born and in 1990, Mdm Pang bought a property known as 3 Cowdray Avenue for Teck Hing\n\nand his family to live in. This property was registered in the name of Teck Hing and Pian\n\nMeng and Anna’s name was not included. Pian Meng assisted by liaising with the\n\nsolicitors for the purchase. He suggested that Anna was resentful that she was not\n\nregistered as a co-owner of 3 Cowdray Avenue. Pian Meng also suggested that Anna had been\n\njealous of him as it was he, more than the other siblings, who was helping Mdm Pang in the\n\nBusiness.21.        As for Pian Meng, he was\n\nmarried to Angela Goh Lee Hoon in 1995 and had a son from the marriage in 1996. He\n\nsuggested that Mdm Pang was particularly happy to have a grandson. At the time of Mdm\n\nPang’s first stroke, Pian Meng and his family were staying with Mdm Pang and Teck\n\nKhong at 64A SGW.22.        Since 1994, Mdm Pang\n\nsuffered from hypertension and diabetes. There is some dispute as to who would take her to\n\nsee the doctor. The Plaintiffs say it was Teck Hing and his wife who did so most of the\n\ntime but Pian Meng said it was he who did this.",
        "MDM PANG’S FIRST STROKE ON 16 AUGUST 1997 AND FIRST\n\nWILL DATED 22 OCTOBER 1997": "23.        On or about 16 August\n\n1997, Mdm Pang went to Pow Sing Chicken Rice stall in Serangoon Gardens to buy food for a\n\nfamily dinner for the Hungry Ghost Month. She became disoriented and did not know how to\n\nmake her way back. Fortunately, the owner of the Chicken Rice stall recognised her and\n\nbrought her home. He told the Tan family that Mdm Pang had become dazed and confused and\n\nwhile at his stall, she thought she was at the Business’ premises. At that time she\n\nwas about 72 years of age.24.        It is common ground that\n\nshe had suffered a stroke that day. I will elaborate later on the medical evidence.25.        According to the\n\nPlaintiffs, Mdm Pang stayed with Teck Hing for three months after her stroke before she\n\nstayed with Pian Meng. During that time, Pian Meng would take Mdm Pang out for long\n\ndrives. On a few occasions after they returned, Anna noticed Mdm Pang’s right hand\n\nthumb was stained with ink and reported this to Teck Hing. When Pian Meng was confronted\n\nabout this, he explained that there were forms to be signed before lawyers and banks. The\n\nPlaintiffs trusted Pian Meng and did not probe further. This version was not disputed\n\nexcept that according to Pian Meng, Mdm Pang stayed with Teck Hing for three weeks, and\n\nnot three months, before returning to stay with Pian Meng and his family.26.        In or about February 1998,\n\nPian Meng and his family moved to rented premises at 29 Saint Heliers Avenue. Mdm Pang\n\ncame to live with them until February 2000.27.        I come now to the AEIC of\n\nMr Colin Caines, a solicitor, whose late partner Mr J S Khosa had acted for Mdm\n\nPang’s husband in respect of the Business and other matters.28.        According to Mr\n\nCaines’ AEIC, Pian Meng had telephoned him and informed him that Mdm Pang wanted to\n\nmake a Will. Soon after that Pian Meng saw Mr Caines in Mr Caines’ office and said\n\nthat his mother had had a stroke and wanted to make a Will leaving everything to him. Mr\n\nCaines advised Pian Meng to get a doctor’s report confirming that she was able to\n\nexecute a Will.29.        On 22 October 1997, Pian\n\nMeng called at Mr Caines’ office and produced a certificate dated 21 October 1997\n\nfrom Dr Chong Piang Ngok (‘Dr PN Chong’), a neurologist, certifying that she was\n\nin full command of her mental faculties and able to execute a Will. I will set out the\n\nterms of the certificate when I elaborate later on the medical evidence.30.        Pian Meng also informed Mr\n\nCaines that Mdm Pang was ready to execute her Will and that she was conversant in\n\nHainanese. Mr Caines informed Pian Meng that the services of an interpreter would be\n\nrequired. His office then contacted the Subordinate Courts and an appointment was made for\n\nthe interpreter to attend Mdm Pang at Mr Caines’ office later on the same day.31.        Mdm Pang’s Will was\n\nprepared by Mr Caines the same day. In the meantime, Pian Meng went to fetch Mdm Pang.32.        At the appointed time,\n\nvarious persons attended at Mr Caines’ office. After the interpreter had interpreted\n\nthe Will to Mdm Pang and confirmed to Mr Caines that the Will was in accordance with her\n\nwishes, Mdm Pang executed the Will in the presence of two of Mr Caines’ staff.33.        Mr Caines was Pian\n\nMeng’s witness. His AEIC was executed on 16 January 2002 and filed on 1 February\n\n2002. Pian Meng’s AEIC was executed on 31 January 2002, about two weeks after Mr\n\nCaines’ AEIC was executed. Pian Meng’s AEIC was filed on 1 February 2002, the\n\nsame day as Mr Caines’ was filed.34.        Pian Meng’s AEIC was\n\nto the effect that after he had gotten married (in 1995) and had a son (in 1996), Mdm Pang\n\nstarted to indicate that it was time she transferred the Business and her properties to\n\nhim.35.        In mid-1997, he brought\n\nMdm Pang to Khosa & Caines. However, as they did not make an appointment and Mr Caines\n\nwas in court, they did not get to see Mr Caines that day. Pian Meng claimed that they\n\nspoke to Mr Caines’ secretary, one Ms Tan, to explain Mdm Pang’s intentions. The\n\nsecretary advised them that a considerable amount of stamp duty would have to be paid if\n\nMdm Pang transferred her properties to him (inter vivos). A cheaper way was to make a\n\nWill. Ms Tan suggested that they consider this and make another appointment to see Mr\n\nCaines.36.        However in August 1997,\n\nMdm Pang had her (first) stroke. The rest of his AEIC tallied with Mr Caines’ AEIC in\n\nthat it was Mr Caines who advised him to get a doctor’s report on Mdm Pang’s\n\nability to make a Will and Mr Caines (or his office) who arranged for the interpreter.37.        At first blush, there did\n\nnot seem to be any material difference between Mr Caines’ AEIC and Pian Meng’s\n\nexcept that Pian Meng’s had mentioned an additional ‘fact’ i.e an earlier\n\nvisit to Khosa & Caines and the advice of Mr Caines’ secretary whereas Mr\n\nCaines’ had not.38.        However, during\n\ncross-examination, Pian Meng said that he had not spoken or seen Mr Caines at all before\n\n22 October 1997, the day when Mdm Pang executed the Will.39.        Pian Meng also said that\n\nprior to 22 October 1997, and after the alleged visit to Khosa & Caines in mid 1997,\n\nhe had called Ms Tan and told her that his mother wanted to make a Will, that she had had\n\na stroke and could speak only Hainanese or simple Hokkien. It was Ms Tan who said her\n\noffice would arrange for a Hainanese interpreter and that Pian Meng should get a\n\ncertificate from a doctor as Mdm Pang had had a stroke. Pian Meng also said that he did\n\nnot go to Mr Caines’ office earlier and alone on 22 October 1997.40.        This evidence contradicted\n\nthe AEIC of Mr Caines. It also contradicted Pian Meng’s own AEIC at para 43 where he\n\nhad said that it was Mr Caines who said that he (Pian Meng) should get a medical report on\n\nMdm Pang.41.        Pian Meng insisted that it\n\nwas Mr Caines who had made mistakes in his AEIC. He also said that as for para 43 of his\n\nown AEIC, that was a mistake on his (Pian Meng’s) part.42.        Yet, when Mr Caines\n\neventually gave oral evidence, Pian Meng’s Counsel, Mr Daniel John, did not ask him\n\nwhether he had made mistakes in his AEIC or take him through what Pian Meng had said in\n\noral testimony.43.        I should also mention\n\nanother point. In cross-examination, Pian Meng said twice, at NE 157 and 162, that Mr\n\nCaines did speak to Mdm Pang on 22 October 1997 in simple Hokkien about her Will. However,\n\nin cross-examination, Mr Caines said he had not spoken to Mdm Pang as she spoke Hainanese\n\nand he was totally ignorant of the language. He had left it to the interpreter to\n\ninterpret the Will to her (NE 274). Mr Caines was not asked in re-examination whether he\n\nhad spoken to Mdm Pang in simple Hokkien. Mr Caines also confirmed that in preparing the\n\nWill, he had acted on instructions from Pian Meng, and not Mdm Pang (NE 276).44.        As for the interpreter,\n\nthis was one Loh Lim. He said that he had interpreted Mdm Pang’s Will to her in\n\nHainanese and did so in layman’s language. Pian Meng’s version was that the\n\ninterpretation was done sentence by sentence and that each time the interpreter had asked\n\nMdm Pang if she understood (NE 158).45.        Loh Lim said he made sure\n\nMdm Pang understood the contents of her Will and she confirmed to him that she did.\n\nHowever, he could not remember how she had responded to him (NE 223).",
        "TRANSFER OF THE BUSINESS TO PIAN MENG ON 27 NOVEMBER\n\n1997": "46.        It is not disputed that\n\nMdm Pang transferred the Business to Pian Meng on 27 November 1997 i.e about a month after\n\nshe executed her first Will. This was done without the assistance of any solicitor and\n\nalso without the knowledge of Teck Khong and Teck Hing at that time. Pian Meng alleged\n\nthat an officer at ROCB had spoken in Hokkien to his mother.47.        It is not disputed that\n\nTeck Khong and Teck Hing knew about the transfer thereafter because various licences for\n\nthe running of the Business had to be in the name of Pian Meng thereafter and these\n\nlicences were displayed in the premises.48.        Teck Khong apparently\n\nspoke to Mdm Pang about the transfer of the Business to Pian Meng but he said she did not\n\nrespond as she was ill (NE 24 and 25). Pian Meng’s version was that Mdm Pang told\n\nPian Meng to ignore Teck Khong’s objection to the transfer (NE 25).49.        Teck Hing said he did not\n\nspeak to Mdm Pang about the transfer of the Business because she was ill. He did not\n\nobject to the transfer because he had asked Pian Meng why the transfer was done and Pian\n\nMeng had said this was for convenience because Mdm Pang was ill. The change was temporary\n\nuntil Mdm Pang got well (NE 128).50.        It is not disputed that\n\nafter the transfer of the Business, Pian Meng continued to see to it that the salaries and\n\nbonuses of Teck Khong and Teck Hing up to the third week of January 2001 were paid\n\nalthough the actual sums paid were disputed.51.        Also, Teck Khong was given\n\nthousands of dollars on various occasions for his trips to China although the actual\n\namount was disputed. In April 1998, $6,000 was deposited into a fixed deposit account of\n\nTeck Khong’s at Bank of China. In December 1999, $70,000 was given to Teck Khong to\n\nhelp him buy a property in China. Some of Teck Khong’s gambling expenses and his\n\ncredit card bills up to March 2000 were paid.52.        For Teck Hing, Pian Meng\n\nalso arranged for payment of the property tax of 3 Cowdray Avenue, utility bills, some\n\nhousehold expenses and all or part of tuition fees for his daughters and, in 1999 to 2000,\n\n12 monthly instalments for a car. In December 1999, Pian Meng provided $10,000 for a\n\nholiday in Korea for Teck Hing and his family. Pian Meng also arranged for payment of some\n\ngambling debts of Teck Hing.53.        However, the actual source\n\nof all these monies is another matter.",
        "SALE OF 30 MD (i.e MEDWAY DRIVE) AND USE OF THE NET SALE\n\nPROCEEDS": "54.        Pian Meng alleged that 30\n\nMD was rented out initially. However because the tenants said the house was haunted and\n\nrebuilding it would cost too much, his mother decided to sell it (NE 179). Her intention\n\nwas to use the sale proceeds from 30 MD to buy a property for Pian Meng and his family and\n\nalso for Mdm Pang herself and Teck Khong, to stay in (NE 184). The new property was to be\n\nregistered in Pian Meng’s name only (NE 180). This appeared to be corroborated by\n\nTeck Khong (NE 38).55.        Teck Khong had accompanied\n\nPian Meng to look for a suitable property. This was not disputed by Teck Khong. As Pian\n\nMeng could not find a suitable property to purchase and the property market was falling,\n\nMdm Pang allegedly decided to sell 30 MD first. The option was granted on 26 May 1998 and\n\nthe sale was completed on 31 August 1998. The sale price was $910,000. Apparently, Pian\n\nMeng had told Teck Khong about the sale and the price.56.        One Ms Lee Lay See acted\n\nfor Mdm Pang in the sale. Unfortunately, Ms Lee was not in Singapore when it was her turn\n\nto give evidence. The parties agreed that her AEIC should be withdrawn but no adverse\n\ninference should be drawn on account of her not giving evidence.57.        The net sale proceeds of\n\n$898,497.67 was deposited into a joint bank account with HSBC which Mdm Pang had opened\n\nwith Pian Meng. The one per cent option money was also deposited into this account. This\n\naccount was opened only after Mdm Pang’s first stroke of 16 August 1997 (NE 182)\n\nalthough Mdm Pang had other bank accounts in her sole name. Pian Meng said that one of the\n\nfunctions of the joint account was to deduct property tax for 64/64A SGW from this account\n\n(NE 182). About $900,000 was withdrawn from the joint account in various tranches by Pian\n\nMeng thereafter and placed in fixed deposits with HSBC and KPB and in an ‘i’\n\naccount with UOB, all of which were in Pian Meng’s sole name. Pian Meng claimed his\n\nmother was aware of the monies being placed into the joint account although his siblings\n\nwere not. He said there was no need to inform them of this because they knew the sale\n\nproceeds were for him to buy a new property (NE 187).58.        Pian Meng claimed that he\n\nused the $900,000 to pay expenses for the three sons as well as Mdm Pang’s.59.        He also claimed in para 57\n\nof his AEIC that when Teck Hing found out that Mdm Pang had given him the sale proceeds,\n\nTeck Hing asked him for $300,000 to settle his gambling debts and he gave about $200,000\n\nto Teck Hing. However, in cross-examination, Pian Meng said that the $200,000 was an\n\naccumulated sum given over various occasions and not when the request for $300,000 was\n\nmade. Also, the $200,000 was from both the sale proceeds and an overdraft from KPB (NE 195\n\nand 196).60.        Pian Meng further said he\n\nused the balance of the sale proceeds to pay his own gambling debts. However, he did not\n\nsay exactly how much was used to pay for expenses or gambling debts of others, and how\n\nmuch of his own. Neither was he able to produce any documentary evidence to link the use\n\nof the sale proceeds with any payment for any of the others’ expenses or gambling\n\ndebts.61.        I would add that in August\n\n1998, before the completion of the sale of 30 MD on 31 August 1998, Mdm Pang had had a\n\nfall. I will elaborate on this later when I deal with the medical evidence.",
        "MDM PANG’S MORTGAGE OF 64/64A SGW AND HER WILL\n\nDATED 3 NOVEMBER 1999": "62.        It is not disputed that in\n\nAugust 1999, Mdm Pang had had a second stroke. A few months later, she executed a mortgage\n\nof 64/64A SGW on 3 November 1999 but the mortgage was dated 22 November 1999. She also\n\nexecuted her second Will on 3 November 1999.63.        Pian Meng alleged that Mdm\n\nPang had intended to transfer 64/64A SGW to him. It was mortgaged to KPB for about\n\n$500,000 for the Business. He approached KTL for credit facilities. He could not remember\n\nwhether he approached KTL before or after Mdm Pang’s second stroke (NE 198 and 199).\n\nHowever, he said the manager and assistant manager of KTL came to 64 SGW one lunch-time\n\nand met up with him. Mdm Pang was not present but she was aware of the meeting. He told\n\nthe bank managers that Mdm Pang wanted to transfer 64/64A SGW to him and it would be\n\nmortgaged to KTL for a loan (NE 198). The first letter of offer from KTL to Pian Meng was\n\ndated 15 September 1999. The offer was for an overdraft facility of $400,000 and a term\n\nloan of $1m. This was because KTL considered the property to be worth $2m and was prepared\n\nto lend 70% of that figure.64.        Pian Meng said he wanted\n\nto take a loan totalling $1.4m because, besides the $500,000 owing to KPB, he was thinking\n\nof rebuilding the property. That would cost $500,000 (NE 199). I think that what he meant\n\nwas that the property was to be renovated.65.        As KTL had recommended to\n\nPian Meng that Pian Meng and Mdm Pang see a solicitor Ms Annie Yap of M/s Ng Yap &\n\nPartners, they did so. Ms Yap advised that if Mdm Pang gave the property to Pian Meng, KTL\n\nwould not take a mortgage on the property. Presumably this was because KTL would be\n\nconcerned that the gift may be set aside if Mdm Pang were to become a bankrupt or that the\n\nproperty might be subject to a charge for estate duty, depending on Mdm Pang’s\n\ncircumstances, should she pass away within a certain number of years.66.        Ms Yap advised that Pian\n\nMeng buy the property from Mdm Pang. The purchase price would be $2m. He would have to\n\nraise $200,000 as the deposit and subsequently when the sale was completed, Mdm Pang could\n\ngive the purchase monies to Pian Meng.67.        Subsequently, Mdm Pang and\n\nPian Meng met Ms Yap again on 23 September 1999, this time to sign the Sale & Purchase\n\nAgreement. It was interpreted to Mdm Pang in Hokkien by Ms Yap’s secretary Mandy\n\nPhang.68.        According to Pian Meng, he\n\nhad mentioned to Ms Yap on these two occasions that his mother had suffered a stroke but\n\nhe did not mention how many times she had suffered a stroke. However Ms Yap did not\n\nsuggest that a doctor’s certificate be obtained before Mdm Pang signed the Sale &\n\nPurchase Agreement (NE 203 and NE 205 to 206).69.        As it turned out, Pian\n\nMeng could not raise the $200,000 for the initial deposit. As for the $900,000 he had\n\nreceived from the sale proceeds of 30 MD (in September 1998), he said that the three\n\nbrothers had spent almost all of it by then.70.        After Pian Meng told Ms\n\nYap that he could not raise the $200,000 for the deposit, Ms Yap told him that he could\n\nnot proceed with the purchase of 64/64A SGW.71.        Pian Meng alleged that he\n\napproached KTL again who suggested that he borrow about $1.5m with Mdm Pang mortgaging\n\n64/64A SGW to serve the loan. In cross-examination, he said that he approached KTL for a\n\nloan to rebuild the property (NE 207). However, that was not exactly what he had said in\n\nhis AEIC. In para 63 of his AEIC, he said the balance of the loan, after paying KPB, would\n\nbe used by him in the Business.72.        Pian Meng then received a\n\nsecond letter of offer from KTL. It was dated 8 October 1999 and was for a total of $1.5m\n\nprovided the property was valued at $2.2m.73.        Pian Meng alleged that Mdm\n\nPang and he then went to see Ms Yap again. This was on 3 November 1999 and by then, the\n\nmortgage and Mdm Pang’s second Will had been prepared (NE 208). He had already spoken\n\nto Ms Yap on the telephone about these two matters.74.        Pian Meng alleged that\n\nafter he could not proceed with the purchase of the property, his mother had told him to\n\ninstruct Ms Yap to prepare the second Will (NE 209), which he did over the telephone. He\n\nalleged that Ms Yap had asked him whether he had other siblings and he told her he had two\n\nelder brothers and that his mother had made a Will in 1997, there was a certificate from a\n\ndoctor and an interpreter was present. Ms Yap then said that she too would require a\n\ndoctor’s certificate for Mdm Pang and asked for the name of the interpreter which\n\nPian Meng provided.75.        On 3 November 1999, Pian\n\nMeng produced another medical certificate from Dr P N Chong. It was also dated 3 November\n\n1999 and was in similar, but not identical, terms as his 21 October 1997 certificate. I\n\nwill also cite the terms of the second certificate later.76.        The second Will also\n\nappointed Pian Meng as sole executor. However, it was a bit more elaborate than the first\n\nWill. It specified that 64/64A SGW was to be given to Pian Meng, whereas the first Will\n\ndid not identify any specific property. It also specified that $10 was to be given to each\n\nof his siblings, whereas the first Will did not mention this $10 figure. The residue of\n\nMdm Pang’s estate was given to Pian Meng.77.        Pian Meng said it was Ms\n\nYap who had suggested the $10 gift to each of his siblings since 64/64A SGW was to be\n\ngiven to Pian Meng under the second Will (NE 210).78.        He said the same\n\ninterpreter, Loh Lim, was also present. Loh Lim interpreted the second Will sentence by\n\nsentence to Mdm Pang (NE 212). The execution of the second Will was witnessed by Ms Yap\n\nand her secretary, Ms Phang. Loh Lim also interpreted the mortgage to Mdm Pang. Ms Yap\n\nthen got him to sign a note to confirm that he had explained a letter of offer from KTL\n\ndated 8 October 1999 and the mortgage to Mdm Pang in Hainanese.79.        Loh Lim also gave evidence\n\nin respect of the mortgage and the second Will. He said he explained the second Will in\n\nlayman’s language and made sure that Mdm Pang understood what he had explained. He\n\ncould not recall how she responded (NE 223). He explained the gist of KTL’s second\n\nletter of offer dated 8 October 1999 and the gist of the mortgage and its consequences to\n\nMdm Pang (NE 224 and 225). He agreed that he signed the note prepared by Ms Yap to confirm\n\nthat he had explained the letter of offer and mortgage to Mdm Pang. He could not recall\n\nwhether Mdm Pang had asked any question about the mortgage (NE 225/226).80.        Ms Yap also gave evidence\n\nfor Pian Meng. It was Pian Meng who had called her in late August or early September 1999\n\nto say that Mdm Pang wanted to make a gift of 64/64A SGW to him and he wanted to use the\n\nproperty to take a loan from KTL. Ms Yap confirmed that she had advised that the property\n\nshould not be transferred to Pian Meng by way of gift if KTL was to take a mortgage on it.\n\nShe suggested a sale and purchase instead. In fact she had informed Pian Meng of this over\n\nthe telephone when he first contacted her (NE 232).81.        Pian Meng and Mdm Pang\n\ncame to see Ms Yap in early September 1999. Although Mdm Pang spoke Hainanese, Ms Yap was\n\nable to speak to her in simple Hokkien. The first thing that Mdm Pang said was that she\n\nwanted to give the property to Pian Meng but she did not identify the address of the\n\nproperty. When asked whether it was 64/64A SGW, she confirmed this (NE 232). Ms Yap\n\nreiterated twice that Mdm Pang had said she wanted to give the property to Pian Meng (NE\n\n233).82.        As regards the sale price,\n\nit was Pian Meng who suggested that it be $2m (NE 236 line 21). She could not recall\n\nwhether Pian Meng had mentioned in the first meeting that Mdm Pang had suffered two\n\nstrokes (NE 233). Mdm Pang did not appear sick to her and was quite jovial (NE 234).83.        The Sale & Purchase\n\nAgreement Ms Yap prepared had a provision for vacant possession even though 64 SGW was\n\nbeing used for the Business and there was no suggestion that 64A would necessarily be\n\nvacant. Ms Yap explained that she had used the simplest form of a sale & purchase\n\nagreement because the transaction was between mother and son. She did not explain to Mdm\n\nPang that the sale was with vacant possession.84.        Ms Yap confirmed that the\n\nSale & Purchase had to be aborted as Pian Meng could not raise the $200,000 deposit.\n\nThereafter, it was Pian Meng who called her again in early October 1999. Pian Meng wanted\n\nto go ahead with taking a loan from KTL and the property would be mortgaged by Mdm Pang to\n\nsecure the loan. It was also Pian Meng who mentioned that his mother wanted to make a new\n\nWill as one of her properties (i.e 30 MD) had been sold and Mdm Pang wanted to update the\n\nWill (NE 240). Subsequently, a copy of the first Will and the earlier medical certificate\n\nof Dr P N Chong was provided to Ms Yap. Ms Yap said it was she who asked for another\n\nmedical certificate as a matter of prudence even though Mdm Pang had appeared jovial to\n\nher in the first meeting. She said that she also included the clause in the second Will\n\nabout the $10 gift to each of the siblings because she had asked Mdm Pang whether there\n\nwere other children and Mdm Pang said she had two other sons. However, it was Pian Meng\n\nwho provided the names and particulars of the other two sons (NE 241 to 242).85.        She confirmed the\n\nexecution of the mortgage and the second Will by Mdm Pang on 3 November 1999 and that she\n\nhad asked Loh Lim to sign the note to confirm that Mdm Pang understood the KTL letter of\n\noffer dated 8 October 1999 and the mortgage.",
        "HOW TECK KHONG AND TECK HING CAME TO LEARN ABOUT THE\n\nWILLS": "86.        It is not disputed that\n\nPian Meng’s wife had had a quarrel with Pian Meng in 1999. She then checked into a\n\nchalet. Feeling lonely, she called Anna (Teck Hing’s wife) to join her. In the course\n\nof their conversation, she blurted out the details of Mdm Pang’s Will or Wills (see\n\nDr Kong Sim Guan’s report dated 8 January 2001 and Teck Khong’s evidence at NE\n\n40 and 43).87.        Pian Meng alleged that\n\nTeck Khong then went through Pian Meng’s drawers at 47 Walmer Drive and discovered\n\nthe two Wills. He alleged that Teck Khong and Teck Hing then approached Mdm Pang to ask\n\nher to sell 64/64A SGW and give the sale proceeds to Teck Khong and Teck Hing but Mdm Pang\n\nsaid it was not to be sold as it was for Pian Meng. The conversation was allegedly in the\n\npresence of Anna at 3 Cowdray Avenue but Anna was not called by either side to give\n\nevidence.88.        It is common ground that\n\nthe Plaintiffs subsequently applied for an inquiry on the question whether a Committee for\n\nMdm Pang should be appointed under the Act. The application was filed on 21 June 2000 in\n\nOS No 924 of 2000. The Plaintiffs relied on the evidence of a psychiatrist Dr Francis\n\nNgui. The application was contested by Pian Meng on the ground that Mdm Pang’s mental\n\ncondition was not such as to justify the making of an order to appoint a Committee. Pian\n\nMeng relied on the evidence of another psychiatrist Dr Kong Sim Guan, also known as Dr\n\nDouglas Kong. The application was to be heard by me and in view of the contest, I directed\n\nthat the doctors were to attend and be cross-examined and that Mdm Pang be brought to\n\ncourt.89.        On the day of the hearing\n\ni.e 22 January 2001, I interviewed Mdm Pang for about 15 minutes in the presence of the\n\nrespective doctors and solicitors before any person was to be cross-examined.90.        Thereafter, Pian\n\nMeng’s Counsel, who was then Mr Koh Hai Keong, informed me that Dr Kong was prepared\n\nto take the position that as of the date of the hearing, a Committee should be appointed.\n\nAs the application was no longer contested, a Committee of Mdm Pang was appointed. As\n\nthere was no dispute as to who should be the members of the Committee, the Plaintiffs were\n\nappointed.",
        "SUMMARY OF RESPECTIVE POSITIONS ON MDM PANG’S\n\nCONDITION": "91.        The Plaintiffs’\n\nposition was that after the first stroke, Mdm Pang was confused especially in the first\n\nfew months after the stroke. She was also very forgetful, noisy, stripping herself, seeing\n\nthings, incontinent, had to be fed, needed assistance walking because she was weak on one\n\nside of her body and because of her partial blindness. She was knocking into things.\n\nExamples of Mdm Pang’s poor memory were that she would forget that she had taken a\n\nmeal. She would have to be reminded to brush her teeth and take her bath. She could not\n\nmake much sense, apart from knowing the names of family members.92.        Pian Meng’s position\n\nwas that Mdm Pang’s condition was not as severe as the Plaintiffs were making it out\n\nto be and that she recovered in October 1997 to a large extent to her original state. She\n\nwas able to walk on her own and go out to buy her lunch (NE 121, 168, 173 to 175). Even\n\nafter her second stroke, she would visit the karaoke pub, sit near the cashier’s\n\ncounter and chat with the regular customers (NE 123). However Teck Hing said she was not\n\ndoing anything at the cashier’s counter and she recognised only some old customers\n\nwithout carrying on conversations (NE 126).93.        Pian Meng’s position\n\nwas that Mdm Pang was lucid at all material times and what he did was on her instructions\n\nor with her concurrence. However he also said that after the first stroke, Mdm Pang was\n\nmore dependent on him (NE 175 to 176).",
        "THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE": "94.        Evidence was given by\n\nthree medical practitioners for the trial of the present action:(a)    Dr PN Chong, a neurologist, practising under the\n\n    name of PN Chong Neurology Clinic. He has also written extensively.(b)    Dr Kong Sim Guan (also known as Dr\n\n    Douglas Kong), a consultant psychiatrist, practising under the name of Ang & Kong\n\n    Psychiatric & Behavioural Medicine Clinic. He has also worked in the United Kingdom\n\n    before. He has conducted numerous lectures and written quite extensively.(c)    Dr Francis Ngui, a consultant\n\n    psychiatrist at Woodbridge Hospital and then at Changi General Hospital. He also worked in\n\n    Australia before Singapore and has written some papers.Dr PN Chong and Dr Kong were witnesses for Pian Meng and\n\nDr Ngui was a witness for the Plaintiffs.",
        "Dr PN Chong and Dr Kong": "95.        As I have said, it is not\n\ndisputed that Mdm Pang had had her first stroke on 16 August 1997. This affected her right\n\noccipital lobe, which in turn affected her vision. On 19 August 1997, she was brought to\n\nsee a Dr Gordon Ku for her other ailments. Dr Ku referred her to see Dr PN Chong.96.        Dr PN Chong was informed\n\nthat on 17 August 1997, Mdm Pang was talking ‘wrongly to wrong person’. On 18\n\nAugust 1997, she was walking in an unsteady manner. Her speech was repetitive. After\n\ngiving money to a taxi driver, she was telling the taxi driver her age and cried. She was\n\nworried that she would not see her grandson walk and was afraid to be alone (see Exhibit\n\nD1).97.        However, when Dr PN Chong\n\nexamined her on 19 August 1997, he found her to ‘be rational, conscious, alert,\n\norientated as to time, space and person’. Her memory was okay. There was a bit of\n\nimpairment of movement of the limbs on the right side. She could not see things on the\n\nleft side. Her sensory function was okay.98.        He gave instructions for a\n\nscan to be done and saw her the next day on 20 August 1997. The scan revealed a lacunar\n\ninfarct i.e a blood clot.99.        He reviewed her on 15\n\nSeptember 1997. She was okay except that she was occasionally talking a bit of rubbish. In\n\ncross-examination, Dr PN Chong said the reason why Mdm Pang talked rubbish occasionally\n\nwas because she was confused.100.        Dr PN Chong also said\n\nthat the confusion had a lot to do with the fact that suddenly she could not see so well\n\nas a result of the first stroke, which affected her right occipital lobe. Hence, he was\n\nnot too perturbed (NE 93). However, he also said that if he had seen her on one of those\n\ndays when she talked rubbish, he would have concluded that she was confused and that she\n\nwould not have been able to exercise legal judgment (NE 142).101.        He saw her again on 21\n\nOctober 1997. He recalled that Pian Meng had accompanied her. This was the visit to him to\n\nobtain the certificate for Mdm Pang’s execution of her first Will. This was not a\n\nscheduled appointment as he was supposed to see Mdm Pang later.102.        In oral\n\nexamination-in-chief, Dr PN Chong said, at NE 83:‘Q         What was your\n\n    opinion then?A         On 21\n\n    October 1997, Defendant brought Mdm Pang to see me as stated in para 6 of AEIC. When I saw\n\n    her I found her rational, conscious, alert, orientated as to time, space and person. I did\n\n    not state in my notes whether she wanted to do a will but I recollect that that was indeed\n\n    what she wanted to do.This was in the context of a busy clinic and the Defendant asked\n\n    if I could write a letter immediately. So I wrote a summary in p.20, of my AEIC, of\n\n    what I thought about her mental capacity at the time.’[Emphasis added.]103.        In cross-examination, Dr\n\nPN Chong said he did carry out some tests on Mdm Pang before he issued the certificate. By\n\nthat, he meant he measured her blood pressure and examined her visual field (NE 95 and\n\n96). He said he also carried out other tests on her cognitive abilities and this was\n\nwritten in his certificate of 21 October 1997. However his certificate was quite brief. It\n\nstated:‘Whom It May ConcernRE: PANG JONG WAN NRIC SD 0854224This is to certify that Mdm Pang suffered a stroke in\n\n    August 1997 resulting in a partial visual disturbance. However this did not affect her\n\n    cognitive abilities at all. She is in full command of her mental faculties and is able to\n\n    understand and execute matters relating to the will. Please do not hesitate to contact me\n\n    if you need further information.’104.        Dr PN Chong said that it\n\nwas the Defendant who told him that Mdm Pang wanted to make a Will. He could not remember\n\nwhether he had asked Mdm Pang about it but, based on logic, he thought he would have asked\n\nher about it (NE 94).105.        The next time Dr PN Chong\n\nsaw Mdm Pang was 8 December 1997. It was Pian Meng, and not Mdm Pang, who informed him\n\nthat problems with the Will had been sorted out (NE 131). Dr PN Chong’s case notes\n\nstated Mdm Pang was well, no complaints. She was smiling.106.        He saw her again on 6\n\nMarch 1998 and 4 June 1998. Thereafter, the next appointment was in three months’\n\ntime i.e in early September 1998.107.        However, Mdm Pang was\n\nbrought to see Dr PN Chong earlier i.e on 21 August 1998. This was because she had had a\n\nfall which caused a swelling on the right side of her head. His later case notes described\n\nit as a ‘Ba-Lu-Ku’.108.        According to Dr PN Chong,\n\nten days later, on 31 August 1998, Mdm Pang’s condition had deteriorated (NE 134).\n\nHowever according to his case notes (Exhibit D1), the information on her deterioration\n\nlike: loss of urine control, walking poor, left leg weak, pertained to 28 and 29 August\n\n1998 because on the day before 31 August and on 31 August 1998 itself, she was okay. In\n\nany event, because she had deteriorated in late August 1998, he did a scan on 31 August\n\n1998. The scan showed that she had bled from the brain because of the fall. She had a\n\nsubdural haematoma.109.        Dr PN Chong saw Mdm Pang\n\nagain on 5 October 1998. He noted there was no more ‘Ba-Lu-Ku’. He repeated the\n\nscan. The subdural haematoma had been resolved.110.        On 16 October 1998, Pian\n\nMeng brought Mdm Pang to see Dr Kong because Mdm Pang frequently awoke and her memory had\n\ndeteriorated (NE 85 and 217). This was her first visit to see Dr Kong. Dr Kong had been\n\ntreating Pian Meng’s wife for post-natal problems. Although the haematoma caused by\n\nthe August 1998 fall had been absorbed, Dr Kong’s observation of Mdm Pang on 16\n\nOctober 1998 was that she was mildly confused. He also said she was not able to carry on a\n\nmeaningful conversation. She was disoriented as to time and place. She was restless (NE\n\n249). There was right hemiplegia meaning she was half paralysed (NE 248). His case notes\n\nstated that cognitive tests were impaired. This meant that Mdm Pang could not complete the\n\ntests (NE 250). He gave her Melleril and Fluanxol to clear her confused state of mind (NE\n\n251).111.        The information given by\n\nPian Meng to Dr Kong about Mdm Pang was:‘… can’t sleep, wake up in night, goes to\n\n    toilet, went to living room, talk nonsense, dreams. Dreamed about late husband, daytime\n\n    excited.’[Exhibit D8]112.        On 6 November 1998, Dr\n\nKong saw Mdm Pang a second time. Her confusion had cleared. She had improved but not\n\ntotally (NE 251). Dr Kong encouraged Pian Meng to ensure that Mdm Pang was on regular\n\nmedication. On 25 November 1998, Dr Kong saw Mdm Pang again. She was stable. On 3 February\n\n1999, he was told that she was confused because her medication had been stopped as Pian\n\nMeng was afraid that she would be weakened by it. On 10 March 1999, she appeared okay\n\n(Exhibit D8).113.        In the meantime, on 4\n\nJanuary 1999, Mdm Pang was seen by Dr PN Chong. He was told by Pian Meng that she awoke\n\nfrequently. Her memory had deteriorated. I note that these were the same reasons for\n\nbringing Mdm Pang to see Dr Kong in October 1998 (see para 110 above). Mdm Pang’s\n\nbody on 4 January 1999 was rigid, meaning, the muscle tone was stiff but her movement was\n\nnot bad (NE 85). Dr PN Chong advised that the dosage of Melleril be reduced as Mdm Pang\n\nwas too tired.114.        Dr PN Chong summarised\n\nthe next three visits of Mdm Pang on 22 February, 5 May and 25 June 1999 as follows:\n\n‘Patient was still physically frail and mentally poor. Poor memory. Incontinent\n\nduring this period. This was a bad patch’ (NE 85 line 13 to 15).115.        On 30 August 1999, he saw\n\nher again. He wrote ‘deteriorate’ with an exclamation mark. She looked very\n\nfrail and he was told that she had to be fed (NE 85 line 16 and 17). He repeated a scan\n\nand saw her again on 31 August 1999. He found that she had suffered a second stroke (NE 85\n\nline 18).116.        When he saw Mdm Pang\n\nagain on 3 November 1999, her condition had improved. His case notes read, ‘Mentally\n\nOk’. However he said, ‘I must emphasize that I am looking at the patient as a\n\nneurologist and not as a psychiatrist’ (NE 85). When he was asked what the difference\n\nwas, he said, at NE 89:‘My priority is to diagnose the patient’s\n\n    neurological problem, try to prevent deterioration and try to prevent outcome.Sometimes\n\n    there can be very subtle psychiatric damage effect. I amnotqualified to give\n\n    an opinion on that. If brought to my attention, I will refer to apsychiatrist.If\n\n    there were obvious deficits, I would have observed them.’[Emphasis added.]117.        There was a time stamp\n\nfor this visit and handwritten notes by Dr PN Chong’s staff as to when Mdm Pang went\n\nin and out of his room. She was there for about half an hour.118.        As I have mentioned, 3\n\nNovember 1999 was the date when Pian Meng had asked for a second certificate from Dr PN\n\nChong. His second certificate was in similar, but not identical, terms to his first. I\n\nunderscore the main differences below:‘3 November 1999Whom it may concernRE: PANG JONG WAN NRIC SD 0854224This is to certify that Mdm Pang suffered a stroke in\n\n    August 1997and again in August 1999. This had resulted in a partial visual loss.\n\n    however this did not cause a problem in her cognitive abilities. She is in full command of\n\n    her mental faculties and is mentally capable of executing judgment inlegal matters.\n\n    Please call me if there are any further queries.’119.        Although Dr PN Chong said\n\nthat Pian Meng had only mentioned a Will for the second certificate (NE 138 line 4), I am\n\nof the view that Pian Meng must have mentioned the mortgage or legal documents generally.\n\nThat is why the second certificate is couched in different terms.120.        On this occasion, Dr PN\n\nChong did not check with Mdm Pang as to whether she needed such a certificate (NE 139 line\n\n17/18). His tests on that day were routine and took about five to ten minutes (NE 139 line\n\n20 to NE 140 line 2).121.        In Dr PN Chong’s\n\nopinion, Mdm Pang had started to improve again from 3 November 1999 (NE 136 line 5).122.        He saw her on another\n\nthree occasions between 20 November 1999 to 15 May 2000 and also prescribed medication on\n\nthree other occasions within that period, without having to examine her. There was no\n\nmarked change in Mdm Pang’s mental condition from that on 3 November 1999. In\n\nFebruary 2000, Mdm Pang had another serious fall and had to be warded. Thereafter she\n\nstayed with Teck Hing and his family.123.        On the other hand,\n\naccording to Dr Kong’s evidence, Mdm Pang had maintained well until towards the end\n\nof 1999 when she was reportedly more severe than usual (AEIC para 7). In\n\ncross-examination, Dr Kong elaborated, at NE 254:‘Q       AEIC para 7,\n\n    \"reportedly more severe than usual\". Do you mean her condition had deteriorated?A         That\n\n    was in December 1999. She was more confused after 16 December 1999. For 16 December 1999,\n\n    she was reported as OK and the prescription was continued. There was a phone conversation\n\n    followed by a visit to my clinic because she was quite confused. That was then I advised\n\n    the Defendant that Mdm Pang may well need the maximum dosage of Melleril i.e 150mg for\n\n    each dose.’124.        Dr Kong also clarified\n\nthat it was Pian Meng who called him (NE 254 line 11) and Mdm Pang probably did not turn\n\nup on 16 December 1999 (NE 253 line 7 and 8). It was Pian Meng who turned up to collect\n\nthe medicine.125.        From Dr Kong’s\n\nelaboration and clarification, I am of the view that Mdm Pang’s condition had\n\ndeteriorated from, and not after, 16 December 1999.126.        I would add that I have\n\nlearned that Mdm Pang was seen by Dr Kong’s colleague Dr Peh Lai Huat on 9 December\n\n1999 i.e seven days earlier but as no evidence was given by Dr Peh, I will disregard that\n\nvisit.127.        Mdm Pang was given some\n\nmore medication on 7 January 2000. Dr Kong’s evidence was that this was because she\n\nwas confused (NE 255).128.        Therefore, although Mdm\n\nPang appeared to have improved and remained stable between 3 November 1999 to 15 May 2000,\n\naccording to Dr PN Chong’s evidence, she deteriorated between 16 December 1999 to 7\n\nJanuary 2000, according to Dr Kong’s evidence.129.        After 15 May 2000, Dr PN\n\nChong examined Mdm Pang on 4 September 2000. He observed her to be looking very good and\n\nshe was smiling (Exhibit D1, p 8). By then, the Plaintiffs had already applied to have a\n\ncommittee appointed for Mdm Pang under the Act and Dr PN Chong was aware that there was\n\nlitigation (NE 256 line 2).130.        However, Dr PN Chong must\n\nhave been told that there was a dispute over Mdm Pang’s Will as he said that he\n\nreferred Mdm Pang to Dr Kong for a full psychiatric assessment because of such a dispute\n\n(NE 86 line 1 to 3). As I have mentioned, Mdm Pang was already being treated by Dr Kong by\n\nthen (see para 110).131.        Dr Kong examined Mdm Pang\n\non 5 September 2000. From his case notes, he was also apparently told that there was a\n\ndispute about Mdm Pang’s testamentary capacity.132.        Dr Kong’s\n\nrecollection was that Mdm Pang was fairly lucid on 5 September 2000 although she may have\n\nbeen somewhat tense (NE 256 line 17/18). His case notes indicated that she was able to\n\nprovide him with some information. However he did not examine her in detail as he wanted a\n\nHainanese interpreter to be present. In the meantime, he also sought an assessment of Mdm\n\nPang by a clinical psychologist.133.        On 6 September 2000, Dr\n\nPN Chong examined Mdm Pang. There was no dramatic change.134.        On 26 September 2000, she\n\nwas examined again by Dr PN Chong. He observed her to be smiling and this time he made a\n\nnote with asterisks that she was looking excellent. Mdm Pang also informed him that she\n\nwanted to stay with Pian Meng.135.        On 14 October 2000, the\n\nother children and Anna (instead of Pian Meng) brought Mdm Pang to see Dr PN Chong. She\n\nhad bruises on her forearm. On the same day, they also brought Mdm Pang to see Dr Kong. Dr\n\nKong noted that although she appeared to recognise him from her wink and smile, she denied\n\nknowing him when Anna asked her whether she recognised Dr Kong (NE 264 and Dr Kong’s\n\nAEIC p 18).136.        On 21 October 2000, Mdm\n\nPang saw Dr PN Chong again because she had fallen. She had a bump on her head.137.        The assessment of Mdm\n\nPang by a clinical psychologist Mr Yam was done on 13 November 2000.138.        After that, the\n\nexamination of Mdm Pang by Dr Kong, with the aid of a Hainanese interpreter, was on 26\n\nDecember 2000. Pian Meng and his wife were interviewed separately on 29 December 2000.139.        Both the assessment of\n\nMdm Pang by Mr Yam (on 13 November 2000) and the examination by Dr Kong (on 26 December\n\n2000) are summarised in Dr Kong’s report dated 8 January 2001, which also contained\n\nDr Kong’s opinion. I cite from his report:‘Examination of the patientMdm Pang was examined with the assistance of a Hainanese\n\n    interpreter. She was unsteady with her gait and her attention was variable at times and\n\n    she appeared tired and tense somewhat. She entered my consulting room as she used to\n\n    coming straight towards me with support and aid from her youngest son. She was able to\n\n    give a simple account of herself, her two brothers, one of whom had died, and gave the\n\n    date of her Chinese birthday. She could recall that her husband died when he was 61 years\n\n    of age and she was 57 years. She was disorientated to time but remember coming to my\n\n    clinic to see me for treatment. She was able to state that she had a shophouse in her name\n\n    in Serangoon Gardens called Canberra and that she wanted the shophouse to be taken over by\n\n    her youngest son, Pian Meng.She now wanted to stay with her youngest son and she\n\n    indicated that she was close to her youngest son emotionally. When tested cognitively, she\n\n    failed all but the simplest of tests. She was given a hypothetical question of having 3\n\n    properties and what she would do with it and without hesitation, she said she would give\n\n    it all to her youngest son. When asked why she would not give to her two other sons, she\n\n    replied that she had no property so she could not give it to them. When asked why she\n\n    would give to her youngest son, she replied that her youngest son treated her better and\n\n    had been taking care of her, while her other two son would only see and visit her.Asked about her stay with her second son, she said that\n\n    her two other sons kept telling her that she is mad. She could not understand why. She\n\n    denied that she was mad in any way. She said that she would want to give the business to\n\n    her youngest son and in fact he was already running it after she had run the business for\n\n    more than 10 years prior to him taking over. She could not remember making a will, but if\n\n    she did she will give it to her third son. She openly acknowledge that her favourite son\n\n    was the youngest. She could still (sic) recognized relatives and friends at family\n\n    gathering and functions.Psychometric assessment[This is the assessment by Mr Yam]The psychometric assessment was carried out with the\n\n    Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS).Results indicated that her scores on all subtests were\n\n    markedly impaired. She had difficulty maintaining attention and concentration. There were\n\n    indications of recent and remote memory impairment, difficulties in verbal comprehension\n\n    and reasoning. Her intellectual functioning is likely to be in the intellectually\n\n    deficient range ie below 69.OpinionIn my opinion, Mdm Pang did indeed suffer from a\n\n    Dementia with deficits in her cognitive, memory and executive functioning. However, she\n\n    remained alert and was able to maintain a simple but coherent and meaningful conversation.\n\n    In the assessment of testamentary capacity, a person has to know the extent of their\n\n    property, the claimants to her property and her decisions as to the claimants’ share\n\n    and the reasons for it. When these are simple, a person who is alert and coherent is able\n\n    to make simple decisions on them and such decisions are valid so long as the person\n\n    concerned is able to give a logical reason to it. It would appear to me that Mdm Pang\n\n    passed the test of Testamentary Capacity on this count. To her, what she had was the\n\n    family business at Canberra. She consistently had made it clear that she wanted her\n\n    youngest son to take it over completely and she was able to state the reason why. The\n\n    simplicity of her reasoning was clear and logical and therefore inspite of her Dementia,\n\n    her ability to decide on this matter is valid. That is to say, her decision to gift the\n\n    shophouse and its business to her youngest and favourite son as expressed in her actions\n\n    prior to her stroke and in her will as well as in her various interviews with me is\n\n    unambiguous and clear. She also indicated her desire to stay with her youngest son and\n\n    expressed fondness for them and missing his family. It is clearly a reflection of her\n\n    desire and intention.’Of course, Dr Kong had no personal knowledge as to what\n\nMdm Pang’s actions prior to the first stroke were.",
        "Dr Francis Ngui": "140.        Dr Francis Ngui examined\n\nMdm Pang on 22 March 2000 i.e about 4 months after she executed the mortgage on 64/64A\n\nSGW and her second Will. He was given adverse information about Mdm Pang’s condition\n\nby Teck Hing and Anna who brought Mdm Pang’s brain scan reports and previous\n\nmedication for his consideration. Dr Ngui carried out a detailed examination of Mdm Pang.\n\nHis case notes show that Mdm Pang could not even do simple arithmetic:‘$100 - $7=$7090 - 7=gave up$20 - $3=$7020 - 3=20 (second attempt)$1 - $2.50=$2.507 + 5=?’141.         I state below other\n\nextracts from his case notes for the examination of Mdm Pang on 22 March 2000:‘A VERBATIM RECORD OF CONVERSATION WITH PATIENT\n\n    AND DOCTOR’S COMMENTS….Says she used to own a home which she rented to a\n\n    Japanese Co.Doesn’t know what happened to it.Thinks maybe she still owns.Can’t remember selling it.Doesn’t want to sell her current property.Doesn’t recall signing any document to mortgage her\n\n    current property.MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION….Thought ProcessesRelevant, doesn’t want to sell her\n\n          ‘Canberra’ Shop.

However, may have difficulty managing affairs in view of acalculia.MANAGEMENT (sic) PLAIN:Refer psychologist for neuropsych testing.Open dateTo write MR [meaning, medical report] when neuropsych\n\n    testing completed.’142.        I note that while Mdm\n\nPang was being examined by Dr Kong, she said she would give the Business and 64/64A SGW to\n\nPian Meng. While she was being examined by Dr Ngui, she said she would give it to her\n\nthree children equally.143.        The assessment by a\n\nclinical psychologist was done by Mr Christopher Choo on 29 March 2000. On the same day,\n\nAnna spoke again to Dr Ngui. Dr Ngui’s case note on that day (P6) shows:(at page 10)‘29thMarch 2000 -c/w [meaning,\n\n    conversation with] 2ndDIL [meaning, daughter-in-law]showed a copy of the mortgage documents which pt\n\n          [meaning,   patient] thumbprinted on 22ndNovember 1999. DIL\n\n          says that at that time, pt was even more confused than currently.’(at page 11)‘DIL says she went to see Dr P.N. Chong in February\n\n    2000 and says that Dr P.N. Chong told them he made a mistake when he certified that pt was\n\n    fit to sign legal documents.’Dr Ngui then noted down further information from the\n\n    daughter-in-law and noted six lines from the bottom (of p 11):‘P:    Probably not fit to sign\n\n    legal documents.’144.        Dr Ngui said he changed\n\nhis provisional diagnosis after the results of Mr Choo’s assessment was known. Hence,\n\nhis report dated 13 April 2000 stated:‘9.    On mental state examination,\n\n    Mdm Pang spoke in the Hainanese dialect. She remained calm and was relevant to questions.\n\n    However, she displayed evidence of cognitive problems affecting her memory, orientation,\n\n    arithmetic skills and general knowledge and was unable to describe the extent of her\n\n    personal estate. She also lacked insight  into her memory difficulties. There were no\n\n    features of depression or psychosis.10.    Our clinical psychologist Mr\n\n    Christopher Choo performed a formal neuropsychological assessment on 29 Mar 2000. The\n\n    following results were found: In theClifton Assessment Procedures for the Elderly,\n\n    she scored 3 out of 12; UsingWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Revised), she\n\n    obtained a verbal IQ of 61, placing her within the mildly mentally retarded range,\n\n    strongly suggesting a significant lowering of her intelligence from her premorbid level.\n\n    TheKendrick Object Learning Testshowed severe impairment in her memory function\n\n    with her raw score of 8 falling within the range of patients suffering from dementia.\n\n    Using theCAPE Behaviour Rating Scale, her functioning was assessed to be severely\n\n    impaired.11.    In summary, the findings of her\n\n    mental state and the neuropsychological assessment indicate that she suffers from\n\n    dementia. It is highly likely that she was in a more confused state during the periods\n\n    following her strokes in August 1997 and August 1999.12.    Based on the information\n\n    available, she is currently mentally unfit to sign legal documents pertaining to her\n\n    estate and is unfit to manage her affairs. In my opinion, it is likely that she was\n\n    mentally unfit to manage her personal affairs from the time of her second stroke in August\n\n    1999.’145.        Dr Ngui examined Mdm Pang\n\non a few more occasions which are not material for the present litigation. I now come to\n\nthe examination on 10 January 2001. His case notes for that day were as follows:‘Pt [meaning, Patient]-             Cheerfulmisidentified Dr as lawyerfeels nothing wrong with herselfDon’t need to see DrSays no problem with memorybp\n\n    160/80         Denies seeing lawyer recentlyThinks she has 2 properties but can’t give details(actually pt has only 1 shophouse in her name in Serangoon Garden)Denies giving any of her properties to son to sell offHas 3 sons & 2 grandsons no Granddaughter(actually has 2 G’son & 4 G’daugthers)Says she will divide her property equally among her sons if she has to will it away.Day? Date? Month? Yr?’146.        Dr Ngui then provided a\n\nreport dated 15 January 2001. The material part of this report stated:‘2.    Mdm Pang continues to be on\n\n    regular outpatient follow-up here. She was last reviewed on 10 Jan 2001. Her cognitive\n\n    functions remain impaired without further improvement. She was disoriented to time and had\n\n    significant memory deficits. She was unable to determine how large her family was. In my\n\n    opinion, Mdm Pang is a mentally disordered person, and is of unsound mind in accordance to\n\n    the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act (Chapter 178), and is incapable of managing her\n\n    affairs.’147.        On 21 February 2001, Dr\n\nNgui examined Mdm Pang again. She could carry on a social conversation, was cheerful and\n\nsmiled easily. However she confabulated, meaning she provided information which was untrue\n\nbut which she believed to be true. She said she slept well contrary to the information\n\nprovided by Anna (Exhibit P6, p 15).148.        On 23 March 2001, she\n\nstill appeared cheerful and could carry on a simple social conversation. She said she\n\nslept well and, according to Anna, she could sleep with medicine/treatment (Exhibit P6,\n\np16).149.        During cross-examination,\n\nDr Ngui’s opinion was that at the time when Mdm Pang signed her second Will (and the\n\nmortgage) on 3 November 1999, she was of unsound mind. He was of the same view in respect\n\nof her mental capacity when she signed her first Will on 22 October 1997 but was less\n\nconfident about that view because of the lapse of time between 22 October 1997 and the\n\ntime he first examined her on 22 March 2000.150.        He testified that when\n\nMdm Pang suffered her first stroke, her right occipital lobe was affected. The right\n\noccipital lobe affects her vision whereas the frontal lobes affect her executive functions\n\nlike planning, decision making and organisation. He was of the view that the right\n\noccipital lobe may involve cognitive functions although he accepted that this was\n\ndebatable (NE 65). He said it depended on the extent of the damage and he noted that the\n\nsize of the infarct in Mdm Pang’s case i.e the blood clot, was large.151.        He also noted that there\n\nwas evidence of ischaemia in the peri-ventricular matter. He elaborated on this at NE 54\n\nto 55 as follows:‘Q    Your reference to the past\n\n    medical history refers to 2 areas i.e recent large infarct in brain involving the right\n\n    occipital lobe and secondly evidence of ischaemia in the peri-ventricular white matter.\n\n    Please elaborate on the second.A    The peri-ventricular white matter is\n\n    the deep white matter with nerve fibres extending to the frontal lobes. It is above the\n\n    brain stem and is like in the centre of the brain. Ischaemia signifies a reduction in the\n\n    blood supply to that area. When there is reduction in blood supply, there is damage to\n\n    nerve pathways leading to the frontal lobe. Result would be impairment of the executive\n\n    functions I have mentioned i.e decision making, organisation, judgment.’152.        He was of the opinion\n\nthat Mdm Pang had periods of confusion interspersed with periods of lucidity (NE 64). He\n\naccepted Dr PN Chong’s observation of Mdm Pang on 21 October 1997 but was of the view\n\nthat this may have been during one of Mdm Pang’s lucid intervals. He was of the view\n\nthat Mdm Pang’s disorientation immediately after the first stroke would not have\n\ncleared up in the two to three months thereafter.153.        He stressed that after\n\nMdm Pang’s second stroke in August 1999, there was cumulative damage (NE 59 line 9\n\nand NE 66 line 20/21). He was of the view that she was consistently disorganised from then\n\nto the time he saw her on 22 March 2000 (NE 66 line 6). He said it was unlikely that there\n\nwas a sudden improvement , in between, on 3 November 1999, when Dr PN Chong examined her\n\nand issued his second certificate (NE 66 line 7 to 9).154.        He expressed concern a\n\nfew times that Mdm Pang would be vulnerable to being unduly influenced (see NE 58 line 6\n\nand NE 64 line 17/18).",
        "Dr PN Chong’s and Dr Kong’s responses to Dr\n\nNgui’s opinion": "155.        Dr PN Chong disagreed\n\nwith much of Dr Ngui’s opinion. He was of the view that the damage to Mdm Pang’s\n\nright occipital lobe did not affect her cognitive ability. He was also of the view that\n\nthe ischaemia in the peri-ventricular white matter was commonly seen in the elderly (NE 90\n\nline 21). He said this ‘may have no effect whatsoever’ (NE 90 line 24) and then\n\nwent on to say that in the case of Mdm Pang, her problem then was the occipital lobe and\n\nnot the peri-ventricular matter which was an existing situation (NE 91 line 1 to 8). He\n\nnoted that prior to the first stroke, there was no complaint about Mdm Pang’s mental\n\ncapacity (NE 91 line 7 to 12). He was of the view that Mdm Pang’s confusion related\n\nto her loss of vision but did not affect her cognitive ability (NE 93 line 10 to 19).156.        Dr PN Chong’s\n\nevidence was that her mental condition was unlikely to have changed between 21 October\n\n1997, when he issued the first certificate, and 22 October 1997, when Mdm Pang executed\n\nher first Will. However, he accepted that after the first stroke, Mdm Pang had lucid\n\nmoments and disorientated moments (NE 97).157.        As for the second stroke,\n\nDr PN Chong was of the view that while it increased Mdm Pang’s visual disturbance, it\n\nagain did not affect her cognitive functions (Dr PN Chong’s AEIC para 8).158.        As for her condition on 3\n\nNovember 1999, Dr PN Chong maintained his observation of her that day.159.        He stressed that Dr Ngui\n\nhad based his opinion very much on second-hand information (NE 142 line 1), meaning the\n\ninformation from members of the family since Dr Ngui had not seen Mdm Pang at the crucial\n\ntimes. He said that Dr Ngui was not a neurologist and did not manage stroke patients (NE\n\n141), but this was not correct because Dr Ngui had considerable experience in dealing with\n\nstroke patients (NE 59). Dr PN Chong even went so far as to point out that as regards the\n\nassessment by Mr Choo, the psychologist reporting to Dr Ngui, Mdm Pang’s score on the\n\nCape Behaviour Rating Scale, ‘was really bad but this was information given by the\n\nPlaintiffs’ (NE 145 line 23). However, I note that the overall assessment of Mdm Pang\n\nby Mr Yam, the psychologist reporting to Dr Kong, was equally poor.160.        As for Dr Kong, he sought\n\nto disagree with Dr Ngui’s conclusion in a more limited manner. He was prepared to\n\naccept that Mdm Pang was not fit to sign legal documents if they were complex but he was\n\nof the view that she was fit to sign a simple Will (NE 247). He thought that the latter\n\nwas a specific assessment which Dr Ngui did not carry out (NE 247 line 10/11). However, he\n\nalso accepted that Mdm Pang had periods of confusion and periods of lucidity (NE 267 line\n\n7). Both he and Dr PN Chong pointed out that Dr Ngui’s own provisional diagnosis was\n\nthat Mdm Pang was fit to sign documents pertaining to testamentary capacity (NE 248 line 8\n\nand NE 145 line 16 to 18).161.        As for undue influence,\n\nDr PN Chong declined to venture an opinion thereon because he said he did not know the\n\nfamily and the dynamics (NE 145 line 12 to 15). On the other hand, Dr Kong accepted that\n\nMdm Pang was vulnerable to being unduly influenced by whichever of her sons she happened\n\nto be with. Indeed, that was the very reason why, when he examined her on 26 December 2000\n\nfor the purpose of the application under the Act, he saw her alone with the interpreter\n\n(NE 265 line 14 to 22). He drew support for this conclusion from a visit on 14 October\n\n2000 by Mdm Pang when she was accompanied by the Plaintiffs and Teck Hing’s wife,\n\nAnna. He said that from Mdm Pang’s facial expression, her smile and her wink, he\n\nconcluded that Mdm Pang had recognised him. Yet when Anna asked Mdm Pang whether she\n\nrecognised Dr Kong, there was a slight pause before she answered ‘No’. However,\n\nDr Kong also went on to say that Mdm Pang had a tendency of saying ‘No’ in other\n\ninterviews when she wanted to evade or avoid something (NE 264).",
        "THE LAW": "162.        InR Mahendran &\n\nAnor v R Arumuganathan[1999] 2 SLR 579, Karthigesu JA said:‘15. It is a well settled principle of law stated\n\n    as far back as 1838 by Baron Parke inBarry v Butlin[1838] 2 Moo 480 at 482 and\n\n    484; 12 ER 1089 that the legal burden of propounding a will, the onus probandi lies in\n\n    every case upon the party propounding the will, and he must satisfy the conscience of the\n\n    court that the instrument so propounded is the last will of a free and capable Testator.\n\n    … it is in general discharged by proof of capacity, and the fact of execution, from\n\n    which the knowledge of and assent to the contents of the instrument are assumed. The\n\n    proposition is framed by Theobald on Wills (15thEd) at pp 35 to 38 in these\n\n    terms:Burden of proof.The legal (or persuasive)\n\n      burden of proof always lies upon the person propounding a will to prove that the testator\n\n      knew and approved of its contents at the relevant time. He must ‘satisfy the\n\n      conscience of the court that the instrument so propounded is the last will of a free and\n\n      capable testator’.(a)    Presumption in ordinary\n\n      circumstances. On proof that the testator was of testamentary capacity and that he duly\n\n      executed the will, in ordinary circumstances, a rebuttable presumption arises that he knew\n\n      and approved of its contents at the time of execution. The evidential burden of proof then\n\n      shifts to the person opposing the will to rebut this presumption. If he does so, or if due\n\n      to the particular circumstances the presumption is not applicable, the person propounding\n\n      the will must produce affirmative proof of the testator’s knowledge and approval so\n\n      as to satisfy the legal burden of proof.(b)    …(c)    Suspicious circumstances. If a\n\n      will was prepared and executed under circumstances which raise a well-grounded suspicion\n\n      that the will (or some provision in it, such as the residuary gift) did not express the\n\n      mind of the testator, the will (or that provision) is not admissible to probate unless\n\n      that suspicion is removed by affirmative proof of the testator’s knowledge and\n\n      approval. A classic instance of suspicious circumstances is where the will was prepared by\n\n      a person who takes a substantial benefit under it. Another instance is where a person was\n\n      active in procuring the execution of a will under which he takes a substantial benefit,\n\n      for instance, suggesting the terms of the will to the testator and instructing a solicitor\n\n      chosen by that person.However circumstances can only raise a suspicion of want\n\n      of knowledge and approval if they are ‘circumstances attending, or at least relevant\n\n      to, the preparation and execution of the will itself’.Affirmative proof of knowledge and approval.Affirmative proof of the testator’s knowledge and approval must be strong enough to\n\n      satisfy the court in the particular circumstances. The greater the degree of suspicion,\n\n      the stronger must be the affirmative proof to remove it. The suspicion ‘may be slight\n\n      and easily dispelled. It may … be so grave that it can hardly be removed’.One form of affirmative proof is to establish that the\n\n      will was read over by, or to, the testator when he executed it. … Another form of\n\n      affirmative proof is to establish that the testator gave instructions for his will and\n\n      that the will was drafted in accordance with those instructions.’163.        As for undue influence, I\n\nrefer to the judgment of Justice Goh Joon Seng inPelican Engineering Pte Ltd v Lim Wee\n\nChuan[2001] 1 SLR 105where he said:‘My decision32    On what is ‘undue\n\n    influence’, LP Thean JA inLim Geok Hian v Lim Guan Chin[1994] 1 SLR 203at\n\n    216 stated:Undue influence is the unconscientious use of one’s\n\n      power or authority over another to acquire a benefit or to achieve a purpose.Allcard v\n\n      Skinner(1887) 36 Ch D 145 established that cases of undue influence fall into two\n\n      categories: first, cases where actual influence has been proved to have been exercised,\n\n      and second, cases where, by virtue of a particular relationship between the parties, the\n\n      court presumes that undue influence has been exercised unless the contrary is proved.33     Judith Prakash J inRajabali\n\n    Jumabhoy v Ameerali R Jumabhoy[1997] 3 SLR 802at 855 stated:It is not enough to set aside a contract that one party\n\n      tried to influence the other to enter it. There must be something wrong in the way that\n\n      the influence was exercised, ie some unfair or improper conduct, some coercion or some\n\n      form of misleading.34    On actual undue influence, Judith\n\n    Prakash J in theJumabhoycase at p 855 stated:In order to establish a plea of actual undue influence,\n\n    a plaintiff must show that:(a)         \n\n      the other party to the transaction (or someone who induced the transaction for his own\n\n      benefit) had the capacity to influence the complainant;(b)         that\n\n      the influence is exercised;(c)         that\n\n      its exercise was undue; and(d)         that\n\n      its exercise brought about the transaction.’164.        Justice Goh also said:‘53    On the plaintiffs’ case\n\n    based on presumed undue influence, the dicta of Judith Prakash J in theJumabhoycase at p 854 is instructive:To succeed under the ‘presumed undue\n\n      influence’ category, the following elements need to be proved:(a)     the existence of a\n\n      particular relationship which enabled one party to it to influence the decisions of the\n\n      other;(b)     that the resulting\n\n      transaction was manifestly disadvantageous to the person subject to the influence.Upon proof of the above elements, the burden shifts to\n\n      the defendant to prove that no undue influence had been exercised. The presumption can\n\n      only be rebutted by showing that the ascendant party did not abuse his position and that\n\n      the subservient party understood what he was doing and was in a position to exercise a\n\n      free judgment based on full information.’165.        The Law of Wills by\n\nHardingham Neave Ford states at p 51:‘[311 Undue influence: what is it?The\n\n    essential element of undue influence is, in this context, coercion. Persuasion or\n\n    influence or importunity is not sufficient ….It is worth citing two passages by way of judicial\n\n    explanation of the meaning of the concept of undue influence, the first from Sir J.P.\n\n    Wilde’s direction to the jury inHall v. Hall, the second from Sir J.\n\n    Hannen’s charge to the jury inWingrove v. Wingrove:To make a good will a man must be a free agent. But all\n\n      influences are not unlawful. Persuasion, appeals to the affections or ties of kindred, to\n\n      a sentiment of gratitude for past services, or pity for future destitution, or the like, -\n\n      these are all legitimate, and may be fairly pressed on a testator. On the other hand,\n\n      pressure of whatever character, whether acting on the fears or hopes, if so exerted as to\n\n      overpower the volition without convincing the judgment, is a species of restraint under\n\n      which no valid will can be made. Importunity or threats, such as the testator has not the\n\n      courage to resist, moral command asserted and yielded to for the sake of peace and quiet,\n\n      or of escaping from distress of mind or social discomfort, these, if carried to a degree\n\n      in which the free play of the testator’s judgment, discretion or wishes, is\n\n      overborne, will constitute undue influence, though no force is either used or threatened.\n\n      In a word, a testator may be led but not driven; and his will must be the offspring of his\n\n      own volition, and not the record of someone else’s.[I]t is not because one person has unbounded influence\n\n      over another that therefore when exercised, even though it may be very bad indeed, it is\n\n      undue influence in the legal sense of the word. …’166.        For undue influence, Mr\n\nJohn relied in particular on the case ofHooi Cheng Kwang & Anor v Hooi Paul[1981] 2 MLJ 306which Mr John submitted was a case with similar facts to the present case.\n\nThere, Choor Singh J held that the mere relationship of mother and son and the fact that\n\nthe two were living together was in itself not enough to raise the presumption of undue\n\ninfluence. Choor Singh J also held that independent legal advice is not essential to rebut\n\nthe presumption of undue influence. What was necessary was to establish affirmatively that\n\nthe gift was the ‘free and intelligent’ act of the donor. In that case, the\n\nclaim based on undue influence failed.167.        Mr Prabhakaran Nair,\n\nCounsel for the Plaintiffs, did not dispute the legal principles enunciated by Choor Singh\n\nJ. However, he pointed out that the facts in that case were different from those before\n\nme. For example, the donor herself gave evidence and her own solicitor had discussed the\n\ngifts in question with her. In my view, certain features of that case should be borne in\n\nmind.168.        There, the donor was one\n\nMdm Ng Swee Kee. She had four sons:a)    Hooi Cheng\n\n  Loonb)    Michael\n\n  Hooi Cheng Kwangc)    Paul Hooi\n\n  Cheng Cheongd)    Philip Hui\n\n  Cheng Keong169.        She had on two occasions\n\nmade gifts of shares in Yip Beng (Pte) Ltd and in Yip Beng (HK) Ltd to Paul and Philip in\n\nequal parts. Subsequently, she sought to set aside the gift of the shares to Paul, but not\n\nto Philip, on the ground of undue influence.170.        She herself gave evidence\n\nat trial although she passed away before the hearing was concluded. The trial judge\n\ndescribed her as follows:‘Although the deceased was 82 years old and not\n\n    educated, she did not betray any sign of mental weakness. She impressed me as an\n\n    intelligent, astute and strong-willed woman.’ (see p 314 at B).171.        Mdm Ng had been asked to\n\nundergo an examination by a psychiatrist, not a neurologist, before the gifts were\n\neffected. The psychiatrist was Dr Paul Ngui. He had examined her and certified that she\n\nwas of sound mind.172.        Apparently, her own\n\nphysician, one Mr Wong, who had treated her for some six years described her as\n\n‘… a very independent and determined woman’ (see p 314 at C).173.        Her own solicitor Mr C S\n\nWu pointed out that ‘the deceased was despite her age a strong-willed person’\n\n(see p 314 at D).174.        I am of the view that\n\neven though these descriptions may apply to Mdm Pang before her first stroke, they did not\n\napply thereafter.175.        Furthermore, in the case\n\nofHooi Cheng Kwang, the evidence of Mr C S Wu demonstrated, and the trial judge so\n\nfound, that he had discussed the gifts directly with the deceased and was careful in his\n\nexplanations to her even though Mr Wu was also acting for Paul and Philip. Indeed, Mr Wu\n\nwas not only careful but alert to the fact that the gifts might be challenged. His\n\nevidence on one of the occasions when he met up with Mdm Ng was:‘Plaintiff did not appear to be frightened. There\n\n    was no reason for her to be afraid. She did not show any reluctance. If she showed the\n\n    slightest hint of reluctant I certainly would have wanted to clear up the reason for her\n\n    reluctance before obtaining her signature on the documents. In each of these instances\n\n    when I witnessed her signing of these gift documents, I made a special effort to ensure\n\n    that each transaction was properly executed in every respect and that every gift reflected\n\n    the plaintiff’s personal intention, as I fully expected that Michael and Cheng Loon\n\n    might after her death decide to challenge these gifts bearing in mind the strains that\n\n    existed amongst the brothers. What I never expected was that the plaintiff herself would\n\n    repudiate these gifts. That I never expected …’ (see p 309 at H)176.        Also, in that case, the\n\ngifts were to two of the four children in equal parts. In the case before me, the two\n\nWills and other transactions were in favour of Pian Meng only (except for two nominal\n\ngifts of $10 to each of the other two sons).177.        In addition, the\n\nrelationship between Mdm Pang and Pian Meng was not just one of mother and son. Mdm Pang\n\nrelied quite heavily on Pian Meng as regards affairs of the Business.",
        "MY CONCLUSION": "The first Will178.        I accept Dr PN\n\nChong’s evidence that the ischaemia in the peri-ventricular matter was not the main\n\nproblem in Mdm Pang’s case. As regards the question whether her cognitive ability was\n\naffected or not by the first stroke, one aspect was clear to me. She was confused from\n\ntime to time.179.        It is common ground\n\nbetween all the three doctors that Mdm Pang had episodes of confusion and of lucidity. For\n\nexample, on 17 and 18 August 1997, her condition was poor (see para 96 above). Yet on 19\n\nAugust 1997, when she first saw Dr PN Chong, her condition had improved (see para 97\n\nabove).180.        I accept Dr PN\n\nChong’s evidence, which was also accepted by Dr Ngui, that on 21 October 1997 when he\n\nexamined her, he found Mdm Pang to ‘be rational, conscious, alert, orientated as to\n\ntime, space and person’.181.        I also accept his\n\nevidence that it was unlikely that her condition had changed dramatically on 22 October\n\n1997. If it had, this would have been reflected in her conduct which would then have been\n\nnoticed by Mr Caines or the interpreter. Neither of them noticed anything unusual.182.        However, while the mental\n\ncondition of a testator on the day of execution of the Will is important, the\n\ndetermination of that mental condition on that day should not be confined to what was\n\nperceived on that day only.183.        It was possible that Mdm\n\nPang did not have her full mental faculties on 21 and 22 October 1997 but that this was\n\nnot obvious even to Dr PN Chong. As I have mentioned in para 116 above, he accepted that\n\nhe would not have noticed subtle damage.184.        Secondly, Dr PN Chong\n\nhimself had emphasized that he was looking at Mdm Pang as a neurologist and not as a\n\npsychiatrist. He accepted that an assessment by a psychologist was necessary (NE 141). He\n\nalso said that his examination was ‘elementary’ and he accepted that, for the\n\npurpose of litigation, the opinion of a psychiatrist, was preferable. At NE 144 and 145 he\n\nsaid:‘Ct to\n\n    DW1         Earlier you had said that you referred\n\n    her to Douglas Kong for a full psychiatric assessment because of dispute about a Will\n\n    among family members. Since you had already issued 2 certificates, why was there a need to\n\n    refer her to Dr Kong?DW1                  \n\n    Because I knew that today would come.Ct to\n\n    DW1          Please elaborate.DW1                 \n\n    It would be good to get another assessment besides mine. I am willing to be shown to be\n\n    wrong. I am not afraid of that.Ct to\n\n    DW1         Why did you refer her to a\n\n    psychiatrist, instead of another neurologist?DW1                 \n\n    If I need another neuro-psychologist’s assessment, I would have to go through a\n\n    psychiatrist.  Another neurologist’s assessment would not help because I know\n\n    someone like the Plaintiffs would come up with someone like Dr Ngui who would do a\n\n    detailed assessment. Therefore to be balanced I would want another\n\n    neuro-psychiatrist’s assessment. The first would be Dr Ngui’s and his\n\n    team.  Mine is an elementary one.’185.        I also take into account\n\nthe circumstances leading to the execution of the Will.186.        First, even though Pian\n\nMeng was the most capable of the three sons and Teck Khong had a violent temper, the\n\nBusiness had been used to pay the three sons their salaries and bonuses and various\n\nexpenses and debts of theirs before the first stroke. The benefits were not restricted to\n\nPian Meng.187.        Secondly, there was no\n\nsuggestion, before the first stroke, that Mdm Pang wanted to hand over the business to\n\nPian Meng, save for one qualification i.e that according to Pian Meng, Mdm Pang had\n\ndecided in mid-1997, before the first stroke, to transfer the Business and her properties\n\nto him and it was Mr Caines’ secretary, Ms Tan, who advised against the transfer to\n\nsave on stamp duty.188.        I find it questionable\n\nthat Ms Tan would be prepared to give advice to strangers on their first visit without any\n\nprior instruction from Mr Caines. I say that Mdm Pang and Pian Meng were strangers to her\n\nduring the alleged visit because Pian Meng’s own evidence was that on that occasion,\n\nthey spoke to a lady who introduced herself as Ms Tan (NE 149 line 9/10).189.        Also, I find it\n\nquestionable that, if she did give the alleged advice, Pian Meng did not check Ms\n\nTan’s alleged advice with Mr Caines or even mention it to Mr Caines at all.190.        Furthermore, as I have\n\nsaid, Ms Tan did not give evidence. I do not accept Pian Meng’s explanation that she\n\nwas no longer working for Mr Caines (NE 163) as a sufficient reason to explain her\n\nabsence. Attempts should have been to contact her but there was no evidence that such\n\nattempts had been made.191.        Neither was Mr Caines\n\nasked to corroborate that Ms Tan had the competence to give the alleged advice about stamp\n\nduty.192.        I draw an adverse\n\ninference against Pian Meng from the omission to call Ms Tan as a witness and the omission\n\nto seek corroboration from Mr Caines about Ms Tan’s experience.193.        I am also of the view\n\nthat Pian Meng’s allegation about Ms Tan’s advice was contradicted by subsequent\n\nevents. If the intention in mid-1997 was to avoid stamp duty and hence the first Will was\n\nmade, why did Mdm Pang purportedly want to transfer 64/64A SGW subsequently in late 1999\n\nto Pian Meng? If Pian Meng wanted to borrow monies from KTL, Mdm Pang could have easily\n\nbeen the guarantor and executed a mortgage of 64/64A SGW, but that was not the initial\n\nplan then. The fact that Pian Meng’s initial plan in late 1999 was to have 64/64A SGW\n\ntransferred to him belies his evidence about trying to save stamp duty in mid-1997.194.        Mr John was initially not\n\nable to give a reason in response to this point during closing reply submissions. He then\n\nventured to say that at that time, in 1999, the Business was not doing well. The\n\nsuggestion was that the Business needed to borrow more money. In my view, there was still\n\nno reason to transfer 64/64A SGW to Pian Meng even if the Business needed more money.\n\nIndeed, it was illogical to incur stamp duty when it could be avoided.195.        After a lunch-break, Mr\n\nJohn said he had been instructed that since, by 3 November 1999, 30 MD had been sold, Mdm\n\nPang was prepared to incur the stamp duty on only one property i.e 64/64A SGW.196.        I do not accept this\n\nexplanation for various reasons:(a)    it was evidence from the bar,\n\n    which Mr John acknowledged,(b)    it still did not address the point\n\n    that the alleged original intention was to avoid paying any stamp duty, whether for one\n\n    property, or two. In mid 1997, before the first stroke, Mdm Pang could and would have\n\n    given instructions to transfer 64/64A SGW to Pian Meng, if that was really her intention\n\n    then.197.        Thirdly, I do not accept\n\nPian Meng’s oral evidence as to how Mr Caines came to be instructed to prepare the\n\nfirst Will. I also do not accept that this was a case of minor differences in testimony\n\nwhich are explainable on account of the events occurring some four or five years ago. I\n\nhave taken into account the fact that the events occurred some time ago and ignored minor\n\ncontradictions. However, I note that Pian Meng had confirmed that he had read Mr\n\nCaines’ AEIC before it was filed (NE 162). He could and should have met up with Mr\n\nCaines to try and ascertain whose recollection was correct. Even if that was not possible,\n\nhe could and should have stated in his own AEIC that part of Mr Caines’ AEIC was\n\nincorrect. He did not. Furthermore, as I have said, Mr John did not even ask Mr Caines\n\nwhether he had made mistakes in his AEIC or take him through what Pian Meng had said in\n\noral testimony in so far as it was different from what Mr Caines had said.198.        It seems to me that Pian\n\nMeng must have taken the view, subsequently, that Mr Caines’ evidence would put his\n\ncase in a bad light and so he belatedly gave a different version. Pian Meng had also\n\nchosen to refer more to Ms Tan in his oral testimony because he knew she was not being\n\ncalled as a witness.199.        Fourthly, I reiterate\n\nthat Mr Caines had said that he was acting on Pian Meng’s instructions only.200.        Fifthly, I note that Pian\n\nMeng appeared to be in a rush to get the first Will done. If Mdm Pang’s intention had\n\nbeen to transfer her properties and the Business to him and if she was as consistently\n\nmentally fit as Pian Meng wanted me to believe, then there would have been no need to make\n\na sudden visit on 21 October 1997 to see Dr PN Chong to obtain the certificate. After all,\n\nMdm Pang was seeing Dr PN Chong from time to time and Pian Meng could have obtained the\n\ncertificate on the earlier visit on 15 September 1997 or later in the next scheduled visit\n\nafter 21 October 1997.201.        Sixthly, it was Pian Meng\n\nwho informed Dr PN Chong on 21 October 1997 that Mdm Pang wanted to make a Will. It was\n\nalso Pian Meng who informed Dr PN Chong on 8 December 1997 that problems with the Will had\n\nbeen sorted out.202.        I am of the view that the\n\nidea of Mdm Pang making her Will came to Pian Meng after Mdm Pang’s first stroke. As\n\nshe was enfeebled, he was able to persuade her to act according to his intentions,\n\nespecially since she was used to relying on his help in running the business. However, he\n\nhad to wait until her condition improved to an extent which would make her appear normal\n\nto an unsuspecting mind. In the period before 22 October 1997, her condition did improve\n\nand he then began to contact and later meet up with Mr Caines first. Thereafter, on Mr\n\nCaines’ advice, he obtained the certificate from Dr PN Chong and presented it to Mr\n\nCaines. To Mr Caines and the interpreter Loh Lim, Mdm Pang appeared normal. They had\n\nassumed that because she appeared normal, she had her full mental faculties about her.203.        It did not occur to Mr\n\nCaines to ascertain for himself Mdm Pang’s wishes, even though he could have done so\n\nwith the help of Loh Lim and without the presence of Pian Meng. This was because Mr Caines\n\nhad relied on the certificate from Dr PN Chong. By the time the interpreter arrived, Mr\n\nCaines was not seeking to verify for himself the mental condition of Mdm Pang but to\n\ncomplete the transaction i.e the execution of the first Will.204.        As for Loh Lim, his job\n\nwas simply to interpret and Mdm Pang appeared to understand what she was doing.",
        "The transfer of the Business": "205.        After the first Will was\n\nsigned, Pian Meng then obtained Mdm Pang’s execution to the necessary documents to\n\ntransfer the Business to him.206.        However, I am of the view\n\nthat if Mdm Pang had intended to transfer the Business to Pian Meng absolutely, she would\n\nhave notified the Plaintiffs that Pian Meng had become the owner and the boss of the\n\nBusiness and that they were to comply with his instructions. While Pian Meng alleged that\n\nMdm Pang was fed up with Teck Khong and Teck Khong had a violent temper, Mdm Pang was\n\nstill running the Business before the first stroke. There was also no suggestion of her\n\nbeing fed up or afraid of Teck Hing. Furthermore, life went on as usual with the salaries\n\nand bonuses of Teck Khong and Teck Hing, as well as some of their expenses and debts,\n\nbeing paid for.207.        I have considered whether\n\nPian Meng continued to take care of his siblings out of the goodness of his heart but the\n\npoint still is that Mdm Pang had not told either of the other two that he had become the\n\nboss of the Business.208.        I have also considered\n\nwhether Mdm Pang might have transferred the Business to Pian Meng on the condition that he\n\nwas to continue to take care of his siblings. However, that was not Pian Meng’s case.\n\nHis case was that the transfer to him was absolute.209.        I also note from Dr\n\nKong’s examination of Mdm Pang that she had indicated that she wanted to transfer the\n\nBusiness to Pian Meng. However by then i.e 26 December 2000, the Business had already been\n\ntransferred to Pian Meng, in November 1997.210.        Accordingly, I find that\n\neven if Mdm Pang had had the mental capacity to execute the first Will and the documents\n\nto transfer the Business to Pian Meng, she was so enfeebled that she was vulnerable to\n\nundue influence from any of her sons, especially Pian Meng who had been assisting her the\n\nmost in the Business. It was not disputed that he had the capacity to influence Mdm Pang\n\nin respect of her first Will and the transfer of the Business to him. I find that he did\n\nexercise influence on her and that the exercise brought about the execution of her first\n\nWill and the transfer of the Business to him. The real issue, however, was whether the\n\ninfluence he had exercised was undue. I find that it was.",
        "The sale of 30 MD and the use of the net sale proceeds": "211.        As for the sale of 30 MD\n\naround 26 May 1998, Mdm Pang was still in an enfeebled state of mind alternating between\n\nlucidity and confusion. It was Pian Meng who unduly influenced her to sell 30 MD then.\n\nThis may have been because the property market was declining but I am of the view that he\n\nwanted or needed more money then.212.        That is why when the sale\n\nwas completed on 31 August 1998, the net sale proceeds were deposited into a joint\n\naccount. By then, her condition had not improved significantly. On the contrary, she had\n\nhad a severe fall in August 1998 which resulted in a haematoma. Although this had been\n\nresolved when another scan was done on 5 October 1998, her condition remained poor. As Dr\n\nKong noted on 16 October 1998, she was disoriented as to time and place. Cognitive tests\n\nwere impaired because she could not complete them. He prescribed Melleril and Fluanxol to\n\nclear her confused state of mind. Even the information provided by Pian Meng to Dr Kong\n\nwas that she could not sleep, she talked nonsense and was excited during the day (see\n\nparas 110 and 111 above).213.        However the medication\n\ntook a toll on her and made her weak. That is why Pian Meng told Dr Kong on 3 February\n\n1999 that he had to stop the medication for her (see para 112, and also 113 above).214.        I do not accept Pian\n\nMeng’s explanation that the joint account was to effect payment of property tax on\n\n64/64A SGW (NE 182). There was no previous problem about paying the property tax and if\n\nthe intention was to effect payment from Mdm Pang’s bank account, she had her own\n\nsole bank accounts to give effect to that intention. Furthermore, soon after the\n\ncompletion of the sale, the sale proceeds were withdrawn, not to pay property tax, but to\n\nbe deposited into fixed deposits and into the UOB ‘i’ account in Pian\n\nMeng’s sole name.215.        I am of the view that the\n\npurpose of the joint account was to enable Pian Meng to withdraw the sale proceeds at\n\nwill, contrary to his mother’s intention. Pian Meng had considered the monies to\n\nbelong to him because his mother’s intention was to use the monies to buy another\n\nproperty to be registered in his name and for his family to stay in, even though Teck\n\nKhong and Mdm Pang were supposed to stay in the other property too.",
        "The mortgage of 64/64A SGW and the second Will": "216.        In the first half of\n\n1999, Mdm Pang’s condition did not improve. Indeed it deteriorated. As Dr PN Chong\n\nsaid, ‘This was a bad patch’ (see para 114 above).217.        On 30 August 1999, he saw\n\nher again and wrote ‘deteriorate’ with an exclamation mark. That is when he\n\nrepeated a scan and discovered she had suffered a second stroke in August 1999.218.        However, notwithstanding\n\nDr Ngui’s skepticism as to her condition about two months later on 3 November 1999, I\n\naccept Dr PN Chong’s evidence that when he examined her on that day, she appeared to\n\nbe in full command of her mental faculties. There was no reason for him to lie and, as I\n\nhave said above in the context of the first Will, if Mdm Pang’s condition had been as\n\nbad on that day as the Plaintiffs wanted me to accept, this would have been reflected in\n\nher conduct. This would in turn have been noticed by Ms Yap and the interpreter.219.        On the other hand, I\n\nprefer Dr Ngui’s evidence that with the second stroke, there was cumulative damage to\n\nMdm Pang’s mental condition. I note that Dr PN Chong had also said that it was Pian\n\nMeng who informed him about the need to get a second certificate (NE 136 to NE 137) and he\n\ndid not check with Mdm Pang on this request (NE 139).220.        Furthermore, Dr PN Chong\n\nhad also described his examination of Mdm Pang on 3 November 1999 as routine (NE 139) and\n\nelementary (NE 145). I reiterate that in his own view, the opinion for a psychiatrist,\n\nsupported by an assessment by a clinical psychologist, was preferable.221.        As for Dr Kong, I have\n\nmentioned that he disagreed with Dr Ngui’s opinion regarding Mdm Pang’s mental\n\ncapacity on 3 November 1999 only to the limited extent that Dr Kong was of the opinion\n\nthat Mdm Pang could sign a simple Will but he did not say she could fully understand the\n\nmortgage and the consequence of mortgaging 64/64A SGW for a credit facility for Pian Meng.222.        Mr John drew my attention\n\nto an apparent contradiction by Dr Ngui. In his case notes of the examination on 22 March\n\n2000, Dr Ngui had said that Mdm Pang knew the extent of her estate and her potential\n\nbeneficiaries (see para 141 above). However, in Dr Ngui’s report dated 13 April 2000,\n\nafter the assessment by Mr Choo had been completed, Dr Ngui said that Mdm Pang was unable\n\nto describe the extent of her personal estate (see para 9 of his report which is cited in\n\npara 144 above). However, Mr John did not cross-examine Dr Ngui on this contradiction. He\n\nsaid that the case-notes were made available in re-examination only and because Dr PN\n\nChong was waiting to give evidence, he did not at that time notice the contradiction and\n\nso had not applied to cross-examine Dr Ngui on it. He only noticed the contradiction at\n\nsubmission stage.223.        I would add that Mr John\n\ndid not suggest that Dr Ngui was deliberately misleading the court. Indeed, Mr John\n\nconceded that Dr Ngui had been ‘extremely helpful and balanced in all his answers. He\n\nis therefore a competent professional and we do not seek to criticise his competence or\n\nintegrity in any way’ (para 79 of his written submission).224.        However, notwithstanding\n\nthat concession, Mr John further submitted that when Dr Ngui changed his provisional\n\ndiagnosis, it was not so much because of Mr Choo’s assessment, but because of further\n\nadverse information given to Dr Ngui on 29 March 2000 (which I have cited in para 143\n\nabove) and because of Dr Ngui’s obvious sympathy for Mdm Pang. Mr John sought to\n\nsupport his argument on the basis that Mr Choo’s assessment did not purport to have\n\nretrospective effect. Also it had a general assessment that Mdm Pang was unlikely to be\n\nable to take care of herself and manage her own affairs. This was not specific to the\n\ndocuments in question.225.        However, it must be borne\n\nin mind that Dr Ngui’s opinion, and Mr Choo’s assessment, were sought initially\n\nfor the application to appoint a Committee for Mdm Pang. The question was whether Dr Ngui\n\nwas prepared to apply whatever he had observed retrospectively and in the context of the\n\ndocuments in question. He was. Likewise, although Dr Kong had examined Mdm Pang earlier,\n\nhis detailed examination, and Mr Yam’s assessment, was after the event. Yet his\n\nexamination was being used by Pian Meng to apply retrospectively as well.226.        Also, again Mr John did\n\nnot cross-examine Dr Ngui as to whether he had revised his diagnosis for reasons other\n\nthan Mr Choo’s assessment.227.        Furthermore, I note that\n\nAnna had already given adverse information about Mdm Pang’s condition on 22 March\n\n2000 and, at that time, Dr Ngui was not minded to conclude that Mdm Pang failed to have\n\ntestamentary capacity.228.        Having considered the\n\nreports of Dr Kong and Dr Ngui, and the oral evidence given by each, I find Dr Ngui to be\n\nmore objective. Dr Ngui knew that the Plaintiffs wanted him to conclude that Mdm Pang did\n\nnot have any testamentary capacity but yet his provisional diagnosis was that she did have\n\nsuch a capacity. It was only after the assessment by the clinical psychologist that he\n\nchanged his provisional diagnosis.229.        On the other hand, Dr\n\nKong appeared to place no or little weight on the assessment by his clinical psychologist.230.        Secondly, Dr Kong was\n\nengaged by Pian Meng to resist the application for a Committee of Mdm Pang to be\n\nappointed. Yet, when the crunch came, he was prepared to concede on her mental condition\n\nafter the short interview I had had with her in his presence and that of Dr Ngui, as well\n\nas the respective Counsel (see paras 89 and 90 above).231.        Thirdly, when I asked Dr\n\nKong during the trial whether he had thought a Committee should have been appointed at\n\nthat time, he said, at NE 270:‘Ct to DW5    Are you aware that\n\n    there was an application in OS 924 of 2000 under the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act\n\n    for a committee to be appointed in respect of Mdm Pang?DW5              \n\n    Yes.Ct to DW5      Your help was\n\n    sought by Defendant in respect of that application?DW5              \n\n    Yes.Ct to DW5      What was your\n\n    opinion then in respect of the application i.e did you think a committee should have been\n\n    appointed under the Act?DW5              \n\n    I am unfamiliar with law and cannot give opinion on law. As a medical doctor, the\n\n    confusion if treated with adequate rest, proper nutrition and medical treatment, Mdm Pang\n\n    would come out of the confusion. People like Mdm Pang require supervision. My personal\n\n    view, and not a medical opinion, is that as long as she is supervised as to diet, rest,\n\n    exercise and with medical treatment for her various conditions, Mdm Pang could maintain\n\n    very well like other elderly patients. A committee should be required if there was severe\n\n    dementia. Dementia in distinction to confusion is persistent and permanent and in spite of\n\n    all the measures, like rest and treatment etc, she would still not be able to be\n\n    lucid.’232.        I find this evidence\n\nevasive. The question as to whether a Committee should be appointed was not only or\n\nprimarily a legal one. Secondly, he was engaged then to give his professional opinion. I\n\nfind his attempt to draw a distinction between his personal and his professional opinion\n\nto reflect his lack of conviction in his own views.233.        His next response, at NE\n\n271, was startling:‘Ct to DW5     Should a\n\n    committee have been appointed in respect of Mdm Pang?DW5              \n\n    Because she is in a state of confusion and I can’t tell, my personal opinion is to\n\n    clear the confusion with the measures I have mentioned and if it clears, a committee is\n\n    not necessary. Confusion can be brought on by infection, stress including lack of sleep,\n\n    lack of nutrients like oxygen, and any organ failure like heart of liver failure. Any\n\n    toxic substance like alcohol can give rise to confusion.234.        If there was a\n\npossibility that Mdm Pang’s confusion could clear with the proper treatment and care,\n\nit was incumbent on Dr Kong to venture this opinion on 22 January 2001 before I had made\n\nthe order to appoint a Committee. He did not. Instead, at that time, he conceded that a\n\nCommittee should be appointed. Furthermore, there was no qualification in the concession.235.        I also take into account\n\nMdm Pang’s poor scores in the assessment by each of the psychologists. Mdm Pang also\n\ngave different responses to Dr Kong and to Dr Ngui. I reiterate how she gave different\n\nanswers as to who she would give the Business and 64/64A SGW to (see para 142 above).236.        As for Ms Yap, I am of\n\nthe view that although Ms Yap spoke to Mdm Pang a few times when Pian Meng and Mdm Pang\n\ncame to Ms Yap’s office, it did not occur to Ms Yap to ascertain for herself whether\n\nMdm Pang was acting of her own free will and mind. I do not accept Mr John’s\n\nsubmission that there was nothing to alert Ms Yap to the possibility that Mdm Pang was not\n\nof sound mind or that she might be acting under undue influence. She had learned that Mdm\n\nPang had had two strokes and Pian Meng had other siblings who were not going to get\n\nanything under Mdm Pang’s Will. That is why Ms Yap herself suggested a nominal $10\n\ngift to each of the other two sons.237.        In my view, Ms Yap’s\n\nattention was initially more occupied with the question whether KTL would take a mortgage\n\nif the title was derived from a gift. Even in court, she said at NE 236:‘Ct to DW4 [Ms Yap]     Do you\n\n    know what today’s case is about?DW4                              \n\n    Defendant wanted to take a loan on a property which the mother wanted to give to him. So I\n\n    advised them in order to take a mortgage on the property, you have to purchase it from the\n\n    mother. Defendant said the purchase price is $2 million. I asked the bank what is your\n\n    valuation. He told me about $2.2 million. So I told the mother the purchase price is $2\n\n    million. Are you agreeable to this price. She said \"Yes\". After all I want to\n\n    give him this property. So I said after he has paid you this money, you can eventually\n\n    give it to him. She said \"OK\".’238.        As for the Sale &\n\nPurchase Agreement for 64/64A SGW, it is true that Ms Yap required Pian Meng to put up the\n\ninitial $200,000 deposit instead of getting Mdm Pang to issue a receipt for it, without\n\nactually receiving payment. On the other hand, she admitted that because the intended\n\ntransfer was from mother to son, she had used the simplest form without explaining to Mdm\n\nPang that under its terms she was to ensure that 64/64A SGW was delivered with vacant\n\npossession.239.        I am of the view that the\n\nidea of getting the second doctor’s certificate came to Ms Yap’s mind only\n\nbecause Pian Meng had told her of the earlier doctor’s certificate. She then\n\nsuggested that a second certificate be obtained. It seems to me that after she had seen\n\nthe second certificate, she did not consider it necessary to have a more careful\n\ndiscussion with Mdm Pang with the aid of the interpreter, which, preferably, should not be\n\nin the presence of Pian Meng.240.        Having considered her\n\nevidence in its entirety, I am of the view that she did not demonstrate the kind of\n\ncaution that Mr C S Wu did in the case ofHooi Cheng Kwang.241.        Furthermore, although Ms\n\nYap did meet with and speak to Mdm Pang on a few occasions, it was Pian Meng who was in\n\nthe driver’s seat. He was the one:(a)    who contacted KTL about a loan,(b)    who contacted Ms Yap on the phone\n\n    about the initial plan to transfer,(c)    who suggested the sale price of\n\n    $2m,(d)    who said he wanted to proceed with\n\n    a mortgage instead of a sale,(e)    who informed Ms Yap that a second\n\n    Will should be made because one of Mdm Pang’s properties had been sold.I am of the view that he was not just carrying out Mdm\n\nPang’s instructions, as he had professed to do.242.        As for Loh Lim, I am\n\nagain of the view that as he was not told about both of Mdm Pang’s strokes, and as\n\nshe appeared normal to him, it did not occur to him to be more discerning or careful in\n\nhis interpretation of the documents on 3 November 1999 to her. Also, Mdm Pang was probably\n\nrequired to give simple responses only to indicate that she understood.243.        In my view, when Mdm Pang\n\nappeared jovial or cheerful or gave simple responses, there was a tendency to assume that\n\nshe was of full sound mind and was acting entirely of her own volition. However, as\n\nillustrated in Dr Ngui’s case notes of 10 January 2001, even though she was cheerful,\n\nshe obviously was not of full sound mind (see the case notes as cited in para 145 above).244.        I have also considered\n\nPian Meng’s explanation for the loan from KTL. He had said that the intention was\n\nthat after paying off the loan from KPB, the balance of the loan from KTL was to renovate\n\n64 SGW as required by NTUC Fairprice in the intended lease of 64 SGW.245.        However, if the balance\n\nwas to be used solely for renovation of 64 SGW, there was no reason for Pian Meng to be\n\nthe borrower under the initial plan in 1999. Mdm Pang could and should have been the\n\nborrower since the property was hers and Pian Meng could have been the guarantor, as was\n\nthe case for the loan from KPB. However, Pian Meng’s initial intention then was that\n\nhe was to be the borrower because he had his own ideas as to what to do with the balance\n\nof the loan.246.        Furthermore, the lease to\n\nNTUC Fairprice fell through and the renovation work was not done. Yet Pian Meng proceeded\n\nto obtain the loan from KTL for a larger sum than was needed to pay KPB.247.        I am also of the view\n\nthat as the Sale & Purchase of 64/64A SGW from Mdm Pang to Pian Meng could not go\n\nthrough (because he could not raise the $200,000 deposit), he wanted to make sure that\n\n64/64A SGW was specifically bequeathed to him under a second Will to make sure that there\n\nwas no dispute about the use of the monies from the KTL loan. He suggested the second Will\n\nto Ms Yap for this reason and not because one of the properties of Mdm Pang had been sold,\n\nas he had alleged.248.        Having considered the\n\nevidence, I find that even if Mdm Pang did have the mental capacity as at 3 November 1999\n\nto execute the mortgage and her second Will, she was unduly influenced by Pian Meng to do\n\nso.249.        I will hear parties on\n\nthe orders to be made in view of my findings and in particular the question of whether and\n\nto what extent Pian Meng is to provide an accounting of the sale proceeds of 30 MD and the\n\nloan from KTL. I will also hear parties on costs.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERSINGAPORECopyright © Government of Singapore."
