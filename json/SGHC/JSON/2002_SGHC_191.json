        "The Facts": "2      The three main\n\ncharacters in this case – the appellant, the victim, and the fifth prosecution\n\nwitness, Lim Ong Kim (Lim) – all knew each other. On the night of 28 November 2001,\n\nthe victim (Nicholas), Lim, and a few others were drinking at a coffee shop at Block 412\n\nBedok North Street 3 when four persons came to the coffee shop. One of them pointed to the\n\naccused and challenged him to a one on one fight. The appellant (Shamsul) was reluctant to\n\ntake up the offer of a fight, but nonetheless went out of the coffee shop where a quarrel\n\nbegan. This soon developed into a fight. The appellant called for Nicholas and Lim to help\n\nhim, but the latter two did not get involved. According to Lim, the fight was an\n\n‘inside matter’ and since neither Lim nor Nicholas had anything to do with the\n\nreason behind the brawl, they left after finishing their drinks. Lim and Nicholas departed\n\nwhilst the brawl was still in progress. As a consequence, the appellant suffered the worse\n\nfor it, and was resentful of the fact that the two did not aid him in his hour of need.3\n\n        On the evening of 4 December 2001, Lim and\n\nNicholas went to Bedok Interchange to have a few drinks. At about 1 am the appellant rang\n\nLim on his hand phone and asked to speak with Nicholas.4\n\n        The conversation over the phone consisted of a\n\nheated quarrel which stemmed from the appellant’s dissatisfaction that Nicholas did\n\nnot help him when he (the appellant) was trying to fend off an attack on 28 November 2001.\n\nBoth Lim and Nicholas went to the appellant’s place by taxi. Lim waited downstairs\n\nsince he did not have anything to do with this matter between Nicholas and the appellant.\n\nNicholas made his way up the staircase, and when he reached the appellant’s unit on\n\nthe third floor, he found the door wide open. The metal gate was closed but the wooden\n\ndoor was open. He saw the appellant in the kitchen and decided to open the metal gate to\n\nenter the flat. This he did. When motioning through the living room on the way to the\n\nkitchen, four males pounced on him, and very quickly began to hit him. Nicholas was sure\n\nhe was being beaten with poles. At least two of the four men carried poles. He knew this\n\nbecause these two men were directly in front of him. Nicholas did not see these four men\n\nwhen he entered the unit, and expressed that they must have been waiting for him in the\n\ntwo rooms next to the living room.5\n\n        Thus, an ambush was carried out on Nicholas by\n\nfour men. The appellant was stationed in the kitchen. Including the appellant, there were\n\nfive in total.6\n\n        In the scuffle, Nicholas tried to protect his\n\nhead from the blows by raising his hands in front of his head in a defensive fashion. He\n\nwas continually beaten by poles until he felt a heavy whack on his head. This was the last\n\nthing he remembered of the scuffle. His next conscious moment was in hospital.7\n\n        The victim suffered ‘fracture of the\n\nfacial bones and fracture on the skull following the sagital suture’. The victim also\n\nsuffered ‘a deep 5cm laceration on the vertex of his head with bone seen underlying\n\nthe wound.’ The victim was warded in hospital for 11 days.",
        "The decision below and the appeal": "8\n\n        The appellant contends that the District Judge\n\noverlooked or misconstrued a total of eight matters in coming to her findings. It is apt\n\nhere to re-visit the principles governing this Court in the sphere of appellate\n\nintervention. In the case ofYap Giau Beng Terence v PP[1998] 3 SLR 656this Court\n\nruled:It is trite law that an appellate court\n\n  should be slow to overturn the trial judge’s findings of fact, especially where they\n\n  hinge on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witness,\n\n  unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidenceThis principle has been articulated inLim\n\nAh Poh v PP[1992] 1SLR 713 at 719,Teo Keng Pong v PP[1996] 3 SLR 329at 342,Ng Soo Hin v PP[1994] 1 SLR 105,Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP[1997] 3 SLR 464. The standard required of the District Judge’s scrutiny of the evidence and\n\nthe witnesses before him is an extremely demanding one, as emphasised by this Court in the\n\ncase ofKwan Peng Hong v Public Prosecutor[2000] 4 SLR 96. Without such a strict\n\ntest at the trial stage, it would be a nonsense to have a principle such as that expressed\n\ninYap Giau Beng Terrance. Quite to the contrary, the two cases have a similar aim\n\n– a strict standard at the trial stage, which once met, should signal the appellate\n\ncourt not to intervene unless, of course, something is seen to be plainly wrong. It is\n\nprecisely because the trial judge is under such a strict standard that once it is reached,\n\nthe appellate court tends not to interfere. One of the reasons for the inclination not to\n\ninterfere is the fact that the appellate court does not have the advantage of observing\n\nthe demeanour and behaviour of the witnesses. The appellant refers to the case ofKwan\n\nPeng Hong. They are correct to. But the trial judge has matched the standard required,\n\nas laid down in that case by this Court.9\n\n        I turn to the matters which the appellant\n\ncontends were misconstrued or overlooked by the trial judge.10\n\n        The first matter involves the doctor’s\n\ntestimony and medical report. When Nicholas arrived at hospital he was in pain. He told\n\nthe doctor he had been assaulted bythreemen. This is reflected in the\n\ndoctor’s report, which was recorded at 3am on 15 December 2001. The report also\n\nstated that the victim was alert, conscious and responsive, and the doctor knew this\n\nbecause a) he examined the appellant and b) the appellant’s Glasgow Coma Scale was\n\n15/15. The Glasgow Coma Scale assesses the conscious level of a patient and 15/15 meant\n\nthat the appellant was responsive. In court, Nicholas stated that he sawfourmales\n\nrush to him in the appellant’s home. It seems from the material that the appellant is\n\ntrying to contend that there is a discrepancy between what Nicholas said to the doctor\n\nupon arrival at the hospital and what he said in Court with regard to the number of people\n\nhe was assaulted by. The appellant’s hope, it seems, is that this discrepancy might\n\ndamage Nicholas’s credibility as a witness. To this end, the appellant contends that\n\nthe trial judge was incorrect not to rely on Nicholas’s initial utterance to the\n\ndoctor that there werethreemen. The appellant used the case ofDr James Khoo\n\nand Others v Gunapathy d/o Muniandy[2001] to argue that the trial judge should not\n\nhave substituted her judgment for the professional judgement of a medical doctor who had\n\nstated during cross examination :He (Nicholas) was in pain, he (Nicholas)\n\n  was able to answer my questions.By using this case, the appellant hopes to\n\nshow thatthreewas the correct number and this therefore a) discredits Nicholas as\n\na witness and b) questions whether there were sufficient persons for an unlawful assembly\n\ncharge ( five are needed in total). Firstly, the case cited is totally irrelevant to the\n\ncase at hand. To quote from the judgement of the Court of Appeal :A judge, unschooled and unskilled in the\n\n  art of medicine, has no business adjudicating matters over which medical experts\n\n  themselves cannot come to agreement. This is especially where, as in this case, the\n\n  medical dispute is complex and resolvable only by long-term research and empirical\n\n  observation.The trial judge was without a doubt in her\n\nleague when she ruled that Nicholas (who whilst alert and responsive, was also in a\n\nterrible amount of pain) would be in a better position to give a more accurate description\n\nof what happened after he had been treated.11\n\n        An alert man has a lot more poise than an alert\n\nman who is in a terrible amount of pain. There is no need for long-term empirical research\n\nto arrive at such a conclusion. TheDr James Khoocase is irrelevant.12\n\n        The second matter involves the doctor’s\n\nopinion that the injury suffered by Nicholas could also have been caused by a fall\n\nbackwards. The trial judge did not overlook this point. The doctor when cross-examined did\n\nsay that Nicholas could have sustained an injury at the top of his head by falling\n\nbackwards. But the trial judge decided that though the possibility existed, this was not\n\nwhat happened. The trial judge rightly pointed out that the appellant stated that Thomas\n\n(who was alleged by the appellant to have been there) was behind Nicholas when the\n\nappellant caused Nicholas to fall. If this is so, then Thomas would have broken\n\nNicholas’s fall, and the chance of a serious cut on top of his head would be slim.\n\nThen there is the appellant’s contention that the bricks were arranged differently as\n\nwhat was reflected in the photos. The arrangement of bricks at the time Nicholas fell, the\n\nappellant argues, was one single row along the wall, of one brick height. Naturally, this\n\narrangement is more conducive to his story that Nicholas fell backwards and cut the top of\n\nhis head on the row of bricks. He contends this despite a) the fact that the police took\n\nthe photos at 4.45am the same morning and b) that the police arrived on the scene almost\n\nimmediately. In short, if the bricks were re-arranged as the appellant contends, they\n\nwould have to have been re-arranged right under the noses of the police officers. This, of\n\ncourse, is unlikely.13\n\n        Even if we allow the appellant’s argument\n\na) that he did not actually see Nicholas fall backward, head first, into the bricks, and\n\nb) that this head-hitting-brick argument was just speculation, and c) that what actually\n\nhappened was that he fell backwards onto the ground, how can the appellant explain the\n\nsecond lot of injuries on Nicholas’s face – ie the fracture of the facial\n\nstructure/orbit on the right? I maintain that the trial judge did not err in her finding\n\nthat Nicholas was injured by men wielding poles. The doctor’s report did conclude\n\nthat the injuries sustained were consistent with blow(s) from a blunt object. And at\n\ntrial, the doctor stated that a metal pole or a wooden pole would have been able to cause\n\nthe injury to the vertex of Nicholas’s head and to his face.14\n\n        The third matter involves Nicholas’s\n\nallegedly incredible explanation for the absence of injuries on his hands. There is\n\nnothing so incredible about his explanation. He had a major cut on the vertex of his head,\n\nand injuries to his face. He was using his hands to fend off the blows, and just because\n\nhe did not sustain injuries to his hands does not lead to the conclusion that he could not\n\nhave been whacked on the head and face. After all, the doctor did say that if the\n\nassailant was standing near the victim, there is the possibility that the victim not\n\nsustain injuries to his hand. The absence of injuries to the victim’s hands does not\n\nprompt the conclusion that he must have been the assailant himself.15\n\n        The fourth matter involves the half-drunken\n\ncondition of Nicholas on the morning of 5 December 2001. The District Judge was aware that\n\nLim and Nicholas had been drinking prior to the events at the appellant’s home.\n\nHowever, they were not so intoxicated that they did not know what they were doing. The\n\ndoctor who examined Nicholas at hospital testified that the victim did not show signs of\n\ndisorientation. In fact, he was ‘alert, conscious, and responsive.’16\n\n        The fifth matter involves the appellant’s\n\ncommando training and relative sobriety. The appellant had been trained as a commando and\n\nwas stationed in Greece as part of his career tour. It is the appellant’s case that\n\nit is due to his elite training that he was able to fend off four men without a scratch.\n\nBut if the commando was not deferent to fear why did he switch off his lights in order to\n\nlead the supposed gang to the belief that he was not in? And if he wanted to lead them to\n\nbelieve that he was not in, why didn’t he shut and lock the metal grill and door?\n\nInstead he left the door and the grill unlocked. He had ample time in between the time he\n\nalleged he saw the gang downstairs from his window and the time the alleged gang arrived\n\nat the front of his flat. Instead of ensuring his safety, he left his grill and door\n\nunlocked. This does not tally with his switching off the lights. There was no gang which\n\ncame to attack the appellant. It was the appellant who enrolled a gang to ambush and beat\n\nup the victim at the appellant’s house.17\n\n        The sixth matter involves the position of the\n\ntwo pools of blood. As shown in the photos, there were two pools of blood. The two pools\n\nwere in the corridor. There was no blood to be found in the house. This might tally with\n\nthe appellant’s claim that Nicholas fell backwards hitting his head on its vertex. I\n\nreject this theory. The two poolsoutsidethe house and there being no blood trails\n\nin the house can be explained by the trial judge’s description of what could very\n\nactually have taken place. Nicholas only testified that he fell unconscious in the\n\nappellant’s house. Thus, it could be that he was continually beaten even outside the\n\nflat, but not to his knowledge. This is not inconsistent with the trial judge’s\n\nfindings. What the assailants did to Nicholas when he was unconscious we do not know.\n\nNeither does Nicholas. But the absence of blood in the house should not affect the\n\nconclusion that Nicholas was attacked and fell unconscious in the flat.18\n\n        The seventh matter involves the failure to find\n\nthe alleged third weapon.The total number of weapons is not important. The two\n\npoles could have been the weapons which rendered the injury to Nicholas. But they need not\n\nhave been – this is so because of the nature of the unlawful assembly offence and how\n\nit aims to attribute culpability through the medium of (potentially) just one act. All\n\nother members, though using weapons which did not administer the fateful blow, are\n\nvicariously liable through that one relevant action. Following this philosophy, there need\n\nnot be presented and accounted at trial the full compliment of weapons, and there need not\n\nbe present the one key weapon which dealt the fateful blow.19\n\n        The eighth matter involves the absence of blood\n\non the poles. Following from my point in the last paragraph, it is not imperative that the\n\nprosecution produce the actual weapons used in an assault. It could very well have been\n\nthe case that more poles than these two were used. The victim stated in evidence:I am not sure whether all the four guys\n\n  carried poles but I saw that the two of them who were in front carried poles. I can’t\n\n  tell if the two behind carried poles.There was therefore the very real\n\npossibility that there were more than these two poles used. The appellant’s story\n\nfails to convince this court that he was not the assailant in this ordeal.20\n\n        I move onto the inconsistencies in the\n\nappellant’s case. The appellant’s story that the victim’s injury was\n\nsustained by his falling backwards is put in very serious doubt by the fact that the\n\nappellant testified that there was someone behind the victim before the fall took place.\n\nIn cross-examination, the appellant was asked :Q When you pushed Perez Nicholas out, you\n\n  must have also indirectly pushed Vela Thomas who was behind out?A I believe so. Vela Thomas who was behind\n\n  Perez Nicholas moved backwards himself.If this Thomas (who was alleged present by\n\nthe appellant) was behind Nicholas, it would logically follow that Thomas would break, in\n\nwhole or in part, Nicholas’s fall. With the high likelihood of Thomas cushioning\n\nNicholas’s fall, the appellant’s story that Nicholas sustained his injury by\n\nfalling backwards becomes even less convincing than it already is.",
        "Section 149 of the Penal Code states :": "If an offence is committed by any member\n\n  of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as\n\n  the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that\n\n  object, every person who, at the time of the committing of that offence, is a member of\n\n  the same assembly, is guilty of that offence.21\n\n        There being five people – the appellant\n\nand four others – involved in the incident, the ingredients of the offence have been\n\nproved. There is nothing in law which prevents the Court from finding that the unlawful\n\nassembly consisted of the convicted persons and some unidentified persons (seeRatanal\n\n& Dhirajlal’s ‘Law of Crimes : A Commentary on the Indian Penal Code’2002 Delhi at Chapter 8 page 602).",
        "Section 326 of the Penal Code": "22\n\n        The weapons used in committing the offence were\n\nwooden and metal poles. These poles, if used in the manner which they were, are likely to\n\ncause death – this confirms the appellant’s culpability under s326 of the Penal\n\nCode. To this end, this Court should not disturb the finding of the trial judge. The\n\nconviction should stand. I now turn to sentence.23\n\n        According to the textbook,Practitioner’s\n\nLibrary, ‘Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts’, 2000the factors\n\nto be taken into account when sentencing the accused under s 326 of the Penal Code are as\n\nfollows :-1 Seriousness and permanence of injuries2 Group action3 Premeditated4 Weapon used5 Vulnerable victim6 Offender in position of authority7 Racial motivation8 Prior record of violence24\n\n        It must be stressed that this attack was\n\ncarried out by a group. It was premeditated. The appellant had enrolled others into his\n\nintention. This was not a one-off vengeful act but a planned one. And the weapons used\n\nwere poles – both wooden and metal. The appellant also has a prior record of\n\nviolence. He was convicted of voluntarily causing hurt under s323 of the penal Code, and\n\nsentenced to one month imprisonment.25\n\n        It is noteworthy that Nicholas stated on the\n\nstand that if need be he would fight with the appellant at his home. But it must be\n\nstressed that his aim of going over to the appellant’s home was to talk sternly to\n\nhim in order to come to the bottom of the disagreement. I stress here that before Nicholas\n\ncould even talk with the appellant he was pounced upon by four other men. I do not approve\n\nof Nicholas’s desire to resolve issues through the fist, but in this case he was not\n\neven given a chance to speak to the appellant. Thus, the fact that Nicholas wanted to\n\nsettle the matter by means of a fight, as a last resort, ought not to prompt this Court to\n\nlessen the sentence. The bottom line is this – he was not even given a chance to\n\nspeak with the appellant. Instead he was pounced on by a pack of men.The sentence should stand at 4 years\n\nimprisonment and six strokes of the cane.For these reasons I dismiss the appeal.Appeal dismissedSgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
