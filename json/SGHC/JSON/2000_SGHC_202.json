        "Facts": "On 12 March 1998, the plaintiff was riding\n\nhis motor-cycle along Sims Avenue. There was a collision between the motor-cycle and a\n\nmotor van driven by the defendant. The plaintiff suffered injuries. He then issued a writ\n\nseeking damages. The defendant did not deny liability. Interlocutory judgment was entered\n\nby consent. Damages were then assessed by in the aggregate amount of $329,788. Out of that\n\namount, the court below awarded $16,500.42 for pre-trial loss of earnings, $183,600 for\n\nloss of future earnings and $20,000 for loss of earning capacity. The defendant appealed.",
        "Held": ", varied the amount of damages for\n\npre-trial and future loss of earnings to a global sum of $120,000 and no award for loss of\n\nearning capacity:(1) In this case, the loss of earnings was\n\n  in respect of past and prospective earnings and there can be no additional claim for loss\n\n  of earning capacity. The plaintiff in this case was working before the accident and\n\n  returned to work after the accident and the loss of earnings was known and assessable.\n\n  Accordingly, he was not entitled to additional general damages for handicap in the future\n\n  as loss of earning capacity (see  9).(2) In view of the medical evidence, there\n\n  was sufficient objective basis to conclude that the plaintiff’s earning capacity, as\n\n  in loss of future earnings, was indeed diminished. The evidence adduced, however, did not\n\n  support a drastic loss of 60% as asserted by the plaintiff. He magnified it to maximize\n\n  his claim for damages. The defendant’s counsel conceded that while the plaintiff\n\n  suffered \"a mild disability\", it was not, however, so minimal to apply thede\n\n  minimusdoctine. The fair and reasonable loss was about 25% (see  11).(3) As the plaintiff was only 28 years\n\n  old, the court determined a multiplier of 18 years. This accorded with the current trend\n\n  in relation to a healthy young man (see  12).(4) It was contended that as the plaintiff\n\n  was a Malaysian he could not work in Singapore indefinitely. In this regard, the court\n\n  noted that the plaintiff was not an unskilled labourer confined to work at a construction\n\n  site. He had acquired a specialised skill for which there would always be a need in\n\n  Singapore. Additionally, his employer could not find an equally skilled replacement during\n\n  his absence. The probabilities were that Singapore would hold out a job for him (see \n\n  13).(5) Based on the objective income tax\n\n  returns of the plaintiff, the court accepted the plaintiff's income as $2,100 per month.\n\n  In keeping with an estimate of 25% loss of ability, the court decided on an estimated\n\n  monthly loss of $500. That was the amount the court used in calculating his past and\n\n  future loss of earnings after he returned to work. The court was of the view that that was\n\n  the most reasonable basis in the special circumstances of this case. Based on 22 months of\n\n  pre-assessment loss of earnings at $500 per month amounting to $11,000 and prospective\n\n  loss of earnings at $500 per month x 18 years x 12 months amounting to $108,000, the court\n\n  arrived at a total of $119,000. This figure was then rounded off to $120,000 (see \n\n  14-15).",

There was a collision between the\n\nmotor-cycle and a motor van driven by the defendant. The plaintiff suffered injuries. He\n\nthen issued a writ seeking damages. The defendant did not deny liability. Interlocutory\n\njudgment was entered by consent. Damages remained to be assessed by the Registrar.2.\n\n        Assessment of damages was done by Ms Tan Wen\n\nShan AR. She awarded general damages in the aggregate amount of $329,788. The breakdown\n\nwas as follows :1.    General damages\n\n                         \n\n  $329,000.00(a)    fracture of clavicle\n\n                      \n\n  $ 8,000.00(b)    fracture of scapula\n\n                      \n\n  $ 6,000.00(c)    fracture of ribs\n\n                            \n\n  $ 8,000.00(d)    reduced sense of\n\n  smell               \n\n  $ 10,000.00(e)    scarring and\n\n  abrasions\n\n                 \n\n  $ 3,000.00(f)    head injuries\n\n                                \n\n  $ 90,000.00(g)    loss of future\n\n  earnings\n\n                  \n\n  $183,600.00(h)    loss of earning\n\n  capacity              $\n\n  20,000.00(i)    cost of future\n\n  medical cares        $ 1,188.003.\n\n        Then there were special damages. They were as\n\nfollows :(a) Medical expenses (agreed)\n\n          $ 7,113.91(b) Pre-trial transport (agreed)\n\n          $ 150.00(c) Pre-trial loss of earningsfrom 12 March 1998 to6 August 1998\n\n                           \n\n  $ 8,771.78(d) Pre-trial eanringsfrom 7 August 1998 to28 December 1999\n\n                    \n\n  $ 16,500.42(e) Taxi fare to and from work@ $15 per day from 7 August1998 to 21 May 1999\n\n                 $\n\n  4,290.004.\n\n        The defendant appealed against the decision of\n\nthe Assistant Registrar. I varied the earnings part of the award of the Assistant\n\nRegistrar as follows : 1(g), (h) and 2(d) to $120,000.00. I awarded a lump-sum to include\n\nthe items.5.\n\n        The defendant has filed an appeal against the\n\naward of $120,000. I shall therefore elucidate this item.The law6.\n\n        First, the legal principles. A finding on\n\ndamages differs from an ordinary finding of fact in that it is generally much more a\n\nmatter of speculation and estimate. This statement is true in respect of some cases than\n\nof others. Assessment of general damages, in cases like breach of contract for the sale of\n\ngoods, for instance, is largely an objective exercise. Findings in such cases differ\n\nlittle from any other finding of fact. Assessment of damages for pain and suffering or\n\nwrongs such as slander are almost entirely matter of impression and of common sense. SeeDavis\n\nv Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd[1942] AC 601 at 624.7.\n\n        An appellate court is not justified in\n\nsubstituting a figure of its own for that awarded below because it would have awarded\n\nsomething different if it had tried the case. An appellate court will intervene only when\n\nthe Judge, in assessing the damages, applied a wrong principle of law; or, short of this,\n\nthe amount awarded is either so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a\n\nwholly erroneous estimate of the damage.See Flint v Lovell, [1935] 1 KB\n\n354,Davis v Powell. This rule, however, does not apply to an appeal from\n\nthe Registrar to the Judge-in-Chambers. SeeChangAh Lek v Lim Ah Koon[1999] 1 SLR 82. It settled the law that an assessment of damages which comes on appeal to\n\na Judge-in-Chambers is quite unlike an appeal from a trial judge to the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe restrictions that bind the Court of Appeal do not limit function of the Judge. The\n\nJudge addresses the issues before him and assesses the damagesde novo. He makes\n\nhis own findings based, however, on the evidential material written and collected by the\n\nRegistrar and the findings made by him. This is why the Court below is not required to\n\ngive reasons for its decision; and the appellant is not required to state the grounds of\n\nappeal enumerating the errors of the Court below. Additionally points not canvassed before\n\nthe Registrar may be presented before the Judge. Nonetheless, his decision must be\n\njudicial. Unlike the Registrar, the Judge must write his reasons if his decision is\n\nappealed. Even so, the Judge-in-Chambers ought not unnecessarily embark on an exercise of\n\ntinkering with the decision of the Court below with the view of fine tuning the decision.\n\nThat would demolish the important function of the Court below.Loss of earnings8.\n\n        In the case of non-fatal injury cases the\n\ninjured is entitled to recover both past and prospective earnings. The date of trial or\n\nassessment provide the dividing line. This bifurcation is important because the multiplier\n\nis determined from the date of trial or assessment without any deduction for the time\n\nbefore the trial long though it might be. SeePritchard v Cobden[1987] 2 WLR 627. In that case Pritchard suffered brain damage in 1976. He became unable to work\n\nbecause of the injury. The assessment of damages was done at the trial in 1986. Swinton\n\nThomas J took a multiplier of 14 from the date of trial and applied a multiplicand of\n\n9,000 per annum. The total loss of earnings, past and prospective, amounted to\n\n126,000. He rejected a submission that the multiplier should be reduced by the time\n\nelapsed since the accident. The Court of Appeal affirmed his decision. That decision\n\nsettled the law that : damages for loss of earnings of a living plaintiff should continue\n\nto be assessed as special damages for the earnings lost between the date of the accident\n\nand the date of assessment. Calculation of the future loss of earnings is computed from\n\nthe date of assessment by selecting an adequate multiplier for the multiplicand to\n\ncompensate for the likely loss of earnings for the remainder of his working life.Discriminating loss of earnings and loss\n\nof earning capacity9.(i)\n\n        The expressions \"loss of earnings\"\n\nand \"loss of earning capacity\" are often confused. Sometimes they are user\n\ntautologically. In this sense they encompass past and future loss of ascertainable\n\nearnings. The loss may be total or partial. In either case the loss is attributable to\n\nloss or reduction in earning ability. A claim for damages under this head are relatively\n\neasy to assess because the numbers that work the established formula are readily\n\navailable.(ii)\n\n        There is another sense to the expression\n\n\"loss of earning capacity\". This arises when the claimant returns to work\n\nwithout any immediate loss of earning. There is, however, the risk that in the future he\n\nmay be at a disadvantage due to a lingering disability by reason of the injury in getting\n\nanother job if he loses the present job. Alternatively he may suffer a pay-cut in the\n\nfuture on account of the disability. This is sometimes referred to as handicap in the\n\nlabour market. In this sense the expression is a term of art. To justify an award under\n\nthis head there must be a substantial or real risk that the plaintiff would lose his\n\npresent employment during his working life. If there was such a risk the assessment of\n\ndamages would depend on the degree of the risk, the time when the loss of employment might\n\noccur and the factors affecting the plaintiff’s chances of obtaining other\n\nemployment. SeeMoeliker v Reyrolle & Co Ltd[1977] 1 WLR 132.Low\n\nSwee Tong v Liew Machinery (Pte) Ltd[1993] 3 SLR 89andTeo Sing Keng v Sim\n\nBan Kiat[1994] 1 SLR 634. A claim under this head is hugely speculative and\n\ndifficult to assess. Except when clear evidence is adduced a large amount will not be\n\ngiven under this category. In any event, a claim under this head cannot arise where the\n\ninjured was working before the accident and suffered a permanent total or partial loss of\n\nearnings.(iii)\n\n        The two heads are alternative and not\n\ncumulative. In the case before me, as the loss of earnings was in respect of past and\n\nprospective earnings there can be no additional claim for loss of earning capacity in the\n\nsecond sense of the term. The plaintiff in this case was working before the accident and\n\nreturned to work after the accident and the loss of earnings was known and assessable.\n\nAccordingly he was not entitled to additional general damages for handicap in the future\n\nas loss of earning capacity in the second sense of the expression.The facts10.(i)\n\n        The claim for loss of earnings due to reduction\n\nin earning capacity was based on the following evidential material.(ii)\n\n        Dr Karen Chua of Tan Tock Seng Hospital in a\n\nmedical report dated 21 May 1999 said that : It is likely that subsequent improvement will\n\nbe slow and the likely estimated percentage awarded for permanent disability is 20%\n\n(twenty) percent for his residual high level cognitive impairment.(iii)\n\n        Dr Kanwaljit Soin, Orthopaedic Surgeon, an\n\nacknowledged expert in her field, said in a report dated 16 July 1999 on the plaintiff :\n\nThe patient is a mechanic but as a result of the injuries sustained from the accident,\n\nespecially the fracture of the clavicle,he is unable to carry heavy objects.(iv)\n\n        The plaintiff’s own assertion on the\n\nmatter was : \"After the accident, I could no longer carry or handle heavy objections.\n\nThe scope of my work is thus restricted. I also take more time to plan and figure out how\n\nto produce more complicated items. Due to the weakness in my limbs, my speed of work also\n\nslowed down. I became less productive and my employer reduced by pay to $850 with effect\n\nfrom November 1998. Further, after the accident, I could not work the long hours I used\n\nto. I have been advised by Dr Karen Chua to take more rest and not to strain myself. I\n\nfeel very tired after usual working hours and o longer have the stamina to work long\n\nhours. I therefore go home after working hours and rest on Sunday.\"(v)\n\n        The plaintiff’s employer’s evidence\n\non the loss of earnings aspect of the case was this :\"The plaintiff has been in the\n\n  employment of Cheong Hup Engineering Service since 1990. He is and has always been\n\n  employed as a fitter and his job involves producing metallic fixtures and items of all\n\n  shapes and sizes. The blue print would be given to him and his job includes planning and\n\n  figuring out how to produce the items. His job therefore involve handling metals of\n\n  various sizes and weight. Besides using machines to cut the metal, various tools are also\n\n  utilised, which of course requires certain amount of strength.Prior to the accident he was drawing an\n\n  average monthly salary of $2,100.00. His basic pay was $1,500.00 before August 1997 and\n\n  with effect from August 1997, his pay was $1,300.00, after a $150.00 increment.He is very hard working and did overtime\n\n  work almost every day including Sunday. The rate of his overtime pay was 1.5 times the\n\n  hourly rate of his basic pay, for weekdays and 2 times of the same for Sunday.However, after the road accident on\n\n  12.3.98, the plaintiff no longer works over time as it is too tiring for him and he needs\n\n  more rest.Since the accident, the plaintiff could\n\n  not lift nor handle heavy objects any more. His scope of work is therefore also restricted\n\n  as compared to the scope of work he could do before the said accident happened. Further,\n\n  since the accident, his speed of work also slowed down thus becoming less productive. As\n\n  Cheong Hup Engineering Services is making slim profits and profits are dependant on the\n\n  number of items produced, I have no choice but to reduce his basic pay to commensurate his\n\n  scope of work and productivity. Thus, from November 1998, his pay was reduced to\n\n  $850.000.\"The findings : Loss of earning capacity11.\n\n        Tan Wen Shan AR who saw the witnesses being\n\ncross-examined appears to have accepted the evidence of the plaintiff and his employer. In\n\nmy view the evidence given by them was subjective and should be subjected to scrutiny. In\n\nview of the medical evidence and particularly that of Dr Kanwaljit Soin there was\n\nsufficient objective basis to conclude that the plaintiff’s earning capacity in the\n\nfirst sense was indeed diminished. The evidence adduced, however, did not support a\n\ndrastic loss of 60% ($850 over $2100) as asserted by the plaintiff. He magnified it to\n\nmaximize his claim for damages. It was a case of a plaintiff psychologically opting out of\n\nhard work in the hope of recovering his perceived loss of earnings from the defendant who\n\nin fact was an insurance company . The defendant’s counsel conceded that what the\n\nplaintiff suffered \"a mild disability\". It was not, however, so minimal to apply\n\nthede minimusdoctine. The fair and reasonable loss was about 25%.The multiplier12.\n\n        I now turn to the multiplier. As I have already\n\nstated this is ascertained from the date of the trial. In this case it was the date of\n\nassessment. As I heard the matterde novothe starting point for future loss was\n\nthe date of my decision. It is to be borne in mind that the time that elapsed from the\n\ndate of accident to the date of my decision was not too long for the defendant to grouse\n\nabout. As the plaintiff was only 28 years old I determined a multiplier of 18 years. This\n\naccorded with the current trend in relation to a healthy young man.The Malaysian factor13.\n\n        It was contended that as the plaintiff was a\n\nMalaysian he could not work in Singapore indefinitely. When considering this matter I\n\nnoted that the plaintiff was not an unskilled labourer confined to work at a construction\n\nsite. He had acquired a specialised skill for which there would always be a need in\n\nSingapore. Additionally, his employer could not find an equally skilled replacement during\n\nhis absence. The probabilities were that Singapore would hold out a job for him. In this\n\nregard I shared the view of Judith Prakash J inWee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon[1996] 3 SLR 513where she took judicial notice of the fact that a Malaysian construction\n\nworker in Singapore would continue to work here for a good length of time. A skilled\n\nworker has a better future than a construction worker in Singapore.The multiplicand14.\n\n        Finally, the multiplicand. The plaintiff’s\n\ncase was that before the accident he earned an average of $2,100 per month. This was\n\nsupported by Inland Revenue Authority document for the Year of Assessment 1998. His\n\nearnings for the whole year 1997 was $21,629.65. This amount had two components : First\n\nhalf : $8,988.40. Second half : $12,640.60. The average monthly income for the period July\n\nto December, therefore, was $2,106.77 ($12,640.60  6). This was independent and\n\nuncontroverted evidence. In view of this it was very probable and reasonable that his\n\nmonthly earning at the time of accident was $2,100. This was number applied to calculate\n\nthe earnings before the plaintiff returned to work on 7 August 1998. The plaintiff’s\n\nemployer was not a large organisation with an accounting staff. It was not surprising that\n\nthere was not much documentation evidencing all the moneys his employer paid him. For this\n\nreason, the tax return was adequate proof of the plaintiff’s earning before the\n\naccident. For the future the plaintiff’s earnings, if anything, would only go up in\n\nthe ordinary nature of things. The plaintiff contended for a loss of $1,250 per month. For\n\nreasons already stated this could not be sustained on an objective basis. In keeping with\n\nan estimate of 25% loss of ability I decided on an estimated monthly loss of $500. That\n\nwas the amount I used in calculating his past and future loss of earnings after he\n\nreturned to work. That was the most reasonable basis in the special circumstances of this\n\ncase.15.\n\n        Those numbers gave these amounts :Pre-assessment loss ofEarnings from 7.8.98 to26.5.2000 (22 months)        $ 11,500.00Prospective loss ofearnings 18 x 12 x $500$108,000.00Total :$119,000.0016.\n\n        As the assessment of past and future earnings\n\nor loss of earning capacity in the first sense of that expression involved estimates I\n\nrounded the aggregate amount to $120,000. It was a global approach to derive a just\n\nresult.Sgd:G P SELVAMJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
