        "Introduction": "1       This\nappeal highlights the challenging task faced by the courts when sentencing\nan offender diagnosed with a psychiatric condition. The condition\nis insufficient to constitute a full defence to the criminal conduct perpetrated\nby the accused but is nevertheless relevant when the particular individual\nis sentenced. The multi-faceted task of tailoring the sentence to the\noffender becomes further vexed by the complexities of the human\nmind. It is most certainly an unenviable task. 2       The\nrespondent, Chong Hou En, a 29-year-old male, pleaded guilty to five\ncharges under s 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”)\nand a single charge under s 30(1) of the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev\nEd) (“Films Act”). The district judge (“the Judge”) was of the view\nthat a probation order was appropriate and ordered accordingly.\nThe Prosecution successfully applied for a stay of sentence and\nnow appeals against the sentence on the ground that it is manifestly\ninadequate.",
        "The Facts": "3       The\nrespondent admitted without qualification to the following facts.[note: 1]The\nrespondent graduated from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology\n(Singapore Institute of Management) in 2008 and worked as a labour\nrelations officer. He was arrested on 6 January 2011 at IMM shopping\nmall at Jurong East Street 21. The respondent had gone to the shopping\nmall with the purpose of capturing “Up Skirt” videos. To facilitate this,\nhe had purchased a mini-camera costing about $40 from an online store.\nHe attached the mini-camera to the tip of his shoe with Blu-Tack. 4       The\nvictim and her husband were at the Giant Hypermarket of the same\nshopping mall. While they were at the Fresh Fruits section, the respondent\ncame up from behind the victim and placed his foot underneath the\nskirt of the victim in order to film an “Up Skirt” video. The respondent attempted\nto flee the scene after he was noticed by the husband of the victim.\nHe was detained by the victim’s husband with the help of a passer-by\nafter a brief struggle. He was subsequently arrested by the police. 5       In\nthe course of investigations, the respondent’s computers, laptops, mobile\nphone, flash drives, memory cards, hard drive and pinhole cameras were\nseized. A few thousand videos were found in his computer and hard drive.\nThe Board of Film Censors of the Media Development Authority certified\nthat 10,574 video films were obscene. 6       Further\ninvestigations of his computer equipment also revealed videos of\nfemales showering in his girlfriend’s parents’ home. The respondent\nhad, from August 2010, through a series of carefully planned episodes,\nrecorded his girlfriend’s family members in the shower. The respondent\nknew that they would take a shower once they had switched on the\nwater heater.  He would then enter the toilet to place a digital\ncamera (that was cleverly disguised as a lighter to avoid detection)\nthere. After the family members of his girlfriend had finished their\nshowers, the respondent would retrieve the camera and access the\nvideos. 7       Through\nthese steps, the respondent filmed the older sister of his girlfriend\n(aged 30 at the time of the offence) and his girlfriend’s two young nieces\n(aged 12 and ten at the time of the offence). His girlfriend’s sister-in-law\n(aged 31 at the time of the offence), who was the mother of the\ntwo nieces, was also filmed. These obscene videos captured the victims\nfully nude with moving images of their breasts and vulvas. The respondent would\nwatch these videos and masturbate to them. 8       The\nrespondent was thus charged and convicted of five counts of insulting\nthe modesty of a woman by intruding upon her privacy under s 509\nof the Penal Code with respect to the victim at IMM shopping mall\nand the four victims in his girlfriend’s parents’ home. He was also\ncharged and convicted of one count of possession of 10,574 obscene\nfilms under s 30(1) of the Films Act. The respondent consented to\nten other charges of insulting the modesty of a woman under s 509\nof the Penal Code and one charge of possession of 578 video films\nwithout a valid certificate under s 21(1)(a)\nof the Films Act to be taken into consideration for sentencing.",
        "The decision of the Judge": "9       The\nJudge was of the view that the main sentencing consideration should\nbe rehabilitation. Noting that the maximum penalty prescribed was one\nyears’ imprisonment and a fine for an offence under s 509 of the\nPenal Code and that an offence under s 30(1) of the Films Act brought\na maximum punishment of six months’ imprisonment and a $20,000 aggregate\nfine, the Judge concluded that the offences were not serious offences.\nThe Judge also placed considerable weight on the medical evidence\nwhich stated that the accused was suffering from voyeurism. He concluded\nthat deterrence “should not take precedence over rehabilitation as\nthe offender was labouring under a serious psychiatric condition\nor mental disorder at the time of the incident”. 10     The\nJudge also concluded that the aggravating factors highlighted by the\nProsecution, which included the use of recording devices, multiple victims\nincluding children, premeditation and elaborate planning, and the fact\nthat the private parts of the victims were captured, should “be\ngiven little weight in light of the fact that the accused was suffering\nfrom a psychiatric condition at the material time.” 11     According\nto the Judge, imprisonment would hamper the treatment programme\nof the respondent. Furthermore, the Judge was persuaded by the “exceptional\nsupport” of the respondent’s loved ones, including his girlfriend,\nwhose family had also stood by and forgiven him, and his commitment\nto secure his own recovery and rehabilitation. The Judge also attached\nweight to the fact that the respondent had voluntarily undergone treatment\nfor three years and that he had not reoffended since the commission\nof these offences. The Judge opined that there was no need to punish\nthe respondent further in the light of the fact that he was “currently suffering\nfrom significant depressive and anxiety symptomatology” related to\nthe shame and stress from his commission of the offences. 12     With\nall of the above factors in mind, the Judge ordered the respondent\nto undergo 30 months’ split probation (three months’ intensive and\n27 months’ supervised) with the following conditions: (a)     to\nundergo psychiatric and psychological follow-up as required by the\nInstitute of Mental Health (“IMH’), psychiatrist Dr Tommy Tan and\npsychologist, Mr James Tan, and to take medication as prescribed; (b)     to\nattend counselling with a qualified counsellor to address his relationship\ndifficulties with his girlfriend and his parents; (c)     to\nbe prohibited from possessing any electronic devices with camera\nfacilities and to be supervised closely when accessing websites; and (d)     his\nparents and girlfriend to be bonded for $5000 to ensure his good\nbehaviour.",
        "Arguments of the parties": "",
        "The appellant’s arguments": "13     In\narguing that a custodial sentence is warranted, the Prosecution does\nnot challenge the diagnosis of voyeurism and fetishism. Instead,\nthey argue that the starting point for offences under s 509 of the\nPenal Code which involve the use of recording devices should be\ncustodial. The Prosecution relies on the case ofPP\nv Tay Beng Guan Albert[2000] 2 SLR(R) 778 (“Albert Tay”) in support of this proposition.\nI shall return to this case later. 14     The\nProsecution also submits that the severity of the offences and the aggravating\nfactors point towards a strong public interest in imposing a custodial\nsentence. The Prosecution submits that the learned Judge erred in finding\nthat the offence under s 509 was not a serious offence. The prosecution\nalso highlights the following facts, which it argues are aggravating: (a)     there\nwas a high degree of intrusion into the privacy of victims since\nsome victims were recorded fully naked; (b)     there\nwere multiple victims; (c)     some\nof the victims were young; (d)     a\nvideo-camcorder was used; and (e)     there\nwas a high degree of planning and premeditation. 15     The\nProsecution also points to an observation that there has been an annual\nincrease in the number of offences under s 509 of the Penal Code (“Dealing\nwith Mentally Ill Offenders”,The Straits Times,\n(7 July 2012)). The prosecution submits that the offences under\ns 509 of the Penal Code are a concern to public safety since camera\nphones are now ubiquitous and it is not uncommon to find miniature\ncameras disguised as smoke detectors, pens, cigarette lighters,\nmirror clocks, car alarm key chains or even clothing hooks. A deterrent\nsentence is therefore warranted to send a stern message to potential\noffenders. 16     The\nProsecution submits that rehabilitation should not override the other\npenal objectives of deterrence and retribution. According to the Prosecution,\nthe Judge had placed excessive weight on the causal link between\nthe respondent’s condition of voyeurism and his commission of the\noffences. The concept of general deterrence should also feature\nas an important sentencing consideration, while the concept of retribution\nis also relevant. The Prosecution points out that the intrusion\ninto the privacy of the victims by the respondent was grave. There\nis also a high degree of culpability displayed by the significant\ndegree of planning and premeditation. Furthermore, some of these\noffences involved the recording of victims in their very own homes\nthus violating the safety and security that the victims would expect\nfrom being in their own home. 17     Given\nall these factors, the Prosecution submits that the sentence of probation\nis manifestly inadequate and seeks a custodial sentence of more than\nfour weeks’ imprisonment per charge in respect of the offences under s 509\nof the Penal Code.",
        "The respondent’s arguments": "18     Counsel\nfor the respondent argues that the Prosecution has failed to show\nhow the sentence of probation, which was imposed after a very careful consideration\nof all the circumstances of the offences and the offender, is either\nwrong in principle or manifestly inadequate. Counsel submits that there\nis a causal link between the mental condition of voyeurism and fetishism\nand the commission of the offences. Accordingly, the sentencing principle\nthat assumes central importance must be rehabilitation. Counsel points\nto the following facts in aid of this submission: (a)     The\nrespondent was 28 years old at the time of the offences, had no\nantecedents and has not reoffended. (b)     The\nrespondent comes from a good family and has a bachelor’s degree\nin business management. He has put his further education on hold\nbecause of this episode. (c)     The\nrespondent is truly remorseful and has made a full confession. Most\nof the offences were only discovered because of his cooperation\nwith the police and his confessions. (d)     The\nrespondent was arrested more than three years ago and has successfully\nsought medical treatment for his condition in the interim period. (e)     There\nwere no adverse effects on any of the victims. The children affected\ndid not know about the incident and their pictures have not been\ncirculated in any way. Furthermore, the respondent’s girlfriend’s\nfamily has been forgiving and supportive of the respondent. (f)     The\nwhole episode has taken its toll on the respondent. However, he\nhas continued with his treatment and was cooperative with the probation\nofficer before his sentence of probation was stayed. 19     Counsel\nfor the respondent also argues that the Prosecution’s reliance onAlbert Tayis inappropriate because it\nwas decided in 2000, before the introduction of community-based\nsentencing. Furthermore,Albert Taydid not\ninvolve an accused with a mental disorder. On this basis, counsel\nseeks to distinguishAlbert Tayfrom\nthe present case. Furthermore, counsel argues that if the court\nestablishes a norm that a custodial sentence is warranted in cases\nunder s 509 of the Penal Code, it would “come very close to legislating\na mandatory minimum sentence”.  Counsel also relies on the case\nofPP v Tan Huat Heng(Magistrate’s\nAppeal 25 of 2012 (unreported)) (“Tan Huat\nHeng”) where the court set aside a custodial sentence\nand imposed a term of probation on the appellant who was convicted\nof four counts under s 509 of the Penal Code. 20     Counsel\nsubmits that the Judge did not err in holding that rehabilitation\nwas the dominant principle in this case. Counsel points to the fact\nthat the respondent has been diligent in his treatment and has taken\na lot of corrective steps to ensure that he will not be tempted\nor inclined to commit these kinds of offences again in the future.\nImposing a term of imprisonment will ruin the efforts taken by the\nrespondent to secure his rehabilitation. No significant public interest\nwill be served by sending the respondent to prison. Accordingly,\nhe submits that the sentence imposed by the Judge is not manifestly\ninadequate and that this appeal should be dismissed.",
        "The need for expert testimony": "21     The\nProsecution relies on diagnostic criteria to show that voyeurism and\nfetishism are classed separately from impulse control disorders\nwhich include disorders such as kleptomania and pyromania. The Prosecution submits\nthat the present case is different, given the high level of planning and\npremeditation; it is not a situation where the acts were done on\nthe spur of the moment. The underlying suggestion of the Prosecution\nappears to be that a person diagnosed with a voyeurism disorder\nis nevertheless able to control his acts of voyeurism. However,\nin my view, this must be substantiated by expert evidence. The Prosecution\nthen applied under s 392(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap\n68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) for further evidence to be taken by\nthis court in respect of expert evidence in relation to the nature\nof voyeurism and whether it deprives a person suffering from the\ndisorder of control over his actions. I granted the application.\nBoth the Prosecution and the respondent called expert witnesses\nto testify on the nature of voyeurism. I will deal with the expert testimonies\nand my findings in relation to them below.",
        "My decision": "",
        "Overview": "22     The\nprinciples with regards to appeals on sentence are trite. InPublic Prosecutor v UI[2008] 4 SLR(R)\n500 (“PP v UI”), the Court of Appeal reiterated\nthe principles in the following manner: 12    It\nis, of course, well established (see,inter\nalia,Tan Koon Swan v PP[1985-1986]\nSLR(R) 976  andOng Ah Tiong v PP[2004]\n1 SLR(R) 587 ) that an appellate court will not ordinarily disturb\nthe sentence imposed by the trial court except where it is satisfied\nthat: (a)    the\ntrial judge erred with respect to the proper factual basis for sentencing; (b)    the trial judge failed to appreciate\nthe materials placed before him; (c)    the sentence was wrong in principle;\nor (d)    the sentence was manifestly excessive\nor manifestly inadequate, as the case may be. 13    For\nthe purposes of the present appeal, it will be sufficient for us\nto elaborate briefly on what is meant by a sentence which is \"manifestly excessive\"\nor \"manifestly inadequate\", the latter being the main contention raised\nby the Prosecution. A succinct explanation can be found inPP v Siew Boon Loong[2005] 1 SLR(R) 611\n, where Yong Pung How CJ stated (at [22]): When a sentence is said to be manifestly\ninadequate, or conversely, manifestly excessive, it means that the\nsentence is unjustly lenient or severe, as the case may be, andrequires substantial alterations rather than minute\ncorrectionsto remedy the injustice ... Similar sentiments were expressed inLiton([9]supra),\nwhere Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA, who delivered the judgment of\nthis court, stated the following (at [84]): [I]t bears repeating that an appellate\ncourt should only intervene where the sentence imposed by the court\nbelow was \"manifestly\" inadequate - that in itself implies ahigh threshold before intervention is warranted. In\nthe light of the highly discretionary nature of the sentencing process and\nthe relatively circumscribed grounds on which appellate intervention\nis warranted, the prerogative to correct sentences should be tempered\nby a certain degree of deference to the sentencing judge's exercise\nof discretion. [emphasis in original]",
        "Sentencing principle of individuals\ndiagnosed with psychiatric conditions": "23     The\nCourt of Appeal has recently dealt with the relevant principles when\nsentencing an offender with a mental disorder falling short of unsoundness\nof mind. InLim Ghim Peow v Public Prosecutor[2014]\n4 SLR 1287 (“Lim Ghim Peow”), Chao\nHick Tin JA neatly summarised the principles at play as follows: 25    [T]he\nexistence of a mental disorder on the part of the offender is always\na relevant factor in the sentencing process. The manner and extent\nof its relevance depends on the circumstances of each case, in particular,\nthe nature and severity of the mental disorder. In fact, the existence\nof a mental disorder often gives rise to contradictory sentencing\nobjectives. As V K Rajah JA noted inPP v Goh\nLee Yin[2008] 1 SLR(R) 824  (“Goh\nLee Yin (2008)”) at [1], “the paradox of sentencing the\nmentally ill” is that “[s]uch illnesses can be a mitigating consideration\nor point towards a future danger that may require more severe sentencing”.\nThis echoes what was stated by the High Court of Australia inVeen v The Queen (No 2)(1988) 164 CLR\n465 at 476-477 (cited with approval by the Singapore Court of Appeal\ninPP v Aniza bte Essa[2009] 3\nSLR(R) 327  (“Aniza”) at [70]): ... The purposes of criminal punishment\nare various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and\nof others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform.\nThe purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation\nfrom the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence\nin a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence\nbut sometimes they point in different directions.And\nso a mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society\nwhen he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for\na particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects:\none which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards\na shorter.… 26    In\nsentencing a mentally disordered offender, there is generally a tension\nbetween the sentencing principles of specific and general deterrence on\nthe one hand, and the principle of rehabilitation on the other.\nThe approach which our courts have adopted is that the element ofgeneraldeterrencemaybe\ngiven considerably less weight if the offender was suffering from\na mental disorder at the time of the offence, particularly if the\nmental disorder was causally related to the offence. This was stated\nby Yong Pung How CJ in the Singapore High Court case ofNg So Kuen Connie v PP[2003] 3 SLR(R)\n178  (“Connie Ng”) at [58] as follows: ... [T]he element of general deterrence\ncan and should be given considerably less weight if the offender\nwas suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the commission\nof the offence. This is particularly so if there is a causal link\nbetween the mental disorder and the commission of the offence. In\naddition to the need for a causal link, other factors such as the\nseriousness of the mental condition, the likelihood of the [offender]\nrepeating the offence and the severity of the crime, are factors\nwhich have to be taken into account by the sentencing judge. In\nmy view, general deterrence will not be enhanced by meting out an\nimprisonment term to [an offender] suffering from a serious mental\ndisorder which led to the commission of the offence. … 28That said, we should clarify that the element of\ngeneral deterrence may still be accorded full weight in some circumstances,\nsuch as where the mental disorder is not serious or is not causally\nrelated to the commission of the offence, and the offence is a serious\none. … … 36    Similarly,\nthe sentencing principle ofspecificdeterrencemaybe of limited application in cases\ninvolving mentally disordered offenders. Whereas general deterrence\nis directed at educating and deterring other like-minded members\nof the general public by making an example of the particular offender\nconcerned, specific deterrence is directed at discouraging that\nparticular offender from committing offences in future (seePP v Tan Fook Sum[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022\n at [18]). The reason why specific deterrence may not be a relevant\nconsideration when sentencing mentally disordered offenders is that\nspecific deterrence is premised on the assumption that the offender\ncan balance and weigh consequences before committing an offence (seeTan Kay Beng v PP[2006] 4 SLR(R) 10 \nat [32]). The aim of specific deterrence is to deter the particular\noffender concerned from committing any further offences.It follows that where that offender’s mental disorder\nhas seriously inhibited his ability to make proper choices or appreciate\nthe nature and quality of his actions, it is unlikely that specific\ndeterrence will fulfil its aim of instilling in him the fear of\nre-offending. Conversely, specific deterrence may remain relevant\nin instances where the offence is premeditated or where there is\na conscious choice to commit the offence(seePP v Law Aik Meng[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814\n at [22]).This remains the case notwithstanding\nthe existence of a mental disorder on the part of the particular\noffender concerned. 37    Rehabilitation may take precedence\nwhere the sentencing principle of deterrence is rendered less effective\nby virtue of a serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder\non the part of the offender (seeGoh Lee Yin\nv PP[2006] 1 SLR(R) 530  at [29]). Rehabilitation, however,\nhas both a public and an individual dimension (seeGoh\nLee Yin (2008)([25]supra)\nat [99]). On the one hand, the courts are concerned about the welfare\nof the offender and the manner of reform and treatment which is\nmost suitable, particularly if the offender suffers from a psychiatric\nillness or other special psychiatric condition. On the other hand,\nthe underlying aim of rehabilitation is to advance the greater public\ninterest by reducing the risk of recidivism. 38    It is, moreover, erroneous to assume\nthat rehabilitation necessarily dictates that a lighter sentence\nbe imposed on a mentally disordered offender. This again depends\nvery much on the nature of the offence as well as the nature and\nseverity of the offender's mental disorder. The case ofPP v Kwong Kok Hing[2008] 2 SLR(R) 684\n serves as a useful illustration. In that case, the respondent was\ncharged with attempting to commit culpable homicide by pushing the\nvictim into the path of an oncoming train at a train station. He was\ndiagnosed as suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the\noffence. In the Prosecution's appeal against sentence, the Court\nof Appeal observed (at [37]) that “[w]hile\nthe respondent’s rehabilitation was a relevant consideration, there\nwas no suggestion that he could not be similarly rehabilitated in\nprison”, and that “even if one were to place considerable weight\non rehabilitation as a sentencing principle, it did not necessitate\na light sentence in the current case”. 39    In cases involving serious offences,\nthere is no reason why the retributive and protective principles\nof sentencing should not prevail over the principle of rehabilitation,\nnotwithstanding the offender's mental disorder. As Rajah JA stated\ninGoh Lee Yin (2008)at [107]: ... [T]his is not to say that inalloffences committed owing to a psychiatric\ndisease, rehabilitation must be the foremost consideration. Indeed,\nassuming that an offender suffers from a psychiatric disease which\ncauses him to commit a particular heinous offence, it would surely\nnot be correct to say that such an offender ought to be rehabilitated\nto the exclusion of other public interests. Rehabilitation may still\nbe a relevant consideration, but such rehabilitation may very well\nhave to take place in an environment where the offender is prevented\nfrom recommitting similar offences. [emphasis in original] We also note with approval the commentary\nin Kow Keng Siong,Sentencing Principles in\nSingapore(Academy Publishing, 2009) at para 18.125 that\n“the retributive principle features prominently in the sentencing\nof mentally disordered offenders or intellectually challenged offenders\nwhere the offence isparticularly serious or\nheinous” [emphasis in original]. The principle of retribution\nwill be particularly relevant if the offender’s mental disorder\ndid not seriously impair his capacity to appreciate the nature and\ngravity of his actions. Protection of the public will also be a\nrelevant consideration in cases involving serious offences and “dangerous”\noffenders, notwithstanding the fact that at the material time, the\noffender was suffering from a psychiatric disorder which caused\nthe commission of the very offence concerned (seeGoh\nLee Yin (2008)at [108]). Indeed, there is no reason\nwhy the public interest of protecting society should necessarily\ncease to be a relevant consideration when dealing with a mentally\ndisordered offender. Ultimately, the court must balance the interests\nof society against those of the offender. In every case, it is often\nthis search for the right balance which poses the greatest difficulties. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis\nadded in bold italics] 24     While\nthe court will always be cognisant of the need for rehabilitation in\ncases where the accused person is suffering from a mental disorder,\nthe principles with regards to sentencing an accused with a mental\ndisorder can be distilled, for present purposes, as follows: (a)     The\nexistence of a mental disorder on the part of the offender is always\na relevant factor in the sentencing process. (b)     The\nmanner and extent of its relevance depends on the circumstances\nof each case, in particular, the nature and severity of the mental\ndisorder. (c)     The\nelement of general deterrence may still be accorded full weight\nin some circumstances, such as where the mental disorder is not\nserious or is not causally related to the commission of the offence, and\nthe offence is a serious one. (d)     In\nspite of the existence of a mental disorder on the part of the accused,\nspecific deterrence may remain relevant in instances where the offence\nis premeditated or where there is a conscious choice to commit the\noffence. (e)     If\nthe serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder renders deterrence\nless effective, where for instance the offender has a significantly\nimpaired ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions,\nthen rehabilitation may take precedence. (f)     Even\nthough rehabilitation may be a relevant consideration, it does not\nnecessarily dictate a light sentence. The accused could also be rehabilitated\nin prison. (g)     Finally,\nin cases involving particularly heinous or serious offences, even\nwhen the accused person is labouring under a serious mental disorder,\nthere is no reason why the retributive and protective principles\nof sentencing should not prevail over the principle of rehabilitation. 25     Given\nthat the presence of a diagnosis of a mental disorder is in most cases\na mitigating factor which the courtmaytake\ninto account when sentencing the offender, its significance in terms\nof mitigating value depends on the factors and principles enumerated\nabove. These include specifically factors such as the causal link,\nthe nature and severity of the mental disorder and the offender’s\nability to make conscious choices and to appreciate the nature and\nquality of his actions. As explained at length, these are particularly\nimportant when determining the appropriate sentencing principles\nwhich should be engaged in the sentencing exercise. 26     In\nfact, the court must pay particular attention to thenatureof the mental disorder when the\ndisorder is one which invariably manifests itself in the doing of\nthe very act which is criminalised. If the very diagnostic criteria\ninclude the invariable manifestation of an act which is criminalised, a\ncausal link,however tenuous, would\nalmost certainly be present. It may even be circular to speak of\ncausation, simply on that premise – the diagnosis is based on the\nacting out of the criminal behaviour while the criminal behaviour\nis explicable by the presence of the mental disorder. The prosecution\nably demonstrates the difficulty in such cases since it would mean\nthe more a person engaged in the criminal behaviour, the more serious\nthe disorder is and the greater the mitigating value the disorder carries.\nThis cannot be correct. 27     Therefore,\nin this particular genus of mental disorders, the concept of a causal\nlink may not be particularly useful, or even that relevant for determining\nthe mitigating value to be ascribed to the mental disorder. In my\nview, where the “severity” of the mental disorder in an individual\nis assessed with respect to the “frequency” of the criminal act\nand there is a positive correlation between the “severity” and the\n“frequency”, then the severity and nature of the individual’s mental\ndisorder ought not to be regarded as a mitigating factor without\nfirst examining in detail thenatureof\nthe mental disorder, in terms of how it has affected the individual’s ability\nor capacity to control or refrain himself from committing the criminal\nacts and whether punishment will be able to instil fear in him and deter\nhim from committing the same criminal acts in future. 28     If\nthe nature of the mental disorder is such that the individual retains substantially\nthe mental ability or capacity to control or refrain himself when\nhe commits the criminal acts but he instead chooses not to exercise his\nself-control, and if it is also shown that punishment will be effective\nin instilling fear in him and thereby deter him from committing\nthe same criminal acts in the future, I will attribute very little\nor no mitigating value to the presence of the mental disorder. 29     If\nthere is evidence to show that the individual is not able or is substantially\nnot able to control or refrain himself from committing the criminal\nacts because of the mental disorder and similarly, punishment is unlikely\nto be effective in instilling fear in him and to deter him from committing\nthe same criminal acts in future because of the mental disorder, then\nthe principle of deterrence may be given less weight and rehabilitation may\nwell take precedence provided that the treatment mandated as part\nof his rehabilitation is going to be effective in treating the mental\ndisorder and in reducing the risk of recidivism. Nevertheless, if\nthe criminal offences committed are just too serious in nature,\nthe principle of rehabilitation may well have to give way to the\nprinciple of retribution and protection of the public at large.\nUltimately, the factual circumstances will govern how all these\ndifferent factors, pulling in different directions, are going to\ninteract. The court must judiciously weigh these various factors\nand arrive at a fair and just sentence that is appropriate in all\nthe circumstances of the case. 30     A\nfew illustrations of the judicial treatment of different mental disorders\nwill be useful to elucidate the appropriate approach to take in\nthe present case. 31     InPublic Prosecutor v Goh Lee Yin[2008]\n1 SLR(R) 824  (“Goh Lee Yin”) V\nK Rajah JA dealt with the applicable principles when sentencing\na person diagnosed with kleptomania. Rajah JA in his analysis examined\nthe nature of kleptomania as follows: The psychiatric disorder\nof kleptomania The nature of kleptomania 61    Kleptomania\n(Greek: , kleptein, “to steal”, , “mania”) is an impulse control\ndisorder characterised by the inability to resist impulses to steal objects\nthat are not generally acquired for personal use or monetary gain.\nThe individual concerned describes a compulsive urge to steal. The\nbehaviour is classically accompanied by an increasing sense of tension\nbefore, and a palpable sense of relief immediately after and during\nthe act. … 64    As\nto the peculiar features of kleptomania, the essential diagnostic criterion\nis the recurrent failure to resist the impulse to steal items that\nare not needed for personal use or that have little personal value.\nThe individual concerned may experience a rising sense of tension\nbefore the theft, and then experience gratification and/or anxiety\nreduction afterwards. Typically, the objects stolen usually have\nlittle value, and the person sometimes offers to pay for them, or\nmay give them away, or sometimes hoards them. What is especially\ncogent in this respect is perhaps the absurdity of the act - what\nis stolen is not generally needed. For example, Dr Phang testified\nin court that he had experience dealing with kleptomaniacs who stole\nsuch items as eggs or even soap and tissue rations while in prison. 65    Further, whereas the thefts of most\nshoplifters have personal gain as the typical motivation for the\nact, the acts of thefts of kleptomaniacs do not. In this regard,\nthe “gain” there is the relief obtained from the sense of the unbearable\nanxiety and tension prior to each episode of theft. Goods are not generally\nstolen for their material value, although Dr Phang took pains to point\nout that valuable objects may also on occasion be stolen by genuine kleptomaniacs.\nThis would, however, be the exception rather than the norm. In court,\nDr Phang stated that this would happen if the kleptomaniac concerned\nfelt his or her irresistible urges when in the vicinity of a valuable item\n- the urge to steal would then be relieved by the taking of such\nobjects, and the taking is not motivated by the material cost of\nthe object taken. 66    Finally, kleptomania is now thought\nto have a biological basis, a deduction supported by the efficacy\nof treatment with long-term medication. Elaborating in court, Dr\nPhang said that kleptomania is thought to be associated with the\ndeficiency of some neurological function of the brain. It is more\nprevalent among women. The behaviour may be sporadic with long intervals\nof remission, or may persist for years despite repeated prosecutions. In\nshort, it is an enigmatic condition, the diagnosis of which must\nnecessarily be made after the exclusion of all other causes of the\nrepeated thefts. In the context of the appropriate\nplace for specific deterrence when sentencing kleptomaniacs, Rajah\nJA said: 79    In\nmy view, the theory of “undeterribility”, as canvassed by Nigel Walker\nand Nicola Padfield inSentencing: Theory,\nLaw and Practice(Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1996) at p 99,\nis of keen relevance to the present case. As the learned authors\npoint out, there are some afflictions or ailments which render deterrence\nspecific to the offender futile. In particular, they state that “[m]ental\nillnesses can preoccupy or mislead sufferers to an extent that makes the\nconsequences of their actions irrelevant”. 80    Kleptomania can rightly be considered\none such ailment. By definition, it is animpulse\ncontrol disorderwhich subjects the sufferer to an intense\nand almost unbearable desire to steal. Further, kleptomania is thought\nto have a biological cause - this only serves to substantiate the\npoint that the sufferer may not be fully able to control his or\nher actions prior to and while committing the offence. Accordingly,\nonce kleptomania is properly established, it must be accepted that\nthe deterrence specific to the offender must necessarily be limited,\nbecause his or her futureactual commission\nof the offence concernedis not primarily deterred. [emphasis in original] Dealing with general deterrence,\nRajah JA said at[92]: … Perhaps one could argue that the prevalence\nof the offences by the respondent and the difficulty of detection\nand/or apprehension in shoplifting cases could warrant the imposition\nof a sentence which properly reflects the need for general deterrence,\nbut given the general “undeterribility” of kleptomania (see [79]\nabove), any general deterrence would be futile. 32     InLim Hock Hin Kelvin v Public Prosecutor[1998]\n1 SLR(R) 37 (“Kelvin Lim”), Yong\nPung How CJ, dealing with paedophilia, stated at[31]: There were no significant mitigating factors\nin this case. The learned judge had found, rightly in our opinion,\nthat paedophilia is not a disease or a physical illness but is a\ndisorder. According to theAmerican Psychiatric Association:\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(3rd\nEd, 1980), paedophilia is a condition where there is recurrent and\nintense sexually-arousing fantasies, sexual urges or sexual activities\ninvolving prepubertal children. Even if paedophilia is an illness,\nwe reject any suggestion that the sufferer cannot help it and therefore\ncarries only a diminished responsibility for his actions. There\nis no evidence that paedophiles cannot exercise a high degree of\nresponsibility and self-control. The learned judge found that the\nappellant had a choice of whether to commit paedophilic offences\nagainst the victims, and chose to do so. The psychiatrist who examined\nthe appellant expressed the opinion that treatment of paedophilia\nwas difficult. Given the high recidivism rate of offenders, the\nlearned judge took the view that the appellant had to be removed\nfrom society for a long period of time. 33     From\nthe foregoing, it is clear that bothGoh Yee\nLin(explicitly) andKelvin Lim(implicitly)\nhad examined thenatureof kleptomania\nand paedophilia respectively before deciding on the mitigating value\nto be attached to the disorder. Both kleptomania and paedophilia\nmanifest themselves in the very act criminalised. The High Court\ninGoh Yee Linand the Court of\nAppeal inKelvin Limcame to different\nconclusions on thenatureof kleptomania\nand paedophilia respectively and thus ascribed differing mitigating\nvalues to each of the mental disorders. The High Court attached\nsignificant mitigating value to the diagnosis of kleptomania because\nof the “undeterribility” of the disorder given that it is an impulse control\ndisorder and the “sufferer may not be fully able to control his\nor her actions prior to and while committing the offence”. In the\nlight of this, deterrence was rendered less effective and rehabilitation\nformed the primary focus. The Court of Appeal, on the other hand,\nattached little or no weight to the disorder of paedophilia since\nit rejected any “suggestion that the sufferer cannot help it and\ntherefore carries only a diminished responsibility for his actions”.\nThe Court of Appeal further concluded that there was “no evidence\nthat paedophiles cannot exercise a high degree of responsibility\nand self-control”. Both the High Court and Court of Appeal were\nfocused on the self-control or lack thereof of the sufferer of the disorder.\nThis to my mind is also the correct inquiry. In addition, if a significant\nlack of control is established, the circularity discussed above\nat[26], in\nthe context of the causal link for disorders which invariably manifest\nthemselves in criminalised conduct, disappears. A proper causal link,\nfree from circularity, from the disorder to the commission of the offence,\nis thus established. 34     However,\nI must add that these observations should generally be confined\nto cases where the disorder is one which invariably manifests itself in\ncriminal conduct (psychiatric descriptive labels of criminal/deviant conduct).\nWhere the disorder is one which may manifest itself in different ways,\nsome of which are criminal and others perhaps not, the concept of\na causal link is still relevant and useful. InLim\nGhim Peow, the appellant who was suffering from major\ndepressive disorder at the time of the offence, had doused his girlfriend\nwith petrol and set her ablaze with a lighter. The appellant was\ncharged and convicted of a charge of culpable homicide not amounting\nto murder under s 304(a) of the\nPenal Code and sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment. In dismissing\nthe appeal against conviction the Court of Appeal made the following\nobservations: 50    …\nWhile Dr Goh did state in the 2nd Psychiatric Report that the Appellant’s\nmajor depressive disorder would have impaired his degree of self-control\nand his decision-making capacity with regard to the offence, Dr\nGoh also opined in that report that the Appellant did not appear\nto lack “the capacity to comprehend the events or the capacity to\nappreciate the wrongfulness of his actions” (see [42] above). Dr\nGoh’s opinion was that the Appellant's major depressive disorder,\ncoupled with his violent and impulsive personality, led him to decide\non the course of action that resulted in the death of the Deceased.\nThis, however, did not mean that the Appellant could not comprehend\nthe gravity of his actions or the wrongfulness of his conduct. As\nboth Dr Goh and the Judge noted, the Appellant formed the intention\nto kill the Deceased some time before the commission of the offence,\nand carried out his plan in quite a meticulous manner. 51    The Judge therefore did not err in\ndrawing a distinction between, on the one hand, the present case\nand, on the other hand, cases where the mental disorder had completely\ndispossessed the offender of his awareness of the nature and illegality\nof his actions or where the offender had committed the offence on\nimpulse due to his mental disorder. Here, the Appellant had carefully\nplanned his moves - he had decided to take the Deceased's life and his\nown too, reasoning that if he could not have the Deceased, then\nno one else should have her. We should clarify at this juncture\nthat there is an erroneous statement of fact at [60] of the Judgment\n(quoted at [49] above). The Appellant was first diagnosed as having\na major depressive disorder in December 2011,beforethe\ncommission of the offence, and not (as the Judge stated) after his\narrest for the offence. However, this error was not material and\ndoes not detract from what we have said in the previous paragraph. 52    In the light of the nature of the Appellant's\nmajor depressive disorder and its effect on the commission of the\noffence, we were of the view that the Judge did not err in considering\nretribution and prevention instead of rehabilitation to be the primary\nsentencing principles that were applicable in this case. A mental\ndisorder, even if it substantially impaired the offender's mental\nresponsibility for the commission of the offence and thereby reduced the\noffence (in the context of the offence of culpable homicide under\ns 299 of the Code) from that of murder to that of culpable homicide\nnot amounting to murder, cannot be invoked as a blanket excuse for\nevery aspect of the offender's criminal conduct. In every case,\nit is imperative that the sentencing court examine the nature and\ngravity of the offender's mental disorder and its impact on the\ncommission of the offence before arriving at a sentence that takes\ninto account and balances the relevant sentencing objectives. … [emphasis in original] The major depressive order\ninLim Ghim Peowamounted to an\nabnormality of mind and there was a significant impairment of his\ndecision-making capacity with regard to the offence (at[42]). This, coupled\nwith the appellant’s already violent and impulsive propensity related\nto his personality attributes, resulted in him committing the offence.\nIt would be meaningful to speak of a causal link here to determine\nthe correlation between the disorder and the commission of the offence\nsince it is not riddled with the same circularity issues mentioned\nabove at[26].\nHowever, as seen from the above passage, the presence of the causal\nlink inLim Ghim Peowwas not a\nsufficient condition to the disorder being given significant mitigating\nvalue in the light of the particularly heinous nature of the crime. 35     With\nthe above in mind, I now turn to the expert evidence on the nature\nof voyeurism.",
        "Expert evidence on “voyeurism”": "36     The\nProsecution’s expert is Dr Stephen Phang Boon Chye (“Dr Phang”).\nHe is currently a senior consultant at the Department of General\nand Forensic Psychiatry at Institute of Mental Health, Woodbridge Hospital.\nHe is also an adjunct assistant professor at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical\nSchool and was until July 2013, a clinical senior lecturer at the Yong\nLoo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore.[note: 2] 37     Dr\nPhang refers primarily to the diagnostic criteria contained in both theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(American Psychiatric\nPublishing, 5thEd, 2013) (“DSM-5”) andThe ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural\nDisorders(World Health Organisation, 1993) (“ICD-10”)\nto form his opinion.[note: 3]Dr Phang also produces\nvarious secondary materials in support of his expert opinion. Dr Phang’s\nexpert opinion is summarised neatly in his medical report dated\n13 June 2014 as follows:[note: 4] In summary, I am of the considered opinion\nthat while Voyeuristic Disorder is indeed a diagnostic category\ndescribed in DSM-5 (‘Voyeurism’ in ICD-10), it merely represents\na clinical description of what is essentially a perverse behavioural\noption, principally characterized by the deviant desire to repeatedly\nobserve/record unsuspecting others in various compromising states/behaviours,\nprimarily for the purpose of self-sexual gratification. The behaviours\nassociated with this entity are usually deliberate, planned and\nwell within the self-control of the individual concerned. It does\nnot deprive the individual of the requisitemens\nrea, and should not, therefore, exculpate or exonerate. 38     Dr\nPhang testifies that voyeurism forms part of a general family known\nas paraphilias. Paraphilias include, for example, paedophilia, voyeurism\nand exhibitionism. According to Dr Phang: The term ‘paraphilia’ denotes … any intense\nand persistent sexual interestother thansexual\ninterest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with phenotypically\nnormal, physically mature and consenting human partners. A ‘paraphilic\ndisorder’ is a paraphilia which has caused distress and/or impairment\nto the individual, or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal\nharm, risk of harm to others.”[note: 5][emphasis\nin original] There are three general\ncharacteristics common to all paraphilias. Firstly, there is a longstanding,\nunusual and highly arousing erotic preoccupation which is dehumanised\nfor most of the adolescent and adult life of the person. The fantasy\nis often associated with preoccupying arousal and relies heavily\non the image of a partner who does not possess personhood. The paraphilic\nfantasies are conscious and clearly known to the individual. Secondly,\nthere is an urge to act out the fantasy or “to play out the imagined erotic\nscenario, which in more intense forms is described as an urge to\nact out the imagined fantasy in sexual behaviour”, usually in masturbation.\nThe acting out of the sexual fantasy is fundamentally motivated\nby a sexual behavioural aberration and is not driven by any form\nof irresistibility. “[T]he mental capacity to effect a behavioural\nchoicealways remains intact. It\nis basically a disordered sexualpreference,\nor, in simple layman parlance,a sexual deviancy.”\n[emphasis in original]. Thirdly, there is often significant, or\neven severe sexual dysfunction involving normal desire, arousal\nor orgasm with a partner, especially so in married individuals. “Paraphilias\naresexual identity disordersthat\nrender normal eroticism and sexual loveunattainable.”\n[emphasis in original].[note: 6] 39     Dr\nPhang attests that the diagnostic criteria for voyeurism (based\non the ICD-10 and DSM-5) are: (a)     Over\na period of at least six months, recurrent and intense arousal from\nobserving an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of\ndisrobing, or engaging in sexual activity, as manifested by fantasies,\nurges, or behaviours. (b)     The\nindividual has acted on these sexual urges with a non-consenting\nperson, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant\ndistress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important\nareas of functioning. (c)     The\nindividual experiencing the arousal and/or acting on these urges\nis at least 18 years of age. 40     Dr\nPhang also states that the diagnostic criteria for voyeurism apply\nif the disclosing individual “also reports subjective distress (guilt,\nshame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness), psychological problems,sexual impulsivity, or hypersexuality\nas a consequence of their voyeuristic sexual preferences”. [emphasis\nadded].[note: 7]Although\nDr Phang states that there is some form of sexual impulsivity, he\nclarifies that this impulsivity is a symptom and the presence of\nsome form of impulsivity on the part of the person diagnosed with\nvoyeurism does not make voyeurism a form of impulse-control disorder.\nDr Phang explains that the “inability to\nresistthe impulseis\nby definition the common core of all impulse-control disorders.” [emphasis\nin original].[note: 8]The\nimpulsivity is defined as the rapid and sudden expression of unplanned\nbehaviour and the primary connotation of impulsivity is the irresistibility\nof the urge to act.[note: 9]According\nto Dr Phang, the mental faculties of a person diagnosed with voyeurism\nare “often extremely nimble, with the unfettered ability to cogitate\nand plan coherently and deliberately” and in fact, in “order to\nsuccessfully carry out the voyeuristic fantasy, the individual is\ngenerally obliged to plan quite extensively, such as purchasing\nthe requisite paraphernalia, and then carefully (and often creatively)\nfacilitating the filming, or recording of voyeuristic images”.[note: 10] 41     The\nfollowing exchange also helps illuminate Dr Phang’s expert opinion[note: 11]: Q:Now, further down in paragraph (b), you state that “the drive-ness\nto act out this fantasy and---it’s not driven by any form of irresistibility.\nIn fact, the mental capacity to effect the behavioural choice always\nremains intact”. Can you elaborate on that, please?A:Yes, indeed, Your Honour. In the simplest possible terms, the\nability to effect a freewill choice is not taken away from the individual\nwho has a paraphilia. The urge and the desire may be there, but\nthat is another matter altogether. Fundamentally, there is still\na choice to say, “No” to the aberrant sexual behaviour or the abnormal\nparaphiliac behaviour. And that’s exactly what it means.Court:But is the choice one that is controllable or so uncontrollable that\nit’s impulsive and therefore not within his self-control?Witness:It is not clinically impulsive, Your Honour. It is---in other words,\nit is still controllable. It may be difficult to exercise control\nor to resist the urge, but the ability to take ow---to---to contain\nthese urges and these impulses remain unfettered.Court:It’s unfettered---of course the choice is there.Witness:Yes, Your Honour.Court:The critical question is whether it’s beyond his control.Witness:It is not, Your Honour. There is another diagnostic category for\nthat kind of issue, that kind of entity and tho---those are subsumed\nunder the rubric of “impulse control disorders”. And that, by definition,\nis an impulse that comes out of the blue, it is unplanned, it is\nunpremeditated, and it just happens. And the individual finds it\nimpossible or almost impossible to resist those impulses.…Court:… Is the diagnostic criteria of lack of control dependent\non it being an impulse? Can it be something which is non-impulsive\nbut is uncontrollable?Witness:Er,\nno, I do not think so, Your Honour. Not from a clinical perspective.   42     Therefore,\nDr Phang is clear that voyeurism does not deprive a person of self-control.\nAny impulsivity a person feels as a result of his voyeuristic tendencies\nis a symptom. This does not, however, make voyeurism an impulse-control\ndisorder which is the specific diagnostic umbrella in the DSM-5\nfor disorders which deprive a person of self-control. The following disorders\nare listed,inter alia, in the DSM-5\nunder the umbrella of impulse-control disorder: oppositional defiant\ndisorder, intermittent explosive disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial\npersonality disorder, pyromania and kleptomania. 43     Dr\nPhang then concludes in his report that voyeurism is merely a descriptive\ndiagnostic label for what is basically a perversion, or perverse form\nof behaviour which deliberately and wilfully intrudes into the inviolable\nsanctity and privacy of others. He stresses that it is not a mental illness\nwhich is beyond the conscious voluntary control of the individual concerned.[note: 12] 44     The\nexpert for the defence is Dr Tommy Tan Kay Seng (“Dr Tan”). He is\ncurrently a consultant psychiatrist in Novena Psychiatric Clinic, Novena\nMedical Centre. He was previously a senior consultant at Woodbridge\nHospital. He was also a visiting consultant at the Department of\nPsychiatry, Changi General Hospital, between 2012 and 2014.[note: 13] 45     Dr\nTan agrees with Dr Phang on several aspects including the diagnostic\ncriteria for voyeurism and the fact that it is not classified as\npart of the family known as impulse-control disorders. However,\nDr Tan states in his expert report that patients “with paraphilias\narecompelledto plan and to execute\nthese acts.”[note: 14][emphasis\nin original]. According to his report, the patient is compelled\nto plan and execute his acts in order to obtain sexual arousal.\nHe specifically states in his report that the respondent “was in\na position that he was not able to control his actions due to his mental\ndisorder” and that he “was compelled to buy the equipment or else he\nwould not be able to obtain his sexual arousal and satisfaction.”[note: 15]Dr Tan\nalso opines that the “causal link between a mental disorder and\nan offence need not necessarily be an inability to control an impulse\nsuch as in kleptomania or pyromania”; it could also be a compulsion.[note: 16] 46     Dr\nTan also refers to psychiatric literature which alludes to the impulsivity\nassociated with those diagnosed with paraphilias. Dr Tan finally disagrees\nwith Dr Phang’s description of voyeurism as a perverse behavioural\noption in that, according to him, Dr Phang’s analysis seems to suggest\nthat voyeurism is not a mental disorder “but a behaviour that a person\ncan choose to have or not to have.”[note: 17] 47     Having\nhad the benefit of reading the expert reports and hearing both experts\ngive oral testimony in court on 4 and 5 November 2014, I prefer\nthe expert opinion of Dr Phang as I find that it is more logical,\nand is corroborated by psychiatric literature and by another doctor\nwho examined the respondent. I also find that Dr Tan and Dr Phang\nare in agreement in many respects. 48     In\nchoosing between the two experts, I am aware that Dr Phang did not\nat any point examine the respondent but Dr Tan has had the benefit\nof examining the respondent. However, this point is irrelevant since\nthe prosecution does not seek to challenge the diagnosis of voyeurism.\nThe experts were engaged in order to assist the court in shedding\nlight on the nature of voyeurism – specifically whether it deprives\na voyeur of his exercise of self-control at the various stages of\npreparation to the stage when he acts out his fantasies. 49     Dr\nPhang has also stated the following in his evidence-in-chief which demonstrates\nhis clinical expertise when it comes to paraphilias in general:[note: 18] Q:Thank\nyou, Dr Phang. Dr Phang, in paragraph 6 of your report, you state\nthat your expert--- A:Mm. Q:---opinion is also based on your clinical\nexperience. Can you tell the Court how often you treat people with\nparaphilias? A:Your Honour, it would be a very difficult\nquestion to answer because it happens constantly, Your Honour. It’s---I\nhave been in forensic psychiatry for 16 years now and even before\nthat--- Q:Yes. A:---in my earlier psychiatric career,\nI encountered individuals with paraphilias or (sic)\none kind or another. So it would be impossible to put a number,\nif that is what the learned prosecutor is---but, er, it happens\non a regular basis, Your Honour. It is, in a manner of speaking,\nbread and butter. One of the bread and butter issues of forensic\npsychiatry. 50     In\nterms of credentials and relevant experience, both Dr Phang and Dr\nTan have impressivecurricula vitaewith\nvast clinical experience in their fields and have held high-level\nappointments. They have appeared as experts to assist the court\nin psychiatry-related matters over the years. 51     Dr\nPhang has emphasised that a person with voyeurism remains in full\ncontrol of his actions. Dr Phang however acknowledges that there\ncould be symptoms of impulsivity on the part of the person diagnosed\nwith voyeurism but the person at all times retains control over\nhis actions. Dr Phang explains the concept of impulsivity in his\nevidence-in-chief as follows:[note: 19] Q:Would\nyou agree that someone suffering from voyeuristic disorder would\nhave some problems with impulsivity? A:Of course, Your Honour, but that is\nimpulsivity in the layman understanding of the term. And here I\nemphasise that the difference is vital because the layman understanding\nof impulsivity is one issue and the clinical understanding of impulsivity\nas an impulse control disorder is another matter altogether. Q:So does the presence--- … ---of impulsivity as a symptom equate to\nany disorder being an impulse control disorder? A:No,\nYour Honour, not at all. It is settled psychiatry that many psychiatric\ndisorders will have impulsivity as a symptom and I have actually\nexplained this in my subsequent report, I believe dated 28th October.\nYou know, for example, a schizophrenic may act impulsively because\nhe’s disturbed by hearing voices. A person with mania who has got\nabnormally elated and elevated mood, Your Honour, may spend excessively,\nmay make faulty judgments and embark upon---such as, er, an individual\nI know who ordered three Jaguars---three Jaguar cars when he was\nin a manic state … Of course, a depressed individual may be impulsive\nand in the moment of impulse may commit suicide and jump off a building. So---so there are various aspects to impulsivity\nas a symptom versus the impulsivity of impulse control disorders,\nwhich are specific diagnostic umbrella entity in---in DSM, Your\nHonour. … Your Honour, an impulse---an individual\nsuffering from an impulse control disorder is, to put it very simply,\na sick person. All right, he---he experiences clinically significant\nimpulses which he cannot resist. You know, he may---he may pull\nout---or she or more often may pull out hair, which is---which is\nnot a normal activity - pull out his own hair from his head which\nis not a normal activity and they try their best to resist it because\nthey recognise the harmfulness of such behaviour. But they cannot\nresist it by definition; that is inherent in a definition of an\nimpulse control disorder. Whereas in voyeuristic disorder, there\nis usually no attempt to resist it because it is enjoyable; it is\nego-syntonic. It fulfils a purpose, Your Honour. One common observation,\nYour Honour, is that an individual with voyeuristic disorder may\nbe undergoing a period of stress, so they then engage in a voyeuristic behaviour,\nor paint the voyeuristic images in one way or another through deliberate\nand meticulous planning. After which, they then masturbate to---while\nwatching these obtained images and thereby obtain their sexual gratification,\nand the release of tension from their original stressor. And then\nthey move on in life, until the next stressor comes along. So that---it is---it’s just basically a\nmild adaptive response very often to---to stress, or it may not\neven be that at all. That is being rather kind to a---to the---to\na individual with voyeuristic disorder. Some individuals with voyeuristic\ndisorders simply just wish that is, in a nutshell, their sex life,\nYour Honour. They do not engage in a normal sex life with normal\nconsenting human partners and that has supplanted their sex life.\nIn other words, it is---becomes what we call “exclusive”. Every\nparaphilia has a---carries a qualifier, Your Honour. It could be\nexclusive, it could be non-exclusive. If it is non-exclusive, it means\nthat they engage in a paraphilic behaviour, whatever it may be, but\nthey also have a normal sex life. But---or it may be sub-par because for\nthe simple reason that, you know, it is basically---erm, they are\nalso basically preoccupied. Or it may be completely exclusive in\na sense that they have no normal sex life and they con---and their\nsex life consist of the voyeuristic behaviour or the paraphilic\nbehaviour. And they do not resist the impulse simply because it\noperates, as I stated earlier, on a pleasure principle and nothing\nmore. 52     Dr\nTan, as mentioned above, has stated that a person suffering from voyeurism\nis compelled to perform the acts to relieve the intense urges to perform\nsexual acts and feel a release of tension after the act. However, when\nquestioned further, Dr Tan seems to accept the distinction between impulsivity\nand a loss of control which characterises an impulse-control disorder:[note: 20] Witness:Well, the person what with a---with a cross-dresser fetishism could\nstop himself from buying a dress when he, you know, feels that,\nyou know, he shouldn’t do it. As such it’s not an absolute thing,\nYour Honour, nothing in life is absolute.Court:So relatively speaking---Witness:Relatively speaking he have this impulse to go and get it.Court:Yes, this impulse at the initial stages is much less.Witness:Yes, much less of course.Court:That you agree?Witness:Yes.Court:And then it builds up as he goes.Witness:It---it builds up, yes.Court:Okay, fine. I---from there I can understand.…At least that’s logical---…Court:---if you tell me the im---that the uncontrollable part is\nas much as the latest stages then I find that hard to accept.Witness:I---I agree with you, but he already make that plan already, is---that\nis all’s---Court:Of course you can plan.Witness:---it’s all part of that disorder.…Court:I don’t think Dr Phang would disagree with you on that maybe.Witness:I hope not.Court:That is gradually initially, you know---Witness:Yah.Court:---it’s low, you know, it’s not so---then you can stop it, towards\nthe end maybe you can’t stop.Witness:Yah.Court:Right?Witness:He can stop, in fact, Your Honour, the honest truth is they can\nstop anytime.Court:Are you telling me towards the end he can also stop anytime in\nthe sense---Witness:Yes, for example---Court:---that he can still pull back.Witness:---a patient with pyromania has this intense urge to set the fire---…---but the moment he realised that his act cannot be completed\nbecause there are policemen hanging around the warehouse.Court:He can stop.Witness:He will stop.Court:Okay. Ah, then I throw to the other side which is the im---real\nimpulse explosive type.Witness:Ah.Court:That one you cannot stop.Witness:Okay. First of all---Court:Will you agree with that, that’s the major distinction I’m looking\nfor.Witness:Yes. That one is---okay, that one the---it doesn’t have, okay,\nthe intermitted (sic) explosive\ndisorder; it’s a bit different from your usual type---Court:No, the question is those kind of disorder or the real explosive\ntype, one cannot stop it, right, it comes---the impulse comes, he\njust explodes. He very---is uncontrollable.Witness:He---he is quite uncontrollable.Court:Ah, so there lies the major distinction---Witness:Yes.Court:---which Dr Phang is talking about.Witness:Yah.…Witness:That one is really uncontrollable, I\nagree. …[emphasis added]   53     This\nshows that both Dr Phang and Dr Tan are in general agreement about\nwhat a proper loss of control entails and that voyeurism does not amount\nto this. In so far as Dr Tan is speaking about a person being compelled\nto act in a certain way, including the preparatory phases to facilitate\nthe commission of the voyeuristic act, Dr Phang accepts this impulsivity\nas a symptom. I am convinced by the explanation given by Dr Phang\nthat the compulsion here is not used in the strict clinical sense\nto mean a loss of control. In his report, Dr Phang states:[note: 21] Dr Tan has also apparently confused impulsivity\nas a symptom, versus impulsivity as manifested in Impulse-Control\nDisorders. It is settled psychiatry that impulsivity is, in fact,\na symptom which is frequently associated with almost any psychiatric\ndisorder – or, for that matter, it may not even be necessarily associated\nwith any formal disorder at all, but merely manifest as an expression\nof the individual’s underlying personality and constitution, and\nof the specific frustrations in his current social context. 54     I\nfind greater logical force in the opinion by Dr Phang. I find it difficult\nto accept that a person remains in a constant state of arousal due\nto voyeurism even throughout the preparatory phases which include\nthe purchasing of the paraphernalia and the attaching of a recording\ndevice to his body or placement of the recording device in an inconspicuous\nlocation to avoid detection. Such elaborate planning over a relatively\nlong period of time cannot be said to be done under compulsion,\nin the sense that it entails a total or even a significant and continuous\nloss of control throughout the preparatory stages to the eventual\nvoyeurism acts that constitute the offences in question. Dr Phang\nconvincingly states during cross-examination:[note: 22] Q:All\nright. And---so wouldn’t--- … Q:---those\nwith impulsive behaviour, when they do preparation work or purchasing\nto commit voyeurism, would---wouldn’t they be compelled by this\nimpulse control disorder to do that? Or if---oh, sorry, you said impulse\nbehaviour. … A:---when\nyou put the hypothetical situation to me about an individual who\ngoes and purchases the cameras and so on and so forth to perform the\nvoyeuristic act, to facilitate rather the voyeuristic act--- … A:---then,\nof course, at a 100% agreement I would say---I would concur that\nthat person is in full control of his actions, and this thoughts\nand his actions at that point in time. You know, and I think most psychiatrist\nwould disagree with that because it is simply premeditated. It is\npre-planned, it is deliberate, it is not something that happens\nout of the blue, you know, and therefore it---it must---that individual\nwho does--- … A:---must\nbe 100% in control of his thoughts and actions. So in that sense,\nthat’s what I meant. Q:And you say that’s in all cases with---you\ncan say that without--- A:Yes. Q:---treating or examining the patient\ninvolved or the person involved? A:Your Honour,\nif there is a significant amount of premeditation, deliberate action,\nthen it is clearly settled psychiatry that it cannot be an impulse\ncontrol problem. It is a contradiction in terms, in concepts, in\nfact. In psychiatric concepts. So, I disagree. [emphasis added in bold italics] 55     Dr\nPhang reiterates that voyeurism is not a mental illness and is only\na mental disorder insofar as it is included in the pages of the\nDSM-5.[note: 23]According to Dr Phang, it is a disorder\ninsofar as it represents a clinical description of an individual\nwho is seriously irresponsible, and who repeatedly transgresses\nagainst societal norms, rules and regulations.[note: 24]Dr Phang repeats in his report\nthat voyeurism is merely a descriptive diagnostic label for what\nis basically a perversion, or perverse form of behaviour which deliberately\nand wilfully intrudes into the inviolable sanctity and privacy of\nothers. Basically, acts of voyeurism are the result of conscious\nchoices made by the voyeur to satisfy a deviant desire. He stresses that\nit is not a mental illness nor it is a disorder beyond the control\nof the individual concerned.[note: 25] 56     Dr\nPhang accepts that voyeurism is mentioned in the ICD-10 and DSM-5\nbut further explains that the ICD-10 and DSM-5 are operationalised\ndiagnostic criteria developed to meet the needs of clinicians and\nresearch investigators, rather than the technical needs of the courts\nand legal professionals. He derives support for this from the following\nexcerpt from the “Cautionary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5”\n(reproduced in his report as follows)[note: 26]: …the use of DSM-5 should be informed by\nan awareness of the risks and limitations of its use in forensic\nsettings. When DSM-5 categories, criteria, and textual descriptions\nare employed for forensic purposes, there is a risk that diagnostic\ninformation will be misused or misunderstood. These dangers arise\nbecause of the imperfect fit between questions of ultimate concern\nto the law and the information contained in the clinical diagnosis. 57     Dr\nTan states in his report in reply to Dr Phang that psychiatrists\nand other mental health professionals can still use the DSM-5 and/or\nICD-10 to diagnose mental disorders. With the aid of the diagnostic\ncriteria, psychiatrists can confidently diagnose a person and also\ncommunicate that diagnosis to another health professional. However,\nhe alleges that Dr Phang has chosen to quote a limited portion from\nthe cautionary statement of the DSM-5 and this may result in a reader\nbeing misled to conclude that psychiatrists should not use the DSM-5\nor ICD-10 in diagnosing a mental disorder but only as a clinical\nguide when writing a forensic report.[note: 27] 58     I\nthink this is hardly the case. In fact, Dr Phang and Dr Tan are\nagain in agreement. Dr Phang is essentially saying that the DSM-5\nand ICD-10 are primarily used for the purpose of diagnosis which\nis in complete congruence with what Dr Tan is saying. Dr Phang is\nnot saying, as Dr Tan alleges, that the DSM-5 and ICD-10 should\nnot be used for purpose of diagnosis. What Dr Phang does say is\nthat one must be aware and cognisant of the fact that DSM-5 and\nICD-10 are developed to primarily aid clinicians in diagnosis. Therefore,\nDr Phang warns that care must be taken before these diagnostic labels\nare applied in a court of law. To me this is only logical. When\na clinician diagnoses, he does so primarily for the purpose of treatment\nof the individual. A court of law, when sentencing an individual, is\nconcerned with the appropriate punishment to be imposed given all\nthe circumstances of the case, including the psychiatric condition\nof the individual. Since there is a difference of purpose, Dr Phang\nwarns against the direct importation of these diagnostic criteria\ninto a court of law for forensic purposes. What this essentially\nmeans is that just because a disorder is stated or described in\nDSM-5 or ICD-10 does notautomaticallylead\nto it being a mitigating factor. This point, Dr Tan does not address. Moreover,\nDr Tan has constantly referred to voyeurism as a disorder because\nit is referred to in the DSM-5 and ICD-10. He seems to have taken it\nfor granted that just because voyeurism is mentioned in the DSM-5\nand ICD-10, it isautomaticallya\nmitigating factorper sewithout\nthe need to further establish whether or not the voyeur is able\nto control himself when he plans, takes preparatory steps and eventually\ncommits the acts of voyeurism. This is not correct. Counsel for\nthe respondent has also missed this point. In his written submissions,\ncounsel argues that “if Dr Phang is not prepared to hold Voyeuristic\nDisorder as a mental disorder, then it follows that all other disorders\nclassified under the DSM would also not be disorders, and this would\ninclude ‘impulse control disorder[s]’”. At the risk of repetition,\nI must stress that just because a disorder is included within the pages\nof the DSM-5 and ICD-10 does notautomaticallymean\na court of law will attribute weight to the disorder as a substantial\nmitigating factor for the reasons stated above. The diagnosis must\nbe supported by a clinical expert’s opinion on thenatureof\nthe disorder and how it affects an individual. 59     It\nfollows that even if a disorder is not included in the DSM-5 or\nICD-10 but a clinical expert explains the nature and seriousness\nof the mental disorder, and how it affects the individual and causes\nhim to commit the offences,and if the court\naccepts the expert’s testimony, then the court can ascribe\nthe appropriate weight to the disorder as a mitigating factor. This should\nnot be seen as a licence for counsel to raise reports pertaining\nto all sorts of disorders because the Prosecution will always be\nentitled to challenge the expert report by calling its own expert,\nwhich is exactly what has happened in this case. It is also apposite\nat this juncture to note that the court is entitled to reduce the\nweight attributed to remorse as a mitigating factor if unmeritorious\nNewton hearings are done such that time and costs are wasted (seePublic Prosecutor v Azuar Bin Ahamad[2014]\nSGHC 149 at [120]). 60     Finally,\nDr Phang’s opinion is supported by Dr Ravichandran Nigila (“Dr Nigila”)\nof the Institute of Mental Health, Woodbridge Hospital who had interviewed\nthe respondent. Dr Nigila opines in her report dated 15 July 2014\nthat the respondent was diagnosed with paraphilia but that he “did\nnot have any mental disorder and was not in a position where he\ncould not control his actions at the time the events happened”.[note: 28]This undergirds Dr\nPhang’s opinion that voyeurism (although mentioned in the DSM-5\nand ICD-10) is merely a descriptive label for a perverse form of\nbehaviour. Counsel for the respondent claims that Dr Nigila’s report\nis contradictory to the previous two reports prepared by Dr Nigala\n(dated 21 December 2012 and 7 February 2013). I do not agree. Dr\nNigila’s report on 15 July 2014 merely clarifies her earlier reports.\nDr Nigila has maintained that the respondent was diagnosed with\nvoyeurism but in the report dated 15 July 2014 explains that voyeurism\nis not a mental disorder nor does it deprive the person diagnosed\nwith voyeurism control over his actions. 61     In\nsum, I accept Dr Phang’s testimony that voyeurism is merely a clinical\ndescription of what is essentially a perverse behavioural option\nand that it does not deprive a person of his self-control in the\nway that an impulse control disorder does. I am thus satisfied that\nthe respondent had full control over his actions in the light of\nhis high degree of planning and premeditation when committing the\noffences. 62     Before\nI leave this point, counsel for the respondent has made much of\nthe fact that Dr Phang did not produce literature in support of\nhis opinion when Dr Phang was giving his oral testimony. Dr Phang\nexplained that these principles were to his mind elementary but\ncould nevertheless produce the literature in support of his opinion.\nDr Phang produced 13 secondary materials in support of his opinion\non the very next day. Counsel did not raise any more questions in\nrelation to the literature produced by Dr Phang. However in his\nwritten submissions, counsel has taken issue with Dr Phang’s reliance\non some of his literature. On the assumption that counsel is now\nallowed to challenge the reliance on the literature when he did\nnot raise these questions to Dr Phang during cross-examination,\nI find that his individual nit-picking at the literature that Dr\nPhang has produced does not detract from my assessment of his evidence.\nI agree that the literature produced does not unequivocally support\nDr Phang’s view but it also does not unequivocally support Dr Tan’s\nview. Counsel has tried to show that Dr Phang is theonly one in the worldto hold his view.\nI find that this is not borne out by his submissions. The literature\nshows that there is some support for both Dr Phang’s and Dr Tan’s\nview when it comes to the nature of paraphilias. However it must\nbe remembered that when the court assesses expert evidence, the\ncourt is scrutinising the expert witness as a whole including his\ncredentials, relevant experience, bases for the opinion and the\nconsistency and logic of his opinion (seeSakthivel\nPunithavathi v Public Prosecutor[2007] 2 SLR(R) 983\nat[74]–[76]). It is a holistic assessment\nof the expert witnesses and their evidence and it is on this basis that\nI prefer Dr Phang’s evidence.",
        "Appropriate sentence to impose": "Sentencing principles 63     It\nis pertinent to note that my conclusion on the nature of voyeurism,ie, it is merely a clinical description\nof what is essentially a perverse behavioural option and it does\nnot deprive a person of his self-control, is in line with the Court\nof Appeal’s assessment of paedophilia as a mitigating factor inKelvin Lim. As mentioned above at[38], voyeurism\nand paedophilia are both paraphilias. 64     In\nthe light of this, I am of the view that the Judge had erred in attributing\nsignificant weight to the fact that the respondent was suffering from\nvoyeurism such that the principles of deterrence were overridden.\nThe Judge had also erred in finding that the aggravating factors\npresent should be accorded little weight in the light of the respondent’s\ndiagnosis of voyeurism. Before dealing with the relevant aggravating\nand mitigating factors, I turn first to the two most relevant sentencing\nprinciples – deterrence and rehabilitation. 65     Both\ngeneral and specific deterrence are principles which should feature\nin the final sentence to be meted out. For the reasons submitted\nby the prosecution (see above at[15]), I am in agreement that general deterrence\nis particularly relevant. Given the fact that mobile phones with camera\nfunctions are now ubiquitous and that cameras with recording functions\ncome in all shapes, sizes and disguises and are getting cheaper\nto acquire, the perverse now find it easier to prey on unsuspecting\nwomen almost anywhere. As this case has demonstrated, even a home,\nwhich is often considered a sanctuary, is not free from the machinations\nof one determined to satisfy his deviant sexual fantasies. As shall\nbe observed, these were considerations that the court inAlbert Taytook into account when allowing\nthe Prosecution’s appeal against sentence. The need for general\ndeterrence is even more pressing now than during the time thatAlbert Taywas decided, given how far\ntechnology has advanced. Cameras have shrunk remarkably in size\nwhile the clarity with which images are captured has improved. The\nminiaturisation of cameras has made it increasingly easier for them\nto be concealed and harder for victims to detect, thereby encouraging\nvoyeurs to take more risks. This may in part explain why voyeurism\noffences are rapidly on the rise. In addition, the ease with which\nvideos can be uploaded onto the Internet for dissemination in this\nday and age further warrants the need for general deterrence. Unimaginable\nshame and distress to the victims may be caused if the videos are\ndisseminated worldwide via the Internet. Although in this case no videos\nwere uploaded and disseminated, the danger, which is not fanciful but\nvery real, that it could have happened is sufficient to warrant\na deterrent sentence. I am in full agreement that a strong message\nshould be sent to those who harbour thoughts of abusing these advancements\nin technology. 66     Specific\ndeterrence is also relevant given that I have found that voyeurism\nmerely represents a descriptive label for a perverse behavioural option\nand that it does not deprive the person diagnosed of his self-control. In\nany event, even Dr Tan has stated in cross-examination that those diagnosed\nwith voyeurism can be deterred by the threat of punishment.[note: 29] 67     Rehabilitation\nis also relevant given that even Dr Phang has testified that a person\ndiagnosed with voyeurism can be treated. Dr Phang explains the treatment\nmethods as follows[note: 30]: Q:Dr\nPhang, my final---my final question is with regards to treatment. Can\nyou turn to paragraphs 15 and 16? A:Yes. Q:Now, you talk---in fact, you gave the\nevidence earlier that a lot of the treatment involves counselling\nand envisioning of life goals. A:Yes. Q:But how about medication? Is there\nany medication to treat such conditions of voyeuristic disorder? A:Yes, indeed, Your Honour, and I myself\nprescribe such medication for similar disorders. But I emphasize\nthat we do not have medication which is specific for voyeurism,\nor voyeuris---or paraphilic disorders. What we use are selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors, very commonly, Your Honour, or SSRIs\nfor short, er, as it is commonly referred to in the profes---in\nour professional parlance. SSRIs are anti-depressants. They are\nnot anti-paraphilic, or anti-perversion drugs. Far from it. But\nwhat they are doing, Your Honour, is leveraging on the side effects\nof SSRIs, of these medications, to temporarily cut down the intensity\nof these deviant urges until more definitive management can be introduced.\n… Dr Tan has also testified\nthat the respondent has responded well to medical and psychological\ntreatment and has not re-offended since his arrest. The Judge was\nof the opinion that incarceration would be detrimental to the rehabilitation\nof the respondent and would “destroy the very last hope of… recovery”.\nI do not quite agree for the same sentiments expressed by the Court\nof Appeal inPublic Prosecutor v Kwong Kok\nHing[2008] 2 SLR(R) 684 at[37](see[23]above). There is similarly no\nsuggestion here that rehabilitation cannot take place in prison\nand continue even after imprisonment. Therefore, even though rehabilitation\nis a relevant sentencing principle, it does not automatically mandate\na lighter sentence. However, particular care must be taken when\nthe global sentence imposed is calibrated such that it is not such\na crushing sentence that may destroy any hope of recovery and reintegration\nof the respondent. Aggravating and mitigating factors 68     I\nagree with the prosecution that the factors listed above at[14]are aggravating\nfactors. It is trite that the presence of multiple and young victims\nare aggravating factors. Prof Andrew Ashworth explains succinctly in\nthe following passage why planning and premeditation is considered\nan aggravating factor (Andrew Ashworth,Sentencing\nand Criminal Justice(Cambridge University Press, 5th\nEdition, 2010) at p 164): … A person who plans a crime is generally\nmore culpable, because the offence is premeditated and the offender\nis therefore more fully confirmed in his criminal motivation than\nsomeone who acts on impulse, since he is more considered in his\nlawbreaking … Planned lawbreaking betokens a considered attack on\nsocial values, with greater commitment and perhaps continuity than\na spontaneous crime. The respondent had gone\nto great lengths in order to commit these offences. He had to purchase\nparaphernalia including mini-cameras and Blu-Tack. He then attached\nthe camera to his shoe and came up from behind the unsuspecting\nvictim at “Giant Hypermarket” in order to capture the “Up Skirt”\nvideo. To commit the offences at his girlfriend’s home, he had to\npurchase a camera which was cleverly disguised as a lighter to avoid detection.\nHe would wait for them to switch on the water heater before planting\nthe camera in the toilet and would later retrieve the camera after they\nshowered. His commitment to the criminal conduct was demonstrated by\nthe fact that he did this on more than one occasion and was also\nkeen on avoiding detection. In fact, he attempted to abscond when\nthe husband of the victim at Giant Hypermarket shouted at him. The\nlevel of consideration and planning to commit the offences and to\navoid detection is clearly an aggravating factor. The high degree\nof intrusion is also aggravating. Not only did the respondent record\nsome of the victims fully nude with moving images of their breasts\nand vulvas, it was done in the victims’ home, where he was a guest\nand where the victims would least expect to have their modesty violated.\nThis conduct constitutes a gross intrusion into the privacy of the\nvictims and should be given its due weight as an aggravating factor. 69     As\nfor the use of a recording device, I have noted earlier that the advancements\nin technology warrant a deterrent sentence because of the ease with\nwhich such offences may be committed and the ever present danger\nof the dissemination of the videos. The use of a recording device\nis an aggravating factor here for a different reason; mainly that\nthe videos can be replayed and the “fruits” of the criminal conduct\ncan be constantly revisited by the respondent. This again is clearly\naggravating. 70     The\nmitigating factors highlighted by the counsel for the respondent are\nlisted above at[18].\nI agree that the lack of antecedents is a mitigating factor. The\nfact that the respondent comes from a good family, has a bachelor’s\ndegree in business management and has put his further education\non hold because of this episode is neither mitigating nor aggravating. 71     I\ndo not agree that the lack of adverse effects on any of the victims\nand the fact that there was no circulation of the videos are mitigating.\nWhile adverse effects on the victims and circulation of the videos\nare definitely aggravating, the lack of these factors is not mitigating\nbut neutral at best. The respondent also relies on the fact that\nhis girlfriend’s family has been forgiving. The Court of Appeal\ninPP v UIhas stated that forgiveness expressed\nby the victim is a private matter between the offender and the victim\nand generally should not affect the appropriate sentence to be imposed\nby the court (seePP v UIat[56]–[57]). Therefore,\nI do not consider the forgiving attitude of the respondent’s girlfriend\nand her family as mitigating. 72     The\nmost significant mitigating factor in favour of the respondent is the\nremorse that he has shown since the commission of the offences.\nThe respondent has made a full confession and has cooperated with\nthe police in the course of their investigations. He has also pleaded\nguilty to the charges. I also note that the Judge had stated that\nthe respondent was suffering from significant depressive and anxiety\nsymptomatology related to the shame and stress from his commission\nof the offences (see[11]above).\nWhile I do not agree with the Judge that this means that there is\nno need to punish the respondent further, I am of the opinion that\nthe degree of shame and stress suffered is indicative of the extent\nof the remorse shown by the respondent. Furthermore, the respondent\nhas shown commendable commitment towards securing his own rehabilitation\nby seeking treatment and counselling since his arrest. As the Judge\nnoted, he had undergone regular treatment for three years since\nhis arrest and has been responding well to treatment. This is part\nof the reason why the respondent has not reoffended since his arrest\n(the other reason as noted above was the threat of legal proceedings).\nIn the light of this, I attach significant weight to the high degree\nof remorse shown by the respondent. Sentencing precedents 73     InAlbert Tay, the respondent pleaded guilty\nto two charges of intruding upon the privacy of a woman under s\n509 of the Penal Code. He placed a video camcorder in his bathroom\nto film, on separate occasions, the private moments of two female\ncolleagues while they used the bathroom. The respondent was convicted\nand a fine was imposed for each of the two charges by the magistrate.\nThe magistrate had referred to the earlier case ofTan\nPin Seng v PP[1997] 3 SLR(R) 494 (“Tan\nPin Seng”) where a fine was imposed on an offender who\nwas convicted of an offence under s 509 of the Penal Code for peeping\nat a lady taking a bath through a hole he had made in the bathroom\ndoor. InTan Pin Seng, Yong CJ had reduced\nthe one-month jail term imposed by the district court to a fine\nof $2000. InAlbert Tay, Yong CJ\ndistinguished his earlier decision ofTan Pin Sengand\nallowed the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence. In addition to the\nfine imposed by the magistrate, Yong CJ sentenced the respondent\nto one month’s imprisonment per charge to run consecutively. In\nhis decision, Yong CJ explained as follows: 19    It\nseemed very clear to me that the degree of culpability in the present case\nwas very much greater than that inTan Pin\nSeng's case for the peeping offence. In the present case,\nthere must have been a lot of meticulous planning on the respondent’s\npart in order to commit the offences. The respondent had to hide\nthe video camcorder in the basket of soft toys in the toilet and\nthen carefully position the lens to point at the toilet door. Furthermore,\nthe respondent had to switch the video camcorder to recording mode\nquickly and discreetly before he allowed each of [B] and [C] to\nuse the bathroom. Such amodus operandisurely\nrequired more planning and premeditation than peeping through a\nhole in the bathroom door. 20    I was therefore of the opinion that\nthe magistrate erred by likening the present situation to that inTan Pin Seng's case. I felt that the high\ndegree of planning needed for the commission of the present offences\nrendered the situation here more aggravating than that inTan Pin Seng's case. … 22    Unlike\nother “peeping tom” cases where the offender peeps at the victim\nin person at one moment in time, the respondent here did not actually observe\n[B] and [C] in their private moments in person. He chose to record their\nprivate moments on tape, so that he could watch them again and again for\nhis own perverted pleasure. The potential for repeated viewings\nmade the nature of the offences in the present case wholly distinguishable\nfrom that inTan Pin Seng's case. 23    … Video camcorders are available freely\nin this age of modern technology and policy considerations dictate\nthat a deterrent sentence has to be imposed to indicate that offences\nof this nature will not be tolerated. I cannot send a message to\nthe public that it is acceptable to make recordings of others without\ntheir knowledge as long as one has the financial resources to pay\na fine. It was fortunate that the video tape in the present case\nwas discovered by [B]. Should the tape have fallen into the hands\nof other third parties, the trauma and embarrassment that the victims\nwould have had to endure would have been unimaginable. The fact\nthat a victim's private moments could be recorded without the victim's\nknowledge and replayed over and over again for another's perverted\npleasure coupled with the risk of possible circulation of such tapes\nto other people compelled me to impose a custodial sentence in this\ncase to make it clear that the court does not condone such behaviour\nor treat it lightly. As was alluded to above,\nthe court inAlbert Taynoted the\nneed for a deterrent sentence given the ready availability of video\ncamcorders then. I have already found that the need for a deterrent\nsentence is even more pressing today given the advancements in modern\ntechnology. The court was also of the view that a custodial term\nwas more appropriate given the high degree of planning involved. 74     InPublic Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed\nMallik[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 (“Liton”),\nthe respondent was convicted of,inter alia,\na charge of insulting the modesty of a woman under s 509 of the\nPenal Code by taking four photographs of her in the nude. The trial\njudge had sentenced the respondent to three months’ imprisonment\nfor that particular charge. In dismissing the appeal against sentence\nbrought by the Prosecution in respect of that particular charge,\nthe Court of Appeal noted as follows: 87    The\nauthors ofSentencing Practice in the Subordinate\nCourts(LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) (“Sentencing\nPractice”) note (at p 329) that for the offence under\ns 509 in general, a fine of $1,000 to $2,000 is the norm: see, for example,Raveendran v PPMagistrate’s Appeal No\n125 of 1992 (unreported) andTan Pin Seng v\nPP[1997] 3 SLR(R) 494 . On the other hand, imprisonment\nis appropriate where aggravating factors are present: seeMohd Raus bin Othman v PPMagistrate’s\nAppeal No 17 of 1993 (unreported), where the offence was committed\nin a lift;Ramakrishnan s/o Ramayan v PP[1998]\n3 SLR(R) 161 , where there were multiple charges and the victims\nwere young; andPP v Johari bin SamadMagistrate’s\nAppeal No 69 of 1999 (unreported), where the offender had a previous\nconviction for a sexual offence. 88However, more\nrelevantly for the present case, imprisonment is also appropriate\nwhere the offence was carried out using modern technology to record\na victim’s private moments without her knowledge. InPP v Tay Beng Guan Albert[2000] 2 SLR(R)\n778  (“Albert Tay”), it was said\nthat such an offence differed from other \"Peeping Tom\" cases as\nthe recording on a tape could be replayed and there was also a risk\nof circulation of the tape to third parties. … … 89    Comparing\nthe previous sentencing precedents with the sentence imposed by\nthe trial judge, we were of the view that the sentence of three months’\nimprisonment was not manifestly inadequate. The facts of the present\ncase were similar to those inAlbert Tay…\nin so far as modern technology (the digital camera function of a\nmobile telephone in this case) was used to record the complainant’s\nprivate moments. The policy considerations that such recordings\n(digital photographs in this case) can be replayed and may be circulated\nto third parties were reflected in the trial judge’s imposition\nof a term of imprisonment in lieu of the norm of a fine of $1,000\nto $2,000. Compared to the one-month imprisonment imposed inAlbert Tayfor the video recording of\nthe victim bathing, and bearing in mind the circumscribed manner\nin which an appellate court will decide whether or not to interfere\nwith the sentence imposed by a court of first instance, the three\nmonths’ imprisonment imposed by the trial judge in the present case could\nnot be said to be plainly out of line with anestablished\nbenchmarkso as to be excessively inadequate… [emphasis added] A few observations are apposite.\nThe Court of Appeal referred toAlbert Tayas\nan established benchmark. The Court of Appeal also accepted that imprisonment\nis appropriate where the offence was carried out with the use of\nmodern technology in order to record a victim’s private moments. 75     InTan Huat Heng, the accused person pleaded\nguilty to four charges under s 509 of the Penal Code with four other\ncharges consented to being taken into consideration for the purpose\nof sentencing. The accused had used his camera in his iPhone to\ntake an “Up Skirt” video of a woman but was spotted by an off-duty\npolice officer. The victim was apparently unaware of what happened\nand had left the scene. The mobile telephone was seized and the\n“Up Skirt” video clip was found. Another mobile phone was seized\nfrom the accused and more “Up Skirt” videos were found which formed\nthe basis for the other charges. The magistrate considered the cases ofAlbert TayandLitonand\nimposed a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for each of the four\nproceeded charges and ordered that the sentences for two charges\nrun consecutively. On appeal to the High Court, Chan Sek Keong CJ\nset aside the sentence imposed by the magistrate and imposed a 12-month\nterm of probation with certain conditions. However, no written grounds\nwere issued by the court. 76     Counsel\nfor the respondent argues thatTan Huat Henghas\nsignalled a change in the sentencing philosophy when it comes to\noffences under s 509 of the Penal Code. I do not agree. There was\nno evidence of a high degree of planning and premeditation inTan Huat Heng. Furthermore, the videos did\nnot involve the same degree of intrusion into the privacy of the\nvictim as compared toAlbert TayandLitonwhere the victims were captured\nfully naked. The aggravating factors present inAlbert\nTayandLitonwere absent inTan Huat Hengwhich may explain why the\ncourt imposed a term of probation and not a custodial sentence. 77     On\nthe other hand, the Prosecution submits that the starting point\nfor offences under s 509 of the Penal Code involving the use of\na recording device should be a custodial sentence. I am of the opinion\nthat establishing a custodial benchmark along such lines may not\nbe appropriate given the myriad of ways that offences under s 509\nof the Penal Code may be committed with a recording device.Albert Tayinvolved planning and premeditation\nin the commission of the offence. BothAlbert\nTayandLitonhad a high\ndegree of intrusion into the privacy of the victim. While I am generally\nin agreement that a custodial sentence is warranted where the aggravating\nfactors such as multiple victims or young victims or the aggravating\nfactors inAlbert TayorLitonare present, I would be chary in concluding\nthat a custodial sentence should be the starting point the moment\na recording device is used. While I note that the use of a recording device\nallows the repeated viewing of the victim’s private moments, all other\nfactors should be considered before the final sentence is calibrated. Therefore,\nwhere there is no planning and premeditation and the intrusion upon\nthe privacy is not as grave as inAlbert TayandLiton, and where multiple victims or young\nvictims are not involved, such as inTan Huat Heng,\na custodial term may not be warranted. At the end of the day, each\nset of facts must be considered as a whole by the judge in determining\nthe appropriate sentence to be imposed. 78     On\nthe facts of the present case, due to the presence of the aggravating factors\nmentioned above at[14],\nespecially the fact that (a) there was a high degree of planning\nand premeditation; (b) the intrusion into the privacy of some victims\nwas grave and at the home of the victims; (c) there were multiple\nvictims and young victims; and (d) a miniature recording device was\nused,  and given that the need for general deterrence is greater\nnow than before due to the advancements in technology (see above\nat[15]),\nI am of the opinion that a term of four months’ imprisonment (which\nis approximately 18 weeks’ imprisonment) per charge under s 509\nof the Penal Code is appropriate. However, because of the mitigating\nfacts (see above at[72])\nand in particular the fact that he had pleaded guilty and has shown\nconsiderable remorse with a keen desire not to commit the offences again\nand to be fully rehabilitated, I impose a sentence of12 weeks’ imprisonment per charge. I\nnow deal with the conviction under s 30(1) of the Films Act. 79     InLui Chang Soon v Public Prosecutor[1992]\n1 SLR(R) 229, the appellant pleaded guilty to,inter\nalia, one charge of possession of 14 obscene videotapes\nunder s 29(1)(a) of the Films Act\n(Cap 107, 1985 Rev Ed). The magistrate had sentenced the appellant\nto a fine of $500 per tape ($7000 fine in total). The High Court\ndismissed the appeal against sentence in respect of above charge.\nThe High Court also found that punishment should be related to the\nnumber of films involved and not the number of tapes containing\nthe films. 80     The\nfollowing passage fromPractitioners’ Library:Sentencing Principles in the Subordinate Courts(LexisNexis,\n3rd Ed, 2013) at page 627–628 is useful: The primary concern in sentencing is the\nprotection of the public from moral corruption, and in particular\nyoung persons who may be tempted to view such films. As pointed\nout by the Minister for Information and the Arts in moving the Films\n(Amendment) Bill in Parliament, a disturbing trend in these offences\nis the proliferation of sale in public places. Examples cited were the\nincidences of flyers being stuffed into HDB letterboxes offering pornographic\nvideo tapes for sale to residents; and uncensored and obscene VCDs\nsold at pasar malams, trade fairs and other places. Technological advances\nhave made the production of such films relatively cheap. The illegal profits\nare very high. Detection and apprehension, on the other hand, is\n(sic) difficult as such operators\nusually operate from make-shift stalls or through pager/mobile phone\ncontacts. Even after raids, the sellers would sometimes return the\nnext day, selling the same obscene VCDs. The type and quantum of the sentence would\ndepend on the circumstances. In particular, the quality, nature\nand quantity of the films would be relevant. The issue of whether\nthere is any commercial gain should also be considered. A non-custodial sentence is reserved for\nisolated offences where the number of films is small (usually less\nthan 20), they are for personal use, where there is no commercial\nelement, and the accused (a first offender) has pleaded guilty. Where there is evidence of commercial exploitation,\na custodial sentence can be expected. In such cases, the prosecution\nusually prefers a charge of carrying on a business of distributing\nfilms without a licence in contravention of s 6(1)(a)\nin addition to the charge of distributing or having possession for the\npurposes of distributing in contravention of s 29(3)(a). In cases where obscene VCD inlays\nare exhibited for purposes of advertisement, another charge under\ns 292(1)(a) of the Penal Code is\nalso usually preferred. The length of the custodial sentence will\ndepend on the scale of the operation, the quantity and nature of\nthe films, whether there has been a plea of guilt coupled with co-operation\nin the investigation or a contested case, and the character of the\noffender. 81     InPublic Prosecutor v Tan Hiap Hua[2010]\nSGDC 322 (“Tan Hiap Hua”), the accused\npleaded guilty to a single charge of possession of 38 obscene films\nunder s 30(1) of the Films Act. The 38 obscene films were found\nin his mobile phone. In sentencing the accused to three months’ imprisonment,\nthe district judge noted that the number of films was large and\nthat it was “certainly unusual to store 38 obscene films in a handphone for\nprivate viewing”. The district judge also considered that the long\nlist of antecedents of the accused including offences of possession\nof obscene films for which he was sentenced to five years of corrective\ntraining. On appeal, V K Rajah JA allowed the appeal against sentence\nand reduced the sentence to one of six weeks’ imprisonment. No written\ngrounds were issued. 82     InPublic Prosecutor v Yang Qiuyu[2010]\nSGDC 51, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge of possession\nof 204 digital video discs containing 179 films without a valid\ncertificate approving the exhibition of the films under s 21(1)(a) and one charge of possession of 96\nfilms which were obscene under s 30(1) of the Films Act. The accused\nhad various antecedents including a conviction under s 29(3)(a) of the Films Act (for distributing\nobscene films or having them in possession for the purposes of distributing).\nIn sentencing the accused to the minimum specified penalty of $100\nfor each film without a valid certificate ($17,900 in total) and\n$500 for possession of each obscene film (amounting to $20,000 as\ncapped by law), the court noted that the number of films was certainly\nnot on a small or low scale and that a custodial sentence for the\noffence under s 30(1) of the Films Act would ordinarily be meted\nout. Nevertheless, the court was minded not to impose a custodial\nsentence as the obscene DVDs “were not on display blatantly but\ncontained in a haversack”. 83     InPublic Prosecutor v Mohamad Hanafi Bin Abdol Hamid[2007] SGDC\n247, the accused, who was a police officer, had pleaded guilty to\nfour charges including one charge under s 30(1) of the Films Act\nfor possession of two digital discs containing two obscene films\nand one charge under s 30(2)(a)\nof the Films Act for possession of nine films known by him to be obscene.\nThe district judge noted that the number of films involved was small\nand that a fine would be appropriate in the circumstances. The sentenced\nimposed was the minimum specified sentence of $500 per film ($1000\nin total) under s 30(1) and $1000 per film ($9000 in total) under\ns 30(2)(a) of the Films Act. 84     Finally,\nin the case ofPublic Prosecutor v Chandran\ns/o Natesan[2013] SGDC 33, the accused pleaded guilty\nto various charges including one charge of possession of 291 obscene\nfilms under s 30(1) of the Films Act. Initially, the accused was\nfound suitable for a mandatory treatment order (“MTO”) and thus\nordered to undergo a MTO for psychiatric treatment for one year.\nHowever, the MTO was revoked by the district judge who found that\nthe accused had breached the requirement of attending before the\nIMH doctor as required under the MTO and that the accused was not\ncompliant with his medication. The district judge then considered\nthe accused’s delusional disorder, his plea of guilt and discounted\nhis antecedents as they were dated and not of a similar nature, before\nsentencing the accused to a $500 fine per film (capped at $20000). The\nsentences for all the other offences were fines as well. 85     In\nthe instance case, it is unclear from the statement of facts, whether the\n10,574 obscene films were merely short video clips or full-length obscene\nmovies. The fact that they were all on his computer and hard drive suggests\nto me that they were more likely to be short video clips as I doubt that\n10,574 full-length obscene movies could be stored on the computer hard\ndisk and one external hard drive. Having 10,574 short obscene video clips\nwould be much less serious than having the same number of full-length\nobscene films. 86     Giving\nthe respondent the benefit of the doubt that they were all short video\nclips and taking into account his plea of guilt, the extent of the remorse\nthat he has shown and the fact that he did not exploit them for\nany commercial gain, I am of the view that the appropriate sentence\nfor the charge under s 30(1) of the Films Act is animprisonment term of four weeks. A fine\nwould not be adequate because of the very large number of video\nclips involved.  If the respondent had not pleaded guilty and shown the\ndegree of remorse that he did, a stiffer custodial sentence of six\nweeks’ imprisonment would have been meted out. It may be pertinent\nto note here that had I sentenced the respondent to a fine for this\ncharge under the Films Act instead of a term of imprisonment, the\nrespondent would be worse off as his total imprisonment sentence\nwould be much higher as I would have no alternative but to order,\npursuant to s 307 of the CPC, that at least two sentences for the\noffences under s 509 of the Penal Code to run consecutively (see[88]below). These\nare heavier imprisonment sentences than the sentence I have imposed\nfor the Films Act offence. On top of the extended global term of\nimprisonment, the respondent would also have to pay a fine, which\nwould not have been insubstantial. 87     I\nalso note that the accused inTan Hiap Huahad\nbeen sentenced to an imprisonment term of six weeks for possession\nof 38 obscene films. However, the accused inTan\nHiap Huahad been previously convicted of offences of\npossession of obscene films for which he was sentenced to five years\nof corrective training. The respondent here had no such related antecedents. 88     Having\ndecided that the appropriate sentence for the each of the offences\nunder s 509 of the Penal Code and s 30(1) of the Films Act is 12 weeks\nand four weeks respectively, I now consider which sentences should run\nconsecutively. I am bound to order at least two terms of imprisonment to\nrun consecutively pursuant to s 307 of the CPC. InMohamed\nShouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor[2014] 2 SLR 998,\nSundaresh Menon CJ explained that the “sentencing judge is vested\nwith considerable discretion, but this must be exercised judiciously\nand with regard to two principles in particular, namely, the one-transaction\nrule and the totality principle, as well as a number of ancillary\nprinciples” (at[25]).\nIn this case, I am of the view that there is no need to order more\nthan two sentences to run consecutively, or to order two sentences\nunder s 509 to run consecutively, which would then have raised the\ntotal sentence to 24 weeks. I therefore order that one charge under\ns 509 of the Penal Code (namely MCN 686 of 2012) and one charge\nunder s 30(1) of the Films Act (namely MCN 692 of 2012) are to run\nconsecutively. The remaining sentences will run concurrently. The\nglobal sentence imposed on the respondent is aterm\nof imprisonment of 16 weeks.",
        "The sentence is wrong in law": "89     Finally,\nI also note that both the Prosecution and the respondent have submitted\nin the court below that the punishment prescribed under s 30(1) of\nthe Films Act is not one which is fixed by law, nor a mandatory minimum\nsentence or a specified minimum sentence. However, this was before\nthe case ofMohamad Fairuuz bin Saleh v Public\nProsecutor[2015] 1 SLR 1145 (“Fairuuz”)\nwhere the High Court explained the proper interpretation of those\nphrases as they appear in s 5 of the Probation of Offenders Act\n(Cap 252, 1985 Rev Ed) (“POA”). Section 5 of the POA provides as follows: Probation 5.—(1)\nWhere a court by or before which a person is convicted of an offence (not\nbeing an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law) is of the\nopinion that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature\nof the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient\nto do so, the court may, instead of sentencing him, make a probation\norder, that is to say, an order requiring him to be under the supervision\nof a probation officer or a volunteer probation officer for a period\nto be specified in the order of not less than 6 months nor more\nthan 3 years: Provided that where a person is convicted\nof an offence for which a specified minimum sentence or mandatory\nminimum sentence of imprisonment or fine or caning is prescribed\nby law, the court may make a probation order if the person — (a)    has attained the age of\n16 years but has not attained the age of 21 years at the time of\nhis conviction; and (b)    has\nnot been previously convicted of any such offence referred to in\nthis proviso, and for this purpose section 11(1) shall not apply\nto any such previous conviction. InFairuuz,\nMenon CJ explained the proper interpretation of s 5 of the POA: 9    In\nsummary, pursuant to the opening paragraph of s 5(1) of the POA (which\nwe shall refer to as the principal part of s 5(1)), where an accused person\nis convicted of an offence which is punishable by a sentence that\nis fixed by law, probation is generally not available as a sentencing\noption for the court. However, pursuant to the Proviso, where a\nperson is convicted of an offence for whicha\nspecified minimum sentence or mandatory minimum sentenceis\nprescribed, probation may be ordered if the two conditions in the Proviso\nas encapsulated in subsection (a) and (b) are satisfied. … 17    Having\ncarefully considered the various arguments in the round, we concluded\nthat the terms “sentence fixed by law”, “mandatory minimum sentence”\nand “specified minimum sentence” carry the following meanings: (a)    A\n“mandatory minimum sentence” means a sentence where a minimum quantum\nfor a particular type of sentence is prescribed, and the imposition\nof that type of sentence is mandatory. (b)    A “specified minimum sentence” means\na sentence where a minimum quantum for a particular type of sentence\nis prescribed, but the imposition of that type of sentence is not\nmandatory. (c)    A sentence “fixed by law” is one where\nthe court has absolutely no discretion as to the type of sentence\n(which is mandatory) and the quantum of the prescribed punishment. [emphasis in original] 90     At\nthis juncture it would be useful to set out s 30(1) of the Films\nAct: 30.—(1)\nAny person who has in his possession any obscene film shall be guilty\nof an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not\nless than $500 for each such film he had in his possession (but\nnot to exceed in the aggregate $20,000) or to imprisonment for a\nterm not exceeding 6 months or to both. In my opinion, s 30(1) of\nthe Films Act has a specified minimum sentence. The court when sentencing\nunder s 30(1) of the Films Act has the discretion to choose between\na fine, a term of imprisonment or both. Thus, the imposition of\na fine is not mandatory but if the court does choose to impose a\nfine, there is a minimum quantum of $500 which is prescribed and\nwhich must be imposed by the court. Therefore, probation can only\nbe ordered if the two conditions encapsulated in subsections (a)\nand (b) of s 5 of the POA are satisfied. The respondent in this\ncase was 29 years old at the time of his conviction. He has therefore\nnot satisfied subsection (a) of s 5 of the POA and probation is\nnot available as a sentencing option. In this regard, the sentence\nimposed by the Judge was also a sentence which was wrong in law. 91     This\nleads to a final question of whether probation is nevertheless available\nas a sentencing option for the respondent for the other five charges\nunder s 509 of the Penal Code. This pertains to a more general question\n– if a person is convicted of multiple charges in which one of the offences\ndoes not allow for probation as a sentencing option, can the court nevertheless\norder probation for the rest of the convictions where probation is\navailable. However, since I have not had the benefit of argument\non this issue and I have found that a sentence of probation for\nthe charges under s 509 of the Penal Code is manifestly inadequate\nin this case, I leave the question open for reconsideration at a\nmore appropriate juncture.",
        "Conclusion": "92     In\nsum, I allow the prosecution’s appeal against sentence. The sentence\nof probation meted out by the Judge is manifestly inadequate. I substitute\nthe sentence of probation with a term of imprisonment of 16 weeks.  [note: 1]ROP Vol 1 Page 12. [note: 2]Annex B of Dr Phang’s\nReport dated 13 June 2014 (“Dr Phang’s First Report”).
