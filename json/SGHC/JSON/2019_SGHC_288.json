        "Background facts": "5 The following facts are not substantially in dispute. 6 Sometime in August or September 2013, Mr Kam approached Mr Chang for a loan to be used as “working capital” for PT ARI.8Foot Note 8×MCAEIC, para 5.PT ARI operated a rubber factory in Aceh, Indonesia.9Foot Note 9×DKAEIC, para 3.Both Mr Kam and Mr Chang agreed that the borrowing entity would be a Singapore incorporated company, PEM.10Foot Note 10×MCAEIC, para 7.PEM was a company controlled by Mr Kam.11Foot Note 11×MCAEIC, para 8. 7 On 23 September 2013, AIL loaned US$500,000 to PEM with interest payable at 1% per month. The loan was to be repaid on 31 December 2013 (“the 2013 loan”).12Foot Note 12×ABDV1, pp 8 – 9.On the same day, Mr Kam provided a personal guarantee to AIL guaranteeing the repayment of this sum.13Foot Note 13×ABDV1, p 10.By mid-January 2014, only US$150,000 had been repaid by PT ARI (on behalf of PEM) to AIL.14Foot Note 14×SOC, paras 7-8.AIL agreed to extend the repayment date of the balance sum to 31 December 2014.15Foot Note 15×ABDV1, pp 19-20. 8 Subsequently, AIL loaned a further sum of US$650,000 to PEM at the same rate of interest of 1% per month. This was due to be repaid by 31 December 2014 (“the 2014 loan”). Mr Kam gave another personal guarantee on 16 March 2014 to AIL guaranteeing repayment of the 2014 loan. 9 AIL now claims against Mr Kam under both contracts of personal guarantee for the outstanding sums owed by PEM under the 2013 and 2014 loans. 10 The relevant terms of both personal guarantees are as follows:16Foot Note 16×Plaintiff’s Set down Bundle (“PSB”), pp 146-147; DKAEIC, p 177. I, [Mr Kam], personally guarantee to you [AIL]… any obligation of [PEM] and hereby agree to bind myself to pay you on demand the sum which may become due to you by the company whenever [PEM] shall fail to pay the same. It is understood that this guarantee shall be a continuing and irrevocable guarantee and indemnity for such indebtedness of [PEM].",
        "The defendant’s case": "11  Mr Kam denied that he was liable under the personal guarantees. He relied on an agreement which he characterised as a “joint venture” between PEM, PT ARI, APTSA, ARI, and AIL. I refer to this as “the Agreement”. In his view, the Agreement novated the 2013 and 2014 loans from PEM to ARI (a company controlled by Mr Chang) on the date of the Agreement. As the underlying loan agreements were novated, he submitted that his liability as guarantor fell away. Mr Kam also relied on Clause 5(e) of the Agreement as extinguishing his liability under the personal guarantees on the date of the Agreement. 12 Further, Mr Kam alleged the existence of a collateral oral agreement reached on 24 July 2015 which discharged his liability as guarantor. 13 Lastly, Mr Kam submitted that AIL is estopped from denying that his liability under the personal guarantees had been discharged.17Foot Note 17×PSB, p 117 at paras 27-28.",
        "The plaintiff’s case": "14 AIL adopted a different view from Mr Kam on the significance and contractual effect of the Agreement. It submitted that Clause 5 of the Agreement should be interpreted contextually. In its view, the “proper context” was that AIL entered into the Agreement because PEM was unable to repay the outstanding loans owed to AIL.18Foot Note 18×MCAEIC, paras 26-28; Bundle of Affidavits of Evidence in Chief (“BAEIC”) Vol 1, pp 8-9; TJSAEIC, paras 7-8.The Agreement was meant to embody a “turnaround plan” in which AIL would take an equity stake in APTSA and, in the process, receive dividends which it would use to repay the outstanding sums owed to it. In exchange, AIL would agree to the novation of the 2013 and 2014 loans. This would discharge PEM of its outstanding liabilities and extinguish Mr Kam’s liabilities under the personal guarantees. Given the “proper context”, AIL submitted that both parties could not have intended for the liabilities of PEM and Mr Kam to be extinguished on the date of Agreement. On the contrary, their liabilities would only be dischargedafterthe “turnaround plan” was fully implemented. 15 Further and in the alternative, AIL claimed that the Agreement should be rescinded by virtue of Mr Kam’s misrepresentations and/or breach of warranties. The misrepresentations and/or breach of warranties related to two matters. First, PT ARI’s production capacity. Second, Mr Kam’s failure to disclose that not all of the sums loaned by AIL were used for PT ARI’s factory (which was the very reason why the loans had been extended in the first place), but were siphoned off to various third parties. 16 Lastly, AIL rejected Mr Kam’s argument that it was estopped from denying that he was liable under the personal guarantees.",
        "Issues to be determined": "17 The issues are: (a) whether the Agreement novated the 2013 and 2014 loans from PEM to ARI in September 2015 (there is some dispute between the parties on the relevant date to be applied. I address this at [20]–[22]); (b) did the Agreement discharge, as at the date of the Agreement, Mr Kam’s liabilities under the personal guarantees; (c) was there a collateral oral agreement between Mr Chang (on behalf of AIL) and Mr Kam entered into on 24 July 2015 which discharged the latter’s liability under the personal guarantees; (d) should the Agreement be rescinded for misrepresentation and/or breach of warranties; and (e) whether the defence of promissory estoppel arises in favour of Mr Kam such that AIL can no longer call on the personal guarantees.",
        "Issues 1 and 2: Interpretation of the Agreement": "18 The first two issues will be dealt with together. 19 Mr Kam did not dispute either the existence of the 2013 and 2014 loans and that a total of US$1,000,000 (excluding interest) was due and payable to AIL by PEM as at 31 December 2014. Neither did he challenge the existence of the two contracts of personal guarantee with AIL. 20 Relying on Clauses 5(d) and 5(e) of the Agreement,19Foot Note 19×BAEIC, Vol 2, at p 835.Mr Kam’s defence to AIL’s claim was that, based on his interpretation of the clauses, his liability under the personal guarantees was discharged “immediately” (ie, instantaneously) on the date of the Agreement.20Foot Note 20×SDB, p 114 at [25]. 21 I noted in [17a] above that there was a disagreement between the parties regarding the date on which both parties entered into the Agreement. According to AIL’s pleadings, the relevant month in which the Agreement was entered into was September 2015.21Foot Note 21×SDB, p 132 at para 18(i).AIL, however, departed from its pleaded position during cross-examination and in its written submissions. It took 3 November 2015 to be the date of the Agreement. However, Mr Chang’s affidavit stated that AIL entered into the Agreement “[o]n or about 29 September 2015”.22Foot Note 22×MCAEIC, para 36.More significantly, the date stated on the Agreement itself is September 2015, although the precise day of the month is left blank.23Foot Note 23×MCAEIC, MC-1, pp 131. 22 Mr Kam argued that AIL should not be permitted to alter its position, given that it had pleaded that the Agreement was entered into in September 2015. 23 In the circumstances, I adopt September 2015 as the month in which the Agreement was concluded. In any case, the difference in the dates makes no material difference to the contractual analysis below. The crux of Mr Kam’s case is that the loan agreements had been novated “immediately” (ie, on the date of Agreement).  As both September 2015 and the later date referred to in AIL’s written submissions (ie, 3 November 2015) have passed, novation would have already taken place on either date (assuming that I accept Mr Kam’s interpretation of the Agreement).",
        "The law": "105 The relevant law may briefly be summarised as follows: (a) The doctrine of promissory estoppel requires an unequivocal representation by one party that he will not insist upon his legal rights against the other party, and such reliance by the representee will render it inequitable for the representor to go back upon his representation:Audi Construction Pte Ltd v KianHiap Construction Pte Ltd[2018] 1 SLR 317 (“Audi Construction”) at [57]. (b) The determination of whether the representations are “clear and unequivocal” is an objective question to be considered in the particular context of each case:Neo Hui Ling v Ang Ah Sew[2012] SGHC 65 at [54].76Foot Note 76×DBOA, Tab 11. (c) Mere silence or inaction will not normally amount to an unequivocal representation:Audi Constructionat [58]. However, “in certain circumstances, particularly where there is a duty to speak, mere silence may amount to [such] a representation”. (d) Whether there is a duty to speak is a question which must be decided having regard to the facts of the case at hand and the relevant legal context. The “duty to speak” does not refer to a legal duty as such but to circumstances in which a failure to speak would lead a reasonable party to think that the other party has elected between two inconsistent rights or will forbear to enforce a particular right in the future:Audi Constructionat [61]. (e) For a “duty to speak” to arise, it must be shown, at least, that the silent partyknewthat the party seeking to raise the estoppel was in fact acting or proceeding with its course of conduct on the basis of the mistaken belief which the former is said to have acquiesced:The “Bunga Melati 5”[2016] 2 SLR 1114 at [17].",
        "Analysis": "71 It is undisputed that Mr Kam met up with Mr Chang, Mr Yeo, Ms Tan on 24 July 2015 at Infraavest’s office.48Foot Note 48×DKAEIC, para 59. 72 Mr Kam alleged that, during the meeting, an oral agreement was reached with Mr Chang (who acted on behalf of AIL) that he would procure APTSA to enter into a “joint venture agreement” with PEM, PT ARI, AIL, and ARI. In exchange, AIL would agree to release him from his liabilities under the personal guarantees.49Foot Note 49×DKAEIC, para 59.The other terms of the alleged oral agreement include:50Foot Note 50×DKAEIC, para 60. (a) Mr Chang would take over control of the operations of PT ARI’s rubber factory; and (b) the debts of APTSA and PT ARI would be restructured so that companies controlled by Mr Chang (which would include AIL) would be responsible for paying off their own portions of the debts owed to APTSA and/or PT ARI, and the other shareholders of APTSA and/or PT ARI would be responsible for paying off the other debts of APTSA and/or PT ARI. 73 AIL’s position was that the discharge of Mr Kam’s liability under the personal guarantees was neverdiscussed during the meeting on 24 July 2015. Instead, the meeting was to discuss the numbers behind the proposed investment into PT ARI.51Foot Note 51×MCAEIC, para 74.It also submitted that the oral agreement “defence” was only an afterthought as it was included in Mr Kam’s defence as an amended pleading in Defence (Amendment No.1).52Foot Note 52×PCS at para 104. Documentary evidence 74 The starting point of my analysis is the Agreement itself. As stated above, the Agreement,inter alia, provides for the discharge of Mr Kam’s personal guarantees after certain events have taken place. These events are the payment of dividends by APTSA to ARI, novation of PEM’s loans to ARI, and PEM’s dissolution after settling its outstanding liabilities. 75 On the contrary, under the alleged oral agreement, all that Mr Kam was required to do was to procure APTSA to enter into the “joint venture” before all his liabilities under the personal guarantees would be discharged. The fact that this discharge hinged on an entirely different condition (especially one that was relatively simple for Mr Kam to performquadirector of APTSA) as compared to the more onerous conditions in the written Agreement gives me the impression that the allegation of an oral agreement is an afterthought. There appears to me no credible explanation as to why there was aneedfor a lengthy written Agreement, carrying with it entirely different conditions which would trigger discharge of Mr Kam’s liability, if there had indeed been an oral agreement in which liability was discharged after procuring APTSA’s involvement. If there had been in reality an oral agreement between the parties, I would have expected Mr Kam (or any of his representatives) to have written to AIL soon after procuring APTSA’s involvement on 27 July 2015. But this was not done. In the circumstances, I do not accept Mr Kam’s assertions and find that he has not proven the existence of the oral agreement. 76 For completeness, I consider the documentary evidence that Mr Kam relied on to support his version of events. Primarily, this is in the form of an email sent out by Ms Tan to Mr Tin on 27 July 2015,53Foot Note 53×DKAEIC, para 61; see also DKTL, Tab 26 for a copy of the email.three days after the meeting on 24 July 2015.  The email attaches adraftcopy of the Agreement,54Foot Note 54×Defendant’s Bundle of Affidavits of Evidence in Chief (“DBAEIC”), Volume I of II, p 278.and contains the following clause: “…the existing loan sits in PEM, where 100% shares are currently held in name of [Mr Kam] on behalf of APTSA (there is a trust document in place). Since [AIL] is responsible for its own loan, 100% shares shall be transferred to [AIL] or its representative to hold in name on behalf of [APTSA].The personal guarantee given by [Mr Kam] shall also be dissolved with effect (currently there is a back-to-back guarantee from PT ARI to [Mr Kam]” [emphasis added]. 77 Given that the clause explicitly referred to the dissolution of Mr Kam’s personal guarantees and that this email was sent merelythreedays after the meeting on 24 July 2015, I find that the topic of the discharge of Mr Kam’s liability was likely discussed during the meeting. However, on the face of the clause, there is nothing that indicates that Mr Kam’s liabilities would be “immediately” discharged solely in exchangefor him procuring APTSA’s involvement. 78 It is also telling that Mr Kam failed to point toany email or correspondencebetween the parties after 24 July 2015 where parties explicitlyacknowledgedthat Mr Kam’s liabilities had been immediately discharged, save for the email sent to Ms Tan by Ms Pang on 18 November 2015.55Foot Note 55×DKAEIC, p 660.This email56Foot Note 56×DKAEIC, DKTL-41, pp 659 – 664.included a copy of Mr Kam’s first personal guarantee dated 23 September 2013, with the word “cancelled” stamped on it. The email with the “cancelled” guarantee attached to it is not good documentary evidence of the alleged oral agreement. If Mr Kam genuinely believed that this act of unilateral cancellation would dissolve the guarantees, why did the email attach only the personal guarantee dated 23 September 2013 and not also the one dated 11 March 2014? Further, there was no follow-up by Mr Kam or any of his representatives after 18 November 2015 confirming that the personal guarantees had been discharged. This was yet another indication that Mr Kam never genuinely believed that the personal guarantees had dissolved, whether on 24 July 2015 or subsequently. 79 It must also be borne in mind that the alleged oral agreement was said to have been formed on 24 July 2015. In this regard, the correspondence immediately following the meeting on 24 July 2015 would be particularly illuminating on the existence of the oral agreement.  The emails that were sent out after 24 July 2015 referred to many matters which related to the “joint venture” between the parties. For instance, the email sent out by Mr Tin to Ms Tan on 2 September 2015 referred to PEM’s outstanding loan, the contracting parties to the Agreement, as well as queries on when APTSA would inject the funds into PT ARI.57Foot Note 57×BAEIC, Vol 2, p 538.The matter of novation was also discussed: there was an email sent out to Ms Tan stating “…could you help us draft a simple novation agreement?”. Ms Tan replied saying “OK, I will think about how to draft…currently have no template so need time to think about it”.58Foot Note 58×BAEIC, Vol 2, p 656.However, there was anoticeable absenceofanydiscussionof Mr Kam’s personal guarantees and their discharge on 24 July 2015 in the immediate period thereafter. I would expect, having regard to the nature of the oral agreement which was alleged (as well as the potential extinction of Mr Kam’s liability under the personal guarantees), for there to be at least some subsequent acknowledgment or correspondence betweenbothpartieson the topic of personal guarantees. Commercial context 80 The issue of the existence of the oral agreement should also be approached with regard to the commercial context. I noted above that the objective of the Agreement was for parties to rescue PT ARI from its financial problems (see at [53]), so that it could repay its outstanding loans (which were owed through PEM as the borrowing entity). I also held that it would have been commercially insensible for AIL to give up its only form of security,ie, the personal guarantees, in exchange for nothing. Similarly, it would have been illogical for AIL to give up its only form of security simply for Mr Kam to procure APTSA to enter the “joint venture”. In this regard, I agree with Mr Chang’s evidence that it would be illogical for him to release his leverage over Mr Kam in respect of PT ARI’s turnaround.59Foot Note 59×MCAEIC, para 76. 81 In summary, I find that there was no oral agreement between AIL and Mr Kam reached on 24 July 2015 for the “immediate” dissolution of his personal guarantees. Both the contemporaneous documentary evidence and the commercial context do not support its existence and are, in fact, inconsistent with it.",
        "Issue 3: Existence of a collateral oral agreement?": "69 This issue concerns an alleged oral agreement reached on 24 July 2015.47Foot Note 47×DKAEIC, para 57.",
        "Issue 4: Misrepresentation and/or breach of warranties": "82 AIL, in its closing submissions, claimed that Mr Kam had made the following two misrepresentations: (a) that PT ARI’s factory had a production capacity of 1000 tons/month;60Foot Note 60×PSB, p 143, para 18(x)(b)(i).and (b) that PTI ARI had the necessary capacity to produce output of 50 containers worth of Standard Indonesian Rubber 20; 83 In addition, AIL alleged that Mr Kam made a third misrepresentation by omitting to mention that a US$100,000 loan was extended from PEM to Create Asia Limited (“CAL”).61Foot Note 61×SDB, p 146, para 18(x)(b)(viv). 84 The first alleged misrepresentation was contained in a series of presentation slides sent by Mr Kam on 10 June 2015 while the second was in a verbal conversation between Mr Chang and Mr Kam sometime before the Agreement was signed. 85 AIL also alleged that these misrepresentations constitute breach of warranties under the Agreement, in particular Clause 1.3(f).",
        "Misrepresentation": "Defect in pleadings 86 Mr Kam raised two primary objections to AIL’s claim for misrepresentation. First, he submitted that AIL failed to particularise the form of misrepresentation it was relying on,ie, whether it was fraudulent, negligent or innocent. Second, he argued that the failure to plead that it had suffered any loss as a result of misrepresentation meant that AIL cannot claim under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed).62Foot Note 62×DRS, paras 34 and 35. 87 The failure to specify the type of misrepresentationper sedoes not render a pleading defective if it is otherwise clear what the allegation is. There is support for this inBOM v BOKand another appeal[2019] 1 SLR 349 at [41]. Although AIL failed to particularise its claim, it is apparent that it was alleging innocent misrepresentation. There is no mention of dishonesty or fraud, or any of the elements of negligent misrepresentation, which might have suggested a claim in fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation. The law 88 The Court of Appeal inLim Koon Parkand another v Yap Jin Meng Bryan and another[2013] 4 SLR 150 (“Lim KoonPark”) stated the relevant legal principles in relation to an actionable misrepresentation: (a) an operative misrepresentation is a false statement of existing or past fact made by one party before or at the time of making the contract, which is addressed to the other party and which induces the other party to enter into the contract (at [38]); (b) section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act does not alter the common law as to what constitutes a misrepresentation but reverses the burden of proof so that the party who made the representation has to show reasonable grounds to believe that the fact represented was true (at [39]); (c) the presumption of reliance is that if the representation is material, the onus would lie on the representor to show the representee’s lack of reliance (at [52]); and (d)  the presumption is not a legal presumption but is a presumption of fact and may be rebutted by counter-evidence (at [53]); and (e) the presumption of reliance is not mandatory but optional and a court may choose to apply the presumption, depending on the factual matrix (at [54]). Production capacity of 1000 tons a month 89 The first statement made by Mr Kam was that the Aceh factory had a production capacity of 1000 tons/month. 90 According to Mr Kam, the production capacity refers to “what the equipment or machines in the entire production line put together is purportedly capable of at peak efficiency”.63Foot Note 63×DKAEIC, para 127.In other words, the reference to production is tofuturecapacity and notactualcapacity at the time the statement was made. In Mr Kam’s view, this was also supported by the fact that the presentation slides were accompanied by aproposalon how PT ARI could increase production to 1000 tons/month.64Foot Note 64×MCAEIC, para 131. 91 AIL, in its written submissions, did not challenge Mr Kam’s position that his representation was as to the factory’sfuture capacity. Neither did it do so in cross-examination. Instead, AIL adopted the position that the operative representation made by Mr Kam was that “only the sum of USD 123,538.46 …was needed … to increase capacity of the Rubber Processing Plant”.65Foot Note 65×PCS, para 115.In other words, the representation was that the rubber factory would be able to produce 1000 tons/month so long as Mr Kam received the stated sum of money. Unfortunately for AIL, this is not contained in its pleadings. There is no reference to any representation made by Mr Kam that he would ensure that the factory would produce 1000 tons per monthonthe conditionthat AIL provided specified sums of money.66Foot Note 66×PSB, pp 143 – 144. 92 All that AIL has pleaded is that “[Mr Kam] represented to AIL and in consideration of his doing so warranted that: …PT ARI’s rubber processing plant had a conservative production capacity of at [sic] 1,000 tons per month…”.67Foot Note 67×Reply Amendment (No.3), p 20. 93 AIL is bound by its pleadings. The burden rests on AIL to prove the falsity of Mr Kam’s representationon the basis of its pleaded case. As AIL adduced no evidence to show that PT ARI wasincapableof producing 1000 tons/month, I find that AIL has not proven the falsity of the representation. 50 containers of Indonesian Rubber 20 94 Although AIL stated in its written submissions that Mr Kam had made a representation that the rubber plant had the necessary capacity to produce 50 containers worth of Standard Indonesian Rubber 20,68Foot Note 68×PCS, para 110.this was not adequately pleaded. 95 AIL pleaded as follows:69Foot Note 69×PSB at pp 143-144. (x)(b)(i) [Mr Kam] represented to [AIL] and in consideration of his doing so warranted that: a. PT ARI’s rubber processing plant had a conservative production capacity of at [least] 1,000 tons per month. (x)(b)(ii)The said representationsand/or warranties were made by and/or are to beinferredfrom: a. [Mr Kam] had sent presentation slides sent to [AIL] by email on 10 June 2015, which inter alia contained the following statements: “Production Capacity Our lines are rated at 3 tons/hour (could exceed assumptions) Conservatively assuming we operate at 2.5 tons/hour Conservative production would be at least 1,000 tons/months i.e. 12,000 tons/year”. b. Sometime before parties executed the Agreement, [Mr Kam] had verbally represented to the [Mr Chang] of AIL that PT ARI’s factory facilities had the necessary capacities to produce output of 50 containers worth of Standard Indonesian Rubber 20 (SIR 20, equivalent to TSR 20). [emphasis added] 96 The verbal representation allegedly made by Mr Kam to Mr Chang regarding the factory’s capacity to produce 50 containers of Standard Indonesian Rubber 20 was only a representation from which the representation that “PT ARI’s rubber processing plant had a conservative production capacity of at least 1,000 tons per month” was to beinferredfrom. It was not a separate representation in AIL’s claim for misrepresentation. There is only one representation founding AIL’s claim for misrepresentation in paragraphs 5(x)(b)(i) and 5(x)(b)(ii), and I have already dealt with this above at [89]–[93]. Omission to mention the CAL loan 97 Mr Kam stated in his affidavit that the sum of US$100,000 which was provided by AIL to PEM was loaned to a company known as Create Asia Limited (“CAL”).70Foot Note 70×MCAEIC, para 20.AIL claimed that it only found out that the US$1,000,000 loan sum was not entirely transferred from PEM to PT ARI sometime in January 2016.71Foot Note 71×MCAEIC, para 20. 98 Even if I accept that the omission constitutes a false representation of fact, AIL’s claim fails. There is no evidence in the affidavits of Mr Chang or Mr Tin from which I can infer that AIL would not have entered into the Agreement if Mr Kam had not omitted to mention the CAL loan. This is not an instance where it is possible to apply a presumption of reliance as a “commonsense inference” (Lim Koon Parkat [54]). On the contrary, the evidence shows that AIL had compelling commercial reasons for entering into the Agreement, in particular to secure repayment of the substantial sums owed to it, and would have entered into the Agreement even if it had known about the CAL loan. As inducement has not been proved, I dismiss AIL’s claim. 99 For the above reasons, I dismiss all of AIL’s claims in misrepresentation.",
        "Breach of warranties": "100 AIL relied on Clauses 1.3, 1.3(f), 11, and the Appendix in the Agreement in its claim for breach of warranties.  They read as follows:72Foot Note 72×MCAEIC, MC-1, pp 137 – 138. 1.3 The following representations and warranties are made and given by [APTSA] to ARI and expressly survive the closing of this agreement. The representations are true as of the date of this agreement and will be true as of the date of closing when they shall continue as warranties according to their terms. At the option of ARI, the representations and warranties may be treated as conditions of the closing of this agreement in favour of ARI. However, the closing of this agreement shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise result in a merger to deprive ARI of the right to sue the Company for breach of warranty in respect of any matter warranted, whether or not ascertained by ARI prior to closing: (f) [APTSA] has made full and fair disclosure in all material respects of any matter that could reasonably be expected to affect ARI’s decision to purchase the Shares on the terms set out in this agreement. 11. All amendments, deletions or additions to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by both Parties. [Mr Kam] and [Mr Yeo] shall warranty that the Group’s financial statements are fairly disclosed to ARI and the completeness of legal licenses are sufficient and appropriate to manufacture and export SIR20. APPENDIX The existing directors of [APTSA] warrant the accuracy of the following statements and documents and that they are true and accurate. … 4) The detailed info provided in Appendix “Loan Status” 5) The detailed info provided in Appendix “Financial statements” 101 AIL’s allegation of breach pursuant to Clause 1.3(f) of the Agreement is unsustainable. Clause 1.3(f) clearly states that the obligation is forAPTSAto make “full and fair disclosure”, not Mr Kam. AIL did not suggest that this clause could be interpreted to include Mr Kam owing a duty of “full and frank disclosure”. As Mr Kam owes no duty of full and frank disclosure pursuant to Clause 1.3(f), he could not possibly have committed a breach of warranty under the said provision. 102 Equally unsustainable is AIL’s claim for breach pursuant to Clause 11 of the Agreement. The clause provides that Mr Kam shall warrant that the Group’s (ie,PEM, PT ARI and APTSA) financial statements are fairly disclosed toARI. In its submissions, AIL failed to cite evidence that the Group’s financial statements were notdisclosed toARI. Also, AIL did not cross-examine Mr Kam on his alleged failure to fairly disclose the Group’s financial statements toARI. Given that there is no evidence of a failure to disclose matters toARI, I find that Mr Kam did not breach Clause 11. 103  The preamble to the Appendix provides that Mr Kam shall warrant the accuracy of the “…detailed info provided in Appendix ‘Loan Status’” and “…detailed info provided in Appendix ‘Financial statements’”. Unfortunately for AIL, it failed to raise anything in the evidence which was false vis-à-vis the “detailed info” provided in the parts titled “Loan Status” or “Financial Statements” under the Appendix. AIL’s main argument in support of its claim for breach of warranty was premised on Mr Kam’s failure to disclose certain loan agreements involving PEM. Ultimately, this had to be tied explicitly to some information which was contained in the parts titled “Loan Status” and “Financial Statements” in the Appendix. AIL failed to do this. In the premises, there is no evidence that Mr Kam breached the term in the Appendix.",
        "Issue 5: Promissory Estoppel": "104 Mr Kam relied on three representations made by AIL in support of his estoppel argument: (a) First, Clause 4 of the Agreement accompanied by ARI’s subsequent action of disbursing US$320,000 to PEM.73Foot Note 73×DCS, para 146. (b) Second, Clause 5(e) which states that “the personal guarantee given by [Mr Kam] shall also be dissolved with immediate effect”. (c) Third, “silence or inaction”74Foot Note 74×DCS, p 45.when AIL failed to demand repayment despite PEM failing to repay the outstanding loan sums.75Foot Note 75×DCS, para 148.",
        "The first representation": "106 Clause 4 of the Agreement reads as follows: a) ARI shall inject USD 750,000 via convertible loan into [APTSA]. The USD750,000 loan shall be converted into 82,274.85 of shares at USD9.1157869 each, this shall acquire for a 70% equity stake in [APTSA] (referring to Participating Shares). This shall be by way of new issuance of Participating Shares in [APTSA]. b) The convertible loan injection shall be in tranches, likely to be in four (4) tranches, to be decided at the discretion of ARI. c) ARI reserves the right to terminate the turnaround plan should it not work out. d) Further to the injection of USD 750,000.00, in the circumstance that the business requires additional funding, [APTSA] shall raise additional capital by way of new issuance of participating shares. All participating shareholders shall be invited to participate in the additional raise in accordance to pro-rated % of shareholding, and if participating shareholders are not willing to inject additional funds in accordance to pro-rated % of shareholding, their respective shareholding shall be diluted from the new issuance event. As a note, ARI is willing to inject up to USD 250,000.00. 107 In my view, there is nothing in Clause 4 which contains a “clear and unequivocal” representation that Mr Kam’s liability as a guarantor will be discharged. Clause 4 simply describes part of the turnaround plan which was intended by both parties to rescue PT ARI from financial trouble. The significant part of the turnaround plan described here is the injection of US$750,000 into APTSA in the form of a “convertible loan”. Mr Kam also pointed to the fact that there was a subsequent disbursement of US$320,000 from ARI to PEM after the Agreement was signed. I take him to be saying that this was an implied representation that AIL would no longer call on the personal guarantees given by Mr Kam. Far from carrying this implication, I find that ARI’s disbursement of US$320,000 simply shows that it had sincerely intended to satisfy its obligations under the Agreement. In any case, I see no logical reason whyARI’sdisbursement of money toPEMwould mean thatAILwas representing that it would no longer call onMrKam’spersonal guarantees.",
        "The second representation": "108 Clause 5(e) of the Agreement contains the term, “(t)he personal guarantee given by [Mr Kam] shall also be dissolved with immediate effect”. I have already determined that the phrase “immediate effect” cannot be interpreted to mean the personal guarantees are discharged on the date on which the Agreement was signed. Given this interpretation, Clause 5(e) is not a “clear and unequivocal” representation that Mr Kam’s guarantees will be discharged as of the date of the signing of the Agreement.",
        "The third representation": "109 Mr Kam submitted that AIL’s failure to demand repayment also constituted a “clear and unequivocal representation” from AIL that his guarantees would be discharged on the date the Agreement was signed. He relied on the following strands of evidence. 110  First, that Mr Chang possessed the knowledge that the parties to the Agreement proceeded with the investment in PT ARI in the belief that the two loan agreements would be restructured and that he would be released from the personal guarantees.77Foot Note 77×BAEIC Vol 2, p 648.Second, both Mr Chang and Mr Tin requested for an update to be made to the APTSA investors, whereupon they were informed that Mr Chang would “take over the responsibility of the USD1,000,000 debt plus interest which he had previously lent”78Foot Note 78×Reply (Amendment No.3), p 48.APTSA for the PT ARI rubber factory. Third, AIL did not demand repayment for the two loan agreements from the time the Agreement was entered into. 111 In order for AIL’s failure to demand repayment (or silence) to constitute an unequivocal representation, Mr Kam must show, on the basis of the evidence which he presented, that AIL had a duty to speak. This is one of the requirements set out by the Court of Appeal inAudi Constructionat [61]. At the very least, Mr Kam must demonstrate that AIL had the knowledge that he was proceeding with his course of conduct on the basis of a mistaken belief,ie, that AIL would not call on the personal guarantees.  Unfortunately for Mr Kam, he failed to present any evidence from which I could infer such knowledge. Mr Chang’s request for an update from the APTSA investors is likewise equivocal, and something which any reasonable investor would do in the circumstances. There is no reason why Mr Kam would perceive this request for an update as a representation that his personal guarantees would be discharged. 112 I therefore dismiss all of Mr Kam’s allegations of estoppel.",
        "Conclusion": "113 For the above reasons, I allow AIL’s claim under the contracts of personal guarantee but dismiss its claims for misrepresentation and breach of warranties. 114 I will hear counsel on the question of costs.  Dedar Singh GillJudicial Commissioner Mathiew Christophe Rajoo and Gerard Nicholas (DennisMathiew) for the plaintiff;Tham Wei Chern, Chuah Hui Fen Christine and Shirlene Leong Hong Mei (Fullerton Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant."
