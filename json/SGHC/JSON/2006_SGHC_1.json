        "Originating Summons No 204 of 2004": "56        Leivest’s claims are dismissed. For the avoidance of doubt, I find that Top Ten had breached the terms of settlement of 31 October 2003, but I also find that Leivest has waived the breaches. 57        In respect of Top Ten’s counterclaim, I find that Top Ten is entitled to remove its tenant’s fixtures at the termination of the lease. The parties should be able to identify the tenant’s fixtures between themselves. They will revert to me on any areas of disagreement.",
        "Suit No 809 of 2004": "58        Top Ten’s claim for specific performance is allowed, and Leivest’s counterclaim is dismissed.",
        "Whether Top Ten had repudiated the settlement agreement of 31 October 2003": "24        I will take the complaint over the late payment of the interest on the maintenance charges first as it is the less substantial complaint. 25        There was no doubt that the interest was payable. Top Ten had never taken the position that it was not going to pay the interest. The cause of the delay in payment was that Top Ten wanted a reduction of the interest. Top Ten was negotiating with the Management Corporation for it. After it failed to get a reduction, it made the full payment of $3,295.50 on 12 November 2003, which was received by the Management Corporation in satisfaction of its claim for interest. 26        In negotiating with the Management Corporation on the sum to be paid, it was seeking to discharge that duty by paying a smaller sum. Although there was a breach of the settlement agreement, the late payment did not result in any loss or prejudice to Leivest. Leivest’s actions after the late payment also had a significant bearing on the consequences of the late payment. 27        The other complaint was about the late payment of the $20,000 costs. The payment was tendered by cheque and received in time, but the cheque was dishonoured because there were insufficient funds. When the payment was tendered subsequently by cash, it was late. 28        There was no issue about the liability to pay or the amount to be paid, or the time the payment was to be made. Top Ten was informed on 8 November 2003 that its cheque was dishonoured, and the payment in cash was not made till 12 November 2003. 29        Had Top Ten breached its undertaking to pay those costs? It did not make payment immediately when it was informed of the bounced cheque. The failure amounted to a repudiation and could have brought the settlement agreement to an end if Leivest had accepted the repudiation. 30        Did Leivest accept the repudiation? Its solicitors, Peter Pang & Co, wrote to Top Ten on 10 November 2003 and gave Top Ten notice to deliver up possession. That, on its face, was an acceptance of the repudiation if matters ended there. 31        However, when payment was tendered two days later to Peter Pang & Co it acknowledged receipt “without prejudice to our clients, Leivest’s rights and we have no instructed [sic] otherwise”. 32        What was the effect of the acceptance of the payment? The $20,000 costs were payable only as part of the settlement of 31 October 2003. Outside of the settlement, there was no liability or agreement for Top Ten to pay $20,000 to Peter Pang & Co. 33        Leivest cannot accept the payment and deny the subsistence of the agreement under which the payment was tendered. By accepting the payment, it acknowledged that the agreement was in force on 12 November 2003. 34        The acceptance of the $20,000 payment on 12 November 2003 was not the only obstacle to Leivest’s assertion that the settlement agreement was terminated. 35        If the settlement agreement was repudiated by Top Ten’s failure to pay the $20,000 on 5 November 2003, and the 31 October 2003 lease was also terminated (as Leivest also asserted), there was no basis for Leivest to demand rent from Top Ten. 36        But by issuing the rent invoice on 1 December 2003, Leivest held itself out to be entitled to receive rent from Top Ten. That is only consistent with the subsistence of the lease at that time, for that was the only basis on which rent was payable. 37        Leivest acknowledged receipt of the payment in a letter to Top Ten bearing the caption “Re: Rental December 2003” stating: We have received on 1 December 2003 a cheque of $52,000.00 and we are holding your payment strictly without prejudice to all our rights at law. If this arrangement is not acceptable to you, we will be happy to return the same to you on receipt of your letter requesting for the return. and enclosed a receipt marked “Without Prejudice” which referred to the “proposed payment for rental”. 38        The receipt did nothing to change the picture. Counsel for Leivest suggested that the rent payment was sent out before the rent invoice was received by Top Ten. The evidence on the sequence of events was inconclusive, and the issue was irrelevant. Leivest’s need to bring up this issue only underscored its anxiety over the rent invoice. All that really mattered was that Leivest requested for the rent unconditionally and Top Ten tendered rent unconditionally on 1 December 2003. That was sufficient to show that on 1 December 2003, neither the 31 October 2003 settlement nor the lease of that date was repudiated. 39        These issues have been addressed in judicial pronouncements of good authority. InCentral Estates (Bulgaria) Ltd v Woolgar (No 2)[1972] 1 WLR 1048, the tenant was convicted of unlawfully keeping a brothel on the premises under lease. The landlords’ agents issued instructions that no rent was to be demanded or accepted from him. However, through a clerical error, a demand for rent was sent to the tenant, and the rent was paid and accepted. 40        The English Court of Appeal had to decide whether there was a waiver of the right of forfeiture. Lord Denning MR held at 1052: Was this rent demanded and accepted by the landlords’ agents with knowledge of the breach? It does not matter that they did not intend to waive. The very fact that they accepted the rent with the knowledge constitutes the waiver. Buckley LJ examined the issue in greater detail at 1054–1055: The landlord’s right is a right to elect whether to treat the lease as forfeit or as remaining in force. Any election one way or the other, once made, is irretractable:Scarf v. Jardine(1882) 7 App.Cas. 345,perLord Blackburn at p. 360. If the landlord by word or deed manifests to the tenant by an unequivocal act a concluded decision to elect in a particular manner, he will be bound by such an election. If he chooses to do something such as demanding or receiving rent which can only be done consistently with the existence of a certain state of affairs, viz., the continuance of the lease or tenancy in operation, he cannot thereafter be heard to say that that state of affairs did not then exist. If at the time of the act he had a right to elect whether to forfeit the lease or tenancy or to affirm it, his act will unequivocally demonstrate that he has decided to affirm it. He cannot contradict this by saying that his act was without prejudice to his right of election continuing or anything to that effect. In this respect his act speaks louder than his words, because the act is unequivocal: it can only be explained on the basis that he has exercised his right to elect. The motive or intention of the landlord, on the one hand, and the understandingof the tenant, on the other, are equally irrelevant to the quality of the act. 41        The effect of “without prejudice” receipts was considered a long time ago inDavenport v The Queen(1877) 3 App Cas 115, a decision of the Privy Council from Australia. Sir Montague E Smith put it succinctly at 132 that: [W]here money is paid and received as rent under a lease, a mere protest that it is accepted conditionally and without prejudice to the right to insist upon a prior forfeiture, cannot countervail the fact of such receipt. 42        InWindmill Investments (London) Ltd v Milano Restaurant Ltd[1962] 2 QB 373, rent was paid and the landlord’s receipt stated expressly that “This receipt is given without prejudice to the following breaches of covenant …”, with a breach spelt out. There was a dispute whether the receipt constituted a waiver of the breach. Megaw J found in favour of the tenant, and explained at 376: [I]t is a question of fact whether the money tendered is tendered as, and accepted as, rent, as distinct, for example, from money tendered and accepted as damages for trespass. That is a question of fact. Once it is decided as a fact that the money was tendered and accepted as rent, the question of its consequences as a waiver is a matter of law. 43        When Top Ten failed to pay the costs and interest on time, Leivest could have terminated the settlement agreement and the lease of 31 October 2003. But it did not exercise its rights. By its acceptance of the costs and its demand for and acceptance of the rent for December 2003, it had waived the breaches, and it cannot resurrect them.",
        "The option for renewal": "44        Top Ten had sent a letter dated 19 August 2004 to inform Leivest that it wanted to exercise the option in cl 6 of the 31 October 2003 lease to renew the lease. It added that: [W]e agree to pay a rent which represents the fair market rent of the premises inclusive of service charges (payable to the Management Corp) and hiring charges for the air-conditioning system. We accept that the fair market rent of the premises inclusive of the service charges and air-conditioning system is monthly rent of S$48,000. 45        Leivest’s response was given on 17 September 2004: You must be aware that in Suit OS 204 of 2004/F, our stand is that there isNoLease. Hence there is no question of your Option to Renew the Lease which is not in existence. Kindly refer the matter to your solicitors. 46        In its Defence to Top Ten’s claim for specific performance, Leivest pleaded that Top Ten had failed to exercise the option to renew when it proposed the rent of $48,000 without complying with the procedure set out for fixing the fair market rate. 47        The question that arises is whether the proposal to fix the rent at $48,000 without obtaining the valuation reports was in breach of cl 6. Clause 6 states that upon the renewal of the lease, the rent shall be fixed at the fair market rate, and it goes on to state that the fair market rate shall be determined by the valuations of licensed valuers. 48        Counsel for Top Ten submitted that the clause should not be read to prevent the parties from agreeing between themselves on a fair market rent. I think that it is correct that the parties did not put it beyond their power to agree on the rent. It must be implied that the valuers’ reports are to be obtained only if they cannot agree on the rent. 49        If there is room for agreement on the rent, then one party can propose what it should be, as Top Ten had done. It was for Leivest to accept, reject, or make a counter proposal, but Leivest did not recognise that Top Ten had an option to renew. Leivest would not have appointed valuers even if Top Ten had done that. There was no possibility for the lease to be renewed by the agreement of the parties at that time. 50        In the circumstances, I find that Top Ten had exercised its option for the extension of the lease. All that remains to be done is to fix the rent for the extension period, even though the extension period has run out. That does not mean rent for the premises in the state they were in at the commencement of the extended period. It means rent for the premises in the state they would be in if possession of the premises had been handed back to Leivest by Top Ten. 51        The Court of Appeal made it clear inRiduan bin Yusof v Khng Thian Huat (No 2)[2005] 4 SLR 234that if a tenant like Top Ten delivers possession of leased premises back to the landlord, it has the right to remove the tenant’s fixtures and return the premises in the state they were in when possession was first given. 52        The furniture and fittings that came with the lease were listed in the Second Schedule to the 1985 lease. In assessing the rent payable upon the renewal of the lease, account should be taken of the items in the schedule, but Top Ten’s properties and tenant’s fixtures on the premises should be excluded from consideration. 53        Each party had obtained a valuation report after the deadline in cl 6 for the purpose of the trial, but without a common understanding as to what constituted the demised premises. Left to their own, the valuers applied their own constructions. One valuation was made on the basis of the premises as a bare unit, apparently without regard to the furniture and fittings on the premises in 1984. The other valuation was on the basis of the premises as a discotheque,iewith the additions put in by Top Ten. These valuations were flawed and of no use under cl 6. With the clarification in place, it is open to the parties to agree on the rent on a proper basis. If they cannot agree, they are to proceed to get proper valuations, and to have the rent worked out in accordance with cl 6. 54        The timelines set out in cl 6 have to be changed. The parties will have one week to agree on the rent. If they are unable to agree, they shall appoint the valuers within two weeks, and the valuers shall produce their reports before the end of five weeks. If there is a need to appoint a third valuer, the appointment shall be done within seven weeks and the third valuer’s report is to be produced by nine weeks. All the time periods are to run from today. 55        The reference to the 10% difference between the two valuations has to be clarified as it can give rise to uncertainty in application. This shall be taken to mean a 10% difference between the two valuations measured against the higher valuation.",
