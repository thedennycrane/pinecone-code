        "Appropriate sentence for Wham": "4 I address first the issue of the appropriate sentence for Wham.",
        "Parties’ arguments": "62 In summary, the AG submitted that, in view of an antecedent, the appropriate sentence for Tan should not be less than the sentence imposed upon him for his previous conviction for scandalising contempt,ie, it should not be less than 15 days’ imprisonment. In the written submissions to the court and at the hearing on the appropriate sentence for Tan, the AG also submitted that the court should order Tan to publish a notice to apologise for his post, and order him to remove his post forthwith. However, at the hearing on sentence, Tan said that he would remove his post from his Facebook profile. I understand from the letter Tan’s counsel later sent to the court dated 21 March 2019 that Tan’s post has been removed. I will elaborate later on why Tan eventually decided, at the hearing, to remove his post (see [76] below). 63 In Tan’s written submissions to the court dated 30 October 2018, he had submitted that the appropriate sentence is not more than three days’ imprisonment.46Foot Note 46×Tan’s Submissions on Sentence and Costs (“Tan’s Submissions”) at para 4.He did not ask for a fine. His written submissions gave the impression that he did not suggest a fine because of his antecedent. In his written submissions, Tan also submitted that this court should neither order him to publish a notice to apologise for his post nor order him to remove his post forthwith. 64 However, during the hearing, Tan explained that he had made a submission for a short custodial sentence instead of a fine primarily because being sentenced to a fine of not less than $2,000 would disqualify him from being a Member of Parliament. As Tan was seeking to persuade the court to impose a custodial sentence instead of a fine, he also offered to remove his post from his Facebook profile, as mentioned above. In the course of the hearing, Tan also submitted that the appropriate sentence for him is seven days’ imprisonment instead. I will elaborate on these points below (see [73]–[77] below). 65 In the light of the above, I will begin by setting out Tan’s arguments in his written submissions to the court, and then his arguments at the hearing, before I set out the AG’s arguments. Tan’s arguments (1) Written submissions to the court 66 As mentioned, in Tan’s written submissions, he had submitted that the appropriate sentence for him is not more than three days’ imprisonment. (I will discuss at [77] below how at the hearing, this submission changed to seven days’ imprisonment.) 67 Tan submitted that his post was a single sentence which in itself did not bear the elements of a scandalising statement, but only took on such a scandalising character when read in conjunction with its extraneous reference to Wham’s post, which was similarly a couple of sentences.47Foot Note 47×See Tan’s Submissions at para 10.Tan added that this “extraneous reference” took the form of a link to Wham’s Facebook profile and not a link directly to Wham’s post.48Foot Note 48×Tan’s Submissions at para 10.Tan also submitted that pending the determination of the proceedings against Wham for scandalising contempt, Wham’s post could not have been said to be scandalising contempt.49Foot Note 49×See Tan’s Submissions at para 14. 68 In his written submissions, Tan had not disputed that he was just as culpable as Wham, in so far as Tan’s post gained its contemptuous character from Wham’s post.50Foot Note 50×See Tan’s Submissions at para 11.(This position changed at the hearing (see [77] below).) Tan had then aligned himself with Wham’s submissions on Wham’s culpability (see [21]–[24] above).51Foot Note 51×See Tan’s Submissions at para 11.Tan emphasised that Tan’s post being on his Facebook profile was “ephemeral”.52Foot Note 52×See Tan’s Submissions at para 13.He contended that the contemptuous article inAuWai Pang, for example, would have been a more enduring form of publication and would have commanded a far greater degree of a reader’s attention than a post on a Facebook profile, much less Tan’s post containing a single sentence.53Foot Note 53×See Tan’s Submissions at para 13. 69 Further, Tan argued that his scandalising contempt in this case was much less egregious than that for his previous conviction inTan LiangJoo John([31]supra). For his previous conviction, Tan was found liable for scandalising contempt at common law on 24 November 2008 and was sentenced to 15 days’ imprisonment (seeTan LiangJoo Johnat [5]). Consequently, Tan argued that the sentence of 15 days’ imprisonment imposed upon him previously should not be the starting point for determining the appropriate sentence for him in this case.54Foot Note 54×See Tan’s Submissions at para 16.In his written submissions, Tan described his scandalising contempt leading to his previous conviction to be “a deliberate scheme designed to publicly, and spectacularly, impugn the integrity of the Singapore courts”.55Foot Note 55×See Tan’s Submissions at para 17.I note that this was not Tan’s case before the High Court inTan LiangJoo John, where for one, Tan had claimed that his conduct was in the spirit of fair criticism (seeTan LiangJoo Johnat [6], [25]). 70 Tan thus submitted that his culpability in the present case was on the opposite end of the spectrum from that inTan LiangJoo John.56Foot Note 56×Tan’s Submissions at para 20.He submitted that his post was “not a pointed, scurrilous insult striking at the foundations of justice”, nor was it “meticulously planned as to ensure maximum impact and press coverage”.57Foot Note 57×Tan’s Submissions at para 20. 71 Like Wham, Tan further argued that an overly harsh sentence imposed upon him would have a chilling effect on public discourse and constructive public discussion in Singapore.58Foot Note 58×Tan’s Submissions at para 23. 72 As for Tan’s written submissions that this court should neither order him to publish a notice to apologise for his post nor order him to remove it, he made similar arguments as Wham (see [26]–[27] above).59Foot Note 59×See Tan’s Submissions at paras 28–31, 33–34, 36. (2) Oral submissions at the hearing 73 At the hearing, I questioned Tan’s counsel as to why Tan had submitted that a short custodial sentence is appropriate instead of a fine. It was only then that Tan gave two reasons for this submission for a custodial sentence.60Foot Note 60×See NAs at p 38 lines 16–17.It was unclear why these two reasons were not stated earlier in Tan’s written submissions to the court dated 30 October 2018. 74 The first reason that Tan gave was that he would be “better off” financially serving a custodial sentence instead of paying a fine.61Foot Note 61×See NAs at p 39 lines 1–3.This reason did not seem to hold water. If Tan did not pay a fine and thus served a default custodial sentence, he would be in the same position financially as if no fine were imposed. Tan then focused on his second reason instead.62Foot Note 62×See NAs at p 39 line 17. 75 Tan’s second reason was that being sentenced to a fine of not less than $2,000 would disqualify him from being a Member of Parliament.63Foot Note 63×See NAs at p 39 lines 17–19, p 60 line 5.Consequently, whilst Tan agreed that he could not “pick and choose” the sentence that he wanted, he asked for the court’s indulgence to sentence him to a short custodial term instead of a fine of not less than $2,000.64Foot Note 64×See NAs at p 68 lines 13–19.Tan contended that justice would be done in this case if he were sentenced to a short custodial term, and that he was not asking for leniency as a custodial sentence is generally perceived as being more severe than a fine.65Foot Note 65×See NAs at p 44 lines 13–14, p 66 lines 9–12.He submitted that greater injustice would result if he were sentenced to a fine of not less than $2,000.66Foot Note 66×See NAs at p 44 lines 14–15.This greater injustice was with regard to the additional harshness and suffering for him that a normal person would not incur.67Foot Note 67×See NAs at p 39 lines 27–29. 76 It was in the course of making his submissions during the hearing that Tan’s counsel took further instructions and informed the court that Tan would remove his post from his Facebook profile after the hearing that day. Tan’s counsel made it clear that Tan’s change in position was just to put his counsel in a “better position to ask the Court for some compassion”, and was not conditional upon the court sentencing Tan to a custodial term.68Foot Note 68×See NAs at p 46 lines 11–13, 21–25.Tan’s counsel stated that the fact that Tan had not offered to remove his post earlier was a factor that the court could take into account in sentencing.69Foot Note 69×See NAs at p 46 lines 26–28.Tan also submitted that he would still not apologise because he had no intention of scandalising the court.70Foot Note 70×See NAs at p 46 lines 4–5. 77 In the course of the hearing, Tan submitted that the court should consider his subjective intention in publishing his post, and that was to criticise the AG.71Foot Note 71×See NAs at p 37 lines 1–4, 12–13.Tan then also submitted that he was less culpable than Wham,72Foot Note 72×See NAs at p 48 line 14.in contrast to Tan’s position in his written submissions (see [68] above). However, taking into account his antecedent, Tan accepted that the appropriate sentence for him should be similar to that for Wham save that Tan was asking for the custodial sentence to be imposed without first being sentenced to pay a fine.73Foot Note 73×See NAs at p 48 lines 21–26.Consequently, at the hearing, Tan submitted that the appropriate sentence for him is seven days’ imprisonment instead.74Foot Note 74×See NAs at p 49 lines 1–5. Tan submitted at the hearing on sentence that the appropriate sentence for him is seven days’ imprisonment. In the letter Tan’s counsel sent to the court dated 20 March 2019 after the hearing, it was instead stated that Tan’s counsel had made the argument that Tan should be sentenced to a short custodial sentence of three to seven days (see para 2).I noted that a sentence of seven days’ imprisonment was the default sentence that Wham was seeking if the court were to impose a fine in the range of $4,000 to $6,000 upon Wham. (3) Further submissions after the hearing 78 After the hearing, Tan’s counsel sent a letter to the court dated 20 March 2019, submitting further authorities and arguing that they supported the new submissions Tan had made during the hearing. Tan cited the High Court case ofLowMeng Chay v Public Prosecutor[1993] 1 SLR(R) 46 (“LowMeng Chay”) and the District Court case ofPublic Prosecutor vAmzad Hossen Shajidul Haque[2016] SGDC 220 (“AmzadHossen Shajidul Haque”). Tan submitted that courts have imposed upon an offender a custodial sentence when a fine would be unusually harsh and thus unjust given his particular circumstances.75Foot Note 75×See letter to the court from Tan’s counsel dated 20 March 2019 at para 4(a). 79 As mentioned, Tan’s counsel sent another letter to the court dated 21 March 2019 to inform the court that as at the evening of 20 March 2019, Tan’s post was removed from his Facebook profile. The AG’s arguments 80 Despite the new position taken by Tan at the hearing, the AG maintained the position that the appropriate sentence for Tan should not be less than 15 days’ imprisonment,ie, irrespective of the personal consequences to Tan in relation to whether he would be qualified to stand for election as a Member of Parliament. 81 The AG’s primary submission was that Tan is a repeat offender.76Foot Note 76×See AG’s Submissions on Sentence and Costs against Tan (“AG’s WS-T”) at paras 2, 26.The AG thus argued that Tan was recalcitrant and the custodial threshold is crossed in this case.77Foot Note 77×See AG’s WS-T at para 27.Whilst the AG recognised that Tan’s present offence was less serious than his antecedent,78Foot Note 78×See NAs at p 10 lines 1–10.the AG submitted that the nature of both offences were similar.79Foot Note 79×See AG’s WS-T at para 27.In both offences, Tan was also involved in disseminating the contemptuous allegation online.80Foot Note 80×See NAs at p 12 lines 26–29.The AG thus submitted that there is a strong need for specific deterrence in this case and this would not be achieved if Tan received a sentence more lenient than that imposed upon him previously.81Foot Note 81×See AG’s WS-T at para 27. 82 The AG submitted that Tan was just as culpable as Wham, because Tan’s post aligned itself with and affirmed as true what Wham said in his post.82Foot Note 82×See AG’s WS-T at para 23.The AG submitted that Tan intended to and did attack the Singapore courts.83Foot Note 83×See NAs at p 57 lines 16–17.The AG further argued that Tan endorsed Wham’s post after proceedings against Wham had been commenced for scandalising contempt, and with full knowledge that Wham’s post unjustifiably scandalised the Singapore judiciary.84Foot Note 84×See AG’s WS-T at para 23. 83 The AG argued that like Wham, Tan showed an utter lack of remorse, in that as at the hearing on the appropriate sentence for Tan, he had neither removed his post from his Facebook profile nor apologised.85Foot Note 85×See AG’s WS-T at paras 24–25.The AG further argued that in so doing, Tan showed a blatant disregard for the finding of this court that he committed scandalising contempt.86Foot Note 86×See NAs at p 2 lines 19–21.The AG submitted Tan’s lack of contrition as a substantial aggravating factor in this case.87Foot Note 87×See AG’s WS-T at para 25. 84 The AG also argued that the potential extent of dissemination of Tan’s post was significant due to the extended period of time for which it remained online.88Foot Note 88×See AG’s WS-T at para 24. 85 In response to Tan’s arguments at the hearing on the personal consequences to him if a fine of not less than $2,000 were to be imposed, the AG submitted that it would be unprincipled for Tan to “pick and choose” the sentence he wanted, or for the court to then “tweak” the sentence to suit him.89Foot Note 89×See NAs at p 61 lines 4–11, p 63 lines 26–28.In this regard, the AG referred the court to the High Court case ofStansilasFabian Kester v Public Prosecutor[2017] 5 SLR 755 (“StansilasFabian Kester”). The AG further contended that even if Tan were asking for a more severe sentence of a custodial term rather than a fine, he was effectively asking for a sentence which was more favourable to him.90Foot Note 90×See NAs at p 68 lines 11–14. 86 As in the case in relation to Wham, the AG had also submitted that the court should also order Tan to publish a notice to apologise for his post, pursuant to s 12(3) of the Act, with the order made subject to similar conditions as those sought in relation to Wham including one that Tan’s post be removed forthwith (see [11] above).91Foot Note 91×See AG’s WS-T at paras 28, 30, Annex.The AG had similarly submitted that such an order is necessary because as at the hearing on sentence, Tan had failed to remove his post or apologise for it.92Foot Note 92×See AG’s WS-T at para 29.However, as mentioned (at [62] and [76] above), at the hearing on sentence, Tan said he would remove his post from his Facebook profile. Tan’s counsel has also informed the court that Tan’s post was removed after the hearing (see [79] above).",
        "Decision": "87 I reproduce the statement in Tan’s post: By chargingJolovanfor scandalising the judiciary, the AGC only confirms what he said was true. Sentence 88 I make three preliminary points. First, a court is not bound to sentence a person to imprisonment just because both the applicant and the respondent submit that the appropriate sentence is a custodial one. 89 Second, I do not consider Tan to be more culpable for publishing his postafterproceedings against Wham had been commenced for scandalising contempt (see [82] above). After all, Tan’s post was about those proceedings. Also, at that point, it was not yet determined that Wham was guilty of scandalising contempt. 90 Third, I reject Tan’s characterisation of his post in itself not bearing the elements of scandalising contempt and that the reference to Wham’s post was “extraneous” (see [67] above). This was not Tan’s case before the court in his submissions on liability. The words “the AGC only confirms what he said was true” in Tan’s post were intertwined with and repeated what Wham said in Wham’s post (Wham Kwok HanJolovanat [115]). 91 I address Tan’s culpability next. I observe that Tan was directly criticising the AG for commencing proceedings against Wham for scandalising contempt, and Tan’s attack on the Singapore courts was less direct. Given this particular factual matrix, I am of the view that Tan was less culpable than Wham. 92 On the other hand, as with Wham, Tan did not show any remorse for his post. Tan refused to apologise for his post even after conviction, and as at the hearing on sentence, he had not removed his post from his Facebook profile. To be clear, whilst Tan removed his post after the hearing on sentence and on the same day, this was not a reflection of remorse for his post. Tan’s counsel made it clear at the hearing that Tan’s decision to remove his post was just to put his counsel in a “better position to ask the Court for some compassion” (see [76] above); it is a separate question whether Tan’s decision assisted his submission for a custodial sentence and I will come to this later. 93 This is not the first time that Tan is convicted for scandalising contempt, but it is Wham’s first. 94 Briefly, Tan was previously found liable for scandalising contempt (at common law) on 24 November 2008 because he wore a T-shirt imprinted with a picture of a kangaroo dressed in a judge’s gown, within and in the vicinity of the Supreme Court on two occasions when an assessment of damages hearing was being held, and distributed similar T-shirts in the Supreme Court (seeTan LiangJoo Johnat [30]). Tan was, at that time, also involved in or acquiesced in posting a photograph on the Singapore Democratic Party website, of him and his two co-respondents wearing these T-shirts and standing outside the main entrance of the Supreme Court building. The High Court concluded that the conduct of Tan and his co-respondents communicated to an average member of the public their conviction that the Singapore courts were “kangaroo courts” (seeTan LiangJoo Johnat [28]). In sentencing Tan to 15 days’ imprisonment, the High Court also took into account the fact that Tan refused to apologise and was particularly recalcitrant (Tan LiangJoo Johnat [40]–[41]). 95 While Tan has again committed scandalising contempt, the nature of his previous contempt in 2008 was very different from the nature of his contempt on the present occasion in relation to his post. It may have been that both offences involved some element of publication of the contemptuous allegation online, namely, one aspect of Tan’s previous contempt in 2008, and the very nature of Tan’s present contempt in relation to his post. However, this alone is insufficient to equate the two offences. Tan’s culpability and the gravity of his contempt then were obviously much more than his culpability and the gravity of his contempt on the present occasion. I thus reject the AG’s attempt to equate the two very different acts in terms of culpability and gravity. 96 As mentioned, both the AG and Tan submitted that the appropriate sentence for Tan is a custodial sentence but for different reasons. Leaving aside for the time being the question of the personal consequences that might result for Tan depending on the sentence to be imposed upon him, and given my finding that Tan was less culpable than Wham but that Tan has an antecedent, I am not persuaded that a custodial sentence is appropriate for Tan. Neither am I persuaded that the sentence for Tan ought to be more severe than the sentence for Wham. Tan’s antecedent should not overshadow his present offence. He was already sentenced for his previous offence and has already served that sentence. The mere existence of one antecedent for which Tan was sentenced to a custodial term does not necessarily mean that a custodial sentence is warranted for him should he commit scandalising contempt again. It is important to consider the nature of the contempt on both occasions. Where the antecedent was much more serious, it does not follow that, without more, Tan should be sentenced to a custodial term on this present occasion. Here, Tan did not repeat what he did on the previous occasion, and as mentioned, the nature of his present contempt was quite different. 97 I proceed to consider whether the court should consider the personal consequences that might result for Tan depending on the sentence to be imposed upon him. 98 The relevant portions of Arts 45(1)(e) and 45(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) state: Disqualifications for membership of Parliament 45.—(1) Subject to this Article, a person shall not be qualified to be a Member of Parliament who — … (e) has been convicted of an offence by a court of law in Singapore or Malaysia and sentenced toimprisonment for a term of not less than one yearor toa fine of not less than $2,000and has not received a free pardon: … … (2) The disqualification of a person under clause (1)(d) or (e) may be removed by the President and shall, if not so removed, cease at the end of 5 years beginning from … as the case may be, the date on which the person convicted as mentioned in clause (1)(e) was released from custody or the date on which the fine mentioned in clause (1)(e) was imposed on such person … … [emphasis added] 99 Tan submitted that if he were sentenced to a fine of not less than $2,000, pursuant to Art 45(1)(e), and if he did not receive a free pardon, he would not be qualified to be a Member of Parliament for a time period of up to five years (Art 45(2)). As he was of the view that a sentence of a fine would not be less than $2,000 in his case, Tan thus argued that the appropriate sentence for him should be a custodial term of a few days. 100 It seems that under Art 45(1)(e), a sentence of one year’s imprisonment is supposed to be the notional equivalent of a fine of $2,000 as each is a threshold for disqualification for membership of Parliament. This appears anomalous as a sentence of one year’s imprisonment would appear to be obviously more severe than a fine of $2,000 in current times. The provision in Art 45(1)(e) was already a part of the Constitution of Singapore in force as at 9 August 1965. However, it may be that the quantum of the fine has not been reviewed to take into account inflation. Hence, the result is that for someone aspiring to be a Member of Parliament, a custodial sentence of a few days may be perceived as being more favourable to him than a $2,000 fine although the opposite perception would apply for most others. 101 I turn to consider the High Court case ofStansilasFabian Kester([85]supra). I find the reasoning of Sundaresh Menon CJ inStansilasFabian Kesterhelpful, and I reproduce his analysis at [110]–[111]: 110 The second argument is that an offender should not receivepunishment of a certain typeor above a certain degree because he will lose his job or face disciplinary proceedings otherwise. The argument is that the imposition ofa certain typeor degreeof punishmentwill lead tohardship or compromise the offender’s future in some wayand thatthis additional hardshipmay and indeed should be taken into account by the sentencing court. However,this will not often bring the offender very far.Prof Ashworth accounts for the general lack of persuasiveness of such arguments in the following lucid fashion ([Andrew Ashworth,Sentencing and Criminal Justice(Cambridge University Press, 6th Ed, 2015)] at p 194): Is there any merit in this source of mitigation [ie, the effect of the crime on the offender’s career]?Once courts begin to adjust sentences for collateral consequences, is this not a step towards the idea of wider social accounting which was rejected above? In many cases one can argue that these collateral consequences are a concomitant of the professional responsibility which the offender undertook, and therefore that they should not lead to a reduction in sentence becausethe offender surely knew the implications. Moreover, there is a discrimination argument here too. If collateral consequences were accepted as a regular mitigating factor, this would operate in favour of members of the professional classes and against ‘common thieves’ who would either be unemployed or working in jobs where a criminal record is no barrier. It would surely be wrong to support a principle which institutionalized discrimination between employed and unemployed offenders. 111 Whichever way one looks at it,I do not regard it as relevant to sentencing.A person who breaches the criminal law can expect to face the consequences that follow under the criminal law.Whether or not such an offender has already or may as a result sufferother professional or contractual consequencesshould not be relevant to the sentencing court. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 102 Menon CJ’s analysis as set out above is applicable to sentencing in general. He dealt with the general argument that “imposition ofa certain typeor degreeof punishmentwill lead to hardship or compromise the offender’s future in some way” [emphasis added]. Menon CJ’s analysis will also apply to Tan’s situation. 103 I accept that as regards Tan, there is no discrimination of the kind mentioned by Prof Ashworth. However, as mentioned by Menon CJ, whichever way one looks at it, the collateral consequences are not relevant to sentencing. Menon CJ stated that “other professional or contractual consequences should not be relevant to the sentencing court”. In my view, this also applies to consequences other than professional or contractual consequences such as political consequences. In other words, a person who breaches the criminal law must expect to face the consequences under the criminal law whether or not he also suffers collateral consequences. I thus reject Tan’s submission in so far as he suggested that justice would not be done in this case if he were sentenced to a fine of at least $2,000 (see [75] above). 104 It may even be said that it is for any person who has political aspirations to ensure that he does not run afoul of the law. In the case of Tan, this is not his first brush with the law. Even if it could be said that he was initially unaware that his post might be scandalising contempt, it was open to him to remove his post from his Facebook profile as soon as he was aware that the AG intended to take action against him for his post. Tan could have done so as a matter of prudence and not because he necessarily agreed with the AG’s perception. 105 Alternatively, as soon as the court convicted him for scandalising contempt, Tan could have immediately removed his post and apologised for it. For his own reasons, he chose not to do so. His decision to remove his post was made only during the hearing on sentence. It was an eleventh-hour manoeuvre to try and persuade the court to accede to his request not to impose a fine. As mentioned, it was not a reflection of genuine remorse. 106 Had Tan taken any of the courses of action mentioned above, then he might have avoided the continuation of proceedings against him for scandalising contempt, or he would have been in a better position to seek a fine of less than $2,000. In the circumstances, Tan is responsible for the situation he finds himself in. 107 Consequently, the personal consequences for Tan, depending on the sentence to be imposed upon him, are irrelevant to sentencing. 108 I now address the cases which Tan’s counsel submitted with his letter to the court dated 20 March 2019, sent after the hearing on sentence (see [78] above). 109 In the High Court case ofLowMeng Chay, the appellant filed two magistrate’s appeals against sentences imposed upon him for being manifestly excessive. The appellant had been sentenced for multiple offences under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1985 Rev Ed) and under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed) (which, amongst other things, amended the penalties attached to contraventions of s 73). Before the magistrates, the appellant had been sentenced to: (a) in relation to the first magistrate’s appeal, fines amounting to $24,000 (with 24 months’ imprisonment in default) and 32 months’ imprisonment; and (b) in relation to the second magistrate’s appeal, fines amounting to $66,600 (with 32 months and 23 days’ imprisonment in default). The appellant was unable to pay the fines which amounted to $90,600, and therefore faced imprisonment for an aggregate period of seven years, four months and 23 days. 110 On appeal, Yong Pung How CJ was of the view that in all the circumstances, this aggregate period was manifestly excessive, when s 73 (as amended) only provided for imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years (LowMeng Chayat [8]). Yong CJ was of the view that to give effect to all the default sentences would offend the totality principle and thus considered what the proper sentence should be (LowMeng Chayat [12]). It was against this backdrop that Yong CJ stated: “[w]hen it is unambiguously clear that a defendant cannot pay a fine … the fine should not be imposed even though the court would have preferred to impose a fine rather than a short term of imprisonment” (LowMeng Chayat [13]). Consequently, Yong CJ allowed both the appellant’s appeals and sentenced him to: (a) in relation to the first magistrate’s appeal, a total of 12 months’ imprisonment; and (b) in relation to the second magistrate’s appeal, a total of 21 months’ imprisonment. Accordingly, this meant that the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for an aggregate period of two years and nine months. 111 The primary concern inLowMeng Chayappeared to be that the appellant faced a manifestly excessive period of incarceration when all the default sentences (for not paying the fines) were given effect to. Therefore, I doubt thatLowMeng Chaystands for ageneralproposition that so long as an individual cannot pay a fine, the court should impose upon him a custodial sentence instead. The nature of a custodial sentence is different from that of a fine, and as mentioned, a custodial sentence of a few days may be perceived as being more severe than a $2,000 fine (for most). 112 In any case, even if the holding inLowMeng Chaywere that a fine should not be imposed upon an individual who is unable to pay one, this would not assist Tan. Tan did not submit that he would be unable to pay a fine if one were imposed upon him. Further, nowhere inLowMeng Chaydo I find support for the wide proposition which Tan contended,ie, that courts have imposed upon an offender a custodial sentence just because a fine would be “unusually harsh and thus unjust” given his particular circumstances (see [78] above). 113 As for the District Court case ofAmzadHossen Shajidul Haque, the District Court stated that for being concerned in loading duty unpaid tobacco, the accused would have to be sentenced to a fine in the range of $29,022.45 to $38,696.60 or an imprisonment term up to three years or both (at [9]). The District Court then considered, at [11], the High Court case ofYap Ah Lai v Public Prosecutor[2014] 3 SLR 180 (“Yap Ah Lai”) at [46], which had held that having regard to the “legislative intent” for the relevant offence and “the very heavy fines that are mandated”, a custodial sentence will generally be imposed unless there is reason to believe that the offender can pay the fines. The District Court thus imposed a custodial sentence upon the accused in its case because he had no means to pay the fine (AmzadHossen Shajidul Haqueat [13]). 114Yap Ah Laiwas a case where the offender was concerned in importing uncustomed goods and thus guilty of offences under s 128F of the Customs Act (Cap 70, 2004 Rev Ed). In view of the very heavy fines mandated, Menon CJ took into account the fact that the offender was unlikely to be able to pay the fines. Accordingly, he was of the view at [18] that it would generally be inappropriate to impose a fine, with imprisonment in default, if the effect of this would be to punish those who are genuinely unable to pay. Hence, reference to the level of fines prescribed for these offences can only be of limited value in calibrating the appropriate sentence of imprisonment where imprisonment is the primary sentence instead of a fine. 115 As withLowMeng Chay,AmzadHossen Shajidul HaqueandYap Ah Laido not assist Tan where he did not submit that he would be unable to pay a fine if one were imposed upon him. Again, nowhere inAmzadHossen Shajidul Haqueor inYap Ah Laido I find support for the wide proposition which Tan contended,ie, that courts have imposed upon an offender a custodial sentence just because a fine would be “unusually harsh and thus unjust” given his particular circumstances. 116 In this case, the custodial threshold is not crossed in the case of Tan, whose sentence should be similar to Wham’s (see [96] above). Therefore, in my view, a sentence of a fine of $5,000, with one week’s imprisonment in default, would be appropriate for Tan for the offence of scandalising contempt under s 3(1)(a) of the Act in the circumstances. The fine is to be paid within eight days from and including the date of this judgment. Notice to apologise 117 As in the case in relation to Wham, I do not think that it is necessary in the circumstances of this case to make an order that Tan publish a notice to apologise for his post pursuant to s 12(3) of the Act. Given that I find it unnecessary to order Tan to publish a notice to apologise, there is also no further question of imposing conditions in respect of the order. Removal of Tan’s post 118 The question of ordering Tan to remove his post from his Facebook profile is academic since he has removed it.",
        "Appropriate sentence for Tan": "61 I proceed to address the issue of the appropriate sentence for Tan.",
        "Conclusion": "119 In the circumstances, I sentence Wham to a fine of $5,000, with one week’s imprisonment in default. The fine is to be paid within eight days from and including the date of this judgment. 120 I also sentence Tan to a fine of $5,000, with one week’s imprisonment in default. The fine is also to be paid within eight days from and including the date of this judgment. 121 On the issue of costs, the AG sought against Wham costs of $8,000 and disbursements of $2,297.82, and sought against Tan costs of $5,000 and disbursements of $1,966.39, on the basis that some of the work overlapped but more work was done for the proceedings against Wham.93Foot Note 93×See AG’s WS-W at para 33; AG’s WS-T at para 31; List of Disbursements for OS 510/2018; List of Disbursements for OS 537/2018.On the other hand, at the hearing on sentence, the Respondents argued that they should each pay the AG’s costs fixed at $4,000 plus the respective disbursements.94Foot Note 94×See NAs at p 54 lines 2–7.The Respondents did not dispute the quantum for the disbursements.95Foot Note 95×See NAs at p 65 lines 20–21. 122 Although the AG asked for a higher amount as costs against Wham than that against Tan, the legal and factual issues in the two cases were not so different as to justify a distinction between the two on the question of costs. Accordingly, I am of the view that the costs awarded should be the same for each case. 123 I order Wham to pay the AG’s costs fixed at $5,000 plus disbursements of $2,297.82. I order Tan to pay the AG’s costs fixed at $5,000 plus disbursements of $1,966.39. 124 For the avoidance of doubt, the time to appeal to the Court of Appeal on any issue, whether in respect of liability or sentence or otherwise, runs from today,ie, 29 April 2019.
