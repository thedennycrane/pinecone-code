        "(i) The plaintiff": "7.\n\n        In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the\n\nplaintiff stated that at about 9pm on the evening in question, he and his wife and friends\n\ntook a taxi to Circular Road to have dinner. After alighting from the taxi, they walked\n\nalong Circular Road to look for a Chinese restaurant. The plaintiff was walking with his\n\nwife. When they saw a car driven by the first defendant coming towards them, he and his\n\nwife walked to the side of the road to avoid the car. The plaintiff continued to walk\n\nalong with his wife on his right, abreast of him, but about half a step in front of him.\n\nHe then felt a hit on his left leg and fell forward. The car that had passed by had\n\nsuddenly reversed, apparently to park in an empty car park lot alongside where the\n\nplaintiff and his wife were walking. After falling down, the plaintiff slowly lost\n\nconsciousness and when he woke up he was already in the Accident and Emergency Department\n\nof Singapore General Hospital.8.\n\n        Under cross-examination, the plaintiff agreed\n\nthat he and his friends were visiting Singapore for the first time. After they disembarked\n\nfrom the taxi at Circular Road, they walked along the road itself. He said he did not know\n\nwhether Circular Road was a one way street. He and his wife were walking abreast of each\n\nother and as they walked they looked to either side of the road to look for a restaurant\n\nfor their meal. The plaintiff was asked whether when they were walking along Circular\n\nRoad, he, his wife and their friends were occupying about half the road. His reply was\n\nthat he was crossing the road and there were cars from all sides. Subsequently, he was\n\nasked whether he agreed that when he was walking abreast of his wife he was occupying\n\nalmost half the width of the road. He disagreed and said that it was a narrow street and\n\nhe was crossing the road diagonally.9.\n\n        As far as the plaintiff could remember he was\n\nwalking against the flow of traffic and had crossed the road from right to left. He was\n\nasked whether the accident occurred immediately after he crossed the road and reached the\n\nleft-hand side. He said no and that after crossing he continued to walk against the flow\n\nof traffic and abreast of his wife. His wife was on his right-hand side and there were\n\ncars parked on his left-hand side. He remembered a car coming from the front which he\n\nmanaged to avoid. He was asked whether by this car he meant the car driven by the first\n\ndefendant. His reply was he did not know. He also said that he did not notice the presence\n\nof the first defendant’s car immediately prior to his falling down onto the road.\n\nAfter the accident, his wife told him that he had been knocked down by a BMW but he did\n\nnot see the first defendant. The first time he saw the first defendant was in court.10.\n\n        The plaintiff said that whilst he was walking\n\nalong Circular Road he was not aware that vehicles would be manoeuvring into and out of\n\nparking lots on either side of the road. When asked whether it occurred to him that it\n\nwould be safer to walk along the five foot ways alongside the road, he replied that what\n\nhe had in mind was that he needed to cross the road to look for a restaurant. He agreed\n\nthat he was not familiar with the traffic rules in Singapore but did not agree that it\n\nwould unsafe for him to walk on the road itself. He did not accept that having to look out\n\nfor a restaurant while walking along the road compromised his ability to keep a proper\n\nlookout for vehicular traffic along the road.11.\n\n        In re-examination, the plaintiff said that he\n\nhad moved to the left side of Circular Road when he saw a car coming towards him. After\n\nthat he was walking straight along the road on the left-hand side. Subsequently the\n\nplaintiff’s evidence was inconsistent with this stand. He was asked by his lawyer to\n\nexplain how he was making sure that he was not endangering himself while walking along the\n\nroad after he moved to the left side of the road. The plaintiff’s reply was not quite\n\napposite to the question. He said: ‘When we were walking along the road and saw this\n\ncar coming along the road, we managed to avoid this car before we crossed to the other\n\nside of the road. As there was a parking lot on the left side of the road, we walked\n\ntowards that lot.’ Then when asked whether he was walking into the lot or straight\n\ninto the road his reply was that he was walking into the lot.",
        "(ii) Madam Wu Bao Yan": "12.\n\n        Madam Wu’s account of the incident in her\n\naffidavit was very similar to that in the plaintiff’s affidavit. She said that the\n\nplaintiff was walking beside her along Circular Road and their friends were a few metres\n\nbehind them. When she and the plaintiff saw a car coming towards them, they walked towards\n\nthe side of the road to avoid the car. The car passed by them. Madam Wu was walking\n\nabreast of the plaintiff but about half a step ahead of him. They walked for a further\n\nfour or five steps and then the plaintiff suddenly fell forward. Madam turned around and\n\nsaw the boot of a car less than a metre away from them. The car was in a slanted position\n\nas if it were about to park in the empty lot next to them.13.\n\n        In cross-examination, Madam Wu was asked\n\nwhether she agreed that because she and her husband were walking abreast of each other,\n\nthey were occupying half the width of the road. She disagreed and stated that in fact they\n\nwere walking quite near to the side of the road. She did not know that there was a path\n\nfor pedestrians alongside the road. She thought that the road was a road for both\n\npedestrians and vehicles. She was then asked whether at first she was on the right-hand\n\nside of the road and at some time later had crossed the road. The reply was a firm no.\n\nMadam Wu stated that they did not cross the road before the accident.14.\n\n        Madam Wu was next asked whether just before the\n\naccident she was walking on the right hand side of the road facing the oncoming traffic or\n\nwhether she was on the left-hand side. Her reply was that she was on the right hand side\n\nof the road. She was then asked whether while walking on the right hand side of the road\n\nshe had looked to the rear for traffic. She said no. The next question was whether just\n\nbefore the accident she had crossed the road diagonally from the right to the left. Again\n\nshe answered no.15.\n\n        I then asked her whether looking towards the\n\nfront the accident had happened on the right hand side of the road or the left hand side.\n\nHer reply was she could not remember. I then asked where her husband was. She replied that\n\nhe was on her left and he was walking nearer to the parked cars. Madam Wu was then shown a\n\nphotograph of Circular Road and asked to point out the side of the road she was on with\n\nreference to the oncoming vehicle shown in the photograph. After seeing the photograph,\n\nshe stated that they were on the left-hand side of the road and agreed that the confusion\n\nin her evidence as to the side of the road they were walking on was because she did not\n\nknow the direction of the flow of the traffic.16.\n\n        Madam Wu was informed that her husband’s\n\nevidence was that just before the accident occurred, a car had passed both of them and she\n\nand her husband had then crossed the road diagonally towards a vacant parking lot on the\n\nleft hand side. Her reply was that it was not true and that since that accident, the\n\nplaintiff’s memory had failed him. She said that all times she was on the same side\n\nof the road and did not cross the road at any time. Their two friends, however, were\n\nwalking behind them on the other side of the road.17.\n\n        The first defendant’s car passed Madam Wu\n\nat the time when she was a few steps away from the vacant car park lot. The car did not\n\nstop alongside her but she did not notice whether after it passed her it had passed her\n\ncompletely. When the car passed, she continued to walk straight and at this juncture the\n\ncar reversed and knocked down her husband. She did not see the first defendant’s car\n\nknock down her husband. She only saw him fall forward but she was certain that the car\n\nknocked him down because after the plaintiff had fallen she turned around and saw the car.",
        "(iii) Mr Zhang Qi": "18.\n\n        Mr Zhang Qi stated that just before the\n\naccident he was walking with the fourth member of the party, Madam Jie, about ten metres\n\nbehind the plaintiff and Madam Wu. The plaintiff turned and called out to him to hurry up.\n\nMr Zhang moved forward and then saw a car driven by the first defendant coming towards the\n\nplaintiff and his wife. The plaintiff and Madam Wu walked to the left side of the road to\n\navoid the car. The car passed them and then stopped and suddenly reversed to where the\n\nplaintiff was walking and knocked into the plaintiff causing him to fall forward.19.\n\n        Under cross-examination, Mr Zhang maintained\n\nthat he and Madam Jie were walking along the right hand side of the road and that the\n\nplaintiff and his wife were walking on the left-hand side of the road. He was asked when\n\nthey started walking on the road whether there was an occasion when the plaintiff and\n\nMadam Wu crossed from the right hand side to left hand side. His reply was that as far as\n\nhe could remember, they did not cross the road. When he first noticed the first\n\ndefendant’s car approaching, the plaintiff and his wife were between 14 and 15 metres\n\nahead of Mr Zhang. Mr Zhang noticed the car because its headlights were on. Mr Zhang said\n\nat first that the first defendant’s car passed him and then stopped. Later, he\n\ncorrected himself and said that the car did not pass him. Actually it stopped in front of\n\nhim, about seven or eight metres ahead of him. He was asked whether the headlights of the\n\ncar were glaring at him when the vehicle stopped. At that stage, Mr Zhang said that he did\n\nnot really feel it and he thought that the headlight was not on but only a dim light.20.\n\n        Mr Zhang was asked whether he could see Madam\n\nWu and the plaintiff when the first defendant’s car stopped. He replied that he\n\ncould. They had taken evasive steps to avoid the car and after having done so, they\n\ncontinued to walk straight. At that time they were behind the car and walking away from\n\nit. After the car stopped, it started to reverse and Mr Zhang saw the car collide into the\n\nplaintiff. Mr Zhang was reminded of a question put to him in the criminal proceedings\n\nrelating to what had happened when he first saw the first defendant’s car. In that\n\ncourt, he had replied: ‘This happened very suddenly. I did not realise the vehicle\n\nknocked someone down. I did not notice this’. Counsel then said that Mr Zhang was now\n\nsaying that he had seen the collision and asked him what the correct version was. Mr\n\nZhang’s reply was that he did see the collision. In the Subordinate Court, his\n\nevidence was that he did not expect the first defendant’s car to knock down someone.\n\nHe did witness the collision and there was no reason for him to say that he did not\n\nwitness the collision. It should be noted that Mr Zhang had given testimony in the\n\nSubordinate Court that he saw the instant the car hit the plaintiff and the plaintiff fell\n\nand that this evidence was given during cross-examination after the portion of the\n\nevidence which counsel in this case read to Mr Zhang.21.\n\n        Mr Zhang was also asked whether he agreed that\n\nhe had not noticed the relative positions of the plaintiff and his wife just before the\n\nimpact. Mr Zhang disagreed. It was pointed out to him that in the earlier proceedings, he\n\nhad stated at one portion of his evidence that he did not notice the relative positions of\n\nthe plaintiff and his wife. Mr Zhang replied that he believed there must be a mistake. He\n\nremembered that he did tell the court that he could remember the relative positions before\n\nthey moved to the left and even now he clearly remembered their relative positions. In\n\nre-examination, Mr Zhang stated that in the criminal court he had done drawings of the\n\nrelative positions of the parties and he agreed that when he said he had given clear\n\nevidence about the relative positions he was referring to questions he had been asked\n\nabout these drawings showing the positions of the parties.",
        "(iv) The first defendant": "22.\n\n        In his affidavit, the first defendant stated\n\nthat whilst proceeding to reverse into a vacant car park lot along Upper Circular Road on\n\nthe night in question, he checked on his right to see whether there was sufficient space\n\nto reverse into the lot as there were vehicles occupying the parking lots in front of and\n\nbehind the empty lot. After engaging the reverse gear, he released the brakes and the car\n\nwas set in reverse motion. After checking on the right side, he turned to look at the left\n\nside and noticed a lady was waving at him to stop his vehicle. He immediately brought the\n\ncar to a halt. He got out of the car and inspected its rear. He noticed the plaintiff was\n\nsitting down behind his bumper. He called the ambulance and remained at the scene until\n\nthe plaintiff was conveyed to the hospital.23.\n\n        During cross-examination, the first defendant\n\nwas asked whether, whilst he was travelling along Circular Road and before he stopped, he\n\nhad seen anyone on his left-hand side walking along the road. He first replied that he\n\nremembered someone walking on the left-hand side, but there was no one on his right-hand\n\nside. He could not remember whether the pedestrian was male or female, young or old. When\n\nI asked him whether there had been just one person, he replied there might have been two.\n\nHe then agreed that he was not certain whether anyone was on his left and could not\n\nconfirm it. The first defendant did not recall seeing the plaintiff and Madam Wu before\n\nthe accident. He did not see them on the right-hand side though he was sure he would have\n\ndone so had they been there as his steering wheel was located on the right- hand side of\n\nhis car.24.\n\n        He stated that when he stopped the car he\n\nlooked into the rear view mirror to make sure there were no cars and people behind. At\n\nthat point there was no one behind him. Thereafter he looked to the right. He looked to\n\nthe right for between one and three seconds and then turned to look towards the back.\n\nHowever as he was looking to the right he released the brake. He was asked whether it was\n\nright to say there were a few seconds in which he was reversing and had not checked the\n\nback. The first defendant replied that that period could not have been longer than one or\n\ntwo seconds. He was then reminded that in the subordinate courts he had said that he had\n\nlooked to his right for four to five seconds and had engaged his reverse gear from the\n\nthird second onwards. Thus for the last one or two seconds of his check to the right, he\n\nhad already let go the break and was reversing. After that he physically turned to the\n\nleft to look through his rear windscreen and then he saw the plaintiff’s wife. At\n\nthat time he did not see the plaintiff.25.\n\n        It was put to the first defendant that he did\n\nnot see the plaintiff because he had already knocked him down by the time he turned to\n\nlook towards the back. His reply was that he did not know that. It was further put to him\n\nthat if he had looked back before reversing he would have avoided the accident and his\n\nreply to that question was \"that I would not know too\". The first defendant\n\nconfirmed that he had been convicted of a charge under section 65 of the Road Traffic Act\n\nand that he was not challenging that conviction.Findings26.\n\n        It was clear that the first defendant had been\n\nnegligent. He had admitted that his vehicle was already reversing while he was looking\n\ntowards his right and that he had not waited to check again in his rear view mirror before\n\nstarting to reverse. Further he had been convicted on a charge of driving without due care\n\nand attention for other road users and he had said in evidence that he was not challenging\n\nthat conviction.27.\n\n        The issue was whether the plaintiff had also\n\nbeen negligent. This depended on whether I accepted the story that he and his wife were\n\nalways on the left hand side of the road or whether I accepted the submission put forward\n\non behalf of the first defendant that they had originally been walking on the right hand\n\nside and had crossed to the left hand side just before the first defendant reversed his\n\ncar and had thereby walked into his path.28.\n\n        In the proceedings in the criminal court, the\n\nplaintiff himself, Madam Wu and Mr Zhang were very clear in their evidence that the\n\nplaintiff and his wife were already on the left-hand side when the first defendant’s\n\ncar passed them. It was not in evidence there that they had crossed the road diagonally.\n\nMadam Wu and Mr Zhang gave straight forward evidence that they, meaning the plaintiff and\n\nMadam Wu, had walked a distance along the left-hand side of the road before the plaintiff\n\nwas hit. In the criminal court, this version of events on the part of all three witnesses\n\nwas not shaken in cross examination.29.\n\n        Before me, Madam Wu and Mr Zhang repeated the\n\nsame story. It was only the plaintiff who changed his evidence. Madam Wu’s\n\nexplanation was that since the accident the plaintiff had become forgetful. This could\n\nhave been one reason for the change. Another contributing factor could have been that he\n\nwas feeling the strain of giving evidence from his stretcher in two separate courts within\n\nthe relatively short period of a month. It should also be noted that even though he said\n\nthat he had crossed the road, the plaintiff had also maintained at various points during\n\ncross-examination that when the first defendant’s car passed him he had moved to the\n\nleft to avoid the car. He would not have had to do this had he been on the right-hand side\n\nat that stage and only crossed the road after the car had passed. The plaintiff’s\n\naccount in this respect was wholly consistent with the version he recounted in the\n\ncriminal court and in his affidavit. The later inconsistency in his evidence when he\n\nappeared to indicate that the first defendant’s car had passed him on his left-hand\n\nside was, I think, due to some confusion on his part as the answer came at random at the\n\nend of his re-examination and was not directed towards the question his counsel had asked\n\nhim.30.\n\n        I preferred the evidence of Madam Wu and Mr\n\nZhang to that of the plaintiff on the issue of the plaintiff’s position on the road.\n\nThey were coherent and consistent. Neither of them was shaken in cross examination. They\n\nwere able to give convincing explanation for the reasons for the minor discrepancies that\n\narose in the course of their respective cross-examinations.31.\n\n        There was some difficulty with the first\n\ndefendant’s testimony. He did not appear willing to accept any part of the\n\nresponsibility for the accident. Further his memory of who had been on the road was not\n\ngood. If the plaintiff and Madam Wu had been walking along the right hand side of the road\n\nin front of Mr Zhang and Madam Jie, as his counsel wanted me to accept, surely the first\n\ndefendant would have had a clear impression of the presence of a number of people on that\n\nside of the road. As the photograph taken by the police showed, that night there were cars\n\nparked along both sides of the road thus leaving a relatively narrow space for vehicular\n\nand pedestrian traffic. Visibility was, however, good. In such circumstances the first\n\ndefendant would, if he had been paying attention to more than the presence of a vacant\n\nparking lot, have noticed the plaintiff and his friends. The fact that he did not see them\n\nat all either on his left (as his counsel alleged they must be) or two of them on his left\n\nand two of them on his right (taking their positions from Madam Wu’s account) must\n\nmean that he was not paying the necessary attention to the situation on the road and to\n\nthe presence of other road users at the time. It also means that at the time he started to\n\nreverse he did not have the presence of other road users in the forefront of his mind as\n\nit should have been.32.\n\n        Counsel for the first defendant submitted that\n\nthe plaintiff endangered himself by walking into the path of a car that was attempting to\n\npark. If I had accepted the plaintiff’s revised version of events I would have agreed\n\nwith this submission. However, I rejected that version because I was satisfied on weighing\n\nup all the available evidence that that was not what happened. I found as alleged by Madam\n\nWu and Mr Zhang that the plaintiff and his wife had been on the left hand side of the road\n\nall along and that the first defendant’s car had passed them, stopped and then\n\nreversed thus hitting the plaintiff. In these circumstances I was not able to hold that\n\nthe plaintiff had also been negligent. He had walked along the side of the road and had\n\nmoved aside in order to avoid the first defendant’s car and had then proceeded\n\nwalking forwards. He was not under any duty to turn to ensure that the first defendant was\n\nnot reversing towards him. No doubt the plaintiff would have been safer if he had walked\n\nalong the five foot way but since Circular Road is not an expressway he was not committing\n\nan offence by merely walking straight along the road at the side of the road.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
