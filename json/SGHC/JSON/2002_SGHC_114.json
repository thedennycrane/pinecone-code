        "The Decision of the Court": "19.    Gutteridge and Megrah’s Law of Bankers’ Commercial\n\nCredits (8thEdition) states :\"5-21 The benefit of an irrevocable credit which is not expressed\n\n  to be transferable may be made available to a third party where a beneficiary uses the\n\n  original credit in his favour as a security for a credit in favour of his supplier opened\n\n  either by the intermediary bank or by his own bank. This is called a back-to-back credit.\n\n  The original credit is delivered by the prime beneficiary to the bank issuing the\n\n  back-to-back credit. There are thus three banks involved : (i) the bank issuing the\n\n  original credit, (ii) the intermediary bank through which the credit is advised to the\n\n  beneficiary and to which the documents required must be presented, and (iii) the bank\n\n  issuing the second credit against the security of the first.…5-23 Back-to-back credits are not without risk. The documents tendered\n\n  to the issuing bank by the intermediary must be those called for by the issuing bank or\n\n  the credit will not be realizable and the bank issuing the back-to-back credit will not\n\n  have the security of the original credit, for he will not be able to comply with its\n\n  terms. \"20.    The Plaintiffs said the Rabo L/C was a back-to-back credit with\n\nthe BAP L/C and payment under the first was to be secured against funds received under the\n\nsecond. This was evidenced by the Defendants’ facility letter to Premjee (Singapore)\n\nrequiring all of the Defendants’ import L/Cs to be supported by acceptable export\n\nL/Cs and requiring the original BAP L/C to be lodged with the Defendants. It followed from\n\nthis contention that when funds were received under the BAP L/C, the Defendants could not\n\nrefuse payment under their Rabo L/C. On the other hand, the Defendants contended that the\n\ndocuments called for under the Rabo L/C were copies of the requisite certificates and the\n\nMate’s Receipt while those required under the BAP L/C were the original certificates\n\nand the bills of lading. The Plaintiffs contended, however, that the goods involved were\n\nthe same and the substance and nature of the documents called for were also the same.21.    In my view, the two L/Cs in question were back-to-back\n\ntransactions only in the sense that they dealt with the same cargo sold by the Plaintiffs\n\nto Premjee (Singapore) and then on-sold by Premjee (Singapore) to TPI Polene. They\n\nremained two separate transactions and two separate L/Cs. The documents simply did not\n\nmatch even if one set contained the copies while the other contained the originals. The\n\narrangement could not mean that receipt of payment under the BAP L/C necessarily triggered\n\noff the obligation to pay under the Rabo L/C. Similarly, payment under the Rabo L/C was\n\nnot dependent on receipt of funds under the BAP L/C first. As counsel for the Defendants\n\nput it rhetorically, \"If the documents under the Rabo L/C were compliant and the\n\ndocuments under the BAP L/C were not, would the Plaintiffs agree that we need not pay them\n\nbecause we have not been paid by BAP?\". It was plain that the Defendants here were\n\nnot merely a conduit for the payments.22.    Were the documents discrepant? That would be a question of fact\n\nin each case. The Plaintiffs accepted the legal position that documents tendered to the\n\nissuing bank for negotiation of a L/C must comply strictly with the terms of the L/C. They\n\ncontended, however, that strict compliance did not mean literal compliance to the extent\n\nof dotting the \" i \" and crossing the \" t \", that insignificant or\n\ntrivial differences such as typographical errors in names ought not to be regarded as\n\ndiscrepancies justifying refusal of payment under a L/C and that documents should be\n\ntreated as having conformed to the requirements of a L/C so long as, properly read and\n\nunderstood, they did not contain any discrepancy which called for an inquiry or\n\ninvestigation or invited litigation. For these propositions, the Plaintiffs relied on the\n\nearlier cited authority as well asDocumentary Credits (Third Edition)by Raymond\n\nJack, Ali Malek and David Quest,Law of Pledges, Guarantees and Letters of Credit\n\n(Fourth Edition)by Poh Chu Chai and the Court of Appeal’s decision inIndian\n\nOverseas Bank v United Coconut Oil Mills Inc[1993] 1 SLR 141. Reference was also made\n\nto Article 13 (Standard for Examination of Documents) and Article 14 (Discrepant Documents\n\nand Notice) in the International Chamber of Commerce Uniform Customs and Practice for\n\nDocumentary Credits (UCP 500).23.    The Plaintiffs submitted that the overdrawing on the L/C was not\n\na discrepancy since the tonnage of coal had a 5% margin of difference either way and\n\n74,002 MT compared with the specified 71,000 MT was within that margin. The L/C also had a\n\nprice adjustment formula and permitted a claim on the basis of the adjusted price. The\n\nsame formula applied to both the BAP L/C and the Rabo L/C. The BAP L/C was in fact\n\noverdrawn by US$105,226.50 because of this. In the previous two dealings in which the\n\nDefendants were the issuing bank, the same price adjustment formula was also present and\n\nwas applied. The Defendants had prepared and sent bills of exchange for the full amount\n\nstated in the Plaintiffs’ invoice to Premjee (Singapore) inspite of their assertions.\n\nThe Defendants were more than adequately covered by the excess paid under the BAP L/C\n\nanyway.24.    The Defendants’ position was that the invoiced amount could\n\nbe different subject to the cap put on the amount of credit. The Plaintiffs could have\n\nsought an amendment to the Rabo L/C but did not do so. The Defendants relied on Gutteridge\n\nand Megrah which states (at pages 197 and 198) that \"it is not open to the\n\nbeneficiary to claim more than the amount stipulated and where the credit specifies that\n\nit is subject to some limitation in amount. The bank may refuse to pay if this condition\n\nis disregarded\". Article 37 (b) of the UCP states that \"unless otherwise\n\nstipulated in the Credit, banks may refuse commercial invoices issued for amounts in\n\nexcess of the amount permitted by the Credit\". Further Article 39 (b) of the UCP\n\nprovides that \"a tolerance on the quantity signed of 5% more or 5% less is\n\npermissible always provided that the amount of the drawings does not exceed the amount of\n\nthe Credit\". In this case, the commercial invoice tendered by the Plaintiffs was\n\noverdrawn beyond the credit tolerance of +/- 5% stipulated in the Rabo L/C.25.    I agreed with the Defendants on this point. It was a discrepancy\n\nwhich was clearly material whatever the excess might have been.26.    Where the discrepancies involving the certificates were\n\nconcerned, I accepted the Defendants’ position that the unit of measurement, and not\n\nmerely the numbers, ought to have been stated clearly in the test results of the\n\nrespective certificates. A bank could not be expected to assume a number next to a quality\n\ntested must necessarily have used the same unit of measurement as stated in the L/C. Banks\n\nare not expected to know detailed trade customs or the jargon used so as to be able to\n\nform an opinion whether particular words in a document have the same meaning as the terms\n\nused in a L/C (seeEnglish, Scottish and Australian Bank Ltd v Bank of South Africa[1922] 13 LLR 21). The Defendants’ officers were not expected to know the jargon and\n\nmeasurements in the coal trade even if some of them should gain some familiarity over the\n\ncourse of time. Similarly, it would be foolhardy of them to assume that certain numbers\n\nhave been misaligned on the documents and were meant to refer to words on another line in\n\nanother column or that certain technical words have been misspelt.27.    Where the Mate’s Receipt was concerned, it seemed to me from\n\na cursory look at the document that the agent had signed on behalf of the named master of\n\nthe vessel and that there was no uncertainty as alleged. The question of faxing over of\n\nthe Mate’s Receipt was no longer in issue.28.    The only discrepancy relied on by the Defendants which I thought\n\nbordered very closely on nitpicking was the issue concerning the Plaintiffs’ address\n\nin the certificate of sampling and analysis being different from that stated in the L/C.\n\nThe certificate had the Plaintiffs’ address as \"Jl. Jend. Sudirman kav. 29\n\n– 31\" whereas the Rabo L/C stated it as \"Jl. Jend. Sudirman kav. 31\".\n\nAll other particulars of the address were the same in both documents.29.    Having found that the Defendants were justified in their view\n\nthat there were at least some valid discrepancies in the documents, I agreed with the\n\nPlaintiffs that the Defendants were estopped from relying on such to refuse payment in the\n\ncircumstances. The Defendants had stated their stand to the Plaintiffs in their Advice of\n\nRefusal of Documents that they would refer the discrepancies to Premjee (Singapore) for\n\nacceptance and it was patent that the applicants of the Rabo L/C had accepted all\n\ndiscrepancies and had conveyed such acceptance to the Defendants. The Plaintiffs came to\n\nknow about this fact. The Plaintiffs had relied on the Defendants’ unequivocal\n\nposition and had therefore not taken any steps to rectify the documents.30.    The amended Arrival Notice was clearly an afterthought and was\n\ncreated by the Defendants because they had got wind of Premjee (Singapore) being placed\n\nunder interim Judicial Management by then. They decided to set off the funds received\n\nagainst the outstanding debts of the company on 12 October 2000. To achieve that, they had\n\nto avoid payment on the Rabo L/C and they sought to do that by feigning an error in their\n\nArrival Notice, knowing that Premjee (Singapore) was in no position to contend with them\n\nin the matter. In any event, even if they were entitled to alter their unequivocal\n\ndocument so fundamentally, the fact remained that Premjee (Singapore) had accepted\n\nwhatever discrepancies there were and had already informed the Defendants in writing.31.    The Plaintiffs’ claim in conversion and their allegation of\n\ncollusion between the Defendants and Premjee (Singapore) in causing the bills of lading to\n\nbe improperly issued were not seriously pursued. The contention was that the Defendants,\n\nby using the Plaintiffs’ documents of title (the bills of lading and the original\n\ncertificates) in negotiating the BAP L/C and then refusing to pay the Plaintiffs for their\n\ncargo, had converted the bills of lading and the cargo they represented. A. S. Krishnan\n\nhad signed a letter of indemnity on behalf of the charterers of the vessel (another\n\ncompany in the Premjee Group) allowing the cargo to be released without a bill of lading.\n\nThe discharge in Thailand took place between 28 September and 4 October 2000 and the cargo\n\nwas therefore gone by the time the Defendants negotiated the BAP L/C on 6 October 2000.\n\nThere was also no evidence of any such alleged collusion between the Defendants and\n\nPremjee (Singapore). Accordingly, the claims in conversion and of collusion failed.32.    It was unconscionable for the Defendants to alter their Arrival\n\nNotice on 12 October 2000 and to change their stand and decide on a set off when the funds\n\nshould have gone to the Plaintiffs. By doing so, they improved their position to the\n\ndetriment of the Plaintiffs who were entitled to be paid under the Rabo L/C. In any event,\n\nthe Defendants were only entitled to set off the amount in respect of their freight loan\n\nas that arose out of the transaction but were not entitled to set off against what was due\n\nto the Plaintiffs (Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp v Kloeckner & Co AG[1989] 3 AER 513).33.    In the result, I gave judgment for the Plaintiffs for\n\nUS$1,297,255.06 with interest at 6% per annum from the date of the writ till payment.\n\nAfter taking into consideration my findings for and against the Plaintiffs in their claim,\n\nI decided to award them 80% of the costs of the proceedings.Sgd:TAY YONG KWANGJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
