        "Reliability of the corrected radar data is an issue in the United States proceedings": "48.    It is worth noting that the reliability of the\n\ncorrected radar data is an issue in proceedings in the United States against, inter alia,\n\nBoeing, with respect to the crash of Flight MI 185. In those proceedings, the American\n\ncounsel for some of the plaintiffs in the present case went so far as to insinuate that\n\neveryone who corrected the radar data \"eyeballed it so that it could work out\n\nright\", an accusation which was of course denied. The following extract from\n\nBoeing’s Mr Martin Ingham’s deposition provides a rather clear picture of the\n\nposition:Q.    Well, basically what you did was you took the raw data …,\n\n  decided that that has to be in error because of some other things that you looked at, --A. Right….Q. … [A]nd you just moved itso that it would work out right\n\n  from your point of view in terms of the track of the airplane.A. The process that moved this was deemed satisfactory to all the\n\n  members who reviewed this, not just Boeing, but the NTSB as well as Raytheon, so it was an\n\n  accepted correction by all the parties….Q. Without the pejorative connotation of the term eyeballing, what you\n\n  did was you found a data point that you didn’t like and you moved it to where you\n\n  thought it should be?A. We found data points that were not correct and we corrected them.49.    Boeing’s representative, Mr Ingham, agreed\n\nthat the correction of one of the radar points resulted in it being moved some two and a\n\nhalf miles from its uncorrected point because, in his own words, \"the azimuth data\n\nthat was used to produce the original data for that particular point was in error.\"\n\nThis change resulted in a different flight trajectory. When cross-examined, Captain Baston\n\nsaid:Q. [B]ecause it’s already displaced, the starting point is\n\n  displaced by two and a half nautical miles, there will be a different set of trajectory.A. Yes.(V/N p 471)50.    It is not surprising that SilkAir’s counsel,\n\nMr Lok, pointed out that it is ironical that while the plaintiffs relied on the corrected\n\nradar data in the present proceedings, they were challenging the reliability of the said\n\ndata in their actions in the United States.",
        "Projected descent below 19,500 feet was also criticised": "51.    Apart from criticising the corrected radar data,\n\nProfessor Howe was also wary of the projected descent of the aircraft from an altitude of\n\n19,500 feet to ground level. When cross-examined about the projected descent of the\n\naircraft to the point of impact, he explained why he had reservations about it when he\n\nsaid as follows:Q. And what about right to the descent of the aircraft … at\n\n  impact?A. The data doesn’t go beyond that because the last radar point\n\n  was at 19,500 [feet] and anything that goes beyond that point down is pure assumption\n\n  because we had no eye witnesses as far as I know with a watch in their hand measuring the\n\n  time of impact.(V/N p 1305)52.    Captain Galan also had reservations about the\n\nprojected descent of the aircraft from an altitude of 19,500 feet to ground level. When\n\ncross-examined, he said as follows:Q. [L]et’s assume there was no radar data at all. Don’t you\n\n  think you can tell what the rate of descent was?A. If we don’t know the exact time of the crash. We can’t.\n\n  No.(V/N p 1133)",
        "The irrelevant evidence regarding the uncorrected radar data": "53.    At this juncture, it ought to be noted that\n\nProfessor Howe’s evidence that the corrected radar data relied upon in the\n\nNTSC’s Final Report differed from the uncorrected radar data in a document furnished\n\nto him by someone from Singapore Airlines cannot be taken into account because the\n\nauthenticity of the said document was not established. The exclusion of this portion of\n\nhis evidence does not affect the veracity of his assertion that the corrected radar data\n\nis flawed. When Mr Khoo SC suggested that his assertion that the corrected radar data is\n\ninaccurate rested on an unknown source of radar data, Professor Howe replied as follows:No, no, no, based on the implications of that data in terms of what it\n\n  means in Mach number of the aircraft at the end but nothing to do with unknown source.\n\n  Completely ignore that. On the data as presented, it gives to me an unrealistic flight\n\n  path requiring the aircraft to achieve Mach numbers which are outside anything that any of\n\n  the witnesses said can be achieved.(V/N p 1302)54.    When subsequently questioned by Mr Lok, Professor\n\nHowe reiterated that his conclusions on the inaccuracy of the corrected radar data remain\n\nvalid even if the document containing the uncorrected radar data is totally disregarded.\n\nHe said as follows:Q. And .. the problem you have [with respect to the data] irrespective\n\n  of, that means independent of, the set of initial radar data that you were given by\n\n  somebody from [Singapore Airlines]?A. Yes, it’s nothing to do with that.(V/N p 1321)Extent of the applicability of the simulation tests55.    Apart from doubting the accuracy of the corrected\n\nradar data, Professor Howe also questioned the extent to which simulation test results may\n\nbe applied to a case such as this, where the aircraft had already flown beyond its flight\n\nenvelope or limits. The NTSC was fully aware of this. In its response to the NTSB’s\n\ncomments on its draft Final Report, the NTSC stated that it \"recognised that\n\nsimulation tests cannot fully replicate actual flight conditions especially flight\n\nconditions beyond the normal flight envelope\".56.    Professor Howe said that simulation studies are\n\nonly useful when investigating situations occurring within the normal flight envelope. In\n\npara 14 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he said as follows:The Final Report [of the NTSC] does suggest (paragraph 2.10) that the\n\n  combination of maximum nose-down trim setting of the actuator and aileron can result in\n\n  the aircraft entering an uncontrolled spiral. There is however no evidence that this\n\n  occurred. This postulation is based on simulation studies conducted by the NTSC, NTSB and\n\n  Boeing. In my opinion, simulation studies are only useful tools when investigating\n\n  situations occurring within the normal flight envelope. If an aircraft goes beyond the\n\n  test clearance flight envelope, as the radar readings in this case clearly indicate, any\n\n  simulation study is based on pure extrapolation beyond a certain point. It is\n\n  inappropriate to place any reliance on such studies as proof in these cases.57.    When questioned by Mr Lok, Professor Howe\n\nelucidated his view in the following terms:…. Clearly, what I am saying is that very early on, possibly soon\n\n  after 31,900 feet, down here somewhere, the aircraft went right outside the extrapolated\n\n  data even which, in fact, is the validated area for the simulator.… [T]herefore any\n\n  attempt to match these radar points to simulator studies is not tenable because the radar\n\n  points actually show the aircraft going a long way outside anything that any simulator has\n\n  been validated for. And so conclusions made that the flight which is being proposed by\n\n  NTSB, for example, and I believe also followed by the plaintiffs that the simulator\n\n  studies can actually confirm what happened to the aeroplane, I believe, is erroneous.(V/N p 1206)58.    Captain Baston accepted that the aircraft went\n\noutside its flight envelope shortly after it commenced its descent from its cruising\n\naltitude of 35,000 feet. When questioned by Mr Khoo SC, he said as follows:Q.    In this case, where would the aircraft have exceeded the test\n\n  flight clearance envelope? ….A.    Just above 30,000 feet.Q.    …. And thereafter, the aircraft would have entered into an\n\n  unknown area?A.    Yes.Q.    Not tested at all by either the manufacturer or anybody else?A.    Correct.(V/N p 885)The horizontal stabilizer59.    Apart from questioning the veracity of the\n\nprojected flight path of the aircraft’s final descent and the applicability of the\n\nsimulation tests, Professor Howe also thought that the plaintiffs’ case did not rest\n\non solid ground because it depended to a great extent on the fact that the horizontal\n\nstabilizer trim was found to be at 2.5 units when it was recovered from the wreckage. As\n\nhas been mentioned, this matched the forward limit of a pilot’s ability to operate\n\nthe main electrical trim to put the aircraft in the steepest possible nose-down position.60.    Although the NTSC asserted that there was no\n\nevidence that pilot input was responsible for the final position of the horizontal\n\nstabilizer trim, the plaintiffs insisted that the fact that it was found to be at 2.5\n\nunits must be taken into account when determining whether or not that the aircraft was\n\nintentionally crashed. Professor Howe, who declared that the \"pivotal aspect\"\n\nupon which the dissenting NTSB report relied on is that the setting of the horizontal\n\nstabilizer trim actuator was found to be in the maximum cruise nose-down trim position,\n\nwas not convinced that this was the final setting by the pilots. In paras 11-12 of his\n\naffidavit of evidence-in-chief, he stated:11. It should firstly be pointed out that examination of photographs of\n\n  the recovered wreckage indicates that the setting of the nut on the ball screw may\n\n  actually be at some position between the normal cruise and maximum cruise nose-down trim\n\n  position …..(c) On the basis of the location of fracture, a calculation of\n\n    approximately 3.05 units trim setting is obtained….This, if correct, does indicate that the stabilizer was not at the\n\n    maximum nose-down trim.12. Further, even if the NTSC is correct to say that the ball screw\n\n  actuator was at the maximum cruise nose-down setting at the time of the recovery of the\n\n  wreckage, there is no evidence that it was at this setting position at the time of the\n\n  initial descent of the aircraft from its controlled cruising flight. In fact, the\n\n  simulation study of the Cranfield Impact Centre has shown that should the ball screw/nut\n\n  unit be severed from the drive unit at its lower end and the stabilizer arm at its upper\n\n  end, the nut can rotate on the screw even under substantial friction conditions. Such a\n\n  severance of the ball screw/nut assembly could well have occurred at the time when the\n\n  horizontal stabilizer disintegrated and parts separated from the rest of the airframe.61.    When cross-examined, Professor Howe explained his\n\nposition in the following terms:… [O]ne of the few things we do know in this accident is that\n\n  certain parts of the horizontal stabilizer failed due to flutter…. A flutter failure\n\n  is a very, very violent failure indeed…. The Boeing estimation was that there were 22\n\n  oscillations per second ….The only issue is when it occurred. And my proposal is it\n\n  actually occurred at some time during the descent of the aircraft, at the time in fact the\n\n  horizontal stabilizer fluttered and failed. Looking at the nature of the wreckage from\n\n  wreckage photographs, also indicates that there may have been some damage to the ball\n\n  screw actuator subsequent to that failure indicating that at impact, there may have been\n\n  further damage which may not have occurred had it been attached to the impact point.…\n\n  So my contention is that there could well have been a failure of the attachment of the\n\n  ball screw actuator to the front of the horizontal stabilizer in the fuselage, and that\n\n  this failure having occurred, the ball screw itself could then rotate because it was no\n\n  longer constrained, and turn through a number of turns in a relatively short period.(V/N pp 1189-1191)62.    Mr Lok pointed out that while Professor\n\nHowe’s view is based on the results of the tests undertaken by the Cranfield Impact\n\nCentre, the plaintiffs’ expert witnesses had not carried out any independent\n\nexperiment to verify the final setting of the horizontal stabilizer trim before the\n\nseparation of the actuator from the rest of the airframe. As such, they were in no\n\nposition to challenge Professor Howe’s view. In fact, Captain Laming conceded that it\n\nwas possible that the horizontal stabilizer trim may not have been finally set at 2.5\n\nunits. (V/N p 329) However, he added that whether or not the horizontal stabilizer trim\n\nwas at 2.5 units or 3.05 units was not fundamental to his conclusions. When questioned by\n\nMr Khoo SC, he explained as follows:Q. Would it have mattered to your conclusion whether the forward trim\n\n  was at 3.05 or 2.5 units in respect of the descent – rate of descent, angle of dive?A. No, very little difference.Q. And could you explain to his Honour why? ….A. Because once the stabiliser trim is moved out of its normal cruise\n\n  position for several seconds, each second becomes more critical. So we are talking, I\n\n  think, 10 seconds from 4.5 to 2.5 and 7 seconds from 4.5 to 3.05. That is still … a\n\n  most unusually long completed application of the trim. It will still cause a very steep\n\n  dive; a most unusual application.(V/N p 387)63.    Professor Howe, who was not prepared to concede\n\nthat the horizontal stabilizer trim was finally set at 3.05 units when the aircraft\n\nstarted to descend, said that it could have been set at a higher number. When questioned\n\nby Mr Lok, he said as follows:Q. [B]ased on this study, you feel that at the point of impact, it\n\n  would have been 3.05 [units]?A. That is correct.Q. But that reading of 3.05 may not necessarily be the final setting of\n\n  the horizontal stabilizer at the point of the descent of the plane?A. At the point the aircraft started to descend, no. I would agree that\n\n  it was not necessarily set at 3.05.Q. And that is your evidence before this court?A. Yes.(V/N p 1208)64.    Taking all circumstances into account, Professor\n\nHowe’s evidence on the final setting of the horizontal stabilizer trim gives much\n\nfood for thought.Whether the pilots attempted to recover the aircraft65.    The plaintiffs’ assertion that the pilots\n\ndid not attempt to recover the aircraft from its dive into the Musi River will next be\n\nconsidered. The plaintiffs relied on the following comments of the NTSB on the NTSC’s\n\ndraft Final Report to support their assertion:Regardless of the reason for the airplane’s departure from cruise\n\n  flight, it could have been easily recovered using conventional techniques that both pilots\n\n  had received training for and that were within the capabilities of both pilots. Further,\n\n  there was ample time for the pilots to take such corrective action to return the airplane\n\n  to a straight and level attitude and flight. … It is apparent that, had the pilot\n\n  attempted to recover by initiating immediate corrective action using standard flight\n\n  control inputs and techniques, the airplane would have recovered to a straight and level\n\n  altitude with a minimum loss of altitude.66.    SilkAir’s counsel, Mr Lok, contended that it\n\ncould not be assumed that the pilots did not try to recover the aircraft. After all, the\n\nNTSC had noted as follows in its comments on the NTSB’s views:There was no evidence that the recovery of the airplane was not\n\n  attempted. The fact that during impact the engine was in high power and that the\n\n  undercarriage was retracted do not preclude the possibility of pilot attempts to recover\n\n  from the steep dive by using flight controls and varying engine thrust.67.    Mr Lok accepted that the textbook procedure for\n\neffecting an emergency descent in the face of rapid cabin depressurisation is to\n\nsimultaneously retard the thrust levers, deploy the speed brakes and initiate the descent\n\nof the aircraft. However, he added that a pilot who is executing an emergency descent may,\n\ndepending on the circumstances of the case, find it necessary to increase the engine\n\nthrust. His argument was supported by Captain Galan, who said that a failure to accelerate\n\nmay, in some cases, result in a bad descent. He explained the position as follows:You could have two different sorts of descent which [are] no\n\n  good…. The very bad descent is a descent in which you don’t accelerate. You\n\n  descend but in keeping your actual speed. In this case, … this descent will be a bad\n\n  one because you need a long time to descend to 10,000 feet which is around the good\n\n  altitude to end in emergency descent. You take a long time, you need maybe something like\n\n  two, three minutes, which is too long because in the certification pattern, we have a\n\n  minimum time to follow. So pilots are trained not to use this way, this pattern. There is\n\n  another bad descent which is to try to descend too much, too quick and to accelerate\n\n  before reducing the engine….(V/N pp 1029-1030)68.    Professor Howe agreed that it could not be\n\nassumed that the pilots did not try to recover the aircraft from its dive. When\n\ncross-examined, he said as follows:Q.    Leaving aside the radar results, we find at the bottom of the\n\n  river, a throttle box - …. Full thrust forward …. Nose speed brakes, engines in\n\n  high rotation. Is that consistent with an attempt to recover?A. I cannot answer that question. I would say you were right in\n\n  suggesting it may not be. But then, I do not know what the final flight path of the\n\n  aircraft was at the time when final control of the aircraft was lost. The pilot may have\n\n  been attempting to recover from a dive, in which case he may have wanted to lift the nose\n\n  of the aircraft up. He certainly might, what not, speed brakes. I cannot answer that\n\n  question but I don’t believe we have enough scenario information at all.(V/N p 1283)69.    Professor Howe added that having an increased\n\nengine thrust could retard the dive of a plane. When questioned by Mr Lok, he said as\n\nfollows:Q. And in your understanding, a throttle in high thrust, could that be\n\n  used --- could that be evidence of a possible application by the pilot to recover the\n\n  plane?A. Yes, because it will give a nose-up pitch and it will tend to give\n\n  him a more horizontal flight path.(V/N p 1322)70.    Captain Laming accepted that having the engines\n\non high thrust could retard the dive of an aircraft. When cross-examined, he said as\n\nfollows:Q.    Would it be correct … that if the thrust is increased to the\n\n  engines, that the increased thrust would provide an additional lift to the plane?A.    That is true.Q.    …. [T]herefore the fact that the engines are put at high\n\n  thrust, could it have the effect of … retarding the dive of the plane?A.    That could be.Q.    …. [It] is therefore not necessary in fact for the engines to\n\n  be at high thrust for your theory?A.    If you had the engines off … I think the dive will probably\n\n  be steeper.(V/N p 363)71.    Mr Lok submitted that as an increased thrust\n\nprovides additional lift to an aircraft and could be an indication of recovery action by\n\nthe pilots, the only inference that can be drawn from the evidence with respect to the\n\nthrottle box is that if the pilots had applied forward thrust, they must have intended to\n\nrecover the aircraft from its dive and not to destroy it. What may be said with confidence\n\nis that the fact that the engines were at high power before the crash does not, without\n\nmore, assist the plaintiffs in establishing that the aircraft was deliberately crashed.72.    It should also be borne in mind that recovery of\n\nan aircraft becomes more difficult once it has left its normal flight envelope. Captain\n\nGalan made it clear that the ability to control the aircraft in question during its final\n\ndescent must be viewed in the context of an aircraft that had inadvertently left its\n\nflight envelope.73.    Mr Job accepted that it is more difficult to\n\nrecover an aircraft once it has left its flight envelope. When questioned by Mr Khoo SC,\n\nhe said as follows:Q. Assuming a pilot who did that input, nose down trim, elevator is\n\n  down, had wanted to make a recovery at say, 18,000 or 15,000 feet, at 15,000 feet, could\n\n  he have made a recovery?A. This is entering into the area of very high Mach numbers and the\n\n  behaviour of an aircraft is unpredictable in that area. I’m not qualified to say what\n\n  degree of recovery could have been achieved in that area. But it would have been\n\n  difficult.(V/N p 813)74.    When questioned further by Mr Khoo SC, Mr Job\n\naccepted that it is possible that there was an attempted recovery of the aircraft from its\n\ndive but this failed because the aircraft went beyond the point of recoverability. (V/N p\n\n863)75.    The question of recovering an aircraft which has\n\nleft its flight envelope was also noted by the NTSC, which recommended that flight crew be\n\ntrained in \"recovery from high speed flight upsets beyond the normal flight\n\nenvelope… to enhance pilot awareness on the possibility of unexpected hazardous\n\nflight situations\". The NTSB objected to this recommendation as it implied that the\n\nNTSC had concluded that the accident may have been caused by an unexpected unusual flight\n\nupset and that the flight crew had not been properly trained to handle the aircraft in\n\nsuch a situation. The NTSC responded to the NTSB’s objection in the following terms:The evidence showed that the airplane had exceeded its flight envelope\n\n  during its high-speed transonic descent…. This recommendation is to generate crew\n\n  awareness of the narrow margin between the normal high-speed flight regime and the limits\n\n  of the flight envelope, and the hazards of exceeding the normal flight envelope.Whether the CVR and FDR were intentionally disconnected76.    No discussion of whether or not the aircraft was\n\nintentionally crashed will be complete without a consideration of the plaintiffs’\n\nallegation that the CVR and FDR were deliberately disabled to hide the sinister intention\n\nof the errant pilot or pilots to down the aircraft. In their view, someone in the cockpit\n\nintentionally tampered with the circuit breakers of the equipment.77.    The NTSC stated that an examination of the CVR\n\nand the FDR revealed no malfunction of the units. As far as the CVR is concerned, its\n\nmanufacturers, Allied Signals, reported that the loss of power was most likely not due to\n\nthe pulling of the circuit breaker as there was no audio indication of such an act. A\n\nsubsequent test revealed that the ambient noise of an aircraft in the air could obscure\n\nany sound resulting from the pulling of the circuit breaker. The result of this test does\n\nnot establish whether or not the circuit breaker had been pulled out. As such, there is no\n\nevidence that the circuit breaker had been pulled out by someone in the cockpit.78.    The NTSC pointed out that the stoppage of the CVR\n\nand FDR could be attributed to a loss of power supply to the units but noted that there\n\nwas no evidence to explain this. It added that a break in the wire supplying power to the\n\nCVR could also have led to its stoppage but as only a limited amount of electrical wires\n\nwas found, it could not be determined if this had caused the equipment to stop running. In\n\nview of the uncertainties, the NTSC concluded that the cause of the stoppage of the CVR\n\nand the FDR could not be conclusively determined and that there was no evidence to explain\n\nthe time difference of six minutes between the stoppage of the CVR and FDR.79.    Professor Howe agreed that there was no evidence\n\nto support the plaintiffs’ assertion that the CVR and FDR had been intentionally\n\ndisconnected. In para 8 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he stated as follows:The Final Report [of the NTSC] indicates that the stoppage of the CVR\n\n  was not due to a short circuit or overload. The Report accepts that both the CVR and the\n\n  FDR may have stopped as a result of a loss of power supply. (In the case of the FDR, the\n\n  possibility that the unit malfunctioned was also not ruled out.) While the NTSB has\n\n  strongly suggested that the loss of power was due to manual interference, there is no real\n\n  evidence to support this suggestion. The fact that the stoppages were not simultaneous has\n\n  not been explained but it is not unreasonable to imply the possibility that a progressive\n\n  power supply failure occurred.80.    SilkAir’s counsel, Mr Lok, submitted that\n\nthe fact that the aircraft’s transponders failed to work after the aircraft went\n\nbelow 19,500 feet indicated that a likely cause of the stoppage of the CVR and FDR was\n\nprogressive electrical failure. For the aircraft to be tracked, its transponders had to\n\nsend a signal to the radar station. As has been mentioned, the aircraft was last tracked\n\non the radar screen when it was at an altitude of 19,500 feet. As it was projected that\n\nthe aircraft broke up while it was between an altitude of 5,000 to 12,000 feet, it should\n\nhave been tracked on the radar screen a number of times before it broke up. The radar\n\nequipment on the ground was not faulty and other aircraft in the vicinity were tracked at\n\nthe material time.81.    Mr Lok pointed out that the possibility that the\n\naircraft’s transponders had no electrical power after the last recorded radar sweep\n\nat 19,500 feet was conceded by Boeing’s Mr Ingham in proceedings in the United\n\nStates. The following excerpts from his answers to questions posed by some of the\n\nplaintiffs’ American counsel during those proceedings may be borne in mind for the\n\nsole purpose of noting that the possibility of a loss of electrical power was considered:Q. So one of the scenarios that could explain the absence of a radar\n\n  reply in the period subsequent to the time the aircraft was at 19,500 feet would be the\n\n  loss of electrical power to the transponder, correct?A. That’s a possibility….Q. You talked about speculating why the radar didn’t pick up the\n\n  aircraft between 19,500 feet, and one of the scenarios could have been a loss of\n\n  electrical power. Did you have any other scenarios that you speculated could have caused\n\n  this anomaly?A. Nothing that came to mind other than loss of electrical power.82.    Captain Laming disagreed that the failure of the\n\ntransponders was due to progressive electrical failure but conceded that this was a\n\npossibility. When cross-examined, he said as follows:Q. Would [your opinion that there was no electrical failure] be changed\n\n  by knowing now that the transponder stopped sending messages eight seconds after the last\n\n  radar sweep at 19,500 feet?A. … I wouldn’t be surprised if [the transponder] did stop\n\n  transponding. As I said, I think you are in an area which no person has ever flown before,\n\n  so who knows what … occurring inside the cockpit, inside the boxes where the\n\n  electrical equipment is. It is an area we never tested…. I think we are in an area of\n\n  complete unknown but I think to speculate that it is a progressive electrical failure, I\n\n  don’t agree. That’s only an opinion.Q. Would you agree that there would be a possibility of that?A. As I said before, Sir, there was a possibility; anything is\n\n  possible.(V/N pp 359-360)83.    Captain Galan, who doubted that the black boxes\n\nhad been disabled for the purpose of concealing evidence, opined that if a pilot wanted to\n\nconceal any evidence of his alleged misdeed, he would have crashed the aircraft into the\n\nopen sea as that would have concealed more evidence of his intention than a crash in\n\nSumatra. Whether or not he is correct need not be considered. All that needs to be said is\n\nthat it was not established that the CVR and FDR had been deliberately disabled. In fact,\n\nas far as the FDR is concerned, even Mr Job, the plaintiffs’ expert witness, conceded\n\nthat there was no evidence as to why it stopped recording. (V/N p 838)Other possible causes of the crash84.    While arguing that there is no basis for a\n\nfinding that Flight MI 185 was intentionally crashed by pilot inputs in the cockpit,\n\nProfessor Howe pointed out that there could be other possible causes of the disaster,\n\nnamely mechanical or electrical failure and rapid depressurisation.85.    When considering whether or not mechanical\n\nfailure could be a cause of the crash, the NTSB suggested that the NTSC’s Final\n\nReport state that \"there was no evidence of a mechanical malfunction or failure of\n\nany flight control PCU or actuator that either caused or contributed to Flight MI\n\n185’s departure from cruise flight or the resulting accident\". However, the\n\nNTSC, which declined to rule out mechanical failure as a possible cause of the crash,\n\nexplained its position as follows:The evidence available does not rule out that there were no\n\n  airplane-related mechanical malfunctions or failures as only 73% of the wreckage was\n\n  recovered, most of which was highly fragmented. It is for this reason that NTSC has not\n\n  made any conclusions on this. NTSC has taken the consistent position throughout the final\n\n  report that conclusions must be backed by evidence.86.    The NTSC’s refusal to rule out mechanical\n\nmalfunction as a possible cause of the crash was endorsed by Professor Howe, who thought\n\nthat mechanical failure included the possibility of electrical failure.87.    SilkAir maintained that the possibility of rudder\n\nfailure should not be excluded. Mr Lok pointed out that in proceedings in the United\n\nStates against Boeing and manufacturers of parts of the aircraft, the plaintiffs had\n\nalleged that the crash had been caused by, inter alia, the main power control unit of the\n\naircraft rudder.88.    As far as the question of rudder problems is\n\nconcerned, the NTSC stated its position in the following terms:In view of the FAA 737 Flight Controls Engineering Test and\n\n  Evaluation Board Report and the FAA AD --- which recommends that ---, the NTSC is of the\n\n  view that this section should not contain a conclusion statement on whether the rudder PCU\n\n  was or was not a cause or contributing factor in the accident.89.    Professor Howe did not discount the possibility\n\nof rudder problems being a cause of the crash of Flight MI 185. He stated in para 9 of his\n\naffidavit of evidence-in-chief as follows:[Mechanical failure] is certainly a possibility that has not been\n\n  disproved.The Final Report [of the NTSC] itself makes reference to issues raised\n\n  with respect to rudder problems of B-737s in the aircraft accidents in Colorado Springs,\n\n  Pittsburgh and Bournemouth. The Final Report indicates that thermal shock leading to\n\n  rudder reversal arising from warm hydraulic fluid was unlikely in temperatures created\n\n  during real flight; and that corrosion to the electrical and electronic compartment\n\n  leading to uncommanded rudder movement was unlikely based on inspection of a sister\n\n  SilkAir B-737. It has to be accepted that no positive evidence is present to prove rudder\n\n  failure. Equally however, there is no evidence that conclusively excludes this\n\n  possibility.90.    Mr Khoo SC pointed out that if any rudder failure\n\nsimilar to that which occurred in the Boeing 737 air crashes at Pittsburgh and Colorado\n\nSprings had been faced by the pilots of Flight MI 185, the aircraft was at a sufficiently\n\nhigh altitude for it to be steadied and recovered. However, Professor Howe said that the\n\ncrash of Flight MI 185 might have been due to another type of rudder problem altogether.\n\nWhen cross-examined, he said as follows:I’m just reserving the position… – that there might have\n\n  been some other rudder failure which is not yet been revealed and may, hopefully never be\n\n  revealed because maybe it wasn’t there, but we might have the sad situation where in\n\n  the future another 737-300 disappears from cruise conditions under mysterious\n\n  circumstances and maybe investigations would reveal, as it did at Pittsburg, that there\n\n  was a problem.(V/N p 1254)91.    As for the other suggested possible cause of the\n\ncrash, namely rapid depressurisation, Professor Howe conceded that it was very unlikely\n\nthat there was a complete cabin depressurisation. However, he added that a false warning\n\nof cabin depressurisation could not be ruled out. This was endorsed by Captain Galan, who\n\ntestified that of the range of possible causes of the crash, this cause would be most\n\nlikely while the pilot’s suicide would lie at the opposite end of the range.92.    The possibility of an emergency descent as a\n\nresult of rapid cabin depressurisation was considered by the NTSC. It noted that the last\n\npilot radio transmission about two and a half minutes before the final descent of the\n\naircraft was normal and there was no mention of any in-flight fire or smoke. Furthermore,\n\nthe wreckage revealed no evidence of in-flight fire or explosion and it was ascertained\n\nthat the recovered oxygen generators had not been activated. Based on these findings, the\n\nNTSC concluded that there was no indication of an emergency descent due to fire, smoke or\n\nrapid depressurisation. Both Professor Howe and Captain Galan pointed out that not all the\n\noxygen generators were recovered. Professor Howe said that it was possible that there was\n\nno time or reason for those generators which were found to be activated. As such, he\n\nstressed that it was wrong to rule out depressurisation or a false alarm of\n\ndepressurisation as a reason for the emergency descent which finally caused the aircraft\n\nto crash.93.    The evidence adduced does not justify a\n\nconclusion that mechanical failure or rapid depressurisation caused the crash of Flight MI\n\n185. All the same, the discussion of other possible causes of the crash of the aircraft\n\nwas useful, if only because it showed how difficult it is to discharge the onus of proving\n\nthe cause of the crash.E. HUMAN FACTORS AND SUICIDE94.    The human factors relevant to the crash of Flight\n\nMI 185 will next be considered. That an investigation into the cause of the crash of\n\nFlight MI 185 must take into account human factors with respect to the persons piloting\n\nthe aircraft is evident. When cross-examined, the plaintiffs’ expert witness, Mr Job,\n\nsaid as follows:Q.    Mr Job, would you agree that in any investigation of air crashes\n\n  that the human factor element would be an important part of that investigation?A. Certainly.(V/N p 737)95.    Captain Galan, who agreed that human factors must\n\nbe looked at when investigating the cause of the crash, explained:I [have been] working [on] human factors [for] a long time, and we\n\n  learn from the human factors that an accident does not start … at the exact time\n\n  where the first technical or visible operation is done. An accident starts a long time\n\n  before [that] very often. And we have to consider the behaviour of the crew before as\n\n  facts … [to be considered as] evidence. So the accident for me does not start when\n\n  somebody pull[s], push[es] on the stick or something like that but a [long] time\n\n  before…. [S]o human factors explain that the accident is not confined in this case\n\n  [to] something like two minutes.(V/N pp 1072-1073)96.    In the present case, the human factors relevant\n\nto whether or not the pilots had any intention to kill themselves and all other persons on\n\nboard the aircraft merit particular attention even though Mr Khoo SC reiterated on\n\nnumerous occasions that the plaintiffs did not allege that either pilot wanted to commit\n\nsuicide. He said that the motive for the intentional inputs to crash the aircraft was\n\nirrelevant. However, an assertion that there was intentional tampering with the controls\n\nof an aircraft to cause it to crash, if proven, leads to the conclusion that Captain Tsu\n\nand/or F/O Ward intended not only to crash the aircraft but also to commit suicide and\n\nkill 97 passengers and all the other crew members. When questioned by Mr Khoo SC, Captain\n\nGalan rightly said as follows:Q. Captain Galan, the fact remains, does it not, that the question of\n\n  suicide must be separated from the manoeuvre itself?A. …. I’m sorry. For me, somebody who pushed the plane down\n\n  to the ground is [committing] suicide.(V/N p 1129)97.    The plaintiffs’ expert witnesses conceded\n\nthat a person responsible for inputs such as those allegedly made in the cockpit of Flight\n\nMI 185 would know that he was going to kill himself. In reply to my questions, Captain\n\nLaming said as follows:Ct. What is the inevitable consequence of someone in the cockpit\n\n  continually pressing the button for eight seconds?A. If he presses the button by himself and does nothing in terms of the\n\n  main control column, the aircraft will go into a dive. It probably would not\n\n  recover….Ct. Would a Boeing 737 pilot know that what he was doing would lead to\n\n  a point where extreme aerodynamic forces would prevent recovery?A. Most certainly.Ct.In other words, he would know that if he pressed [the button]\n\n  and did nothing else, he was going to kill himself.A.Yes.(V/N pp 296-298; emphasis added)98.    Despite strenuous efforts to distance himself\n\nfrom the allegation of suicide, Mr Job finally conceded that the plaintiffs were in fact\n\nsaying that the person who controlled the aircraft at the material time intended to kill\n\nhimself. When questioned by me, he said as follows:Ct. … [I]n your view, MI 185 came down because the person who\n\n  manipulated the controls wanted to commit suicide and sadly, in the process, he became a\n\n  mass murderer….A. Yes, I agree with that.(V/N p 784)99.    The thrust of the plaintiffs’ case is that\n\nit is more likely than not that it was Captain Tsu who deliberately crashed the aircraft.\n\nAll the same, as the plaintiffs also asserted that F/O Ward could have been responsible\n\nfor the inputs in the cockpit which caused the crash, the human factors relevant to both\n\nF/O Ward and Captain Tsu will be considered.100.    Mr Lok referred to the exhaustive investigation\n\nby Singapore’s CID in its attempt \"to trace any indication of possible suicidal\n\nintent on the part of the pilot, co-pilot or the crew\". More than 160 people in five\n\ncountries were interviewed by the CID, which concluded that after a careful examination\n\nand analysis of all the materials obtained, it found no evidence that the pilot, co-pilot\n\nor any crew member had suicidal tendencies or a motive to deliberately cause the crash of\n\nFlight MI 185.101.    Mr Khoo SC pointed out that as he had no\n\nopportunity to cross-examine the CID’s witness, the findings of the CID should not be\n\nrelied on by SilkAir. There are sufficient findings by the NTSC on human factors and only\n\nthese findings will be relied on in this judgment.F/O Ward102.    The human factors relating to First Officer Ward\n\nwill first be considered. F/O Ward, who studied aviation at Massey University, New\n\nZealand, joined SilkAir in September 1996, after having worked as a First Officer with\n\nIndonesia’s Garuda Airways. During his re-training to fly the Boeing-737, he was\n\nrated as \"above average\". No problems were noted during his training or during\n\nsubsequent base checks in March and September 1997. According to para 1.18.4.1 of the\n\nNTSC’s Final Report, other SilkAir pilots described him as an above average pilot\n\nwith very good handling skills. Para 2.14.2 of the NTSC’s Final Report added as\n\nfollows:The investigation into … [F/O Ward’s] personal and\n\n  professional history revealed no unusual issues. No records of incidents or unusual events\n\n  were found, and no career setbacks or difficulties were experienced. Financial records\n\n  showed no evidence of financial problems. Interviews with family, close friends and\n\n  relations seem to indicate that the [First Officer] was a well-balanced and well-adjusted\n\n  person, and keen on his job, and planning to advance his flying career. There were no\n\n  reports on recent changes in his behaviour.103.    First Officer Lawrence Dittmer (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as F/O Dittmer), a colleague of F/O Ward and Captain Tsu, testified that F/O\n\nWard was a gentleman. When questioned by Mr Khoo SC about F/O Ward’s character, he\n\nsaid as follows:Probably, the most honest person I’ve ever met. Initially, you\n\n  would perhaps perceive him as being quite shy…. but once you did get to know him\n\n  you’ll soon realise that he had some fine attributes, namely his honesty, his belief\n\n  and loving life, …. I think, you just got the feeling that he was a great guy to\n\n  know. He’s very friendly with everybody; you knew that he had no grudges against\n\n  anybody. I think you could just safely say that he was an all-round gentleman.(V/N p 130)104.    As for F/O Ward’s financial position, the\n\nNTSC noted that while he owed his parents an amount of money for initial flight training\n\nexpenses, this debt was less than his savings and there were no reports of other debts.\n\nThere was nothing suspicious about his two insurance policies. One was purchased in 1992\n\nwhile the other was a standard SilkAir policy.105.    In short, there is no evidence whatsoever that F/O Ward\n\nintended to commit suicide and kill every person on board the aircraft.Captain Tsu106.    Captain Tsu, a former captain in the Republic of\n\nSingapore Air Force (hereinafter referred to as \"RSAF\"), joined the RSAF in\n\n1975. He flew many types of fighter and trainer aircraft and was a member of the\n\nRSAF’s Black Knights aerobatic team. He left the RSAF to join SilkAir in 1992. He was\n\nappointed Captain in 1996.107.    Captain Tsu was a family man. The NTSC noted\n\nthat he left the RSAF and joined SilkAir in 1992 in order to spend more time with his\n\nfamily. His co-pilot on a number of occasions, F/O Dittmer, who gave evidence of his\n\nalleged breach of safety regulations, agreed that he was a family man. When questioned by\n\nMr Khoo SC, he said as follows:Q. Can you tell us something of your appreciation of Captain Tsu’s\n\n  basic character …?A. ….We discussed a lot of things together involving his family\n\n  background, his life, his children. Basically, the opinion I got was that he was a family\n\n  man, and I like that. I was planning to have children in the future …. So he was a\n\n  nice guy to talk to.(V/N pp 131-132)108.    The plaintiffs asserted that Captain Tsu’s\n\nprevious breaches of safety regulations must be taken into account when determining\n\nwhether or not the aircraft was intentionally crashed. They also asserted that in the\n\nlight of Captain Tsu’s breaches of safety regulations, SilkAir should not have put\n\nhim in charge of any flight. Although the allegations of impropriety, when closely\n\nscrutinised, are not really relevant to the issue at hand, they will be discussed for the\n\nsake of completeness.109.    At this juncture, the following elucidation of\n\nSilkAir’s levels of disciplinary action by SilkAir’s Chief Pilot, Captain Leslie\n\nJohn Ganapathy, in para 30 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief ought to be noted:There are various levels of disciplinary action which can be taken\n\n  against the pilots. The most serious is termination of their employment. This is followed\n\n  by a demotion in rank. The pilot can also be removed from his position of Instructor Pilot\n\n  or Line Instructor Pilot. This is known as a de-appointment. The next less severe penalty\n\n  is a severe reprimand, followed by a reprimand. If the Company feels that the act does not\n\n  warrant a reprimand, they will give a letter cautioning the pilot. In very minor cases, we\n\n  would just issue the pilots a ‘please be more mindful’ letter. This is basically\n\n  a reminder letter just to make them aware that they should be more careful in the future.\n\n  Letters of caution and reminders usually do not have a long term impact on promotions or\n\n  increments. It is also our practice in cases where it is felt that pilots do require some\n\n  guidance in procedural or operational matters for them to receive counselling from the\n\n  Management.110.    Captain Tsu was involved in the following\n\nincidents, which merited the attention of SilkAir:(a) An incident regarding the landing of an aircraft at Manado on 3\n\n  March 1997 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Manado incident\").(b) An incident involving the disconnection of a CVR at Changi Airport\n\n  on 24 June 1997 (hereinafter referred to as the \"CVR incident\").(c) An incident involving a return to Changi Airport after having taken\n\n  off for Kunming on 20 November 1997 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Kunming flight\n\n  incident\").The Manado incident111.    On 3 March 1997, Captain Tsu was the commander\n\nof Flight MI 274, which left Singapore for Manado. As the aircraft approached Manado, it\n\nwas positioned too high and was moving too fast to be able to land at the airport. In such\n\ncircumstances, Captain Tsu should have proceeded on a \"go-around\" before\n\nattempting to land. His co-pilot on this flight, F/O Dittmer, testified that instead of\n\ntaking this course of action, Captain Tsu took the aircraft on \"S turns\" in an\n\nattempt to bring it down to a much lower altitude in order to land. He added that there\n\nwere quick rolls to the left and right and he was scared. Unable to achieve his purpose,\n\nCaptain Tsu then took the aircraft on a \"go-around\" before it landed at Manado\n\nairport. F/O Dittmer said that Captain Tsu had promised to report the\n\n\"go-around\" to SilkAir but did not do so. It is worth noting that no passenger\n\nfiled a complaint about the flight in question and that in his own reports to SilkAir\n\nregarding the incident, F/O Dittmer did not mention that he was frightened by the \"S\n\nturns\".112.    Captain Galan said that an \"S turn\"\n\nmay, depending on the circumstances, be acceptable. When questioned by Mr Lok, he said as\n\nfollows:Q. …. Can you give us your comments on \"S bends\" and\n\n  \"S turns\"?A. …. If these turns are done in good conditions, like turns done\n\n  in a normal flight, there is no matter that it could be a problem except that in certain\n\n  airlines, in certain airports, it could be not useful for the other aircraft and for\n\n  navigation. But if there is no problem for the other aircraft, why not, you increase your\n\n  distance without any problem if you make safe turns.(V/N pp 1033-1034)113.    Captain Galan also thought that F/O\n\nDittmer’s evidence on the \"S turns\" done by Captain Tsu lacked important\n\ndetails. When cross-examined, he said as follows:Mr Dittmer did not describe anything. He made a sign like that. You\n\n  see, … I am … scientific. If you say to me a turn … was at a bend of 25 or\n\n  35 or 60 degrees … at a speed which was so and so and the altitude which was so and\n\n  so, I would say to you if I would do that. But you say to me a manoeuvre that was\n\n  described by Mr Dittmer and you say that if I did not describe something … saying it\n\n  as a strange manoeuvre…. I am sorry that I cannot give you an answer to something\n\n  which is so inadequate.(V/N pp 1157-1158)114.    In para 17 of his affidavit of\n\nevidence-in-chief, SilkAir’s Deputy Chief Pilot, Captain Anthony Leong, said that he\n\nand Captain Ganapathy interviewed Captain Tsu and F/O Dittmer and made the following\n\nfindings:Captain Tsu did not take measures early enough to prevent the aircraft from ending up in\n\n    a position on finals from which a normal landing could not be made. This resulted in a\n\n    go-around.Captain Tsu by not reporting the go-around in the voyage report or to Flight Operations\n\n    department acted inappropriately. This resulted in the subsequent erasure of data that\n\n    could have been used for an investigation.First Officer Dittmer by not reporting the go-around in the voyage report or otherwise\n\n    to Flight Operations department also acted inappropriately.115.    As a result of the Manado incident, the Flight\n\nOperations Management recommended that Captain Tsu be given a letter of caution for\n\nfailing to maintain a proper profile on the final approach to the airport and for not\n\nreporting the \"go-around\", which was an unusual occurrence. As for F/O Dittmer,\n\nit was recommended that he be counselled on the implications of not reporting to SilkAir\n\nmatters that should have been reported. Before the letter of caution was issued to Captain\n\nTsu, the cockpit voice recorder incident, which is discussed below, occurred.",
        "The CVR incident": "116.    On 24 June 1997, Captain Tsu and F/O Dittmer\n\ndiscussed the Manado incident while they were in the cockpit of a SilkAir aircraft that\n\nwas about to take off on a flight from Singapore for Jakarta. Captain Tsu told F/O Dittmer\n\nthat he was upset by what he had heard from other crew members about the Manado incident.\n\nAs a result of something which F/O Dittmer said, Captain Tsu pulled out the CVR’s\n\ncircuit breaker in order to preserve the recording of the conversation. As F/O Dittmer\n\nmade it clear that he was not prepared to fly without the CVR in operation, Captain Tsu,\n\nwho wanted to have the CVR tape downloaded, requested for and was given clearance to move\n\nthe aircraft back to the gate. Subsequently, he changed his mind and reset the CVR. After\n\nthat, the aircraft took off and proceeded to Jakarta without any further incident. In para\n\n27 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Captain Leong said that he compiled a report of\n\nthe incident after consulting Captain Ganapathy. It contained the following findings:Captain Tsu acted inappropriately by de-activating the CVR before flight.Captain Tsu’s actions compromised the proper operations of the airline and served\n\n    to intimidate F/O Dittmer who would have subsequently been unable to operate the flight in\n\n    a settled state of mind.Captain Tsu’s [intention] to return to the gate to download the voice recorder tape\n\n    at the expense of and inconvenience to the passengers [and] delays to schedules …\n\n    [was] definitely not in the interest of the Company ….Captain Tsu’s assertion that he had F/O’s agreement to proceed without the CVR\n\n    operating was denied by F/O Dittmer.117.    Captain Leong said that although the flight\n\ncould have been performed without a serviceable CVR, the Flight Operations Department took\n\na serious view of the incident and recommended that Captain Tsu be removed from his Line\n\nInstructor Pilot status with immediate effect.118.    On 3 July 1997, Captain Leong wrote to Captain\n\nTsu to caution him with respect to his failure to act appropriately in the Manado\n\nincident. Captain Tsu was also informed that as a result of the CVR incident, he was\n\nreprimanded and removed from his position as Line Instructor Pilot with immediate effect.\n\nCaptain Tsu was dissatisfied with the decisions. As a result, an inquiry was held, at\n\nwhich three charges in relation to the Manado incident and the CVR incident were made\n\nagainst him. In para 31 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Captain Leong said as\n\nfollows:The Defendants wrote to Captain Tsu on 15 July 1997, informing him that\n\n  disciplinary proceedings at Company level would be instituted against him for three\n\n  charges, namely:On 3 March 1997, while operating flight MI274, he did fail to take appropriate measures\n\n    early enough to prevent the aircraft from ending up in a position on finals too high for a\n\n    normal landing thereby resulting in a go-around;Subsequent to the go-around incident involving flight MI274 on 3 March 1997, he did fail\n\n    to report or otherwise disclose to the company the said incident, an unusual occurrence\n\n    which, in the company’s interests, should have been reported and documented; andOn 24 June 1997, while operating a public transport flight MI186, he did behave in a\n\n    manner unbecoming of a Commander and contrary to the company’s interests by\n\n    deliberately rendering unserviceable equipment essential for the proper conduct of the\n\n    said flight.119.    On 28 July 1997, the Inquiry Panel found that\n\nwhile the first charge was not proven, the remaining two charges were proven. As such,\n\nCaptain Tsu was reprimanded for his actions and removed from the position of Line\n\nInstructor Pilot with effect from 28 July 1997.",
        "The Kunming flight incident": "120.    On 20 November 1997, Captain Tsu was the\n\ncommander of Flight MI 916, which was scheduled to fly from Singapore to Kunming. On\n\ntake-off, one of the aircraft’s engines did not achieve the target thrust. Shortly\n\nafter taking off, Captain Tsu had second thoughts about proceeding to Kunming. After\n\ndiscussions with an engineering officer, a joint decision was made for the aircraft to\n\nreturn to Singapore. The aircraft, a Boeing 737, which had just taken off, did not have a\n\nfuel dumping capability. As such, it exceeded the maximum landing weight when it returned\n\nto Changi Airport. Such an overweight landing should have been recorded in the Technical\n\nLog and Incident Report Form. However, Captain Tsu did not do so. For this infringement,\n\nboth he and his co-pilot received a \"be more mindful\" letter from SilkAir.121.    In relation to the overweight landing incident,\n\nthe plaintiffs made two points. First, they asserted that Captain Tsu acted recklessly\n\nwhen he took off from Changi Airport without sufficient thrust. Secondly, they said that\n\nCaptain Tsu’s failure to report the overweight landing was a serious breach of safety\n\nregulations.122.    While Captain Baston thought that Captain Tsu\n\nhad taken off from Changi Airport with insufficient thrust in one of the aircraft’s\n\nengines, Captain Galan took a totally different view. When cross-examined, he said as\n\nfollows:Q. In this case, we knew that even after fire-walling the engine,\n\n  pushing the thrust completely forward, it was still below its take-off thrust?A. It was still below the maximum take-off thrust but above the\n\n  possible take-off thrust….(V/N p 1159)Q. Don’t you think something should have been done to remedy this\n\n  problem towards the insufficient thrust?A. …. You know that I call insufficient thrust a thrust which is\n\n  insufficient. In this case, the thrust was sufficient because it was over the minimum\n\n  thrust acceptable for its take-off. So the thrust was sufficient.(V/N p 1162)123.    SilkAir’s Chief Pilot, Captain Ganapathy,\n\nagreed with Captain Galan. When cross-examined by Mr Khoo SC, he said as follows:.Q. [C]aptain Baston … felt that the take-off which preceded the\n\n  overweight landing incident was operationally flawed. Do you have any comments on that?A. No, I don’t agree with that at all. The power that was\n\n  available on the engine that had the power shortfall that day was well above what was\n\n  required as the minimum take-off thrust for the flight…. And the aircraft was in no\n\n  way, I would say, at risk. It was well within its capabilities of taking off and climbing\n\n  out satisfactorily.(V/N p 1499)124.    SilkAir’s Deputy Chief Pilot, Captain\n\nLeong, also agreed that Captain Tsu did not take off from Changi Airport for Kunming with\n\ninsufficient thrust in one of the aircraft’s engines.125.    As for failing to report the overweight landing,\n\nCaptain Tsu said that he did not file a report as he thought that the landing had been\n\nsmooth. Captain Leong testified that in his view, this incident did not involve a breach\n\nof safety procedures. However, Captain Baston thought that Captain Tsu’s failure to\n\nreport the overweight landing should not be viewed as an administrative oversight and that\n\na smooth landing is not the criteria for determining whether or not such a report should\n\nbe lodged. He said that such a report is required so that an airworthiness inspection can\n\nbe conducted.",
        "Effect of disciplinary action on Captain Tsu": "126.    The effect of the disciplinary action taken by\n\nSilkAir in 1997 on Captain Tsu’s morale ought to be considered. The NTSC took note of\n\nCaptain Tsu’s employment record and said in para 2.14.3 of its Final Report as\n\nfollows:During his professional career at SilkAir, he was involved in a few\n\n  work-related events, which were in general considered minor operational incidents by the\n\n  management. However, in one particular event, for non-technical reasons, [Captain Tsu]\n\n  infringed a standard operating procedure i.e. with the intention to preserve a\n\n  conversation between [him] and his co-pilot, [he] pulled out the CVR circuit breaker, but\n\n  [he] reset the circuit breaker in its original position before the flight. This was\n\n  considered a serious incident by the management, and [he] was relieved of his LIP\n\n  appointment. [He] was known to have tried through existing company procedures to reverse\n\n  the management decision. Although there were some indications of [Captain Tsu] being upset\n\n  by the outcome of the events, the magnitude of the psychological impact on [his]\n\n  performance could not be determined.127.    Captain Galan thought that Captain Tsu’s\n\nrecord should not have caused him much concern. He said as follows in para 11(b)(iii) of\n\nhis affidavit of evidence-in-chief:The only recorded work problems that concerned [Captain Tsu] were,\n\n  based on my experience as a commercial pilot, minor disciplinary mistakes that should not\n\n  have affected him much. Certainly, they do not appear serious enough for a man to\n\n  contemplate suicide.128.    Captain Galan said that those who worked with\n\nCaptain Tsu would have known if he was depressed. In para 11(b)(iv) of his affidavit of\n\nevidence-in-chief, he explained:My personal experience with airline pilots is that a pilot’s\n\n  nature of work brings him in such close contact with his fellow crew members that, if a\n\n  pilot had been under any particular stress or was depressed, it would be impossible that\n\n  this would go unnoticed.129.    Captain Tsu’s recent behaviour was\n\nconsidered by the NTSC, which stated as follows in para 2.14.3.1 of its Final Report:[Captain Tsu’s] recent behaviour was analysed from statements made\n\n  by family members, friends and peers during interviews. [His] family reported no recent\n\n  changes in his behaviour. Work associates who observed [him] on the day of the accident\n\n  and on his most recent flights, reported nothing odd or unusual in his behaviour.130.    Captain Ganapathy testified that his working\n\nrelationship with Captain Tsu remained cordial even after the latter was no longer a Line\n\nInstructor Pilot. He added that after the loss of that position, Captain Tsu had friendly\n\nchats with him during departmental meetings and social events. Referring to a meeting\n\nwhich he had with Captain Tsu a week before the crash, he said at paras 44 and 45 of his\n\naffidavit of evidence-in-chief as follows:44. …. On or about 11 December 1997, Captain Tsu paid me a visit\n\n  at my office as he wanted to discuss the letter sent to him on the overweight landing.45. He firstly admitted that it had been an oversight on his part in\n\n  failing to report the overweight landing…. The meeting ended on a positive note and I\n\n  believe that Captain Tsu was grateful to be given the opportunity to explain the incident\n\n  and to receive from me the reassurance as stated above.131.    In its thorough study of the human factors\n\nrelating to Captain Tsu, the NTSC considered his financial position at length. It found\n\nthat Captain Tsu’s had a \"positive net worth\" at the time of the accident.\n\nIn para 2.14.3 of its Final Report, the NTSC stated as follows:In the independent review of the NTSC’s findings concerning\n\n  financial background of [Captain Tsu] by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, the available\n\n  information in regard to the assets, liabilities, income, expenditure and share trading\n\n  were incorporated into a net worth analysis. This analysis reveals the following:[His] net worth (known assets less known liabilities) deteriorated over the period of\n\n    1994 to 1996, however it grew marginally during 1997.Between 31 December 1994 and 31 December 1996 his known assets declined, while his known\n\n    liabilities increased resulting in a net decline in the value of [his] known net worth.Between 31 December 1996 and 19 December 1997, [his] known net worth increased again.Analysis of the net monthly income available for discretionary and\n\n  general out-of-pocket expenses, based on a monthly combined gross income (including [his]\n\n  and his wife’s salaries), indicated that [he] had a relatively minor monthly cash\n\n  shortfall at around the time of the accident. This should be considered in [the] light of\n\n  [his] positive net worth at the time of the accident.132.    Captain Tsu’s liabilities, and especially\n\nhis losses on shares, must thus be viewed in the context of his positive net worth at the\n\ntime of his death. As for his insurance policies, one included a mortgage insurance policy\n\nwhich was applied for in December 1997. This is not an unusual policy and Captain Tsu did\n\nnot know at the time of his death that his application for the mortgage insurance policy\n\nhad been approved. As for his other insurance policies, they were effected many years ago\n\nand not under suspicious circumstances.NTSC’s findings on human factors are helpful133.    The findings of the NTSC on human factors are\n\ncertainly helpful. As such, they will be considered together with the evidence from the\n\ncrash site and simulation tests in the next part of this judgment in relation to whether\n\nor not the plaintiffs’ contention that Flight MI 185 was intentionally crashed is\n\njustified.F. MY FINDINGS ON WHETHER THE AIRCRAFT WAS INTENTIONALLY CRASHED134.    The plaintiffs’ task of proving that Flight\n\nMI 185 was intentionally crashed is not an easy one in view of the paucity of evidence and\n\nthe fact that their case rested on circumstantial evidence. As for the plaintiffs’\n\nassertion that the irresistible inference is that the aircraft was intentionally crashed,\n\nit should be borne in mind that inCaswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd[1940] AC 152, 169-170, where the precise nature in which an accident occurred could not be\n\nascertained, Lord Wright said as follows:Inference must be carefully distinguished from conjecture or\n\n  speculation. There can be no inference unless there are objective facts from which to\n\n  infer the other facts which it is sought to establish. In some cases the other facts can\n\n  be inferred with as much practical certainty as if they had been actually observed. In\n\n  other cases the inference does not go beyond reasonable probability. But if there are no\n\n  positive proved facts from which the inference can be made, the method of inference fails\n\n  and what is left is mere speculation or conjecture.135.    Lord Wright’s approach was endorsed by the\n\nCourt of Appeal inSingapore Airlines Ltd v Fujitsu Microelectronics (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd[2001] 1 SLR 241.136.    The expert witnesses were sharply divided over\n\nthe cause of the accident and the veracity of some of the conclusions of the NTSC and the\n\nNTSB. In the face of the dissenting views of the experts, many of the arguments advanced\n\nby Professor Howe and Captain Galan are not unpersuasive.137.    To begin with, for reasons already stated, there\n\nis enough room to question the accuracy of the projected flight trajectory of the\n\naircraft’s final descent and the corrected radar data on which the flight trajectory\n\nwas based. Both Mr Job and Captain Baston accepted that with no other available data on\n\nthe aircraft’s descent into the Musi River, the accuracy of the radar data relied on\n\nto reconstruct the flight path of the aircraft’s final descent had to be accurate.\n\nDuring the trial, no one seriously challenged Professor Howe’s assertion that the\n\nprojected flight trajectory of the aircraft’s final descent and the corrected radar\n\npoints, if accurate, required the aircraft to achieve Mach numbers which are outside\n\nanything that any of the witnesses said could be achieved by it. Only Captain Baston dealt\n\nwith this issue when he offered the view that wind flowing on parts of the aircraft could\n\nreach a speed of Mach 1 or more but this did not affect Professor Howe’s assertion,\n\nwhich is that while the local airspeed over parts of the aerofoil section could reach Mach\n\n1, the speed of the aircraft would not exceed Mach 1. (V/N p 1332)138.    As has been mentioned, the reliability of the\n\ncorrected radar data is being questioned by counsel for some of the plaintiffs in the\n\npresent case in the actions initiated by them in the United States against Boeing. Captain\n\nBaston was honest enough to accept that his conclusions on the cause of the crash of\n\nFlight MI 185, which were based on the flight trajectory of the aircraft and the\n\nsimulation tests, could, depending on the margin of error of the corrected radar data,\n\nchange. When cross-examined, he said as follows:Q.    In other words, if the radar data is shown to have been changed or\n\n  amended in any way which subsequently is found to be incorrect, then there would have to\n\n  be changes to the basis or the outcome of your opinion?A. Yes.(V/N p 479)139.    When questioned by me, Captain Baston confirmed\n\nthat his conclusions are only valid if the corrected radar data relied on by him are\n\ncorrect. (V/N p 543)140.    As for the simulation tests conducted by Boeing,\n\nthe fact that they were based on the controversial corrected radar data ought to be noted.\n\nThis was made clear in the NTSC’s Final Report, which stated that the objective of\n\nthe simulation tests conducted by Boeing was \"to explore and understand the various\n\npossible combination of one or more malfunctions of flight controls, aircraft systems and\n\npower plants that would result in the extreme descent flight trajectory as suggested by\n\nthe radar plots\".Apart from this, the relevance of the simulation tests is\n\ndebatable because such tests are of limited use when, as in this case, the aircraft had\n\nexceeded its flight envelope.141.    There is also sufficient doubt as to what was\n\nthe final position of the jackscrew of the horizontal stabilizer before the aircraft\n\nstarted to disintegrate in mid-air. The NTSC concluded that there is no evidence that\n\nintentional pilot input caused the jackscrew of the horizontal stabilizer to be at its\n\nmaximum forward trim limit. Furthermore, it was not established that the pilots did not\n\nattempt to recover the aircraft from its unusual attitude. The fact that the throttle was\n\nin a forward thrust position does not, without more, prove that that the pilots did not\n\nattempt to recover the aircraft from its dive. It was also not established that the CVR\n\nand FDR were intentionally disconnected.142.    I thus have no doubt that if one looks only at\n\nthe evidence from the crash site, the projected flight trajectory of Flight MI 185’s\n\nfinal descent and the simulation studies, the onus of proving that Flight MI 185 was\n\nintentionally crashed has not been discharged.Human factors143.    In the light of my findings with respect to the\n\nevidence from the crash site, the projected flight trajectory and the simulation tests,\n\nthe human factors relevant to the crash of Flight MI 185 have an added significance and\n\nwill next be considered.144.    When considering whether or not Captain Tsu or\n\nF/O Ward intended to commit suicide and kill the passengers and crew on board the\n\naircraft, it must be borne in mind that a finding that they intended to do so affects\n\ntheir reputation and character. In this regard, the following words of Morris LJ inHornal\n\nv Neuberger Products Ltd[1957] 1 QB 247, 266-267 ought to be noted:Issues may be raised in a civil action which affect character and\n\n  reputation, and these will not be forgotten by judges and juries when considering the\n\n  probabilities in regard to whatever misconduct is alleged. There will be reluctance to rob\n\n  any man of his good name: there will also be reluctance to make any man pay what is not\n\n  due or make any man liable who is not or not liable who is. A court will not be deterred\n\n  from a conclusion because of regret at its consequences: a court must arrive at such\n\n  conclusion as is directed by the weight and preponderance of the evidence.145.    Morris LJ was of course echoing the approach\n\nenunciated inBater v Bater[1951] P 35, 36-37 by Denning LJ, as he then was, who\n\nsaid:It is of course true that by our law a higher standard of proof is\n\n  required in criminal cases than in civil cases. But this is subject to the qualification\n\n  that there is no absolute standard in either case. In criminal cases the charge must be\n\n  proved beyond reasonable doubt, but there may be degrees of proof within that standard.As Best CJ and many other great judges have said, ‘in proportion\n\n  as the crime is enormous, so ought the proof to be clear’. So also in civil cases,\n\n  the case may be proved by a preponderance of probability, but there may be degrees of\n\n  probability within that standard. The degree depends on the subject-matter. A civil court,\n\n  when considering a charge of fraud, will naturally require for itself a higher degree of\n\n  probability than that which it would require when asking if negligence is established. It\n\n  does not adopt so high a degree as a criminal court, even when it is considering a charge\n\n  of a criminal nature; but still it does require a degree of probability which is\n\n  commensurate with the occasion.146.    The evidence on human factors uncovered by the\n\nNTSC provides no basis for concluding that Captain Tsu or F/O Ward intended to commit\n\nsuicide and kill the passengers and crew on board the aircraft. As far as Captain Tsu is\n\nconcerned, it is important to note that on the days before the crash and on the day of the\n\ncrash itself, he showed no signs of a change in behaviour. The recorded conversation in\n\nthe CVR before it was disabled revealed that he and F/O Ward chatted without any hint of\n\ntension or any sign that something ominous was to unfold a few minutes later. The NTSC\n\npointed out that the two hours of CVR information available for analysis revealed cordial\n\ndiscussions between the two pilots which were unrelated to their work.147.    As for Captain Tsu’s financial problems, it\n\nshould not be overlooked that he had, in the NTSC’s words, a positive net worth at\n\nthe time of the accident. Admittedly, he had some problems with his work but these were\n\nnot serious enough to push him to take his own life and the lives of so many other\n\npersons. As for the mysterious failure of the black boxes, the NTSC stated in no uncertain\n\nterms that Captain Tsu’s act of disconnecting the CVR in Changi Airport in June 1997\n\nto preserve his conversation with F/O Dittmer with respect to the Manado incident\n\n\"had no bearing on this accident\".148.    The NTSC also noted that Captain Tsu had forward\n\nplanning and that he was organising his father’s birthday party, which was scheduled\n\nfor 21 December 1997, just two days after the crash. It is unlikely that Captain Tsu, a\n\nfamily man who gave up his career in the RSAF in order to spend more time with his family,\n\nand who was planning his father’s birthday celebrations at the material time, would,\n\nwithout more, deny his wife a husband, his children a much needed father and his aged\n\nfather a son. Furthermore, even if it is assumed for one moment that he wanted to commit\n\nsuicide, it is unlikely that he would choose to distress his aged father by killing\n\nhimself and so many other people just two days before his father’s birthday\n\ncelebrations.149.    The plaintiffs’ case was focussed primarily\n\non the evidence from the crash site, the simulation tests and the disciplinary action\n\ntaken by SilkAir against Captain Tsu. Insufficient attention was paid to human factors\n\nrelevant to the crash. While Captain Laming and Captain Baston understandably concentrated\n\non the technical aspects of the crash because of their expertise, it cannot be fathomed\n\nwhy the plaintiffs’ third witness, Mr Job, an experienced air crash investigator, did\n\nnot cast his eyes further afield. After all, during the trial, he reiterated on several\n\noccasions that attention should be paid to the human factors relevant to the crash of\n\nFlight MI 185. Some of his answers during cross-examination are reproduced below:Q.    Would [the CID report] be relevant to your consideration whether\n\n  or not the CVR and FDR were intentionally disconnected? ….A. Yes, it would be relevant.Q. Would [the CID report] be relevant to your consideration whether the\n\n  cockpit crew set the plane on a nose-down trim?A. Yes, it would be relevant.(V/N p 778)Q. Looking at those [issues regarding other possible reasons for the\n\n  crash] in the light of the CID report, if you were the investigator, would you want to be\n\n  a little bit more careful and look a little bit more closely at those other issues?A. Yes, I would, yes.(V/N p 787)150.    In view of Mr Job’s position, it is\n\nsurprising that he did not give the human factors which were considered at great length in\n\nthe NTSC’s Final Report much attention. After all, he confirmed that whatever had\n\nbeen uncovered by the Singapore police had also been considered by the NTSC. (V/N p 803)\n\nWhen cross-examined, he explained why he did not pay much attention to the NTSC’s\n\nfindings on the issues considered by the Singapore police in the following terms:Q. …. Did you read these portions of the NTSC report?A. I’ve read them.I understood that my brief was to\n\n  concentrate on the operational aspects of the report. I didn’t give them a great deal\n\n  of consideration.(V/N p 803; emphasis added)151.    Mr Job’s admission that his brief was to\n\nconcentrate on the \"operational aspects\" of the report merits attention. What\n\nwould have been his conclusion if his brief had been to concentrate on the human factors\n\nrelevant to the crash of Flight MI 185? If this had been the case, would he have given\n\nscant attention to the evidence from the crash site? As an expert crash investigator, Mr\n\nJob’s role was to look at all the relevant factors and his testimony was undermined\n\nfrom the very start by his failure to give sufficient attention to the human factors which\n\nhe himself thought to be relevant to an investigation into the cause of the crash of\n\nFlight MI 185.152.    Earlier on, I stated that the human factors\n\nrelevant to the crash of Flight MI 185 have an added significance because of my findings\n\nregarding the evidence from the crash site and the simulation tests. The fact that there\n\nis no evidence that Captain Tsu or F/O Ward intended to commit suicide or murder provides\n\nadded reason for concluding that it was not established that Flight MI 185 was\n\nintentionally crashed.153.    In agreeing with the NTSC that there is no\n\nevidence that the crash was intentionally caused by inputs in the cockpit, I have not\n\nadopted the NTSB’s conclusions. The NTSB is very experienced in aircraft accident\n\ninvestigation and its views merit attention. All the same, it is not infallible and it has\n\naltered its conclusions on the cause of some, albeit a limited number, of air crashes in\n\nthe light of subsequent evidence which showed that its original conclusions were wrong.154.    Captain Galan, who said that he had worked very\n\noften with the NTSB’s investigators, noted that he had sharp disagreements with the\n\nNTSB on two previous occasions. He clearly did not agree with the conclusions of the NTSB\n\non the cause of the crash of Flight MI 185.155.    The plaintiffs’ expert witness, Mr Job,\n\nagreed that the NTSB had been wrong in the past. When cross-examined, he said as follows:Q. Do you agree that in UA Flight 811, [the NTSB] attributed the cause\n\n  finally to something which they initially dismissed as having only remote possibility?A. That is correct.Q. And that similarly in the Colorado Springs incident, something which\n\n  was initially dismissed as having only an extremely low likelihood was subsequently found\n\n  to be the probable cause?A. Yes.(V/N p 717)156.    Mr Job also conceded that the NTSB could be\n\nwrong in the present case although he thought this to be unlikely. When cross-examined, he\n\nsaid as follows:Q. …. And you’ll agree that for all the good and best\n\n  intentions of NTSB, they might possibly make mistakes in MI 185 as well?A. As I have said before, anything is possible….Q. Do you agree with me that there is a possibility that somewhere out\n\n  there in the wreckage that has still not been recovered, the answer to what actually\n\n  happened to this crash may be found?A. I can only answer that, again, anything is possible….Q. And if that piece of answer is found, or if there is an improvement\n\n  in technology, or if there is some sort of lesson to be learned from other mishaps, and an\n\n  answer emerges a few years from now, the true cause will then be known?A. It is possible.(V/N p 717)157.    To be fair to the NTSB, its representatives did\n\nnot testify in this case. As such, many of the exacting questions posed by SilkAir’s\n\nexpert witnesses in relation to its findings remained unanswered. On the basis of the\n\nevidence before me, the plaintiffs have clearly not discharged the burden of proving that\n\nthe aircraft was intentionally crashed as a result of inputs in the cockpit by Captain Tsu\n\nand/or F/O Ward.G. WHETHER THE PILOTS WERE RECKLESS158.    Whether or not SilkAir is barred from limiting\n\nits liability in accordance with the provisions of the Warsaw Convention and the amended\n\nConvention on the ground of recklessness on the part of the pilots will next be\n\nconsidered.",
        "Position under the amended Convention": "159.    The position under the amended Convention will\n\nfirst be dealt with. The task which lies ahead of a plaintiff seeking to deny a carrier\n\nthe right to rely on the limitation of liability provisions in the amended Convention was\n\noutlined by Eveleigh LJ inGoldman v Thai Airways International Ltd[1983] 3 All ER\n\n693, 698 in the following terms:I say at once that, reading art 25 as a whole for the moment and not\n\n  pausing to give an isolated meaning to the word ‘recklessly’, the article\n\n  requires the plaintiff to prove the following: (1) that the damage resulted from an act or\n\n  omission; (2) that it was done with intent to cause damage, or (3) that it was done when\n\n  the doer was aware that damage would probably result, but he did so regardless of that\n\n  probability; (4) that the damage complained of is the kind of damage known to be the\n\n  probable result.160.    In similar vein, inSS Pharmaceutical Co Ltd\n\nv Qantas Airways Ltd[1991] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 288,302, Kirby P said as\n\nfollows:Even proof of reckless conduct is itself, and alone, not enough. It\n\n  must be shown that, at the time of the reckless conduct, the servants or agents of the\n\n  carrier concerned knew that such conduct would cause damage but went ahead regardless.161.    In Singapore, the approach adopted inGoldman\n\nv Thai Airways International LtdandSS Pharmaceutical Co Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltdwas\n\nendorsed by the Court of Appeal inSingapore Airlines Ltd v Fujitsu Microelectronics\n\n(Malaysia) Sdn Bhd[2001] 1 SLR 241. Chao Hick Tin JA, who delivered the judgment of\n\nthe court, said at p 251:In our opinion, it is clear that the knowledge which must be proved is\n\n  the actual knowledge of the wrongdoer, be it an individual or a group of individuals in a\n\n  company. The fact that the amended Convention requires proof of recklessness as well as\n\n  knowledge that damage would probably result, unmistakably indicates that recklessness per\n\n  se is not sufficient.162.    The question of recklessness on the part of the\n\npilots would arise if they took the aircraft for a dangerous joy ride or if they did what\n\nCaptain Flaming described as \"playing silly\" in the sky. There is no proof that\n\nCaptain Tsu or F/O Ward did these acts. Whatever inappropriate act Captain Tsu may have\n\ndone in the sky in the past, he was, in the main, responding to a situation which required\n\nan input from him. He has never been accused of taking passengers on board an aircraft for\n\na joyride or on a frolic of his own.163.    The remaining question is whether or not Captain\n\nTsu and/or First Officer Ward acted recklessly when dealing with an unexpected situation\n\nor what they perceived to have been a problem faced by the aircraft. Mr Khoo SC, who\n\nmaintained that an emergency descent is easy to execute, asserted that unless the pilots\n\nwere incompetent or reckless, they could never have got out of the flight envelope. He\n\nsubmitted that competent pilots such as Captain Tsu and F/O Ward should have executed an\n\nemergency descent without difficulty unless they took reckless steps, which caused the\n\nplane to exceed its flight envelope and crash. However, Captain Galan stressed that there\n\nwas no question of recklessness in this case. When cross-examined, he said as follows:Q. [T]he other possibility of how the aircraft got into problems at\n\n  exceeding the flight envelope is that he did it the wrong way.A. He did the wrong way… because the conditions were [such] that\n\n  he could not do something else maybe….Q. Reckless? ….A. Not for me. No, no. No possibility of recklessness in this case.(V/N pp 1130, 1132)164.    Professor Howe also said that the question of\n\nrecklessness on the part of the pilots did not arise. When cross-examined, he said as\n\nfollows:Q. You see, if either the pilots had acted on instinct rather than act\n\n  only after assessment of a situation, then they would have been wrong in executing the\n\n  high-dive manoeuvre?A. They would have been wrong, but not reckless.Q. And I have to suggest to you, Professor Howe, that if they did\n\n  something which was contrary to what they had been trained to do, that would be\n\n  recklessness.A. No, definitely not. Recklessness would only be if they were aware of\n\n  the fact that they were doing something which was wrong and would put the aircraft and its\n\n  occupants into danger.(V/N p 1266)165.    Subsequently, Mr Khoo SC returned to the same\n\nsubject but Professor Howe, who steadfastly refused to concede that the pilots had been\n\nreckless, said as follows:Q.    I would suggest to you … there would not have been this\n\n  disastrous result unless someone had done it all wrong.A.    Not at all. I would not accept that because we do not know the\n\n  circumstances in the cabin of the aircraft, in the cockpit of the aircraft on the\n\n  occasion…. And I think to say at this stage that the pilots or pilot initiated an\n\n  emergency descent and got it all wrong is really a gross assumption which cannot be\n\n  justified by the evidence.(V/N pp 1316-1317)166.    SilkAir’s chief pilot, Captain Ganapathy,\n\nwho knew Captain Tsu quite well, also did not think that the latter would have been as\n\nreckless as alleged. When questioned by Mr Lok, he said:Q. Well, it was one of the plaintiffs’ suggestions in this case\n\n  that Captain Tsu was reckless in his operation of the plane and that somehow this might\n\n  have led to the plane crash on the 19thof December, and what are your views on\n\n  this?A. I could not believe that that would be true. I knew him well and I\n\n  cannot believe that he would have done something reckless.(V/N p 1575)167.    When considering whether or not there was\n\nrecklessness on the part of either Captain Tsu or F/O Ward, it should not be overlooked\n\nthat the time within which a pilot responds to a real emergency may not be that taken\n\nduring exercises in a simulator. Even Captain Laming, who said that an emergency descent\n\nis not difficult to execute, agreed that responding to an emergency in a simulator is\n\nquite different from dealing with a real emergency while the aircraft is in the air. When\n\ncross-examined, he said:Q. Would you be able to replicate in a simulator the psychological\n\n  pressure that a pilot may face in a real life depressurisation situation that the aircraft\n\n  might crash or there might be a loss of lives if the situation is not rectified or would\n\n  you consider that an irrelevant consideration?A. I think it’s a difficult question to answer correctly. What I\n\n  am saying is that in the simulator, there is a lot of --- there’s a tense atmosphere.\n\n  There’s a tense atmosphere because usually if you are training, that’s fine. If\n\n  you are under test, there is very tense atmosphere indeed or there can be. In terms of say\n\n  how you are going to die, if you can have this dive, you know from prior knowledge,\n\n  reading, the experience, that they may not recover from a certain angle but the simulator\n\n  has limitations too. It’s not a very good reply to you but I’m trying.Q. Yes. The only thing I wanted to know is that do you consider that to\n\n  be another difference between a real life emergency situation and a ... situation in a\n\n  simulator?A. Yes, there is a difference.Q. So in addition to the physical changes, the physical differences in\n\n  a real life depressurisation, there is also the psychological stresses which are present\n\n  in a real life situation.A. There would be.(V/N pp 313-314)168.    Captain Galan agreed that Captain Tsu and F/O\n\nWard had been trained for an emergency descent but pointed out that while executing such a\n\ndescent may appear easy from a text book, the position is quite different when a pilot is\n\nfaced with a real threat to the aircraft and its passengers. When cross-examined, he said\n\nas follows:Q. [An] emergency descent was a simple manoeuvre to execute. What are\n\n  your comments on that?A. I don’t agree at all …. Emergency descent is, in fact,\n\n  something which is very, very difficult. We had at the very beginning of the seventies to\n\n  make an evaluation of the different tasks of the pilot in the commercial aircraft .…\n\n  All the tasks from take off to landing, all the tasks in normal and abnormal conditions.\n\n  So we did this job during months and months with a subjective means, that means, we used\n\n  pilots and we asked them how difficult was this task … but we also used the objective\n\n  means in using devices coming from doctors. We used the measurement of the breathing,\n\n  measurement of blood pressure, measurement of the electro-cardiogram and after some\n\n  months, we … took different pilots from different airlines in simulators…. We\n\n  have to recognise that the emergency descent was one of the highest workload that we could\n\n  meet in cases of problem in flight.(V/N pp 1024-1025)169.    Captain Galan added that the fact that there\n\nwere two pilots in the cockpit does not mean that an emergency descent would have been an\n\neasy manoeuvre. When cross-examined, he said as follows:Q. If there were two pilots, there shouldn’t be difficulty in\n\n  managing … a high dive, as you say, as opposed to one pilot?A. … [I]f there are two pilots, it’s a heavy difficulty. With\n\n  one pilot around, it’s an extreme difficulty but with two pilots, it is very\n\n  difficult anyway.(V/N p 1105)170.    Captain Baston also accepted that a pilot’s\n\nresponse to a real emergency may be different from his response during an exercise. When\n\nexplaining the element of surprise and why a co-pilot may not have sufficient time to\n\nnegate the effects of an errant pilot’s deliberate manoeuvres to crash a plane, he\n\nsaid as follows:But I am talking about … reaction times. We have quick donning\n\n  oxygen masks. We can just grab the mask, put it on. Now, in a simulated exercise, most\n\n  people can get those masks on fairly quickly, or when you are sitting there checking them\n\n  prior to flight. The FAA and the NTSB did a joint exercise back in the .. early 1980s,\n\n  where they got normal line crew in a simulator, did not brief them, and where everybody\n\n  was thinking that they have had them on in two to five seconds, the average time for an\n\n  average pilot [in] a surprise event was 17 seconds just to get the oxygen mask off and put\n\n  it on and start breathing oxygen, so that it’s very difficult to make objective\n\n  assessments of reaction time in a courtroom without doing a full study in the aircraft.(V/N p 903)171.    After taking all circumstances into account, I\n\nhold that it has not been established that Captain Tsu or F/O Ward acted in such a manner\n\nas to deprive SilkAir of its right to limit its liability in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of the amended Convention.",
        "Position under the Warsaw Convention": "172.    I now turn to the position under the unamended\n\nWarsaw Convention, which requires the plaintiffs to establish that the damage in question\n\nwas caused by the wilful misconduct of either Captain Tsu or F/O Ward if SilkAir is to be\n\nbarred from limiting its liability.173.    InHorabin v British Overseas Airways\n\nCorporation[1952] QBD 1016, 1019-1020, Barry J explained the ambit of the term\n\n\"wilful misconduct\" in the Warsaw Convention in the following terms:Wilful misconduct is misconduct to which the will is a party, and it is\n\n  wholly different in kind from mere negligence or carelessness, however gross that\n\n  negligence or carelessness may be ….In order to establish wilful misconduct, the plaintiff must satisfy you\n\n  that the person who did the act knew at the time that he was doing something wrong and yet\n\n  did it notwithstanding, or, alternatively, that he did it quite recklessly, not caring\n\n  whether he was doing the right thing or the wrong thing, quite regardless of the effects\n\n  of what he was doing on the safety of the aircraft and of the passengers for which and for\n\n  whom he was responsible. That is something quite different from negligence or carelessness\n\n  or error of judgment, or even incompetence, where the wrongful intention is absent. All\n\n  these human failings – errors of judgment, carelessness, negligence or incompetence -\n\n  may give rise to acts which in the judgment of ordinary reasonable people may amount to\n\n  misconduct, but the element of wilfulness is there missing.174.    In similar vein, inThomas Cook v Air Malta[1997] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 399, 408, Cresswell J had occasion to observe as follows:What does amount to wilful misconduct? A person wilfully misconducts\n\n  himself if he knows and appreciates that it is misconduct on his part in the circumstances\n\n  to do or to fail or omit to do something and yet (a) intentionally does or fails or omits\n\n  to do it or (b) persists in the act, failure or omission regardless of the consequences or\n\n  (c) acts with reckless carelessness, not caring what the results of his carelessness may\n\n  be.175.    For reasons already stated in the discussion of\n\nproof of recklessness in relation to the amended Convention, there is no evidence that the\n\ncrash of Flight MI 185 resulted from wilful misconduct on the part of Captain Tsu or F/O\n\nWard.H. CONCLUSION176.    At the end of the trial, it was evident that the\n\ncause of the crash of Flight MI 185 was not proven. In this regard, the following words of\n\nLord Brandon inRhesa Shipping Co SA v Edmunds and Another (The Popi M)[1985] 2 All ER 712, 714 are instructive although that case concerned the loss of a ship:[I]t is always open to a court, even after the kind of prolonged\n\n  inquiry with a mass of expert evidence which took place in this case, to conclude, at the\n\n  end of the day, that the proximate cause of the ship’s loss, even on a balance of\n\n  probabilities, remains in doubt, with the consequence that the shipowners have failed to\n\n  discharge the burden of proof which lay on them.177.    As the plaintiffs did not discharge the burden\n\nof proving their assertions regarding the cause of the crash of Flight MI 185, SilkAir is\n\nnot barred by the Warsaw Convention and the amended Convention from limiting its liability\n\nwith respect to the crash. The plaintiffs’ claim against SilkAir is thus dismissed\n\nwith costs.Sgd:TAN LEE MENGJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
