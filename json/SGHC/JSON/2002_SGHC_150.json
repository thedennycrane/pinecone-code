        "Background To The Application": "1.        KLW Holdings Ltd\n\n(\"KLW\") owns a subsidiary company known as Barang Barang Pte Ltd (\"Barang\n\nBarang\"). This subsidiary was, at all material times, in the business of retailing\n\nhome furnishing products. Sometime about 2000 KLW had bought over Barang Barang from its\n\nfounding partners, Mr. Sonny Boey and Mr. Alvin Chua. The two former partners continued\n\ntheir ties with the company by signing service contracts with it, but these agreements\n\nwere terminated (with ensuing litigation between the two partners and Barang Barang).\n\nPayments due from KLW to the two partners in respect of the purchase of Barang Barang were\n\nterminated by KLW. There were allegations by KLW that the two former partners were in\n\nbreach of the purchase agreement because they had set up business in competition with\n\nBarang Barang. Arising from these events, the Business Times, a newspaper owned by\n\nSingapore Press Holdings Ltd, published a story on 22 February 2002. KLW is unhappy over\n\ntwo aspects of the published story, which, it says, created the impression that KLW\n\ndefaulted in its payments to Mr. Boey and Mr. Chua from the outset. Mr. Mulani, counsel\n\nfor KLW submitted that the payments were stopped because of the alleged breach of\n\nagreement by the two former partners. Secondly, KLW alleges that the Business Times story\n\nsuggested that KLW defaulted because it was in financial difficulties. Singapore Press\n\nHoldings denies that the Business Times story is in any way libelous.2.        KLW applied by way of this\n\nOriginating Summons for pre-trial discovery of documents against Singapore Press Holdings.\n\nThe documents required were described in the applications as:\"a.        notes of interview,\n\n  in documentary or mechanical form, with the maker of the statements 'there was a clause\n\n  that said the two men had to be paid for their stakes first. But since the takeover, KLW\n\n  has been defaulting on the payment,' appearing in the article, andb.        working drafts of the\n\n  article made in the course of publishing the said article\".",
        "The Broad Issues": "3.        There was no disguise that\n\nthe purpose of the discovery application was to ascertain the source from which the\n\nBusiness Times obtained its information. It is obvious that KLW intends to take whatever\n\naction that it may be advised against the source. The assistant registrar dismissed the\n\napplication and KLW appealed against that decision before me. Mr. Hri Kumar submitted on\n\nbehalf of Singapore Press Holdings that KLW is not entitled to the discovery sought\n\nbecause it is, in substance, an application for an order that Business Times discloses its\n\nsource of information. Mr. Kumar relies on the \"newspaper rule\" developed by the\n\ncommon law courts in England that protects the identity of a newspaper's source. Secondly,\n\nMr. Kumar says, that even if we do not recognise such protection in Singapore, the court\n\nhas a discretion in deciding whether such discover may be ordered. Thirdly, he submitted,\n\neven if discovery of the identity of the source is permitted, the documents required by\n\nKLW are irrelevant and that the information sought by KLW ought to have been asked for by\n\nway of interrogatory rather than a discovery of the specified documents.4.        KLW's application was made\n\nunder O 24 r 5, which provides as follows:\"1.        The Defendants shall\n\n  within 14 days of the order to be made hereon, give discovery of the following  \n\n  documents pertaining to the article entitled \"KLW in tussle with Barang Barang\n\n  founder\" appearing in The Business Times on Friday, 22 February 2002, viz.: -a.        notes of interview, in documentary or\n\n  mechanical form, with the maker of the statements \"There was a clause that said\n\n  the two men had to be paid for their stakes first. But since the takeover, KLW has been\n\n  defaulting on the payment,\" appearing in the said article, andb.        working drafts of the article made in the\n\n  course of publishing the said article.2.        The said discovery\n\n  shall be made by way of a list of documents, together with an affidavit verifying the said\n\n  list, filed and served upon the Plaintiffs within 14 days of the order made hereon,\n\n  stating whether the listed documents are or at any time have been in the Defendants’\n\n  possession, custody or power and, if not now in their possession, custody or power, when\n\n  they parted with the same and what has become of them.\"",
        "The \"Newspaper Rule\"": "5.        Counsel have conveniently\n\nreferred to Mr. Kumar's mainline objection as the \"newspaper rule\". It appears\n\nfrom the reported authorities that the origin of this \"rule\" is vague. The rule\n\nhas sometimes being conveniently regarded merely as a rule of practice (as per Lord\n\nDenning inAtt. Gen v Mulholland-see below). InBroadcasting Corporation Of New\n\nZealand v Alex Harvey Industries Ltd[1980] 1 NZLR 163 it is described as \"an\n\nexception from the general rule that a party to a suit must make discovery of and produce\n\nfor inspection all documents relevant to the action and answer all relevant\n\ninterrogatories. The rule is that newspapers will not be compelled to disclose sources of\n\ninformation in pre-trial discovery, including both production of documents and answers to\n\ninterrogatories\".PerMcMullin J. This rule was examined in some detail inBritish\n\nSteel Corporation v Granada Television Ltd[1980] 3 WLR 774. The facts there are\n\nfairly simple. Granada Television (the defendant) aired a documentary programme about the\n\nsteel strike in Britain about that time. Confidential documents belonging to the British\n\nSteel Corporation (the plaintiff) were used in the programme. It was not disputed that the\n\nperson (or persons) who released those documents to Granada Television was in breach of\n\nhis duty of confidentiality. Alexander Irvine QC, counsel for Granada Television made no\n\nattempt to suggest that the defendant received or used the documents in ignorance of their\n\nconfidential nature. It was thus accepted for the purpose of the proceedings there that\n\nthe defendant used the documents with the knowledge that it was in contravention of the\n\nBritish Steel Corporation's rights. Sir Robert Megarry V-C heard application by the\n\nBritish Steel Corporation at first instance. The plaintiff had sought, among other\n\nprayers, an order that Granada discloses the names of those who supplied it with the\n\nconfidential documents. The primary proposition of Irvine QC, as summarised by Sir Robert\n\nMegarry, was that \"the court has the discretion to refuse to order disclosure where\n\ndisclosure would be in breach of some ethical or social value, and that the confidential\n\nrelationship between newspapers or other media of information and their sources of\n\ninformation was an ethical or social value which the court ought to protect by refusing to\n\norder any disclosure\". Sir Robert Megarry's order for disclosure was taken by Granada\n\nto the House of Lords, when it failed to persuade any of the Justices of Appeal in the\n\nCourt of Appeal to its cause. Irvine QC's solitary success was to secure the dissent of\n\nLord Salmon who was of the view that the \"newspaper rule\" had been too well\n\nestablished that \"it would be wrong to sweep the immunity away\" [1980] 3 WLR\n\n774, at 846. Woodhouse J (and the two other appeal court judges) in theBroadcasting\n\nCorporation Of New Zealandcase was in full agreement with Lord Salmon but he went\n\nfurther to express that the time had come to extend the rule even to disclosure at trial\n\n(See [1980] 1 NZLR 163, 169.)6.        TheBritish Steel\n\nCorporationcase follows closely to the modern juristic landmark,Norwich Pharmacal\n\nv Customs And Excise Commissioners[1974] AC 133. That was a case in which the court\n\nheld that the defendants were obliged to reveal the names of illicit importers of a drug\n\nknown asfurazolidoneon the ground that the illegal activity infringed the\n\nplaintiff's patent. The application was allowed on the ground that a person who is\n\ninvolved in a tortious act, even though innocuously, is obliged to assist those who are\n\ninjured by that act, and must, therefore, disclose the names of the wrongdoers. So,\n\nstrictly speaking, these two important cases were not dealing specifically with the\n\nnewspaper rule although strong dicta on the rule are to be found in all the judgments in\n\ntheBritish Steel Corporationcase. Counsel also made reference to numerous other\n\ncases in various jurisdictions including, Hong Kong, Canada and Australia, that had\n\nconsidered the application of the newspaper rule; but none of them are from Singapore. The\n\ncourts are not all of like mind on the question as to whether the rule exists or should\n\nexist, and if so, the basis for its existence.7.        I have set out above what\n\nthe so-called \"newspaper rule\" is, but it will be helpful to examine a short\n\npassage from the judgment of Lord Denning M.R. inAtt. Gen v Mulholland[1963] 2 QB\n\n477, 490 in which he talks about the basis of that rule in these words:\"The courts will not as a rule compel a newspaper in a libel\n\n    action to disclose before the trial the source of its information. The reason is because,\n\n    on weighing the considerations involved, the balance is in favour of exempting the\n\n    newspaper from disclosure. The person who is defamed has his remedy against the newspaper\n\n    and that is enough, without letting him delve round to see who else he can sue. It may\n\n    rightly be said, as Buckley L.J. said inAdam v Fisher(1914) 30 TLR 288, CA, that\n\n    the public has an interest to see that the newspapers are not compelled to disclose their\n\n    source of information; unless, I would add, the interests of justice so demand. But that\n\n    rule is not a rule of law; it is only a rule of practice which applies in those particular\n\n    cases. It is made more general now and applies not only to newspapers but to other persons\n\n    in the particular circumstances covered by RSC Ord 31, r 1A. It seems to me that whenever\n\n    a case arises when the interests of justice or of the public require that there should be\n\n    disclosure and the judge so rules, the newspapers must disclose the source of their\n\n    information; they have no privilege in law to refuse.\"That the precise reasons for this rule is not clear is evident from\n\ndiverse judicial comments such as that of Lindley LJ inHennessy v Wright (No. 2)24 QBD 445, 449 and the Court of Appeal inHope v Brash[1897] 2 QB 188 also\n\nreferring to the rule as a \"rule of practice\" as did Lord Denning in theMulhollandcase. In cases, such asBritish Steel Corporation,where attempts were made to\n\nrationalize the rule, the usual approach was to regard the public interest as the basis\n\nfor its existence. The public interest at stake, in the opinion of the judges who adopted\n\nthis approach, is the \"public interest in the free flow of information\" (See\n\nLord Salmon's judgment in theBritish Steel Corporationcase, and that of the Hong\n\nKong Court of Appeal inSham John v Eastweek Publisher Ltd[1995] 1 HKC 264. The\n\nCanadian courts inReid v TelegramPublishing Co Ltd[1961] 28 DLR (2d) 6,\n\nandWismer v MacClean-Hunter Publishing Co Ltd[1954] 1 DLR 501 (not followed in\n\nthe laterReidcase), and also the Australian decision inMcGuinness v\n\nAttorney-General For Victoria63 CLR 73, considered the rule in terms of public\n\npolicy, which is really not quite the same thing as the public interest. In the case of\n\nthe latter, an objective comparison of competing public interests (such as that between\n\nthe desirability of a free flow of information and the needs of administering justice).8.        If the rule exists by\n\nreason of public policy or, in the public interest, then it can only be examined and\n\nestablished according to the circumstances of the individual jurisdiction. For my part, I\n\nsee no need to adopt either public policy or public interest as the direct or main ground\n\nfor recognising or not recognising the \"newspaper rule\" in our jurisdiction. I\n\nhold this view because I think that the issue may be dealt with sufficiently without\n\nreliance on public policy or a comprehensive balancing of public interests. Public policy,\n\nas all lawyers know, is an unruly horse - best left to be tamed in the stable of the\n\nlegislature. I shall elaborate shortly as to the question of the public interest.9.        The privilege of exemption\n\nfrom the court's power to order disclosure in civil cases, has been granted, as far as I\n\nknow, only under the Legal Profession Act. That privilege is extended not to the lawyer\n\nbut to his client. Journalists, like members of respectable callings such as priests and\n\ndoctors, have not this privilege. It is a privilege borne of a necessity towards the\n\nadministration of justice; especially so in an adversarial system of litigation such as we\n\nhave. The confidentiality between doctor and patient, or between priest and parishioner,\n\nis one aspect of their relationship (admittedly, a very important one) but it is not as\n\nall encompassing as that between the lawyer and his client. Confidentiality between the\n\nclient and his lawyer is inherent, and arises as a matter of course, in the litigation\n\nprocess (and where potential litigation can be contemplated), and forms the very essence\n\nof that relationship. Furthermore, where the privilege is specifically created by statute,\n\nas in the case of the solicitor and his client, the material question is whether the\n\ncourts may or ought to confer the same privilege to other categories of persons. I think\n\nnot. The authorities from England and its antipodes rely on a rule that was recognised to\n\nbe applied for over a hundred years, and which in turn, was based on a balance of public\n\ninterests, (and possibly on grounds of public policy as well). The public interest that\n\nappears to be a matter of great persuasion in the judgments that Mr. Kumar relies on is\n\nthe interest of the public to a free flow of information, and freedom of the press. Mr.\n\nKumar further submitted that the sources of information to the press will dry up if\n\nconfidentiality of their identity cannot be maintained. He argues that \"investigative\n\njournalism has proved itself a useful adjunct of the freedom of the press\". In my\n\nview, this aspect of the public interest cannot be considered in isolation and must be\n\nevaluated against the corollary interest of the public in having a responsible press. But\n\nif Sir Robert Megarry thought that the term \"investigative journalism\" is a cant\n\nphrase, so too, I think would phrases such as \"freedom of the press\" and\n\nperhaps, also \"responsible press\" be. Tempting as it is to do so, I would\n\ndecline to examine the meaning of those terms in this judgment because, as I have said, it\n\nis not necessary to do so. I am also loathe to apply a rule merely because it had stood\n\nfor over a hundred years in England. From what I have stated above, it will appear that\n\nthe so called \"newspaper rule\" was founded on public policy and public interest\n\nconsiderations, all of which must be discerned and evaluated in the circumstances of each\n\nindividual jurisdiction. In the Hong Kong case ofSham Johnv Eastweekin\n\noverruling the judge at first instance, Nazareth JA in the Court of Appeal was of the view\n\nthat the balance of public interest should be between the balancing of \"the interest\n\nin upholding the administration of justice, the bringing of wrongdoers before the court,\n\nand the prevention of injustice\" against the \"free flow of information\"\n\n[1995] 1 HKC 264, at 275. The Court Of Appeal there came down decidedly in favour of the\n\nfree flow of information. I cannot find myself agreeing with that view. A free flow of\n\ninformation cannot mean an unstoppable flow of information. I fear that such a view will\n\nonly encourage the unseen character assassin and other mischief makers. I doubt if the\n\npress would condescend to be used in that way. No argument was advanced to persuade me\n\nthat if the rule is not recognised, the newspaper's sources of information would cease to\n\ncome forward. I think that any such fear is more imagined than real. In most libel actions\n\nthe plaintiff's grievances and compensation would have been adequately resolved through\n\nvictory over the defendant publisher, and there is usually no need to go further; let\n\nalone go ahead before the action and the determination of whether there is in fact libel.\n\nThe \"newspaper rule\" has had no history in our jurisdiction for me to consider\n\nadopting purely as a matter of practice. It is also well documented that its boundaries\n\nare ill-defined even in those jurisdictions that recognise it. So, for the avoidance of\n\ndoubt, I will hold that there is no \"newspaper rule\" here. But that is not to\n\nsay that the applicant is entitled to the information it sought - at this stage.",
        "Pre-Trial Discovery": "10.        The views that I had\n\nexpressed above generally relates not only to the discovery of information in the course\n\nof an action, where it may be presupposed that in ordering discovery the court will always\n\nhave regard to the questions of relevancy and admissibility, but also to the pre-trial\n\nstage. It suffices for me to say that therefore, even in the course of an action (whether\n\nat an interlocutory stage or at trial) the court may not order disclosure of the identity\n\nof a newspaper’s informant unless it thinks that it is relevant to do so. The present\n\napplication before me is a pre-action discovery application. Slightly different\n\nconsiderations apply.Prima facia, in such circumstances, the courts are entitled\n\nto lean in favour of confidentiality. What is spoken in confidence ought to be kept in\n\nconfidence. Confidentiality must, therefore, be observed unless the greater interests of\n\njustice demand otherwise. The burden of proof lies with the applicant.11.        Counsel for the plaintiff\n\nand defendant engaged themselves in an extensive debate over the scope and application of\n\nthe Australian High Court decision inJohnFairfax & Sons Ltd v Cojungco[1988] 165 CLR 346. The five-judge court delivered a single judgment holding that the\n\nmedia and journalists have no privilege against the disclosure of their sources of\n\ninformation where justice requires. However, it carried out a balancing exercise of the\n\ntension between the public interest to have a free flow of information and \"the\n\npublic interest of the litigant in securing a trial of his action on the basis of the\n\nrelevant and admissible evidence\", and concluded that that \"is why the courts\n\nhave refused to accord absolute protection on the confidentiality of the journalist’s\n\nsource of information, whilst at the same time imposing some restraints on the entitlement\n\nof a litigant to compel disclosure of the identity of the source. In effect, the courts\n\nhave acted on the principle that disclosure of the source will not be required unless it\n\nis necessary in the interests of justice. So, generally, disclosure will not be compelled\n\nat an interlocutory stage of a defamation or related action and even at the trial the\n\ncourt will not compel disclosure unless it is necessary to do justice to the\n\nparties\"(ibidat page 354). I respectfully endorse this view and will only\n\nadd that the term \"in the interests of justice\" ought to be regarded cautiously,\n\nand with regard to the specific rules pertaining to relevancy and admissibility of\n\nevidence.12.        Hence, the privilege, or\n\notherwise, of a journalist from disclosing his source of information is only one aspect of\n\nquestion. A person may only be compelled to disclose confidential information only when\n\nthe applicant can persuade the court that he has a right to that information. That right\n\nwas well proved in theNorwich PharmacalandBritish Steel Corporationcases. In the present case before me, the plaintiff applicant claims that the defendant\n\nhas libeled it. It wants to know who gave the information to the defendant that was used\n\nin the libel, but the defendant disputes that their publication was libelous. Whether it\n\nis or not is the big question for the trial. The disclosure of the source is presently not\n\nrelevant. In theNorwich PharmacalandBritish Steel Corporationcases the\n\napplicant was able to identify the connection between the information held by the\n\ndefendant to the injury it suffered and continues to suffer unless positive steps are\n\ntaken to stop it. Nothing close to that has been put before me and, furthermore, until a\n\nreal and substantive connection is made, there is no basis at this stage to assume that\n\nthe notes and drafts of the journalist would be relevant to the alleged libel. I therefore\n\nhold that even if it is assumed that the identity of the informant is relevant at this\n\npoint, the journalist’s notes and drafts cannot be relevant. The issue may, of\n\ncourse, emerge again at trial when more facts become available, but that is another story.13.        The plaintiff is, of\n\ncourse, entitled to pray for an order for disclosure as part of the reliefs sought should\n\nthe trial judge rule in its favour. There being no evidence before me that the plaintiff\n\nwill be prejudiced if it has to wait until then, the orders sought by it should not be\n\nallowed and the assistant registrar was therefore correct in dismissing the\n\nplaintiff’s application, whose appeal I now dismiss. I shall hear the question of\n\ncosts at a later date if the parties are unable to agree costs themselves.Sgd:Choo Han TeckJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
