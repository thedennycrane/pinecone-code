        "Cases and Textbooks": "55.    Both Mr Teh and Mr Chung cited to me the cases of (a)Panamena,\n\n(b)Perini, (c)Lubenham Fidelities and Investments Co Ltd v South Pembrokeshire\n\nDistrict Council & another(1986) 33 BLR 39 (‘Lubenham’) and (d)\n\nthe judgment in Civil Appeal No 85 of 1999 (‘C.A. No 85 of 1999’).56.    Mr Teh’s submission was\n\nthat there is no implied obligation on an owner to marshall its architect. For this\n\nproposition, he relied on paragraph 50 of the judgment in C.A. No 85 of 1999.57.    Mr Teh’s alternative\n\nsubmission, which appeared to be his main argument, was that if there is an implied\n\nobligation to marshall the architect, this was predicated on an owner first knowing that\n\nthe architect is not discharging his functions properly. For this proposition, he relied\n\non Panamena and Perini. He also relied on Emden’s Construction Law Issue 56/June 1999\n\nat p.II 274 to 275 and Hudson’s Building & Engineering Contracts, 1995, para\n\n4.200.58.    Mr Teh also relied on paragraphs 43\n\nand 44 of the judgment in C.A. No 85 of 1999 for his alternative submission.59.    Accordingly, Mr Teh was relying on\n\ndifferent parts of the judgment in C.A. No 85 of 1999 to support both his submissions\n\nalthough they were in the alternative.60.    For his part, Mr Chung relied on\n\nPanamena and Perini for the proposition that there is an implied obligation on the part of\n\nthe owner to ensure that a certifier is carrying out his duty properly.61.    Yet on the other hand, Mr Chung\n\nsought to draw a distinction between Panamena and Perini on the one hand and the appeal\n\nbefore me. As I have mentioned above, he submitted that in so far as Panamena and Perini\n\nmentioned the requirement of knowledge on the part of the owner to render the owner\n\nliable, this was relevant for function (b) but not for function (a).62.    He also argued that paragraph 43 of\n\nthe judgment in C.A. No 85 of 1999 was applicable to function (b) only.63.    As for Lubenham, Mr Chung said it\n\nwas authority for the proposition that if there was a wrongful deduction in a certificate\n\nfrom an architect, then the certification could be challenged in arbitration.64.    Mr Chung also cited various\n\ntextbooks. I have mentioned a number of them above.65.    It is therefore necessary for me to\n\nanalyse (a) Panamena, (b) Perini, (c) Lubenham, (d) the judgment in C.A. No 85 of 1999 and\n\n(e) the textbooks in so far as they have not already been dealt with above.Panamena66.    InPanamena, the plaintiff repairers had entered into an\n\nagreement with the Ministry of War Transport and the defendants to repair a steamship.67.    Clause 7 of the agreement provided:‘7. The owners shall pay for the\n\n  repairs upon the ordinary commercial basis, i.e., labour plus twenty-five per cent thereof\n\n  for establishment charges plus cost of material plus ten per centum profit on the total of\n\n  these three items plus sub-contractors and cash disbursements (including dock dues) plus\n\n  give per cent all old material except heavy parts of machinery to become repairers’\n\n  property. Payment shall be effected as required by the repairers on the basis of cash\n\n  against expenditure during the progress of the work and the ascertained balance on the\n\n  completion of the repairs and every such payment shall be effected promptly by the owners\n\n  after the issue of a certificate by the owners’ surveyor that the work has been\n\n  satisfactorily carried out and on receipt of a certificate of the amount due issued by the\n\n  Costs Investigation Branch of the Ministry of War Transport and certifying that same has\n\n  been checked and found correct (and the Minister agrees to procure that the said Costs\n\n  Investigation Branch shall so certify and issue certificates). The repairers shall keep\n\n  correct and full entries and accounts of all wages expended and of the cost of all\n\n  materials and things used in the execution of the repairs and shall permit the accountants\n\n  of the said Costs Investigation Branch to inspect and examine all such entries and\n\n  accounts and shall produce to them all vouchers and documents necessary for showing the\n\n  amount of such wages materials and things and for vouching the same and shall give to such\n\n  accountants all such information facilities and assistance as shall be reasonably required\n\n  by them to enable them fully to understand such entries and accounts and other particulars\n\n  and to determine the sums from time to time payable by the owners in respect of the\n\n  further repairs and to issue the said certificates accordingly. Such last-mentioned\n\n  certificates shall be accepted by the parties hereto as final and conclusive and shall not\n\n  be questioned except as regards any error appearing on the face thereof and of which due\n\n  notice shall forthwith be given to the said Costs Investigation Branch.’68.    The Costs Investigation Branch of the Ministry of War Transport\n\ndid certify the charges due to the plaintiffs but the defendants denied that the money was\n\ndue as the surveyor had not issued his certificate.69.    The surveyor wanted to check the\n\namount claimed by the plaintiffs but the plaintiffs contended that his function was to\n\nconsider only the quality of the work done and not the amount.70.    The Court of Appeal agreed that the\n\nsurveyor’s function was to consider only the quality of the work done and not the\n\namount.71.    In the course of his judgment, Scott\n\nLJ said at p.124:‘Let us consider the position. The\n\n  repairers were entitled to rely on the surveyor doing what the contract said he was to do,\n\n  that is, keeping to matters of quality only. It seems to me plain that if the shipowners\n\n  had known that he was departing from his proper function under the contractor, it would\n\n  have been their duty to stop him and tell him what the function was for which the contract\n\n  provided, just as much so as if he had had in his possession a draft of the contract which\n\n  gave him a wider field than was given by the executed contract, and the owners had\n\n  realised that he was going wrong because his draft was an incorrect version of the real\n\n  contract. It obviously was not the contractual duty of the repairers to bring him to book.\n\n  It is equally obvious that they would count on his carrying out his proper function. In\n\n  those circumstances I think the Courtought to imply an undertaking by the owners that\n\n  in the event of its becoming known to them that their surveyor was departing from the\n\n  function which both parties had agreed he was to perform, they would call him to book, and\n\n  tell him what his real function was.This seems to me an implication exactly on\n\n  the lines of all the authorities on implied terms from theMoorcock, 14 P.D. 64,\n\n  down to Luxor (Eastbourne), Ltd. V. Cooper, [1941] A.C. 108 …’[Emphasis added.]72.    It is the first paragraph above on which Mr Chung relies to find\n\nliability on the part of the Appellants for interest for loss of use of various sums of\n\nmoney. On the other hand, it is also this paragraph which Mr Teh relies on to argue that\n\nan owner must know of the default before the owner is liable for the certifier’s\n\ndefault.73.    Goddard LJ seemed to have taken a\n\nsimilar position as Scott LJ. At p.127, he says:‘The appointment of the surveyor in\n\n  this case was to be made by the defendants, and they could appoint whom they liked. If\n\n  they failed to appoint anyone, obviously they could not rely on the absence of a\n\n  certificate. Equally, it seems to me, they must appoint someone who is willing to perform\n\n  the duty assigned to him by the contract. If he will not or cannot perform that duty they\n\n  must appoint someone who will. Here it is clear that Dr. Telfer refused to perform the\n\n  simple duty of certifying whether the work was properly done, from the point of view of\n\n  quality, because he took the view, and I will assume honestly, that the contract enabled\n\n  and indeed required him to do something else and to concern himself with cost, with which\n\n  he was in no way concerned and which was the business of the Costs Investigation Branch.\n\n  He, therefore, was unwilling to carry out the duty assigned by the contract to him. The\n\n  defendants either were of the same opinion or adopted his view; for this purpose, it\n\n  matters not which. Consequently they neither required him to certify in accordance with\n\n  the contract nor did they appoint anyone else in his place. It is no answer for them to\n\n  say that that was because they misinterpreted the contract. It is often the case that a\n\n  person is guilty of a breach of contract because he has placed a wrong construction on it,\n\n  but that affords him no defence.’74.    In the House of Lords, Lord Thankerton said, at p.436:‘… If the appellants had taken\n\n  the contrary view of their surveyor’s function under cl. 7, it would have been their\n\n  duty to appoint another surveyor to discharge that function, and if they had refused to\n\n  appoint another surveyor, the respondents would clearly have been absolved from the\n\n  necessity of obtaining the surveyor’s certificate; the respondents are equally so\n\n  absolved when the appellants’ wrongful view of their surveyor’s function under\n\n  cl. 7 prevents the appellants from obtaining the certificate. I agree with the view\n\n  expressed on this point by Goddard L.J.’75.    There are factors which differentiate Panamena from the appeal\n\nbefore me.76.    First, it is important to bear in\n\nmind that inPanamena, the plaintiffs were not claiming for interest for loss of\n\nuse of a sum or sums of money. They were claiming to be entitled to be paid the principal\n\nsum or sums notwithstanding the absence of a certificate by the surveyor. In the\n\nparticular circumstances of that case, they were successful.77.    Secondly, inPanamena, the\n\nsurveyor, one Dr Telfar, was the president of the defendant company. There was also a\n\nclose relationship between him and the defendant company. It was he who had advised Messrs\n\nJ.D. Chandris and D.J. Chandris to buy the vessel and it was bought in Dr Telfar’s\n\nname on their behalf when the defendant company was incorporated. Dr Telfar became\n\npresident and director and his wife became the other director of the defendant company.78.    Thirdly, the court there agreed that\n\nthe defendants had been influencing Dr Telfar with their views and Dr Telfar was not\n\nacting impartially.79.    In the appeal before me, none of the\n\nprofessionals in the firm of the Architect is employed or is an officer of the Appellants,\n\nalthough the Architect was appointed by the Appellants.80.    Secondly, there is no suggestion in\n\nthe appeal before me that the Appellants were influencing the Architect. Indeed the claim\n\nof the Respondents was to the contrary i.e. that the Appellants were obliged to ensure\n\nthat the Architect discharged its duties properly. The Appellants were supposed to ensure\n\nthis by telling the Architect to issue the certificates in question.81.    In so far as the judgments inPanamenasay that it was the duty of the defendants to tell the repairer what his function was and\n\nto call him to book, if the defendants had known that he was departing from his proper\n\nfunction under the contract, I would respectfully suggest that this proposition be\n\nconfined to the particular facts of thePanamena.82.    In so far as Scott LJ implied such a\n\nduty from authorities like theMoorcock14 PD 64 down toLuxor (Eastbourne) Ltd\n\nv Cooper[1941] AC 108, these authorities only say that a term should be implied if\n\nbusiness efficacy requires it.83.    I do not see why it is necessary for\n\nbusiness efficacy to imply a duty on an owner to tell an architect what to do regarding\n\nhis certifying function.84.    On the contrary, it would impede\n\nbusiness efficacy if an owner was obliged and entitled to tell an architect what to do\n\nregarding his certifying function. It must not be forgotten that just as the architect may\n\nbe wrong in discharging his certifying function, it may be that the owner is wrong in his\n\nassessment of whether the architect is or is not discharging his function properly.85.    Furthermore, as it is accepted that\n\nan architect, as certifier, must act fairly, impartially and independently, the owner is\n\nnot entitled to tell him what to do. An architect cannot act independently if the owner is\n\nentitled to remove him and appoint someone else just because the owner believes that the\n\narchitect has failed to discharge his duty or has discharged his duty wrongly.86.    However, if the architect is no\n\nlonger able to act as certifier because, for example, he has retired, then the owner may\n\nand should appoint someone else in his place, seeCroudace Ltd v London Borough of\n\nLambeth(1986) 33 BLR 25.87.    I find support for my view not only\n\nfrom basic principles but from cases as well.88.    InMinster Trust Ltd v Traps\n\nTractors Ltd(1954) 1 WLR 963 (‘Minster Trust’), Devlin J said at\n\np.974:‘If two parties agree to appoint an\n\n  arbitrator … it would be, I think, implied in the contract to give it business\n\n  efficacy that neither side would seek to interfere with his independence.’89.    This statement was made in the context of the quasi-arbitral\n\nnature of the certifier’s function.90.    InKempster v Bank of Montreal[1871] 32 Up.Can Q.B. 87 (‘Kempster’), the plaintiffs were engaged to carry out\n\nalterations and additions to the defendants’ banking house. Under their contract, the\n\ndefendants were to pay the plaintiffs the value of the works done to be fixed by the\n\ndefendants’ overseer.91.    The plaintiffs alleged that it was\n\nagreed that the defendants would procure the overseer to, and that he would, wherever the\n\nplaintiffs were entitled to any such certificates, give such certificates.92.    Chief Justice Draper pointed out\n\nthat the contract differed widely from what was contended for by the plaintiffs. He said\n\nat p.94 and 95:‘This deed or agreement differs\n\n  widely from that which is stated in the declaration…. It contains no covenant or\n\n  agreement on the part of the defendants that they would cause or procure Hills to give the\n\n  necessary certificates to entitle the plaintiffs to demand any payment, or would cause or\n\n  procure Hills to estimate the value of extra work done; and therefore, so far as express\n\n  covenant goes, the defendants have committed no breach in not procuring Hills to do either\n\n  of these acts, the performing or withholding which were among the matters to be determined\n\n  and adjusted by Hills without reference in any way to any other person. And the deeddoes\n\n  not afford any pretext for implyingsuch an agreement or duty on the part of the\n\n  defendants, for there are express stipulations as to the giving of such certificates and\n\n  making of such estimates, and no implication can arise where the contract is fully set\n\n  out, for it would be at variance with what is fully set out. It is beyond doubt that both\n\n  parties, as is said by Hannen, J., inJones v. St. John’s College,L.R. 6\n\n  Q.B., at p.127, intended \"to rely on the fairness as well as the skill and judgment\n\n  of\" the surveyor, Hills; and, to borrow another phrase from the same judgment,\n\n  \"it seems to be impossible for the English language to supply words by which a man\n\n  can bind himself, if this contract does not\" bind the plaintiffs.’[Emphasis added.]93.    I refer next toHickman & Co v Roberts[1913] AC 229.\n\nIn that case, payment was to be made by the owners to the contractor on certificates to be\n\nissued by the architect. It was found as a fact that the architect had allowed his\n\njudgment to be influenced by the owners and the architect had improperly delayed issuing\n\nvarious interim certificates and the final certificate.94.    The contractor sued for the final\n\nbalance but the final certificate was not issued until after the commencement of the\n\naction. The House of Lords held, inter alia, that the issue of the certificate was not a\n\ncondition precedent to the bringing of the action.95.    I refer to the judgment of Lord Shaw\n\nof Dunfermline where, at p.239, he says the following about the architect in that case:‘… and I find that it is\n\n  established, conclusively as I think, that he did not act with sufficient firmness to\n\n  enable him to decide questions according to his own opinion, those questions affectingthe\n\n  issueof certificates andthe interim amountsthereof.Instead of doing so,\n\n  my Lords, he accepted the instructions or orders of the ownersand their solicitors\n\n  upon that topic.’[Emphasis added.]96.    If an architect is to decide on the issue of certificates and the\n\namounts thereof without following the instructions or orders of the owners, then the\n\nowners cannot be obliged or entitled to give such instructions or orders whether it be to\n\nwithhold a certificate, or, for that matter, to issue a certificate. The withholding and\n\nthe issue of a certificate are both sides of the same coin. Accordingly, an owner cannot\n\nbe liable for not giving such instructions or orders.97.    Indeed, should an architect\n\nissue a certificate because he was told to do so by an owner, and not because he himself\n\nthought it was right to do so, he would have ‘forfeited his independence’ (to\n\nadopt the words of Lord Atkinson inHickman & Co v Robertsat p.238).98.    In my view, these three cases are\n\nauthorities against the implied term contended in the pleadings of the Respondents. The\n\ncase ofLubenhamwhich was decided afterPanamenaandPeriniis\n\nalso against such an implied term. I will refer toLubenhamlater in greater\n\ndetail.99.    NeitherMinster TrustnorKempsterappear to have been cited in the judgments ofPanamena. This may be because\n\nof the nature of the claim before the court there.100.    As for the case ofHickman\n\n& Co v Roberts, it was cited in the judgment of Scott LJ inPanamenabut\n\nin different contexts. At p.124, it was cited in the context that one party had prevented\n\nthe performance of a term in the contract in question. At p.126, it was cited in the\n\ncontext of collusion.101.    Likewise, the judgment of Goddard\n\nLJ inPanamenacitedHickman & Co v Robertsin the context of\n\ncollusion.102.    Neither learned judges had\n\nconsideredHickman & Co v Robertsin the context of whether an owner is\n\nliable for interest for loss of use of money which the contractor has eventually received,\n\nalthough it was received late.103.    Although Lord Thankerton inPanamenadid refer toHickman & Co v Robertsextensively, it was also not in the\n\ncontext I have mentioned.Perini104.    InPerini, the plaintiff contractor was engaged to build\n\nthe Redfern Mail Exchange. The defendant was the building owner. The ‘General\n\nConditions of Contract’ applied. This was a document in a standard form used by the\n\ndefendant for the erection of buildings.105.    The biggest part of the\n\nplaintiff’s claim was in respect of applications for extension of time.106.    It was agreed by the parties there\n\nthat the Supreme Court of New South Wales would only be asked to decide points of law\n\ninvolving the construction of the agreement.107.    Some of the applications for\n\nextensions of time were made for delays to and disruption of the work caused by rain. Some\n\nof the reasons given for refusing applications based upon rain were that the rain was\n\nnormal rain and should have been allowed for by the plaintiff when it submitted its\n\ntender, that the policy of the Department of Works was not to grant extensions for normal\n\nrain but only for abnormal rain and that the rain in fact did not delay the work. Reasons\n\nof a similar character were given with respect to delays caused by industrial disputes.108.    Macfarlan J decided that the\n\nDirector of Works was entitled to consider Departmental policy but was wrong if he\n\nconsidered himself controlled by it.109.    The learned judge then considered\n\nwhether there were implied terms in the contract between the parties which were described\n\nas being negative and positive.110.    In the negative sense, it was\n\nalleged that the owner was bound not to interfere with the proper performance of the\n\nDirector’s duties.111.    In the positive sense, it was\n\nalleged that the owner was bound to ensure that the Director did his duty.112.    Macfarlan J decided that there was\n\nan implied term in the negative sense. However, in the appeal before me, the implied term\n\nin the negative sense was not disputed by Mr Teh. In any event, it was not the case of the\n\nRespondents in the arbitration in respect of Items (a) to (d) that the Appellants had been\n\nin breach of an implied term in the negative sense but in the positive sense.113.    As for the implied term in the\n\npositive sense, Macfarlan J said at p.111:‘I will now consider the affirmative\n\n  aspect of the term which learned counsel for the plaintiff argued must be implied in this\n\n  agreement. Fundamentally he argued it is essential to consider this aspect against the\n\n  background that the Director of Works was at all times aservantof the\n\n  Commonwealth; that the position he occupies as Certifier was part of the machinery set up\n\n  by the agreement of the Commonwealth and the plaintiff for certifying applications for\n\n  extension of time. As such a servant of the Commonwealth the Director of Works was obliged\n\n  by law to obey all lawful orders of the Commonwealth: see Commonwealth Public Service Act\n\n  1922, s.55(1)(a). If, for example, the Commonwealth were to say to the Director: \"You\n\n  are ordered to act in a particular manner\", and if that order constituted a breach of\n\n  the Contractual mandate conferred on him by cl.35, the Director would none the less be\n\n  still obliged to act in compliance with the Commonwealth order. Against this background I\n\n  will assume that the certifier, with the knowledge of both parties to the agreement, acted\n\n  in breach of his obligation. Could the Commonwealth in those circumstances say: \"I\n\n  will not do anything to insure that he carries out these duties\"? In my opinion an\n\n  application of the test stated inThe Moorcock(1889), 14 PB 64; would require the\n\n  answer that the Commonwealth wascontractually bound to order him to carry out his\n\n  duties. In my opinion the plaintiff and the defendant, being the parties bound by his\n\n  agreement,are bound to do all co-operative acts necessary to bring about the\n\n  contractual result. In the case of the defendant this is an obligation to require the\n\n  Director to act in accordance with his mandate if the defendant is aware that he is\n\n  proposing to act beyond it. InMackay v Dick, [1881] 6 App Cas 251, at 263,\n\n  Lord Blackburn said:\"I think I may safely say as a\n\n    general rule that where in a written contract it appears that both parties have agreed\n\n    that something shall be done which cannot effectually by doneunless both concur in\n\n    doing it, the construction of the contract is that each agrees to do all that is\n\n    necessary to be done on his part for the carrying out of that thing, though there may be\n\n    no express words to that effect.\" (Cf. Electronic Industries Ltd v David Jones Ltd(1954), 91 CLR 288, at pp.297, 298.)’[Emphasis added.]114.    The passages cited at p.106 by Macfarlan J fromThe Moorcockwere as follows:‘Any consideration of this point must\n\n  begin with the judgment of Bowen, LJ inThe Moorcock(1889), PD 64. At 14 PD 64 at\n\n  p.68; Bowen, LJ, said:\"and I believe if one were to take\n\n    all the cases, and they are many, of implied warranties or convenants in law, it will be\n\n    found that in all of them the law is raising an implication from the presumed intention of\n\n    the parties with the object of giving to the transaction such efficacy as both parties\n\n    must have intended that at all events it should have.\"At 14 PD 64 at p.70; the learned judge\n\n  also said:\"The question is what inference is to\n\n    be drawn where the parties are dealing with each other on the assumption that the\n\n    negotiations are to have some fruit, and where they say nothing about the burden of this\n\n    kind of unseen peril, leaving the law to raise such inferences as are reasonable from the\n\n    very nature of the transaction.\" ’115.    I note that these passages fromThe Moorcockdo not state\n\nwhat the implied term should be.116.    In my view, it is a quantum leap to\n\nsay that an obligation to do all co-operative acts necessary to bring about the\n\ncontractual result would lead to the conclusion that an owner is bound to order a\n\ncertifier to carry out his duties.117.    Furthermore, it is a contradiction\n\nto say that, on the one hand, an owner must not interfere with the performance of a\n\ncertifier’s duties and yet, on the other hand, an owner must ensure that the\n\ncertifier performs his duties to the extent that the owner must tell the certifier what to\n\ndo if the owner believes the certifier to have defaulted in his duties.118.    In my view, an owner has an implied\n\nduty in the positive sense only to the extent that the owner must provide the certifier\n\nwith such information as the certifier requires. The owner may also make representations\n\nto the certifier short of telling the certifier what to do.119.    Thus, Hudson’s at para 6121\n\nstates:‘However, it is clearly natural and\n\n  to be expected that both parties, contractor as well as owner, may in practice make\n\n  representations to and communicate with the architect or certifier on the subject-matter\n\n  of his decision. Whether such representations or communications amount to improper\n\n  interference will depend upon whether they are of a character which recognises the\n\n  independence of the certifier and his ultimate responsibility for making an impartial\n\n  decision.’120.    Even the judgment of Lord Blackburn inMackay v Dick[1881] 6 App Cas 251 at 263, which was cited by Macfarlan J (see paragraph 113 above),\n\ndoes not lead to the conclusion that an owner is bound to order a certifier to carry out\n\nhis duties.121.    An architect does not have to\n\nrequire both the owner and the contractor to concur before he issues his certificate.122.    Therefore, for example, when the\n\ntime comes to issue a final certificate under the standard conditions, an architect need\n\nnot seek the concurrence of the owner and the contractor thereto.123.    There may well be a practical\n\nreason why an architect would want to obtain such concurrence i.e. if both concur, then\n\nneither will complain that the architect had erred in his final certificate. However\n\npracticality must not be confused with legality. It is the architect’s legal duty to\n\nissue certificates. It is not part of such a duty for him to seek concurrence from the\n\nowner and the contractor. He may seek their responses but not their instructions. Also, he\n\nis not to delay for an unduly long period the issuance of the certificate pending their\n\nresponses. If an architect sits by and waits for the owner and contractor to respond or to\n\nconcur, the architect would have failed to discharge his duty.124.    Consequently, if an architect does\n\nnot want to make a decision on an intended certificate and hopes that an arbitrator will\n\ndecide it for him, the architect would not be carrying out his duty.125.    Although Macfarlan J did citeMinster\n\nTrust(at p.105 to 106) andHickman & Co v Roberts(at p.108 and 109), it\n\nwas in the context of whether a term should be implied and not what the term should be.\n\nFurthermore, although Macfarlan J did cite various passages from Devlin J’s judgment\n\ninMinster Trust, including the one that I cited in paragraph 88 above (see p.105\n\nto 106 of the report onPerini), Marfarlan J did not seem to think that there was\n\nany inconsistency between the proposition, on the one hand, that neither the owner and the\n\ncontractor is to seek to interfere with a certifier’s independence and, on the other\n\nhand, imposing an obligation on the owner to tell the certifier what to do.126.Kempsterwas not cited by\n\nMacfarlan J.127.    It seems that although Macfarlan J\n\nfound that the Director was required to act independently, he was much influenced by the\n\nfact that the Director was the servant of the owner.128.    This fact was noted a numbers of\n\ntimes in his judgment. For example at p.98 to 99, he says:‘In considering the scope of the\n\n  authorityit is essential to pay regard to the position of the Director of Works as it\n\n  is seen apart from any special authority conferred upon him by the agreement. As I\n\n  have already described he is a Senior Commonwealthservantand is the Chief\n\n  Executive Officer of the Department of Works for the State of New South Wales. His duties\n\n  lie within the Department of Works and his subordinates are also within that Department.\n\n  In exercising his administrative functions under the agreement he undoubtedly, as aservantof the Commonwealth, would need to have the interests of the Commonwealth to the fore and\n\n  his actionsas such servantwould be to preserve or further those interests. He is\n\n  also, of course, a public servant and as such subject to the duties and obligations of the\n\n  provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act.If a Commonwealth public servant or\n\n  a Minister of State having authority to do so were to give him an orderwith respect\n\n  to his duties, or the manner of performing them,he would be obliged by law to obeythat order and would be liable to punishment if he did not do so.The important\n\n  relation of the Director of Works to the Department of Worksis emphasized by the\n\n  contract which defines this title as meaning, \"the officer howsoever styled who is in\n\n  charge for the time being of the branch of the Department of Works in the State or\n\n  Territory in which the works are to be executed\". (See cl. 1, General Conditions of\n\n  Contract.) Clause 1 also emphasizes that the expression ‘Director of Works’ is\n\n  to have this meaning wherever it appears in the contract and it is, I think, of\n\n  significance that this meaning is to be given without the common modification that often\n\n  appears in Statutes in the following words: \"unless the context shall otherwise\n\n  require\".’[Emphasis added.]and at p.107 (when he was dealing with the\n\nimplied term in the negative sense):‘I have already held that the duty of\n\n  the Director when acting as Certifier was to act independently and in the exercise of his\n\n  own volition according to the exigencies of a particular application. In my opinion it is\n\n  not possible to assume that the parties to this agreement could have contemplated that he\n\n  would act in manners other than those upon which they have agreed and expressed in cl. 35\n\n  and that it is a consequence of this assumption that they shall have impliedly bound\n\n  themselves one to the other that they would not do anything that would prevent him from a\n\n  proper discharge of the mandate which contractually they have granted to him. It is not\n\n  necessary for any purpose of this case to decide whether the plaintiff is so bound but I\n\n  am of the opinion that the defendant is, and that the obligation of the defendant in this\n\n  respect is more clearly seen because it wasthe employerof the Director who in his\n\n  turn was bound to act as the defendant should direct.’[Emphasis added.]129.    I refer again to the passage at p.111 (which I cited in\n\nparagraph 113 above) where Macfarlan J referred again to the contractor’s argument\n\nthat the Director was a servant of the owner when he considered the positive aspect of the\n\nimplied term.130.    Furthermore, after citing the\n\njudgment of Lord Blackurn inMackay v Dickat p.111, Macfarlan J went on\n\nimmediately to say at p.112:‘I am accordingly of the opinion that\n\n  a term must be implied in the present agreement binding the defendant to insure that the\n\n  Director of Works,its servant, performs his duties under cl. 35 in accordance with\n\n  this mandate.’[Emphasis added.]131.    In considering whether an owner is obliged to tell a certifier\n\nwhat to do, the test is not so much whether the certifier is an officer or servant of the\n\nowner but whether the certifier is expected to act independently. This depends on the\n\nterms of the contract.132.    InA.C. Hatrick (N.Z.) Ltd v\n\nNelson Carlton Construction Co. Ltd. (in liquidation) and others(1964) NZLR 72, the\n\nrole of an engineer/certifier was in issue. Richmond J cited (at p.78) the following\n\npassage from Devlin J’s judgment inMinster Trustwith approval:‘What has to be ascertained in each\n\n  case is whether the agent is or is not intended to function independently of the\n\n  principal. The mere use of the word \"certificate\" is not decisive.’133.    Richmond J went on to conclude on this point (at p.80) as\n\nfollows:‘I think that the true test of the\n\n  functions of a certifier must always be found in the intention of the parties. The\n\n  question to be decided in each case must be whether, as a matter of construction and\n\n  interpretation of the contract, it is apparent that the certifier was to act independently\n\n  of his employer in arriving at his decision.’134.    North P. of the Court of Appeal inNelson Carlton\n\nConstruction Co. (in liquidation) v A C Hatrick (N.Z.) Limited(1965) NZLR 144 was of\n\nthe same view (see p.150 at lines 15 to 21).135.    In addition, the fact that the\n\ncertificate of the engineer or architect may be reviewed by an arbitrator and the fact\n\nthat the engineer or architect was nominated by one party, does not make the engineer or\n\narchitect, as certifier, an agent of the party engaging him (see North P’s judgment\n\nat p.150 at lines 21 to 39).136.    In the appeal before me, it was not\n\nsuggested that the Architect was not to act independently. Indeed its duty to act\n\nindependently, like those of many other firms of architects under standard terms as\n\ncertifier, is too well-established for any suggestion to the contrary to be attempted.137.    The close relationship between the\n\ncertifier and the owner was common inPanamenaand inPerini.138.    On the other hand, there was some\n\ndifference betweenPanamenaandPerini. As Macfarlan J observed, at p.110:‘In that sensePanamena Europea\n\n  Navigation Compania Limitada v Frederick Leyland & Co Ltd,[1947] AC 428, is\n\n  different from the present case where the plaintiff, having been paid its contract price\n\n  claims other damages for breach of the implied term which all members of the Court of\n\n  Appeal inPanamenaheld to have existed.’139.    In my view, the fact that a contractor may be entitled to claim\n\ndamages from the owner over and above the contract price for wrongful denial of extension\n\nof time does not lead to the conclusion that the contractor can also claim damages against\n\nthe owner for interest for loss of use of money in the case of late issuance of\n\ncertificates or for wrongful amounts certified.140.    To claim damages against the owner\n\nfor wrongful denial of extension of time, a contractor need only establish that the\n\narchitect’s decision in refusing to extend time was wrong. To claim interest against\n\nthe owner for receiving money late, a contractor must establish that not only was the\n\narchitect wrong but that the owner was obliged to tell the architect what to do when the\n\narchitect acts as certifier. For the reasons I have stated, there is no such obligation to\n\ntell.Lubenham141.    InLubenham, there was a building dispute arising out of\n\nthree contracts between SPDC (the owners), Wigley Fox Partnership (the architects) and\n\nLubenham Fidelities and Investments Co Ltd (a finance company) which sub-contracted the\n\nwork to building contractors. The court was concerned only with 2 of the contracts.142.    The disputes arose out of interim\n\ncertificates issued by the architects. The certificates set out first the total value of\n\nthe work done up to date and then deducted 3% of the first figure as retention money\n\nprovided for by the contracts. However each certificate then also deducted a sum in\n\nrespect of alleged defective work up to date and a second sum in respect of liquidated\n\ndamages up to 20 May 1977 in respect of alleged delay.143.    It was subsequently common ground\n\nthat in making these deductions, the architects had erred and the certificates were not in\n\naccordance with the relevant contracts.144.    However, at the relevant time, the\n\nowners refused to pay any more than was certified. The architects insisted that their\n\ncertificates were legitimate. The finance company insisted that the certificates were not\n\nlegitimate and that it should be paid a proper figure calculated in accordance with the\n\ncontract.145.    There were many issues but the\n\nrelevant one for present purposes was Issue 2 which was:‘Were the Council in breach of the\n\n  terms of the contracts in failing to pay any sum in respect of the Buttermilk Lane\n\n  certificate and in failing to pay any sum in excess of 2,237 in respect of the Golden\n\n  Hill certificate?’146.    Counsel for the finance company submitted (see p.56):‘… that just as in thePanamenathe repairers were held entitled to recover the full amount due to them under the repair\n\n  contract, notwithstanding the absence of one of the stipulated certificates, so also in\n\n  the instant case should the contractors be entitled to recover the full amount properly\n\n  due to them under clause 30(2) of the building contracts. In thePanamenathe\n\n  shipowners were not entitled to rely on the absence of their surveyor’s certificate:\n\n  so also in this case should the employers not be entitled to rely not only upon the\n\n  absence from their architect’s certificate of material that ought to have been there\n\n  but also upon the presence in that certificate of material which ought not to have been\n\n  there.….More specifically, by their amended notice\n\n  of appeal, Lubenham claimed that the present case falls withinPanamenaon the\n\n  grounds that \"the Council were aware that the Architects regarded the decision as to\n\n  whether or not to deduct liquidated damages as being a decision for Council, were aware of\n\n  the Architects’ intention to make such deductions, expected that they would do so and\n\n  maintained the stand which they had taken on the certificates in the face of the direct\n\n  challenge by Lubenhams to the validity of the deductions\".’147.    However, May LJ said, at p.56 to 57:‘However, the true position was that\n\n  on 26 May 1977 Mr Clive Jones, the job architect, had written to Mr Halpin saying that the\n\n  liquidated damages had not been applied on the contracts and asking whether the council\n\n  wished the architects to apply them when issuing their next interim certificates. The\n\n  judge found as fact that liquidated damages were discussed at the meeting at the Council\n\n  offices on 2 June 1977. He said, \"I do not think that Mr Halpin or anyone else,\n\n  said in terms ‘deduct liquidated damages’, but equally I do not think that\n\n  anyone objected. Doubtless everyone was content to be guided by Wigley Fox as the experts\".In all the circumstances, in our opinion\n\n  none of these submissions can be made good in this case. In the first place, the facts of\n\n  thePanamenawere very different from those of the instant case, which makes it\n\n  essential to discover the realratioof the former. In the Court of Appeal Scott LJ\n\n  based his decision first upon a term which he thought had to be implied in the contract\n\n  between the shipowners and repairers that if and when it became known to the former that\n\n  their surveyor was departing from his proper function under the contract, it then became\n\n  their duty to stop him and tell him what his function was thereunder. In failing so to\n\n  instruct their surveyor, the shipowners broke this implied undertaking and thus repudiated\n\n  the contract. Upon this the repairers could have elected to rescind and claim damages, if\n\n  they so chose; alternatively, on the principleinter aliaofHickman Co v\n\n  Roberts[1913] AC 229, \"The plaintiffs were entitled instead to treat the\n\n  defendants as preventing the performance of the term in question, and also in waiving it\n\n  as a condition precedent to the plaintiffs’ right to sue on the [Ministry]\n\n  certificate\": per Scott LJ at p124. Goddard LJ also effectively based his decision on\n\n  a breach of an implied term when he said at p 127:\"It is and must be conceded that if a\n\n    party desires to rely on the non-performance of a condition precedent he must do nothing\n\n    to prevent the condition being performed, and if there is anything that must be done by\n\n    him to render possible the performance of the condition, a failure by him to do what is\n\n    required disentitles him from insisting on performance of the condition.\"In the House of Lords, Lord Thankerton,\n\n  with whose speech the rest of the House concurred, expressly agreed with this view of\n\n  Goddard LJ, and, quoting from the judgment of Blackburn J inRoberts v Bury Improvement\n\n  Commissioners(1870) LR 5 CP 310, said (at [1947] AC 436):\"It is a principle very well\n\n    established at common law, that no person can take advantage of the non-fulfilment of a\n\n    condition the performance of which has been hindered by himself.\"Whether or not the jurisprudential basis\n\n  for this well established common law principle is, as we think it is, the presumed\n\n  implication of a term in the relevant contract similar to that referred to by Scott LJ in\n\n  his judgment in the Court of Appeal in thePanamena, on the facts of the instant\n\n  case as we have outlined them,there was no question of the SPDC ever having hindered\n\n  the architect from giving an interim certificatewhich properly complied with clause\n\n  30(1) and (2) of the building contract.’[Emphasis added.]148.    Therefore May LJ considered that it was the prevention principle\n\nthat led to the decision inPanamena.149.InLubenham, the mere fact\n\nthat the owners had remained silent in the face of the certificates was not sufficient to\n\ninvoke the prevention principle. I have already referred to p.56 of May LJ’s judgment\n\nwhere he cited the judge’s conclusion that everyone was content to be guided by the\n\narchitects.150.    Then at p.58, May LJ said:‘The truth of the matter is that the\n\n  certificates took precisely the form which the architects erroneously, but in the exercise\n\n  of their independent judgment, thought they should take. And as the judge observed,\n\n  doubtless the council were content to be guided by Wigley Fox as the experts. Such\n\n  acquiescence on the part of the council did not, in our opinion, suffice to expose it to\n\n  liability to pay the sums higher than those specified in the two interim certificates in\n\n  accordance withPanamenaprinciples.’C.A. No 85 of 1999151.    As I have mentioned, it was Mr Teh’s alternative argument\n\nthat an owner is obliged to supervise the architect/certifier only if the owner knows that\n\nthe architect/ certifier is not discharging his function properly. Mr Teh referred not\n\nonly toPanamenaandPerinifor this proposition but also to paragraphs 43\n\nand 44 of the judgment in C.A. No 85 of 1999 which state:‘43. We entirely agree with the\n\n  learned judge that the employer could be liable for the default of the architect in\n\n  issuing the interim certificates but only if the employer was aware of such default. This\n\n  proposition of law is amply supported by authorities:Frederick Leyland & Co Ltd v\n\n  Panamena Europea Navigacion[1943] 76 Lloyd’s Rep 113 andPerini Corporation v\n\n  Commonwealth of Australia(1969) 12 BLR 82. The pre-requisite of knowledge is\n\n  essential before an employer is required to act to ensure that his architect complies with\n\n  the terms of the building agreement between the employer and the contractor. The standard\n\n  works on the subject have also reiterated this principle, e.g. Hudson on Building &\n\n  Engineering Contracts, Emden on Construction Law and Keating on Building Contracts.44. The rationale for this rule is\n\n  obviously to take into account the special position of the architect in a building\n\n  contract, even though he is employed and paid by the employer. When an architect acts as a\n\n  certifier under a building contract for interim payments, he is to act fairly and\n\n  impartially between the parties, and the employer is not to interfere with the\n\n  architect’s exercise of this function. The arbitrator, in fact, recognised this point\n\n  in his award. Such functions of the architect, among others, must be exercised by him\n\n  independently as an expert. It would be unreasonable to expect a lay employer to warrant\n\n  the performance of the architect in respect of such functions without establishing that\n\n  the employer knew the architect had gone wrong:Lubenham Fidelities and Investments Co\n\n  Ltd v South Pembrokeshire District Council & Anor(1986) 33 BLR 39 at 58.’152.    Mr Teh suggested that the Court of Appeal had already determined\n\nthe extent of the duty of the Appellants vis--vis the Architect as certifier. Mr Chung\n\nsubmitted likewise except that he argued that paragraph 43 of the judgment was applicable\n\nto function (b) but not to function (a).153.    In my view, the Court of Appeal did\n\nnot determine the extent of the duty of the Appellants vis--vis the Architect as\n\ncertifier. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was for leave to appeal to the High Court on\n\ncertain questions which the Court of Appeal eventually summarised into one question. That\n\nquestion is set out in paragraph 55 of its judgment and reiterated in paragraph 8 above.154.    In deciding whether to grant such\n\nleave, the Court of Appeal had to assess the prospects of success of the appeal if leave\n\nto appeal was granted. This it did between paragraphs 39 to 50 of its judgment. Therefore,\n\nparagraphs 43 and 44 of its judgment must be read in this context.155.    As for paragraph 50 of the judgment\n\nof the Court of Appeal, this was cited by Mr Teh for his first argument that there is no\n\nimplied obligation on an owner to marshall its architect. Paragraph 50 states:‘…. In passing we should mention\n\n  that inLubenham, May LJ stated (at p 58) that where the building contract\n\n  contained a very wide arbitration clause which expressly permitted arbitration upon\n\n  interim certificates during the currency of the contract and before practical completion:-\"…. We do not think that there\n\n  is any need or scope for the implication of any further term in it, as there was in thePanamena.\n\n  If, as is now common ground, the two challenged interim certificates in our case were not\n\n  in accordance with the terms of the building contract, there was one simple remedy\n\n  available toLubenhamneeding no implied term, namely to go to arbitration upon\n\n  them and have them corrected.\" ’156.    This paragraph must also be read in the context that the Court\n\nof Appeal was making tentative observations only in assessing the prospects of success of\n\nthe appeal.157.    Furthermore, the passage cited from\n\nMay LJ’s judgment pertained to his alternative reason for his decision. The entire\n\nparagraph in May LJ’s judgment reads:‘Alternatively, in so far as the\n\n  implication of any term into the contract in the instant case is concerned, there is in\n\n  our opinion one fundamental difference between such contract and the one under\n\n  consideration in thePanamena. This is the presence in the contract which we have\n\n  to consider of the very wide arbitration clause 35 which expressly permitted arbitration\n\n  upon interim certificates during the currency of the contract and before practical\n\n  completion. There was no arbitration clause at all in the contract before the courts in\n\n  thePanamena. In the light of the arbitration clause in the instant contract, we do\n\n  not think that there is any need or scope for the implication of any further term in it,\n\n  as there was in thePanamena. If, as is now common ground, the two challenged\n\n  interim certificates in our case were not in accordance with the terms of the building\n\n  contract, there was one simple remedy available toLubenhamneeding no implied\n\n  term, namely to go to arbitration upon them and have them corrected.’158.    One of the issues inLubenham, as was inPanamena,\n\nwas whether the contractor or repairer was entitled to recover the monies due to them in\n\nan action before the court, notwithstanding the absence of a certificate.159.    The absence or presence of an\n\narbitration provision was therefore important in these two cases. InPanamenathere was no arbitration provision whereas inLubenhamthere was.160.    InLubenham, the\n\narbitration provision allowed arbitration on interim certificates during the currency of\n\nthe contract. This therefore meant that the contractor could have proceeded to arbitration\n\nfirst to have the certificates corrected.161.    In the appeal before me, the issue\n\nis not whether the Respondents are entitled to recover in an action before the court the\n\nmonies due to it in the absence of a certificate as apparently the certificates were\n\neventually issued, although they were allegedly delayed. The claim was for interest for\n\nloss of use of the monies and was first made in the arbitration proceedings. Accordingly,\n\nthe presence of an arbitration provision in the Conditions of Building Contract would not\n\nbe material to the question before me.Textbooks162.    Emden’s Construction Law Issue 56/June 1999 at p.II 274 to\n\n275 states:‘CLiability of employer when his\n\n  agent wrongly withholds approval[992]1 Implied terms in contractWhether an architect or other\n\n  certifier owes a duty to the contractor if he negligently or indeed wilfully withholds an\n\n  approval or certificate is discussed elsewhere. When the certifier is the agent or servant\n\n  of the employer one might think vicarious liability would follow, but the position is\n\n  complicated by the fact that the certifier is under a duty to act fairly, which in turn\n\n  implies that the employer is not to interfere with the exercise of his functions. It can\n\n  hardly be right to infer liability in the circumstancessimpliciter, and this has\n\n  been recognised. Instead the employer will be held liable if either:(i) he improperly interferes with the\n\n    certificate; or(ii) If attracted to the fact that the\n\n    certifier is not discharging his functions properly he fails to take steps to correct or\n\n    replace him;(iii) when the certifier retires or ceases\n\n    to act, he fails to replace him.….As to (ii) above, see the judgments of the\n\n  Court of Appeal inFrederick Leyland & Co Ltd v Panamena Europea Navigacion.Scott LJ said:\"I am of the opinion that they [the\n\n    employers] were under a contractual duty to keep their surveyor straight on the scope of\n\n    what I metaphorically called his \"jurisdiction\" by which I do not mean that he\n\n    was in any sense an arbitrator, but only that as an expert entrusted with the duty of\n\n    impartiality within a certain sphere he had to form his opinion with judicial independence\n\n    within that sphere. It follows from my premises that in failing to inform Dr Telfer that\n\n    he was going outside and away from the limits of his function, they broke their implied\n\n    undertaking.\"Similarly inPerini Corpn v\n\n  Commonwealth of Australia, a term was implied, that the employer would ensure that the\n\n  certifier performed his duties in accordance with the contract. InCroudace v London\n\n  Borough of Lambeththe contractor submitted a claim for loss and expense, under JCT\n\n  1963, clause 24. The architect retired and no new one was appointed. The contractor was\n\n  awarded damages representing the loss and expense that should have been ascertained,\n\n  despite the absence of a certificate, on the basis that the employer had failed to take\n\n  such steps as were necessary to enable the plaintiffs claim for loss and expense to be\n\n  ascertained. In normal cases the contractor will use the remedy of a damages claim to\n\n  circumvent the absence of a certificate and the amount claimed, though technically damages\n\n  will in reality represent the amount for which a certificate should have been issued.\n\n  This, of course, may not necessarily be the case. For example, if a certificate is wrongly\n\n  withheld the contractor may suffer damage for which he would not be reimbursed at all\n\n  under the contract. This will be recoverable if not too remote.’163.    These paragraphs refer toPanamenaandPeriniand\n\ntoCroudaceand suggest that there is an implied duty on the part of the owner to\n\ncorrect the architect if the architect defaults as certifier, but the owner must be aware\n\nof the default.164.    I have already expressed my views\n\nonPanamenaandPerini.Croudacewas a situation on different facts\n\nfrom those before me. There the architect had retired and there was no one to issue the\n\ncertificate. Also, the question there was whether the contractor was entitled to be paid\n\ndespite the absence of a certificate.165.    I find further support for my views\n\nin Emden’s Construction Law Issue 56/June 1999 at p. II 275 (which comes soon after\n\nthe part which I have cited in paragraph 162 above):‘2 The architect’s duty of\n\n  impartialityWhen issuing certificates the\n\n  architect or other certifieris not acting as the employer’s agentbut must\n\n  form andact on his own opinion. That being so, he is bound to act independently;\n\n  it is his duty to hear what both parties (ie employer and contractor) have to say and if\n\n  he gives opportunity to one side he should give equal opportunity to the other. Moreover,\n\n  he must act impartially.He will not be acting impartially if he allows the employer to\n\n  interfere with his independent judgment when issuing certificates.’[Emphasis added.]166.    As for Hudson’s, there are passages like paragraphs 4200\n\nto 4201 and paragraph 6132 which refer to bothPanamenaandPerinifor\n\nthe suggestion that there is a positive duty on the owner to ensure that a certifier\n\nperforms his functions correctly and to give instructions to a certifier who is not\n\nfulfilling his mandate correctly.167.    For example, I cite paragraph\n\n4200:‘4200 It has been seen that an\n\n  owner give no warranty to the contractor as to the adequacy of the A/E’s design. Nor\n\n  does he warrant the A/E’s competence in performing the A/E’s certifying or\n\n  discretionary functions during the supervisory stage of the contract. However, not only\n\n  does the owner owe the contractor a negative duty not to interfere with the A/E in those\n\n  cases where the latter is required by the contract to act fairly as between the parties\n\n  and exercise his own judgment, butit has also been held that the owner owes the\n\n  contractor an affirmative duty, in a case where, to the owner’s knowledge, the\n\n  architect is failing to perform his function at all, or is going outside his proper terms\n\n  of reference or taking into account extraneous considerations not warranted by the\n\n  contract,to use his best endeavours to see to it that the A/E does carry out the\n\n  required functions properly.[Emphasis added.]168.    The passage from Scott LJ’s judgment inPanamenawas\n\nthen referred to andPeriniwas also referred to.169.    Mr Chung relied on another passage\n\nfrom Hudson’s at para 6145 which was supposed to say,‘the nature of the duty on the part\n\n  of the employer is a positive duty to monitor the certification functions of the\n\n  architect.’170.    However, upon inquiry by me, Mr Chung said that he had quoted\n\nHudson’s incorrectly. The actual passage reads:‘Theremayalso be a positive\n\n  duty to give instructions to the certifier to ensure his proper discharge of his function\n\n  …’[Emphasis added.]It goes on to say:‘Thus, in thePanamenacase,\n\n  where the certifier had, on his own initiative, taken a wrong view of his terms of\n\n  reference and refused a certificate for that reason, the prevention principle was again in\n\n  the forefront of Lord Thankerton’s speech in the House of Lords, and, indeed,\n\n  implicit in Goddard L.J.’s judgment in the Court of Appeal, quoted in paragraph (f)infra,\n\n  and expressly approved on this point by Lord Thankerton. Unconsidered application of the\n\n  prevention principle to very different situations may serve to distract attention from a\n\n  closer analysis of the certifier’s own conduct as the reason for avoiding the\n\n  certificate requirement. In thePanamenacase there was as it happened, a close\n\n  identity of interest between the surveyor and the owners.’171.    Furthermore, there are other passages in Hudson’s which\n\nstate that while there will be an implied term that the architect will be independent and\n\nimpartial, there is no warranty as to his competence or that he will act reasonably, see\n\nparagraphs 6097, 6112 to 6113 of Hudson’s.172.    For example, I cite paragraphs\n\n6112 to 6113:‘6112 Given the\n\n  \"quasi-arbitral\" nature of the certifier’s function, there must be an\n\n  implied term that both parties will do nothing to prevent a true and unfettered exercise\n\n  of his powers when certifying. Thus when discussing \"the influencing of\n\n  certifiers\" Devlin J. said:\"The main test appears to be whether\n\n    the certificate is intended to embody a decision that is final and binding on the parties.\n\n    If it is, it is in effect an award, and it has the attributes of its arbitral character.\n\n    It cannot be attached on the ground that it is unreasonable, as the opinion of the party\n\n    or the certificate of one who is merely an agent probably can. On the other hand, it must\n\n    be made independently, for independence is the essence of the arbitral function. If two\n\n    parties agree to appoint an arbitrator … it would be, I think, implied in the\n\n    contract in order to give it business efficacy that neither side would seek to interfere\n\n    with his independence. If a party to a contract is permitted to appoint his agent to act\n\n    as arbitrator in respect of certain matters under the contract a similar term must be\n\n    implied; but it is modified by the fact that a man who has to act as arbitrator in respect\n\n    of some matter, and as servant or agent in respect of others, cannot remain as detached as\n\n    a pure arbitrator should be.\"276113 It will be seen that the cases\n\n  rightly distinguish between the functions and principal obligations of the owner, where\n\n  the owner will warrant due performance of those obligations by the A/E acting as his agent\n\n  or alter ego on the one hand, and the A/E’s certifying or discretionary functions on\n\n  the other where no such warranty is given:\"To the extent that the architect\n\n    performs these [principal] duties the building owner contracts with the contractor that\n\n    the architect will perform them with reasonable diligence and with reasonable skill and\n\n    care. The contract also confers on the architect discretionary powers which he must\n\n    exercise with due regard to the interest of the contractor and the building owner. The\n\n    building owner does not undertake that the architect will exercise his discretionary\n\n    powers reasonably;he undertakes that although the architect may be engaged or employed\n\n    by him he will leave him free to exercise his discretions fairly and without improper\n\n    interference by him.\"28Similarly, in a case where a contract left\n\n  a choice of working methods to an engineer, Diplock J. said:\"His decision as to whether one\n\n    method or another is satisfactory to him must, of course, be an honest one, but it does\n\n    not seem to me that the Corporation warrants competency or skill, or warrant that his\n\n    decision shall be reasonable.\"29’173.    The authorities for footnotes 27 to 29 are:‘27Minister Trust Ltd\n\n  v. Traps Tractors Ltd. [1954] 1 W.L.R. 963, at p.97428London Borough of Merton\n\n  v. Leach(1985) 32 BLR 51, at p.78perVinelott J.29Neodox Ltd v. Swinton\n\n  & Pendlebury Borough Council(1958) 5 BLR 34, at p.47’174.    Mr Chung also cited two sentences from the textbook, The\n\nMalaysian Standard Form of Building Contract (1990) by Professor Vincent Powell Smith.175.    At p.144, it states,‘The architect’s failure to\n\n  issue interim certificates is a breach of contract for which the employer is liable.’176.    At p.151, it states,‘The issue of the final certificate\n\n  is mandatory and failure to issue it within the time and the manner specified is a breach\n\n  of contract for which the employer is liable.’177.    However no authority was cited to support these sentences which\n\nwere in any event vague. If the sentences are meant to suggest that a contractor may be\n\nentitled to payment notwithstanding the absence of an interim or the final certificate, I\n\nam in agreement with them. However if the sentences are meant to suggest that an owner is\n\nobliged to tell the architect what to do and to ensure that the architect carries out his\n\ncertifying function, I would disagree for the reasons I have mentioned.Particular wording of Clause 30178.    Clause 30(1) of the Conditions of Building Contract states:‘30(1) At the period of Interim\n\n  Certificates named in the appendix to these Conditions, the Architectshallissue a\n\n  certificate ….’[Emphasis added.]179.    Mr Chung further submitted that this meant that it was mandatory\n\nfor the Architect to issue the certificates and that the Appellants had warranted to the\n\nRespondents that the Architect would issue the Interim Certificates on time. He argued\n\nthat the Architect was the alter ego of the Appellants. Presumably Mr Chung intended this\n\nsubmission to apply to other certificates mentioned in Clause 30(4)(b) and (c) and 30(6)\n\nas well where similar words had been used.180.    I am of the view that Mr\n\nChung’s submission based on the words in these various provisions is not valid. The\n\nprovisions may require the Architect to issue various certificates at various times but\n\nthey do not render the Appellants liable for the Architect’s obligation. Although the\n\nArchitect is not a party to the contract, the provisions make clear what is expected of\n\nhim. Furthermore, for reasons which I have mentioned already, the Architect, as certifier,\n\nis not the agent nor is he the alter ego of the Appellants.181.    In addition, the Re-Amended Points\n\nof Claim does not rely on the particular words in the provisions but on an implied term.Other points182.    I should mention some other points.When the Interim Certificates should\n\nhave been issued183.    Under the Conditions of Contract, the interim certificates were\n\nto be issued monthly. There is no provision stating when such issuance should start and\n\nwhether the interim certificates should be issued at the beginning or at the end of each\n\nmonth.184.    What the Respondents did was to\n\nuse 2 February 1979 as the date when the first interim certificate should have been issued\n\nand then it used the 2ndof every consecutive month thereafter as the due date\n\nwhen each interim certificate should have been issued. The date of 2 February 1979 was\n\nshortly after the date of the Contract which was 27 January 1979. Mr Chung was not able to\n\nexplain why 2 February 1979 should be the correct starting date for the interim\n\ncertificates to be issued.185.    Based on the approach I have\n\nmentioned, the Respondents had alleged that the Architect had been late in issuing many\n\ninterim certificates whereas if a different starting date was used, the interim\n\ncertificates issued might not have been late or might not be as late as alleged.186.    In addition, there was the question\n\nwhether the duty of the Architect to issue the interim certificates was premised on an\n\nimplied term that the Respondents must submit detailed progress claims for the Architect\n\nto make his decision. Mr Chung accepted that it was the practice in the industry for a\n\ncontractor to submit progress claims for the architect to issue interim certificates but\n\nhe submitted that there was no obligation on a contractor to do so. He submitted that an\n\narchitect must issue an interim certificate on the same day every month even if an\n\narchitect did not have sufficient information to issue the certificate or no work was\n\ndone. In those events, he submitted that an architect could issue an interim certificate\n\nshowing no amount payable to the contractor for the month but an interim certificate had\n\nto be issued nevertheless.187.    Mr Chung further submitted that if\n\nthe issuance of the interim certificates was to be conditional upon the contractor\n\nsubmitting detailed progress claims then this must be specifically provided for in the\n\ncontract as was the case inChina Construction (South Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd\n\nv Leisure Park (Singapore) Pte Ltd[2000] 1 SLR 622. However I note that that case\n\ndoes not decide the position when there is no specific term to that effect. I would have\n\nthought that it would be an implied term that the issuance of the interim certificates was\n\nto be conditional upon the contractor submitting detailed progress claims as an architect\n\ndoes not issue interim certificates in a vacuum.Does an architect, as certifier, owe a\n\nduty of care to the contractor?188.    Mr Chung submitted that if an owner is not liable for the\n\narchitect’s default, where the architect acts as a certifier, then a contractor may\n\nhave no recourse at all for the situation where certificates have been issued, but issued\n\nlate. He cited the case ofPacific Associates v Baxter[1990] 1 QB 993 for the\n\nproposition that a certifier will not be liable in negligence to the contractor.189.    On the other hand, Mr Teh argued\n\nthat that case should be confined to its particular facts.190.    Whether that case should be\n\nconfined to its particular facts or not, I note that the English courts are less inclined\n\nto find a duty of care for pure economic loss. See alsoD&F Estates Ltd & Ors v\n\nChurch Commissions for England & Ors(1989) AC 177 andMurphy v Brentwood\n\nDistrict Council(1990) 2 All ER 908.191.    However, the position in Singapore\n\nis different. For example, inRSP Architects Planners & Engineers v Ocean Front Pte\n\nLtd[1996] 1 SLR 113, the Court of Appeal decided that a developer does owe a duty of\n\ncare to a Management Corporation to avoid pure economic loss. The Court of Appeal found\n\nthat there was a sufficient degree of proximity between the developer and the management\n\ncorporation in view of various factors. One of the factors was that the developer knew or\n\nought to have known that negligence in the construction of the common property would have\n\nto be made good by the management corporation.192.    InRSP Architects Planners &\n\nEngineers (Raglan Squire & Partners FE) v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No\n\n1075 & Anor[1999] 2 SLR 449, the Court of Appeal also decided that architects owe\n\na duty of care to a Management Corporation to avoid pure economic loss. Here, the Court of\n\nAppeal found that the architects knew that the management corporation would depend on the\n\narchitects’ care and skill. The element of reliance by the management corporation on\n\nthe architects was present.193.    I think that a strong argument can\n\nbe made that an architect/certifier does owe a duty of care not only to the owner but also\n\nto the contractor to avoid pure economic loss. An architect must know that both intend to\n\nrely on his fairness as well as his skill and judgment as a certifier, as was mentioned inJones v St John’s CollegeLR 6 QB and cited inKempster, (see paragraph\n\n92 above). See also the judgment of Bowen LJ inJackson v Barry Railway Co(1893) 1\n\nCh 238 at p.247 which was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal inNelson Carlton\n\nConstructionat p.150 and 153. The architect must also know that if he is negligent in\n\nissuing certificates he might cause loss to one of these parties.194.    On the other hand, it may be argued\n\nthat because an architect as certifier is often considered as exercising a quasi-arbitral\n\nor quasi-judicial function, he should owe no duty of care to the contractor when he\n\nexercises that function.195.    I need say no more on this point as\n\nit is not necessary for me to decide whether an architect, as certifier, owes a duty of\n\ncare to the contractor.Contractual interest196.    On another point, it is up to the industry to consider whether\n\nthe standard conditions should provide for contractual interest to be paid by an owner for\n\nlate issue of certificates by an architect not because the owner is entitled to tell the\n\narchitect what to do but because the owner has had the benefit of paying later.My Determination197.    The question posed by the Court of Appeal was regarding the\n\nduties of the Appellants in relation to the certifying functions of the Architect. I\n\ndetermine the question in the context of the claims as follows:(a)    The Appellants have an implied duty\n\n  not to interfere with the discharge of the Architect’s duty.(b)    The Appellants have an implied duty\n\n  to do all things reasonably necessary to enable the Architect to discharge its duty\n\n  properly. However, such an implied duty does not require the Appellants to order or tell\n\n  the Architect what to do.(c)    Consequently, even if the Architect\n\n  had failed to issue various certificates on time, or over-certified the retention sum, the\n\n  Appellants are not liable for the Architect’s default, if any, even if the Appellants\n\n  were aware of such defaults. Should I be incorrect on this point, and the Appellants are\n\n  liable provided they are aware of such defaults, it is for the Respondents to plead and\n\n  prove such awareness which they did not do.(d)    Therefore, the Appellants are not\n\n  liable for interest if the Respondents received various sums of monies late by reason of\n\n  the Architect’s default.198.    In the circumstances, I allow the Appeal to the extent that the\n\nArbitrator’s award in respect of the first part of Item (a) and in respect of Items\n\n(b) to (d) is set aside199.    I will hear the parties on the\n\nquestion of costs.Woo Bih LiJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
