        "Facts": "The plaintiff and the two defendants are brothers. In 1965, the father\n\nof the parties founded Sin Wah Seng, a partnership firm (\"the firm\"). When he\n\ndied in 1979, the running of the firm was passed on to the parties. Following\n\ndisagreements, the defendants applied in December 1999 for an order to dissolve the firm\n\nand appoint receivers and managers over its assets and liabilities. This was discontinued\n\nafter they served a notice of dissolution of the partnership on 11 February 2000. On 7\n\nApril 2000, the plaintiff applied to appoint two named receivers and managers to realise\n\nthe partnership properties. On 7 June 2000, TQ Lim JC (\"Lim JC\") granted the\n\nplaintiff’s application.Subsequently, as a result of the alleged inability of the receivers to\n\ndetermine the shares of the partners in six of the seven properties, the plaintiff applied\n\nby way of a summons-in-chambers pursuant to Lim JC’s \"liberty to apply\"\n\norder for an order that the court declare that the firm is a sole proprietorship. As its\n\nsole proprietor, he claimed that he was entitled to ownership over all the properties\n\nagainst the claims of the defendants. In addition, he also prayed for an order to\n\ndischarge the receivers, and for a declaratory order that the defendants were holding on\n\nresulting trust the seven pieces of property, and that they be ordered to transfer title\n\nto him.",
        "Held": ", dismissing the application:(1) The \"liberty to apply\" order is a judicial device\n\nintended to supplement the main orders in form and convenience only so that the main\n\norders may be carried out; Cristel v Cristel [1951] 2 KB 725 (folld). Within its ambit,\n\nerrors and omissions which do not affect the substance of the main orders may be corrected\n\nor augmented, but nothing must be done to vary or change the nature or substance of the\n\nmain orders. The variation of orders is governed by other rules. What amounts to a\n\nvariation depends on the context of the individual case. Even if parties apply by consent\n\nto vary the original order under a \"liberty to apply\" order, where substantial\n\nchanges are made to the original order or main orders, the proper mode and procedure must\n\nbe adopted (see  4, 5).(2) In the proceedings leading to Lim JC’s order, the plaintiff\n\nhad used unequivocal language in the documents and proceeded before Lim JC on the basis\n\nthat the firm was a partnership. Notwithstanding his present contentions with some of the\n\nfacts, the matters deposed in his March affidavit contained matters which he knew or ought\n\nto have known before the application to Lim JC was made. The plaintiff could not now\n\nassert that the firm was in fact a sole proprietorship. In any case, a \"liberty to\n\napply\" order was not the right avenue to proceed on and the orders sought were not\n\nminor improvements (see  6).(3) On the prayer to discharge the receivers, it was noted that no\n\naffidavit was received from the receivers and managers stating the problems, if any, that\n\nrequire correction by adjudication. In any case, the ambit of their work was to realise\n\nonly the partnership properties and if there was any doubt as to whether property belonged\n\nto the partnership, they should seek legal advice. However, the properties in question\n\nhave been in existence for years and were not unknown to the parties. In fact, it was\n\nincomprehensible that the parties did not think that the ownership of these properties\n\nwould be an issue when the orders of Lim JC were sought. In any case, the current\n\napplication under a \"liberty to apply\" order was not the appropriate forum to\n\nunravel these disputes (see  7).",
        "Case(s) referred to": "Cristel v Cristel [1951] 2 KB 725, [1951] 2 All ER 574 (folld)Bairstow and Ors v Queen’s Moat Houses plc, 19 Sept 1997 (unreported) (refd)Tan Yeow Khoon & Anorv Tan Yeow Tat (No. 2)[2000] 3 SLR 323(refd)JudgmentGROUNDS OF DECISION1. This is an application by the plaintiff who is the brother of the\n\ntwo defendants. The undisputed facts from the Originating Summons and supporting\n\naffidavits appear to be as follows (the word ‘appear’ is a necessary description\n\nbecause of the curious nature of this application). The parties were partners in a\n\npartnership firm known as Sin Wah Seng. This firm was founded in 1965 by Mr. Koh Sim, the\n\nfather of the parties. The principal business of the firm was that of a hardware retailer.\n\nMr. Koh Sim died in 1979 and his three sons carried on the business as the remaining\n\npartners. Disagreements arose between the plaintiff and his two brothers and the\n\nplaintiff’s two brothers applied by way of an Originating Summons (Originating\n\nSummons No. 1930 of 1999) in December 1999 for a court order to dissolve the partnership\n\nand the appointment of receivers and managers over its assets and liabilities. Shortly\n\nthereafter, on 11 February 2000, the defendants served a notice of dissolution of the\n\npartnership on the plaintiff and followed that by an application to amend Originating\n\nSummons No. 1930 of 1999 by the addition of a fresh prayer for a declaration that the firm\n\nwas dissolved on 11 February 2000. However, when this application came up for hearing, the\n\ndefendants (the plaintiffs in Originating Summons No. 1930 of 1999) withdrew their\n\napplication and filed a notice of discontinuance of Originating Summons No. 1930 of 1999\n\non 6 April 2000. On the next day, 7 April 2000, the plaintiff filed this Originating\n\nSummons praying for an order appointing Mr. Timothy Reid and Mr. Chan Kek Teck as\n\nreceivers and managers of the partnership. The application was granted by Judicial\n\nCommissioner TQ Lim on 7 June 2000.2. The plaintiff now applies by way of a summons-in-chambers for\n\nvarious orders including an order declaring that the firm (Sin Wah Seng) was a sole\n\nproprietorship and that the plaintiff was the sole proprietor. It also prayed for an order\n\ndischarging the receivers and managers, but more substantially, for orders declaring seven\n\npieces of property to be held in resulting trust by the defendants for the plaintiff and\n\nthat they be made to transfer the legal title over these properties to the plaintiff. Mr.\n\nPillai appearing for the plaintiff stated that this present application is made under the\n\n\"liberty to apply\" order of JC Lim of 7 June 2000. From the facts that I have\n\nstated above this application before me seems to be most unusual. But I must delve further\n\ninto the details because they are material to my decision. First, the plaintiff's prayers\n\nin this Originating Summons were made on his assumption that the entity in which he wishes\n\nto have the court appoint receivers and managers over was a partnership. Furthermore, he\n\nfiled a supporting affidavit to this Originating Summons on 15 April 2000 and in  2 of\n\nthat affidavit he emphatically affirmed as follows: \"I am one of the three partners\n\nand manager of the former partnership known as Sin Wah Seng. The other two partners are my\n\nbrothers Koh Hua Leong and Koh Yew Huat.\" He went on to give a brief history of the\n\npartnership (as he called it). In  3 of the same affidavit he accepted that \"the\n\npartnership was dissolved on 11 February 2000 when both [the defendants] served upon me\n\ntheir respective notice setting forth their explicit intention to dissolve the\n\npartnership\". He continued in the next paragraph to say that he had been advised that\n\npursuant to s 32(1)(c) of the Partnership Act, Ch 391 the partnership is deemed to be\n\ndissolved. This was the deposition that the plaintiff himself relied upon for a court\n\norder appointing receivers and managers overthe partnership(his phrase).3. The two defendants filed a joint affidavit which did not challenge\n\nthe facts although they challenged the appointment of Reid and Chan as the proposed\n\nreceivers and managers. The defendants, however, made a serious allegation against the\n\nplaintiff in their affidavit. They say that the firm's records as well as the report of an\n\naccountant commissioned to review the records, show that the plaintiff, who was managing\n\nthe partnership by himself at all material times, had purchased and registered various\n\nproperties in his own name. This affidavit was filed on 12 May 2000. The plaintiff\n\nresponded merely by amending the Originating Summons on 1 June 2000 to the effect that the\n\nreceivers and managers be ordered to sell the partnership properties by auction, private\n\ncontract, or tender as they may think fit. No further affidavit was filed and on 7 June\n\n2000 JC TQ Lim made his orders. It was not recorded as a consent order but the record\n\nshows that no resistance was put up by the defendants. I think it fair to conclude that\n\nhad the plaintiff asserted that he was the sole proprietor of Sin Wah Seng the defendants\n\nwould undoubtedly have protested as that was not the case they were supposed to meet. In\n\nthe event, costs of the action was ordered against the defendants in these terms:\n\n\"The costs of this application be fixed at $1,500 to be paid by the defendants to the\n\nplaintiff on the footing that the costs is to be an expense of the partnership advanced by\n\nthe defendants\".4. The matter appeared to have ended there but for the alleged\n\ninability of the receivers to determine the shares of the partners in six of the seven\n\nproperties. Arising from the impasse, the plaintiff made this application with the view of\n\nhaving the court declare that he was the sole proprietor of the firm. The idea was\n\nobviously to assert ownership over all the properties in their entirety against the claims\n\nof the defendants. It is important at this point to examine the correctness of the\n\napproach taken by the plaintiff, namely, to plead the present prayers by means of a\n\nsummons-in-chambers under the cover of the \"liberty to apply\" order.\n\nNotwithstanding the English authority of reasonably longstanding, that is,Christel v\n\nChristel[1951] 2 KB 725 and the more recent affirmation of the judicial statement\n\ntherein by the High Court in England inBairstow and Ors v Queen's Moat Houses plc,\n\n19 Sep 1997 (unreported) and here inTan Yeow Khoon and Anor v Tan Yeow Tat and Anor(No. 2)[2000] 3 SLR 323, the \"liberty to apply\" order seems to remain poorly\n\nunderstood. The important statement of Somervell LJ in theChristelcase was,\n\n\"…prima faciethe words ‘liberty to apply’ refer, in my\n\nopinion, to the working out of the actual terms of the order\". Or, as Denning LJ in\n\nthe same case said, \"It can only do what is necessary to carry the agreement into\n\neffect\". The issue in theChristelcase arose in this way. A consent order\n\npermitted the husband to possession of the matrimonial house then occupied by his wife and\n\nchildren as soon as he has provided an alternative house or bungalow. The husband procured\n\na flat instead and then asked to vary the consent order under the \"liberty to\n\napply\" order so as to add the words \"or flat\" after \"house or\n\nbungalow\" in the main order. The Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the consent\n\norder cannot be varied under a \"liberty to apply\" order.5. In my view, the \"liberty to apply\" order, which is really,\n\na judicial device not dissimilar to its procedural cousin the \"slip rule\", is\n\nintended to supplement the main orders in form and convenience only so that the main\n\norders may be carried out. To this end, errors and omissions that do not affect the\n\nsubstance of the main orders may be corrected or augmented, but nothing must be done to\n\nvary or change the nature or substance of the main orders because the variation of orders\n\nare governed by other rules, depending on the context of the individual case. For example,\n\nin a matrimonial matter, the court may have no power to vary unless there is a change of\n\ncircumstances, or if it was made with the consent of the other party. It is true that\n\nsometimes solicitors may be confused as to the ambit of a \"liberty to apply\"\n\norder. There are, in my view, two main reasons for this. First, as I have just said, what\n\namounts to a supplemental order to give effect to the main orders can only be appreciated\n\nin the context of the individual case. Thus, what appears to be a further order to give\n\neffect to the original order in one case may appear as a variation in a different context.\n\nSecondly, parties often, by consent, apply for a variation of the original order under a\n\n\"liberty to apply\" order. But where substantial changes are intended to be made\n\nto the original or main orders the proper mode and procedure must be adopted. An\n\napplication under a \"liberty to apply\" order is, therefore, not the way. This\n\npresent case before me is a clear example of why that is so.6. Here, an application was made by the plaintiff just over two years\n\nago to appoint receivers and managers over an entity which he regards as a partnership in\n\nwhich he asserted that the defendants were the other partners. He also asked for an order\n\nthat the receivers and managers be authorised to realise, sell or otherwise dispose of the\n\npartnership properties. His prayers were granted. Now, he says that what was declared by\n\nhim, and accepted by the other parties and the court to be a partnership, was in fact a\n\nsole proprietorship. His case before me hinges on two premises. First, that things may not\n\nbe what they seem; that is, labels such as 'sole proprietorship' and 'partnership' mean\n\nnothing unless judicially tested. Secondly, in this case, there has been no judicial\n\npronouncement that Sin Wah Seng was indeed a partnership, and it follows therefore that\n\nthe issue is at large. By themselves, both premises are sound and solid. They are as solid\n\nas bones are, but the flesh that the plaintiff hopes to put around these bones have\n\nalready putrefied. Some aspects of the flaws of this application seem elementary and\n\nobvious. How is it that a man who had carried on a business for several decades with his\n\nbrothers, and had taken them to court on the basis that they were his partners, now\n\nsuddenly realise that he was the sole proprietor? In his affidavit of 12 March 2002 the\n\nplaintiff sought to explain by reciting the history of the firm's registration back in\n\n1965. It is a long tale that hardly recalls anything that was not known to him at the time\n\nJC Lim made his orders. I am, however, mindful that the plaintiff alleges that he did not\n\nknow that his father had made one of his brothers a partner in the firm. In any event, it\n\nwould be most unlikely that his solicitors would have advised him to proceed with this\n\nOriginating Summons and entered judgment on the terms set out had he made known his\n\nassertions to them that he does now. The statements found in his March affidavit indicate\n\nclearly that the matters deposed there are matters he knew or ought to have known before\n\nJC Lim's orders were made, including the assertion that he only knew that his brother\n\nbecame a partner in 1997. The point is, the assertions now made are so fundamentally\n\noppose to the basis of his application and his own declarations under oath that Sin Wah\n\nSeng was a partnership and that the defendants were his partners. To correct so\n\nfundamental a premise, the entire order of court of JC Lim must be overturned and set\n\naside and fresh pleadings be drawn up. It is not a minor improvement to be dealt with,\n\nleast of all, under a \"liberty to apply\" appendage. The present cause was\n\ntherefore irremediably lost from the outset.7. It must also be pointed out that there has been no affidavit from\n\nthe receivers and managers to state what were problems, if any, that require correction by\n\nadjudication. The receivers and managers were ordered to realise only the partnership\n\nproperties. So, if the properties belong to the partnership they must come under the ambit\n\nof the receivers’ work. If they are not, then the receivers have no business to deal\n\nwith them. The receivers and managers, acting on advice if need be, are the ones who have\n\nto make the call. If they are uncertain, they may have to seek legal advice as to what to\n\ndo. The properties in question are not unknown to the parties. They have been in existence\n\nfor years. It would not have been thought amazing that the parties dispute the ownership\n\nof these properties, but it is incredible that the parties here did not think that the\n\nownership of these properties would be an issue when the orders of JC Lim were sought.\n\nThat is a puzzle that may have yet to be solved - but not here, and not by a\n\nsummons-in-chambers under a \"liberty to apply\" order.8. For the above reasons this application is dismissed with costs to be\n\ntaxed if not agreed and paid by the plaintiff to the defendants.Sgd:Choo Han TeckJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
