The 1st, 2ndand 3rdPlaintiffs are to\n\n  indemnify the 1stand 2ndDefendants of 46% of all liabilities, including\n\n  all government taxes, levies, fees and/or charges incurred up 21 October 1998 owing to third\n\n  parties and/or government bodies by the Company and the 8thDefendants.\"The 8thDefendants referred to at the end of Clause 17 are Teng Tong.\n\nPursuant to Clause 23 of the Consent Order, the original completion date of the settlement was to be\n\n2 February 1999. This was extended by the parties subsequently to 12 April 1999. 21 October 1998 was\n\nchosen as the cut-off date for computation purposes as it was the date that active negotiations\n\ncommenced between the parties. The Defendants aggregate shareholding in KYH amounted to 46%.16 Pursuant to Clause 5, the Defendants paid $5,169,817.28 to the Plaintiffs on\n\n12 April 1999 (the completion date). The Plaintiffs were the ones who prepared the revised\n\ncompletion account.THE PLAINTIFFS CASE17 In this action, the Plaintiffs are claiming a 46% indemnity from the\n\nDefendants pursuant to Clause 17 of the Consent Order in respect of the various liabilities of KYH\n\nand of Teng Tong as at 21 October 1998 (\"the cut-off date\"). These were particularised in\n\nAnnexures A and B attached to the Statement of Claim.18 In their Reply to Defence, the Plaintiffs also averred that the share value of\n\nKYH was computed on the estimated value of its assets and that liabilities were not taken into\n\nconsideration. Accordingly, all liabilities of KYH and of Teng Tong were dealt with in Clause 17.\n\nThe payment directed by Clause 5 was expressly stated to be subject to settlement of accounts under\n\nClauses 6, 16 and 17 and the completion account under Clause 5 did not include the matters covered\n\nby Clause 17, which remained outstanding. Rental deposits (of stallholders and of tenants) in the\n\nbank accounts of KYH and of Teng Tong were treated as assets when computing the share value and\n\ntherefore remained as liabilities to be indemnified by the Defendants under Clause 17.19 The Plaintiffs relied on Chan Kwang Cheng, a Certified Public Accountant, who\n\nstated on affidavit that the items claimed by the Plaintiffs were considered liabilities in\n\naccordance with accounting principles and standards applicable to financial statements. The\n\nStatements of Accounting Standards issued by the Institute of Certified Public Accountants Singapore\n\nstated that an essential characteristic of a liability is that the enterprise has a present\n\nobligation and an obligation is a duty or responsibility to act or perform in a certain way.20 On 7 April 1999 (before the extended completion date of 12 April 1999), the\n\nparties appeared before me for the purpose of resolving the completion account. The Plaintiffs\n\nsolicitors then wrote to the Defendants solicitors the same day as follows:\"1. We refer to the attendance before the Judicial Commissioner Tay Yong\n\n  Kwang this morning on the matter of the Settlement Account for completion.2. We enclose herewith revised Completion Account and in respect of which\n\n  please take note the manner of payments requested.3. With regard to your clients liability to indemnify our clients to the\n\n  extend of 46% of the Companys and Teng-Tong Corporation Pte Ltds liabilities, our clients\n\n  will seek your clients payment in discharge of their indemnity for each and every of the\n\n  liabilities when discharged. In this regard, we shall forward to you as soon as possible a\n\n  statement of all the liabilities subject to your clients indemnity. Amongst others, the\n\n  liabilities will include the Companys and Teng-Tong Corporation Pte Ltds liability to third\n\n  parties for the refund of rental deposits and tax liabilities.\"The revised Completion Account reads:\"REVISEDCOMPLETION ACCOUNTAmount payable under Order of Court9,000,000.00Less:redemption amount2,090,821.65(subject to adjustment)rental deposit and GST of PJ88142,587.00agreed valuation of 1st, 2ndand 3rdPlaintiffs share3,680,000.001stand 2ndDefendants hearing fee for the action5,580.00purchase price of furniture at Blk 640 Bukit Batok Central #01-04 by 1stand 2ndDefendants2,300.00Add:the redemption amount2,092,821.65M/s Lee & Lees bill284.28Total payable by your clients5,169,817.28Manners of Payment1.

In their three-page\n\nletter, they objected to the Plaintiffs attempt to include in Clause 17 KYHs and Teng Tongs\n\nliability for the refund of rental deposits. They alleged that taking such refund into account must\n\nnecessarily upset the valuation of the shares. There was also no dispute that the rental deposits\n\nhad been paid to the two companies which could have used the funds in the course of business. The\n\nDefendants, however, did not take any of these funds. The letter concluded by saying:\"It is only in respect of items 27 and 31 of the settlement account, i.e.\n\n  the provision for taxation, that the Judicial Commissioner have indicated that the parties be\n\n  indemnified at a later stage, when the amounts are in fact confirmed. Our clients do not dispute\n\n  this and will indemnify your clients in respect of 46% of the liability for such taxes, as\n\n  provided in item 31. Our clients trust that your clients would honour their word that they would\n\n  similarly indemnify our clients in respect of the taxes payable by PJ88.It is therefore, beyond any doubt that your statement \"the liabilities\n\n  will include the Companys and Teng Tong Corporation Pte Ltds liability to third parties for\n\n  the refund of the rental deposits\" cannot stand and it is but an attempt by your clients to\n\n  lower the valuation of the shares at a future date.Our clients will resist all your clients claim in this regard and will look\n\n  to your clients for all costs and expenses incurred in such an event.\"22 The Plaintiffs solicitors wrote to the Defendants solicitors on 13 April\n\n1999 (after the completion date) maintaining that the liabilities to be indemnified by the\n\nDefendants (up to 46%) included tax liabilities and the liability to refund the rental deposits.\n\nThey ended by stating that \"We shall in due course forward to you a statement of the\n\nliabilities to be indemnified by your clients\".23 Completion took place on 12 April 1999 on the basis of the Revised Completion\n\nAccount which only provided for the settlement of account of matters covered by Clause 16 and not\n\nthose within the ambit of Clauses 6 and 17.24 The Plaintiffs submitted that the Consent Order was clear in its terms and\n\nneither the pleadings nor the history of the proceedings could be utilised to give it a different\n\nmeaning. They maintained that the liabilities detailed in the Annexures following the Statement of\n\nClaim were within the scope of Clause 17 and have not been settled at the completion on 12 April\n\n1999. They also argued that Clause 5 did not require the parties to settle all matters covered by\n\nClauses 6, 16 and 17 by the completion date.THE DEFENDANTS CASE25 The crux of the Defendants case was that the parties intended to have\n\nfinality and certainty to the dispute in view of the unsalvageably bad relationship between the\n\nparties and in the light of the constant vacillations in the Plaintiffs stand during the\n\nnegotiations. The Defendants wanted to ensure that nothing in the settlement terms would change the\n\nfinal valuation of the shares which had been agreed after much difficulty. Clauses 16 and 17 were to\n\ntake into account any outstanding liabilities of the respective companies as at the cut-off date so\n\nthat they could all be settled at completion. The parties would then have a clean and complete break\n\nfrom one another.26 In order to facilitate the preparation of the settlement account by the\n\ncompletion date, Clauses 18 and 19 made provision for \"due diligence\" exercises to be\n\nconducted on the respective companies so that all liabilities could be uncovered. The Plaintiffs did\n\nengage accountants to carry out such an exercise on KYH and Teng Tong fully before the completion\n\ndate.27 The comprehensive Revised Completion Account prepared by the Plaintiffs did\n\nnot reflect any liabilities as defined in Clauses 16 and 17 and it must be taken that the parties\n\nhave settled on that basis and no further claim could be raised after 12 April 1999. Counsel for the\n\nDefendants would put the issue rhetorically thus, \"If they did not agree, why complete?\".28 Where the tax liabilities were concerned, as at 7 April 1999, they were only\n\nestimates. If they were confirmed by an assessment from the tax authority by the completion date,\n\nthey would be liabilities within the meaning of Clause 17. If they were not confirmed by that date,\n\nthey fell outside the scope of that clause. The Defendants solicitors accepted that there were\n\ntax estimates on 7 April 1999, as evidenced by their letter quoted earlier in this judgment. They\n\nsaw no need to reply to the Plaintiffs solicitors letter of 13 April 1999 as completion had\n\nalready taken place and, in their minds, that was the end of the matter.THE DECISION OF THE COURT29 As can be seen from the train of events outlined, the issue here is not really\n\nan accounting one. It is plainly a matter of interpretation of a clause in an agreement read in its\n\ncontext and then applying it to the events that have unfolded.30 I agree with the Defendants that the agreement contemplated finality and\n\ncertainty but would add that those ideals could not be, and were not, achieved in the circumstances.\n\nThere was therefore an unavoidable open-endedness where Clauses 16 and 17 were concerned.31 The parties have fairly and rightly accepted that my interpretation of Clause\n\n17 would apply equally to Clause 16 so that any benefit or detriment would apply to both sides where\n\nthe respective companies were concerned. In my view, the factual situation showed clearly that the\n\nparties did not complete on the basis that the Revised Completion Account was the last word.32 It therefore remains for me to consider the items in dispute individually or\n\nas a group, where appropriate, to determine whether they fall to be considered as liabilities within\n\nthe meaning of Clause 17. I will detail my findings on the items claimed by the Plaintiffs in the\n\nway they appeared in the Annexures attached to the Statement of Claim.ANNEXURE A (KYH)(1) This was an invoice dated 30 March 1999 rendered by the accountants in\n\nrespect of an audit for the year ending on 31 March 1998. The accountants were appointed before 21\n\nOctober 1998 although the bill was rendered after that cut-off date. It concerned work done for\n\nmatters occurring before the cut-off date. I therefore allowed this item to the Plaintiffs in full.(2) This was also an invoice dated 30 March 1999 for auditing and accounting\n\nservices in respect of the accounts for the period ending on 21 October 1998. However, the invoiced\n\namount of $6,000 for one item (AB 139) included the words \" together with attending to\n\nqueries arising from the due diligence\". The due diligence exercise was obviously post-21\n\nOctober 1998 and the costs thereof should not be charged to the Defendants. I compared this to the\n\nprevious invoice which charged $4,000 for accounting services only for a full financial year.\n\nAlthough the invoice in question covered a period of about seven months only, I did a rough estimate\n\nand deducted $2,000 from this invoice. This invoice was therefore allowed save that $2,000 would be\n\ndeducted.(3) This again was an invoice dated 30 March 1999 for auditing work for the year\n\nending on 31 March 1997. It was allowed in full for the same reasons in item (1).(4) This was an invoice dated 3 November 1998 by another firm of accountants for\n\nwork done in respect of matters dating back to 1995. It was disallowed because of the unexplained\n\noverlap in accounting periods between this and the earlier invoices.(5) This concerned payment of conservancy charges for October 1998 to the town\n\ncouncil. Payment was made post-21 October 1998 and the bill included the whole month of October\n\n1998. This item was disallowed.(6) This was a composition fine paid on 17 June 1999 for late filing of tax\n\nreturns for year of assessment 1998. As the date of the summons was not provided, I disallowed this\n\nitem.(7) to (10) These were invoices rendered in June 1999 by a company for\n\n\"business services\" in connection with KYHs tax matters dating from April 1994 to March\n\n1998. The company was engaged by the Plaintiffs only after the completion date on 12 April 1999.\n\nClearly, Clause 17 could not have been intended to include new expenses incurred after the cut-off\n\ndate although the matters covered were pre-21 October 1998. These items were obviously liabilities\n\nwhich were post-21 October 1998 and were therefore disallowed.(11) to (13) These were the rental deposits which would have to be returned to\n\nthe tenants upon termination of their tenancies. I disallowed these items. While such items could be\n\nliabilities in the drawing up of financial statements, they did not come within the ambit of Clause\n\n17 in the factual scenario here. It was not disputed that all rental deposits have been credited\n\ninto the companys bank accounts. The fact that the credit balances in the bank accounts were\n\ntaken into consideration for the purpose of the valuation of KYHs shares did not mean that they\n\nmust now be deducted as liabilities of the company. As stated earlier, the valuation was a rough and\n\nready one and was never intended to be an exercise in precise accounting. Certain items were\n\nincluded like others were excluded only for the sake of speed and simplicity. In any event, it was\n\nnot just assets that were considered by the parties in the rough and ready exercise. Liabilities\n\nlike mortgage loans were also taken into consideration. It was also possible that the rental\n\ndeposits were utilised for the companys other purposes after they were banked into the accounts.\n\nFurther, if precise accounting was the aim of the Plaintiffs, subsequent payments by trade debtors\n\nto the company for debts accruing before the cut-off date would have to be returned proportionately\n\nto the Defendants. Clause 6 of the Consent Order allowed verification that such deposits were\n\nproperly banked into the companys accounts so that any shortfall could be made good in the\n\ncompletion account. If they were in the companys accounts and had not been siphoned off, all the\n\nPlaintiffs had to do when the time came was to return the deposits to the tenants.(14) to (18) These were the tax liabilities of the company for the years of\n\nassessment 1997, 1998 and 1999. There was also an item pertaining to the year of assessment 1995\n\nwhere additional tax could be payable. I was informed by the Plaintiffs Counsel that these five\n\nitems were now confirmed in AB 242 which was a statement of account dated 19 April 2000 rendered by\n\nthe Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (\"IRAS\") to the company which showed that\n\n$346,013.29 was payable. This group of items was allowed at this amount subject to the Plaintiffs\n\nconfirmation that it related to tax payable up to 31 March 1998 rather than to the entire calendar\n\nyear. If it was for the whole year, then the proportionate amount of tax for the period after 21\n\nOctober 1998 should be deducted.ANNEXURE B (TENG TONG)(1) This was an invoice dated 12 April 1999 from the accountants for work done in\n\nconnection with the tax matters of Teng Tong for the year of assessment 1999. As the invoice\n\napparently covered the entire year of 1998, I allowed the amount claimed proportionately (i.e.\n\ncalculated up to 21 October 1998).(2) to (15) These concerned the rental deposits of stallholders in the coffeeshop.\n\nI disallowed all these items for the same reasons given earlier in respect of the other rental\n\ndeposits.(16) to (21) These were tax liabilities for periods before 21 October 1998 but\n\nwere paid only between March and May 1999. Items 18 to 21 were supposed to be in Annexure A as they\n\nrelated to KYH and not to Teng Tong. I allowed these items in full as they covered the pre-21\n\nOctober 1998 period and it did not matter that payment was made post-21 October 1998.33 As there could be tax refunds by IRAS in the future for the relevant items\n\nallowed, I directed the Plaintiffs solicitors to inform the Defendants solicitors within two\n\nweeks of my order whether any objections had been lodged with IRAS. The Plaintiffs undertook in any\n\nevent to return to the Defendants proportionately any refund or rebate given in respect of the tax\n\nstated in AB 242. I also directed the parties to adopt the same approach where tax liabilities of PJ\n\n88 up to 21 October 1998 were concerned.34 As the parties each succeeded or failed in about 50% of the value in dispute,\n\nI thought it right that they should bear their own costs for this action and I so ordered.Tay Yong KwangJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
