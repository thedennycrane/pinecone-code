        "Case(s) referred to": "Storey v Storey [1960] All ER 279 (refd)JudgmentGROUNDS OF DECISION1.    Central Bank of India (\"CBI\"), the plaintiff in\n\nthis consolidated hearing, is a bank incorporated in India. Natsyn Fibres Pte Ltd\n\n(\"Natsyn\"), the 3rddefendant in Suits No. 1045/99 and 1046/99 and\n\nthe defendant in Suit No. 1047/99, is a company incorporated in Singapore. Hemant Bansal\n\n(\"Bansal\") and his wife Aneeta Bansal, the 1stand 2nddefendants respectively in Suits No. 1045/99 and 1046/99 (referred to collectively as\n\n\"the Bansals\"), were the only shareholders and directors of Natsyn.2.    On 3 August 2001, a few days prior to the commencement of these\n\nhearings, a winding-up order was made against Natsyn. As a consequence all proceedings\n\nagainst Natsyn were, by reason of s 263(3) of the Companies Act, stayed. Accordingly, the\n\nhearings before me proceeded only in respect of the claims against the Bansals in\n\nSuits No. 1045/99 and 1046/99.3.    Natsyn, in late 1997, had purchased various goods from Bhagwati\n\nCottons Ltd (\"Bhagwati\") and GPB Fibres Ltd (\"GPB\"). Bhagwati – a\n\npublic listed company in India – was founded by Bansal’s father. Bansal’s\n\nfather had passed away in 1986 but Bansal and other members of his family continued to\n\nhold substantial interests in Bhagwati. Bansal was a director of Bhagwati.4.    GPB was also an Indian company. Bansal and other members of his\n\nfamily had substantial equity interest in GPB. GPB, at about the time of these\n\ntransactions, was amalgamated into Bhagwati. In view of the close relationship between GPB\n\nand Bhagwati, the parties in the proceedings before me did not seek to make any\n\ndistinction between the two companies. All references to Bhagwati in this judgment will\n\ntherefore, where appropriate, be references to GPB.5.    To pay for the goods purchased from Bhagwati, Natsyn, through\n\nCampagnie Financiere De Cic Et De L’Union Europeene in Singapore (\"CF\n\nBank\") and Mees Pierson NV in Singapore (\"MP Bank\") had opened various\n\nletters of credit (\"LCs\") in favour of Bhagwati. The LCs were subject to UCP 500\n\nand credit was available by negotiation.6.    Bhagwati, upon receipt of the LCs referred to above, approached\n\nCBI and discounted the bills under the LCs with CBI by presenting the requisite banking\n\nand shipping documents to CBI. Bhagwati received about US$2.8 million from CBI pursuant to\n\nsuch negotiations. It was CBI’s pleaded case that after negotiation CBI,\n\nat Bhagwati’s request, handed the negotiated documents to Bhagwati for Bhagwati\n\nto courier to CF Bank/MP Bank in Singapore. The documents did not, however, find their way\n\nto either CF Bank or MP Bank. It was pleaded that the documents, instead, found their way\n\nto the Bansals (and Natsyn) who then proceeded to arrange for the collection of the\n\ngoods comprised in the documents without payment to CBI of the sums due under the LCs.7.    In their defence, the Bansals did not specifically deny CBI’s\n\nallegation that the documents had been handed to Bhagwati for transmission to CF Bank and\n\nMP Bank. The position the Bansals took (as stated in paragraph 3 of the Defence) was:\"The 1stDefendant [ie Bansal] has no detailed\n\n  knowledge of the business relationship between GPB, Bhagwati and the Plaintiff. The 2ndand 3rdDefendants [ie Aneeta Bansal and Natsyn] have no knowledge of the\n\n  relationship between GPB, Bhagwati and the Plaintiff.\"Most significantly, there was no denial by the Bansals that they had\n\nreceived the negotiated documents from Bhagwati and had collected the goods comprised\n\ntherein.8.    CBI’s claimed that the Bansals were accountable to CBI for\n\nthe goods/monies received on the following grounds:(a)Conspiracy: conspiring with Bhagwati to injure CBI by\n\n  inducing CBI to part with the said documents purportedly for the purpose of delivering the\n\n  documents to CF Bank or MP Bank when the Bansals and Bhagwati had no intention of so\n\n  doing;(b)Conversion: unlawfully obtaining possession of the goods\n\n  represented by the said documents without CBI’s consent and appropriating those goods\n\n  in conversion of the same; and(c)Constructive trust: by knowingly receiving the documents\n\n  and/or the goods, the Bansals become constructive trustees for CBI of all monies received\n\n  that relate to the documents/goods;Alternatively, CBI claimed damages for the loss of the goods and/or\n\nbills.9.    The claim against the Bansals in Suit No. 1045/99 was for\n\nUS$1,190,893.28 and the claim in Suit No. 1046/99 was for US$274,319.04 making a total\n\nclaim of US$1,465,212. This figure was arrived at after giving the Bansals and Natsyn\n\n(\"the defendants\") credit for the sum of US$1,325,033 (being US$1,291,694 in\n\nrespect of Suit No. 1045/99 and US$33,339 in respect of Suit No. 1046/99) which sum\n\nthe defendants had, it was alleged, paid to CBI on or about 11 December 1997 in part\n\nsettlement of CBI’s claims in respect of these transactions. The Bansals, in their\n\nDefence and in the cross-examination of CBI’s witness, did not seek to deny that such\n\npart-payments had, in fact, been effected.10.    The claims against the Bansals in the two suits were almost\n\nidentical in nature. So were the Defences filed. The Bansals were content, in their\n\ndefence, merely to deny the alleged conspiracy, conversion and constructive trust. They\n\ndid not seek to put forward any positive case as to why they were not accountable to CBI\n\nfor the goods or the proceeds of sale thereof. However, in the course of the hearing,\n\nunder pressure from Mr Tan Teng Muan, counsel for CBI, the Bansals amended their Defence.\n\nIn their Amended Defence, they alleged that Natsyn had purchased the goods from Bhagwati\n\nunder terms which included the following:(a) LCs would be opened with GPB/Bhagwati as the beneficiaries;(b) The LCs would have certain conditions [which counsel referred to as\n\n  \"pre-conditions\"] apparent on the face of them, which would have to be fulfilled\n\n  for payment to be made. The effect of these conditions was that, if the conditions were\n\n  not met, the 3rdDefendant had the commercial option to make payment outside\n\n  the LC, through banking channels; and(c) In prior transactions, as well as in some of the transactions\n\n  relevant to the present proceedings, payments outside the LCs (through banking channels)\n\n  had been made and accepted by GPB/Bhagwati with the knowledge of CBI.Mr N. Sreenivasan, counsel for the Bansals, indicated that the reason\n\nhis clients had been tardy in pleading a positive case was because of fears of adverse\n\nreactions in India from the foreign exchange regulatory authorities.11.    From the amendments made and from the questions put to CBI’s\n\nwitness by Mr Sreenivasan, I gathered that the Bansals were alleging that under the terms\n\nunder which Natsyn had purchased the goods from Bhagwati, Natsyn was at liberty to either\n\npay for the goods under the LCs or, at its option, deliberately fail to meet the\n\npre-conditions contained in the LCs and instead make payments for the goods directly.12.    The \"pre-conditions\" identified by Mr Sreenivasan in\n\nthe course of his cross-examination of CBI’s witness were cl 7 in the LCs from MP\n\nBank and Special Condition 3 in the LCs from CF Bank. Clause 7 of the LCs from MP Bank\n\nstated:\"Inspection certificate issued by the applicant, duly signed by\n\n  the authorised signatories of the applicant whose signatures must be verified by the\n\n  issuing bank prior to negotiation, stating that the goods are strictly in accordance with\n\n  the terms of the contract.\"whilst cl 3 of the LCs from CF Bank stated:\"Discharge port and notify party will be advised later by way of\n\n  amendment to this credit.\"From the questions asked, the suggestion appears to be that CBI was\n\nprivy to this arrangement wherein Natsyn had such an option. It was suggested to\n\nCBI’s witness that the release of the documents to Bhagwati by CBI (in the\n\ntransactions related to the present proceedings as well as in some earlier transactions)\n\nsignalled CBI’s willingness to receive payments outside the LC. It was further\n\nsuggested that it was in this context that the part-payments amounting to US$1,325,033\n\n(referred to earlier) were made to CBI.13.    CBI called only one witness in support of its claim.\n\nThis was Vijay Kumar Bhandari (\"Bhandari\"), the General Manager since 1996\n\nof the Head Office of CBI situate at Mumbai (India). In that capacity, Bhandari had\n\nsupervisory powers over the Branch Offices at Mumbai. The accounts of Bhagwati relevant to\n\nthe transactions in the present cases were maintained at one of the Mumbai Branch Offices.\n\nAs Bhandari was stationed at the Head Office, he had no personal knowledge of the\n\nmatters related to these claims. His evidence on the circumstances surrounding the release\n\nof the documents to Bhagwati was therefore based entirely on what he could gather from the\n\ndocumentation available at the office. In particular, he sought to adduce in evidence a\n\npile of documents known as \"Process Notes\". Process Notes were notes kept by\n\nofficers of CBI of conversations with customers and others having dealings with CBI.14.    In the Process Notes that Bhandari sought to produce to the court\n\nthe officers of CBI who had been involved in the requests by Bhagwati for the discounted\n\ndocuments had allegedly noted the reasons for the requests and sought the directions of\n\nthe Senior Manager at the Branch – one Peter Soundararajan – on these requests.\n\nCBI, however, did not call any of these officers (or Peter Soundararajan) to testify.15.    Mr Sreenivasan objected to the admission of these Process Notes\n\nor to any testimony from Bhandari on the contents of the Notes. Mr Sreenivasan pointed out\n\nthat it was incumbent on CBI, in support of their allegation of conspiracy, to prove that\n\nthe documents were released as a result of some misrepresentations by Bhagwati. This, he\n\nsubmitted, CBI could properly do only through the officers to whom those representations\n\nhad allegedly been made. He submitted that in the absence of the testimony of those\n\nofficers the Process Notes allegedly made by them were hearsay and therefore inadmissible.\n\nMr Sreenivasan also pointed out that the Notes were, in the main, illegible and submitted\n\nthat the court should not engage itself in speculating what those officers had intended to\n\nwrite in the Process Notes.16.    Mr Tan conceded that in the absence of the testimony of the\n\npersons who wrote the Process Notes, the contents of the Notes would prima facie be\n\nhearsay and inadmissible. He sought, however, to persuade the court that the\n\nprovisions of s 32(b) and s 34 of the Evidence Act were applicable in this case and that\n\nthe Process Notes were admissible in evidence under those provisions.17.    The criteria for the admission of any statement, oral or written,\n\nunder the provisions of s 32 is that the statement must be made by –\"… a person who is dead or who cannot be found, or who has\n\n  become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an\n\n  amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the court\n\n  unreasonable ...\"For CBI to be permitted to adduce the Process Notes under s 32(b), CBI\n\nwould have to satisfy the court that the case fell within the above criteria.Sarkar on\n\nEvidence(14thEd 1993, Vol I, at 559), in dealing with similar provisions\n\nin the Indian Evidence Act, states:\"The general ground of reception of such evidence is that in the\n\n  cases in question no better evidence is to be had. Such statements are admitted on the\n\n  principle of Necessity. The person whose statement is offered being dead or not available,\n\n  no better evidence can be had.Before reception of this kind of evidence, the first\n\n  condition of admissibility, viz death, etc must be proved to the satisfaction of the judge.\"(Emphasis added.)There was, in the present case, no evidence led on behalf of CBI to\n\nshow that the makers of the Process Notes fell within the stipulated criteria. To the\n\ncontrary, it appeared from the evidence of Bhandari that no serious effort was made\n\nby CBI to procure their attendance.18.    The other provision in the Evidence Act relied on by CBI, namely\n\ns 34, was also, in my view, of no assistance to CBI. Section 34 is a very limited\n\nprovision that applies only in respect of books of account. In the present case, whilst\n\nsome of the Process Notes appear to have some figures scrawled on them, those scrawls\n\ncould not, in my view, have the effect of converting those Process Notes into books of\n\naccount.19.    For the above reasons, I ruled that the contents of the Process\n\nNotes, in the absence of the testimony of the persons who wrote them, would not be\n\nadmissible in evidence.20.    Encouraged perhaps by the fact that this ruling in effect meant\n\nthat there was an absence of any direct evidence that the documents were handed over on\n\nthe representation by Bhagwati that Bhagwati would, on behalf of CBI, courier the\n\ndocuments to CF Bank and MP Bank in Singapore, the Bansals, at the close of CBI’s\n\ncase, elected not to adduce any evidence in defence of the claims but rely only on a\n\nsubmission of no case.21.    A decision by a defendant not to adduce evidence in his defence\n\nis a decision that ought not to be lightly taken. Where a defendant makes such an\n\nelection, the result will be that the court is left with only the plaintiff’s version\n\nof the story. So long as there is some prima facie evidence that supports the essential\n\nlimbs of the plaintiff’s claim/s, then the failure by the defendant to adduce\n\nevidence on his own behalf would be fatal to the defendant.22.    In their text-book: \"Litigation: Evidence and Procedure\"\n\n(16thEd), at page 732, Aronson and Hunter summarise the effect of making such\n\na submission as follows:\"A no case to answer submission by a defendant or accused will\n\n  succeed only if the evidence supporting the case of the plaintiff or prosecution\n\n  (respectively) is fatally flawed. It is so flawed only if there is a complete absence ofanyevidence which could lead to an inference that a critical fact exists. If there is some\n\n  evidence on each critical element, there is a case to answer, no matter how slender\n\n  or unbelievable the judge might think it to be.…However, if the defence leads no evidence where there is a case to\n\n  answer, its silence could (depending on the facts) be taken to strengthen the\n\n  opposing case. In particular, circumstantial evidence which could cut both ways might well\n\n  look stronger if the defendant or accused is in a position to dispel the doubt, but\n\n  refuses to go into evidence:May v O’Sullivan(1955) 92 CLR 654; andWeissensteiner\n\n  v R(1993) 178 CLR 217.\"This text was drawn to my attention by Mr Tan.23.    Mr Sreenivasan described Aronson and Hunter’s book as a\n\n\"somewhat obscure Australian text\" and urged me to reject that summary of the\n\nlegal position and rely instead on what was said by the English Court of Appeal inStorey\n\nv Storey[1960] All ER 279. In particular, Mr Sreenivasan drew my attention to\n\nthe following passage in the judgment of Ormerod LJ in that case (at page 282):\"There are, however, two sets of circumstances under which a\n\n  defendant may submit that he has no case to answer. In the one case there may be a\n\n  submission that, accepting the plaintiff’s evidence at its face value, no case has\n\n  been established in law, and in the other that the evidence led for the plaintiff is so\n\n  unsatisfactory or unreliable that the court should find that the burden of proof has not\n\n  been discharged.\"Mr Sreenivasan submitted that the evidence led by CBI did not satisfy\n\neither of the circumstances referred to by Ormerod LJ.24.    InStorey v Storey, the Court of Appeal was considering\n\nthe circumstances in which an appeal court can, in a case where a submission of no case\n\nhad been upheld, direct that a new trial be held. This appears from the paragraph\n\nfollowing the above quoted passage where Ormerod LJ states:\"There can, we think, be no doubt that in the former type of\n\n  submission a defendant is bound by his election, and there can be no new trial. This rule,\n\n  in our opinion, however, does not of necessity apply to the second type of case where the\n\n  judge is invited to dismiss the case because of the unsatisfactory or unreliable nature of\n\n  the evidence. In some cases it may well be that the appellate court will be able to decide\n\n  the case without sending it back, but in others, and this in our judgment is certainly\n\n  one, justice could not be done without a re-hearing.…In our opinion, if the submission of no case is based on the\n\n  unsatisfactory or unreliable nature of the evidence led by the plaintiff, and the\n\n  appellate court finds itself unable on the findings of the court below to come to a just\n\n  conclusion, the only course to be adopted in the interests of justice is to order a new\n\n  trial, even if the defendant has elected to stand on his submission.\"It was in that context that Ormerod LJ highlighted the two\n\ncircumstances in the passage quoted in paragraph 23 above.25.    It may be that the view taken by Aronson and Hunter was too\n\nrestrictive and that a submission of no case to meet may also be upheld where the evidence\n\nadduced by the plaintiff is so unsatisfactory or unreliable that the court is able to find\n\nthat the burden of proof on the plaintiff has not been discharged. But that said, I\n\nnevertheless consider the summary by Aronson and Hunter a helpful one.26.    In the present case, CBI was the negotiating bank and as\n\nnegotiating bank had given value for the shipping and other documents presented to them by\n\nBhagwati. Having given value, the documents belonged to CBI and it was CBI that was\n\nentitled to the possession and use of the goods represented by the documents. However, the\n\ndocuments found their way to Natsyn and it was not in dispute that the goods represented\n\nby the documents were dealt with by Natsyn. Evidence was given by Bhandari that whenever\n\nCBI negotiated documents, it would rubber-stamp the documents with a unique rubber stamp\n\nthat made it clear that the documents had been taken up by CBI. Natsyn in receiving the\n\ndocuments would therefore have had notice of CBI’s interest in the documents. In any\n\nevent, Natsyn would have known that it had received documentation that should, since the\n\ngoods were to be paid for by LC, have been received by CF Bank or MP Bank. As the Bansals\n\nwere the only shareholders/directors of Natsyn, it is not an unreasonable inference to\n\ndraw that Natsyn received and dealt with the documents with their full complicity.27.    There was no evidence before the court of the circumstances under\n\nwhich the documents had been handed over to Bhagwati by CBI. That being so, it could\n\njustifiably be said that there was, at the close of CBI’s case, no evidence before\n\nthe court to support the allegation of conspiracy. But conspiracy is only one of the three\n\nheads of claim raised by CBI. The other two were conversion and constructive trust and one\n\nneeds to consider whether, at the close of CBI’s case, there was prima facie evidence\n\nto support CBI’s claims under these two heads.28.    At the close of the case for CBI, there was evidence on which the\n\ncourt could come to the conclusion that the Bansals knew, when they (through Natsyn) dealt\n\nwith the goods covered by the documents, that the documents were the property of CBI. In\n\nproceeding to deal with the goods despite that knowledge, the Bansals could well be liable\n\nin conversion and/or as constructive trustees. But, by electing not to testify, the\n\nBansals have elected not to put before the court their explanation of the events that\n\nhappened. In these circumstances, I can only conclude that they had no defence to these\n\nclaims. I therefore give judgment in favour of CBI in the sum of US$1,190,893.28 in Suit\n\nNo. 1045/99 and US$274,319.04 in Suit No. 1046/99. I also order that the Bansals pay\n\nthe costs of the two suits and pay interest on the judgment sum at 6% per annum from date\n\nof writ.Sgd:S. RAJENDRANJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
