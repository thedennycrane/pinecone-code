        "(ii) Was the MC entitled to levy the two charges?": "34. There is nothing in either s 12(2) or any section of the Act that\n\nspecifically authorises a management corporation dealing with an application for approval\n\nto levy a charge which relates to the improvement of common property. The management\n\ncorporation may be able to impose certain administrative charges for dealing with the\n\napplication. I certainly do not rule out such a power. The Act, however, has specific\n\nsections dealing with the management corporation’s power to raise money from\n\nsubsidiary proprietors when the money is required to maintain or improve the common\n\nproperty or fixtures or equipment which are part of the common property or required for\n\nthe enjoyment of the common property.35. It is clear from s 48 of the Act that if any management corporation\n\nwishes to raise money by way of contributions for the purpose of meeting its liabilities\n\nfor the renewal or replacement of any electrical and mechanical installations existing for\n\ncommon use, it must determine the amount of such contributions in general meeting of the\n\nsubsidiary proprietors. Sub-section (q) expressly empowers the management corporation to\n\nlevy, in accordance with s 42, on each person liable therefor, a contribution to raise the\n\namount which the general meeting has determined is necessary for such renewal or\n\nreplacement. Secondly, under s 42(2), these contributions levied by a management\n\ncorporation shall be levied in respect of each lot and, with certain exceptions which are\n\nnot applicable here, be payable by the subsidiary proprietors in shares proportional to\n\nthe share value of their respective lots. This provision re-emphasises the directive in s\n\n30(2) which provides that the share value of a lot shall determine, among other things,\n\nthe amount of contributions levied by a management corporation on the subsidiary\n\nproprietors of all the lots in a subdivided building.36. It was emphasised by the Court of Appeal inMCST No. 980 v Yat\n\nYuen Hong Co Pte Ltd[1993] 1 SLR 555that an essential feature of the Act is the\n\nlevying of contributions in proportion to share value:‘In the High Court and before us, it was common ground that this\n\n  resolution was not binding on the subsidiary proprietors as it was passed contrary to ss.\n\n  28(2)(c) and 36(3) of the Act. These two provisions of the Act respectively provide that\n\n  the share units of each subsidiary lot shall, inter alia, determine \"the\n\n  proportion\" payable by each subsidiary proprietor of contributions levied by the\n\n  management corporation and that the management corporation in general meeting may only\n\n  raise the amounts determined in the manner prescribed by levying contributions on the\n\n  subsidiary proprietors \"in proportion to the share units\" of their respective\n\n  lots. It was a failure to understand this essential feature in the strata title scheme\n\n  established by statute that invalidated this resolution, which purported to impose\n\n  maintenance charges at a flat rate rather than in proportion to the share units.’\n\n  (per Lai Kew Chai J at p 558)It should be noted that the s 28(2)(c) referred to in the extract is\n\nnow s 30(2)(c). The then s 36(3) no longer exists but the same scheme is provided for by\n\nss 42(1) and (2) read with ss 48(m), (n), and (q).37. The Court of Appeal also quoted with approval the following\n\nobservation by Holland J inJacklin & Ors v Proprietors of Strata Plan No 2795[1975] 1 NSWLR 152 (at p 24) in relation to the strata legislation of New South Wales which, as\n\nour appellate court observed, is schematically and conceptually similar to the Act:‘The legislation takes the common property as a whole and treats\n\n  each proprietor as having an undivided beneficial interest in every part of it, whether or\n\n  not that part is susceptible of any use or enjoyment by that proprietor or of greater use\n\n  or enjoyment by that proprietor than by any other. Similarly, with respect to the\n\n  provision of funds for the repair and maintenance of all or any part of the common\n\n  property, the legislation provides for only one fund with contributions to be levied\n\n  proportionately on all proprietors irrespective of any individual proprietors' use and\n\n  enjoyment thereof. Thus the ownership and the financial burden of common property is to be\n\n  held and shared by all proprietors in common in shares according to their respective unit\n\n  entitlements. Consistently with this unity of approach, the duty of control, management,\n\n  administration, repair and maintenance of common property is imposed by the legislation\n\n  upon the body corporate. This duty is necessarily owed to each and every proprietor. In my\n\n  opinion, there flows from the scheme of the legislation as an incident of proprietorship\n\n  of a lot a right in each proprietor to have the body corporate's duty performed in\n\n  relation to all of the common property at the cost and expense of all proprietors in\n\n  proportion to unit entitlements. As the duty is not only to repair and maintain but also\n\n  to control, manage and administer, the right of each proprietor includes a right to have\n\n  the whole administration of repairs and maintenance of common property carried out by the\n\n  body corporate by its servants and agents.’38. It is thus clear that when a management corporation like the MC in\n\nthis case wishes to raise funds from the subsidiary proprietors in order to finance the\n\nreplacement or modernisation of an elevator system which is part of the common property\n\nand used by various subsidiary proprietors to gain access to their units from the common\n\nproperty, it must do so by levying contributions on each subsidiary proprietor in the\n\nproportion that his share value bears to the total cost of such work. It cannot charge any\n\nsubsidiary proprietor a flat amount that bears no relation to that proprietor’s share\n\nvalue whether that flat amount is more or less than the proprietor would have paid on a\n\ncalculation based on his share value. This rule applies even if that subsidiary proprietor\n\nis likely to use the elevator system more than the other subsidiary proprietors.39. In this case, the MC at all times realised it was levying a\n\n‘contribution’ on De Beers as a subsidiary proprietor towards the cost of the\n\nmodernisation of the lifts. The word ‘contribution’ was used not only in the\n\ncorrespondence by the MC itself but also by its witnesses in court and by its counsel. So\n\nthe nature of the first payment was not in dispute. Since it was a contribution towards\n\nthe cost of modernising the lifts, it should not have been charged to De Beers in the way\n\nthat it was. Instead, the total cost should have been put (as it was eventually) to the\n\ngeneral meeting and, once approved, properly calculated contributions could have been\n\nlevied on each subsidiary proprietor if the funds then in the MC’s hands were\n\ninsufficient to meet the cost.40. The pretext for asking De Beers to pay such a large proportion of\n\nthe cost was that the conversion plans would result in increased traffic which the\n\nexisting lift system could not accommodate. The evidence that was adduced in court,\n\nhowever, indicated very clearly that in any case the MC had been contemplating upgrading\n\nthe lift system in some way due to the numerous complaints it had received from many\n\nsubsidiary proprietors on the frequent break downs and slow response time of the lifts. It\n\nwould also be noted that when the resolution to approve the modernisation works was put to\n\nthe general meeting of the MC, the explanatory notes accompanying the special resolution\n\ngave a detailed history of the lift equipment. These mentioned that lift equipment had not\n\nbeen replaced since the completion of the complex 22 years previously and therefore\n\ndespite regular maintenance, further repairs and parts replacement were necessary in the\n\nimmediate future. There was not a word in this statement about increased traffic arising\n\nfrom the conversion of the penthouses. In my view, therefore, the modernisation of the\n\nlift system was not the result of the conversion of the penthouses into maisonettes but\n\nwork that would have been done sooner or later by the MC. Even if the MC had decided to\n\ninstall an extra lift simply because of the conversion work, that would not have justified\n\nit in charging De Beers for the cost of the same in the way that it did. As the lift would\n\nhave been a mechanical installation existing for common use those costs would have had to\n\nbe levied on all the subsidiary proprietors in the normal way.41. I am satisfied therefore that the MC had no power under the Act to\n\nlevy the $200,000 contribution on De Beers.42. The case of the $170,000 contribution is even plainer. The\n\nsituation was covered by s 42(5). Under that provision, the MC was permitted, if it\n\nincurred additional expenditure by reason of having to maintain the common corridor\n\ncreated by the conversion works, to levy additional contributions on De Beers in order to\n\nrecover such additional expenditure. The proviso to the implementation of such a levy was\n\nthat the additional contributions had to be approved by the Commissioner of Buildings who\n\nwould have to give De Beers an opportunity of being heard before approving the same. The\n\nMC did not follow this procedure. Instead, it asked De Beers for a totally arbitrary\n\nfigure of $200,000 to cover the maintenance cost and was only willing to reduce that to\n\n$170,000 after some bargaining by De Beers. There was no justification for the amount\n\ncharged: Mr Wong’s estimate of those costs was $70,000 less than the MC’s\n\ninitial asking price. Further, that estimate covered a period of 20 years. With such a\n\nhigh mark-up over such a prolonged period, it is not surprising that the MC did not ask\n\nthe Commissioner of Buildings for its approval of the additional levy.43. Counsel for the MC, Mr Benjamin Sim, contended that s 42(5) did not\n\napply because its wording referred to a situation ‘where a lot has been subdivided\n\ninto 2 or more lots’. He submitted that the procedure in that section would only\n\napply after the subdivision had taken place and not when the subsidiary proprietor asked\n\nfor approval prior to subdivision. Counsel referred in particular to the situation where\n\nthe subsidiary proprietors by a special resolution direct the management corporation to\n\naccept the additional common property under s 25(1) of the Act. He also submitted that s\n\n42(4) was permissive rather than mandatory in that it provided that the management\n\ncorporation ‘may levy such additional contributions as may be approved by the\n\nCommissioner’. That meant that the management corporation could, but need not, resort\n\nto s 42(4).44. I do not accept the above submissions. It is obvious that s 42(4)\n\nwas designed to allow a management corporation to recover the extra cost of maintaining\n\nnew common property from the subsidiary proprietor who had created the same. This is a\n\nfair provision. It is not right that if one proprietor decides to subdivide his lots and\n\ncreate new common property from them that all the other proprietors should share in the\n\ncost of maintaining the new property especially when the new common property basically\n\naccommodates the subdividing proprietor and his successors. The charges imposed must be\n\nfair, however, and probably, collected as they are incurred and not in advance. This is\n\nwhy the Commissioner of Buildings has to approve their imposition and hear the subsidiary\n\nproprietor’s views on them before doing so. It would be subverting the purpose of the\n\nlegislation if I were to interpret it as not applying when approval is asked for before\n\nthe subdivision takes place since in the light of s 12(2) the management\n\ncorporation’s approval must be given before the subdivision can be implemented. As\n\nfar as the argument on the permissive nature of the provision is concerned, I agree it is\n\na permissive provision but not in the way that counsel submitted. The section is\n\npermissive in the sense that the management corporation may, but need not, levy additional\n\ncontributions on the subsidiary proprietor. If the management corporation chooses to make\n\nsuch levies, it must then obtain the approval of the Commissioner of Buildings. The\n\nsection does not permit the management corporation to choose not to obtain approval if it\n\nhas chosen to levy additional contributions.45. In my judgment, the MC had no power to require De Beers to pay it\n\n$170,000 towards the cost of maintaining the new common corridor as a condition for its\n\napproval of De Beers’ subdivision plans. In addition, the MC acted unlawfully in not\n\ncomplying with the requirements of s 42(5).",
        "(iii) Are payments made under a mistake of law recoverable?": "46. Prior to the decision of the House of Lords inKleinwort Benson\n\nLtd v Lincoln City Council[1998] 3 WLR 1095, the common law position was that\n\npayments made under a mistake of law were not recoverable, unlike payments made under a\n\nmistake of fact. This rule originated from the decision of Lord Ellenborough inBilbie\n\nv Lumley[1802] 2 East 469 which was made on the basis that ‘every man must be\n\ntaken to be cognizant of the law; otherwise there is no saying to what extent the excuse\n\nof ignorance might not be carried’.Bilbie v Lumleywas subsequently approved\n\ninKelly v Solari[1841] 9 M&W 54 and despite increasing academic criticism the\n\nrule stood firm until it came up for consideration in theKleinwort Bensoncase.\n\nThe common law rule was applied in Singapore in 1959 inSerangoon Garden Estate Ltd v\n\nMarian Chye[1959] MLJ 113.47. InKleinwort Bensonthe House of Lords was invited on a\n\nleap-frog appeal from the High Court to consider whether the mistake of law rule should be\n\nmaintained as part of English law. So rife had the criticism of the rule become by that\n\ntime (its abolition had been recommended by the English Law Reform Commission (1994)) that\n\nwhilstKleinwort Bensonitself presented a fully developed argument for the\n\nabrogation of the mistake of law rule, the opposing party did not submit that the rule\n\nshould be retained but rather that it should be reformulated. It was held by a majority of\n\nthree to two (the leading judgment being delivered by Lord Goff) that on an application of\n\nthe principle of unjust enrichment the rule precluding recovery of money paid under\n\nmistake of law could no longer be maintained and recognition should be given to a general\n\nright to recover money paid under mistake, whether of fact or law, subject to the defences\n\navailable in the law of restitution. It was further held that recovery was permissible\n\neven where the payment had been made under a certain understanding of the law which was\n\nsubsequently departed from by judicial decision or where the payment had been received by\n\nthe recipient under an honest belief of entitlement to retain the money.48. The two dissenting judges were also convinced that the law should\n\nbe changed so as to permit monies paid under a mistake of law to be recovered but they\n\nconsidered that this change should be effected by legislation and not by judicial decision\n\nbecause the consequence of the change was, as Lord Browne-Wilkinson put it that ‘on\n\nevery occasion in which a higher court changed the law by judicial decision, all those who\n\nhad made payments on the basis that the old law was correct (however long ago such\n\npayments were made) would have six years in which to bring a claim to recover monies paid\n\nunder a mistake of law’ (at p 1105). It was only the legislature that would be able\n\nto properly regulate the limitation period applicable to recovery actions brought on this\n\nbasis. The dissenting judges therefore thought it would be better to leave the law as it\n\nwas and let the legislature introduce both the new cause of action and the necessary\n\nlimitation provisions.49. Mr Harpreet Singh, counsel for De Beers, submitted that since theKleinwort\n\nBensondecision, in Singapore too the distinction between payments made under mistake\n\nof fact and those made under mistake of law had been abrogated. He asserted that,\n\naccordingly, De Beers was entitled to claim recovery on the basis that the payments\n\ntotalling $370,000 made to the MC were made in the mistaken belief that the MC was\n\nentitled to impose the payment conditions as a prerequisite to the granting of its\n\napproval. Mr Sim did not contend that the mistake of law rule still applied in Singapore.\n\nInstead, his submissions concentrated on reasons why, factually, this cause of action was\n\nnot available to De Beers.50. Despite the fact that Mr Sim has not taken issue on the point, I\n\nhave to decide whether I should followKleinwort Bensonor continue to observe the\n\nprior common law rule on mistake of law as the same has been considered to apply to\n\nSingapore for many years. One example of this is theSerangoon Gardenscase cited\n\nearlier. Further, in 1992, in the course of dealing with a case involving a payment made\n\nunder an alleged mistake of fact, the Court of Appeal observed that the law requires a\n\nperson who receives money, to which he is not entitled, to repay the person who paid it,\n\nunless the mistake is one of law. SeeBorneo Motors (S) Pte Ltd v William Jacks &\n\nCo (S) Pte Ltd[1992] 2 SLR 881. In that case, however, the court did not have\n\nto deal with a payment made under a mistake of law and therefore its observation was a\n\nrepetition of the then generally understood common law position. It was not a considered\n\nholding that this position should continue to apply in Singapore despite all the\n\ncriticisms that had been made of the artificiality and arbitrary nature of the distinction\n\nbetween a factual mistake and a legal mistake.51. It is also relevant that other common law jurisdictions, apart from\n\nEngland, have abolished the rule. In Canada, the rule was abrogated by the Supreme Court\n\nof Canada inAir Canada v British Columbia[1989] 1 SCR 1161, in Australia, by the\n\nHigh Court of Australia inDavid Securities Pte Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia[1992] 66 ALJR 768 and in South Africa inWillis Faber Enthoven (Pty) Ltd v Receiver of\n\nRevenue[1992] (4) SA 202. These judicial decisions were following far in the trail of\n\nthe legislative paths blazed in New Zealand in 1958 and in Western Australia in 1962 when\n\nthe rule was abolished by statute.52. On 9 April 2001, the Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy\n\nof Law endorsed, and approved for publication, a paper entitled ‘Reforms to the Law\n\nof Restitution on Mistakes of Law’ prepared on behalf of the Committee by Cavinder\n\nBull and Chou Sean Yu. This paper considered the mistake of law rule as it had developed\n\nand been applied in the Commonwealth and discussed the various criticisms of the rule, the\n\njurisdictions in which the rule had been abolished either judicially or by legislation and\n\nthe consequences of an abolition of the rule. It concluded that the common law rule that a\n\npayment under a mistake of law is irrecoverable is no longer tenable. The recommendations\n\nmade by this paper are, inter alia:‘(a) The rule precluding the recovery of payments made under a\n\n  mistake of law [should] be abrogated by legislation;(b) There be no recovery where payment was made on the basis of settled\n\n  law which was subsequently changed by judicial decision;(c) The legislation is to be of retrospective effect;(d) Section 29(1)(c) of the Limitation Act be amended to clarify that\n\n  it applies irrespective of whether the mistake is one of law or of fact;(e) There be an overriding time limit of 12 years for limitation\n\n  periods in respect of claims made under mistake.’53. In my view, the legal tide has moved decisively against the mistake\n\nof law rule. We in Singapore should not, and, as is shown by the report cited in  52, do\n\nnot wish to, cling to an old rule simply because of its antiquity. The mistake of law rule\n\nwas itself a mistake.Kleinwort Bensonhas buried it in England and I consider that\n\nwe should follow that very persuasive authority and bury the rule here as well. I realise\n\nthat until there is legislative intervention following the English decision will lead to\n\nthe difficulties commented on by Lord Browne-Wilkinson. Whilst I do not consider it\n\ngenerally beneficial for parties to be able to unravel long concluded transactions, in my\n\nview, it would, however, be worse to continue to deny recovery to all persons who have\n\nmade payment under a mistake of law. The category of persons who would have paid on the\n\nbasis of a settled view of the law which is subsequently changed is only a sub-set of the\n\npersons who make payment by reason of a mistake as to the legal position and the general\n\nbody of such payors should not, in my view, be prevented from recovering money from\n\nrecipients who had no entitlement to the same simply because some of such payors would\n\nfall within the sub-set.",
        "(iv) Were these payments made by reason of a mistake of law?": "54. Mr Ow’s evidence in relation to the first payment was that he\n\nhad felt at that time that the MC was simply using the occasion to extort the sum of\n\n$200,000 from De Beers as a condition for approving De Beers’ plans to subdivide the\n\nfour penthouse units. He said that he could not then and still cannot see any\n\njustification for the MC’s imposition of this condition. However, it was clear to him\n\nthat unless De Beers caved in and accepted the condition, the MC would not grant the\n\nrequisite approval. Mr Lim told him that De Beers could either ‘take it or leave\n\nit’.55. In relation to the second payment, Mr Ow testified that when he was\n\ninformed by Mr Lim that the MC would only endorse its consent on the strata subdivision\n\nplans if De Beers paid a further $200,000 to the MC to offset the maintenance cost for the\n\nadditional common property, he considered the explanation a lame excuse for extorting\n\nmonies from De Beers. He could not imagine how the MC could justify a demand of $200,000\n\nfrom De Beers since the only additional common property which was created was a small\n\nstripe of corridor space in front of the 18 units. He further said that when he attended\n\nthe council meeting on 20 July 1993 and his counter-proposal of $100,000 was not well\n\nreceived, it was apparent to him that the MC was using this opportunity to extract as much\n\nmoney as they could from De Beers. Mr Ow also stated that De Beers again felt forced to\n\ncave in to the MC’s demands and felt at the mercy of the MC.56. Based on the above evidence, Mr Sim submitted that there was no\n\nmistake of law on the part of De Beers. He interpreted Mr Ow’s statements as\n\nindicating that all along De Beers was aware that the monetary requirements of the MC were\n\nunlawful. I do not agree with Mr Sim’s interpretation of the evidence. Mr Ow was\n\nexpressing his dissatisfaction with what at the time he had considered to be exorbitant\n\ndemands on the part of the MC. His further evidence in court was that he thought the MC\n\nwas acting lawfully though immorally in requiring such payments. His contemporaneous\n\nbehaviour also shows that his main objection was to quantum rather than to the imposition\n\nof a payment condition. He bargained the first time and obtained a slight reduction of\n\n$20,000 and the second time he bargained more strenuously and was able to obtain a\n\nslightly bigger reduction of $30,000.57. Mr Ow had been advised by De Beers’ architect that the\n\nMC’s approval was a prerequisite for the company’s conversion plans. The\n\narchitect had not advised him as to the conditions that the MC was entitled to impose for\n\nthe issue of such approval and Mr Ow does not appear to have asked his advice or the\n\nadvice of a lawyer on whether the financial conditions were lawful. He acted as a\n\nbusinessman in trying to reduce costs rather than as a lawyer in trying to challenge the\n\nbasis of the costs. Was it wrong for him not to enquire as to the legal justification for\n\nthe conditions? I do not think so. At the time, the MC themselves believed they had the\n\nlegal power to impose the said conditions and both witnesses who testified on the\n\nMC’s behalf said that they too had believed that at all times these conditions were\n\nlawful. At no time did they, or to their knowledge any other person, suggest to Mr Ow that\n\nthe MC lacked the power to impose the conditions. On the contrary, they made it plain to\n\nMr Ow that satisfaction with the conditions was a prerequisite to the issue of the\n\napprovals. Whilst in his evidence, Mr Ow used strong words like ‘extort’ to\n\ndescribe what the MC had done, such usage is not in itself an indication that at the time\n\nthe conditions were imposed he seriously considered that they were unlawful. His conduct\n\nat that time would not indicate such a belief---the MC’s witnesses were at pains to\n\nrecount how he never really protested but seemed to accept the MC’s decision calmly,\n\neven cheerfully. No anger was shown. His only action was to attempt to bargain down the\n\nprices. The language of his affidavits was I believe a reflection of Mr Ow’s\n\nsubsequent view of the events rather than a sign that he knew or suspected at the time\n\nsomething was wrong and chose, recklessly, to act in disregard of such knowledge or\n\nsuspicions.58. In these circumstances, I find it reasonable that De Beers as a\n\nsubsidiary proprietor dealing with the MC as the body entitled to approve or reject their\n\nconversion plans and knowing that the MC had the power to levy contributions from\n\nsubsidiary proprietors to provide for the upkeep of the common property, would believe\n\nthat the MC was legally entitled to ask them for funds to upgrade the lift system and to\n\nmaintain the additional common property as a prerequisite to approving work which would\n\naffect the usage of the lifts and result in increased expenditure on the part of the MC. I\n\nfind, accordingly, that both payments were made by De Beers by reason of a mistaken belief\n\nthat the MC was legally entitled to ask for the funds as a condition of the issue of the\n\napproval under s 12(2) and that if they did not pay the MC could, legally, withhold the\n\napprovals that De Beers required on the ground of non-compliance with the condition. This\n\ndoes not mean that the payments were made voluntarily. They were not. They were accepted\n\nby De Beers as being the cost of obtaining the approvals De Beers needed.",
        "(v) Does the colore officii principle apply?": "59. Before I go on to consider whether De Beers’ claim for\n\nrestitution on the basis of a mistake is time barred, I should deal with the alternative\n\nbasis of their claim ie that they are entitled to reimbursement because the payments were\n\nmade in respect of ‘colore officii’demands. As far as I know,\n\nthere has been no reported case in Singapore of a claim having been brought on this basis\n\nprior to the present action.60. Thecolore officiiline of cases is discussed in the primary\n\ntext on restitution,The Law of Restitution(15thEd) by Goff and Jones,\n\nin a chapter entitled ‘Recovery of Benefits conferred under Duress’. A brief\n\ndescription of the effect of these cases is at p 320 of the text under the heading\n\n‘(d) Money paid to obtain the fulfilment of a duty: demandscolore officii’.\n\nThis reads:‘Where money has been paid to a public officer to obtain\n\n  performance by him of a duty which he is bound to carry out for nothing or for less than\n\n  the sum paid, such money or, where some money is due, the excess if recoverable in the\n\n  language of the old pleaders as money had and received. For the duty is a ‘public\n\n  duty imposed by law; and for the execution of that he had no right of any payment.’\n\n  It is ‘not necessary to show that the defendant acted in bad faith …\n\n  Nevertheless the phrase [colore officii] bears an imputation of imposition by a\n\n  person in authority upon another person ignorant of his rights.’It would be noted that one of the prerequisites of this cause of action\n\nfor restitution is that the payment in question has been made to a public officer. The\n\ntext goes on to comment, however, that the right of recovery has been extended ‘to\n\ninclude all cases where the defendant is in a quasi-public or monopolistic position and\n\ndemands a money payment to which he is not entitled, for the fulfilment of a duty owed by\n\nhim’ (at p 324).61. Mr Sim contended that thecolore officiidoctrine did not\n\napply to the facts of this case as the MC is neither a public authority nor in a\n\nquasi-public or monopolistic position. A management corporation, he argued, is not in the\n\nnature of a public body and it cannot be described as ‘monopolistic’ in any\n\nsense of the word. InHalsbury’s Law of England(4thEd), vol 1(1)\n\nat 6 a public authority is described as being ‘a person or administrative body\n\nentrusted with functions to perform for the benefit of the public and not for private\n\nprofit’ and ‘quasi’ is defined byBlack’s Law Dictionary(5thEd) as ‘as if; almost as it were; analogous to’. As for ‘monopoly’\n\nthat word, again according toHalsbury’s(vol 47, 102) relates to the\n\nsecuring of the exercise of any known trade throughout a particular country. It is also\n\nnot apt to describe a management corporation. Interestingly enough, a note appended to\n\nthat same paragraph quotes the case ofBritish South Africa Co v De Beers Consolidated\n\nMines Ltd[1910] 2 Ch 502 as authority for the proposition that an exclusive right\n\ngranted by a land owner to a third party to exercise rights over his land is not a\n\n‘monopoly’.62. I agree that the MC is not a public authority. Nor is the MC in a\n\nmonopolistic position since there is no trade involved in the management of a subdivided\n\nproperty. The exclusive right of management which the management corporation has seems to\n\nme to be more closely analogous to the situation of an exclusive right over land granted\n\nby a landowner than to a trading situation.63. The question is whether the MC is in a quasi-public position. Mr\n\nSingh’s argument was that since a management corporation owes its existence to the\n\nAct and has powers and functions conferred on it by statute, it does stand in a\n\nquasi-public position. He submitted that the MC in this case was clearly exercising\n\nstatutory powers when it was faced with the decision whether or not to approve De\n\nBeers’ request for division. I find it difficult to accept that argument because it\n\nconfuses the derivation of a management corporation’s powers with the purpose of such\n\npowers. Each management corporation’s powers are given to it purely to regulate the\n\nrights of a small body of private individuals inter se in relation to a piece of private\n\nproperty which they own in common ie the common property of their subdivided building.\n\nVis--vis the management corporation the subsidiary proprietors are not members of the\n\npublic or even a section of the public, they are the constituent parts of the management\n\ncorporation itself and the people that the corporation serves. The authority that that\n\nbody exercises is exercised on behalf of all subsidiary proprietors for their common\n\nbenefit in relation to their private property and is the power of managing and maintaining\n\nprivate property. In my view, even though the management corporation’s powers are\n\nconferred on them by statute, this does not put the management corporation into the\n\nposition of a ‘quasi-public’ authority.64. Accordingly, I consider that thecolore officiiprinciple\n\ncannot be applied to the present case. De Beers also cited the case ofWoolwich\n\nEquitable Building Society v Commissioners of Inland Revenue[1993] AC 70 which\n\ncontained a detailed review of thecolore officiiline of cases and extended the\n\nprinciple of those cases so as to allow a building society to recover tax payments which\n\nhad been levied on it pursuant to legislation which turned out to be ultra vires, although\n\nthe payments were made voluntarily rather than by reason of compulsion imposed by the\n\nrevenue authority. That case does not assist De Beers as the law lords there were dealing\n\nwith the circumstances in which recovery of money exacted from a citizen under an unlawful\n\ndemand by a public authority were permitted. It was held that the law of restitution\n\nshould be reformulated so as to recognise a prima facie right of recovery based solely on\n\npayment of money pursuant to an ultra vires demand by a public authority and that it was\n\nnot relevant in such inquiry whether the payment had been made under a mistake of fact or\n\nunder compulsion. Their lordships did not need to, nor did they, discuss whether the\n\nprinciple could be extended to a party like the MC which has exclusive power to approve or\n\nprevent certain activities related to the use of private property but which is not even a\n\nquasi-public body.65. Interestingly enough, Lord Goff also delineated the difference\n\nbetween thecolore officiiline of cases and cases like the present in his judgment\n\ninKleinwort Benson:‘The first observation is that, in our law of restitution, we now\n\n  find two separate and distinct regimes in respect of the repayment of money made under a\n\n  mistake of law. These are (1) cases concerned with repayment of taxes and other similar\n\n  charges which, when exacted ultra vires, are recoverable as of right at common law on the\n\n  principle inWoolwich, and otherwise are the subject of statutory regimes\n\n  regulating recovery; and (2) other cases, which may be broadly described as concerned with\n\n  repayment of money paid under private transactions, and which are governed by the common\n\n  law.’ (at p 1122)Now that the common law recognises the recoverability of payments made\n\nunder a mistake of law there is no excuse, if indeed there ever could have been a good\n\nexcuse, to stretch the definition of a ‘quasi-public authority’ to cover\n\norganisations like the management corporation which exist for strictly private purposes.",
        "(vi) Is De Beers’ claim time barred?": "66. Limitation of actions is entirely a statutory matter. The common\n\nlaw does not provide for explicit periods within which actions must be commenced. Under\n\ncommon law, a suit may be started decades after the cause of action arose. Equity has,\n\nhowever, provided through the doctrine of laches a defence for defendants who are sued\n\nafter a substantial length of time has lapsed from the events giving rise to the suit.\n\nEven so, the situation was not considered satisfactory and the legislature therefore\n\nremedied it by passing legislation to provide for various periods of limitation for\n\nvarious causes of action. Thus, to find out whether a particular cause of action is time\n\nbarred and when such time bar accrued, one must look within the confines of the Limitation\n\nAct (Cap 163).67. In this case, it is contended by the MC that De Beers should have\n\ncommenced action within six years of making the respective payments to the MC. If this is\n\ncorrect, it would mean that De Beers’ claim for return of the sum of $200,000 would\n\nhave been time barred in January 1998 and its claim for the return of $170,000 would have\n\nbeen time barred in August 1999. De Beers’ counterclaim in this action was first\n\nfiled on 27 March 2001 some time after both those dates.68. The period of six years is submitted to be applicable by virtue of\n\ns 6 of the Limitation Act. The relevant sub-sections are:‘6 (1) Subject to this Act, the following actions shall not be\n\n  brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action\n\n  accrued:(a) actions founded on a contract or on tort;’and‘(7) Subject to sections 22 and 32, this section shall apply to\n\n  all claims for specific performance of a contract or for an injunction or for other\n\n  equitable relief whether the same be founded upon any contract or tort or upon any trust\n\n  or other ground in equity.’69. The submission made by Mr Sim was that the counterclaim for the sum\n\nof $370,000 based on the cause of action of monies had and received was an action founded\n\non a contract. He submitted that the parties had entered into two contracts and De Beers\n\nmust rely on the fact of the existence of these two contracts for their claim to recover\n\nthe sum of $370,000. Even if the contracts were unlawful, the counterclaim would still be\n\nan action founded on a contract. Counsel cited the case ofChing Mun Fong v Liu Cho\n\nChit[2000] 4 SLR 610where Woo Bih Li JC held that the claim\n\nthere for monies had and received was founded on an oral contract even though the subject\n\nmatter of the contract did not materialise.70. In this case I have already found that there were no contracts\n\nexisting between the MC and De Beers in relation to the two payments. The payments were\n\nlevied by the MC as contributions to the costs of lift renewal and common property\n\nmaintenance. In so doing, the MC was acting pursuant to its role as manager of the common\n\nproperty. It was not acting as a party to a commercial transaction. If the payments were\n\nnot made pursuant to a contract, it would be difficult to categorise the claim for\n\nrestitution as being ‘founded on a contract’. Mr Sim, however, pointed to 29\n\nof the counterclaim where De Beers pleaded that the MC had been unjustly enriched in the\n\namounts of $370,000 and accordingly, their counterclaim against the MC was for that sum\n\nbeing money recoverable from the MC as monies had and received. InChing Mun\n\nFong’scase, Woo Bih Li JC opined that the cause of action for monies had and\n\nreceived was based on a contract and accordingly s 6(1)(a) would apply to that cause of\n\naction. Mr Sim relied on that view (especially as the Court of Appeal upheld the\n\njudge’s reasoning on the limitation point) for his submission that likewise De\n\nBeers’ cause of action here was within s 6(1)(a).71. The relevant passages from the judgment of Woo Bih Li JC are at\n\n71 to 74:‘71 As the Court of Appeal has found that Mdm Lim never had an\n\n  interest in the property, the causes of action based on total failure of consideration and\n\n  on moneys had and received would arise when the moneys paid were deposited into Liu’s\n\n  account sometime on or about 23 April 1981 and would be time-barred by about 22 April\n\n  1987.72 I am of the view that such causes of action are ‘founded on a\n\n  contract’ for the purpose of s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163) which states:…73 The moneys which are the subject of this action were paid pursuant\n\n  to the oral contract to purchase Mdm Lim’s interest. The claim for moneys had and\n\n  received are also founded on the oral contract in that it was not as though the moneys\n\n  were received on a basis apart from the oral contract. In addition, the words\n\n  ‘founded on a contract’ are wide enough to cover claims for the recovery of\n\n  moneys paid pursuant to a contract where the underlying subject matter of the agreement\n\n  did not exist or did not materialise.74 In any event, even if, for the sake of argument, these causes of\n\n  action can be said to be founded upon some equitable principle of restitution, they would\n\n  then come under s 6(7) of the Limitation Act …’72. When Woo Bih Li JC’s dicta is viewed in the context of the\n\nrelevant passages and not in isolation, it can be seen that in the case before him he had\n\nto deal with a contract for the purchase of property which had not been performed because\n\nof a lack of the necessary proprietary interest. In that situation, the claims for money\n\nhad and received and for total failure of consideration logically sprang out of the\n\npre-existing contract. Whilst a claim for total failure of consideration must always\n\nspring out of a contract, the same does not necessarily apply to a claim for money had and\n\nreceived which can also have a restitutionary basis. With due respect to JC Woo, as can be\n\nseen from the discussion hereunder, the claim in restitution arises at common law and not\n\nin equity.73. Mr Singh’s submission was that ss 6(1)(a) and (7) are not apt\n\nto cover the situation of a claim for restitution of monies had and received by reason of\n\na mistake where the mistake is not connected with any contract. He submitted that the\n\nclaim for restitution is an independent claim arising at common law and is quite separate\n\nfrom a claim arising out of a contract. The action is based instead on the restitutionary\n\nprinciple of unjust enrichment.74. InKleinwort Bensonitself the House of Lords had to\n\nconsider whether the claim before them was an action ‘relating to a contract’.\n\nThis issue arose not in the context of limitation but in that of jurisdiction because it\n\nwas alleged that under the relevant statute, the English court had no jurisdiction to hear\n\nthe action as it was an action relating to a contract. Despite the dissimilar context, the\n\nconclusion of the judges there that claims for restitution are usually, though not always,\n\nindependent claims based on the principle of undue enrichment rather than claims based on\n\ncontract, is pertinent. The reasoning is shown in the following extracts:‘That question is whether the claim of Kleinwort to restitution of\n\n  the sums paid by it to Glasgow under a contract accepted to be void ab initio falls within\n\n  art 5(1).I have to confess that I find it very difficult to see how such a claim\n\n  can fall within art 5(1). It can only do so if it can properly be said to be based upon a\n\n  particular contractual obligation, the place of performance of which is within the\n\n  jurisdiction of the court. Where however, as here, the claim is for the recovery of money\n\n  paid under a supposed contract which in law never existed, it seems impossible to say that\n\n  the claim for the recovery of the money is based upon a particular contractual obligation.In truth, the claim in the present case is simply a claim to\n\n  restitution, which in English law is based upon the principle of unjust enrichment; and\n\n  claims of this kind do not per se fall within art 5(1). It is not necessary for the\n\n  purposes of the present case to hold that a claim to restitution can never fall within art\n\n  5(1). Very exceptionally, there may be particular circumstances in which it can properly\n\n  be said, at least in cases arising under the convention, that the claim in question,\n\n  although a claim to restitution, is nevertheless based on a contractual obligation and so\n\n  falls within the article. This is a point to which I will return at a later stage. But no\n\n  such circumstances arise in the vast majority of claims to restitution, which are founded\n\n  simply upon the principle of unjust enrichment. Such is, in my opinion, the present case.\n\n  No express provision is made in art 5 in respect of claims for unjust enrichment as\n\n  such;’ (per Lord Goff at p 649):75. Similarly, Lord Clyde observed (at p 665) that:‘The claim which is being made by Kleinwort in the present case is\n\n  simply and solely a claim for restitution. That is not a claim based on a contract but a\n\n  claim based on the principle of undue enrichment. The remedy of restitution is in a\n\n  category distinct from that of contractual remedies. That appears to be the position not\n\n  only in England and Scotland but also in at least a number of the other states in Europe.\n\n  That the parties purported to enter into a contract which turned out to be void ab initio\n\n  is matter of background history, too remote from the claim now made to be related to a\n\n  contract in the sense intended by art 5(1), even if what is now agreed to be a void\n\n  contract can properly be called a contract at all. In the present case the plaintiffs do\n\n  not seek to found on any contract; indeed their claim is one which is pursued in the\n\n  absence of any contract. There is no contractual obligation forming the basis of their\n\n  claim.’76. Lord Hutton said (at p 665):‘The claim of Kleinwort in its writ of summons is for restitution\n\n  and there is no claim in contract. In English law it is clear that a claim for restitution\n\n  is a separate and distinct cause of action from a claim in contract. InFibrosa Spolka\n\n  Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd[1942] 2 All ER 122 at 135,[1943] AC 32\n\n  at 61 Lord Wright stated:\"It is clear that any civilised system of law is bound to provide\n\n    remedies for cases of what has been called unjust enrichment or unjust benefit, that is to\n\n    prevent a man from retaining the money of or some benefit derived from another which it is\n\n    against conscience that he should keep. Such remedies in English law are generically\n\n    different from remedies in contract or in tort, and are now recognised to fall within a\n\n    third category of the common law which has been called quasi-contract or\n\n    restitution.\"InWestdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London BC[1996] 2 All ER 961 at 993, [1996] AC 669 at 710 Lord Browne-Wilkinson stated:\"The common law restitutionary claim is based not on implied\n\n  contract but on unjust enrichment: in the circumstances the law imposes an obligation to\n\n  repay rather than implying an entirely fictitious agreement to repay: [His Lordship then\n\n  cited several cases] … In my judgment, your Lordships should now unequivocally and\n\n  finally reject the concept that the claim for moneys had and received is based on an\n\n  implied contract. I would overruleSinclair v Broughamon this point.\"Therefore in English law the action brought by Kleinwort against\n\nGlasgow is not a claim in contract.’77. I accept, with respect, the above statements of law. De Beers\n\nfounded its claim in restitution. I have held that no contract arose or was capable of\n\narising in the circumstances. The claim brought by De Beers cannot therefore be founded on\n\na contract whether the word ‘founded’ is used in a strict or a liberal sense.\n\nAccordingly, the claim does not fall within s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act.78. The other proposition put forward by the MC was that the claim fell\n\nwithin s 6(7) of the Limitation Act because it was a claim for equitable relief founded\n\nupon a ground in equity. On this basis, a six-year limitation period would be applicable\n\nas well. This proposition cannot be accepted, however, because the restitutionary claim\n\nfor recovery of monies paid under a mistake is not founded in equity. This was clearly\n\nestablished by Lord Wright in theFibrosa Spolka Akcyjnacase. The relevant passage\n\nfrom his judgment is cited in the quotation from Lord Hutton that I have set out in 76.\n\nLord Browne-Wilkinson endorsed this view in theWestdeutsche Landesbank Girozentralecase\n\ncited in the same passage. Since the restitutionary claim has been classified as a common\n\nlaw claim, it does not fall within s 6(7).79. Accordingly, I hold that De Beers’ claim for restitution of\n\npayments made under a mistake of law is not time barred. Until the legislature intervenes,\n\nit would appear that there is no applicable limitation period for restitutionary claims\n\nwhich have no grounding in contract.",
        "(vii) Who is responsible to maintain the roof?": "80. The legal issue here is whether the roof above the 18 units is\n\ncommon property. Section 3 of the Act states, inter alia,:‘ \"Common property\" – …(b) in relation to any subdivided building which is comprised in any\n\n  plan approved by the relevant authority other than a plan bearing the title\n\n  \"condominium\", means so much of the land for the time being not comprised in any\n\n  lot shown in a strata title plan; and(c) unless otherwise described specifically as comprised in any lot in\n\n  a strata title plan and shown as capable of being comprised in such lot, includes –(i) foundations, columns, beams, supports, walls, roofs, … of the\n\n      building …’81. The evidence showed that the roof above the 18 units was not\n\nreflected originally in the strata title plan for the four penthouse units as being part\n\nof any or all of those lots. Further, after subdivision the roof above the 18 units was\n\nnot reflected in the new strata title plan as being part of any or all of the new 18 lots.\n\nIn fact, the roof was not built as roof for specific units: it was built as a roof for the\n\ntower block of the complex. Originally, the roof was flat and when Mr Ho occupied the\n\npenthouses, he maintained it at his own expense. When De Beers came along, they proposed\n\nchanging the roof to a pitched roof as this type of structure is preferable from the point\n\nof view of preventing leakage. The fact that De Beers reconstructed the roof as a pitched\n\nroof did not turn it into private property. It remained the common property it had always\n\nbeen.82. As the roof was common property, its maintenance was at all times\n\nthe responsibility of the MC. Mr Wong admitted in court that under the Act, it was the\n\nMC’s duty to maintain the roof. He further testified that the reason the MC wanted De\n\nBeers to maintain it was to try and maintain the status quo ie the position whereby the\n\nowner of the top-most units in the tower block maintained the roof. Whatever Mr Ho may\n\nhave done on a voluntary basis, however, could not justify the MC imposing this\n\nresponsibility on De Beers. The Act is quite clear. The persons who ran the MC were aware\n\nof its provisions. They had no business trying to pass the buck to De Beers as a condition\n\nfor approval of its subdivision plans. I am somewhat surprised that the lawyers acting for\n\nDe Beers at the time did not point this out but seem to have co-operated to try to give\n\neffect to the MC’s unlawful condition.83. As Mr Singh submitted, what the MC sought to do in the present case\n\nwas to abdicate their statutory duty. The court cannot assist them in this. It must\n\ndeclare this condition to be unlawful and of no effect. There is no question of limitation\n\nin relation to the roof since the condition imposed is an on-going one and the reliefs\n\nasked for by De Beers are declarations as to the present legal position.",
        "(viii) Defences available to the MC": "84. The MC raised the following defences to De Beers’ claim:(a) laches;(b) estoppel; and(c) change of position.",
        "(ix) Laches": "85. The MC submitted that even if the Limitation Act did not apply, the\n\ndefence of laches was available to them on the facts. Mr Sim maintained that De Beers was\n\nguilty of prolonged, inordinate and inexcusable delay in bringing their claim. He relied\n\non the following events:(1) at the extraordinary general meeting of the MC held on 29 September\n\n  1992 in order to approve the proposals for the modernisation of the lift system, De Beers\n\n  chose not to raise any issue on the sum of $200,000 that they had already paid for this\n\n  purpose;(2) when sued on 21 September 1993 for outstanding maintenance and\n\n  sinking fund contributions, De Beers did not raise the issue either;(3) when in 1996, the MC registered a charge against the 18 maisonette\n\n  units to obtain security for the unpaid maintenance and sinking fund contributions, De\n\n  Beers did not raise this issue;(4) when Mr Lim asked De Beers about paying the outstanding arrears\n\n  during the financial crisis of 1997/1998, again De Beers was silent;(5) when Mr Lim spoke to Mr Ow before the letter of demand dated 9\n\n  November 2000 which preceded the present suit, De Beers was silent; and(6) on 21 November 2000, De Beers paid $10,000 towards the outstanding\n\n  maintenance charges and said they would pay the claim later.86. Mr Sim submitted that considering that there was a potential\n\ndispute over a substantial payment amounting to $370,000, it was inexcusable that De Beers\n\nchose not to enquire about the facts or the law or to protest or complain for so many\n\nyears.87. According toThe Law of Restitution:‘… laches [is] an equitable doctrine which defeats stale\n\n    demands where a party has slept upon his rights. Equity adopts no fixed time-bar, but\n\n    considers the circumstances of each case in determining whether there is delay amounting\n\n    to laches. \"Two circumstances, always important in such cases, are the length of the\n\n    delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval, which might affect either party\n\n    and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the other\",\n\n    in particular, the prejudice to the defendants caused by the conduct of the plaintiff. If\n\n    the defendant has suffered substantial prejudice, he need not prove that that prejudice\n\n    was caused by the delay.’ (at p 846)There are thus two ingredients to be considered: the length of the\n\ndelay and secondly, whether such delay has caused prejudice or injustice.88. In considering the first factor of the length of delay, it is\n\nimportant to know when the claimant became aware of his right to claim restitution. InBeale\n\nv Kyte[1907] 1 Ch 564, Neville J said:‘But, further than that, in all cases of mistake in order that\n\n  laches or acquiescence may be a defence there must be notice of the error, and time runs\n\n  from the date of the notice and not from the time when the errors is committed; and it is\n\n  inconceivable to my mind that on a question of laches time can run from the time the\n\n  mistake was committed. It seems to me it must run from the time when the plaintiff’s\n\n  attention is first called to the error.’ (at p566)89. Similarly inRees v De Bernardy[1896] 2 Ch 437, Romer J\n\nopined:‘But it is said that the right to rescind has been lost by the\n\n  delay of the two women and by their acting on the agreement made and permitting the\n\n  defendant to receive the half of certain moneys recovered in respect of the property. Now,\n\n  I take it to be a rule of the Court in cases of this kind, that where a person has once a\n\n  right to rescind a contract he does not lose that right merely by acting upon it or by\n\n  delay in impeaching it, so long as he remains in ignorance of his right and the position\n\n  of parties remains substantially the same.’ (at p 445)90. In the present case, Mr Ow’s evidence was that he was entirely\n\nunaware that the MC’s demands were unlawful until he consulted his present solicitors\n\nafter commencement of this action. He had had previous solicitors dealing with the\n\nprevious claim and also with the strata subdivision and the registration of the covenant\n\nin respect of maintenance of the roof but had not been advised by these solicitors of the\n\npossibility that the demands were unlawful. It was submitted on De Beers’ behalf that\n\ntime would not run against them because of their ignorance and that any delay in the\n\nprosecution of their claim arose solely from such ignorance.91. As regards prejudice, the submission was that neither in their\n\npleadings nor their witnesses’ affidavits of evidence-in-chief, had the MC explained\n\nhow the alleged delay in the prosecution of De Beers’ claims had prejudiced them. I\n\nagree. It appears to me that the MC would have incurred the same expenditure on the lift\n\nsystem whether or not De Beers had agreed to pay the $200,000. This was because the lift\n\nsystem was old, complaints had been received and it was the advice of the experts\n\nSchindler that led to the MC’s proposals for modernisation. Further, when the matter\n\nwas put before the general meeting for approval, De Beers did not inform the subsidiary\n\nproprietors of the $200,000 donation. They were not influenced by that donation therefore\n\nwhen they approved the expenditure. The situation might well have been different if they\n\nhad known about the donation and had agreed to the upgrading on the basis that the levies\n\non them would have been reduced by reason of the donation. As regards the maintenance of\n\nthe new common corridor, I was not shown any evidence of the expenditure incurred by the\n\nMC and that this was more than they had anticipated. Further, the MC had an avenue to\n\nrecover such expenditure under s 42(5). The fact that they did not use that avenue but\n\npreferred to levy their own (illegal) charge is what has led to the possibility of having\n\nto regurgitate the same. It is not even certain that they may not be able to recover from\n\nDe Beers the maintenance costs they have already incurred. It may very well be that a levy\n\nthat includes a component to represent costs already incurred would be approved\n\nsubsequently by the Commissioner of Buildings. In any case there is nothing to stop the MC\n\nfrom now following the procedure set out in s 42(5) in order to make the proprietors of\n\nthe 18 units pay the on-going costs of maintaining the corridor.92. I note that De Beers kept silent for a considerable period of time.\n\nAs far as the complaints relating to 1992 are concerned, there is ample evidence to show\n\nthat at that time Mr Ow believed the demands to be lawful. He acted on that belief in 1993\n\nwhen he made payment of the second sum. His inaction thereafter was consistent with the\n\ncontinuing mistake under which he operated. This was a mistake that was shared by the MC\n\nand there was nothing that alerted him to the true situation. It is also true that had he\n\nsought advice earlier, say in 1996 or 1997, he might very well have been advised that\n\nsince the mistake that he had made was one of law, recovery was impossible in any case.\n\nEven De Beers’ present solicitors did not realise until very late in the day that\n\nrestitution on the ground of mistake was a cause of action that had become open to De\n\nBeers.93. I find accordingly, that De Beers is not barred on the ground of\n\nlaches.",
        "(x) Estoppel": "94. The MC argued that estoppel was available as a defence because the\n\nthree conditions necessary to raise an estoppel were satisfied. These conditions are\n\nrepresentation, reliance, and change of position. I disagree. The essential element of\n\nrepresentation is absent here.95. Let me examine the assertions in relation to representation. First,\n\nas regards the payment of $200,000, the following are said to constitute representations\n\nby De Beers that that payment was not unlawful:(1) De Beers’ agreement that their conversion plans would result\n\n  in increased usage of the lifts and their consequent agreement to contribute towards the\n\n  cost of modernisation;(2) the fact that on 14 April 1989 De Beers signed an agreement\n\n  undertaking to pay $200,000 to modernise lifts;(3) the actual payment by De Beers;(4) the verbal reminder by Mr Ow on 23 July 1993 when he was trying to\n\n  get a reduction in the maintenance contribution that De Beers had already paid $200,000\n\n  and the written repetition of that contention in a letter dated 30 July 1993; and(5) the failure by De Beers to raise the issue of the payment of\n\n  $200,000 as a defence to the MC’s action in September 1992 for the sum of $130,138.15\n\n  being arrears in contributions levied.6. I cannot see how any of the above could qualify as a representation\n\nthat the payment made was a lawful one. The above incidents show De Beers’ acceptance\n\nat that time of the lawfulness of the imposition. They do not show that the MC was in any\n\ndoubt about the situation or that they had to be persuaded by De Beers that what was being\n\ndone was correct. The citation of these incidents also overlooks one prime fact that was\n\nthat the requests for such payments emanated from the MC. There was abundant evidence that\n\nit was the MC that decided on the impost not De Beers.97. As regards the sum of $170,000, again counsel cited various\n\nincidents that showed De Beers’ acceptance of the situation and their agreement to\n\nmake the contribution. Once again, these occasions were said to constitute representations\n\nthat the payment was not unlawful. I do not accept this submission for the reasons given\n\nin 95. They apply equally to the imposition of the $170,000.",
        "(xi) Change of position": "98. Change of position is a distinct defence to a claim for\n\nrestitution. It was recognised inLipkin Gorman v Karpnale[1991] 2 AC 548 that\n\nthis defence was wider than estoppel because it did not depend on any breach of duty or\n\nmisrepresentation by the payee.99. Mr Sim submitted that even if De Beers had a cause of action for\n\nmoney had or received, it was outweighed by the injustice caused if the MC was asked to\n\nrepay the $370,000. He argued that De Beers had obtained the fruit of their bargain and it\n\nwould be unconscionable for them to obtain these benefits and then be allowed to recover\n\nthe monies paid for the benefits. The MC was saddled with liabilities in modernising the\n\nlifts and maintaining the additional common property. Grave injustice would result if the\n\nMC had to repay the monies.100. The Court of Appeal has commented on the availability of the\n\ndefence of change of position. It observed inSeagate Technology Pte Ltd v Goh Han Kim[1995] 1 SLR 17(at p 29):‘We agree with the learned judicial commissioner that this defence\n\n  is available in our jurisdiction. The availability depends on whether the defendant’s\n\n  position has so changed that it would be inequitable in all the circumstances to require\n\n  him to make restitution or restitution in full to the plaintiffs. What is relevant here is\n\n  whether any inequity might result from an order to make restitution. Importantly, the\n\n  inequity itself must arise from the defendant’s change of position, and in this all\n\n  the circumstances relating to the change of position should be taken into consideration. A\n\n  circumstance crucial to the availability of the defence of change of position is the bona\n\n  fides of the defendant. It was not merely a change of position but a \"bona fide\n\n  change of position\" which Lord Goff considered as a good defence. His Lordship said,\n\n  at p 580:\"It is, of course, plain that the defence is not open to one who\n\n    has changed his position in bad faith, as where the defendant has paid away the money with\n\n    knowledge of the facts entitling the plaintiff to restitution; and it is commonly accepted\n\n    that the defence should not be open to a wrongdoer.\"The above extract makes it clear that knowledge of the facts entitling\n\n  the plaintiff to restitution would bring the defendant’s bona fides into question and\n\n  disentitle him from relying on this defence.’101. In my view, the MC is not entitled to rely on this defence. They\n\nhave not been able to substantiate any change in position. In the first place, the\n\nupgrading of the residential lifts in the complex was not, as I have stated in 87 above,\n\ndue to De Beers’ subdivision plans. The fact is that the lift system was outmoded and\n\nneeded replacement. Secondly, it was the wrongful demand from the MC that led De Beers to\n\npay them the $200,000. As the authorities cited show, the MC cannot rely on their own\n\nwrongdoing to justify a change in position. Thirdly, the further condition regarding the\n\npayment of $170,000 was also unlawful and there was no evidence presented substantiating\n\nthe use of the same for the maintenance of the common corridor. There was no evidence\n\neither that this sum was used for any other purpose or that such expenditure would not\n\nhave been incurred had the sum not been paid. Fourthly, as regards the roof, there can be\n\nno defence of change of position since the responsibility for the roof remained the\n\nMC’s at all times and it was not legally entitled to impose this responsibility on\n\nanyone else.",
        "(xii) Interest": "102. The MC has claimed post-judgment interest on the outstanding\n\nmanagement fund and sinking fund contributions and on the special levy at ten percent per\n\nannum. This claim is based on resolutions passed at meetings of the MC and these\n\nresolutions were passed pursuant to powers conferred on the MC by s 42(10)(b) of the Act.\n\nPost-judgment they are entitled to simple interest at ten percent per annum on all\n\nmanagement fund and sinking fund contributions levied on or after 29 March 1995 and not\n\npaid within 30 days of such levy. They are also entitled to similar simple interest on the\n\namounts payable as part of the special levy authorised by the extraordinary general\n\nmeeting of 8 July 1997. I would like the MC to give me a breakdown of the judgment sum\n\nthat De Beers has been ordered to pay so that I can ascertain how much of that is interest\n\nand how much represents the unpaid contributions and levies. I will then approve an order\n\nrelating to the calculation and payment of post-judgment interest on the basis of what I\n\nhave stated above.103. The other issue is what interest should be awarded to De Beers in\n\nrespect of the amounts wrongfully obtained from them. These amounts were paid in January\n\n1992 and August 1993 respectively. The MC has had the benefit of these sums for a\n\nconsiderable period and De Beers has been out of pocket for the same period. It must be\n\ncompensated for the loss of use of the funds. I order the MC to pay De Beers simple\n\ninterest on the amounts of $200,000 and $170,000 at the rate of five percent per annum\n\nfrom the respective dates falling one month after the date of each payment up till the\n\nmonth of June 1995. From June 1995 up to date of payment, interest shall be calculated at\n\nthe rate of ten percent per annum ie at the same rate as that which the MC is entitled to\n\ncollect.Conclusion104. I make the following orders:(1) the defendants shall pay the plaintiffs post-judgment interest at\n\n  the rate of ten percent per annum on the outstanding contributions and levies, the exact\n\n  form of the order to be approved by me after the plaintiffs have presented me with their\n\n  calculations;(2) the plaintiffs shall repay the defendants the sum of $370,000 with\n\n  interest at the rates and for the periods stated in 103 above;(3) there shall be a declaration that it is the plaintiffs and not the\n\n  defendants who are legally obliged to maintain the roof above the 18 units at #31-987 to\n\n  #31-1004, People's Park Complex; and(4) there shall be a declaration that the defendants are not legally\n\n  obliged to register any covenant in respect of any of the 18 subsidiary strata\n\n  certificates of title for the 18 units known as #31-987 to #31-1004, People's Park Complex\n\n  to the effect that the subsidiary proprietors thereof shall maintain, at their own cost,\n\n  the roofs directly above the 18 units.As for costs, I would like to hear the parties on what adjustments, if\n\nany, should be made to reflect the fact that the defendants have succeeded on mistake\n\nwhich was a late amendment to their counterclaim and failed on the doctrine ofcolore\n\nofficiiwhich was the original basis of their claim.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
