        "Introduction": "1       This case is one of those that lie at the crossroads of criminal law and contract law. Can a non-reliance clause negate the element of inducement required to establish an offence of cheating? This is one of the many issues that arose in these cross-appeals from the decision of the District Judge (“the DJ”) inPublic Prosecutor v Timothy Nicholas Goldring, Geraldine Anthony Thomas and John Andrew Nordmann[2014] SGDC 422 (“GD”). 2       Three accused persons, Timothy Nicholas Goldring (“Goldring”), Geraldine Anthony Thomas (“Geraldine”) and John Andrew Nordmann (“Nordmann”), were charged with 86 counts of conspiring to cheat by inducing delivery of property under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”). They claimed trial to 18 charges and the other 68 charges were stood down. After the trial, Geraldine was acquitted in respect of her charges. Goldring and Nordmann (collectively the “Appellants”) were convicted on those 18 charges (which were amended to delete the references to Geraldine) and sentenced to seven and eight years’ imprisonment respectively. Both Appellants have appealed against their convictions and sentences while the Prosecution has cross-appealed against the Appellants’ sentences. The Prosecution also appealed against Geraldine’s acquittal but that appeal has been discontinued.[note: 1] 3       After reserving my decision, I now dismiss all the appeals for the reasons set out in this judgment.",
        "Background facts": "4       The Appellants were directors and shareholders of Profitable Plots Pte Ltd (“PPPL”). PPPL was incorporated in Singapore in 2005 and it generally offered land investment opportunities. Its repertoire of products grew in 2008 when it introduced an array of fuel additives and lubricants (“Boron Products”). These Boron Products were produced by an American company, Advanced Lubrication Technology Inc (“ALT”), which gave exclusive distributorship rights in certain territories to Profitable Group Limited (“PG Dubai”), a Dubai-incorporated company whose directors and shareholders included the Appellants. This agreement obligated PG Dubai to purchase a minimum amount of Boron Products each year for four years (it was US$2.5m for the year beginning October 2008). As PG Dubai had no staff, active business or physical address, Goldring executed an agreement for PPPL to market and sell the Boron Products. Around that time, PPPL also acquired a UK company, Vawtech Ltd (“Vawtech”), which held the exclusive distributorship rights for Boron Products in UK. 5       For the purported purpose of funding inventory purchases of Boron Products, PPPL introduced an investment scheme in November 2008 called the “Boron Scheme”. Each investment unit was $1,000 and investors were promised a return of 12.5% on the principal amount invested within a maximum of six months from the date of investment. When the Boron Scheme was marketed to the public, there were two representations that were made and which were false, namely, that the money invested would beused exclusivelyto finance the purchase of Boron Products and that the Boron Products had beenpre-soldto major corporations (respectively the “Exclusive Use Representation” and “Pre-Sold Representation” and collectively the “Representations”). Both Representations were communicated to the investors mostly via sales agents using various means including a set of presentation slides (the “Boron Slides”) and a marketing brochure (the “Boron Brochure”). There were three versions of the Boron Brochure dated November 2008, May 2009 and September 2009 respectively. The second version merely changed the investment quantum from US$1,000 to US$10,000 and the third changed the maturity period from six months to twelve. In addition to these materials, there was also a set of scripted answers to frequently asked questions (“Boron Scripts”) prepared by Nordmann and made available to sales agents, although not many used them. 6       Generally, to invest in the Boron Scheme, each investor had to fill in a Product Request Form (“PRF”) indicating the product and the quantity he or she was interested in. The investor would then deliver money to PPPL (or another Profitable Group entity) or convert an existing investment to a Boron Scheme investment or do a combination of both. In turn, he or she would receive a Transfer of Title form (“TB1”) which served as the contract. The counterparty named in the TB1 was the inactive entity, PG Dubai. 7       The investors referred to in the 18 proceeded charges (“the Investors”) were given and did rely on the Representations before investing in the Boron Scheme. The Investors invested in their own names, except for two (the details of whom I will elaborate on later). 8       At the end of the six-month window, the Investors failed to receive their returns as promised. Some were told that the company was waiting for certain pieces of land in the Philippines to be sold. Others were told that their investments were with PG Dubai and that PPPL was merely the marketing agent. They did not receive their investment monies back. Eventually, complaints were made and the Appellants were charged with conspiring to cheat.",
        "Proceedings below": "9       It was the Prosecution’s case that the Appellants, knowing that the Representations were false, conveyed or authorised others to convey them to the Investors. The charges against the Appellants on which the Prosecution proceeded (before they were amended upon the acquittal of Geraldine) were similarly framed. They read (with the necessary modifications): “… are charged that you, between November 2008 to August 2010, in Singapore, being a director of Profitable Plots Pte Ltd (“the Company”), did engage with one [John Andrew Nordmann or Timothy Nicholas Goldring] and one Geraldine Anthony Thomas in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, namely, to cheat the customers of an investment scheme promoted by the Company (“the Boron Scheme”), in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, to wit, [on various dates] the Company, on your authorisation, represented to [an Investor] that money to be invested by [him or her] through an investment scheme offered by the company (“the Boron Scheme”), would be used exclusively to finance the purchase of Boron CLS Bond products that has purportedly been pre-sold to major corporations, which representation you knew to be untrue, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said [Investor] into delivering a total sum equivalent to [the sum invested] to the Company to be invested in the Boron Scheme for a return of 12.5% within a maximum of 6 months, which [the Investor] would not have done if [he or she] was not so deceived, and which act was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 109 read with Section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Revised Edition).” 10     At trial, Goldring and Geraldine elected to remain silent. Nordmann tried to distance himself from the Representations and the Boron Scheme. According to him, the Boron Scheme was the product of a discussion between John Gaunt and James Hodgson. John Gaunt was hired in September 2008 as PPPL’s CEO to optimise PPPL’s business at a time where it had diverse business interests. The sale of Boron Products was one of his responsibilities. However, he was fired in July 2009 by Goldring allegedly because he had not delivered the performance expected of him. James Hodgson was the marketing director and a director of PPPL from 2006 until May 2009, when he was removed at an extraordinary general meeting. It was alleged that James Hodgson instructed Cedric de Souza (the marketing manager) to add the Representations into the Boron Brochure without Nordmann’s knowledge. 11     The DJ rejected Nordmann’s defence. With regard to the two Appellants, he found that the three essential elements of cheating had been established beyond reasonable doubt (GD at [409]). First, the element of deception was satisfied because both Representations were false and the 18 Investors were deceived by the cumulative conduct of the Appellants and their agents (ie, PPPL’s sales agents) that the Representations were true. Next, the element of inducement was satisfied because the Representations were among the reasons (even if not the predominant reason) the Investors invested in the Boron Scheme by delivering property to PPPL. Third, the element of dishonest intent was satisfied since the Appellants knew that the Representations were false. Nordmann, in particular, had come up with the Boron Scheme and the contents of the Boron Brochure (GD at [648]–[664]). The DJ was also satisfied that the Appellants had engaged in a conspiracy to cheat by abetment (GD at [544]–[548]). Both approved the Boron Scheme as directors and were directly responsible for setting up the Boron Scheme in various ways. 12     The DJ, however, found that Geraldine had no role in making or authorising the false representations (GD at [686]–[691]). He could not find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she had any knowledge of whether Boron Products were sold before the launch of the Boron Scheme or throughout its duration. While Geraldine was a finance director and a signatory of PG Dubai’s accounts, she acted on the Appellants’ instructions. 13     Accordingly, the DJ convicted the Appellants on their charges but acquitted Geraldine on her charges. He then sentenced Goldring and Nordmann to a total of seven and eight years’ imprisonment respectively. 14     Both the Appellants and the Prosecution, dissatisfied with the DJ’s decision, appealed to the High Court. The Appellants appealed against conviction and sentence while the Prosecution appealed against sentence.",
        "The appeal against conviction": "15     The law on the role of the appellate court in an appeal against conviction is settled. An appellate court may reverse a judgment only if it was wrong in law or against the weight of the evidence (s 394 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”)). In particular, with regard to findings of fact, the Court of Appeal inADF v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2010] 1 SLR 874 summarised at [16]: 16    … an appellate court has alimitedrole when it is asked to assess findings of fact made by the trial court. In summary, the role is circumscribed as follows: (a)    Where the finding of fact hinges on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses based on the demeanour of the witness,the appellate court will interfere only if the finding of fact can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of evidence: seePP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 at [32] andYap Giau Beng Terence v PP[1998] 2 SLR(R) 855 (“Yap Giau Beng[Terence]”) at [24]. An appellate court may also intervene, if, after taking into account all the advantages available to the trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is wrong in law and therefore unreasonable:Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 (“Jagatheesan”) at [43]. (b)    Where the finding of fact by the trial judge is based on the inferences drawn from the internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of witnesses’ testimony or the external consistency between the content of their testimony and the extrinsic evidence, an appellate court is in as good a position as the trial court to assess the veracity of the witness’s evidence. The real tests are how consistent the story is within itself, how it stands the test of cross-examination, and how it fits in with the rest of the evidence and the circumstances of the case: seeJagatheesanat [40].If a decision is inconsistent with the material objective evidence on record, appellate intervention will usually be warranted. (c)An appellate court is as competent as any trial judge to draw any necessary inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case: seeYap Giau Beng Terenceat [24]. [emphasis added]",
        "The arguments": "82     The Appellants argue that the sentences were manifestly excessive on many grounds.[note: 85]However, some arguments were based on facts which, if true, would have overturned the conviction.[note: 86]To that extent, those points need not be considered in their appeals against sentence. Their remaining arguments, in substance, are that: (a)     the Boron Scheme was not entirely a sham;[note: 87] (b)     that some investors received “restitution” or did not lose money to the Boron Scheme;[note: 88]and (c)     the Appellants did not show a lack of remorse by claiming trial, especially since Geraldine was acquitted after trial.[note: 89] 83     In the cross-appeal, the Prosecution argues that the aggregate sentences should be enhanced to 12–14 years’ imprisonment by ordering more sentences to run consecutively.[note: 90]The sentences imposed by the DJ were manifestly inadequate because: (a)     he erred in considering that the investors and losses suffered should be limited to those in the charges proceeded with;[note: 91] (b)     he erred as to the factual matrix, by finding that that the Boron Scheme was not entirely a scam;[note: 92] (c)     he gave insufficient weight to the aggravating factors in general and the lack of mitigating factors;[note: 93]and (d)     he erred in finding that the present case fell between the sentencing markers ofPhang WahandRahj Kamal.[note: 94]",
        "My decision": "84     These arguments can be crystallised into three main issues, namely, whether I should consider the facts beyond the proceeded charges, whether the Boron Scheme was entirely a scam and whether the sentences were manifestly inadequate or excessive considering the sentencing factors and precedents. Whether the number of investors and amount of losses beyond the proceeded charges should be considered 85     The Prosecution submits that the DJ was “wrong andoverly mechanisticin failing to consider the total sum of money collected by PPPL and its affiliated companies as a result of the Boron Scheme”.[note: 95]A total of US$21,293,883 was collected worldwide (of which US$9,553,592 was collected locally in cash) and this formed “part of the overall circumstances surrounding the crime committed” and should be considered as part of the aggravating circumstances. 86     I cannot accept this submission. In my view, the DJ was right to have confined the number of investors and amount of losses to the charges at trial for the purpose of sentencing. 87     Section 148(1) of the CPC provides that if the accused is found guilty of an offence, the court may, when passing sentence, take into consideration other outstanding offences that the accused admits to have committed if both the Prosecution and the accused consent. If this course of action is taken, then the consequence is that the accused may not, unless the conviction for the original offence is set aside, be charged or tried (and therefore sentenced) for any offence which the court had taken into consideration (s 148(5) of the CPC). The rationale is twofold—to punish offences as aggravation and to save judicial time on their trial (Criminal Procedure in Singapore and Malaysia(Tan Yock Lin and S Chandra Mohan gen eds) (LexisNexis, 2012) at ch XVIII, para 4354, approved inLim Hsien Wei v Public Prosecutor[2014] 3 SLR 15 at [25]–[26]perChao Hick Tin JA). 88     The Appellants here did not consent to have the 68 stood down charges taken into consideration for sentencing. This is their prerogative. The consequence is that those charges remain outstanding and untested. If the Prosecution proceeds with those charges and secures convictions on them, the judge will naturally take the amounts in those charges into consideration when considering sentence. The stood down charges are irrelevant in determining the sentences for the charges that were proceeded with (Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP[2014] 2 SLR 998 at [81(g)]perMenon CJ;Chua Tiong Tiong v Public Prosecutor[2001] 2 SLR(R) 515 (“Chua Tiong Tiong”) at [29]). If the DJ had considered the amounts alleged to have been cheated in the stood down charges, he would be pre-judging matters which are not agreed to and which have not been tested. More importantly, should the Appellants be convicted on those charges in a subsequent trial, the judge there will have an impossible task in sentencing the Appellants as they may be said to be punished twice for those offences. 89     The Prosecution submits that the DJ was, in any event, wrong in not considering the amount of US$18,790,383 which was collected under the Boron Scheme but which was not the subject of any charges.[note: 96]Of this amount, US$11,740,291 was collected from overseas investors who, according to the Prosecution, should not be ignored simply because they could not file police reports in Singapore.[note: 97] 90     It is equally clear that the amounts invested which are not the subject of any charges cannot be considered in determining the sentence (Chua Tiong Tiongat [28];Knight Glenn Jeyasingam v Public Prosecutor[1992] 1 SLR(R) 523 at [13]). There is no evidence that those investors were deceived by the use of the Representations into delivering property to PPPL. In fact, some investors may claim, like Nicholas Naresh mentioned above did, that they did not rely on the Representations at all.[note: 98] 91     The Prosecution also submits that even if I did not consider the total amount invested as an aggravating factor, I should take into account the level of public disquiet and the effect on public confidence on Singapore’s investment industry caused by the Boron Scheme.[note: 99]According to the Prosecution, the Securities Investors Association of Singapore (“SIAS”) stepped in to “take up the plight of the investors in the Profitable Plots saga” (David Gerald, “The Profitable Plots Investors’ Plight” <http://sias.org.sg//profitable_plot/>) while the Monetary Authority of Singapore proposed to enhance its regulatory framework partially in response to the Boron Scheme. Apparently, David Gerald further stated that “an estimated 1,500 Singaporeans and 4,000 foreigners are believed to have invested their money with Profitable Plots” and that several foreign investors had invested with PPPL “because it was based [in Singapore], and they were confident about Singapore’s reputation as a financial hub with strict enforcement of regulators” (Yasmine Yahya, “Don’t keep clients in the dark: SIAS”The Straits Times(25 May 2011)).[note: 100] 92     In my view, this submission faces two serious problems. First, the Prosecution’s assertions were fiercely disputed[note: 101]but have not been formally proved. In fact, the Prosecution now seeks to rely on what David Gerald said, despite having objected to an application below by counsel to issue a subpoena against him (on the basis that any evidence he could give would not be relevant).[note: 102]Further, some of these claims are hearsay upon hearsay. Second, the claims of public disquiet and effect on public confidence in these news articles were premised on the total investment amount. This presumed some criminality or impropriety in the entire investment amount, including the amounts which were not the subject of any charge. The Prosecution relied on two authorities to show that the Court can take public disquiet into account (Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [25(c)] andPublic Prosecutor v Wang Ziyi Able[2008] 2 SLR(R) 1082 at [29]). However, neither involved stood down charges which were similar to those which were proceeded with at trial. I therefore do not think it would be fair to sentence the Appellants on the basis that they have caused public disquiet through cheating investors of US$21,293,883, when they have only been convicted of conspiring to cheat a total of US$732,000. It would be fair nevertheless to say that there must have been some disquiet among the Investors in the charges in issue here. 93     Even if the Prosecution were to undertake to withdraw the outstanding charges should they be considered by the court in sentencing, the fact remains that the Appellants have not admitted that they committed those offences. They should therefore not be a factor in the sentencing considerations here. Whether the Boron Scheme was entirely a scam 94     The Prosecution submits the Boron Scheme was a scam in its entirety as the sales of and efforts to market the Boron Products were mere smokescreens which lent a veneer of authenticity to what was in fact a thorough scam. It also argues that the DJ’s comparison withPhang Wahwas unjustified because the investors here (unlike those inPhang Wah) never received any goods or services of value. The Appellants, on the other hand, maintain that the Boron Scheme was not a scam in its entirety. 95     The DJ found that the Boron Scheme was not entirely a scam. The purchases, sales and marketing of the Boron Products, which were said to have lent a veneer of authenticity to the Boron Scheme, could also arguably show that there was some effort to enter the Boron business. However, the paltry sales and the belated and unenthusiastic marketing and technical support efforts for the Boron Products show that any genuine business was but a very small part of the entire scheme. 96     Therefore, I do not think that the DJ was entirely correct in comparing the present case withPhang Wah. InPhang Wah, the investors were involved in a scheme which offered a lifestyle package which included services, rebates, and points which were exchangeable for cash or products; only one rebate (a component of the package akin to a commission for recruiting participants and which had been geared to an unsustainable rate of return) was found to be fraudulent (Public Prosecutor v Phang Wah and others[2010] SGDC 505 (“Phang Wah (DC)”) at [255] and [275]–[304]). However, the Investors here were promised pure monetary returns, not lifestyle benefits. The Investors did not receive any payments or any goods or services of value. Whether the sentences were manifestly inadequate or excessive considering the relevant sentencing factors and precedents 97     The Prosecution argues that there were no mitigating factors and that the DJ gave insufficient weight to the following aggravating factors: (a)     the Boron Scheme was a huge premeditated money circulation scam designed to cheat investors; (b)     the Boron Scheme was deliberately set up in a sophisticated manner to try to avoid civil and criminal liability; (c)     the Boron Scheme claimed many victims and caused sizeable losses; (d)     the Appellants enriched themselves at the victims’ expense; (e)     the Appellants failed to make restitution and their post-offence conduct shows a clear lack of remorse; and (f)     the Appellants’ conduct at trial showed a blatant lack of remorse. 98     The Prosecution also argues that the DJ was wrong to find that the present case fell between the sentencing markers ofPhang WahandRahj Kamal. Instead, the sentences should be in the range of 12–14 years and, in any event, significantly higher than the eight years’ imprisonment inRahj Kamalbecause the present losses of US$732,000 greatly outweighed the loss of $175,000 suffered in that case. 99     The Appellants argue that the sentences were too harsh. I will address their two remaining arguments before turning to the precedents cited by the Prosecution. Whether the Investors received “restitution” 100    The Appellants argue that certain investors either received “restitution” of or did not “lose” the amounts that they invested, in one of the following ways: that they profited from the Boron Scheme or some investments with PPPL, that they were no longer owed anything by the Boron Scheme as they had converted their Boron Scheme investment to a land investment, or that they had invested in the Boron Scheme in apparent violation of PPPL’s policy. Further, they blamed PPPL’s failure on blog entries which they claim destroyed public confidence in PPPL and, consequently, PPPL’s ability to repay investors. 101    In my view, these claims have no mitigation value. None of the Investors here received any money from their Boron Scheme investments save for Serena Adsit Kim (the Investor in the 10thcharge), who received only one payment of interest on her first investment three months after it had fallen due.[note: 103]If the Investors profited from other investments, that cannot erase the fact that they were cheated by the Appellants into investing in the Boron Scheme. It is also hardly relevant that some Investors converted their Boron Scheme investments to other investments, since they ultimately remain unpaid and the conversions simply notionally shifted the liability from one scheme in PPPL to another. I also cannot accept the claim that investors entered the Boron Scheme in violation of PPPL’s policy as the DJ found that Goldring had sanctioned those investments (GD at [510]). I am also unimpressed with the Appellants’ complaint that that their downfall or inability to repay investors was hastened by articles talking about the very thing they have been doing. 102    The lack of restitution is an aggravating factor where an offender refuses to make restitution despite having the means and the opportunity to do so (Gunasegeran s/o Pavadaisamy v Public Prosecutor[1997] 2 SLR(R) 946 at [67]perYong CJ). During the life of the Boron Scheme, Nordmann and Geraldine collectively received US$760,663 while Goldring received US$332,101 in terms of salaries, commissions and referral fees.[note: 104]Nordmann and Geraldine even had 18 tonnes of personal effects which they shipped from their residence in Malaysia to France in early 2011, while investigations were ongoing.[note: 105]Clearly, they had ample means and opportunity to make restitution, at least in part, to the victims of the Boron Scheme. However, no restitution was made. During investigations, the CAD seized a sum of money from PPPL’s bank accounts of which only about S$66,000 remains. I think it is appropriate to consider the lack of restitution in the present case to be an aggravating factor. Whether the Appellants showed a lack of remorse by claiming trial 103    The Appellants also argue that the DJ was biased in saying that they showed a lack of remorse in claiming trial because this led to Geraldine’s acquittal and prevented a miscarriage of justice. 104    It is not an aggravating factor to claim trial (Kuek Ah Lek v Public Prosecutor[1995] 2 SLR(R) 766 at [65]). However, the DJ was correct to treat the Appellants’ conduct at trial as an aggravating factor. For example, it is an aggravating factor for an accused to defiantly maintain his position despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary (Lee Foo Choong Kelvin v Public Prosecutor[1999] 3 SLR(R) 292 at [36]perYong CJ) or to prolong the trial unnecessarily (Wan Kim Hock v Public Prosecutor[2003] 1 SLR(R) 410 at [27]). The Appellants here did just that. Despite the evidence, they maintained they had no knowledge of the Boron Scheme and blamed virtually everyone except themselves for PPPL’s downfall. They blamed the CAD for intervening, third parties for speaking up in the public sphere and hastening PPPL’s downfall, Investors for trying to defraud them and John Gaunt when he had little to do with the Boron Scheme in the first place. The Appellants even accused many witnesses of lying.[note: 106]All these led to a trial that lasted 64 days. On appeal, they tried to reopen factual findings which were grounded in an abundance of evidence and they repeatedly accused the Prosecution and the DJ of misrepresenting the evidence.[note: 107] 105    Accordingly, the DJ was right insofar as he considered that the Appellants’ conduct at trial was an aggravating factor. The sentencing precedents 106    With that, I turn to the Prosecution’s submissions. I am of the opinion that the current sentence is not manifestly inadequate. It is not “unjustly lenient” such that it “requires substantial alterations rather than minute corrections to remedy the injustice” (Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing[2008] 2 SLR(R) 684 at [15]). Based on the three sentencing markers that I will discuss, I think that the sentences imposed by the DJ are sufficient punishment for the Appellants. 107    The first precedent isPhang Wah(mentioned at [96] above). The exact amount of losses there was unknown but it ran into the millions (Phang Wah (DC)at [334];Phang Wahat [75]). The two accused persons were sentenced to 4.5 years’ and 3.5 years’ imprisonment respectively. The Prosecution takes further issue with comparing this case withPhang Wahon the basis that the accused persons there faced a single charge of fraudulent trading under s 340(5) read with s 340(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”), which encompassed the entire business activity, whereas the Appellants face 18 distinct and specific charges each of conspiring to cheat under s 420 read with s 109 of the PC. Although I appreciate this distinction,Phang Wahdoes offer some guidance as a precedent because the intention behind the underlying scheme there and the scheme here is broadly similar. However, the sentencing spectrum under s 340 of the CA is different,ie, it carries a maximum fine of up to $15,000 or imprisonment term of up to seven years or both. In contrast, s 420 of the PC carries a mandatory imprisonment term of up to 10 years and a discretionary fine. 108    The next precedent isRahj Kamal. There, the accused devised a scheme called the “Directorship Programme”. For a $25,000 or $30,000 “interest-free personal collateral loan” to his company, a participant was guaranteed monthly “goodfaith gifts” of $3,000 after three or four months indefinitely and a refund of the capital sum within two years. The company’s only business activity, however, was the collection of funds from the public through similar schemes. A total of $175,000 was taken. The accused was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment on each of three charges of cheating under s 420 of the PC and three charges of fraudulent trading under s 340(1) read with s 340(5) of the CA. On appeal, his sentence was enhanced to an aggregate of eight years’ imprisonment. 109    In my view, the DJ was not wrong to find that the present case was comparable toRahj Kamal, despite the fact that a total of US$732,000 was involved here. First, the appellant inRahj Kamalran a complete scam; he had absolutely no income-generating business (at [19] and [33]). In contrast, the Boron Scheme was not entirely fraudulent although, as I have mentioned, any genuine business was but a very small part of the entire scheme. Second, the appellant there behaved egregiously by preying on the vulnerable with emotional appeal. He projected himself as the “economic saviour of the Malay community” and abused the trust obtained by “using religion to back up his promises” (at [37]). Third, inRahj Kamal, the original sentence was doubled (without an appeal by the Prosecution) partly on the basis of the appellant’s deplorable conduct at trial (at [38]). The Appellants here showed no remorse in the conduct of their trial and their conduct was rightly considered to be an aggravating factor. However, they have not gone to the extent of arguing with the court after it has given its rulings and embarrassing witnesses with irrelevant, scandalous questions, as was the case inRahj Kamal. 110    The third precedent cited isPublic Prosecutor v Lam Chen Fong[2002] 2 SLR(R) 599 (“Lam Chen Fong”). There, the accused offered highly favourable exchange rates for his money remittance business, on the condition of a one-month lead-time. This allowed him to roll over funds and create a money circulation scam to feed his gambling habit. Within three months, he embezzled almost $8.8m from over 1,000 foreign workers for whom the respective amounts of money were a large part of their savings. Only $905,000 was recovered. The accused pleaded guilty to, among other charges, 20 charges of criminal breach of trust as an agent under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (with 1,190 other charges taken into consideration). He was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment on each s 409 charge and to an aggregate of 22 years’ imprisonment. At the material time, s 409 provided for imprisonment for life or up to ten years and a discretionary fine. The loss occasioned in the present case was US$732,000. Therefore, even ifLam Chen Fongwas used as a comparison, the sentences here would not appear to be too lenient when the amounts of the money taken are compared. 111    The cases discussed above suggest that the Appellants’ sentences of seven and eight years’ imprisonment are not unduly harsh. They could not be said to be too lenient either. 112    Goldring was given a slightly lighter sentence by the DJ on account of his lesser role in the entire scheme. On appeal, Goldring ironically expressed his “chagrin” at having been called Nordmann’s “side-kick” by the DJ.[note: 108]In my opinion, Goldring played a very significant role even though his work related more to the infrastructure of the Boron Scheme. However, the DJ was justified in saying that Nordmann played a larger role to the extent that he was effectively the mouthpiece for the defence. In any case, considering the overall circumstances of this case, I do not think that the DJ would be wrong even if he had given Goldring the same sentence as Nordmann’s. 113    In my opinion, the sentences imposed are neither manifestly excessive nor manifestly inadequate. I therefore see no reason to reduce or to enhance the sentences.",
        "Conclusion on the Appellants’ guilt": "79     For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that the DJ’s findings were correct. The Appellants’ guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. I see no ground for me to disagree with the DJ’s decision and, accordingly, I uphold the convictions. I will now turn to the cross-appeals against sentence.",
        "The cross-appeals against sentence": "80     In sentencing the Appellants, the DJ employed four lines of reasoning. First, there were six aggravating factors (GD at [695]). Second, the Boron Scheme was not entirely a scam and fell between the sentencing markers ofRahj KamalandPhang Wah and others v Public Prosecutor[2012] 1 SLR 646 (“Phang Wah”) (GD at [698]–[701]). Third, the individual sentences were calibrated against the monies cheated from each Investor as reflected in the following table (GD at [694]). Fourth, Nordmann received a higher global sentence as he played a larger role as “chief marketer” of the Boron Scheme (GD at [696]–[697]). The DJ accordingly ordered the sentences for charges 4, 9 and 17 to run consecutively for Goldring, making a total of seven years’ imprisonment. The sentences for charges 2, 4, 9 and 17 were ordered to run consecutively for Nordmann, making a total of eight years’ imprisonment. The sentences are reflected in this table below: Charge NoInvestorAmount invested (US$)Sentence (imprisonment)1Durairajan s/o Duraiappan Mariyammal20,0006 months2Au Chung Wai Christopher54,0001 year3Chakroborty Arijit10,0006 months4Koh Leong Tuan Alan59,0001 year5Leong Pek Kay15,0007 months6Lim Shi An26,0008 months7Ng Ee Ling20,0008 months8Chua Pair Shen5,0006 months9Yap Lay Hoon Lilian186,0003 years10Adsit Serena Kim5,0006 months11Mellisa Octaviani13,0006 months12Foo Siew Wei5,0006 months13Lium Ming Toon90,0002 years15John Nicholas Williams10,0006 months17Neoh Kok Cheng191,0003 years18Annamali Meyyappan7,0006 months19Peter Aloysius Lourdes6,0006 months20Tan Zheqi10,0006 months   81     These sentences have been appealed against by both the Appellants and the Prosecution. In an appeal against sentence, appellate intervention is warranted if the sentence is manifestly excessive or inadequate, wrong in law or against the weight of the evidence (s 394 of the CPC). It was stated by the Court of Appeal inPublic Prosecutor v UI[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 at [12]–[13] that intervention on the latter two grounds is justified only if the sentencing judge: (a)     erred with respect to the proper factual basis for sentencing; (b)     failed to appreciate the material before him; or (c)     applied a wrong principle in sentencing.",
        "Conclusion": "114    I affirm the conviction of both Appellants on their charges (as amended by the DJ) and uphold the sentences imposed. Accordingly, the appeals by the Appellants (against conviction and sentence) and by the Prosecution (against sentence) are dismissed. 115    The sentences are to commence today unless otherwise ordered upon application.
