        "Background facts": "",
        "The parties and their subcontracts": "4 The plaintiff is an interior renovation company.3Foot Note 3×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) at paragraph 1.The defendant is a building contractor specialising in glazing works.4Foot Note 4×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) at paragraph 2; Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 4. 5 In December 2012, Shimizu Corporation Pte Ltd as the main contractor awarded to the plaintiff the subcontract5Foot Note 5×Defendant’s Bundle of Documents (volume 1) at page 225.for interior fitting out works for a section of the Changi Business Park project.6Foot Note 6×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) at paragraph 3.By two subcontracts, the plaintiff subcontracted to the defendant the wall finishes work and the joinery work for the same section of the project.7Foot Note 7×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) at paragraph 4.The wall finishes subcontract had a value of $1,252,750.8Foot Note 8×Agreed Bundle of Documents at pages 5-11.The joinery subcontract had a value of $1,550,000.9Foot Note 9×Agreed Bundle of Documents at pages 12-19. 6 Both subcontracts are re-measurement contracts by express provision. The effect of the re-measurement clause is that each subcontract sum was subject to re-measurement and recalculation when drawing up the final account. The re-measurement clause reads as follows:10Foot Note 10×Agreed Bundle of Documents at pages 11 and 18. 22)Others … This Sub-Contract is a re-measurement contract. Accordingly, the amount stated as Sub-Contract Sum shall be subject to re-measurement and recalculation in the event that the actual quantities of the work executed and materials supplied differ from the quantities or estimates provided by either party prior to the letter of award. In the event there is material which deviate in the specification and approved by Consultant, we reserve our right for the cost adjustment. 7 Each subcontract also provides expressly that it is back-to-back with the main contract. One consequence of that is that the defendant was precluded from advancing a variation claim under either subcontract unless the main contractor authorised and approved the variation:11Foot Note 11×Agreed Bundle of Documents at pages 9 and 17. 17)Variation Claim This Sub-Contract shall be on a back-to-back basis to the contract between [the plaintiff] and [the main contractor] and there shall be no claim whatsoever unless it is a variation work authorised and approved by [the main contractor] only. 8 The defendant duly commenced work under each subcontract.12Foot Note 12×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2 and 3) at paragraphs 6 and 13; Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraphs 10 and 21.",
        "Payment claims": "The wall finishes subcontract 9 On 5 August 2013, the defendant served on the plaintiff a payment claim under the wall finishes subcontract for the sum of $322,536.65.13Foot Note 13×Agreed Bundle of Documents at pages 129-130.On 21 August 2013, the plaintiff certified the sum of $93,732.10.14Foot Note 14×Agreed Bundle of Documents at page 194.(This, like all sums of money which I set out in this judgment, excludes goods and services tax unless otherwise stated.) 10 On 28 August 2013, the defendant made an adjudication application under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) for the sum of $228,804.55 said to be due under the wall finishes contract.15Foot Note 15×Agreed Bundle of Documents at page 197.That sum was the difference between the defendant’s payment claim and the plaintiff’s certificate for the wall finishes work. 11 On 12 September 2013, the defendant obtained an adjudication determination in its favour in the sum of $223,956.50 for wall finishes work.16Foot Note 16×Agreed Bundle of Documents at page 210. The joinery subcontract 12 Also on 5 August 2013, the defendant served on the plaintiff a payment claim under the joinery subcontract for the sum of $324,812.68.17Foot Note 17×Agreed Bundle of Documents at pages 21-22.The plaintiff issued a payment certificate dated 9 July 2013 certifying the sum of $56,267.90.18Foot Note 18×Agreed Bundle of Documents at pages 20 and 201.On 28 August 2013,19Foot Note 19×Agreed Bundle of Documents at page 215.the defendant made an adjudication application under the Act for the sum of $268,544.78 said to be due under the joinery subcontract. That sum was the difference between the defendant’s payment claim and the plaintiff’s certificate for the joinery work.20Foot Note 20×Agreed Bundle of Documents at page 201. 13 On 12 September 2013, the defendant obtained an adjudication determination in its favour in the sum of $296,719.58 for joinery work.21Foot Note 21×Agreed Bundle of Documents at page 214.",
        "The defendant enforces the adjudication determinations": "14 A little over a week after securing the two adjudication determinations, the defendant applied for22Foot Note 22×Agreed Bundle of Documents at pages 223-226.and secured leave to enforce each determination as a judgment of the court.23Foot Note 23×Agreed Bundle of Documents at pages 227-234.The plaintiff was therefore adjudged liable to pay the defendant – albeit only with interim finality – the sum of $243,485.46 for the wall finishes work and $323,909.95 for the joinery work.24Foot Note 24×Agreed Bundle of Documents at pages 227 and 231. 15 The plaintiff attempted to set aside both judgments and both determinations. Both attempts ultimately failed. 16 The plaintiff has paid to the defendant the sum of $317,992.62 (including goods and services tax) under the adjudication determination on the joinery claim.25Foot Note 25×Bundle of AEICs at pages 12 (Lee Mie Ling) and 156 (Low Ching Kew).The defendant also recovered from the plaintiff by levying execution the sum of $26,405.73 (including goods and services tax) under the judgment arising from the adjudication determination on the wall finishes subcontract.26Foot Note 26×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) at paragraph 17; Bundle of AEICs at page 9 (Lee Mie Ling). 17 The plaintiff commenced this action on 18 December 2013, claiming that the final account between the parties showed that the plaintiff had paid the defendant under each subcontract more than the defendant was contractually entitled to and seeking judgment for the amount of the overpayment.27Foot Note 27×Writ of Summons (S 1155/2013).",
        "The parties’ claims and counterclaims": "18 I now set out a breakdown of the sums that the parties claim against each other.",
        "The plaintiff‘s claim": "The wall finishes subcontract 19 The plaintiff claims that it has overpaid the defendant a sum of $567,793.76 (including goods and services tax) under the wall finishes subcontract.28Foot Note 28×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) at paragraph 21.That overpayment arises because the plaintiff’s interim payments to the defendant were made on the basis that the plaintiff was obliged to pay for openings in the walls even though there was no finish involved. However, the plaintiff now takes the position that the wall finishes contract permits it to exclude openings in the walls when calculating the defendant’s entitlement to payment. 20 The sum of $567,793.76 (including goods and services tax) claimed under the wall finishes contract is computed as follows:29Foot Note 29×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at page 9; Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) at paragraph 21.

        "The defendant’s counterclaim": "Counterclaim arising from the subcontracts 23 The defendant’s counterclaim is for monies said to be due from the plaintiff under both subcontracts. 24 Under the wall finishes subcontract, the defendant’s counterclaim in substance is for: (a) The sum of $4,848.05 being excess back charges deducted by the plaintiff for rectification of mosaic tiling;33Foot Note 33×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 40; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 49.and (b) The sum of $38,141.94 being the 2.5% of retention sum held by the plaintiff.34Foot Note 34×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 42; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 51. 25 Under the joinery subcontract, the defendant’s counterclaim in substance is for the sum of $44,141.32, being the 2.5% of retention sum held by the plaintiff under the joinery subcontract.35Foot Note 35×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 47; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 55. 26 In the general alternative, the defendant claims damages to be assessed in respect of the work done, services rendered, and material that it supplied to the plaintiff on the account of both the wall finishes and the joinery subcontracts.36Foot Note 36×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraphs 43 and 48. Counterclaim arising from the payment claims 27 In addition to the defendant’s counterclaims under the subcontracts which I have summarised at [23] – [26] above, the defendant also attempts to assert by way of counterclaim one of the following three alternative counterclaims: (i) its original payment claims issued under each subcontract; (ii) the adjudication determinations issued in its favour under each subcontract; or (iii) the judgments under s 27 of the Act founded on those adjudication determinations. 28 The defendant also seeks to recover by way of counterclaim: (a) Damages to be assessed or taxed, in the form of costs and expenses incurred by the defendant in the adjudication applications, including solicitors’ fees, pursuant to s 30(4) of the Act;37Foot Note 37×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 49; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 56. (b) Damages to be assessed or taxed, in the form of costs and expenses, including solicitors’ fees, in respect of the litigation  resulting from the defendant’s applications to enforce the adjudication determinations and consequential applications;38Foot Note 38×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 50.and (c) Damages arising from having to engage Mr Lim Yan San (“Mr Lim”), the defendants’ project manager for the subcontracts, from August 2013 to December 2013, at a sum of $5,000 per month.39Foot Note 39×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraphs 51 and 55; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 57. 29 The heads of the defendant’s counterclaim which I have summarised at [27] and [28] above are all non-starters for reasons which I will explain in due course.",
        "The issues": "30 The parties’ evidence and submissions gave rise to the following six issues: (a) Whether the parties agreed that the openings in the wall finishes were to be included in the measurements for the wall finishes subcontract and therefore paid for by the plaintiff;40Foot Note 40×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraphs 6D, 34A, 34E, 34L-34R. (b) Whether the plaintiff is bound by its interim certificates and, in particular, whether the plaintiff is estopped from relying on the re-measurement clause (ie,cl 22) in each subcontract;41Foot Note 41×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraphs 34, 34F-34G. (c) Whether the quantities as re-measured by the plaintiff are accurate;42Foot Note 42×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 34S. (d) Whether the plaintiff has overpaid the defendant;43Foot Note 43×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraphs 34C and 34D. (e) Whether the plaintiff waived the requirement under the parties’ subcontracts that any variation works carried out by the defendant had to be authorised and approved by the main contractor;44Foot Note 44×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraphs 9 and 34U.and (f) Whether s 9 of the Act renders void any of the contractual provisions on which the plaintiff relies.45Foot Note 45×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 9A. 31 The defendant has also pleaded four issues relating to what is said to be: (a) the plaintiff’s wrongful conduct (including deceiving and misleading the court) in both adjudication applications and in the associated litigation;46Foot Note 46×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraphs 14, 26, 28 and 33. (b) the plaintiff’s wrongful failure to pay the costs awarded against it in that litigation;47Foot Note 47×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 18. (c) the plaintiff’s unconscionable failure to pay for variations;48Foot Note 48×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 34T.and (d) the plaintiff’s wrongful motive in commencing this action, rendering it an abuse of the process of the court.49Foot Note 49×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 1A. 32 These four issues are incapable of being a defence to the plaintiff’s claim. They are also unconnected to any aspect of the defendant’s counterclaim. They appear to me to be gratuitous allegations, which ought never to have been pleaded. I need not deal with them further. 33 The only issues which I need to decide to determine the outcome of both the claim and the counterclaim are therefore the six issues listed above at [30].",
        "Issue (a): The openings in the wall finishes": "",
        "The parties’ submissions": "64 The plaintiff’s submission is that after re-measurement, the amounts payable to the defendant for work done was $787,521.71 for the wall finishes subcontract and $1,588,793.78 for the joinery subcontract (both sums including goods and services tax).100Foot Note 100×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 33.The quantities for the sums due under each subcontract (see above at [20] and [21]) are based on final measurements by the plaintiff and the main contractor. Both Ms Lee, a quantity surveyor and the plaintiff’s project director for this contract,101Foot Note 101×Bundle of AEICs at page 3 (Lee Mie Ling).and Ms Srima Erin Lakmalie Adikari (“Ms Erin”), the main contractor’s senior quantity surveyor,102Foot Note 102×NE Day 3 at page 2 (line 25).were involved in taking the measurements.103Foot Note 103×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraphs 18-20. 65 The plaintiff submits that its re-measurements are accurate. First, the quantities set out in the main contractor’s payment response sheet, which represent the final quantities due under both subcontracts, tally with the calculation sheets exhibited in Ms Lee’s affidavit of evidence in chief.104Foot Note 104×Plaintiff’s Reply Closing Submissions at paragraph 58.Second, the re-measurements are supported by the evidence at trial of Ms Lee and Ms Erin, who were able to show and explain the basis of the plaintiff’s calculations and measurements.105Foot Note 105×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraphs 21-24.At trial, Ms Lee testified that her conclusion that the plaintiff had overpaid the defendant was based on the as-built drawings for both the wall finishes works and joinery works.106Foot Note 106×NE Day 2 at pages 61 (line 28), 63 (lines 26-31) and 64 (line 1); Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents (volume 1) at pages 5-9 and 10-14.She also maintained that none of the interim certificates contained the final measurement figures.107Foot Note 107×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 28.Ms Erin further confirmed at trial that the re-measurements were the final measurements undertaken for this project.108Foot Note 108×NE Day 3 at pages 58-59; Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 24. 66 The plaintiff submits that because Ms Lee and Ms Erin are reliable witnesses, their measurements should be taken as accurate.109Foot Note 109×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 20.In any case, during the course of trial, the defendant did not contest or question the measurements or quantities which they derived.110Foot Note 110×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 27.Accordingly, based on the re-measurements, the total contract sum due for work done under the wall finishes subcontract is $787,521.71 and for the joinery subcontract is $1,588,793.78 (see above at [20] and [21]).111Foot Note 111×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 33. 67 The defendant, however, questions the credibility of Ms Lee and Ms Erin.112Foot Note 112×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraphs 83 and 334.Neither of them could explain credibly why the measured quantities in the interim certificates varied so drastically from the re-measured quantities.113Foot Note 113×Defendant’s Reply Closing Submissions at paragraph 79.The defendant also alleges that Ms Lee’s evidence asserting that the documents relied upon for measurements114Foot Note 114×Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents (volume 1) at pages 5-14.were “as-built drawings issued by [the main contractor]” is false.115Foot Note 115×Defendant’s Reply Closing Submissions at paragraph 70.That is because there is no endorsement, signature, or stamp on the drawings indicating that they were approved as final as-built drawings by the main contractor.116Foot Note 116×Defendant’s Reply Closing Submissions at paragraph 67. 68 With respect to Ms Erin, the defendant claims that her evidence is unreliable as her testimony is inherently contradictory and inconsistent.117Foot Note 117×Defendant’s Reply Closing Submissions at paragraph 71.Ms Erin testified that she prepared the entire final account statement118Foot Note 118×Bundle of AEICs at pages 82-101 (Lee Mie Ling).dated 27 March 2014 on behalf of the main contractor.119Foot Note 119×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 336.This contradicts Ms Lee’s evidence. Ms Lee testified that she prepared some of the documents in the final account statement.120Foot Note 120×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 336.Eventually, Ms Erin agreed that the documents reflect a compilation of information furnished to her by the plaintiff and verified by the main contractor.121Foot Note 121×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 337.Ms Erin also testified that the as-built drawings would be prepared by the main contractor and approved by a consultant quantity surveyor. But as previously mentioned, the defendant rejects the as-built drawings because they do not bear the consultant’s signature or stamp to signify that he has approved them as the project’s as-built drawings.122Foot Note 122×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 339. 69 Because both Ms Lee and Ms Erin’s testimony is unreliable, the defendant submits that the plaintiff cannot rely on them to support its position that the documents in the final account statement are the finalised versions.123Foot Note 123×Defendant’s Reply Closing Submissions at paragraph 71. 70 In response, the plaintiff argues that the defendant has not adduced any evidence supporting their calculations and measurements under both subcontracts.124Foot Note 124×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraphs 64 and 76. 71 With respect to the wall finishes subcontract in particular, the plaintiff submits that it is unclear how the defendant arrived at the figure of $1,525,677.75.125Foot Note 125×Plaintiff’s Reply Closing Submissions at paragraphs 17-18.Mr Low admitted at trial that the defendant did not include the calculation sheets or any other documents to support the quantities it alleged.126Foot Note 126×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 52.Mr Low also did not prepare the documents upon which the defendant relies to support its claims. His evidence with respect to the calculations and measurements is therefore hearsay.127Foot Note 127×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 76.In any case, Mr Low is not a qualified quantity surveyor. There is therefore no basis upon which the court can rely on his evidence to justify the defendant’s measurements and therefore its counterclaims. 72 Mr Low testified that Mr Lim of the defendant undertook the measurements for work done under the wall finishes subcontract128Foot Note 128×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 53; NE Day 5 at pages 45 (line 28) - 46 (line 10).and submitted further measurements after the alleged final payment claims were submitted.129Foot Note 129×NE Day 5 at pages 44 (line 15) - 45 (line 24).On 30 August 2013, however, Ms Lee e-mailed Mr Lim and Mr Low to inform them that the plaintiff had “not received all [the] revised [quantities]” of the measurements submitted by Mr Lim.130Foot Note 130×Defendant’s Bundle of Documents (volume 1) at page 251.In any case, any measurements provided by Mr Lim would be hearsay evidence as he was not called as a witness in the proceedings.131Foot Note 131×Plaintiff’s Reply Closing Submissions at paragraphs 18 and 65.",
        "My decision": "101 In my view, the defendant’s variation claims are without merit. It is not disputed that the wall finishes subcontract contains an express term conditioning the defendant’s entitlement to recover payment for variations on the main contractor’s authorisation and approval. Neither is it disputed that the main contractor did not authorise or approve any of the variation works which form the basis of the defendant’s counterclaim against the plaintiff, whether under the wall finishes subcontract or the joinery subcontract.186Foot Note 186×NE (26 July 2016) at page 5 (lines 21-24).It is therefore clear that the contractual conditions agreed between the plaintiff and defendant for a successful variation claim are not satisfied. 102 The case ofHi-Amp Engineeringis distinguishable. In that case, MPH Rubin J held that the main contract was not capable of being read back-to-back with the subcontract. He doubted (at [98]) that the subcontractor had even seen the main contract before entering into the subcontract (see alsoGIB Automation Pte Ltd vDeluge Fire Protection (SEA) Pte Ltd[2007] 2 SLR(R) 918 at [47]).For the reasons mentioned above at [44], I have found that it is likely that the wall finishes subcontract was signed in January 2013 but dated December 2012. Clause 17 of both subcontracts expressly states that the main contract and the subcontracts are to be on a “back-to-back” basis (see above at [7]). The subcontract inHi-Amp Engineeringdid not contain a clause requiring authorisation and approval from the main contractor before variation claims could be made. 103 The defendant asserts in paragraph 9 of its Defence and Counterclaim that the plaintiff had, by its conduct and actions in respect of these variations, waived strict compliance with cl 17 (referred to above at [101]).187Foot Note 187×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 9.This argument was not pursued in the defendant’s written submissions.188Foot Note 188×No oral submissions were required of the parties.Instead, the defendant claims that if it is not able to recover, the plaintiff would have secured the benefit of the variationsex gratia.189Foot Note 189×NE (26 July 2016) at page 5 (lines 25-29).That may be true, and that may be unjust, but it does not advance the contractual right to payment which the defendant asserts as the sole basis for its counterclaim. 104 The defendant has not pleaded and did not submit that an alternative basis for its counterclaim was aquantum meruit. I cannot award compensation to the defendant on a cause of action which it has not pleaded (Ong Seow Pheng and others v Lotus Development Corp and another[1997] 2 SLR(R) 113 at [41]). 105 Thus, in the absence of any attempt by the defendant to make good in its submissions its case on waiver, and in the absence of a pleaded counterclaim seeking aquantum meruitin the law of unjust enrichment, the defendant’s counterclaim for variations must be dismissed.190Foot Note 190×NE (26 July 2016) at pages 5 (line 31) - 6 (line 3).",

        "Issue (c): The accuracy of the plaintiff’s re-measurements": "",
        "Issue (d): Whether the plaintiff has overpaid the defendant": "80 Having found that the parties’ subcontracts were re-measurement contracts and that the plaintiff’s re-measurements are accurate, the next question which arises is whether the plaintiff has overpaid the defendant. 81 I find that the plaintiff has indeed overpaid the defendant by the sum of $904,530.53.144Foot Note 144×NE (26 July 2016) at page 5 (lines 10-11).Based on the plaintiff’s re-measurements, the sums actually and contractually due to the defendant were: (a) Wall finishes subcontract: $787,521.71 (b) Joinery subcontract: $1,588,793.78",
        "Wall finishes subcontract": "82 The table set out at [20] above shows how the plaintiff computes $567,793.76 (including goods and services tax) as the overpayment under the wall finishes subcontract.145Foot Note 145×Plaintiff’s Reply Closing Submissions at page 12.It is not disputed that the plaintiff made a partial payment of $93,732.10 in response to the defendant’s payment claim under the wall finishes subcontract,146Foot Note 146×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) at paragraph 15; Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 38; Bundle of AEICs at page 165 (Low Ching Kew).in addition to the sum of $1,169,847.21 which the plaintiff had previously paid.147Foot Note 147×Agreed Bundle of Documents at page 130.The defendant recovered the sum of $26,405.73 by levying execution on the judgment arising from the adjudication determination under the wall finishes contract.148Foot Note 148×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) at paragraph 17; Bundle of AEICs at page 9 (Lee Mie Ling).The plaintiff has therefore paid a total of $1,378,435.59 (including goods and services tax) to the defendant. 83 The plaintiff accepts that $898.90 (including goods and services tax) is due to the defendant pursuant to an agreed variation.149Foot Note 149×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) at paragraph 20; Bundle of AEICs at page 9 (Lee Mie Ling).It also agrees that it is liable to pay for a direct supply item amounting to $22,221.32 (including goods and services tax).150Foot Note 150×Bundle of AEICs at page 9 (Lee Mie Ling).Therefore, after deducting the total sum due from the plaintiff from the re-measured contractual sum, the net overpayment that the plaintiff is entitled to under the wall finishes subcontract is $567,793.76 (including goods and services tax).",
        "Joinery subcontract": "84 The table set out at [21] above shows how the plaintiff computes $336,736.77 (including goods and services tax) as the overpayment under the joinery subcontract.151Foot Note 151×Plaintiff’s Reply Closing Submissions at page 13.It is not disputed that the plaintiff made a partial payment of the sum of $56,267.90 in response to the defendant’s payment claim for works done pursuant to the joinery subcontract,152Foot Note 152×Bundle of AEICs at page 172 (Low Ching Kew).in addition to the sum of $1,446,104.00 previously paid.153Foot Note 153×Agreed Bundle of Documents pages 20 and 22.The plaintiff also paid the defendant a sum of $317,992.62 (including goods and services tax) pursuant to the adjudication determination on the joinery contract.154Foot Note 154×Bundle of AEICs at pages 12 (Lee Mie Ling) and 156 (Low Ching Kew).After deducting the re-measured sum of $1,588,793.78 (including goods and services tax), the total amount of overpayment in respect of the joinery subcontract is $336,736.77 (including goods and services tax).",
        "The defendant’s counterclaims": "The adjudication determinations 85 As mentioned above, the defendant’s counterclaim takes the position that the plaintiff is obliged to pay to the defendant the sums due under the two adjudication determinations.155Foot Note 155×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraphs 39 and 45.The plaintiff disagrees and argues that the adjudication determinations are of no relevance to the present proceedings as they carry only interim finality. They therefore do not constitute final and binding judgments on the amounts to be awarded under the two subcontracts.156Foot Note 156×Plaintiff’s Reply Closing Submissions at paragraph 16. 86 I agree with the plaintiff. Section 21(1) of the Act states that an adjudication determination is binding on the parties unless or until the parties’ dispute is finally determined by a court. That is what I am now doing: I am determining the parties’ dispute with full finality. The adjudicator’s determination of the parties’ dispute with interim finality is of no relevance to the exercise I am undertaking. The dollar value of his determination has no relevance to my ascertainment with full finality of the sums due from one party to the other. Counterclaim for $4,848.05 87 The defendant also counterclaims a sum of $4,848.05 for excess back charges which the plaintiff deducted under the wall finishes subcontract for rectification of mosaic tiling.157Foot Note 157×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 40; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 49.The defendant claims that the plaintiff initially deducted a sum of $10,295.75 from the monies due to the defendant but later agreed to reduce the deduction to $5,447.70. Because this sum was not awarded in the adjudication determination, the defendant takes the position that the plaintiff should now refund the difference between those two sums,ie,$4,848.05.158Foot Note 158×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 40; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 49. 88 I agree with the plaintiff that it is unclear how the defendant arrived at this sum of $4,848.05.159Foot Note 159×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraphs 51-52.Mr Low admitted at trial that the defendant did not include the calculation sheets or any other documents to support the quantities it alleges.160Foot Note 160×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 52; NE Day 5 at pages 51 (line 31) - 54 (line 7). 89 I accordingly reject the defendant’s claim of $4,848.05 worth of back charges under the wall finishes subcontract. Counterclaim for the retention sums 90 The defendant also counterclaims: (i) the sum of $38,141.94,161Foot Note 161×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 42; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 51.being the retention sum held by the plaintiff under the wall finishes subcontract; and (ii) the sum of $44,141.32,162Foot Note 162×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 47; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 55.being the retention sum under the joinery subcontract respectively. 91 Clause 4 of each subcontract provides that the retention sum will be released only upon the plaintiff’s receipt of the maintenance certificate from the consultant.163Foot Note 163×Agreed Bundle of Documents at pages 6 and 13.I accept Ms Lee’s evidence that the plaintiff has asked the main contractor for the maintenance certificate but the main contractor has yet to respond because its consultant has yet to issue the certificate to it.164Foot Note 164×NE Day 1 at page 108 (lines 26-29).The plaintiff has therefore yet to receive the maintenance certificate. That is a contractual condition precedent to the defendant’s entitlement to have the retention sum released to it.165Foot Note 165×NE Day 1 at page 107 (lines 13-17).Until that condition is satisfied the defendant has no contractual entitlement to the retention sum or to bring into account against the plaintiff. I cannot take this sum into account in order to reduce the defendant’s liability to the plaintiff.",
        "Conclusion on overpayment": "92 I therefore find: (i) that the plaintiff has indeed overpaid the defendant by the sum of $904,530.53 (including goods and services tax); and (ii) that the defendant has no contractual entitlement to set up any sums against the plaintiff to diminish or extinguish that overpayment.",
        "Issue (e): the defendant’s counterclaim for variation works and waiver of requirement of authorisation and approval": "",
        "Parties’ submissions": "93 The defendant’s payment claims (dated 5 August 2013) were claims for alleged variations under both subcontracts. The defendant claimed the sum of $256,669.66166Foot Note 166×Agreed Bundle of Documents at page 132.for variations under the wall finishes subcontract and $187,559.65167Foot Note 167×Agreed Bundle of Documents at page 24.for variations under the joinery subcontract.168Foot Note 168×Bundle of AEICs at pages 162 and 171.Although there were six variation orders under the wall finishes subcontract and 12 variation orders under the joinery subcontract,169Foot Note 169×Agreed Bundle of Documents at pages 24 and 132.the plaintiff accepts only Variation Order No. 1 under the wall finishes subcontract, amounting to $898.80 (including goods and services tax).170Foot Note 170×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) at paragraph 20. 94 According to the defendant, it carried out these variation works171Foot Note 171×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 380.on the plaintiff’s instructions172Foot Note 172×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 9.to do so. Ms Lee confirmed at trial that instructions for variations were generally given verbally, and admitted that the works under Variation Order No. 2 under the wall finishes subcontract were pursuant to verbal instructions given by the plaintiff.173Foot Note 173×NE Day 1 at page 89 (lines 13-21).She also accepted that the variation works in Variation Order No. 2 were in fact carried out.174Foot Note 174×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraphs 378-379; NE Day 1 at page 82 (lines 3-4).The amounts claimed by the defendant after the defendant submitted its payment claim (dated 5 August 2013) for work done under the wall finishes subcontract were also certified by the plaintiff.175Foot Note 175×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 372.The adjudicator acknowledged this in the adjudication proceedings under the wall finishes subcontract.176Foot Note 176×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 373. 95 The defendant argues that the present factual situation is similar to the case ofHi-Amp Engineering Pte Ltd v Technicdelta Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd[2003] SGHC 316 (“Hi-Amp Engineering”).177Foot Note 177×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraphs 449-452.As inHi-Amp Engineering, almost all the variations were underpinned by some form of written instructions or directions from the defendant to the plaintiff (seeHi-Amp Engineeringat [103]). Because the High Court granted the variation claim inHi-Amp Engineering, the defendant submits that the same should be done for the present case. 96 The defendant also submits that it is significant that the plaintiff does not deny that the works were carried out. Instead, the plaintiff contends that the defendant cannot recover because the main contractor did not authorise or approve the works as required by the parties’ subcontract.178Foot Note 178×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 374.In effect, the plaintiff’s contention is the defendant carried out the variation worksex gratia. The defendant says that this position is untenable.179Foot Note 179×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 375. 97 The defendant adds that the plaintiff has the burden of showing that the main contractor did not authorise or approve the variation works carried out by the defendant. The plaintiff has failed to discharge this burden as it has not exhibited any documentary proof showing submission of the progress claims and final claims to the main contractor.180Foot Note 180×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraphs 376-377. 98 The plaintiff submits in response that it is for the defendant to show that the main contractor authorised or approved the variation works.181Foot Note 181×Plaintiff’s Reply Closing Submissions at paragraph 85.It is unable to do so. It is also for the defendant to show that the works which the defendant alleges to be variations were indeed variations and not within the original scope of the subcontract. There is also no evidence to establish that.182Foot Note 182×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 72(b). 99 During cross-examination, Mr Low admitted that he did not have any evidence to prove that the main contractor authorised or approved the variation works.183Foot Note 183×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraphs 69 and 71.He also did not have any evidence to prove that these items were variations (ie, there was no document such as the original drawings to show how the items claimed constituted variations).184Foot Note 184×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraphs 70 and 72(c); NE Day 5 at page 66 (line 4) – 68 (line 29). 100 The defendant argues that the wall finishes subcontract (dated 21 December 2012) was entered into before the main contract (dated 26 December 2012). As such, it cannot be back to back with the main contract. Clause 17 of the subcontract, which requires the main contractor’s approval for any variation works claimed by the defendant, should not therefore apply to the wall finishes subcontract.185Foot Note 185×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 451.",
        "Issue (f): Section 9 of the Act and the terms of the Subcontract": "106 In paragraph 9A of the defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim, the defendant argues that cl 17 of the subcontracts is void under s 9 of the Act. Clause 17 provides that each “Sub-contract shall be on a back-to-back basis to the contract between [the plaintiff] and the [Main Contractor]”.191Foot Note 191×Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) at paragraph 9A. 107 The defendant did not pursue this argument in its written submissions. That is understandable. This argument is entirely without merit. Section 9 of the Act does not render void any of the contractual provisions on which the plaintiff relies. Section 9 of the Act reads as follows: Effect of “pay when paid provisions” 9.—(1) A pay when paid provision of a contract is unenforceable and has no effect in relation to any payment for construction work carried out or undertaken to be carried out, or for goods or services supplied or undertaken to be supplied, under the contract. (2) In this section — “money owing”, in relation to a contract, means money owing for construction work carried out, or for goods or services supplied, under the contract; “pay when paid provision”, in relation to a contract, means a provision of the contract by whatever name called — (a) that makes the liability of one party (referred to in this definition as the first party) to pay money owing to another party (referred to in this definition as the second party) contingent or conditional on payment to the first party by a further party (referred to in this definition as the third party) of the whole or any part of that money; (b) that makes the due date for payment of money owing by the first party to the second party contingent or conditional on the date on which payment of the whole or any part of that money is made to the first party by the third party; (c) that otherwise makes the liability to pay money owing, or the due date for payment of money owing, contingent or conditional on the operation of any other contract or agreement; or (d) that is of such kind as may be prescribed. Section 9 renders void a “pay when paid” clause. No aspect of the plaintiff’s case relies on a “pay when paid” clause. 108 All that the plaintiff says is that, because the contracts are expressly back-to-back, the court can draw the inference that it agreed to pay the defendant on the same basis on which it agreed to be paid by the main contractor (ie, based on the same measurements taken in the same way).192Foot Note 192×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions at paragraph 11. 109 Clause 17 is not relied on for any contractual effect, either by way of incorporating the terms of the main contract into the subcontract or otherwise. The plaintiff relies on it simply as the grounds for inviting me to draw a factual inference about the basis on which the plaintiff and the defendant contracted,ie, whether openings were to be included or excluded. 110 I have not relied on that inference in finding that there was no agreement between the parties that openings were to be included in the measurements. I have rejected the defendant’s case that there was such an agreement on an analysis of the facts. I have, however, accepted that that inference is available in relation to the basis of measurements and the accuracy of the measurements, and I have drawn that inference.",
        "The remaining aspects of the defendant’s counterclaim": "111 As previously mentioned (at [27]), the defendant also counterclaims: (a) The costs and expenses incurred in the adjudication applications; (b)  The costs and expenses incurred in the litigation arising from the adjudication applications; and (c) Damages for the expenses incurred by the defendant in extending the employment of Mr Lim. 112 There are considerable difficulties in law in the counterclaim for costs and expenses arising from the adjudication applications and the resulting litigation succeeding. InMaryani Sadeli v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other appeals[2015] 1 SLR 496, the Court of Appeal held at [20] that “[t]he general rule on the recovery of costs of previous legal proceedings as damages in subsequent proceedings is clear: such costs which were unrecovered previouslycannotbe recovered in a subsequent claim for damages, at least in so far as it involves asame-partycase.” [emphasis in original] 113 Quite apart from the legal difficulties in claiming costs as damages and quite apart from the fact that the defendant has asserted no cause of action which would it allow it to do so, the fact that the plaintiff’s position in the adjudication has been vindicated at trial indicates that the plaintiff was justified in resisting the adjudication proceedings. If that is correct, the defendant’s claim for the costs incurred in the adjudication and the associated litigation cannot succeed on the facts. 114 The defendant also counterclaims damages for the expenses it incurred in extending Mr Lim’s employment. The defendant relies on Mr Lim’s service invoice dated 3 January 2014 allegedly reflecting his charges for his services in connection with this action from August 2013 to December 2013.193Foot Note 193×Bundle of AEICs at page 573 (Low Ching Kew). 115 There is no basis on which the defendant can recover Mr Lim’s salary. First, the defendant has produced no agreement between the plaintiff and Mr Lim in support of this invoice. Second, although the service invoice indicates that Mr Lim charged a fee of $5000 per month, the payment vouchers produced involved payments of more than $5000 per month.194Foot Note 194×Bundle of AEICs at pages 573-582 (Low Ching Kew).I therefore cannot be sure of the basis on which these sums have been charged. Finally, and most importantly, there is no reason to allow this aspect of the defendant’s counterclaim because the plaintiff’s position has been vindicated entirely.",
        "Conclusion": "116 I have therefore adjudged that the defendant is liable to pay the plaintiff the sum of $904,530.53 (including goods and services tax) and interest on the said sum at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date on which the plaintiff commenced this action up to the date of judgment.195Foot Note 195×NE (26 July 2016) at page 10 (lines 7-12). 117 The defendant shall also pay the plaintiff the costs of and incidental to the claim and the counterclaim in these proceedings. Having heard the parties, and at their invitation, I have fixed those costs at $172,500. Those costs cover the entire costs of the action, save only for those costs which I have separately assessed and awarded in interlocutory proceedings. The costs I have awarded therefore include the costs of any interlocutory matters in this action for which costs were reserved.196Foot Note 196×NE (26 July 2016) at page 10 (lines 13-14).
