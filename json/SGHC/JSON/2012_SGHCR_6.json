        "The commission claim": "5       In support of the striking\n                    out application for the commission claim, counsel for Mr\n                    Singh, Mr Bajwa, put forward two main arguments. Firstly,\n                    that the contract appointing Isabel Redrup as the marketing\n                    agent for the Sophia Road properties was made between Isabel\n                    Redrup and the Association, and Mr Singh was not a party to\n                    this contract. Mr Bajwa referred to a letter dated 26 August\n                    2009 from Mr Loh, on behalf of the owners of the Sophia Road\n                    properties, to Isabel Redrup, appointing it as the sole and\n                    exclusive marketing agent of the properties for six months\n                    with effect from 25 August 2009 (“the 26 August 2009\n                    letter”). This letter listed under the heading\n                        “124 Sophia\n                    Road” the Association’s name, not Mr\n                    Singh’s name, and furthermore Mr Singh’s name\n                    did not appear anywhere on this letter. Secondly, that Mr\n                    Singh was merely a bare trustee of 124 Sophia Road, and his\n                    powers did not extend to entering into contracts or\n                    appointing agents. Therefore, Mr Singh could not have\n                    entered into such a contract to appoint an agent in any\n                    event. 6       The pith of Isabel\n                    Redrup’s case is that the defendants wrongfully did\n                    not pay it a commission which was rightfully due. This\n                    obligation to pay a commission must have emanated from an\n                    agreement to pay the same, made between Isabel Redrup and\n                    the person on whose behalf it allegedly sold 124 Sophia Road\n                    for. Who would this person be? 7       The statement of claim for S\n                    755/2011 alleges that the agreement to pay commission was\n                    made as a result of certain utterances, conduct, and/or\n                    writing between the plaintiff’s representative, Ms\n                    Prior, and the defendants’ representative, Mr Loh. The\n                    letter of 26 August 2009 which Mr Bajwa had referred to\n                    suggested that it was the Association which had entered into\n                    the contract to appoint Isabel Redrup as the marketing agent\n                    for the Sophia Road properties. It must be pointed out that\n                    the contract to appoint the marketing agent and the contract\n                    to pay the marketing agent commission are distinct. Counsel\n                    for the plaintiff in S 755/2011, Mr Vincent Yeoh (“Mr\n                    Yeoh”), sought to draw the inference that the\n                    intention of the defendants, including Mr Singh, was that\n                    they were to pay Isabel Redrup a commission upon the\n                    successful sale of the Sophia Road properties. Mr Yeoh\n                    pointed to a draft commission agreement and two draft\n                    options exhibited in Ms Prior’s affidavit, all of\n                    which referred to Mr Singh as one of the vendors of the\n                    property; and all of which indicated that the vendors were\n                    to pay the agent a commission. But these documents were\n                    unsigned and undated, and the draft options were made\n                    expressly subject to contract. It was thus difficult to draw\n                    the inference which Mr Yeoh put forward, as there was no\n                    visible concurrence to this on the part of the defendants.\n                    One of the draft options had been enclosed in an email of 30\n                    June 2010 from Mr Loh, as the defendants’\n                    representative, to Isabel Redrup. Even if this represented\n                    Mr Yeoh’s case at its highest, as evidence of the\n                    defendants’ intentions, there was still no evidence\n                    that these intentions had been consummated to form a\n                    contract. 8       The discussion in the\n                    preceding paragraph was not meant to pre-empt a\n                    determination of the merits of this case, rather, it was\n                    necessary in order to sift through the relevant documents\n                    for the purposes of this striking out application. At the\n                    end, what remains is the letter of 26 August 2009 appointing\n                    Isabel Redrup as the marketing agent for the sale of the\n                    Sophia Road properties. Although the appointment of an agent\n                    may not necessarily entail the payment of a commission; had\n                    there been an agreement to pay commission it must have been\n                    made between Isabel Redrup and the person appointing the\n                    same, which this letter indicated to be the\n                    Association. 9       Turning to the alleged\n                    agreement to pay commission, one difficulty with Mr\n                    Bajwa’s argument – that the Association, not Mr\n                    Singh, was party to this agreement – is that the\n                    Association, as an unincorporated association, cannot enter\n                    into contracts in its own name. As stated earlier at[4], unincorporated\n                    associations do not have separate legal personality, and\n                    therefore they must depend upon their members to enter into\n                    contracts on their behalf. 10     Another feature of\n                    unincorporated associations is that they cannot hold\n                    property in their own right, and one mechanism for such\n                    associations to hold property is to depend on a trustee to\n                    hold property on trust for their benefit. Mr Singh was one\n                    of the trustees of the Association, and was involved in the\n                    sale of 124 Sophia Road, which property was statutorily\n                    vested in Mr Singh’s name jointly with another trustee\n                    of the Association. Mr Singh had also signed the final\n                    option which effected the sale of 124 Sophia\n                Road. 11     The high standard of a\n                    plain and obvious case necessary for a successful striking\n                    out application was stated inGabriel\n                        Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin\n                        and others[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at\n                        [18]. In order\n                    for the statement of claim for S 755/2011 to be struck out\n                    insofar as Mr Singh is concerned, it must be plain and\n                    obvious that he is not a proper defendant. To test the\n                    strength of the arguments to strike out, it will be assumed\n                    for the sake of argument that the alleged agreement to pay\n                    Isabel Redrup a commission existed, and that it had been\n                    made by Mr Loh as a representative ofinter alia, Mr Singh. Given the extent of Mr\n                    Singh’s involvement in the sale of 124 Sophia Road, it\n                    would not be a stretch to infer that had there been such an\n                    agreement, it would have been made on his behalf. These\n                    assumptions do not pre-determine the issue of whether Mr\n                    Singh was the proper defendant, since Mr Singh would\n                    presumably have in turn been acting on behalf of the\n                    Association in entering into the commission agreement. The\n                    question remains as to whether Mr Singh in so doing could be\n                    held personally liable, or whether the Association should be\n                    the proper named defendant. 12     This question of law is\n                    not one to which there is an easy answer. On the one hand,\n                    since unincorporated associations depend on their members to\n                    enter into contracts on their behalf,vis-à-visthe contracting third party, the\n                    contracting party is the member, not the association. One\n                    question that lingers is whether it remains unfair for the\n                    contracting member to bear contractual liability for what\n                    are essentially the affairs of the association, although\n                    this concern is ameliorated by the possibility of the\n                    contracting member seeking indemnification from the\n                    association. 13     On the other hand, as Mr\n                    Bajwa had pointed out, s 35(b) of the Societies Act (Cap\n                    311, 1985 Rev Ed) states that every society registered under\n                    the Societies Act may sue or be sued in its own name. Mr\n                    Yeoh did not dispute that the Association was so registered,\n                    and the constitutional documents of the Association made\n                    reference to such registration. Pursuant to s 35(d) of the\n                    Societies Act, it seems that any judgment entered into\n                    against a society in its own name will be satisfied out of\n                    the property of the society. Yet, it must be emphasised that\n                    every societymaybe sued in\n                    its own name, and therefore s 35(b) is a permissive, rather\n                    than a mandatory provision, statutorily permitting some form\n                    of legal standing for societies in respect of litigation.\n                    The section does not discount the possibility of individual\n                    members facing suit as a result of acts undertaken on behalf\n                    of the society. 14     The position in Singapore\n                    on this question of law does not seem to be settled, and\n                    there are a sufficient number of authorities from the\n                    Commonwealth that point in either direction. Another issue\n                    to consider is whether, if the Association cannot enter into\n                    contracts in its own right, what would it mean to say that\n                    the Association could be sued in its own name, and thus\n                    potentially be made liable in its own name on those\n                    contracts? 15     Turning to Mr\n                    Bajwa’s second submission, that Mr Singh was merely a\n                    bare trustee and was therefore not empowered to enter into\n                    contracts or effect a sale of 124 Sophia Road, I agreed with\n                    Mr Yeoh’s submission that this was really a matter\n                    between Mr Singh and the members of the Association. In my\n                    view, this would go to whether Mr Singh had exceeded his\n                    powers as a trustee in any way and whether he could receive\n                    indemnification from the Association for any contractual\n                    liability he would have to bear. This was not an issue which\n                    concerned Isabel Redrup. 16     In any event, the fact\n                    that the discussion above (at[12]–[15]) was necessary shows that the question\n                    as to whether Mr Singh is a proper defendant is not one to\n                    which there is a plain and obvious answer, and therefore the\n                    application in respect of S 755/2011 is\n                dismissed.",
        "The defamation claim": "17     I move on to S 381/2011,\n                    or what was termed the defamation claim. Mr Bajwa pointed to\n                    an undated letter which purported to authorise the making of\n                    those allegedly defamatory statements by Mr Loh. This letter\n                    was allegedly signed by the “vendors” of the\n                    Sophia Road properties, which signatures appeared above the\n                    names of the vendors listed in the letter. Mr Singh’s\n                    name was among the names of the vendors listed, and there\n                    was a signature above his name. However, Mr Bajwa claimed\n                    that this signature was not that of Mr Singh, rather, it was\n                    that of the vice president of the Association; and Mr Singh\n                    therefore could not be taken to have authorised those\n                    allegedly defamatory statements. 18     The question therefore is\n                    whether it is plain and obvious that Mr Singh did not so\n                    authorise. As Mr Adrian Tan, counsel for the plaintiffs in S\n                    381/2011 pointed out, this does not turn on Mr Singh’s\n                    powers or capacity as a trustee of the Association. If it is\n                    established that Mr Singh had indeed authorised those\n                    statements, he could be personally liable whether he was\n                    acting on his own behalf or on behalf of the\n                    Association. 19     I was not of the opinion\n                    that it was so plain and obvious. Mr Singh’s name did\n                    appear on the alleged letter of authorisation, and there is\n                    a signature above it. Mr Bajwa’s submissions\n                    essentially amount to an allegation of fraud or\n                    impersonation. This allegation was not plainly or obviously\n                    made out before me, and in all likelihood substantial\n                    disputes of fact would be involved in such allegations.\n                    These would not be suitable for determination at the\n                    striking out stage.",
        "Conclusion": "20     For the reasons enumerated\n                    above, the striking out application was dismissed in its\n                    entirety, with costs of $3,500 awarded to each of the sets\n                    of lawyers for the plaintiffs in the respective\n                    suits."
