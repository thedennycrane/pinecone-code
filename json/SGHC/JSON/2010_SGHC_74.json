        "Circumstances leading to the offence": "5       The circumstances leading to the offence were\n                    slightly convoluted. The circumstances, arrest and other relevant information\n                    were set out in the agreed statement of facts (“SOF”) as\n                    follows: The Accused\n                        Persons There are seven accused persons in this case, … 2    Prior to their arrest, all the seven accused persons\n                            were working at or operating illegal gambling stalls at the back lanes\n                            between Lorong 16 and Lorong 18 in Geylang. Consequently most of the\n                            accused persons knew each other. The Accomplice Not Dealt With 3    Together with the above seven accused persons, there\n                            is an accomplice who has not been dealt with at the present moment. He\n                            is Mohamad Najiman Bin Abdull Aziz [“Mohamad Najiman”] @\n                            “Mann”, male/31 years old, NRIC No. [xxx] [DOB: 12\n                            February 1979]. The Accomplices Already Dealt With 4    In addition to the\n                            seven accused persons and Mohamad Najiman, there were two other\n                            accomplices who were arrested in connection with this case. They have\n                            since been dealt with. They are: (i)    [C], female/17 years old, NRIC No. [xxx] [DOB:\n                                8 September 1992]; and, (ii)   Nur Azimah Binte Razale [“Nur\n                                Azimah”] @ “Sepet”, female/21 years old,\n                                NRIC No. [xxx] [DOB: 8 October 1988] 5    On 30 September 2008, [C] was convicted in the\n                            Juvenile Court on an amended charge of Rioting with a Dangerous Weapon,\n                            punishable under Section 148 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev.\n                            Edn.) [“Penal Code”]. She was sentenced to two\n                            years’ detention at the Singapore Girls’ Home. On the same\n                            day, Nur Azimah, who was then the 2ndaccused’s girlfriend, was also convicted in Subordinate Court No.\n                            18 on an amended charge of Being a Member of an Unlawful Assembly\n                            punishable under Section 143 of the Penal Code. She was sentenced to\n                            undergo reformative training. 6    Like the seven accused persons, Mohamad Najiman, [C]\n                            and Nur Azimah too were earning their livelihood by working at the\n                            illegal back-lane makeshift gambling stalls. The Deceased 7    The deceased is one Seah Boon Lye @ “Ah\n                            Lye”, male/26 years old, NRIC No. [xxx] [DOB: 2 September 1981].\n                            Prior to his demise, he was staying at Blk 232 Serangoon Avenue 3\n                            #11-64, Singapore, with his father Seah Eng Kwang, wife Ng Lay Pheng and\n                            their two children, aged five and four years old. The deceased’s\n                            wife was expecting their third child at the time of the\n                        offence. Material Witness 8    The material witness to this killing is the\n                            deceased’s younger brother Seah Boon Heng [“Seah”] @\n                            “Ah Heng”, male/24 years old, NRIC No. [xxx] [DOB:\n                            12 October 1985]. He was present with the deceased at the time of\n                            the incident. Both the deceased and Seah were then involved in various\n                            illegal trades such as illegal money-lending and dealing in illegal\n                            drugs in the Geylang area. The First Information Report 9    On 23 February 2008 at about 6.31 am, the police\n                            received information routed by the Singapore Civil Defence Force\n                            [“SCDF”] Operations Room reporting a case of fighting at\n                            Lorong 10 or Lorong 12, Geylang, Singapore. Response by the SCDF 10    Following this report, paramedics from the SCDF\n                            arrived at Lorong 10 Geylang at about 6.33 am. They attended immediately\n                            to the deceased, who was seen lying in a pool of blood in the middle of\n                            road at Lorong 10 Geylang, between two coffee shops. As the deceased had\n                            no pulse and was not breathing, the paramedics proceeded to commence\n                            Cardio Respiratory Resuscitation on him, before conveying him to the\n                            hospital in the ambulance. At 6.50 am, the ambulance arrived at Tan Tock\n                            Seng Hospital [“TTSH”] and the deceased was referred to\n                            Accident and Emergency Department. Efforts to revive the deceased proved\n                            futile, and he was pronounced dead at 6.59 am. Police Investigations 11    A massive police\n                            investigation was immediately launched into the killing of the deceased,\n                            leading to the arrest of some of the accused persons the following day\n                            (i.e. 24 February 2008). The remaining accused persons were\n                            arrested in the following days thereafter. Police investigations then\n                            revealed that the deceased was killed by the accused persons following\n                            differences over two major issues the details of which are as\n                            follows. A.The Circumstances\n                            Leading to the Attack on and the Death of the\n                            Deceased (i)Purchase of Illicit\n                                Drugs by the Deceased from the 2ndaccused 12    On 18 February\n                            2008, the deceased and his brother, Seah, agreed to purchase 2.5 grams\n                            of “ICE” [“methamphetamine”] for $800 from\n                            the 2ndaccused, Suhardi, from whom they had\n                            previously purchased such\n                            drugs. 13    The\n                                2ndaccused promised the deceased and\n                            Seah that he would deliver the methamphetamine to them within 45\n                            minutes. The 2ndaccused then apparently\n                            contacted the 7th accused, Ahmad Suhaimi, who in turn made arrangements\n                            to obtain the methamphetamine from an unknown drugs supplier. The\n                                2ndaccused however failed to deliver the\n                            drugs to the deceased and Seah as promised. The deceased and Seah\n                            therefore attempted to find out the whereabouts of the\n                                2ndaccused from his friends and\n                            acquaintances in the Geylang, including some of the accused persons as\n                            well as the two accomplices, Nur Azimah (the\n                                2ndaccused’s girlfriend) and\n                            [C]. 14    On the early morning of\n                            the next day, 19 February 2008, when the deceased and Seah\n                            eventually managed to meet up with the 2ndaccused and the methamphetamine was passed over to them, they rejected\n                            the methamphetamine as the quantity handed over was substantially less\n                            than what they had paid for. The deceased and Seah then asked the\n                                2ndaccused to pay back the $800, but the\n                                2ndaccused refused. Instead, the\n                                2ndaccused called the\n                                7thaccused to explain the discrepancy in\n                            the amount of methamphetamine delivered. Eventually the\n                                2ndaccused took back the methamphetamine\n                            and assured both the deceased and Seah that he would deliver the correct\n                            quantity of methamphetamine to them later. After the\n                                2ndaccused left, the\n                                7thaccused informed the deceased and\n                            Seah that he knew some drugs suppliers and there was therefore no need\n                            for the deceased and Seah to worry about the delivery of the\n                            methamphetamine. Both the deceased and Seah however did not take kindly\n                            to what they perceived was the 7thaccused’s boasting and making of empty assurances, as they saw\n                            that he was merely a young boy then about 15 years of age, and who was\n                            attempting to trivialise the issue of the failure to deliver the drugs.\n                            Seah admonished the 7thaccused and told him\n                            not to interfere in the affair. The 7thaccused felt slighted by the deceased and Seah’s retort to\n                            him. 15    Despite his promise to\n                            deliver the correct amount of drugs, the 2ndaccused failed to deliver the methamphetamine to the deceased and Seah\n                            and remained uncontactable for the next two days. This again caused the\n                            deceased and Seah to look for some of the accused persons and the\n                            accomplices to get them to reveal the whereabouts of the\n                                2ndaccused. When the deceased and Seah\n                            subsequently bumped into the 2ndaccused’s girlfriend, Nur Azimah, the deceased and Seah pestered\n                            her about the whereabouts of the 2ndaccused.\n                            However, Nur Azimah told the deceased and Seah that she did not know the\n                            whereabouts of the 2ndaccused. She further\n                            told them to “fuck off from Geylang”. Seah became angry\n                            with Nur Azimah, and scolded her, given that the\n                                2ndaccused, who was her boyfriend, was\n                            the party at fault for failing to deliver the requisite amount of\n                            methamphetamine. 16    On an\n                            occasion, in the course of looking for the\n                                2ndaccused, the deceased and Seah drove\n                            past Lorong 18 Geylang and chanced upon a group of persons that included\n                            the 3rdand 7thaccused. When the deceased queried them about the whereabouts of the\n                                2ndaccused, the group turned hostile.\n                            Seeing that they were outnumbered, the deceased told Seah to get a\n                            watermelon knife, and thereafter brandished the knife at the group. The\n                            deceased also told them to find the 2ndaccused, who had now apparently disappeared with their\n                        $800. 17    On the same day, the\n                            deceased and Seah approached Nur Azimah again in her hotel room to ask\n                            her where the 2ndaccused was. When she again\n                            replied that she did not know, the deceased and Seah decided to take\n                            some items from Nur Azimah’s room that they suspected belonged to\n                            the 2ndaccused, as collateral for the return\n                            of the $800. The deceased then took an amplifier in the hotel room. Nur\n                            Azimah resisted attempts by the deceased and Seah to take the amplifier\n                            resulting in a scuffle between her and the deceased. In the midst of the\n                            scuffle, Nur Azimah claimed that the deceased had slapped her, although\n                            this was denied by Seah. 18    The\n                            following day, when Nur Azimah called the 2ndaccused, she told him that she was beaten up by the deceased and Seah.\n                            When Nur Azimah subsequently met the 2ndaccused in their hotel room, the latter assured her that he was going to\n                            “settle things out” with the deceased and\n                        Seah. 19    Investigations by the police\n                            also revealed that about two or three days before the commission of this\n                            offence, while they were trying to ascertain the whereabouts of the\n                                2ndaccused, the deceased and Seah met\n                            with the 1staccused, Sufian, and they\n                            proceeded to consume some drugs in the 1staccused’s hotel room. When the 1staccused fell asleep thereafter, Seah took away the\n                                1staccused’s handphone, MP4 player\n                            and portable DVD player. When the 1staccused\n                            discovered that his belongings were missing, he became angry with the\n                            deceased and Seah and told the 7thaccused in\n                            Malay“Aku kalau jumpa dorang mati lah dorang.\n                                Aku dah standby untuk gantung”(meaning,\n                            “If I meet them they will die. I am ready to be\n                            hanged”). 20    Police\n                            investigations also revealed that in that same week, the deceased and\n                            Seah had helped the 1staccused to collect\n                            his outstanding salary of $50 from the 1staccused’s former illegal gambling stall boss nicknamed\n                            “Max”. However, Seah failed to pass the money to the\n                                1staccused. 21    Police investigations\n                            further revealed that about two days before the commission of the\n                            offence, the 7thaccused and the\n                                2ndaccused started talking to some of\n                            the other accused persons, including the 1stand 3rdaccused persons, Sufian and Haziq,\n                            and Mohamad Najiman, about their troubles with the deceased and Seah.\n                            The 7thaccused told Mohamed Najiman, who was\n                            employed as a bouncer to maintain order at the gambling stalls in the\n                            back lanes, that the deceased and Seah were giving them problems. The\n                                2ndaccused also related to Mohamad\n                            Najiman about the amplifier that the deceased and Seah had taken from\n                            his room and that the deceased had pushed his girlfriend, Nur Azimah.\n                            Mohamad Najiman, who was then with the 5thaccused, Muhammad Syukur, told them “if anything happened, to\n                            call me”. 22    On 21\n                            February 2008, the deceased and Seah finally located the\n                                2ndaccused. The\n                                2ndaccused claimed that he had already\n                            handed over the $800 that they gave him to the\n                                7thaccused who was not able to obtain\n                            the correct amount of drugs. However, the deceased and Seah did not\n                            believe him, and believed that the 2ndaccused had cheated them. (ii)Missing S$200 handed to the 7th accused, Ahmad\n                                        Suhaimi 23    Police investigations\n                            further revealed that on 20 February 2008 at about 8.10 pm, one Muhammad\n                            Hafiq [“Hafiq”], a worker at one of the illegal gambling\n                            stalls and who was known to the deceased, Seah and most of the accused\n                            persons, was arrested in Geylang for offences of promoting public gaming\n                            and possession of contraband cigarettes. Hafiq was closest to the\n                                7thaccused. Later that day, Hafiq called\n                            the 7thaccused and asked him to raise $200\n                            to pay for the composition fine for the possession of the contraband\n                            cigarettes and also to post bail for\n                            him. 24    The\n                                7thaccused approached one Tan Boon Kiam\n                            [“Tan”] for help as Hafiq had worked at his illegal\n                            gambling stall. Tan worked for one Ng Kum Seng [“Ng’], who\n                            operated several gambling stalls in Geylang, and was also regarded as a\n                            senior member of the “Sio Loh Kuan” secret society group.\n                            With Ng’s agreement, Tan handed over $200 to the\n                                7thaccused in the presence of Seah. It\n                            was intended that this $200 would be used to pay Hafiq’s\n                            composition fine and that he would be bailed out. However, it later\n                            transpired that Hafiq’s composition fine was not paid and neither\n                            was he bailed out. When Tan and Ng subsequently queried the\n                                7thaccused about what happened to the\n                            S$200 handed over to him, the 7thaccused\n                            alleged that he had given the $200 to Seah. Seah however denied\n                            receiving the $200 from the 7thaccused. As a\n                            result, Tan and Ng arranged for a “settlement talk”\n                            involving themselves, the 7thaccused and\n                            Seah at Lorong 19 Geylang in the early morning of 23 February 2008 to\n                            resolve this matter. 25    The\n                                4thaccused, Jason Luo, who was\n                            previously acquainted with 1st,\n                                2nd, 3rdaccused persons and Mohamad Najiman, as they were all involved in the\n                            operation of illegal gambling stalls in Geylang, learnt from them about\n                            the 2ndaccused’s dispute with the\n                            deceased and Seah. He was also acquainted with the deceased and Seah, as\n                            he had previously borrowed money from them, and the deceased and Seah\n                            had periodically demanded the return of this money from\n                        him. 26    News of this\n                            “settlement talk” spread, and soon all accused persons\n                            became aware of this. Some of the accused persons started to ready\n                            knives to be brought along for the “settlement talk” or\n                            any other eventuality that may\n                            result. (iii)Weapons prepared to\n                            be brought for the “settlement\n                            talk” 27    The\n                                1staccused prepared a kitchen knife, the\n                            handle of which he wrapped with a white cloth as he did not want to\n                            leave his fingerprints on it. The 3rdand\n                                7thaccused also each purchased a\n                            watermelon knife to be brought for the “settlement\n                            talk”. 28    The\n                                4thaccused asked the\n                                6thaccused, Adrian, who had just started\n                            working for him a few days earlier at the illegal gambling stall, to\n                            accompany him to buy two knives. The 6thaccused agreed. The 6thaccused also agreed\n                            to the 4thaccused’s request for him to\n                            join in the fight with the deceased and Seah, if the need\n                        arose. 29    Just before 5 am on 23\n                            February 2008, the 1st,\n                                3rd, 4th,\n                                6thand 7thaccused, armed with knives, made their way to Lorong 19 Geylang for the\n                            “settlement talk”. They were joined by the\n                                2ndaccused, who claimed that he wanted\n                            to resolve the issue of non-delivery of the methamphetamine and why the\n                            deceased had slapped his girlfriend, Nur Azimah. The accomplices Nur\n                            Azimah and [C] also joined the accused persons and proceeded towards the\n                            location of the “settlement\n                            talk”. B.The\n                            “settlement\n                            talk” 30    At about 5.00 am,\n                                Tan and Ng called Seah and the 7thaccused to\n                            meet them at Lorong 19 Geylang for the “settlement talk”.\n                            The deceased and Seah arrived at the location soon thereafter. The\n                            deceased was armed with a metal rod that he concealed under his\n                            shirt’s sleeve, while Seah wore a metal belt. Shortly thereafter,\n                            a group comprising the 2nd,\n                                3rd, 4th,\n                                6thand 7thaccused who were together with [C] and Nur Azimah also arrived at Lorong\n                            19 Geylang. At around the same time, the 5thaccused and Mohamad Najiman also arrived at the scene. Upon their\n                            arrival, the 5thaccused approached the\n                                7thaccused and told him that he did not\n                            have any weapon with him, whereupon the 7thaccused handed over his watermelon knife to the\n                                5thaccused. This was witnessed by the\n                                6thaccused, who was himself armed. Soon\n                            thereafter, the 1staccused also arrived,\n                            armed with his own knife. 31    Facilitated by Tan and Ng, the initial issue discussed was between the\n                                7thaccused and Seah about the $200 that\n                            Tan passed to the 7thaccused to pay the\n                            composition fine, and which money was now unaccounted for. The\n                                7thaccused denied that he had pocketed\n                            the money, while Seah insisted that the 7thaccused did not hand over the money to him. This issue ended with the\n                                7thaccused stating that if he had taken\n                            this money, he would pay it back to Tan. The deceased and Seah then\n                            claimed that they had been cheated by the 2ndaccused of $800, which they had handed over to the\n                                2ndaccused for the purchase of\n                            methamphetamine. The 2ndaccused claimed that\n                            out of the $800, he had kept $200 as a reward for procuring the\n                            methamphetamine, while the remaining $600 was passed to the\n                                7thaccused as he was the one liaising\n                            with the drugs supplier for the supply of the\n                        methamphetamine. 32    Upon hearing\n                            this, Seah grabbed the neck of the 7thaccused, and stated that all the misunderstandings were created by him.\n                            The deceased and Seah then asked the 7thaccused to repay them $50 every day in order to repay the full $800.\n                            Before they left Lorong 19 Geylang, the deceased took the\n                                7thaccused’s handphone away, and\n                            passed it to Seah, stating that the handphone would be kept as\n                            collateral until the 7thaccused had repaid\n                            the money. Both the deceased and Seah then walked away towards Lorong 10\n                            Geylang. Tan and Ng also left the\n                            scene. C.The Pursuit of and the\n                            Attack on the Deceased and\n                            Seah 33    As the deceased and Seah\n                                walked away from Lorong 19 Geylang, Mohamad Najiman felt that the\n                            deceased should not be let off without getting back the\n                                7thaccused’s handphone. Addressing\n                            the 2ndaccused, Mohamad Najiman asked him\n                            whether he was going to allow the deceased and Seah to go just like\n                            that. According to the 2ndaccused, he also\n                            heard someone ask him whether he wanted to ask the deceased about the\n                            matter concerning “Sepet” (i.e. Nur Azimah). The\n                                1staccused also queried loudly where the\n                            deceased and Seah were going. The 1staccused\n                            then drew out his knife, and all the accused persons left Lorong 19\n                            Geylang to confront the deceased and\n                            Seah. 34    In the meantime, the\n                            deceased and Seah went into the coffee-shop located at No. 232 Geylang\n                            Road, at the vicinity of Lorong 10 Geylang, to have breakfast. As they\n                            were about to order their food, they were suddenly confronted by a group\n                            of persons led by the 2ndaccused, with the\n                                3rdaccused standing on his left. The\n                                2ndaccused shouted, “Who slapped\n                            Sepet (i.e. Nur Azimah)?” before landing a punch on the\n                            deceased’s face. This was quickly followed by some of the accused\n                            persons, who unleashed their knives to attack the deceased. Before the\n                                2ndaccused could do anything else, he\n                            realised that his right hand was slashed deeply by someone from his back\n                            and he retreated backwards out of the coffee shop to tend to his\n                            injury. 35    In the meantime,\n                            seeing that they were vastly outnumbered, Seah threw a chair and pushed\n                            a table aside. Both Seah and the deceased then ran out of the coffee\n                            shop to the road at Lorong 10 Geylang where they were chased by the\n                            accused persons. While Seah managed to run away, the deceased was\n                            confronted by the 7thaccused in the middle\n                            of the road between the two coffee shops. The deceased was floored by a\n                            kick delivered by the 7thaccused, who\n                            claimed that he saw the deceased charging at him with a metal rod\n                            raised. D.Assault on the\n                            Deceased 36    As the deceased fell\n                            to the ground, he was surrounded and attacked. Seah had, by then,\n                            managed to run further down the road along Lorong 10 Geylang, and the\n                            accused persons gave up chasing\n                            him. 37    Police investigations\n                            revealed that while the deceased was lying on the road, he was viciously\n                            attacked by all the accused persons, except the\n                                2ndaccused (whose hand had been\n                            accidentally slashed by one of his accomplices) and Mohamad Najiman, who\n                            was with other accused persons at the scene but did not himself attack\n                            the deceased. In particular, the 1staccused\n                            was particularly vicious in the assault on the deceased as the\n                            accomplice [C] and others witnessed him: (i)using his knife to slash and then stabbed the\n                                deceased’s neck, shoulder and head region; and, (ii)hold up the deceased’s right hand and\n                                slash the deceased’s lower right arm. 38    The 1staccused also\n                            admitted in his statement to the police that he was so angry with the\n                            deceased that “I took out my knife and stabbed Ah Lye (i.e. the\n                            deceased) once on his back somewhere near the left side of his shoulder\n                            and neck region”. 39    In his statement to the police, the\n                                3rdaccused admitted that after seeing\n                            the 1staccused person slash the deceased on\n                            his neck region, he slashed the deceased on his right shoulder, right\n                            elbow and right leg with his knife. 40    The 4thaccused admitted\n                            in his statements that he was present at the settlement talk and had\n                            subsequently followed the deceased and Seah to Lorong 10 Geylang with\n                            the others. When he saw the deceased being attacked, he took out his\n                            knife and “sliced the deceased on his [right] upper arm and the\n                            deceased dropped to the floor”. 41    In his statements to the police, the\n                                5thaccused admitted that he was\n                            recruited by Mohamad Najiman to assist him in his work as a bouncer at\n                            the gambling stalls. On the morning of the incident, he stated that\n                            Mohamad Najiman had told him that the 2ndand\n                            the 7thaccused were\n                            “surrounded” by Chinese people and suggested that they go\n                            over to take a look. On arriving at Lorong 19 Geylang, they saw the\n                                7thaccused arguing with the deceased and\n                            Seah. The 5thaccused stated that “he\n                            felt a sudden surge of aggressiveness”. He approached the\n                                7thaccused and asked him if he had a\n                            knife. Later the 7thaccused passed a\n                            watermelon knife to him, which he then concealed under his waist and his\n                            T-shirt. He too followed the others when they went to confront the\n                            deceased and Seah at Lorong 10 Geylang. On the road, he saw that the\n                            deceased was surrounded by at least five or six male subjects. They were\n                            punching and kicking the deceased. The 5thaccused stated that he found a space for himself and sliced the deceased\n                            once on his right arm with his watermelon knife and another time on his\n                            leg. 42    In his statements, the\n                                6thaccused admitted that when the\n                            deceased was lying on the road at Lorong 10 Geylang, he slashed his\n                            lower arm and back about three to four times. However, there was no\n                            blood on his knife as he had slashed the deceased\n                            “lightly”. The 6thaccused also\n                            stated that thereafter, when Seah ran back towards the deceased with the\n                            iron rod that was with the deceased earlier, he took out his knife and\n                            challenged Seah to come forward. However, Seah fled and he (i.e. the\n                                6thaccused) also left the\n                        scene. 43    After the assault, Mohamad Najiman, who had himself\n                            not assaulted the deceased, shouted “cukup” (meaning\n                            enough) in Malay and all the accused persons fled the scene. After the\n                            accused persons had left, Seah returned to the scene and approached the\n                            deceased, who was lying in a pool of blood on the road. He noticed that\n                            the deceased’s lips had turned pale, and that the deceased did not\n                            respond to his calls. 44    Meanwhile, the 1st,\n                                2nd, 3rd,\n                                4th, and 7thaccused together with [C] ran into Nur Azimah near Lorong 12 Geylang,\n                            and all of them returned to the 2ndaccused’s hotel room nearby, where the\n                                2ndaccused’s injured hand was\n                            dressed. 45    Police investigations further reveal that after the\n                            assault on the deceased, while they were leaving the scene, the\n                                1staccused told the\n                                6thaccused that the deceased\n                            “confirmed will die”. Along the way near Lorong 14\n                            Geylang, the 1staccused also met one Fareed\n                            Bin Serlan, a friend who was also working at the illegal gambling stalls\n                            in the back lanes of Geylang, and told him that he had stabbed the\n                            deceased in the neck, and that the deceased was going to die. The\n                                1staccused also subsequently told Mak\n                            Kian Chye, another co-worker at the illegal gambling stalls, and Nur\n                            Azimah, that he had stabbed the deceased in the neck. 46    While fleeing from the scene, the\n                                4thand 6thaccused separately hid their knives in an incense burning pit at the\n                            back-lane of Lorong 16 Geylang. The 1staccused also handed over his knife to the 4thaccused, who similarly hid the knife in the same pit. Later the\n                                7thaccused handed over another knife to\n                            the 4thaccused at the said place. These\n                            knives were subsequently recovered by the police (see paragraph 51\n                            below) in the course of police investigations and sent to the Health\n                            Sciences Authority [“HSA’] for examination. The\n                                3rdaccused claimed that he threw his\n                            watermelon knife into a drain opposite Hotel 81 Palace, along Lorong 16\n                            Geylang. The 5thaccused claimed that he\n                            threw his watermelon knife into the Kallang River near his residence.\n                            These knives were not recovered. Medical Report on the Deceased 47    A medical report\n                            submitted by Dr. Ooi Chee Kheong of the Emergency Department at\n                            TTSH revealed that the deceased was found with the following injuries\n                            upon his arrival to the hospital: (i)    Bruises and abrasions over the right eyebrow\n                                and forehead; (ii)   Wound over the right side of the head\n                                measuring 20 cm with underlying skull fracture; (iii)   Wound extending from the right ear to the\n                                base of neck measuring 30 cm; (iv)   Wound over the base of the neck measuring 3\n                                cm; (v)    Laceration of right ear; (vi)   Bruise over the right maxilla\n                            (cheek); (vii)  Wound over the right side of the back\n                                measuring 10 cm; (viii)  Wound over the left side of the back\n                                measuring 5 cm; (ix)   Multiple abrasions over the\n                            back; (x)    Right wrist near amputation;\n                            and, (xi)   Wound over the right calf measuring\n                                10cm.

In his interviews with the Prosecution,\n                            Dr Teo Eng Swee further stated that he was of the opinion that\n                            injuries (viii) [injury No. 8 at page 5 of the Autopsy Report] and (xii)\n                            above [injury No. 13 at page 6 of the Autopsy Report] were sufficient to\n                            cause death in the ordinary course of nature. Arrest of the Accused Persons 50    On the day after the\n                            offence (i.e. 24 February 2008), following successful ambushes, the\n                                1st, 2nd,\n                                3rdand 7thaccused were arrested at various locations in\n                            Singapore. 51    The following day,\n                            on 25 February 2008, the 4thaccused was\n                            arrested at the back-lane of Lorong 16 Geylang. He subsequently led the\n                            police to an incense burning pit at the immediate vicinity to recover\n                            four knives which were subsequently confirmed to have been used to\n                            attack the deceased. The descriptions of the knives are as\n                            follows: (i)    One kitchen knife with a blade measuring 22.5\n                                cm [marked\n                                “GLT-04”] (ii)   One kitchen knife with a blade measuring 20\n                                cm [marked\n                                “GLT-05”] (iii)   One kitchen knife with a blade measuring\n                                22.5 cm [marked\n                                “GLT-06”] (iv)   One kitchen knife with a blade measuring 19\n                                cm [marked\n                                “GLT-07”] 52    On 12 March 2008, Mohamad Najiman was\n                            apprehended at his residence. Following an ambush, the\n                                5thaccused was arrested at Ang Mo Kio\n                            Avenue 5 on 13 March 2008. On 15 March 2008, the\n                                6thaccused was arrested pursuant to a\n                            warrant of arrest issued against him in connection to the\n                            deceased’s death by Ang Mo Kio Police Division patrol officers,\n                            who were attending to a case of noise pollution at Yishun Street\n                            11. Reports from HSA (i)Lab No. CR-2008-00075 dated 22 August\n                            2008 53The Criminalistics Laboratory Report prepared by\n                            Kee Koh Kheng, a scientist with the HSA, stated that fibres similar to\n                            the deceased’s shirt were found on the knives marked\n                            “GLT-05”, “GLT-06” and\n                            “GLT-07”. The report also stated that the tears and damage\n                            consisting of a combination of cuts and tears found on the shirt and\n                            shorts worn by the deceased at the time of the offence, and the damage\n                            and cut found on the deceased’s shoes could have been made by a\n                            tool with a sharp or blunt cutting edge, such as the knives marked\n                            “GLT-04”, “GLT-05”, “GLT-06”\n                            and “GLT-07”. (ii)Lab No. DN-2008-00403 dated 1 Sep\n                            2008 54The DNA Report prepared by Ang Hwee Chen, a\n                            forensic scientist with the HSA, stated that the\n                                1staccused’s DNA, alongside the\n                            DNA of the deceased and others unknown, was found on the knife marked\n                            “GLT-05”. The report further stated that the\n                                6thaccused’s DNA was found on the\n                            knife marked “GLT-06”. (iii)Lab No. DN-2008-00453 dated 8 Sep\n                            2008 55Another DNA Report prepared by Ang Hwee Chen stated\n                            that the deceased’s DNA was found on the\n                                3rdaccused’s right slipper, which\n                            he wore at the time of the offence. The report further stated that the\n                            deceased’s DNA was also found on the\n                                7thaccused’s black T-shirt and\n                            right slipper, which he wore at the time of the offence. Conclusion 56    The accused persons were members of an unlawful\n                            assembly, whose common object was to cause grievous hurt to the deceased\n                            and Seah. While being members of the said unlawful assembly the\n                                1st, 3rd,\n                                4th, 5th, and\n                                6thaccused persons were armed with\n                            knives that were intended to cause grievous injuries to the deceased and\n                            Seah. 57    In furtherance of the common object of the said\n                            unlawful assembly, Mohamad Najiman and the\n                                1staccused instigated the other accused\n                            persons to attack the deceased and Seah at Lorong 10 Geylang. The\n                                2ndaccused started the assault by\n                            punching the deceased while the 7thaccused\n                            kicked the deceased, causing him to fall onto the road. Thereafter, the\n                            deceased was attacked with knives by the 1st,\n                                3rd, 4th,\n                                5th, and 6thaccused persons. Blows and kicks were also inflicted on the deceased as\n                            he lay on the road. The deceased died from the injuries inflicted on him\n                            as a consequence, which injuries the accused persons knew to be likely\n                            to be inflicted in the prosecution of the common object of that\n                            assembly.",
        "Reasons for sentencing": "6       Counsel for B3 sought probation or reformative\n                    training. Counsel for B5, B6 and B7 submitted that reformative training was\n                    appropriate. Counsel for B1 submitted that the sentence should not be life\n                    imprisonment. Counsel for B2 submitted that the custodial sentence should not be\n                    more than ten years and that B2 should receive the least severe of the\n                    sentences. Counsel for B4 submitted that a sentence of less than ten years would\n                    be appropriate. 7       The prosecution submitted that the principles of\n                    retribution, deterrence and prevention should prevail. The prosecution sought a\n                    custodial sentence towards the upper end of 20 years’ imprisonment for B3\n                    to B7 and life imprisonment for B1 and B2. 8       I have considered whether rehabilitation should\n                    be the dominant consideration especially for each of those accused persons below\n                    the age of 21 years of age. 9       InPublic Prosecutor v Leong\n                        Soon Kheong[2009] 4 SLR(R) 63, the Court of Appeal\n                    said at [26] to [28] and [31]: 26    In this genre of group violence, the two most\n                            pressing sentencing considerations are the principles of general\n                            deterrence and retribution. In PP v Law Aik Meng [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 , the High Court\n                            emphatically underscored the particular relevance of general deterrence\n                            in cases involving group offences. The court noted at\n                        [25(b)]: Examples of particular circumstances of an offence which may attract\n                        general deterrence include: ... (b)    Group/syndicate offences: The fact that an offence\n                            was committed by two or more persons may be regarded as an aggravating\n                            factor (see Sentencing Practice at p 84). Group offences generally\n                            result in greater harm. Another significant factor is that the victim is\n                            likely to be in greater fear in cases where physical intimidation is\n                            exerted. Further, group pressure to perpetuate such offences may add to\n                            their persistency, and group dynamics necessarily imply greater harm or\n                            damage: see Professor Andrew Ashworth in Sentencing and Criminal Justice\n                            (Cambridge University Press, 2005, 4th Ed) ('Sentencing and Criminal\n                            Justice') at p 157. ... [emphasis in original] 27    Furthermore, the court noted (at [25(c)]), that\n                            gratuitous violence would fall under the broad category of public\n                            disquiet, which would also invoke the principle of general deterrence.\n                            As was said in PP v V Murugesan [2005] SGHC 160 (at [55]),\"[violent]\n                            [p]erpetrators are punished not just for the physical harm they inflict\n                            but also for the life-long trauma, debilitating emotional distress and\n                            anguish they callously and cruelly inflict and sentence their victims to\n                            suffer in silence\". To this, we need only add that the traumatic effect\n                            of a violent crime on a victim's family and loved ones ought not to be\n                            forgotten. 28    This is not to say that other sentencing\n                            considerations such as specific deterrence and rehabilitation are\n                            invariably irrelevant in cases such as this. Their relevance and the\n                            weightage to be given will have to be assessed carefully in the light of\n                            the circumstances prevailing in each matter. … 31    In our view, relevant considerations in sentencing\n                            (some of which may be aggravating factors) for group violence include\n                            facts such as: (a)    the actual train of events leading to the attack.\n                            It will be relevant to take into account the level of pre-meditation or\n                            planning involved. This is not to say, however, that incidents that\n                            erupt suddenly are to be evaluated more benignly; (b)    the number of offenders involved; (c)    whether weapons were used. This factor is usually\n                            connected with the level of planning that precedes an incident: see (a)\n                            above. The use of a weapon is often an aggravating circumstance although\n                            the absence of one is at best a neutral consideration. A fist can also\n                            be a lethal instrument of harm; (d)    the response of the victim to the attack.\n                            Assaulting a defenceless and vulnerable victim who offers no resistance\n                            can never be viewed lightly. This, of course, does not mean that the\n                            response of a victim who seeks to protect himself can ever justify an\n                            attack or the continuation thereof; (e)    the duration of the attack; (f)    the extent and nature of the injuries inflicted on\n                            the victim; (g)    the role and participation of each of the\n                            offender(s) in the sequence of events leading to as well as during the\n                            attack, assuming this can be clearly delineated; (h)    the reasons for the assault including the\n                            existence of \"provocation\" by the victim. Here, we should add that any\n                            manner of retaliatory conduct by the accused, short of what is\n                            permissible under the PC, ought not to be condoned; (i)    the level of public fear or alarm generated by the\n                            incident; (j)    the nature of violence involved; (k)    whether gratuitous violence was\n                        involved; (l)    the commission of any other offence by the\n                            offender(s) during the course of the attack; (m)    the prevalence of the particular offence;\n                            and (n)    whether the violence was directed against a\n                            vulnerable victim. [emphasis in original] 10     In the circumstances before me, there was some\n                    pre-meditation and planning. The group was planning to act violently and that\n                    was why some of them armed themselves before going for the “settlement\n                    talk”. Even then, the attack did not occur at the talk but only after the\n                    talk ended and the deceased and Seah had gone away. They were having breakfast\n                    when the group set upon them. The group comprised seven or more persons and\n                    knives were used. The attack was not confined to the coffee shop. The group\n                    continued to chase the deceased and Seah as they ran out of the coffee shop.\n                    Seah managed to run away but the deceased was confronted again in the middle of\n                    the road between two coffee shops and was floored by a kick. The group then\n                    surrounded and attacked him, except that B2 and Mohamed Najiman did not\n                    personally attack the deceased then. Multiple serious and vicious injuries were\n                    inflicted on the deceased. The attacks took place in a public place and must\n                    have caused alarm and fear to innocent bystanders. Indeed, they were at risk of\n                    serious injury as can be seen by the fact that B2 was himself injured, probably\n                    by one of the attackers. 11     B2 and Mohamed Najiman appeared to be the\n                    leaders. B2 was also the one who signalled the attack by landing the first blow\n                    on the deceased although he himself was not armed. 12     B2 and B7 were the most responsible, among the\n                    accused persons, for the matters that gave rise to the tension with the deceased\n                    and Seah, although B7 was the youngest among the accused persons. B7 was not\n                    armed during the attacks but that was because he had handed his weapon to\n                    B5. 13     B1 did query loudly where the deceased and\n                    Seah were going. Presumably, this was the instigation by B1 which the\n                    prosecution was referring to (see paras 33 and 57 of the agreed SOF). However,\n                    the person who led the group to go after Seah and the deceased was B2 (see para\n                    34 of the agreed SOF). B1 also had reasons to be angry as his personal\n                    belongings were taken by Seah. He did make a statement to suggest that he would\n                    kill the deceased and Seah (see para 19 of the agreed SOF) but that could have\n                    been his instantaneous response upon discovering that items were missing. He\n                    also did make a statement after the group was leaving the scene that the\n                    deceased “confirmed will die” (see para 45 of the agreed SOF) but\n                    it is not clear whether that was a boast or not. 14     B1 was said to be particularly vicious (see\n                    para 37 of the agreed SOF which also states that the deceased was viciously\n                    attacked by all the accused persons). 15     B6’s knife did not have any blood but,\n                    in my view, that was fortuitous. There was no suggestion that he deliberately\n                    missed his target. 16     On the other hand, the deceased and his\n                    brother were partly to blame for the tension which arose and which led to the\n                    attacks. The deceased was also armed with a metal rod. 17     Having considered all the circumstances,\n                    including the seriousness of the nature of the offence, I am of the view that\n                    deterrence and retribution are the more pressing considerations. A strong signal\n                    must be sent to those who are minded to group or gang together to attack others\n                    in a public place that such attacks will be treated severely. Accordingly, I am\n                    of the view that reformative training is not appropriate for those accused\n                    persons below the age of 21. I would however mention that I am not saying that\n                    reformative training is never appropriate in a case including s 304(a) read\n                    with s 149. It depends on the circumstances. 18     As for all the accused persons, I am of the\n                    view that they should all be treated similarly except for B2. I do not accept\n                    the prosecution’s submission that B1 should be treated more harshly and be\n                    placed in the same category as B2 because he had attacked more vigorously than\n                    the others and because of the statements he had made before and after the\n                    attacks. Considering the totality of all the evidence and his role in the\n                    matter, I am of the view that the points mentioned by the prosecution did not\n                    justify treating B1 more harshly. 19     As for B2, he is the oldest of the accused\n                    persons. He and B7 were the most responsible among the accused persons for the\n                    tension which arose. He was also a leader among the accused persons. He led them\n                    to the coffee shop and landed the first blow which signalled the attack.\n                    Although he stopped participating in the attacks, this was not due to an act of\n                    restraint on his part but because he had been inadvertently\n                injured. 20     In addition, B2 has an antecedent of a violent\n                    crime whilst being a member of an unlawful assembly which resulted in the death\n                    of the victim. On 29 January 2004, he was convicted in DAC No 51846 of 2003\n                    on a charge under s 325 read with s 149 of the Penal Code of\n                    voluntarily causing grievous hurt and was sentenced by a District Court to six\n                    years and 12 strokes of the cane. There was a fatality in this\n                incident. 21     He was also on the same day convicted and\n                    sentenced as follows: (a)     in DAC No 23998 of 2003 on a charge\n                        under s 147 of the Penal Code – three years’ imprisonment\n                        and six strokes of the cane (the sentence of imprisonment to run\n                        concurrently with DAC 51846 of 2003). Apparently, there were two persons who\n                        were injured in this incident; (b)     in DAC No 23999 of 2003 on a charge under s 379 of\n                        the Penal Code – nine months’ imprisonment (the sentence to run\n                        consecutively with DAC No 51846 of 2003). He was released\n                    from prison on 5 December 2007 and committed the present offence within a\n                    few months,ie, on 23 February\n                2008. 22     On the other hand, I have taken into account\n                    the following as well: (a)     All the accused persons pleaded\n                        guilty; (b)     B3 to\n                        B7 were below 21 years of age when the crime was committed and B1 was 22\n                        years of age; (c)     B1, B3, B5 to B7 were first time offenders in respect of a violent crime.\n                        In this regard, I did not single out B4 for harsher sentence in the totality\n                        of the circumstances even though he had been convicted and sentenced to one\n                        month’s imprisonment for a charge under s 332 of the Penal Code,\n                        which involved voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant. Neither did the\n                        prosecution press for a harsher sentence for him. (d)     The deceased and Seah were not\n                        entirely innocent victims. They had contributed to the events which led to\n                        the attacks. The deceased himself was armed with a metal rod. However, I did\n                        not accept the submissions of various defence counsel that those accused\n                        persons who were armed, were armed solely for the purpose of defence as a\n                        result of past incidents and in view of the “settlement\n                        talk”. 23     I have also considered sentencing precedents\n                    for s 304(a) offences. In doing so, I took into account the fact that under\n                    the previous s 304(a), the permissible custodial sentence was life\n                    imprisonment or imprisonment for up to ten years whereas under the present\n                    s 304(a), it is life imprisonment or imprisonment for up to 20 years. The\n                    liability in principle for fine or caning remains the same. 24     In the circumstances, I sentence the first and\n                    third to seventh accused persons as follows: (a)B1-12 years’ imprisonment\n                                            from 26 February 2008 (being the date of first\n                                            arraignment) and ten strokes of the\n                                    cane.(b)B3-12 years’ imprisonment\n                                            from 26 February 2008 (being the date of first\n                                            arraignment) and ten strokes of the\n                                    cane.(c)B4-12 years’ imprisonment\n                                            from 27 February 2008 (being the date of first\n                                            arraignment) and ten strokes of the\n                                    cane.(d)B5-12 years’ imprisonment\n                                            from 14 March 2008 (being the date of first\n                                            arraignment) and ten strokes of the\n                                    cane.(e)B6-12 years’ imprisonment\n                                            from 16 March 2008 (being the date of first\n                                            arraignment) and ten strokes of the\n                                    cane.(f)B7-12 years’ imprisonment\n                                            from 26 February 2008 (being the date of first\n                                            arraignment) and ten strokes of the\n                                    cane.   25     I sentence B2 to 20 years’ imprisonment\n                    from 26 February 2008 (being the date of first arraignment) and 18 strokes\n                    of the cane."
