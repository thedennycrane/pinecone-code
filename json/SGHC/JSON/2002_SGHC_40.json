        "Introduction": "l. This was an action by Tai Sea Nyong (Tai) against Overseas Union Bank\n\nLtd (OUB/the bank) for damages suffered as a result of OUBs alleged breach of duty as a\n\nmortgagee in possession. Tai had mortgaged No. 20 Leedon Road (the Property) to OUB and the\n\nbank repossessed the Property when he defaulted on his loans. He alleged that OUB sold the Property\n\nwithout taking all reasonable steps to obtain its true market value. Tai also claimed that OUB had\n\nan obligation to rent out the Property prior to its sale and should account to him for such notional\n\nrent. At the conclusion of the ten (10) days trial, I dismissed Tais claim as being totally\n\ndevoid of merit; he has now appealed against my decision (in Civil Appeal No. 600147 of 2001).",
        "Undisputed facts": "2. OUB extended loan and credit facilities to Tai which were secured by the\n\nProperty as well as his factory at No. 34 Kaki Bukit Place. In the middle of 1999, Tais business\n\n(Hilamda Pte Ltd) suffered a cash flow problem and he defaulted on his loan. As a result, OUB took\n\nout an action (in Originating Summons No. 1009 of 1999) to repossess the Property. On 6 August 1999,\n\nOUB obtained an Order of Court which inter alia, gave it possession of the Property within 14 days,\n\njudgment against Tai in the sum of $15,442,564.76 and the power to sell the Property. However, Tai\n\ndid not vacate the Property by 20 August 1999. Instead, he instructed his solicitors to write two\n\nletters to OUBs solicitors (and he also wrote to OUB directly) between 18 August and 31 August,\n\nseeking repeated extensions of time to remain on the Property, on the basis that he was carrying out\n\nnegotiations to sell the Property. On 31 August 1999, OUB gave Tai an ultimatum to vacate the\n\nProperty or face contempt proceedings. He did not comply; instead, he instructed his solicitors to\n\nseek another extension of time on 3 September 1999. On 13 September 1999, OUB commenced contempt\n\nproceedings against Tai and successfully obtained an Order of Court for vacant possession of the\n\nProperty by 12 November 1999. Tai breached this Order, was fined ($2,500) for contempt of court in\n\nOriginating Summons No. 1009 of 1999 and finally delivered up vacant possession on 19 November 1999.3. After taking possession, OUB took steps to sell the Property. In early\n\nDecember 1999, the bank engaged two estate agencies, Edmund Tie and Co. (Edmund Tie) and\n\nFPDSavills (Savills) to do valuations of the Property; the bank also engaged its associate\n\nOverseas Union Realty Services (OURS) to maintain the Property.4. In mid-December 1999, OUB orally instructed Knight Frank Pte Ltd (Knight\n\nFrank) to market the Property; the company was formally appointed by the bank's letter dated 9\n\nFebruary 2000. As part of its marketing efforts, Knight Frank direct-mailed to clients on its\n\ndatabase, fixedFOR SALEsignboards at the Property and advertised the auctions scheduled for\n\n6 January and 9 March, 2000, in the English and Chinese dailies. At the two (2) auctions, the\n\nreserve price ($12.6m) of the Property set by OUB was not reached. Indeed, there were no bids and no\n\none approached the auctioneers privately after the auction either. Knight Frank also advertised the\n\nProperty for sale by private treaty, following the auctions. However, no offers were received,\n\ndespite these efforts.5. In mid-March 2000, the bank was told by Knight Frank the company had received\n\nan offer of $10.9m for the Property. This was followed by an offer on 17 March 2000 made through\n\nColliers Jardine (Singapore) Pte Ltd (Colliers) from Prospect Investment Pte Ltd. (Prospect)\n\nof $11.5m. On 10 April 2000, OUBs solicitors wrote to Tais solicitors to inform Tai of these\n\noffers and invited him to better these offers in two weeks, failing which OUB would sell the\n\nProperty. On 13 April 2000, OUB received a better offer of $11.7m through Knight Frank. OUB informed\n\nColliers of the same as which result Prospect increased its offer to $11.7m. Tai did not revert to\n\nOUB within the two weeks deadline or at all. Consequently, on 16 May 2000, OUB granted Prospect an\n\noption to purchase the Property at $11.7m which was exercised on 30 May 2000; the sale was completed\n\non 22 August 2000.",
        "The plaintiffs case": "6. Tai brought up three (3) reasons to found his claim that OUB breached its duty\n\nas mortgagees in exercising the power of sale by not taking reasonable steps to obtain the true\n\nmarket value of the Property; these claims were denied by OUB. Tai alleged:-the Property was sold at an undervalue as it was below the open market valuation of the\n\n    Property;the steps taken to sell the Property were inadequate because the marketing and conduct of the\n\n    sale were shoddily done by OUB and Knight Frank;OUB failed to properly maintain the Property so that it could be sold at its true market\n\n    value.7. Tai relied on the testimonies of two (2) professional valuers namely, Seow It\n\nSze @ Ibrahim Abdullah (Seow) and Tang Kok Kong (Tang), to establish the true market\n\nvalue of the Property. Seow (who described himself as an expert valuer) said he had worked in the\n\nreal estate line since 1972 whilst Tang (from Henry Butcher Appraisal Group) has had 24 years'\n\nexperience in valuation. Both witnesses testified that the Property was sold at an undervalue\n\nbecause the price achieved reflected the forced sale value and not the open market value, of the\n\nProperty. They agreed that the definition of a \"forced sale\" by the International\n\nValuation Standards Committee was correct; that definition states:price which arises from disposition under extraordinary or atypical\n\n  circumstances, usually reflecting an inadequate marketing period without reasonable publicity, and\n\n  sometimes reflecting an unwilling seller condition, and/or disposal under compulsion or duress.However, they testified that the forced sale value of the Property was irrelevant\n\nand OUB should have obtained the open market value for the Property since it had a reasonable\n\ntime-frame in which to market and sell the Property properly, notwithstanding it was a mortgagee\n\nsale.8. Seow (PW2) assessed the market value of the Property to be $15.8m as at 16 May\n\n2000. He said he had inspected the Property (from the outside only) and based his valuation on the\n\nproperty remaining in its existing state and without redevelopment potential. In his\n\ncross-examination (NE114-115) Seow said he had taken into account various negative features of the\n\nProperty although he did not record them in his report (dated 3 September 2001) or mention them in\n\nhis examination-in-chief. Seow testified that the valuations done by the bank's experts Nicolas\n\nCheng (Cheng) and David Chia (Chia) were inaccurate. Cheng had valued the open market\n\nvalue of the Property at $14m while Chias valuation was $13m. However, no reasons were offered as\n\nto why their values were wrong. Seow did not think that the value accepted by the property tax\n\ndepartment of the Inland Revenue Authority (IRAS) i.e. $11.7m reflected the correct value of the\n\nProperty. He said this was because IRAS used different criteria and was prompted by reasons\n\ndifferent from valuers in assessing the market value of the Property.9. Tangs valuation (dated 19 February 2001) of the market value of the\n\nProperty was $14.525m as of 16 May 2000. Like Seow, Tang (PW4) never saw the interior of the\n\nProperty but relied on Tais description which not unexpectedly, painted the Property in glowing\n\nterms. It is noteworthy that by the dates of their valuations, the house on the Property had already\n\nbeen demolished. In his report, Tang stated that he relied on current prices paid for five (5)\n\nproperties that were considered similar to the Property which prices he then adjusted to take into\n\naccount negative aspects of the Property. Questioned by counsel for the bank (NE232), Tang agreed\n\nthat Chengs valuation of $14m was reasonable. He also agreed that the comparables which Cheng and\n\nChia took into account were reasonable (save for No. 2 Dalvey Estate used by Chia which was a\n\nconservation bungalow). His only comment was that Cheng should have considered the re-development\n\npotential of the Property and if he had done so, the valuation would have been closer to his own.\n\nHowever, Tang rejected the value of $11.7m accepted by IRAS as an indication of the market value of\n\nthe Property.10. With respect to the marketing of the Property, Tai relied on the testimony of\n\nTan Wee Seng (Tan), a real estate agent who had 20 years of experience in marketing various\n\ntypes of properties in Singapore. Tan (PW3) criticised Knight Franks marketing efforts for the\n\nfollowing reasons:(a) Knight Frank did not place more prominent advertisements (10 cm x 3\n\n  columns) to highlight the re-development potential of the Property. These advertisements should be\n\n  made exclusively for the Property and placed in major English and Chinese newspapers at least\n\n  three (3) times a week;(b) Knight Frank should have properly maintained the Property and conducted\n\n  more \"open houses\" during the weekends;(c) Knight Frank should have placed prominent \"For Sale\" signs at the\n\n  Property which should also emphasise its re-development potential.11. In addition, although Tang and Seow were not experts on marketing, they\n\ntestified that the reason the bank did not obtain the open market valuation and hence the true\n\nmarket value of the Property was due to OUB's failure to properly market the Property. According to\n\nSeow, it was unreasonable of OUB to accept the offer of $11.7m after two failed auctions, even\n\nthough interest on the principal debt owed by Tai was accruing at $1.5m a year. He suggested that\n\nOUB should have looked at the marketing process and in the meantime, should not accept such a low\n\noffer. As for Tang, he testified that when Knight Frank failed to sell the Property in the two\n\nauctions, OUB should have continued its attempts to sell the Property at the market value instead of\n\nconcluding the sale hastily at its forced sale value.12. Knight Frank was also criticised for marketing the Property during the\n\nChristmas/school holidays periods when buying interest would be low. Tai further complained that he\n\nwas given insufficient time (namely two weeks) to come up with a better offer before the Property\n\nwas eventually sold to Prospect; as such, OUB failed to give him a realistic opportunity to market\n\nthe Property himself.13. Tai claimed that OUB had rejected the offers he had received in\n\nAugust/September 1999 ranging between $12.3m to $15.5m. His evidence was that he had informed OUB in\n\nwriting of the identities of potential buyers of the Property. However, OUB failed to follow-up on\n\nany of the potential purchasers. He also relied on the evidence of Calvin King (King), a\n\nbusinessman who made an offer in February 1999 of US $11m for his business, to be secured by his\n\nfactory and the Property. This offer was revoked in September 1999 when Tai informed King (PW5) that\n\nthe Property/the factory had been re-possessed. Tai relied on Kings testimony to prove he had an\n\noffer equivalent to $16m for the Property, which OUB did not pursue.14. With respect to OUBs alleged failure to maintain the Property, Tai\n\ntestified he had informed OUB by a letter dated 18 November 1999 that he would be terminating the\n\nelectricity and utility supplies to the Property. In addition, he also forwarded the keys for the\n\nauto-gate to OUBs solicitors on the same date. According to Tai, OUB did not object and he\n\nproceeded to terminate those services on or about 3 December 1999. OUBs solicitors wrote to Tai\n\non 8 March 2000 to complain that its agents could not enter the Property because OUB only had the\n\nauto-gate control which required electricity to work, which supply had been cut off. Tai thereby\n\ninferred that OUB did not have access to the Property from December 2000 till March 2000 for\n\npurposes of maintenance. In addition, he concluded that the lack of access meant that Knight Frank\n\ndid not conduct \"open houses\" to market the Property. Tai relied on a letter dated 1 March\n\n2000 from Alexander Pool Specialists (the company hired by OUB to carry out pool maintenance) to OUB.\n\nThis letter informed OUB that the bank had locked the gate for 2 weeks, the swimming pool was very\n\ndirty and the water had turned green. Tai claimed that this showed that the pool had not been\n\nmaintained.15. Apart from claiming that OUB breached its duties when it sold the Property\n\nfor $11.7m, Tai also alleged that the Property was left vacant for ten (10) months from November\n\n1999 to August 2000, when OUB should have rented it out.",
        "The defendants case": "16. OUB called Cheng and Chia to testify on the forced sale and open market\n\nvalues of the Property. They said it was not possible to achieve the market value of the Property\n\nwhen it was sold in a mortgagees sale, even with proper marketing. Cheng is the executive\n\ndirector of DTZ Debenham Tie Leung (formerly Edmund Tie) and has been a property valuer for 15 years\n\nwhile Chia, the managing-director of Savills, has 20 years' similar experience.17. Both Cheng and Chia took into account similar considerations in assessing the\n\nvalue of the Property. In their reports, they identified two common negative characteristics of the\n\nProperty which affected its value:-(a) the Property was located at the T-junction of Leedon Road and Ford Avenue,\n\n  which meant that it had bad fengshui or geomancy;(b) the Property was next to an 11-storey condominium development known as Jade\n\n  Mansion and thus suffered from constant lack of privacy, an important consideration affecting the\n\n  minds of buyers of such good class bungalows.In addition, Cheng (DW6) considered the negative implications (for rebuilding\n\nbecause it required levelling) of the undulating terrain of the Property and the age (40 odd years)\n\nof the house, albeit it was extensively renovated in 1992. Neither took into account the\n\nre-development potential of the Property.18. Like Tang, Cheng and Chia used the comparative sales method of valuation and\n\nlooked at the sale price of comparable properties that were selected because they were large\n\nfreehold lands and, were sold relatively shortly before the valuation of the Property. Two of the\n\nproperties are also in the same vicinity as the Property. The comparable properties used by both\n\nwitnesses are as follows:NoPropertyArea(sq. ft)TenureDate of SalePrice($million)Rate(p.s.f)Type124 Leedon Road22,329Free-holdMay 19997.6340Old single storey bungalow undergoing redevelopment25 Leedon Park37,876Free-holdSept. 199915.5409Part 1/part 2 storey bungalow311 Queen Astrid Park31,807999 yearsNov 199912.5393A single storey bungalow in good conditionChia (DW5) further used No. 9 Queen Astrid Park for comparison. This property\n\nis/was a single-storey bungalow with a land area of 27,716 sq ft, of 999 years' tenure, which was\n\nsold at $9.5m in November 1999, at $343 per sq ft. He said No. 24 Leedon Road which he used was a\n\nparticularly good comparable because it was adjoining the Property and suffered from the same\n\nnegative characteristic (undulating land). Significantly, neither Seow nor Tang used No. 24 Leedon\n\nRoad as a comparable. Indeed in Seows case, no comparables were even stated in his valuation\n\nreport.19. After making the necessary adjustments to the comparables, Chia assessed the\n\nmarket value of the Property to be $13m or $349 per sq ft as at 4 December 1999. He testified that\n\nIRAS had taxed the Property at an annual value of $314 per sq ft or $11.7m showing that it accepted\n\n$11.7m as a fair market price for the Property. This was persuasive evidence that supported his own\n\nassessment of the market value of the Property. As for Cheng, he assessed the market value of the\n\nProperty to be $14m or $376 per sq ft as at 22 December 1999. He revealed that Vivian Kong of the\n\nbank had telephoned him on 6 April 2002 to ask for an update and he had told her the market value of\n\nthe Property had not changed since December 1999, it remained at $14m.20. The two experts testified the forced sale value of the Property was relevant\n\nto their valuations. They accepted the same definition of \"forced sale\" found in\n\nthe SISV Real Estate Glossary. \"Forced sale\" was defined as follows:open market value, with a proviso that the vendor has imposed a time limit for\n\n  completion of the sale which cannot be regarded as a reasonable period of time, taking into\n\n  account the nature of the asset, its location and the state of the market.They opined that the forced sale value is equally applicable when there is a sale\n\nunder duress or atypical circumstances. They classified mortgagees sales under this category and\n\ntreated such sales differently from owners sales. Hence, the forced sale value of the Property\n\nwas relevant. Cheng and Chia applied a discount of 10% to the market value to arrive at a forced\n\nsale value of $12.6m and $11.7m respectively for the Property.21. Both valuers also testified that it was unrealistic to expect to achieve the\n\nmarket value of the Property in mortgagee sales. This is because such properties are considered to\n\nhave bad fengshui by Chinese generally and hence attract offers lower than their market value. Cheng\n\ngave evidence that offers will also be lower because the buyer will be in a stronger bargaining\n\nposition vis--vis a mortgagees who are keen on disposing the property, particularly in a weak\n\nmarket. Chia testified that the price a property can fetch in a mortgagee sale is unpredictable but\n\ncited a research analysis report produced by SISV Services Pte. Ltd. This report stated that\n\napartments and condominiums transacted through mortgagee sales tended to fetch prices about 18% less\n\ncompared to similar properties sold through ordinary means and is evidence that mortgagee sale\n\nprices are normally lower than a propertys open market value.22. On Tai's allegation that the Property was not properly marketed and or the\n\nconduct of the sale was shoddily done, OUB relied on the testimonies of Sai Tok Guek @ Mary Sai (Sai)\n\nand Grace Ng Ling Beng (Ng). Sai (DW1) is a director of Knight Franks auctions department\n\nwith 12 years' experience as an auctioneer. She was in charge of the marketing and the auction of\n\nthe Property. Ng (DW2) is the head of the auctions department in Jones Lang Lasalle Property\n\nConsultants Pte. Ltd. ('Jones Lang'), with 13 years of experience as an auctioneer. Both witnesses\n\nhad conducted auctions for all sectors of the property market for clients who included other banks.23. Sai testified that she conducted both auctions of the Property. At the first\n\nauction, there were about 100 attendees while the second auction drew a response of about 150\n\npeople. She said this was the normal turnout for an auction. She asserted that Knight Frank took all\n\nreasonable steps to market the Property before the auctions; these included:-a. distributing details of the Property to Knight Franks customers (500-600)\n\n  by direct mailing; these included lawyers, bankers and developers and if any person wanted more\n\n  information, she would follow-up by sending the inquirer further details;b. placing 14 advertisements in toto in the English and Chinese dailies. The\n\n  advertisements ran for two (2) weeks prior to each auction. She testified that the sizes and\n\n  descriptions were well within the industry standard and produced copies of the advertisements she\n\n  had placed for the Property and those placed by other auction houses as comparisons. Five (5) more\n\n  advertisements were placed in the newspapers after the two auctions;c. affixing \"Auction\" and \"For Sale\" signs at\n\n  the Property;d. showing (with her assistant) ten (10) prospective buyers around the\n\n  Property.24. To rebut Tais allegations that the Property ought to have been sold by\n\ntender, Sai pointed out that selling the Property by auction was appropriate for a mortgagee sale.\n\nMortgagees would generally sell mortgaged properties by public auction first, because it is the most\n\ntransparent method. If the auction was unsuccessful, they would usually repeat the auction and then\n\nresort to other methods of sale such as private treaty or tender. In her experience, very few\n\nmortgagees would sell by tender without first trying the auction method.25. As for Ng, she testified that the steps taken by Knight Frank to market the\n\nProperty were more than reasonable. The fact that Knight Frank auctioned the Property during or\n\nclose to the school holidays was not conduct that could be criticised. This is because there is\n\nnever a perfect time to carry out an auction and in any case, it is common practice for potential\n\nbuyers to send representatives to auctions. Ng agreed with Sai that the number of attendees at each\n\nfor the two (2) auctions was normal. In addition, although some advertisements were placed during\n\nthe school holidays, Knight Frank placed advertisements throughout December 1999 up to April 2000;\n\nthus, the sale was sufficiently publicised. She agreed with Sai that an auction is the most\n\ntransparent and prudent way of conducting the sale since the Property was not so large as to warrant\n\na sale by tender.26. Chia Kook Vee (CKV), a vice-president of OUBs Credit Management\n\nDepartment, was the bank's representative who had the overall supervision of the sale of the\n\nProperty. He (DW3) testified that the plaintiff and his solicitors did write to OUB. However, he\n\ndisputed Tais claim that Tai informed OUB of the numerous firm offers for the sale of the\n\nProperty from August 1999 to November 1999. CKV pointed out that none of the letters referred toanyagreement for the sale of the Property oranyfirm offers which led to the signing of an\n\noption to purchase together with the payment of option monies.27. CKV testified that OUB took the usual steps taken to sell mortgaged\n\nproperties in this sale; the bank had not been criticised when it took such steps in previous\n\nmortgagee sales. The bank had appointed Edmund Tie and Savills to carry out valuations and Knight\n\nFrank to market and sell the Property, in December 1999, less than a month after it obtained\n\npossession. After appointing Knight Frank, OUB left the marketing and sale of the Property to Knight\n\nFrank's discretion as they are professionals and would know what to do. The bank attempted to\n\nauction the Property because it was/is the usual practice of the bank to sell re-possessed\n\nproperties by auction first.28. CKV testified that Sai informed him in mid-March 2000 that she received an\n\noffer for the Property at $10.9m. A few days later, he received another offer from a client of\n\nColliers, at $11.5m. He then informed Colliers that OUB would accept its offer unless Tai procures a\n\nbetter one or OUB received a better offer while waiting for Tais response. Tai was duly informed\n\nof both offers and was given two (2) weeks from 10 April 2000 to come up with a better offer but did\n\nnot. However, on 13 April 2000, Knight Frank managed to find a buyer who was willing to pay $11.7m.\n\nCKV then reverted to Colliers who matched the price and Prospect thereby secured the option to\n\npurchase on 16 May 2000. He testified he was unwilling to ask Knight Franks client to increase\n\ntheir price for fear of starting a private bidding war and losing both offers eventually.29. CKV also rebutted Tais allegation that OUB did not maintain the property\n\nbecause it did not have the keys to the Property and could not gain access to the Property when Tai\n\ncut off the power supply needed to operate the auto-gate. He said OUB had access to the Property at\n\nall material times (save for the first three (3) weeks of March 2000) and were thus able to maintain\n\nthe Property; Tai cut off the electricity supply only in March 2000. Since Tai did not supply OUB\n\nwith the manual control keys to the auto-gate but only the keys to the house, OUB had no access\n\nbecause it relied on the remote control to enter the Property. However, the loss of access was only\n\ntemporary and once OUB regained entry, Alexander Pool Specialist took additional steps to clean the\n\npool. He relied on the same letter dated 1 March 2000 from that company, as Tai did.30. OUB's contention was supported by Sai's testimony. Knight Frank conducted ten\n\n(10) inspections with prospective buyers, which would not have been possible if there was no access.\n\nSai also testified that the Property was properly maintained and she found it in a reasonably good\n\ncondition when she inspected the Property with prospective buyers. In addition, she had not received\n\nany complaints otherwise.31. To reinforce its case that OUB always had access to the Property other than\n\nfor about three (3) weeks in March 2000, OUB called Ong Chai Huk (Ong) to testify. Ong's\n\ncompany (Ong Hai Chwee Enterprises Pte Ltd) was engaged to change the locks of the Property on 3\n\nDecember 1999; he had also arranged for the auto-gate to be repaired on 21 February 2000. He had\n\nentered the Property in mid-February 2000 with a representative of OURS. It was only on 22 March\n\n2000 that the bank's Vivian Kong told Ong (DW4) that the Property was inaccessible because there was\n\nno electricity to operate the auto-gate. Ong was instructed to obtain the keys to the auto-gate so\n\nthat it could be opened manually. He said he climbed the auto-gate to retrieve the keys from the\n\ndistribution power box of the Property; he then handed the keys to OUB.32. As to Tais allegation that OUB should have rented out the Property, OUB\n\nargued that the obligation to rent only arises when there is a delay in the sale of mortgaged\n\nproperties. OUB submitted there was no such delay since the Property was put on sale about six (6)\n\nweeks after repossession, an offer was received within two (2) months of the first auction and the\n\nsale was completed two (2) months after the offer was received. OUB relied on Seows testimony\n\nthat the potential rent was only $20,000 per month while Tai was incurring interest at $125,000 per\n\nmonth on his loan, to show that it was reasonable for OUB to try to sell the Property instead of\n\nletting it out.",
        "Realising the true market value of the Property": "33. It was common ground that OUB had a duty to act in good faith and a duty to\n\ntake reasonable care to obtain the true market value at the date on which it decides to sell the\n\nProperty. This principle enunciated inCuckmere Brick Co Ltd v Mutual Finance Ltd[1971] 2 AER 633 is well established and has been applied in numerous local decisions (seeLee Nyet Khiong\n\nv Lee Nyet Yun Janet[1997] 2 SLR 713and more recently inSri Jaya (Sdn.) Bhd. v RHB Bank\n\nBhd.[2001] 1 SLR 486). However, the parties' dispute centred on the figure that represented the\n\ntrue market value of the Property.34. Tai claimed that the true market value of the Property could not be a price\n\nreflective of merely its forced sale value. He contended that the true market value must reflect the\n\naccurate and updated open market valuation of the Property. OUB on the other hand, argued that the\n\nProperty's true market value was its sale price of $11.7m since the same was achieved after a\n\ncompetent firm of estate agents had properly marketed the Property.35. OUB relied on the fact that all the expert witnesses on valuation agreed that\n\nvaluation was not an exact science and, that the best evidence of the market value of a property is\n\nthe actual sales price it obtained after the property is properly marketed. Valuations put forward\n\nby the various expert valuers are merely theoretical estimates. OUBs case was that such evidence\n\nby experts should be admissible against OUB only if it was at fault and caused the sales price not\n\nto be reflective of the true market value of the Property. For these propositions, OUB relied onThe\n\nBank of East Asia Ltd. v Tan Chin Mong Holdings[2001] 2 SLR 193, 205. In that case, Selvam J\n\nsaid at para 41 (p 205):..In any event, as a matter of principle,where the mortgagees are not in\n\n  breach of their duties in relation to their power of sale, their liability cannot be measured on\n\n  the basis of valuers opinions.Expert evidence on value should be admissible against the\n\n  mortgagees only in cases where they are at fault as inCuckmere Brick Co. v Mutual FinanceThe judge added at para 42 (p 206):.Given that, when a competent firm of estate agents and property valuers\n\n  market a property and conclude a sale, the price obtained by them isconclusiveof the\n\n  correct market price.36. Counsel for Tai tried to distinguishThe Bank of East Asia Ltd. v Tan Chin\n\nMong Holdings; she argued that the case involved a claim by a mortgagee against the guarantors\n\nof a mortgagor. The guarantors claimed that the mortgagee had breached its duty in the exercise of\n\nits power of sale over the mortgaged property. Hence, the case was distinguishable since the\n\nmortgagor there did not allege that the mortgagee bank breached its duty. Further, the mortgagee\n\nbank took adequate steps to sell the property. The bank had offered the mortgagor a reasonable\n\nopportunity to sell the property, appointed auctioneers to carry out three (3) auctions and took out\n\nsufficient advertisements. However, such steps were not taken in the present case and therefore the\n\nprinciples inThe Bank of East Asiacase were not applicable.37. I did not accept counsel's arguments. In both cases, the issue was whether\n\nthe mortgagee breached its duty when it exercised its power of sale. To determine this issue, the\n\ncourt inThe Bank of East Asiaheld that the evidence of valuers is not admissible unless the\n\nproperty had not been properly marketed in the first place. In the absence of proof of fault on OUBs\n\npart, the sale price of $11.7m would be/is conclusive of the true market value of the Property. The\n\nfurther point to be determined was whether OUB had taken proper steps to sell the Property.38. Similarly, Tai could not validly complain that OUB was in breach of its\n\nduties merely because the Property was sold at a forced sale price, if OUB proved that it took\n\nreasonable steps to sell the Property. OUB's counsel citedCitibank NA v Lee Hooi Lian & Anor[1999] 4 SLR 469as an example of a case where the court held that a mortgagee was not in breach\n\nwhen it sold the property at a price close to the forced sale valuation of the mortgaged property.\n\nTai however relied onOUB v Chua Kok Kay[1993] 1 SLR 686where the court found the bank\n\nliable for breach when it sold the property at a forced sale price. From both decisions, it was\n\nclear that the court was not merely concerned about whether the price achieved was reflective of its\n\nforced sale or open market valuation; the decisions turned on whether the price obtained by the\n\nmortgagee was the best price reasonably obtainable at the material time. InCitibank v Lee Hooi\n\nLian,the court found that the mortgagee had taken adequate steps by appointing Knight Frank to\n\nauction the property and when that was unsuccessful, selling it at a price closer to the forced sale\n\nvalue by private treaty, at the time when the property market was on a downward trend. However, inOUB\n\nv Chua Kok Kay, the court found that the bank acted unreasonably by selling the property at a\n\nforced sale value 17 monthsafterit had taken possession  the property could have been\n\nsold earlier when the mortgagee took possession without any detriment to the mortgagee. As such, the\n\nfact that OUB sold the Property at its forced sale valueper sedoes not mean that it had\n\nbreached its duties as mortgagees.39. The focus on whether reasonable steps have been taken to sell the Property\n\nrather than the valuations of experts or whether the true market value of the Property ought to be\n\nits open market valuation is also justifiable on policy grounds. In assessing whether a mortgagee is\n\nin breach, it is necessary that the facts be looked at broadly. The mortgagee will not be adjudged\n\nto be in breach unless he is \"plainly on the wrong side of the line\" (Cuckmere Brick\n\nCo. Ltd. v Mutual Finance Ltd.[1971] 2 All ER 633perLord Salmon at p 646). Since it is\n\nimpossible to determine precisely the value of a property sold in a mortgagee sale, it will be\n\nunfair to cast such a heavy burden on mortgagees to secure a price to meet such theoretical\n\nestimates. No mortgagee bank would be able to conduct mortgagee sales in confidence if such a burden\n\nis placed on them. In the interests of commerce, the mortgagees duty must simply be to secure the\n\nbest price reasonably obtainable at the material time regardless of the theoretical valuations of\n\nthe property in question.40. As Tai placed heavy emphasis on his argument that OUB relied on valuations\n\nwhich were too low and outdated and that the forced sale valuation was inapplicable in this\n\nmortgagee sale, I shall now address this issue.41. Tai relied on the testimonies of Seow and Tang to support his argument that\n\nit was unreasonable of OUB to rely on the low valuations the bank had obtained. Seow testified that\n\nthe open market valuation of the Property should be $15.8m. However, I found his evidence to be\n\ncompletely biased in favour of Tai. Seow was evasive and at times his testimony was misleading to\n\nsay the least. The following extract from his cross-examination (N/E114-115) clearly showed that he\n\nfailed to discharge his duty as an independent expert witness.Q. At the very start of my cross-examination, I asked if you were aware of any\n\n  negative features of a property, you agreed you would be obliged to draw the courts attention\n\n  to it?A. Yes.Q. But you now say property has many negative features. Yet none appeared on\n\n  your report?A. Yes.Q. So by your own admission you have failed to discharge your duty to this\n\n  court?A. Disagree.Q. I cant understand your answer. You didnt highlight any negative\n\n  features in your report?A. Yes.Q. But earlier you agree you should highlight any negative features to the\n\n  court?A. Yes I can tell it to you now.Q. So you are saying that you will only draw courts attention to it if you\n\n  are asked?A. Yes.Q. Do you honestly believe that that satisfies your obligation to this court as\n\n  an expert  you will only say when asked?A. If I say yes or no it will give the wrong impression\"Seow failed to mentionanynegative aspects of the Property in his report\n\nalthough he claimed that he knew they existed. When asked in re-examination (N/E 134) why these\n\nnegative features were omitted from his report, he gave the incredible answer that when he was\n\nworking out the value of the Property,ideas popped up but I may not have put them down.\n\nAlthough he recognised that a mortgagee sale may reasonably fetch 15% less than the propertys\n\ntheoretical market value, Seow failed to state so in his report but merely stated that the forced\n\nsale valuation was inappropriate and, only the open market valuation was applicable in mortgagee\n\nsales.42. I agreed with counsel for OUB, despite Seow's denial (N/E 127), that Seow's\n\nreport was tailored to support Tai's case. I myself had chided Seow at one stage (N/E 145) for\n\ndescribing the land in his report (at p 6) as'land slightly below the level of Leedon Road'when he well-knew that the land was 'undulating' which description (I told him) has a different\n\nmeaning from'slightly below road level'. Another instance of Seow's subjective views was his\n\nadmission under cross-examination that the Property suffered from bad geomancy by being located at a\n\nT-junction, which negative feature was totally omitted from his report. In re-examination (N/E136)\n\nSeow attempted to justify his omission with a nonsensical explanation that in ancient China, Chinese\n\ndid not like T-junctions as the cart may, in the darkness, bump into a house if it is at T-junction.\n\nNowadays he said, the only problem is, lights from a car may shine onto the house at night and to\n\nmitigate such disadvantage, one can build a wall.43. Yet another instance where Seow's evidence was misleading was his attempt to\n\nsay that a comparable (No. 25 Ford Avenue) used by Tang (see exhibitP2) also suffered from\n\nthe same disadvantage of being sited at a T-junction; I pointed out to him his statement was\n\nincorrect as that property was situated in a cul de sac (N/E 138), according to the latest street\n\ndirectory available. His feeble explanation was, he had visited the site andthoughtit was\n\nlocated at a T-junction. In the light of the instances highlighted above, I was of the view that\n\nSeow was not credible as an expert witness. Accordingly, I rejected his testimony.44. I turn next to Tai's other expert witness Tang. He came across as nervous and\n\nsometimes answered question with some hesitation. Because of the controversy surrounding the extent\n\nof loss of privacy the Property suffered from Jade Mansion, I myself visited the site and informed\n\nTang of my findings the following day (N/E 248). He then agreed with my observation that Jade\n\nMansion (which is situated at No. 10 Leedon Road) overlooks the Property, even though a tennis court\n\nformed a buffer between the two (2) properties. Previously, Tang had argued (N/E 242-243) that the\n\nProperty suffered less loss of privacy from Jade Mansion (which ground level he visited) than No. 12\n\nQueen Astrid Park which he had used as a comparable (seeP1). Although he had not visited the\n\nupper floors of Jade Mansion, Tang nonetheless maintained only the upper floors could look into the\n\ngrounds of the Property. He opined that a pedestrian walkway behind No. 12 Queen Astrid Park was\n\nmore obtrusive because anyone walking there (would-be robbers included) could intrude into the\n\nprivacy of that house. It was only when counsel for the bank showed him photographs which Tai\n\nhimself had taken (see p 67 of Tai's affidavit of evidence-in- chief), that Tang agreed that not\n\nonly the top butall,floors of Jade Mansion could look onto the Property. Tang had (at para\n\n5.0 of his report) described the Property as being locatednearinstead ofat, the\n\njunction with Ford Avenue. Although he accepted (N/E206) that geomancy was a factor which the market\n\ntakes into account, Tang said he himself did not believe in it because he is a Christian. Tang's\n\nexplanation of his own personal beliefs did not detract from the fact that he was duty-bound to take\n\ninto account geomancy which the market did, however irrational or illogical and even if it is not a\n\nrecognised valuation principle.45. I had also visited No. 24 Ford Avenue at the same time that I visited the\n\nProperty. This property located at a cul de sac was also used by Tang as a comparable (seeP1).\n\nQuestioned by the court on whether he agreed that it had a better location than the Property, Tang\n\n(N/E 250) said it was more 'crowded'; I did not accept his comment, pointing out that it\n\ncannot be right as the property (like the Property) was situated in a good class bungalow area,\n\nwhich means the land area must be at least 1,400 sq m or 15,000 sq ft.46. I have referred to extracts of Tang's testimony to show that he was not an\n\nobjective witness, although less blatantly biased in favour of Tai than Seow  he was at least\n\nwilling to make concessions when confronted with evidence which contradicted his testimony, unlike\n\nSeow. Consequently, I was wary of accepting Tang's testimony and valuation, without reservations. I\n\nwas certainly not convinced that a house like No. 12 Queen Astrid Park could suffer the same lack of\n\nprivacy from occasional passers-by on an adjacent walk-way as the Property did, from a towering and\n\ndensely populated block of flats like Jade Mansion.47. I preferred the testimonies of OUBs experts, Chia and Cheng, that the\n\ntheoretical market value of the Property at the material time was $13.5m and $14m respectively. As\n\nit was not put to these witnesses that their valuations were unreasonable, according to the rule inBrown\n\nv Dunn(1894) 6 R 67, Tai was deemed not to have challenged their evidence. In any case, both\n\nwitnesses withstood cross-examination admirably on how they arrived at their valuations. Indeed, I\n\nfound Chia to be a remarkably candid witness who unhesitatingly informed the court that of the four\n\n(4) valuations put before the court, his valuation of $13.5m was theleast wrong(N/E\n\n413-414).48. Tais own expert witness, Tang had valued the open market value of the\n\nProperty at $14.525m. However, even Tang agreed that Chengs valuation was reasonable and Chias\n\nvaluation may also be reasonable subject to the qualification that he made the right assumptions.\n\nTang also affirmed that the methodology used by Chia and Cheng was correct and that they had used\n\nreasonable comparables. He also agreed that Chia and Cheng were correct to apply 10% discount to the\n\ntheoretical market value of the Property to obtain its forced sale value. Consequently, Tangs\n\ntestimony did little to advance Tai's case that OUB relied on inaccurate valuations.49. The crux of the dispute between Tang and OUBs experts centred on whether\n\nthe forced sale valuation was relevant. Tang contended that it wasnotbecause OUB had ample\n\ntime to market the Property. To him, the fundamental characteristic of a \"forced sale\" is\n\none which had a short marketing period. Tang refused to recognise that mortgagee sales and owner\n\nsales are different in nature and contended that in both instances, with sufficient time to market a\n\nproperty, the sale price achieved should be its theoretical market value. On the other hand, Chia\n\nand Cheng testified that while the period available for marketing was a relevant consideration in\n\ndetermining whether a sale was a \"forced sale\", mortgagee sales are typically considered\n\nforced sale situations. This is because forced sales occur when there is a sale under atypical\n\ncircumstances or distress and mortgagee sales fit that description.50. Having given due consideration to the evidence of Tang, Chia and Cheng, I\n\nconcluded that it was not unreasonable for OUB to rely on the forced sale valuation as an estimate\n\nof what the Property may fetch. I accepted the testimonies of Chia and Cheng that while time is a\n\npre-dominant factor in determining if a sale is a \"forced sale\", it is not the sole\n\ncriterion. A mortgagee sale is different from a sale by an owner who has the luxury of taking as\n\nlong as was needed to sell a property at a price acceptable to himself. A mortgagee is not obliged\n\nto wait indefinitely for the theoretical market value of the property to be obtainable before he can\n\nsell the property. He is not a trustee of the mortgagor when he exercises his power of sale. He can\n\npursue his own benefit, i.e. to realise his security, in choosing the time of sale and his duty is\n\nmerely to obtain the best reasonable price at the time he chooses to sell (Good Property Land\n\nDevelopment Pte. Ltd. v Societe Generale[1989] 2 MLJ 17). In addition, I accepted the common\n\ntestimony of Chia and Cheng that properties sold as mortgagee sales tend to fetch prices lower than\n\ntheir theoretical market value. These properties are associated with bad \"fengshui\" and in\n\na mortgagee sale conducted in a weak market, buyers are in a stronger bargaining position. Hence, I\n\ncould not agree with Tang that forced sale valuations are irrelevant and that OUB should have relied\n\non open market valuations as the only indication of the true market value of a mortgaged property.51. In conclusion, I found that there was no merit in Tais argument that the\n\nvaluations that OUB relied on were inaccurate. There was also no evidence that the valuations were\n\noutdated (by more than six [6] months). Therefore, the forced sale valuations which OUB relied on as\n\nan estimate of the price of the Property were reasonable, taking into account the definition of and\n\nthat it was, a mortgagee sale.",
        "Efforts to sell the Property": "52. Tai complained that OUB breached its duty when exercising the power of sale\n\nover the Property because neither the bank nor its agents made reasonable efforts to sell the\n\nProperty at its true market value; he contended:-(a) that OUB did not maintain the Property properly or conduct inspections of\n\n  the Property with potential buyers;(b) the advertisements placed by Knight Frank were inadequate;(c) the Property should have been sold by tender or by private treaty with\n\n  potential buyers identified by Tai instead of by auction;(d) OUB did not put the potential buyers in competition with one another.53. As a preliminary point, Tai had argued that OUB should be liable for its own\n\nas well as its agents negligence in the conduct of the sale, even if it hired professionals to\n\nconduct the sale. His counsel citedTomlin v Luce(1889) 43 Ch 191 which decided that\n\nmortgagees are not absolved from their duties and liability for negligence merely because they have\n\nhired competent professionals to carry out the sale. OUB on the other hand relied onSri Jaya v\n\nRHB Bank.In that case, the court found that RHB Bank failed to take reasonable\n\nprecautions to obtain the true market value because it did not publicise the sale sufficiently.\n\nJustice Rajendran held at para 51 (at p 500):In this case, all that RHB Bank had done to publicise the property was to ask\n\n  RHB Banks branches to spread the word around that the property was for sale. While I accepted\n\n  Ongs explanation that he did not want to advertise the property as that might alert the\n\n  occupants, there were other ways Ong could have publicised the property for sale. He could for\n\n  instance, have entrusted the sale to firms such as Richard Ellis, Knight Frank and Jones Lang and\n\n  with their experience and knowledge of likely buyers of such a property, those firms could have\n\n  undertaken the task without public advertising..OUB contended that the case stood for the proposition that it would be sufficient\n\nfor a mortgagee bank to engage professionals to conclude a mortgagee sale. In my view,Sri Jaya v\n\nRHB Bankmerely commented that reputable firms such as Knight Frank could be entrusted with\n\nmortgagee sales because of their experience and knowledge. However, the case did not go so far as to\n\nhold that entrusting such firms with the sale was sufficient to absolve a mortgagee of his duties.\n\nThe principle inTomlin v Luceis still applicable and OUB would be liable for any negligence\n\non the part of its agents even if it had hired a competent firm of auctioneers.54.Now forTai's complaint that the Property was not properly\n\nmaintained; he had testified he had expended as much as $6,000 per month on maintenance when he\n\noccupied the Property. This issue was purely factual namely, whether OUB and its agents did have\n\naccess to the Property for purposes of its upkeep. Tai did not have access to the Property and did\n\nnot produce any evidence on the state of the Propertyafterhe delivered-up vacant possession\n\non 19 November 1999. His case was based solely on the assumption that OUB could not have had access\n\nto the Property since it took possession.55. Tai said he had terminated the power supply sometime in December 1999 and OUB\n\nonly wrote to him in March 2000 to complain that its agents could not enter the Property because\n\nthere was no power to operate the auto-gate. From this, he inferred that OUB could not have entered\n\nthe Property from December 1999 up to March 2000 when the problem was rectified. However, he\n\nprovided no evidence that the lack of electricity prevented access .56. On the other hand, OUB could prove that Knight Frank had entered the Property\n\non various dates from December to February. Sai produced a photograph she had taken of the half\n\nopened auto-gate on 30 December 1999. She also testified that she and her assistant conducted\n\ninspections of the Property throughout the relevant period. Her evidence was not challenged under\n\ncross-examination.57. In addition, Ong had testified that he entered the Property in mid-February\n\n2000 which evidence was similarly unchallenged. Ong arranged for the gate to be repaired in late\n\nFebruary 2000 and reported it to be in \"good working condition\". He had handed the keys\n\nfor opening the auto-gate manually, to the bank in March 2000. Further, Alexander Pool Specialist\n\ninvoiced OUB monthly from December 1999 to February 2000 for maintaining the pool. In its letter to\n\nOUB dated 1 March 2000, the firm mentioned that it did not maintain the pool when there was no\n\naccess in mid-February. However, the letter also mentioned that the company took extra steps\n\nthereafter to clean the pool when access was finally restored.58. After assessing all the evidence, I had concluded that OUB did have access to\n\nthe Property for the greater part of the period from November 1999 to May 2000. It did not have\n\naccess for some three (3) weeks in March 2000. However, the temporary loss of access did not\n\nmaterially affect the maintenance of the Property. Maintenance works were carried out for the larger\n\npart of the material period. I had no reason to disbelieve Sai's testimony that Knight Frank did\n\nhave access to the Property from December 1999 until it discovered the problem with the auto-gate on\n\n3 March 2000. I also accepted her evidence that the Property was in a presentable condition.59. Tais second complaint was that the sale of the Property was not adequately\n\nadvertised. He exhibited several advertisements for sale of good class bungalows that were larger\n\nthan those placed by Knight Frank. His witness, Tan, testified that the advertisements which Knight\n\nFrank placed were too small, appeared too infrequently and lacked detailed descriptions to attract\n\nthe attention of potential buyers of good class bungalows.60. Tans testimony was weak; indeed his qualifications as an expert witness\n\nwere called into question. There was no evidence as to his qualifications in the field of marketing.\n\nAlthough he has been a real estate agent for 20 years, he admitted in cross-examination that he did\n\nnot have any experience with the marketing of properties to be sold by auction or in advising banks\n\non mortgagee sales. Indeed, he prepared his affidavit in a rush for the purposes of highlighting\n\nwhat OUB did wrong. He failed to clarify the facts surrounding the marketing efforts of Knight Frank\n\nand was content to rely on a letter written by OUBs solicitors dated 21 March 2001 as the sole\n\nbasis for what he thought were the facts. He did not produce examples of his own advertisements for\n\nthe purposes of comparison giving the excuse that they were irrelevant because he was not marketing\n\nthe Property. During cross-examination (NE 153 and 168), he even admitted that he failed to take\n\ninto account relevant facts given to him because he was careless in the preparation of his\n\naffidavit.Q. You said you didnt know about Knight Franks direct mailing until after\n\n  you affirmed your affidavit?A. Yes.Q. Thats why you didnt refer to it in your EiC?A. Yes.Q. That is incorrect? See 1AB334 Drew & Napiers letter which you said\n\n  you relied on. See last sentence in para 2. You were told here?A. Yes my mistake, my apologies.Q. You said 1AB334 was all you had and yet you missed out a material portion?A. My mistake.Q. So you were careless in preparing your EiC?A. Yes.In the circumstances, I was of the view it was unsafe to rely on Tans\n\ntestimony and I did not.61. Ng on the other hand was a reliable witness. OUB had conceded that the\n\nadvertisements placed by Knight Frank were less prominent than those Tai had exhibited. However,\n\nboth Sai and Ng testified that the advertisements placed by Knight Frank were in line with the\n\nindustry norm for sale by auction of mortgaged good class bungalows, in terms of size and\n\ndescription. The advertisements Tai exhibited were generally used in tenders or for owners sales.\n\nSuch testimony was not challenged during cross-examination. Further it was Sais testimony that\n\nadvertisements for tender sales are typically larger than those used for auction sales and that\n\nadvertisements for owner sales could be larger because the size depended on the owners\n\npreferences.62. Further, Sai and Ng testified that the frequency of the advertisements was\n\nalso within industry standards. Tai complained that some of the advertisements were placed during\n\nschool holidays when buying interest was low. However, I found that this was not a valid complaint.\n\nNg and Sai gave evidence that advertisements are usually placed several weeks before an auction and\n\ntheir evidence in this respect was also unchallenged. It is also trite law that a mortgagee may\n\nchoose the timing of the auction (Lee Nyet Khiong v Lee Nyet Yun Janet). OUB and Knight Frank\n\nwere entitled to hold the auctions in January and March 2000. Consequently, Knight Frank was equally\n\nentitled to place advertisements in December 1999 and March 2000, several weeks before the auctions.\n\nIn any case I accepted that Knight Franks advertisements were within the industry norms in terms\n\nof size and description, and sufficient to publicise the auctions/sale of the Property.63. At this juncture, I wish to refer to the appellate court's decision inLee\n\nNyet Khiong v Lee Nyet Yun Janet. Tai relied on this case to argue that the advertisements that\n\nKnight Frank placed were inadequate and that OUB should therefore be held to be in breach. There,\n\nthe court found the mortgagee liable because he placed only one (1) advertisement for a sale by\n\ntender, two (2) weeks before the close of the tender. In addition, the advertisement did not contain\n\nany particulars of the property and stated merely its land area, location and tenure. Clearly, that\n\ncase is distinguishable from ours. The advertisement inLee Nyet Khiongs case was also for\n\na tender, not an auction sale. According to Sai and Ng, advertisements for tender sales are\n\ntypically more prominent as compared to those for auctions.64. Lastly, Tai did not provide any evidence as to how the bank's or Knight Franks\n\n\"poor\" marketing efforts affected the sale of the Property. On the other hand, Sai had\n\ntestified which I accepted, that she received many inquiries about the Property and the attendance\n\nat both auctions were in the normal range. Further, the eventual purchaser of the Property was not\n\neven a client of Knight Frank but had heard of the sale from other sources. In the light of these\n\nfindings, I was of the view that the marketing of the Property was properly done.65. Tais third contention was that OUB breached its duties by adopting an\n\ninappropriate method of sale, i.e. conducting two (2) auctions and selling the property by private\n\ntreaty when the auctions failed. He contended that the Property should have been sold by tender.\n\nHowever, both experts, Sai and Ng, testified that most mortgagees would try to sale a mortgaged\n\nproperty by auction first. They would resort to other methods such as tender or private treaty sales\n\nonly after auctions were unsuccessful, the reason being that an auction is the most open and\n\ncost-effective method of conducting a sale for properties of the size of the subject property.\n\nCounsel for Tai did not seriously challenge their testimonies. None of Tais witnesses testified\n\nthat OUBs attempts to sell by auction, instead of by tender was \"plainly on the wrong side\n\nof the line\". In the circumstances, this allegation was without merit.66. In the alternative, Tai argued that OUB ought to have pursued the potential\n\nbuyers he had advised them through his solicitors letter dated 15 September 1999 (see\n\n1AB100-102). He relied on the Court of Appeals decision inHow Seen Ghee v DBS[1994] 1 SLR 526for the proposition, that an auction is not always the best way of securing a good price\n\nand, that a mortgagee should in general allow a mortgagor a reasonable opportunity to market his\n\nproperty by a private treaty sale. He contended that OUB breached this duty because it did not offer\n\nhim a reasonable opportunity to market his Property or pursue offers by potential buyers he had\n\nidentified.67. However, Tais case was not borne out by the evidence. OUBs\n\nvice-president CKV, admitted that he did receive the letter dated 15 September 1999 from Tai's\n\nsolicitors giving a status quo on persons who offered to buy the Property, their offers and the\n\nreasons forthe failure of the negotiations in each case. He pointed out that he never\n\nreceivedanyinformation about Tai reachinganyagreement with any of the purported\n\npurchasers. Moreover, none of the offerors actually paid any option monies and no lawyers were ever\n\ninstructed on the conveyancing of the Property. The only witness who testified that he made some\n\noffer in relation to the Property was King. However, his testimony did not help Tai in any way since\n\nit was revealed during his cross-examination that his offer of US $11m was not for the Property but\n\nfor Tais business and the Property was only to be used as collateral for the deal.68. In any case, Tai had ample opportunities to market the Property himself.\n\nUnder a judgment obtained by OUB on 6 August 1999 (in the Originating Summons), he was supposed to\n\ndeliver the Property up on 20 August 1999 but he failed to do so. He finally relinquished possession\n\nonly on 19 November 1999 after disobeying three separate Orders of Court. He had an extended grace\n\nperiod in which to find buyers for the Property and show it in its best light but none materialised.\n\nOUB had also made it clear by its solicitor's letter dated 31 August 1999 that Tai was at liberty to\n\nask any interested parties to liase directly with OUB. However, according to CKV, no one approached\n\nOUB with any offer. Tai claimed that he did not refer interested parties to OUB out of pride and\n\nbecause of a fear of committal proceedings. Even if those reasons were true which I doubted, OUB\n\ncannot be faulted for not offering Tai an opportunity to refer buyers to it or unreasonably\n\nrejecting offers presented by Tai; he had admitted that he had not referred any interested purchaser\n\nto the bank.69. Finally, Tai alleged that OUB ought to have placed potential buyers of the\n\nProperty, i.e. the clients of Colliers and Knight Frank, in competition with each other. His counsel\n\nrelied onSri Jaya v RHB BankandLee Nyet Khiongv Lee Nyet Yun Janetfor the\n\nproposition that a mortgagee must put potential buyers in competition with each other to get the\n\ntrue market value of a property. Those cases are distinguishable from the present case and are\n\ninapplicable. In both cases, the courts found the mortgagee liable because he accepted a lower offer\n\nalthough there was a higher offer available. In both cases, no reasons were offered as to why\n\npotential buyers were not put in competition with each other to secure the best value for the\n\nproperty and the courts held that the mortgagee ought to have allowed such competition amongst\n\npotential buyers. Here, the offer by Colliers client of $11.7m which OUB accepted was the highest\n\navailable offer at that time. More importantly, OUB had a good reason not to put Colliers and\n\nKnight Franks clients in competition. CKV was afraid that starting a private bidding war amongst\n\nthe two (2) buyers would result in both parties withdrawing their bids. Ng and Sai had agreed that\n\nthere was a serious risk that OUB would have lost both buyers if it had initiated a private bidding\n\nwar. OUB was not \"plainly on the wrong side of the line\" when it refused to ask Knight\n\nFranks client to increase his bid.70. In conclusion, none of Tais complaints as to the marketing of the Property\n\nor the conduct of the sale were valid. OUB took all reasonable steps to obtain the true market value\n\nwhen it sold the Property.",
        "Obligation to rent": "71. Tai argued that OUB was obliged to rent the Property since it was in a\n\nhabitable condition and the onus was on OUB to show that it took steps to do so. His counsel relied\n\nonMotorcycle Industries (1973) Pte. Ltd. v Indian Overseas Bank[1992] 2 SLR 453for these\n\npropositions. He also submitted that OUB failed to discharge its duty since it left the Property\n\nempty for ten (10) months.72. With respect, Tais counsel had misread the decision inMotorcycle\n\nIndustries. The case does not stand for the proposition that a mortgagee must take steps to rent\n\na mortgaged property if it was in a habitable condition. Although Selvam JC (as he then was) held\n\nthat a mortgagee in possession is bound to be diligent in collecting the rents, he qualified this\n\nproposition in his judgment to say, where the sale of the mortgaged property is contemplated within\n\nareasonable time, a mortgagee may enter into possession without being liable to account for\n\nany notional rent. The burden was not on OUB to show that it had taken steps to rent out the place.73. However, OUB had to prove that it sold the Property without undue delay so\n\nthat it would not be liable to account for notional rent. OUB had shown that it sold the Property\n\nwith reasonable promptitude. It took six (6) weeks after the Property was re-possessed to prepare\n\nfor the first auction by: (i) obtaining valuations, (ii) appointing the auctioneers and (iii)\n\ncarrying out marketing efforts. A further two (2) months lapsed after the first auction before an\n\noffer was secured followed by another two (2) months to complete the sale. In view of the lack of\n\ninterest for the Property, it cannot be said that OUB took an unreasonably long time to secure and\n\nto complete the sale to Prospect.74. The facts ofMotorcycle Industriesare easily distinguishable in any\n\ncase. There, the property was left vacant for more than ten (10) years. Further, the mortgagee did\n\nnot offer any reason to explain why it had left the property vacant. On the other hand, it is clear\n\nthat if OUB were to rent out the Property in this instance, its chances of selling the Property may\n\nhave decreased. A tenanted property of this nature is less attractive to certain types of buyers\n\nsuch as developers and owner-occupiers. In any case, the interest on Tais loan was accumulating\n\nat $125,000 per month. It was clearly to his benefit that the Property be disposed off earlier and\n\nquickly because the expected rent of $20,000 per month or $240,000 per year would not have covered\n\nthe interest element. OUB was not obliged to account for notional rent.",
        "Conclusion": "75. It was clear on the evidence that none of the allegations pleaded in the\n\nStatement of Claim had been made out. Consequently, I dismissed Tais claim with costs to OUB.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
