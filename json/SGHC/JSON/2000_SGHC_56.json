        "Background": "3. In December 1996, the plaintiffs were\n\nthe lessees under a 30-year lease of the whole of private lot A7312 comprising part of\n\nGovernment Resurvey Lot 1785 of Mukim 6 Peng Kang (‘the property’). They had\n\nerected a theme park known as Tang Dynasty Village on the property and their main business\n\nwas that of operating the theme park.4. The defendant was then the managing\n\ndirector of a Singapore company called Admiralty Leisure Pte Ltd (‘ALPL’) that\n\nwished to purchase the lease of the property and take over the theme park together with\n\nits fittings and equipment. On 7 December 1996, a purchase and sale agreement to this\n\neffect was entered into between the plaintiffs as vendors and ALPL as purchasers. The sale\n\nwas made conditional on certain ‘Necessary Approvals’ being obtained by 7 April\n\n1997. Amongst these approvals was the consent of the lessor of the property, Singapore\n\nLeisure Industries Pte Ltd, to the sale of the lease to ALPL. If any of the Necessary\n\nApprovals was not obtained within the requisite period, the sale and purchase would not be\n\nproceeded with.5. Clause 3.1.1 of the sale agreement\n\nobliged the plaintiffs to apply to the lessor for consent to sell the property to ALPL\n\nwithin seven days of the date of the agreement. The plaintiffs duly made the application\n\nbut the lessor took some time to respond. By mid March 1997, it was clear that the\n\nlessor’s approval was unlikely to be obtained by the specified date of 7 April 1997.\n\nIt was the only one of the Necessary Approvals that was still outstanding. The defendant\n\nthen requested the plaintiffs to grant an extension of time of four months (ie up 7 August\n\n1997) for the lessor to consent to the sale of the property to ALPL.6. The plaintiffs agreed to the\n\ndefendant’s proposal subject to his entering into an undertaking and indemnity with\n\nthem. This document was signed by the defendant on 24 March 1997. By it the defendant\n\nagreed and undertook that in the event all Necessary Approvals were obtained on or before\n\n7 August 1997 and ALPL thereafter refused or neglected to pay the sum of $7,050,000 being\n\nthe 15% of the sale price due under cl 5 of the sale agreement and/or the sum of\n\n$2,700,000 being a payment due to the plaintiffs under cl 4.1.2 of a supplemental\n\nagreement dated 7 December 1996, he would pay the plaintiffs the said sums and indemnify\n\nthem against all loss and damage suffered by them as a result of ALPL’s failure to\n\npay the same.7. By a letter dated 11 July 1997, the\n\nlessor informed the plaintiffs’ solicitors that it had ‘no objection in\n\nprinciple’ to the plaintiffs’ assigning the property to ALPL as the\n\nassignee/lessee subject to various terms and conditions. One of these was that the\n\nassignment had to be completed on or before the expiry of three months from the date of\n\nthe lessor’s letter. The letter also required the plaintiffs and ALPL to accept the\n\noffer from the lessor by submitting various specified documents to it by 7 August 1997.8. The parties had some difficulty with\n\nthe condition requiring completion within three months of the lessor’s letter as the\n\nsale agreement provided 75% of the purchase price to be paid by 12 instalments the last of\n\nwhich was scheduled for 7 September 1998. Only upon full payment would the lease be\n\nassigned to ALPL. Both parties wrote to the lessor asking it to modify this condition. The\n\nlessor refused to modify its condition about the assignment, however, although it did\n\nagree to enter into a fresh building agreement with ALPL. In the event the assignment was\n\ncompleted within the time period specified by the lessor.9. Pursuant to cl 5 of the sale agreement\n\nand cl 1.2 of the supplemental agreement, ALPL was to pay the sums of $7,050,000 and\n\n$2,700,000 to the plaintiffs after the Necessary Approvals had been obtained. ALPL did\n\nnot, however, make payment of the full amount to the plaintiffs after 7 August 1997.\n\nInstead, ALPL paid the plaintiffs only $6,500,000 on 21 September 1997. As a result, there\n\nwas a balance due to the plaintiffs of $3,250,000. This was the amount that the plaintiffs\n\nproceeded to claim from the defendant under his undertaking.Submissions and decision10. The defendant’s main argument\n\nbefore me was that the Necessary Approvals were not obtained before 7 August 1997 because\n\nthe lessor’s letter of 11 July was a conditional approval and that approval did not\n\nbecome a ‘Necessary Approval’ until all the terms and conditions in the letter\n\nhad been fulfilled. There was one condition in the letter that was not fulfilled by either\n\nthe plaintiffs or ALPL before 7 August 1997 and therefore the terms of the sale agreement\n\nhad not been complied with within the extended period. Basically, the submission was that\n\nthe ‘Necessary Approval’ specified in the sale agreement had, in relation to the\n\nlessor, to be an unconditional approval.11. I was not able to accept the\n\ndefendant’s submission. The lessor, when requested by the plaintiffs for consent to\n\nthe intended sale and purchase of the property, had three possible courses of action. It\n\ncould reject the request, it could consent to the transaction without conditions or,\n\nthirdly, it could agree to the transaction with conditions. The defendant was aware of\n\nthis and he conceded in his first affidavit that the lessor had the right to impose\n\nconditions on its consent. That this was a likely outcome of an application for consent\n\nwas recognised in the sale agreement itself since it contained provisions specifying how\n\ncertain conditions if imposed by the lessor would be treated.12. As the plaintiffs submitted what the\n\ndefendant was trying to do was to say that it was agreed that any conditions that might be\n\nattached to the lessor’s approval had to be accepted by the parties by the deadline\n\nof 7 August 1997, otherwise the lessor’s consent was a conditional one which could\n\nnot constitute a ‘Necessary Approval’. I agreed with the plaintiffs’\n\nsubmission that the defendant was confusing the lessor’s consent which alone was a\n\nNecessary Approval with the parties’ acceptance of the conditions attached to the\n\nconsent. The date of acceptance of the lessor’s conditions had nothing to do with the\n\ndate when the lessor issued consent. That date was 11 July 1997 and was well within the\n\nperiod specified for receipt of the approvals.13. Further, even if the defendant was\n\ncorrect to say that the lessor’s conditions had to be accepted on or before 7 August\n\n1997, the evidence was that such acceptance did take place by that deadline. When the\n\nlessor made it clear to both parties that the conditions in the 11 July letter remained\n\nunaltered, the parties accepted this position. Both sent letters to the lessor on 7 August\n\n1997 agreeing to accept the lessor’s conditions. The plaintiffs’ letter was\n\nwritten by themselves whilst ALPL’s solicitors wrote on their clients’ behalf.14. At the time the parties were clear\n\nthat the lessor’s letter of 11 July 1997 qualified as the lessor’s approval of\n\nthe sale. This is shown in the way that ALPL treated the stakeholding money. Under cl 4.1\n\nof the sale agreement, ALPL had to pay by way of deposit a sum of $4.7 million of which\n\n$500,000 was to be paid directly to the plaintiffs while the balance of $4.2 million was\n\nto be held by the plaintiffs’ solicitors as stakeholders until all the Necessary\n\nApprovals had been obtained whereupon the plaintiffs’ solicitors were entitled to\n\nrelease the said balance to the plaintiffs without reference to ALPL.15. On the same day that the lessor sent\n\nits letter of consent to the sale and purchase of the property, ALPL’s solicitors\n\nwrote to the plaintiffs’ solicitors to inform the latter that ALPL’s\n\ninstructions were that the balance of the ten percent deposit could be released to the\n\nplaintiffs. In one sense this was an unnecessary letter in that once the Necessary\n\nApprovals were in hand no authority was needed from ALPL for the release of the funds. In\n\nanother sense, however, it was useful as it showed that ALPL took the view that with the\n\nreceipt of the lessor’s letter of 11 July all the Necessary Approvals had been\n\nobtained.16. Further, the plaintiffs’\n\nsolicitors wrote to ALPL solicitors on 12 July 1997 enclosing a copy of the letter of\n\napproval from the lessor and stating that since all the Necessary Approvals had then been\n\nobtained, the sale and purchase was final and no longer subject to conditions precedent to\n\nbe fulfilled. Neither ALPL nor their managing director objected to the statement at that\n\ntime or within a reasonable time thereafter. The first time any allegation was made that\n\nthe letter of 11 July 1997 did not constitute the lessor’s consent to the sale was in\n\nthe defendant’s affidavit resisting the order 14 application.17. As a matter of construction, I could\n\nnot accept that the lessor’s letter of 11 July 1997 did not constitute the\n\nlessor’s consent to the sale and purchase as required by the sale and purchase\n\nagreement. The document did not require that consent to take any particular form. What was\n\nnecessary was simply an indication that the transaction had the lessor’s approval and\n\nthat the lessor would co-operate to allow it to be completed. Further, it was always\n\nenvisaged that conditions might attach to such consent and the parties, had they wanted to\n\nrule out an unconditional consent, could easily have inserted wording to that effect. They\n\ndid not do so. The letter of 11 July indicated that the lessor was approving the\n\ntransaction subject to certain terms that were not unusual or impossible of compliance. In\n\nthe circumstances, I was satisfied that it was a genuine approval and thus qualified as a\n\nconsent on the part of the lessor to the sale of the property to ALPL and therefore meant\n\nthat the first Necessary Approval under the sale and purchase agreement had been obtained.18. I therefore dismissed the appeal.JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGESINGAPORECopyright © Government of Singapore."
