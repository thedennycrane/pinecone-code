        "Background": "",
        "The present charges": "3 The accused, Sukla Lalatendu (“the Accused”), was a 42-year-old Indian national and a Singapore Permanent Resident at the time of the offences. He was also the owner of a car insurance company. He faced a total of three charges, all of which were for the offence of theft in dwelling under s 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) which provides as follows: Theft in dwelling-house, etc. 380.Whoever commits theft in any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling, or for the custody of property, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine. 4 Two of the three charges were proceeded with, and the Accused was convicted on the Statement of Facts, the relevant extracts of which may be summarised as follows: (a)First charge: On 27 April 2017, the Accused committed theft in dwelling of a “Logitech Spotlight Presentation Remote” valued at $169.00 from a Popular bookstore at United Square Shopping Mall (“United Square”). The bookstore’s surveillance footage showed the Accused behaving suspiciously at the location where the remotes were kept. Subsequent investigations revealed that at or about 6.13pm that day, the Accused dishonestly took a remote which was displayed on a shelf in the bookstore and placed it in a plastic bag that he was carrying. He then left the bookstore with the remote without paying for it. United Square is a building used for the custody of property, and the stolen remote was taken out of the possession of the bookstore manager. There was no mention in the Statement of Facts of whether the stolen remote was subsequently recovered. (b)Second charge: On 1 May 2017, the Accused committed theft in dwelling of a “Samsung Gear 360 Globe handheld camera” valued at $348.00 from a Samsung Experience Store at No 3 Gateway Drive Westgate (“Westgate”). The store’s surveillance footage showed that at or about 7.40pm that day, the Accused had taken the camera and left the store without making payment for it. Subsequent investigations revealed that the Accused had gone to Westgate at about 7.15pm that day. He entered the Samsung Experience Store and noticed the camera which was left unlocked on one of the shelves. The Accused then decided to steal the camera. He placed the camera in his bag and left the store without paying for it. At the material time, the Accused had with him a sum of between $150 and $200 in cash and a credit card. The stolen camera was subsequently recovered from the Accused and no sales record was registered for it at the store. Westgate is a building used for the custody of property, and the stolen camera was taken out of the possession of the complainant who was the manager of the store. 5 The Accused consented to a third charge of theft in dwelling on 6 May 2017 of a “Hue Tap Switch” valued at $89.00 from a store called Harvey Norman located at Millennia Walk being taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing.",
        "The antecedents of the Accused": "6 The Accused had two sets of convictions prior to the present offences, one set of which was for property-related offences: Date of convictionOffenceProvisionSentence19 Jun 2009Criminal intimidationS 506 PC$1,800 fine(rendered spent on 2 Dec 2016)Using threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behaviour with intentS 13A(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997, Rev Ed) (“MOA”)Using threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behaviour within the hearing or sight of any personS 13B(1)(a) MOATIC30 Nov 2016TheftS 379 PC$2,000 fineTheftS 379 PCTheftS 379 PCTIC 7 Notably, the set of convictions dated 19 June 2009 were spent convictions. Section 7E of the Registration of Criminals Act (Cap 268, 1985 Rev Ed) (“ROCA”) provides for the legal effect of such convictions. Amongst other things, s 7E(1) of the ROCA deems the offender, in certain circumstances, to have had “no record” of his convictions which are spent or treated as spent. However, the protective provisions in ss 7E(1)(a) and (c) of the ROCA are subject to the caveat in s 7E(2)(c) and therefore do not extend to “any proceedings before a court” or to “any decision by a court, including any decision as to sentence”. On that basis, it would not be improper for me to mention or consider the Accused’s convictions dated 19 June 2009. Nor was it improper for the district judge below (“the DJ”) to have done the same in his grounds of decision (at [20] and [27]). The Accused did not submit otherwise. In any event, no material weight could be placed on these convictions given the lapse of time and the fact that they did not concern property-related offences.",
        "The proceedings below": "8 The events which transpired in the proceedings below were heavily disputed. I set them out briefly here and will elaborate on them later in this judgment. 9 Proceedings against the Accused were initiated in the State Courts on 19 May 2017. On 30 October 2017, the DJ conducted a pre-trial conference (“the 30 October PTC”) and saw both the Accused and a deputy public prosecutor, Ms Lim Yu Hui (“DPP Lim”), in chambers. The Accused was unrepresented at that time, and he continued to act in person throughout the course of the proceedings below as well as in the appeal before me. 10 On 8 November 2017, a hearing was conducted in open court (“the 8 November PG Hearing”) where the Accused pleaded guilty to the two proceeded charges and consented to the third charge being TIC for the purpose of sentencing. The DJ then imposed the following sentences: Charges under s 380 of the PCItems stolenSentence imposedFirst charge“Logitech Spotlight Presentation Remote” valued at $169.002 weeks’ imprisonmentSecond charge“Samsung Gear 360 Globe handheld camera” valued at $348.003 weeks’ imprisonmentThird charge“Hue Tap Switch” valued at $89.00TICAggregate Sentence3 weeks’ imprisonment (the sentences were ordered to run concurrently) 11 On 22 November 2017, which was the date the Accused was supposed to commence serving his sentence, he appeared before the DJ and sought a stay of execution pending appeal (“the 22 November Stay Hearing”). 12 On 2 January 2018, the DJ released his grounds of decision: seePublic Prosecutor vSukla Lalatendu[2018] SGDC 6 (“GD”). I will discuss this in further detail below.",
        "The proceedings on appeal": "13 On 21 November 2017, the Accused filed a Notice of Appeal stating that he was dissatisfied with the sentence imposed by the DJ. However, in his Petition of Appeal dated 17 January 2018, the Accused raised several arguments which did not relate to the sentence imposed, including that he had only pleaded guilty because “of the record promises and threats [sic]”, and that he had been “denied a constitutional right to counsel”. 14 The Accused subsequently tendered three sets of submissions dated 14, 21, and 28 March 2018, which I will refer to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Submissions respectively. The submissions focused primarily on his claim that even though he had not committed the offences, he had pleaded guilty to the charges because “he was misguided by the [DJ] and so as not to drag the case unnecessarily”. In the submissions, he also made several factual allegations about what the DJ had told him at the 30 October PTC. Although the Accused did not expressly state that he wished to retract his plea of guilt or file any application for criminal revision for that purpose, his intention to do just that seemed clear to me. 15 At the hearing before me on 3 April 2018, the Accused orally confirmed that he was seeking to retract his plea of guilt that had been taken at the 8 November PG Hearing. Anticipating this, the Prosecution had on 13 March 2018 filed Criminal Motion No 12 of 2018 (“CM 12”) in which it sought leave to adduce an affidavit deposed to by DPP Lim as to her version of what had transpired in chambers at the 30 October PTC (“the Affidavit”).",
        "The issues": "16 Two main issues arose for consideration in this appeal: (a) Whether the Accused should be allowed to retract his plea of guilt and have his convictions set aside, and in this regard, whether the Prosecution’s application to admit the Affidavit as additional evidence in CM 12 should be granted. (b) If the Accused should not be allowed to retract his plea of guilt, whether the sentences imposed by the DJ were manifestly excessive.",
        "Retraction of plea": "17 I turn first to the Accused’s oral application to retract his plea of guilt. The main thrust of his argument was that he had pleaded guilty even though he did not commit the offences because the DJ had made representations at the 30 October PTC which “misguided” him into thinking that he would be sentenced only to a day’s imprisonment and a fine, provided he pleaded guilty. Further, he alleged that the items that he surrendered to the authorities for investigation were actually his own property, and that the serial numbers on those items would not match the serial numbers of the items that had in fact been stolen. Before me, the Accused also clarified that he contested only his convictions in relation to the two proceeded charges; he raised no objections in respect of the third (TIC) charge. 18 The Prosecution opposed the Accused’s application. It sought the admission of the Affidavit in CM 12 on the basis that DPP Lim’s evidence was necessary for me to come to a conclusion as to what had in fact transpired at the 30 October PTC. Relying on the Affidavit, as well as the transcripts of the subsequent open court hearings, the Prosecution’s position was that the Accused’s allegations regarding the DJ’s alleged representations to him at the 30 October PTC were untruthful, and that he had in fact voluntarily decided to plead guilty at the subsequent 8 November PG Hearing.",
        "Admission of fresh evidence": "19 Before turning to the substantive analysis of the Accused’s application to retract his plea, the preliminary question was whether the Prosecution’s application to adduce the Affidavit in CM 12 should be granted. 20 In my judgment, it was clear that the Prosecution’s application should be granted. Under s 392(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), the appellate court is empowered, in dealing with a criminal appeal, to take any additional evidence itself or direct it to be taken by the trial court, if it thinks that such evidence is “necessary”. Insofar as applications by an accused person to retract his plea of guilt are concerned, the precedents show that depending on the nature of the allegations grounding the application, the courts will generally require the adduction of sworn or affirmed evidence by the relevant persons or authorities concerned. There are at least two reasons for this: first, to assist the court in its inquiry into the veracity of the accused’s allegations; and second, to allow the party or parties against whom allegations were made an opportunity to respond. 21 For instance, where allegations are made against the accused person’s previous defence counsel, such counsel ought to be directed or invited to respond by way of an affidavit or statutory declaration. This was done inThong Sing Hock v Public Prosecutor[2009] 3 SLR(R) 47 (“Thong Sing Hock”), where the accused asserted on appeal that he had pleaded guilty only on the advice of his previous counsel who allegedly knew that he did not possess the requisite mental element for the offence. VK Rajah JA, who heard the appeal in the High Court, invited the previous counsel to respond to the allegation and directed the Prosecution to investigate the matter further. After an adjournment, three affidavits were filed to which the court referred: (a) an affidavit by the previous counsel, (b) a response affidavit by the accused, and (c) an affidavit by the investigating officer as to matters within his knowledge which were relevant to the allegation (at [18]). The court further laid down at [30]–[32] the general procedure that may be adopted in investigating allegations made by an accused person against his previous counsel, which may be distilled as follows: (a) First, the accused should be asked to confirm his intention to make the specific allegations and to make clear the precise contents of these allegations. An affidavit may be required of the accused if the allegations are numerous and involved, but this is not necessary if the court can clearly distil their essence since the allegations would have to be made in open court and on the record. (b) Secondly, the accused’s previous counsel should be given an opportunity to respond. This is because the allegations will usually involve an attack on the counsel’s integrity and/or professionalism, and any alleged misconduct by a member of the profession often stains the image of the profession as a whole. Further, the evidence can then be evaluated to determine whether there is any basis for the accused’s allegations. There is no hard and fast rule about the modalities of how the previous counsel should respond, but the filing of an affidavit is often desirable as this will provide the court with sworn or affirmed evidence which can then form the basis for its decision. In contrast, significantly less weight may be attached to the previous counsel’s version of the events if he decides to respond by way of unsworn evidence. (c) Thirdly, the accused may be given an opportunity to respond to the evidence provided by his previous counsel. 22 I agree that this is generally sound as a matter of procedure. Indeed, I took a similar approach inChngLeng Khim v Public Prosecutor and another matter[2016] 5 SLR 1219 (“ChngLeng Khim”), where the accused alleged on appeal that she had pleaded guilty only because she was pressured into doing so by her previous counsel. I directed the relevant parties, including the accused and her previous counsel, to file statutory declarations regarding the events that led up to her pleading guilty at the hearing, and explained my reasons at [1] as follows: … after the [accused] persisted with her assertion that she had been pressured to plead guilty, including by [her previous counsel], I directed the various parties concerned to each file a statutory declaration (“SD”) detailing the events and exchanges leading to the [accused]’s plea of guilt. I did so because an allegation of pressure to plead guilty that is directed by an accused person at counsel often – as is the case here – concerns matters that the court will generally know nothing about but may well be relevant to the court’s decision on whether it will allow the application to set aside the plea. 23 The considerations and the procedures explicated inThong Sing HockandChngLeng Khimmay be applied with suitable modification in different contexts, where other kinds of allegations have been made to support an application to retract one’s guilty plea. To this end, it is not controversial that the Prosecution and other authorities may also be invited or directed to file an affidavit or statutory declaration if they are implicated by the allegations, or if they are aware of facts which might shed light on the veracity of the allegations (see, for instance,Thong Sing HockandMdRafiqul Islam Abdul Aziz v Public Prosecutor[2017] 3 SLR 619). 24 In the present case, the Accused’s allegations centered around what the DJ had allegedly said or done, in his capacity as a judicial officer, at the 30 October PTC. This conference was conducted in the privacy of the DJ’s chambers (which is the proper and usual practice for pre-trial conferences), and DPP Lim was the only person who was present apart from the Accused and the DJ. In that light, the Affidavit deposed to by DPP Lim was highly probative to my assessment of the veracity of the Accused’s allegations. The fact that it was not for the DJ as a judicial officer to provide evidence himself as to the events at the 30 October PTC was a further justification for admitting the Affidavit, since it would otherwise leave the court in the unenviable position of having to determine whether the plea should be set aside basedsolelyon the Accused’s account of the events. That would run against the need, which I have mentioned above (at [1]), for allegations against judicial officers to be closely investigated in order to ensure that any miscarriage of justice is promptly corrected, and to firmly and decisively protect the reputation of the judiciary against any unfounded allegation. 25 The Accused, in any event, did not seriously object to the admission of the Affidavit. His main contention was as to the accuracy of the contents of the Affidavit, and not its admissibility. In fact, in his 3rd Submissions, he stated that even though he disputed the contents of the Affidavit, he “understand [sic] the prosecutor should be allowed to submit a criminal motion”. 26 There was also no need for an adjournment or a further response by the Accused, since CM 12 was filed and the Affidavit disclosed on 13 March 2018, which was some weeks in advance of the hearing of this appeal on 3 April 2018 (see [15] above). In the circumstances, the Accused had ample opportunity to consider and respond to the contents of the Affidavit in his written submissions and, indeed, at the hearing before me. 27 For these reasons, I considered the admission of the Affidavit proper and necessary for the consideration of the Accused’s application to retract his plea of guilt. Pursuant to s 392(1) of the CPC, I allowed CM 12 at the hearing of the appeal and admitted the Affidavit as additional evidence in the appeal.",
        "The factual background": "28 I now set out the relevant facts of the proceedings below insofar as they bear on the application of the Accused to retract his plea. 29 As I have already mentioned, the Accused’s primary allegation was that the DJ had represented to him, at the 30 October PTC, that if he pleaded guilty, he would only be sentenced to a day’s imprisonment and a fine. In this regard, the Accused’s version of the events may be summarised as follows: (a) In chambers, the “very first statement” from the DJ before the Accused had said or asked anything was “why do you want to drag the case, it will be only one day prison and fine”. (b) The Accused was “never allowed” to say anything in chambers. (c) The Accused “truly trusted the [DJ’s] word and agreed to plead guilty even though [he] had not done the crime.” (d) The Accused was not alleging that the DJ had “promised [him] anything. The word promised [was] used by the prosecutors and not [him].” Rather, he “always thought anything the honourable Judge (of any jurisdiction and any country) says is more than a promise”. (e) He then asked the DJ how the Judge presiding over the plead guilty hearing would know about the one-day imprisonment term. The DJ said that he would preside over that hearing. (f) DPP Lim “ma[de] false affidavits and hid[] true facts” in the Affidavit. Referring specifically to para 5 of the Affidavit, he said he “never asked, about what would be the minimum punishment for section 380, as claimed by the prosecutor. I am completely aware of the Maximum sentence as mentioned in the charges. The prosecutor is simply making false statements and hiding true facts to cover up their inefficiency.” (g) The Prosecution’s allegation that the Accused had asked the DJ about the minimum sentence repeatedly was a “complete false statement”. 30 DPP Lim’s version of the events was set out in the Affidavit: (a) At the 30 October PTC, the Accused asked the DJ what sentence he would receive if he was convicted under s 380 of the PC. The DJ informed him that the best possible outcome would be a one-day imprisonment term. However, the DJ emphasised that the sentence would ultimately be a decision made by the sentencing judge, who would consider the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence as well as the Accused’s mitigation. (b) The Accused then stated that he would plead guilty if the sentence was a one-day imprisonment term. The DJ replied that the court was not making any promises, and that the sentence imposed would ultimately depend on the parties’ submissions. (c) The Accused repeated his position that he would plead guilty if the sentence was a one-day imprisonment term. The DJ again emphasised that the court could not make any promises, and that the sentence imposed would depend on the parties’ submissions. (d) DPP Lim then informed the DJ that the Prosecution did not make any promise concerning its sentencing position to the Accused. (e) The Accused acknowledged the DJ’s remarks to him and said that he would plead guilty. The DJ then gave directions for the Accused’s plea to be taken on a scheduled date. (f) DPP Lim “categorically state[d]” that the DJ did not tell the Accused that he would receive a sentence of one day’s imprisonment and a fine if he pleaded guilty. 31 The next time the Accused appeared before the DJ was at the 8 November PG Hearing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Claire Poh (“DPP Poh”) represented the Prosecution, and a copy of the verbatim transcripts of the hearing (“the PG Transcripts”) was made available to me. The PG Transcripts recorded the exchange between the DJ and the Accused which was salient and may be summarised as follows: (a) At the outset, before the Accused even indicated his willingness or otherwise to plead guilty, DPP Poh stated that the Prosecution “will be very upfront” about its sentencing position and this was that it sought “more than 3 weeks’ imprisonment if the accused pleads guilty. If the matter goes for trial, we would … submit for a higher imprisonment sentence.” DPP Poh also referred to a decision in a Magistrate’s Appeal involving a conviction under s 380 of the PC. (b) The DJ then asked the Accused if he intended to plead guilty or claim trial. The Accused claimed that “[i]n the PTC, [he] was informed that minimum---like, minimum will be 1-day prison”. The DJ replied: The minimum is 1 day by law. But like I said, it is not---does not mean that you may---you will get … 1-day imprisonment. So the Court will have to see what the submission of the prosecution is, what your mitigation is, what the facts are, before coming to a conclusion. Alright, so it’s up to you. The Accused repeatedly stressed that three weeks’ imprisonment would be “very difficult” for him because of his newborn child. The DJ told him that he had a choice whether to plead guilty or claim trial. When the Accused indicated that he was “not sure what to do”, the DJ offered to stand down the matter to give him more time to consider. (c) The Accused then stated that he was “not sure, why the prosecution is asking for 3 weeks … like, it will be minimum 3 weeks or it could be less as well. I’m not sure.” The DJ explained that the sentence that would eventually be imposed “could be less; it could be more; it could be exactly 3 weeks that the Court will sentence. I cannot tell you before you tell me your plea.” The DJ subsequently reiterated: “[s]o once there’s imprisonment, minimum is 1 day. It can go up to 7 years based on the provision in the law … Prosecution is asking for 3 weeks”. (d) The Accused indicated an intention to plead guilty. The following exchange then transpired: Court:  So do you want to plead guilty? Accused:  Plead guilty, 1 day, 1---like--- Court:  Okay, you ask for 1 day but you may not get 1 day. Do you still want to plead guilty? Accused:  Yes. Court:   Alright. Accused: 1 day and fine will be really good for me. Court:   Do you understand? This is not a plea bargain. I’m not accepting your plea if you--- Accused: I’m not---I’m not bargaining. I’m mi---I’m---I’m requesting. Court:  Okay, then you leave it for mitigation. (e) At this point, Mr Amarick Gill (“Mr Gill”), a senior member of the criminal bar, interjected. He did not formally represent the Accused but having witnessed this exchange in open court, he stepped in to try to assist him. Mr Gill proposed to the DJ that the matter be stood down for him to speak with the Accused. The DJ agreed but around 10 minutes later, Mr Gill informed the DJ that he had spoken with the Accused who informed that he “will handle this on his own right now”. Mr Gill added that he did not know what application the Accused was going to make. (f) When the DJ next sought to confirm whether the Accused intended to plead guilty, the Accused unequivocally responded in the affirmative. He then tried to ask for a lower sentence but the DJ firmly told him that he should first decide whether he wanted to plead guilty. To this, the Accused again confirmed that he intended to plead guilty. (g) The DJ then proceeded to formally record the Accused’s plea. The Accused pleaded guilty to the two proceeded charges and admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification. He also admitted to his antecedents which were read to him in court. This was followed by the respective oral sentencing submissions of the Prosecution and the Accused. It may be noted that in his submissions, the Accused made specific reference to the fact that imprisonment was mandatory in the case of a conviction under s 380 of the PC. (h) The DJ proceeded to make some sentencing remarks before announcing at the end that he was sentencing the Accused to an aggregate of 3 weeks’ imprisonment. Upon hearing that, the Accused claimed that he had denied committing two of the offences at the 30 October PTC. He also claimed that he had pleaded guilty only because he was told that it would be a one-day imprisonment term. The DJ responded by stating that “I already told you … there is a possibility you’ll get more than what you’ve asked for”. (i) The Accused then stressed again his familial circumstances and the plight of his newborn child. The DJ asked if he needed some time to make arrangements for his family. Subsequently, the Accused asked for two weeks’ deferment of the commencement of the sentence. The Prosecution did not object and the DJ granted the request. The Accused then asked for even more time, which the DJ disallowed. 32 Two weeks later, at the 22 November Stay Hearing, after the DJ granted the Accused’s application for a stay of execution pending appeal (see [11] above), the DJ called for the next matter to be heard. At this point, the Accused interrupted him and requested that the DJ “mention”, in his grounds of decision, the “indication” that his sentence would be a day’s imprisonment and a fine. The DJ immediately said “No, I told you there was no indication at all. There is a possibility but it’s not an indication”. The Accused then repeated that he “ha[d] not done both … crimes” and that his “plea of guilty was on condition that it will be 1-day prison”. The DJ pointed out that the Prosecution had indicated its sentencing position before the Accused pleaded guilty, and that the court had also told him that there could be imprisonment of more than one day. The Accused replied “Yes, yes, yes”, and the matter was concluded. 33 Those are the relevant facts against which I evaluated the application made by the Accused to set aside his plea and therefore his convictions.",
        "My decision": "57 In my judgment, it was clear that the sentences imposed were not manifestly excessive. I agreed that a deterrent sentence was called for, with appropriate emphasis in this case on the interest of specific deterrence, given the Accused’s recent set of property-related antecedents in November 2016 (see [6] above). Further, the sentences were in line with the three-week imprisonment term imposed by the district judge inJaidul, which was subsequently upheld on appeal by See Kee Oon JC (as he then was) in Magistrate’s Appeal No 9133 of 2015. There, the offender committed theft in dwelling of various items collectively worth $230.00 from the Mustafa Shopping Centre in circumstances where he pleaded guilty and the stolen items were all subsequently recovered. In this regard, I should also point out that the DJ had erred in finding thatallthe items had been recovered in the present case, since the Statement of Facts only recorded the recovery of the Samsung Gear 360 Globe handheld camera (which was the subject of the second charge) and not the Logitech Spotlight Presentation Remote (which was the subject of the first charge) (see [4] above). To that extent, the present case was slightly more serious thanJaidul. 58 As for the other sentencing factors, I considered that none were materially operative. (a) The DJ mentioned that the value of the stolen items was “not insignificant” (see [54(c)] above). Insofar as the DJ took this as an aggravating factor, he might have erred because the value of the stolen items had already been used to compare the present case toJaidulin order to derive the starting sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment, and so to use this factor againin calibrating the sentence upwards from that imposed inJaidulwould constitute double counting. (b) The Accused’s familial circumstances were not exceptional and could not possibly constitute a mitigating factor. (c) I also did not place weight on the Prosecution’s submission that the sentences imposed by the DJ in this case were too lenient because they had taken into account an unwarranted discount for the Accused’s earlier plea of guilt (see [55(e)] above). Such an analysis was invoked inThong Sing Hock, the brief facts of which I have recounted above (at [21]). In that case, the court dismissed the offender’s application to retract his plea and thereupon raised the sentence from 24 months’ to 33 months’ imprisonment on the basis that the sentencing judge had given an unwarranted discount for the offender’s guilty plea in the light of his lack of remorse on appeal. There is force in this analysis, but in the present case, although I did think that the sentences were somewhat lenient for the reasons I set out at [57] and [59], I was not minded to enhance the sentences that had been imposed. Among other things, the allegations, while serious, were relatively confined. Further, the Prosecution did not file a cross-appeal seeking enhancement of the sentences. I was also mindful that such reasoning should not be lightly invoked to enhance the sentence imposed below, lest it chills what might turn out to be legitimate attempts to retract a plea of guilt. 59 In any case, the aggregate sentence imposed by the DJ was on thelowside, since the Accused was effectivelynotbeing punished at all for the second charge by virtue of the DJ’s decision to run both the individual sentences concurrently. As I observed recently inPublic Prosecutor vRaveen Balakrishnan[2018] SGHC 148, where unrelated offences are involved, individual sentences should generally be ordered to run consecutively, with possible adjustments made to the aggregate sentence on account of the totality principle at the end of the sentencing process to ensure the proportionality of the aggregate sentence (at [98(b)] and [98(c)]). However, since, as I have already noted, the Prosecution had not appealed for a higher sentence, I did not interfere with the sentences that were imposed in this case.",
        "Appeal against sentence": "50 I turn to explain my decision regarding the sentence imposed on the Accused.",
        "The submissions below": "51 In respect of the offence of theft in dwelling under s 380 of the PC, it was common ground that imprisonment was mandatory and could be as much as seven years, and in addition, a fine may also be imposed (see [3] above). 52 The Prosecution sought an aggregate imprisonment term of more than three weeks, or at least 22 days. In this regard, they relied onPublic Prosecutor vJaidul Late Jomshid Mia[2015] SGDC 256 (“Jaidul”) in which the district judge sentenced the offender to three weeks’ imprisonment for theft in dwelling of items worth $230.00 from the Mustafa Shopping Centre. The sentence was upheld on appeal to the High Court. The Prosecution argued that the Accused was more culpable than the offender inJaidulgiven the former’s antecedents. 53 In mitigation, the Accused submitted for a fine and the minimum mandatory one-day imprisonment. He repeatedly stressed that he had two children: a 2-year-old and a newborn. He and his wife did not have a domestic helper and the children needed both of their parents. He promised the DJ that he would never offend again, and invited the DJ to put “a note” on his record that if he reoffended, a three-week imprisonment term could be added to his sentence at that time. 54 The DJ imposed two and three weeks’ imprisonment in respect of the two proceeded charges respectively, which were ordered to run concurrently for an aggregate sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment (see [10] above). In the GD, the DJ reasoned as follows: (a) The overriding sentencing consideration in relation to a property offence committed out of greed was deterrence (GD at [25]). The Accused committed the offences out of greed. He stole items that could not on any basis be considered necessities. He also had the means to pay for them but deliberately chose not to do so (GD at [26]). (b) Specific deterrence was also relevant. The Accused had been let off with a fine for his theft antecedents in late 2016. Barely six months later, he re-offended not once but three times (GD at [27]). (c) The value of the items stolen was not insignificant (GD at [26]). (d) The Accused’s plea to consider the plight of his children was heartfelt but could not carry much weight as it did not amount to exceptional or extreme circumstances (GD at [28]). (e) The mandatory minimum of a day’s imprisonment would be manifestly inadequate in the light of the number of charges and the antecedents (GD at [29]). (f) As mitigating factors, the Accused pleaded guilty and “all the items had been recovered” (GD at [30]).",
        "Arguments on appeal": "55 On appeal, the Prosecution sought to uphold the sentences imposed by the DJ and advanced the following submissions: (a) There was a clear need for specific deterrence in this case. Leniency had been shown to the Accused when he was sentenced to a fine in November 2016 for theft offences. Yet, the Accused remained wholly undeterred. (b) The Accused had committed the offences out of greed. (c) His familial circumstances did not amount to exceptional hardship and therefore the DJ was correct in placing little mitigating weight on this fact. (d) The sentences imposed by the DJ were aligned with that inJaidul. (e) In fact, the sentences imposed were on the low side because the DJ had placed mitigating weight on the fact that the Accused pleaded guilty. This was an unwarranted discount in the light of the fact that the Accused was, on appeal, shirking responsibility for his actions, and had launched baseless and vexatious allegations against the DJ. 56 The Accused did not raise any substantive arguments as to why the sentences imposed by the DJ were manifestly excessive.",
        "Other allegations": "60 In his Petition of Appeal, the Accused raised an argument that he had been denied his constitutional right to counsel (see [13] above). The Accused did not mention this anywhere else in his written submissions, and he did not pursue this in oral arguments before me. It thus appeared that he had discarded this argument. In any event, there was no basis at all to find that the Accused had been denied access to counsel within a reasonable time after his arrest(seeJames Raj s/oArokiasamy v Public Prosecutor[2014] 3 SLR 750 at [31]). In fact, the Accused was released on bail and could have instructed counsel at any time but apparently chose not to do so. The open court transcripts of the 8 November PG Hearing and the 22 November Stay Hearing showed that the Accused made no complaint about any prejudice or earlier attempt to preclude him from seeking counsel, and also made no request for more time to seek representation. Indeed, it appeared that he had rejected Mr Gill’s offer of help at the 8 November PG Hearing (see [31(e)] above). In my judgment, this allegation was nothing more than an afterthought contrived on appeal to avoid the sentence which was appropriately imposed but more onerous than that which the Accused had hoped for.",
        "Conclusion": "61 For these reasons, I dismissed the Accused’s application to retract his plea of guilt and for his convictions to be set aside. I also dismissed the Accused’s appeal against his sentence.
