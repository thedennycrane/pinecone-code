        "The Facts": "2 The material facts are these. The plaintiffs at all material times\n\ncarry on business as building contractors. Mr Ong Kuy Kiong (\"Mr Ong\") and his\n\nwife were the original promoters, shareholders and directors of both Wiseco and VS\n\nIntegrated. Eventually, Mr Ong and his wife owned 254,000 shares and 146,000 shares in\n\nWiseco, all of $1 each.3 Wiseco proposed to build a warehouse. By a building agreement dated\n\n21 October 1995 between Jurong Town Corporation (\"JTC\") and Wiseco, Wiseco\n\nagreed to build a warehouse and ancillary buildings on a piece of land known as Private\n\nLot A13923 forming part of Government Resurvey Lot 1790, Mukim No. 11 Kranji, Singapore\n\nestimated to contain an area of 4,2128 square metres(\"the property\"). For that\n\npurpose, Wiseco was granted a licence. When Wiseco put in the stipulated minimum\n\ninvestment, completed the building satisfactorily and otherwise complied with the\n\nprovisions of the building agreement, JTC would grant it a 30 year lease.4 For the purposes of evaluating the evidence and determining the\n\nissues of fact in this case, it is important to bear in mind in particular the\n\nover-reaching rights of JTC as the owner of the property of which Wiseco, the licensee\n\ncoupled with an interest in land which may be defeasible. If Wiseco had breached any part\n\nof the building agreement, which remained un-remedied after due notice, or if they\n\nsuffered any process of execution by any of their judgment creditors, JTC under clause\n\n3(b) of the building agreement had the \"right\" and \"power\" at their\n\noption to re-enter and take possession of the property \"and all buildings structures\n\nfixtures and plant material and effects whatsoever thereon with power to hold and dispose\n\nthereof as if [the building agreement] had not been entered into and without making to the\n\n[Wiseco] any compensation or allowance for the same and [the building agreement] shall\n\nthereupon determine…\" (the words within the brackets are added for clarity). To\n\nencourage financial institutions to finance industrial development, there was the usual\n\nproviso stipulating that JTC shall not re-enter and re-possess the property \"until\n\nthe Owner (i.e. JTC) has served upon the mortgagee notice in writing specifying the breach\n\nand the mortgagee has failed to remedy such breach\". ( the words in brackets are\n\nadded).5 In 1996 Wiseco obtained a construction loan of $3.3 million from\n\nOverseas Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd. Wiseco began to build. They engaged a piling\n\ncontractor to complete the piling works. The piling contractor was paid $332,008.46 and\n\nthe additional sum of $9,960.25. The piling contractor was paid these sums out of the\n\nconstruction loan as to 70%. The balance was paid by Wiseco out of their own funds.6 By a building contract in writing dated 5 May 1998 between the\n\nplaintiffs and Wiseco, the plaintiffs agreed to carry out the civil works and build the\n\nwarehouse on the property according to the approved plans. It was common ground that as at\n\n3 June 1998 the plaintiffs had not commenced the construction works, though the plaintiffs\n\nhad already started on the preliminaries and mobilized their manpower and equipment for\n\nthe building and civil work. It was during this period of time that the plaintiffs,\n\nthrough their director Mr Tay Kia Lim (\"Mr Tay\"), learnt that Mr Ong was\n\nadjudged a bankrupt on 29 May 1998 and so was his wife Madam Ng shortly thereafter.7 There was some controversy over the reasons why the plaintiffs\n\ncontinued with their construction works, as to which I will return later in this judgment,\n\nthe fact remained that they carried on with the construction works. The sub-structure work\n\nwas completed and the architects certified, in response to the plaintiffs’ Progress\n\nClaim No. 2 dated 19thAugust 1998 that a sum of $264,843.00 was due and\n\npayable, together with the GST amounting to $7,945.29.8 No payment was made and on 8 September 1998 the plaintiffs ceased all\n\nfurther work under the building contract. On 23 February 1999 the plaintiffs sued Wiseco\n\nand obtained judgment in the sum of $272,788.29 and costs of $1,200. The plaintiffs took\n\nno effective action to execute on the judgment or wind up Wiseco. The reasons are again in\n\ncontroversy and I will return to them when I consider the plaintiffs’ allegations of\n\nconspiracy against Mr Ong, his wife and the defendants.9 In October 1998, Mr Ong and his wife Madam Ng transferred all their\n\nshares in VS Integrated to the 3rdand 4thdefendants who are\n\nrespectively Mr Ong’s brother and father. On 28 July 1999 the paid up capital of VS\n\nIntegrated was increased to $300,000.00 and they were held by the 3rdand 4thdefendants. In mid-March, 2000 the 4thdefendant transferred to another brother\n\nof Mr Ong, Mr Ong Kway Kiau. Mr Ong Kway Kiau was later convinced of the viability of the\n\nwarehouse project and agreed to be the financier. He later became the substantial\n\nshareholder of VS Integrated. By an agreement dated 27 February 1999 Wiseco agreed to sell\n\nand VS Integrated to purchase Wiseco’s right, title and interest over the property\n\nunder the JTC building agreement for the price of $50,000.00. On 30 July 1999 Wiseco with\n\nthe consent of JTC by a Deed of Assignment assigned all their rights, title and interest\n\nin and under their building agreement with JTC to VS Integrated for the consideration of\n\n$50,000. Not counting the value of the property as such, the worth of the piling works and\n\nthe sub-structure works was just over $600,000.00. At the trial, counsel for the\n\nplaintiffs itemised the works done and materials supplied and paid for by the plaintiffs.\n\nThey totalled $708,759.29. There was no challenge to this figure and upon the assignment\n\nto VS Integrated, the latter would take the benefit of it. Before the assignment the only\n\n2 shares in Wiseco, which were previously each owned by Mr Ong and his wife, Madam Ng,\n\nwere transferred in October 1998 by the Official Assignee of their bankruptcy estates to\n\nthe 3rddefendant and the 4thdefendant.10 After becoming licensees of the property of the JTC, VS Integrated\n\nengaged another construction company to complete the unfinished building and civil work.\n\nThe plaintiffs were evicted from the property. In January 2001 VS Integrated obtained a\n\nconstruction loan of S1.5 million from United Overseas Bank (\"UOB\") against a\n\nlegal mortgage of their rights, title and interests over the property. A joint and several\n\npersonal guarantee was signed by the 3rdand the said Mr Ong Kway Kiau in\n\nfavour of UOB as additional security. At the time when the action came up for trial, the\n\nconstruction works were substantially completed.11 I should mention the amounts of money which VS Integrated had to pay\n\nout in taking over the rights of Wiseco over the property. They paid off the outstanding\n\nmonies due to OCBC in exchange for OCBC’s release of their mortgage. The payment\n\ntotaled $303,407.23 and this sum included the sum of $50,000 which VS Integrated had paid\n\nto Wiseco.. They also paid the arrears of rental due to JTC who required payment as a\n\ncondition of their consent to the assignment by Wiseco to VS Integrated. The sum paid was\n\n$34,134.39.",
        "Allegations of civil conspiracy and intention to defraud creditors": "12 I now turn to plaintiff’s allegations that from August 1998 Mr\n\nOng and/or his wife and the defendants or any of them had \"unlawfully conspired with\n\nthe predominant purpose to injure the plaintiffs by cheating and defrauding them and\n\npreventing the plaintiffs from recovering the sum due to them under the certificate of\n\npayment and/or the judgment\". They alleged that Mr Ong, in failing to obtain a\n\nspecial resolution of Wiseco in general meeting approving the assignment, had contravened\n\nsections 157 and 160 of the Companies Act, Cap 50. He and inferentially the Ong family\n\nmembers, all of whom had been referred to earlier, had deceived the plaintiffs’ Mr\n\nTay, had made fraudulent misrepresentations and had converted some of the plaintiffs’\n\nbuilding materials, formworks and steel scald-folding works which were left behind in the\n\nproperty after they were evicted from the property.13 Mr Tay in evidence alleged that though he was concerned about\n\nnon-payment, he was deceived by Mr Ong when he saw him at the latter’s office on 3\n\nJune 1998. Mr Ong he said lied to him that the OCBC would pay the plaintiffs in the same\n\nway that the piling contractor had been paid. Mr Ong showed him the documents about the\n\nconstruction loan, though he admitted that the availability period of the loan was only\n\njust about 2 more months down the road. During the period from August 1998 to July 1999,\n\nMr Ong also misled Mr Tay by assuring the latter that Mr Ong’s brother would take\n\nover the shares of Wiseco and provide the funds for Wiseco to proceed with the\n\nconstruction of the warehouse. Relying on those assurances, which turned out to be false,\n\nMr Tay of the plaintiffs decided not to take any further action, even though they had\n\nobtained judgment against Wiseco. Neither did he petition for the winding up of Wiseco\n\nalthough the usual statutory demand was served on Wiseco on 18 May 1999. Mr Tay explained\n\nthat he stayed his hand because of the assurances of Mr Ong which turned out to be false.\n\nHad he filed the company winding up petition, the assignment which took place later would\n\nhave been stopped and the plaintiffs’ claims as judgment creditors would have to be\n\narranged or compromised before the assignment to VS Integrated could proceed.14 The plaintiffs relied on a number of overt acts by Mr Ong, his wife\n\nand the other defendants. In September, Mr Ong and his wife transferred the 2 shares in VS\n\nIntegrated to the 3rdand 4thdefendants. They and all the\n\ndefendants had firmed up the intention to use VS Integrated to take over the property from\n\nWiseco. Third parties replaced them as directors of Wiseco. The assignment took place.\n\nAccording to the plaintiffs, the assignment was done at such an undervalue that Mr Ong and\n\nhis wife as directors were clearly in breach of their duties under section 157 of the\n\nCompanies Act, Cap 50 to act honestly and diligently in the discharge of their duties to\n\nWiseco. Further, they failed to obtain the necessary approval of Wiseco in general meeting\n\nas required by section 160 of the Companies Act, Cap 50. In taking over the property, the\n\ndefendants (who were not named) also converted to their use building materials and\n\nequipment belonging to the plaintiffs, namely the steel reinforcement bars, timber shutter\n\nformworks, used timber formworks and used steel scaffoldings.15 The plaintiffs conducted an examination of Wiseco’s financial\n\nmatters. The plaintiffs were told in the examination that the financial records and\n\naccounts of Wiseco had been misplaced. They drew a blank; the point was made that the\n\nunavailability of the accounts added further suspicion against the good faith of Wiseco\n\nand their directors.16 The plaintiffs rely on the evidence set out above to found their\n\nclaims of conspiracy and the invalidation of the assignment on the ground that it was made\n\nby Wiseco with the intention to defraud creditors.",
        "The defence version": "17 Mr Ong gave evidence. At that time, he was in the employ of VS\n\nIntegrated. He was dealing with the purchase and sale of furniture. According to him, he\n\ntold Mr Tay of the plaintiffs when the prospects of bankruptcy loomed large. Mr Tay was\n\nreassuring saying that he would continue with the project and complete the warehouse after\n\nwhich it could be sold. He did not deceive him or make any of those misrepresentations. In\n\nfact, by their letter of 3 June 1998 to the architects, the plaintiffs stated that\n\njudgment had been entered on 29 May 1998 against Mr Ong by Chen Hock Heng Textile Co. Pte\n\nLtd in the sum of $200,000 and that the solicitors of the judgment creditor were\n\nproceeding to serve a bankruptcy petition on him. He sought instructions from both the\n\narchitects and Wiseco. At that time, he had not commenced civil works on the\n\nsuperstructure, though he had carried out preliminaries as mentioned earlier.18 Mr Ong met Mr Tay again sometime in December 1998. He told him that\n\nhe was unable to carry on the business of the company. He had approached many people to\n\ntake over the company but no one wanted to take over. Mr Ong said he had also approached\n\nJTC officers and offered to return the land. The officers told him that as he had started\n\npiling work, it would be very troublesome for them to take back the land. They also\n\nconsidered the loan to the OCBC as a very troublesome matter. The officers indicated to\n\nhim that JTC would consider any party taking over if that party would pay the loan to the\n\nbank.19 Mr Ong then suggested to Mr Tay to take over the land. He informed\n\nhim that he had paid yearly rental of about $80,000; and it totalled about $240,000. The\n\nproperty tax paid was $30,000. Wiseco took a loan of about $300,000. Mr Ong told Mr Tay\n\nthat the pressing items were the bank loan of about $200,000, JTC rental arrears of\n\n$50,000 and property tax of about $10,000 which had to be paid by the party taking over\n\nthe land. He requested Mr Tay to take over the land and pay for those items only. But Mr\n\nTay declined, saying that Wiseco already owed him about $200,000. It was clear that he had\n\napprised Mr Tay of the fact that JTC did not want to re-enter and re-possess, outsiders\n\ndid not want it and he told Mr Tay that he would ask his elder brother, Ong Kway Kiau\n\nwhether he would be interested to take over the property. In these circumstances, Mr Ong\n\ndid not agree that the value of the property was $680,00 as suggested to him in cross\n\nexamination. He said even though about $900,000 was expended for the project, there were\n\nno takers at all.20 Mr Ong said that the idea of his brother Mr Ong Kway Kiau taking\n\nover Wiseco’s rights and interest in the property by means of VS Integrated came from\n\nhim, after he had asked Mr Ong questions about the viability of the project. Mr Ong Kway\n\nKiau said the idea of using VS Integrated came from him. Mr Ong Kway Kiau’s evidence\n\nabout the date when he first thought of taking over was tentative; at one stage he said it\n\nwas at the end of December 1998 or January 1999. He told the court he was not sure as to\n\nthe date when the decision to invest in VS Integrated was first made. When his attention\n\nwas drawn to the fact VS Integrated had applied to PUB for supply of water in November\n\n1998 and the fact that Wiseco and VS Integrated had applied to JTC for approval of the\n\nproposed assignment on 15 December 1998, he said he did not know, meaning I gathered that\n\nhe was not sure. It was, in my view, immaterial to know the precise date. He even said\n\nthat prior to December 1998 there was a meeting between him and his brother but that no\n\ndecision was made whether he would take over through VS Integrated.21 He was told of the debts of Wiseco and obviously he would not want\n\nto carry those burdens in addition to the investments to complete the project. He left it\n\nto his solicitors to effect the taking over. Mr Ong Kway Kiau also told the court that he\n\nleft it to his lawyers to advise on the sum he was to pay. He said he would listen to his\n\nlawyers and would pay whatever the sum they advised. Mr Ong waived privilege of his\n\ncommunications with the solicitors but plaintiffs decided not to call the solicitor in\n\ncharge to give evidence. The question of Mr Ong Kway Kiau waiving privilege was not raised\n\nby anybody. When asked to account for the sources of his wealth, he told the court that\n\nhis means came from his business in buying and selling second hand machinery.",
        "Law of conspiracy and intention to defraud creditors": "22InChew Kong Huat v Recwill (Singapore) Pte Limited[2000] 1 SLR 385, the Court of appeal in page 399, para 34 laid down that \"a\n\nconspiracy by unlawful means is constituted when two or more persons combine to commit an\n\nunlawful act with the intention of injuring or damaging the plaintiff, and the act is\n\ncarried out and the intention achieved\". It was pointed out that the presence of a\n\npredominant intention to injure the plaintiff was \"not a necessary ingredient for the\n\ntort of conspiracy by unlawful means\". It was only necessary when a conspiracy by\n\nunlawful means was alleged. In the present case, the plaintiffs have to prove, inter alia,\n\nthat Mr Ong, his wife Madam Ng and all and any of the defendants had combined with the\n\nintention of defrauding the plaintiffs by means of the assignment to VS Integrated.23 I turn to the ambit of section 73B(1) of the CLPA. The subsection\n\nprovided that \"every conveyance of property made whether before or after 12thNovember 1993, with intention to defraud creditors, shall be voidable, at the instance of\n\nany person thereby prejudiced\". InQuah Kay Tee v Ong & Co Pte Ltd[1997] 1 SLR 390the Court of Appeal ruled that on the evidence in that case the presumption of\n\nfraudulent intent could be properly triggered against the transferor of the shares.\n\nTherefore, the voluntary share transfer was rendered voidable.",
        "Central Issue of fact": "24 Common to both causes of action was the intention of Mr Ong and Mr\n\nOng Kway Kiau representing the minds and management of Wiseco and VS Integrated. The\n\ncommon question of fact is this: did they and the companies intend to defraud the\n\nplaintiff and other creditors of Wiseco when they effected the assignment for the\n\nconsideration and in the circumstances recited in this judgment?",
        "My findings": "25 In my judgment, they did not intend to defraud the plaintiffs as\n\ncreditors. Both Mr Ong and Mr Ong Kway Kiau were interested to salvage whatever they could\n\nin the project to be developed on the property. They left it to the solicitors to advise\n\non the amounts to pay both for the assignment and in order to obtain both the consent of\n\nJTC and the release of OCBC in respect of the mortgage. If the plaintiffs had proceeded to\n\nwind up Wiseco, the assignment could not have taken place. The Liquidators of Wiseco could\n\nhave assigned the company’s rights and interests (if any) with the consent of JTC. It\n\nwould inevitably have followed that plaintiffs would have had to file their proof of debt\n\nand one could not possibly speculate on the dividend that could be available for\n\ndistribution pari passu among the unsecured creditors. It could well have been either a\n\nre-entry by the JTC or the payment of the secured mortgagee, OCBC, and other charges such\n\nas the JTC rental arrears and the property taxes. It was not demonstrated before me\n\nwhether Wiseco could get any surplus for pari passu distribution among their creditors\n\nafter the payments of these priority claims. In the case of a JTC re-entry, Wiseco would\n\nend up with nothing but the un-discharged liabilities still remained. If nothing was done,\n\nthe rights and interests of Wiseco in the property might well have been nil. I entirely\n\naccept that Mr Ong tried to secure buyers of the rights and interests of Wiseco, including\n\nthe plaintiffs through his conversations with Mr Tay, but he could not get any party\n\ninterested except his brother, Mr Ong Kway Kiau who had the financial means and who,\n\nthrough his ties of kinship with Mr Ong, had the added emotional incentive to jump in and\n\nsalvage what could be salvaged. There was not a shred of evidence to suggest that Mr Ong\n\nKway Kiau was standing in for Mr Ong, as one question in cross had suggested. The question\n\nwas impermissible as this important allegation was not pleaded.26 On this analysis of the very limited options available to both Mr\n\nOng and Mr Ong Kway Kiau, it is in my view predictable that VS Integrated would be a\n\nconvenient vehicle to take the assignment and for fresh banking facilities and injection\n\nof capital to continue with and complete the warehouse project. After all, Mr Ong Kway\n\nKiau invested a substantial sum and undertook the burden of the joint and several\n\nguarantee in favour of the UOB.27 On the evidence, I accept Mr Ong’s evidence that he did not\n\ndeceive Mr Tay in the ways and by the misrepresentations as alleged. The plaintiffs took a\n\ndecision not to wind up Wiseco. Through their solicitors they made many demands but they\n\ndid not take effective steps to stop the assignment by winding up Wiseco before the Deed\n\nof Assignment was executed. I also find on the defence evidence that the allegations of\n\nconversion of the plaintiffs’ materials and equipment were not proven.",
        "Conclusion": "28 Accordingly, the claims of the plaintiffs are dismissed with costs.Sgd:Lai Kew ChaiJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
