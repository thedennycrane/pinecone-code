        "(iv) the inaccurate profit forecast of US$5.5m": "75        The draft interim accounts (with bonus as a suspense item) were presented by the plaintiff to the committee of BSBM on 8 February 2002.  Those accounts contained a profit forecast of US$5.5m which the plaintiff said was done by Low.  The forecast was the basis for another complaint in the defendant's Counterclaim.  The plaintiff also relied on Kaka Singh's opinion for his contention that the incorrect forecast (provided by Low) did not make a significant/material impact on the accounts ending 31 December 2001. (v)  under-provision for audit fees and removal of provision for accounting fees. 76        The plaintiff was under the misconception that there was a provision for US$900,000 as accounting fees for KPMG for financial year 2001.  On 29 January 2002, the plaintiff met Paul Ma and Carol Eapen of KPMG to resolve the latter's accounting support services; it was agreed at US$200,000.  Carol Eapen also reiterated that the full audit fee of US$900,000 had been provided for in the 2001 accounts. 77        In January 2002, Low told Carol Eapen he had difficulty reconciling the provision made at year-end to the audit fee of US$900,000 approved by the audit committee.  As in the case of the bonus provision, the plaintiff told Low to continue looking for the 'missing' item.  On reviewing the interim accounts the plaintiff discovered that Low (and Low's assistant Lim Yew Si) had added a figure of US$400,000 in respect of the missing provision for audit fee, as well as the support service fee.  The plaintiff said he told Lim Yew Si the provision was premature and instructed Low to reflect this figure as an entry in a suspense holding account, until the appropriate accounting entry could be worked out. 78        Due to time constraints as with the bonus issue, the plaintiff decided to leave the interim accounts as they were, when he reported to the BSBM at the meeting on 7 February 2002.  He pointed out that neither Low nor Lim Yew Si disagreed with his decision.  In fact, Low presented the half year accounts to both the audit committee and the board of the defendant.  If indeed (as he claimed in his affidavit evidence) Low was uncomfortable with the plaintiff's accounting treatment of any items in the accounts, Low did not inform the plaintiff.  The accounts were issued on 19 March 2002.  Like the provision on the bonus item, the plaintiff noted that the defendant had conceded in their latest pleadings that the provision existed in the accounts.  He denied counsel's suggestion that he had deliberately withheld financial information from the defendant's board of directors in both instances. 79        In the course of his re-examination, the plaintiff clarified his and his deputies’ roles.  He explained that Dominic Siu (and Low) was responsible for producing the management and consolidated accounts of the group whereas his responsibility extended beyond numbers crunching - he had to look for new investments/projects, source funding for the same and raise debts, improving shareholder value in the process.  His view was echoed by Kaka Singh who stated that although the plaintiff would have a fairly 'big picture' responsibility, risk management was not only in the plaintiff's hands but also in thoseof everybody in the organisation(V/N  738).  However, Kaka Singh conceded that the plaintiff should know the covenants in a major facility and if there was a breach, it was the fault of the team who was in charge for which the plaintiff was ultimately responsible. 80        In an attempt to resolve the controversy regarding what was said about and whether, the accounts which the plaintiff presented for 2001 gave a true and fair view, the plaintiff called to the stand Reggie Thein (Thein), an independent non-executive director of the defendant.  Thein is a retired accountant who is the chairman of the defendant's audit committee. 81        Thein testified he was aware that the audit/accounting fee was going to be substantially higher than what was provided in the 2001 accounts; he was told by the auditors after the audit meeting on 1 March 2001.  However, he could not recall being told by anyone of the provision for higher audit fees after 19 March  2001 (contradicting Low who said he had then also informed Thein of the bonus provision) when the half-yearly results (for the second half of 2001) were released to the SGX.  When Julie Coyne (PW3) testified, she said she (as the partner of KPMG in charge of the audit) was not told before the accounts were audited, that there was an under-provision by the defendant of the audit fees as well as for the $1.2m bonus.  Although it was Thein's view that the higher audit fee (and bonus provision) would have a material effect on the half yearly accounts, he said no attempt was made to correct the same as, the interim accounts were not audited, the error was afait accompliand the inaccurate numbers would be adjusted in the year-end accounts. 82        Thein was unaware and the audit committee was not told, of the breach of either the ACIL or NAB covenants, nor that the plaintiff had caused them, until Low told him and KPMG at a lunch meeting, when it was raised with a view to negotiating a lower audit fee.  He thought it was a strong bargaining point as KPMG should have been fully aware of the covenants.  As this evidence was not put to Julie Coyne by either party, the court does not have KPMG's views on the matter.  However, when he was questioned by both counsel, Thein opined that the ultimate responsibility to ensure there was no breach of the covenants remained with the plaintiff, notwithstanding that the Australian CFO was primarily responsible; the buck stopped with the plaintiff (V/N681).  Granted, the plaintiff did not attend the audit committee meeting on 1 March 2001 but, the plaintiff should nevertheless have conveyed his views to the committee on the inadequate provision for both items. 83        Thein had attended the meeting of the defendant's board of directors in Bermuda on 14 December 2001 at which the plaintiff was present.  Thein was clear that the board only agreed to a figure of US$10m for the purchase of Kaluakoi, as minuted.  He recalled that the board specifically informed the plaintiff no more money would be spent on the acquisition.  He was not told about the additional spending of US$5.5m until well after the event.  I note that even in the report of KPMG to the audit committee for the year ended 4 September 2002, no mention was made (see AB3095) that the cost of purchase of Kaluakoi was more than US$10m due to mandatory compliance with DOH requirements.  I find it extraordinary that besides the plaintiff, so many others (including KPMG Hawaii who went through the books of the defendant and MRL), could have missed these items of compulsory expenditure. 84        Thein also disapproved of the plaintiff's treatment of the bonus provision and audit fee as suspense account items.  As far as Thein was aware, since his appointment to the audit committee, on 2 September 2000, the defendant's books did not provide for a suspense account.  This was later confirmed by Julie Coyne of KPMG.  One of Thein's primary tasks as a member of the audit committee was to resolve the defendant's accounting records, which he described as in a terrible state.  He had insisted that accounting figures must be accurate, citing as an example a discrepancy of over US$50m in foreign exchange alone. 85        The defendant's main witness was Terry (DW1), a qualified lawyer in four (4) jurisdictions namely, Australia (Victoria), England/Wales, Hong Kong and Washington State in America.  Terry now runs his own consultancy business (called Eastwood Square) in Seattle.  His business acted as a consultant to the Guoco Group identifying investments for Quek for six months, until September 2002.  Terry was responsible for recruiting the plaintiff from Jardines (where Terry also worked); he, the plaintiff and Simon Tuxen were close friends for more than 20 years. 86        I should point out that Terry's affidavit of evidence-in-chief was a radical departure from the affidavit which he filed earlier to resist the plaintiff's application for O 14 judgment.  In his O 14 affidavit (as with the defendant's original Defence), Terry made no issue of the fact that the plaintiff had sued the wrong party, only that the latter's misconduct disentitled him to severance payments.  Much time was spent by counsel in cross-examining Terry on his shift in position.  Terry candidly admitted that he (and the defendant's lawyers) had made a mistake in that regard.  The reason (according to counsel for the defendant) was attributable to the fact that Terry was not given a copy of the statement of claim (V/N877) or the plaintiff’s O 14 affidavit, when he was asked to affirm an affidavit to resist the application for summary judgment. 87        Considerable time was also spent in cross-examining Terry on the dual employment contract system applicable at the material time to him, the plaintiff and other senior management staff and the reasons therefor.  As in the case when the plaintiff was cross-examined, counsel questioned Terryin extensoon the terms of the principal employment contract and those in the regional employment contracts, as to which provisions were transferred to the regional employment contracts and which remained with the principal employment contract.  Terry’s consistent stand was, the plaintiff’s principal employment contract continued to exist to the extent that it was not covered in the regional employment contracts (V/N893).  He pointed out that hiring, firing and paying were the purview of the Remuneration Committee of the defendant, comprising inter alia of Quek and Terry (as the CEO) whilst the mechanics of actual payment were left to the relevant contracting subsidiaries; this would equally apply to severance payments. 88        The conclusion one draws from Terry's testimony is, however one interprets the principal employment contract and whatever may be the terms transferred therefrom to the regional employment contracts, the various scenarios posed by counsel to him in cross-examination could never arise:- that one of the two subsidiaries or only the defendant, would downgrade the plaintiff’s position, terminate his services, renew his contract or otherwise act unilaterally; that could/would never happen.  In reality, the defendant as the parent and the two subsidiaries would (indeed they must) act in tandem, on the plaintiff’s employment.  Further, all the duties of senior management staff were owed to the group namely the defendant, regardless of which subsidiary or subsidiaries actually signed a contract or contracts of employment with the individuals concerned.  The plaintiff was no stranger to such arrangements, whether for tax or other considerations.  In fact, the plaintiff had the same employment structure when he was with Jardines.  According to Terry, the plaintiff's employer in Jardines was not the parent company although he was uncertain which management company actually employed the plaintiff.  I further note that in an e-mail dated 28 September 2000 from Mark Horton (who succeeded Simon Tuxen as general counsel) to Dominic Siu which was carbon-copied to the plaintiff, it was stated (on the subject of BMS-BIL Service Agreement): BIL has no employees and all Sing based people are employed by BMS [BIC]. 89        I therefore disagree with the suggestion put by counsel for the plaintiff to Terry that the three-fold contract (as counsel described it) was a deliberate procedure employed by the defendant, with the principal contract remaining with the defendant.  Indeed, in his closing submissions (paras 302-305), the plaintiff alleged that the true motive behind the defendant's Defence and Counterclaim was its hope that the plaintiff would not have the financial resources to see the litigation through; the company attempted to dissuade him from his proceedings by such tactics as applying for security for costs (which it obtained). 90        I note however that the plaintiff's terms of employment were not peculiar to him; Terry's employment contracts were in similar terms.  Terry too had an employment contract with the defendant dated 1 October 1999 and, according to a letter to him dated 17 January 2000 from the defendant, he also had separate contracts with BIC and BSL (not produced in court).  Terry's employment was also terminated as at 31 March 2002, by a letter dated 1 February 2002 (signed by Simon Tuxen) and his severance pay (US$180,000) was borne equally by BIC and BSL.  Other senior management staff including John Green (chief operating officer), Richard Reid (general manager), Dominic Siu (the plaintiff's deputy) and Simon Tuxen (general counsel) also had similar contracts.  Consequently, there is nothing unusual or sinister about the plaintiff's contract(s) of employment which bear special scrutiny or interpretation different from the others, save that the plaintiff's contract was for five (5) years' validity as against three (3) years for all the rest.  Above all, it was the plaintiff who set up the dual contracts structure with the assistance of PWC. 91        I turn next to Terry's testimony on the defendant's allegations against the plaintiff.  He learnt of the breaches of the ACIL and NAB covenants and the acquisition cost of Kaluakoi, after he had left the defendant's services; he had effectively handed over to Arun Amarsi on or about 9 March 2002.  Prior thereto, Terry was told of the under-provisions in the defendant's consolidated accounts for bonus and audit/accounting fees; he opined that the defendant's board was misled by the consequential increase in the defendant's profitability as reflected  in the accounts.  Until discovery by the defendant of the shortcomings in the plaintiff’s performance as CFO, Terry testified that the defendant's only reservation was not wanting to pay the plaintiff his full entitlement as severance pay; Quek was willing to pay 12 months' salary in lieu instead.  He disagreed that the defendant's subsequent attempts to find fault with the plaintiff was an excuse not to pay the plaintiff his due. 92        It was pointed out by counsel that the defendant did not allege that the plaintiff was negligent with regards to breach of the ACIL/BIL covenants.  Terry did not disagree that a CEO or CFO was entitled to rely on competent and experienced subordinates.  However, Joe (on whom the plaintiff claimed he reposed absolute faith) was newly appointed, in fact well after the covenants were entered into.  Even so, Terry contended that if the issue involved was fundamental to the discharge of a person's duties (as was the case here) and not a minor infraction, then the person was negligent. Terry added (V/N 1038) that he was aware most chief financial officers (apparently the plaintiff too) carried in their pockets a plasticised version of (negative) covenants to remind them, it was a crucial task of the CFO in any company.  Indeed, until just before the breaches occurred, the defendant had one staff member whose sole job was to monitor the covenants.  When Low was cross-examined on this issue (V/N1462), he too said he had summaries keyed into his laptop and placed on his table, of the major covenants of all the facilities the group had, to ensure compliance. 93        In his affidavit evidence (para 45), Terry pointed out that BDW did not advise the defendant to effect the payment (of the sale proceeds of James Hardie and Findel PLC) by way of a dividendirrespective of the consequences(my emphasis).  Had he known of the breach of the two covenants at the time, Terry said he would not have recommended that the plaintiff be paid 50% (later reduced to 40%) of the plaintiff's annual salary as bonus for year 2001, which the plaintiff had relied on as a reflection of how highly the defendant regarded his abilities. 94        When he found out about the breaches (after leaving the group), Terry said he was shocked and deeply disappointed.  Had he known at the material time, Terry said he would have felt obliged to offer his resignation as CEO to the defendant, on the basis that the buck stops with the CEO for any major failure by the staff.  He had recruited the plaintiff and what happened was a major management mistake for which he was ultimately responsible. 95        Similarly, Terry found out after the inaccuracy of the accounts after he left the defendant's employment.  The plaintiff did inform the BSBM committee on 7 February 2002 that the accounts could be inaccurate and Terry only became aware there was a dispute over the figures about a month later. 96        As for the purchase of Kaluakoi, Terry recalled attending a meeting (on 1 February 2002) where Riley made a presentation which covered the expenditure that had been incurred and which would be incurred in future, should the defendant wish to continue with the development.  By then, the defendant's board had already decided (on his recommendation) that no further monies would be spent over and above US$10m; it would look for a partner to put in the infrastructure, restore the golf course etc.  Because Molokai had a long coastline, Terry explained that it was not the defendant's intention to build houses on Kaluakoi (and the Alpha property) but to sell 250 oceanfront lots at about US$1m per lot, he having personally viewed the site; US$10m was therefore a good price to pay for the property.  If the defendant secured the development through a partner especially for the golf course, the book value of US$160m for the property would be enhanced and would be covered by the development. 97        Counsel for the plaintiff sought to show that because the previous owner of Kaluakoi would not allow access for due diligence to be conducted before the sale to MRL, there were high risks involved for the defendant, one example being MRL's management had virtually no knowledge of the state of the existing hotel on the property, which was dilapidated.  Counsel referred to a feasibility report prepared at Terry's request by one Martin Darveniza (of Tabua Investment who was also the CEO of the defendant's Fiji operation).  Terry pointed out that the management of MRL was not concerned about the state of the hotel (which had already been closed for some time) as it was never the defendant's intention to restore the hotel for use. The defendant was fully aware that the company/MRL must purchase Kaluakoi in order to preserve/enhance the value of the adjacent Alpha property but, it was only prepared to pay US$10m and no more for the acquisition.  The defendant was not concerned about actual holding or running costs after the acquisition; additional (discretionary) spending by way of improvements and upgrading were also a different consideration altogether.  What the defendant did not want to do but eventually was compelled to, was to pay more (by 50%) than what was intended, to acquire Kaluakoi itself. The issues 98        Having reviewed the evidence, I set out the issues which require the court's determination:- (i)         who was the plaintiff's employer for purposes of his claim for severance payments?  Was it the defendant (as he contended) or BSL (as the defendant contended) or both? (ii)         did the plaintiff still owe duties as an employee under the principal employment contract (notwithstanding his dual contracts of employment with BIC and BSL) such that the defendant could maintain its Counterclaim against him? (iii)       if the plaintiff did owe duties to the defendant under the principal employment contract, did he breach the duties alleged in the Counterclaim? (iv)        if indeed the plaintiff committed the breaches, can the defendant rely on the same retrospectively so as to deny the plaintiff his severance payments? (i) Who was the plaintiff's employee for purposes of his claim? 99        It is clear from the documents that the severance payments under the principal employment contract were transferred to the plaintiff's regional employment contract with BSL. BSL's letter dated 1 February 2000 (para 17supra) to the plaintiff stated:- The termination provisions set out in the employment contract dated 28 October 1999 made between you and Brierley Investments Limited (\"Principal Employmen Contract \" and \"BIL\") shall apply to your employment by the Company [BSL] as evidenced by this letter. Consequently, the plaintiff is precluded from making his claim for severance payments (which form part of the termination provisions in the principal employment contract) against the defendant.   In this regard, I reject the plaintiff's submissions (paras 132-137) that the plaintiff's true employer continued to be the defendant, as well as the concept of 'the common employer doctrine' (the defendant's description) prescribed by Canadian cases, which has yet to be imported into our law. Even if I accept that doctrine, there was no ambiguity as to warrant its application in this case; it was clearly spelt out in the above extract from the letter dated 1 February 2000 that, the termination provisions in the principal employment contract would apply.  It would be absurd to interpret the wordsshall applyto mean (according to the plaintiff's submissions para 131) that the severance payment obligations werenot taken outof the principal employment contract but would (equally) apply to the regional employment contract with BSL.  Does that mean both the defendant and BSL were liable for the severance payments to the plaintiff?  In any event, that was not his pleaded case; he only sued the defendant. 100      The plaintiff had used the excuse that BSL (as well as BIC) was aworthless entityin order to sue the defendant; nothing could be further from the truth. While BSL is indeed registered in the British Virgin Islands and has a postal address there, the defendant is also a foreign company (registered in the Bahamas) and it equally does not have a presence in Singapore.  Although he alleged BSL was worthless, the plaintiff had happily accepted payment of half his annual salary (and other benefits) from this subsidiary without question, until his services were terminated.  By having BSL as one of his two (2) employers, the plaintiff made substantial Singapore tax savings (see para 26supra).  He was also no stranger to the dual contracts system, as he had the same arrangement when he was with Jardines in Hong Kong.  Indeed, he was responsible for its set-up by PWC.  Consequently, I accept the defendant’s submission (para 156) that, having chosen to adopt and to benefit from, the dual contracts, it lies ill in the plaintiff’s mouth to say that the benefits had not migrated and that the subsidiaries were not his employers.  I further believe the defendant's accusation to be well founded¾the plaintiff sued the defendant because it has deep pockets. (ii) did the plaintiff still owe duties to the defendant under the principal employment contract, notwithstanding not being liable to him for severance payments? 101      One must look again at the documents to answer the second issue.  I have earlier set out (in para 11supra) the relevant paragraph in the defendant's letter dated 1 February 2001 relied upon for the Counterclaim. 102      Further, Terry’s testimony in this connection is relevant.  He had explained that hiring, firing and fixing remuneration (including bonus) were the purview of the defendant whilst payments were disbursed by the subsidiaries which contractually employed the staff in question.  Earlier, I had also pointed to the unlikelihood of the defendant, BIC and BSL acting unilaterally.  The truth of the matter is that both subsidiaries employed the plaintiff as the defendant’s CFO.  Reading the defendant’s letter dated 1 February 2001 in its context, I am persuaded by the defendant's arguments; I agree that the plaintiff owed the defendant residual duties, notwithstanding his having signed the regional employment contracts with BIC and BSL.  Those duties however did not include fiduciary duties, as he was never appointed a director of the defendant. (iii)       if the plaintiff did owe duties to the defendant under the principal employment contract, did he breach the duties as alleged in the Counterclaim? 103      The defendant's closing submissions criticised the plaintiff's conduct (and testimony)in extenso.  I turn now to consider whether such criticism is (i) justified and (ii) affords a defence to the plaintiff's claim as well as a basis for the Counterclaim.  I do not quarrel with the defendant's submission that there is no fixed rule of law defining the degree of misconduct which justifies dismissal.  It is a question of fact in each case, depending on the circumstances, whether the conduct in question is of sufficient gravity as to warrant/justify dismissal. (i) breach of the NAB and ACIL covenants 104      As I had observed earlier,  the material evidence of the much maligned (by the plaintiff) Joe was not before the court.  Can the plaintiff (as he contended) be exonerated from blame for overlooking the two (2) covenants, merely because he had appointed an experienced and competent accountant in the person of Joe as CFO for the Australian operations?  I think not. As the group CFO, the plaintiff was answerable for the failings of those below him.  It bears mentioning that the plaintiff was handsomely paid (in terms of remuneration, bonus and benefits) by the group in the previous year; such income comes with a high degree of responsibility.  If indeed the plaintiff carried on his person (according to Terry) condensed versions of major covenants which the defendant/group needed to observe, it was inexcusable for him to have overlooked the undertakings by ACIL and the defendant to NAB, to maintain their assets above certain levels.  The fact (according to the plaintiff) that the accountants/auditors (KPMG) and Joe (who signed the consolidated accounts of ACIL as at 30 June 2001) were not alerted by the accounts that the assets of ACIL and the defendant had fallen below the thresholds of A$500m and NZ$3 billion respectively, is not a valid defence to the defendant's complaintagainst him. 105      As the defendant's CFO, the plaintiff (by his own admission) was primarily responsible for tax matters for the entire group; all other CFOs within the group reported to him – hence, his task was non-delegable.  Indeed his job description (see para 10supra) in Appendix A (i) of the principal employment contract said as much..  The plaintiff is a chartered accountant with international experience, who had joined the defendant after working with and being headhunted from, another well-known group of companies (Jardines).  Of all those in the team who contributed towards the decision to repatriate A$394.3m from Australia, the plaintiff was the one who should have been most alert to the financial implications involved.  The plaintiff had blamed BDW for the resultant breaches of covenants.  Lanigan of BDW had rebutted his allegation by pointing out that the brief to her firm was only to advise on specific corporate issues and Australian taxation, not on payment of a dividend to ACIL's shareholders.  She had also emphasised that ACIL need not pay a dividend of A$624m in order to repatriate A$394m to Ma Sing.  It was only necessary for ACIL to pay a maximum dividend of A$97.3m up the corporate chain to facilitate the dividend payment of A$143m by BILA free of withholding tax, to Ma Sing.  The plaintiff claimed (which I disbelieve) that he was unaware of this fact.  Although he said he challenged this case (when put to him by counsel for the defendant), the plaintiff did not put forward any other alternatives.  I am mindful of the plaintiff's rebuttal of Lanigan's testimony (paras 173-179 of his submissions), that she was only referring to the issue of withholding tax; it was pointed out that the defendant would have faced a tax bill of A$10m per annum had the repatriation been done any other way.  I agree with the defendant that what is in issue here isnotthe most tax efficient method (as his legal expert Tim Nielson opined) to repatriate funds permanently from Australia but, whether inchoosing the method he did, the plaintiff exposed ACIL, Weeks and ultimately the defendant, to severe financial consequences by triggering breaches of the ACIL and BIL covenants. 106      It bears noting that if indeed (as he claimed) he had read Lanigan's report, the plaintiff would have been reminded of the ACIL covenant from the following paragraph (see AB5743 vol 15):- The ACIL sub-group is required to maintain net tangible assets of at least A$500m under the terms of the National Australia Bank letter of credit relating to the Bass Strait Oil Trust (BSOT).  As the only investments of value remaining in the ACIL group are bank deposits of around $55m and the BSOT, Wotif.com Pty Limited and English Welsh & Scottish Railways investments, which are collectively valued in the accounts at less than A$500m (although the BSOT assets are likely to be worth more than book value), this covenant can only be satisfied by maintaining a level of intra-group advances made by the ACIL group to the BIL group.  This therefore limits the profits which may bedistributed by way of dividend from the ACIL group, and accordingly the distributions able to be made up the corporate chain to fund dividends/capital returns to Ma Sing. Yet he did nothing.  I would add that it is not the function of lawyers to work out figures for accountants, be it for tax or other considerations.  It is no excuse to say it was the defendant which drew NAB's attention to the breach of the BIL covenant and, that the covenant had been breached in previous years.  It was the breach of the ACIL covenant which prompted NAB to issue the Notice of Declaration dated 7 May 2002 to ACIL and Weeks.  I am of the view that the plaintiff was grossly negligent in not picking up the breaches; he did not live up to the responsibilities expected of a group CFO of the defendant's stature. (ii) purchase by MRL of Kaluakoi for US$15.5m instead of US$10m 107      As in the case of the BIL and ACIL covenants, a material witness (Riley) did not testify.  It was common ground that Riley was MRL's/the defendant's appointee to negotiate the sale from Kaluakoi's Japanese owners; he was given a mandate to secure the property at US$10m.  As Riley was tasked with that responsibility, he not the plaintiff, should have alerted the defendant/MRL to the fact thatin additionto the agreed purchase price of US$10m, the property came to them saddled with actual (not contingent) liabilities of another US$5.5m.  It would be unfair to pin the blame for Riley's omission entirely on the plaintiff, merely because he was a director of MRL at the material time and, had attended  board meetings where DOH compliance requirements were mentioned.  Granted, the plaintiff should have been more alert and attentive at discussions where the cost of DOH compliance was raised, especially at the meeting of MRL's board held on 16 November  2001.  However, such matters were or should be, the main responsibility of the officers of MRL (including Whiting) who were involved in or privy to, the negotiations leading to the signing of the sale and purchase agreement dated 28 November 2001.  Even if the plaintiff failed to mention the sum of US$5.5m to the defendant's board of directors, the fact remains that Riley was in direct communication with the chairman and should have informed Quek that the cost of DOH compliance would increase the acquisition cost of Kaluakoi to US$15.5m. (iii)  removal of bonus provision from the accounts of BIL Australia 108      There is little doubt in my mind that the plaintiff's deliberate act in putting the bonus provision (US$1.2m) and thereby concealing it, in a suspense account, was in order that he would not look 'bad' in the eyes of the defendant's board, (because it would affect his profit forecast of US$5.5m) so as not to jeopardise his self interests namely, a share of that bonus.  The plaintiff's claim that putting the item in a suspense account was proper accounting treatment was discredited as:- (i) the defendant never maintained a suspense account; (ii) his expert (Kaka Singh) did not support his stand when cross-examined. I find that the plaintiff's action fell short of that expected of an accountant; indeed it was unprofessional. (iv) under-provision for audit fees 109      The comments which I made with regards to the bonus provision would equally apply to the plaintiff's concealment of the audit fee under-provision,  which act again was motivated by his desire not to be out of line with his profit forecast The expert testimony 110      I need to address the evidence adduced from the experts as well as the key witnesses, before I move on to consider the final issue. 111      Kaka Singh's report addressed the issue of strengthening the internal controls in the defendant's organisation, which is not really relevant to the plaintiff's case or the Counterclaim.  He (PW4) supported KPMG's recommendations that reporting functions within the group should be segregated and the treasury functions separated.  Whilst I agree with Kaka Singh's conclusion that in terms of the size of the defendant as a group, an inaccurate  profit forecast of US$5.5m is immaterial and would not have any significant impact on the group's accounts as a whole, that statement with respect, cannot be right nor accepted, when the same included an expense of more than $1m, which amounts to 20% of $5.5m.  On whether the shortfall in provision of US$841,000 for bonus and U$400,000 for audit/accounting fees should have been put into a suspense account, Kaka Singh had agreed these were (undisputed) expenses which should accordingly not be put into a suspense account, bearing in mind the industry practice of using suspense accounts.  In that regard, there is no divergence of views between him and the defendant's expert Chan. 112      The defendant's (Chan’s) expert testimony was more in point — was the plaintiff's treatment of the bonus provision and additional provision for audit/accounting fee (whatever the amounts) as suspense account items acceptable in the context in which they were transferred; his clear answer was in the negative; I agree with and accept Chan's testimony. 113      Tim Nielson (Nielson), a partner in the Australian firm of Freehills had, in his report dated 3 January 2003 stated that his brief from the plaintiff wasto advise whether the payment of dividends and returning share capital of BIL Australia Pty Ltd (BILA) [in the manner described in his report] was the most efficient method for Australian tax purposes of permanently repatriating funds out of Australia to the rest of the BIL group for use in repaying debt.  Nielson concluded that The repatriation of funds using the method proposed by BDW enabled permanent return of funds to Ma Sing without incurring any Australian tax liabilities……… …….Accordingly, the method chosen by BILA represented the most tax effective method of permanently repatriating funds from BILA back to Ma Sing. With respect, that is not the nub of the issue before this court as I pointed out in para 105 above.  It was Terry's testimony that BDW did not advise the defendant (in Lanigan's report) to effect payment of the sale proceeds of James Hardie and Findel PLC, by way of a dividend regardless of theconsequences.All financial implicationsnot only tax efficiency, should have been taken into account, which the plaintiff did not. 114      The defendant's legal expert was Stephen Barrie Flynn (Flynn) whose attendance in court was dispensed with by the plaintiff's counsel (V/N 1202).  Flynn, a New  Zealand barrister and solicitor, touched on breach of the BIL covenant.  He had acted for the defendant and some of its subsidiaries previously.  Flynn learnt of the breach of this covenant from Simon Tuxen in June 2002.  He was asked to and did, assist the defendant/BDW in their negotiations to resolve the matter with NAB.  Basically, Flynn corroborated Low's testimony on the negotiations and the terms of settlement reached, between the defendant, ACIL and NAB. The witnesses 115      There were three (3) key witnesses of fact before the court, namely the plaintiff, Terry and Low.  I had earlier (para 103) alluded to the defendant's criticism of the plaintiff who was alleged (para 149 in the defendant's submissions) to have given evidence which bordered on dishonesty.  While that may be too harsh a condemnation of the plaintiff, I am of the view that the plaintiff's conduct in the stand did not help his case at all.  He lacked candour, was often times evasive in answering questions when cross-examined and, had the tendency to blame everyone else but not himself, as the cause for the defendant's complaints in the Counterclaim. 116      One criticism by the defendant of the plaintiff which I agree with, was his selective reference to and emphasis (in para 8 of his statement of claim) on the words in bold print in the following paras 3 and 4 in the regional employment contracts, but omitting the underlined words:- These regional employment contracts are intended to be an extension  of your principal employment contract and they do notreplace or supercede your principal employment contract,save as provided in the following paragraph. Except to the extent that any of the provisions of the principal employment contract have been incorporated in the regional employment contracts (whether separately or read together) or specifically varied therein,the provisions of the principal employment contract shall continue to applyas between you and the company. The plaintiff's explanation (V/N 101) that he thought (only) the bold printed words were relevant was unconvincing; his omission of the underlined words was deliberate – he well knew those words would not sustain his claim against the defendant.   My view is reinforced by the fact that until the defendant amended its defence (on 16 December 2002), the plaintiff made no reference to the regional employment contracts (and to the attendant OHQ issue) in his numerous affidavits filed for the purposes of summary judgment and, to oppose the defendant's application to amend the defence. 117      Terry and Low were the defendant's main witnesses. Unlike the plaintiff, neither of them sought to excuse themselves from their responsibilities.  Low's testimony was at times disjointed but I have no doubt he spoke the truth.   He was decent enough to admit his mistake and or the mistakes (see para 67supra) made by his subordinates when confronted. 118      Had Terry still been employed by the defendant when the plaintiff's various misdeeds were discovered, he said he would have offered to resign (para 94supra) which action I consider the mark of a true CEO who would/should accept responsibilities for the mistakes or misdeeds made by his subordinates, particularly someone whom he had personally appointed. (iv)       if the plaintiff did owe the defendant the duties they alleged, could the company rely on his breaches of the same to deny him his severance payments? 119      I had found that the defendant's allegations in the Counterclaim (save on the Kaluakoi issue) were made out.  However, before giving my decision, I need to address the last issue and the submissions made by the parties.  The defendant argued that the company and BSL could rely on the breaches after they had terminated the plaintiff’s employment ‘without cause’, citingBoston Deep Sea Fishing & Ice Company v Ansell(1889) 39 Ch 339.  The plaintiff’s counsel on the other hand, submitted that the case was distinguishable.  It would be useful to look at the facts of the case to determine whose view is correct. 120      In that case, the promoter of the plaintiff company agreed with the defendant that he should be employed as managing director of the intended company for five (5) years at a yearly salary.  This was provided for in the articles of association which also stated that the defendant’s yearly salary was payable quarterly.  Afterwards, the company by a written instrument adopted the agreement between the promoter and the defendant.  The defendant, on behalf of the company, contracted for the construction of certain fishing smacks and, unknown to the company, took a commission from the shipbuilders on the contract.  Several months later, the company passed a resolution to dismiss the defendant at an extraordinary meeting, on the ground of other alleged acts of misconduct, which they were not able to substantiate in the action; being at that time ignorant of his receipt of the commission from the shipbuilders.  The defendant was a shareholder in an ice company and a fish-carrying company, which paid, in addition to the ordinary dividends, bonuses to shareholders who were owners of fishing smacks and who employed the companies in supplying ice and in carrying for them.  The defendant employed these companies in respect of the plaintiff’s smacks, and received bonuses as if the smacks were his own.  The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for an account of commissions and bonuses received by him, and for damages for alleged breaches of duty; the defendant counterclaimed for wrongful dismissal and for the salary for the quarter that had expired before his dismissal. 121      The Court of Appeal (reversing the decision of Kekewich J) held that:- (i)         the receipt of a commission from the shipbuilding company was good ground for dismissal, although it was not discovered till after the dismissal had taken place and although it happened several months previously, and might have been an isolated act; (ii)         the defendant must account to the plaintiff for the bonuses received from the ice and fish-carrying companies, as they had been paid in respect of the plaintiff’s smacks, although the plaintiff could not themselves have received the bonuses, not being shareholders of the company; (iii)        the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant was contained in the agreement between the promoter and the defendant as adopted by the company and was not modified by the articles of association. Consequently, the defendant’s salary was payable yearly and not quarterly.  As the defendant had been dismissed for misconduct, he was not entitled to any part of the unpaid salary for the current year of his services. 122      In the closing submissions tendered for the plaintiff, counsel pointed out thatDeep Sea Fishingwas a case involving wrongful dismissal, whereas the plaintiff’s employment was lawfully terminated on 31 March 2002, pursuant to his contract.  Granted,it is an accepted principle of employment law that the apparently wrongful dismissal of an employee can be justified if it is subsequently discovered that that employee had conducted himself in such a way as to make him liable to be dismissed even though the misconduct was not known at the time of the actual dismissal(per Prakash J inGoh Kim Hai Eddie v Pacific Can Investment Holdings Ltd[1996] 2 SLR 109 at p 116).  That well established principle of law however, has no application to this case. 123      The plaintiff submitted that the rights of the parties had crystallised on 31 March 2002 when the plaintiff's employment was terminated under cl 5.2 of the principal employment contract; the defendant/BSL/BIC did not summarily dismiss the plaintiff under cl 5.3 thereof.  The defendant and the two (2) subsidiaries did not purport to terminate the contract for causeeven afterthe contract ended, although they had ample opportunity to do so during the notice period.  The plaintiff pointed out that the US$5.5m liabilities on Kaluakoi were known by November/December 2001 and the defendant’s board knew by 1 February 2002.  The accounting provisions put into the suspense account were discovered in early March 2002, so too was the breach of the BIL covenant.  I agree with the plaintiff’s submission; the defendant could have notified the plaintiff during the notice period if not earlier, that he would not be given his severance entitlement and the reasons therefor. 124      The defendant relied on another case in the same vein asDeep Sea Fishingin its closing submissions, namelyHorcal Ltd v Gatland[1983] BCLC 60.  There, the defendant was the managing-director of the plaintiff building contractors.   In June 1978, a Mrs K telephoned the defendant and requested an estimate for work on her home which he agreed to carry out on the plaintiff's behalf.  The defendant subsequently appropriated this contract for his own benefit and, although he intended to pay all the expenses of the work himself, this was not done and some of the expenses were billed to the plaintiff.  At the time he decided to take the benefit of the contract, the defendant was negotiating to purchase the shares in the plaintiff but this transaction fell through.  He then entered into an agreement to terminate his contract of service with the plaintiff with effect from 31 October 1978, in return for payment of £5,000 by way of compensation.  The defendant received payment from Mrs K sometime after 24 July 1978 but before he received the £5,000 compensation from the plaintiff.  The company brought an action to recover the £5,000 compensation on the grounds that the agreement under which it was paid was void, because of the defendant's failure to disclose his breach of fiduciary duty as a director, in appropriating the benefit of the contract with Mrs K.  Glidewell J held that the defendant, not having received any payment from Mrs K when he entered into the agreement with the plaintiff on 24 July 1978, was not in breach of his fiduciary duty and there being nothing to disclose, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the £5,000.  However, the payment of the defendant's salary after 24 July 1978 was made at a time when the company could have dismissed him and accordingly this was recoverable. 125      The plaintiff appealed with respect to its claim on £5,000 whilst the defendant cross-appealed with respect to the order to repay his last month's salary.  The Court of Appeal (reported at [1984] BCLC 549) dismissed the plaintiff's appeal and allowed the cross-appeal.  The Court held that when the agreement of 24 July 1978 was entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant, the defendant although he may have intended to breach his duty in the future, had not received payment under the contract from Mrs K and so was not at that time in breach of his duty to the plaintiff.  Therefore, there was no basis on which the contract could be vitiated and the £5,000 was accordingly not recoverable by the company.  As regards the cross-appeal, although the plaintiff could have terminated the defendant's contract of service, it did not do so and the defendant accordingly was paid his salary pursuant to a binding contract for work done and therefore it was not recoverable. 126      The defendant submitted that the case stood for the proposition that an employee who is a fiduciary is obliged to disclose his breaches and if he suppresses his breaches before the contract is terminated, the employer can later rely on that breach of the employee’s fiduciary duty to reject liability.  True, but the court (Goff LJ at p 555) also added:- ……There was a binding contract for the termination of the plaintiff's services.  After the making of that contract there was an undoubted breach of duty committed by the defendant in that he received the cash paid by Mrs Kingbury in respect of the work done by the plaintiff company on her house, and he did not account for that cash to the plaintiff company; furthermore he concealed the existence of the contract with Mrs Kingbury from the plaintiff.  There can be no doubt that that was a breach, and a serious breach, of the defendant's contract of service with the plaintiff company and had the plaintiff company become aware of it at the time they would have been entitled then and there to terminate the contract between them and the defendant under which he was continuing to serve the plaintiff as managing-director.  But they did not become aware of the defendant's misdoings at that timeThe defendant's contract of service was worked out in the ordinary way.  He continued to serve as managing-director up to 31 October, and he received his salary in respect of that period of his service(emphasis mine). In those circumstances I myself can see no ground upon which the plaintiff can recover the salary cheque which they paid him.  It was paid under a binding contract. 127      The defendant in para 404 of its closing submissions added: ……..If one party repudiates a contract and is sued by the other, the first party can rely in his defence on a reason not known, but in existence at the time of repudiation.  The question is whether the defendant repudiated the contract.  On the plaintiff’s own case, the defendant did so.  The plaintiff claims that his employment was terminated without his benefits being paid to him.  He claims that he is entitled as a matter of contract to those benefits.  If he is right, then by not paying, the defendant repudiated its obligations. The plaintiff (paras 38-45 of his submissions) however pointed out that the above argument was disingenuous as: (i)         repudiation was not pleaded by the defendant; (ii)        the plaintiff was not suing for repudiation or wrongful dismissal and (iii)        no contract subsisted to be repudiated. 128      In para 402 of the defendant's submissions, the following extract from Chitty on Contracts (28thed Vol.1 para 25-013 p 1229) was relied on:- The general rule is well established that, if a party refuses to perform a contract, giving therefor a wrong or inadequate reason or no reason at all, he may yet justify his refusal if there were at the time facts in existence which would have provided a good reason, even if he did not know of them at the time of his refusal. I cannot seen how the above passage assists the defendant's case at all; there was no refusal to perform on the part of either party when the plaintiff's employment was terminated.  Consequently, the defendant's reliance on the caseUniversal Cargo Carriers Corporation v Citati[1957] 2 QB 401, a case involving breach/wrongful repudiation of a charterparty, is misconceived.  This is apparent from the following passage of Devin J's judgment (p 443) emphasised by the defendant: ……It is now well settled that a rescission or repudiation, if given for a wrong reason or for no reason at all, can be supported if there are at the time facts in existence which would have provided a good reason 129      It would appear from the authorities referred to above, that the defendant cannot rely retrospectively on the plaintiff's misconduct as a defence to his prior claim for severance payments, which debt (the plaintiff submitted) arose earlier; the ex-post facto reasoning by the defendant that it had subsequently repudiated the contract by not paying, is untenable. Conclusion 130      Consequently, I am dismissing the plaintiff's claim for severance payments of $2,125,000 ($62,500 salary x 34 months) as he has sued the wrong party; his claim for bonus is also dismissed as, it is established case-law (Latham v Credit Suisse First Boston[2002] 2 SLR 693) that where bonus payment is stated to be discretionary (as in cl 2.3(ii) of the principal employment contract), an employee is not entitled to it as of right. 131      I am also rejecting the defendant's counterclaim as the plaintiff's services had been lawfully terminated without cause under cl 5.2 of the principal employment contract; he was not dismissed under cl 5.3. 132      As both the claim and counterclaim are dismissed, it would make sense for each party to bears its own costs in these proceedings; the hearing fees shall also be borne by the parties equally.  The security for costs furnished by the plaintiff shall be returned to the plaintiff's solicitors."
