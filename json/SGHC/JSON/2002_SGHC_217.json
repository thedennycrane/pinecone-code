        "Petition for revision": "17        In this petition for\n\ncriminal revision, the petitioner raised two issues:-(1)        that the trial judge had erred in law in\n\n    holding that s 409 of the Penal Code was the correct charge in the circumstances; and(2)        that the trial judge had made numerous\n\n    errors in her findings of fact.Error of law18        The petitioner, relying on\n\nthe case ofGopalakrishnam Vanitha v PP(1999) 4 SLR 307,argued that being\n\nentrusted with the doing of a job was not the same thing as being entrusted with property.\n\nHe thus argued that the situation of an advocate and solicitor being entrusted with the\n\njob of recovering monies on behalf of a client did not fall within the scope of s 409 of\n\nthe Penal Code as there was no entrustment of property.19        I found no substance in\n\nsuch an argument.Gopalakrishnamcouldbe easily distinguished as the facts\n\nthere involved a confidential secretary cum office administrator who was not entrusted\n\nwith the funds of the company.20        The position was clearly\n\ndifferent here. An advocate and solicitor will in the nature of his work regularly receive\n\nsums of money on behalf of his clients. They have access to and control of these monies\n\nand this is highlighted by the legal requirement of having to deposit such monies received\n\nin a ‘client account.’ It is this measure of access and control that the court\n\nwould look at in determining whether there has been entrustment.21        Thus advocates and\n\nsolicitors must be taken to have been entrusted with their client’s monies when they\n\nare entrusted with the task of collecting the monies on their client’s behalf. Hence\n\nthey would fall within the purview of s 409 of the Penal Code. This has been accepted\n\nalthough without being specifically mentioned by the Singapore Court of Appeal inRe\n\nRam Kishan(1992) 1 SLR 529and the Singapore High Court inWong Kai Chuen\n\nPhilip v PP(1990) SLR 1011.Errors in finding of fact22        In the alternative, the\n\npetitioner argued that the trial judge had misread the evidence so as to cause a serious\n\nmiscarriage of justice. In particular, he argued that the trial judge had erred in finding\n\nthat he had:(a) set out to conceal and cover his receipt of the $4,815.24 from\n\n    Eurofibre from Latiff; and(b) fabricated the bill of costs by claiming costs for advice not\n\n    rendered.23        I found these contentions\n\nwithout any merit as these findings were amply supported by the evidence adduced. However,\n\nfor the sake of completeness, I will examine both contentions in detail.Petitioner had set out to conceal and cover his receipt of $4,815.2424        The petitioner had,\n\nwithout any justifiable excuse, failed to inform Latiff, over a period of two months, that\n\nEurofibre had paid up the monies owed. From this, the most natural conclusion to draw that\n\nthe petitioner had deliberately set out to keep Latiff in the dark as to the payment by\n\nEurofibre.25        Furthermore, the\n\npetitioner had signed ‘Foo Chee Hock’, the name of the then deputy registrar of\n\nthe subordinate courts, on the writ that was faxed to Latiff. The petitioner explained\n\nthat he had done so to show Latiff that Foo Chee Hock was the Deputy Registrar and that\n\nFoo Chee Hock would have signed it if the writ had been filed. This absurd explanation was\n\nrightly rejected by the trial judge and it must be fair to conclude that the petitioner\n\nhad done so to deceive Latiff into thinking that the writ had already been filed to\n\nfurther conceal Eurofibre’s payment from Latiff.26        The trial judge was thus\n\neminently correct in finding that the petitioner had set out to cover and conceal his\n\nreceipt of the monies.Petitioner had fabricated the bill of costs27        The petitioner claimed\n\ncosts in relation to advice rendered to Latiff on four matters. They were firstly on his\n\nclaim against Eurofibre, secondly on his setting up a business in competition against\n\nEurofibre, thirdly on a security matter and lastly on Eurofibre’s claim against\n\nJunadei.28        It is undisputed that the\n\npetitioner had advised Latiff in his claim against Eurofibre. However the petitioner had\n\nin his bill of costs charged Latiff for costs up to the stage of summary judgment. The\n\npetitioner could not have been entitled to such costs because, at the time the bill was to\n\nbe sent out, Eurofibre had already paid up and the only costs that the petitioner would\n\npossibly be entitled to would be the already paid-up $700.29        As for the\n\npetitioner’s other claims, they were not supported by the evidence. Latiff denied\n\nreceiving any such advice as well as denying ever informing the petitioner that he was\n\nauthorised by Junadei to instruct him or instructing the petitioner to act for Junadei. As\n\nfor Junadei, he denied ever giving any authority either actual or ostensible to the\n\npetitioner to act for him and had in fact never met or even spoken to the petitioner.30        This fabrication on the\n\npart of the petitioner was clearly revealed by the transcript of the taped conversation.\n\nIn the transcript, the petitioner had openly admitted that ‘it’s a mock\n\nbill’ and that it ‘doesn’t reflect the true picture actually’ as\n\n‘its just to help me (the petitioner) only.’31        As such, the trial judge\n\nhad correctly found that the petitioner had fabricated the entire bill of costs and thus\n\nhad dishonestly misappropriated the monies from his client’s account.Petition for revision32        It is the duty of the\n\nappellate court to examine the evidence and come to an independent finding on each issue\n\nof fact. In comparison, the revisionary court should confine itself to errors of law or\n\nprocedure only and should deal with questions of evidence or finding of facts only in\n\nexceptional circumstances to prevent a miscarriage of justice.33        This was affirmed inAkalu\n\nAhir v Ramdeo RamAIR 1973 A 2145where Dua J, delivering the judgment of the\n\nSupreme Court, stated:The High Court has been invested with this power (of revision) to see\n\n    that justice is done in accordance with the recognized rules of criminal jurisprudence and\n\n    that the subordinate courts do not exceed their jurisdiction or abuse the power conferred\n\n    on them by law. As a general rule,this power, in spite of the wide language of (the\n\n    equivalent sections) Cr P C, does not contemplate interference with the conclusions of\n\n    fact in the absence of serious legal infirmity and failure of justice[Emphasis\n\n    added].34        This was similarly stated\n\nby the court inAng Poh Chuan v PP(1996) 1 SLR 326that:While there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute\n\n    such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide\n\n    discretion vested in the court, generally it must be shown that there issomething\n\n    palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power\n\n    by the court below. [Emphasis added]35        As such, having reviewed\n\nall the evidence, there was no reason to conclude that the trial judge had reached such a\n\npalpably wrong decision as to either law or fact as to constitute a serious injustice to\n\nthe petitioner. In fact, I should say that the trial judge had throughout the trial gone\n\nout of her way to accommodate the petitioner.Sentence36        I next turn to the\n\nsentence imposed by the trial judge. In dealing with a conviction under s 409 of the Penal\n\nCode, it must be noted that cases under s 409 of the Penal Code are more serious than\n\nsimple criminal breach of trust cases since under the situations envisioned by the\n\nprovision, the offender was ex hypothesi standing in a fiduciary type relationship with\n\nthe victim of the offence.37        This was highlighted by\n\nChan Sek Keong J (as he then was) inWong Kai Chuen Philip v PP(1990) SLR 1011that:criminal breach of trust by a lawyer in the discharge of his\n\n    professional dutymust inevitably call for a custodial sentence of a deterrent nature,\n\n    not so much as to deter the offender concerned but to deter other members of his\n\n    profession from committing similar offences. [Emphasis added]38        Furthermore, there were\n\nother aggravating factors present in this case. The petitioner had betrayed the trust\n\nplaced in him as an advocate and solicitor. He had then sought to conceal his receipt of\n\nmonies from his client and, when found out, had even concocted documents to justify his\n\nactions. As such, I was of the view that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.Conclusion39        Accordingly, the petition\n\nfor revision was dismissed and the sentence imposed was increased to thirty-six months.Petition for revision dismissedSgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeRepublic of SingaporeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
