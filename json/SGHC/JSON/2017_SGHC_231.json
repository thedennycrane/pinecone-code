        "The parties": "3 The first plaintiff, Ms Ng Siok Poh, was Mr Lim’s wife. The second plaintiff, Mr Lim Hong Liu, is one of Mr Lim’s sons. After Mr Lim passed away on 7 October 1987, the plaintiffs were appointed to administer his estate. The first plaintiff passed away after this action (“Suit 248”) was commenced. 4 The defendant is a Singapore-incorporated company and in the business of construction. The defendant is the developer of The Amery, a condominium which is located on the plot of land adjoining the Property.",
        "Background to the dispute": "5 Mr Lim, who worked in the construction industry, designed and built the Property in the 1970s as a family home. He had seven children with his wife; and the Property, which has seven bedrooms, reflects the size of the family (“the Lim family”). The Property was a labour of love for Mr Lim. Having purchased the land with his savings, Mr Lim built the Property over three years using carefully selected materials. Mr Lim’s children grew up in the Property. Clearly, the Property had great sentimental value to the Lim family. 6 In the 1990s, after Mr Lim’s death, two neighbours of the Lim family chose to sell their land to a developer and proposed that the Lim family similarly sell the Property for the parties to participate in a joint development of their land. However, the Lim family decided not to sell the Property. According to the second plaintiff, this was because the Property had “a special value to the Lim [f]amily that transcends any monetary value that one can ascribe to it”: it was constructed as the family home, and constitutes Mr Lim’s legacy to his family. The Lim family was keen to preserve Mr Lim’s legacy. 7 In 2007, property agents approached the Lim family to sell the Property. However, for similar reasons, the Lim family chose not to sell the Property. 8 In late 2008, the defendant began the construction works for The Amery. Thereafter, the defendant commenced excavation works for the construction of the basement carpark of The Amery. 9 In about late March 2009, the second plaintiff noticed that the Property had sustained damage: cracks had formed, tiles on the building apron had been forced out and the polyvinyl chloride grilles on the drains were bending and breaking. On 2 April 2009, he began to suspect that the Property was tilting when he observed that the metal main door grille was closing by itself. The tilting was also evident from ponding of water in the Property, and tests conducted using a marble ball which ran quickly in the direction of the tilt. 10 A joint inspection of the Property was conducted on 3 April 2009. Dr Yong Deung Ming (“Dr Yong”), a professional engineer engaged by the defendant, attended the inspection, and issued a letter to the defendant. In his letter, Dr Yong certified that, as of 3 April 2009, “there [was] no imminent sign of damage, distress, distortion or [danger]” to the Property and that the Property was “structurally sound and safe for its intended usage”. However, the second plaintiff took objection to this letter and began corresponding with the Building and Construction Authority (“the BCA”). Shortly thereafter, on 8 April 2009, two tiltmeters were installed on the Property. Measurements were taken of the tilt on 9 and 25 April 2009 (“the April 2009 Measurements”). The April 2009 Measurements were taken by optical survey, as opposed to measurements from the tiltmeters, and purported to be measurements of the absolute tilt of the Property (see [13] and [42] below). 11 On 15 April 2009, the BCA informed the second plaintiff that it had issued a Stop Work Order directing the defendant to cease excavation works while Dr Yong conducted a detailed assessment of the same. 12 On 15 May 2009, Dr Yong issued a report on the excavation works. He then issued a further report, on 25 June 2009, certifying that the Property was safe for residential usage, and a letter on 11 August 2009 certifying that the Property was “structurally sound and safe for its continued occupation”. As will be seen later, the accuracy of the April 2009 Measurements, which were reflected in Dr Yong’s reports in May and June 2009, turned out to be the source of much controversy in this case. 13 Following the issuance of these reports, various measurements were taken from the tiltmeters from March 2010 to July 2012. It is important to appreciate that these measurements did not assess the absolute tilt of the Property,ie, the tiltvis-à-visa vertical straight line (see further [42] below). They only measured how much more the Property tilted from 8 April 2009 onwards. Notably, by 8 April 2009, the Property had already tilted. The tiltmeter measurements did not account for this pre-existing tilt as of 8 April 2009. Rather, they used the state of the Property on 8 April 2009, which was assigned a notional tilt angle of 0.000, as a baseline, and measured the further tilt of the Property, after 8 April 2009, by reference to that baseline. Accordingly, these further measurements did not verify the accuracy of the April 2009 Measurements. They simply used the state of the Property on 8 April 2009 as a baseline from which to measure how much more the Property had tilted as opposed to exactly how much the Property had tilted from the start. 14 The construction works eventually resumed, and the Temporary Occupation Permit for The Amery was issued in November 2010. 15 On 27 July 2012, JIB Specialist Consultants Pte Ltd prepared a report (“the July 2012 Report”), which was checked and approved by Dr Yong, after a further inspection of the Property on 24 July 2012, to assess whether its state had deteriorated from July 2010 to the date of the inspection. In the July 2012 Report, Dr Yong stated that he “was satisfied that the structural condition of the building remained as stable as it was two years ago”. In other words, the Property was stable by July 2010. This conclusion was based in part on the readings taken by the two tiltmeters between March 2010 and July 2012 (see [13] above) assessing the situation against the state of the Property on 8 April 2009, which showed that the tilt had only worsened slightly from 2009 to 2010 before becoming stable after 2010. No measurements of absolute tilt (see [13] above and [42] below) were taken in July 2012. In other words, no measurements were taken to ascertain exactly how much the Property had tilted from the start. 16 As of the date of the proceedings before me, the Lim family continued to reside in the Property: the second plaintiff, two of his sisters, a brother, sister-in-law and niece, and two helpers occupied the Property. The Property remained registered in Mr Lim’s sole name.",
        "Procedural history": "17 On 4 March 2014, the plaintiffs commenced Suit 248 in their capacities as the administratrix and administrator of Mr Lim’s estate. Their case was that, in constructing The Amery, the defendant caused damage to the Property, including the tilting of the Property, and was therefore liable in tort for private nuisance and negligence. The plaintiffs claimed the costs of reinstating the Property to its original state and of alternative accommodation and transport expenses while reinstatement works were carried out; and, alternatively, the diminution in value of the Property. 18 On 14 August 2014, the plaintiffs obtained interlocutory judgment, by consent, with damages to be assessed and with “all issues relating to causation, damages, cost and interest … reserved”. 19 The first tranche of the assessment of damages hearing was convened on 3 to 5 November 2015. On 4 November 2015, I conducted a site visit to assess first-hand the extent of the problem caused by the tilt. 20 On 3 December 2015, shortly before written closing submissions were filed, the second plaintiff applied for leave to adduce further evidence of the current state of the tilt of the Property. Pertinently, during the first tranche of the hearing, the parties and their experts had proceeded on the basis that the Property had ceased to tilt since around 2010, in line with Dr Yong’s conclusion in the July 2012 Report. The parties had relied on tiltmeter readings in the July 2012 Report showing that the tilt had stabilised from 8 April 2009 to 24 July 2012 (see [15] above). However, the second plaintiff sought to reopen the evidence on the basis that this common assumption was incorrect: the tilt had in fact worsened since 2010. 21 On 4 April 2016, I granted the second plaintiff’s application. I ordered the parties to jointly engage an independent surveyor to measure the tilt, in line with a methodology to be agreed by the engineering experts, Mr Lim Kim Cheong (“Mr Lim KC”) for the plaintiffs and Assoc Prof Tan Siew Ann Harry (“Assoc Prof Tan”) for the defendant, and these measurements would bind the parties. I also ordered the said experts to file a joint report or individual reports based on the measurements, and granted the parties leave to cross-examine the experts. Thereafter, the parties’ engineering experts filed separate supplemental reports and the second tranche of the hearing was held on 20 February 2017.",
        "The parties’ submissions": "22 Interlocutory judgment was granted on the basis that issues of causation would be reserved to the assessment of damages (see [18] above). In a joint expert report dated 12 January 2015, the parties’ engineering experts agreed that “[t]he basement excavation of [The Amery] caused the damages and tilt to existing bungalow at [No] 30 Lorong K Telok Kurau”. The parties’ submissions on damages proceeded from this common ground. 23 The plaintiffs made the following submissions: (a) First, on the measure of damages, the plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to the reinstatement costs and abandoned their alternative claim (see [17] above) as to the diminution in value of the Property. The plaintiffs submitted that the appropriate measure of damages was the reinstatement costs because they had a genuine desire to reinstate the Property, and the reinstatement costs were not unreasonable,ie, not grossly disproportionate to the benefit of reinstatement. (b) Secondly, in terms of the mode of reinstatement, the plaintiffs initially suggested two types of reinstatement works. First, micro-pile underpinning works to lift up one end of the Property to remove the tilt and set the Property upright (“the Underpinning Method”). Secondly, aesthetic works to remove any sense that the Property suffered from a tilt (“the Aesthetics Method”). The plaintiffs also submitted that, if the court adopted the Aesthetics Method, they should be awarded damages for loss of amenity. In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs made clear that the Underpinning Method was their preferred option but did not abandon the Aesthetics Method. However, in their supplementary submissions filed after the end of the second tranche, for quite different reasons, the plaintiffs argued that the Underpinning Method was the only appropriate mode of reinstatement. I will address those reasons later. (c) Thirdly, the plaintiffs sought relocation and rental costs for the period in which the reinstatement works were to be carried out. 24 The defendant accepted that the proper measure of damages in cases of tortious damage to property was generally the cost of reinstatement. However, it contended that the costs of the Underpinning and Aesthetics Methods were “exorbitant” and “wholly unreasonable”. The defendant also argued that Mr Ho Ngon Fatt (“Mr Ho”), the plaintiffs’ expert who assessed the costs of rectifying the tilt under the Aesthetics Method, had acted on the instructions of the second plaintiff and was accordingly neither independent nor objective. I was invited not to place any weight on his report or testimony. Finally, the defendant submitted that the plaintiffs were only entitled to recover $47,600 to repair non-structural damages, with the Lim family having to live with the tilt for which a sum of $20,000 for loss of amenity was suggested as compensatory damages.",
        "The issues": "25 Four principal issues arose for determination: (a) First, what was the appropriate measure of damages: was it the reinstatement costs, or the diminution in value of the Property (“the First Issue”)? (b) Secondly, if the appropriate measure of damages was the reinstatement costs, should damages be awarded based on the Underpinning Method or the Aesthetics Method (“the Second Issue”); and, if so, what was the quantum of damages that should be awarded? (c) Thirdly, if it were appropriate to award damages based on the Aesthetics Method, were the plaintiffs also entitled to damages for loss of amenity (“the Third Issue”)? (d) Fourthly, was it apposite to award interest on the damages assessed, and what was the appropriate cost order (“the Fourth Issue”)? I will now address these issues in turn.",
        "The First Issue": "",
        "The law": "79 InSonny Yap(see [29(b)] above), Prakash J, relying onRuxley, awarded $50,000 to the plaintiffs for the loss of amenity consequent on the defendant’s breach of contract in constructing undersized bedrooms. The award was for “the inconvenience to be experienced from the shortfall over the years”: seeSonny Yapat [129]. In this case, both parties treatedRuxleyandSonny Yapas directly applicable though the actions there were not in tort but for breach of contract. 80 However, I was not convinced thatRuxleyis applicable to a claim for loss of amenity for a tort affecting land. The award for loss of amenity for breach of contract inRuxleyremains controversial, in particular because its theoretical basis is unclear. Lord Mustill rationalised the award as compensation for the “consumer surplus” inherent in transactions where “the value of the promise to the promisee exceeds the financial enhancement of his position which full performance will secure”: seeRuxleyat 360G–H. However, Lord Lloyd understood the award as “a logical application or adaptation” of the exception to the principle that one may not recover for displeasure or distress occasioned by breach of contract, which applies where the purpose of the contract was to afford pleasure: seeRuxleyat 374A–C. The position in Singapore is not much clearer: see the observations inThe Law of Contract in Singapore(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 21.094, where it is observed that “[i]t remains to be conclusively explained … whether the basis of [an award for] loss of amenity is the loss of the promisee’s “consumer surplus”, or the inconveniences that would be suffered as a result of the breach”. Thus, it would seem that the theoretical basis for an award of loss of amenity for breach of contract is not settled though I accept that such awards were made inSonny YapandTan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd[2005] 2 SLR(R) 302 (“Tan Chin Seng”) in reliance on Lord Mustill’s reasoning inRuxley.I should add that the Court of Appeal inRaffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Tan Chin Seng[2005] 4 SLR(R) 351 (“RTC”) set aside the award for loss of amenity inTan Chin Sengwithout commenting on the basis of the award. The question in my view remains open for consideration in an appropriate case. This is not such a case. 81 The exact rationale of the loss of amenity award inRuxleyis immaterial here. What is key is that it is not the same as an award for loss of amenity where the defendanthas committed a tort affecting land. (a) First, as a matter of authority, damages for loss of amenity have long been recoverable in torts affecting land such as private nuisance: they have thus been described “as part of the normal measure of damages”: seeMcGregorat para 37-019 andBurrowsat pp 333-335. The position has not been the same in contract, which is one reason why theRuxleyaward for loss of amenity remains controversial. (b) Secondly, as a matter of principle, both of the rationales stated inRuxleyfor the loss of amenity award are foreign to torts affecting land. The concept of consumer surplus, as stated by Lord Mustill, presupposes a contract between the parties. Lord Lloyd’s justification of the award is also rooted in principles of contract law. The basis of an award for loss of amenity in cases of torts affecting land cannot be the same. It is not difficult to discern the rationale for such awards. The purpose of torts affecting land is to protect the use and enjoyment of land. It is thus unsurprising that the remedies include damages for loss of amenity. Therefore, in my judgment, the relevant cases here are the authorities in tort and not those in contract. I thus turned to consider the authority in tort cited by the plaintiffs in support of their claim for loss of amenity. 82 InBryant v Macklin[2005] EWCA Civ 762 (“Bryant”), the defendants’ livestock damaged a row of trees on the plaintiffs’ property which had protected the land by providing a screening effect. The plaintiffs’ expert put forward three rectification proposals involving the replacement of the damaged trees. The proposals differed in cost and in the age and height of the replacement trees (and thus also in their ability to screen the plaintiffs’ land). Chadwick LJ (with whom the rest of the English Court of Appeal agreed) noted that the plaintiffs wished to continue occupying their property, and held that a reasonable person would pay for the most modest rectification proposal (at [26]). The plaintiffs were awarded damages on that basis. However, the court increased the award of general damages to reflect the loss of amenity which the plaintiffs would suffer. The basis for the award was that the new trees would not be able to provide the same screening effect as the original trees for years, until they had grown in height (at [27]).",
        "Application to the facts": "83 The plaintiffs argued that an award for loss of amenity was appropriate because “under the Aesthetics Method, the plaintiffs will forever live in fear that the Property may undergo further tilting in the future”. But, in my judgment, this was not borne out by the evidence. The second plaintiff did not depose to this fear: on the contrary, he accepted, “with some reluctance”, that he would adopt the Aesthetics Method if the court did not accept the Underpinning Method. The second plaintiff’s complaint was the sensation that the Property was tilting. Thus, he made the following statements in his affidavit: (a) “For more than 3 decades, my family lived in the Property without ever experiencing that sinking feeling or water ponding around the house”. (b) “[Prof Tan] has never inspected the house so he cannot possibly have an idea of the frustration of living in a house that tilts. It has to be experienced to be believed. That is what my family is undergoing”. Moreover, during the hearing, I expressly asked the second plaintiff whether the substance of his complaint was the fact of the tilt or the sensation of a tilt. He clarified that it was the latter. (Notably, though the second plaintiff deposed that living in a tilted house was bad forfengshui, he appeared to accept that the Aesthetics Method would address this.) In any event, any fear that the Property was unsafe had no foundation as I found that the tilting had ceased and the Property was structurally safe. 84 This leads to the key distinction between this case andBryant. InBryant, the rectification costs were assessed based on a rectification method that would not have addressed the loss of amenity suffered by the plaintiff,ie, the lack of screening effect provided by the new trees until they had grown in height. This necessitated a separate award for loss of amenity. However, in this case, the rectification costs were assessed based on the Aesthetics Method. The purpose of the Aesthetics Method was to eliminate any perception of the tilt. Thus, it directly addressed the loss of amenity suffered by the plaintiffs which pertained to the visual and sensational impairment caused by the tilt. 85 InRTCat [45], the Court of Appeal ruled that there would be no compensation for loss of amenity because “[o]therwise there will be double compensation”. Similarly, in my judgment, allowing a sum for loss of amenity here would have resulted in double recovery. I therefore did not award any damages for loss of amenity.",
        "The Second Issue": "",
        "Application of the Aesthetics Method": "65 Mr Ho performed “a cost estimate based on aesthetic alignment”,ie, he assessed the costs of works which he considered necessary to remove the sense that the Property had tilted. I was not persuaded by the defendant’s criticisms of Mr Ho’s evidence (see [24] above). In my judgment, the figures in the spreadsheets that Mr Ho placed before me as exhibits P1, P2 and P3 offered an adequate basis for assessing the appropriate quantum of damages based on the Aesthetics Method. As noted at [34] above, the defendant has not appealed against my decision. 66 I will first set out the general principles which I adopted in applying the Aesthetics Method, before discussing individual items by reference to P3. General principles 67 First, when I inspected the Property on 4 November 2015, I noticed the tilt in several parts of the Property, particularly in the living room. However, despite multiple attempts to perceive the tilt from outside the Property, I could not visualise or sense that the Property was tilting from outside. Thus, I was not inclined to allow items for works which sought to address the tilt, from an aesthetics perspective, when the Property was viewed from the outside. Notably, Mr Ho did not suggest that any issues would arise if an aesthetic adjustment of the interior was performed without adjusting the exterior. 68 Secondly, Mr Ho sought to reflect the cost of replacing existing materials and finishes in the house,eg, broken onyx floor and UK imported anti-slip mosaic (items 1.1 and 1.2 in P3), with the same or similar materials, where he assessed that such materials and finishes would be impacted by the works and would thus need to be replaced. I was persuaded that this was a fair approach and adopted the rates which Mr Ho proposed, which Mr Lee did not dispute. Individual items (1) Items which I allowed in entirety 69 I allowed items 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 3.1, 5.2, 8, 9 and 10 in entirety. After inspecting the Property, hearing the experts and reviewing the parties’ submissions, I found that these works were necessary to address the perception of a tilt and that Mr Ho’s rates were appropriate. As the defendant has not appealed against my decision, I shall say no more about these items. (2) Items which I allowed in part (A) Works for the bathrooms 70 Items 1.2, 1.5 and 1.7 principally concerned works for the bathrooms in the Property (floor tiles, wall tiles and waterproof ceiling). In his supplemental report, Mr Lee accepted that there were ponding issues in two bathrooms in the Property, but denied that there were such issues in two other toilets and at the kitchen floor on the first storey. Neither Mr Ho nor the plaintiffs carried out a building survey of the Property to determine whether all the bathrooms suffered from ponding problems. In the circumstances, I found that only two bathrooms needed to be rectified. 71 Mr Ho testified that all of the bathrooms were roughly of the same size, and that the cost of the items of work for two bathrooms could be determined, by a simple division and multiplication exercise, from the total cost of the items of works. In relation to items 1.2, 1.5 and 1.7, Mr Ho categorised the works into those for the first, second and third storeys of the Property. Notably, the works for the first storey included works for the kitchen. By contrast, the works for the second and third storeys only pertained to the bathrooms. I decided that it would be more appropriate to determine the cost of works for two bathrooms based on the figures for the second and third storeys, as these related to bathrooms alone, instead of the total cost of the items which would incorporate the cost of the works for the kitchen. There were six bathrooms on the second and third storeys. Therefore, I granted two-sixths (a third) of the cost of the works for the second and third storeys in items 1.2, 1.5 and 1.7,viz, $1416.00, $7533.33 and $424.80 respectively. 72 Item 7 concerned sanitary and plumbing works. For the reasons given in [71] above, I similarly granted two-sixths of the total costs of the works,viz, $17,850. (B)  Miscellaneous works 73 Item 3.2 concerned the timber doors and frames. Mr Ho accepted that the key problem was with the frames, which had tilted. However, he said that the doors also had to be replaced because their edges had been chamfered by the defendant, at the Lim family’s request, to fit the existing frames. Yet there was no evidence before me on who had chamfered the doors and why they had done so; and Mr Ho accepted that, if the doors had remained in their original state, it would only have been necessary to replace the frames. The plaintiffs therefore did not discharge their burden of proof in relation to a claim for the cost of the doors. Mr Ho testified that the frames would cost about 30% of the total costs he had quantified. I therefore allowed 30% of item 3.2,viz, $7980.00. 74 Item 11 was the costs of relocation while the works were carried out. Mr Ho allowed for eight months of relocation costs for a total of $96,000. However, he conceded that this figure came from the plaintiff; and that, in his assessment, six months would be a reasonable time to complete the work. I noted that Mr Lee said that the works would take eight to nine months. Yet, both his and Mr Ho’s assessments were based on the assumption that all the items of work in P3 would be carried out. However, I have only assessed damages on the basis of some of the items of works in P3. I thus decided that I would allow Item 11 in part on the basis that the works would take six months. This yielded a sum of $72,000. (3) Items which I did not allow 75 Items 2.3, 4, 5.1 and 6 concerned works which sought to address the tilt, from an aesthetics perspective, when the Property was viewed from the outside. These were, respectively, plastering the external walls, scaffolding for works to the external walls, painting the external walls, and replacing the canopy roofs which had to be removed to carry out the external plastering works. However, as noted at [67] above, I was unable to perceive any tilt from the outside when I inspected the Property. Thus, I did not account for these items in assessing damages. 76 Secondly, I did not account for items 1.9 and 2.4 in assessing damages. Mr Ho conceded that these items were unconnected to aesthetic issues attributable to the tilt. (4) Summary 77 Based on the above, I assessed the reinstatement costs, applying the Aesthetics Method, and the relocation costs at a total of $462,200.76. A tabulation of the breakdown using the framework of P3 is annexed hereto.",
        "The Third Issue": "78 The third issue was whether, given that I had assessed the reinstatement costs based on the Aesthetics Method, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover a further sum for loss of amenity.",
        "The Fourth Issue": "86 After I delivered judgment assessing the damages due to the plaintiffs at $462,200.76, I heard the parties on the issues of interest and costs. 87 After hearing the parties and reviewing their written submissions on these issues, I decided not to award interest to the plaintiffs. While the plaintiffs have not appealed against my order, the present case engages an important point about interest for special damages for damage to property. I shall therefore set out my full reasons for my decision on interest. 88 To begin with, I accepted the defendant’s submission that I ought not to award interest for the period between the first tranche of the hearing,ie, 5 November 2015, and the delivery of my oral grounds on 30 June 2017. That delay was a result of the plaintiffs pursuing an issue which I ultimately found to be unmeritorious. Moreover, the delay was entirely avoidable: if the plaintiffs and their experts had been more diligent in monitoring and measuring the tilt of the Property, in order to ascertain if it was getting worse, the issue would have been canvassed in the first tranche or not raised at all. 89 The real issue was whether I should award interest from the date of the commencement of the action until the end of the first tranche, and following the assessment of damages. On this point, the defendant emphasised that the plaintiffs had not carried out any rectification works and would not be doing so until the defendant paid them damages. The plaintiffs had thus not been kept out of any money, and so interest ought not to be awarded. 90 The general power to award interest is found in s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed). InLim ChengWah v Ng Yaw Kim[1983–1984] SLR(R) 723 (“Lim ChengWah”), L P Thean J (as he then was), in considering an earlier version of s 12(1), recognised at [6] that the basis on which interest is awarded is that a party has been kept out of money that ought to have been paid to him or her. In that case, the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s vehicles collided. The plaintiff and the defendant claimed and counterclaimed respectively for the damage caused to their vehicles. The parties settled on the issues of liability and the quantum of damages. The issue which arose was whether the parties were entitled to interest on the damages. In ruling that interest ought to be awarded, L P Thean J reasoned at [11] as follows: On the basis of the principles discussed above, I see no reason why in exercise of my discretion under s 9 of the Civil Law Act interest should not be awarded in this case.The plaintiff and the defendant had each been out of pocket; they had actually paid the expenses incurred in the repair of their respective motor vehiclesand had been kept out of the money which ought to have been paid to them respectively. … [emphasis added] Thus, the crucial reason why L P Thean J awarded interest was that the parties had paid for the repair of their respective vehicles and thus had been out of pocket for those sums. I shall return to this point below. 91 The facts here were akin to those inGiles v Thompson[1994] 1 AC 142 (“Giles”).Gilesinvolved two appeals concerning similar facts. The defendants were liable for damaging the plaintiffs’ cars in motor accidents. The plaintiffs then hired substitute cars from companies. The hire contracts provided that the companies would have the right to sue the defendants in the plaintiffs’ names. The hire charges were also not capable of immediate enforcement but were only due if the plaintiffs breached provisions pertaining to the companies’ pursuit of the actions in the plaintiffs’ names. In one of the appeals, the trial judge awarded interest on the damages referable to the hire charges. Lord Mustill, delivering the principal judgment of the House of Lords, ruled that the plaintiff was not entitled to interest for the following reasons (at 167–168): The argument for the motoristproceeds on the basis that the motorist's cause of actionagainst the defendant, and the financial loss resulting from it,came into existence at the moment of the accident, and was later quantified as special damage when the hiring period came to an end. At this time, so the argument runs, the defendant should have recompensed the motorist for her loss. Thereafter, she was \"kept out of her money,\" a detriment for which she should be recompensed by an award of interest. Although this argument seems logical at first sight,it ignores the fact that the power to award interest is discretionary, and that the exercise of this power should correspond with reality. In the present case, although the motorist incurred a genuine liability for the hire charges day by day, it was not a liability capable of immediate enforcement by the hire company.In both practical and legal terms the financial position of the motorist was wholly unaffected by the defendant's failure to make immediate payment, since the terms of the contract meant that until judgment was given she was not obliged to pay the hiring charges and also that as soon as the claim was “concluded” and the period of credit came to an end the damages provided the necessary funds. In reality she was not \"kept out of\" any money of her own whilst the claim was being assessed and litigated. [emphasis added] I respectfully agreed with this reasoning. In my judgment, it is important to examine whether a party has been kept out of money in practical terms. Such an approach ensures that the exercise of the power to award interest “correspond[s] with reality”, in the words of Lord Mustill. If the party has not been kept out of money in practical terms, then interest should not be awarded on that basis. 92 In this case, the plaintiffs were not kept out of money in practical terms because they did not commence rectification works and so were not out of pocket for the cost of the same. The facts were distinguishable from those inLim ChengWah(see [90] above), where the parties had paid for the repairs to their vehicles. As the plaintiffs were not out of pocket for the cost of the rectification works, I decided that it was not appropriate to award interest on that basis. I considered whether there was any other reason to award interest to the plaintiffs. Notably, the quantification of the costs of the Aesthetics Method was based on Mr Ho’s report dated 10 September 2014 (albeit he later revised his figures). However, neither Mr Ho nor the plaintiffs suggested that the quantification ought to be updated in the light of inflation or that interest should be awarded to address costs increases due to inflation. In any event, I did not consider that it would be proper to award interest to address inflation. If costs had increased due to inflation, the appropriate course would have been to apply to amend the claim for special damages to reflect current costs, not to seek interest to cover the increase in costs. For all the above reasons, I decided not to award interest on the damages. 93 In relation to costs, for the reasons given in [88] above,viz, the second tranche was convened because the plaintiffs pursued an issue which I found to be unmeritorious, and this pursuit was avoidable, I decided that the defendant ought not to be liable for costs that was incurred for and in relation to the second tranche. However, I was not persuaded by the defendant’s contention that I should award costs for the second tranche of the hearing to the defendant. In my judgment, if the issue in the second tranche had been raised in the first tranche, costs would not have been awarded to the defendant on this issue. I saw no reason why a different conclusion should follow simply because two tranches were involved. I considered that it would suffice not to award costs to the plaintiffs in respect of the second tranche of the hearing. 94 The Guidelines for Party-and-Party Costs Awards (“the Guidelines”) in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions stipulate a daily tariff of between $8,000 to $12,000 for the assessment of damages of non-motor accident matters, with the daily tariff being awarded in full if the hearing does not exceed five days. This case involved issues of novelty and complexity. There was also the need to understand engineering issues. I therefore considered that the tariff was not directly applicable, and that the cost guidelines for simple and complex tort claims for trials were more relevant. In my judgment, a tariff of $16,000, which is between the tariffs for simple and complex tort claims for trials, was appropriate. I thus allowed costs at a rate of $16,000 per day for the three days of the first tranche of the hearing. In addition, I allowed costs for the period from the commencement of the action to the entry of interlocutory judgment which I fixed at $8,000. In addition, I allowed costs for the work done for closing submissions which I fixed at $12,000. In the round, I awarded the plaintiffs costs of the action and the assessment of damages fixed at $68,000. I also awarded the plaintiffs reasonable disbursements for the action, save for the disbursements incurred for the second tranche including the costs and expenses of their expert for that tranche, for the same reason why I declined to order costs to the plaintiffs in relation to the second tranche.",
        "Conclusion": "95 For the above reasons, I awarded the plaintiffs damages assessed in the sum of $462,200.76 and costs fixed at $68,000 plus reasonable disbursements save for disbursements incurred for the second tranche of the hearing.
