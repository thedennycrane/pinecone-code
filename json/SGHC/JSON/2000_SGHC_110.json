        "VBTRF as plaintiff": "9. InTomlinson v The Land and Finance\n\nCorporation Ltd(1884) 14 QBD 539 goods in the possession of the debtor were seized by\n\nthe sheriff in execution upon a judgment. A claim to the goods having been made by a\n\nholder of a bill of sale the sheriff interpleaded and the court ordered an issue to be\n\ntried in which the claimant should be plaintiff and the execution creditors defendants and\n\nthat the question to be tried should be whether at the time of the seizure by the sheriff\n\nthe goods were the property of the claimant as against the execution creditors. The\n\nexecution creditors were ordered to give security for costs.10. Brett MR said at p 541:\"If the chattels are claimed under an\n\n  alleged title which is inconsistent with the supposed property of the execution debtors,\n\n  upon the sheriff interpleading the execution creditors will have to prove that they are\n\n  entitled to the chattels seized: it is true that the execution creditors are usually made\n\n  defendants in the interpleader issue, but they have to assert their right, and\n\n  substantially are plaintiffs ....\"Bowen LJ said at p 542:\"The claimant to goods seized under a\n\n  writ of fieri facias is usually bound to prove his title to them upon the trial of the\n\n  interpleader issue; but this does not put the execution creditor into the position of an\n\n  ordinary defendant; and when an interpleader issue has been directed and the sheriff has\n\n  slipped out of the dispute, the parties who remain, that is, the execution creditor and\n\n  the claimant, are both plaintiffs, they are not in the position of the parties to an\n\n  ordinary action.\"11. InIn re Milward & Co[1900] 1 Ch 405 the solicitors were ordered to pay into court a fund in their hands belonging to\n\na client and an inquiry was directed who was entitled to it. Upon the inquiry a claimant\n\nresident out of the jurisdiction claimed to have a charge on the fund. He was ordered to\n\ngive security for costs.12. Lindley MR said at p 407:\"The solicitors had a sum of money in\n\n  their hands upon which Shield alleges that he has a charge. That sum belongs to Mrs\n\n  Gardner unless Shield can establish his charge. In substance he is in the position of a\n\n  plaintiff, and not of a defendant. It is Mrs Gardner’s money unless he can make a\n\n  claim upon it. Under these circumstances, the true analogy is that which I have suggested,\n\n  namely, that it is an interpleader issue; and, that being so, Mr Shield must be ordered to\n\n  give security for costs.\"Mr Shield had to assert his right and he\n\nwas substantially a plaintiff.13. In the present case the balance of the\n\nproceeds of sale have been paid into court. Subject to the claims of creditors if any they\n\nbelong to the owner of the vessel at the time of its arrest. VBTRF claims to be the owner.\n\nIt has applied for the issue of the validity and enforceability of an agreement dated 16\n\nJanuary 1998 (an agreement among other things for transfer of the vessel to Falkland) to\n\nbe remitted to a tribunal in Russia. Alternatively it asks this court to declare the\n\nagreement to be null and void and to substitute it as owner of the vessel and defendant in\n\nplace of Falkland. If such an order is made the effect is to allow VBTRF to apply for\n\npayment out of the balance of the proceeds of sale to itself. VBTRF is asserting its right\n\nto the fund in court. I think it is in substance the plaintiff in the proceeding in\n\nrelation to the VBTRF application and Mr Khoo’s concession has been properly made.",
        "Falkland as defendant": "14. InTomlinsonBrett MR went on\n\nto say at p 541:\"... both the execution creditors and\n\n  the claimants were plaintiffs, neither were defendants in point of fact, although on the\n\n  record, as a matter of convenience, one party was made plaintiff, and the other\n\n  defendant.\"He was of course referring to the position\n\nunder the Interpleader Act and the subsequent statutes relating to interpleader (since\n\nrepealed) but the position on this point was the same under Order LVII then in force and\n\nwould be the same in the case before me under O 17. Bowen LJ said that neither party was\n\nin the position of anordinary defendant. They were both in agreement that the\n\nexecution creditors’ appeal against the order for security for costs to be given\n\nshould be dismissed.15. InThe Silver Fir[1980] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 371 the disponent owners of the vessel claimed against the charterers in\n\nan arbitration damages for repudiation of the charter-party for wrongful refusal to load\n\ntheir cargo and in their points of defence the charterers alleged that the vessel was not\n\nat any material time ready to load any cargo under the charter-party and gave particulars\n\nin support of their allegation. They went on to allege that each of the particulars\n\npleaded constituted a breach of the charter-party and as a result those allegations became\n\nthe basis of their counterclaim for damages. Both parties were corporations registered and\n\ncarrying on business out of the jurisdiction. In the court below security for costs was\n\nordered against the claimants but not against the respondents in respect of the\n\ncounterclaim. On appeal security for costs was ordered.16. Lawton LJ at p 374 referred toNeck\n\nv Taylor[1893] 1 QB 560 where Lord Esher MR said at p 562:\"Where, however, the counterclaim is\n\n  not in respect of a wholly distinct matter, but arises in respect of the same matter or\n\n  transaction upon which the claim is founded, the court will not, merely because the party\n\n  counterclaiming is resident out of the jurisdiction, order security for costs; it will in\n\n  that case consider whether the counterclaim is not in substance put forward as a defence\n\n  to the claim, whatever form in point of strict law and of pleading it may take, and, if\n\n  so, what under all the circumstances will be just and fair as between the parties; and\n\n  will act accordingly.\"He held that the court had a discretion to\n\norder security to be given.17. InThe Silver Firsecurity for\n\ncosts was ordered against both the claimants and the respondents in the arbitration. The\n\norders were made applying O 23 pursuant to which the court may order security for\n\n\"thedefendant’scosts of the action or other proceeding as it thinks\n\njust\". Each of the parties was in substance a plaintiff and the other a defendant.18. InTomlinsonsecurity was\n\nordered against the execution creditors for the costs of the claimant in the trial of the\n\nissue. There were no other parties involved. InIn re Milward & Cothe claimant\n\nwas ordered to give security for the costs of the solicitors’ client in the inquiry.\n\nThere was no other party or at any rate no other party at that stage. InThe Silver Firorders were made for security for costs against both parties to the arbitration. Both\n\nwere plaintiffs and both were defendants for the purpose of O 23. It seems to me that\n\nwhere a party would if he is successful in his defence in an action or other legal\n\nproceeding be entitled to the costs of his defence against another party if costs follow\n\nthe event and that other party is a plaintiff for the purpose of s 388(1) of the Companies\n\nAct or O 23 r 1 then the first party is a defendant for this purpose.19. If Falkland succeeds in its defence in\n\nthe VBTRF application and costs follow the event it would have the costs of its defence\n\nagainst VBTRF. VBTRF is a plaintiff in this application for the purpose of s 388(1) of the\n\nCompanies Act. In my judgment Falkland is a defendant and it is entitled to apply for\n\nsecurity for its costs.",
        "Discretion": "20. VBTRF is in liquidation and it is not\n\nin dispute that it will be unable to pay Falkland’s costs if Falkland is successful\n\nin its defence. What I have to consider is what under all the circumstances will be just\n\nand fair as between the parties. VBTRF borrowed US$7m from Falkland. It agreed to repay\n\nthe loan by July 1997. As security for the loan VBTRF mortgaged the vessel to Falkland.\n\nVBTRF has defaulted and on Falkland’s application the vessel was arrested on 14\n\nNovember 1997 by order of the Dalian Court. This is a summary of the facts recited in the\n\nagreement dated 16 January 1998 which VBTRF is seeking to have declared null and void. The\n\nagreement provides for the transfer of the vessel to Falkland in partial discharge of\n\nVBTRF’s indebtedness and to that extent total discharge of the mortgage obligations.\n\nIn the VBTRF application the indebtedness of VBTRF and its default are not disputed but it\n\nis alleged that Mr Nikitenko Nikolay Ivanovich who signed the agreement for and on behalf\n\nof VBTRF had no authority to do so.21. Mr Khoo has not invited my attention\n\nto any other circumstances which I should take into account and in the circumstances which\n\nI have outlined I think VBTRF ought to be ordered to give security for Falkland’s\n\ncosts of its defence of the VBTRF application. I think security should be in an amount of\n\n$20,000 and I made an order accordingly.Lim Teong QweeJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
