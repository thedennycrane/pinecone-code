        "Whether there has been procedural impropriety or a breach of the rules of natural justice": "11.    Ms Kang’s assertion that the decision to\n\nrevoke her driving licence was flawed on the ground of procedural impropriety or a breach\n\nof the rules of natural justice will first be considered. Her position was put as follows:Aside from the letter from the traffic police dated 15 October 2001 and\n\n  the police report filed by the Plaintiff, there were no correspondence by letter or\n\n  telephone between the Plaintiff and the traffic police. Neither were there any meetings,\n\n  interviews or discussions between the traffic police and the Plaintiff to ascertain her\n\n  medical condition to determine whether it was severe enough to warrant revoking her\n\n  licence. The decision is disproportionate to the cause of the accident and to the\n\n  Plaintiff’s asthmatic condition.12.    Section 37(6) of the Road Traffic Act does not\n\nrequire the police to hold an inquiry or an oral hearing before revoking a driver’s\n\nlicence in the interest of public safety. It provides that if the Deputy Commissioner of\n\nPolice is satisfied after makingsuch inquiry as he considers necessarythat a\n\ndriver is a source of danger to the public, notice of an intention to revoke that\n\ndriver’s driving licence may be given. Admittedly, the Deputy Commissioner’s\n\ndecision is not outside the ambit of judicial scrutiny altogether. InSecretary of\n\nState for Education and Science v Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council[1977] AC\n\n1014, 1047, Lord Wilberforce, while referring to an English statutory provision, said:The section is framed in a ‘subjective’ form – if the\n\n  Secretary of State ‘is satisfied’. This form of section is quite well known, and\n\n  at first sight might seem to exclude judicial review. Sections in this form may, no doubt,\n\n  exclude judicial review on what is or has become a matter of pure judgment. But I do not\n\n  think that they go further than that. If a judgment requires, before it can be made, the\n\n  existence of some facts, then, although the evaluation of those facts is for the Secretary\n\n  of State alone, the court must inquire whether those facts exist, and have been taken into\n\n  account, whether the judgment has been made upon a proper self-direction as to those\n\n  facts, whether the judgment has not been made upon other facts which ought not to have\n\n  been taken into account.13.    In the present case, the relevant facts are not\n\nin dispute. The Commander of Traffic Police did not act on the basis of a third\n\nparty’s uncorroborated allegation that Ms Kang caused an accident while having an\n\nacute asthmatic attack. Instead, he acted on the basis of Ms Kang’s own admission\n\nthat the accident was caused by her loss of control of her vehicle as a result of an acute\n\nasthmatic attack. In her police report, she used words such as \"in my state of health\n\nand shock\" when referring to the acute asthma attack suffered by her and her own\n\ndoctor confirmed that she suffered from an acute attack of asthma at the time of the\n\naccident. The letter which was sent to her by the traffic police on 15 October 2001\n\nreferred to the fact that the accident occurred while she had an asthma attack and to the\n\nmedical report submitted by her. The Commander of Traffic Police’s decision to revoke\n\nher driving licence was, in Lord Wilberforce’s words, made \"upon a proper\n\nself-direction as to those facts\" and \"not upon other facts which ought not to\n\nhave been taken into account\".14.    There is thus no reason for suggesting that the\n\ndecision of the Commander of Traffic Police to revoke Ms Kang’s driving licence is\n\nflawed because of procedural impropriety or a breach of the rules of natural justice. In\n\nshort, as far as Ms Kang’s first ground for attacking the decision of the Commander\n\nof Traffic Police is concerned, there is no point which might, on further consideration,\n\nturn out to be an arguable case in favour of granting her the relief claimed.",
        "Whether the decision to revoke Ms Kang’s licence was unreasonable": "15.    I now turn to Ms Kang’s second ground for\n\nleave to apply for an order of certiorari, namely the unreasonableness of the decision to\n\nrevoke her driving licence. Whether or not the decision of the police to revoke Ms\n\nKang’s licence is unreasonable must be viewed in the light of what has been termed\n\n\"Wednesburyunreasonableness\". InAssociated Provincial Picture Houses\n\nLtd v Wednesbury Corporation[1948] 1 KB 223, 233, Lord Greene MR explained:The court is entitled to investigate the action of the local authority\n\n  with a view to seeing whether they have taken into account matters which they ought not to\n\n  take into account, or, conversely, have refused to take into account or neglected to take\n\n  into account matters which they ought to take into account. Once that question is answered\n\n  in favour of the local authority, it may be still possible to say that, although the local\n\n  authority have kept within the four corners of the matters which they ought to consider,\n\n  they have nevertheless come to a conclusion so unreasonable that no reasonable authority\n\n  could ever have come to it. In such a case, again, I think the court can interfere.16.    It is important to note that Lord Greene MR added\n\nthat the power of the court to interfere on the ground of unreasonableness \"is not as\n\nan appellate authority to override a decision of the local authority, but as a judicial\n\nauthority which is concerned, and concerned only, to see whether the local authority have\n\ncontravened the law by acting in excess of the powers which Parliament has confided in\n\nthem\". He added that it is not what the court considers unreasonable that matters.\n\nWhat is relevant is whether or not a decision is so unreasonable that no reasonable\n\nauthority could ever have come to it. InCouncil of Civil Service Unions v Minister for\n\nCivil Service[1985] 1 AC 374, 411, Lord Diplock, while referring to \"Wednesburyunreasonableness\" said that it \"applies to a decision which is so outrageous in\n\nits defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had\n\napplied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it\".17.    Ms Kang argued that the decision of the Commander\n\nof Traffic Police is disproportionate to the cause of the accident and to her asthmatic\n\ncondition. Her position was put as follows:The Plaintiff is under medication for her asthma and has a clean\n\n  driving record since she obtained her licence in 1996. Her licence has never been\n\n  suspended or revoked. Her asthmatic condition is and has always been under control and it\n\n  was unfortunate that she had a particularly bad attack on 19 September 2001. The\n\n  Plaintiff’s condition was aggravated by the coolness of the early morning at 4.30 am.\n\n  The Plaintiff will be taking greater precautions to ensure that such an accident does not\n\n  occur again. The Plaintiff suffers only about 3-5 attacks a year and is not a chronic\n\n  sufferer. The Plaintiff does not usually drive her car at 4.30 am. She is mainly a day\n\n  driver.18.    On the facts, the decision of the Commander of\n\nTraffic Police is certainly not one that is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of\n\naccepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question\n\nto be decided could have arrived at it. As such, as far as Ms Kang’s second ground\n\nfor attacking the decision of the Commander of Traffic Police is concerned, there is also\n\nno point which might, on further consideration, turn out to be an arguable case in favour\n\nof granting her the relief claimed.Ms Kang has not utilised the mechanism under section 37(8) of the Act to get back her\n\ndriving licence19.    It should not be overlooked that Ms Kang has not\n\nutilised the mechanism provided for in section 37(8) of the Road Traffic Act, which has\n\nbeen referred to above, to get back her driving licence. In fact, after she initiated the\n\npresent proceedings, the traffic police invited her to take a prescribed medical test and\n\nto furnish additional medical information as to why her licence should not be revoked. On\n\n2 November 2001, the traffic police sent her the following letter:I refer to my letter dated 15 October 2001.2. To-date, we have not received your driving licence.3. The reasons forwarded by your lawyer on your behalf have been\n\n  considered by us. They are not sufficient to assure us that you would not be a danger to\n\n  other road users. We are prepared to consider any additional evidence that you may have to\n\n  support your claims that you should not be subjected to the revocation of your driving\n\n  licence. This should be submitted to us by 18 November 2001. You should also let us know\n\n  if you are prepared to undergo medical examination by a specialist nominated by us.4. If you do not wish to provide additional medical evidence or be\n\n  medically examined, then you should forthwith surrender your driving licence. In any event\n\n  you should not drive any vehicle on the road until you hear from us.20.    Ms Kang did not respond to the offer. Her\n\ncounsel, Mr Andrew Hanam, pointed out that the offer to her to take a prescribed test,\n\nwhich was made after the decision to revoke her licence, is irrelevant for the purpose of\n\nconsidering whether the original decision is flawed. He added that before Ms Kang is\n\nprepared to take the prescribed test or furnish additional information to satisfy the\n\ntraffic police that she is not a source of danger to the public, the Commander of Traffic\n\nPolice must accept that his decision to revoke her licence is wrong and pay the costs of\n\nthese proceedings. If that is her stand, she cannot complain if the traffic police have\n\nnot reversed the decision to revoke her driving licence.21.    In the final analysis, it ought not be overlooked\n\nthat the traffic police have a duty to act in the interest of the safety of drivers and\n\nother users of roads. As such, the power of the traffic police to revoke a driver’s\n\ndriving licence under section 37(6) of the Road Traffic Act to protect members of the\n\npublic should not be unnecessarily fettered. So long as the Deputy Commissioner of Police,\n\nand anyone legitimately exercising his powers, is satisfied, after making such inquiry as\n\nis considered necessary, that the revocation of a person’s driving licence is in the\n\ninterest of the public, that person should, without more, exercise his right under section\n\n37(8) of the Act to be subjected to a test as to his fitness to drive a motor vehicle\n\nrather than seek an order of certiorari.Conclusion22.    Admittedly, the test for granting leave to an\n\napplicant to apply for an order of certiorari involves a very low threshold. All the same,\n\nit is pertinent to note that inPublic Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin, Linda[2001] 1 SLR 644, 653, LP Thean JA reiterated that the requirement of leave to apply for such an\n\norder is intended to be a means of filtering out groundless or hopeless cases at an early\n\nstage, and its aim is to prevent a wasteful use of judicial time and to protect public\n\nbodies from harassment, whether intentional or otherwise. The present application is\n\nclearly one where the granting of leave will waste judicial time and unnecessarily harass\n\nthe traffic police. As has been mentioned, Ms Kang has the opportunity to present further\n\nmedical evidence to the traffic police and to take a prescribed medical test to show that\n\nshe is fit to drive a motor vehicle. Taking all circumstances into account, her\n\napplication for leave to apply for an order of certiorari is dismissed with costs.Sgd:TAN LEE MENGJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
