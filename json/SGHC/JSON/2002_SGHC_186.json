        "TheEx parte Jamesprinciple": "6        Counsel for the Claimant,\n\nMr Quahe, submitted that on the principle inEx parte James, re Condon(1874) LR 9\n\nCh App, the Court ought to order the Liquidators to refund the Monies. InRe PCChip\n\nComputer Manufacturer (S) Pte Ltd[2001] 3 SLR 296, I had applied the principle inEx\n\nparte Jamesand ordered the Liquidators to refund a sum of money mistakenly paid by\n\nthe bank to them in the course of the winding up of the company. In coming to that\n\ndecision I had been guided by the four conditions suggested by Walton J inIn re Clark\n\n(A Bankrupt), Ex parte The Trustee v Texaco Ltd[1975] 1 WLR 559, viz:(i) There must be some form of enrichment of the assets of the bankrupt\n\n  by the claimant;(ii) The claimant must not be in a position to submit an ordinary proof\n\n  of debt;(iii) In all the circumstances of the case an honest person would\n\n  consider that it would only be fair to return the money to the claimant; and(iv) The principle applies only to the extent necessary to nullify the\n\n  enrichment of the estate.Mr Quahe submitted that all four conditions were met in the present\n\ncase and therefore the Court ought to make a similar order.7        I pointed out to Mr Quahe\n\nthat condition (ii), i.e. that the claimant must not be in a position to submit an\n\nordinary proof of debt, was not met in the present case. This is because the payment of\n\nthe Monies was made before the Company passed the special resolution for winding up. InRe\n\nPCChip, although the bank had mistakenly credited the company’s account before\n\nthe winding up order was made, the money was paid over to the liquidators only after the\n\nwinding up order. Merely to credit the company’s bank account does not tantamount a\n\npayment as it is in the nature of the banking relationship that this only reflects a debt\n\nowed by the bank to its client.8        However as I had pointed\n\nout inRe PCChip(at 36), the four conditions distilled by Walton J inIn re\n\nClarkare not rigid rules of law because the principle inEx parte Jamesis a\n\nstatement of general policy. While those conditions are useful as a guide to the\n\napplication of the principle, especially in a border-line situation, the failure to meet\n\none or more conditions does not by itself determine the matter.9        The more important factor\n\nthat distinguishes the present case fromRe PCChipis the fact that here the\n\nCompany is being wound up voluntarily. The Liquidators are not appointed by the Court but\n\nby resolution of the Company. Mr Quahe urged that there should not be any distinction\n\ndrawn between liquidators appointed by the Court and those appointed by special resolution\n\nof the company. Indeed support for his position can be found in (2001) 2 SAL Ann Rev at\n\n14.23 in which the learned reviewer stated as follows:14.23 Another consequence is that, according to the English courts, the\n\n  application of the principle is restricted only to court-appointed liquidators and does\n\n  not apply to liquidators conducting a voluntary liquidation (Re T H Knitwear\n\n  (Wholesale) Ltd[1988] 2 WLR 276). This is anomalous given that, in reality, the roles\n\n  and responsibilities of a liquidator in both types of winding up are similar to a very\n\n  large extent, not to mention the awkward implication that a liquidator of a voluntary\n\n  winding up need not act honourably. Neither is it clear why the legal result should differ\n\n  according to whether a recipient of a payment made under a mistake is in compulsory or\n\n  voluntary liquidation. Notably, there is an Australian authority which has held that theEx\n\n  parte Jamesprinciple applies to both types of liquidators (Re Autolook Pty Ltd(1983) 8 ACLR 419).10        Unfortunately the\n\nexistence of an anomaly cannot grant the Court a jurisdiction that it otherwise does not\n\nhave. In the cases where theEx parte Jamesprinciple has been applied,\n\njurisdiction is founded on the fact the liquidator is appointed by the Court pursuant to\n\nits statutory powers under the Companies Act. The liquidator acts under the supervision\n\nand direction of the Court which will not permit him to exercise his powers\n\nunconscionably. This principle has been developed by the Courts in response to situations\n\nwhere injustice could otherwise result. The fact that the Court would be unable to apply\n\nthis principle in the case of a voluntary liquidation does not make it any less valid.11        The decision of the\n\nSupreme Court of New South Wales inRe Autolook Pty Ltd(1983) 8 ACLR 419\n\nrepresents a very interesting application of theEx parte Jamesprinciple. The\n\nliquidator there had applied to the court for directions as to whether he ought to\n\ndisclose to the Commissioner of Taxation information he had uncovered in the course of his\n\nexamination of the company’s officers which indicated that the income of the company\n\nwas probably much higher than was disclosed in the documents that he had earlier\n\nsubmitted. The liquidator’s intention in that application was (at p.420):\"to\n\nknow whether he should alert the … Commissioner to this probability, or whether he is\n\njustified in saying nothing about it.\"Needham J considered the relevant\n\nlegislation and held there was no legal obligation on the part of the liquidator to give\n\nthis information. He then continued (at p.420):\" If there is a duty in the liquidator, therefore, to alert the\n\n  … Commissioner … it must arise out of general principle. It is clear that a\n\n  liquidator has a duty to act impartially and a duty to discover who are the creditors of\n\n  the company … I was not referred to, nor have I found, any case in which the\n\n  liquidator has been held liable where he fails to inform a creditor who lodges a proof\n\n  that the evidence in his possession would indicte that creditor had filed to claim the\n\n  full amount due to him. Any such duty must be implied from his duties to act honestly and\n\n  impartially.It is my opinion that if a\n\n  liquidator were aware that a creditor had understated his claim he would be acting less\n\n  than honestly and impartially if he distributed that assets available for payment to\n\n  creditors without informing the creditor of the facts known to him. In doing so he would\n\n  be acting on what he knew was a false basis and he would be preferring the other creditors\n\n  to the extent that the one creditor had understated his claim. I do not think that any\n\n  different principle would apply where the information in the liquidator’s possession\n\n  fails to instil complete conviction that the claim is understated but leads to a sense of\n\n  strong probability that it is.The principle to which I\n\n  have referred is, I think, supported by the well-known statement of Sir W M James LJ inEx\n\n  parte James…:\"I am of the opinion\n\n  that a trustee in bankruptcy is an officer of the Court. He has inquisitorial powers given\n\n  him by the Court, and the Court regards him as its officer, and he is to hold money in his\n\n  hands upon trust for its equitable distribution among the creditors. The Court, then,\n\n  finding that he has in his hands moneys which in equity belongs to someone else, ought to\n\n  set an example to the world by paying it to the person really entitled to it. In my\n\n  opinion the Court of Bankruptcy ought to be as honest as other people.\"I do not think that the\n\n  principle applies only to officers of the court. Any liquidator, whether an officer of the\n\n  court or not, who applies to the court for directions, should have those directions which\n\n  require him to perform his duties honestly.12        The judge then directed\n\nthe liquidator to advise the Deputy Commissioner of the matter. As can be seen from the\n\nlast paragraph cited above, the basis for this is that a court will require any liquidator\n\nwho applies to the court for directions, whether or not he is an officer of the court, to\n\nact honestly. However the court there did not appear to have consideredRe TH Knitwear\n\n(Wholesale)[1988] Ch 275 in which the English Court of Appeal unanimously and firmly\n\ndecided against giving a similar direction to a private liquidator. Slade LJ, with whom\n\nGlidewell LJ agreed, said (at p.289) that theEx parte Jamesprinciple introduced\"a\n\nless than welcome element of uncertainty\"and said that he would not extend it to\n\nprivate liquidators. The third judge of the court, Caulfield J also agreed with this,\n\nnoting that the authorities point to the principle being restricted to officers of the\n\ncourt. In view of this, and of the fact that the basis of theEx parte Jamesprinciple is that a court will not allow its officers to act dishonourably, I must\n\nrespectfully disagree that the decision inRe Autolook Pty Ltdshould be followed\n\nin Singapore.",
        "Constructive trust": "13        Mr Quahe submitted that in\n\nthe circumstances of the case, the Liquidators are constructive trustees of the Monies of\n\nwhich the Claimant is the beneficiary. Those circumstances are as follows:(i) the Claimant had paid the Monies to the Company under a mistake of\n\n  fact;(ii) the Company was notified of the fact of the mistake before the\n\n  winding up resolution was made;(iii) the Monies are kept in a separate account and are not mixed with\n\n  the other funds of the Company;14        Counsel for the\n\nLiquidators, Mr Sandrasegara, did not dispute the facts outlined above. Indeed, Mr\n\nSandrasegara informed me that the Liquidators do not really dispute the claim but they\n\nseek the sanction of the Court for any payment. However Mr Sandrasegara adopted an\n\nadversarial position in order to provide the Court with full arguments, for which I am\n\nextremely grateful. In relation to the question of knowledge, Mr Sandrasegara pointed out\n\nthat there was no evidence that the officers of the Company were notified of the matter.\n\nThe Claimants were only in communication with the officers of KPMG who had become involved\n\nin the affairs of the Company in anticipation of liquidation. Mr Sandrasegara submitted\n\nthat this did not impute knowledge on the Company. While I accept that this appears to be\n\ncorrect, for the purpose of the present action, such knowledge on the part of KPMG would\n\nbe a relevant factor because the Company was effectively inoperative at the time and KPMG\n\nhad gone into the Company to prepare for the eventual liquidation. Crucially, the KPMG\n\nofficer had held out to the Claimant that he was in a position to deal with the matter. If\n\nhe had advised that he was not in such a position, the Claimant could have taken some\n\nother course of action.15        Mr Quahe relied firstly on\n\nthe decision of English High Court inChase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank\n\n(London) Ltd[1981] 1 Ch. 105. That case concerned a mistaken payment of some US$2\n\nmillion by the plaintiff, a New York bank, to the defendant, a London bank. A few months\n\nafter the payment, the defendant was ordered to be wound up. The question before the court\n\nwas whether the plaintiff was entitled in equity to trace the mistaken payment and to\n\nrecover it. Goulding J held that where money was paid under a mistake of fact, the payer\n\nretains an equitable property in it and the recipient, whose conscience is subjected to a\n\nfiduciary duty to respect this proprietary right, holds the money as a trustee for the\n\npayer. On this basis, the payer is entitled to trace the money founded on a persistent\n\nproprietary interest.16        However theChase\n\nManhattandecision was criticised by Lord Browne-Wilkinson inWestdeutsche Bank v\n\nIslington LBC[1996] AC 669, where he said as follows (at p 714):It will be apparent from\n\n  what I have already said that I cannot agree with this reasoning. First, it is based on a\n\n  concept of retaining an equitable property in money where, prior to the payment to the\n\n  recipient bank, there was no existing equitable interest. Further, I cannot understand how\n\n  the recipient's \"conscience\" can be affected at a time when he is not aware of\n\n  any mistake. Finally, the judge found that the law of England and that of New York were in\n\n  substance the same. I find this a surprising conclusion since the New York law of\n\n  constructive trusts has for a long time been influenced by the concept of a remedial\n\n  constructive trust, whereas hitherto English law has for the most part only recognised an\n\n  institutional constructive trust: seeMetall und Rohstoff A.G. v. Donaldson Lufkin\n\n  Jenrette Inc.[1990] 1 Q.B. 391, 478-480.17        Mr Quahe submitted that,\n\nnotwithstanding the criticism of Lord Browne-Wilkinson, theChase Manhattancase\n\nhad been followed by the High Court inStandard Chartered Bank v Sin Chong Hua Electric\n\n& Trading[1995] 3 SLR 863. In the latter case the court found that the first\n\ndefendant had induced the plaintiff bank to pay over a sum of money through a fraudulent\n\nscheme and that the second, third and fourth defendants to whom the money were eventually\n\npaid, were not bona fide purchasers for value. Accordingly they became constructive\n\ntrustees of the plaintiffs’ money in their possession. The court did not rely on theChase\n\nManhattancase for this conclusion and only cited it for the proposition that the\n\nplaintiff was entitled to trace such money founded on a persistent equitable proprietary\n\ninterest. Theratio decidendiof theChase Manhattancase, which is that the\n\nrecipient of money paid under a mistake of fact holds it as trustee for the payer, was not\n\nfollowed inStandard Chartered Bank v Sin Chong Hua Electric & Trading.18        The ratio in theChase\n\nManhattancase has not been followed in any Singaporean decision submitted before me.\n\nIndeed inPP v Intra Group (Holdings) Co Inc[1999] 1 SLR 803, Yong CJ pointed out\n\nthat the finding in theChase Manhattancase, i.e. that there was a proprietary\n\nclaim, did not sit on all fours with the decision in theWestdeutsche Bankcase.19        However Lord\n\nBrowne-Wilkinson, in his speech inWestdeutsche Bank, suggested that theChase\n\nManhattancase could be explained on the basis that the defendant bank knew of the\n\nmistake two days after it was made. He said this at p.715:However, although I do not\n\n  accept the reasoning of Goulding J.,Chase Manhattanmay well have been rightly\n\n  decided. The defendant bank knew of the mistake made by the paying bank within two days of\n\n  the receipt of the moneys: see at p. 115A. The judge treated this fact as irrelevant\n\n  (p.114F) but in my judgment it may well provide a proper foundation for the decision.\n\n  Although the mere receipt of the moneys, in ignorance of the mistake, gives rise to no\n\n  trust, the retention of the moneys after the recipient bank learned of the mistake may\n\n  well have given rise to a constructive trust: seeSnell's Equity, p. 193;Pettit,\n\n  Equity and the Law of Trusts, 7th ed. (1993) p.168;Metall und Rohstoff A.G. v.\n\n  Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Inc.[1990] 1 Q.B. 391, 473-474.20        TheWestdeutsche Bankcase concerned an interest rate swap agreement between the bank and a local authority. It\n\nwas later determined that the authority had actedultra viresin entering into the\n\nagreement. However by that time the bank had paid certain sums of money to the authority.\n\nThe bank obtained judgment for the principal sum and was awarded compound interest. One of\n\nthe issues in the appeal to the House of Lords was whether the authority held the money on\n\na resulting trust, in which case compound interest could be awarded. Lord Browne-Wilkinson\n\nset out four propositions fundamental to the law of trusts at p.705:(i) Equity operates on the conscience of the owner of the legal\n\n  interest. In the case of a trust, the conscience of the legal owner requires him to carry\n\n  out the purposes for which the property was vested in him (express or implied trust) or\n\n  which the law imposes on him by reason of his unconscionable conduct (constructive trust).(ii) Since the equitable jurisdiction to enforce trusts depends upon\n\n  the conscience of the holder of the legal interest being affected, he cannot be a trustee\n\n  of the property if and so long as he is ignorant of the facts alleged to affect his\n\n  conscience, i.e. until he is aware that he is intended to hold the property for the\n\n  benefit of others in the case of an express or implied trust, or, in the case of a\n\n  constructive trust, of the factors which are alleged to affect his conscience.(iii) In order to establish a trust there must be identifiable trust\n\n  property. The only apparent exception to this rule is a constructive trust imposed on a\n\n  person who dishonestly assists in a breach of trust who may come under fiduciary duties\n\n  even if he does not receive identifiable trust property.(iv) Once a trust is established, as from the date of its establishment\n\n  the beneficiary has, in equity, a proprietary interest in the trust property, which\n\n  proprietary interest will be enforceable in equity against any subsequent holder of the\n\n  property (whether the original property or substituted property into which it can be\n\n  traced) other than a purchaser for value of the legal interest without notice.21        Applying these principles\n\nto the facts of the present case, the persons in effective control of the Company (the\n\nKPMG officers) had knowledge that the Monies were paid by mistake before the winding up\n\nresolution was passed. The Monies are an identifiable fund in a separate account that is\n\nnot mixed with the other funds of the Company. This last fact puts it in a stronger\n\nposition than theChase Manhattancase where there was no finding that the money\n\nwas not mixed by the time the mistake was notified to the defendant two days after the\n\npayment. InWestdeutsche BankLord Browne-Wilkinson had himself warned of the\n\ndanger of wholesale importation of equitable principles into commercial law (at p.704):My Lords, wise judges have\n\n  often warned against the wholesale importation into commercial law of equitable principles\n\n  inconsistent with the certainty and speed which are essential requirements for the orderly\n\n  conduct of business affairs: seeBarnes v. Addy(1874) L.R. 9 Ch.App. 244, 251 and\n\n  255;Scandinavian Trading Tanker Co. A.B. v. Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana[1983] 2   A.C. 694, 703-704. If the bank's arguments are correct, a businessman who has entered into\n\n  transactions relating to or dependent upon property rights could find that assets which\n\n  apparently belong to one person in fact belong to another; that there are \"off\n\n  balance sheet\" liabilities of which he cannot be aware; that these property rights\n\n  and liabilities arise from circumstances unknown not only to himself but also to anyone\n\n  else who has been involved in the transactions. A new area of unmanageable risk will be\n\n  introduced into commercial dealings. If the due application of equitable principles forced\n\n  a conclusion leading to these results, your Lordships would be presented with a formidable\n\n  task in reconciling legal principle with commercial common sense.22        None of the problems\n\npointed out is a feature of the present case due to the fact that the Monies have not been\n\nmixed with the Company’s funds. Moreover the Claimant had not intended to enter into\n\na commercial transaction with the Company; it was purely a case of the Monies being paid\n\nto the wrong party. So the present case is different from the situation inChase\n\nManhattan, where the plaintiff had intended to pay the defendant the money but had\n\nmistakenly made a second payment. That case involved a payer who had intended to give the\n\nmoney to the recipient, although under the mistaken belief that he was obliged to do so.\n\nThe present case is one where the Claimant had intended to pay a third party, but due to a\n\nmistake the payment is made to the Company. The moment the Company learnt of the mistaken\n\npayment it was unconscionable on its part to retain it. However it was perfectly\n\nreasonable for the Company to investigate the matter before returning the Monies and\n\npending such investigation, the Monies were rightly kept separate and unmixed.\n\nUnfortunately the winding up resolution intervened before the Monies could be returned. I\n\ncan see nothing in the present case that would stand in the way of the imposition of a\n\nconstructive trust.23        I therefore hold that the\n\nCompany holds the Monies under a constructive trust for the benefit of the Claimant prior\n\nto the winding up. Accordingly sanction would be given to the Liquidators to make payment\n\nof the Monies to the Claimant. As to costs, counsel informed me that the parties have a\n\nprior agreement on this and that I should make no order in that respect.Sgd:LEE SEIU KINJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
