        "Yeo Kim Han": "consented to 3 separate charges being taken into\n\nconsideration namely the 2ndCharge (causing hurt with a metal chair  under s 324), 3rdcharge (causing hurt with books  under s 323) and 5thcharge (causing grievous hurt by\n\npouring hot water, a heated substance  under s 326).3.Ong Li Xiawas about 14 years at the time of the offences andYeo\n\nKim Hanhad attained the age of 17. The offences were committed between 15thDecember 1999 to 2ndJanuary 2000 in an apartment whereOng Li Xialived\n\nwith 3 of her sisters and their mother. Her father was serving sentence at the time of the offences\n\nfor a drug offence. The mother works in a karaoke lounge.3.1 The Victim was confined to the flat in whichOng Li Xialived\n\nwith her sisters between 15thDecember 1999 to 2ndJanuary 2000. All the\n\noffences were committed in the flat. The flat was visited byYeo Kim Hanwhose\n\ngirlfriend was one of the sisters ofOng Li Xia.3.2 Some of the offences to which the two Accused have pleaded guilty, were\n\ncommitted together with others i.e. the sisters ofOng Li Xiaand one Neo Soo Kai and\n\none Melvin Yeo Yew Beng aged 17 years who also visited the flat. These individuals pleaded guilty in\n\nthe Subordinate Courts and have been sentenced recently.4. In essence, the ProsecutionsStatement of Factsshows that the\n\nVictim was initially physically assaulted with fists and instruments. Thereafter, over time, she was\n\nasked to perform acts, which will fill anyone who approaches the case, with great revulsion. At her\n\ntender age she was forced under threats to put objects into her private part and forced on another\n\noccasion, to perform oral sex with a dog  in effect an act of bestility, if I might say, which\n\ngreatly demeaned her sexually. In that incident,Ong Li XiaandYeo Kim Hanboth told the Victim to suck the penis of the dog andOng Li Xiacarried the dog\n\ntowards the Victims face.Yeo Kim Hanthreatened to beat the Victim with a stick if\n\nshe did not do so. On other days, hot water taken from a kettle was poured on her during her\n\ncaptivity several times over the two weeks to her screams. She suffered from third degree burns on\n\nher neck and chest and trunk and on her upper and lower limb as the medical report shows. The\n\nphotographic evidence shows extensive keloid formations over the burnt areas. The acts showed an\n\ninclination on the part of both Accused to be sadistic i.e. practising on the young Victim sexual\n\nperversion marked by a love for cruelty and also of deriving pleasure from inflicting or watching\n\ncruelty over the period of two weeks.4.1 The Victim has in herVictim Impact Statementstated poignantly that\n\nthe incidents have left on her horrendous scars as a result of the scalding with hot water, have\n\nhurt her and continue to hurt her greatly and have changed her life drastically for the worse and\n\nparticularly that with her said scars, no boy will even be attracted to her. The photographic\n\nevidence of the scars confirms the anguish which she has, no doubt, experienced. Both Accused have\n\nalso put the Victims family out of pocket with a large medical bill. More pain and expense will\n\nfollow if she is able to undergo plastic surgery to correct the scars. Some residual scarring will\n\nthough remain in the end.SentenceOng Li Xia5.Ong Li Xiabeing about 14 years old at the time of the offence and 15 now, falls\n\nwithin the definition of ayouthful offenderi.e. a person between the ages of 7 to 16, under\n\ns 2 of theCriminal Procedure CodeCap 68 (CPC). S 235 empowers a criminal court to\n\nimprison or fine ayouthful offenderconvicted by it as set out by the punishment provided by\n\nthat offence. The Court is however, given a discretionary power of sentencing such an accused person\n\nunder the punishment provisions of theChildren & Young Persons ActCap 38 (CYPA)\n\nunder which Act she would be categorised as ayoung personbeing between the ages of 14 \n\n16. The punishment provisions of CYPA are mainly set out in sections 37, 38 and 44 of the CYPA and\n\nthey constitute lesser punishments save for a provision for imprisonment contained in s 37 which\n\nhowever can only be imposed if the Court certifies that theyoung personis of so unruly a\n\ncharacter that such person cannot be detained in a place of detention or an approved school. S 38\n\nunder the same Act provides for detention for such specified period as a Court may specify where\n\ncertain grave offences have been committed by theyoung personnamely murder, culpable\n\nhomicide not amounting to murder, attempted murder or voluntarily causing grievous hurt and again\n\nonly if the Court is of the opinion that none of the other methods by which the case may be legally\n\ndealt with is suitable.5.1 Counsel forOng Li Xiasubmitted that I exercise my discretion and punish her\n\nunder one of the lesser punishments provided by the CYPA as the Accused, otherwise a bright student\n\nin school and of good character, was traumatised by her fathers detention for a drug offence\n\nabout a year earlier and by her mother seldom coming home as she worked in a karaoke lounge. Counsel\n\nexplained that the Accused had also harmed the Victim whilst under the trauma as the Victim had not\n\nkept an appointment with her at MacDonalds and also because her pet hamster was lost which loss\n\nshe blamed on the Victim. Counsel also submitted that under the CYPA, the Prosecution had not shown\n\nthat the Accused was of unruly character and should therefore not undergo imprisonment. Unruly\n\ncharacter, he said, could not be shown or proven from the facts of the case but should be\n\nindependently shown from external facts and observances as would describe her general reputation.\n\nCounsel intimated that perhaps, a pre-sentencing report should be called to ascertain her character.5.2 The Deputy Public Prosecutor in reply stated that there was a strong indication that the\n\nAccused was of unruly character given the nature of the offences and given the length of time i.e.\n\ntwo weeks over which the several offences were committed. The Court could therefore he said,\n\ndetermine the unruly character of the Accused from the facts of the case if it intended to proceed\n\non sentencing the Accused under the provisions of the CYPA.6. In my opinion, I am satisfied that the Court should exercise its power to punish the Accused\n\nunder its usual sentencing powers sitting as a Criminal Court as stated in s 235 of the CPC. For the\n\nexercise of such usual power, it is unnecessary for the Court to determine whether ayouthful\n\noffenderi.e. theyoung personis or is not generally of an unruly character. The vicious\n\noffences committed by the Accused on the Victim as is evident from the consequences she has\n\nsuffered, call for a punitive sentence of imprisonment that is deterrent. The Accused showed her\n\ndark side by inflicting harm to the Victim withYeo Kim Hanor in separate incidents.\n\nThe Accused contributed towards badly disfiguring her by pouring hot water on her body in addition\n\nto others thereby causing physical and mental damage to her in response to a petty dispute such as\n\nnot turning up at MacDonalds as scheduled and because her hamster was missing for which she put\n\nthe blame on the Victim. There was really no provocation or aggression by the Victim.Young\n\noffenderswhere they engage in violence and cause injuries on a person resulting in serious harm\n\nor consequences to the person without provocation can and should expect to be imprisoned and not\n\nexpect to be dealt with kid gloves by the Court. Nor should a minor provocation be made an excuse to\n\ninflict mindless violence on a person.6.1 In the circumstances, and taking into consideration the other charges consented to by the\n\nAccused, I sentence her as follows:1stcharge  s 377 (unnatural offence) - 2 years imprisonment6thcharge  s 147 (rioting) - 18 months imprisonment9thcharge  s 324 (hurt with weapon - a stick) - 2 years imprisonment10thcharge  s 509 (intruding on sexual privacy) - 6 months imprisonment12thcharge  s 342(confinement) - 6 months imprisonment14thcharge  s 326(pouring hot water) - 3 years imprisonment15thcharge  s 342(confinement) - 6 months imprisonment6.2 I consider the 1st, 10thand 14thcharges to be the most\n\nserious in so far as the actual facts are concerned and the sentences of 2 years, 6 months and 3\n\nyears respectively thereunder, shall run consecutively. The sentences in respect of the other\n\ncharges are to run concurrently with that of the 1st, 10thand 14thcharges. In sentencing the Accused, I have taken the totality principle into consideration by\n\nmoderating the sentence.The Accused shall therefore serve a total sentence of imprisonment of 5 years and shall take\n\neffect from the date of her remand.Yeo Kim Han7. As forYeo Kim Han, whose girlfriend wasOng Lay Hua, the elder sister ofOng Li Xia, his co-accused, Defence Counsel submitted that peer pressure and\n\ninfluence, drove the Accused to participate in the acts described in the charges. Counsel stated\n\nthat an altercation had broken out in the flat after the Victim was accused of not keeping an\n\nengagement at MacDonalds with his girlfriend Ong Lay Hua and the Victim had picked up a\n\nbroomstick to attack Ong Lay Hua. However, Counsel had conceded that Ong Lay Hua had slapped the\n\nVictim in the first place. To my mind, therefore, if the Victim picked up a broomstick, she probably\n\ndid it out of self-defence. No particular allegation was made by Counsel that she had actually hit\n\nOng Lay Hua with the broomstick or where she had been hit. In any case, the Accused had participated\n\nin the events of bullying and torturing the Victim by his violence in common intentionwith\n\nOng Li Xiaand separately by himself for some two weeks afterwards. I reject the mitigation\n\nof the Accused that he acted out of peer pressure. The Victim had not provoked him or caused any\n\nharm to him. He was 17 and a member ofRi Heng Lion Dance Training Centreand had admittedly\n\ngone abroad with his troupe on lion dances. He was obviously travelled and mature. I am of the\n\nopinion that he has to bear greater responsibility thanOng Li Xiafor the offences\n\ncommitted on the Victim especially in relation to the commission of the unnatural offence under s\n\n377..Ong Li Xiawas not his equal in age, intelligence or experience as regards\n\nmatters of sex although she had attained puberty and would have some basic instinct and\n\nunderstanding of sex. Moreover, I am of the opinion that there should therefore be a differentiating\n\nmeasure in respect of his punishment as it was he who threatened to beat the Victim with a stick if\n\nshe did not perform the unnatural act. The unnatural act took place mainly because of his threats to\n\nharm the Victim with a weapon. Taking the other charges which the Accused has consented to be taken\n\ninto consideration, I now sentence him as follows:1stcharge  s 377 (unnatural offence) - 4 years imprisonment6thcharge  s 147(rioting) - 18 months imprisonment plus 2 strokes of the cane9thcharge  s 324(hurt with stick  a weapon) - 2 years imprisonment plus 4\n\nstrokes of the cane10thcharge  s 509(intruding on sexual privacy) - 6 months imprisonment12thcharge  s 342(confinement) - 6 months imprisonment4thcharge  s 506(criminal intimidation) - 6 months imprisonment11thcharge  s 326(pouring hot water) - 3 years imprisonment plus 6 strokes of the\n\ncane.7.1 The sentences of imprisonment in respect of the 1st, 10thand 11thcharges are to run consecutively and the rest to run concurrently with the said 1st, 10thand 11thcharges. I have similarly taken the totality principle into consideration in\n\nsentencing the Accused by moderating the sentence.The total sentence of imprisonment therefore is 7 years and it shall take effect from the date\n\nof his remand.The cumulative number of strokes of the cane in respect of the 6th, 9thand\n\n11thcharges shall be 12.Amarjeet SinghJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
