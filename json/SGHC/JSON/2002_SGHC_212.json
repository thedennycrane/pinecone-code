        "The Facts": "2\n\n        The Urban Redevelopment Authority (\"the\n\nURA\") offered on behalf of the Government 18 parcels of conservation shophouses at\n\nPagoda Street, Singapore which are prominently within the Chinatown vicinage, as part of\n\nthe Government Land Sales Programme. It was marketed as \"an excellent investment\n\nopportunity for those who recognise the potential of these historic shophouses to\n\nparticipate in their restoration.\"3\n\n        The tender documents were contained in a\n\nDeveloper’s Packet made available to all interested parties, including the\n\ndefendants. Enquiry Forms were supplied in each Developer’s Packet to facilitate the\n\nprocess of clarification in response to any queries, doubts or uncertainties before the\n\nclose of the tender in respect of the terms of the tender. The tender documents included\n\nthe Particulars of Tender, Conditions of Tender, the draft Building Agreement, the draft\n\nLease, Technical Conditions of Sale/Tender, Conditions and Requirements of Relevant\n\nCompetent Authorities, Structural Report, Conservation Guide Plans, Planimetric Survey\n\n\"Topographical Plan\", Form of Tender and the Tender Brief.4\n\n        6 of these 18 parcels of conservation\n\nshophouses along Pagoda Street were put up for public auction. The remaining 12 land\n\nparcels, including the subject properties (No. 32 and No. 34), were put up for public\n\ntender for leases to be granted to the successful tenders for 99 years upon completion of\n\nthe restoration works in accordance with the building agreement. The defendants were the\n\nsuccessful tenderers of No 32 and No. 34 Pagoda Street (\"the Shophouses\") and\n\nwere awarded the tender on 22 August 1995. They signed the building agreement (\"the\n\nagreement\") dated 20 November 1995. It can be seen from the photograph in the Tender\n\nBrief that No. 34 Pagoda Street, was a 3-storey corner shophouse and that No. 32 Pago\n\nStreet was an adjacent 2-storey shophouse. The defendants agreed to restore those\n\nbuildings in accordance with the technical specifications. The intention was to restore\n\nthem as far as practicable to their pristine condition. In the event, the defendants\n\ninvested about $1 million for the restoration works.5\n\n        Under the agreement the sale price for the said\n\nland was $3,080,000.00. The First Schedule to the agreement specified the area of the\n\nShophouses as179.9 square metres(which, as described in the contractual\n\ndocuments, will hereinafter be referred to as \"the scheduled area\"). The\n\nprovisional and estimated nature of the scheduled area of 179.9 square metres for the\n\nShophouses is very clearly set out in the First Schedule to the Building Agreement and it\n\nreads:\"All those pieces of land\n\n    known as Lots 261pt and 262pt TS 6 and situated in the REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE as delineated\n\n    in red on the Plan annexed hereto and also marked as Parcel (422) and estimated to contain\n\n    an area of 179.9 square metres more or less subject to survey or resurvey, together with\n\n    the building/buildings erected thereon known as No. 32 and 34 Pagoda Street.\"6\n\n        Clause 9 of the agreement is central in this\n\ncase and the entire clause is reproduced below. It is also mirrored in clause 12 of the\n\nConditions of Tender. Clause 9 reads:\"(a) The land parcel is\n\n    believed and shall be taken to becorrectly described \"except as to its areawhich\n\n    shall be subject to Government survey or resurvey.\" The land parcel is open to\n\n    inspection and may be viewed by Tenderers on application.(b) If on completion of\n\n    Government survey or resurvey, it is found that the area of the land parcel ascertained by\n\n    such survey or resurvey (\"the surveyed area\") is either more than or less than\n\n    the area mentioned in theforegoing Particulars (\"the scheduled area\")by\n\n    more than 1% of the scheduled area, there shall be a corresponding adjustment of the\n\n    tendered sale price for the land parcel (hereinafter referred to as \"the said sale\n\n    price\") for the difference between the scheduled area and the surveyed area at the\n\n    rate the successful Tenderer tendered for each square metre of the land parcel as defined\n\n    below in Condition 12 (e) hereof.(c) If on completion of\n\n    Government survey or resurvey, it is found that thedifference between the surveyed\n\n    area and the scheduled areaof the land parcel isnot more than 1% of the scheduled\n\n    area, there shall be no adjustment of the said sale price for the difference between\n\n    the surveyed area and the scheduled area of the land parcel.(d) If Government survey or\n\n    resurvey of the land parcelis completed only after the said sale price is paid in full\n\n    to the Authority, any refund to be made by the Authority as a result of an adjustment\n\n    of the sale price shall be made in one lump sum without any interest whatsoever and any\n\n    amount of additional sale price attributable to an adjustment of the said sale price shall\n\n    be paid in one lump sum without any interest whatsoever by the successful Tenderer within\n\n    fourteen (14) days of the date of the Authority’s notice to such effect. In the event\n\n    the successful Tenderer shall fail for fourteen (14) days to comply with the\n\n    Authority’s notice as aforesaid, the Authority shall have the right and be entitled\n\n    to treat the successful Tenderer’s aforesaid failure as a breach of these present\n\n    rights and remedies under Condition 23 hereof or as an event of default which shall\n\n    entitle the Authority to exercise its rights and remedies set out in Clause 4(ii) of the\n\n    Building Agreement as the case may be.(e) Theratethe\n\n    successful Tenderer tenderedfor each square metreof the land parcel\n\n    abovementioned shall be the amount obtained by dividing the said sale price with the\n\n    scheduled area and rounded off to two decimal points.\" (Italicised added).7\n\n        On 20 November 1995 the defendants took\n\npossession of the Shophouses. They commenced works on 23 August 1996 and the renovation\n\nworks were duly and timeously completed. The Government issued the 99 year Lease to the\n\ndefendants on 27 May 1997 and two days later the Registrar of Titles issued Certificate of\n\nTitle in which the area of the Shophouses was stated to be 187 square metres.8     \n\nAlthough legal completion of the agreement had taken place and the Lease was issued, the\n\nGovernment title survey was not completed until the Chief Surveyor had approved the title\n\nsurvey and the Certified Plan on 10 December 1998. On 19 December, 1998 the Chief Surveyor\n\nforwarded the title plans and the Certificate of Title Plan to the Land Office and the\n\nRegistrar of Titles.9\n\n        To understand the disputes which have arisen in\n\nthis case, I have to dwell on the processes of a survey, the statutory regime governing it\n\nand what happened in this particular survey of shophouses.10\n\n        Mr Tan Kok Tiong, Head of Cadastral Survey\n\n(East) Section of the Land Survey Department of the Singapore Land Authority provided the\n\nrelevant evidence. He began his services with the department in 1966. He was formerly the\n\nPrincipal Technical Office of the Survey Department, Ministry of Law until 1 June 2001\n\nwhen the department merged with three other departments to form the Singapore Land\n\nAuthority under the Act bearing its name with effect from 1 June 2001.11\n\n        His evidence were substantially as follows. The\n\nconduct of cadastral surveys (also previously known as title surveys) by registered\n\nsurveyors are under the purview of the Chief Surveyor pursuant to the provisions of the\n\nLand Surveyors Act and Land Surveyors (Conduct of Cadastral Surveys) Rules. And prior to\n\nMarch 2000, this was pursuant to the Land Surveyors Act and the Land Surveyors (Conduct of\n\nTitle Surveys) Rules.12\n\n        The creation of a folio for land alienated by\n\nthe State under the Land Titles Act involves the conduct of cadastral surveys. The conduct\n\nof a cadastral survey normally involves a 2-step survey process. The first step requires\n\nthe registered surveyor to prepare an assurance plan (also known as an RT Plan) which,\n\npursuant to the Land Surveyors Act, is a plan that shows approximate boundaries or\n\ndimensions and areas for the purpose of identifying land which has not been surveyed to\n\nthe satisfaction of the Chief Surveyor but is required to be surveyed under the provisions\n\nof any written law. As explained by Mr Tan, this is a provisional plan. In this case, a\n\npreliminary survey was carried out. Since there was a party wall and a new substation the\n\nprovisional plan had to be as close to the proposals as possible.13\n\n        The second step requires a registered surveyor\n\nto carry out final title survey and to prepare the Certified Plan. A registered surveyor\n\nhas to carry out survey field work on the ground. There will be planting of traverses,\n\npicking up of boundary marks, refixing of old marks, planting of new marks, checking of\n\nthe party walls, buildings, encroachments and other details. These field data are recorded\n\nin the official Field Book. Next, all field observations and recordings are returned to\n\nthe office of the registered surveyor for checking and for computations. The aim is to\n\nmake sure that the survey circuit of the site closes well and that there has been full\n\ncompliance with the Land Surveyors (Conduct of Title Survey) Rules. In the computations\n\nthe boundaries of each Lot are set out and from them the final area of the Lot is\n\ndetermined. From them, the registered surveyor produces the Certified Plan.14\n\n        Both the RT Plan and the Certified Plan are\n\nprepared and submitted by the registered surveyor to the Chief Surveyor for approval under\n\ns.34 of the Land Surveyors Act.15\n\n        The Chief Surveyor will inspect the RT Plan\n\nsubmitted by the registered surveyor to ensure that the lot numbers of the parcels\n\nindicated on the RT Plan correspond with the provisional lot numbers issued to the\n\nregistered surveyor, the provisional boundaries and areas of the lots are reflected on the\n\nRT Plan and such related data are complete. The accuracy of the RT Plan remains the\n\nresponsibility of the registered surveyor. The boundaries, dimensions and areas of the\n\nlots surveyed are still not conclusive at this stage and are subject to final title\n\nsurvey.16\n\n        Once the RT Plan is approved by the Chief\n\nSurveyor, copies of the RT Plan will be forwarded to the Commissioner of Lands and the\n\nRegistrar of Titles by the Chief Surveyor. Where the boundaries and dimensions of the land\n\nare not conclusive and are subject to final title survey, the Registrar of Titles will,\n\npursuant to s.16 of the Land Titles Act, enter a caution on the new folio created for the\n\nland. This caution is subsequently lifted when the boundaries and dimensions shown in the\n\nCertified Plan filed with the Chief Surveyor have been approved as conclusive by the Chief\n\nSurveyor.17\n\n        In the present case, on or about the 18\n\nSeptember 1995, the Chief Surveyor received a Requisition for Survey No. 419/95 from the\n\nCommissioner of Lands in respect of Parcels 1 to 18 of Conservation Shophouses at Pagoda\n\nStreet.18\n\n        Consequently, the Chief Surveyor wrote to\n\ninform the Director (Land Administration), Urban Redevelopment Authority to engage a\n\nprivate registered surveyor to conduct the title survey under the provisions of the Land\n\nSurveyors Act.19\n\n        On or about 4 July 1996, the Chief Surveyor\n\ninformed the appointed registered surveyor, Mr Tan Eng Fei of M/s EF Tan & Associates\n\nConsulting & Registered Surveyors (the \"said registered surveyor\") of the\n\nallocation of provisional lot numbers for Parcels 1 to 18 of the Conservation Shophouses\n\nat Pagoda Street and requested him to submit the RT Plan immediately.20\n\n        The said registered surveyor submitted his RT\n\nPlan on 1 August 1996. However, due to some queries raised, he was required to redraw the\n\nRT Plan.21\n\n        On or about 24 September 1996, the said\n\nregistered surveyor was informed that RT Plan 11811 submitted by him for Lots 425N to\n\n446M, Town Subdivision 6 (the \"subject lots\") being the provisional lot numbers\n\nallocated for Parcels 1 to 18 of the Conservation Shophouses at Pagoda Street had been\n\napproved by the Chief Surveyor on 23 September 1996.The provisional area of Lot 444L\n\n(being the lot number provisionally assigned to Land Parcel 18 of the Conservation\n\nShophouses at Pagoda Street) under the approved RT Plan was 187 square metres.The RT\n\nPlan also carried a note that the boundaries and areas shown are provisional and subject\n\nto alteration on final survey.22\n\n        On or about 8 October 1996, the Chief Surveyor\n\nforwarded copies of the approved RT Plan to both the Commissioner of Lands and the\n\nRegistrar of Titles for them to issue the State leases and the Certificates of Titles\n\nrespectively for the subject lots. The Certificate of Title in respect of Lot 444L was\n\nsubsequently issued with a caution \"The BOUNDARIES and DIMENSIONS of the within land\n\nare inconclusive and are subject to survey\" and the provisional area indicated\n\ntherein was 187 square metres.23\n\n        On or about 5 December 1996, the said\n\nregistered surveyor notified the Chief Surveyor by letter that he would commence final\n\ntitle survey for the subject lots on 10 December 1996.24\n\n        Under s.35(1) of the Land Surveyors Act, a\n\nregistered surveyor who prepares and signs an assurance plan has to complete the final\n\ntitle survey within 6 months of the Chief Surveyor’s approval of the assurance plan.\n\nUnder this provision, however, the registered surveyor may apply for extension of time to\n\ncomplete the title survey. The Chief Surveyor may in his discretion grant or refuse\n\nextensions.25\n\n        The said registered surveyor applied for\n\nextensions of time to complete the title survey. The applications for extension of time\n\nwere granted.26\n\n        On or about 26 January 1998, the said\n\nregistered surveyor submitted the final title survey to the Chief Surveyor for approval\n\nbut this was rejected on or about 27 January 1998 on the grounds that the fees payable\n\nwere not fully paid and their calculations were incorrect. On or about 3 February 1998,\n\nthe said registered surveyor re-submitted the final title survey to the Chief Surveyor. In\n\nthe course of inspecting the final title survey submitted by the said registered surveyor,\n\nvarious queries were raised by the Chief Surveyor. The said registered surveyor attended\n\nto the queries raised and re-submitted the final title survey on 6 November 1998.27\n\n        The final title survey submitted in respect of\n\nthe subject lots (as shown on Certified Plan CP 31200) was finally approved by the Chief\n\nSurveyor on 10 December 1998.28\n\n        Following this, on or about 19 December 1998,\n\nthe Chief Surveyor forwarded the title plans and Certificate of Title plans (both of which\n\nwere reproduced from the Certified Plan submitted by the said registered surveyor) to the\n\nCommissioner of Lands and the Registrar of Titles.29\n\n        The Registrar of Titles subsequently lifted the\n\ncaution on the subject lots and entered the area of 213.3 square metres on the Certificate\n\nof Title to Lot 444L.30\n\n        On 18 October 1999 URA notified the defendants\n\nthat the final surveyed area is 213.3 square metres and that under clause 9 the sum\n\npayable was $588,983.10. Although the sum was payable within 14 days, URA offered the\n\ndefendants payment of the same by 12 monthly instalments. The defendants in reply stated\n\nthat they were surprised by the increase of 18.6% . As this sum was out with their budget,\n\nthey offered to pay $250,000 in settlement. This offer was not accepted. As no payment was\n\nmade this action was commenced.31\n\n        In these proceedings, counsel for the\n\ndefendants raised 3 defences and a submission about the defendants’ liability to pay\n\nthe GST. I turn to them in that order.32\n\n        First, as a matter of interpretation of the\n\nphrase \"Government survey or resurvey\" in clause 9(b) of the agreement refers\n\nonly to one survey, namely the Title Survey and not necessarily to the final survey. If\n\nthis submission is valid, then it must follow that the provisional area of 187 square\n\nmetres as highlighted in paragraph 21 of this judgment would apply. There would therefore\n\nbe no adjustment of the tendered sale price and the plaintiff’s claims must fail.\n\nCounsel in support of his contention made the following points. He asked the court to\n\nconstrue the phrase in a commercial setting, as this was after all a commercial bargain.\n\nHe submitted that the plaintiff is seeking to add the word \"final\" to the\n\nphrase. That is wholly unnecessary. He pointed out that this was a State alienation after\n\nthe building agreement had been complied with by the defendants. They were issued a Lease\n\nunder section 11(2) of the State Lands Act, Cap 314. Counsel for the defendants further\n\npointed out that there were in fact two surveys, namely the assurance survey and the final\n\nsurvey. The former usually would be completed by a registered surveyor within 8 weeks and\n\nthe latter within 6 months. He submitted that \"for all practical purposes there were\n\ntwo surveys to be done.\" The evidence I have heard to the effect that there was one\n\ncontinuous survey, according to counsel for the defendants, satisfies only the technical\n\npeople. It had no commercial meaning. He noted that section 35 of the Land Surveyors Act\n\nrequired a registered surveyor who signs the assurance plan to go on inexorably and\n\ncomplete the final survey. But that he submitted was no reason to incorporate statutory\n\nprovisions into the agreement to support the view that only the final survey is meant. He\n\nsubmitted, by way of summary, that neither the statutory regime governing surveys nor the\n\nprovisions in the Land Titles Act which regulate the issue of Certificates of Title have\n\nany bearing on the meaning of the phrase \"Government survey or resurvey\".33\n\n        I find myself, with respect, unable to accept\n\nthese submissions. The basic weakness running through all these submissions is the failure\n\nto look at the text and context of the phrase in the entire agreement. The aim and purpose\n\nof the entire clause is to ascertain the final and not any provisional area of the\n\nShophouses for the adjustment of the tendered sale price. It is made abundantly clear that\n\nthe scheduled area is an estimate. It is known to all, and it was cautioned time and\n\nagain, that the RT Plan only showed the estimated area. In practice and under the Land\n\nSurveyors Act, the final area is the one submitted by a professional registered surveyor\n\nand approved by the Chief Surveyor whose statutory duty is to ensure the accuracy of the\n\nrelevant survey data. I am satisfied that the intention behind the phrase as expressed in\n\nclause 9 is to ascertain the final area of the Shophouses for the purpose of any upward or\n\ndownward adjustment of the price. The provisional area stated in the RT Plan is just as\n\nprovisional as that stated in the planimetric plan and it does not make any commercial\n\nsense for businessman to determine an adjustment on what is essentially the same estimate.\n\nWith respect to counsel for the defendants, I have to say that there can only be a\n\nsensible interpretation of the phrase in any context if reference is made to the Land\n\nSurveyors Act and, on most occasions, to the Land Titles Act.34\n\n        The next submission was that the\n\ndefendants’ obligations to pay the adjusted price was extinguished upon the\n\nregistration of the transfer by virtue of section 66 of the Land Titles Act. That section\n\nreads as follows:\"66. All obligations created\n\n    by a contract for the sale of registered land shall, upon registration of the transfer\n\n    giving effect to the contract, be deemed to have merged in that transfer unless express\n\n    provision in writing is made to the contrary.\"35\n\n        As pointed out by the State Counsel, section\n\n66, which preserves the common law rule on merger, is not an absolute rule. This has been\n\nheld inACS Computer Pte Ltd v Rubina Watch Co.[1998] 1 SLR 72which was approved\n\nby the Court of Appeal inWoon Wee Hao v Coastland Realty Pte Ltd[1998] 3 SLR 885.\n\nI agree with him that a convenient point for consideration would be the case ofKnight\n\nSugar Company Ltd v The Alberta Railway & Irrigation Company[1938] 1 All ER 266,\n\n269E:\"But it is well settled that, where parties enter into an executory agreement which\n\n    is to be carried out by a deed afterwards to be executed, the real completed contract is\n\n    to be found in the deed…The most common instance, perhaps, of this merger is a\n\n    contract for sale of land followed by a conveyance on completion. All the provisions of\n\n    the contract which the parties intend should be performed by the conveyance are merged in\n\n    the conveyance, and all rights of the purchaser in relation thereto are thereby satisfied.\n\n    There may, no doubt, be provisions of the contract which, from their nature, or from the\n\n    terms of the contract, survive after completion. An instance may be found in Palmer v\n\n    Johnson, in which it was held that a purchaser could, after conveyance, rely upon a\n\n    provision of the contract and obtain compensation. The foundation of this decision was\n\n    that, upon the construction of the contract, the provision for compensation applied after\n\n    completion. In other words, the parties did not intend it to be performed by the\n\n    subsequent deed, and it was therefore not satisfied by, or merged in, that deed\".36\n\n        In the present case, the parties intended, upon\n\nthe construction of the agreement, that the adjustment of the sale price shall take place\n\nafter the final survey is carried out and the final area is determined and that the\n\nadjustment shall take place even if the Lease and the Certificate of Title with the\n\ncaution are issued. The Certificate of title contained the caution to the effect that the\n\narea stated in it was provisional and that instrument, apart from stating that the area\n\nwas provisional, did nothing else to extinguish the rights of the parties under clause 9\n\nof the agreement.37\n\n        The third submission is the plea of time bar\n\nand the defendants rely on section 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act Cap. 163 which provides\n\nthat an action founded on a contract shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years\n\nfrom the date on which the cause of action accrued. Counsel for the defendants submitted\n\nthat the right of the plaintiff to make a claim for adjustment arose at the date of the\n\ncontract, i.e. on 22 August 1995 or soon thereafter. He submitted that the plaintiff could\n\nhave surveyed the site within a week or two from that date. According to him, the action\n\nwas therefore barred by mid-September 2001, which was over two months before the writ in\n\nthe present case was filed on 7 November 2001. As noted earlier, the period for a final\n\nsurvey, which has the two stages of the RT Plan survey and the final survey, can straddle\n\nmore than 6 months under the Land Surveyors Act. On that basis, the defendants’\n\nreliance on the plea of time bar has no prospects at all.38\n\n        For the proposition that time began to run from\n\nthe date of the contract on 22 August, 1995 counsel for the defendants rely onDonaldson\n\nv Hemmant[1901] 11 Q.L.R. 35. In that case, there was a sale at an auction for\n\ncertain allotments of land which, prior to the sale, had been marked on the ground with\n\ncorner pegs bearing identifications and showing the position of the roads laid out. The\n\nconditions of sale contained a provision for compensation for errors in description or\n\nparticulars. It appeared that the plan alleged to be referred to in the sale note did not\n\naccurately delineate the allotments as marked on the ground by the pegs. 9 years after the\n\nsale, but before the transfer, the plaintiff in that case brought an action against the\n\ndefendant claiming rescission or damages on the ground of misdescription which resulted in\n\na deficiency in the area. But, not unexpectedly, the claim was held to be time-barred\n\nbecause the vendor’s misdescription occurred at the time of the sale. Therefore the\n\ncause of action arose from the date of the contract. In my view,Donaldson v Hemmantis of no authority for the proposition that in a sale of land where compensation is sought\n\ntime runs from the date of the contract. The present case contemplates an adjustment in\n\nthe price, either upwards or downwards, and respectively in favour of the plaintiff or the\n\ndefendants, and if there is no payment or refund then there is a breach, which would only\n\nthereupon give rise to a cause of action.39\n\n        Finally, I turn the question whether the\n\ndefendants are liable to pay the GST. Under clause 25 (c) of the Conditions of Tender, the\n\ndefendants agree that they shall \"forthwith pay on demand … whatever amount(s)\n\nof GST charged or chargeable in relation to the lease of the land parcel … by the\n\nAuthority to the (defendants)\". The defendants’ liability to pay is therefore\n\nclear beyond argument.40\n\n        Accordingly, there will be judgment for the\n\nplaintiff as claimed with costs.Sgd:Lai Kew ChaiJudgeSingaporeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
