        "Introduction": "1.\n\n        The Plaintiff Swiss Singapore Overseas\n\nEnterprises Pte Ltd (‘Swiss Singapore’) applied for a mandatory injunction to\n\ncompel the Defendant Navalmar U.K. Ltd (‘Navalmar’) whether by itself or its\n\nagents in Singapore SSC Shipping Agencies Pte Ltd (‘SSC Shipping’) to issue\n\neight bills of lading, the drafts of which were attached to Schedule 1 of the application,\n\nin exchange for nine existing bills of lading issued by SSC Shipping for and on behalf of\n\nthe Master of the vessel MV Zurbaran (‘the Vessel’). The primary difference was\n\nthat the words ‘Freight To Collect’ were marked on the existing bills whereas\n\nthe new bills were to have the words ‘Freight Prepaid’. There were also other\n\ndifferences which I shall elaborate on later. After hearing arguments, I granted the\n\nmandatory injunction, although not exactly on the terms sought by Swiss Singapore.\n\nNavalmar has appealed to the Court of Appeal against my decision.Background2.        \n\nSwiss Singapore claims that by a contract dated 9 May 2002, it had purchased a cargo of\n\n10,000 metric tonne of Indonesian Merbau Timber from UD Menara Mas of Indonesia\n\n(‘UDMM’) for a total value of US$1.35 million. On or about 13 August 2002, UDMM\n\nentered into a fixture note with Navalmar for the hire of the Vessel to carry the cargo\n\nfrom Sorong, Indonesia to Chennai, India. Swiss Singapore is not a party to the fixture\n\nnote but the material terms thereof state:‘100% freight to be remitted\n\n    by telegraphic transfer by Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises Pte Ltd, Singapore for and\n\n    behalf of Charterer into Owner’s nominated bank account within 3 banking days of\n\n    completion of loading and signing/releasing freight….Owners to appoint a Singapore\n\n    agent free of charge to Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises Pte Ltd to issue a second set\n\n    freight prepaid BSL against an LOI as per Owner’s format which to be signed by their\n\n    authorised signatory.’3.        \n\n1,252 pieces of the cargo was loaded at Sorong between 3 September 2002 and 4 October 2002\n\nand the nine bills of lading with the words ‘Freight To Collect’ were issued by\n\nSSC Shipping for and on behalf of the Master of the Vessel.4.        On\n\n16 October 2002, Mary Vijay of Swiss Singapore sent an e-mail to Captain Priya of Navalmar\n\nstating:‘WE ARE ARRANGING TO PAY THE\n\n    FREIGHT TODAY. PLEASE ADVISE YOUR AGENTS IN SINGAPORE TO RELEASE SWITCH B/L TO US AGAINST\n\n    FAX COPY OF TELEX REMITTANCE OF FREIGHT WITH A COPY TO US. ALSO PLEASE ADVISE THE POSITION\n\n    OF VESSEL HER ETA CHENNAI ETC.’5.        This\n\nwas followed by a handwritten fax to Captain Priya stating:‘\n\n                                                              \n\n    To: Capt. PriyaRef. our telecon today. We have\n\n    still not read your confirmation on above message. Please advise your agents details to\n\n    whom we have to get the B/L Switched. Due to your not receipt of your confirmation of\n\n    above matter and not confirmation of ETA of the vessel the freight payment is delayed.\n\n    Your urgent confirmation is awaited to pay the freight.Thanks.Mary.’6.        On\n\nFriday 18 October 2002, Capt Priya sent an e-mail in response stating:‘KINDLY NOTE THAT YOU HAVE\n\n    STILL NOT PAID THE OCEAN FREIGHT.WE CANNOT SWITCH THE B/L (sic)UNTILL WE DO(sic)NOT RECEIVE THE FREIGHT INTO OUR ACCOUNT.VESSEL SAILED FROM BINTULU THIS\n\n    MORNING AND WILL CALL TUTIFIRST TO DISCHARGE 4700 CBM LOGS\n\n    AND THEN CALL AT CHENNAI.WE EXPECT VESSEL TO ARRIVE\n\n    CHENNAI ON/ABOUT THE 28/29 TH OF OCTOBER AGW WP.KINDLY EXPEDITE FRT\n\n    PAYMENT.’7.        On\n\nMonday 21 October 2002, Mary Vijay sent an e-mail to Capt Priya stating:‘THANKS FOR YOUR BELOW\n\n    MESSAGE. KINDLY SEND A MESSAGE CONFIRMING THAT SINGAPORE SHIPPING WILL BE SWITCHING THE\n\n    B/L TO US AGAINST TELEX COPY CONFIRMING OF FREIGHT PAYMENT MADE TO YOU. WE NEED THISVERY\n\n    URGENTLYAS WEDO NOT WANT ANY CONFUSION OR DELAYIN GETTING THE B/L SWITCHED.\n\n    WE WILL ONLY TAKE THE SWITCH B/L FROM YOUR AGENT AFTER PAYMENT OF FREIGHT. HENCE YOURCONFIRMATION\n\n    TO US REQUIRED VERY URGENTLY.’[Emphasis added.]8.        An\n\ne-mail of the same date was sent in reply to Mary Vijay stating:‘weconfirmthat\n\n    bills of lading will switched by Singapore shippingupon receiptof frt remittance\n\n    advise. kindly note thatdelay is on your accountdue to non payment of freight,\n\n    otherwisethis could have been done 10 days ago.’[Emphasis added.]9.        On\n\nthe very same day, Swiss Singapore arranged for payment of the freight of about US$258,000\n\nand Mary Vijay sent an e-mail to Capt Priya to forward the telex confirmation of payment\n\nand eight drafts of bills of lading with an urgent request that Navalmar instruct SSC\n\nShipping to sign and release the new bills.10.        \n\nEight days later, on 29 October 2002, Swiss Singapore’s solicitors, Haridass Ho &\n\nPartners (‘Haridass’) sent an urgent chaser by fax to Navalmar to point out that\n\nNavalmar had confirmed in its e-mail dated 21 October 2002 that the bills of lading would\n\nbe switched upon receipt of remittance for the freight and notwithstanding such\n\nremittance, Navalmar had refused to instruct SSC Shipping to issue the new bills. They\n\nalso pointed out that without the new bills, Swiss Singapore would not be able to\n\nnegotiate the letter of credit issued in their favour by their Indian buyers and their\n\nIndian buyers could not arrange customs and other clearance. The penultimate paragraph of\n\nthe fax put Navalmar on notice that if it failed to instruct SSC Shipping to issue the new\n\nbills by close of office the next day, they would proceed to the courts in Singapore to\n\ncompel Navalmar by injunction to instruct its Singapore agents (i.e SSC Shipping) to issue\n\nthe new bills.11.        In\n\nresponse, English solicitors Michael Lloyd & Co (‘Michael Lloyd’), acting\n\nfor Navalmar, sent a fax reply dated 29 October 2002 asserting that Navalmar was dismayed\n\nat the apparent indifference to an enormous demurrage debt incurred at the load port and\n\nasking what assurance Swiss Singapore could give concerning payment thereof. The demurrage\n\nand related costs was US$187,930. They also sought particulars of the contract between\n\nNavalmar and Swiss Singapore and the contract term regarding the issue of the new bills.12.        \n\nHaridass responded in a fax dated 30 October 2002 pointing out the material terms of the\n\nfixture note and Navalmar’s e-mail dated 21 October 2002 wherein it had confirmed\n\nthat the bills of lading would be switched ‘upon receipt of frt remittance\n\nadvice’ and stressing that Swiss Singapore had paid freight. Haridass warned that if\n\nthe new bills were not issued, Swiss Singapore would be left with no alternative but to\n\nseek the remedy stated in their earlier fax and asked Michael Lloyd to revert by the\n\nopening of Haridass’ office the next day.13.        \n\nMichael Lloyd then sent a reply fax dated 30 October 2002, stating that Swiss Singapore\n\nwas not a party to the fixture note and could not seek reliance on it. They also said that\n\n‘It would appear inequitable in any event for them to take advantage of part of the\n\ndocument whilst ignoring other obligations of the shipper set out in it’. Mr Lloyd\n\nalso asked to speak to Mr Haridass but no evidence was given as to whether Mr Lloyd\n\nmanaged to speak to Mr Haridass and what was said in the conversation.",
        "The application for a mandatory\n\ninjunction": "14.        On\n\nFriday 1 November 2002, Swiss Singapore commenced an action in Singapore and filed an ex\n\nparte application for the mandatory injunction which I have mentioned. As the application\n\nwas for a mandatory injunction, I directed its Counsel, Mr R Srivathsan, to forward a copy\n\nof the Writ of Summons, the application and the supporting affidavit to Michael Lloyd and\n\nto SSC Shipping with a cover fax or letter stating that the application had been adjourned\n\nto 10.30 am of 5 November 2002 (as Monday 4 November 2002 was a public holiday in\n\nSingapore). The Vessel was expected to reach Chennai on 5 November 2002.",
        "Arguments": "15.        On\n\nTuesday 5 November 2002, Mr Joseph Tan appeared for Navalmar before me. He sought an\n\nadjournment to the following Monday i.e 11 November 2002 to file an affidavit in response\n\nalthough he had received instructions the previous Saturday afternoon and he had spoken to\n\nLondon solicitors on Sunday and Monday. He was instructed that Navalmar’s e-mail had\n\nbeen sent under pressure otherwise Swiss Singapore would not pay the freight. He was also\n\ninstructed that the export of logs from Indonesia was illegal under Indonesian law.16.        Mr\n\nSrivathsan objected to any adjournment and took me through the e-mail dated 18 October\n\n2002, and the two e-mail dated 21 October 2002 which I have cited in paras 6 to 8 above.17.        Mr\n\nTan did not dispute that freight had been received by Navalmar or that the Vessel was\n\nlikely to reach Chennai on 5 November 2002. He said he had nothing to add in respect of\n\nthe application for an adjournment.18.        I\n\nthen decided to grant an order in terms of the first prayer of the application whereupon\n\nMr Tan produced a draft affidavit of his which he said he would affirm in the afternoon\n\n(which was subsequently extended to 12 pm of the next day). On that basis, I allowed Mr\n\nTan to address me on the merits of the application. Mr Tan raised a number of arguments\n\nand I will deal only with the more substantive ones.19.        Mr\n\nTan’s first argument was that Swiss Singapore was not a party to the fixture note.\n\nThe fixture note was governed by English law although it provided for arbitration in\n\nSingapore. In so far as Swiss Singapore appeared to rely on the English Contract (Rights\n\nof Third Parties) Act 1999 (‘the Act’), which gives rights to third parties, he\n\npointed out that Swiss Singapore had not adduced evidence of English law, such law being a\n\nquestion of fact. On the other hand, Navalmar had obtained a written opinion from an\n\nEnglish Counsel Mr Michael Nolan dated 4 November 2002 to the effect that the Act did not\n\ngive Swiss Singapore the right to enforce the term in the fixture note under which\n\nNavalmar agreed to issue a second set of bills of lading against a letter of indemnity. I\n\nwould add that the letter of indemnity was never raised as an issue previously or by Mr\n\nTan and I need say no more on it.20.        \n\nSecondly, the intended new bills contained different information which Navalmar objected\n\nto. The objections were stated in a fax dated 1 November 2002 from Michael Lloyd to\n\nHaridass i.e (i) there were eight instead of nine bills, (ii) more importantly, the new\n\nbills would acknowledge shipment of a total of 6,301 cbm logs whereas the original bills\n\nreferred to 6,171 cbm, (iii) the new bills would be dated 29 September 2002 whereas the\n\noriginals had various dates between 3 September 2002 and 4 October 2002.21.        \n\nThirdly, if the contract of sale was illegal then Swiss Singapore should not be granted\n\nequitable relief against Navalmar as Swiss Singapore had come to court with unclean hands.\n\nMr Tan said that the cargo could be discharged in Chennai and kept in a godown while the\n\nissue of demurrage is sorted out.22.        \n\nFourthly, Mr Tan submitted that the entire transaction was suspicious. In the past,\n\nNavalmar had dealt only with Swiss Singapore. For the present cargo, Swiss Singapore had\n\nasked Navalmar to charter the Vessel but prior to the conclusion of the charter, Swiss\n\nSingapore said that they would prefer it if Navalmar dealt with UDMM for this particular\n\ntransaction. Navalmar had never dealt with UDMM before and had entered into the\n\ncharterparty with UDMM solely at Swiss Singapore’s request. Accordingly, Swiss\n\nSingapore might be liable for demurrage as undisclosed principal.23.        Mr\n\nSrivathsan did not dispute that Swiss Singapore was not a party to the fixture note. Swiss\n\nSingapore was relying on the Act to give it rights against Navalmar. He took me through\n\nsection 1 of the Act. He also submitted that Swiss Singapore would also rely on the e-mail\n\nas constituting a separate contract as between Navalmar and Swiss Singapore and/or\n\nestoppel.24.        As\n\nfor the different information to be contained in the new bills, they were the requirements\n\nof Swiss Singapore’s purchasers.25.        As\n\nfor illegality, he submitted that Swiss Singapore was the buyer FOB. It was not its\n\nconcern whether the seller has the requisite licence to sell or export the cargo.26.        As\n\nfor the allegation that Swiss Singapore was the undisclosed principal, he denied this on\n\nthe basis that it had bought the cargo from UDMM.",
        "The reasons for my decision": "27.        \n\nSection 1 of the Act provides:‘Right of third party to\n\n    enforce contractual term1.(1) Subject to the provisions\n\n    of this Act, a person who is not a party to a contract (a \"third party\") may in\n\n    his own right enforce a term of the contract if -(a) the contract expressly\n\n      provides that he may, or(b) subject to subsection (2),\n\n      the term purports to confer a benefit on him.(2) Subsection (1)(b) does not\n\n    apply if on a proper construction of the contract it appears that the parties did not\n\n    intend the term to be enforceable by the third party.(3) The third party must be\n\n    expressly identified in the contract by name, as a member of a class or as answering a\n\n    particular description but need not be in existence when the contract is entered into.(4) This section does not confer\n\n    a right on a third party to enforce a term of a contract otherwise than subject to and in\n\n    accordance with any other relevant terms of the contract.(5) For the purpose of exercising\n\n    his right to enforce a term of the contract, there shall be available to the third party\n\n    any remedy that would have been available to him in an action for breach of contract if he\n\n    had been a party to the contract (and the rules relating to damages, injunctions, specific\n\n    performance and other relief shall apply accordingly).(6) ….(7) ….’28.        \n\nSection 6 states:‘6.(1) ….(2) ….(3) Section 1 confers no right on\n\n    a third party to enforce -(a) any term of a contract of\n\n      employment against any employee,(b) any term of a worker’s\n\n      contract against a worker (including a home worker), or(c) any term of a relevant\n\n      contract against an agency worker.(4) ….(5) Section 1 confers no rights\n\n    on a third party in the case of -(a) a contract for the carriage\n\n      of goods by sea, or(b) ….Except that a third party may in\n\n    reliance on that section avail himself of an exclusion or limitation of liability in such\n\n    a contract.(6) In subsection (5)\n\n    \"contract for the carriage of goods by sea\" means a contract of carriage -(a) contained in or evidenced by\n\n      a bill of lading, sea waybill or a corresponding electronic transaction, or(b) under or for the purposes of\n\n      which there is given an undertaking which is contained in a ship’s delivery order of\n\n      a corresponding electronic transaction.’29.        It\n\nis true that Swiss Singapore did not tender any opinion from any English solicitor or\n\ncounsel on the Act but there was evidence from Mr Nolan as to what section 1 and 6 states,\n\nin addition to his opinion thereon. However, Mr Nolan’s opinion was significantly\n\nsilent about the exchange of e-mail.30.        It\n\nseemed to me that Swiss Singapore had a strong case that Navalmar was estopped from\n\ndenying that Swiss Singapore had an enforceable right against it under the fixture note in\n\nrespect of the issuance of new bills or that there was a separate contract between Swiss\n\nSingapore and Navalmar arising from the exchange of the e-mail regarding the issuance of\n\nthe new bills when freight was paid by Swiss Singapore.31.        On\n\nthe latter point, Mr Tan submitted (in his request for further arguments which I declined\n\nto accede to) that the consideration from Swiss Singapore was done for and on behalf of\n\nUDMM and as agent for UDMM. Thus, there was no consideration from Swiss Singapore.\n\nHowever, there was no evidence that Swiss Singapore had paid the freight on behalf of UDMM\n\nor as its agent. He also submitted that the payment of freight was past consideration but,\n\nas Swiss Singapore was not a party to the fixture note, it was, prima facie, not obliged\n\nto pay the freight in the first place.32.        As\n\nregards the second argument on the three discrepancies between the drafts of the new bills\n\nand the originals, I was of the view that this could be overcome by an appropriate order\n\naddressing the objections.33.        As\n\nregards the third argument about illegality, there was no evidence from an Indonesian\n\nlawyer about the illegality let alone Swiss Singapore’s complicity in it. Mr Tan had\n\nrelied solely on what Capt Priya had told him, and Capt Priya had in turn relied on what\n\nNavalmar’s Indonesia agents had said. Even then, Mr Tan could only say that the whole\n\ntransaction ‘may be’ illegal. In any event, the cargo was already no longer in\n\nthe territory of Indonesia and the present dispute was not between buyer and seller. It\n\nseemed to me that Navalmar was not at all concerned about the alleged illegality. It had\n\nnot offered to return the freight paid or to carry the cargo back to Indonesia. On the\n\ncontrary, it was quite prepared to deliver the cargo to Swiss Singapore or its buyers if\n\ndemurrage was paid. It was clear to me that the allegation about illegality was just an\n\nexcuse raised in an attempt to deny Swiss Singapore the relief it had sought.34.        As\n\nregards the fourth argument about Swiss Singapore being the undisclosed principal behind\n\nthe fixture note, Navalmar could still pursue this position even if the mandatory\n\ninjunction was granted.35.        I\n\nwas mindful that a court should be slow in granting a mandatory injunction especially if\n\nit is the substantive relief sought in the action. However, I was of the view that the\n\njustice of the case was clearly in favour of Swiss Singapore, at least in respect of its\n\npresent application.36.        It\n\nis not in dispute that Navalmar was aware that demurrage was outstanding when its two\n\ne-mail dated 18 and 21 October 2002 were sent. It could have remained silent when Swiss\n\nSingapore had sought its confirmation that the new bills would be issued upon payment of\n\nthe freight or it could have informed Swiss Singapore quite openly that the new bills\n\nwould not be issued unless both the freight and demurrage were paid. It did not elect\n\neither of these options. Instead, it gave not one but two confirmations that it would\n\nswitch the bills when the freight was paid. The first confirmation was implied in its\n\ne-mail dated 18 October 2002 and the second was specific in its e-mail dated 21 October\n\n2002. Indeed in its second confirmation, it went so far as to say that the delay in the\n\nswitch was due to non payment of freight and that this could have been done ‘10 days\n\nago’.37.        \n\nNavalmar knew that Swiss Singapore did not want any dispute about the new bills (see again\n\nSwiss Singapore’s e-mail dated 21 October 2002 cited in para 7 above). Yet either it\n\ndeliberately deceived Swiss Singapore into believing that the bills would be switched upon\n\npayment of the freight or it resiled from its position after receiving such payment. Even\n\nafter Navalmar had received evidence of the payment of freight, it did not promptly raise\n\nthe issue of outstanding demurrage with Swiss Singapore as a condition before releasing\n\nthe new bills for eight or more days until Haridass sent its chaser dated 29 October 2002,\n\nas I have mentioned.38.        It\n\nis all very well for Navalmar to take the position that the cargo can be discharged at\n\nChennai and kept at a godown while the issue of demurrage is sorted out. It must be aware\n\nthat this situation would give it the upper hand with a view to causing Swiss Singapore to\n\ncapitulate to its demurrage claim. Having received about US$258,000 as freight, Navalmar\n\nhas, unfortunately, resiled on its word just to obtain payment of approximately\n\nUS$188,000.39.        In\n\nthe circumstances, I had a ‘high degree of assurance’, to use the words of\n\nMegarry J inShepherd Homes Ltd v Sandham[1971] Ch 340, that I should grant a\n\nmandatory injunction. Accordingly, I maintained the thrust of the injunction order I had\n\ngranted but varied it to take into account the three discrepancies raised by Navalmar.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERSINGAPORECopyright © Government of Singapore."
