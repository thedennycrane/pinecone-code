        "Facts": "1 The first accused, Low Sze Song (“Low”), is a 70-year-old male Singaporean. The second accused, Sivaprakash Krishnan (“Sivaprakash”), is a 35-year-old male Malaysian national. The two accused persons each claimed trial to a single charge of trafficking not less than 43.2g of diamorphine under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) and were jointly tried before me. 2 For ease of reference, s 5(1)(a) and s 5(2) of the MDA provide: 5.—(1)    Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore —  (a)    to traffic in a controlled drug;  (b)    to offer to traffic in a controlled drug; or  (c)    to do or offer to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug.  (2)    For the purposes of this Act, a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking. 3 The key facts leading to the arrests of Low and Sivaprakash can be stated briefly. On 30 May 2019, at about 5.40am, Low was at the ground floor of Blk 326A Sumang Walk with his personal mobility device (the “PMD”). At about 6.18am, Sivaprakash approached Sumang Walk on his motorcycle (the “Motorcycle”) and Low and Sivaprakash then travelled together in the same direction on their respective vehicles. At about 6.20am, at a bus stop along Sumang Walk (the “SumangWalk Bus Stop”),1Foot Note 1×Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”) at para 7.Sivaprakash gave Low a white plastic bag containing packets of drugs, and Low gave Sivaprakash a stack of cash totalling S$9,000. The Prosecution’s case is that the white plastic bag contained four packets of drugs containing not less than 43.26g of diamorphine (the “Drug Bundles”) which form the subject matter of the respective charges. Low’s defence, which Sivaprakash aligns himself with, is that there were only three packets of drugs handed over by Sivaprakash to Low and subsequently recovered from the PMD. I deal with this issue later below (at [27]–[86]). 4 Thereafter, Low travelled towards Buangkok Crescent. He was arrested by a party of Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers at the lift lobby of Blk 986C at about 6.45am. The said CNB officers comprised of Assistant Superintendent Muhammad Aliff bin Abdul Rahman, Inspector Eng Chien Loong Eugene, Inspector Tay Cher Yeen Jason (“Insp Jason”), Station Inspector Wong Kah Hung Alwin, Station Inspector Tay Keng Chye Sunny (“SI Sunny”), Sergeant Merabel Lee Yi Shan (“SgtMerabel”), Sergeant Yogaraj s/o Ragunathan Pillay, Sergeant Mohammad Nasrulhaq bin Mohd Zainuddin (“SgtNasrulhaq”), Sergeant Syazwan bin Daud Mohamed, Sergeant Muhammad Fauzi bin Mohamed Said (“SgtFauzi”) and Senior Staff Sergeant Muhammad Fardlie bin Ramlie.2Foot Note 2×ASOF at para 3. 5 Sometime between Low’s arrest at 6.45am and 8.01am, Insp Jason performed a thorough search of the PMD (after having first performed a preliminary search of the PMD, see [34] below) and several exhibits were seized and recovered. The following table sets out the markings of the exhibits recovered from the PMD (which was marked as location ‘A’): Description and Marking of ExhibitDescription and Marking of sub-ExhibitDescription and Marking of sub-sub-ExhibitA1One black “Fiido Electric Scooter” bagA1AOne black taped packaging with clear plasticA1A1One clear plasticA1A1AOne packet of brown granular substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 8.64g of diamorphineA1BOne white plastic bagA1B1One clear plastic packaging with black tapeA1B1AOne clear plasticA1B1A1One packet of brown granular substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 14.47g of diamorphineA1B2One clear plastic packaging with black tapeA1B2AOne clear plasticA1B2A1One packet of brown granular substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 14.12g of diamorphineA1B3One black taped packaging with clear plasticA1B3AOne clear plasticA1B3A1One packet of brown granular substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 6.03g of diamorphine 6 As noted above at [3], Low disputes that the exhibit ‘A1A1A’ was among the case exhibits recovered from the PMD and processed in his view at the CNB Exhibit Management Room (“EMR”). 7 Meanwhile, Sivaprakash had headed towards his workplace at Sungei Kadut Way. Another party of CNB officers followed him to a canteen along 16A Sungei Kadut Way. They arrested him at about 6.49am.3Foot Note 3×Prosecution’s Closing Submissions dated 25 October 2022 (“PCS”) at para 4.The said CNB officers comprised of Assistant Superintendent Muhammad Faizal bin Baharin (“ASP Faizal”), Station Inspector Mohamed Fadli bin Mohamed Sayee, Station Inspector Mohammed Nabil bin Shahar (“SI Nabil”), Station Inspector Arif Azfar bin A’zman, Senior Staff Sergeant Mohamed Sohail bin Abdul Aleem (“SSgtSohail”), Senior Staff Sergeant Ee Guo Dong Marcus, Staff Sergeant Rajendren Janani (“SSgt Janani”), Staff Sergeant Shah Zali bin Mohamed Salleh and Sergeant See Yong Han Sebastian.4Foot Note 4×ASOF at para 4. 8 At about 6.50am, SSgt Sohail conducted a search in Sivaprakash’s presence on the Motorcycle and recovered the stack of cash totalling S$9,000.5Foot Note 5×PCS at para 4; ASOF at para 22.The following table sets out the markings of the exhibits recovered from the Motorcycle (which was marked as location ‘E’): Description and Marking of ExhibitDescription and Marking of sub-ExhibitE1One black haversackE1AOne stack of cash amounting to S$9,000, tied with two rubber bands 9 In the course of investigations, six statements were recorded from Low between 30 May 2019 and 23 January 2020:6Foot Note 6×ASOF at para 50. (a) On the day of the arrest, SI Sunny recorded a contemporaneous statement pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) at about 8.01am (Low’s “Contemporaneous Statement”).7Foot Note 7×Agreed Bundle (“AB”) at p 104 – 114.Photos were shown to Low and appended to Low’s Contemporaneous Statement, including photos of Exhibits ‘A1B’, ‘A1B2’ and ‘A1B1’. (b) On the same day, Deputy Superintendent Yang Weili (“IOWeili”) recorded a cautioned statement pursuant to s 23 of the CPC at about 11.14pm (Low’s “Cautioned Statement”). Low spoke in Hokkien and this was translated by the interpreter, Mr Wong Png Leong (“Mr Wong”). (c) IO Weili subsequently recorded four long statements pursuant to s 22 of the CPC (collectively, Low’s “Long Statements”), namely, on 2 June 2019 at about 1.35pm (Low’s “First Long Statement”), on 3 June 2019 at about 10.03am (Low’s “Second Long Statement”), on 6 June 2019 at about 2.47pm (Low’s “Third Long Statement”) respectively. For all of Low’s Long Statements, he spoke in Hokkien and these were translated by Mr Wong. Photos were shown to Low and appended to his Second Long Statement, including photos of Exhibits ‘A1B’ (the white plastic bag), ‘A1A1A’, ‘A1B1A1’, ‘A1B2A1’ and ‘A1B3A1’ (collectively, the Drug Bundles). (d) Inspector Vinod s/o Pannerchilvam (“IO Vinod”) subsequently recorded one long statement pursuant to s 22 of the CPC on 23 January 2020 at about 10.41am (Low’s “Fourth Long Statement”). Low spoke in Hokkien and this was translated by the interpreter, Mr Wong. 10 Low does not dispute that these statements were voluntarily provided by him and accurately recorded by the respective CNB officers. 11 In the course of investigations, six statements were recorded from Sivaprakash between 30 May 2019 and 23 January 2020:8Foot Note 8×ASOF at para 52. (a) On the day of the arrest, SI Nabil recorded a contemporaneous statement pursuant to s 22 of the CPC at about 8.00am (Sivaprakash’s “Contemporaneous Statement”). Both SI Nabil and Sivaprakash spoke in Malay and this was later translated into English by a CNB language officer, Mr Mohammed Syafiq Bin Mohammed Said. (b) On the same day, Senior Staff Sergeant Huang Weilun (whose rank was Station Inspector by the time of the trial) (“SI Huang”) recorded a cautioned statement pursuant to s 23 of the CPC at about 10.45pm (Sivaprakash’s “Cautioned Statement”). Sivaprakash spoke in Tamil and this was translated by the interpreter, Mdm Vengadasalam Susila (“MdmSusila”). (c) IO Weili subsequently recorded three long statements pursuant to s 22 of the CPC (collectively, Sivaprakash’s “Long Statements”), namely, on 2 June 2019 at about 7.07pm (Sivaprakash’s “First Long Statement”), on 3 June 2019 at about 2.35pm (Sivaprakash’s “Second Long Statement”), and on 6 June 2019 at about 9.46am (Sivaprakash’s “ThirdLong Statement”) respectively. For all of Sivaprakash’s Long Statements, he spoke in Tamil and these were translated by Mdm Susila. Photos were shown to Sivaprakash and appended to his Long Statements, including photos of Exhibits ‘A1B’ (the white plastic bag), ‘A1A1A’, ‘A1B1A1’, ‘A1B2A1’ and ‘A1B3A1’ (collectively, the Drug Bundles). (d) IO Vinod subsequently recorded one long statement pursuant to s 22 of the CPC on 15 January 2020 at about 10.44am (Sivaprakash’s “Fourth Long Statement”). Sivaprakash spoke in Tamil and this was translated by the interpreter, Mdm Vijaya Thavamary Abraham. 12 Apart from Sivaprakash’s Contemporaneous Statement, the recording of which he disputes (see below at [83]–[84]), Sivaprakash does not dispute that the other statements set out at [11] were voluntarily provided by him and accurately recorded by the respective CNB officers. 13 InMuhammadRidzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters[2014] 3 SLR 721 (at [59]), the Court of Appeal summarised the three elements of an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA as follows: (a) possession of a controlled drug – which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(1) of the MDA; (b) knowledge of the natureof the drug – which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA; and (c) proof that possession of the drug was for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised. 14 I start by dealing with element (c). Low and Sivaprakash cannot, in my view, dispute9Foot Note 9×PCS at para 75; First Accused’s Submissions dated 25 October 2022 (“D1 CS”) at para 2 (Low); PCS at para 30; Second Accused’s Reply to Prosecution’s Closing Submissions dated 18 November 2022 (“D2 Reply”) at para 10(ii) (Sivaprakash).that the Drug Bundles were for the purpose of trafficking. It is undisputed that Low intended to deliver the white plastic bag containing the Drug Bundles to someone who would be waiting for him at Blk 986C Buangkok Crescent.10Foot Note 10×PCS at para 75; D1 CS at para 10; NE 16082022 at p 27 ln 8 – p 28 ln 20, p 49 ln 1 – 11; NE 17082022 at p 35 ln 17 – p 36 ln 12.Sivaprakash consistently admitted in his Cautioned Statement, his First Long Statement and at trial that he had handed over the white plastic bag containing the Drug Bundles to Low at the Sumang Way Bus Stop.11Foot Note 11×PCS at para 30; AB at p 202; AB at p 227, para 9; NE 2508222 at p 24 ln 8 – 28 and p 31 ln 13 – 28.Sivaprakash denies that he had done so for the purposes of trafficking and asserts that he had merely been acting “as requested of him” by someone known to him as “Joe” (“Joe”), his Malaysian friend who had requested for his help in collecting anddeliveringthe contents of the white plastic bag.12Foot Note 12×Closing Submissions of the Second Accused dated 25 October 2022 (“D2CS”) at para 29(e).However, the definition of “traffic” under s 2 of the MDA is clear and provides: “traffic” means —  (a)      to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or  (b)    to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a),  otherwise than under the authority of this Act, and “trafficking” has a corresponding meaning 15 On his own case, Sivaprakash delivered the Drug Bundles to Low within the meaning of s 2 of the MDA. 16 Therefore, the case before me turns on the first two elements listed above (at [13]).",
        "The parties’ cases": "",
        "Possession of the drugs": "17 The Prosecution relies on the presumption of possession under s 18(1)(a) of the MDA in respect of both Low and Sivaprakash and that, in any case, they each had actual possession of the Drug Bundles.13Foot Note 13×PCS at para 31 (in relation to Sivaprakash), paras 58 and 63 (in relation to Low).Low disputes the chain of custody of the Drug Bundles. According to Low, there were only three and not four packets of drugs handed over by Sivaprakash to him and subsequently recovered from the PMD.14Foot Note 14×D1 CS at para 40.Low further raises the possibility that exhibits from another case were mistaken for the fourth packet of drugs (ie,the exhibit marked ‘A1A1A’) seized in this case.15Foot Note 15×D1 CS at para 63. 18 After hearing the trial testimonies of Low and what has been referred to as “the CNB officers involved regarding the chain of custody of the drugs”, Sivaprakash aligns himself with Low’s position on this issue.16Foot Note 16×D2 CS at para 29(b).He also argues that he was in possession of “paan parak” and not the Drug Bundles.17Foot Note 17×D2 CS at para 29(a).According to him, he had picked up “paan parak” and not the Drug Bundles from a bus stop near the Tuas checkpoint on the instructions of “Joe”, put them into the white plastic bag and handed them over to Low.",
        "Knowledge of the nature of the Drug Bundles": "19 The Prosecution relies on the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA in relation to both Low and Sivaprakash. Low’s defence is that he did not check the contents of the white plastic bag handed to him by Sivaprakash and had no knowledge of the nature of the Drug Bundles.18Foot Note 18×D1 CS at para 73.Sivaprakash claims that he did not know that he was delivering the Drug Bundles as he thought that he was delivering what he claimed to be “paan parak”, on “Joe’s” instructions.19Foot Note 19×D2 CS at para 29(d).",
        "Issues to be determined": "20 In light of the statutory requirements of s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA and the parties’ cases, the issues (and sub-issue) that arise for my consideration are: (a) whether Low and Sivaprakash respectively had possession of the Drug Bundles (the “Possession Issues”); (i) in particular, whether there is a reasonable doubt that the exhibit ‘A1A1A’ analysed by the Health Sciences Authority (the “HSA”) to contain not less than 8.64g of diamorphine was the same drug exhibit seized from the PMD (the “Chain of Custody Sub-issue”); and (b) whether Low and Sivaprakash respectively had no knowledge of the nature of the Drug Bundles (the“Knowledge Issues”). 21 Additionally, the final issue that arises for my consideration is whether Low and Sivaprakash respectively can be considered a “courier” pursuant to s 33B(2) of the MDA for the purposes of sentencing. 22 The parties’ specific submissions on each issue will be dealt with below in the relevant portions of the grounds dealing with the particular issue or sub-issue.",
        "Whether Low and Sivaprakash respectively had possession of the Drug Bundles": "",
        "Parties’ arguments": "23 The Prosecution relies on the presumption of possession under s 18(1)(a) of the MDA in respect of both Low and Sivaprakash and that, in any case, they each had actual possession of the Drug Bundles.20Foot Note 20×PCS at para 31 (in relation to Sivaprakash), paras 58 and 63 (in relation to Low).The Prosecution argues that, by virtue of s 18(1)(a) of the MDA, Sivaprakash was presumed to have possession of the Drug Bundles as he must have been in possession of the white plastic bag containing the Drug Bundles to be able to give it to Low. In any case, the Prosecution submits that he had actual possession of the Drug Bundles and this is corroborated by Sivaprakash’s DNA found on the tape and cling film used to wrap exhibits ‘A1A1A’, ‘A1B1A1’, ‘A1B2A1’ and ‘A1B3A1’ (ie, the Drug Bundles).21Foot Note 21×PCS at para 31. 24 The Prosecution also argues that, by virtue of s 18(1)(a) of the MDA, Low was presumed to have possession of the Drug Bundles as he had received the white plastic bag from Sivaprakash and knew that it contained items,22Foot Note 22×PCS at para 58.and placed the white plastic bag and its contents in the black “Fiido Electric Scooter” bag in the PMD. Furthermore, Low cannot rebut the presumption of possession under s 18(1)(a) of the MDA by claiming that he had placed the white plastic bag and its contents in a red bagbeforeplacing these items into the black “Fiido Electric Scooter” bag. In any case, the Prosecution submits that Low had actual possession of the white plastic bag and its contents and this is corroborated by Low’s DNA found on the interior and exterior of the white plastic bag, as well as the adhesive sides of the taped packaging marked ‘A1A’ which contained the bundle of drugs marked ‘A1A1A’.23Foot Note 23×PCS at paras 58 – 63. 25 Sivaprakash disputes possession of the Drug Bundles on the basis that the Drug Bundles were not found in his possession.24Foot Note 24×D2 CS at para 30.He also argues that he was in possession of “paan parak” and not the Drug Bundles.25Foot Note 25×D2 CS at para 29(a).However, it is clear that he cannot rebut the presumption of possession under s 18(1)(a) of the MDA for the reasons stated above (at [23]). His own evidence is that he had collected several packets which later turned out to be the Drug Bundles from a torn black bag at the bus stop near the Tuas checkpoint, transferred them into a white plastic bag and handed them over to Low.26Foot Note 26×D2 CS at para 28. 26 Low disputes possession by challenging the integrity of the chain of custody of the Drug Bundles. As noted above (at [18]), Sivaprakash also adopts Low’s position, namely, that only three and not four packets of drugs were handed over by Sivaprakash to Low and subsequently recovered from the PMD.27Foot Note 27×D1 CS at para 40; D2 CS at para 29(b).Low and Sivaprakash allege that the exhibit ‘A1A1A’ (the “Fourth Drug Bundle”), which is one packet of brown granular substance analysed by the HSA to contain not less than 8.64g of diamorphine, was not in fact recovered from the PMD.",
        "Sub-issue: Whether there is a reasonable doubt as to the integrity of the chain of custody of the drug exhibit ‘A1A1A’": "27 The principles in relation to establishing the chain of custody are trite. The Prosecution must account for the movement of the exhibits from the point of seizure to analysis, such that there cannot be a single moment that is unaccounted forifthis gives rise to a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the exhibits or exhibit in question:MohamedAffandi bin Rosli v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2019] 1 SLR 440 (“MohamedAffandi”) at [39]. 28 Additionally, counsel for Sivaprakash refers me to several authorities for the proposition that the Prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is thus entitled to an acquittalifthere arises a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.28Foot Note 28×D2 CS at para 5.What is required is aqualitativeappreciation of whether a reasonable doubt has arisen. A “reasonable doubt”, as opposed to a “merely fanciful” doubt, is “a doubt for which one can give a reason, so long as the reason givenis logically connected to the evidence” [emphasis added]:Jagatheesans/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 (“Jagatheesan”) at [53], affirmed inPublic Prosecutor v GCK and another matter[2020] 1 SLR 486 at [131]. Reasonable doubt could also arise by virtue of the lack of evidence submitted, where such evidence is necessary to support the Prosecution’s theory of guilt:Jagatheesanat [61]. 29 I am not satisfied that a reasonable doubt has been raised as to the identity of the Fourth Drug Bundle, after carefully sifting and reasoning through the evidence that was led in this case. I explain. Search and recovery of the four drug exhibits from the PMD 30 Low disagrees with the Prosecution that the PMD was searched in his presence and that the Fourth Drug Bundle was recovered from the PMD. There is a dispute regarding the precise sequence of events that occurred on 30 May 2019 between the time of Low’s arrest at about 6.45am and the recording of Low’s Contemporaneous Statement at about 8.01am. 31 The Prosecution’s version of events is that Sgt Merabel had brought the PMD up to Blk 986C Buangkok Crescent #11-88 (the “Unit”). Insp Jason then searched the PMD in Low’s presence and recovered the four drug exhibits including the Fourth Drug Bundle.29Foot Note 29×PCS at paras 3, 18. 32 Low disputes that the PMD was brought up to the Unit or searched in his view. He  alleges that he did not see Insp Jason, or any CNB officer, recover any exhibits (in particular, the Fourth Drug Bundle) from the PMD.30Foot Note 30×D1 CS at para 16.He relies on the recording by Sgt Merabel in the field diary entry marked ‘P122’ (the “P122 Field Diary Entry”) and the first police report (the “FirstPolice Report”) that was lodged by Sgt Fauzi to allege that the PMD was not in the Unit when the arresting CNB officers did the search.31Foot Note 31×D1 CS at paras 16 – 19.He says that the deletion of the words “on the e-scooter” from the P122 Field Diary Entry supports his case. He also says that the P122 Field Diary Entry appears “contrived” and does not accurately reflect the events of the day.32Foot Note 32×D1 CS at paras 34 – 37.In the First Police Report, there was no mention of the PMD being brought into or searched in the Unit, unlike the second police report (the “SecondPolice Report”) that was subsequently lodged by Sgt Fauzi to include particulars of the same. Low argues that the First Police Report supports his case and that the Second Police Report is inaccurate as Sgt Fauzi admitted that he had merely followed instructions to amend the report and did not cross-check with any contemporaneous document to ascertain if the PMD was indeed brought into the Unit.33Foot Note 33×D1 CS at para 21.Further, Low points out that there were no photographs taken of the Unit at the time of the raid to show that the PMD was brought into the Unit or indeed searched in his view.34Foot Note 34×D1 CS at para 23. 33 I find that the PMD was searched in Low’s presence at about 7.03am in the Unit and that the Fourth Drug Bundle was recovered from the PMD. Sgt Merabel testified that she had “pushed” the PMD from the location of Low’s arrest to the Unit.35Foot Note 35×NE 27072022 p 60 ln 9 – 10.Insp Jason, who carried out the search of the PMD, similarly testified that the PMD was brought up to the Unit along with Low. Insp Jason testified that he was in the same lift when Sgt Fauzi escorted Low together with Sgt Merabel and the PMD.36Foot Note 36×NE 26072022 p 92 ln 14 – p 94 ln 6.This is corroborated by the testimony of Sgt Fauzi.37Foot Note 37×NE 02082022 p 3 ln 11-13, p 6 ln 4 – p 7 ln 4.On the other hand, Low asserts that there were more than three officers with him in the lift and that there was “simply no space in the lift to accommodate all the CNB officers, Low and his electric bicycle”.38Foot Note 38×D1 CS at para 12.I do not find Low’s bare assertion to be sufficient reason for me to disbelieve the testimonies of these arresting CNB officers on how the PMD was brought up to the Unit along with Low. 34 In any event, that the Fourth Drug Bundle was recovered from the PMD is clear. Insp Jason stated in his conditioned statement that he had already conducted a preliminary search of the PMD in Low’s view at about 6.47am, at the lift lobby of Blk 986C Buangkok Crescent.39Foot Note 39×AB at p 94 para 8.From the preliminary search, he saw that there was “a white plastic bag that was not tied up,and a black bundle which was suspected to contain drugs” [emphasis added] in the black ‘Fiido Electric Scooter’ bag that was attached to the PMD.40Foot Note 40×AB at p 94, para 8; NE 26072022 at p 91 ln 4 – 8.As the white plastic bag was later found to contain the three drug exhibits ‘A1B1A1’, ‘A1B2A1’ and ‘A1B3A1’, the “black bundle which was suspected to contain drugs” can only refer to the Fourth Drug Bundle. This part of Insp Jason’s conditioned statement withstood scrutiny on the stand.41Foot Note 41×NE 26072022 p 92 ln 3-7.At trial, he further explained that he did not at that point in time look into the contents of the white plastic bag, as the arresting CNB officers’ priority then was to conduct the follow up action to the preliminary search:42Foot Note 42×NE 26072022 p 91 ln 9-26. A: At that moment we---we were proceeding to raid another unit at the same block, that’s why we did not do a thorough search to recover whatever was inside the---inside the bag at the moment. Q: Yes, Okay, so when would you then be thorough according to you? By the time you went out to the unit 11-88 you would be thorough in putting all the exi---all the suspected drugs together to be listed? A: At that moment, our priority was to raid the unit. So we---we would have---we---at that time, we would have - how should I say - I will do the search once everything has settled down and it’s conducive for me to do the search. That’s when I will do a thorough search to recover all the drugs, Your Honour. 35 This “thorough search” subsequently took place at about 7.03am when the PMD was brought up to the Unit and searched in Low’s view (see [33] above). 36 Low relies on Sgt Fauzi’s statement in court that he could not recall whether the PMD was brought into the Unit.43Foot Note 43×D1 CS at para 22; NE 02082022 at p 7 ln 17 – 19.He also places weight on the discrepancies between the First Police Report and Second Police Report which were lodged by Sgt Fauzi (see [32] above). According to Low, Sgt Fauzi had merely followed the instructions of his “senior” (ie, his superior officer) in amending the Second Police Report, to state that the PMD was brought into the Unit.44Foot Note 44×D1 CS at para 21.When cross-examined, Sgt Fauzi admitted that he could not recall who this “senior” was.45Foot Note 45×NE 02082022 at p 14 ln 3 – 12.These must, however, be viewed in context. Sgt Fauzi himself testified that his role in the operation did not entail entering the Unit while it was being searched. He only stood a distance away from the Unit, somewhere near the lift lobby.46Foot Note 46×NE 02082022 at p 8 ln 19 – 31.As such, Sgt Fauzi cannot be faulted for not knowing if the PMD was brought into the Unit. In this context, he relied on the instructions of another officer in making the amendments to the Second Police Report. Although it would have been far more satisfactory if Sgt Fauzi was able to recall who this “senior” was, I accept that gaps in a witness’ memory may appear because of the lapse of time, for which adequate allowance is accorded to human fallibility in retention and recollection:NgKwee Leong v Public Prosecutor[1998] 3 SLR(R) 281 at [17]. 37 In my view, the discrepancy was not material because, in any event, there was clear evidence from the CNB officers who weredirectlyinvolved in the search of the PMD as to the same (see [33] and [34] above). This was corroborated by the contemporaneous record in the P122 Field Diary Entry, to which I turn. 38 From the PMD, the Drug Bundles were recovered and seized as case exhibits.47Foot Note 47×NE 26072022 p 96 ln 1 – 3; AB at p 95, para 10.This was recorded by Sgt Merabel in the P122 Field Diary Entry. Low challenges the integrity of the P122 Field Diary Entry in two ways. 39 The first is to allege that there is no record of the PMD being searched as the words “on the e-scooter” were deleted from the entry at 7.05am. However, there is little merit in this allegation. Sgt Merabel testified that she initially wrote “Jetty began search on the e-scooter in the unit” (whereby ‘Jetty’ refers to Insp Jason) as she wanted to record that the search was conducted on the PMDwhileit was in the Unit.48Foot Note 48×Prosecution’s Reply Submissions dated 18 November 2022 (“PRS”) at para 8(a); NE 27072022 at p 54 ln 18 – 31.When asked why she subsequently deleted the words “on the e-scooter” from the P122 Field Diary Entry, Sgt Merabel explained that the deletion was to account for Low’s PMD being seized (and labelled “A”) during the search in the Unit.49Foot Note 49×NE 27072022 at p 55 ln 1 – 4.I accept Sgt Merabel’s explanation. As the Prosecution rightly points out, the PMD is an exhibit, and not a locationper se.50Foot Note 50×PRS at para 8(a); NE 27072022 at p 55 ln 1 – 4.Furthermore, Sgt Merabel testified that she had deleted the phrase of her own accord,ie, she had not been instructed or directed to make the deletion.51Foot Note 51×NE 27072022 at p 55 ln 7 – 9. 40 The second way in which Low challenges the P122 Field Diary Entry is to allege that its contents appeared “contrived” because the words in the sentence “02 clear tape[d] bundles with black tape containing brown granular substance” (the “Disputed Sentence”) were written on one line as if there were a limited number of lines available for the entry.52Foot Note 52×D1 CS at paras 34 – 37.He further points to the caret that was inserted and additional words written in the space above the caret as proof that the P122 Field Diary Entry had been madesubsequent tothe search, as if the diarist had been trying to fit all five exhibits into the limited space meant for only four exhibits.53Foot Note 53×D1 CS at para 35. 41 For clarity, I reproduce a copy of the P122 Field Diary Entry below:  Fig 1. Field Diary Entry marked ‘P122’ 42 These are serious allegations to make. I am unable to agree with Low’s characterisation of the matter. On the face of the P122 Field Diary Entry, there is nothing so “strange and suspicious” (contrawhat Low alleges) as to suggest that it has subsequently been tampered with or does not accurately reflect the exhibits recovered in the search. Neither did Sgt Merabel’s testimony in court suggest so.54Foot Note 54×NE 27072022 at p 56 ln 12 – 20. 43 In any case, it is unclear how far Low’s allegations relating to the Disputed Sentence would support his case that the Fourth Drug Bundle was not in fact recovered from the PMD, as the Disputed Sentence “02 clear tape[d] bundles with black tape containing brown granular substance” does not refer to the Fourth Drug Bundle. 44 Lastly, for completeness, I deal with Low’s contention that he had not acknowledged and signed the page of the P122 Field Diary Entry.55Foot Note 55×D1 CS at para 36.It is not required for an arrested person to acknowledge or sign the pages of the field diary, which areinternalrecords of the CNB and meant to ensure reliability in the records kept by the officers. An analogous situation is the maintenance of pocket books and field diaries by police officers (seeMuhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor[2011] 3 SLR 1205 at [145]). Section 19(2) of the CPC provides, in relation to police investigations under Part 4 of the CPC, that an accused isnotentitled to call for or inspect the field diary of a police officer “before or during an inquiry, a trial or other proceeding under this Code [ie, the CPC]”. I find this to be instructive to the present case, as s 32(1) of the MDA provides that in any case relating to the commission of an offence under the MDA, “an officer of the Bureau [ie, the CNB] has all the powers of a police officer under the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 in relation to an investigation into a seizable offence.” 45 In light of the above, I accept that the P122 Field Diary Entry provides an accurate record of the exhibits that were recovered from the PMD. This also corroborates the arresting CNB officers’ accounts (at [33]–[34]) that the Fourth Drug Bundle had been recovered from the search of the PMD in Low’s presence at about 7.03am. Sivaprakash’s account of the drug exhibits 46 Low also relies on Sivaprakash’s Contemporaneous Statement where he stated that the white plastic bag he had handed to Low containedthreepackages.56Foot Note 56×D1 CS at para 29.Low says that the Prosecution did not challenge Sivaprakash when cross-examining him on this point, but merely confirmed that the relevant answers in his Contemporaneous Statement were correct.57Foot Note 57×D1 CS at para 31.Furthermore, Low claims that Sivaprakash maintained at trial that he had delivered the white plastic bag containing three packages to Low.58Foot Note 58×D1 CS at para 31. 47 I do not find Sivaprakash’s account of the drug exhibits to be helpful to Low. As Low himself acknowledges,59Foot Note 59×D1 CS at para 30.Sivaprakash’s account of the matter vacillated. While he initially stated in his Contemporaneous Statement that there were three packages, he later took the position that there were fourpackages in the white plastic bag that he handed to Low. This was consistent across his Cautioned Statement,60Foot Note 60×AB at p 227, para 8.his Second Long Statement,61Foot Note 61×D1 CS at para 30; AB at pp 259 – 260, para 19.his Third Long Statement62Foot Note 62×AB at p 279, para 35.and his testimony at trial.63Foot Note 63×NE 25082022 at p 30 ln 12 – 21. 48 In Low’s view, one possible explanation for Sivaprakash’s inconsistent positions is that he had indeed transferred three packages of drugs from the black torn plastic bag but thought that he must have been mistaken when he saw four packets in the EMR, and therefore changed his position.64Foot Note 64×D1 CS at para 32.There is, in my view, no merit to this submission as Sivaprakash’s Second Long Statement and Third Long Statement were recordedafterthe exhibit processing which took place at around 4.43pm on 30 May 2019. In Sivaprakash’s Third Long Statement, he explained that he did not recall clearly at the time his Contemporaneous Statement was recorded whether there had been three or four packages inside the white plastic bag:65Foot Note 65×AB at p 279 para 35. 35. I am now told that in the statement I gave to the arresting officers on the day of my arrest, 30 May 2019, I told the officers that I gave one bag containing 3 packages to the Chinese man. I am asked if this were correct.I told them there could have been 3 packages, I did not say that for sure there were 3.1 told the officers that there could have been 3 packages because I was just arrested and out of fear and confusion, I told them there were 3 packages.I can now recall clearly that when Iopened up the torn black plastic bag at the bus stop after clearing Tuas checkpoint on 30 May 2019, there were 4 packages, 2 big 2 small.However, I would like to add now that \"Joe\" did tell me that there were 3 packages in the black plastic bag. [emphasis added] 49 It is not Sivaprakash’s case that he had taken any of the Drug Bundles out of the white plastic bag before handing it to Low. On the contrary, he confirmed at trial that he had transferred allfourDrug Bundles from a torn black plastic bag to the white plastic bag, which he subsequently handed over to Low:66Foot Note 66×NE 25082022 at p 30 ln 2 – 5. Q: Right, so just by looking at the photos, you managed to identify that there werea total of four itemswhich you transferred from the torn black plastic bag to the white plastic bag A1B, right? A: Yes, Your Honour. [emphasis added] 50 Low did not challenge Sivaprakash’s evidence in cross-examination.67Foot Note 67×PRS at para 11(c). 51 It is thus clear that Sivaprakash’s evidence, which he maintained at trial, is that he had deliveredfourpackages in the white plastic bag to Low. The veracity of this is further corroborated by the fact that Sivaprakash’s DNA was found on the packaging of all four Drug Bundles.68Foot Note 68×PRS at para 11(c); ASOF at para 47. 52 In Sivaprakash’s written submissions on this issue, he adopts Low’s position (at [46]). I find this to be an afterthought. Sivaprakash took this position after hearing the testimonies of Low and “the CNB officers involved regarding the chain of custody”.69Foot Note 69×D2 CS at para 29(b).His explanation is that he was not present when the drugs were seized and thus could not say anything in respect of the evidence.70Foot Note 70×D2 CS at para 29(a).However, I do not find this convincing as he had seen the Drug Bundles during exhibit processing at the EMR and had been asked about the white plastic bag and its contents in the course of recording his investigative statements. For instance, Sivaprakash was shown a photograph of the exhibits ‘A1A’, ‘A1A1’ and ‘A1A1A’ in the course of recording his Second Long Statement on 3 June 2019. I reproduce a copy of this photograph below:  Fig 2. Photograph of exhibits ‘A1A’, ‘A1A1’ and ‘A1A1A’ 53 When asked whether he recognised the exhibit marked ‘A1A’ in the above photograph, which is the packaging that contained the Fourth Drug Bundle, Sivaprakash replied:71Foot Note 71×AB at p 259 – 260, para 19. … I have seen the item marked as A1A in Photo 10 before my arrest, at the bus stop after clearing Tuas Checkpoint.It was already likethat and it was in a torn black plastic bag when I took it. There should be 2 of this.I put this in a white plastic bag after I took it out from the torn black plastic bag. … [emphasis added] 54 The “2 of this” in the above statement refer to exhibits ‘A1A’ and ‘A1B3’, which were identical in their packaging (ie, black taped packaging). 55 Clearly, there was more than ample opportunity for Sivaprakash to raise this objection earlier if he had truly doubted the identity of the Fourth Drug Bundle seized from the PMD. His belatedvolte-facelends no credence to either Low’s or his own submissions on the issue. Photograph of the white plastic bag and its contents 56 Low relies on a photograph of the white plastic bag and its contents photographed at the Unit (the “Photograph”)72Foot Note 72×AB at p 109.that depicts onlythreepackets of drugs. For clarity, I reproduce a copy of the Photograph below:  Fig 3. Photograph used in the course of recording Low’s Contemporaneous Statement 57 The Photograph was used by SI Sunny in the course of recording Low’s Contemporaneous Statement at about 8.01am on 30 May 2019. SI Sunny also did not question Low about the Fourth Drug Bundle when he was taking Low’s Contemporaneous Statement.73Foot Note 73×D1 CS at paras 26 – 28.According to Low, these support his case that the Fourth Drug Bundle was not recovered from the PMD. 58 The omission of the Fourth Drug Bundle from the Photographandfrom the questions in Low’s Contemporaneous Statement does, at first blush, give room to pause. At trial, Insp Jason himself accepted that all the exhibits that were recovered at the Unit should have been laid out and photographed.74Foot Note 74×NE 26072022 at p 97, ln 14 – 17.In fact, he testified that “I think that would be one more photo which is showing the black tape[d] bundle labelled as A1Awhich is not in the photograph” [emphasis added].75Foot Note 75×NE 26072022 at p 97, ln 8 – 9.SI Sunny and Insp Jason were both unable to recall which CNB officer in the party (at [4]) took the Photograph.76Foot Note 76×NE 27072022 at p 36, ln 21 – 27 (SI Sunny); NE 26072022 at p 96, ln 21 – 25 (Insp Jason).SI Sunny testified in court that he had used his phone to show Low the Photograph in the course of taking Low’s Contemporaneous Statement. However, he had only wanted to show Low the picture of the white plastic bag and had “cover[ed] up A1B2 and A1B1” (ie,the bottom half of the Photograph shown at [56] above), when showing Low the Photograph.77Foot Note 77×NE 27072022 at p 38 ln 18 – 22.He explained his reason for so doing:78Foot Note 78×NE 27072022 at p 37 ln 7 – 18. Q: Okay. So you would agree that when you ask questions to an accused person in preparing the contemporaneous statements for drug trafficking offences, you will be asking questions about all the drugs seized in the accused’s possession, yes? A: Yes, Your Honour. But during this case, when I ask the question, he mentioned that he did not know what is inside the white plastic bag.Sowhile record---I---when I record the statement, I---I did not think that he is a trafficker. So I did not question about the drugs, Your Honour. Q:  Okay. So, thank you. In your mind at that time, and based on your investigations---sorry, rephrase. So in your mind at that time, you did not think Mr Low was a trafficker. A: It’s not I---I should not have prejudiced that he’s a trafficker, Your Honour. [emphasis added] 59 This may have been SI Sunny’s explanation. I do not find this explanation to be entirely satisfactory. SI Sunny had asked Low about other exhibits recovered from the Unit, such as a cigarette box.79Foot Note 79×D1 CS at para 27; AB at p 107, Q/A 18.He conceded at trial that if there was “anything else that was suspected of being drugs” which had been recovered from the PMD, he would have questioned Low about it in the latter’s Contemporaneous Statement.80Foot Note 80×NE 27072022 at p 37 ln 24 – 26.The Fourth Drug Bundle should thus have been photographed together withthe other drug exhibits recovered from the PMD, or at the very least, asked about in the course of recording Low’s Contemporaneous Statement. This follows from my finding (see [34]–[38] above) that the Fourth Drug Bundle was recoveredalongsidethe white plastic bag from the search of the PMD in the Unit. Insp Jason testified that it was suspected to contain drugs.81Foot Note 81×AB at p 94, para 8; NE 26072022 at p 91 ln 4 – 8 (Insp Jason).Neither he nor SI Sunny was able to provide a satisfactory explanation for its omission from the Photograph. 60 But the important question remains whether this is sufficient to raise areasonable doubtas to the identity of the Fourth Drug Bundle. I find that it is not. InMohamedAffandi, the Court of Appeal affirmed (at [41]) that the need to call witnesses to testify to each step in the chain of custody only arises where a doubt as to the identity of an exhibit has arisen. Whether such a doubt exists must be judged in light of all the surrounding circumstances:Satlibin Masot v Public Prosecutor[1999] 1 SLR(R) 931 at [16]. The mere fact that questions may remain unanswered does not necessarily mean that a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case has arisen:Public Prosecutor v Yen MayWoen[2003] SGHC 60 at [60]. 61 The testimonies from the arresting CNB officers (at [33]–[38]) relating to the search of the PMD were convincing and corroborated by the P122 Field Diary Entry. In addition, Low’s DNA was found on the adhesive sides of the taped packaging of the Fourth Drug Bundle (which I deal with below at [68]–[69]). In light of this, the omission of the Fourth Drug Bundle from the Photograph and from Low’s Contemporaneous Statement was perhaps a lapse, but insufficient to raise areasonable doubtthat the Fourth Drug Bundle had not been seized from the PMD. Sealing of the case exhibits in tamper-proof bags for exhibit handling and processing 62 Low contends that the exhibits from another case may have been mistaken for the Fourth Drug Bundle.82Foot Note 82×D1 CS at para 63.He premises this on the assertion that the case exhibits were not properly sealed in tamper-proof bagsprior tobeing brought into the EMR for exhibit processing,83Foot Note 83×D1 CS at para 60.contrary to what was recalled by the CNB officers. Low claims to have seen that the white plastic bag (ie,exhibit ‘A1B’) was brought into the EMR with the Drug Bundles still inside it; the Drug Bundles were then taken out of the plastic bag and laid out on brown paper in the EMR.84Foot Note 84×D1 CS at para 64; NE 16082022 at p 42 ln 13 – 17.Sivaprakash likewise asserts the same85Foot Note 85×D2 Reply at para 36.and urges the court to accord little weight to the evidence of the CNB officers involved in the chain of custody. In Sivaprakash’s view, their respective conditioned statements are “almost identical without them having personal knowledge of the fact as required in law for the evidence to be credible”.86Foot Note 86×D2 CS at para 29(c). 63 In my view, however, there is no reason to disbelieve the accounts of the CNB officers involved in the chain of custody, who consistently maintained in their conditioned statements and at trial that the Drug Bundles had been properly sealed in tamper-proof bags.87Foot Note 87×See, for example, the evidence of SI Huang: NE 03082022 p 13 ln 26 – 28.I set out in chronological order the sequence of events as follows, beginning with the handling of the Drug Bundles from the point of seizure: (a) Insp Jason, who carried out the search of the PMD (at [33]), gave evidence in his conditioned statement on the handling of the case exhibits (which included the Drug Bundles) after they had been seized from the PMD. Insp Jason stated that SI Sunny had assisted in putting the case exhibits into individual tamper-proof bags and sealing them. SI Sunny had worn a fresh pair of gloves to do so.88Foot Note 88×AB at p 95.When cross-examined on this, SI Sunny testified:89Foot Note 89×NE 27072022 at p 31 ln 31 – p 32 ln 7. Q: … Can you describe the search process? A: Jason, myself and---wore a fresh pair of glove. Then I’m the assistant in the---the packing of the exhibit. So I will lay down the brown paper, Jason will retrieve---search and retrieve the exhibit and he will place on the brown paper. Then after that, I would write down the markings based on what Jason told me and another officer would take a photo of the brown paper with the exhibit being on top with the marking, Your Honour. After that, then I will pack the individual exhibitinto tamper-proof bag, Your Honour. [emphasis added] (b) The sealed exhibits were then handed over by SI Sunny to Insp Jason, who testified that he placed them all into a duffel bag.90Foot Note 90×NE 26072022 at p 102 ln 1 – 2. (c) Thereafter, Insp Jason returned to CNB Headquarters at about 9.50am with the case exhibits stored in the manner described above at [63(b)]. He stated in his conditioned statement that he locked the case exhibits in a cupboard and then attended to his other duties.91Foot Note 91×AB at p 95.At trial, he testified that this was a cupboard in his office with a key that was only held by him.92Foot Note 92×NE 26072022 at p 102 ln 19 – 26. (d) At about 2.05pm, Insp Jason took the case exhibits out of the cupboard in his office and handed them over to Sgt Nasrulhaq.93Foot Note 93×AB at p 95.Sgt Nasrulhaq confirmed in his conditioned statement that he had “custody” of the case exhibits from about 2.05pm to about 4.43pm, which was when the processing of the exhibits in the EMR commenced. During cross-examination, he clarified that “custody” meant that the case exhibits were kept in a locked metal cabinet in his office, which was meant solely for case exhibits.94Foot Note 94×NE 27072022 at pp 25 to 27. (e) Sgt Narulhaq gave evidence in his conditioned statement that at or about 4.38pm, he handed over the case exhibits to IO Weili at the EMR.95Foot Note 95×AB at p 205.Under cross-examination, Sgt Nasrulhaq clarified that he had been standing outside the EMR and, whenever IO Weili called for a specific case exhibit, he then handed that exhibitin the tamper-proof bagto IO Weili.96Foot Note 96×NE 27072022 at p 23 ln 13 – 20.In this manner, all the case exhibits were handed over, one by one, to IO Weili for the exhibit processing which took place inside the EMR.97Foot Note 97×NE 27072022 at p 26 ln 18 – 22.Sgt Nasrulhaq also explained that there had been markings on the exterior of each tamper-proof bag, to identify the respective case exhibits.98Foot Note 98×NE 27072022 at p 26 ln 23 – 25. (f) IO Weili gave evidence in his conditioned statement that at about 4.43pm, in the view of Low and Sivaprakash, the processing of the case exhibits in the EMR commenced. This included the photography of the case exhibits, the swabbing of 12 exhibits and the weighing of the Drug Bundles (which were recorded in IO Weili’s Investigation Diary and signed by Low and Sivaprakash).99Foot Note 99×AB at p 207.At trial, IO Weili clarified that the Drug Bundles were weighed “withthe tamper-proof bag”.100Foot Note 100×NE 11082022 at p 5 ln 19 – 21.Home Team Specialist (“HTS”) Muhamad Nizam Bin Abudol Rahmin (“HTS Nizam”), who assisted in the exhibit processing, testified at trial that he had received the case exhibits in the EMR in tamper-proof bags, although he admitted that he could not remember whether it was “a group of exhibits in the bag [ie, in one tamper-proof bag] or … individual exhibits in individual bags”.101Foot Note 101×NE 27072022 at p 11 ln 10 – 22.Nonetheless, it is clear from the evidence of Insp Jason, SI Sunny and Sgt Narulhaq (above at [63(a)] and [63(e)] that the case exhibits wereindividuallysealed in separate tamper-proof bags. (g) IO Weili stated in his conditioned statement that after the processing of each case exhibit, they were again sealed in tamper-proof bags and remained in his custody.102Foot Note 102×AB at p 207.HTS Nizam and HTS Woong Si Xuan (“HTSWoong”) assisted in packing each exhibit into a tamper-proof bag.103Foot Note 103×AB at p 5.During cross-examination, HTS Nizam testified that “the case exhibits after swab or photograph was placed inside the tamper-proof bag … [a]nd thereafter, the tamper-proof bag will be handed over to the IO for him to check and seal.104Foot Note 104×NE 27072022 at p 7 ln 10 – 13.This was corroborated by HTS Woong’s testimony that the case exhibits had been individually sealed in tamper-proof bags.105Foot Note 105×NE 28072022 at p 13 ln 1 – 6.HTS Woong also clarified that this was based on his recollection of the case, and not from mere conjecture of the CNB’s usual practice.106Foot Note 106×NE 28072022 at p 16. (h) On 31 May 2019 at about 10.40am, IO Weili handed over custody of the case exhibits to SSgt Rafi.107Foot Note 107×AB at pp 208 – 209.SSgt Rafi confirmed in his conditioned statement that the case exhibits had been sealed in tamper-proof bags and were then kept in a locked cupboard.108Foot Note 108×AB at p 18.Under cross-examination, he explained:109Foot Note 109×NE 28072022 at p 43. Q: What does that mean? How do you take over custody of the case exhibits? A: Okay. It’s a process where there is a list of exhibits form. This form will have all the details, the date, time, report number, the reference number, I---the IP---investigation number, the EMT number, the exhibit marking, the exhibit description, the IO’s instruction to where each and every exhibit should go, be it go to the labs, to the store for safe-keep or to the FIT IO or---so the instruction would also be there. And for those that are kept in tamper-proof bags, the serial number will also be there. So this form is quite complete. Using this form, I will tally all the details with the physical exhibits that I take over.If everything matches and everything is correct and the tamper-proof bag is all sealed,the paper bags are all sealed, I will take custody, I will stamp and sign on this form and the exhibits are in my custody from that point of time. [emphasis added] (i) SSgt Rafi further explained that this locked cupboard was located inside the office of the CNB’s Exhibit Management Team (“EMT”)110Foot Note 110×NE 28072022 at p 43 ln 5.and was used by the EMT for storing exhibits. He was the only person with access (by key) to this locked cupboard on 31 May 2019 as he was the Duty Officer for that day.111Foot Note 111×NE 28072022 at p 42. 64 The evidence of the CNB officers was thus clear and not shaken in cross-examination. It accounted for the movement of the case exhibits, in particular the Drug Bundles, and satisfied me that the case exhibits had been properly sealed in tamper-proof bags. 65 Low relies on Assistant Investigation Officer SI Huang’s testimony that not all exhibits would be placed in tamper-proof bags as some could be placed in Ziplock bags, wrapped in brown paper or left as is.112Foot Note 112×NE 03082022 at p 11 ln 7 – 9; NE 03082022 at p 12 ln 13 – 14, 20; D1 CS at para 65.This must, however, be understood in context. SI Huang explained that “as long as small items are involved,definitelythey will be in a CNB polymer bag” [emphasis added]113Foot Note 113×NE 03082022 at p 12 ln 16 – 21.and confirmed that the Drug Bundles had been brought into the EMR in such tamper-proof bags (which he alternatively referred to as “CNB polymer bag”).114Foot Note 114×NE 03082022 at p 11 ln 21 – 23.Only larger items or those with spillage or flammable gas would be placed in a Ziplock bag or wrapped in brown paper.115Foot Note 115×NE 03082022 at p 11 ln 7 – p 12 ln 3. 66 Another plank of Low’s argument of a mistaken exhibit rested on his understanding of the evidence of SSgt Rafi, who was the Duty Officer in charge of the locked cupboard in the EMT office where the Drug Bundles were kept on 31 May 2019 (see [63(i)] above). SSgt Rafi testified that the exhibits from other cases “might” have been kept in the same cupboard where the Drug Bundles were placed, although he also stated that they would have been “kept in another shelf”.116Foot Note 116×NE 28072022 at p 43 ln 8.In my view, more important was the fact that the case exhibits had been properly sealed in tamper-proof bags for exhibit handling and processing (above at [63]). 67 Furthermore, none of these allegations as to a mistaken exhibit were ever put to any of the CNB officers (above at [63]) involved in the chain of custody of the Drug Bundles, at trial.117Foot Note 117×PRS at para 11(a).Such allegations are the belated attempt by Low and Sivaprakash to attack the identity of the exhibits seized from the PMD and do not convince me that there exists areasonable doubtas to the possibility that the Fourth Drug Bundle is a mistaken exhibit. Low’s DNA on the adhesive sides of the taped packaging containing the Fourth Drug Bundle 68 It is undisputed that Low’s DNA was found on the adhesive sides of the taped packaging marked ‘A1A’ which contained the Fourth Drug Bundle. The Prosecution submits that this is objective evidence suggesting that Low had reached into the white plastic bag containing the Drug Bundles after Sivaprakash had handed the bag to him, and had come into contact with the Fourth Drug Bundle.118Foot Note 118×PRS at para 11(b).On the other hand, Low says that there is a possibility that his DNA had been transferred onto the surface of ‘A1A’ when the latter exhibit came into contact withanotheritem containing his DNA.119Foot Note 119×D1 CS at para 72.Again, this defence is premised on Low’s assertion that the case exhibits were not properly sealed in tamper-proof bags prior to exhibit processing and thus transference could have happened when the case exhibits were being brought into the EMR.120Foot Note 120×D1 CS at para 72. 69 It is trite that speculative arguments about the merepossibilityof contamination are insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to the chain of custody:Public Prosecutor v ChenMingjian[2009] 4 SLR(R) 946 at [4];MohamedAffandiat [41]. As I have found above (at [63]) that the Drug Bundles were properly sealed in tamper-proof bags prior to being brought into the EMR, it follows that Low’s argument of the possibility of transference is more apparent than real and not grounded in the factual matrix before the court. What is more probable, which I accept, is that Low had reached into the white plastic bag and had come into contact with the adhesive sides of the taped packaging which contained the Fourth Drug Bundle. 70 The presence of Low’s DNA on the adhesive sides of the taped packaging of the Fourth Drug Bundle further corroborates my conclusion (above at [33]–[38]) that the Fourth Drug Bundle was in fact recovered from the PMD. Other alleged inconsistencies in the record keeping and CNB officers’ accounts 71 I address the various other allegations raised by Low and Sivaprakash regarding the record keeping and purportedly inconsistent accounts of the CNB officers involved in the chain of custody. They argue that these alleged discrepancies evince the overall unreliability of the evidence from the CNB officers involved in the arrest and the chain of custody.121Foot Note 121×D2 CS at para 13.In my view, however, these allegations do not cast areasonable doubton the CNB officers’ testimonies concerning the integrity of the chain of custody. I elaborate. (1) The Red Bag labelled ‘LSS-PP3’ 72 Low argues that he had placed the white plastic bag containing the Drug Bundlesin a red bagwithin the black ‘Fiido Electric Scooter’ bag attached to the PMD.122Foot Note 122×D1 CS at para 44.This red bag was subsequently labelled ‘LSS-PP3’ (the “Red Bag”) leading Low to submit that the CNB officers had not followed their own naming convention of the exhibits, since (according to Low) the Red Bag should have been marked exhibit ‘A1B’ and the white plastic bag containing the Drug Bundles marked exhibit ‘A1B1’ instead.123Foot Note 123×D1 CS at paras 44–45. 73 The issue of the Red Bag is nothing more than a red herring and an afterthought by Low to obfuscate the real issue in contention, namely, whether the Fourth Drug Bundle was recovered from the PMD. As the Prosecution submits, it was never put to Insp Jason (who conducted the search of the PMD) that the white plastic bag or any of the four Drug Bundles were retrieved from a red bag instead of the black ‘Fiido Electric Scooter’ bag.124Foot Note 124×PCS at para 60.Furthermore, Low’s allegation in respect of the Red Bag only surfaced in his final Fourth Long Statement recorded on 23 January 2020, about seven months after his arrest,125Foot Note 125×PCS at para 62.and he had volunteered this allegation without being prompted or asked about it.126Foot Note 126×PCS at para 62(a).In contrast, in his earlier First Long Statement and Second Long Statement, Low maintained that he had put the white plastic bag after receiving it from Sivaprakash “in the storage bag that comes together with my motorized bicycle”,127Foot Note 127×AB at p 220, para 8.and identified this storage bag as the black ‘Fiido Electric Scooter’ bag.128Foot Note 128×AB at pp 231 – 232, para 26.In fact, in the course of recording his Second Long Statement, Low was shown a photograph of the Red Bag and whenspecifically asked about it,confirmed that the Red Bag “was used to contain the charger and the allen key”.129Foot Note 129×AB at p 235, para 37; PCS at para 62(b). 74 In any event,regardlessof whether the white plastic bag containing the Drug Bundles was placed in the Red Bag or placed in the black ‘Fiido Electric Scooter’ bag directly, Low cannot dispute that the Red Bag was also recovered from the PMD and admitted as much that “these items [ie, including the Red Bag] were all placed inside the storage bag marked as A1”.130Foot Note 130×AB at p 235, para 37. (2) Alleged inconsistencies in the CNB officers’ accounts 75 Low points to an alleged inconsistency in the evidence of the CNB officers involved in the chain of custody and submits that it points to a “systemic problem” in how CNB handled the exhibits.131Foot Note 131×D1 CS at paras 46 – 51.The inconsistency was as follows: On one hand, Staff Sergeant Goh Yang Lun (“SSgt Marc”) testified that the exhibits ‘A1A’, ‘A1A1’, ‘A1B1’, ‘A1B1A’, ‘A1B2’, ‘A1B2A’, ‘A1B3’ and ‘A1B3A’ (namely, the external wrappings of each of the respective Drug Bundles) were not in the locked cupboard in the EMT office at about 3pm when he retrieved the Drug Bundles.132Foot Note 132×NE 11082022 at p 44 ln 1 – 4; D1 CS at para 49.This was at about 3pm on 31 May 2019. On the other hand, SSgt Rafi maintained in his conditioned statement and at trial that, at about 4pm on the same day, he retrieved,inter alia,these exhibits from the same locked cupboard for despatch to the HSA.133Foot Note 133×AB at p 18 para 3; NE 28072022 at p 41 ln 17 – 24. 76 I am unable to accept that this alleged inconsistency raised by Low is material. SSgt Rafi was the Duty Officer in charge of the locked cupboard in the EMT office on that day. But counsel for Low did notputthis alleged inconsistency to SSgt Rafi or afford him any opportunity to address the court on the movement of the case exhibits at about 3pm. This is significant as SSgt Rafi had taken over custody of the case exhibits at about 10.40am and was the only officer with access to the locked cupboard where the case exhibits were kept.134Foot Note 134×NE 28072022 at p 42 ln 6 – 19.He confirmed that the cupboard was locked with a key and that this key would have been kept with him at all times.135Foot Note 135×NE 28072022 at p 44 ln 1 – 2.He thus would have knowledge of the movement, if any, of the case exhibits before 3pm. Additionally, as the Prosecution points out, it is unsurprising that SSgt Marc did not see the other exhibits (above at [75]) as that did not fall within the scope of his task that day, which wasspecificallyto despatch the Drug Bundles to HSA for analysis.136Foot Note 136×PRS at para 8(c). 77 Sivaprakash likewise seeks to impugn the reliability of the evidence from several CNB officers, by showing that they were not relying on their own observations of facts but rather on statements made by some other officer and hence they were unable to verify the said fact personally.137Foot Note 137×D2 CS at para 13.First, Insp Jason testified that he witnessed Sivaprakash alighting from the Motorcycle when Sivaprakash and Low met at Sumang Walk. However, the video evidence does not show Sivaprakash alighting from the Motorcycle as such.138Foot Note 138×D2 CS at para 14.Second, Sivaprakash argues that in another instance, ASP Faizal could not satisfactorily account in cross-examination for why he did not know that Sivaprakash had parked the Motorcycle outside 21 Sungei Kadut Way and why he had to rely on the information of another unknown CNB officer’s radio message on the same.139Foot Note 139×D2 CS at para 15. 78 In my view, these discrepancies raised by Sivaprakash are not sufficientlymaterial tothe issue at hand, which is the disputed identity of the Fourth Drug Bundle. I also do not accept Sivaprakash’s argument that these inconsistencies diminish the credibility of the relevant Prosecution witnesses,140Foot Note 140×D2 Reply at para 9.taking into account the reality that a period of time has elapsed since the events of the arrest. What is more important is that the accounts of the CNB officers involved in the search of the PMD and the chain of custody of the drug exhibits have been corroborated by the objective evidence at hand (above at [33]–[45] and [68]–[70]). 79 Sivaprakash also relies on the contents of the Field Diary Entry marked ‘P121’ (the “P121 Field Diary Entry”), which records the events of his arrest on 30 May 2019. He says that two events are erroneously recorded to have taken place at the same time: (i) the service of notice of the mandatory death penalty on him (the “MDP Notice”) and (ii) the counting of the S$9,000 cash seized from the Motorcycle.141Foot Note 141×D2 CS at para 23.SSgt Janani, who was the diarist of the P121 Field Diary Entry, and ASP Faizal both testified that the serving of the MDP Notice would have endedbeforethe commencement of the counting of the S$9,000 cash.142Foot Note 142×NE 26072022 at p 54 ln 11 – 18 (ASP Faizal); NE 02082022 at p 36 ln 20 – 23 (SSgt Janini).In court, SSgt Janini explained that she had obtained the timings of the MDP notice being served on Sivaprakash from SI Nabil and the timings of the counting of the S$9,000 cash from her own watch.143Foot Note 143×NE 02082022 at p 36 ln 10 – 19.The explanation of SI Nabil is that he only became aware many months after the day of the arrest that his watch had been running five minutes faster at the time he provided the timings for the P121 Field Diary Entry.144Foot Note 144×D2 CS at para 23.Sivaprakash submits that this is an unsatisfactory explanation and casts doubt on the reliability and honesty of SI Nabil’s testimony as a whole. This is also relevant to Sivaprakash’s allegation (below at [83]–[84]) that his Contemporaneous Statement was not recorded in the manner described by SI Nabil, who was the only other person present with Sivaprakash in the CNB vehicle at the time the Contemporaneous Statement was allegedly recorded. 80 I accept that the explanations given by SI Nabil and SSgt Janani provide a satisfactory account for the erroneous record of the timings on the face of the P121 Field Diary Entry. The serving of the MDP Notice on Sivaprakash was recorded to have been concluded at 7.50am, but since this timing was taken from SI Nabil’s watch that had been running five minutes faster at the material time, it would in fact have concluded at 7.45am. This is prior to the commencement of the counting of the S9,000 cash, which was recorded to have commenced at about 7.47am (with the timing taken from SSgt Janini’s own watch and hence unaffected by the error in SI Nabil’s watch). There was thus no real inconsistency between the events recorded in the P121 Field Diary Entry and the testimony of ASP Faizal and SSgt Janini that the serving of the MDP Notice would have endedbeforethe commencement of the counting of the S$9,000 cash (at [79]). (3) Lack of contemporaneous records at each point of movement of the case exhibits 81 Low alleges that there is a lack of contemporaneous records detailing the exact exhibits seized at each and every point of movement of the case exhibits.145Foot Note 145×D1 CS at paras 52 – 56.He further submits that I should draw an adverse inference that there was a lapse in CNB’s procedure, from this lack of documentary evidence.146Foot Note 146×D1 CS at paras 57 – 59.According to Low, it is unsatisfactory that there was no record or inventory of all the case exhibits at the time when they were first brought back to CNB and locked in the cupboard in Insp Jason’s office,147Foot Note 147×D1 CS at paras 52 – 53.and equally unsatisfactory that there was no record of the case exhibits stored in or removed from the locked cupboard in the EMT office after the exhibits were processed.148Foot Note 148×D1 CS at para 55.Low also submits that the information provided in the First and Second Police Reports cannot be relied on as an accurate record of the case exhibits as Sgt Fauzi (who prepared the First and Second Police Reports) had not personally witnessed the search of the Unit and admitted to amending the Second Police Report after instructions from his senior officer.149Foot Note 149×D1 CS at para 54. 82 I do not accept that there has been a lack of records as asserted by Low as to establish a break in the chain of custody or even justify the drawing of an adverse inference pursuant to illustration (g) of s 116 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed). InMohamedAffandi,the Court of Appeal stated that “the fact is that the keeping of proper records will obviate the need to adduce evidence or to prove this [ie, to prove each step in the chain of custody] in most cases and it is incumbent on the CNB officers to keep such records” (at [42]). In this case, I find that there was proper keeping of records from the point of seizure, namely, the P122 Field Diary Entry (above at [38]–[45]) and the respective conditioned statements of the CNB officers involved in the chain of custody (above at [63]). These were supplemented by the oral testimony of the CNB officers of how the case exhibits were seized and sealed in tamper-proof bags; and how the case exhibits were passed in this manner from one CNB officer to another until they ended up with IO Weili for exhibit processing at the EMR at about 4.43pm on 30 May 2019 (above at [63]).150Foot Note 150×PCS at paras 13(c) – (j), 18.In the final analysis, Low’s challenge relating to the handling and processing of the case exhibits is without merit. (4) Sivaprakash’s Contemporaneous Statement 83 Sivaprakash disputes that his Contemporaneous Statement was recorded in the manner described by SI Nabil. SI Nabil testified that he had recorded Sivaprakash’s Contemporaneous Statement at about 8.00am to 8.45am on 30 May 2019, inside a CNB operational vehicle (the “CNB Vehicle”).151Foot Note 151×AB at p 154, para 12.Only SI Nabil and Sivaprakash were present inside the CNB Vehicle.152Foot Note 152×NE 26072022 at p 52 ln 14 – 15.According to Sivaprakash, SI Nabil did not have any writing material with him inside the CNB Vehicle and thus could not have recorded the statement.153Foot Note 153×D2 CS at para 18.He also says that he had been handcuffed from his back at the relevant time and could not have signed anything in that position,154Foot Note 154×D2 CS at para 19.and that he had at best signed the Contemporaneous Statement very much later and not in the CNB Vehicle.155Foot Note 155×D2 CS at para 21.Furthermore, he alleges that there had been no explanation or interpretation of the contents of the said statement at any point in time.156Foot Note 156×D2 CS at para 21. 84 Sivaprakash disputes the recording of his Contemporaneous Statement but does not dispute that the remaining five statements were voluntarily provided by him,157Foot Note 157×PCS at para 23.which I rely on in the course of my judgment (see [47]–[54], [112]–[114] and [117]–[123]). Although I do not rely on the contents of Sivaprakash’s Contemporaneous Statement, nonetheless, I deal with the allegations raised by him (above at [83]) and reject them. SI Nabil testified that he had brought a pen and the field diary (which contained the P121 Field Diary Entry) into the CNB Vehicle to record Sivaprakash’s Contemporaneous Statement.158Foot Note 158×NE 03082022 at p 78 ln 12 – 17.This account is corroborated by SSgt Janani, who testified that she had “passed the field diary to Nabil [ie, SI Nabil] for the recording of the oral statement”.159Foot Note 159×NE 02082022 at p 57 ln 11 – 14.SI Nabil testified that at the end of the recording, he had read the Contemporaneous Statement to Sivaprakash “word by word”, and Sivaprakash “understood it and … said that it is correct and … confirmed that it is correct”.160Foot Note 160×NE 03082022 at p 69 ln 9 – 13.He testified that while Sivaprakash had originally been handcuffed to his back, he then handcuffed Sivaprakash to the front so that Sivaprakash could sign the Contemporaneous Statement.161Foot Note 161×NE 03082022 at p 84 ln 23 – 31. 85 SI Nabil’s account of the manner in which Sivaprakash’s Contemporaneous statement was recorded is broadly corroborated by the evidence of ASP Faizal, who confirmed that he had directed SI Nabil to commence the recording of Sivaprakash’s Contemporaneous Statement, as recorded in the P121 Field Diary Entry. ASP Faizal also testified that he had seen Sivaprakash’s Contemporaneous Statement “immediately” after SI Nabil had finished recording the statement and left the vehicle.162Foot Note 162×NE 26072022 at p 71 ln 18 – 23.Accordingly, I reject Sivaprakash’s allegation that he could not have recorded or signed his Contemporaneous Statement inside the CNB vehicle, or that there had been no explanation or interpretation of the contents of the said statement. Conclusion on the Chain of Custody Sub-issue 86 In light of the above, I find that the integrity of the chain of custody of the drug exhibits seized from the PMD, in particular, the Fourth Drug Bundle, has not been compromised. Low and Sivaprakash have not raised areasonable doubtthat the Fourth Drug Bundle was not the same drug exhibit seized from the PMD on 30 May 2019. Low’s contention of the possibility that exhibits from anothercase were mistaken for the exhibits seized in this case is speculative and not borne out by the objective evidence at hand (above at [62]–[70]). Conclusion on the Possession Issues 87 As I have found that the Drug Bundles were thesamedrug exhibits which were seized and recovered from the white plastic bag in the PMD on 30 May 2019, by virtue of s 18(1)(a) of the MDA, it follows that the presumption of possession applies to both Sivaprakash and Low for the reasons set out above at [23] and [24] and hasnotbeen rebutted. 88 For completeness, I also address Sivaprakash’s alternative argument that he was in possession of “paan parak” and not the Drug Bundles. It follows from my conclusion (at [86]) that there is no reasonable doubt on the chain of custody of the Drug Bundles, that there is little merit in Sivaprakash’s submission that he was in possession of “paan parak”. EvenifSivaprakash believed that he was delivering “paan parak” and not the controlled drugs (a contention which I reject, for the reasons set out below at [106]–[124]), that does not change thefactof his possession of the Drug Bundles.",
        "Whether Low has successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA": "89 I turn now to discuss the respective defences of Low and Sivaprakash that they had no knowledge of the nature of the drugs.",
        "The applicable law": "90 To be clear, the Prosecution relies on the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA and the burden is on the accusedto rebutthis presumption by proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have knownthe nature of the controlled drug referred to in the charge:Dinesh Pillai a/l K RajaRetnam v Public Prosecutor[2012] 2 SLR 903 (“Dinesh Pillai”) at [18]. Counsel for Low erroneously submits that “[t]he Prosecution must show that Low knew of the existence of the drugs at the time he received it,ie, actual knowledgesimpliciter, or he must have been willfully blind to the drugs”.163Foot Note 163×D1 CS at para 80.This is not the applicable law when the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA is relied upon. 91 InZainal bin Hamad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2018] 2 SLR 1119 (“Zainal”), the Court of Appeal summarised the proper analytical approach to be adopted when considering whether the accused has rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA (at [23]): We turn briefly to the second argument that Mr Fernando raised, namely, that on the facts Zainal had rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA that he knew the nature of the drugs. The proper analytical approach to be adopted when considering this was laid down by us inObeng Comfort v PP[2017] 1 SLR 633 at [39]–[40] as supplemented by our observations inHarven([13]supra) at [2] and can be summarised as follows: (a)     The presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA applies where the accused is “proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession”, that is to say, by proving the fact of possession or by relying on the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA, assuming this has not been rebutted. Where the presumption of knowledge applies, the accused is presumed to know the nature of the drug. (b)     The accused bears the burden of rebutting the presumption of knowledge on a balance of probabilities. As a matter of common sense and practical application, he should be able to say what he thought or believed he was carrying, and a claim that he simply did not know what he was carrying would not usually suffice. (c)     Once the accused has stated what he thought he was carrying, the court would then assess the veracity of the accused’s assertion against the objective facts to determine whether the accused’s account should be believed. (d)     However, because of the inherent difficulties of proving a negative, the burden on the accused should not be made so onerous that it becomes virtually impossible to discharge. 92 For the reasons set out below, I am satisfied that Low hasnotrebutted the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA on a balance of probabilities, keeping in mind the Court of Appeal’s statement that the burden on the accused should not be made so onerous that it becomes virtually impossible to discharge (Zainalat [23(d)]).",
        "Low’s claim that he had no knowledge of the contents of the white plastic bag": "93 I start by dealing with Low’s claim that he had no knowledge of what the white plastic bag contained. A key plank of this defence is based on Low’s repeated assertions, at trial and in his statements, that hedid not check thecontents of the white plastic bag. In addition, he claims that it was dark at the time he collected the bag from Sivaprakash and that the bag was tied up.164Foot Note 164×D1 CS at paras 73, 84 – 85. 94 The objective evidence before me, however, gives reason to doubt Low’s claim. The assertion that Low did not check the contents of the white plastic bag is at odds with the undisputed evidence that Low’s DNA was found on theinteriorof the white plastic bag containing the Drug Bundles.165Foot Note 165×PCS at para 66; AB at p 41.While I accept the testimony of the HSA analyst, Wong Hang Yee, that the DNA analysis “[would not] be able to tell the exact position on where it [ie, the interior of the white plastic bag] has been touched”, it nonetheless gives me reason to doubt Low’s repeated assertions that he had not checked the contents of the white plastic bag and had no knowledge of what it contained. 95 I also find that the white plastic bag wasuntiedat the time Low received it from Sivaprakash. Sivaprakash consistently maintained in his statements and at trial that the white plastic bag was untied when he handed it to Low.166Foot Note 166×NE 25082022 at p 33 ln 4 – 9.Insp Jason, who carried out the search of the PMD at about 7.03am in the Unit (above at [33]), maintained in both his conditioned statement and his testimony at trial167Foot Note 167×AB at p 94, para 8; NE 26072022 at p 80 ln 5 – 11 (Insp Jason).that the white plastic bag was untied at the time it was recovered from the PMD. Thus, even assuming (which I do not) that the bag was tied at the time Sivaprakash handed it to Low, it would have been the case that Low had untied the white plastic bag at some point in time when it was in his possession, and this is corroborated by the evidence of Low’s DNA found on the interior of the white plastic bag (as above at [94]).168Foot Note 168×AB at p 41.",
        "Low’s claim that he could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the drugs": "96 Low also argues that the circumstances were not so highly suspicious that he should have enquired into the contents of the white plastic bag.169Foot Note 169×D1 CS at para 91.He relies on this to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. For the reasons set out below (at [97]–[102]), I do not accept Low’s assertions that hecould not reasonably be expected to have knownthe nature of the drugs in the white plastic bag he received from Sivaprakash (Dinesh Pillaiat [18]). Accordingly, I find that Low has failed to rebut the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA on a balance of probabilities. 97 The sum of S$9,000 involved as well as the clandestine nature of the ‘job’ that Low was asked to perform, taken together with the payment of S$500 that he received, would have put Low on notice. Low claims to have met his friend, one “Liu Lian Kia” (“Liu”), at a coffeeshop near his home and asked Liu whether there was any job he could recommend to Low. The following day, Liu telephoned Low and asked to meet. At the meeting, Liu told Low to pay attention to the telephone number which he had used, because someone would be contacting Low on the same number and Low was to follow the instructions of the person who called.170Foot Note 170×D1 CS at para 5.Liu also passed Low a bag containing S$9,000 in cash. Subsequently, on 30 May 2019, a Malaysian who identified himself as “Ah Boy” (“Ah Boy”) contacted Low using that telephone number and instructed him to hand over the S$9,000 to a man wearing a red helmet (who later turned out to be Sivaprakash) at the bus stop near Low’s block,171Foot Note 171×D1 CS at para 6.in exchange for the plastic bag and its contents. 98 Low says that the sum of S$9,000 was not such a large sum of money in light of his “checkered past with crimes” and the history of odd jobs he had previously taken on, as to put him on notice.172Foot Note 172×D1 CS at para 91.He has had a history with crimes involving armed robbery, association with secret societies, gambling, jumping bail and credit card fraud.173Foot Note 173×D1 CS at para 91.To his mind, he claims, the S$9,000 “could have been for a variety of purposes” and he had never dealt in or been involved with drugs despite his long association with the criminal world.174Foot Note 174×D1 CS at paras 92–93.Furthermore, he had been warned by the chief of the mafia group to which he belonged, that if any member was involved in drug consumption, they would be kicked out.175Foot Note 175×D1 CS at para 82; NE 16082022 at p 23 ln 19 – 23.However, the fact remains that S$9,000 is a substantial sum of money and would naturally have raised questions in the mind of any reasonable person of the nature of the ‘job’ that Low was undertaking and, more importantly, the contents of the white plastic bag. 99 Low asserted at trial that the payment of S$500 that he received from Liu for performing the ‘job’ was merely a loan and not payment.176Foot Note 176×PCS at para 74(a); NE 16082022 at p 27 ln 1 – 2.I do not accept this assertion as Low had consistently referred to the S$500 as payment for making the delivery in his investigative statements, namely, in his Cautioned Statement and his First Long Statement.177Foot Note 177×PCS at para 74(a); AB at p 218, p 223, para 19 and pp 235 – 236.He also conceded under cross-examination that Liu never told him that the money was a loan or that he had to return the money.178Foot Note 178×PCS at para 74(b); NE 17082022 at p 22 ln 13 – 17.I find that the sum of S$500 would have been significant to Low at that point in time as, by his own admission, he was unemployed and was in financial need two days before his arrest – he only had S$600 on hand, which was insufficient to pay both his rent and gamble.179Foot Note 179×PCS at para 68; D1 CS at para 3; NE 16082022 at p 26 ln 17 – 24.Furthermore, this sum of S$500 was offered to Low as payment for a relatively simple task, namely, to deliver a single item on a specific day. 100 By Low’s own admission, he claims not to have asked “Ah Boy” about what items he was supposed to receivebecause he did not apply his mind to it.180Foot Note 180×PCS at para 69(a); NE 17082022 at p 28 ln 11 – 15.This is insufficient because an accused person who simply does not bother or does not want to know what drugs or even what goods he is going to carry will not be able to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA:Public Prosecutor v Gobi a/lAvedian[2019] 1 SLR 113 at [35];Gobi a/lAvedian v Public Prosecutor[2021] 1 SLR 180 (“Gobi (2021)” at [67] and [68]. InGobi (2021), the Court of Appeal affirmed that this is because of the need to give full purposive effect to the policy underlying the MDA, which is to stem the threat that drug trafficking poses (citingTanKiam Peng v Public Prosecutor[2008] 1 SLR 1at [23]–[28]). 101 Further, Low expects the courtto believethat he had complied with odd instructionsfrom a strangerwithout knowing what exactly the job entailed. On the contrary, there is evidence that suggests that Low would have been keenly aware of the cost-benefit analysis involved before accepting any instructions that could implicate him in a crime. Low himself testified that in the previous robberies he committed, he would ascertain what the intended spoils of and his role in the robbery would bebeforecommitting it, even when the partner-in-crime was his friend.181Foot Note 181×PCS at para 69; NE 16082022 at p 12 ln 26 – p 14 ln 5. 102 My conclusion is further buttressed by the fact that Low received the white plastic bag from Sivaprakash without asking him what it contained. I find this to be indicative of the furtive nature of the exchange between Low and Sivaprakash.182Foot Note 182×PCS at para 69(b); NE 17082022 at p 33 ln 9 – 10.Yet, Low was able to confirm with “Ah Boy” that he had received the items that he was meant to collect. Low recalled that “Ah Boy” had called him right after the transaction to ask if Low had received “the things”, and Low replied that he had.183Foot Note 183×PCS at para 70; NE 16082022 at p 28 ln 17 – 19; NE 17082022 at p 35 ln 13 – 23.By the reference to “the things”, Low claimed to have known that “Ah Boy” was referring to the contents of the white plastic bag, although he did not know what it contained.184Foot Note 184×PCS at para 70; NE 17082022 at p 35 ln 24 – 29.In my view, there is reason for doubt as there is no evidence that “Ah Boy” had mentioned a white plastic bag in his instructions to Low over the telephone call. 103 In light of the above, I do not accept Low’s assertions that hecould not reasonably be expected to have knownthe nature of the drugs in the white plastic bag he received from Sivaprakash (Dinesh Pillaiat [18]). Low has therefore not successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. I reiterate that the authorities cited by Low’s counsel on wilful blindness are not helpful since, as I have explained above at [90], the Prosecution is relying on the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA andnotthat it will prove wilful blindness beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, regardless of SI Sunny’s statement that he did not think Low to be a drug traffickerat the point in time of recordingthe latter’s Contemporaneous Statement,185Foot Note 185×D1 CS at para 94.the question before me is whether the evidence discloses that the elements of a charge under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA are satisfied, and not whether the arresting CNB officer thought so at the point of arrest.",
        "Whether Sivaprakash has successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA": "104 The Prosecution similarly relies on the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA in relation to Sivaprakash. Sivaprakash’s defence rests on his claim that he did not know the nature of the drugs as he believed that he was delivering “paan parak”,186Foot Note 186×D2 CS at para 29(d).which he also equated to be a form of betel nuts,187Foot Note 187×NE 23082022 at p 55 ln 19 – 24.to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA. 105 The abovementioned principles at [91] are apposite. The burden is on Sivaprakashto rebutthe presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA by proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have knownthe nature of the controlled drug referred to in the charge:Dinesh Pillaiat [18]. I find Sivaprakash’s claim to have believed that he was delivering “paan parak” to be more fanciful than real and contradicted by the objective evidence before the court. I explain.",
        "The nature of Sivaprakash’s relationship with “Joe”": "106 Sivaprakash says that “Joe” requested for help from him in collecting and delivering “paan parak”. Sivaprakash was, however, unable to provide a credible account of the nature of his relationship with “Joe” such as to explain why he would willingly agree to perform a delivery of “paan parak” for “Joe”.188Foot Note 188×PCS at para 34.Throughout his investigative statements, Sivaprakash consistently maintained that “Joe” was merely a clubbing acquaintance whom he had gotten to know about two months prior to his arrest.189Foot Note 189×AB at p 229, para 15;He elaborated that he did not spend time with “Joe” outside of drinking sessions on Saturday nights, that he had not saved “Joe’s” name in his telephone contacts and that he did not even know “Joe’s” real name.190Foot Note 190×AB at pp 262 – 263, para 30.However, at trial, he made two conflicting claims. On the one hand, he could not say that he and “Joe” were not close as “Joe” would call him and they would speak on the phone daily.191Foot Note 191×PCS at para 36; NE 24082022 at p 29 ln 2 – 4.The call logs also show that Sivaprakash and “Joe” had exchanged 113 calls between 4 April 2019 and 30 May 2019.192Foot Note 192×PCS at para 36.Yet on the other hand, he also maintained that he and “Joe” were not close as, according to him, the two of them had “just started to get to know each other”.193Foot Note 193×NE 24082022 at p 30 ln 10 – 14.Lastly, in his written submissions, Sivaprakash takes the position that he and “Joe” were friends and it could not be said that they would not do favours for each other, such as to collect and deliver the alleged “paan parak”.194Foot Note 194×D2 Reply at para 43. 107 In my view, Sivaprakash’s shifting accounts cast doubt on therealnature of his relationship with “Joe”. More importantly, it begs the question of why he would agree to help deliver “paan parak” for someone he initially claimed to not be close to, much less in as clandestine a manner as that which took place (to which I now turn to discuss).",
        "Sivaprakash’s claim to have believed that he was delivering “paan parak”": "108 Sivaprakash claims to have believed that he was delivering “paan parak” as “Joe” had told him that it was so.195Foot Note 195×D2 CS at para 28(c)-(d); D2 Reply at para 12(b).Sivaprakash says that “Joe” had asked him for help in delivering an item and when Sivaprakash asked what the item was, he was told by “Joe” that it would be three packets of “paan parak”. He then asked “Joe” if the “paan parak” looks like betel nuts and which Indian nationals consume, to which “Joe” replied that it was so.196Foot Note 196×D2 CS at para 28(b)-(d).Sivaprakash further claims that, upon collecting the packets from the black bag at the specified location, he hadopenedthe packets, checked and found that their contents “did look like paan parak and smelled like betel nuts”.197Foot Note 197×D2 CS at para 29(d).He then transferred the packets into a white plastic bag as the original black bag in which they had been found was torn.198Foot Note 198×D2 CS at para 28(f). 109 In support of his case, Sivaprakash asked his wife to buy betel nuts, which he equated with “paan parak”, from a shop in Singapore. These exhibits are before me as exhibits ‘2DW3’ and ‘2DW4’. He claims that by comparing 2DW3 and 2DW4 with the Drug Bundles, it “cannot be said that they look so very completely different from each other”.199Foot Note 199×D2 CS at para 27.Nonetheless, regardless of whether “paan parak”in factlooks similar to the controlled drugs found in Sivaprakash’s possession, I find it implausible that Sivaprakash couldreasonablyhave believed that he was delivering “paan parak” as this is squarely contradicted by the evidence before the court. 110 Sivaprakash was unable to explain why, if hereallybelieved that the Drug Bundles were “paan parak”, there was a need to pack and deliver them in such a clandestine manner as that which took place, why he was paid RM1,000 to make a delivery of “paan parak” and why he received S$9,000 in cash from Low in the course of the delivery. 111 The clandestine nature of the delivery is evident. “Joe’s” instructions, according to Sivaprakash, were to collect an item from a black bag behind a dustbin near the vicinity of the bus stop after the roundabout after Tuas Checkpoint (the “Tuas Bus Stop”),200Foot Note 200×D2 CS at para 28(c); D2 Reply at para 13.and deliver it to “someone with a cap” at 326 Sumang Walk.201Foot Note 201×D2 CS at para 28(b); D2 Reply at para 13.When Sivaprakash enquired what the item was, “Joe” told him that it was “paan parak” and that there would be three such packets inside the black bag at the Tuas Bus Stop.202Foot Note 202×D2 CS at para 28(c).Sivaprakash himself knew that “paan parak” was not high-value, as he testified that he knew, prior to his arrest, that “paan parak” was sold in sundry shops or drink stalls as a snack to be consumed while drinking alcohol,203Foot Note 203×PCS at para 49; AB at p 279, para 22; NE 23082022 at p 51 ln 6 – 8.although he was evasive when asked if he thought that “paan parak” was legal or illegal in Singapore.204Foot Note 204×NE23082022 at p 55 ln 9 – 29.Despite the odd nature of these instructions, Sivaprakash did not ask “Joe” why he had to collect and deliver the “paan parak” in this manner.205Foot Note 205×PCS at para 41; NE 24082022 at p 34 ln 16 – p 35 ln 3. 112 In return, Sivaprakash received S$9,000 in cash from Low and was promised a payment of RM1,000 for performing this delivery. These are relatively substantial sums of money and would have put Sivaprakash on notice that the items he was delivering could not have been innocuous or low in value.206Foot Note 206×PCS at para 48.I reject Sivaprakash’s claim that the RM1,000 was merelya loanthat he had requested from “Joe” the day before, for help in paying his elder brother’s medical fees. This was an assertion that first surfaced only in the course of his forensic psychiatric evaluation on 14 June 2019, 20 June 2019 and 26 June 2019 at the Changi Prison Complex Medical Centre207Foot Note 207×AB at p 65, para 13.and, later, at trial.208Foot Note 208×PCS at para 51(a); NE 23082022 at p 29 ln 8 – 23.In Sivaprakash’s investigative statements, he had consistently referred to the RM1,000 as a payment for the delivery, that “Joe” would (in his words) “give” to himafterthe delivery was completed.209Foot Note 209×AB at pp 228 – 229, paras 14 – 15; AB at p 263, para 31. 113 I also reject Sivaprakash’s claim that he initially did not want to take the S$9,000 in cash that Low handed to him and which was subsequently seized from the Motorcycle. Sivaprakash explained that “Joe” had not informed him to collect any cash for the delivery.210Foot Note 210×D2 CS at para 28(i).I find this to be Sivaprakash’s belated attempt to distance himself from the sum of S$9,000. Neither Sivaprakash nor Low, in their investigative statements, had indicated that Sivaprakash was initially unwilling to accept the cash.211Foot Note 211×PCS at para 52; AB at p 220, para 8; AB at p 227, para 9.Only at trial, Sivaprakash testified that he took the moneyafterLow told him to “take this money and give it to him” and scolded him using vulgarities.212Foot Note 212×NE 25082022 at p 34 ln 17 – 29.He stated that he did not ask Low any further questions or ask Low why he was giving him the money because he was afraid that Low might hit him,213Foot Note 213×NE 25082022 at p 35 ln 19 – 21.which is at odds with the reason he had previously given in his First Long Statement:214Foot Note 214×AB at p 227, para 9. … I was wondering why the man wearing the white cap gave me money. The man wearing the white cap told me “Sembilan ribu”, which means SGD$9000. The money was bound by rubber bands and I could see that the top of the stack was SGD$50. I then put the money inside my bag and put my bag in the front basket of my bike. I did not ask the man wearing the white cap why he gave me the money. I did not ask the man wearing the white capbecause it did not occur tome and it was because I was getting late for work.I did not utter any word to the man wearing the white cap. … [emphasis added] 114  To explain why he had not previously mentioned his reluctance to receive the S$9,000 in his First Long Statement, Sivaprakash claims that this was because he did not know if he could use a vulgar term in his statements to the police.215Foot Note 215×NE 25082022 at p 36 ln 9 – 14.I do not find this to be persuasive. In any case, it is incredible that Sivaprakash would not have asked Low what the money was for or who he was meant to deliver it to, if he was genuinely not expecting to receive it.216Foot Note 216×PCS at para 52(c).By Sivaprakash’s own account, he did not speak to Low at all during the brief exchange.217Foot Note 217×NE 25082022 at p 35 ln 19 – 21. 115 In light of the above, I reject Sivaprakash’s claim to have believed that he was delivering “paan parak” as “Joe” had told him so.",
        "Sivaprakash’s claim to have checked the content of the Drug Bundles and found it similar to “paan parak”": "116 The next key plank of Sivaprakash’s defence is that he had, upon collecting the packets from the black bag at the specified location,openedthe packets, checked and found that their contents did look like “paan parak” and smelled aromatic as betel nuts would.218Foot Note 218×D2 CS at paras 28(f) and 29(d).In his words, the contents were “aromatic” and “the aroma was akin to betel nuts”.219Foot Note 219×NE 23082022 at p 9 ln 1 – 19; D2 Reply at para 17.He thus believed that he was delivering “paan parak”, as “Joe” had told him. 117 I am unable to accept this claim in light of the inconsistencies in Sivaprakash’s evidence as to whether he actuallyknewwhat “paan parak” would look and smell like. In Sivaprakash’s Third Long Statement, he stated that he had only seen the packets in which “paan parak” was sold in Malaysian stores but had “never seen what the things inside looks like”,ie, he did not know what “paan parak” looked like.220Foot Note 220×AB at p 279.At trial, however, he took a different position, namely, that he knew what “paan parak” looked like,221Foot Note 221×NE 25082022 at p 57 ln 18 – 20.on the basis that he had witnessed Indian nationals buying and consuming the contents of these packages of “paan parak” sold in Malaysian stores.222Foot Note 222×NE 23082022 at p 50 ln 21-30 and p 52 ln 20 – 28.However, he also admitted that he had never seen “paan parak” being packed in the same way as how the Drug Bundles were packed.223Foot Note 223×AB at p 279. 118 Sivaprakash also claims to have known how “paan parak” would smell like. He says that he had been close by when an Indian national opened a packet of “paan parak” and tried to consume it.224Foot Note 224×NE23082022 at p 54 ln 16 – 25.However, he was inconsistent in his descriptions of the olfactory check he allegedly conducted on the Drug Bundles. In Sivaprakash’s First Long Statement, he underscored the importance of the olfactory check and described the Drug Bundles as “aromatic”:225Foot Note 225×AB at p 227, para 8. … I thought the things inside the black plastic bag were \"paan parak\" because \"Joe\" told me it was that.It was also because it was aromatic. … [emphasis added] 119 In Sivaprakash’s Fourth Long Statement, however, he stated instead that “paan parak” smelled like betel nuts and that he“[did]not knowif‘Paan Parak’ is aromatic or not” [emphasis added].226Foot Note 226×PCS at para 45(a); AB at p 288 Q/A 1.At trial, he tried to explain that “the aroma was alike to betel nuts”227Foot Note 227×NE 23082022 at p 9 ln 10.and what he had meant by the statement in his Fourth Long Statement:228Foot Note 228×NE 23082022 at p 54 ln 13 – 21. Q:  … I now want to refer you to answer 1 to then Insp Vinod’s question. That’s found on the second page of P79A. Your answer here is: “All I said was that when I took out the bundles from the torn plastic bag, it was aromatic. I do not know if paan parak is aromatic or not. It smells like betel nut.” Is this recording of your answer correct or incorrect? A:  I did not know how to explain the aroma of paan parak would be. Therefore, I said that it would smell like betel nut. 120 This is, however, not convincing. It is a belated attempt by Sivaprakash to conflate his description of the Drug Bundles as both “aromatic” and smelling “like betel nuts”. In light of these inconsistencies, I am unable to accept that Sivaprakash knew what “paan parak” would look and smell like. 121 Additionally, Sivaprakash’s account ofhowhe had checked the contents of the Drug Bundles is contradicted by the objective evidence before me. For instance, in respect of the two clear plastic bundles with black tape (exhibits ‘A1B1’ and ‘A1B2’), he says that he had unravelled the black tapein one intact pieceuntil he could see enough of the contents, before wrapping the bundle back to look exactly as it did when seized and recovered by the arresting CNB officers.229Foot Note 229×NE 23082022 at p 11 ln 1 – 20.A copy of the photograph showing exhibits ‘A1B1’, ‘A1B2’ and ‘A1B3’ is reproduced as follows:  Fig 4. Photograph of exhibits ‘A1B1’, ‘A1B2’, ‘A1B3’ 122 From the state of the Drug Bundles as photographed during exhibit processing, I find Sivaprakash’s account to be implausible. The Drug Bundles were wrapped so neatly and tightly that they had to becut openduring exhibit processing.230Foot Note 230×PCS at para 42(b). 123 Furthermore, Sivaprakash never mentioned unwrapping the Drug Bundles in any of his investigative statements. When shown a photograph of the black taped packaging containing the Fourth Drug Bundle, he claimed in his Second Long Statement that the packaging was “already like that” when he collected it from the Tuas Bus Stop.231Foot Note 231×PCS at para 42(a); AB at pp 259 – 260, paras 19 – 20.I thus do not accept that Sivaprakash had opened and checked the contents of the Drug Bundles in the manner that he asserts, or indeed in any manner at all. 124 Having regard to the above, I find that Sivaprakash is unable to successfully rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. Sivaprakash’s claim that he did not know the nature of the drugs as he believed the Drug Bundles to be “paan parak”, is patently at odds with the evidence before me and thus rejected.",
        "Whether the requirements under s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA are satisfied": "125 In the circumstances, I find that the elements of the offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA are made out in respect of both Low and Sivaprakash. 126 Accordingly, the final issues which lie before me are whether Low and Sivaprakash respectively are “couriers” pursuant to s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA. The answer to this question has a direct impact on Low’s and Sivaprakash’s respective possible eligibility for the alternative sentence under s 33B(2) of the MDA.",
        "Low was a “courier” pursuant to s 33B(2)(a) of theMDA": "127 In an oft-cited passage fromPublic Prosecutor v Chum Tat Suan[2015] 1 SLR 834, the Court of Appeal held (at [68]) that someone “who receives the drugs and transmits them in exactly thesame formin which they were receivedwithout an alteration and adulteration” [emphasis added] would properly be considered a “courier” under s 33B of the MDA. In this case, the Prosecution does not dispute that Low was a “courier” under s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA in this sense.232Foot Note 232×PRS at paras 17 – 18 (Low); 26 – 27 (Sivaprakash).I agree. His instructions, and indeed the role that he was carrying out in the offence under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA, were simply to deliver the contents of the white plastic bag to someone who would be waiting for him at Blk 986C Buangkok Crescent. There was no drug paraphernalia or other packing materials found on him,233Foot Note 233×D1 CS at para 103.and neither does the evidence before me show that he was involved in doing somethingmorethan just \"transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug\". Accordingly, I am satisfied that Low was a “courier” pursuant to s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA.",
        "Sivaprakash was a “courier” pursuant to s 33B(2)(a) of theMDA": "128 Similarly, the parties agree that Sivaprakash’s involvement in the offence was that of a “courier” under s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA. Sivaprakash says that his role in the offence, per “Joe’s” instructions, was restricted to collecting and delivering the contents of the white plastic bag to a man (who later turned out to be Low) at the Sumang Walk Bus Stop.234Foot Note 234×D2 CS at para [39]. 129 The Prosecution acknowledges that it has led evidence suggesting that Sivaprakash had packed the Drug Bundles before bringing them into Singapore. First, Sivaprakash’s DNA was found on the tape and the cling film of the two black taped packaging marked ‘A1A’ and ‘A1B3’. His DNA was also found on the tape and cling film of the two clear plastic packaging with black tape marked ‘A1B1’ and ‘A1B2’.235Foot Note 235×SOF at para 47.Collectively, the exhibits ‘A1A’, ‘A1B1’, ‘A1B2’ and ‘A1B3’ contained the Drug Bundles. Sivaprakash claims that his DNA was found because he had opened and inspected all of the Drug Bundles after collecting them from the Tuas Bus Stop.236Foot Note 236×D2 Reply at para 23.Second, photographs extracted from Sivaprakash’s mobile phone depicted brown granular substances packaged in almost identical fashion to the Drug Bundles,237Foot Note 237×PCS at para 47.despite Sivaprakash claiming that he had never seen what he asserted to be “paan parak” packaged like the Drug Bundles prior to collecting them.238Foot Note 238×AB at p 279 para [33]; NE 24082022 at p 2 ln 12-16; NE 25082022 at p 62 ln 21-30.Third, Sivaprakash’s wife testified in court that Sivaprakash had informed her that he had brought the items (ie, the purported “paan parak”)into Singapore,239Foot Note 239×PCS at para 43; NE 26082022 at p 25 ln 27 – p 26 ln 12.although she later changed her position after a short stand-down in the court proceedings. Sivaprakash was unable to offer a satisfactory explanation for this inconsistency in his wife’s account. 130 It is unnecessary for me to make a finding on whether Sivaprakash had indeed packed the Drug Bundles before bringing them into Singapore. In any case, as the Prosecution accepts, there is no evidence suggesting that the act of packing (if any) was anything more than afacilitativeact in respect of Sivaprakash’s delivery of the Drug Bundles,240Foot Note 240×PRS at para 27.in that it enabled or assisted Sivaprakash to deliver the Drug BundlesinSingapore (and not to accomplish any unrelated aims which he might have had in mind):Zainudinbin Mohamed v Public Prosecutor[2018] 1 SLR 449 at [82]. 131 Accordingly, I find that Sivaprakash was also a “courier” pursuant to s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA.",
        "Conclusion": "132 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the elements of the charge under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA are established in respect of both Low and Sivaprakash. As to sentencing, I find that Low and Sivaprakash were both “couriers” pursuant to s 33B(2)(a) of the MDA.
