        "My findings of fact": "87 As recited earlier, the Licence\n\nAgreement in terms of clause 11 may be terminated on notice and in the absence of any\n\nremedial action within the prescribed period. The construction that there was an agreement\n\nto provide the Technology in perpetuity is unsustainable. Although that is referred to in\n\nthe recital, it is negated by the express terms of clause 11. On the evidence which I have\n\nrecited, I am satisfied that Phua had failed to pay the Royalty and had deliberately\n\nfailed to do so. Panatron had the financial ability to do so but it failed to remit the\n\nRoyalty of A$10,000.00 due and payable. I accept Dettrick’s evidence that the Licence\n\nAgreement would not have been terminated if Phua had caused Panatron to pay the Royalty at\n\nany time before the notice of termination took effect. It is not true that Lee had\n\nconcealed one of the invoices. He was not in charge of the financial affairs of Panatron.\n\nPhua was. Lee had limited access to the financial and accounting records of Panatron and\n\nthe group. No payment could be made without Phua’s approval who maintained an iron\n\ngrip on the finances of Panatron. Phua and not Lee withheld the payment of the Royalty.\n\nLee’s evidence is worthy of belief.88 Lee found his work and the duties not\n\nonly more and more unsatisfactory but he also found that the financial affairs of Panatron\n\nwere conducted in ways that could compromise his professional obligations as a certified\n\npublic accountant. Although he had committed himself by his investments, he was compelled\n\nto extricate himself as quickly as possible from a rapidly deteriorating situation where\n\nthe accounts of Panatron were not kept according to law. So he inevitably resigned and\n\nleft the employment of Panatron.89 His engagement as a consultant by\n\nDettrick after the Licence Agreement was duly terminated and the role he played in trying\n\nto find a solution to the problems faced by Panatron following the termination of the\n\nLicence Agreement are entirely unobjectionable in law. He had left the employ and\n\ndirectorship of Panatron and was free to pursue his profession and earn a living. He was\n\nnot in a position of conflict. He was indeed subject to the clause requiring him \"not\n\nto use…any confidential information revealed to him by Panatron.\" But there is\n\nno evidence of any breach of this covenant; there is no evidence of any confidential\n\ninformation passed on to Dettrick. What he knew of Panatron was in the public domain and\n\nknown to Dettrick who was at one stage talking with Phua of a joint venture before the\n\nLicence Agreement was signed. Except for general allegations by Phua, Lee’s services\n\nto Dettrick were rendered as a Consultant to Chemind Singapore which was engaged in a\n\nsimilar agreement to transfer Dettrick’s technology. He did not use any confidential\n\ninformation to assist Dettrick or Chemind Singapore.90 Yin did not give any assurance to\n\nPanatron, its Board or Phua that he would resolve the termination of the Licence Agreement\n\nwith Dettrick nor did he say or represent that Panatron could pay the outstanding Royalty\n\nby the end of August 1997. I believe his evidence and reject those of Phua. Phua’s\n\nown letters referred to above and his own conduct were wholly inconsistent with Yin having\n\ngiven any such assurance or having made such a representation. It was a fact that Yin\n\nresigned as a director of Panatron on 22 September 1997 but remained a director of Chemind\n\nuntil February 1998. There was nothing sinister about it. Yin had no business arrangement\n\nwith Dettrick at all.91 Yin worked very hard to ensure that\n\nChemind performed well in the market. It was Phua who decided, and he alone decided, not\n\nto pay Dettrick the Royalty. It is true that Yin remained as a director of Chemind until\n\nFebruary 1998. There is not an iota of evidence to suggest that he had done anything or\n\nfailed to do any of his duties to further the alleged conspiracy. He too was compelled to\n\nleave the employ of Panatron and I accept the reasons he has given in evidence.92 Dettrick was also driven to terminate\n\nthe Licence Agreement because of Phua’s dilatory payments and Phua’s failure to\n\npay the outstanding Royalty notwithstanding his notice to move to termination under the\n\nLicence Agreement.. He did not enter into any agreement, combination or any arrangement\n\nwith either Lee or Yin to terminate the Licence Agreement under the pretences and\n\norchestration as alleged by Phua. He terminated it because of Panatron’s default in\n\npaying the Royalty despite the firm and clear written notice to pay. All the actions he\n\ntook were the consequential steps he had to take following the termination of the Licence\n\nAgreement to protect his legitimate business interest and the goodwill of his products.\n\nThey were not taken pursuant to any conspiracy at all.93 Phua relies heavily on the notes\n\nwritten by Dettrick on Panatron’s stationery which he had written to Dettrick on 19\n\nAugust 1997. Dettrick’s note to Yin was completely innocuous. I accept his evidence\n\nthat he did not send his written notes at the bottom of both pages to Yin. He noted them\n\nfor his own benefit and to protect his business interest as termination of the Licence\n\nAgreement seemed quite inevitable. I further accept the alarm he felt when he was told\n\nthat IRE Corporation Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of Nippon Paints, was the party with whom Phua\n\nhad agreed in principle to participate in a joint venture in respect of the same line of\n\nbusiness. His incorporation of his own company, Chemind Singapore, was the consequential\n\ncorporate step he had to take to protect his business interest in Singapore and the\n\nregion. It was natural for Dettrick to fall back on Yin, who has been a long-standing and\n\ntrustworthy friend. He also engaged Lee as a Consultant because he had the professional\n\nexpertise to offer.Breaches of contract and fiduciary duties94 Phua also alleges that both Lee and Yin\n\nhad committed breaches of their employment contracts and had also breached their fiduciary\n\nduties, having assisted and colluded with Dettrick as alleged, enticed customers away from\n\nPanatron and divulged and used confidential information and trade secrets of Panatron for\n\nthe benefit of Dettrick and Chemind Singapore. Panatron’s case against Lee and Yin\n\nwill now have to be considered, either separately or together whenever convenient to do\n\nso. .95 Lee, as noted earlier, had agreed\n\n\"not to engage or assist any third parties in business activities which are competing\n\nwith Panatron’s, its subsidiary and/or associate companies’ business\n\nactivities.\" It will be noted that the clause is unlimited both as to time and as to\n\nspace and I agree with counsel for Lee that it is unreasonable: see Chitty on Contracts,\n\n28thed., vol. 1, para 17-111. In any case, Lee did not help Dettrick or\n\nChemind Singapore in the business of selling the coating products. Chemind Singapore was\n\nincorporated after the termination of the Licence Agreement of Panatron which was never in\n\nthe business of sub-licensing the coatings technology to manufacturers. Lee could not\n\nconceivably be engaging or assisting Chemind Singapore to \"compete\" with\n\nPanatron in a business which Panatron never had. Panatron’s association in any form\n\nwith Dettrick’s Chemtour ended before Chemind Singapore was incorporated under the\n\nlaws of Singapore.96 Panatron further allege that Lee and\n\nYin used and divulged confidential information or trade secrets of Panatron. The alleged\n\nconfidential information and/or trade secrets are set out in Schedule 1 to the Amended\n\nStatement of Claim. They are the names of customers, shareholdings of the group, unique\n\nmarketing strategy (covering positioning and promotion strategies relating to product\n\nfeatures, product pricing, distribution network and contract tendering process jointly\n\nwith independent contractors), product names and business transactions covering matters\n\nfrom customer enquiries to payment period and product warranty. Items 7 to 20 of the\n\nCustomers List could be ignored because Phua agreed that Panatron never sold products\n\ndirectly to the Town Councils or the managing agents. Yin explained in evidence that after\n\nthe termination of the Licence Agreement, Phua, he, Andrew Lim, the General Manager and\n\nKlement Koh, the Plant Manager, concluded that out of the finished products available at\n\nthat period of time Panatron could not fulfil any medium or large future orders. In fact,\n\nPhua was fully aware of the need to lessen the disruptions of supplies to customers of\n\nChemind and Panatron. He himself wrote to Dettrick on 20 August 1997 to assist Panatron\n\nfulfilling their orders by Dettrick supplying FL47T. Dettrick declined but offered to\n\nsupply directly to customers of Chemind and Panatron. Yin told the court that he and\n\nKlement Koh took all the steps with the intention of saving the business in the event that\n\nthe licence was reinstated.97 Phua alleges that on or about 8\n\nSeptember 1997 Yin had revealed the names of 6 customers to Dettrick. It should be noted\n\nthat of the 6 names, Phua had himself given the names of 3 of them to Dettrick in his\n\nletter of 20 August 1997, namely Chin Leong Corp., Solely Construction Pte Ltd and Ace\n\nSeal Pte Ltd/IRE Corporation: see AB 507. Klement Koh with the concurrence of Phua\n\nrevealed to Dettrick Panatron’s customers Ace Seal Pte Ltd: see AB 555. In the course\n\nof the evidence it became obvious that Yin, Klement Koh and Phua had all acted in the\n\ninterest of Panatron and their customers to minimise any disruption of supplies committed\n\nto those customers by arranging with Dettrick to supply directly. All 3 were hoping for a\n\nreinstatement of the Licence Agreement.98 The rest of the alleged confidential\n\ninformation were in substance nothing confidential or of any proprietary content. For\n\nexample, I refer to the issue of HDB’s decision to move from bitumen and\n\npolyurethane-based products to water based products. Phua claims that Panatron had spent\n\nmuch effort and time to \"convince\" HDB to switch to their products, which are\n\nwater based. However, Panatron’s own independent witness, Kua Soon Chong, who worked\n\nfor a subsidiary of HDB which managed the Town Council HDB flats and projects, said that\n\nthe switch to water based products was the result of the study by HDB and SISIR. SISIR\n\ndrew up the performance specifications. In this instance, Panatron did not contribute to\n\nthe switch to the Chemtour products.99 In my judgment, Lee and Yin were not in\n\nbreach of any term, expressed or implied, in their contracts of employment and did not\n\nbreach any of their fiduciary duties which they owed to Panatron..Counterclaims of Lee & Yin100 Both Lee and Yin counterclaim against\n\nPanatron and Phua for damages for fraudulent misrepresentations made by Phua when inducing\n\nthem to invest in Panatron. They also seek to lift the corporate veil and allege that Phua\n\nwas in fact and in law the same as Panatron and Chemind and BTE, which are rather strong\n\nallegations and which for reasons I will set out later are not convincing. They also\n\nassert against Panatron restitutionary damages for total failure of consideration as it\n\nwas common ground that no shares in Panatron were ever issued to them.101 I turn to the claim for damages for\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation. The elements constituting a misrepresentation in the law of\n\ncivil wrong requires it to be a statement of fact; this is the element with which this\n\ncase is concerned in respect of all the allegations. There is no allegation which is a\n\nstatement of opinion as such. The question in both counterclaims, in respect of every\n\nallegation that a misrepresentation has been made by Phua, is a question of fact. In other\n\nwords, I have to decide if Phua had in fact and in truth told Lee and Yin the\n\nmisrepresentations of facts as they had respectively alleged. I need highlight, however,\n\nLee’s allegation that Phua had told him that he (Lee) \"would fulfil important\n\ntasks in (Panatron) including acting as (Panatron’s) financial controller and helping\n\nto re-organise (Panatron’s) finances and structure.\" Here, Phua is said to have\n\nexpressed his intentions with regard to the future role of Lee in the Panatron group and\n\nthe question for my determination whether he honestly held those intentions at the time he\n\nuttered them: seeEdgington v Fitzmaurice(1885) 29 Ch 459. There, the directors\n\nissued a prospectus falsely stating that the money to be raised would be used in the\n\nordinary course of business for business investments and expansion. The truth was that\n\nthey intended them to be used to pay off pressing liabilities. Bowen LJ said at p 483:\n\n\"A mere suggestion of possible purposes to which a portion of the money might be\n\napplied would not have formed a basis for an action of deceit. There must be a\n\nmisstatement of an existing fact; but the state of a man’s mind is as much a fact as\n\nthe state of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove what the state\n\nof a man’s mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it is as much a\n\nfact as anything else. A misrepresentation as to the state of a man’s mind is,\n\ntherefore, a misstatement of fact.\"102 Lee and Yin must allege and prove that\n\nthey relied on the misrepresentations of Phua, as Phua had intended, and that as a result\n\nthey had agreed to invest in Panatron and the group. As they allege that Phua had made\n\nfraudulent misrepresentations, and are suing for damages for deceit, they further have to\n\nallege and prove that Phua knew what he represented to be false or was reckless, without\n\ncaring as to whether it was true or not. They must also prove that they suffered damages\n\nas a result of the misrepresentations: seeDerry v Peek(1889) 14 App Cas 337 at\n\n379.103 I will recite briefly Lee’s\n\nevidence on this part of his claim against both Panatron and Phua. In the initial stages,\n\nPhua advised Lee to invest as soon as possible because the shares would be worth a lot\n\nmore in the future. Phua showed him a copy of Panatron’s Budget for 1996. It showed\n\nthat Panatron was budgeting a net profit of $187,825.00 for 1996. On 3 June 1996 Phua\n\nagain approached Lee and showed him a copy of the document known as \"Chemind\n\nFinancial Status\" dated 3 June 1996. It related to Chemind. It projected an operating\n\nprofit of $153,744.00. They met again on 16 October 1996. Phua showed him another document\n\nentitled \"Chemind Financial Status\" dated 16 October 1996. According to this\n\ndocument Chemind was making impressive profits of $395,940.00 on a shareholder’s fund\n\nof $600,000.00 or a net return of 66% which was very high on any view. Phua informed Lee\n\nof Chemind’s coating business and the Licence Agreement.104 On 9 November 1996 Lee informed Phua\n\nthat a company known as Yong Nam Engineering Pte Ltd (\"Yong Nam\") was interested\n\nto invest in Chemind. Phua showed Lee a document entitled \"Chemind Financial\n\nStatus\" dated 9 November 1996. It indicated a 69.9% return on investment. It was on\n\nthis occasion that he met Yin for the first time.105 Lee said in evidence that on 20\n\nJanuary 1997 Phua met him and persuaded him to join the Panatron group. Phua presented to\n\nhim a printout entitled \"Chemind Financial Status\" dated 20 January 1997. It\n\nstated that Chemind had made profits of $543,649.00 but on a lower shareholders’\n\nfunds of $250,000.00. Phua, when questioned, told Lee that the difference between the\n\nprevious figure and the new figure was due to his mistaken inclusion of $350,000.00 which\n\nwas in fact part of the paid-up capital of Panatron. Phua also stated that one Ivan Koo\n\nhad already subscribed for 200,000 shares at $1 each and was joining Panatron to handle\n\nregional marketing. Lee said later he discovered that Ivan Koo had not invested but had\n\ndone so three months later.106 Lee and Phua met again on 30 January\n\n1997 at Phua’s office. Phua assured him that he was not making a mistake and urged\n\nhim to trust him. Phua showed him a document, telling him that it was an amended copy of\n\nthe previous \"Chemind Financial Status\" dated 20 January 1997. The amended copy\n\nshowed that Chemind had made the significant profit of $558,460.00, showing a return on\n\ninvestments of $223.38% in a year. Lee was so impressed by this that he signed the Offer\n\nof Employment that evening.107 Lee said that in the course of the\n\nnegotiations Phua had told him that other directors and shareholders might object to his\n\nbuying in the group at a lower premium of 35% if he did not take up Phua’s offer\n\nimmediately. Phua also represented to Lee that with his entry Panatron would have 2\n\nmillion shares, with among other parties 500,000 shares for Phua and 200,000 shares for\n\nIvan Koo. Lee told the court that after taking up his employment and having paid his\n\ninvestment instalments he discovered that it was not true that directors and shareholders\n\nmight object if he did not take up the offer, that Phua had invested $500,000.00 and that\n\nIvan Koo had invested $200,000.00.108 It will be recalled that Lee started\n\nhis employment with Panatron on 2 May 1997. Phua instructed him to handle the queries of\n\nLiap Huat Construction Pte Ltd (\"Liap Huat\"), a shareholder of Chemind, who were\n\nasking questions about Chemind’s accounts. Lee wanted the accounts for 1996 and the\n\ncurrent books of accounts for 1997. Phua told him the 1996 accounts were with the auditors\n\nand the 1997 account books were with Panatron’s part time bookkeeper, Ong Boon Leong\n\n(\"Ong\"). As for the bank statements, cheque books and cheque stubs, Phua said\n\nthat they had to be kept by him as they contained private information such as the salaries\n\nof individual employees, which he could not disclosed. Phua proposed that he would be\n\nresponsible for the past accounts and that Lee would be responsible for the accounts from\n\n1 May 1997. Phua said he would hand to Lee the reconciled statements.109 Around end of May 1997, Lee after some\n\ndifficulties managed to get hold of Panatron’s financial statements for the year\n\nended 31 March 1996 and the current books of accounts for 1997. He got them from Ong. The\n\naccounting records showed that Panatron incurred a loss of $800,000.00 and that Chemind\n\nhad incurred a loss of $195,000.00. He double-checked the figures and ascertained them to\n\nbe correct. On 5 June 1997 he informed Yin of the true financial state of affairs.110 On the evening of 5 June 1997 Phua\n\nconvened a meeting of the shareholders and investors of the Panatron group. Yin, an\n\ninvestor Gay Chee Cheong and Ivan Koo attended. Phua had earlier instructed Lee to come up\n\nwith a future strategy for the group. At the meeting, Phua reported that the sales of\n\nChemind were profitable. But Phua told those present that Panatron had to pay off the\n\ndebts owed to a company known as Sinnet Resources Pte Ltd which was controlled by Phua. He\n\nalso informed the meeting that Panatron, as agreed by previous directors, were to buy over\n\nhis shares in 2 companies which had invested in China and which had incurred losses. The\n\ntwo companies were Kang Yi Investment Pte Ltd and Sze Chiang Pte Ltd. All told, Panatron\n\nhad to pay $390,000.00. The shareholders and investors remonstrated with Phua but to no\n\navail. He insisted that Panatron had to pay. In closing discussions on the matters, he\n\nsaid: \"history is history and facts are facts\". The other shareholders and\n\ninvestors were indeed faced with a fait accompli. Lee went on to examine what strategy\n\nmight be adopted to salvage the situation.111 Lee reported to the meeting the losses\n\nwhich he had discovered the group had incurred. He and the other investors had committed\n\nthemselves and had substantially performed their part of their agreement to invest in\n\nPanatron and the group. He presented his thoughts in a series of slide presentations under\n\nthe rubric \"Recommending a Strategy-Ideas for Today and Tomorrow.\" He described\n\nhow Panatron got into its financial mess, its strengths and weaknesses. Then he proceeded,\n\nmore importantly, to consider the alternative strategies. There were essentially three\n\navailable options. The first option was to continue with the then strategy of direct\n\nproduction and sales for both BTE and the Chemtour products. Secondly, they could\n\nrepackage Chemind and sell as a franchise. Thirdly, they could try for a joint venture for\n\nChemind and BTE. The third option was pursued by Phua with IRE Corporation. However, no\n\ndetails were available.112 Phua denied having made any of these\n\nrepresentations. He put it out that Lee in fact was the party who was very keen to invest\n\nand join the management of Panatron. According to the subscription agreement, Lee was to\n\nhave paid $200,000 out of the sum of $270,000 by 1 May 1997, just before he took up\n\nemployment with Panatron. In the ordinary way, even if he found out the true state of\n\naffairs, he would have committed himself substantially. Phua claims that he was not\n\nlooking for any investor. But the fact was Panatron had lost about $900,000 by the end of\n\n1996 and was in great need for fresh funds. In my judgment, Phua did make all the\n\nrepresentations to Lee as Lee alleges. He knew, rather deceitfully, that they were all\n\nfalse. There is one misrepresentation of fact over which I have some reservations. I am\n\nnot prepared to say that he was dishonest when he told Lee that Lee would play an\n\nimportant role in Panatron and that he would be its financial controller. What could\n\npossibly have passed through his mind was the eternal hope that Lee could come in, clean\n\nup the mess that Panatron was in and start afresh as from 1 May 1997. But he was being too\n\noptimistic. Since it is not deceitful to be overly optimistic, I am not prepared to find\n\nthat he was dishonest when he made the representation about Lee’s future role.113 Yin’s evidence on this part of\n\nhis case was as follows. He resumed contact with Phua in April 1995. Phua showed him a\n\ndocument entitled \"Panatron Pte Ltd\" dated 10 January 1995 (AB2-9) together with\n\nanother document entitled \"Return of Investment Analysis\" dated 12 January 1995\n\n(AB10). Phua told him that Panatron and their companies were profitable. As is not\n\ndisputed before me, the group was making losses. In respect of the Ball Technic system,\n\nPhua represented to him that Panatron had 120 customers with orders for more than 400\n\nsystems. Yin later learnt that this was not true. In fact, as at mid August 1995 the total\n\nnumber of units sold were only 2. According to the manufacturing and marketing plans set\n\nout, especially in sections D and E in AB 4 & 5, Phua needed to increase the capital\n\nof Panatron by fourfold.114 Phua had also Yin that Panatron had\n\nbought over 60% of the shares in Sinnet Resources Pte Ltd.115 Yin further says that Phua told him\n\nanother deception: that he had invested $400,000 in Panatron in view of its potential. He\n\nsays that acting on the faith and truth of Phua’s representations and induced by\n\nthem, in May 1995, he agreed to enter into the employ of Panatron and he also agreed to\n\nsubscribe for 300,000 shares at $1 per share with 25% premium for the total price of\n\n$375,000.00. It was only during a Board meeting of Panatron on 28 August 1998 that Yin\n\ndiscovered that Phua had paid $270,000 to Panatron.116 Phua of course denied having made any\n\nof the representations to Yin. He said he was looking for an institutional investor. As\n\nfor the customers’ list, he claimed that they were \"serious contacts\". AB2\n\nand AB3 drew a distinction between potential customers, projected orders and actual\n\ncustomers. Phua was being disingenuous and dishonest in this part of his cross\n\nexamination. As for the shares in Sinnet, he claimed that payment was made and Panatron\n\nhad taken over the management. No documentary evidence of any kind was produced, when\n\nsupporting accounting documents must be easily available for production if in fact they\n\nexisted. Eventually, Phua said that Panatron paid for the Sinnet shares in December 1996.117 Considering the evidence as a whole, I\n\nam satisfied that Phua did make the fraudulent misrepresentations to Yin as Yin alleges,\n\nintending them to be acted upon and Yin did act on those deceitful misrepresentations and\n\ninvested in Panatron.",
        "Lifting the veil and restitutionary damages": "118 Lee and Yin both claim that Phua\n\nshould be equated with Panatron on the ground that the corporate veil should be lifted. On\n\nthe evidence, Phua and the Panatron group did have separate commercial existence.\n\nAdmittedly, Phua made all the major decisions but the Board was in place and many other\n\noperational decisions were made by the Board and other members of the staff such as Yin\n\nand Lee. There is insufficient evidence to justify any piercing of the corporate veil. The\n\nconcept of the separate legal personality of the company as set out inSalomon v\n\nSalomon & Co Ltd[1897] AC 22 should be upheld except in very limited\n\ncircumstances. No such circumstances have been proved in this case.119 As for the claim for restitutionary\n\ndamages, this cause of action is not sustainable. It was common ground that the agreements\n\nmade between Phua on behalf of Panatron on the one hand and Lee and Yin on the other\n\nconsisted both of the subscription agreements and the employment contracts. The\n\nconsideration for both types of agreement is as inseparable just as the two types of\n\nagreement were inextricably linked. Panatron would not have entered into one without the\n\nother in relation to both Lee and Yin. Both Lee and Yin were employed by Panatron.\n\nAccordingly, there was no total failure of consideration.Conclusions120 In the premises, Panatron’s\n\nclaims against the defendants are all dismissed with costs. There will be judgment with\n\ncosts for Lee and Yin against both Panatron and Phua personally for damages for fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentations which they intended them to act and which in fact induced them to\n\nsubscribe for the shares in Panatron. The damages will be sums they paid respectively\n\nunder their subscription agreement together with interest thereon calculated at 6% p.a.\n\nfrom the date of their counterclaims. Naturally, both Yin and Lee will not be allowed any\n\ndouble claim. They are also awarded with costs their claims against Panatron under their\n\nemployment contracts with interest thereon at 6% p.a. from the date of their\n\ncounterclaims. The parties are directed to appear before me to assist the court in\n\nsettling the terms of the orders of court to give effect to this judgment.Lai Kew ChaiJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
