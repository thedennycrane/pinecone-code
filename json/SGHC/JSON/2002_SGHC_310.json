        "Suit No. 1519 of 2001": "2.        This\n\nwas commenced on 30 November 2001. The Plaintiff is and was at all material times a member\n\nof the First Defendant (\"the TRC\"), an unincorporated association registered\n\nunder the Societies Act. The TRC is an umbrella body to which some Indian organizations\n\nare affiliated. The Second Defendant was at all material times the General Secretary of\n\nthe TRC.3.        The\n\nTRC’s Constitution sets out the aims and objects of the organization which are all\n\ndirected towards the safeguarding and the promotion of the interests of the Tamil speaking\n\ncommunity and their language. Rule 12 of the Constitution places the administration of the\n\nTRC in the hands of a Management Council (\"the MC\") which is elected biennially.\n\nUnder Rule 13, the MC is directed to meet at least once every month and notice of MC\n\nmeetings is to be given not less than seven days before the meetings. Rule 14 provides\n\nthat the General Secretary is to prepare the agenda and maintain the minutes of the MC and\n\nof the Annual General Meeting (\"AGM\") and the Extraordinary General Meeting\n\n(\"EOGM\").4.        The\n\nPlaintiff was elected as one of two Deputy General Secretaries of the TRC at the AGM held\n\non 23 July 2000. He would therefore have held such office in the MC until the next AGM in\n\n2002. However, at a MC meeting held on 15 February 2001, the Deputy President (S\n\nMoganaruban, the Second Defendant in Suit No. 801 of 2002) attempted to remove him from\n\nhis office despite the fact that such intention to remove him was not listed as an item in\n\nthe agenda for that MC meeting. The Plaintiff was \"charged\" with not showing\n\nproper respect to the President of the TRC and to the Chairman of the MC meetings. He was\n\nalso accused of being disruptive at MC meetings. This action took the Plaintiff completely\n\nby surprise. He was not given a reasonable opportunity to defend himself. The motion to\n\nremove him from office was put to a vote but was not carried as the requisite two-thirds\n\nmajority vote was not achieved.5.        The\n\nPlaintiff averred that the above attempt to remove him from office was invalid and\n\nineffective as it was ultra vires the Constitution. He alleged that the motion to remove\n\nhim was not in the agenda for that meeting and he did not have seven days’ notice of\n\nit in any event. There was also no formal charge produced so that he could be informed\n\nprecisely of the case he had to meet. He was not told of the provision of the Constitution\n\nunder which he was charged or was being dealt with and was not accorded a reasonable\n\nopportunity to defend himself. He averred further that the said attempt at removing him\n\nfrom office was made mala fides.6.        \n\nSince the MC considered a two-thirds majority vote was necessary to remove the Plaintiff\n\nfrom office, he averred that the motion must have proceeded under Rule 18.1 of the\n\nConstitution which provides:\"18.    \n\n    EXPULSION OF MEMBERS18.1    Any member whose conduct\n\n    is in the considered opinion of the MC prejudicial or contrary to the interest of the\n\n    Council, shall be requested to resign or be asked to exculpate himself in writing. If the\n\n    exculpatory statement, considered in the sole discretion of the MC exercised in good\n\n    faith, is unsatisfactory, the member shall be expelled by resolution carried by a majority\n\n    of the two third of the MC voting at the meeting at which the resolution is moved. Any\n\n    member so expelled shall have the right to appeal to the next AGM.\"7.        On\n\n16 February 2001, the TRC wrote to the Plaintiff and sought to expel him from his office\n\nunder the said Rule 18.1. The letter stated five charges against him and asked him to show\n\ncause by 22 February 2001 why he should not be expelled from the MC. The Plaintiff\n\nresponded in writing on 20 February 2001.8.        On 1\n\nMarch 2001, a MC meeting was held. He attended the MC meeting but left before the vote was\n\ntaken. He was informed by a letter dated 7 March 2001 that he had been expelled from his\n\noffice of Deputy General Secretary under the above-mentioned Rule 18.1. He averred that\n\nthe removal was invalid and ineffective as it was ultra vires the TRC Constitution and was\n\nalso made mala fides.9.        On\n\n25 October 2001, a notice of AGM to be held on 2 December 2001 was sent to all members of\n\nthe TRC. The Annual Report for 2000 was one of the documents attached to this notice of\n\nAGM. The said Annual Report stated that the Plaintiff had \"ceased\" to hold the\n\noffice of Deputy General Secretary on 1 March 2001 and his office was \"vacant\".\n\nThe Plaintiff received the notice and the documents attached thereto as a member of the\n\nTRC.10.        On\n\n19 November 2001, the Plaintiff wrote to the TRC stating he considered himself a duly\n\nelected Deputy General Secretary and asked the TRC to confirm that he still held that\n\noffice and remained a member of the MC and that such confirmation be made by circular to\n\nall members of the TRC prior to the AGM scheduled for 2 December 2001. The TRC refused to\n\ndo so and the Plaintiff therefore had \"to commence these proceedings to protect his\n\nname and reputation and rectify the wrongs that have been done to him, in particular, the\n\nwrongful expulsion from his duly elected office\" (paragraph 25 of the Amended\n\nStatement of Claim).11.        The\n\nPlaintiff further averred that the Annual Report for 2000 was published by the TRC and/or\n\nthe Second Defendant (the General Secretary) and that it contained defamatory statements\n\nabout him. At page 9 of the Annual Report, it was stated:\"TITLE OF OFFICE\n\n                   \n\n    NAMEDeputy General Secretary\n\n                   \n\n    Mathi Alegan (ceased wef 1.3.2001)\".At page 69 of the same, under the\n\nheading \"Management Council for the Period 2000-2002\", the following appeared:\"S/NO\n\n                                           \n\n    NAMEDy Gen Sec\n\n                                   \n\n    (vacant)\".12.        The\n\nPlaintiff averred that the words quoted above meant that he had accepted the office in\n\nquestion for a two-year term but had been removed before that for serious misconduct or\n\nthat he had irresponsibly resigned or otherwise relinquished his office before the\n\nexpiration of his term to the detriment of the interest and well-being of the TRC. The\n\nwords were also alleged to mean that he was a person who could not be relied on or trusted\n\nto act in the best interest of the TRC in particular or the Tamil community in general and\n\nthat he was incompetent, irresponsible, had the propensity to challenge the authority of\n\nthe MC without basis and was therefore unfit to be a member of the MC. He also pleaded\n\nthat the words complained of bore the said meanings by way of innuendo. The President, the\n\nDeputy President, the General Secretary and other officials of the TRC had disseminated\n\nfalse information to the members of the TRC that he was a disruptive influence and had\n\nbeen acting contrary to the best interests of the TRC. The members of the TRC would\n\ntherefore have concluded that the allegations of misconduct had been proved to be true and\n\nthat he had been removed for such misconduct in proper proceedings taken out against him.13.        By\n\nletters dated 30 November 2001 sent by courier, by AR registered post and by hand, the\n\nPlaintiff, through his solicitors, demanded that the TRC and the Second Defendant retract\n\nthe offending words immediately, apologize, undertake not to repeat the same and\n\ncompensate the Plaintiff by way of damages. The Defendants did not comply with the\n\nPlaintiff’s demands.14.        The\n\nPlaintiff therefore claimed:a.    an order quashing the\n\n    decision of the MC of 1 March 2001 removing him from office under Rule 18.1 of the\n\n    Constitution or otherwise;b.    a declaration that he was\n\n    not removed from office by the MC on 1 March 2001 and continues to hold the office;c.    damages for libel against\n\n    the TRC and/or the Second Defendant;d.    aggravated damages against\n\n    the TRC and/or the Second Defendant;e.    exemplary damages against\n\n    the TRC and/or the Second Defendant;f.    an injunction to restrain\n\n    the TRC and/or the Second Defendant, their servants or agents or howsoever otherwise, from\n\n    further publishing or causing to be published the same or similar defamatory words;g.    costs.",
        "Suit No. 800 of 2002": "15.\n\n        This action was commenced on 8 July 2002. Here,\n\nthe Plaintiff sued the TRC, the General Secretary and Stamford Press (Pte) Ltd in respect\n\nof an article appearing in the January 2002 issue of the Peravai, the official publication\n\nof the TRC. The General Secretary was the editor of that issue and Stamford Press (Pte)\n\nLtd was the printer. At page 14 of that issue, there was an article in English entitled\n\n\"TRC Legal Action\". The Tamil version appeared at page 7. The article read:\"TRC LEGAL ACTIONThe former Deputy General\n\n    Secretary, MR MATHI ALEGEN s/o Gothendaraman has taken legal action against the\n\n    Tamils’ Representative Council – a letter of demand was served two days before\n\n    the AGM.One day before the AGM, the law\n\n    firm Messrs Niru & Co. issued a Writ for wrongful expulsion of the member.The General membership decided to\n\n    request the lawyers to convince their client to withdraw the legal action in the interests\n\n    of the Tamil community – In the alternative, it was agreed that the Council would\n\n    defend the action. Mr Imran of Tan Rajah & Cheah have been appointed to act in this\n\n    matter.A high level Committee has been\n\n    formed to handle the issue.\"16.        The\n\nPlaintiff averred that the article defamed him as it meant that he was expelled from\n\nmembership of the TRC (as opposed to the MC), that he had acted and continued to act in a\n\nmanner inconsistent with the interests of the TRC and the Tamil community in Singapore,\n\nthat he was a person with a dishonest or otherwise defective character unfit for serving\n\nthe TRC and/or the Tamil community here and that he acted in bad faith by making a demand\n\nan unreasonable two days before the AGM and by commencing legal proceedings an\n\nunreasonable one day before the AGM with a view to putting unfair pressure on the TRC and\n\nthe MC with the knowledge that nothing could be done in so short a time. It also meant\n\nthat his expulsion was warranted on the facts and that the TRC had therefore decided to\n\ndefend the action. He also pleaded innuendo in that many members of the TRC and of the\n\nTamil community knew that the TRC had purported to remove him from office on 1 March 2001\n\nfor alleged misconduct and would therefore conclude, on reading the article, that his\n\nmisconduct must have been so bad and severe that it warranted his expulsion from\n\nmembership of the TRC as well.17.        The\n\nPlaintiff, in seeking aggravated damages from the Defendants for their reckless and\n\nunreasonable conduct both before and after the publication of the article, relied (among\n\nother things) on the Defendants’ denials that the article was defamatory of him and\n\ntheir attempts at justifying the article. He also pleaded that the January 2002 issue of\n\nthe Peravai was published without licence from the Ministry of Information and the Arts\n\n(\"MITA\") and that it was published recklessly and in great haste to maximize the\n\ndamage to him.18.        He\n\nclaimed aggravated damages for libel, an injunction and costs against all three\n\nDefendants.",
        "Suit No. 801 of 2002": "19.        \n\nThis action, like the one above, was commenced on 8 July 2002. Here, the Defendants are\n\nthe TRC and its Deputy President. This concerned the minutes of the AGM held on 2 December\n\n2001, circulated to all members of the TRC and which the Second Defendant as Deputy\n\nPresident published and/or caused to be published and/or facilitated the publication of.\n\nThe minutes contained the following passages which the Plaintiff said were defamatory of\n\nhim:(Paragraph 8.5)\"Dy President explained as\n\n    to why Mr Mathi was expelled. He said that Mr Mathi did not respect the chair and had\n\n    caused disruptions during meetings. He had been given an opportunity to defend his actions\n\n    and the Management Committee had voted to expel him in accordance with the constitution.\n\n    He said that legal suits should not be used as means to threaten an organisation for\n\n    trivial matters. TRC was not a single organisation. It was a representative body. The\n\n    decision to expel him was not made by any one person but rather a collective decision by\n\n    TRC and its 26 affiliate organisations.\"(Paragraph 8.18)\"Dy President said that too\n\n    much had been discussed on this issue and he does (not) want to waste money and time for\n\n    Mr Mathi’s matter.\"20.\n\n        Much the same sort of particulars was given by\n\nthe Plaintiff as to why the words defamed him. He claimed aggravated damages for libel, an\n\ninjunction and costs against both Defendants.",
        "The Interlocutory Applications": "21.\n\n        Before the trial proper commenced, I dealt with\n\nan application by the Defendants for security for costs to be furnished by the Plaintiff.\n\nThe application for security for costs was on the basis that the Plaintiff was\n\nimpecunious. Nothing was stated in the Defendants’ affidavit that would bring the\n\napplication within one of the four grounds provided in Order 23 rule 1 (1) of the Rules of\n\nCourt. For that reason, I dismissed the application with costs fixed at $700 to be paid by\n\nthe Defendants to the Plaintiff.22.\n\n        In the midst of the Plaintiff’s testimony,\n\nI dealt with another interlocutory application. This application made by the Plaintiff\n\nduring the trial was for an order that he be permitted to call S Chandra Das to testify\n\norally at the trial. S Chandra Das was a senior advisor of the TRC. The Plaintiff wanted\n\nhis objective evidence relating to the events in the TRC in 1999 and 2000 and whether he\n\nhad given certain advice to the present President of the TRC regarding the role of\n\nNirumalan Pillay (\"Niru\"), an advocate and solicitor, in the MC of the TRC. As S\n\nChandra Das’ objective evidence was sought, the Plaintiff thought it inappropriate to\n\nask him for an affidavit of his evidence in chief. His solicitors had informed S Chandra\n\nDas of their intention to call him as a witness and he indicated that if called to give\n\nevidence, he would do so. His solicitors had also informed the Defendants’ solicitors\n\nof such intention. The application could not have been taken out earlier as there were\n\nattempts made to reach a mediated settlement of the dispute and the intended witness was\n\none of the persons approached to act as mediator.23.\n\n        The Defendants objected to the Plaintiff’s\n\napplication as he should have known what his case was months earlier. In any event, the\n\nPlaintiff and a few others had written to S Chandra Das about the involvement of Niru in\n\nthe TRC and S Chandra Das’ response was in the bundles of documents prepared for the\n\ntrial.24.\n\n        I saw no good reason why there should not be an\n\naffidavit of evidence in chief by a non-partisan witness who had not indicated his\n\nreluctance to make such an affidavit. The rules pertaining to affidavits of evidence in\n\nchief were introduced to reduce trial time and to prevent \"ambushes\" or\n\nsurprises by parties at trial. Oral testimony should therefore be permitted only where\n\ngood reason is shown. There was also no good reason why the application to call the\n\nintended witness could not have been made much earlier. After all, the suggestion to\n\ninvite the intended witness to be a mediator or one of the mediators came about only when\n\nthe parties were already before the court. Accordingly, I dismissed this application and\n\nordered the Plaintiff to pay costs of $700 to the Defendants.",
        "The Plaintiff’s Case": "25.\n\n        The Plaintiff traced the history on how he came\n\nto be in the same team as the present President of the TRC, R Theyvendran. The 1998/1999\n\nMC was led by one Kesavan who was said to have managed the TRC poorly. In November 1998, a\n\nmotion of no confidence was proposed against the Kesavan MC. At the same time, a team\n\ncomprising the Plaintiff, Theyvendran, Moganaruban, some of the present MC members and\n\nNiru was formed to try and prevent mismanagement of the TRC. Niru suggested that Kesavan\n\nbe allowed to complete his term of office on condition that he agree not to stand for\n\nre-election at the next AGM. A compromise was achieved and the motion of no confidence\n\nbecame unnecessary. A committee known as the TRC 21 was formed under the chairmanship of\n\nNiru to chart the future course of the TRC.26.        \n\nHowever, Kesavan decided to stand for re-election and phantom members were created. This\n\nploy was thwarted by an order of court obtained on 11 September 1999 by the Plaintiff,\n\nTheyvendran, Moganaruban and two others. At the 1999 AGM, the Kesavan team walked out and\n\nthere was an impasse. Niru then proposed that an interim committee be set up to look after\n\nthe interests of the TRC. The committee would comprise leaders from the various Indian\n\norganizations. This proposal was accepted and Theyvendran and Moganaruban became members\n\nof this interim committee. Niru declined appointment to the committee.27.        \n\nDisputes continued from the Kesavan faction leading the advisors of the TRC to establish a\n\nnew and independent interim committee. The advisors urged Theyvendran, Niru and Kesavan\n\nnot to stand for election at the 2000 AGM but to serve in other capacities so as to allow\n\nthe hostility that had developed to dissipate.28.        \n\nHowever, only Niru heeded the advice not to stand for election. Theyvendran and\n\nMoganaruban insisted on standing for election. During the discussions leading to the two\n\nof them standing for election, Theyvendran undertook that after he was elected to office\n\nin the MC, he would focus on managing the TRC’s Co-operative as he and Moganaruban\n\nhad experience in that field. Niru would lead the TRC in the long run and this would be\n\nachieved by the MC co-opting him at a later date in accordance with the Constitution of\n\nthe TRC. The team led by Theyvendran (which included the Plaintiff) agreed with his\n\nproposed plan of action. That team went on to win the elections at the AGM held on 23 July\n\n2000 and to form the MC, with Theyvendran assuming the office of President of the TRC and\n\nMoganaruban taking on the position of Deputy President.29.        \n\nImmediately after the 2000 AGM, Theyvendran convened a MC meeting by gathering all the\n\nelected members. No prior notice was given. There was also no discussion on the proposed\n\nagenda. He began to make various decisions and to give directions. He directed the\n\nappointment of leaders of several sub-committees within the TRC when this ought to have\n\nbeen a collective decision after proper discussions among the senior MC members. He\n\nfurther directed the setting up of a committee to handle the celebrations for the\n\napproaching National Day which the Plaintiff did not think was proper as this should have\n\ncome within the purview of the Cultural Committee. From that very first MC meeting on 23\n\nJuly 2000, the Plaintiff felt that Theyvendran was not conducting himself properly as the\n\nPresident of the TRC as he had the tendency to make decisions which suited himself and\n\nwithout obtaining the views of others. However, in order not to cause any embarrassment,\n\nthe Plaintiff decided not to voice his feelings at that meeting. Instead, he confided in\n\nanother MC member, Amallathasan.30.        It\n\nsoon dawned on the Plaintiff that Theyvendran was going to run the TRC as though it\n\nbelonged to him. The President wanted only \"yes-men\" and constantly used his\n\ninfluence and financial backing to obtain their support. He was fully supported in this by\n\nhis Deputy President. The Plaintiff, a taxi driver, alleged that Theyvendran had made the\n\nwrong assumption about him – that he, coming from a humble background, would do as he\n\nwas told in the MC. However, he was not prepared under any circumstances to compromise his\n\nprinciples by doing Theyvendran’s bidding.31.        The\n\nsecond MC meeting in August 2000 was conducted in much the same domineering manner. The\n\nthird MC meeting held on 5 September 2000 was a special MC meeting conducted in the\n\npremises of Stamford Press Centre, a printing company controlled by Theyvendran. As usual,\n\nthe President would raise issues not listed in the agenda. He talked about the problems he\n\nwas having with the Board of Directors of the Co-operative and, when pressed by the\n\nPlaintiff to explain in detail the problems, declined to elaborate and simply said that\n\nthe MC should leave him to deal with the problems. He appeared agitated and was displeased\n\nwith the Plaintiff’s tenacious questioning. Further, no minutes were disclosed for\n\nthat meeting.32.        The\n\nPlaintiff felt that the President had reneged on his pre-election undertaking concerning\n\nNiru. Although he had no personal interest in getting Niru to join the MC, he felt it was\n\nnecessary to address this issue as he believed that Niru could contribute significantly to\n\nthe cause of the TRC. He therefore spoke to Amallathasan who managed to arrange an\n\ninformal meeting with Theyvendran together with the Presidents of the affiliated\n\norganizations before the second MC meeting. The Plaintiff, who attended that informal\n\nmeeting, said that Theyvendran claimed he did not do anything to facilitate Niru’s\n\nentry into the MC because certain \"top people\" were not in favour of it.\n\nTheyvendran also told those present to give him six months to do something about it.33.        \n\nSubsequent MC meetings were conducted by the President in the same dictatorial style. He\n\nwas also getting increasingly agitated by the Plaintiff’s questions about the\n\nCo-operative. At the meeting of 14 September 2000, Theyvendran announced that he had\n\ndecided to close down the Co-operative because the Board of Directors refused to do his\n\nbidding and he had no time to run it in any event. When the Plaintiff questioned him\n\nagain, he challenged the Plaintiff to take over the Co-operative. The Plaintiff accepted\n\nthe challenge.34.        At\n\nthat meeting, the Plaintiff raised again the issue concerning Niru. That agitated the\n\nPresident to the extent that he shouted at the Plaintiff and accused him of being a\n\nculprit and a troublemaker. He stated that the Plaintiff should not raise the same issue\n\nagain as he had already decided to wait for six months before dealing with it. He repeated\n\nthat \"top people\" did not like Niru. When asked by the Plaintiff to identify the\n\n\"top people\" so that he could speak to them about the issue, Theyvendran said he\n\nwas referring to Chandra Das. The Plaintiff suggested that arrangements be made for the MC\n\nto meet the senior advisor but Theyvendran refused and said that if the Plaintiff wished,\n\nhe could go and meet Chandra Das himself.35.        The\n\nPresident kept on raging during those exchanges. He even banged the table violently and\n\ndemanded the Plaintiff’s resignation. He then stormed out of that meeting.36.        The\n\nPlaintiff apologized to those remaining at the meeting for the heated outburst.\n\nMoganaruban asked him to apologize to Theyvendran as well but he insisted he owed the\n\nPresident no apology.37.        At\n\nthe next MC meeting on 5 October 2000, Theyvendran did not turn up. Moganaruban chaired\n\nthe meeting. The Niru issue was discussed once again and Moganaruban announced that\n\nTheyvendran had written to Chandra Das about it. He added that they would revisit the\n\nissue after Chandra Das responded. The Plaintiff asked for a copy of the letter written by\n\nTheyvendran but his request was turned down.38.        \n\nSometime after that meeting, the Plaintiff met with five other MC members to discuss the\n\nNiru issue. They decided to present a joint written representation to Chandra Das setting\n\nout the factual background in order to seek his guidance. They approached Niru for advice.\n\nNiru suggested that the matter be set out accurately, truthfully and fairly. On 6 November\n\n2000, the six MC members signed the letter and sent it to Chandra Das.39.        At\n\nthe next MC meeting held on 14 November 2000, Moganaruban announced that Chandra Das had\n\nreplied to Theyvendran and claimed that the reply confirmed Theyvendran’s position\n\nthat \"the top\" did not want Niru in the TRC. The Plaintiff did not accept that\n\nstatement and asked that the reply be read out. He also repeated his request that\n\nTheyvendran’s letter be produced. Both his requests were not acceded to and a lot of\n\nheated arguments followed. Moganaruban then led some MC members to approve the following\n\nmotion:\"The elected personnel of\n\n    the current MC shall continue to manage the TRC till the election of a new MC in\n\n    accordance with the constitution. No further discussion on the issue of bringing Mr\n\n    Nirumalan into the MC would be allowed. The TRC MC shall continue with its activities and\n\n    projects for the benefit of the community and all members of MC were requested to work\n\n    towards bringing TRC as an united and apex organization for Tamils.\"The Plaintiff and Amallathasan\n\nobjected to the motion.40.        It\n\nbecame absolutely clear to the Plaintiff that Theyvendran, this time through Moganaruban,\n\nharboured very deep-seated resentment against him for the queries that he had repeatedly\n\nraised. He saw the letter dated 14 November 2000 from Chandra Das subsequently and\n\nrealized that nothing in it suggested Niru’s intended role in the TRC was not\n\nfavourably received by Chandra Das or any \"top people’. That letter, addressed\n\nto Theyvendran and copied to \"Mr Amallathasan & Others\" at\n\nAmallathasan’s residential address, stated:\"Dear Theyvendran,Six members of your Committee\n\n    have asked me to state my views regarding Mr Niru Pillai and his role in TRC.When you asked me about a role\n\n    for him after the TRC elections (at the time of the TRC Multi-Purpose Co-operative\n\n    dispute) I suggested the position of legal adviser, since he did not contest the election.\n\n    You also wrote to me recently on Mr Niru Pillai and I replied to you accordingly.I cannot tell you who should be\n\n    in or not of the committee. For the record, I must state that it is for you and your\n\n    Committee to decide who should be in the TRC Council.Grateful, if you can bring this\n\n    to the attention of your Council Members.\"41.        \n\nTheyvendran also made a big issue concerning the Plaintiff’s signing of some blank\n\nreceipts for donations collected during the National Day dinner. Although the Plaintiff\n\nhad explained to the Chairperson of the National Day Dinner Committee that he had signed\n\nsome blank receipts which were eventually not used, Theyvendran unjustly accused the\n\nPlaintiff of dishonesty without allowing him to explain to the MC. He directed that an\n\ninvestigation be carried out by the said Chairperson and a report issued and did not even\n\nallow the Chairperson to explain.42.        At\n\nthe MC meeting of 30 January 2001, the Plaintiff raised the issue of the minutes of\n\nprevious meetings not being recorded and passed and this riled Theyvendran who continued\n\nhis attack on the Plaintiff regarding the blank receipts although the report confirmed\n\nthat he had not acted improperly in the matter. This again showed Theyvendran’s ill\n\nwill against the Plaintiff. When the Plaintiff asked him for an apology for having\n\ninsinuated that he had manipulated the accounts, Theyvendran refused. The President was so\n\nagitated at that meeting he could scarcely control himself. He screamed and shouted at\n\nAmallathasan and challenged him to take over the presidency which Moganaruban promptly\n\nseconded. Theyvendran then stormed out of the meeting followed by Moganaruban.43.        \n\nPursuant to a notice issued on 7 February 2001, a MC meeting was held on 15 February 2001.\n\nTheyvendran did not attend this meeting and it was therefore chaired by the Deputy\n\nPresident, Moganaruban. From the start of the meeting, it was clear that the Deputy\n\nPresident had no intention of keeping to the stated agenda. As usual, no minutes of the\n\nprevious MC meeting were presented for discussion although this was a strict requirement\n\nfor MC meetings. Moganaruban glossed over this by saying that they intended to discuss\n\nother matters. He launched into a speech on how the Plaintiff was unable to see eye to eye\n\nwith the President and this was the prelude to the manipulative act to expel the Plaintiff\n\nfrom the MC. Moganaruban then demanded that the Plaintiff resign from the MC since the\n\nlatter was not able to work with the President. The Plaintiff was surprised and outraged\n\nby this and he made it clear to all present that he had done no wrong and had no intention\n\nof resigning. Besides, the question of his resignation was not included in the agenda in\n\nthe first place.44.        \n\nUpon his refusal, Moganaruban then purported to prefer charges of misconduct against the\n\nPlaintiff. As this was also not in the agenda, it again took the Plaintiff completely by\n\nsurprise. No formal notice of any charges had been given and he was not told the relevant\n\nprovision of the constitution under which he was being dealt with. To him, \"it was an\n\nambush, all planned and calculated to achieve maximum effect\". He realized that\n\nMoganaruban and those allied to Theyvendran had planned to use that meeting to stage a\n\nscene leading to his expulsion. He felt it was a shameful and dishonest attempt engineered\n\nby the President to expel him.45.        \n\nDespite the Plaintiff’s objections, Moganaruban put the motion to a vote but could\n\nnot secure a two-thirds majority anyway. The motion therefore failed.46.        The\n\nnext day, 16 February 2001, the TRC issued a letter to the Plaintiff setting out the\n\nfollowing:\"Dear Sir,MISCONDUCT AT MANAGEMENT\n\n    COUNCIL MEETINGIt is noted that at the\n\n    Management Council Meeting held on 15 Feb 2001, the Chairperson, Mr Mohana Ruben preferred\n\n    charges against you and proposed that you be expelled from the Council.The charges preferred against you\n\n    are as follows:1    that you have not shown\n\n    proper respect for the Chairman at MC meetings.2    That you kept deliberately\n\n    speaking on a subject despite repeated reminders by Council members to proceed with the\n\n    matter on the agenda.3    That you have refused to\n\n    accept the decision of the President, which was based on the majority views of the members\n\n    present4    That you have stated that the\n\n    President was lying.5    And your conduct has resulted\n\n    in disruptive meetings and the abrupt ending of more then one MC meetings.In accordance with TRC\n\n    Constitution (18.1), you are hereby given notice to show cause by 22 Feb 2001 as to why\n\n    you should not be expelled from the TRC Management Council for your behavior. It is the\n\n    considered opinion of the Council members that your action was prejudicial and contrary to\n\n    the interest of the Council.(signed)Pandiyan VellasamiGeneral Secretary(On behalf of the TRC MC)cc Mr R Theyvendran\n\n            President, TRCMr Mohana Ruben         Dy President, TRC\".47.        The\n\nPlaintiff was overcome by profound sadness when he read the above letter as it showed that\n\nthere was a vendetta against him and that compliance with the TRC constitution did not\n\nmatter. It seemed to him that it did not matter to those seeking his removal that they had\n\nfailed to do so on the same complaints at the 15 February 2001 MC meeting. The last\n\nsentence of the above letter also indicated that the MC had pre-judged the matter.48.        On\n\n20 February 2001, the Plaintiff personally delivered his two-page response to the General\n\nSecretary of the TRC. In his letter, he set out what had happened at the 15 February 2001\n\nMC meeting. He asked the Deputy President then what wrong he had done that warranted the\n\ndemand for his resignation and the reply was that at some previous meeting, the Plaintiff\n\nhad banged the table. When the Plaintiff asked if there was anything else, he was told he\n\nshould know for himself. The Plaintiff replied then that it was the President who had\n\nfirst banged the table at the meeting in question and then walked out of the meeting\n\nstating that the Plaintiff must resign or he (the President) would. However, the President\n\nwent on to chair the next MC meeting and there was no longer any issue about the banging\n\nof the table or of anyone resigning. The allegation about table-banging was thus\n\n\"never a live issue on 15.2.2001\". In his letter, the Plaintiff reiterated that\n\nthe matter had been put to a vote and the motion was defeated. He also stated that no\n\ndecision was taken by the MC that any action on his part was prejudicial and contrary to\n\nthe interest of the MC and ended by saying, \"As such, your notice dated 16.2.2001 to\n\nme to show cause is invalid and without any basis. I refute all the allegations made\n\nagainst me. I also reserve all my rights as an elected officer of the Management\n\nCouncil\". There was no reply to the Plaintiff’s letter.49.        \n\nHowever, in the meantime, a letter dated 19 February 2001 giving notice of a special MC\n\nmeeting scheduled to be held on 1 March 2001 was sent out. It was stated in that letter\n\nthat \"this meeting is called to discuss the issues brought against the council\n\nmember, Mr G Mathialagan by the Dy President, Mr Moganaruban at the meeting held on 15 Feb\n\n2001.\" It also emphasized to all MC members that \"your attendance is utmost\n\nimportant\". The Plaintiff was shocked by this \"unholy haste\" to remove him\n\nas the MC had not even received his response yet.50.        The\n\nfailure to disclose minutes of MC meetings continued to cause the Plaintiff concern and on\n\n20 February 2001, he and seven other MC members wrote to the General Secretary to enquire\n\nwhy the minutes for 30 January 2001 were not distributed in spite of a specific request\n\nfor such at the 15 February 2001 meeting. They requested that all minutes that had not\n\nbeen distributed, including those for 30 January 2001 and for 15 February 2001, be sent to\n\nall MC members immediately. The General Secretary replied to the eight of them on 23\n\nFebruary 2001 stating that the President, the Deputy President and he decided not to\n\ndistribute the minutes for 30 January 2001 as the meeting on 15 February 2001 was intended\n\nto address only the first item on the agenda, that is, \"To discuss the abrupt ending\n\nof the last MC meeting held on 30 January 2001 (to be chaired by Mr Moganaruban)\". He\n\nreminded them that the Deputy President had explained all this at the commencement of the\n\n15 February 2001 meeting and that his proposal to discuss only the said item was accepted\n\nby everyone present. He also stated that minutes of all previous meetings had been\n\ndistributed and accepted at subsequent meetings and that copies could be obtained at the\n\nTRC office (in Peace Centre, Sophia Road).51.        On\n\n1 March 2001, for the first time, all the representatives of the TRC affiliates attended\n\nthe special MC meeting. The Plaintiff had no doubt that this was arranged by Moganaruban\n\nto secure the necessary votes. One Jalaludin, an unauthorized person, was even introduced\n\nas an observer by Moganaruban.52.        \n\nJust before the meeting began, the Plaintiff was handed a copy of the letter containing\n\nthe charges preferred against him. Although it appeared to be a copy of the show cause\n\nletter of 16 February 2001, it was dated 1 March 2001. The Plaintiff pointed this out to\n\nthe General Secretary who, after exchanging glances with the Deputy President seated next\n\nto him, muttered that it was a mistake and used a pen to change the date to 16 February\n\n2001 and then returned the amended copy to the Plaintiff. The 1 March 2001 letter also had\n\nonly four charges instead of five, omitting the charge \"That you have stated that the\n\nPresident was lying\" listed as the fourth charge in the 16 February 2001 show cause\n\nletter.53.        \n\nStanding Orders were issued for the 1 March 2001 MC meeting giving the President extensive\n\npower as to the conduct of MC meetings. Members were allowed only three minutes to speak\n\non any subject. Moganaruban proposed the adoption of these Standing Orders but added that\n\nthey did not apply to the President or the Deputy President.54.        The\n\nminutes for the 15 February 2001 MC meeting were again not produced at this meeting. The\n\nPlaintiff and some MC members raised this issue but Moganaruban refused to circulate the\n\nminutes. Instead, he instructed the General Secretary to read out the minutes.55.        The\n\nDeputy President then began to speak at great length for Theyvendran, saying he was a good\n\nPresident who was unable to conduct meetings because of the Plaintiff’s rude and\n\ndisruptive behaviour. He then referred to the show cause letter (of 1 March 2002), stating\n\nthat it had been sent to the Plaintiff and asking the Plaintiff what he had to say in\n\nresponse to the charges.56.        The\n\nPlaintiff began by asking what wrong he had done and whether he had acted against the TRC\n\nconstitution. He pointed out that he had banged the table only after the President had\n\ndone so and that the meeting was an illegal one as minutes of previous meetings had not\n\nbeen produced, particularly when the charges against him related to what he had done\n\nduring those previous meetings. He also contended that the three-minute rule in the\n\nStanding Orders was unfair as it was clearly insufficient for him to respond to all the\n\ncharges and that it should also apply to the President in any event. He pointed out that\n\nhis letter of 20 February 2001 in response to the show cause letter of 16 February 2001\n\nwas not produced at that meeting for the benefit of all members, particularly those who\n\nwere not present at the previous meetings.57.        \n\nWhile he was making his defence, Moganaruban interrupted rudely and demanded that he stop,\n\nclaiming that he had already spoken for more than three minutes. The Plaintiff protested\n\nas that was untrue. Moganaruban responded by threatening to dismiss him from the meeting.\n\nAt that juncture, other members such as Amallathasan spoke and protested at the unfair\n\nmanner in which the MC meeting was being conducted. However, Moganaruban said he was not\n\ninterested in hearing them and the Chairman could do whatever he wanted and could speak\n\nfor as long as he wished. He then demanded that those who were standing or speaking sit\n\ndown or be expelled from the meeting, repeating the Standing Orders. The Plaintiff and\n\nseveral other members then said that the way the meeting was being conducted was illegal\n\nand unjust and he left the meeting, followed by several others.58.        The\n\nPlaintiff subsequently received a letter dated 7 March 2001 from the TRC informing him he\n\nhad been expelled for misconduct under the said rule 18.1 of the constitution. He felt\n\nvery aggrieved but was convinced that he could get no justice for so long as Theyvendran\n\nand his \"lackeys\" were running the MC. There was therefore no point in going\n\nback to the TRC to settle the dispute although his removal was wrongful and illegal. He\n\nsought advice from Niru and was told by the lawyer it was not for him (Niru) to interfere\n\nand that the Plaintiff should let matters rest as the continuing disputes would not\n\nproject a good image of the TRC. The Plaintiff accepted the \"good advice\".59.        \n\nHowever, months later, when the Plaintiff received the notice of AGM to be held on 2\n\nDecember 2001, he noticed that his office was described as \"vacant\" and that he\n\nhad \"ceased\" to hold that office. It was to him a malicious misrepresentation.\n\nThat led to his letter of 19 November 2001 to the General Secretary where he repeated\n\nessentially the events in February and March 2001 set out above. He protested that he had\n\nbeen \"denied the very basic rights of natural justice in at least two respects\"\n\nin that he was subjected to the same charges more than once and by the same accusers and\n\nthat he was not accorded a fair opportunity to be heard. He pointed out for the first time\n\nthat rule 18.1 of the constitution was for the purpose of expelling a person from\n\nmembership of the TRC and not for expelling a MC member from office. He alleged that he\n\nhad been a victim of a vendetta launched against him, in particular by the President and\n\nthe Deputy President. He concluded his letter by demanding:\"That you confirm to me in\n\n    writing that I am still the Hon. Deputy General Secretary and that I remain a Management\n\n    Council member.That this confirmation is made by\n\n    way of an official circular and sent to all members prior to the forthcoming AGM on\n\n    2.12.01.Please respond to my requests in\n\n    writing by 27.11.01.\"60.        The\n\nPlaintiff alleged that the failure of the President and the Deputy President to produce\n\nminutes at MC meetings assumed a more sinister significance when, after discovery of\n\ndocuments had taken place in these proceedings, he found that the minutes for the meetings\n\nheld on 5 October 2000 and on 30 January 2001 had been amended and \"the discrepancies\n\nare manifest\". He was shocked to learn that the MC could have descended to\n\nfabrication of minutes of meetings. Even the letter purportedly setting out the charges\n\nagainst him was fabricated as the show cause letter of 16 February 2001 had different\n\ncontents from the one originally dated 1 March 2001.61.        The\n\nPlaintiff then set out his case in defamation in respect of the Annual Report for 2000\n\nalong the same lines as his pleadings (summarized earlier in this judgment). Where his\n\ncase in defamation in relation to the Peravai publication was concerned, he said that his\n\nsolicitors made a search for the MITA number of Peravai in order to ascertain the details\n\nas to its publishers, editor, licensee and other particulars. The inquiries revealed that\n\nthe TRC was not on record as being the publisher of any publication. His solicitors then\n\nwrote to MITA to confirm the position and were told that the publishing permit granted to\n\nthe TRC expired on 23 October 2001. The Plaintiff then wrote to the Minister in charge of\n\nMITA to complain that no action was being taken against the unlicensed publication which\n\ncould continue to defame him in subsequent issues. Sometime in May 2002, his solicitors\n\nreceived the papers relating to the TRC’s application for a renewal of the licence.\n\nMITA also replied to say that a warning was issued to the TRC. The Defendants’\n\nsolicitors’ subsequent response to the Plaintiff’s solicitors on this issue was\n\nthat it was an administrative oversight that the permit for the Peravai was not renewed\n\nand that there was nothing sinister in it. In his evidence, the Plaintiff maintained that\n\nthe fact the January 2002 issue of Peravai was an illegal publication constituted malice\n\nby the Defendants against him. Further, instead of setting out the full version, including\n\nhis contentions in respect of his removal, the Peravai stated categorically that he was\n\nremoved as a member.62.        In\n\nreply to the Plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter of demand in June 2002 in respect of\n\nthe alleged defamation in the January 2002 issue of the Peravai, the Defendants’\n\nsolicitors stated that they did not agree that the article defamed the Plaintiff. They\n\nwent on to say:\"The article is clear as to\n\n    the fact that the former Deputy General Secretary had issued a writ for his wrongful\n\n    expulsion as Deputy General Secretary. This is a fact. It is also a fact that Mr Mathi\n\n    Alegen had been removed from his position as Deputy General Secretary and this was within\n\n    the knowledge of the members. Your client’s pleadings in Suit No. 1519/2001/Q confirm\n\n    this as do the discussions at preceding Annual General Meeting.If your client has any\n\n    reservation in this respect, our clients will clarify the matter at the upcoming AGM as\n\n    well as the next issue of \"Peravai.\".63.\n\n        The Plaintiff’s solicitors responded by\n\nsaying that the Defendants’ attempt to justify the article would be relied on in a\n\nclaim for aggravated damages and that the Plaintiff \"for his part needs no\n\nclarification\".64.\n\n        Where the Plaintiff’s third action was\n\nconcerned, he alleged that the minutes of the AGM held on 2 December 2001 were published\n\nby the TRC and that Moganaruban, the Second Defendant in this action, uttered the words in\n\nissue and to that extent, published the words or facilitated their publication. As a\n\nresult of the statement made by Moganaruban and put in writing in the formal minutes of\n\nmeeting, the Plaintiff said he suffered severe anguish and was the subject of constant\n\nridicule in the Tamil community. He further alleged that the statement was calculated to\n\ndisparage him and was actuated by malice as shown in the events after the AGM in July 2000\n\nto the special MC meeting of 1 March 2001.65.\n\n        R Kumaran, a life member of the TRC testified\n\nthat he was not an active member but attended AGMs regularly. At the request of the\n\nPlaintiff, he attended and tape recorded the proceedings at the AGM on 2 December 2001\n\nheld at the Ceylon Sports Club. The proceedings were conducted in both English and Tamil.\n\nOn 15 December 2001, he went to the office of Niru & Co. to make a tape-to-tape\n\nrecording of the original tape. On 17 January 2002, he transcribed the recording wherever\n\nEnglish was used. The Plaintiff did the transcript of those portions where Tamil was used.66.\n\n        Kumaran added that the issue of the\n\nPlaintiff’s removal from office was discussed at the AGM 2001. The MC announced that\n\nthe Plaintiff had instituted legal proceedings. A member, Kalaiselvan, said that the\n\nreason people resorted to court action was because they were not satisfied.67.\n\n        Kumaran also attended the AGM for 2002 held on\n\n9 June 2002. He also tape recorded the proceedings at the request of the Plaintiff. On 10\n\nJune 2002, he went to the office of Niru & Co. to make a tape-to-tape recording of the\n\noriginal tape and on 12 June 2002, he transcribed the relevant English portion of the\n\nproceedings.68.\n\n        Kumaran accepted that he had done the taping\n\nwith a portable recorder without the knowledge and consent of the MC. There were portions\n\nof the proceedings omitted when he had to leave the meeting room to change to a new tape.\n\nThere were also inaudible segments in the recording.69.\n\n        Amallathasan, a retiree, is the President of\n\nthe Association of Singapore Tamil Writers, an affiliated organization of the TRC. He was\n\nelected as one of the Vice Presidents of the TRC at the AGM 2000. He testified that he got\n\nto know the Plaintiff in 1995 and learnt that the Plaintiff, like himself, was a person\n\nwith great passion for the Tamil language. He also stated that the Plaintiff was \"a\n\nstraightforward and forthright character with a big heart and passion for Tamil culture\n\nand language\".70.\n\n        Amallathasan then related the history leading\n\nto the ouster of Kesavan and his team from the MC. Niru was the leader of the team of five\n\nmembers who approached Kesavan to strike the deal regarding the motion of no confidence in\n\nKesavan’s team. Niru also led the TRC 21 Committee which comprised various leaders of\n\nTamil organizations. Amallathasan was appointed a member of this committee. The TRC 21\n\nCommittee prepared the report called The New Directions. During this time, Niru introduced\n\nTheyvendran and Moganaruban to the team.71.\n\n        When Kesavan reneged on the compromise, the\n\nleaders of the Tamil organizations together with Niru and Theyvendran worked hard on their\n\nplans to take over control of the MC. It was agreed after discussions that Theyvendran,\n\nNiru and some other leaders would contest the elections. During these discussions,\n\nTheyvendran expressed very clearly his interest in managing the TRC Co-operative and said\n\nthat he wanted to focus his attention on the Co-operative together with Moganaruban.\n\nHowever, Niru suggested that Theyvendran lead the team as President by virtue of his\n\nseniority while he (Niru) could take on the office of General Secretary. Amallathasan did\n\nnot find this suggestion acceptable as Theyvendran and Moganaruban were not well known and\n\nlacked the necessary influence to lead the TRC. Theyvendran gave them the assurance that\n\nhe was not interested in leading the MC and gave them the undertaking that if he was\n\nelected President, he would concentrate solely on the Co-operative, leaving the leadership\n\nof the MC to Niru. As a result, everyone in the team agreed on the line-up for the\n\nelections.72.\n\n        Amallathasan, together with Theyvendran,\n\nMoganaruban, the Plaintiff and another, had to commence legal action against\n\nKesavan’s team concerning the issue of the list of eligible voters. They relied on\n\nNiru’s and Niru’s partner’s (Liew Teck Huat) advice. At the AGM held in\n\nSeptember 1999, they received a lot of support from the members of the TRC and\n\nKesavan’s team, facing imminent defeat, walked out of the AGM. Niru then proposed the\n\nsetting up of an interim committee to complete the unfinished business. Amallathasan,\n\nTheyvendran and Moganaruban were among the 17 persons appointed to this interim committee\n\nwhich took advice from Niru on various matters because of his experience and ability to\n\ndeal properly with all members concerned. Niru also liaised with Chandra Das on behalf of\n\nthe interim committee. The post-elections arrangements concerning Theyvendran and Niru\n\nwere re-affirmed.73.\n\n        Due to the deadlock created by Kesavan’s\n\nteam, the advisors led by Chandra Das decided to set up a fresh interim committee in\n\nJanuary 2000 comprising neutral members.74.\n\n        They continued with their preparations for the\n\nAGM 2000 with the following modifications to their plan – Niru and Aandeappan,\n\nanother veteran member, decided not to contest the elections. There was otherwise no\n\nchange to the original plan. At the AGM 2000, they were voted into the MC.75.\n\n        Very soon after the July 2000 elections,\n\nAmallathasan realized that Theyvendran was high-handed, arrogant and dictatorial as shown\n\nby his convening of the MC meeting immediately after the AGM and his unilateral\n\nappointment of the National Day Committee. Amallathasan then decided to have a word with\n\nTheyvendran. He gave him a call to fix an appointment to talk things over but Theyvendran\n\nwas rather curt, asking whether he wanted to discuss the Niru issue and how many members\n\nwere attending the discussions. Amallathasan then got in touch with all the Vice\n\nPresidents and the representatives of the affiliates to arrange a meeting with Theyvendran\n\nwith the object of discussing the proper running of TRC and the issue concerning Niru\n\njoining the MC. The Plaintiff was among the group.76.\n\n        Theyvendran’s response on the Niru issue\n\nwas that \"top people\" did not like Niru. He told them that they should leave the\n\nmatter to him as he was confident of resolving the issue in 6 months. Amallathasan was not\n\nsatisfied with this answer and asked who the \"top people\" were. Theyvendran was\n\nvery unhappy with this and was not inclined to discuss the matter further. He left the\n\nmeeting midway, leaving Moganaruban to continue with the meeting. Moganaruban reiterated\n\nthat the issue should be resolved in six months’ time and that if it was not, he was\n\nwilling to resign to make way for Niru to be made Deputy President.77.\n\n        At the MC meetings that followed, Amallathasan\n\nand the Plaintiff had repeated and heated arguments with Theyvendran over the Co-operative\n\nand the Niru issues with the Plaintiff being very vocal. They felt that Niru could\n\nexercise influence and had the necessary contacts and should therefore be brought into the\n\nMC to provide leadership according to the understanding they all had before the elections.\n\nTheyvendran was very agitated over the questions and was particularly agitated by the\n\nPlaintiff who was very vocal on those two issues. There were also heated exchanges between\n\nAmallathasan and the President over the latter’s alleged dictatorial style of\n\nleadership. At one meeting, Amallathasan mentioned that the President was always a\n\ndifficult person to discuss things with and the latter responded by standing up, proposing\n\nthat he take over the job and then leaving the meeting in a huff with Moganaruban.78.\n\n        The rest of his evidence related to the\n\ncorrespondence with Chandra Das, the issue about the minutes of meetings and the events\n\nleading to the fateful day of 1 March 2001. He alleged that the Plaintiff spoke for about\n\ntwo minutes only before he was told he had exceeded the time limit in the Standing Orders.\n\nWhen he asked for the minutes of the previous meeting, Moganaruban would only allow the\n\nminutes to be read out even though he was holding a copy thereof. When Amallathasan and\n\nseveral other MC members asked that the minutes be circulated, Moganaruban proposed that\n\nthe question whether they should be circulated be put to a vote. Feeling this was \"an\n\nultimate disgrace\", Amallathasan walked out of the meeting, followed by the Plaintiff\n\nand a few others. In spite of the verbal clashes he had with the President, Amallathasan\n\ndid not face disciplinary action by the MC.79.\n\n        Niru, an advocate and solicitor since 1978,\n\ntestified that he was actively involved in Indian organizations for more than two decades.\n\nHe was and remains very passionate about promoting Tamil interests in Singapore,\n\nparticularly in language, culture and education. He is a life member of the TRC and was\n\nconsulted regularly by the leaders of the affiliated organizations. He also worked very\n\nclosely with Chandra Das in his parliamentary constituency for more than ten years while\n\nthe latter was a Member of Parliament. He became acquainted with the Plaintiff while\n\norganizing the 1995 Tamil Language Week. From the first time Niru met him, he found the\n\nPlaintiff \"a forthright, down to earth and honest to goodness character\"\n\nalthough the Plaintiff came from a humble background.80.\n\n        Niru also testified about the tumultuous recent\n\nhistory of the TRC, stating that the present General Secretary, Pandiyan, had been\n\nsecretary to Kesavan as well and that by 1998, there were several complaints against\n\nPandiyan who \"had worked in concert with Kesavan\". The interim committee in 1999\n\nrelied on Niru to seek guidance and advice from Chandra Das, a senior advisor of the TRC.\n\nTheyvendran was also particularly keen to participate in the discussions with the senior\n\nadvisor. He even relied on Niru to vet all his letters to Chandra Das. Niru met Chandra\n\nDas on many occasions to try to resolve the problems in the TRC. On 31 January 2000,\n\nChandra Das wrote to Niru and Theyvendran to state that the advisors had decided to set up\n\na fresh interim committee for the TRC comprising respectable persons who had not been\n\ninvolved in the ongoing dispute and that it would take over the management of the TRC with\n\neffect from 1 February 2000.81.\n\n        Chandra Das suggested that Kesavan, Theyvendran\n\nand Niru should not stand for election in order to avoid a factional dispute. Niru agreed\n\nand accepted his advice. Niru assisted the new interim committee to find a solution to the\n\nproblems but did not participate actively in the TRC while Theyvendran continued to take\n\nan aggressive position against Kesavan.82.\n\n        The interim committee reported later that fresh\n\nelections should be held. It reconvened the AGM. During this time, Niru was in London for\n\na long period of time. Theyvendran contacted him and asked if they were going to stick to\n\ntheir plan to re-contest the elections. Niru replied that he would abide by the advice of\n\nChandra Das and advised Theyvendran to do the same. However, Theyvendran said he had been\n\ngiven the go-ahead.83.\n\n        When Niru returned to Singapore on 8 July 2000,\n\nhe found out from Chandra Das that neither Theyvendran nor Kesavan had been advised by him\n\nthat they could re-contest the elections. In his letter to Chandra Das dated 21 July 2000,\n\nNiru mentioned that \"It appears that I am the only one (of the three persons) who is\n\nabiding by your advice that we should not stand for office at the forthcoming TRC\n\nelections\".84.\n\n        At the 23 July 2000 AGM, Theyvendran was\n\nelected President. Moganaruban, a relatively unknown candidate, was nominated and\n\nsupported for the post of Deputy President because of Theyvendran’s request.\n\nConsistent with the agreement reached earlier, Niru thought Theyvendran would ask him to\n\nserve in the MC and play a leadership role as previously envisaged. He was keen that the\n\ngoals and aspirations spelt out in the \"New Directions\" report of the TRC 21\n\nCommittee be implemented. That report was in fact the manifesto of Theyvendran’s team\n\nat the 1999 elections. Until he was co-opted, Niru did not see it appropriate to exercise\n\nany further influence in the MC. He felt that the MC should be given time to settle down.85.\n\n        It soon dawned on Niru from feedback received\n\nfrom some of the members of the MC that Theyvendran was in fact intent upon preventing him\n\nfrom joining the MC or being given any leadership role. Further, instead of concentrating\n\non the Co-operative, he began to run the MC in an autocratic way and was supported\n\nstaunchly in this by Moganaruban. When consulted by some of the leaders, Niru advised them\n\nto deal with matters amicably so as not to disrupt the TRC. Those MC members were however\n\nunable to get Theyvendran committed to what he had promised. There were repeated disputes\n\nand this caused Niru a lot of concern, especially when one of the issues was about him\n\njoining the MC. When some of the MC members sought his advice about approaching Chandra\n\nDas to resolve the issue about him joining the MC, he felt that it would be inappropriate\n\nfor him to do so as he was not part of the MC. He suggested instead that they ascertain\n\nfrom Chandra Das his position since \"Theyvendran had used his name in vain\". He\n\nfelt that the MC members should be guided by Chandra Das’ advice.86.\n\n        Niru concluded by saying that Theyvendran had\n\nnot observed the spirit of the \"New Directions\", had reneged on his pre-election\n\nagreement made in 1999 and had begun to run the TRC with a heavy hand. He felt exceedingly\n\ndisappointed by the turn of events as both he and Theyvendran could have worked together\n\nand made substantial contribution to the TRC.87.\n\n        Niru acknowledged that he helped the Plaintiff\n\nfund the costs of the present proceedings by giving him a loan of $50,000 for the court\n\nfees. He said he had helped others in the same way before. Where the conduct of the case\n\nwas concerned, he left everything in the hands of his partner in the law firm, Mr Liew\n\nTeck Huat.88.\n\n        Naa Aandeappan, a life member of the TRC and\n\nthe Deputy Head of Tamil News in Mediacorp News Pte Ltd, said he had been involved in\n\nTamil community work for several years. He too gave the recent history of the TRC, how the\n\npresent team got together and the pre-election understanding concerning the roles of\n\nTheyvendran and Niru in the MC should the team be elected to office. He also testified\n\nabout the tumultuous events in 1999 when the interim committee had to be formed after the\n\nKesavan faction walked out of the AGM. He, together with Amallathasan, Theyvendran and\n\nMoganaruban, was appointed to be a member in the 17-member interim committee. Niru\n\ndeclined to be a member of the interim committee as he was not holding any office in the\n\nIndian organizations at that time. However, they consulted Niru regularly on various\n\nmatters. On behalf of the interim committee, Niru held discussions with Chandra Das to\n\nfind a way forward for the TRC.89.\n\n        The interim committee held meetings to deal\n\nwith the various issues and Niru was invited as a guest at some of these meetings to give\n\nhis views and guidance. At these meetings, the previous arrangement that Theyvendran was\n\nonly interested in managing the Co-operative was affirmed.90.\n\n        After the new interim committee was set up by\n\nthe advisors of the TRC, the team continued to prepare for the 2000 AGM but Niru and\n\nAandeappan decided not to contest the elections. Other than that, there was no change in\n\nthe original plan.91.\n\n        After Theyvendran was elected President, he\n\nreneged on the agreement and completely sidestepped the issue of Niru joining the MC. He\n\nalso refused to endorse the plans painstakingly conceived and put in place in the report\n\n\"New Directions\" which was printed by Theyvendran’s printing company and\n\ndistributed to the members of the TRC by the Plaintiff and others. Even when they were in\n\nthe interim committee, Theyvendran, the Chairman of the interim committee, would ask\n\nAandeappan, who prepared the minutes of the meetings, to send the minutes to him first\n\nbefore they were sent to Jayakodi, who chaired the meetings, claiming that he wanted to\n\nensure accuracy in the minutes. As an illustration, Aandeappan referred to the meeting\n\nheld on 31 October 1999. There, the discussions were somewhat controversial because they\n\ninvolved rather sharp personal exchanges between two members. Aandeappan omitted those\n\nexchanges in the minutes as they had no relevance to the TRC. However, Theyvendran made\n\nsubstantial amendments to the minutes and wanted the exchanges recorded. After making the\n\namendments, he would ask Aandeappan to send the minutes to Moganaruban as well and the\n\nlatter would then revert with his comments. Aandeappan was left in a dilemma. He knew it\n\nwas improper for any committee member to dictate to him on how to prepare the minutes.\n\nHowever, because of Theyvendran’s insistence, he did not refuse him.92.\n\n        When Niru declined to stand for elections at\n\nthe 2000 AGM, Aandeappan was invited to stand for the office of General Secretary.\n\nHowever, he declined as he could not accept the way Theyvendran and Moganaruban treated\n\nhim while they were members of the interim committee, in particular, their insistence on\n\nvetting the minutes and dictating the contents. Further, he saw from the autocratic way in\n\nwhich they conducted meetings of the interim committee what was looming ahead and he\n\nwanted no part of it.",
        "The Defendants’ Case": "93.\n\n        Theyvendran, a businessman, explained that as\n\nthe months leading to the 23 July 2000 elections had been very turbulent ones, he was\n\nanxious that the TRC move forward. There was much to be done and he held the first MC\n\nmeeting the same day after the elections.94.\n\n        However, during the subsequent MC meetings, the\n\nPlaintiff \"behaved in an extremely rude, boisterous, disrespectful and disruptive\n\nmanner\". He would be \"arrogant and disrespectful\" to the chairperson and\n\nwould insist on his views being adopted. Meetings which could have concluded within an\n\nhour would go past ten o’clock while the Plaintiff made \"long meandering\n\nspeeches\". He would repeatedly raised the issue of bringing Niru into the MC as a key\n\noffice bearer, particularly as Deputy President in place of Moganaruban, the duly elected\n\nholder of that office. The Plaintiff ignored the decisions of the MC that this issue\n\nshould not be discussed further. He cast aspersions and challenged the credibility of the\n\nchairperson, hampering the progress of MC meetings, some of which ended abruptly, and\n\naffecting the morale of many MC members.95.\n\n        At the MC meeting on 14 September 2000, which\n\nwas a special meeting held essentially to discuss the National Day Dinner that had been\n\norganized, the Plaintiff and several others insisted that Niru be brought into the MC\n\ninspite of the President and others telling them that was not possible and the President\n\ntelling the Plaintiff that, given the past problems of the TRC, Chandra Das had advised\n\nthat Niru be considered for the position of legal advisor. In order to permit the meeting\n\nto carry on, it was agreed that the issue of the appointment of Niru be deferred for six\n\nmonths. The Plaintiff eventually agreed to a deferment of four months. The meeting then\n\nconsidered other matters. Towards the end of the meeting, the Plaintiff again raised the\n\nsame issue and insisted that a decision be made. He did not accept what the President had\n\nsaid was the advice of the TRC’s advisor and basically held the President out to be a\n\ndishonest person. In a rude and loud manner, he insisted that Chandra Das be contacted to\n\nfind out his views. Almost the entire MC was against this course of action. The Plaintiff\n\nwas shouting most of the time. He banged the table aggressively and pointed his finger at\n\nthe President in a menacing manner. As a result of his behaviour, the President told him\n\nhe should resign. The President then left the meeting and the Deputy President took over\n\nthe chair.96.\n\n        A notice of the next MC meeting scheduled for\n\n28 September 2000 was sent out on 22 September 2000. However, most of the MC members were\n\nfed up and did not wish to attend the meeting and it became obvious that the requisite\n\nquorum would not be achieved. That meeting was cancelled. The members were persuaded to\n\nturn up for the next meeting to be held on 5 October 2000. The President was overseas on\n\nthat date but felt that the meeting should go on.97.\n\n        On 3 October 2000, the President wrote to\n\nChandra Das to inform him that some MC members wanted Niru to be involved in the MC\n\ninspite of his advice that Niru be appointed legal advisor. He recalled meeting Chandra\n\nDas at Chennai before the 2000 AGM and the advisor informing him that the new thinking was\n\nthat anyone was free to contest the elections. He also recalled how he and others then\n\ntried in vain to contact Niru on the people who should be the officials and that neither\n\nhe nor Niru wanted to become the President of the TRC. Eventually, as Niru could not be\n\nreached and no one else was interested in assuming the presidency, everyone unanimously\n\ndecided that Theyvendran should stand for election to that office. Theyvendran went to say\n\nin his letter that there was never any intention to let down Niru and that he could still\n\nhave the presidency. He recalled that after Niru’s name was raised at one MC meeting,\n\nChandra Das advised that Niru should be the legal advisor. Theyvendran also stated that he\n\noffered his resignation as President \"to graciously hand over so that the interest of\n\nthe Indian community is preserved\" and that he had requested the MC to decide whether\n\nNiru or any other person could take over from him immediately or at the next AGM. He then\n\nasked Chandra Das to confirm his earlier advice that Niru was best suited to be legal\n\nadvisor so that the matter could be resolved.98.\n\n        At the 5 October 2000 meeting, the Niru issue\n\nwas discussed again. After discussions, the following resolution, accepted by everyone\n\npresent including the Plaintiff, was passed:\"The officially elected\n\n    Management Committee shall continue to remain in power for the entire term of office. Any\n\n    change in the MC shall take place in accordance with the Constitution of the TRC\".99.\n\n        On 9 October 2000, Chandra Das replied to\n\nTheyvendran, saying:\"You have been elected at\n\n    the AGM as President and as such you have a responsibility to carry out your duties until\n\n    the next AGM. However, if you wish to resign for whatever reason, it is your decision.As for Niru he is not an elected\n\n    member of the committee. My earlier advice of using him as legal adviser still\n\n    stands.\"100.\n\n        On 14 November 2000, Theyvendran received\n\nanother letter from Chandra Das, the text of which has already been set out at paragraph\n\n40 above. Theyvendran was not aware that six MC members had written to the advisor of the\n\nTRC. At the MC meeting held that same day, the letters from Chandra Das were distributed\n\nto the members. As Theyvendran’s integrity had been made an issue in this matter, he\n\nleft the meeting when this matter was to be discussed. He was told that the Plaintiff held\n\nthe view nevertheless that the letter established that the MC had the power to bring Niru\n\ninto the MC and was again extremely disruptive. Eventually the resolution spelt out at\n\nparagraph 39 above was passed by the MC with only the Plaintiff and Amallathasan\n\nregistering their objections.101.\n\n        At the MC meeting held on 30 January 2001, the\n\nPlaintiff again raised the Niru issue and wanted the resolution of 14 November 2000\n\nremoved from the minutes. Towards the end of the meeting, he challenged the President and\n\nasked him to apologize to him over the incident concerning the signing of blank receipts.\n\nThe meeting descended into chaos and came to an abrupt end with the majority of the\n\nmembers walking out.102.\n\n        Theyvendran did not attend the 15 February 2001\n\nmeeting which was chaired by Moganaruban. As the chairperson had proceeded wrongly in\n\napplying rule 18.1 of the constitution, it was decided that the issue of the\n\nPlaintiff’s removal from office be dealt with by a full MC meeting convened specially\n\nto consider that matter and that the Plaintiff be asked to show cause in writing.\n\nTheyvendran then referred to rule 13.3 of the constitution which reads:\"The MC shall be empowered\n\n    after due inquiry to remove from office or to expel a member who in its opinion has been\n\n    guilty of injuring or attempting to injure, the Council or of acting contrary to its\n\n    interest\".103.\n\n        At the special meeting held on 1 March 2001\n\nchaired by Moganaruban, it was unanimously resolved that the Standing Orders attached to\n\nthe Notice of Meeting dated 19 February 2001 be adopted. The General Secretary clarified\n\nthat all present were either elected MC members or representatives of the affiliate\n\norganizations, except for Jalaludin who was an observer. It was also agreed by a majority\n\nof 34 against six that as the minutes of the 15 February 2001 meeting were not ready, the\n\nminutes would be read out only. The Plaintiff’s letter of 20 February 2001 was read\n\nout and interpreted in Tamil. The Plaintiff was allowed to address the meeting but spoke\n\nwell beyond the time limit specified in the Standing Orders. Upon completing his speech,\n\nhe walked out of the meeting together with four others, including Amallathasan and\n\nAandeappan. A secret ballot was then conducted by the two appointed scrutineers and the\n\nresult was 32 in favour of the motion to remove the Plaintiff from office and 2 opposing\n\nthe motion.104.\n\n        It was originally the Defendants’ case\n\nthat the following letter dated 5 March 2001 was then sent by the General Secretary to the\n\nPlaintiff :\"EXPULSION FROM TRC\n\n    MANAGEMENT COUNCILThe TRC Management Council at\n\n    its special meeting on 1.3.2001 conveyed for the purposes of your misconduct has by a\n\n    two-third majority voted to expel you from the Management Council.In accordance with TRC\n\n    Constitution (18.1), you are hereby given notice that with effect from 1.3.2001 you are\n\n    hereby expelled from the TRC Management Council. However you have the right to appeal to\n\n    the next Annual General Meeting.We thank you for your past\n\n    contributions and support.(signed)Pandiyan VellasamiGeneral Secretary(on behalf of the TRC MC)cc Mr K Shanmugam\n\n        Advisor, TRCMr R Sinnakaruppan    Advisor, TRCMr R Ravindran    Advisor, TRCMr S Chandra Das    Advisor, TRCMr R Theyvendran    President, TRCMr Moganaruben    Deputy President\".105.\n\n        However, the Defendants conceded during the\n\ncross-examination of the Plaintiff that he was correct in stating that what he received\n\nwas a letter dated 7 March 2001 in the following terms:\"EXPULSION FROM TRC\n\n    MANAGEMENT COUNCILThe TRC Management Council at\n\n    its special meeting held on 1stMarch 2001 conveyed for the purposes of your\n\n    misconduct and after hearing your explanation and your subsequent walkout, decided by a\n\n    two-third majority to expel you from the Management Council.In accordance with TRC\n\n    Constitution (18.1), you are hereby given notice that with effect from 1stMarch 2001 you are hereby expelled from the TRC Management Council.(signed)Pandiyan VellasamiGeneral Secretary\".106.\n\n        After his expulsion in March 2001, the\n\nPlaintiff made no objection or complaint about the MC’s decision until his letter of\n\n19 November 2001 to which the TRC responded, through the General Secretary, by its letter\n\ndated 27 November 2001 setting out the following:\"1. The report sent out to\n\n    all members is for the year ended 31.12.2000. As such the report reflects the activities\n\n    for the year 2000. As the matter you are referring to occurred in March 2001 it will be\n\n    reflected in the next annual report.2. At the Management Council\n\n    meeting held on 15.2.2001 the Chairperson brought charges against you and a vote was\n\n    taken. It has to be noted that majority of the members present voted in support of the\n\n    motion. As this was a monthly meeting a decision was taken to hold a special meeting and\n\n    that you should also be given an opportunity to refute the charges against you. This\n\n    decision was agreed upon by all members present at the meeting.3. At the special meeting called\n\n    on 1.3.2001 your reply was read out and even interpreted in Tamil for the benefit of all\n\n    members and representatives present. You were given ample time to air your views and\n\n    refute the charges brought by the Management Council against you.4. At the end of the proceedings\n\n    a secret vote was taken and the motion to expell you from the post of Deputy General\n\n    Secretary was passed. It has to be noted that 5 members including you had walked out of\n\n    the meeting without the expressed permission of the Chairperson. This again showed your\n\n    disrespect for the Management Council and the Chairperson.5. The decision of the Management\n\n    Council was conveyed to you by registered post on 7.3.2001. It is also to be noted that\n\n    after receiving notice of you being expelled you had not challenged that decision. The\n\n    decision by the Management Council to expell you on 1.3.2001 stands.Thank You.\"107.\n\n        On 30 November 2001, two days before the AGM\n\nscheduled to be held on 2 December 2001, the Plaintiff’s solicitors sent a letter of\n\ndemand in respect of the alleged libel and set the deadline for a response at 12 noon, 1\n\nDecember 2001. The Defendants were naturally unable to respond within that time frame and\n\non 1 December 2001, the TRC was served a writ of summons for alleged wrongful expulsion\n\nfrom office. No claim for libel was made and the General Secretary was not made a\n\nDefendant at that time although he had also received a letter of demand. It was only on 15\n\nMay 2002, almost six months later, that the writ of summons was amended to include him as\n\na Defendant and to add a claim for libel. The Plaintiff knew that the General Secretary\n\nsent correspondence in his capacity as such and with the approval of the MC. Although the\n\npreparation and the issuance of the Annual Report was the act of the MC and was approved\n\nunanimously by the MC, the Plaintiff sued only the General Secretary. He alleged that the\n\nPlaintiff was not sincere and that his legal action was not to seek redress but to\n\nembarrass the Defendants.108.\n\n        Theyvendran went on to assert that the MC acted\n\nin good faith and with propriety. He alleged that the Plaintiff’s action was\n\nmotivated by spite and that the timing of the writ of summons was calculated to threaten\n\nand intimidate the TRC. He said that rules 18 and 23 of the constitution allowed the\n\nPlaintiff to seek redress by convening a General Meeting but he had chosen instead to\n\ncommence legal proceedings. At the last AGM and elections held on 9 June 2002, the\n\nPlaintiff did not stand for elections and neither was he nominated by anyone as a\n\ncandidate. Despite the personal attacks directed against Theyvendran, the President\n\ncarried only one vote in the MC meeting of 1 March 2001 which removed the Plaintiff from\n\noffice by an overwhelming majority. He denied that he and the MC had been autocratic. He\n\nalso claimed that he never undertook that on being elected, he would ensure that Niru be\n\ngiven a leadership role. Niru could have stood for elections for the office of President\n\nor any other position that he sought and there was no need for Theyvendran to give any\n\nsuch undertakings.109.\n\n        The Deputy President informed him that the\n\nreliance on rule 18.1 of the constitution at the 15 February 2001 meeting was misplaced\n\nand that the MC never proceeded to remove the Plaintiff from office. Instead, the MC then\n\ninstituted a fair procedure to deal with the removal. Rule 13.3 conferred express powers\n\non the MC to remove one of its members.110.\n\n        He claimed that he thumped the table at the\n\nmeeting to emphasize a point and was not banging the table in anger. He had his own\n\nsuccessful business and did not need to take up the presidency for personal glory.111.\n\n        Where the Peravai was concerned, that was the\n\nofficial newsletter of the TRC and was distributed to its members. The last publication\n\npermit was for the period 24 October 2000 to 23 October 2001. There was great enthusiasm\n\nto publish the 2002 issue and due to an administrative oversight, the permit was not\n\nrenewed. The outgoing editor resigned sometime in October 2001 and no one attended to the\n\nrenewal of the permit. Since the expiry of the permit on 23 October 2001, only one issue\n\nwas published and that was the January 2002 issue complained of. Various MC members,\n\nincluding Theyvendran, helped in the preparation of that issue. It was printed by Stamford\n\nPress (Pte) Ltd. A new permit for the period 20 June 2002 to 19 June 2003 has been taken\n\nout and the General Secretary is the editor with effect from 20 June 2002.112.\n\n        At the AGM on 2 December 2001, the matter of\n\nthe Plaintiff’s removal from office was discussed and the minutes of that meeting\n\nshowed that the members were informed and knew that he had been removed from his position\n\nas Deputy General Secretary and not as a member of the TRC and that the legal action was\n\nin respect of his expulsion from that office. The January 2002 article was also clear as\n\nto its meaning that the Plaintiff was removed from that office. The 1 March 2001 MC\n\nmeeting was attended by 40 MC members, many of whom represented the affiliated\n\norganizations and they all knew the facts. The rest of the article complained of was true\n\nand correct. The Defendants’ solicitors, in their letter of 7 June 2002, offered in\n\nany event to clarify this matter at the 2002 AGM but the Plaintiff’s solicitors\n\nremarked that the Plaintiff needed no clarification. At the AGM on 9 June 2002,\n\nTheyvendran made the clarification anyway.113.\n\n        Pandiyan Vellasami, the General Secretary and\n\nan administrator working in the Subordinate Courts, testified that he was present at all\n\nthe MC meetings in question and confirmed that the Plaintiff’s conduct was\n\ndisrespectful and disruptive. He said the charges in the show cause letter of 16 February\n\n2001 were justified. At the MC meeting of 14 September 2000 the Plaintiff acknowledged to\n\nthe MC that his conduct was unbecoming by apologizing. At the subsequent meeting of 5\n\nOctober 2000, he again acknowledged that he should not have spoken in the manner he did on\n\n14 September 2000 but he became disruptive again nonetheless that day, warning the MC that\n\nan \"earthquake is on the way\". At the 14 November 2000 meeting, notwithstanding\n\nthe earlier resolution on the Niru issue and the views of many MC members that Chandra\n\nDas’ reply was clear on the issue, the Plaintiff again argued that the said letter\n\nestablished that the MC had the power to bring Niru into the MC.114.\n\n        Pandiyan prepared or vetted the minutes of MC\n\nmeetings. He confirmed that the minutes were a correct reflection of the events that\n\ntranspired although they did not record every detail. Drafts were prepared and then\n\namended before they were finalized and approved. He could not explain how the Plaintiff\n\ncame to have a different version of the minutes for the 5 October 2000 meeting. The TRC\n\noffice in Peace Centre was open to members and the Plaintiff was an office holder at the\n\nmaterial time anyway. Pandiyan conceded that the correct version of the 30 January 2001\n\nminutes was the one set out in the Plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence in chief. A copy\n\nof an earlier draft had been given by mistake during discovery. As for the letter\n\ncontaining the charges, he first drafted a letter containing only four charges. The draft\n\nwas amended by the President to include what appeared as the fourth charge in the 16\n\nFebruary 2001 show cause letter to the Plaintiff. On the day of the special MC meeting,\n\nthinking that some members might forget to bring the show cause letter, he decided to\n\nprint copies of the 16 February 2001 letter from the computer file but unfortunately\n\nretrieved the original draft containing only four charges. The auto-date feature in his\n\ncomputer automatically dated the letter as 1 March 2001. In respect of the letter\n\ninforming the Plaintiff about his expulsion from the MC, again there were different drafts\n\ndone. When discovery of documents took place, the TRC provided an earlier draft to its\n\nsolicitors.115.        \n\nMoganaruban, a businessman and the Deputy President of the TRC, testified that he was\n\npresent at the relevant MC meetings and confirmed that the Plaintiff was indeed\n\ndisrespectful and disruptive at those meetings. He also felt that the charges preferred\n\nagainst the Plaintiff in the show cause letter of 16 February 2001 were justified.116.        On\n\n14 September 2000, after Theyvendran left the meeting, Moganaruban chaired the rest of the\n\nsession. The Plaintiff apologized for his behaviour that evening. The meeting ended with\n\neveryone (including the Plaintiff) agreeing that the MC’s earlier decision on the\n\nNiru issue should stand.117.        \n\nThe 5 October 2000 meeting was chaired by Moganaruban. He confirmed that the resolution\n\nstated in paragraph 98 above was passed by the MC. The Plaintiff’s behaviour at that\n\nmeeting was again objectionable. In spite of the earlier decision made by the MC, he again\n\nmade long speeches to try to persuade the members to appoint Niru to the MC, addressing\n\nthe members for as long as half an hour at times. The majority of the MC wanted an end to\n\nthis and hence the said resolution was passed by all present, including the Plaintiff.\n\nMoganaruban concluded the session with the words, \"no further discussion will be\n\nentertained from now on this issue and the proposed appointment of Mr Nirumalan Pillay as\n\nLegal Adviser shall be discussed sometime in February 2001\". The Plaintiff\n\nnevertheless ended by making the threat, \"it looks like an earthquake is on the\n\nway\".118.        \n\nFor the 14 November 2000 meeting, Moganaruban was the chairperson of the second half of\n\nthe meeting. The letter from Chandra Das was distributed to everyone present and almost\n\neverybody took the view that the letter clearly showed his advice was that Niru be the\n\nlegal advisor. The Plaintiff, however, was of the opinion that the letter gave the MC the\n\npower to appoint Niru as an office bearer in the MC. He was insistent and repetitious in\n\nhis views and would interrupt others and refuse to sit down. That led to the passing of\n\nthe resolution that no further discussion on the Niru issue would be permitted (see\n\nparagraph 39 above), with only the Plaintiff and Amallathasan opposing.119.        \n\nAfter the 30 January 2001 MC meeting, many MC members told Moganaruban that they did not\n\nwish to attend any more meetings because of the way the Plaintiff was behaving. Someone\n\nsuggested that Standing Orders be introduced for better control of the proceedings at\n\nmeetings. When the agenda for the 15 February 2001 meeting was sent out, that meeting was\n\nsupposed to be one of the regular monthly sessions. However, Moganaruban decided that the\n\n15 February 2001 meeting should be used to resolve the problems plaguing the MC. He\n\ntherefore decided that the MC should discuss only item 1 listed in the agenda and not be\n\ndistracted by other matters.120.        It\n\nwas agreed that Moganaruban would chair the meeting, that the minutes of the previous\n\nmeeting would not be distributed as only item 1 was to be discussed and that Standing\n\nOrders be adopted. He sought the views of the members on how to find a solution for the\n\ndiscord at MC meetings. Most of the members were of the view that the Plaintiff was the\n\nproblem. After lengthy discussions, Moganaruban asked the Plaintiff to resign for the good\n\nof the TRC. The Plaintiff refused to do so. He was extremely arrogant and spoke at length\n\nabout how he had done no wrong. He asked the Deputy President what wrong he had done and\n\nwas told it was set out in the minutes of the previous meetings.121.        \n\nFeeling that the meeting was carrying on without any purpose and to bring finality to the\n\nissue. Moganaruban decided to proceed under rule 18.1 of the Constitution. A majority of\n\nthe members voted in favour of charging the Plaintiff with:\"(Plaintiff) had not had\n\n    cordial relations with the President.Had misbehaved at MC meetings\n\n    (banged table, raised his voice, repeatedly brought the meeting to disrepute).Had shown disrespect to the\n\n    Chair\".122.        A\n\nmajority also voted in favour of removing the Plaintiff from office. At this juncture, the\n\nGeneral Secretary informed Moganaruban that rule 18.1 of the Constitution provided that\n\nthe Plaintiff be given an opportunity to respond in writing and that at least two-thirds\n\nof the MC must vote in favour of removal. Moganaruban realized it would be wrong to\n\nproceed any further. As he had proceeded wrongly under rule 18.1, it was decided that the\n\nissue concerning the Plaintiff’s removal from office should be dealt with by a full\n\nMC meeting convened specially for that purpose and that the Plaintiff show cause in\n\nwriting. The Plaintiff did not object to this course of action.123.        On\n\n1 March 2001, Moganaruban was again the Chairperson. The Standing Orders were adopted and\n\nthe Plaintiff’s letter dated 20 February 2001 was read out and interpreted in Tamil.\n\nThe Plaintiff addressed the MC but spoke well beyond the time limit stipulated in the\n\nStanding Orders. He also interrupted other speakers repeatedly. After completing his\n\nsubmissions, he walked out of the meeting with four other MC members. The secret ballot\n\nwas then conducted by the two scrutineers. The result of the ballot showed 32 in favour of\n\nthe motion to remove the Plaintiff from office and 2 against.124.        \n\nWhere the Plaintiff’s claims in defamation were concerned, Moganaruban said the\n\nminutes of the AGM held on 2 December 2001 were prepared and sent to the members of the\n\nTRC for the purpose of the AGM 2002 to be held on 9 June 2002. A 67-page booklet entitled\n\n\"2002 Tamil Representative Council Annual Report, Accounts, Annual General Meeting,\n\nSunday 9 June 2002\" was sent to all TRC members. Ten pages of this booklet set out\n\nthe minutes of the AGM 2001 which were not circulated separately to the members. The\n\nminutes of the AGM 2001 were recorded by a Deputy General Secretary, vetted by the General\n\nSecretary and then approved by the President. The preparation of the Annual Report was\n\napproved by the MC. Moganaruban did not draft the minutes nor arrange the printing of the\n\nAnnual Report. He participated and spoke at the AGM 2001 as the Deputy President and a\n\nmember of the MC when the issue of the Plaintiff’s removal from office came up for\n\ndiscussion and after other members of the MC had already spoken on it. By then, the\n\nmembers of the TRC were aware that the Plaintiff had commenced legal action against the\n\nTRC in respect of his removal from the office of Deputy General Secretary. They were also\n\naware that the Plaintiff could have appealed to the AGM against his removal but did not do\n\nso and that the TRC received a letter of demand on 30 November 2001 and was served with\n\nthe writ of summons the next day.125.        \n\nMoganaruban claimed that the remarks in issue were made by him as an officer of the MC and\n\nhe was informing the members and responding to the members’ questions. He could not\n\nrecall his exact words but accepted that the substance of the ordinary meaning of the\n\nwords recorded in the minutes was correct. He did tell the members that the objective of\n\nthe Plaintiff’s legal action was to threaten the TRC. He remained silent for about\n\nnine months about his removal from office and timed the commencement of his legal action\n\nto fall on the eve of the AGM.126.        \n\nMoganaruban reiterated that the TRC was a representative body and that the decision\n\nleading to the Plaintiff’s removal from office was a collective one made by the TRC\n\nMC and the 26 affiliated organizations. Where his remarks at paragraph 8.18 of the minutes\n\nfor the AGM 2001 were concerned, he made them in response to the preceding speaker who\n\nasked that an EOGM be convened to resolve the issue. He did not think the TRC should incur\n\ncost and spend time on an EOGM about a matter that had been decided by the MC. After all,\n\nthe Plaintiff could have called for an EOGM but chose not to do so. Moganaruban asserted\n\nthat what he said at the AGM 2001 was true and correct and was borne out by the facts. The\n\nPlaintiff’s solicitors’ letter of 12 June 2002 asking him to state if he was\n\nresponsible for the preparation, writing and/or publication of the words in issue set a\n\ntwo-day deadline for his response. It was sent not to his residential address but to the\n\nTRC’s registered address. By the time the letter was sent to him, he was overseas.\n\nWhen he managed to speak with his solicitors about the matter, the Plaintiff had already\n\ninstituted the legal proceedings. His failure to respond could not therefore be construed\n\nas an admission of responsibility on his part.",
        "THE DECISION OF THE COURT": "127.        \n\nThe function of the court in relation to the proceedings of clubs and societies like the\n\nTRC is a supervisory one and is confined to the examination of the decision making\n\nprocess, that is whether the rules of natural justice have been observed and whether the\n\ndecision has been honestly reached. Its function is not to review the evidence and the\n\ncorrectness of the decision itself (Singapore Amateur Athletic Association v Haron bin\n\nMundir[1994] 1 SLR 47).128.        As\n\nthe Defendants have acknowledged that the Plaintiff’s removal from office should not\n\nhave come under rule 18.1 of the TRC Constitution (which deals with expulsion from the TRC\n\nand not the MC), there was no question of the Plaintiff not having exercised his right of\n\nappeal to the next AGM pursuant to that rule. It was agreed that the applicable rule\n\nshould have been rule 13.3 which provides:\"The Management Council\n\n    shall be empowered after due inquiry to remove from office any officer or to expel a\n\n    member who in its opinion has been guilty of injuring or attempting to injure the Council\n\n    or of acting contrary to its interests\".Rule 13.3 would in fact have\n\ngiven the MC a much simpler and swifter expulsion procedure. The subject would not have a\n\nright to exculpate himself in writing. Further, the MC would not need a two-thirds\n\nmajority vote in order to expel the subject. A majority verdict would suffice. The words\n\n\"prejudicial or contrary to the interest of the Council\" (that is, the TRC) in\n\nrule 18.1 and the words \"injuring or attempting to injure the Council or of acting\n\ncontrary to its interests\" in rule 13.3 are really not different in meaning in\n\nsubstance. The Plaintiff therefore had the benefit of a procedure which was more onerous\n\nfor the MC and more advantageous for him. The only claim he could make was one of error as\n\nto form, not substance. It resulted in absolutely no prejudice to him and it appeared that\n\nhe was not misled in any way, for example by appealing to the wrong body in respect of his\n\nexpulsion. It was also clear that the MC had the power to expel him from office and that\n\nit was removing him from office and was not purporting to expel him as a member of the TRC\n\naltogether.129.        \n\nThe Plaintiff was not subject to a double jeopardy in that he was tried twice on the same\n\nallegations. The Deputy President was advised, wrongly as it turned out, at the 15\n\nFebruary 2001 proceedings that the MC ought to have given the Plaintiff a chance to\n\nexculpate himself in writing. Proper charges were formulated. He was given a chance to\n\nshow cause in writing. A full MC was convened on 1 March 2001 and he was given a chance to\n\nshow cause orally. The concluding words in the 16 February 2001 show cause letter to him\n\nmerely repeated the opening words of rule 18.1 and were not evidence of pre-judgment. The\n\ncharges still had to be established and considered sufficient by the MC to attract\n\nexpulsion. The 15 February 2001 proceedings were considered then to be wrong and the MC\n\ntherefore effectively took the view that they were null and void and commenced fresh\n\nproceedings according to the understanding prevailing at that time. If the 15 February\n\n2001 proceedings were valid, as the Plaintiff appeared to be contending, then he was\n\nproperly expelled at the earlier meeting anyway.130.        \n\nThere is a further provision in the TRC Constitution that is of relevance here. Rule 23.1\n\nprovides:\"DISPUTESIn the event of any dispute\n\n    arising amongst members, they shall attempt to resolve the matter at an Extraordinary\n\n    General Meeting in accordance with the rules in the Constitution. Should the members fail\n\n    to resolve the matter, they may bring the matter to a court of law for settlement\".Undoubtedly, the Plaintiff had a\n\n\"dispute\" with at least some members. The Plaintiff was entitled to call for an\n\nEOGM within the terms of rule 10 of the TRC Constitution. He made no attempt at all to do\n\nso. The internal remedy provided by rule 23.1 does not oust the jurisdiction of the\n\ncourts. It is in fact a salutary rule as it discourages resort to litigation as the first\n\noption. InChiam See Tong v Singapore Democratic Party[1994] 1 SLR 278, it was\n\nheld that the plaintiff there did not have to exhaust all domestic remedies as any appeal\n\nwould have to be made to the next party conference which was two years away. In the\n\nmeantime, the plaintiff’s seat in Parliament would have been affected by the long\n\nwait. The domestic remedy clause in that case, unlike the one here, was merely a\n\npermissive one in any event. In the present case, the Plaintiff’s office was\n\nessentially a voluntary service to the Tamil community. His livelihood was not affected in\n\nany way by the expulsion from office. He took no action and appeared to have accepted his\n\nexpulsion between 1 March 2001 and his 19 November 2001 letter of demand. If he was\n\nserious about his office, there was ample time and opportunity for him to move for an\n\nEOGM. He ought to have done so before commencing his court actions.131.        \n\nThe Plaintiff questioned the eligibility of certain persons to attend or vote at the 1\n\nMarch 2001 special MC meeting. The minutes of that meeting indicated that care was taken\n\nto ensure that only persons eligible to attend the meeting were present. Jalaludin was\n\nexcluded by the MC from voting although he represented an affiliated organization because\n\nhe had not been registered. He was appointed a scrutineer without objection. Krishnasamy\n\nhad resigned as an Internal Auditor at an earlier MC meeting but was entitled to be\n\npresent and to vote as he remained a representative of an affiliated organization. The\n\nPlaintiff alleged his purported resignation as Internal Auditor was a manipulative step\n\ndesigned to allow him to vote as the TRC Constitution did not allow a member of the MC to\n\nbe an Internal Auditor. His letter of resignation was not in the records of the TRC and a\n\ncopy was said to have been retrieved from Krishnasamy’s computer only during the\n\ncourse of the trial. However, it was signed. Even if he was not entitled to vote and his\n\nvote, assuming he did vote to expel the Plaintiff, was excluded, there would still have\n\nbeen more than a two-thirds majority. He also attended the 15 February 2001 meeting as\n\nsuch a representative without objection from the Plaintiff or any other person. Two ladies\n\nwere present by virtue of their positions in the Women’s League. The Plaintiff also\n\nsuggested that the meeting had been \"loaded\" with people who were either related\n\nto or were employed by the President and the Deputy President. I see no merit in this\n\nsubmission if they were eligible to attend and to vote. Would the Plaintiff likewise\n\ndisqualify his friends and allies from voting in his favour?132.        \n\nThe 1 March 2001 meeting was called as a special disciplinary meeting to deal with the\n\ncase against the Plaintiff. The members accepted the decision not to circulate the minutes\n\nof the 15 February 2001 meeting which were read out in any event. In any case, the absence\n\nof the said minutes did not place the Plaintiff at a disadvantage in his defence at the 1\n\nMarch 2001 meeting. I do not see the failure to produce written minutes as evidencing bad\n\nfaith. The Plaintiff also said the minutes of the previous meetings did not show that he\n\nwas constantly rehashing the Niru issue but that he was merely responding to the\n\nchairperson who had raised the issue. Minutes vary in their details according to the\n\nrecorder and the person who approves them. I am satisfied from the evidence of the\n\nDefendants and from the motions passed at the meetings that it was the Plaintiff who\n\nconstantly sought to re-open the Niru issue with increasing vehemence and rudeness as time\n\npassed.133.        \n\nThe apparent speed at which the special meeting was convened so soon after the 15 February\n\n2001 one was again no evidence of bad faith. The MC needed to find a quick solution to the\n\ninternal problems plaguing and paralyzing it in its functions. The Plaintiff did not say\n\nhe did not have sufficient time to prepare his written defence. Indeed, he managed to\n\nsubmit it two days before the stipulated deadline. There was also no requirement that the\n\nnotice convening the special meeting should be sent out only after receipt of the\n\nPlaintiff’s response.134.        \n\nStanding Orders were within the province of the MC to make for the orderly conduct of\n\nmeetings. Indeed, they would not have been necessary at all if members could exercise\n\nrestraint and show courtesy to one another and in particular to the person chairing\n\nmeetings. As things turned out, they became necessary because of the behaviour of some\n\nmembers of the MC. Nevertheless, the Standing Orders pertaining to the time limit for\n\nspeaking were not invoked ruthlessly or at all on the Plaintiff or anyone else at the 1\n\nMarch 2001 meeting. As the evidence showed, whether there were Standing Orders or not, the\n\nPlaintiff was not one who was concerned about such niceties. He went on to speak as he\n\nwished and when he was done, walked out with his allies. He had enough time to make his\n\noral defence in addition to his written one which was read out in English and interpreted\n\nin Tamil. The MC proceeded on a lesser number of charges instead of the original five in\n\nthe 16 February 2001 show cause letter but that surely could not have caused the Plaintiff\n\nto suffer any disadvantage.135.        \n\nWhere the discrepancies in documentation were concerned, the Defendants should have been\n\nmore careful in the keeping of their records. I accept that the discrepancies were a\n\nresult of carelessness rather than dishonest intent as the Defendants would gain no real\n\nadvantage from the wrong versions. Their carelessness resulted in some unnecessary debate\n\nduring the trial and would be taken into consideration in my order concerning the costs of\n\nthese proceedings.136.        \n\nWhere Theyvendran’s alleged pre-elections undertaking was concerned, I would only\n\nobserve that it was in the context of both he and Niru running for office. Since Niru had\n\ndecided not to run for office, the undertaking became quite irrelevant. It was not the\n\ncase that Theyvendran had undertaken that he would bring Niru into the MC notwithstanding\n\nhis decision to decline to contest the elections. To do so would require the President\n\nasking an elected member to resign to give way to Niru and that would surely be a breach\n\nof faith with the members who had voted that member into office. In any case, even if\n\nthere was breach of an undertaking by the President, the way to sanction him was not by\n\nway of discourtesy and disruptive repetition of the Niru issue at MC meetings. The\n\nPlaintiff was no stranger to motions of no confidence against incumbent office holders.137.        \n\nThe Plaintiff asserted that he was upset in November 2001 because the documents despatched\n\nto the members of the TRC in advance of the AGM 2001 indicated that he was no longer a\n\nmember of the TRC as opposed to not being a member of the MC. However, his letter of\n\ndemand of 19 November 2001 concerned his office. In addition, he did not attend any more\n\nMC meetings after his expulsion on 1 March 2001. Even if he was not informed about future\n\nMC meetings because the General Secretary no longer sent him notice of such, he knew that\n\nthere must be a meeting every month under the TRC Constitution and would have asked about\n\nthis. His sudden resurrected interest in his office made the Defendants’ allegations,\n\nthat he was lying in wait and had timed his actions to coincide with the upcoming AGM to\n\nintimidate, harass and embarrass them, completely believable. The Plaintiff also chose not\n\nto attend the AGM 2001 and the AGM 2002 except by \"proxy\" and by the\n\nsurreptitious recording of the speeches made. If indeed he was of the view that he\n\nremained a member of the MC, why did he not attend such important annual events like the\n\nAGM? I disbelieved his assertions that he knew he could get no justice from attending a\n\nmeeting controlled by Theyvendran. Perhaps the chain of events from November 2001 was the\n\n\"earthquake\" he foretold.138.        \n\nThere was therefore no breach of any tenets of natural justice. The Defendants dealt\n\nfairly with the Plaintiff even though there were mistakes as to form committed along the\n\nway. The Plaintiff was properly and validly expelled from the office of Deputy General\n\nSecretary on 1 March 2001. The President, the Deputy President and the General Secretary\n\nwere upset or perhaps even exasperated by his conduct at meetings, as would any other\n\nreasonable person, but they bore no malice against him. As the key appointment holders and\n\nbeing part of the MC, they had no choice but to present the facts of the case and their\n\nallegations against the Plaintiff at the special meeting.139.        In\n\nthe light of the above, I do not see how the words complained of in the Annual Report\n\ncould be said to be defamatory of the Plaintiff. They were true and were expressed in\n\nunemotional terms which were totally devoid of judgment. As for the allegations concerning\n\nthe Peravai and the minutes of the AGM 2001, the Plaintiff chose to read the words as\n\nmeaning that he had been expelled from the TRC altogether. That would be putting a\n\nstrained and unreasonable meaning to the words in the context in which they appeared. At\n\nany rate, the MC had informed the AGM 2001 about the Plaintiff’s letter of demand and\n\nhis writ of summons and there could not have been any misunderstanding that the Plaintiff\n\nwas expelled from the TRC and not merely the MC. If Moganaruban’s words that the\n\nPlaintiff was using legal action to threaten the organization were defamatory, they were\n\nperfectly justified and were fair comment in the circumstances I have indicated above. It\n\nshould also be noted that the President made the clarification, although not obliged to\n\nand despite the Plaintiff’s curt reply in his solicitors’ letter, about the\n\nPlaintiff’s status at the AGM 2002 anyway.140.        \n\nThe Plaintiff’s actions against all the Defendants were accordingly dismissed. In\n\nview of the TRC’s carelessness in maintaining the records and the errors committed\n\nduring the disciplinary proceedings, I felt it was fair that the Defendants should not be\n\nawarded the entire costs of the proceedings. I therefore ordered the Plaintiff to pay 70%\n\nof the costs of the actions and directed that there should be only one bill of costs. The\n\nDefendants asked me to make an order for costs against Niru primarily on the grounds he\n\nwas the driving force behind the Plaintiff’s actions which were for his benefit and\n\nhe was the Plaintiff’s financier. I declined to do so as the cross-examination of\n\nNiru did not adduce sufficient material to justify such an order against a non-party to\n\nthe proceedings.Sgd:Tay Yong KwangJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
