        "The court proceedings": "28. Under cross-examination, the plaintiff repeatedly asserted she was/is an\n\nextremely wealthy woman. She denied she was only a housewife when the first defendant married her.\n\nShe claimed (amongst many other contentions) that she operated a wholesale business at the material\n\ntime in the buying and selling of greens (such as onions, garlic and potatoes) in Yangon and another\n\ntown; it gave her a monthly profit of about 25,000 kyats (in 1973 that would be equivalent to\n\nUS$5,000 @ 5 kyats to US$1.00). In addition, she had the rental income from the Green Bank Road\n\nproperty (US$1,000 per month) and from another property at Windermere Road (which was sold and\n\nreplaced by one at University Avenue). Further, she also had an import-export business called\n\nSamanthu as well as a later joint venture business which dealt in hardware and (tinned) food. The\n\nplaintiff asserted that the income she received from rent, her businesses and from selling her\n\njewellery but not the first defendant, supported her children.29. According to the plaintiff, her first husband (U Kyaw Min) and in turn she,\n\nhad a great deal of influence with the top echelons of government at the material time. She claimed\n\nthat (the then ruler) General Ne Win came to know the first defendant through her and she was\n\ninstrumental in his being appointed the managing-director of Burmah Oil at only 38 years of age. She\n\nalleged that the first defendant know that marrying her would be an immense advantage to him. She\n\nfurther alleged that General Ne Win's brother, who was then the director-general of housing, allowed\n\nher to import building materials at the official exchange rate when she constructed the Pyay Road\n\nproperty. She was able to sell off the excess building materials at market rates for 6 million kyats\n\nwhich sum (together with the sale proceeds of Pyay Road) was remitted to Singapore (to the first\n\ndefendant) and part whereof was lent to Aung to purchase No. 7B Kanbawza Avenue.30. The plaintiff even took credit for the free accommodation given to the first\n\ndefendant. She alleged that the Minister for National Housing Board gave them a house more suited to\n\ntheir status (at No. 6 Windermere Gardens) as the first house (at University Avenue) provided by\n\nBurmah Oil was too small. She claimed that because she did not have an official work status,\n\nWindermere Gardens was allotted to the first defendant instead. She further asserted that although\n\nshe alone paid for the Pyay Road property, she added the first defendant's name as co-owner (in\n\n1988-89) to facilitate resale. This was because it was customary to add a spouse's name to the title\n\nof properties so that buyers would have more confidence.31. It would be appropriate at this juncture to make a pertinent observation. My\n\nsuspicion (from reading the affidavits) that Htein and Aung were heavily influenced by the\n\nplaintiff's views in their unflattering portrayal of the first defendant was confirmed by their\n\ncross-examination. It was apparent therefrom that they hardly knew the first defendant whom they had\n\nonly met once or twice; in Aung's case, he was only introduced to the first defendant in or about\n\n1990 some seven (7) years after he first met the plaintiff (in 1983). Consequently, how could Aung\n\nknow what actually transpired relating to the parties' purchase of, the Kanbe Road property (in\n\n1976), the first property (in 1979) and even of the flat (1983)? He only knew what he had been told\n\nby the plaintiff, which may not be accurate. I should add that under cross-examination, it\n\ntranspired that Aung's periodical remittances of US$310,000 to Singapore were actually repayments of\n\nthe plaintiff's loan to him to purchase No. 7B Kanbawza Avenue, on which about $50,000 was still\n\noutstanding as at the date of trial. Aung's testimony may be coloured by the fact that he is\n\nbeholden to the plaintiff for lending a substantial sum to him without interest and without a\n\ndeadline for repayment, notwithstanding that part thereof has been repaid.32. My observation regarding the unreliability of Aung's testimony would equally\n\napply to Htein. In cross-examination, he could only answer \"I don't know\" to\n\nquestions put to him by counsel relating to such matters as, how much money the plaintiff remitted\n\nto Singapore from the sale proceeds of the Kanbe Road property, how she paid for the Pyay Road\n\nproperty and whether she brought the purchase monies from Singapore. What he knew was what he\n\nbelieved or, what was told to him by the plaintiff. I would add that the fact Htein saw the\n\nplaintiff personally attending to payments or construction matters relating to the Kanbe Road or\n\nPyay Road properties did not mean that the monies came from her and not from the first defendant\n\nwho, by his own admission, left such matters to her. Presumably, prudence dictated that the first\n\ndefendant should not return too often to a country which he left for good because of its political\n\nsituation and which had confiscated his four (4) shop-houses, under its nationalisation policy.33. In compliance with my orders made on 22 August 2000, the first defendant\n\nproduced his Singapore income tax assessments for the years 1989 to 1994 (see exhibit D3) and later,\n\nalso those from 1979 to 1983, as well as for last year. It is to be noted therefrom that his income\n\nranged from $32,356 (1979) to $70,627 (2000). The inland revenue authorities were however unable to\n\nprovide copies of his tax assessments for the years 1984-88. The first defendant also produced (see\n\nexhibit D1) statements pertaining to his Citibank accounts showing substantial deposits in United\n\nStates dollars as well as in local currency, covering the period 1998-99. He explained that his\n\nincome from off-shore contracts (N/E 290) would not be reflected in his Singapore tax assessments as\n\nhe kept those earnings abroad. In this regard, the first defendant obtained (at considerable\n\nexpense), statements from his BNP Singapore account from 1983 to 1987 (when the account was closed)\n\nincluding statements which showed BNP extended overdraft facilities (of around $200,000) to him\n\nsecured by his fixed deposit(s). He was unable to produce the statements pertaining to his BNP Paris\n\naccount as that was closed in 1977, some 23 years ago. He did produce statements pertaining to his\n\nCitibank, Bank of America and OCBC accounts as well as, extracts from the HSBC account of the second\n\ndefendant to show remittances which he made thereto from his Citibank account (between 5 October\n\n1999 and 24 January 2000), in connection with the export sales of Elephant House.34. As against the bank statements produced by the first defendant, the plaintiff\n\nsubstantiated her case with two (2) documents:-a. an undated 3 page document in the first defendant's handwriting (see exhibit\n\n  I in the plaintiff's 5thaffidavit filed 29 September 2000) in which he had set out\n\n  items like the amounts of funds sent either to or from Yangon, fixed deposits, amounts spent, sale\n\n  proceeds of cars, interest earned and insurance;b. her statutory declaration made on 4 August 1980 (see exhibit P6) before a\n\n  notary public in Singapore in which she declared she had sold 5 items of jewellery for a total of\n\n  427,000 kyats either at end 1975 or early 1976, which proceeds went towards the purchase and\n\n  construction of the Kanbe Road property.",
        "The findings": "35. Contrary to the high regard expressed for her by the plaintiff's two (2)\n\nwitnesses in their oral and written testimony, I was not impressed with the plaintiff as a witness.\n\nGranted she may well be a devout Buddhist and well versed in Buddhism and its teachings, but I\n\ncertainly did not find the plaintiff to be the refined and elegant lady Htein and Aung made her out\n\nto be. Rather, she came across as strong-willed, domineering, difficult and quite ignorant. Although\n\nI could not understand a word of her testimony before it was translated into English from Burmese, I\n\nformed the distinct impression that the plaintiff was/is an unreasonable person and lived in a world\n\ntotally devoid from reality. My view in this regard is reinforced by the following extracts from\n\npara 6 of the first defendant's Answer and Cross-Petition filed in Divorce Petition No. 2193 of\n\n2000:-(a) Despite the fact that by 1963 her only real source of income was the rental\n\n  from the Green Bank Road property and she was dependent on the respondent's income, the petitioner\n\n  always regarded herself as still belonging to the upper most strata of Yangon society solely on\n\n  account of the fact that her previous husband was a high ranking government official. She\n\n  considered the respondent to be of lower class;(b) despite his best efforts, she never regarded the respondent as an equal let\n\n  alone of equal standing to her late husband. Even when he became the managing-director of the\n\n  Burmah Oil Company in 1970, she despised the fact that he was only a wage-earner;(c) she had for many years fuelled her own illusions of past grandeur, that is,\n\n  of her life with her former husband whom she remembers as a 'powerful man' and she has convinced\n\n  herself, and even others, that the respondent became managing-director of the Burmah Oil Company\n\n  only because of her 'high social status' and that he should be indebted to her for the rest of his\n\n  life;(f) since she moved into the Newton Road property in 1990, she had used the\n\n  master bedroom.almost exclusively for herself and her 50 year old son, Maung Ye Minn has\n\n  occupied for himself the only other bedroom. The respondent has been working in Bangkok since 1997\n\n  and whenever he was in Singapore, he would sleep on a sofa in the living room;(g) she prohibits the respondent from using the telephone to call his mother in\n\n  Yangon or to visit his mother in Yangon and he has had to do so for many years without her\n\n  knowledge. The respondent's mother is now 91 years old.If the above allegations are true, I am not at all surprised that the first\n\ndefendant was driven to find solace with the second defendant who, judging from a photograph of her\n\nin a brochure of Elephant House exhibited in an affidavit, is much younger and considerably more\n\nattractive than the plaintiff. The second defendant was also likely to be a less difficult person\n\nthan the plaintiff.36. In his written testimony, the first defendant deposed that the marriage with\n\nthe plaintiff was already strained by 1977. He had, in reply to counsel's repeated questioning (N/E\n\n301), said that the plaintiff was an influential womanat the time, meaning before her first\n\nhusband died; after 1962 and now, she did not/does not, know anybody. After her first husband's\n\ndeath and the longer the lapse of time thereafter, the lesser her influence; I agree entirely with\n\nthe first defendant's argument. It is too far-fetched to believe that the plaintiff, as the former\n\nwife of U Kyaw Min (whose position as mayor was short-lived anyway) could have had an influence (if\n\nany) stretching over 30 years (1959-1999). People have short memories especially of politicians and\n\nmore so of those who leave or lose power; this is particularly true of a country which overthrew the\n\nlegitimate government of the day and installed a socialist regime thereafter headed by the army,\n\nstarting with General Ne Win. I do not accept that the plaintiff had the influence she made out in\n\nher testimony and which she convinced Htein and Aung she had; it is a pure figment of her\n\nimagination, just like her claims to extreme wealth.37. I shall now elaborate on my finding that the plaintiff is an ignorant woman.\n\nThe factors which support my observation include the following:-a. on her instructions, her counsel had actually suggested to the first\n\n  defendant that he had obtained his doctorate from Kyoto University on just one visit (N/E 294)\n\n  when the first defendant spent 3years on a (then) Burmese\n\n  government scholarship on the course;b. anyone looking at the first defendant's employment history would have\n\n  realised, even without any special knowledge of the oil/petroleum industry, that he worked for\n\n  some of the most well-known oil and oil-related companies and consultancies in the industry --\n\n  names like Amoco Oil, Total Petroleum and US Oil Wells, not to mention our own Sembawang\n\n  Corporation. Yet the plaintiff spoke of the first defendant's occupation and qualifications in the\n\n  most disparaging terms. She even derided the jewellery the first defendant's mother gave to her\n\n  upon her marriage to him as so insignificant that she gave them away.38. I shall also elaborate on my passing comment that her wealth was another\n\nfigment of the plaintiff's imagination or more correctly, her own illusion. This was very obvious\n\nfrom her oral and written testimony. She did not produce one iota of evidence to support her alleged\n\nwealth, supposed businesses in Yangon and vast collection of jewellery, apart from the self-serving\n\nstatutory declaration referred to in para 34(b) above and her bald statements. She did not furnish\n\nany proof that she sold $100,000 worth of jewellery to Singapore's well known Mrs Aw or to another\n\nMr Lau. Aung was unable to say what jewels if any, were in the green jewellery boxes she left in his\n\nsafe-keeping, neither was he present when she allegedly sold some jewellery on one occasion in\n\nYangon. The first defendant had also testified that he bought jewellery for the plaintiff worth\n\n$150,000 after their marriage, so it could well be that she was selling the jewellery he bought for\n\nher and not her own; indeed, that was what the first defendant claimed.39. The hand-written document by the first defendant set out in para 34(a) is at\n\nbest a neutral document. There is nothing stated therein to suggest that all or any of the sums\n\nstated therein belong to the plaintiff; I find that the document has no probative value.40. What cannot be disputed is, that the plaintiff never worked for the 37 years\n\nshe was married to the first defendant; I do not regard her as a businessman. Even if I believe that\n\nshe received a pension from the government after her first husband died, that did not last very long\n\nbecause a year after his death, she married the first defendant and by her own admission, the\n\npension ceased on her re-marriage. I take judicial notice of the fact that the kyat is a currency\n\nwhich is practically worthless outside Myanmar and which, over the past 30 or so years has steadily\n\nlost its value against the United States dollar (and thereby against the Singapore dollar),\n\nparticularly under the rule of the socialist government. So even if the plaintiff did manage to\n\nremit kyats out of Myanmar in recent years (despite the currency restrictions imposed by its\n\ngovernment) how much would they have been worth in Singapore dollars? I doubt it could have been\n\nvery much let alone the huge sums the plaintiff claimed.The decision41. As counsel for the first defendant rightly pointed out in his closing\n\nsubmissions, this OS is not an application under s 59 of the Women's Charter Cap 353 (1997 ed) nor\n\nis it an application for the determination or division of matrimonial assets under s 112 of the same\n\nAct; that will follow after the pending divorce proceedings between the parties have been resolved.\n\nAlthough this fact was conceded by the plaintiff's counsel in her closing submissions, she\n\nnevertheless prayed (see para 2) that theplaintiff's actual legal right to the matrimonial\n\nproperty be determined.With respect, that submission is misconceived as it is not the relief\n\nprayed for under the OS. It is also to be noted that the OS is not founded on any express trust and\n\nindeed the plaintiff did not allege there was one.42. Consequently, the plaintiff's claim can only be based on a resulting trust\n\nfor which the onus is on her to prove:-(i) that she paid half () the purchase\n\n  price of the flat;(ii) that she entrusted $600,000 of her own monies to the first defendant for\n\n  safe-keeping.On the evidence, the plaintiff has failed to discharge the burden of proof for\n\nboth claims. Her counsel, throughout the closing submissions submitted for the plaintiff, criticised\n\nthe first defendant's testimony as being unreliable, contradictory and unsubstantiated. Where she\n\nwas unable to refute the first defendant's evidence, for example when confronted with the\n\nunassailable payments he received from SAIPEM, counsel conveniently brushed them aside with the\n\ncursory comment that they are not issues in this OS but will be taken into account for the ancillary\n\nhearing pursuant to the divorce petition (see paras 56 and 58 of the plaintiff's submissions). Such\n\ncriticisms ignore a basic principle of law -- he who alleges must prove, it is not for the opposing\n\nparty to disprove. It is not for the first defendant to prove he had the means to pay for the\n\npurchase price of the flat or that the monies in all his bank accounts belonged to him.The\n\nburden is on the plaintiff to provethat the monies that went into the flat, the first property,\n\nthe various properties in Myanmar and the first defendant's bank accountsbelong to herpartially or totally; she failed miserably in discharging that onus.43. Notwithstanding that the burden was not on the first defendant to prove that\n\nhe had the means and the wherewithal to pay for the couple's 2 matrimonial homes in Singapore as\n\nwell as to amass the substantial sums in his various bank accounts, I am of the view that he has\n\nmore than discharged the burden, based on the documents he produced in court and from his oral\n\ntestimony. He struck me as a gentleman who spoke the truth and who, despite the poor treatment he\n\nhad received over the years from the plaintiff and despite the lack of gratitude from her and her\n\nchildren for what he had done for them, still discharged his duties to her and to them as her\n\nhusband and their stepfather, until 1999.44. Accordingly, I dismiss the OS with costs to the first defendant (to be taxed\n\nunless otherwise agreed) and with costs fixed at $1,000 to the second defendant, as she took no part\n\nin the cross-examination process.45. Finally, I wish to make it clear that my decision in these proceedings should\n\nnot affect or prejudice the plaintiff in her claim on the ancillary reliefs in the event that her\n\nmarriage to the first defendant is dissolved in Divorce Petition No. 2193 of 2000.",
