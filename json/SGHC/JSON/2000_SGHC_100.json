        "The decision": "19. There is little doubt that the plaintiffs were prompted to make\n\nthis application in their own interests and, by the same token, the defendant is resisting\n\nit for his own selfish reasons. I disbelieved both sides' claims to the noble reasons for\n\ntheir respective actions.20. The only issue that needed to be determined was, does the Will\n\nexpressly prohibit a sale of the property as the defendant contends or, does it merely\n\npostpone it as the plaintiffs submit? Attendant to the issue is the peripheral issue of\n\nwhether the four beneficiaries under the Will only have a contingent interest in the sale\n\nproceeds of but, not in the property itself. I had, in the orders which I made, taken the\n\nview that the sale of the property was not prohibited but only postponed which\n\npostponement I terminated and in the process expedited the sale, in order to bring about\n\nan equitable solution to the existing impasse between the siblings.21. It would be appropriate to first refer to s 56(1) of the Trustees\n\nAct Cap 337 (the Act); it states:-Where in the\n\n  management or administration of any property vested in trustees, any sale, lease,\n\n  mortgage, surrender, release or other disposition, or any purchase, investment,\n\n  acquisition, expenditure, or other transaction, is in the opinion of the court expedient,\n\n  but the same cannot be effected by reason of the absence of any power for that purpose\n\n  vested in the trustees by the trust instrument, if any, or by law, the court may –(a) by order confer upon the trustees, either generally or in any\n\n  particular instance, the necessary power for the purpose, on such terms, and subject to\n\n  such provisions and conditions, if any, as the court may think fit; and(b) direct in what manner any money authorised to be expended, and the\n\n  costs of any transaction, are to be paid or borne as between capital and income.The above section has to be read with s 2(2) of the Act which states:-The powers\n\n  conferred by this Act on trustees are in addition to the powers conferred by the\n\n  instrument, if any, creating the trust, but those powers, unless otherwise stated, apply\n\n  if and so far only as a contrary intention is not expressed in the instrument, if any,\n\n  creating the trust, and have effect subject to the terms of that instrument.The above two sections would help to address whatever shortcomings\n\nthere may be in the Will in carrying out the wishes of the deceased so long as it did not\n\nmean going against his express wishes. Section 59(3) of the Act specifically empowers\n\neither trustees or beneficiaries under the trust to apply to court under the section.22. Next, I turn to the cases cited. In support of their submission\n\nthat the Court was empowered by s 59 of the Act to order an immediate sale of the\n\nproperty, the plaintiffs relied on the recent decision inRajabali Jumabhoy &\n\nOthers v Ameerali R Jumabhoy (supra).There, the Court of Appeal inter alia had to\n\ndetermine the terms of a deed of settlement relating to a property (at No. 8 Scotts Road)\n\nwhich expressly gave the trustees a power of sale but with the discretion to postpone the\n\nsale for so long as the trustees think fit. The appellate court, following the decision inMarlborough v Attorney-General(supra) held that the fact that there was a\n\ndiscretion vested in the trustees as to the timing of the sale did not prevent the trust\n\nfor sale from arising.23. InMarlborough v Attorney-Generalthe English Court of\n\nAppeal had to interpret the following clause 11 of a deed of settlement dated 11 April\n\n1905 made by the then Duke of Marlborough:Notwithstanding anything herein contained no sale of any hereditaments\n\n  for the time being subject to the trusts hereof or of any right or interest therein or\n\n  thereover and no purchase of any hereditaments under any power herein contained and no\n\n  investment of any capital money for the time being held on the trusts hereof and no change\n\n  of any investment for the time being held on the trusts hereof shall (except in pursuance\n\n  of an order of the court) be made by the trustees or trustee without the previous consent\n\n  in writing of the present Duke during his life and after the death of the present Duke\n\n  without the previous consent in writing of the person in whom the Dukedom of Marlborough\n\n  settled by the said Act 5 Anne Chapter 3 , shall for the time being be vested thereunder\n\n  if such person shall be of full age…..Morton LJ held that the trust for sale effected an immediate conversion\n\nnotwithstanding the necessity for consent. He said (at pp 154-5):-The doctrine of\n\n  conversion arose, no doubt from the rule of equity which considers that as being done\n\n  which ought to be done, and the courts might have taken the view in the past that if a\n\n  sale under the trust for sale in a deed is only to take place with the consent of AB no\n\n  conversion takes place until such consent is given to the trustees. It might have been\n\n  held that then, and only then, does it become the duty of the trustees to sell, and then,\n\n  and only then, does conversion take place in equity. It is however, well settled that if\n\n  real property is vested in trustees on trust for sale with the consent of AB, the consent\n\n  is treated as intended to regulate the exercise of the trust for sale, but not to prevent\n\n  the trust for sale from being an immediate trust; and if there is an immediate trust for\n\n  sale, whether subject to consent or not, the trust operates at once to effect a\n\n  conversion…..24. Looking at cl 3 of the Will in its context, and bearing in mind the\n\nabove extract from Morton LJ's judgment, it seems quite clear to me that a sale of the\n\nproperty was merely postponed, not prohibited, until all four beneficiaries unanimously\n\nagreed to the same.25. Counsel had also relied onSaunders v Vautierin support of\n\nthe plaintiffs’ proposition that they had an immediate, not a contingent interest in\n\nthe property. The headnotes in that case read:-By his will the testator bequeathed to his executors and trustees all\n\n  the East India stock which should be standing in his name at his death on trust to\n\n  accumulate the dividends until his great nephew V should attain twenty-five and then to\n\n  transfer the principal, together with such accumulations, to V, his executors,\n\n  administrators, or assigns absolutely. The will also contained a residuary bequest. The\n\n  testator had2,000 East India stock standing in his name\n\n  at his death.Held: V took an immediate vested interest in the legacy although\n\n  he was a minor at the testator's death and, the stock, with its accumulations, would be\n\n  transferred to him on his attaining the age of twenty-five.Looking at cll 2 and 3 of the Will in the above context and in the\n\nlight of my decision on the main issue, I was unable to accept the argument of counsel for\n\nthe defendant that the four beneficiary sons of the deceased only had a contingent\n\ninterest in the sale proceeds of the property, if and when a sale was effected.26. I had fixed the sale price of the property at or above $3.75m based\n\non the two valuations obtained, one from the plaintiffs' valuers (at $4.3m) and the other\n\nfrom the defendant's valuars ($3.2m); I took the average of the two valuations ($7.5‹2). I should add that the defendant instructed his\n\nvaluer to apportion the valuation figure of $3.2m between the house ($150,000) and the\n\nland ($3,050,000), an unreasonable and unjustified stance. It was clear from photographs\n\nexhibited in the affidavits that the house itself was worthless and the value of the\n\nproperty was in the land; any purchaser would have to demolish the existing house and\n\nrebuild. Counsel for the defendant informed the court that even based on his client's own\n\nvaluation, the defendant would have difficulty obtaining a loan from any financial\n\ninstitution (due to his age and income level) to buy over theŽshare of his siblings. Yet, he was adamant on\n\ncontinuing to reside at the property. The defendant's attitude to say the least was\n\nunreasonable. Even if he succeeded in postponing the sale of the property until his death,\n\nthe defendant was being short-sighted in his complacency. The day of reckoning could not\n\nbe postponed indefinitely and a time would come when selling the property became\n\ninevitable either during or after, the lifetime of the defendant. The defendant and or his\n\nfamily would then be forced to seek alternative accommodation which can only become\n\nincreasingly more expensive in land scarced Singapore.27. Consequently, the only feasible solution in the interests of all\n\nthe siblings, none of whom were particularly well-to-do, was to order an immediate sale of\n\nthe property so that all the beneficiaries could obtain theirŒshare of the sale proceeds either to purchase an\n\nalternative home (as in the case of the defendant) or to find some other use for their\n\nmoney which would be quite substantial; hence the orders which I made.",
