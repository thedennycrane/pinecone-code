        "Background": "4 On 7 April 2021, the 1st defendant filed HC/SUM 1582/2021, seeking,interalia, an injunction against the plaintiff.5Foot Note 5×1st Defendant’s Bundle of Documents dated 5 November 2021 (“DBOD”) at pp 4–5.On 29 April 2021, I ordered that until the final determination of Suit 221 or 17 September 2021 (inclusive) (whichever occurs earlier), the plaintiff would “be restrained from commencing work for, rendering services to, being employed by or being otherwise involved in any activity or business of, directly or indirectly, Virgin Australia Airlines Pty Ltd or its related bodies corporate (as the term is defined in the Corporations Act 2001)”.6Foot Note 6×DBOD at pp 254–255.I will refer to this as the “injunction”. 5 On 23 August 2021, the 1st defendant filed HC/SUM 3954/2021 for leave to apply for an order of committal against the plaintiff. I granted leave to the 1st defendant on 15 September 2021.7Foot Note 7×DBOD at pp 663–664. 6 On 16 September 2021, the 1st defendant filed HC/SUM 4350/2021 (“SUM 4350”) seeking an order of committal against the plaintiff.8Foot Note 8×DBOD at pp 666–668.I heard SUM 4350 on 12 November 2021, and I now give my decision.",
        "The law": "7 I start with a brief summary of the law on contempt of court. 8 The general principles are not in dispute. The applicant who seeks to establish contempt of court has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt (s 28 of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (Act 19 of 2016) (“APA”)). 9 In deciding whether contempt has been committed, the court will first decide what exactly the order of court required the alleged contemnor to do (or to refrain from doing). In determining what the order of court required, the court will interpret the plain meaning of the language used, and it will resolve any ambiguity in favour of the person who had to comply with the order. Second, the court will determine whether the requirements of the order of court have been fulfilled. The complainant will need to show that in committing the act complained of or omitting to comply with an order of court, the alleged contemnor had the necessarymensrea(PTSandipala Arthaputra v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and others[2018] 4 SLR 828 (“PTSandipala”) at [46]). 10 The threshold to establish the necessarymensreais a low one. It is only necessary for the complainant to show that the relevant conduct of the alleged contemnor was intentional and that the alleged contemnor knew of all the facts which made such conduct a breach of the order – this includes knowledge of the existence of the order and its material terms. It is not necessary for the complainant to show that the alleged contemnor appreciated he was breaching the order: the motive or intention of the alleged contemnor and his reasons for disobedience are irrelevant to the issue of liability and are relevant only to the issue of mitigation. The liability is strict in the sense that all that is required to be proved is service of the order and the subsequent omission by the alleged contemnor to comply with the order (PTSandipalaat [47]–[48]). 11 As the breaches complained of in this case occurred outside Singapore and the plaintiff currently resides outside Singapore, I also note in the interests of completeness that under section 11(4) of the APA, the court has jurisdiction to try any contempt of court and to impose the full punishment under the APA,inter alia,where the person who commits contempt of court under section 4 of the APA is legally bound to obey or comply with the judgment, direction  or an order of court or an undertaking given to a court, regardless of whether the disobedience or failure to comply occurred in Singapore or elsewhere. It is not disputed that the plaintiff is legally bound to obey and to comply with the injunction. Section 12(6) of the APA further provides that “[t]o avoid doubt, the court may, if the interests of justice so require, find a person guilty of contempt of court and impose the punishment under this section even though the person is absent”.",
        "The first alleged breach": "12 I now turn to the first alleged breach.",
        "The parties’ submissions": "49 The 1st defendant argues that the appropriate sentence in the present case is an imprisonment term of five days.60Foot Note 60×DWS at para 77.Citing the decision of the Court of Appeal (the “CA”) inMokKah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao[2016] 3 SLR 1 (“Mok Kah Hong”) at [104], the 1st defendant submits, first, that it has been irreversibly prejudiced by the plaintiff’s breaches of the injunction.61Foot Note 61×DWS at paras 72 and 76(a).Second, the plaintiff did not act under pressure.62Foot Note 62×DWS at para 76(b).Third, the plaintiff’s actions were deliberate and intentional.63Foot Note 63×DWS at para 76(c).Fourth, his repeated and surreptitious breaches of the injunction evince a high degree of culpability on his part.64Foot Note 64×DWS at paras 71 and 76(d).Fifth, the plaintiff has shown no true contrition and has only sought to deny or explain away his conduct.65Foot Note 65×DWS at para 76(e). 50 The plaintiff, for his part, argues that even if the court finds he has breached the injunction, an order for a fine or committal is unwarranted.66Foot Note 66×PWS at para 82.Instead, the court should not order any punishment against the plaintiff and should dismiss the 1st defendant’s application.67Foot Note 67×PWS at para 86.First, according to the plaintiff, he was fully transparent in disclosing documents pursuant to the 1st defendant’s discovery request, and honestly believed he had complied with the injunction.68Foot Note 68×PWS at paras 87 and 89.Second, the plaintiff says that any breach he committed of the injunction was “only technical” and did not undermine the object and spirit of the injunction, which was to protect the 1st defendant’s confidential information – the plaintiff had not deliberately concealed or tried to cleverly manoeuvre around the injunction,69Foot Note 69×PWS at para 93.and he did not misuse the 1st defendant’s confidential information in any of the acts constituting the alleged breaches.70Foot Note 70×PWS at paras 94–95.Third, any breach of the injunction by the plaintiff was (according to him) “casual, accidental and unintentional”,71Foot Note 71×PWS at para 98.and the plaintiff did not intend to disobey the injunction.72Foot Note 72×PWS at para 101.Fourth, any breach of the injunction is not so sufficiently serious as to warrant punishment – the 1st defendant has not adduced any facts to show that it has been prejudiced due to the plaintiff’s conduct.73Foot Note 73×PWS at para 102.Lastly, the plaintiff is a first-time offender and has extended his unreserved apology to the court.74Foot Note 74×PWS at para 103.",
        "My decision": "62 In the present case, as a matter of principle, I accept the 1st defendant’s submission that the sentence to be imposed serves two functions: the first is a punitive function,iethe plaintiff is punished for disobeying a court order; the second is one of general deterrence,iepersons who might be inclined to disobey court orders are deterred from doing so by the knowledge of the potential sanctions.75Foot Note 75×DWS at para 68. 63 Applying the sentencing factors identified inMokKah Hongto the facts of this case, there is no evidence of the plaintiff in this case having acted under pressure. The plaintiff himself has not suggested he was acting under pressure.  There is also no evidence of the plaintiff having been placed in breach of the order by reason of the conduct of others; nor has he made such a suggestion. Further, given my findings at [18] and [33] in respect of the Hyman incident and the Baart incident, it is clear that the plaintiff’s breaches were deliberate and intentional. In this connection, it is also clear that regrettably, the plaintiff appears not to appreciate the seriousness of the deliberate breach: the apology offered towards the end of his affidavit – while it purports to be “unreserved” – persists in characterising his own behaviour as inadvertent and unintentional.76Foot Note 76×DBOD at p 682, para 35.In addition, considering that I have found two instances of a breach of the injunction, the plaintiff bears quite a high degree of culpability. In the circumstances, this is not a suitable case for imposing no punishment at all (as submitted by the plaintiff). 64 On the other hand, although the 1st defendant has described the plaintiff’s breaches as having been committed “surreptitiously” and “away from the public eye”,77Foot Note 77×DWS at para 71.it is not clear to me what the 1st defendant meant to convey by that remark. It is not suggested, for example, that the plaintiff’s interactions with Hyman, Magdic, Hrdlicka and Baart were conducted in a clandestine or secret manner. Nor was this a case where the contemnor sought to conceal or obfuscate the documentary trail he was leaving. Ultimately, it seems to me all the 1st defendant meant was that it had not been aware of the plaintiff’s breaches at the time they were committed and had come to know of them only afterwards. Whilst this would be relevant to the issue of reversibility of any harm or prejudice caused, I do not think it qualifies as “surreptitious” behaviour on the plaintiff’s part. 65 As to the issue of prejudice, although the 1st defendant’s written submissions repeatedly asserted that it had been irreversibly prejudiced as a result of the plaintiff’s conduct, it was unable precisely to identify what prejudice this was. Apart from a bare statement in Vesna Vinski’s 4th affidavit78Foot Note 78×DBOD at p 199, para 27.to the effect that the 1st defendant had been prejudiced, there was no evidence of the alleged prejudice in the affidavits and documentation before me. It was suggested in the 1st defendant’s written submissions that any prejudice it suffered would be “difficult toquantify”79Foot Note 79×DWS at para 75.[emphasis added] – and that may indeed be so, but at the very least, the 1st defendant should have been able to identify and describe the type of prejudice in question: whether, for example, it was prejudice in the form of the loss of competitive advantage or the loss of a business opportunity. Absent any evidence, the court cannot be the one suggesting the sort of prejudice the 1st defendant may have suffered. 66 The 1st defendant has also submitted that a fine in this case will not be sufficient punishment for the plaintiff because he is a highly-paid executive who can afford to pay off a fine.80Foot Note 80×DWS at para 79.I think the fact that a contemnor has some financial means cannotper selead to the conclusion that a fine will never be sufficient punishment. Whether a fine is sufficient punishment in any case will depend on the court’s evaluation of the various sentencing factors in that case. I add that I do not agree that in principle, a fine can never amount to sufficient deterrence to other persons who might be minded to breach similar orders of court. Again, the court’s decision as to what is required to satisfy the deterrent function of the sentence must be based on its assessment of the various factors before it. 67 Lastly, the 1st defendant also appears to suggest that the plaintiff’s new employer (Virgin Australia) “can easily pay off the fine” on his behalf81Foot Note 81×DWS at para 80.– but there is no evidence to support any such suggestion, and I therefore do not give it any weight. 68 InPTSandipala, the court pointed out that “committal to prison is usually a measure of last resort” (at [68]). In the light of the factors I have outlined above, and comparing the present case with the available sentencing precedents, I am of the view that a custodial sentence is not warranted in this case and that a high fine will suffice. Accordingly, I order that the plaintiff is to pay a fine of S$25,000 within two weeks from today, with a term of one week’s imprisonment in default of payment.",
        "The second alleged breach": "22 I now turn to the second alleged breach.",
        "The third alleged breach": "35 I now turn to the third alleged breach.",
        "The plaintiff’s other arguments": "43 For completeness, I note that the plaintiff also argues that the court ought to dismiss the 1st defendant’s application because the terms of the injunction are unclear and ambiguous.52Foot Note 52×PWS at para 45.The plaintiff submits that the terms of the injunction could be construed to mean that the plaintiff must not have even the remotest connection with Virgin Australia or its activities or business – according to the plaintiff, for example, he would not be able to use Virgin Airlines’ services to fly from Japan to Australia, because flying on Virgin Airlines would amount to involvement in Virgin Australia’s activities or business,53Foot Note 53×PWS at para 51.or he would not be able to attend a public event sponsored by Virgin Australia,etc. Second, according to the plaintiff, the plain meaning of the injunction is that it applies to classes and categories of conduct which are not caught by the Restraint of Trade Provision, and goes far beyond the 1st defendant’s own case for why the injunction was sought and obtained.54Foot Note 54×PWS at paras 58–60.Third, the injunction was obtained “solely” to protect the 1st defendant’s confidential information,55Foot Note 55×PWS at para 66.but the 1st defendant is now relying on the injunction to,inter alia, impose a “bare and blatant” restriction that protects no legitimate interest56Foot Note 56×PWS at para 69(e).and has nothing to do with the Restraint of Trade Provision or the protection of the 1st defendant’s confidential information.57Foot Note 57×PWS at para 70.Lastly, the plaintiff argues that because the terms of the injunction are “ambiguous”, the court ought to resolve the ambiguities in the injunction in favour of the plaintiff.58Foot Note 58×PWS at para 72.Since none of the alleged breaches involved the plaintiff undermining the protection of the 1st defendant’s confidential information, it means the plaintiff had not breached the injunction.59Foot Note 59×PWS at paras 73, 75, 77 and 79. 44 I find no merit in the plaintiff’s argument that the terms of the injunction are ambiguous or that they can potentially be understood to cover things that have not the remotest connection with the business or activities of Virgin Australia. This is not a case for any genuine doubt about what the court’s purpose in granting the injunction was (AurolAnthony Sabastian v Sembcorp Marine Ltd[2013] 2 SLR 246 (“Aurol(CA)”) at [74]). This is not at all a case likeAurol(CA),where it was unclear whether the Assistant Registrar – in granting an interim sealing order in respect of “Mr Wong Weng Sun’s 5th supporting affidavit dated 26 November 2010” – intended to seal the 5th affidavit which was actually dated 3 December 2010, or the 4th affidavit which was dated 26 November 2010 (at [77]). In the present case, the phrase “involved in any activity or business of, directly or indirectly, Virgin Australia Airlines Pty Ltd or its related bodies corporate” is preceded and qualified by the words “or being otherwise”, which in turn references the preceding phrase “commencing work for, rendering services to, being employed by”. It would have been clear that the references to involvement “in any activity or business of, directly or indirectly” had to be read in the context of the preceding restrictions, and that these references would not – indeed, could not – include things which had not the remotest connection with Virgin Australia’s business or activities (eg, taking a Virgin Airlines flight to get from Japan to Australia). 45 Quite apart from the lack of ambiguity in the terms of the injunction, it is clear that the plaintiff himself has never been in any danger of being confused or misguided about what he was enjoined from doing. From the explanations proffered in the plaintiff’s affidavit to justify his actionsvis-à-visHyman and Baart, it is clear that the plaintiff was (and is) well aware of the difference between conduct that would amount to a breach of the injunction and conduct that would not. Thus, for example, in relation to the Baart incident, he took pains to try to downplay the significance of Hrdlicka’s 27 June 2021 email, insisted that his meeting with Baart was purely a social catch-up, and sought to emphasise in some detail his efforts to avoid all mention of Virgin Australia during the meeting. I add that the 1st defendant’s application for the injunction was heardinterparteson 29 April 2021, with the plaintiff being represented by counsel. It was not suggested by the plaintiff at the hearing that the terms of the injunction as prayed for were unclear or ambiguous, or that he did not understand what they required him to do or to refrain from doing, or that they went beyond what was necessary to protect the 1st defendant’s legitimate interests. Nor, in the six months since, has the plaintiff attempted to vary or set aside the injunction on the basis that its terms are unclear or ambiguous or that they go beyond what was necessary to protect the 1st defendant’s legitimate interests. To raise such an argument now is really to attempt a much belated collateral attack on the court’s orders. I find these arguments to be without merit, and I reject them accordingly. 46 Having found that the plaintiff committed two of the three alleged breaches, I find that he has breached the terms of the injunction by involving himself in the business and activity, directly, of Virgin Australia. 47 I now turn to the appropriate sentence to be imposed.",
        "The appropriate sentence": "48 Section 12(1)(a) of the APA provides that where the power to punish for contempt is exercised by the General Division of the High Court (as in the present case), a person who commits contempt of court shallbe liable to be punished with a fine not exceeding $100,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or with both. I note that s 12(5) of the APA states that despite subsection (1), the court may discharge the person who has committed contempt or remit the punishment, on his or her purging of the contempt, submission to the order or direction of the court, or on apology being made to the satisfaction of the court.",
        "Sentencing principles": "51 I now summarise the general principles on sentencing for contempt of court, based on the caselaw. 52 InPTSandipala, George Wei J referred to the CA’s judgment inMokKah Hong, and noted that the factors relevant to sentencing include (but are not limited to): whether the applicant has been prejudiced, whether the contempt is capable of being remedied, the extent to which the contemnor acted under pressure, whether the breach was deliberate or unintentional, the degree of culpability, whether the contemnor was placed in breach of the order by reason of the conduct of others, whether the contemnor appreciated the seriousness of the deliberate breach, and whether the contemnor co-operated (at [69]). Wei J also held that, in determining the appropriate sanction, the court should consider whether the contemnor has taken steps since the breach to purge the contempt (at [77]). 53 InPTSandipala, the two contemnors had breached three orders for the examination of judgment debtor (“EJD”) by failing to appear at the EJD  hearings or to answer the EJD questionnaires or to provide any documents or books relevant to their assets at the time of the breaches (at [50]–[51]). Wei J sentenced the two contemnors to seven days’ imprisonment each (at [88]). In so doing, he took into account the fact that while both contemnors had eventually provided answers to the EJD questionnaires, these answers comprised bare denials of assets and income with almost no information or details provided, which did little to mitigate, let alone purge, the contempt (at [77]). He also noted their lack of genuine remorse and failure to take real and substantial steps to address the breaches (at [83]). Wei J found that the breaches were serious and repeated, the delay caused was considerable, and the alleged contemnors remained unwilling to answer questions on their personal assets (at [85]). The contemnors’ appeal to the CA was dismissed (with no written grounds of decision). 54 Wei J also referred to several other cases where the court had imposed a custodial term. I summarise these as follows. 55 InSembcorp MarineLtd v Aurol Anthony Sabastian[2013] 1 SLR 245 (“AurolAnthony”), the High Court imposed a sentence of five days’ imprisonment (at [89]). Following a review of the case law, the High Court noted that the following principles were relevant in sentencing: the attitude behind the contemptuous behaviour, the motive for committing the contemptuous act, whether a fine would have been an adequate deterrent, the reversibility of the breach, the standard of care expected of the individual, the nature of the contemptuous act, whether the contemnor was remorseful, and whether the contemnor had procured others to commit the contemptuous act (at [68]). The court found that the alleged contemnor, Mr Aurol (“Aurol”), had deliberately and cynically breached an interim sealing order (at [70]), and had been less than forthright throughout the hearings (at [72]). Aurol had forwarded the sealed documents to a journalist, one Mr Raj, whom Aurol knew had published unfavourable articles about the applicant in the past, and Aurol did not inform Mr Raj that the documents were sealed. The court found that Aurol had thereby enticed Mr Raj to publish an article based on the sealed documents (at [78], [81]). The court, however, held that a lengthy custodial sentence was not necessary or desirable as Aurol’s breach was a “once and for all breach”, no financial damage was caused to the applicant, and Aurol was not an officer of the court (at [86]–[88]). 56 For completeness, I note that Aurol’s appeal was allowed by the CA inAurol(CA), on the ground that the terms of the interim sealing order were ambiguous (at [84], [96]), but the CA did not disagree with the sentencing principles articulated by the High Court. 57 InGlobal Distressed Alpha FundI Ltd Partnership v PT Bakrie Investindo[2013] SGHC 105 (“Global Distressed Alpha Fund”), the High Court imposed a sentence of seven days’ imprisonment (at [59]). In that case, the contemnor had failed to attend the EJD hearings on eight occasions (at [37]–[49]), and had been late in responding to the questionnaire on his assets (at [52]). The court noted that the contemnor’s conduct had prevented the judgment creditor from taking substantive steps to realise the fruits of its litigation (at [55]), and the contemnor had evinced no remorse for his actions (at [57]). On checking, however, I note that there was an appeal from the High Court’s decision in Civil Appeal No 41 of 2013, which was heard before the CA on 4 November 2013. The CA set aside the custodial sentence and imposed instead a fine of $25,000. No written grounds of decision were issued by the CA. 58 InTahir vTay Kar Oon[2016] 3 SLR 296, the High Court imposed a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment (at [67]). The contemnor had breached orders requiring her to attend two scheduled court hearings and to provide answers to an EJD questionnaire (at [5]–[11]). The contemnor admitted liability at the committal proceedings (at [18]), and sentencing was adjourned three times to allow her time to purge the contempt (at [21], [26], [29]). At the final hearing, the applicant applied for leave to withdraw his committal application as he was satisfied that the contempt had been substantially purged (at [31]). The court found that the applicant had suffered real prejudice by virtue of the contempt, which was not capable of remedy (at [53]), and that the contemnor had made no genuine attempts to cooperate and comply with court orders (at [54]). The contemnor’s concealment of additional breaches was persistent even when great leeway had been given to allow her to purge the contempt (at [66]). 59 On appeal, the CA inTay KarOon v Tahir[2017] 2 SLR 342 set aside the imprisonment term and imposed a fine of $10,000 (or, in default, ten days’ imprisonment) (at [63]). In so doing, the CA took into consideration the fact that the contemnor appeared to have substantially purged the contempt by complying with the various orders and directions (at [57]); the applicant had suffered little, if any, discernible prejudice from the contemnor’s failure to comply with the directions (at [59]); and the contemnor suffered from major depressive disorder at the time of the various breaches, which appeared to have hampered her ability to deal with the various legal proceedings she was facing (at [60]). 60 InOCM Opportunities Fund II, LPand others v Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and others[2005] 3 SLR(R) 60, the High Court imposed a custodial sentence of six months on each of the contemnors (at [37]). The High Court found that the contemnors had failed to comply with clear and unambiguous orders of which they had notice, under a Mareva injunction granted by the court (at [2]–[3], [30]). They also absented themselves from court on both of the days fixed for cross-examination (at [31]–[32]). Lastly, the court found that the contemnors had not purged their contempt, and remained uncooperative, deliberate and contumacious in breaching the terms of the orders (at [36]). 61 Lastly,MokKah Hong(which the High Court inPTSandipalacited and followed) was a civil contempt matter arising from divorce proceedings. The husband in that case had a history of acting in flagrant disregard of judgments or orders made by various courts at all levels: his breaches included acting in disregard of an injunction against dissipating, disposing of and/or otherwise dealing with property as well as acting in disregard of orders to pay specified maintenance amounts to the wife (at [52]). Noting that “[a]lmost all the egregious factors which were employed by the courts to impose a stiff sentence on the contemnors” in previous cases could be found on the facts before it, and finding moreover that the husband’s non-compliance was “bothdeliberateandfraudulent” [emphasis in original] (at [111]–[112]), the CA imposed a suspended sentence of eight months’ imprisonment. As the husband failed to take advantage of the suspension period to effect compliance with the court order, he was subsequently taken into custody to serve the sentence (at [117]).",
