        "Background facts": "2        The appellant, one\n\nSalvacion Dalayon Woon (\"Woon\"), is a Singapore citizen but a Filipino by birth.\n\nShe is 38 years old and worked as an assistant manager with Signature Employment Agency.\n\n(\"the agency\"). The complainants specified in the charge – Belen C De Vera\n\n(\"Belen\"), Mercedes J Padillo (\"Mercedes\") and Anelita S Domingo\n\n(\"Anelita\") are all Filipinos who had been recruited to work here as domestic\n\nmaids by the agency. A fourth complainant, one Marilyn Ventura Ober (\"Marilyn\")\n\nwas also initially specified in the charge but her name was subsequently deleted on\n\napplication by the prosecution.3        The four maids were\n\nrequired to pay the agency a sum of S$2,010 each as fees for arranging their employment\n\nhere. This was to be paid in instalments via deductions from their monthly pay. At the\n\ntime of the offence, each of them was still owing money to the agency in differing\n\namounts.",
        "Prosecution case": "4        The relevant events\n\nhappened on 8 August 2001. On the afternoon of that day, all four maids were at the\n\nagency, in the kitchen. Sometime in the late afternoon, a couple and their son went to the\n\nagency. They sat together with Woon and one Ruth Marie Low Chew Lo Teck\n\n(\"Ruth\"). Subsequently, an argument broke out between the couple and Woon. All\n\nfour maids came out from the kitchen to peep at the quarrel and returned to the kitchen\n\nafter it ended.5        After the quarrel, Woon\n\nwent to the kitchen and asked them if they were still willing to work in Singapore. All\n\nfour remained silent. Woon then returned to her office and called the four maids in. They\n\ncomplied. In the office also at that time were Ruth and another Filipino maid called\n\nMaryLou.6        Woon scolded the four maids\n\nfor not answering her earlier and called both Anelita’s aunt and Marilyn’s agent\n\nin the Philippines. Woon told Anelita’s aunt to prepare 70,000 pesos to pay the\n\nagency if Anelita wished to return to Philippines. Anelita was then told to speak with her\n\naunt. Similarly, she told Marilyn’s agent to prepare money. Marilyn and Belen (who\n\nhad the same agent) were told to speak with the agent.7        Woon then told the four\n\nmaids that they would have to pay 70,000 pesos to return home, or she would hire someone\n\nto kill them in the Philippines and pay him 20,000 pesos to do so. The four maids\n\ntestified that Woon was very angry when she uttered the threat. All three of the maids in\n\ncourt testified that they were very frightened and worried by the threat.8        Subsequently, Woon and Ruth\n\nleft the agency. The maids were left to spend the night there. After discussions, they\n\ndecided to escape from the agency. They sawed through the padlock on the gate and took a\n\ntaxi to the Philippine embassy. It was shortly after midnight and the embassy was closed.9        Anelita then contacted one\n\nJocelyn Bayduan (\"Jocelyn\"), a Filipino domestic maid working here, for help.\n\nJocelyn and her employer met the four maids and took them to a police station.10        Jocelyn testified under\n\ncross-examination that Anelita had told her that the agency had threatened them when she\n\nmet the four maids. At the police station, Anelita then told her about the details of the\n\nthreat, that \"the agency had asked them to pay a big sum of money, failing which\n\nthe agency would hire someone to kill them.\"",
        "Appellant’s Defence": "11        Woon made a statement P3\n\non 11 August 2001 to the Investigating Officer one M Saravanan (\"Saravanan\"). In\n\nsubsequent investigations, Woon refused to sign her s 122(6) statement taken by Saravanan\n\non 8 January 2002.12        Ruth was also called as a\n\ndefence witness. Ruth gave a statement P4 to Saravanan on 22 August 2001.13        In court, Woon testified\n\nthat on 8 August 2001, MaryLou had informed both her and Ruth that the maids were planning\n\nto escape. They had not taken this seriously.14        After the quarrel with the\n\ncouple, she had asked Ruth to call the four maids from the kitchen. This was to tell them\n\nto prepare themselves as Woon wished to bring them home so as to take them to the zoo the\n\nnext day. The maids remained silent and she asked Ruth to tell them to return to the\n\nkitchen.15        At around 6.30 pm, Woon\n\nasked Ruth to call Marilyn to the office to talk to her agent. Woon called the agent on\n\nthe telephone and asked Marilyn to speak with him. Marilyn remained silent. After that, at\n\nabout 7.29 pm, the appellant again asked Marilyn to speak to her agent. Once more, Marilyn\n\nremained silent. At this time, only Woon, Ruth, Marilyn and MaryLou were present.\n\nAccording to Woon, she then turned behind to Ruth and said\"Na(meaning Ruth),\n\nifMarilyn behaviour like this in Philippines can be killed.\"Woon further\n\nclaimed that she was crying at this time. Ruth comforted her and sent the two maids into\n\nthe kitchen.16        Ruth’s version of\n\nevents given in court was substantially similar to Woon’s.",
        "The decision below": "17        The prosecution applied to\n\nimpeach Woon and Ruth based on the inconsistent statements that they had given previously.\n\nBoth were given the opportunity to explain the inconsistencies.18        Woon claimed that she was\n\nconfused due to problems with her children at the time of the statements and also that she\n\ndid not say what had been recorded. Similarly, Ruth claimed that she had been confused at\n\nthe time of making the statement.19        The district judge\n\nrejected their explanations and found that both had had their credit impeached. She then\n\nallowed the two statements into evidence pursuant to s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap\n\n97). She accepted the maids’ evidence that Woon had threatened them, that all of them\n\nhad been in the presence of Woon when the threat was made, and also as to the details of\n\nthe threat. She found further support for this finding from the testimony of Jocelyn.",
        "The appeal against conviction": "20        The grounds of appeal\n\nconsisted of challenges to the findings of fact made below. It is trite law that the\n\nappellate court will not disturb the findings of fact of a lower court unless they are\n\nclearly reached against the weight of evidence –Lim Ah Poh v PP[1992] 1 SLR 704. An appellate court must not merely entertain doubts about whether the decision is\n\nright but must be convinced that it is wrong:PP v Azman bin Abdullah[1998] 2 SLR 704.21        Woon contended that as the\n\nfindings of the lower court arose primarily from inferences made from the content of a\n\nwitnesses’ evidence here, the appellate court was in as good a position to review the\n\nevidence and come to its own conclusions. Counsel cited my judgement inPP v Choo Thiam\n\nHock[1994] 3 SLR 248as support. In my opinion, this arose from a misunderstanding of\n\nwhat I said in that case. In bothChooandPP v Tubbs Julia Elizabeth[2001] 4 SLR 75, I had emphasised that it would only be in exceptional cases where \"logic\n\nclearly militates against findings of fact made by the trial judge\" that the\n\nappellate court would review the findings of the lower court, even when the demeanour of\n\nthe witness was not in issue in the determination of his/her credibility.22        It should be clarified\n\nthatChoodoes not lower the bar for appellate intervention. The significance of a\n\nfinding based primarily on evidence for the appellate court would only be that it is\n\nbetter equipped to conclude that the judge below was plainly wrong. The principles\n\nenunciated inLim Ah Pohand like cases must still be applied and kept foremost in\n\nthe mind of the appellate court.23        The grounds of appeal\n\ncould be broadly dealt with under the following headings:(1)    Whether the judge below had been mistaken in\n\n    her reliance on the portions of the appellant’s (P3) and Ruth’s (P4) statements\n\n    by taking them out of context24        The material portions of\n\nP3 and P4 are as set out:P3",
        "\"5.    On 8 August 2001, I had called\n\n    ‘Marilyn’ and ‘Anelita’. I told them that there": "had still owed\n\n    their respective agents money for coming to Singapore. As such, it was difficult to have\n\n    them send back. They insisted and I blew my top.I told them that I would have someone\n\n    kill them. During this conversation, ‘Mercedes’ and ‘Belen’ were\n\n    also around the office and I believe that they could have heard the threat. I wish to say\n\n    that I have no intention of carrying out the threat.\"[emphasis added]P4",
        "\"4.    On 8 August 2001, I was in the office\n\n    together with": "[the appellant],Anelita and Marilyn.[Woon]had allowed\n\n    Marilyn and Anelita to talk on the phone. Thereafter Susan and the 2 maids engaged\n\n    themselves in a conversation. During the conversation,[Woon]got angry, as both\n\n    were indecisive of wanting to work in Singapore.She told them that she would kill them.\n\n    I then advised them about their well-being and to work properly for the next employer.\n\n    They were laughing and went back to the kitchen area. During our conversation, Mercedes\n\n    and Belen were in the kitchen. I went home at about 8.00pm.\"[emphasis added]25        Woon contended that, in\n\nrelying on the highlighted portions to find that she had made the threat toall fourmaids, the judge below had erred as the context of the statements set out was that the\n\nappellant had made a threatonlyto Anelita and Marilyn.Thus, the district judge took the portions out of\n\ncontext in her reliance on them to find that the threat had been made to the four maids.26        In support, I was quoted\n\nthe guidelines laid down inChai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP[1999] 1 SLR 25at 58-59 on\n\nthe factors to consider in determining the weight of a statement admitted under s 147(3)\n\nof the Evidence Act (Cap 97). Specifically, I was referred to the following part of my\n\njudgement:Fourth,\n\n    regard should be had to the context of the statement. Subsection (6) does not restrict\n\n    consideration to only the making of the statement but requires consideration of all the\n\n    circumstances affecting its accuracy. Thus, the court must consider the context of the\n\n    inconsistent portions, which requires that the whole of the statement be examined.\n\n    Reliance cannot be placed on a portion of the statement that is taken out of context.\n\n    [emphasis added]27        I found this challenge to\n\nbe misconceived. The judge below did not rely on the statements in finding that the\n\naccused had made a threat to the maids; her reliance on them in this respect was limited\n\nto thetenor of the wordswhich the accused uttered. This was evident in 71 of\n\nher Grounds of Decision:The material portion of the accused’s statement that she had\n\n    threatened the maids by stating that she would hire someone to kill themwas consistent\n\n    with the threat which the maids had testified was made.[emphasis added]28        It was clear here that the\n\njudge below was concerned with thedetailsof what Woon had said, not whom she had\n\nsaid it to. There was clearly nothing wrong in relying on the statements in this way.\n\nWhile relying on the highlighted portions to show that a threat was made to all the maids\n\nmight have infringed the principle fromKelvin Chai, the same could not be said of\n\nreliance on it merely as evidence of what was said by the accused at the relevant time.(2)    Whether the judge below erred in her selective\n\nreliance on P3 and P429        Woon’s challenge here\n\nwas that the judge below had rejected portions of the statements inconsistent with the\n\nprosecution case without giving good reasons in coming to her findings. Specifically, they\n\npointed to her findings that all four maids were called to the office and threatened, that\n\nWoon, Anelita, Marilyn and Belen had used the telephone in the incident and that the maids\n\nhad all been alarmed by the threat.30        I found these contentions\n\nwithout merit. All the inconsistencies raised had been dealt with fully by the judge\n\nbelow. It was only in respect of the last issue that she had failed to give consideration\n\nto Ruth’s statement (P4) that the two maids were \"laughing and went back to\n\nthe kitchen area\"after the threat. In my opinion, the judge below should have\n\ngiven her reasons for rejecting this, since it related to the important issue of the\n\neffect the threat had on the maids. However, in view of her finding that:i four maids had been involved in the incident, rather than two as the\n\n    statement claimed; as well as the fact thatii there was strong evidence that the maids were scared by the threat\n\n    such as the circumstances of their escape and the evidence given by both Jocelyn and the\n\n    police officer on duty, to whom the maids had made their police report to the effect that\n\n    the maids had looked scared and worried;I found her lack of reasons to be of little consequence.(3)    Whether the judge below was correct in rejecting\n\nthe Woon’s explanation for her inconsistent statements31        Woon had tried to explain\n\nher inconsistent statement by claiming that she was confused at the time of its making.\n\nThis was due to the fact that she suspected her maid of having sexually abused her\n\ndaughter and also that her son had been injured. Woon contended that the effect of an\n\napprehended sexual assault on her daughter should have been considered by the judge below.32        In my view, the judge\n\nbelow was correct in rejecting this explanation. First, Woon had not been consistent in\n\nher explanations to the court. When she was first cross-examined on the inconsistencies,\n\nshe claimed that she was unable to recall if she had indeed said the things recorded in\n\nthe statement. On later cross-examination, she clarified that she wasonlyconfused\n\nabout 5 (reproduced above) and 9 (not relevant to the charge) of the statement.\n\nHowever, on re-examination, the appellant was suddenly able to list out in detail what she\n\nhad told to Saravanan inevery paragraph, especially with regards 5. This was\n\nalso where she alleged that the statement recorded wasnotwhat she said. The\n\nmiraculous recovery of her recollection flies plainly in the face of her alleged\n\n\"confused\" state.33        This was further\n\nreinforced by Woon claiming to have said the last sentence of 5, that she did not intend\n\nto carry out the threat, yet concurrently deny that she had said the other parts of 5.34        Secondly, Woon’s\n\nstatement was materially similar in content to Ruth’s statement. Although Ruth was\n\nalso apparently \"confused\" when she made the statement, it was certainly not for\n\nthe same serious reasons as Woon. As appropriately put by the judge below at 66 of her\n\nGrounds of Decision, it was \"…incredible that(Woon and Ruth)were\n\nconfused and ended up making the same mistake.\"35        Finally, evidence given by\n\nthe defence showed that Woon had taken her daughter to a doctor on 5 August 2001, and the\n\nresults of the doctor’s examination had been that there was no evidence of sexual\n\nabuse. In view of all the above, the judge below was clearly right to reject Woon’s\n\nexplanation.(4)    Whether the judge below erred in accepting the\n\ntestimonies of the maids given the numerous discrepancies in their evidence36        The appellant alleges that\n\nthe trial judge erred in accepting the evidence of the maids, given the numerous\n\ndiscrepancies in their testimonies in court about the events of that day and in relation\n\nto each other. These related to,inter alia, whether they all stayed in the agency\n\non 7 August 2001, the fact that they could not recall the argument between the appellant\n\nand the couple and their conflicting testimonies as to who used the telephone at the time\n\nof the offence.37        After carefully\n\nconsidering all the evidence, I was of the opinion that there was nothing wrong with the\n\nfindings of the judge below. InNg Kwee Leong v PP[1998] 2 SLR 942, the court\n\nstated clearly that immaterial discrepancies would not detract from the veracity of\n\nwitnesses on material issues. As the Chief Justice held in that case,Adequate allowance must be given to human fallibility in the precise\n\n    assessment of short spans of time.In addition, the maids’ accounts were corroborated to some extent\n\nby the testimony of Jocelyn.38        One point, however, stood\n\nout. Counsel for Woon contended that the possibility of collusion by the maids should have\n\nbeen considered by the judge below since their testimonies coincided on many material\n\naspects. While it is true that a trial judge should always be alive to the possibility of\n\nprepared testimonies by witnesses, it is surely plausible that testimonies coincide\n\nbecause the facts described within are true.39        Numerous other grounds of\n\nappeal were raised, but I found of them to be of little or no merit. Accordingly, I found\n\nno reason to disturb the district judge’s findings and dismissed the appeal against\n\nconviction.",
        "The appeal against sentence": "40        The offence of which Woon\n\nhad been convicted fell under the second limb of s 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) for\n\nbeing a threat to cause death. The maximum punishment is a term of imprisonment up to\n\nseven years or a fine or both. She had been sentenced to six month’s imprisonment,\n\nwhich was the normal tariff for an offence of this nature.41        Taking into account the\n\ncircumstances of the current case, I was of the view that the sentence meted out by the\n\njudge below was manifestly excessive.42        It bears remembering that\n\nwhile an objective view is taken of the words uttered and their effect, for the purposes\n\nof determining whether an offence under s 506 was made out and which limb it fell to be\n\npunished under, the considerations for the court in passing sentence are very different.43        In determining the\n\nappropriate sentence to be passed in offences of this nature, the court has to consider\n\ncarefully the events and circumstances surrounding its commission. The question to be\n\ndetermined is always this: to what extent can there be said to have been a serious threat\n\nmade? In determining this, both the intention of the maker of the threat as well as the\n\nfear that the victim was put indue to the threatare of great relevance:\n\nseeLee Yoke Choong v PP[1964] 1 MLJ 1964,PP v Luan Yuanxin[2002] 2 SLR 98.44        In the present case, I did\n\nnot think that there was any question that the threat was neither seriously intended to be\n\na threat to life, nor understood as such by the victims. First, it was undisputed that\n\nWoon was extremely angry when she uttered the threat. Secondly, the threat took place in\n\nthe presence of two other people – Ruth and MaryLou. Thirdly, the victims were put in\n\nno immediate fear for their lives. No weapons were used; neither did the context of the\n\nthreat itself lead to an apprehensionofimmediatehurt.45        The trial judge had\n\nherself found that \"there can be no doubt that the accused never intended to carry\n\nout the threat.\" The actual effect of the threat of death on the victims was also\n\nnot severe. While they were frightened enough to escape, all of them testified that they\n\nhad wanted to return to the Philippines after the threat was made despite their fear.46        In addition, none of them\n\nwere harmed. Woon had left them alone in the agency after the incident and, according to\n\nthe maids’ evidence, had even offered to take one of them to the zoo with her the\n\nfollowing day. The threat was also not prolonged; the maids were sent to the kitchen\n\nimmediately after Woon uttered the threat.47        A perusal of past cases\n\nshows that the present situation is distinguishable. InRamanathan Yogendran v PP[1995] 2 SLR 563, the accused solicitor had uttered the threat to kill over the telephone\n\nafter a quarrel with the victim the previous day. In reducing the sentence from a\n\nyear’s imprisonment to six months, I stated that \"athreat to kill someone\n\nwhich is made in all seriousnessis not something to be taken lightly\"[emphasis\n\nadded]. I found the present case, where the threat was uttered in anger and very obviously\n\non impulse, to be of even lesser gravity than inRamanathan, where the phone call\n\nwas clearly pre-meditated.48        InPP v N[1999] 4 SLR 619, where the accused had also threatened to kill his wife via telephone, a sentence\n\nof one years’ imprisonment was imposed. There were many aggravating factors in this\n\ncase, not least the fact that it was in the context of a violent domestic relationship\n\nwhere there was every likelihood of the threat being carried out, as well as the fact that\n\nthree other charges had been taken into consideration for sentencing. This was not the\n\nsituation here. It was the evidence of the maids that they had been well-treated by Woon\n\nprior to the incident.49        The other cases cited by\n\nthe DPP in support of the sentence passed were also distinguishable as they concerned\n\nthreats made using weapons, which were clearly aggravated.50        The context of the threat\n\nin the circumstances of the present case was unique. Woon was not a mafia boss or criminal\n\nmastermind, she was only a manager in a maid agency. While it is undoubted that the maids\n\nwere put in fear by her threat to hire a killer, the amount of fear thus induced could not\n\nhave been as great as in the cases previously discussed.51        I was also of the opinion\n\nthat part of their fear stemmed from the demand for payment Woon had made of them. This is\n\nshown by the excerpt below from Mercedes’ testimony:\"Q:    What was discussed?A:    We did plan to escapebecause of the money the\n\n    Accused is asking us to payand the threat of killing us.\"[emphasis added]In similar vein, Anelita also stated in her Examination in Chief:\"Q.\n\n        Why did you not stay at 329 Changi Road. Why did you have to get out?A.    The reason why we did not stay and thought of\n\n    escaping wasbecause we were told to pay the 70,000 pesos and we were so scaredand\n\n    that is why we did not stay and because of the threat to us.\"[emphasis added]52        Counsel for Woon argued\n\nstrenuously that the present case did not merit a custodial sentence. I disagreed. Threats\n\nto cause death, no matter how casually said, are a serious matter and are so regarded by\n\nthe court. Offences under the second limb of s 506 are invariably punished with custodial\n\nsentences because of the seriousness of these offences.53        However, having taken the\n\nfactors discussed above into account, I was of the view that a sentence of three months\n\nimprisonment would be more appropriate in this case. I therefore allowed the appeal\n\nagainst sentence and varied it accordingly.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeRepublic of SingaporeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
