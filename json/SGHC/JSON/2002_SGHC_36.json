        "Background facts": "2 The appellant, Star City operates the only licenced casino under the\n\nCasino Control Act 1992 of New South Wales, Australia. This casino is known as Star City\n\nCasino and is located in the Sydney suburb of Pyrmont. In accordance with the rules of its\n\nlicence, Star City Casino has to comply with strict credit controls supervised by the\n\nCasino Control Authority of Australia. All gaming transactions within the casino are done\n\nwith chips, other than slot machines, keno and totalisation betting. There are basically\n\nthree ways by which a patron can obtain chips for gaming in the casino. The first is by\n\nsimply exchanging cash for chips at either the counters or the gambling tables; the second\n\nwill be through a deposit account and the third is through the Cheque Cashing Facility\n\n(‘CCF’). A patron who has been granted a credit facility hands over a cheque to\n\nthe casino in exchange for a chip purchase voucher (‘CPV’) of an equivalent\n\nvalue. The CPV will then be exchanged for chips for gaming at the tables. If the patron\n\ndoes not have his personal cheques with him, he may request to make use of counter\n\ncheques, known as \"house cheques\". A house cheque is simply a document printed\n\non a format which has been pre-approved by the Casino Control Authority and is recognised\n\nby most banks in Australia. The patron after signing the house cheque hands it over to the\n\ncounter staff in exchange for a CPV and consequently chips for gaming. It is also Star\n\nCity’s standard practice that, before handing over the CPV to the patron, the casino\n\nstaff will inform the patron that his cheque, if drawn upon an account in Australia, will\n\nbe available for redemption within 10 working days after its acceptance. The patron can\n\nredeem his cheque by exchanging it with cash, bank drafts, CPV, chips or via the\n\nelectronic transfer of funds of an equivalent value. If the cheque is not redeemed within\n\nthe applicable time period, Star City will then present the cheque for payment. Without\n\nthe CCF, the patron will not be able to gamble at the casino unless he has enough cash in\n\nhand to pay for the gambling chips or has sufficient funds in his cash deposit account.3 The respondent, Mr. Tan, is a seasoned gambler and a regular patron\n\nof Star City Casino. Between February 1996 to March 1998, he visited and gambled at the\n\ncasino on at least 28 occasions and was treated by the casino as a ‘valued\n\npatron’. Mr. Tan was also granted the use of the casino’s CCF in February 1996.\n\nIn March 1998, Star City provided Mr. Tan and his wife with two complimentary air-tickets\n\nto Sydney as well as a complimentary suite at their hotel for a few days. Between 26 and\n\n28 March 1998, Mr. Tan signed and handed over to Star City five house cheques, each for\n\nthe sum of AU $ 50,000, in exchange for CPVs and promptly proceeded to lose the entire sum\n\nof AU $ 250,000. When these house cheques were presented to Mr. Tan’s bank for\n\npayment, all five were dishonoured for lack of sufficient funds in his bank account.\n\nSubsequently Mr. Tan made good to the casino AU $ 55,160, leaving the sum of AU $ 194,840\n\nunpaid. The appellants are now seeking to recover this sum as unpaid loans made to the\n\nrespondent to enable him to gamble at their casino.The decision below4 In a carefully reasoned judgment, the trial judge examined the effect\n\nwhich s 5 of the Civil Law Act has upon gaming contracts made abroad. He was of the view\n\nthat s 5(1) of the Civil Law Act which renders all contracts of gaming or wagering void,\n\nhas no extra-territorial effect and thus applies only to gaming contracts concluded in\n\nSingapore. Therefore, he held that s5(1) does not invalidate here the gaming contract\n\nwhich was concluded in New South Wales. However, s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act is a\n\nprocedural section and applies as part of thelex forito make unenforceable in\n\nSingapore all actions to recover ‘money won upon a wager’, regardless of whether\n\nor not the wager was concluded in Singapore or elsewhere and whether or not the wagering\n\ncontract, if made abroad, was lawful at the place where it was made.5 The trial judge did not accept that a claim cannot be viewed as an\n\nattempt to recover money won upon a wager merely because a cheque was exchanged for chips.\n\nWhether there is a genuine loan must depend on the circumstances in each case. He held\n\nthat, when the facts in the case were examined closely, it was evident that Mr. Tan\n\ngambled and lost the sum which Star City is seeking to recover from him. There was only\n\none contract and that was a gaming contract between the parties. Therefore whether Star\n\nCity’s claim was framed as a recovery of a loan, a claim on the dishonoured cheques\n\nor one for money had and received, the action would ultimately be characterised as one for\n\nmoney won upon a wager and was irrecoverable in the courts of Singapore.",
        "The appeal": "6 Before us, Star City contends that the trial judge erred in the\n\nfollowing main aspects:(i) in deciding that it was open to him to ‘re-characterise’\n\n  the moneys as ‘moneys won upon a wager’.(ii) that s5(2) of the Civil Law Act was procedural in nature.(iii) in not allowing Star City to claim upon the dishonoured house\n\n  cheques. Star City argues that when a cheque is issued as payment under a contract of\n\n  sale, it is treated as a distinct and separate transaction from the underlying contract.\n\n  Therefore, even if the gambling contract is unenforceable (but not void) in Singapore by\n\n  virtue of s5(2) of the Civil Law Act, the claim on the cheque is still good and\n\n  enforceable.We are of the view that the third argument can be disposed of summarily\n\nhere. It is established law that there can be no recovery on the cheque if the enforcement\n\nof the underlying contract would be against public policy or contrary to a statute that\n\nmust be applied as part of thelex fori. Therefore this third argument must stand\n\nor fall together with the first and second. We shall deal with the second issue first.First Issue: Section 5 Civil Law Act and the common law7 It may be appropriate to set out the relevant provisions of our s\n\n5(1) and (2) of the Civil Law Act which is in pari materia to s 18 Gaming Act 1845 (UK).\n\nSection 5(6) is largely similar to s 1 of the English Gaming Act of 1892. The section\n\nstates as follows:Agreements by way of gaming or wagering to be null and\n\n  void5. – (1) – All contracts or agreements, whether by parol or\n\n  in writing, by way of gaming or wagering shall be null and void.(2) No action shall be brought or maintained in the court for\n\n  recovering any sum of money or valuable thing alleged to be won upon any wager or which\n\n  has been deposited in the hands of any person to abide the event on which any wager has\n\n  been made.(3) Subsections (1) and (2) shall not be deemed to apply to any\n\n  subscription or contribution, or agreement to subscribe or contribute, for or toward any\n\n  plate, prize or sum of money to be awarded to the winners or winners of any lawful game,\n\n  sport, pastime or exercise.………..(6) Any promise, express or implied, to pay any person any sum of money\n\n  paid by him under or in respect of any contract or agreement rendered null and void by\n\n  subsections (1) and (2), or to pay any sum of money by way of commission, fee, award, or\n\n  otherwise in respect of any such contract or of any services in relation thereto or in\n\n  connection therewith, shall be null and void, and no such action shall be brought or\n\n  maintained to recover any such sum of money.",
        "The nature and effect of s5(2) Civil Law Act.": "8 Star City argues that, as a matter of principle, notwithstanding that\n\ns 5(2) of the Civil Law Act begins with the words \" no action shall be brought\",\n\nit is a substantive provision because it extinguishes a right of action by divesting it of\n\nits legal enforceability. They also referred us to an article \"Substance and\n\nProcedure – the Gaming Acts\" 23 ALJ 487 which argued that the majority decision\n\ninHill v William Hill (Park Lane)[1949] AC 530 in effect destroyed the basis for\n\nconstruing s 5(2) as procedural by assigning to it a clear and unambiguous meaning of\n\nsubstantive import. With respect, we disagree. In order to explain our conclusion, it will\n\nbe appropriate for us to examine some judicial authorities interpreting s 5(2).9 It was once thought that s 5(2) does not add anything more to s 5(1)\n\nand is a prime example of a parliamentary enactment saying the same thing twice over\n\nwithout adding anything to what has already been said. The conclusion was reached because\n\nonce a contract is rendered null and void by s 5(1) there can be nothing to recover. At\n\nbest, s 5(2) was considered as a section which confirms the consequences of the simple\n\nproposition in s 5(1) that all gaming or wagering contracts shall be null and void. The\n\nlink equating validity and the enforceability of a contract was thus made. The conclusion\n\nrequired the courts inBubb v Yelverton L.R. 9 Eq 471,In re Browne Ex parte\n\nMartingell[1904] 2 KB 133,Chapman v Franklin21 Times LR 515 andHymans v\n\nStuart King[1908] 2 KB 696 to draw a distinction between the gaming contract itself\n\nand other collateral contracts arising therefrom. These cases involved gamblers who owed\n\ndebts to creditors. In order to prevent these creditors from complaining against the\n\ngambler or to embarrass him for his unpaid debts, the gambler would often hand over to the\n\ncreditor some valuable security in the form of bills, notes or bonds. When the gambler\n\ndefaulted upon the gambling debts, the creditor would then sue upon this new contract to\n\npay. The courts allowed recovery upon the basis that there was a collateral contract\n\nbetween the creditor and debtor supported by valuable consideration when the creditor\n\nagreed not to do something to the detriment of the debtor. So while a plaintiff cannot sue\n\nfor the recovery of money won by him by betting, nor on a bill, note or cheque given to\n\npay the money lost, he can sue upon a new contract, not tainted by illegality and made for\n\ngood consideration if he can prove such a contract. The words of Buckley J. inIn re\n\nBrowne, Ex Parte Martingellsupra. summed up the judicial thinking of the day,The bills were given for an altogether new\n\n  consideration, which was not an illegal consideration. They were given not to pay the\n\n  gambling debt, but, as Lord Romilly M.R. said inBubb v Yelvertonto avoid the\n\n  consequences of not having paid it.10 However, the law has now changed. The appellant inHill v Willian\n\nHill (Park Lane)[1949] AC 530 incurred betting debts amounting to 3,935l. 12 s. 6d.\n\nThe respondents who were bookmakers obtained a decision from the committee of Tattersalls\n\nthat the appellant should pay 635l. 12s. 6d within fourteen days and discharge the balance\n\nby monthly instalments. He failed to comply and in consideration of his giving them a\n\ncheque for the amount of 635l. 12s. 6d., the respondents agreed to refrain from enforcing\n\nthe decision of the Committee which would have involved his being posted as a defaulter\n\nand warned off the races. However the cheque was subsequently dishonoured and the\n\nrespondents brought an action to recover the sum due under the agreement. The majority of\n\nthe House of Lords refused to allow the recovery of the monies. They held that the\n\npayments contracted to be made by the agreement were in essence payments of \"a sum of\n\nmoney alleged to be won upon a wager\" within the second limb of s18 of the Gaming Act\n\n1845 [our s 5(2)] and accordingly irrecoverable. Unlike s 5(1) which only renders null and\n\nvoid the original wagering or gaming contract, s 5(2) strikes down as unenforceable all\n\nother contracts to pay the sum won upon a wager. The prior position inHymans v Stuart\n\nKingwhen an artificial distinction was made between the original wagering contract\n\nand a subsequent agreement not to embarrass the gambler or to call him a defaulter was\n\noverruled. Wherever the obligation under the contract is or includes the payment of money\n\nwon upon a wager, the courts will not enforce the performance of that part of the\n\nobligation. The essence of the decision inHill v William Hill (Park Lane)was\n\ncontained in the judgment of Lord Greene at p 552,Here the language of the first branch (i.e. s5(1)) is\n\n  entirely different from the language of the second branch. Under the first branch the\n\n  agreement is a nullity before the race is run. The second branch (i.e. s5(2)) assumes the\n\n  race to have been run and the bet to have been lost. It is true that the language of the\n\n  second branch would prohibit the bringing of an action upon a wager which had been won. To\n\n  that extent I agree that it covers ground already adequately covered by the first branch.\n\n  But that is no justification for limiting the words of the second branch as suggested.\n\n  They are quite general and when read in their ordinary meaning they extend to any action\n\n  to recover money alleged to be won on a wager … I find myself in complete agreement\n\n  with what was said on this topic by Fletcher Moulton L.J. inHymans v Stuart King:\n\n  \"It provides with complete generality that no action shall be brought to recover\n\n  anything alleged to be won upon a wager, without in any way limiting the application of\n\n  the provision to the wagering contract itself.\"11Hill v William Hill (Park Lane)was not a case that was\n\nconcerned with the nature of s5(2) but rather the scope of its application. We are hence\n\nof the view that the issue of whether s5(2) is a procedural section or not must be tested\n\nby the ‘guidelines’ set down in the cases. InMonterosso Shipping Co. Ltd v\n\nInternational Transport Workers’ Federation[1982] 3 All ER 841, one of the\n\nissues that arose was the effect of one s18 of the English Trade Union and Labour\n\nRelations Act 1974 which declared that a collective agreement \"shall be conclusively\n\npresumed not to have beenintendedby the parties to be a legally enforceable\n\ncontractunless the agreement…states that the parties intend that the agreement\n\nshall be a legally enforceable contract.\" The Court of Appeal held that s18 was to be\n\nclassed as a substantive provision. Lord Denning MR said,It seems to me that the true distinction is between the\n\n  existence of a contract (which is substantive law) and the remedies for breach of it\n\n  (which is procedural law). The right course is to analyse the statute and see whether it\n\n  negatives the existence of a contract or not. If there is no contract, but the statute\n\n  says it cannot be enforced…that is procedural law. It is governed by thelex fori.\n\n  In this present case, as I construe s18 of the 1974 Act, it negatives the existence of any\n\n  contract at all.Since s 18 makes it a conclusive presumption that there is no intention\n\nto create legal relations between the parties, which is an essential element of any\n\ncontract, it is rightly construed as being a substantive provision. Words to similar\n\neffect were also used by the court inRe Shoesmith[1938] 2 KB 637 following Lush\n\nJ. inPoysers v Minors(1881) 7 QBD 329 at 333,Procedural law is a mode of proceeding by which a legal\n\n  right is enforced as distinguished from the law which gives or defines a right and which\n\n  by means of proceeding the court is to administer the machinery as distinguished from its\n\n  product.12 Therefore in every case, to determine whether a provision is\n\nsubstantive or procedural, one must look at the effect and purpose of that provision. If\n\nthe provision regulates proceedings rather than affects the existence of a legal right, it\n\nis a procedural provision. A distinction is drawn between the essential validity of a\n\nright and its enforceability. Applying this to s 5(2), it is clear that the interpretation\n\ntakenin Hill v William Hilldoes not per se render it a substantive provision.\n\nAlthough it now renders unenforceable all actions to recover sums won upon wagers, s 5(2)\n\ndoes not nullify such other actions not falling within s 5(1). The crucial words in s 5(2)\n\nare \"no action shall be brought\". Conversely the court inHill v William Hill\n\n(Park Lane)was concerned with the essence of the action to recover, thus the\n\nimportant words were ‘money won upon a wager’. It is clear to us that the\n\ndecision inHill v William Hill (Park Lane)only widens the ambit of s 5(2) but not\n\nits legal nature under private international law.13 Furthermore, the bulk of authority is that s 5(2) of the Civil Law\n\nAct is procedural. Halsbury’s Laws of England (4thedition reissue, 1996,\n\nConflict of Laws para 1081) states the position as follows:In so far as the Gaming Act 1845 [our s 5 Civil Law Act]\n\n  enacts that no suit is to be brought or maintained to recover any sum of money or valuable\n\n  thing alleged to have been won upon any wager, it is a statute affectingprocedureand\n\n  therefore no action lies in England for money upon a wager in a foreign country, even\n\n  though the wager is lawful by its proper law. (emphasis added)Dicey & Morris \"Conflicts of Laws\" also states in similar\n\nterms at para 33-436:Section 18 of the Gaming Act 1845 makes wagering\n\n  contracts null and void. It also forbids suits being brought to recover money won on\n\n  wagers. It is therefore a statute which deals both with the validity and with the\n\n  enforceability of such contracts. The validity of a foreign wagering contract is not\n\n  affected by this statute, but though valid, it cannot be sued upon in an English court.\n\n  Being part of thelex fori, the secondproceduralpart of the section\n\n  relieves the court of the duty of adjudicating on foreign wagering contracts which by the\n\n  ordinary rules of private international law would escape validation by the first part.14 Therefore the better and more widely supported view is that s 5(2)\n\nof the Civil Law Act is procedural and the appellant’s contention on this issue must\n\nbe rejected. The consequence of reaching the conclusion that s 5(2) Civil Law Act is\n\nprocedural means that our courts must apply it as part of thelex fori;lex fori\n\nad litis ordinationa. Applying this to our facts, Star City’s claim, though\n\noriginating from New South Wales, therefore becomes subject to s 5(2) Civil Law Act and is\n\nunenforceable in Singapore if it is ‘an action for recovering any sum won upon a\n\nwager’.",
        "Second Issue: Does Star City’s claim fall within s 5(2) Civil Law Act?": "15 The trilogy of cases,Quarrier v Colston1 Ph 147,Saxby v\n\nFulton[1909] 2 KB 208 andSociete Anonyme des Grands Establissments de Touquet\n\nParis – Plage v Baumgart[1927] TLR 789all stand for the proposition that an\n\naction on the loanitself will succeed if the loan is valid by its governing law.\n\nThis is in contradistinction to the other principle contained within s 5 of the Civil Law\n\nAct that a wagering contract which is valid by its governing law is valid in Singapore,\n\nbut no action lies in Singapore to recover any sum of money won on such a contract. It is\n\nclear that recovery turns upon the characterisation of the transaction in question. If\n\nthere is a loan, the first line of authorities applies whereas, if there is an action to\n\nrecover money won upon a wagering contract, s5 Civil Law Act prevails. This is reflected\n\nin Rule 199Dicey & Morrisas follows:(1) Awagering contractwhich is valid by its governing law is\n\n  valid in England, but no action lies in England to recover any money won on such a\n\n  contract.(2) A cheque drawn on an English bank and given by way of security for\n\n  money won by gaming or betting on games, or for money lent for gaming or betting, is\n\n  deemed to have been given for an illegal consideration. Hence an action in England on the\n\n  cheque will fail, unless it has been negotiated to a holder in due course.(3) But anaction on the loanitself will succeed if the loan is\n\n  valid by its governing law.The authors then go on to state the three principles flowing forthwith\n\nfrom Rule 199:(1) An English statute which makes wagering contracts void applies only\n\n  to contracts governed by English law.(2) An English statute which makes wagering contracts unenforceable,\n\n  i.e. forbids the bringing of an action on the contract, applies to all actions brought in\n\n  an English court on wagering contracts, irrespective of the law applicable to them.(3) English law governs the validity of a negotiable instrument, e.g. a\n\n  cheque payable in England but issued or negotiated by way of conditional payment of, or\n\n  security for, a debt arising from a foreign wagering contract.16 We agree with the trial judge that the proper law of the gaming\n\ncontract and transaction relating to Mr Tan’s utilisation of the CCF is the law of\n\nNew South Wales. It was an express term of the CCF application form that the agreement\n\nbetween the parties was to be governed by the laws of New South Wales. New South Wales was\n\nalso where the gambling took place and where the loan facility for placing the wager was\n\noffered and accepted. Star City argues that, having selected New South Wales as the proper\n\nlaw of the contract, Mr. Tan’s liability must be determined according to its laws.\n\nSince under New South Wales laws, a loan of AU $194,840 for the purpose of gambling had\n\nbeen advanced by Star City to Mr. Tan, this sum of money should be recoverable as a loan\n\nin Singapore. Therefore the trial judge erred in deciding that it was open to the courts\n\nof the forum to ‘re-characterise’ the moneys as \"moneys won upon a\n\nwager\".17 We are of the view that while the conflict rules assist the court in\n\ndetermining the appropriate choice of laws, they do not go further. One is still left with\n\nthe fundamental question of whether the courts of the forum are entitled to\n\nre-characterise a foreign transaction when applying a procedural statutory provision of\n\nthelex forieven before applying choice of law rules. We shall now examine some\n\ncase authorities to determine the course which this court should adopt.",
        "Relevant case authorities": "18 The case ofG & H Montage G.m.b.H. v Irvani[1990] 1 WLR\n\n667 is instructive although it deals with a different subject matter. The plaintiffs, a\n\nWest German company drew up 30 bills of exchange naming them as drawers and I.D.S., an\n\nIranian company as drawees. They were expressed to be paid to the plaintiffs’ order\n\nin London. The bills were then indorsed and signed by the defendant, the chairman of\n\nI.D.S. in Iran. The plaintiffs, as drawers then signed and sent the bills to their bank.\n\nThe words ‘bon pour aval pour les tires’ (good as a guarantee for the drawees)\n\nwere then added by the defendant to the bills. The bills were subsequently dishonoured;\n\nhowever, no notice of dishonour or protest was given or made by the plaintiffs in respect\n\nof the bills. The plaintiffs then sued the defendant on the aval for the sums due in\n\nEngland. Under the Geneva Conventions on Bills of Exchange of 1932, an aval acts like an\n\nindemnity whereby the giver of the aval is bound to make good the whole or part of the\n\namount of the bill in the same manner as the person for whom he has become guarantor. Both\n\nparties agree that the choice of law governing the bills of exchange was to be determined\n\nby reference to s72 Bills of Exchange Act 1882 (UK) as thelex fori. The issue\n\nrelevant for our purposes is whether the procedural requirements of protest and notice of\n\ndishonour in s72(3) applied to a claim on an aval. Section 72 reads:Where a bill drawn in one country is … accepted or\n\n  payable in another, the rights, duties and liabilities of the parties thereto are\n\n  determined as follows:(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the interpretation of the\n\n  …indorsement … is determined by the law of the place where such contract is\n\n  made.(3) The duties of the holder with respect to … the necessity for\n\n  or sufficiency of a protest (s51) or notice of dishonour (s48), or\n\n  otherwise, are determined by the law of the place where the act is done or the bill is\n\n  dishonoured. (emphasis added)19 Saville J. held at first instance [1988] 1 WLR 1285 and affirmed by\n\nthe Court of Appeal that, in accordance with s 72(2), the proper law governing the\n\ninterpretation of the indorsement of the bills of exchange was German law. Therefore upon\n\nthe basis of that interpretation and applying German law, the court accepted that the\n\nobligations of the defendant were to be categorised as those of a bill of exchange\n\nguarantor and not those of an indorser. The court also found that in principle s 72(3), as\n\npart of thelex fori,applied to the foreign bills of exchange as all that was\n\nrequired to bring the section into play was that the holder of the bill should bring a\n\nclaim upon it, even though the claim was of a kind which English law did not acknowledge.\n\nThe reasoning by the Court of Appeal suggests that, once it has been found that German law\n\ncharacterises the action as one upon the aval, it is no longer open to the forum when\n\napplying a procedural provision to re-characterise the action as something else. Thelex\n\nforiis to be applied upon that foreign cause of action as it is, even though it does\n\nnot exist in the forum. This is most explicit from the judgement of Woolf L. J. at p 687,Having so categorised the defendant’s liability [as\n\n  that of a giver of an aval under German law as the place where the contract was made], the\n\n  next stage is to apply section 72(3) of the Act. The result of applying section 72(3) is\n\n  that it is the requirements of English law which have to be complied with as to the giving\n\n  of notice of dishonour and the noting of protest.The application of English law does\n\n  not, however, necessitate the recategorisation of the defendant’s liability which\n\n  both under German law and Iranian law is that of a giver of an aval.(emphasis added)Purchas L. J. at p 688 also commented in a similar fashion,Subsection (3) … is concerned with the procedure to\n\n  be adopted by a holder of the bill when presenting it for acceptance or, as in this case,\n\n  for payment if the bill is dishonoured. In relation to the necessity for, or sufficiency\n\n  of, a protest or notice of dishonour or otherwise this shall be determined by the law of\n\n  the place where the act is done or the bill is dishonoured [lex fori]. So the procedure to\n\n  be adopted when unsuccessfully presenting the bill for payment is to be determined by the\n\n  law of the place where that act is to be done butthis does not have relevance to the\n\n  interpretation of liabilities arising under the supervening contracts related to the bill.(emphasis added)20 A similar approach was implicitly taken inSociete Anonyme des\n\nGrands Establisments de Touquet Paris – Plage v Baumgart.The defendant drew\n\nthree cheques on an English bank in favour of the plaintiffs who were the proprietors of a\n\ncasino at Le Touquet. The cheques were exchanged for francs in cash for gambling. The\n\ncheques were dishonoured and the plaintiffs sued upon them or alternatively for money\n\nspent. Sherman J. was satisfied on the evidence of a French avocat that the games were\n\nlawful in France, an action for money lent for the purpose of gaming at those games can be\n\nbrought in the French courts and that money so lent can be sued for in France either on\n\nany security given or on theloanitself instead of the security. Without going\n\nfurther to re-characterise the nature of the transaction under English law, the judge went\n\non to allow the recovery of the monies on the basis that they were monies lent abroad\n\nwhere gaming was lawful and recoverable.21 Conversely, there was some indication inQuarrier v Colston1\n\nPh 147 andSaxby v Fulton[1909] 2 KB 208 that it was English law as thelex\n\nforithat determined the nature of the transaction. The facts in both cases were\n\nlargely similar. Two friends were in the habit of going for holidays together. One would\n\nlend money to the other; a large part of which was used for gambling although not all.\n\nThis was known to both parties. The debtor died and the creditor sued his estate for the\n\nmonies that had been advanced. The claims were resisted by the personal representatives on\n\nthe basis this was an action for the payment of money lost at play. Lord Chancellor\n\nLyndhurst inQuarrier v Colston, on the basis that an I.O.U. was given by the\n\ntestator to the plaintiff, held that there was a loan for the purpose of gambling which\n\ncan be recovered so long as the gaming took place in a country where they were not\n\nillegal. There is suggestion that English law as thelex foriwas applied, the Lord\n\nChancellor referring several times to ‘the memorandum as prima facie evidence of the\n\ndebt’. Similarly inSaxby v Fulton, Vaughan-Williams J. felt that he was\n\nobliged by the English authority ofQuarrier v Colstonto hold that there was a\n\nloan and the loan being made for legal gambling abroad was enforceable in England.The Local Approach22 The approach of the local courts towards re-characterisation should\n\nalso be examined. InLas Vegas Hilton Corporation v Khoo Teng Hock Sunny[1997] 1 SLR 341, the plaintiff casino commenced an action against the defendant for the recovery\n\nof approximately US $1.6 M. The money was lent in this way: the defendant completed a\n\ncasino credit card, approval for the amount of credit was obtained and he could then draw\n\non the credit to gamble. Each time he drew on the credit, he had to sign a marker for the\n\nrelevant amount before the equivalent amount of gaming chips would be given to him in\n\nexchange. According to expert opinion in that case, the gaming on credit under Nevada law\n\nwas legal and each marker executed by the defendant evidenced a loan and constituted a\n\ndebt owed by the defendant to the casino enforceable under that law. This was accepted by\n\nthe High Court. The judge held that the fact that the loan, if governed by Singapore law\n\ncould be invalid and void under s 5 Civil Law Act did not mean that it, being governed by\n\nNevada law and valid under that law, may not be enforced in Singapore. In other words,\n\nhaving accepted that the credit facility extended by the casino was enforceable and valid\n\nas a loan in Nevada, it fell outside the scope of s 5(2) altogether. However, we note that\n\nthe court in that case was only concerned with the issue of enforceability of the loan. It\n\nwas not disputed by both parties that a loan had been advanced by the casino to the\n\ngambler. Therefore no arguments were raised and the court was not required to consider the\n\nissue which faces us here: whether it is entitled to re-look or re-characterise the nature\n\nof the transaction when applying s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act as thelex fori.23 The next case wasLoh Chee Song v Liew Yong Chian[1998] 2 SLR 641. The plaintiff junket’s claim against the defendant gambler was on three\n\ndishonoured cheques totalling $150,000. The defendant had obtained advances from the\n\nplaintiff for the purchase of rolling chips. The gambling was on board a ship in\n\ninternational waters, but there was no evidence as to which flag the vessel was flying. In\n\nthe absence of such evidence, the judge held that it was for the court to determine the\n\nproper law of the contract. This was Singapore law as this was the jurisdiction that was\n\nclosest and most convenient for the parties. Both were Singaporeans, the vessels were\n\nberthed in Singapore and returned to Singapore after each cruise. Judicial Commissioner\n\nChoo Han Teck held that a loan had been advanced by the plaintiff to the defendant for the\n\npurposes of gambling. He further held that the loan was recoverable, as it was not against\n\npublic interest to allow recovery of such loans. Section 5 of the Civil Law Act did not\n\nnullify loans made for the purposes of gaming or wagering. It only nullified any gaming or\n\nwagering contract and any prize won could not be recovered with the assistance of the\n\ncourt. In the words of Choo JC,The two [a loan and a wagering contract] are distinct\n\n  transactions. If A lends money to B who used it to lay a wager with C, the contract\n\n  between B and C is affected by s 6 [now s 5] but not the contract between A and B.It seems clear that Choo JC applied Singapore law as the proper law of\n\nthe contract to make an initial characterisation of the transaction as a loan and having\n\ndone so, held that it fell outside the reach of s 5 Civil Law Act. However, the case was\n\nsimilarly equivocal as to the essential issue in this present case as no foreign elements\n\nwere involved.24 We now move on to consider the recent authority of Star Cruises v\n\nOverseas Union Bank[1999] 2 SLR 412. TheStar Cruisecase involved a cheque\n\ncashing facility similar to that used by Star City. The gambler gives a cashiers’\n\norder or cheque to the casino in exchange for credit equivalent to the value of the\n\ncashiers’ order or cheque. If the gambler wins, the cheque is returned to him when\n\naccounts are settled. If the gambler loses, the casino retains the cheque and realises it\n\nto make good his loss. The judge looked at the final effect of the transaction and held it\n\nabundantly clear that the cheque or cashiers’ order represented the losses or\n\nwinnings of the gambler. When the play was over and accounts were settled, the monies that\n\nwere paid over or retained would be monies won by way of gaming; nothing more or nothing\n\nless. Therefore, although the casinos called it a loan it was actually a gambling debt,\n\nthe recovery of which was prohibited by s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act. In the words of\n\nSelvam J (as he then was),When faced with a gambling transaction, having regard to\n\n  s 9A Interpretation Act, one must take the scene in its totality and determine what the\n\n  true nature of the contract is and give effect to s 6 [now our s 5] to promote its purpose\n\n  and object.25 Further inStar Cruise, Selvam J also held that it was the\n\nlaw of the forum that decides what actions may be brought and what actions may not be\n\nbrought. If the domestic law says actions of a certain kind cannot be brought it means\n\nthat the court cannot adjudicate them irrespective of where the cause of action arose. In\n\nhis view, the courts of the forum were fully justified in applying thelex forito\n\ndiscover the reality of the gambling transaction before deciding whether an action to\n\nrecover the monies can be enforced in Singapore. He emphasised this at p 448 of the\n\njudgment:The clear and peremptory wording of s 6(1), (2) and (5)\n\n  [our s 5(1), (2) and (6)] means that the parties cannot contract out of its provisions\n\n  either expressly or impliedly by choosing some other system of law because those\n\n  provisions are based on public policy and the parties will not be permitted by agreement\n\n  to override them.Similar statements were made by the judge inSun Cruises v Overseas\n\nUnion Bank[1999] 3 SLR 404andQuek Chiau Beng v Phua Swee Pah JimmyDC 500072\n\nof 1999, RA No 600053 of 2000.26 We are aware that in bothStar CruisesandSun Cruises,\n\nthe proper law of the contract and thelex foriwas Singapore law. The coincidence\n\nof laws may make it difficult to conclude that the case is authority for the proposition\n\nthat thelex forishould be used when applying s 5(2) to re-characterize the\n\ntransaction as one that is substantially different from that under its proper foreign law.\n\nBe that as it may, we read Selvam J to be clearly of the view that forum public policy\n\ncalls for the Singapore courts, when applying s 5(2), to pierce the veil to discover the\n\nreality of the transaction.",
        "Principle and Public Policy": "27 As examined above, the cases as a whole do not clearly reveal the\n\ncharacterisation process of the courts when applying the procedural laws of the forum. The\n\nissue must ultimately depend upon the public policy of Singapore: whether our courts\n\nshould help in the enforcement of gambling contracts technically falling outside local\n\nstatutory prohibitions, but with potentially deleterious effects on the social and\n\neconomic fabric of our society.28 To begin with, it is clear that the enforcement of a right or a\n\ncause of action is a matter for the forum. Thelex foridoes not interfere in the\n\nvalidity of the transaction but as the place where the action is being brought, it has the\n\nright to determine the situations when foreign causes of action can be enforced. It is an\n\nestablished principle of private international law that the courts of the forum will not\n\nenforce a foreign cause of action that is contrary to local public policy. We need only\n\nrefer to Dicey & Morris (13 edition) at p 81:Rule 2 – English courts will not enforce or\n\n  recognise a right, power, capacity, disability, or legal relationship arising under the\n\n  law of a foreign country, if the enforcement or recognition of such right, power,\n\n  capacity, disability or legal relationship would be inconsistent with the fundamental\n\n  public policy of English law.This was also echoed by Turner J. inHope v Hope8 DM & G\n\n731,I think that, when the courts of one country are called\n\n  upon to enforce contracts entered into in another country, the question to be considered\n\n  is not merely whether the contract sought to be enforced is valid according to the laws of\n\n  the country in which it was entered into, but whether it is consistent with the laws and\n\n  policy of the country in which it is sought to be enforced. A contract may be good by the\n\n  law of another country, but if it be in breach, fraud, or evasion of the law of this\n\n  country, or contrary to its policy, the Courts of this country cannot, as I conceive, be\n\n  called upon to enforce it.29 We are of the view that in order to determine whether the\n\nenforcement of a foreign cause of action would be contrary to forum policy, the court must\n\nnecessarily apply its mind and thelex forito determine its true substance.\n\nOtherwise, the forum would no longer be master of its own home and local public policy\n\nconcerns easily circumvented by ‘forum-shopping’. There is another way to\n\nsupport this conclusion. We have earlier concluded that s 5(2) is a procedural provision\n\nwhich applies whenever foreign causes of action are being enforced in Singapore. The clear\n\nand peremptory words of s 5 of the Civil Law Act make clear that it is intended by the\n\nlegislature to be a forum mandatory provision which parties cannot avoid by contracting\n\nout of. Our courts must hence pay attention to the essence of foreign transactions and\n\nmust forcefully resist all attempts to evade the provisions of the Civil Law Act. We are\n\nfurther supported in our conclusion by s 9 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) which\n\nrequires the court, in the interpretation of a statutory provision, to prefer a purposive\n\ninterpretation which would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law\n\n(whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) to an\n\ninterpretation that would not promote that purpose or object. Putting the two principles\n\ntogether, it follows that the courts of the forum are entitled to re-characterise a\n\ntransaction according to the law and logic of thelex fori. Unlike what Star City\n\ncontends, we consider that the trial judge was, in principle, fully justified to look into\n\nthe reality of the transaction so as to determine whether s 5(2) of the Act applied. The\n\nfact that a sum of money won on a wagering contract is valid and enforceable under the\n\nlaws of New South Wales should not prevent the Singapore courts from declining to aid in\n\nits enforcement, if to do so would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore.30 What then is this aspect of local public policy that militates\n\nagainst the recovery of monies won in foreign wagering contracts which are valid and\n\nenforceable overseas? It is clear that gaming and wagering contracts were never considered\n\nto be illegal in common law. The distinction which the law makes between wagering\n\ncontracts and others is therefore entirely the creation of statute. In line with the\n\nposition in England, the Singapore legislature has long departed from the historical\n\nposition that gambling and gaming, especially when on credit, is a social vice that has to\n\nbe eradicated at all costs. It now recognises that gambling can be permitted for its\n\nentertainment value if it is strictly controlled and regulated by the relevant\n\nauthorities. Gambling per se is no longer considered to be contrary to the public interest\n\nand this accounts for the various forms of legalised gaming and gambling which currently\n\nexists in Singapore such as 4-D, Toto, The Big Sweep, The Singapore Turf club etc.\n\nTherefore there is no general principle of public policy in Singapore, against the\n\nrecovery of money lent for the purposes of gambling abroad, so long if the transaction is\n\nindeed a genuine loan and one which is valid and enforceable according to that foreign\n\nlaw.31 However, what is objectionable is courts being used by casinos to\n\nenforce gambling debts disguised in the ‘form’ of loans. Valuable court time and\n\nresources that can be better used elsewhere are wasted on the recovery of such\n\nunmeritorious claims. The machinery of the courts cannot be used indirectly to legitimise\n\nthe recovery of monies won upon wagers overseas when similar relief would be refused for\n\nmonies won upon wagers in Singapore. Hence in order to give full effect to s 5(2) of the\n\nCivil Law Act, which provides that no action can be brought or maintained to enforce\n\ngambling debts, the courts of the forum cannot be prevented by foreign law from\n\ninvestigating into the true nature of the transaction. The courts of justice must remain\n\nout of bounds to claims for monies won upon wagers, however cleverly or covertly\n\ndisguised:Star Cruises Services Ltd v Overseas Union Bank Ltd. supra. It is in\n\nthis sense that the earlier decision inLas Vegas Hilton Corporation v Khoo Teng Hock\n\nSunnysupra. can be distinguished; having felt that there is no public policy against\n\ngambling per se, the court naturally did not go further to re-characterise the\n\ntransaction. However, once it is recognised that the courts should not, as a matter of\n\nprinciple and public policy, act as gambling debt collectors for foreign casinos, we are\n\nthen obliged to investigate further according to the lex fori.32 Although this can have the unhappy consequence that Singapore may be\n\nviewed by foreign casino operators as ‘safe havens’ for gamblers with assets\n\nsituated here, the fact remains that gambling debts are debts of honour and not legal\n\ndebts recoverable in the courts. We consider that these are the risks and consequences\n\nthat casinos in the conduct of their ordinary businesses have to bear. It is but a small\n\nprice to pay in exchange for the huge profits that such businesses reap by trading in\n\ngames of chance. If a result of this case is that ‘credit’ facilities will be\n\nless readily granted to local gamblers, so be it. The courts will not be concerned with\n\nsuch considerations but must stand guided by the principle that the courts of justice must\n\nremain out of bounds to claims based on gaming debts. We emphasise that our conclusion on\n\nthe operation of s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act merely negatives the enforcement but not the\n\nvalidity of gaming contracts; the casinos can always attempt to enforce their causes of\n\naction elsewhere.",
        "What is Star City attempting to recover?": "33 Having reached the two conclusions above that, first, s 5(2) Civil\n\nLaw Act is a procedural provision which applies to all causes of action enforced in\n\nSingapore irrespective of where the gambling transactions took place and secondly, our\n\ncourts are entitled to look beyond the foreign characterisation of the transaction to\n\ndetermine its true nature as a matter of principle and policy, it now remains for us to\n\ndetermine whether Star City is claiming from Mr Tan monies won in wagers within the\n\nmeaning of s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act.34 Star City relies upon its undertaking to all patrons not to present\n\nthe cheques for ten days pending redemption of the cheque to show that there was a promise\n\nby the patron to the casino to pay sometime in the future ie a credit or loan transaction.\n\nThe casino also argues that the issue of the cheques by Mr. Tan at a time when he had\n\n\"no expectation of sufficient funds in his account\" in exchange for chips also\n\nmeant that a loan had been advanced to him by the casino. Lastly Star City says that the\n\ntrial judge erred in applyingCummings v Mackie(1973) SLT 242,Crockfords Club\n\nv Mehta[1992] 1 WLR 355,CHT Ltd. v Ward[1963] 2 QB 63,Law v Dearnley[1950] 1 KB 400, Woolf v Freeman[1937] 1 All ER 178 andMacDonald v Green[1951] 1 KB 594 because no element of private international law was involved in any of\n\nthose cases. With respect to this last point, having already expressed our view that thelex\n\nforishould be used to determine the true quality of the contract between Star City\n\nand Mr. Tan, it necessarily follows that we believe the trial judge to be perfectly\n\ncorrect in relying upon those cases to ascertain the nature of the transaction in issue.35 We now turn to consider the nature of the transaction. Several\n\nfeatures of the cheque-cashing facility that had been offered by Star City to Mr. Tan\n\nshould be noted:(i) The chips are worthless outside the casino and are mere counters.(ii) No monies were ever actually advanced by the casino. Star City\n\n  only gave the gambler the right to play at the tables upon presentation of the house\n\n  cheques.(iii) Any monies that were lost were made good by the gambler and not\n\n  Star City.36 Chips are regarded as cash in Star City casino and have to be used\n\nto gamble at the tables. Therefore a gambler patron has to exchange cash or money’s\n\nworth for the chips. We are of the view that the chips placed on the gaming tables\n\nrepresent the monies paid in advance by the gamblers to the casino by the cheques,\n\nalthough the actual transfer of funds will come later. Therefore the chips lost at the\n\ntables represented the gambling losses of the patron. He will have to make good his\n\ngambling losses to the casino and not to anyone else. Although cheques are to remain\n\nuncashed and can be redeemed upon ‘re-payment’ by gamblers within a period of\n\nten days, this is only a deferred form of payment to give gamblers time to ensure that\n\nthey have sufficient funds to repay their gambling losses in their bank accounts. The CCF\n\nfacility provided by Star City to their patrons cannot be genuine loans because the\n\nfacility merely enables them to gamble on credit and not for any other purpose.37 The converse conclusion will mean having to classify the exchange of\n\nthe cheque for the chips as a sale; for which the casino is giving loan credit on the\n\nsecurity of the cheque pending redemption and the gambling at the tables as a transaction\n\nthat is independent and unconnected to the first. This is against logic and principle:\n\nwhat would a gambler want with the chips except to use them for gambling and gambling\n\nalone? A broad view of things must be taken, and this points towards the cheques being\n\nused to pay for the gaming chips and any money to be recovered by the casinos as money\n\nwon/lost upon a wager rather than a true loan:Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd[1991] 2 AC 548. The exchange of a cheque for a CPV and chips is an essential part of the\n\ncomposite gambling contract. It is the means by which gambling is to take place rather\n\nthan a true security for credit; a ‘play now and pay later’ scheme. For the\n\nabove reasons, we agree with the trial judge that the sum of AU $194,840 was money that\n\nStar City had won from Mr Tan on a wagering contract rather than a genuine loan.38 Another subsidiary point was taken by Star City. It was this: Star\n\nCity claimed that Mr Tan had admitted that the casino had extended a loan for the purposes\n\nof gambling to him. In addition, his subsequent conduct of repaying part of the total sum\n\nowing clearly indicated his acknowledgement of the existence of such a debt. The facts in\n\nthis case were therefore indistinguishable from that ofLas Vegas HiltonCorporation\n\nv Khoo Teng Hock Sunnysupra. where the High Court allowed the recovery of the monies\n\non the basis that it was a genuine loan. We consider that there is no rational reason for\n\ndifferentiating between cases where there is an explicit admission of a loan by the\n\ngambler and where there is not. The fact that the gambler has stated that he believes that\n\nhe owes the casino monies lent to him for the purposes of gambling cannot convert what is\n\nessentially money lost in wagers into something else. The overriding test must be the\n\nessence of the transaction itself as determined by the courts of the forum. In addition,\n\nit is also obvious from the trial judge’s grounds of decision that he had found as a\n\nfact that Mr Tan’s position throughout the trial was that he had never obtained a\n\nloan from Star City.",
        "Conclusion": "39 In the premises, we agree with the trial judge that s5(2) of the\n\nCivil Law Act is a procedural section which was legislated to relieve our courts from the\n\nburden of adjudicating upon both local and foreign gambling contracts. Star City’s\n\nclaim against Mr. Tan being in essence an action to recover money lost upon a wager falls\n\nwithin s5(2) and is unenforceable in Singapore. Neither can Star City claim upon the\n\ndishonoured cheques as the recovery on the underlying gambling contract is contrary to\n\npublic policy. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.",
