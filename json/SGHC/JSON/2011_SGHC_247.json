        "Background": "2       The plaintiff and the defendant are both\n                    contractors in the business of building and construction. By a letter of award\n                    dated 12 April 2010, the plaintiff appointed the defendant to carry out\n                    various development works at MacRitchie Reservoir Park (“the\n                    site”). The defendant commenced works shortly after. 3       Disputes arose between the parties and by\n                    December 2010, the defendant had largely ceased work on the site. Nevertheless,\n                    it was not disputed that rectification works continued after that. On\n                    31 March 2011, the defendant served a document titled “Progress\n                    Claim No. 8” on the plaintiff for the sum of $672,569.97. When this\n                    sum was not paid, the defendant filed an adjudication application, SOP/AA059, on\n                    19 April 2011. An adjudicator (“the Adjudicator”) was\n                    appointed on 27 April 2011. The plaintiff served its adjudication response\n                    on 29 April 2011. 4       After considering the submissions of the\n                    parties, the Adjudicator called for an adjudication conference (“the\n                    Adjudication Conference”) on 4 May 2011. The parties were then given\n                    an opportunity to make final submissions. On 26 May 2011, the Adjudicator\n                    issued an adjudication determination (“the Adjudication\n                    Determination”), finding in favour of the defendant and ordering the\n                    plaintiff to pay the defendant the claimed sum of $672,569.97 plus interest and\n                    costs. The defendant obtained leave to enforce the Adjudication Determination on\n                    28 June 2011 by way of Originating Summons No 486 of 2011. Dissatisfied,\n                    the plaintiff took out the present application on 25 July 2011to set aside\n                    the Adjudication Determination on the following grounds: (a)     Progress Claim No. 8 was not a\n                        valid payment claim under the SOPA; (b)     even if Progress Claim No. 8 was a valid payment\n                        claim under the SOPA, it was served out of time and time-barred;\n                    and (c)     the Adjudicator\n                        breached the rules of natural justice. 5       It is worth noting that in the course of the\n                    adjudication, the plaintiff had raised the issue of the timeliness of the\n                    service of Progress Claim No. 8 only at the stage of making final\n                    submissions, after the Adjudication Conference had taken place. The issue of\n                    service was not one of the original issues agreed upon by the parties at the\n                    Adjudication Conference. As for the issue of the validity of Progress Claim\n                    No. 8 as a payment claim under the SOPA, this was never raised as an issue\n                    at any stage of the adjudication. Rather, the plaintiff had, throughout the\n                    adjudication process, sought to establish that it had, by way of a letter dated\n                    12 April 2011, served on the defendant a valid payment response under the\n                    SOPA to Progress Claim No. 8.",
        "Issues": "6       The main issues that arose in the present\n                    application are as follows: (a)     Whether Progress Claim No. 8\n                        constituted a valid payment claim (“the validity\n                        issue”); (b)     If so, whether Progress Claim No. 8 was served on time (“the\n                        service issue”); and (c)     In any event, whether there were breaches of natural\n                        justice that warranted the setting aside of the Adjudication\n                        Determination. 7       The defendant also raised a preliminary issue of\n                    whether the plaintiff was estopped from raising the validity issue and the\n                    service issue because they had not been brought up during the Adjudication\n                    Conference. I will deal with the preliminary issue before considering the other\n                    issues.",
        "The preliminary issue": "8       In my judgment, the plaintiff was not estopped\n                    from raising the validity issue and the service issue. 9       Dealing with the service issue first, I observe\n                    that the service issuewasconsidered by the\n                    Adjudicator in the Adjudication Determination as it had been raised by the\n                    plaintiff in its final submissions. I saw no reason to limit the scope of what\n                    was permissible for the plaintiff to argue in the present application to the\n                    issues agreed on at the Adjudication Conference where the Adjudicator had not so\n                    limited himself in the Adjudication Determination; the defendant provided no\n                    authorities to persuade me otherwise. There was therefore no basis for the\n                    defendant to object to the consideration of the service issue in the present\n                    application on the ground of estoppel. 10     This, however, could not be said of the\n                    validity issue, which did not arise in any form throughout the entire\n                    adjudication process. Nevertheless, the plaintiff argued that the fact that the\n                    validity issue did not arise in the adjudication process was no bar to it being\n                    raised before a court, because the validity issue went to the jurisdiction of\n                    the adjudicator. 11     The plaintiff relied onChip HupHup Kee v Ssangyong Engineering\n                        & Construction[2010] 1 SLR 658 (“Chip Hup”) at [44], where Judith Prakash J stated: ...if the tribunal concerned does not have [jurisdiction in the strict\n                        sense of capacity to hear],any party to the dispute may\n                            assert the lack of jurisdiction at any stage and can never be held to be\n                            estopped from doing so or to have waived its right of\n                        protest. [emphasis added] The plaintiff recognised that Prakash J concluded (at [59] ofChip Hup) that the adjudicator possessed\n                    jurisdiction to hear and determine the adjudication application filed by the\n                    claimantas soon as he accepted the appointment made by the\n                        Singapore Mediation Centre, but submitted that in the light of\n                    subsequent decisions of the High Court, the validity issue should be taken to be\n                    a jurisdictional one. 12     Before exploring this matter further, I note\n                    at this juncture that the service issue appears to have been recognised as a\n                    jurisdictional issue the determination of which may lead to the setting aside of\n                    an adjudication determination (see Prakash J’s decision inSEF Construction Pte Ltd v Skoy Connected Pte Ltd[2010]\n                    1 SLR 733 (“SEF\n                    Construction”) at [45(b)]; Lee Seiu Kin J’s decision inSungdo Engineering & Construction (S) Pte Ltd v\n                        Italcor Pte Ltd[2010] 3 SLR 459 (“Sungdo”) at [32]; and Tay Yong Kwang J’s decision inChua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt Construction\n                        Engineering) v Lee Wee Lick Terence (alias Li Weili Terence)[2011] SGHC 109 (“Chua Say\n                    Eng”) at [29]). 13     The validity issue presents more difficulty as\n                    the judgments of the High Court do not speak with one voice on the matter. To\n                    provide a brief overview of these positions, I can do no better than quote Tay\n                    J’s summary of the law inChua Say Engat\n                        [13]–[21], describing the developments afterChip Hup: 13     About two\n                            months after her decision inChip Hup,\n                            Prakash J set out her views in [SEF\n                                Construction] on the court’s role when asked to set\n                            aside an adjudication determination or a judgment arising from the same.\n                            She said at [42]: 42     Accordingly, instead of reviewing the\n                            merits (in any direct or indirect fashion),it is my\n                                view that the court's role must be limited to supervising the\n                                appointment and conduct of the adjudicator to ensure that the\n                                statutory provisions governing such appointment and conduct are\n                                adhered to and that the process of the adjudication, rather than the\n                                substance, is proper. After all, in any case, even if the\n                            adjudicator does make an error of fact or law in arriving at his\n                            adjudication determination, such error can be rectified or compensated\n                            for in subsequent arbitration or court proceedings initiated in\n                            accordance with the contract between the claimant and the respondent and\n                            intended to resolve all contractual disputes that have arisen. [emphasis added] 14     To further elucidate the\n                        limits of the court’s role, Prakash J had regard to the New South\n                        Wales Court of Appeal (“NSW CA”) case ofBrodyn Pty Ltd v Davenport[2004] NSWCA 394\n                            (“Brodyn”). InBrodyn, Hodgson JA first stated (at [51]) that the\n                        scheme of the equivalent New South Wales Act (“the NSW Act”)\n                        “appears strongly against the availability of judicial review on the\n                        basis of non-jurisdictional error of law.” The judge went on (at\n                        [53]) to consider what the conditions for the existence of an\n                        adjudicator’s determination were: The basic and essential requirements appear to include the\n                            following: 1. The existence of a construction contract between the claimant and\n                            the respondent, to which the Act applies (ss 7 and 8). 2.The service by the\n                                claimant on the respondent of a payment claim\n                            (s 13). 3. The making of an adjudication application by the claimant to an\n                            authorised nominating authority (s 17). 4. The reference of the application to an eligible adjudicator, who\n                            accepts the application (ss 18 and 19). 5. The determination by the adjudicator of this application\n                            (ss 19(2) and 21(5)), by determining the amount of the progress\n                            payment, the date on which it becomes or became due and the rate of\n                            interest payable (ss 22(1)) and the issue of a determination in\n                            writing (ss 22(3)(a)).\" [emphasis added] As for more detailed statutory requirements of the NSW Act such as\n                        “section 13(2) as to the content of payment claims; section 17\n                        as to the time when an adjudication application can be made and as to its\n                        contents”, Hodgson JA disapproved of the approach which asked\n                        “whether an error by the adjudicator in determining whether any of\n                        these requirements is satisfied is a jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional\n                        error” as he thought that approach “tended to cast the net too\n                        widely”. He preferred to ask “whether a requirement being\n                        considered was intended by the legislature to be an essential pre-condition\n                        for the existence of an adjudicator's determination.” (seeBrodynat [54]) 15     At [44] and [45] ofSEF Construction, Prakash J adopted\n                        Hodgson JA’s discussion on the basic and essential requirements\n                        ... 16    Although sub-paragraph (b) of [45] inSEF Construction… included the service\n                            by the claimant on the respondent of a payment claim, Prakash J\n                            made clear at [46] ofSEF Constructionthat whether a purported payment claim was actually a payment claim\n                            under the SOPA was an issue for the adjudicator ... 17     Prakash J next decided\n                        the case ofAM Associates (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Laguna\n                            National Golf and Country Club Ltd[2009] SGHC 260\n                            (“AM Associates”), in which\n                        she applied her holdings inSEF Construction.\n                        The respondent in the adjudication proceedings there applied to set aside\n                        the adjudication determination on the basis that the payment claim it was\n                        served with (“Payment Claim 1”) was not a valid payment claim\n                        under the SOPA. Prakash J held (at [20]): ... It was not my place to determine whether Payment Claim 1 was\n                            a valid payment claim or not. This was an enquiry that fell squarely\n                            within the jurisdiction of the Adjudicator and it is one that he\n                            recognised and dealt with.What the court would be\n                                concerned with is whether prior to making an adjudication\n                                application the claimant had served a purported payment\n                                claim. In this case, Payment Claim 1 had been served\n                            by AMA andwhether it was actually a “payment\n                                claim” within the meaning of that term under the SOP Act, was\n                                a mixed question of law and fact for the Adjudicator, who\n                            would be privy to the facts,to\n                            decide. [emphasis added] Sungdo Engineering 18     Shortly after theAM\n                            Associatesdecision, Lee Seiu Kin J\n                        (“Lee J”) decided the case of [Sungdo]. … … 20     Significantly, Lee J\n                        disagreed with Prakash J’s statements at [56] of [Chip Hup] …, stating (at [32]) that: ... While I agree that the jurisdiction of the adjudicator is not\n                            vested until his appointment by an ANB (“authorised nominating\n                            body”),I am, with respect, unable to agree\n                                that jurisdiction is not affected by an invalid Payment Claim or\n                                service thereof. The power of the ANB to appoint an\n                            adjudicator arises from the receipt of an adjudication application from\n                            a claimant, and that is predicated by a whole chain of events initiated\n                            by the service of a Payment Claim by the claimant on the respondent\n                            under s 10 of the Act. It must follow that if the claimant had\n                            failed to serve a Payment Claim, or to serve something that constitutes\n                            a Payment Claim, the power to appoint an adjudicator for that particular\n                            claim has not arisen. [emphasis added] As for Prakash J’s view at [46] ofSEF\n                            Construction(see[16]above) that whether or not a purported payment claim is actually a payment\n                        claim under the SOPA is an issue for the adjudicator and not the court,\n                        Lee J went on to say at [34]\n                        that ... In principle, if the validity of a Payment Claim goes to\n                            jurisdiction, I do not see how a court is precluded from examining this\n                            issue on judicial review and I would, with respect, disagree with\n                            this. 21     Lee J then distinguishedSEF Constructionon the basis that in any event, the\n                        2008 Letter did notpurportto be a payment\n                        claim under the SOPA as nothing therein stated that it was so. Finally,\n                        notwithstanding Lee J’s disagreement in principle with Prakash J,\n                        he stated that in practice, where a document did purport to be a payment\n                        claim under the SOPA, the court should only review an adjudicator’s\n                        decision that it was indeed a valid payment claim under the SOPA on the\n                        basis ofWednesburyunreasonableness (seeAssociated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v\n                            Wednesbury Corporation[1948]\n                        1 KB 223)… 14     In short, although Prakash J has,inter alia, inSEF\n                        Constructiontaken the position that the validity issue is an\n                    issue for the adjudicator and not for the court, implying that it is not a\n                    matter for the court’s consideration in a setting aside application, Lee J\n                    had respectfully disagreed inSungdo, concluding\n                    that the court may review an adjudicator’s decision on the validity issue\n                    and that where a document purports to be a payment claim under the SOPA, the\n                    court may conduct its review on the basis ofWednesburyunreasonableness. 15     Tay J inChua Say\n                        Eng(at [28]) agreed with\n                    the position taken by Lee J, having regard to the New South Wales Court of\n                    Appeal decision ofChase Oyster Bar v Hamo\n                        Industries[2010] NSWCA 190. That case was decided afterSEF Construction, and had departed from the\n                    position inBrodyn Pty Ltd v Davenport[2004]\n                    NSWCA (which was followed inSEF Construction) to\n                    favour a less restrictive approach towards the question of what constitutes a\n                    jurisdictional issue in the context of an application to set aside an\n                    adjudication determination. 16     It appears then, at present, that the weight\n                    of authority reflects an approach where the failures to comply with the\n                    specifications of time and other requirements laid down in the SOPA become open\n                    to the court’s scrutiny on the basis that the parties’ rights to\n                    avail themselves of the unique mechanism provided by the SOPA depended on strict\n                    compliance with it. However, where an adjudicator had previously considered such\n                    jurisdictional issues, then consistent with the aim of the SOPA to\n                    “[maintain] cash flow in the [construction] industry” by providing\n                    “a fast track procedure for an interim decision in respect of a disputed\n                    payment claim” (perPrakash J inChip Hupat [57]), an adjudicator’s determination\n                    ought not to be reviewed too extensively. InSungdoandChua Say Eng, the\n                    threshold for review has been pegged at the standard ofWednesburyunreasonableness. In particular, with respect to the\n                    validity issue, the key question for the court to determine would be whether a\n                    purported payment claim had been made according to the rules established inSungdoandChua Say\n                        Eng. Although in the present case the validity issue had not\n                    arisen for consideration by the Adjudicator, it was not disputed by the\n                    plaintiff and defendant that the reasoning inSungdoandChua Say Engremained\n                    relevant. 17     I therefore proceed to consider the substance\n                    of the plaintiff’s claims in respect of both the service issue and the\n                    validity issue.",
        "Whether Progress Claim No. 8 constituted a valid payment\n                claim": "18     The plaintiff argued that Progress Claim\n                    No. 8 was not a valid payment claim for the following reasons: (a)     it was not intended by the defendant\n                        as a payment claim under the SOPA, and even if it did, such intention was\n                        not communicated to the plaintiff; (b)     it was made in breach of reg 5(1) of the Building and\n                        Construction Industry Security of Payment Regulations 2005 (Cap 30B,\n                        Reg 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the SOP Regulations”) as two\n                        payment claims had been served in the month of March 2011;\n                    and (c)     it was made in\n                        breach of s 10(1) of the SOPA as the defendant had served more than one\n                        payment claim for a progress payment.",
        "Whether Progress Claim No. 8 was intended as a payment claim\n                under the SOPA and if so, whether such intention was communicated": "19     The plaintiff’s first argument was a\n                    factual one. According to the plaintiff, its usual course of dealings with the\n                    defendant was such that a payment claim would only be made by the defendant\n                    after the plaintiff had issued an interim certification of the value of the\n                    works done by the defendant. The defendant’s unilateral issuance of\n                    Progress Claim No. 8 was not in line with this usual practice.\n                    Additionally, the plaintiff also argued that after the works had ceased in\n                    December 2010, the defendant began haphazardly submitting various progress\n                    claims, sometimes two times in the same month and differing in format and style.\n                    In this context, it could not be said that the intention to make a payment claim\n                    via Progress Claim No. 8 had been communicated to the plaintiff. Further,\n                    the cover letter enclosing Progress Claim No. 8 stated that it was\n                    submitted “for work done ending up to 25thMarch 2011 for your kind certification”. The plaintiff also relied on an\n                    alleged admission in an affidavit made on behalf of the defendant where a\n                    director of the defendant had stated that “Progress Claim No. 8 wassimply a progress claim asking for\n                    payment” [emphasis added] to argue that it was not intended as\n                    a payment claim under the SOPA. 20     Counsel for the defendant emphasised that the\n                    plaintiff had not challenged the validity of Progress Claim No. 8 as a\n                    payment claim under the SOPA until the present application, despite being\n                    represented by counsel throughout. It also relied onSungdo(at [17]) for the\n                    proposition that “there is no requirement for a payment claim to\n                    expressly state that it is made under the SOPA for it to be a valid payment\n                    claim under [the SOPA]”. 21     I was not persuaded by the plaintiff’s\n                    arguments and set out the material parts of the cover letter to Progress Claim\n                    No. 8 for ease of reference: Attn: Ms Samantha Ng / Mr Oh Kim Guan /Mr William\n                        Neo PROPOSED REDEVELOPMENT TO MACRITCHIE RESERVOIR PARK\n                            PHASE 2 CONTRACT NO: CW-DD/3090216 SUBJECT : SUBMISSION OF PROGRESS CLAIM\n                        NO.8 Dear Sir/Madam, With reference to the abovementioned, we are pleased to submit herewith\n                        theProgress Claim No.8for workdone ending up\n                        to 25thMarch 2011 for your kind\n                        certification.

Detailed Breakdown and AttachmentsAcknowledgement of Receipt of the Claim[signed]SignatureHR [handwritten]Name / Position31/3 [handwritten]Date22     First, it was apparent that Progress Claim\n                    No. 8, was “a business-like document” and from its contents,\n                    it was apparent that it was claiming that a sum of money was due (seeChua Say Engat [31]). Although a sentence in the cover letter had referred to\n                    work done for the plaintiff’s “certification”, it must have\n                    been evident to the plaintiff that payment was sought from the rest of the\n                    document, for example, in the penultimate sentence “[w]e trust that the\n                    aforesaid claim is in order and look forward to your prompt payment”. The\n                    reference to “certification” was also consistent with the dealings\n                    between the parties described by the plaintiff where the whole purpose of\n                    certification by the plaintiff was so that the defendant could obtain payment\n                    for work done. The plaintiff’s argument taken to its logical conclusion\n                    would mean that due to the earlier course of dealings between the parties, the\n                    defendant would be barred from making any claims for payment unless the\n                    plaintiff had on its own initiative certified payments as being due. This was\n                    not commercially sensible.23     Second, as established inSungdo(at [17]), it was\n                    not necessary for the payment claim to state expressly that it was made under\n                    the SOPA, although this would have been the clearest way to communicate such an\n                    intention. The only formal requirements for validity under the SOPA are found in\n                    s 10(3) and reg 5(2) of the SOP Regulations that provide for every payment\n                    claim to be in writing, to identify the relevant contract and contain details of\n                    the claimed amount (seeChua Say Engat [38]). It is not disputed that any of these\n                    formal requirements have not been met in respect of Progress Claim\n                    No. 8.24     Third, an important factor was that the\n                    plaintiff had by seeking to prove that it had made a valid payment response in\n                    the course of the adjudication whilst not taking any issue with the validity of\n                    the payment claim, apparently understood at the material time that Progress\n                    Claim No. 8 was intended as a payment claim under the SOPA. In this\n                    context, counsel for the plaintiff’s argument that the plaintiff had been\n                    “ambushed” by Progress Claim No. 8, which was\n                    “disguised” as a valid payment claim, rang hollow. It was apparent\n                    from the plaintiff’s arguments in the adjudication that it had treated\n                    Progress Claim No. 8 as a payment claim under the SOPA.25     Fourth, although it was true that previous\n                    progress claims had been made where non-payment was not followed with an\n                    adjudication application, including: (a) a $464,412.20 “Progress Claim for Work Done Up to:31/Dec/2010” on 17 January 2011; (b) a $502,755.53 “Progress\n                    Claim For Work Done Up To: 25/Dec/2010” on a subsequent unstated date;\n                    and (c) a $395,755.53 tax invoice “Being 7thProgress Claim” on 10 March 2011, this was but one factor and\n                    considering all the circumstances of the case, would not lead me to conclude\n                    that Progress Claim No. 8 was not intended as a payment claim under the\n                    SOPA. Further, these earlier claim documents were of a different nature from\n                    Progress Claim No. 8, which was accompanied by a formal cover letter, with\n                    provision for the plaintiff to sign as “Acknowledgement of Receipt of the\n                    Claim”. I also did not think that the statement in the affidavit made on\n                    behalf of the defendant, read in context, could be treated as an admission that\n                    the defendant did not intend Progress Claim No. 8 to be a payment claim\n                    under the SOPA.26     InSungdo, Lee J\n                    came to the conclusion that the payment claim in question was not a valid\n                    payment claim under the SOPA for five reasons: (a) the defendant did not\n                    communicate its intention to the plaintiff that it was a payment claim under the\n                    SOPA (there was no mention in the covering letter of a claim being made under\n                    the SOPA or any other communication that would alert the plaintiff of the nature\n                    of the document); (b)the plaintiff did not treat it as a\n                        payment claim(no payment response was provided); (c) events\n                    prior to the service of the letter suggested that it was not a payment claim\n                    (there were previous instances where invoices had been submitted but no\n                    adjudication application followed,a writ was filed in court\n                        and parties had filed pleadings before the alleged payment claim was\n                        sent); (d) the contents of the covering letter did not suggest it\n                    was a payment claim dueinter alia, to itsinformality(the alleged payment claim was\n                    titled “Letter from Italcor to Sungdo”, contained a festive\n                    greeting, the person signing the letter was not identified, and the date was\n                    handwritten); and (e) it wasagainst public policyto leave scope for potential claimants to ambush respondents by making multiple\n                    submissions of documents and applying for adjudication the minute the respondent\n                    failed to provide a payment responseeven after litigation\n                        had been commenced. I have set out these reasons in some detail\n                    to illustrate the unusual circumstances present inSungdo. Based on the facts I have enumerated above (at[21]–[25]), the present case was evidently quite different fromSungdo.Whether Progress Claim No. 8 was made in breach of reg 5(1) of\n                the SOP Regulations27     It is not disputed that reg 5(1) of the SOP\n                    Regulations applied in the present case and provided as follows:5.—(1)  Where a contract\n                        does not contain any provision specifying the time at which a payment claim\n                        shall be served or by which such time may be determined, then a payment\n                        claim made under the contract shall be served by the last day of each month\n                        following the month in which the contract is made.28     The plaintiff argued that relying on Tay\n                    J’s analysis inChua Say Engand on a\n                    literal interpretation of reg 5(1), only one payment claim may be served each\n                    month by the last day of each month. It argued that the document titled\n                    “TAX INVOICE” dated 10 March 2011 and described as\n                    “Being 7thProgress Claim” and\n                    containing a breakdown of the “Total Work Done As At 25/12/2010”\n                    (“the 10 March 2011 document”) (referred to at[25]above) was a purported payment claim and\n                    there were therefore two purported payment claims in March 2011. This was not\n                    permissible under reg 5(1).29     Without going into the correctness of the\n                    plaintiff’s interpretation of the law, this argument hinged on the\n                    10 March 2011 document being a payment claim or at least a purported\n                    payment claim under the SOPA. I find that this could not be the case as the\n                    10 March 2011 failed to comply with reg 5(2)(c) of the SOP Regulations, which required a payment claim to\n                    contain details of the claimed amount, including:(i) a breakdown of the items constituting the claimed amount;(ii) a description of these items;(iii) the quantity or quantum of each item; and(iv) the calculations which show how the claimed amount is derived30     The only calculation contained in the\n                    10 March 2011 document was:ItemDescriptionQuantityUnit\n                                    PriceAmount1)Total Work Done As At\n                                            25/12/2010$1,028,388.29Add: Variation\n                                        Order$97,766.59Total$1,126,154.88Less: 10%\n                                        Retention$\n                                        (112,615.49)Net\n                                    Amount:$1,013,539.39Less: Profit\n                                            Entitlement$\n                                    (65,880.06)Sub-Total$947,659.93Less : Previous Payment\n                                                (1stto\n                                                5th)$\n                                        (477,794.35)This\n                                    Claim$469,864.98Add 7%\n                                    GST$32,890.55Total Amount Included\n                                            GST$502,755.53Less : 6th Claim Yet to\n                                            Received – WSH/008/11$\n                                        (107,000.00)Total Amount Including GST\n                                            [handwritten]$395,755.53There was no breakdown of the work done or a particularisation of the\n                    description, quantity, quantum or the unit price of each item of work. Unlike\n                    Progress Claim No. 8, such a detailed breakdown was also not attached. The\n                    10 March 2011 could not therefore be a payment claim under the\n                SOPA.31     I would also add that apart from failing to\n                    meet the formal requirements for validity under the SOP Regulations, it was\n                    clear to me that the 10 March 2011 document could not have been apurportedpayment claim under the SOPA,ie, it could not have been intended as a payment claim\n                    under the SOPA (seeSungdoat [20]). It took the form of an unremarkable tax\n                    invoice and it was marked “Attn: Account Department”, without any\n                    specific person’s attention being drawn to it. It was signed by an\n                    “Authorized Signature” who was not identified and contained the\n                    handwritten words “Total Amount including GST”, reflecting a\n                    certain degree of informality. There was additionally no attempt made whatsoever\n                    to describe and quantify the work done as evident from the lack of content in\n                    the columns “Quantity” and “Unit Price”. These facts\n                    did not suggest any sort of intention for the 10 March 2011 to be treated\n                    as a payment claim under the SOPA.32     I therefore find that Progress Claim\n                    No. 8 was not in breach of reg 5(1) of the SOP Regulations.Whether Progress Claim No. 8 was made in breach of s 10(1)\n                of the SOPA33     Section 10(1) of the SOPA provides as\n                    follows:10.—(1)  A\n                        claimant may serve one payment claim in respect of a progress payment\n                        on —(a) one or more other persons who, under\n                            the contract concerned, is or may be liable to make the payment;\n                            or(b) such other person as specified in or\n                            identified in accordance with the terms of the contract for this\n                            purpose.34     “Progress payment” is in turn\n                    defined by 2 of the SOPA to mean:... a payment to which a person is entitled for the carrying\n                        out of construction work, or the supply of goods or services, under a\n                        contract, and includes —(a) a single or one-off payment;\n                            or(b) a payment that is based on an event\n                            or a date;35     The plaintiff argued that because works had\n                    ceased at the site by December 2010 with only rectification works carrying on\n                    thereafter, Progress Claim No. 8 although expressed as being for work done\n                    “up to 25thMarch 2011”, was actually\n                    for work done up to 31 December 2010. As the Defendant had previously\n                    submitted other progress claims for work in that period, (see above at[25]) a further claim for progress payment for\n                    works done up to December 2010 could not be made because this would be in breach\n                    of s 10(1) of the SOPA, which only allowed “onepayment claim in respect ofaprogress payment” [emphasis added].36     This argument hinged on the proposition that\n                    rectification works were not works in respect of which a progress claim could be\n                    made. When questioned, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that rectification\n                    works were not “construction work, or the supply of goods or\n                    services” under s 2 of the SOPA that would entitle the defendant to\n                    a progress payment because rectification works would be paid for out of the\n                    retention monies held back by the plaintiff. However, there was no provision in\n                    the contract between the parties to that effect, neither was there any other\n                    evidence on the practices of the construction industry that could establish such\n                    a proposition. In any event, I observe that excluding rectification works from\n                    the concept of “construction work, or the supply of goods or\n                    services” which would entitle a claimant to a progress payment, would be\n                    contrary to s 3 of the SOPA, which defined “construction\n                    work”, “goods” and “services” in a manner\n                    that could not on a reasonable interpretation be read as excluding rectification\n                    works.37     I therefore rejected the plaintiff’s\n                    argument that Progress Claim No. 8 was in breach of s 10(1) of the\n                    SOPA and consequently decided against the plaintiff in respect of the validity\n                    issue.Whether Progress Claim No. 8 was served on time38     The second challenge brought by the plaintiff\n                    to set aside the Adjudication Determination was the service issue. The plaintiff\n                    argued that because all the works under the contract it had with the defendant\n                    had ceased by December 2010 and only rectification works were carried out after\n                    December 2010, in accordance with the interpretation of s 10(2) of the SOPA\n                    and reg 5(1) of the SOP Regulations given by Tay J inChua\n                        Say Eng, Progress Claim No. 8 was served out of time as it\n                    should have been served by 31 January 2011.39     The defendant argued that the Adjudicator had\n                    ample opportunity to consider the service issue and came to the conclusion that\n                    because the contract continued between the plaintiff and the defendant at the\n                    material time, with the defendant continuing to carry out rectification works as\n                    well as payment negotiations with the plaintiff well into February 2011,\n                    Progress Claim No. 8 was served on time (by 31 March 2011), regardless\n                    of which interpretation of s 10(2) of the SOPA and reg 5(1) of the SOP\n                    Regulations was adopted. There was therefore no reason to challenge the\n                    Adjudicator’s decision as being unreasonable on aWednesburybasis. The defendant also sought to distinguishChua Say Engon the basis that this was a case\n                    where the defendant was entitled to claim not only the additional sums due for\n                    further works that were completed in March 2011, but also for all monies\n                    previously unpaid at that point under s 10(4) of the SOPA.40     Suffice it to say, and for the reasons stated\n                    in[36]above, I saw no reason to disagree\n                    with the Adjudicator.Whether there were breaches of natural justice that warranted the\n                setting aside of the Adjudication Determination41     Under s 16(3)(c) of the SOPA, an adjudicator is obliged to “comply with\n                    the principles of natural justice.42     The breach of natural justice complained of by\n                    the plaintiff was essentially that the Adjudicator had, in the Adjudication\n                    Determination, referred to other unpublished adjudication determinations known\n                    to the Adjudicator and that were not cited by the parties. The plaintiff\n                    complained that by failing to allow it an opportunity to address the Adjudicator\n                    on these other adjudication determinations, the Adjudicator had acted in breach\n                    of the natural justice principleaudialterampartem.

In any event, the\n                    defendant also submitted that no prejudice was caused to the plaintiff as it was\n                    clear from the Adjudication Determination that the references to the previous\n                    adjudication determinations did not materially affect the Adjudicator’s\n                    conclusions. The defendant relied on the summary of principles inSoh Beng Teeat [65], which was a case decided in\n                    relation to an arbitration award, particularly for the statement that “an\n                    award should be read generously such that only meaningful breaches of the rules\n                    of natural justice that have actually caused prejudice are ultimately\n                    remedied”.44     It is first important to recognise that what\n                    is required by natural justice depends heavily on the context in which it\n                    operates. Prakash J inSEF Constructionat [52]\n                    endorsed the views expressed by Assistant Registrar Lim Jian Yi inChip HupHup Kee Construction Pte Ltd\n                        v Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co Ltd[2008] SGHC 159 at [50] as follows:Justice, whether performed by a court, a tribunal or any quasi-judicial\n                        body, is a balancing exercise between thoroughness and timeliness. More\n                        formal settings, such as litigation through a court, would tend to emphasis\n                        the former. The adjudication process under the [SOPA] instead chooses a\n                        quicker, but somewhat less thorough, means of achieving justice. This is a\n                        general theme which pervades the [SOPA] and in itself is not a ground for\n                        saying that natural justice has been denied.45     The Court of Appeal inSoh\n                        Beng Teealso recognised at [65(b)] that fairness was “a\n                    multidimensional concept and it would be unfair to the successful party if it\n                    were deprived of the fruits of its labour as a result of a dissatisfied party\n                    raising a multitude of arid technical challenges”. The “overriding\n                    burden [was] on the applicant to show that a reasonable litigant in his shoes\n                    could not have foreseen the possibility of reasoning of the type revealed in the\n                    award” (Soh Beng Teeat [65(d)]). This was\n                    a question of fact and degree to be determined in the individual case (Rotoairaat 162). Although said in the context of\n                    examining an arbitration award, these principles are equally applicable\n                    here.46     In the present case, it was not disputed that\n                    the Adjudicator had in the Adjudication Determination made various references to\n                    other adjudication determinations that the parties had not cited to him. To that\n                    extent, he had caused surprise. However, this should not in itself lead to the\n                    setting aside of the Adjudication Determination, particularly where these\n                    unpublished adjudication determinations, when read in context, served merely as\n                    examples and illustrations and could not have affected the outcome of the case.\n                    In respect of the reference to AA SOP No 62 of 2011, which the oral and written\n                    submission of the plaintiff focussed on, the Adjudicator had clearly indicated\n                    that he would not be relying on the interpretation of the SOPA and the SOP\n                    Regulations contained in that case but regardedChua Say\n                        Engas authoritative. He had also stated that whether he followed\n                    the interpretation in AA SOP No 62 of 2011 or that inChua\n                        Say Eng, the same result would follow as his decision on the\n                    service issue rested on a factual determination that the contract between the\n                    plaintiff and the defendant continued into February 2011.47     It was true that the parties were not invited\n                    to address the specific adjudication determinations cited by the Adjudicator,\n                    but it could not be denied that they had ample opportunity to address theissuesin question whether at the Adjudication\n                    Conference or through the various rounds of submissions submitted to the\n                    Adjudicator. It cannot be said that a reasonable litigant in the shoes of the\n                    plaintiff could not have foreseen the possibility ofreasoning of the type revealed in the awardmerely because the\n                    particular examples and references provided by the Adjudicator were not\n                    previously known to it.48     In my judgment, the Adjudicator had complied\n                    with theaudialterampartemprinciple. The Adjudicator\n                    had made known his concerns on the (contentious) service issue, and had invited\n                    parties to address him onChua Say Engand the\n                    first instance decision ofChua Say Eng (formerly trading as\n                        Weng Fatt Construction Engineering) v Lee Wee Lick Terence @ Li Weili\n                        Terence[2010] SGHC 333, and they had done so. Although\n                    his decision on the service issue did not accept either the plaintiff’s or\n                    the defendant’s submission in their entirety, he was not required or\n                    obliged to do so (seeRotoairaat 463;Soh Beng Teeat [65(e)]).Conclusion49     For the above reasons, I dismissed the setting\n                    aside application.",
        "Whether Progress Claim No. 8 was made in breach of reg 5(1) of\n                the SOP Regulations": "27     It is not disputed that reg 5(1) of the SOP\n                    Regulations applied in the present case and provided as follows: 5.—(1)  Where a contract\n                        does not contain any provision specifying the time at which a payment claim\n                        shall be served or by which such time may be determined, then a payment\n                        claim made under the contract shall be served by the last day of each month\n                        following the month in which the contract is made. 28     The plaintiff argued that relying on Tay\n                    J’s analysis inChua Say Engand on a\n                    literal interpretation of reg 5(1), only one payment claim may be served each\n                    month by the last day of each month. It argued that the document titled\n                    “TAX INVOICE” dated 10 March 2011 and described as\n                    “Being 7thProgress Claim” and\n                    containing a breakdown of the “Total Work Done As At 25/12/2010”\n                    (“the 10 March 2011 document”) (referred to at[25]above) was a purported payment claim and\n                    there were therefore two purported payment claims in March 2011. This was not\n                    permissible under reg 5(1). 29     Without going into the correctness of the\n                    plaintiff’s interpretation of the law, this argument hinged on the\n                    10 March 2011 document being a payment claim or at least a purported\n                    payment claim under the SOPA. I find that this could not be the case as the\n                    10 March 2011 failed to comply with reg 5(2)(c) of the SOP Regulations, which required a payment claim to\n                    contain details of the claimed amount, including: (i) a breakdown of the items constituting the claimed amount; (ii) a description of these items; (iii) the quantity or quantum of each item; and (iv) the calculations which show how the claimed amount is derived 30     The only calculation contained in the\n                    10 March 2011 document was: ItemDescriptionQuantityUnit\n                                    PriceAmount1)Total Work Done As At\n                                            25/12/2010$1,028,388.29Add: Variation\n                                        Order$97,766.59Total$1,126,154.88Less: 10%\n                                        Retention$\n                                        (112,615.49)Net\n                                    Amount:$1,013,539.39Less: Profit\n                                            Entitlement$\n                                    (65,880.06)Sub-Total$947,659.93Less : Previous Payment\n                                                (1stto\n                                                5th)$\n                                        (477,794.35)This\n                                    Claim$469,864.98Add 7%\n                                    GST$32,890.55Total Amount Included\n                                            GST$502,755.53Less : 6th Claim Yet to\n                                            Received – WSH/008/11$\n                                        (107,000.00)Total Amount Including GST\n                                            [handwritten]$395,755.53   There was no breakdown of the work done or a particularisation of the\n                    description, quantity, quantum or the unit price of each item of work. Unlike\n                    Progress Claim No. 8, such a detailed breakdown was also not attached. The\n                    10 March 2011 could not therefore be a payment claim under the\n                SOPA. 31     I would also add that apart from failing to\n                    meet the formal requirements for validity under the SOP Regulations, it was\n                    clear to me that the 10 March 2011 document could not have been apurportedpayment claim under the SOPA,ie, it could not have been intended as a payment claim\n                    under the SOPA (seeSungdoat [20]). It took the form of an unremarkable tax\n                    invoice and it was marked “Attn: Account Department”, without any\n                    specific person’s attention being drawn to it. It was signed by an\n                    “Authorized Signature” who was not identified and contained the\n                    handwritten words “Total Amount including GST”, reflecting a\n                    certain degree of informality. There was additionally no attempt made whatsoever\n                    to describe and quantify the work done as evident from the lack of content in\n                    the columns “Quantity” and “Unit Price”. These facts\n                    did not suggest any sort of intention for the 10 March 2011 to be treated\n                    as a payment claim under the SOPA. 32     I therefore find that Progress Claim\n                    No. 8 was not in breach of reg 5(1) of the SOP Regulations.",
        "Whether Progress Claim No. 8 was made in breach of s 10(1)\n                of the SOPA": "33     Section 10(1) of the SOPA provides as\n                    follows: 10.—(1)  A\n                        claimant may serve one payment claim in respect of a progress payment\n                        on — (a) one or more other persons who, under\n                            the contract concerned, is or may be liable to make the payment;\n                            or (b) such other person as specified in or\n                            identified in accordance with the terms of the contract for this\n                            purpose. 34     “Progress payment” is in turn\n                    defined by 2 of the SOPA to mean: ... a payment to which a person is entitled for the carrying\n                        out of construction work, or the supply of goods or services, under a\n                        contract, and includes — (a) a single or one-off payment;\n                            or (b) a payment that is based on an event\n                            or a date; 35     The plaintiff argued that because works had\n                    ceased at the site by December 2010 with only rectification works carrying on\n                    thereafter, Progress Claim No. 8 although expressed as being for work done\n                    “up to 25thMarch 2011”, was actually\n                    for work done up to 31 December 2010. As the Defendant had previously\n                    submitted other progress claims for work in that period, (see above at[25]) a further claim for progress payment for\n                    works done up to December 2010 could not be made because this would be in breach\n                    of s 10(1) of the SOPA, which only allowed “onepayment claim in respect ofaprogress payment” [emphasis added]. 36     This argument hinged on the proposition that\n                    rectification works were not works in respect of which a progress claim could be\n                    made. When questioned, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that rectification\n                    works were not “construction work, or the supply of goods or\n                    services” under s 2 of the SOPA that would entitle the defendant to\n                    a progress payment because rectification works would be paid for out of the\n                    retention monies held back by the plaintiff. However, there was no provision in\n                    the contract between the parties to that effect, neither was there any other\n                    evidence on the practices of the construction industry that could establish such\n                    a proposition. In any event, I observe that excluding rectification works from\n                    the concept of “construction work, or the supply of goods or\n                    services” which would entitle a claimant to a progress payment, would be\n                    contrary to s 3 of the SOPA, which defined “construction\n                    work”, “goods” and “services” in a manner\n                    that could not on a reasonable interpretation be read as excluding rectification\n                    works. 37     I therefore rejected the plaintiff’s\n                    argument that Progress Claim No. 8 was in breach of s 10(1) of the\n                    SOPA and consequently decided against the plaintiff in respect of the validity\n                    issue.",
        "Whether Progress Claim No. 8 was served on time": "38     The second challenge brought by the plaintiff\n                    to set aside the Adjudication Determination was the service issue. The plaintiff\n                    argued that because all the works under the contract it had with the defendant\n                    had ceased by December 2010 and only rectification works were carried out after\n                    December 2010, in accordance with the interpretation of s 10(2) of the SOPA\n                    and reg 5(1) of the SOP Regulations given by Tay J inChua\n                        Say Eng, Progress Claim No. 8 was served out of time as it\n                    should have been served by 31 January 2011. 39     The defendant argued that the Adjudicator had\n                    ample opportunity to consider the service issue and came to the conclusion that\n                    because the contract continued between the plaintiff and the defendant at the\n                    material time, with the defendant continuing to carry out rectification works as\n                    well as payment negotiations with the plaintiff well into February 2011,\n                    Progress Claim No. 8 was served on time (by 31 March 2011), regardless\n                    of which interpretation of s 10(2) of the SOPA and reg 5(1) of the SOP\n                    Regulations was adopted. There was therefore no reason to challenge the\n                    Adjudicator’s decision as being unreasonable on aWednesburybasis. The defendant also sought to distinguishChua Say Engon the basis that this was a case\n                    where the defendant was entitled to claim not only the additional sums due for\n                    further works that were completed in March 2011, but also for all monies\n                    previously unpaid at that point under s 10(4) of the SOPA. 40     Suffice it to say, and for the reasons stated\n                    in[36]above, I saw no reason to disagree\n                    with the Adjudicator.",
        "Whether there were breaches of natural justice that warranted the\n                setting aside of the Adjudication Determination": "41     Under s 16(3)(c) of the SOPA, an adjudicator is obliged to “comply with\n                    the principles of natural justice. 42     The breach of natural justice complained of by\n                    the plaintiff was essentially that the Adjudicator had, in the Adjudication\n                    Determination, referred to other unpublished adjudication determinations known\n                    to the Adjudicator and that were not cited by the parties. The plaintiff\n                    complained that by failing to allow it an opportunity to address the Adjudicator\n                    on these other adjudication determinations, the Adjudicator had acted in breach\n                    of the natural justice principleaudialterampartem. CitingSEF Construction,Soh Beng\n                        Tee & Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd[2007]\n                    3 SLR 86 (“Soh Beng Tee”),\n                    the New Zealand High Court decision inTrustees of Rotoaira\n                        Forest Trust v Attorney-General[1999] 2 NZLR 452\n                        (“Rotoaira”) and the English\n                    Court of Appeal decision ofFox v PG Wellfair Ltd[1981] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 514, the plaintiff argued that as long as the\n                    adjudicator had incorporated his own opinions and ideas into the Adjudication\n                    Determination, which were not reasonably foreseeable to the parties, and to the\n                    extent that this had created surprise and deprived them of the right to address\n                    full arguments on those opinions and ideas, the Adjudication Determination ought\n                    to be set aside as being in breach of natural justice. 43     The defendant, on the other hand, argued that\n                    the plaintiff’s contention could not stand as both parties had ample\n                    opportunity to present their cases to the Adjudicator. In any event, the\n                    defendant also submitted that no prejudice was caused to the plaintiff as it was\n                    clear from the Adjudication Determination that the references to the previous\n                    adjudication determinations did not materially affect the Adjudicator’s\n                    conclusions. The defendant relied on the summary of principles inSoh Beng Teeat [65], which was a case decided in\n                    relation to an arbitration award, particularly for the statement that “an\n                    award should be read generously such that only meaningful breaches of the rules\n                    of natural justice that have actually caused prejudice are ultimately\n                    remedied”. 44     It is first important to recognise that what\n                    is required by natural justice depends heavily on the context in which it\n                    operates. Prakash J inSEF Constructionat [52]\n                    endorsed the views expressed by Assistant Registrar Lim Jian Yi inChip HupHup Kee Construction Pte Ltd\n                        v Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co Ltd[2008] SGHC 159 at [50] as follows: Justice, whether performed by a court, a tribunal or any quasi-judicial\n                        body, is a balancing exercise between thoroughness and timeliness. More\n                        formal settings, such as litigation through a court, would tend to emphasis\n                        the former. The adjudication process under the [SOPA] instead chooses a\n                        quicker, but somewhat less thorough, means of achieving justice. This is a\n                        general theme which pervades the [SOPA] and in itself is not a ground for\n                        saying that natural justice has been denied. 45     The Court of Appeal inSoh\n                        Beng Teealso recognised at [65(b)] that fairness was “a\n                    multidimensional concept and it would be unfair to the successful party if it\n                    were deprived of the fruits of its labour as a result of a dissatisfied party\n                    raising a multitude of arid technical challenges”. The “overriding\n                    burden [was] on the applicant to show that a reasonable litigant in his shoes\n                    could not have foreseen the possibility of reasoning of the type revealed in the\n                    award” (Soh Beng Teeat [65(d)]). This was\n                    a question of fact and degree to be determined in the individual case (Rotoairaat 162). Although said in the context of\n                    examining an arbitration award, these principles are equally applicable\n                    here. 46     In the present case, it was not disputed that\n                    the Adjudicator had in the Adjudication Determination made various references to\n                    other adjudication determinations that the parties had not cited to him. To that\n                    extent, he had caused surprise. However, this should not in itself lead to the\n                    setting aside of the Adjudication Determination, particularly where these\n                    unpublished adjudication determinations, when read in context, served merely as\n                    examples and illustrations and could not have affected the outcome of the case.\n                    In respect of the reference to AA SOP No 62 of 2011, which the oral and written\n                    submission of the plaintiff focussed on, the Adjudicator had clearly indicated\n                    that he would not be relying on the interpretation of the SOPA and the SOP\n                    Regulations contained in that case but regardedChua Say\n                        Engas authoritative. He had also stated that whether he followed\n                    the interpretation in AA SOP No 62 of 2011 or that inChua\n                        Say Eng, the same result would follow as his decision on the\n                    service issue rested on a factual determination that the contract between the\n                    plaintiff and the defendant continued into February 2011. 47     It was true that the parties were not invited\n                    to address the specific adjudication determinations cited by the Adjudicator,\n                    but it could not be denied that they had ample opportunity to address theissuesin question whether at the Adjudication\n                    Conference or through the various rounds of submissions submitted to the\n                    Adjudicator. It cannot be said that a reasonable litigant in the shoes of the\n                    plaintiff could not have foreseen the possibility ofreasoning of the type revealed in the awardmerely because the\n                    particular examples and references provided by the Adjudicator were not\n                    previously known to it. 48     In my judgment, the Adjudicator had complied\n                    with theaudialterampartemprinciple. The Adjudicator\n                    had made known his concerns on the (contentious) service issue, and had invited\n                    parties to address him onChua Say Engand the\n                    first instance decision ofChua Say Eng (formerly trading as\n                        Weng Fatt Construction Engineering) v Lee Wee Lick Terence @ Li Weili\n                        Terence[2010] SGHC 333, and they had done so. Although\n                    his decision on the service issue did not accept either the plaintiff’s or\n                    the defendant’s submission in their entirety, he was not required or\n                    obliged to do so (seeRotoairaat 463;Soh Beng Teeat [65(e)]).",
