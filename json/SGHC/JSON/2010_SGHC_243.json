        "Introduction": "1       The plaintiff is the developer of Alpha\n                    Industrial Building (“the building”) and the owner of,inter alia, unit #05-11 in the building (“the\n                    unit”). The defendant was the tenant of the unit under two successive\n                    tenancy agreements. The formal terms of both leases have run out. In this\n                    action, the plaintiff is claiming for the repossession of the unit, arrears in\n                    rent and double rent for holding over. The defendant is resisting the claim on\n                    the basis that he is entitled to purchase the unit pursuant to a contractual\n                    right or proprietary estoppel. There is also the issue of who should bear the\n                    responsibility for the construction of a mezzanine floor in the unit which is\n                    irregular under planning regulations.",
        "Facts": "2       The plaintiff was represented by instructed\n                    counsel, Mr Thio Shen Yi SC. Its sole witness was Mr Lim Chin Leong,\n                    the plaintiff’s managing director. The defendant, Mr Shiok, appeared\n                    in person. He gave evidence himself and also called Mr Yeo Hock Chuan who\n                    is a property agent who acted for him in his initial dealings with the\n                    plaintiff. The evidence is as follows.",
        "The first tenancy agreement": "3       Mr Lim and Mr Shiok first met sometime\n                    in late November or early December 2004. On 9 December 2004 they entered\n                    into a tenancy agreement for the unit (“the first tenancy\n                    agreement”). The term was for two years, from 1 January 2005 to\n                    31 December 2006. Rent was fixed at $3,200 a month. Clause 3(d) of the\n                    first tenancy agreement read:[note: 1] During the term of the Tenancy, THE LANDLORD agrees not to sell THE SAID\n                        PREMISES to any purchasers other than THE TENANT at the predetermined sale\n                        price ofSingapore Dollars Four Hundred Sixty Two\n                            Thousand And Fifty Four Only (S$462,054.00) or at S$159.00 per\n                            sqft, exclusive of GST and stamp duty which are payable by\n                        THE TENANT. All rental payable shall be calculated till the date of sale\n                        completion. 4       Mr Lim characterised clause 3(d) as\n                    follows in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”)\n                    at [10]: The aforesaid Clause 3(d) of the 1st Tenancy Agreement is, as I am\n                        advised, a right of pre-emption. While the right was subsisting, the\n                        Plaintiffs were not allowed to sell the Premises to anybody except the\n                        Defendant. It is pertinent to note that Mr Lim, rather artfully, stopped shy\n                    of saying thatheunderstood clause 3(d) to\n                    be a right of pre-emption. Mr Lim’s evidence on the stand, when he\n                    was cross-examined by Mr Shiok, was significantly different. On the second\n                    day of the trial, there was this exchange:[note: 2] Q:During [our first meeting in December 2004], we\n                            conclude the rental of the unit 05-11 and the option to purchase\n                            the unit at $159 per square feet. Do you agree? A:Yes, I agree. A similar exchange was as follows:[note: 3] Q:I will put it to you, if you have not given me the\n                            option to purchase at 159, I would not have invest in this unit, neither\n                            would I take up the rental. A:I disagree with you. It’s stated very clearly\n                            in the tenancy agreement that you have to buy within the tenancy\n                            agreement and I’m willing to sell you at $159 per square feet. But\n                            it was very unfortunate that you do – that you did not take this\n                            opportunity to buy at all. Q:Look, Mr Lim, I put it you to you at a later\n                            stage on this issue, because all this is going to happen in December\n                            2006 and I want you to know, do you – and I put it to you that\n                            $159 per square feet was to me an option to purchase and\n                        – Def:Your Honour, I – I’ll rephrase it\n                            again, correct. Q:Do you agree that the discussion ended with $3,200\n                            for 2 + 2 rental lease with an option to purchase at $159 per square\n                            feet? A:Yes, I agree but it was for the first\n                            2-year. Likewise, on the fourth day of the trial:[note: 4] Q:In December 2004, I came to Alpha Building with my\n                            agent Jeffrey Yeo and we met you there. Do you agree? A:Yes. Q:Mm. Do you agree that during this meeting, we\n                            discussed the tenancy agreement and the option to\n                        purchase? A:Yes. And later on the same day:[note: 5] Q:[Refers to clause 3(d) of tenancy\n                            agreement] A:Yes. Q:Yah, do you agree that, er, I have the first right\n                            to buy this unit within the 2 years’ tenancy\n                        agreement? A:Yes. All these were not changed in re-examination, where Mr Thio\n                    sought to establish that there was no option granted between the\n                        parties:[note: 6] Q:Now, earlier this morning, you were asked this\n                            question, that you agreed – during the meeting on December 04, you\n                            discussed the tenancy agreement and option to purchase and you said yes.\n                            Now, a lot of terms have been used loosely, so what I want you to do, is\n                            go to the plaintiff’s bundle of documents, grey bundle. The\n                            tenancy agreement is at page 9. When you say “option to\n                            purchase”, what are you referring to in this tenancy\n                            agreement? A:Actually the word option to purchase is – is\n                            the tenancy is given at that point in time within 2 years to\n                            purchase and within the 2 year, 3 months before the expiry, he\n                            has to make his option to purchase. Q:No, no, sorry. Which part of the tenancy agreement\n                            are you referring – does this “option to purchase”\n                            refer to? Because just now what you said is the option\n                        – A:I think it is 3 – 3(d), page\n                        12. Q:3(g). A:3(d). Denmark. Q:Okay. [Moves on.] 5       Mr Shiok and Mr Yeo were also\n                    cross-examined on the meaning of clause 3(d). Unsurprisingly, they\n                    confirmed that it was a right of pre-emption. However, they were not examined on\n                    the actual understanding reached between themselves. This is an issue which was\n                    obviously relevant because of Mr Shiok’s insistence that he had an\n                    option and Mr Lim’s repeated agreement on the stand with\n                    Mr Shiok’s point that an option was in fact the true arrangement\n                    between them.",
        "Renovations and the construction of the mezzanine floor": "6       After signing the first tenancy agreement,\n                    Mr Shiok proceeded to renovate the unit. The renovation took five to six\n                    months. The contractor was Heng Loong Construction (“Heng Loong”),\n                    of which Mr Lim was a partner. The invoices issued by Heng Loong to\n                    Mr Shiok totalled $106,176.63.[note: 7]The work done\n                    included the construction of a mezzanine floor which effectively doubled the\n                    floor area of the unit. After the renovations were completed, Mr Shiok\n                    began operating his business from the unit. He ran a precision engineering\n                    business and his plant included heavy machinery. 7       The mezzanine floor turned out to be irregular\n                    and has since been removed pursuant to an order of Judith Prakash J. The\n                    issue is who should be responsible for the irregularity. The irregularity, which\n                    was pointed out to the plaintiff by the Urban Redevelopment Authority\n                    (“URA”) on 18 December 2006 and by the Building and\n                    Construction Authority (“BCA”) on 25 January 2007, seemed to\n                    arise from the fact that the mezzanine floor area caused the gross floor area of\n                    the building to exceed the permitted limit. The precise nature of the\n                    irregularity was not clearly explained by either party. But both parties agreed\n                    on the fact of the irregularity and it is sufficient for present purposes to\n                    proceed on that basis. 8       In his AEIC at [9], Mr Shiok deposed\n                    that Mr Lim represented to him during their first meeting that the floor\n                    area of the unit could be expanded by constructing a mezzanine floor. At [10],\n                    Mr Shiok went on to say that Mr Lim represented to him that\n                    “they” would do all the relevant work and take care of obtaining\n                    the relevant approvals,etc, from the relevant\n                    government bodies. 9       In his AEIC, Mr Yeo Hock Chuan, who was\n                    Mr Shiok’s property agent at the time of the first tenancy agreement,\n                    deposed that Mr Lim had represented to Mr Shiok that the floor area of\n                    the unit could be expanded by the construction of a mezzanine floor, and that\n                    Mr Lim could carry out the construction and attend to all approval\n                    requirements. He also said that Mr Lim showed Mr Shiok a room where Mr\n                    Lim already built a mezzanine floor and told Mr Shiok he could do the same.\n                    According to Mr Yeo, all this happened in his presence. During\n                    cross-examination, Mr Yeo conceded that he did not hear Mr Lim\n                    represent to Mr Shiok that approval of the mezzanine was\n                        guaranteed.[note: 8] 10     In his AEIC at [7]–[8], Mr Lim\n                    deposed that the plaintiff was prepared to allow Mr Shiok to construct the\n                    mezzanine floor, but did not warrant that the structure was or would be\n                    approved. At [28], Mr Lim elaborated that neither the plaintiff nor\n                    Heng Loong nor himself had ever represented, warranted, promised or agreed that\n                    the said works could be used by Mr Shiok as a mezzanine floor – any\n                    risk of illegality was assumed solely by Mr Shiok. 11     However, Mr Lim took varying positions in\n                    cross-examination. At first, he said that, as of November 2004 and for six\n                    months thereafter, nobody knew what a mezzanine floor was - it was only in April\n                    2007 that the BCA raised the issue with the developer and the\n                        proprietors.[note: 9]Shortly after, however, Mr Lim said\n                    that, during the same period, all the proprietors of the building, including\n                    Mr Shiok, knew that a mezzanine floor was not allowed.[note: 10]A while\n                    later, when confronted with a police report by another proprietor that he was\n                    misled as to the legality of building a mezzanine floor, Mr Lim said that\n                    he could write off the report, as well as other similar reports by other\n                    proprietors, because he had told them that a mezzanine floor was\n                        illegal.[note: 11]Finally, when confronted with an invoice dated\n                    1 June 2005 which expressly referred to “Partition Work at\n                    Mezzanine”, Mr Lim said that the building of mezzanine floors was\n                    rampant at that time; he did the work at Mr Shiok’s request; and the\n                    issue was not what he knew or did not know.[note: 12]Mr Shiok’s\n                    various and varying positions contradict each other. If no one knew what a\n                    mezzanine floor was, they would not have known or been told that it was not\n                    allowed. If it was not allowed and they knew that, then why was Mr Lim\n                    building a mezzanine floor for Mr Shiok through Heng Loong? 12     It is also pertinent to refer to the following\n                    letter dated 27 November 2006 from 3P Architects to the URA on behalf\n                    of the plaintiff, where the following passage is found:[note: 13] We would like to seek your advice on payment of differential premium that\n                        may be leviable by Commissioner of Lands if we are proposing to increase the\n                        gross floor area to 11,602.59 sq m where the plot ratio will be 2.022\n                        exceeding the allowable GPR of 2.00. It was only after the URA refused permission that the plaintiff wrote\n                    to the relevant proprietors, including Mr Shiok, to remove their mezzanine\n                    floors. Prior to that, there is no evidence of the plaintiff giving any kind of\n                    warning to the proprietors. This application by 3P Architects on behalf of the\n                    plaintiff is consistent with the plaintiff having represented to Mr Shiok\n                    that he could build a mezzanine floor. 13     On balance, therefore, I believe\n                    Mr Shiok’s story in this regard. I find that, during their first\n                    meeting, Mr Lim must have told Mr Shiok that a mezzanine floor could\n                    be built and that he would apply for the necessary approvals for the mezzanine\n                    floor. There is also no evidence that Mr Lim warned Mr Shiok that a\n                    mezzanine floor would be irregular until approved. Since Heng Loong had not\n                    entered the picture at this point, these representations must have been made on\n                    behalf of the plaintiff. I also find that these representations must have\n                    materially induced Mr Shiok into entering into the first tenancy\n                    agreement.",
        "Valuation report": "14     Separately, Mr Shiok also obtained a\n                    valuation report from Jones Lang LaSalle Property Consultants Pte Ltd. The\n                    report was dated October 2005. The purpose of the report, as stated therein, was\n                    “[t]o determine the open market value of the subject property for\n                    financing purposes.” The report determined that the open market value of\n                    the unit was $470,000. It noted that the mezzanine floor had not been approved,\n                    and therefore excluded it from consideration. It is pertinent to note that the\n                    report was givenafterthe renovation works were\n                    completed. Thus it cannot be evidence that Mr Shiok proceeded with the\n                    construction of the mezzanine floor knowing that it was irregular.",
        "The transition to the second tenancy agreement": "15     Mr Shiok deposed in his AEIC at [29]\n                    –[32] that, after he entered into the first tenancy agreement, he always\n                    evinced an intention to purchase the unit. He also deposed that his intention\n                    was communicated clearly and unambiguously to the plaintiff. However, he\n                    conceded in cross-examination that his alleged intention to buy the unit was\n                    never expressed in writing. The earliest document where such an intention was\n                    recorded was dated 28 August 2008,[note: 14]when the parties’ relationship\n                    had already become acrimonious. 16     As far as the documentary evidence went, there\n                    was a letter dated 10 October 2006 by the plaintiff asking Mr Shiok to\n                    confirm with the plaintiff by 16 November 2006 whether he wished to renew\n                    the tenancy for another two years at a monthly rent of $3,680.[note: 15]On 27 November 2006,\n                    Mr Shiok replied to request the then-existing rate of rent, $3,200, to\n                    remain if he renewed the tenancy. Mr Lim made this note on the\n                        letter:[note: 16] “Pending” Due to complication this unit cannot be sold till Sept 2007. [Mr Lim’s signature] 4 Dec 2006 The authenticity of the note was not disputed. The cross-examination\n                    of Mr Lim on the two letters and his note is as follows:[note: 17] Q:And do you agree at that time this letter\n                                [iethe plaintiff’s letter of 10\n                            October 2006] is to increase the rental rate to 3,680 per\n                        month? A:In fact you should be the one before the ter\n                            – before the expiry of the tenancy agreement write to us, 3 months\n                            before the expiry – Q:Yes. A:– and this is the second month before the\n                            expiry. In fact we are doing you a favour. Q:I put it to you I – that time I do not intend\n                            to rent and I intend to buy and in fact I chase you for the S&P\n                            agreement. A:Er, in fact you was the one who asked for the three\n                            drawings, who asked for the valuation. Q:I put it to you the three drawing was in 2005,\n                            correct, and this one was in 2006. A:Yes. Q:That was for my valuation purpose\n                        only. A:Yes, it was the three drawings that you requested\n                            for valuation to buy the property. Q:Yes, at that time I trusted you because our\n                            relationship is very cordial and I didn’t realise you are such a,\n                            you know, person. A:Let – let me finish saying. Then you carry\n                            on. It was you who requested for the three drawings that you wanted to\n                            do a valuation to purchase the property and somehow you couldn’t\n                            get the loan; you abandoned the whole purchase. In fact the option to\n                            purchase was issued to you. You did not give it back to us, so how can\n                            you now say we did not issue an option to purchase? Q:I put it to you I did not receive the option to\n                            purchase. If not, I would have activated it. And I’d like to point\n                            the Court to [the note]. If I have not activated the request to buy, why\n                            do you need to write? A:Er, for your information, this is actually a\n                            domestic or rather internal communication to which you have no\n                            privilege. Very unfortunately – Q:No – A:– this letter was faxed to you and it\n                            wasn’t even said “faxed to you”. It just said\n                            pending, that’s all. It was not faxed to you at all, just that my\n                            office go and make a mistake and faxed it to you. Q:Mm. A:So you cannot use it as a bullet to fire\n                        us. There was no re-examination of Mr Lim on this\n                point. 17     There is also some correspondence indicating\n                    that Mr Shiok was in arrears of his rent payments at this point in time,\n                    although it seemed that he subsequently paid up. 18     In any event, the parties signed a second\n                    tenancy agreement sometime in March 2007 (“the second tenancy\n                    agreement”) for a two year term. The term began retrospectively from\n                    1 January 2007 and continued to 31 December 2008. The rent remained at\n                    $3,200 a month. Clause 2(f)(iii) of the second tenancy agreement provided\n                    that Mr Shiok shall:[note: 18] During the currency of this tenancy, to allow the Landlord or its\n                        representatives at all reasonable times to bring any interested parties to\n                        view the said premises in the event of a prospective sale thereof. The said\n                        premises shall be sold subject to this tenancy. Clause 4(i) of the second tenancy agreement provided\n                        that:[note: 19] During the term of the Tenancy, THE LANDLORD agrees not to sell THE SAID\n                        PREMISES to any purchasers other than THE TENANT at the sale price which\n                        will be determined after the CSC. While it is not relevant to any issue before me, I note that the\n                    plaintiff appeared to have dated its copy of the second tenancy agreement\n                    unilaterally as Mr Shiok’s copy is undated. 19     In his AEIC, Mr Lim deposed that\n                    clause 4(i) of the second tenancy agreement (which he also characterised as\n                    a right of pre-emption) differed from clause 3(d) of the first tenancy\n                    agreement because of worries that the issues surrounding the construction of the\n                    mezzanine floor will delay the application for the Certificate of Statutory\n                    Completion (“CSC”) and render the plaintiff liable for liquidated\n                    damages to a purchaser. 20     It is significant to note that Mr Lim\n                    claimed that this worry arose on or before November 2006 when the application\n                    for the CSC was submitted. This was materially different from his evidence in\n                    cross-examination that he only knew about the mezzanine floor in April 2007 (seesupra[11]). It is also pertinent to note that\n                    Mr Lim’s explanation is not congruent with his position in his AEIC\n                    that there was only a right of pre-emption between the parties – if this\n                    was so, whether or not the unit was sold would be entirely in the power of the\n                    plaintiff. 21     For his part, Mr Shiok claimed that he\n                    entered into the second tenancy agreement because he had no choice:[note: 20] Court:... Let me ask you a simple question.\n                                            Whatever your understanding\n                                    –Shiok:Yes.Court:– the language in the tenancy\n                                            agreement, the first one and the second one, say what\n                                            they say, okay? So if you have an understanding. You\n                                            say, “Oh I think the 3.2 – 3d) in the first\n                                            agreement have been taken out and repeated in the new\n                                            tenancy agreement”. It is\n                                    not?Shiok:It is not, yes.Court:Okay. So how come – what is your\n                                            understanding? You’re saying this agreement\n                                            don’t matter? This is my understanding and this\n                                            you agree? That – is that what you’re\n                                            saying?Shiok:No, my understanding was that\n                                            that’s why there was a delay of 3 months because I\n                                            – I do not agree to his new second tenancy\n                                            agreement.Court:But finally you signed\n                                    it?Shiok:Yes, that’s because, er, I’m\n                                            forced to sign. And, er, in fact was written in my\n                                            – written in my affidavit – in one of my\n                                            affidavits that was submitted. And I can point it out to\n                                            the Court, mm.Thio:No, we’ve seen – we –\n                                            we – you’ve already mentioned it, Mr –\n                                            and Mr Shiok, you can –Court:He already said “I’m forced\n                                            to sign”. Is that – is that what you mean\n                                            by duress?Shiok:Yes. It is like putting a – putting\n                                            a throat to – to – putting a knife to my\n                                            throat and, you know, “If you don’t sign,\n                                            we will chase you out.”Thio:But let me just\n                                    –Shiok:And that – that is a – is a\n                                            distress to me. And, er, I – I – I have\n                                            choice because my investment is so high and, er, you\n                                            know, how to – what shall I do. And it’s not\n                                            said I – I immediately January I signed because\n                                            I’m still willing and still able to purchase the\n                                            unit at that time. And I need the purchase S&P\n                                            agreement and he refused to put the price. And the only\n                                            reason was the CSC application but to me, I believe him\n                                            at that time but when I saw the tenancy agreement, I\n                                            – I entirely don’t believe this person. And\n                                            then the words he – he promised to have a\n                                            management meeting and, you know, come back to me and\n                                            ask me to wait and after –Thio:Okay.   It was also suggested to Mr Shiok that he could not have\n                    activated the option because he was not able to pay the purchase price. An\n                    Enhanced Individual Search was adduced showing a number of bankruptcy\n                    applications against him. Mr Thio relied particularly on a suit brought in\n                    2007 by Hitachi Capital Singapore Pte Ltd for $168,787.00. The suit has not been\n                    discontinued. But the search showed that no action has been taken since 2007. In\n                    the circumstances, the Enhanced Individual Search does not establish whether or\n                    not he was in a position to pay the purchase price. 22     Notwithstanding his allegation of duress,\n                    Mr Shiok also at one point seemed to say that he accepted the second\n                    tenancy agreement:[note: 21] Q:But if you intend to purchase the unit\n                            – A:Yah. Q:– you can tell Mr Lim, “Oh,\n                            Mr Lim, does not worry about rent. I’m just going to buy the\n                            unit. Then it will – it’s mine, I don’t have to pay\n                            you anymore rent.” Why didn’t you say that? A:Yah, I already say that to Mr Lim and\n                            – Q:Why didn’t you say this in\n                        writing? A:– to – for him to give me the S&P\n                            also. And this is only a proposal. It’s not a – it’s\n                            not, er, something like, you know, an insistent. It’s –\n                            I’m just proposing, “If, okay, and let’s”\n                            – Q:Yes. A:The situation is this way: If it’s okay\n                            – Q:Mr Shiok – A:No, no, I just put the – this, er, way of,\n                            er, explanation to you at that time of situation. If it’s okay the\n                            rent at 3,200 and there’s no much change on the tenancy agreement\n                            and the price they want to maintain, you know, I – I might go for\n                            the tenancy agreement. This is my – my – Q:Oh, so if the price didn’t change\n                            – A:Yes. Q:– you might go for the tenancy\n                            agreement. A:Yes. Q:You might not exercise your – A:Yes, I might not. Q:– option to purchase, is it? A:Yes, yes. Q:Is that what you are saying? A:Yes.",
        "Subsequent events": "23     Subsequently, matters deteriorated further.\n                    Mr Shiok refused to remove the mezzanine floor and to pay rent. The\n                    plaintiff sought to evict him and remove the mezzanine floor. As mentioned (seesupra[7]), Judith Prakash J allowed the\n                    plaintiff to remove the mezzanine floor, and this was accomplished on\n                    29-30 January 2010. Mr Shiok was very badly affected by this turn of\n                    events. The conduct of his business was substantially impaired with the\n                    demolition of the mezzanine floor and has now ceased. He is now in poor\n                    financial straits and is facing bankruptcy. During the trial, he was visibly\n                    stirred when he cross-examined Mr Lim, and clearly felt himself to have\n                    been victimised. In fact, he had to be hospitalised after the second day of the\n                    trial, which caused the trial to be delayed for 3 months.",
        "Analysis": "24     The formal terms of both tenancy agreements\n                    have ended. Hence, unless Mr Shiok is able to establish some other right to\n                    possession of the unit, he must surrender possession to the\n                plaintiff.",
        "Contract": "25     Mr Shiok’s first argument was\n                    founded on contract - specifically, that he had a contractual option to purchase\n                    pursuant to clause 3(d) of the first tenancy agreement. 26     On its face, clause 3(d) only granted a\n                    right of pre-emption. For present purposes that is significantly different from\n                    an option to purchase because the plaintiff has not made any offer to sell the\n                    unit. There was no way in which the words in clause 3(d) could have been\n                    construed as amounting to the grant of an option. However, Mr Lim’s\n                    evidence on the stand strongly indicated that the parties’ understanding\n                    was that an option to purchase was granted. This is fortified by the fact that\n                    Mr Shiok spent six months and over $100,000 for Heng Loong to renovate\n                    the unit. This amounted to a quarter of the term of the first tenancy agreement\n                    and over thirty times the monthly rent, and it is very doubtful that he\n                    would have done so if there was not some understanding between the parties that\n                    he could purchase the unit. On this basis, I would have granted rectification of\n                    clause 3(d) but for the fact that both Mr Shiok and Mr Lim also\n                    seem to accept, rather confusingly, that clause 3(d) correctly captured the\n                    contractual agreement between them. In the absence of a mistake as to the\n                    language used, rectification is not possible.",
        "Proprietary estoppel": "27     Mr Shiok’s next argument was\n                    proprietary estoppel. For present purposes, the general elements of proprietary\n                    estoppel are sufficiently stated by Sundaresh Menon JC inHong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank\n                        Ltd[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292 at [170]: there must be a\n                    representation concerning a right or interest in land by the party against whom\n                    the estoppel is sought to be raised, and reliance and detriment on the part of\n                    the party seeking to raise the estoppel. 28     The unique feature of this case is that the\n                    proprietary estoppel is said to existalongsideformal contractual arrangements,viz, the two\n                    tenancy agreements. As a matter of principle, I do not think that proprietary\n                    estoppel is necessarily precluded by the existence of a formal contract between\n                    the parties, whether the contract was entered into prior to, contemporaneous\n                    with, or subsequent to the representation which is said to have given rise to\n                    the estoppel. Of course, the existence of a formal contract is an important fact\n                    to be considered in determining whether an estoppel has arisen. For example, a\n                    prior or contemporaneous contract may give rise to an inference that the\n                    representation which was not reduced into contract was not, when objectively\n                    viewed, intended to be relied upon. A subsequent contract, where the parties\n                    redefine their previously informal relationship, may lead to the conclusion that\n                    the equity raised by the estoppel has been displaced by the subsequent agreement\n                    of the parties. There are other possibilities, and everything depends on the\n                    facts of each case. The overarching inquiry remains, as Oliver J put it in\n                    his influential restatement inTaylors Fashions Ltd v\n                        Liverpool Victoria Trustees Co Ltd[1982] 1 QB 133 at\n                    151–152, “whether, in particular individual circumstances, it would\n                    be unconscionable for a party to be permitted to deny that which, knowingly, or\n                    unknowingly, he has allowed or encouraged another to assume to his\n                    detriment”. 29     On the evidence, I find that Mr Lim must\n                    have represented to Mr Shiok, at the time the first tenancy agreement was\n                    signed, that he could buy the unit at some point in time. Otherwise\n                    Mr Shiok would not have invested so much into the unit. The renovation by\n                    Heng Loong alone cost over $100,000 and took six months. This expenditure in\n                    terms of money and time could not have been justified on the formal terms of the\n                    first tenancy agreement which lasted two years and for which Mr Shiok was\n                    willing to pay $3,200 a month. For the same reason, I find that the\n                    representation cannot be intended to be subsumedwithinthe first agreement. In particular, the first tenancy\n                    agreement’s duration of two years shows that it must have existed as\n                    an understanding between the partiesalongsidetheir contractual arrangements. I find additional support for this conclusion in\n                    the note scribbled by Mr Lim on Mr Shiok’s letter of\n                    27 November 2006 (seesupra[16]), stating that a sale might be delayed\n                    to September 2007 pending the issuance of the CSC. The note may well be an\n                    internal note, as Mr Lim claimed. However, its existence indicated that the\n                    possibility of a sale to Mr Shiok, albeit outside the terms of the first\n                    tenancy agreement, was very much on the mind of Mr Lim. Otherwise, there\n                    seemed no reason why the note would be scribbled on Mr Lim’s letter,\n                    as opposed to some other place. 30     I therefore find, on the basis of the\n                    parties’ dealings during the first tenancy agreement, that Mr Lim had\n                    represented to Mr Shiok that he could buy the unit. And in material and\n                    detrimental reliance thereon, Mr Shiok entered into the first tenancy\n                    agreement, renovated the unit and built the mezzanine floor. Admittedly, thepreciseterms of the representation cannot be\n                    established on the evidence before me. But that in itself is not a problem given\n                    that I am satisfied that some representation must have been made. The equity\n                    arising from proprietary estoppel “need not fail merely on the ground\n                    that the interest to be secured has not been expressly indicated”:Plimmer and another v The Mayor, Councillors, and\n                        Citizens of the City of Wellington(1884) 9 App Cas 699\n                    at 713. Given my findings, and since Mr Lim was acting on behalf of the\n                    plaintiff, a proprietary estoppel was therefore raised against the\n                    plaintiff. 31     The next question is the effect of the second\n                    tenancy agreement and the events surrounding it. Here the evidence is rather\n                    sketchy and inconclusive. As mentioned, there is no documentary evidence that\n                    Mr Shiok attempted to buy the unit. On the other hand, it appears that some\n                    parts of the parties’ dealings were undocumented or at least not presented\n                    to the court. For example, there is no documentary evidence supporting\n                    Mr Lim’s testimony that an option was presented at some point in time\n                    to Mr Shiok. There is also no evidence with respect to the parties’\n                    discussions on the second tenancy agreement. As for the second tenancy\n                    agreement, I do not think that Mr Shiok was compelled by economic duress to\n                    enter into it such that it could be set aside. As mentioned (seesupra[22]), Mr Shiok showed that he was\n                    willing to accept the second tenancy agreement as a substitute for an outright\n                    purchase. Also, as Mr Thio pointed out, duress was not pleaded. At the same\n                    time, however, it seemed clear that entering into the agreement was not a clear\n                    cut decision for both parties, given the three month delay between the expiry of\n                    the first tenancy agreement in December 2006 and the signing of the second\n                    tenancy agreement in March 2007. I do not think that the difficulties which must\n                    have been faced by the parties in negotiating a new agreement were entirely\n                    attributable to Mr Shiok’s failure to pay rent in December 2006 ,\n                    January and February2007. The arrears seemed to have ceased after that, and I\n                    infer that they were a consequence, rather than a cause, of the difficulties\n                    faced by the parties going forward. On balance, I would accept\n                    Mr Shiok’s evidence that he felt constrained to some extent by the\n                    investment he already put into the unit. 32     In all these circumstances, I cannot\n                    unequivocally conclude that the mere entering into the second tenancy agreement\n                    can be regarded as wholly satisfying or displacing the equity raised by the\n                    estoppel. The just and correct approach would be to consider all these\n                    circumstances in satisfying the equity raised by the initial estoppel, bearing\n                    in mind that “[h]ere equity is displayed at its most flexible”:perLord Denning MR inCrabb v Arun District Council[1976] 1 Ch 179 at\n                    189. 33     On the facts, I think an outright order to\n                    sell the unit to Mr Shiok is out of the question. Mr Shiok seemed to\n                    be in no position to buy the unit although he gave evidence of unnamed persons\n                    who were willing to back him up. In my view, the better and more precise remedy\n                    is an award of damages to put into Mr Shiok into the position he would be\n                    in had he not entered into the two tenancy agreements. This would reverse any\n                    detriment he has suffered, as well as take into account any benefit he had\n                    enjoyed as a result of entering into the tenancy agreements. I should add that,\n                    on assessment, if Mr Shiok was in fact better off after the two tenancy\n                    agreements, then he would have suffered no detriment, and justice would have\n                    been served. 34     As a corollary that damages are the\n                    appropriate remedy, Mr Shiok has no right to continue in the premises after\n                    the expiry of the second tenancy agreement.",
        "The mezzanine floor": "35     The mezzanine floor issue is relevant for\n                    deciding whether the second tenancy agreement was rightfully terminated.\n                    However, it does not affect the overall proprietary estoppel analysis and it is\n                    thus not necessary for me to decide the point. It is sufficient for me to\n                    observe that the plaintiff, Heng Loong and Mr Lim (who was the agent of\n                    both the plaintiff and Heng Loong) do not seem to have conducted themselves in a\n                    way that was beyond reproach in their dealings with Mr Shiok.",
        "Conclusion": "36     I therefore give judgment in the following\n                    terms: (a)If he has not already done so, Mr Shiok is\n                            to vacate the unit within six weeks of this judgment, failing which\n                            he is to pay the plaintiff rent at the rate of $6,400 a month, pro-rated\n                            accordingly.(b)Mr Shiok is entitled to damages to be\n                            assessed to restore him to the position he would be in had he not\n                            entered into the two tenancy agreements. The registrar is to assess the\n                            totality of rental, renovations and mezzanine floor payments made by him\n                            against the totality of benefits received by him in connection with the\n                            first tenancy until the date of vacation of the premises. Subject to\n                            this overriding aim, the assessing registrar should consider,inter alia, the amount of money Mr Shiok\n                            spent on renovating and improving the unit, including the building and\n                            removal of the mezzanine floor and the profits from his business\n                            conducted therein. I appreciate that a precise measure would not be\n                            possible – any evidential difficulties should be resolved in an\n                            equitable manner and in the spirit of my judgment.(c)The parties are at liberty to clarify the terms\n                            of my orders above, and to apply for any ancillary order to give effect\n                            to my judgment.37     Mr Shiok is entitled to his costs of the\n                    trial. The costs of the assessment are reserved to the registrar, who will also\n                    decide on interest.[note: 1]Defendant’s Bundle of Documents (“DBD”) p\n                                14[note: 2]Notes of\n                                Evidence (“NE”), 21 January 2010, p\n                        12[note: 3]NE, 21 January\n                                2010, p 23[note: 4]NE, 26 April 2010, p 9[note: 5]NE, 26 April\n                                2010, p 52[note: 6]NE, 26 April 2010, p\n                    57[note: 7]See the Bundle\n                                of Quotation and Invoices[note: 8]NE, 27 April 2010, p\n                        73[note: 9]NE, 26 April 2010, pp\n                            14-15[note: 10]NE, 26 April 2010, p 20[note: 11]NE, 26 April 2010, p\n                        22[note: 12]NE, 26\n                                April 2010, pp 34-35[note: 13]PBD, p 34[note: 14]DBD, p\n                                165[note: 15]Plaintiff’s Bundle of Documents (“PBD”),\n                                p 32[note: 16]PBD, p\n                    33[note: 17]NE, 26 April 2010, p 36[note: 18]PBD, p\n                                38[note: 19]PDB, p 42[note: 20]NE, 26 April 2010, p 74[note: 21]NE, 26 April 2010, p\n                        87"
