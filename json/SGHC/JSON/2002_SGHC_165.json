        "Originating Summons 1030 of 2000": "4 The first Applicant in OS\n\n1030/2000 is the Public Trustee. The second Applicant (\"Quraisj\") is the\n\nattorney of six persons who claim to be some of the beneficiaries under the Will. The\n\nApplicants applied for the following substantive order (prayer 2):2. That the 1stApplicant as the current\n\n    trustee of the Will of the abovenamed Testator be empowered to sell the properties\n\n    described in the Schedule hereto by public or private tender, public auction or private\n\n    treaty at such prices and on such terms and conditions as the 1stApplicant may\n\n    in his absolute discretion determine (but having regard to the valuation prices as set out\n\n    in the Valuation Reports attached to the 1st Affidavit of the 1stApplicant in\n\n    support of this application) freed from all encumbrances including:(a) the equitable interests of the beneficiaries under\n\n    the Will of the Testator; and(b) the interest claimed by the Caveators against the properties set\n\n    out in the Schedule hereto,and as from the date of this Order all the claims of the\n\n    beneficiaries and the Caveators who have lodged Caveats against the properties set out in\n\n    the Schedule hereto shall be deemed to be cancelled or withdrawn.5 This application for\n\nsale was objected to by the fifth Respondent (\"Musa\") and sixth Respondent\n\n(\"Salim\") objected. They claim to represent another group of beneficiaries. More\n\nthan this, they claim that the persons that Quraisj represents are not beneficiaries under\n\nthe Will. Musa and Salim claim that the people they represent constitute all the\n\nbeneficiaries under the Will.",
        "Originating Summons 600626 of\n\n2001": "6 To prosecute their claims, Musa\n\nand Salim filed OS 600626/2001 as Plaintiffs and named the Public Trutee and Quraisj as\n\nDefendants. In that summons they seek a determination of\"the true and lawful\n\nbeneficiaries of the Estate of [the Testator] and their respective shares and\n\nproportions\".",
        "Joinder7 On 28 September 2001, after\n\nhearing the parties, I made the following orders:": "1. The Public Trustee as the current Trustee of the Will\n\n    of the Testator be and is hereby empowered to take all steps in preparation for the sale\n\n    of the Testator’s properties described in the Schedule hereto provided that no sale\n\n    or disposal of the properties shall be made without the prior approval of the Court and\n\n    that at least seven (7) days’ prior notice shall be given by the Public Trustee to\n\n    the Respondents of such sale;2. An inquiry be conducted by this Honourable Court to ascertain who are the persons\n\n    entitled to the properties of the Testator as set out in the Schedule hereto;3. Originating Summons No. 600626 of 2001 be consolidated with\n\n    Originating Summons No. 1030 of 2000 and that the Inquiry be held on a date to be fixed by\n\n    this Honourable Court and that for the purposes of the Inquiry:(a) Affidavits filed in both the above Originating Summons Nos. 600626\n\n    of 2001 and No. 1030 of 2000 are to stand as evidence-in-chief;(b) Leave be and is hereby granted to all persons to file further Affidavits by 28th\n\n    November 2001;(c) Leave be and is hereby granted to all persons to file any reply to the Affidavits\n\n    by 28th December 2001;(d) No further Affidavits are to be filed after 28th December 2001 without the leave of\n\n    this Honourable Court.",
        "Inquiry as to\n\nbeneficiaries": "8 The inquiry pursuant to Order 2\n\nabove was conducted on 3 July 2002. The Public Trustee was not a party to that inquiry as\n\nhe is merely a trustee and is not concerned with the outcome. Quraisj admits the claim by\n\nMusa and Salim that the people they represent are beneficiaries under the Will, but not to\n\ntheir claim that they constitute all the beneficiaries. So the only issue is whether the\n\npersons that Quraisj represents, and any others, are also beneficiaries under the Will.9 The agreed facts are as\n\nfollows: The Testator had, in accordance with Indonesian law, married one Saimih who bore\n\nhim six sons, and also a daughter who predeceased him. Saimih died in or about 1928. Those\n\nsix sons married and had children. All six died between 1973 and 1987. Musa and Salim are\n\nthe sons of two of them and claim to represent the branch of beneficiaries arising from\n\nSaimih's children. Apart from Saimih, the Testator also had children by four other women\n\nand what is under contest is whether they were legally married to him under Muslim law.\n\nThe second wife (this term being used without prejudice) is Maimunah, who bore the\n\nTestator a son and a daughter. The third wife is Aisyah who bore him two sons. The fourth\n\nwife is Samani who bore him a daughter. The fifth wife is Maria who bore him two sons. The\n\nTestator had at various stages, divorced his second, third and fourth wives. At the time\n\nof his death, he was survived by:(a) six sons by Saimih, the first\n\n  wife;(b) a son and a daughter by\n\n  Maimunah, the second wife;(c) two sons by Aisyah, the third\n\n  wife;(d) one daughter by Samani, the\n\n  fourth wife;(e) Maria, his fifth wife; and(f) two sons by Maria.10 The sole issue is therefore\n\nwhether the Testator had been married under Muslim law to the second to fifth wives. If he\n\nhad not, then the beneficiaries are just the six sons by Saimih and consequently their\n\ndescendants would be entitled to the entire estate under the Will. If he did, then the\n\nnumber of beneficiaries would be 14, with the six sons by Saimih being collectively\n\nentitled to only 84/192 or 43.75% of the estate.11 Musa and Salim have filed two\n\naffidavits in both summons. The first affidavit is their joint affidavit filed 1 November\n\n2000, in which they relate the following:(a) the persons represented by\n\n    Quraisj are not beneficiaries and therefore not entitled to claim any share or interest in\n\n    the estate of the Testator;(b) there was \"in fact no\n\n    statement of marriage between the Testator and the said Madam Maria\", bearing in mind\n\n    that in Indonesia all marriages (including Muslim marriages) are valid and recognisable by\n\n    the State only if they are registered and not otherwise;(c) the Inheritance Certificate\n\n    from the Surabaya Inheritance Property Administration Office dated 7th February 1992\n\n    certified that the following six children are the heirs of the Testator:(i)    Said bin Achmad Wachdin\n\n      Basjarahil(ii)    Umar bin Achmad Wachdin\n\n      Basjarahil(iii)    Asad (Awad) bin Achmad\n\n      Basjarahil(iv)    Ali bin Achmad Basjarahil(v)    Hassan bin Achmad\n\n      Basjarahil(vi)    Saad (Asad) bin Achmad\n\n      Wachdin12 However in an earlier\n\nAffidavit affirmed by Salim and filed on 14 July 1995 in an earlier action, OS 473/1995,\n\nhe had stated that:(i) that the Testator had\n\n    \"four other wives one of whom is one Maria ….\";(ii) that OS 473 of 1995 was a\n\n    fraudulent attempt by the Plaintiff in that summons (Abdul Rachman bin Abdullah Wahdin,\n\n    one of Saimih’s grandsons) to cheat the rest of the beneficiaries of the estate of\n\n    the Testator including Quraisj.13 Salim deposed in an\n\naffidavit filed on 27 August 2001 to explain the contradiction. He said as follows:(a)    the contents of the\n\n  Affidavit in OS 473/1995 was \"not interpreted\" to him and the \"legal\n\n  niceties and implications were not fullycomprehended\" by him;(b)    he is \"illiterate\n\n  in the English language\";(c)there was \"no\n\n  intention\" on his part \"to acknowledge Maria or her children as having\n\n  any beneficial interest in the Testator’s estate notwithstanding her claim as a wife\n\n  of the deceased\".14 However if there had\n\nbeen such glaring errors in his earlier affidavit, Salim should have taken steps to\n\nrectify them as its contents could have misled the Court in arriving at the decision that\n\nit did in those proceedings. Neither Salim nor the solicitors who acted for him in OS\n\n473/1995 had filed affidavits explaining whether:(a) Salim was in fact illiterate\n\nin the English language;(b) Salim gave his instructions\n\nfor the Affidavit in the Indonesian or some other language;(c) the contents of the Affidavit\n\nfiled by him in OS 473/1995 were in fact the instructions given by him to his former\n\nsolicitors;(d) the contents of the Affidavit\n\nfiled in OS 473/1995 were explained to him and whether he fully understood and\n\nacknowledged the contents thereof.In the absence of such Affidavit\n\nby Salim’s former solicitors I cannot place much reliance on that aspect of the joint\n\naffidavit of Musa and Salim.15 In OS 473/1995, Quraisj had\n\nfiled an affidavit on 13 July 1995 in which he stated that there were fourteen principal\n\nbeneficiaries of the Testator under Muslim law. Salim had, in his affidavit filed on 14\n\nJuly 1995 in that summons, made the following statement in  4:My Father Hasan bin Achmad bin\n\n    Abdullah Wachdin Basharahil …. is entitled to a 14/192 share of the estate of the\n\n    Testator. Annexed and marked SH2 is a translated copy of a Certificate of Inheritance from\n\n    the office of the Public Trustee of SurabayaThe share of 14/192 that he\n\nasserts is consistent with Quraisj’s position and inconsistent with his and\n\nMusa’s.16 I should add further that the\n\njoint affidavit of Musa and Salim is devoid of any assertion that Maria was not married to\n\nthe Testator in accordance with Muslim law. All that the deponents have said is as\n\nfollows, at  17(1):KHM No. 1/BA was used in\n\n    Originating Summons No. 80 of 1976 to obtain relief from the High Court of Singapore when\n\n    Madam Maria and her Co-Plaintiffs in the Originating Summons proceedings had absolutely no\n\n    locus standi for the simple reason she had no proof of marriage to the Testator.In\n\n    Indonesia all marriages (including muslim marriages) are valid and recognisable by the\n\n    State only if they are registered and not otherwise.The words in bold only assert\n\nthat the State does not recognise the marriage if it was not registered in accordance with\n\nIndonesian law. It does not assert that the marriage was not conducted in accordance with\n\nMuslim law. If anything, from the words \"including muslim marriages\",\n\nthere is an implication that the marriage was conducted in accordance with Muslim law.17 As for the matter of the\n\nInheritance Certificate from the Surabaya Inheritance Property Administration Office, it\n\nrecites in the Certificate that the Office only took into consideration the children by\n\nthe first wife, Saimih. It is significant that the Certificate states that Saimih was the\n\n\"first wife\", implying that she is not the only wife. In Salim’s\n\naffidavit filed in OS 600626/2001 on 27 April 2001, he relied on two additional documents\n\nas follows:(i)    an Order of the Religious\n\n  Court of Pamekasan, Madura, Indonesia dated 16 October 2000 that there are only six lawful\n\n  beneficiaries of the Testator namely the six children by the Testator’s first wife\n\n  Saimih.(ii)    the Inheritance\n\n  Certificates issued by the Shariah Court in Singapore on the basis of the facts disclosed\n\n  in the Order of the Religious Court.18 Quraisj points out in his\n\nsecond affidavit that the Order of the Religious Court, on its face, reveals that the only\n\npersons who appeared and furnished information before the Religious Court were Musa and\n\nSalim. The Order was made on the erroneous basis that the Testator had only one wife,\n\nnamely Saimih, and six children. Musa and Salim did not reply to this affidavit although\n\nthey had the opportunity to do so.19 As for the Inheritance\n\nCertificates issued by Shariah Court, Singapore, they are based on the Order of the\n\nReligious Court which is itself spurious. In any event it is for this Court to make the\n\nrelevant findings of fact. Section 115 of the Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap. 3)\n\nstates as follows:(1) If, in the course of any\n\n    proceedings relating to the administration or distribution of the estate of a deceased\n\n    person whose estate is to be distributed according to the Muslim law, any Court or\n\n    authority shall be under the duty of determining the persons entitled to share in such\n\n    estate or the shares to which such persons are respectively entitled, the Syariah Court\n\n    may, on a request by the Court or authority or on the application of any person claiming\n\n    to be a beneficiary and on payment of the prescribed fee, certify upon any set of facts\n\n    found by such Court or authority or on any hypothetical set of facts its opinion as to the\n\n    persons who are, assuming such facts, whether as found or hypothetical, entitled to share\n\n    in such estate and as to the shares to which they are respectively entitled.(2) The Syariah Court may, before\n\n    certifying its opinion, require to hear the parties on any question of law, but shall not\n\n    hear evidence or make findings on any question of fact.(3) In any case of special difficulty, the Syariah Court may refer the\n\n    question to the Legal Committee of the Majlis for its opinion and shall, if such opinion\n\n    be given, certify in accordance therewith.This section provides that\n\nthe Shariah Court may, at the request of the Court,\"certify upon any set of facts\n\nfound by such Court …. or on any hypothetical set of facts its opinion\"as\n\nto who are entitled to share in the estate of a deceased person. The role of the Shariah\n\nCourt is to provide a ruling as to Shariah law on facts determined by the Court. The\n\nInheritance Certificates in question were therefore not made on the correct set of facts.20 Quraisj had filed two\n\nAffidavits in which he had set out the case on behalf of the beneficiaries he represented,\n\nwho were the offsprings of the third to fifth wives of the Testator. In his first\n\naffidavit filed on 17 August 2000, he stated that, under Power of Attorney No. 10162 of\n\n1999 executed in Singapore, he was appointed attorney of the following persons:(i) Maria Binti Musa(ii) Abubakar bin Achmad bin\n\n    Abdullah Wachdin Basjarahil(iii) Abdulazis bin Achmad bin\n\n    Abdullah Wachdin Basjarahil(iv) Wahdin bin Achmad bin\n\n    Abdullah Wachdin Basjarahil(v) Harith bin Achmad bin\n\n    Abdullah Wachdin Basjarahil(vi) Fetum binti Achmad bin\n\n    Abdullah Wachdin Basjarahil.None of the other Respondents\n\nhave questioned the authenticity or validity of this Power of Attorney at any time during\n\nthese proceedings.21 In Quraisj’s 2nd\n\nAffidavit filed on 24 September 2001, he sets out the family history of the Testator and\n\nthe names of the 14 principal beneficiaries and a list of secondary beneficiaries along\n\nwith a family tree. Neither Musa nor Salim has filed any affidavits to challenge or refute\n\nthis.22 In view of the above, I\n\nconclude that the beneficiaries are the ones set out by Quraisj in his evidence. On the\n\nbasis of this finding, their shares are not in dispute and I would declare that the\n\nfourteen persons listed below are the principal beneficiaries, with their respective\n\nshares in the Testator’s estate shown after each name:Widow:(1) Maria Janda Achmad b.\n\nAbdullah Wachdin Basharahil        24/192Sons(2) Said b. Achmad b. Abdullah\n\nWachdin Basharahil (deceased) 14/192(3) Umar b. Achmad b. Abdullah\n\nWachdin Basharahil (deceased) 14/192(4) Awat b. Achmad b.

        "Order for sale": "23 Once the determination as to\n\nthe beneficiaries is made, it follows that the order for sale would be made in accordance\n\nwith substantively the terms of prayer 2 of OS 1030/2000.
