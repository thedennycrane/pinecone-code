        "Introduction": "1       These appeals concern four separatein remwrits issued against theChem\n                        Orchid(“the Vessel”). Each writ was filed pursuant\n                    to a different cause of action each plaintiff had against the demise charterer\n                    of the Vessel. In the court below, the defendant (the owner of the Vessel)\n                    applied to set aside all of the writs on the basis that the court’s\n                    admiralty jurisdiction had not been properly invoked under s 4(4) of the\n                    High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap 123, 2001 Rev Ed)\n                    (“HCAJA”) because the Vessel was no longer on demise charter at\n                    the time the writs were issued. The Assistant Registrar found for the defendant\n                    and set aside the writs. Two of thein remwrits\n                    also contained separatein personamclaims against\n                    the defendant as owners of the Vessel. Those claims remain alive as the\n                    Assistant Registrar found that there was no legal basis to justify their\n                    striking out at this stage of the proceedings. The plaintiffs now appeal against\n                    the Assistant Registrar’s decision to set aside the writs while the\n                    defendant appeals against the Assistant Registrar’s decision not to strike\n                    out the claims brought by two of the plaintiffs. 2       The key question in these appeals is whether the\n                    charter of the Vessel had already been terminated at the time of the issuance of\n                    the writs. This necessitates an examination of an important legal point,viz, the requirement of redelivery in the\n                    termination of a bareboat charter. This is not merely a matter of contract but\n                    has, in the context of admiralty law, crucial implications on the court’s\n                    jurisdiction to order the arrest of bareboat or demise chartered vessels (the\n                    terms are used interchangeably in this judgment). 3       The right to arrest and the risk of a vessel\n                    being arrested are normal incidents arising from the operation and management of\n                    any vessel. Typically, parties dealing with vessels do not transact directly\n                    with the registered owner of the vessel but with managers and/or agents of the\n                    vessels which may vary from port to port. In the case of bareboat charters, this\n                    is almost invariably the case because the effect and essence of any bareboat\n                    charter is to grant the bareboat charterer complete control and possession of\n                    the vessel. Given that there is no public registry of bareboat charters\n                    available for inspection, third parties dealing with bareboat charterers have no\n                    way of finding out if the vessel is on bareboat charter and may well assume that\n                    they are in fact dealing with the owners of the vessel. 4       This point assumes critical significance when\n                    one considers that, until the 1980s, vessels on bareboat charter were insulated\n                    from arrest for most claims save for a limited class of maritime liens. Thus,\n                    third parties could not arrest a vessel to satisfy debts owed to them by the\n                    bareboat charterers. This placed third parties who transacted with bareboat\n                    charterers at a significant disadvantage for they could, unbeknownst to them, be\n                    left without security for their claims. In recent decades, many common law\n                    jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Australia, Malaysia,\n                    Canada, and New Zealand have amended their laws to permit the arrest of the\n                    bareboat chartered vessel if, at the time the action is brought, the vessel\n                    still remains on bareboat charter to the party liablein\n                        personam. The laws in these jurisdictions are largely uniform\n                    save for that of New Zealand, which permits not only the arrest of the specific\n                    bareboat chartered vessel implicated in the cause of action but also the arrest\n                    of any other vessels which are on bareboat charter to the party who is liablein personam. 5       To bring our laws in line with the other\n                    maritime nations, Singapore amended the HCAJA on 1 April 2004 to permit the\n                    arrest of bareboat chartered vessels (see High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction)\n                    (Amendment) Act 2004 (Act 2 of 2004) (“the 2004 Amendment”)).\n                    Following this amendment, s 4(4) of the HCAJA now reads: (4) In the case of any such claim as is mentioned in section\n                            3(1)(d) to (q), where — (a) the claim arises in connection\n                                with a ship; and (b) the person who would be liable\n                                on the claim in an action in personam (referred to in this\n                                subsection as the relevant person) was, when the cause of action\n                                arose, the owner or charterer of, or in possession or in control of,\n                                the ship, an action in rem may(whether\n                        or not the claim gives rise to a maritime lien on that ship)be brought in the High Court against— (i)that ship, if at the time when the action\n                                    is brought the relevant person iseither the\n                                beneficial owner of that ship as respects all the shares in it orthe charterer of that ship under a charter by\n                                    demise; or (ii) any other ship of which, at the time when the action is\n                                brought, the relevant person is the beneficial owner as respects all\n                                the shares in it. [emphasis added] 6       The hearings before the Assistant Registrar\n                    stretched over a long period of 14 calendar days with the first hearing date on\n                    11 October 2012 and the last almost a year later in September 2013 (seeThe “Chem Orchid”[2014] SGHCR 1\n                    (“the Judgment”)). Unfortunately, much time and effort was\n                    expended on proof of Korean law (which was the governing law under the bareboat\n                    charter), to little end because none of the parties suggested that an\n                    application of the Korean “rules” of contractual interpretation\n                    would have yielded a different result from the application of Singapore law in\n                    this case. Thus, the introduction of expert evidence only served as a\n                    distraction and contributed to the protracted nature of the proceedings. To\n                    avoid a recurrence, I have included acodaon the\n                    use of expert witnesses in the proof of foreign law in this judgment. Hopefully,\n                    this will provide guidance on the circumstances when proof of foreign law is\n                    necessary and on the proper role of expert witnesses in that\n                regard.",
        "The background facts": "",
        "The Lease Agreement between HKC and Sejin": "7       The registered owner of the Vessel at all\n                    material times prior to its court-ordered sale in Singapore was Han Kook Capital\n                    Co Ltd (“HKC”), a Korean incorporated company. On 1 February 2010,\n                    HKC entered into an agreement to lease the Vessel to Sejin Maritime Co Ltd\n                    (“Sejin”), another Korean company, for a total period of 108\n                    months (“the Lease Agreement”). 8       Under the Lease Agreement, Sejin was to pay\n                    monthly rental to HKC on the third day of each month. Sejin was also responsible\n                    for the employment and payment of the crew and for the repair and maintenance of\n                    the Vessel. Sejin was effectively in possession and control of the Vessel and it\n                    is common ground that the Lease Agreement is in substance a charter of the\n                    Vessel by demise. The Lease Agreement also provided that, in the event of any\n                    disagreement as to its interpretation, Korean law shall apply.",
        "The Asset Transfer Agreement and the Notice of Credit\n                Transfer": "9       Sejin complied punctually with its payment\n                    obligations during the initial months of the Lease Agreement but defaulted soon\n                    after. HKC’s representative, Mr Sejun Kim, filed an affidavit in these\n                    proceedings stating that reminders were sent but no rental payments were\n                    received from Sejin after its last payment in October 2010. 10     In December 2010, a new corporate entity known\n                    as HK AMC Co Ltd (“HKA”) was established to deal with the recovery\n                    of bad debts owed to HKC. On 27 December 2010, HKC and HKA executed an Asset\n                    Transfer Agreement (“ATA”) in which the former agreed to sell\n                    certain credits which it had obtained in the course of its business to the\n                    latter at a fair price. The credits under the Lease Agreement were included in\n                    this transfer. 11     To be clear, the ATA did not effect a transfer\n                    of ownership of the Vessel – HKC remained the registered owner of the\n                    Vessel at all times. Further, the ATA did not purport to transfer the entire\n                    Lease Agreement to HKA – it only purported to transfer the credits\n                    thereunder. These points are not disputed by the parties but I should highlight\n                    that their experts disagree on the question of whether theATAhadvalidlytransferred the\n                    lease credits (see [145]–[146] below). 12     I should also mention in this connection that,\n                    prior to the ATA, on 24 December 2010, HKC had issued a Notice of Credit\n                    Transfer (“NCT”) to Sejin in which it informed Sejin of the\n                    arrangement. There was, however, some dispute as to whether the NCT had\n                    transferredmorerights than the ATA. This dispute\n                    centred on paras 3 and 4 of the NCT, which reads: 3. In addition to the Transfer Credit, we [ie, HKC] transferred theright or\n                            statusin our possession or management out of personal or\n                        physical security, right to profit or the other rights incidental to the\n                        Transfer Credit. 4. In spite of the above transfer of Credit, the right, obligation or\n                        status of yours [ie, Sejin] based on the\n                        relating contract, agreement, security arrangement or the other contract\n                        shall remain unchanged andthe right, obligation or the\n                            other statusof ours based on the above contracts shall be\n                        succeeded by the Transferee [ie, HKA] to the\n                        extent of the transfer. [emphasis added] 13     The parties’ experts disagreed on\n                    whether the NCT – in notifying Sejin that HKC had transferred its\n                    “right” or “status” under the Lease Agreement\n                    – conferred upon HKA the right to terminate the Lease Agreement. The\n                    experts’ respective opinions dealt with this point extensively because, as\n                    will become clear, it wasHKA(and not HKC) which\n                    had issued the purported termination notice.",
        "The 4 April Notice": "14     By early April 2011, Sejin had failed to make\n                    any rental payments under the Lease Agreement for a period of six consecutive\n                    months. Mr Sejun Kim described in his affidavit that, at the time, there was no\n                    sign that Sejin would be able to make further payments since the value of the\n                    Vessel had depreciated substantially and the prevailing market conditions for\n                    trading the Vessel were very poor. In his affidavit, Mr Sejun Kim explained that\n                    HKC had “grave concerns” about Sejin’s ability to perform\n                    its obligations under the Lease Agreement and was thus entitled to terminate it\n                    by giving notice to Sejin in accordance with Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement,\n                    which reads: In the event [HKC] is of the opinion that [Sejin] is facing difficulties\n                        in continuing its normal business activities due to any reason whatsoever,\n                        including but not limited to reasons of application for bankruptcy,\n                        compulsory composition or company rehabilitation procedure or work-out,\n                        giving rise to concerns about [Sejin’s] ability to perform its\n                        obligations to [HKC] or to maintain or manage the Vessel, [HKC] may\n                        terminate this Contract with notification specifying the cause towards\n                        [Sejin]. 15     On 4 April 2011, a formal notice with the\n                    heading “Lease contract termination notice” was thus sent to Sejin\n                    (“the 4 April Notice”), informing the latter that it had\n                    “lost all the benefit of time” for repaying its outstanding debts.\n                    As the content of the 4 April Notice is of some importance, I reproduce the\n                    material portions here in full: [Logo] HK AMC Co.

LtdCEO Jaejeong Yoo [seal]16     HKC claimed that the 4 April Notice validly\n                    terminated the Lease Agreement in accordance with Art 24(2). However, it is\n                    important to note that the 4 April Notice was issued byHKArather thanHKC. This, as\n                    mentioned earlier, led the parties’ experts to examine the ATA and NCT\n                    more closely to determine whether HKA, despite being a non-party to the Lease\n                    Agreement, had nevertheless acquired the right to terminate it. A further source\n                    of disagreement among the experts concerned whether (assuming,arguendo, that HKA had the right to terminate the Lease\n                    Agreement) that right was properly exercised in accordance with Art 24(2) of the\n                    Lease Agreement. Chiefly, the disagreement concerned the question of whether the\n                    4 April Notice was defective in failing to specify the “cause” of\n                    the termination towards Sejin. According to some of the experts, the 4 April\n                    Notice did not state the cause for termination and this omission cannot now be\n                    cured by the explanations given by Mr Sejun Kim in his affidavit.Subsequent correspondence and the continued trading of the\n                Vessel17     There was no formal written response from\n                    Sejin to the 4 April Notice. Instead, Mr Sejun Kim stated that he had a meeting\n                    with the Chief Executive Officer of Sejin, Mr Keunhyuk Park (“Mr\n                    Park”), sometime in mid-April 2011 to discuss matters. According to Mr\n                    Sejun Kim, Mr Park asked him whether the termination could be revoked and the\n                    Lease Agreement revived. In response, Mr Sejun Kim replied that the Lease\n                    Agreement had been terminated and that this termination could not be revoked\n                    with a mere promise by Sejin to pay the outstanding rental.18     On 9 May 2011, the Chief Executive Officer of\n                    HKA who signed off on the 4 April Notice, Mr Jaejeong Yoo (“Mr\n                    Yoo”), issued a further notice to Mr Park reiterating that Sejin had\n                    “lost all the benefit of time” for payment of the rental arrears.\n                    In the notice, Mr Yoo demanded immediate payment of sums due as well as the\n                    return of the Vessel by 13 May 2011. However, Sejin failed to do\n                either.19     On 23 May 2011, Sejin wrote in response to\n                    HKA’s 9 May letter. Sejin explained that it had been unable to discharge\n                    its monthly payment obligations because frequent breakdowns of the Vessel had\n                    affected her normal sailing schedule. However, Sejin went on to inform HKA that\n                    it “finally … [had] the opportunity to pay the entire overdue\n                    lease amount” out of freight earnings under certain prospective\n                    sub-charters which it had entered into. The details of these fixtures were\n                    provided to HKA and included a charterparty dated 13 May 2011 which Sejin\n                    had entered into with the plaintiff in Admiralty in Rem No 197 of 2011\n                    (“ADM 197/2011”), Frumentarius Ltd (“Frumentarius”),\n                    for a voyage from Belawan, Indonesia to Taman, Russia. Sejin stated that the\n                    freight earnings from these fixtures would amount to roughly US$1.7m and\n                    requested that the deadline for repayment of the outstanding rental sums be\n                    changed to 17 June 2011. I pause to observe that the charter-hire arrears at\n                    this stage only amounted to 289,430,562 Korean Won (approximately US$261,445.52\n                    at the current exchange rate). Sejin concluded its letter with the following\n                    statement: “If our company cannot keep the above payment promise, we\n                    promise that our company will agree to all the actions your company will take,\n                    and will implement all the instructions related to the ship\n                    retrieval.”20     Sejin did not receive any written response\n                    from either HKC or HKA until 14 June 2011. Sejin continued to trade using the\n                    Vessel in the intervening period and, on 31 May 2011, provided HKA with a\n                    written update that the Vessel had entered Belawan and was in the process of\n                    loading palm oil cargo. Sejin also stated that the Vessel would proceed next to\n                    Dumai, Indonesia for additional loading before heading towards the Mediterranean\n                    Sea and then the Black Sea for discharge. Neither HKC nor HKA reacted to\n                    Sejin’s advice on the Vessel’s loading schedule in spite of the\n                    purported termination of the Lease Agreement.21     In accordance with the itinerary outlined in\n                    Sejin’s letter, the Vessel completed loading three parcels of palm oil\n                    cargo at Belawan on 4 June 2011. The cargo was owned by the plaintiff in\n                    Admiralty in Rem No 198 of 2011 (“ADM 198/2011”), a Russian\n                    company known as KRC Efko-Kaskad LLC (“KRC”). KRC had\n                    sub-chartered the Vessel from Frumentarius for carriage of its goods to Taman.\n                    The Vessel then proceeded to Dumai, where she completed loading an additional\n                    parcel of palm oil cargo on 11 June 2011 owned by the plaintiff in Admiralty in\n                    Rem No 201 of 2011 (“ADM 201/2011”), a Swiss company known as\n                    Mercuria Energy Trading SA (“Mercuria”), to be shipped to Huelva,\n                    Spain. On 13 June 2011, while at Dumai, the Vessel also stemmed bunkers which\n                    were supplied by the plaintiff in Admiralty in Rem No 184 of 2011 (“ADM\n                    184/2011”), Winplus Corporation Co Ltd\n                (“Winplus”).22     On 14 June 2011, HKA issued a formal written\n                    response to Sejin’s letter dated 23 May 2011. In this response, HKA made\n                    reference to the 4 April Notice and its letter of 9 May 2011 and stated that, in\n                    light of Sejin’s non-compliance with the demands for payment and return of\n                    the Vessel, Sejin’s conduct was “an embezzlement and subject to\n                    criminal penalty”. HKA further stated that it could not fully accept\n                    Sejin’s request to postpone the deadline for repayment and then set out a\n                    number of conditions which Sejin had to fulfil if it wanted to revive the Lease\n                    Agreement. Despite HKA’s position, however, the Vessel was neither\n                    redelivered nor was payment of the arrears made by Sejin. Instead the Vessel\n                    proceeded from Dumai to Singapore where she arrived on 16 June 2011. On 30 June\n                    2011, the Vessel took on more bunkers, which were also supplied by\n                    Winplus.23     In his affidavit, Mr Sejun Kim stated that he\n                    had learnt of the Vessel’s presence in Singapore from Mr Park on 29 June\n                    2011 and HKA immediately sent out a final notice for its redelivery. Sejin\n                    responded in a letter dated 4 July 2011 stating,inter\n                        alia, that it was not intentionally delaying the return of the\n                    Vessel and elaborating, “[w]e wanted to return the ship safely through\n                    the ship’s normal sailing route, but the situation does not allow us to do\n                    that so far”. On 15 July 2011, Sejin sent a further letter to Mr Sejun\n                    Kim which, while pertaining mostly to the description of certain transhipment\n                    arrangements, also contained the following statement: “we will do our\n                    best to return the ship to Korea as soon as possible.”The arrest and sale of the Vessel24     Despite Sejin’s express desire toeventuallyredeliver the Vessel to HKC, that\n                    was never in fact done because, on 28 July 2011, Winplus filed anin remwrit against the Vessel to commence ADM 184/2011\n                    and arrested her in Singapore on the same day. Winplus’ invocation of the\n                    court’s admiralty jurisdiction was based on its claim solely against\n                    Sejin, the demise charterer of the Vessel, for the unpaid bunkers which were\n                    supplied in Dumai and in Singapore.25     On 8 August 2011, three furtherin remwrits commencing ADM 197/2011, ADM 198/2011\n                    and ADM 201/2011 were issued against the Vessel by Frumentarius, KRC, and\n                    Mercuria respectively. All three writs named the owners and/or demise charterers\n                    of the Vessel as defendant. Frumentarius’ claim was for the loss or damage\n                    arising from the breach of the charterparty entered into with Sejin, while KRC\n                    and Mercuria’s claims arose from the non-delivery of their cargoes to\n                    Taman and Huelva respectively.26     Between 22 and 23 August 2011, HKC entered\n                    appearances in all thein remactions as the\n                    registered owner of the Vessel. Sejin did not enter any\n                appearances.27     On 7 October 2011, after the parties with\n                    cargo remaining on board the Vessel had arranged for their transhipment, the\n                    court ordered the Vessel to be appraised and sold. As the bids received did not\n                    meet the Vessel’s appraised value, the court approved of its sale below\n                    the appraised value on 23 December 2011.The applications by HKCHKC’s setting aside applications28     On 29 February 2012, HKC filed similar\n                    applications in all four admiralty actions seeking,inter\n                        alia, to set aside the writs and all subsequent proceedings taken\n                    in these actions on the basis that the court’sin\n                        remjurisdiction had not been properly invoked.29     The crux of HKC’s case both here and\n                    below was that the Lease Agreement had been terminated by the 4 April Noticepriorto the issuance of thein remwrits in all the actions. If HKC’s\n                    submission is correct, the plaintiffs would fail in establishing a crucial\n                    jurisdictional fact under s 4(4)(b)(i) of the\n                    HCAJA,viz, that Sejin, as “the relevant\n                    person”, was the bareboat charterer of the Vessel at the time when the\n                    various actions were brought. If that is so, the writs must be set aside on the\n                    basis that the court had no jurisdiction.30     The plaintiffs strenuously denied that the\n                    Lease Agreement had already been terminated at the time their respective actions\n                    were commenced. Their arguments (both here and below) proceeded along the\n                    following lines:(a)     First, HKA had merely been\n                        transferred a right to claim the credits under the Lease Agreement and had\n                        not, whether by way of the NCT or the ATA, acquired a right to terminate the\n                        same. Thus, the 4 April Notice issued by HKA was ineffective in\n                        purporting to terminate the Lease Agreement.(b)     Second, even if HKA had the right to terminate\n                        the Lease Agreement, the 4 April Notice was nevertheless ineffective because\n                        it failed to comply with certain requirements under Art 24(2), such as the\n                        specification of the relevant “cause” for\n                    termination.(c)     Third,\n                        the plaintiffs further submitted that a bareboat charter could generally be\n                        brought to an end only upon physical redelivery of the vessel. Thus, the\n                        Vessel in this case, having never been physically redelivered, still\n                        remained on bareboat charter to Sejin when thein\n                            remwrits were issued.HKC’s striking out applications31     As mentioned earlier, two of the four writs\n                    contained alternative claims brought directly against HKC as the registered\n                    owner of the Vessel. These were the writs issued by the cargo interests, KRC and\n                    Mercuria, in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011 respectively. They claimed that\n                    (even if the Lease Agreement had been terminated by the 4 April Notice)in personamliability attached to HKC, who, in\n                    permitting cargo to be loaded and in permitting the master to issue bills of\n                    lading for the same, had clothed the master with ostensible authority to bind\n                    HKC as the registered owner of the Vessel. If this is correct, then the\n                    court’s admiralty jurisdiction would have been properly invoked as against\n                    HKC since there is no question that HKC, as “the relevant person”\n                    in this alternative claim, remained the registered owner of the Vessel at the\n                    time when these actions were brought.32     In its applications filed in ADM 198/2011 and\n                    ADM 201/2011, HKC sought to strike out these alternative claims under O 18 r 19\n                    of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) and/or\n                    the inherent jurisdiction of the court.The decision below33     The Assistant Registrar’s decision may\n                    be summarised as follows:(a)     In respect of HKC’s setting\n                        aside applications, the Assistant Registrar held that the Lease Agreement\n                        was terminatedpriorto the issuance of the\n                        writs. Hence, the court’s admiralty jurisdiction was wrongly invoked\n                        insofar as they were based on Sejin’sin\n                            personamliability. She reasoned thus:(i)       First, although the ATA\n                            and/or the NCT did not transfer HKC’s right to terminate the Lease\n                            Agreement to HKA, HKA was nevertheless impliedly or apparently\n                            authorised to issue the 4 April Notice for and on behalf of HKC based on\n                            the conduct of the parties (see the Judgment at [42],\n                            [46]–[48]).(ii)       The 4 April Notice complied with Art 24(2) of\n                            the Lease Agreement (see the Judgment at [64]). In particular, the\n                            “cause” for termination,viz, Sejin’s non-payment of rental arrears, was\n                            sufficiently clear from the 4 April Notice and this was borne out by,inter alia, the background against\n                            which this notice had been sent and the parties’ subsequent\n                            correspondence which showed that Sejin did not question or challenge the\n                            termination (see the Judgment at [67]–[69]).(iii)       The 4 April Notice was\n                            not sufficient on its own, however, to terminate the Lease Agreement. At\n                            common law, a bareboat charter was brought to an end only when the\n                            vessel had been physically redelivered and even though this general rule\n                            could be contracted out of by the parties, the terms of the Lease\n                            Agreement in this case made it clear that physical redelivery of the\n                            Vessel was required for effective termination (see the Judgment at [112]\n                            and [122]).(iv)       Notwithstanding the need for physical\n                            redelivery, a bareboat chartered ship could beconstructivelyredelivered if there was “some\n                            step or acknowledgment by the charterer to give effect to the\n                            redelivery” (see the Judgment at [126]). In this regard, Mr\n                            Park’s acknowledgment at his meeting with Mr Sejun Kim in\n                            mid-April 2011 that the 4 April Notice was a notice of termination\n                            constituted constructive redelivery of the Vessel (see the Judgment at\n                            [129]). Alternatively, Sejin’s declarations of intent to redeliver\n                            the Vessel on 4 and 15 July 2011 were also sufficient to effect\n                            constructive redelivery. The Lease Agreement had therefore terminated on\n                            15 July 2011 at the latest (see the Judgment at\n                            [136]–[137]).(b)     In respect of HKC’s application to strike out KRC\n                        and Mercuria’ s alternative claims in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011,\n                        the Assistant Registrar found that these claims were not so legally and\n                        factually unsustainable as to warrant being struck out. If it were accepted\n                        that the Lease Agreement had been terminated by mid-April 2011, then HKC\n                        could have made it clear that Sejin no longer had the authority to load\n                        further cargoes and issue bills of lading. It was also open to HKC to take\n                        steps to recover possession of the Vessel but it did not do so. In light of\n                        the foregoing, HKC indirectly represented to shippers (such as KRC and\n                        Mercuria) that Sejin had the authority to bind HKC to the bills of lading\n                        which were issued at the material time (see the Judgment at\n                    [153]).The present appeals34     The plaintiffs all appealed against the\n                    Assistant Registrar’s decision to set aside their respectivein remwrits. They argued that Sejin was still the\n                    demise charterer at the time their actions were commenced. Their appeals are as\n                    follows:(a)     Registrar’s Appeal No 426 of\n                        2013 (“RA 426/2013”) is Winplus’ appeal in ADM\n                        184/2011;(b)     Registrar’s Appeal No 1 of 2014 (“RA 1/2014”) is\n                        Frumentarius’ appeal in ADM 197/2011;(c)     Registrar’s Appeal No 2 of 2014\n                        (“RA 2/2014”) is KRC’s appeal in ADM 198/2011;\n                        and(d)     Registrar’s Appeal No 6 of 2014 (“RA 6/2014”) is\n                        Mercuria’s appeal in ADM 201/2011.35     HKC also cross-appealed against the dismissal\n                    of its striking out applications against KRC and Mercuria’s alternative\n                    claims:(a)     Registrar’s Appeal No 7 of\n                        2014 (“RA 7/2014”) is HKC’s appeal in ADM 201/2011;\n                        and(b)     Registrar’s Appeal No 8 of 2014 (“RA 8/2014”) is\n                        HKC’s appeal in ADM 198/2011.The plaintiffs’ appeals36     I begin by considering the plaintiffs’\n                    appeals against the Assistant Registrar’s decision to set aside theirin remactions on the basis that Sejin was no\n                    longer the demise charterer at the commencement of these actions. The Court of\n                    Appeal has made clear inThe “Bunga Melati\n                        5”[2012] 4 SLR 546 (“The Bunga\n                        Melati”) at [112] that when there is a challenge to the\n                    invocation of the court’s admiralty jurisdiction, the onus is on the\n                    arresting party to discharge the following burdens under s 4(4) of the\n                    HCAJA:(a) prove,on the balance of probabilities,\n                        that the jurisdictional facts under the limb it is relying on in s\n                            3(1)(d) to 3(1)(q) exist; and showan arguable\n                            casethat its claim is of the type or nature required by the\n                        relevant statutory provision (\"step 1\");(b) prove,on the balance of probabilities,\n                        that the claim arises in connection with a ship (\"step 2\");(c) identify,without having to show in\n                            argument, the person who would be liable on the claim in an\n                        actionin personam[ie, the “relevant person”] (\"step 3\");(d) proveon the balance of probabilities,\n                        that the relevant person was, when the cause of action arose, the owner or\n                        charterer of, or in possession or in control of, the ship (\"step 4\");\n                        and(e)proveon the balance\n                            of probabilities, that the relevant person\n                            was, at the time when the action was brought: (i) the\n                        beneficial owner of the offending ship as respects all the shares in it orthe charterer of that ship under a demise\n                            charter; or (ii) the beneficial owner of the sister ship as\n                        respects all the shares in it (\"step 5\").[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold]37     In the context of the plaintiffs’\n                    appeals, all parties agreed that the “relevant person” under step\n                    3 is Sejin and that the dispute centres only on step 5: was Sejin, on a balance\n                    of probabilities, still the demise charterer of the Vessel at the time the fourin remactions were brought?38     The parties’ arguments on appeal were\n                    broadly similar to what they had advanced below and may be briefly summarised.\n                    On one hand, HKC submitted that the 4 April Notice issued by HKA constituted a\n                    valid and sufficient termination under Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement. Thus,\n                    HKC argued that Sejin was not the demise charterer of the Vessel at the time the\n                    writs were brought. On the other hand, the plaintiffs submitted that the 4 April\n                    Notice was invalid because,inter alia, HKA did\n                    not have the right to terminate the Lease Agreement. They also submitted, in the\n                    alternative, that physical redelivery of the Vessel was essential for the\n                    termination of the Lease Agreement and yet this was never done. The plaintiffs\n                    also submitted that the doctrine of constructive delivery, which the Assistant\n                    Registrar had recognised and applied, ought not to be a part of our law. In the\n                    result, they argued that Sejin was still the demise charterer of the Vessel at\n                    the time the writs were brought.39     These arguments raise the following\n                    sub-issues, each of which I will deal with in turn:(a)     Was HKA’s issuance of the 4\n                        April Notice a valid contractual termination of the Lease Agreement under\n                        Art 24(2) (“the contractual termination\n                    issue”)?(b)     Was\n                        physical redelivery of the Vesselfurtherrequired to bring about effective termination (“the physical\n                        redelivery issue”)?(c)     If so, should Sejin nonetheless be regarded as having\n                        constructively redelivered the Vessel (“the constructive redelivery\n                        issue”)?The contractual termination issue40     Before proceeding to examine the merits of the\n                    contractual termination issue, there is a preliminary point that needs to be\n                    disposed of. Sejin, in its correspondence with HKC/HKA, did not appear to\n                    challenge the validity of the termination under Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement\n                    and has not entered appearance in these proceedings to do so. This raises the\n                    question of whetherthe plaintiffs, as strangers\n                    to the Lease Agreement, can question the validity of its termination given that\n                    this has not been challenged bySejin.41     As I have stressed at the outset, the question\n                    of termination is not merely a contractual issue affecting the immediate\n                    contracting parties,ie, Sejin and HKC. It has a\n                    pivotal bearing on the jurisdiction of this court in respect of the fourin remwrits issued against Sejin. There is no\n                    dispute that questions affecting the jurisdiction of the court are to be\n                    determined by thelex fori(seeThe “Kapitan Temkin”[1998] 2 SLR(R) 537).\n                    HKC’s reliance on the bald opinion of its expert witness (Prof In Hyeon\n                    Kim (“Prof Kim”)) that “the Korean court is unlikely to\n                    accept any objection from a third party such as Winplus where the parties to the\n                    Lease Agreement and the Notice of Transfer are not questioning the same”\n                    is unhelpful. In my view, on issues that go to the root of the court’s\n                    jurisdiction, it is entirely appropriate for the court to examine the objective\n                    evidence in order to be satisfied as to whether jurisdiction has been made\n                    out.42     The admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court\n                    is conferred by statute and exists where the requisite statutory conditions have\n                    been satisfied; it cannot be conferred by the agreement or waiver of the parties\n                    if it does not exist under the HCAJA (seeThe “Ohm\n                        Mariana” ex “Peony”[1992] 1 SLR(R) 556\n                    at [15] andThe “Alexandrea”[2002] 1 SLR(R) 812 at [10]–[11]). Similarly, the admiralty jurisdiction\n                    of this court exists in this case only if the requisite statutory conditions\n                    have been satisfied (ie, if Sejin was the demise\n                    charterer at the time the writs were brought). HKC’s submission that the\n                    doctrine of privity of contract would preclude the plaintiffs from challenging\n                    the termination, with respect, misses the point. The issue here is one of\n                    jurisdiction and not one of contract. The plaintiffs were not seeking, as\n                    non-parties, to sue on the Lease Agreement (which is a purely contractual\n                    point). Rather, they were seeking to show that the court has jurisdiction in\n                    this matter because the Lease Agreement was still valid when thein remwrits were issued – that is a\n                    jurisdictional issue. I agree that it is open to the plaintiffs to challenge the\n                    validity of the termination so as to establish jurisdiction in aid of the\n                    enforcement of their respective claims notwithstanding Sejin’s apparent\n                    acceptance of the termination.43     Counsel for Winplus, Ms Yogarajah Sharmini\n                    (“Ms Sharmini”), helpfully drew my attention to two cases where\n                    the validity of the termination of the bareboat charters was examined by the\n                    court on points not pursued by the bareboat charterers. InShips “Hako Endeavour”, “Hako Excel”,\n                        “Hako Esteem” and “Hako Fortress” v Programmed\n                        Total Marine Services Pty Ltd(2013) 296 ALR 265\n                        (“The Hako Fortress”), the\n                    arresting party (not the bareboat charterer) argued that the notice of\n                    termination was invalid as it was served at an address different from that\n                    specified in the bareboat charter. Similarly inASP Holdings\n                        Ltd v Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd(2006) 235 ALR 554\n                        (“ASP Holdings”), the arresting\n                    party attacked the validity of the termination notice on points which were not\n                    raised by the administrator of the bareboat charterer. In both cases, the court\n                    nonetheless examined the points raised by the arresting parties to determine\n                    whether the bareboat charters had been validly terminated pursuant to the\n                    notices. In the case ofThe Hako Fortress, the\n                    court held that the notice was valid while inASP\n                        Holdings, the court accepted the argument raised by the arresting\n                    party and found the notice to be invalid. These cases illustrate that the\n                    validity of a termination notice – which has a material impact on\n                    jurisdiction – can and must be examined by the court notwithstanding the\n                    fact that the bareboat charterer might have accepted the termination as being\n                    valid.(1)   HKA did not acquire the right to terminate the Lease\n                Agreement under the ATA and/or the NCT44     The contractual termination issue received\n                    much attention by the experts. Much ink was spilled on the question whether the\n                    right to terminate the Lease Agreement had been transferred under the ATA and/or\n                    the NCT. On this issue, I agree with the Assistant Registrar that the ATA did\n                    not purport to transfer the right of termination from HKC to HKA and that the\n                    only asset which was transferred thereunder was the credit payable to HKC under\n                    the Lease Agreement. On this score, there can be no dispute that the right to\n                    terminate was not transferred under the ATA. I also agree with the Assistant\n                    Registrar that the NCT could not be relied on by HKA to terminate the Lease\n                    Agreement since it served merely as a notice to Sejin of the intended credit\n                    transfer and could not transfermorerights than\n                    was transferred under the ATA. In this context, it is pertinent to note that the\n                    NCT was servedpriorto the execution of the ATA.\n                    Accordingly the operative instrument which dealt with the transfer of the\n                    “assets” was the ATA and no more.(2)   The requisite opinion under Art 24(2) must have been formed\n                by HKC45     The Assistant Registrar, having arrived at the\n                    above finding, then proceeded to find that HKA had implied and/or apparent\n                    authority to issue the 4 April Notice on behalf of HKC. This is where I part\n                    company with the Assistant Registrar’s reasoning. I am of the view that\n                    this inquiry is premature. Instead, I am of the view that a more fundamental\n                    question arises from the plain wording of Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement.\n                    Article 24(2) was set out earlier but I reproduce it again for ease of\n                    reference:In the event [HKC] is of the opinion that[Sejin] is facing difficulties in continuing its normal business activities\n                        due to any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to reasons of\n                        application for bankruptcy, compulsory composition or company rehabilitation\n                        procedure or work-out, giving rise to concerns about [Sejin’s] ability\n                        to perform its obligations to [HKC] or to maintain or manage the Vessel,[HKC] may terminate this Contract with notification\n                            specifying the causetowards [Sejin]. [emphasis added]46     It is clear that there are two conditions\n                    precedent to the exercise of the right of termination under Art 24(2). First, it\n                    is necessary forHKCto form anopinionthat Sejin is unable to carry on with its normal\n                    business activities. Second, HKC must specify thecausefor the formation of theopinionin the notification sent to Sejin. I shall deal with the\n                    second condition later. For now, I observe that the first condition premises the\n                    right to termination on the formation of a subjective,bona\n                        fideopinion byHKCregarding\n                    Sejin’s circumstances and the viability of the Lease Agreement. However,\n                    there was simply no evidence by any of the experts (whether under Korean law or\n                    otherwise) that this requirement could be satisfied upon proof thatHKA(and notHKC) had\n                    formed the requisite opinion.47     The Privy Council’s decision inLoke Hong Kee (S) Pte Ltd v United Overseas Land\n                        Ltd[1981–1982] SLR(R) 424 (“Loke\n                        Hong Kee”), which arose on appeal from a decision of the\n                    Court of Appeal in Singapore, is apposite. In that case, the court had to\n                    consider a clause in a building contract which entitled the respondent employer\n                    to determine the appellant contractor’s employment if,inter alia, the works were “in the opinion of the\n                    [respondent’s] architect unsatisfactory”. Lord Keith of Kinkel\n                    (delivering the judgment of the Board) interpreted this particular provision at\n                    [11] as follows:… The phrase \"in the opinion of the architect unsatisfactory\" which\n                        appears in art V(3) carries the kind of subjective connotation which is\n                        necessarily associated with words expressive of satisfaction or\n                        dissatisfaction.It is the view of the particular\n                            architectas to what is or is not satisfactory which is to be\n                        the criterion, not any objective standard. … [emphasis added]48     The lack of any evidence to suggest that HKC\n                    had formed the requisite opinion when the 4 April Notice was issued is therefore\n                    an insuperable barrier to HKC’s present claim that the Lease Agreement was\n                    validly terminated by HKA in accordance with Art 24(2). I note that Mr Sejun Kim\n                    filed an affidavit on HKC’s behalf in these proceedings to state that HKC\n                    had indeed been gravely concerned about Sejin’s continued performance of\n                    the Lease Agreement at the material time (see [14] above). He elaborated that\n                    several factors were responsible for HKC arriving at this view,viz, (a) Sejin’s failure to make rental payments\n                    for a period of six months; (b) the Vessel’s substantial depreciation in\n                    value; and (c) the extremely bad worldwide market conditions for trading the\n                    Vessel. However, apart from the non-payment of rental arrears, the two other\n                    points were not stated in the 4 April Notice. Further, Mr Sejun Kim’s\n                    assertions were not supported by any sort of contemporaneous evidence: there\n                    was, for example, no email or other written evidence showing that HKC had formed\n                    and communicated such opinion to HKA before the latter proceeded to issue the 4\n                    April Notice. This may be usefully contrasted withLoke Hong\n                        Keewhere there was clear evidence at [6]–[7] that the\n                    respondent had only exercised its right to terminate the appellant’s\n                    employment after receiving a letter from its architect explaining the basis of\n                    his opinion that the progress of the works was unsatisfactory. Mr Sejun\n                    Kim’s assertions, it should be added, were also not supported by any\n                    affidavit from Mr Yoo of HKA confirming that the purported termination by HKA\n                    had indeed been exercised on the basis of HKC’s opinion.49     I observe that Prof Kim had stated in his\n                    first opinion that, given the circumstances described by Mr Sejun Kim, there was\n                    “enough for HKC to form its view” to terminate the Lease Agreement\n                    under Art 24(2) (see [139] below). Whether or not Sejin’s circumstances\n                    were serious enough to warrant termination in HKC’s opinion is irrelevant.\n                    The pertinent question is whetherHKCdid,in fact, form such an opinion. This point is,\n                    self-evidently, something which only HKC can know and which therefore only HKC\n                    can make good through the evidence of its authorised representatives. Prof Kim\n                    had been offered as an expert witness. He was not a factual witness who had been\n                    called to give evidence on HKC’s behalf. Accordingly, it was entirely out\n                    of bounds for Prof Kim to expresshis own opinionas to what would constitute circumstances serious enough forHKCto form an opinion that the Lease Agreement should be\n                    terminated. I further observe that Prof Kim had also gone on to express in his\n                    second opinion that even if HKA did not have the express right to terminate the\n                    Lease Agreement in issuing the 4 April Notice, HKA was nevertheless authorised\n                    to do so for and on behalf of HKC (see [142] below). It bears repeating that\n                    this is a matter which Prof Kim has no personal knowledge of. In fact, his\n                    opinion on this issue was completely without foundation because there is nothing\n                    on the face of the 4 April Notice to suggest that HKA was issuing it on behalf\n                    of HKC. Ultimately, Prof Kim’s apparent zeal to cover all bases in support\n                    of HKC’s position here has, in my assessment, served only to compromise\n                    his standing as an expert.50     In summary,even\n                        ifHKA were authorised to terminate the Lease Agreement (as the\n                    Assistant Registrar had gone on to find), it could only do so under Art 24(2) if\n                    HKC had formed the requisite opinion, but there is no evidence on which I am\n                    able to conclude that it did. Thus, the 4 April Notice did not validly terminate\n                    the Lease Agreement under Art 24(2). Nevertheless, before I leave this point, I\n                    should express some views on the Assistant Registrar’s finding of\n                    HKA’s apparent authority to issue the 4 April Notice (see [33(a)(i)]\n                    above). She correctly cited relevant authority to demonstrate that, for apparent\n                    authority to arise, there must be: (a) a representation by the principal to a\n                    third party that the agent had the authority to enter into the transaction on\n                    its behalf; and (b) reliance by the third party on the principal’s\n                    representation.51     However it must be emphasised that the\n                    doctrine of apparent authority is typically relied onby a\n                        third partyto prevent the principal from resiling from\n                    transactions entered into by the agent. The doctrine isnotopen to be invokedby the\n                        principalas a means of retrospectively legitimising or\n                    validating the otherwise unauthorised acts of its agent in the absence of\n                    ratification. The doctrine of apparent authority has therefore been described in\n                    G E Dal Pont,Law of Agency(LexisNexis\n                    Butterworths, 3rd Ed, 2014) (“Dal\n                    Pont”) at para 20.3 as having a “negative” as\n                    opposed to “positive” impact. This can be traced to the widespread\n                    judicial acceptance of its theoretical underpinning in the doctrine ofestoppel(see,eg,Rama Corporation Ld v Proved Tin and General Investments\n                        Ld[1952] 2 QB 147 at 149;Freeman &\n                        Lockyer (a firm) v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd and\n                        another[1964] 2 QB 480 at 503;ING Re (UK)\n                        Ltd v R&V Versicherung AG[2006] 2 All ER (Comm) 870 at\n                    [99]). Hence, the doctrine of apparent authority has erstwhile been referred to\n                    as “agency by estoppel” (seeThe Law of\n                        Contract in Singapore(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy\n                    Publishing, 2012) (“The Law of Contract in\n                        Singapore”) at para 15.040). Once it is recognised that\n                    apparent authority is based on estoppel, the uni-directional manner of its\n                    operation becomes clear: it may be called in aid by a third party to prevent the\n                    principal from denying the authority of his agent which he has represented to be\n                    genuine but, crucially for present purposes, it does not allow the principal to\n                    positively assert or rely on the apparent authority of his agent to improve his\n                    position. Many commentators have therefore stated that a principal may not rely\n                    on the apparent authority of its agent toenforcea contract which the latter has entered into (see Peter Watts and F M B\n                    Reynolds,Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency(Sweet\n                    & Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2014) at para 8-029; Roderick Munday,Agency: Law and Principles(Oxford University Press,\n                    2nd Ed, 2013) at para 4.49;The Law of Contract in\n                        Singaporeat para 15.044;Dal Pontat para 20.3). I do not see why the outcome should be any different where the\n                    principal seeks to rely on the same to argue that such a contract has beenterminatedto his advantage.52     For the reasons stated above, I find that,\n                    with respect, the Assistant Registrar erred in her application of the doctrine\n                    of apparent authority. HKC (the apparent principal) cannot rely on HKA’s\n                    apparent authority to issue the 4 April Notice to assert that the Lease\n                    Agreement had been validly terminated.(3)   Sejin’s non-payment of rentalsimpliciteris a cause for termination under Art 24(1) and not Art\n                24(2)53     In my view, there is a further difficulty with\n                    HKC’s argument that the 4 April Notice validly terminated the Lease\n                    Agreement under Art 24(2). According to para 3 of the 4 April Notice, it appears\n                    that HKA relied on the fact that Sejin had “lost all the benefit of time\n                    of debt” as the basis for asserting its right of termination under Art\n                    24(2) against HKA (see [15] above). The experts disagreed as to whether this\n                    sufficiently specified the “cause” of termination as required\n                    under Art 24(2). That dispute led the Assistant Registrar to consider the\n                    conduct of the parties prior to and subsequent to the issuance of the notice to\n                    determine whether Sejin was under any confusion as to the cause for the\n                    termination. However, I consider that the 4 April Notice is beset with a more\n                    fundamental problem. It appears to me that the purported reason given,viz, Sejin’s non-payment of rental arrearssimpliciter, cannot even trigger the right to\n                    terminate underArt 24(2)to begin with. Let me\n                    explain.54     Article 24(2) is a general provision which\n                    allows for the termination of the Lease Agreement. It is preceded by Art 24(1),\n                    which sets out aseparateprocedure for\n                    terminating the Lease Agreement predicated on the occurrence of certain clearly\n                    defined events. Article 24(1) is a lengthy provision but it suffices for me to\n                    reproduce only the following portion:Article 24 (Termination of\n                            contract)1. [Sejin] shall notify\n                        immediately in the event of any of following [sic] has been caused by [Sejin] or its joint guarantor. Once\n                        [HKC] acknowledges that any of the following items were caused by [Sejin],\n                        regardless of receiving notifications,[HKC] shall notify\n                            [Sejin] to rectify the cause within 10 days. This contract can be\n                            terminated if the cause is not rectified within the period.\n                        However, the contract can be terminated immediately for item 8 to 14.(1)More than one delay in payment as\n                                    required by the contract from [Sejin] to [HKC].…[emphasis added]55     Article 24(1) of the Lease Agreement sets out\n                    a clear schema for an exercise of the right of termination. It lists a total of\n                    14 specific events. If the first seven are present, it is unambiguously stated\n                    that HKC shall issue arectification noticeto\n                    Sejin and it is only if Sejin fails to make the necessary rectification after\n                    the expiry of a ten day period that the right to termination arises. For the\n                    next seven, HKC has the right toimmediatetermination without needing to give Sejin a period of time to make\n                    rectification.56     Sejin’s failure to make its monthly\n                    rental payments timeously falls within the former category of events. In my\n                    view, the comprehensive list of events as set out in Art 24(1) of the Lease\n                    Agreement shows that the parties had painstakingly addressed their minds to the\n                    situations in which termination should be preceded by the issuance of a prior\n                    rectification notice and those which should give rise to an immediate right of\n                    termination. The failure to make timely payment of rental belongs to the former\n                    category. Holding that this same ground, without more, can nevertheless provide\n                    cause forimmediateterminationwithout prior noticeunder Art 24(2) would render Art 24(1)\n                    otiose and would remove from Sejin a contractual safeguard against immediate\n                    termination which – on a proper construction of the termination regime in\n                    Art 24 – it appears the parties intended for Sejin to\n                have.57     This begs the question: what, then, is the\n                    ambit of Art 24(2)? Article 24(2) appears to be worded quite broadly: it states\n                    that the Lease Agreement may be terminated in the event that HKC is “of\n                    the opinion that [Sejin] is facing difficulties in continuing its normal\n                    business activitiesdue to any reason\n                    whatsoever… [HKC] may terminate\n                    this contract with notification specifying the cause towards [Sejin]”\n                    [emphasis added]. However, one must be careful not to place undue emphasis on\n                    this italicised phrase or divorce it from the rest of the clause. The\n                    “cause” (which Sejin must be notified of) is notanyreason underlying the termination at large. Instead,\n                    on my interpretation of Art 24(2), the “cause” mustspecificallyrefer to the reason why HKC has formed its\n                    opinion that Sejin “is facing difficulties in continuing its normal\n                    business activities”. And, in this connection, it is of some significance\n                    that Art 24(2) has enumerated by way of illustration a list of events that might\n                    make it difficult for Sejin to continue its normal business activities,eg, application of bankruptcy, compulsory\n                    composition, and company rehabilitation procedure. While these reasons are\n                    expressly stated to be non-exhaustive, their collocation discloses the\n                    parties’ intentions that the particular reason relied on for termination\n                    under Art 24(2)without prior noticemust bear\n                    some relation toSejin’s ability to operate as a going\n                        concern.Properly construed, Sejin’s mere inability to pay\n                    its debts to HKCsimpliciterdoes not fall within\n                    this category. Instead, that event is governed by Art 24(1) which specifically\n                    provides that termination on this ground must be preceded by a rectification\n                    notice.58     For completeness, I will add that there is no\n                    evidence before the court that, at any time prior to the 4 April Notice, Sejin\n                    had been sent any notices to effect immediate rectification. Thus, there is no\n                    basis for concluding (and neither did HKC raise such a point) that the Lease\n                    Agreement had been terminated under Art 24(1).(4)   Conclusion59     In summary, I find that the 4 April Notice was\n                    invalid for three reasons. First, HKA had not been transferred the right of\n                    termination and therefore could not have terminated the Lease Agreement under\n                    Art 24(2). Second, a valid termination under Art 24(2) is premised on HKC having\n                    first formed an opinion that Sejin could not continue its normal business\n                    activities. On the facts, HKC had not formed such an opinion. Third, the\n                    non-payment of rental arrearssimpliciteris not a\n                    “cause” that gives rise to a right of immediate termination under\n                    Art 24(2). In the premises, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that\n                    Sejin remained the demise charterer under the Lease Agreement at the time the\n                    plaintiffs’ respectivein remactions were\n                    commenced. Hence I allow the plaintiffs’ appeals against the Assistant\n                    Registrar’s order to set aside the fourin\n                        remwrits. There is strictly no need for me to consider the\n                    remaining two issues which I had outlined earlier at [39] but, as I heard\n                    extensive submissions on both these matters, I will proceed to express my views\n                    on them.The physical redelivery issue60     Assuming that the 4 April Notice constituted a\n                    valid notice of termination, the question then arises as to whether the notice\n                    itself was sufficient to terminate the Lease Agreement or whether Sejin was\n                    nevertheless additionally required to physically redeliver the Vessel to bring\n                    the Lease Agreement to an end. In more general terms, is physical redelivery\n                    necessary to terminate a bareboat charter?61     This is a novel question of law insofar as\n                    Singapore is concerned but it has been judicially considered in several other\n                    Commonwealth jurisdictions, notably, in Australia (seePatrick Stevedores No 2 Pty Ltd v MV “Turakina”(1998) 154 ALR 666 (“The Turakina”),CMC (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Ship “Socofl\n                        Stream”[1999] FCA 1419 (“The\n                        Socofl Stream (jurisdiction)”),ASP\n                        Holdings,The Hako Fortress), New\n                    Zealand (seeThe “Rangiora”,\n                        “Ranginui” and “Takitimu”[2000] 1\n                    Lloyd’s Rep 36 (“The\n                    Rangiora”)) and Hong Kong (seeGulf Marine\n                        and Industrial Supplies Inc v The Demise Charterers of the Ship or Vessel MV\n                        ‘Trident Dawn’ (Qatar Flag)[1992] HKCFI 273). The\n                    Assistant Registrar undertook an extensive survey of these cases and eventually\n                    arrived at the following view on the state of the law regarding the need for\n                    physical redelivery (see the Judgment at [112]):… I am of the view that the guiding principle that may be drawn\n                        from the above authorities is that,in general, both a\n                            notice of termination and redelivery of the ship are required to\n                            terminate a demise charterparty so that control and possession by the\n                            demise charterer may be brought to an end. This is due to the\n                        unique nature of the demise charterparty. However, as a demise charterparty\n                        is in essence a contract between the owner and the charterer,parties are free to include terms in the demise charterparty as\n                            to how possession of the ship is to be terminated. Such terms may vary\n                            or affect the obligation of redelivery upon the termination of a demise\n                            charterparty.This is the common thread that may be found to\n                        run through all the cases considered on this issue. [emphasis added]62     According to the Assistant Registrar, two\n                    clear propositions emerge from the cases. First, as a general rule, physical\n                    redelivery is necessary to terminate a bareboat charter and, second, parties may\n                    contract out of this rule through the use of specific provisions in the bareboat\n                    charter itself. I agree with the first but not the second.63     I should mention that in their submissions on\n                    the physical redelivery issue, the parties relied on the common law and not on\n                    Korean law. Counsel for HKC, Mr Henry Heng (“Mr Heng”), argued\n                    that, on a proper reading of the relevant clauses in the Lease Agreement, it is\n                    clear that the parties have contracted out of the general common law rule\n                    requiring physical redelivery. However, according to counsel for the respective\n                    plaintiffs, the Lease Agreement did not have such effect and in fact contained a\n                    clause which reinforced the requirement of physical redelivery.64     Before analysing the parties’\n                    submissions, I will first explain why I agree with the Assistant\n                    Registrar’s views on the general common law requirement for physical\n                    redelivery.(1)   The general rule at common law65     The requirement of physical redelivery is\n                    intrinsically tied to the distinctive nature of a bareboat\n                charter.66     A bareboat charter essentially operates as a\n                    lease of the vessel to the charterer. The services of the master and crew may or\n                    may not be superadded but, ultimately, what is critical is that they are for all\n                    intents and purposes the servants of the charterer, and, through them, the\n                    possession and control of the vessel is vested in the charterer (see Sir Bernard\n                    Ederet al,Scrutton on\n                        Charterparties and Bills of Lading(Sweet & Maxwell, 22nd Ed,\n                    2011) (“Scrutton”) at para 4-002).\n                    It has therefore been said that the hallmark of a bareboat charter is the\n                    transfer ofpossession and controlof the vessel\n                    from the owner to the charterer (seeThe “Guiseppe di\n                        Vittorio”[1998] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 136 at 156). A\n                    bareboat charter does not transfer legal or beneficial title in the vessel to\n                    the charterer but, because possession and control of the vessel resides in him\n                    for the duration of the charter, it is not incorrect to speak of him as having\n                    temporary ownership of the vessel or as being its ownerpro\n                        hac vice(seeMedway Drydock & Engineering\n                        Co Ltd v MV Andrea Ursula[1973] 1 QB 265 at 269). Thissemblanceof ownership explains why I stated\n                    at the outset of this judgment that third parties may well believe or assume, in\n                    their dealings with the bareboat charterer, that they are in fact dealing with\n                    the vessel’s true owner.67     It is useful, for present purposes, to observe\n                    how the key elements of a bareboat charter,viz,\n                    the transfer of possession and control, are absent in other forms of charters.\n                    As explained inScruttonat para 4-003, under a\n                    charter which is not by demise, the owner agrees to render services by his\n                    master and crew to carry goods put on board his ship by or on behalf of the\n                    charterer. In these situations, control and possession remains with the owner at\n                    all times through the master and crew who continue to be his servants. This is\n                    so notwithstanding the temporary right of the charterer to have his goods loaded\n                    and conveyed in the vessel.68     The fundamental difference between a bareboat\n                    charter and other forms of charters is described succinctly in Tan Lee Meng,The Law in Singapore on Carriage of Goods by\n                        Sea(Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 1994) at p 219, where the learned\n                    author states:… Whereas a shipowner who has demised his vessel lets out the\n                        entire vessel and hands over total control and possession to the demise\n                        charterer, a shipowner who has entered into a time charterparty or a voyage\n                        charterparty is merely letting out the cargo carrying capacity of the\n                        vessel, which is manned by his own master and crew and the vessel remains in\n                        the shipowner’s possession and under his control.69     With these general observations in mind, I\n                    turn now to consider the cases on physical redelivery. I begin withThe Turakinawhich, as the Assistant Registrar observed\n                    at [77] of the Judgment, has been referred to in almost every case which has\n                    dealt with the point of law that concerns us here. In that case, the ship,Turakina, was sub-demise chartered from Deli\n                    Shipowners BV (“Deli”) to South Pacific Shipping Ltd\n                    (“SPS”) on the standard form known as Barecon 89. She was arrested\n                    in Sydney by the plaintiff stevedoring company pursuant to a claim for services\n                    rendered. The owner then applied for a release of the vessel on the basis that\n                    the court’s admiralty jurisdiction had been improperly invoked. The\n                    owner’s case was that the vessel was no longer on demise charter at the\n                    time when the proceedings for arrest were instituted because Deli had validly\n                    terminated it by issuing to SPS a notice of termination the day before. As in\n                    the present case, the crucial question which arose inThe\n                        Turakinawas whether the notice of termination was adequate to\n                    terminate the demise charter or whether physical redelivery was additionally\n                    required for this purpose. In this regard, the shipowner sought to rely on\n                    several cases involving the effective cancellation oftime\n                        chartersby the issuance of withdrawal notices to argue that\n                    Deli’s notice was sufficient for terminating thedemise\n                        charter. Tamberlin J was not persuaded by this approach. He\n                    rightly recognised at 675 that there was a “significant\n                    distinction” between a time or voyage charter and a demise charter before\n                    going on to observe as follows:… This distinction resides in the fact that in a non-demise charter\n                        there is no requirement for delivery or transfer of possession to the\n                        charterer at the commencement of the charter. Accordingly, redelivery cannot\n                        require a transfer back of possession. In such a case, the services provided\n                        to the charterer are terminated upon notice of withdrawal. However,in the case of a demise charter the vessel itself is\n                            let and possession is taken by the charterer. Therefore,once the vessel is withdrawn from the service of the\n                            charterer, an obligation to redeliver possession arises because\n                            possession has been delivered at the commencement of the\n                            charter. Redelivery, in its natural and\n                            ordinary meaning, denotes a delivery back of that which was originally\n                            delivered.… [emphasis added in italics and in bold\n                        italics]70     The logic applied by Tamberlin J is simple\n                    and, in my view, sound. A bareboat charter commences only when the twin\n                    ingredients of possession and control have been transferred from owner to\n                    charterer. It is therefore brought to an end only if there is, by the same\n                    token, a transfer back of possession and control. It is difficult to see how\n                    that can be effected without a physical redelivery of the bareboat chartered\n                    vessel. Applying that reasoning, in the absence of physical redelivery, the\n                    demise charter was found to have remained valid inThe\n                        Turakinaand the owner’s application for the vessel’s\n                    release was accordingly dismissed. This finding was further reinforced by the\n                    terms of the bareboat charter which, at Cl 10(a), expressly stipulated that\n                    hire shall continue to be payable until the day and hour of redelivery of\n                    possession of the vessel. Tamberlin J then went on to observe at 677 that there\n                    was also no step or acknowledgment by the bareboat charterer to “give\n                    effect to the redelivery”. This observation, as will be elaborated below,\n                    became the source of inspiration for the doctrine of constructive\n                    redelivery.71     The subsequent case ofThe\n                        Rangiorainvolved the arrest of three ofTurakina’ssister ships in Auckland, New Zealand. These\n                    vessels were also demise chartered by SPS from Deli on the Barecon 89 form. Deli\n                    had issued termination notices prior to the commencement of variousin remactions against the vessels and, again, the\n                    question arose as to whether or not the court’sin\n                        remjurisdiction had been properly invoked. Giles J noted at 52\n                    that the question of whether redelivery was necessary to terminate the demise\n                    charters constituted “the fulcrum of the case” and, on this\n                    crucial question, he agreed with Tamberlin J’s views inThe Turakina. The following passage from Giles J’s\n                    judgment at 55 is relevant:In my opinion,bearing in mind the two fundamental\n                            planks of a demise charter – the parting of both possession and\n                            control – the contract continues to have effect until both are\n                            withdrawn, (albeit unilaterally, in a breach situation), from\n                        the demise charterer.Notice of termination achieves\n                            resumption of, or cancellation of control but it does not effect\n                            redelivery.… [emphasis added]72     In summary, the complete transfer of\n                    possession and control from the shipowner to the charterer is the very\n                    quintessence of a bareboat charter. Thus, physical redelivery (which effects a\n                    reversion of the transfer of possession and control) is necessary for its\n                    termination.(2)   Can one contract out of the general rule?73     Mr Heng submitted that the parties in the\n                    instant case had contracted out of the general rule requiring physical\n                    redelivery. He referred me to several provisions of the Lease Agreement to make\n                    good his submission. Before dealing with the factual analysis whether the\n                    contractual provisions were sufficient to allow the parties to contract out of\n                    the general requirement for physical redelivery, I should state that I have\n                    serious reservations whether this could be done as a matter of\n                law.74     The mere issuance of termination notices inThe TurakinaandThe\n                        Rangiorawere held to be insufficient to terminate the respective\n                    bareboat charters in the absence of physical redelivery. However, inThe Rangiora, Giles J went on to observe that it is open\n                    for maritime parties to make specific provision as to how redelivery is to be\n                    effected upon early termination. On the facts, however, Giles J held at 56 that\n                    the Barecon 89 form used inThe TurakinaandThe Rangioradid not provide for termination\n                    in the absence of physical delivery:I agree with the submission made by both Counsel for the plaintiffs thatthe deficiency here lies in the drafting of the\n                            contract. I hesitate to criticize a standard form deriving\n                        its pedigree from the Baltic and International Maritime Council. But, the\n                        reality is that at English law (and German law) a demise charter necessarily\n                        envisages a parting with possession and control.The\n                            Barecon 89 form goes to great length to deal with redelivery at\n                            expiration of charter period; it expressly provides for withdrawal for\n                            breach but it fails to address how \"redelivery\" is to be secured in that\n                            situation.I have no doubt that an\n                            experienced craftsman could cover \"redelivery\" in an early termination\n                            context in a way which would be contractually effective.It\n                        might include a \"deeming\" provision incorporating directions where a vessel\n                        was at sea and/or providing for a procedure constituting recovery of\n                        possession irrespective of the charterer’s obligations to others.For whatever reason that has been overlooked in the\n                            present form.It is thus left to the Court to resolve, paying\n                        due regard to the common law. … [emphasis added in italics and in\n                        bold italics]75     It is correct that the Barecon 89 form\n                    contains a particular provision that is wholly consistent with the continuation\n                    of the bareboat charter up to the point of physical redelivery. This is found in\n                    Cl 10(a), the relevant portion of which prescribes that the bareboat\n                    charterer’s obligation to pay hire shall “continue until the date and hour when the Vessel is redeliveredby the Charterers to her Owners” [emphasis added]. As Giles J noted inThe Rangioraat 55, the fact that the contract\n                    recognises the continuing obligation to pay charter-hire until redelivery\n                    supports the view that redelivery is indeed necessary to terminate the bareboat\n                    charter. Tamberlin J also recognised at 676 ofThe\n                        Turakinathe importance of Cl 10(a) when he stated that this\n                    clause was a sufficient answer to the shipowner’s submission that SPS had,\n                    upon issuance of the termination notice by Deli, been reduced to a mere\n                    involuntary bailee of the vessel.76     However, I fail to see how parties can\n                    contract out of the requirement of physical delivery. If it is accepted that the\n                    requirement for physical redelivery as a requirement for termination stems from\n                    the unique nature of a bareboat charter (viz, that\n                    it effects the complete transfer of possession and control), I do not see how\n                    parties can simply contract out of its performance. Until physical redelivery is\n                    achieved, the bareboat charterer continues to enjoy the full rights of control\n                    and possession of the vessel. Perhaps more crucially, third parties will\n                    continue to deal with bareboat charterers on the basis of their actual control\n                    and physical possession of the vessel.77     It may be queried whether the view which I\n                    have preferred here is unduly prejudicial to shipowners. Damien J Cremean has,\n                    for instance, expressed the opinion inAdmiralty\n                        Jurisdiction: Law and Practice in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong\n                        Kong(The Federation Press, 3rd Ed, 2008) at p 185 that\n                    “there will occur cases where one would want to say a demise charter is\n                    over even though possession has not been able to be retaken – perhaps the\n                    demise charterer has put it out of the owner’s power to do so”. The\n                    concern articulated here seems to be one of fairness – why should ashipowner, who may experience difficulties\n                    securing the immediate or prompt redelivery of his vessel upon valid contractual\n                    termination, continue to be exposed to the risk of having his vessel arrested in\n                    the intervening period as a result of thecharterer’sunauthorised trading of the same? There is no\n                    doubt some attraction in this view but, to my mind, it fails to take into\n                    account the position ofthird partiesin the\n                    overall calculus of competing interests.78     It is pertinent to stress that third parties\n                    who provide services to or load cargo on vessels will often be unaware that the\n                    particular vessel is on bareboat charter. Previously, this placed them in an\n                    acutely vulnerable position because bareboat chartered vessels were insulated\n                    from arrest. Following legal reforms in many jurisdictions, this is no longer\n                    the case (see [4] above). The consultation paper prepared by the\n                    Attorney-General’s Chambers which preceded the 2004 Amendment in Singapore\n                    noted that, although allowing a bareboat chartered vessel to be arrested might,\n                    at first blush, appear rather “startling” as it effectively\n                    allowed recovery against the shipowner for the liabilities of the charterer,\n                    this was nevertheless internationally acceptable and, on the whole, desirable\n                    because “an effective admiralty regime should not cast the burden of\n                    determining ownership or other relationship with the vessel on the person\n                    dealing with the vessel” (seeAdmiralty Jurisdiction\n                        of the High Court: Arrest of Ships on Demise Charter to Secure the\n                        Obligations of the Demise Charterer (Consultation Paper)(24\n                    April 2003) LLRD No 1/2003 at paras 4.3–4.4 and 4.8). The legislative\n                    scheme in Singapore today – as it is the case across many leading maritime\n                    jurisdictions – therefore appears to have struck the balance in favour of\n                    third parties who can now deal with a vessel safe in the knowledge that,\n                    regardless of whether the party with whom they directly transact is the owner or\n                    bareboat charterer, they can arrest the vessel as security for their\n                    claims.79     In my judgment, holding that a validcontractualtermination suffices to bring a bareboat\n                    charter to an end in the absence of physical redelivery may upset the\n                    aforementioned balance. This is because third parties will find that it is no\n                    longer safe to assume that they have contracted with either the owner or\n                    bareboat charterer of a vessel inallcircumstances. If they deal with the vessel after contractual termination but\n                    before redelivery, it is possible that they may have in fact dealt withneither– the owner certainly does not\n                    have control and possession of the vessel during this curious period where she\n                    is in “limbo” whereas the party in full possession and control is\n                    no longer the bareboat charterer following contractual termination. In that\n                    event, the third party will have no basis for arresting the vessel and is thus\n                    left without security for its claim. This appears to me to cut against the\n                    spirit of the 2004 Amendment which, as I have stated, was aimed at lifting third\n                    parties from the burden of determining the true state of the relationship\n                    between owners and charterers.80     I recognise, however, that it may still be\n                    possible for third parties to arrest the vessel in certain limited situations\n                    notwithstanding the contractual termination of the bareboat charter. This is\n                    where it is shown that the master had acted with the ostensible authority ofthe ownerin dealing with third parties, in\n                    which event the court’s admiralty jurisdiction may yet be validly invoked\n                    on the basis of the owner’sin personamliability. This was found to be so in the case involving theSocofl Stream(discussed below) which is, unsurprisingly, also\n                    the principal authority relied on by KRC and Mercuria to resist the striking out\n                    of their alternative claims against HKC in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011.\n                    On this view, one may argue that allowing a shipowner to contract out of the\n                    general rule may not be as harsh on third parties as it appears.81     I am not persuaded by this argument. It is\n                    important to appreciate that theSocofl Streamexception does not arise automatically by operation of law. Instead, it is a\n                    fact-specific finding limited to circumstances resembling that in theSocofl Streamas discussed at [117]–[121] below.\n                    If it were otherwise, it would entirely defeat the shipowner’s purpose in\n                    terminating the bareboat charter to begin with (which is to prevent the vessel\n                    from being arrested in satisfaction ofin personamclaims against the bareboat charterer). TheSocofl\n                        Streamexception remains only of limited application and, with\n                    that being so, I am not convinced that it affords sufficient protection to third\n                    party interests.82     Therefore, in my view, allowing a shipowner to\n                    contract out of the general rule requiring physical redelivery works unfairness\n                    on third parties because, ultimately, in the absence of such redelivery, it is\n                    difficult to see how the change in legal status of the vessel can be made\n                    apparent to them. A shipowner is fully aware that, by executing a bareboat\n                    charter, he vests complete possession and control of his vessel in the charterer\n                    who, as the vessel’s ownerpro hac vice, can\n                    incur liabilities in respect of the vessel’s usevis-à-visthird parties (even to the extent of exposing the\n                    vessel to the possibility of arrest). In other words, an owner who lets his\n                    vessel out on bareboat charter does so with his eyes wide open: he knows the\n                    risks attendant to such an arrangement and has made a considered commercial\n                    decision to proceed. By contrast, a third party has little way of knowing\n                    whether the vessel he is dealing with is on bareboat charter, let alone that the\n                    bareboat charter has been terminated.83     When I examine the balance of competing\n                    interests in this context, it seems eminently fair to me that the risk ought to\n                    fall on the shipowner. I therefore consider the better position to be that\n                    partiescannotcontract out of the general common\n                    law rule which requires physical redelivery to bring an end to a bareboat\n                    charter.84     I should point out, however, that the position\n                    which I have stated here has not been shared elsewhere. A case illustrating the\n                    proposition that parties can contract out of the general rule isThe Socofl Stream (jurisdiction). There, the court had\n                    to deal with an application by Sovremenniy Kommercheskiy Flot\n                    (“Sovcomflot”) to strike out thein\n                        remproceedings commenced by CMC (Australia) Pty Ltd\n                    (“CMC”) against the shipSocofl\n                        Streamin February 1999 on the basis that the court lacked\n                    jurisdiction. The relevant persons named in the writ issued by CMC were\n                    Sovcomflot, Kamchatka Shipping Company (“Kamchatka”), and Aurora\n                    Navigation SA (“Aurora”). Sovcomflot had demise chartered the\n                    vessel from its owners, Aurora, in 1990 and, in turn, sub-demise chartered it to\n                    Kamchatka in 1993. On 15 December 1998, Sovcomflot issued a notice purporting to\n                    terminate the sub-demise charter on the basis that Kamchatka had failed to make\n                    two quarterly payments of hire. Sovcomflot subsequently demanded redelivery of\n                    the vessel but Kamchatka did not comply and continued to trade the vessel by\n                    loading cargo (which was the subject of the proceedings) in Singapore and Port\n                    Klang, Malaysia in early January 1999. TheSocofl\n                        Streamwas finally arrested by Sovcomflot on 25 January 1999\n                    after it had entered the Port of Brisbane. In its striking out application,\n                    Sovcomflot argued that its 15 December 1998 notice was effective in terminating\n                    the sub-demise charter, notwithstanding Kamchatka’s failure to redeliver\n                    the vessel. Thus, Sovcomflot argued, the court had noin\n                        remjurisdiction over the vessel since Kamchatka was no longer\n                    the demise charterer at the date of commencement of the proceedings by CMC in\n                    February 1999.85     One of the central questions which arose inThe Socofl Stream (jurisdiction)was the\n                    nature of the relationship between Sovcomflot and Kamchatka at the commencement\n                    of CMC’s action. Did Kamchatka remain the sub-demise charterer given its\n                    continued possession and control of the vessel? Or had Sovcomflot’s\n                    termination notice brought an end to the sub-demise charter at an earlier time?\n                    Moore J held that the latter view was correct. A key plank of his reasoning\n                    concerned Art 11(2)(a) of the sub-demise charter, which read (see [9]):(2)(a) If any Event of Default occurs and is not remedied within seven (7)\n                        business days from the date of telex notice by the Owner [ie, Aurora] or Disponent Owner [ie, Sovcomflot] as the case may be to the Charterer\n                            [ie, Kamchatka], then the Owner or\n                        Disponent Owner may, by telex notice to the Charterer, forthwith terminate\n                        this Agreement and upon such termination the Charterer shall forthwith pay\n                        to the Owner or Disponent Owner as the case may be a sum equal to the then\n                        outstanding Charter Hire Principal together with all other sums then due and\n                        unpaid under this Agreement and any other indebtedness of the Charterer\n                        under other agreements with the Owner and Disponent Owner and interest on\n                        the Charter Hire Principal calculated at the Default Rate for such period of\n                        time as the Charter Hire Principal remains overdue, whereupon the\n                        Charterer's obligation to pay the Charter Hire shall cease and the Owner or\n                        Disponent Owner as the case may be shall thereupon transfer title to the\n                        Vessel to the Charterer in the mannermutatis\n                            mutandisprovided in Articles 17 and 18 below.86     In Moore J’s view at [27]–[28],\n                    this provision conferred on Sovcomflot a “clear contractual right”\n                    to terminate the sub-demise charter by giving a telex notice and, in such\n                    circumstances, it was “difficult to avoid a conclusion that … the\n                    charterer ceased to be a demise charterer from the time of termination at least\n                    in the absence of provisions in the charterparty that suggested some other\n                    result”. Moore J distinguishedThe Turakinaby observing as follows at [27]:In the present case the structure and terms of the 1993 sub-demise\n                        charterparty arematerially differentto those\n                        of the charterparty considered by Tamberlin J inThe\n                            \"Turakina\"and there isa clear\n                            contractual rightconferred by article 11(2)(a) on Aurora or\n                        Sovcomflot to terminate the 1993 sub-demise charterparty by giving a telex\n                        notice. It was exercised by Sovcomflot.There was no\n                            equivalent power to terminate in the charterparty considered by\n                            Tamberlin J.… [T]he 1993 sub-demise charterparty\n                        clearly contemplated, in my opinion, the termination of the demise charter\n                        by the notice.Unlike the charterparty in The \"Turakina\",\n                            the 1993 sub-demise charterparty did not contain provisions which fairly\n                            unambiguously point to the continuation of the demise charter pending\n                            redelivery of the vessel.… [emphasis added]87     With respect, I do not find the distinction\n                    drawn by Moore J to be entirely convincing. Why should the contractual right to\n                    withdraw the vessel and to terminate by telex make such a significant\n                    difference? In my view, the latter is no different from the contractual right to\n                    withdraw the vessel for non-payment and to claim damages as was the case inThe Turakina. Neither clause changes the fact\n                    that the bareboat charterer continues to enjoy actual control and possession of\n                    the vessel pending actual physical redelivery.88     It is worth noting that the revised Barecon\n                    2001 form, which succeeded Barecon 89, was introduced to address the practical\n                    difficulties faced by owners in retaking possession of their vessels when the\n                    bareboat charter is terminated while the vessel is on the high seas. Clauses 28\n                    and 29 of Barecon 2001 provide as follows:28\n                        Termination(a) Charterers’ DefaultThe Owners shall be entitled to withdraw\n                            the Vessel from the service of the Charterers and terminate the Charter\n                            with immediate effect by written notice to the Charterers\n                        if:(i)the Charterers fail to pay hire in\n                                    accordance with Clause 11.However, where there is a\n                                failure to make punctual payment of hire due to oversight,\n                                negligence, errors or omissions on the part of the Charterers or\n                                their bankers, the Owners shall give the Charterers written notice\n                                of the number of clear banking days stated in Box 34 (as recognised\n                                at the agreed place of payment) in which to rectify the failure, and\n                                when so rectified within such number of days following the\n                                Owners’ notice, the payment shall stand as regular and\n                                punctual.Failure by the Charterers to pay hire\n                                    within the number of days stated in Box 34 of their receiving\n                                    the Owners’ notice as provided herein, shall entitle the\n                                    Owners to withdraw the Vessel from the service of the Charterers\n                                    and terminate the Charter without further\n                                notice;…29\n                        RepossessionIn the event of the termination of this Charter in accordance with the\n                        applicable provisions of Clause 28,the Owners shall have\n                            the right to repossess the Vessel from the Charterers at her current or\n                            next port of call, or at a port or place convenient to them\n                        without hindrance or interference by the Charterers, courts or local\n                        authorities.Pending physical repossession of the Vessel\n                            in accordance with this Clause 29, the Charterers shall hold the Vessel\n                            as gratuitous bailee only to the owners.The Owners shall\n                        arrange for an authorised representative to board the Vessel as soon as\n                        reasonably practicable following the termination of the Charter.The Vessel shall be deemed to be repossessed by the Owners from\n                            the Charterers upon the boarding of the Vessel by the Owners’\n                            representative.All arrangements and expenses relating to the\n                        settling of wages, disembarkation and repatriation of the Charterers’\n                        Master, officers and crew shall be the sole responsibility of the\n                        Charterers.[emphasis added in italics and in bold italics]89     The decision of Rares J inThe Hako Fortressis instructive in explaining how Cll 28 and 29\n                    are intended to operate (see [61], [63] and [64]):The terms of the Barecon 89 and 2001 formsdiffered\n                            materiallyon the circumstances in which the owners could\n                        withdraw the vessel and its consequences: see M Davis:Bareboat Charters, 2nd ed, LLP London, 2005, at\n                        [28.13]–[28.14].More importantly, cl 29 of the\n                            Barecon 2001 form was a new provision that Davis observed at [29.01] was\n                            designed to clarify and strengthen the owners’ position if the\n                            charter was terminated under cl 28 and to address the practical\n                            difficulties that may occur in such circumstances.As he\n                        pointed out if the owners terminated a demise charter while the ship was on\n                        the high seas, they were in a potentially vulnerable position if they were\n                        unable, then and there, to retake possession. Clearly, cl 29 was formulated\n                        with this in mind.…I am of opinion that as a matter of principle the terms\n                            of cll 28 and 29 of the Barecon 2001 form of charterparty can operate as\n                            they were intended without requiring the owners, first, to physically\n                            retake possession of the ship following her withdrawal and the\n                            termination of the charterparty.… The charterer\n                        becomes entitled to possession of the ship under and by virtue of the\n                        contractual rights that the owners confer on it by the terms of the demise.\n                        But that right to possession and control can be affected by another of the\n                        terms of the Barecon 2001 form. Thus,cl 29 provides that\n                            upon withdrawal of the ship and termination of the charter, the nature\n                            of the charterer’s possession changes from possession for the\n                            charterer’s use and benefit to possession as a gratuitous bailee\n                            for the owners. Possession of the latter kind is\n                        substantively different in character to the plenary right to possession and\n                        use of the ship formerly enjoyed by the charterer while the charter remained\n                        on foot.When the charterer is in possession as a gratuitous bailee under cl 29, he\n                        holds the ship for the sole use and benefit of the owners. When, however, he\n                        is in possession because of the demise of the ship to him, the charterer\n                        holds her for his own use and benefit.The effect of the\n                            withdrawal and termination of the charter under cl 29 is the same as a\n                            physical redelivery to the owners because the charterer has lost his\n                            contractual authority and right to use and employ the ship as he\n                            pleases.…[emphasis added]90     While the intention behind Barecon 2001 might\n                    have been to address the redelivery issue, it is not clear to me how making the\n                    bareboat charterer a gratuitous bailee, on paper, can dispense with the general\n                    requirement for physical redelivery. While it appears to be a neat legal\n                    solution that seems to notionally re-vest possession and control in the\n                    shipowner, it does not change the reality on the ground (or at sea, as is the\n                    case here). Third party rights and liabilities arise from theactualoperation of the vessel by the bareboat charterer by\n                    reason of theactualtransfer of complete control\n                    and possession of the vessel to the bareboat charterer. Similar concerns were\n                    expressed inASP Holdingswhere Cll 28 and 29 of\n                    Barecon 2001 came up for consideration. For the sake of comity, Finkelstein J\n                    felt constrained to rule at [13] that, consistent with Moore J inThe Socofl Stream (jurisdiction), Cll 28 and 29 entitled\n                    an owner to terminate a demise charter by merely issuing such notice. However,\n                    Finklestein J nonetheless expressed reservations about the notion that one could\n                    contract out of the requirement for physical redelivery at\n                    [13]–[15]:Comity requires me to applyThe Socofl\n                            Streamand thus hold that in the case of this charterparty,\n                        in particular because of cll 28 and 29, the charter can be terminated on\n                        written notice. Clause 28 provides for termination by notice and cl 29 says\n                        that when the charter is at an end the charterer is the “gratuitous\n                        bailee” of the vessel.If I may say so, this is a troubling conclusion. It is troubling because\n                        until the owner actually withdraws the vessel not only does the charterer\n                        retain possession it still mans and supplies her. The problem becomes acute\n                        if the notice of termination is served while the vessel is at sea. ApplyingThe Socofl Stream, she is not under demise\n                        while returning to port. If that be true it may surprise the owner to learn\n                        that the master now has ostensible authority to bind it. There is also the\n                        possibility that the owner may decide to retake possession at the next port\n                        of call or at a convenient port or place as contemplated by cl 29. The\n                        result of the application ofThe Socofl Streamis that the owner has control of the vessel during the voyage. The true\n                        position is probably different.I prefer the view that it is not until the vessel has been withdrawn that\n                        the demise comes to an end for it is only then that the charterer has lost\n                        exclusive possession of the vessel. That the charterparty describes the\n                        charterer’s possession before delivery as that of “gratuitous\n                        bailment’’ is not to the point.The real\n                            relation between the charterer and the vessel cannot be disguised by the\n                            use of an inapposite label or description.I appreciate,\n                        however, that others take a different view.[emphasis added]91     While others might have been of a different\n                    view from Finklestein J, his concerns certainly resonated with me. I do not see\n                    how the parties’ attempt at constituting the charterer as a\n                    “gratuitous bailee” can be effective in transferring possession\n                    and thereby bring about an end to the charter. Having reviewed the authorities,\n                    the Assistant Registrar concluded at [112] of the Judgment that since a bareboat\n                    charterparty is in essence a contract between the owner and the charterer,\n                    parties are free to include such terms as to how possession of the vessel is to\n                    be terminated. With respect, I do not fully agree with this statement. The\n                    question of repossession goes right to the heart of whether the bareboat charter\n                    remains in force and, that being the case, I do not consider it to be within the\n                    parties’ private sphere to stipulate when or how this may occurshort of what the general law requires. As I have\n                    stressed in this judgment, a bareboat charter is only at an end in law if the\n                    two ingredients of control and possessionin factrevest in the owner – parties cannot, through the use of an inapposite\n                    label, declare this to be the case when that is not reflected in the reality of\n                    their situation.(3)   Had the parties contracted out of the general\n                rule?92     For completeness, I will now examine whether,\n                    even assuming that it were possible to contract out of the general rule\n                    requiring physical delivery, this is provided for in the Lease\n                Agreement.93     Mr Heng drew my attention to two provisions.\n                    First, he pointed out that Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement conferred a right on\n                    HKC to terminate the Lease Agreement upon issuance of a notice. This provision,\n                    he argued, closely resembled Art 11(2)(a) of the sub-demise charter inThe Socofl Stream (jurisdiction)which, as will be\n                    recalled, conferred a clear contractual right on the owner to terminate the\n                    sub-demise charter by telex notice. Second, Mr Heng pointed me to Art\n                    24(4), which stated that Sejin shall immediately halt use of the Vessel and\n                    return it to HKC in the event of termination. He argued that, cumulatively,\n                    these provisions suggested that the parties had intended to contract out of the\n                    requirement of physical redelivery, as was found to be the case inThe Socofl Stream (jurisdiction).94     While there is some force in Mr Heng’s\n                    submission (assuming that it is possible to contract out of the general rule\n                    requiring physical redelivery), I do not see how he can overcome Art 26(3) of\n                    the Lease Agreement which provides:Article 26 (Return of\n                            Vessel)…3. In the event [HKC] delays the return procedure stated in the previous\n                        clause, [Sejin] shall continue to pay the lease fee to [HKC] up till the\n                        point when [HKC] confirms the return of the Vessel. The validity of this\n                        contract shall remain in force and effect up till the aforementioned\n                        confirmation by [HKC].95     As the plaintiffs rightly pointed out, Art\n                    26(3) is akin to Cl 10(a) of the Barecon 89 form which was considered inThe TurakinaandThe\n                        Rangiorain that it specifies that hire shall continue to be\n                    payable by Sejin up to the point when HKC confirms the return of the Vessel.\n                    This clause reinforces the fact that the Lease Agreement is consistent with the\n                    general requirement for physical redelivery.96     Mr Heng submitted that Art 26(3) was a\n                    “red herring”. He emphasised that Art 26(3) only operated where\n                    HKC has delayed the return of the Vessel and that this was not the case on our\n                    facts. I am not persuaded by this narrow reading of Art 26(3). If Mr Heng were\n                    correct, Sejin could deliberately delay the return of the Vessel without\n                    suffering financial penalty and conversely, HKC could, by deliberately delaying\n                    the return of the Vessel, continue to keep Sejin’s payment obligations\n                    alive, notwithstanding the latter’s desire to return the Vessel. This\n                    construction makes no commercial sense. In my view, the better reading of Art\n                    26(3) is that Sejin is under a continuing obligation to make rental payments up\n                    till the point that redelivery is made and HKC confirms the return of the\n                    Vessel. This is so regardless of the party responsible for the delay. This is\n                    because, in the absence of such redelivery, the parties do not consider the\n                    Lease Agreement to have come to an end. This view is reinforced by the final\n                    sentence in Art 26(3) which unambiguously and unqualifiedly states that the\n                    Lease Agreement “shall remain in force and effect” until HKC\n                    confirms the return of the Vessel.97     Indeed, this also appears to be how the\n                    parties themselves understood Art 26(3) because the evidence before me suggests\n                    that Sejin did in fact continue to be charged charter-hire subsequent to the 4\n                    April Notice. As shown in the 4 April Notice (see [15] above), HKA demanded\n                    outstanding lease payments amounting to 289,430,562 Korean Won (approximately\n                    US$261,445.52 at the current exchange rate) at the time of the purported\n                    termination. However, by the time HKA issued its 14 June 2011 letter warning\n                    Sejin that its conduct amounted to embezzlement (see [22] above), HKA now\n                    demanded a significantly higher overdue lease amount of 190,000,000 Korean Won\n                    (approximately US$171,628.71) plus US$210,000 (which makes a total of\n                    US$381,628.71). As no explanation has been provided by HKA or Mr Sejun Kim\n                    on behalf of HKC for the difference in the amounts, and given the interlocutory\n                    nature of the applications, it is permissible to draw the inference at this\n                    stage that this increase could well be due to the fact that Sejin continued to\n                    be charged charter-hire under the Lease Agreement which remained in full effect.\n                    On this view of events, it would appear that the parties themselves interpreted\n                    Art 26(3) the same way which I have,viz, that\n                    charter-hire continued to be payable by Sejin until the Vessel was redelivered,\n                    irrespective of the fact that HKC was not responsible for the delay in\n                    redelivery.98     In light of the above, I find that HKC’s\n                    appeal also fails on the physical redelivery issue. In my view, a bareboat\n                    charter can only be terminated with the physical redelivery of the vessel.\n                    Further, even if it were possible to contract out of that general rule (which I\n                    doubt), I find that the Lease Agreement did not have such an effect and in factreinforcedthe general requirement of physical\n                    redelivery at common law. Therefore, even if the 4 April Notice were valid,\n                    I find that the Lease Agreement had not been validly terminated as physical\n                    delivery had not been effected. Thus, Sejin continued to be the demise charterer\n                    at the time the plaintiffs commenced their respectivein\n                        remactions.The constructive redelivery issue99     I have thus far held that HKC has failed on\n                    both the contractual termination and physical redelivery issues. For\n                    completeness, given the Assistant Registrar’s ruling on the doctrine of\n                    constructive redelivery and the parties’ extensive submissions on this\n                    issue, I will go on to explain why I think that HKC also fails on the\n                    constructive redelivery issue.100    Like the doctrine of contracting out\n                    discussed above, the doctrine of “constructive redelivery” also\n                    appears to mitigate the perceived harshness of the general requirement of\n                    physical redelivery. This concept was first raised inThe\n                        Turakina(see [70] above). It seems to me that the point was\n                    raised somewhat in passing without the benefit of full arguments as to whether\n                    such a doctrine should be accepted in the first place. Tamberlin J had reached\n                    the conclusion that (due to the intrinsic nature of a bareboat charter and the\n                    terms of the Barecon 89 form) redelivery was essential to bring the bareboat\n                    charter to an end. It was then argued by the applicant that withdrawal of the\n                    vesselipso factoconstituted constructive\n                    redelivery. This submission was eventually rejected by the court on the facts.\n                    However, Tamberlin J appeared to implicitly endorse the doctrine of constructive\n                    redelivery when he went on to observe at 677 that the “notion of\n                    redelivery of possession of the vessel suggests some step or acknowledgment by\n                    the charterer to give effect to the redelivery”.101    SinceThe\n                        Turakina, several cases have referred to the doctrine of\n                    constructive redelivery but, to the best of my knowledge, none until the\n                    decision by the Assistant Registrar has actually found constructive redelivery\n                    of a vessel to have been made out. Before examining the reasons which persuaded\n                    the Assistant Registrar to break new ground in holding that the Vessel was\n                    constructively redelivered, it may be useful to first examine the necessity for\n                    such a doctrine.(1)   Should the doctrine of constructive redelivery form part of\n                our law?102    I agree with Ms Tan Hui Tsing (“Ms\n                    Tan”), counsel for KRC and Frumentarius, that the courts typically resort\n                    to constructive analogies to address a gap in the law that, if left unaddressed,\n                    would result in an inequitable or unfair outcome. I begin by echoing the\n                    observation of Lionel Smith in “Constructive Trusts and Constructive\n                    Trustees” [1999] 58 CLJ 294 that “[w]e have quite a lot of\n                    ‘constructive’ in different parts of our law”, such as the\n                    vehicle of the constructive trust, constructive knowledge, and constructive\n                    possession to name but a few. It is clear that in appending the term\n                    “constructive” to these various orthodox concepts, the law\n                    essentially projects legalfictionsinto the\n                    analytical process (see Nancy J Knauer, “Legal Fictions and Juristic\n                    Truth” [2010] 23 St Thomas L Rev 70 at p 71). As Sir Robert Megarry\n                    once stated extra-judicially, the term “constructive” seems to\n                    simply mean that “[i]t isn’t, but has to be treated as if it\n                    were” (see “Historical Development” inSpecial Lectures of The Law Society of Upper Canada 1990: Fiduciary\n                        Duties(Toronto, 1991) 1 at p 5). It is clear that the law does\n                    not conjure up and employ legal fictions for no good reason. There is always\n                    some underlying motivation behind their creation and sustained usage. For\n                    instance, it is something used to enable courts to incrementally test and probe\n                    the boundaries of a potential new rule before definitively acknowledging it as\n                    such (see,eg, Maksymilian Del Mar, “Legal\n                    Fictions and Legal Change” (2013) 9 Int JLC 442 at p 450 on\n                    “exploratory fictions”), or as a means of articulating a rational\n                    basis for and achieving coherence with existing legal precepts (see,eg, Roscoe Pound,Jurisprudence(The Lawbook Exchange Ltd Union, 1959) at p 450 on\n                    “dogmatic fictions”).103    For present purposes, however, I consider\n                    that the term “constructive” may also be used to avoid the\n                    potential injustice that may result from the rigid application of orthodox\n                    principles (in this case, the general rule on physical redelivery). The\n                    “constructive trust” is a fitting example and I should clarify\n                    here that I am specifically referencing that class of constructive trusts which\n                    Millett LJ (as he then was) identified inParagon Finance plc\n                        v D B Thakerar & Co (a firm)[1999] 1 All ER 400 at 409 as\n                    one where the defendant had never assumed or intended to assume the office of a\n                    trustee at all but is yet made liable to account as a “constructive\n                    trustee” by reason of some fraud or wrongdoing on his part such as by\n                    rendering his dishonest assistance in the misapplication of trust assets or in\n                    knowingly receiving the same (see alsoWilliams v Central\n                        Bank of Nigeria[2014] 1 AC 1189 at [9],perLord Sumption). As Justice James Edelman has observed,\n                    extra-judicially, in “Two Fundamental Questions for the Law of\n                    Trusts” (2013) 129 LQR 66 at p 76, the constructive trust is used in\n                    this context as “a method of imposing liability to account in equityas ifthe defendantwere a\n                        trustee” [original emphasis] when, in truth, he is not.\n                    This is no doubt a form of fictional reasoning but the law resorts to it because\n                    it would be unconscionable, for example, to allow the defendant to profit\n                    unjustly from his participation in an unlawful transaction. Viewed in this way,\n                    it is clear that the use of “constructive” reasoning in this\n                    context was necessitated by the need to address a “gap” in trusts\n                    law. Another relevant example in this connection concerns a legal concept which\n                    I have already examined in some detail above,viz,\n                    the doctrine of apparent authority, which is sometimes also referred to as\n                    “constructive agency” (see,eg, Gail\n                    Pearson and Simon Fisher,Commercial Law: Commentary and\n                        Materials(LBC Information Services, 1st Ed, 1999) at\n                    p 390). The use of this concept may again be regarded as being fictional\n                    since it only arises in circumstances where there is noactualauthority but it is necessary for reasons of fairness and\n                    justice to recognise that the agent in question was nevertheless cloaked with\n                    the authority of his apparent principal to avoid prejudice to third parties who\n                    have transacted with him. In other words, the inadequacy of the orthodox notion\n                    of actual authority (the application of which would not lead to a just outcome)\n                    again provides an impetus for the law’s recognition of apparent or\n                    constructive authority despite the latter’s undeniably fictional\n                    character.104    With that in mind, I now return to the issue\n                    at hand,viz, the notion of constructive\n                    redelivery in the context of bareboat charters. Having considered the issue, I\n                    do not see where theneedlies for its creation\n                    and acceptance into Singapore maritime law. As I have explained at\n                    [77]–[83] above, as between the owner and innocent third parties, it is\n                    not unfair that third parties should be able to proceedin\n                        remagainst the vessel so long as such liabilities arise and the\n                    suit is commencedpriorto physical redelivery of\n                    the vessel. To my mind, it does not appear that there is any injustice which\n                    needs to be remedied so I do not see the need for such a doctrine in our law.\n                    Further, I am of the view that importing such a doctrine would, instead, visit\n                    significant injustice onthird parties, who have\n                    no way of knowing if the bareboat charterer with whom he is transacting has\n                    already terminated the bareboat charter by effecting constructive delivery. My\n                    previous comments, though made in the context of the notion of contracting out\n                    of the general rule, also apply readily in this context. On our facts, this\n                    outcome is also a just one. HKC knowingly allowed Sejin to continue to represent\n                    itself as the bareboat charterer of the Vessel to third parties like the present\n                    plaintiffs notwithstanding the purported termination.105    As a concluding remark, I note that the\n                    cases which accept the doctrine of constructive deliveryalsoheld that it is possible to contract out of the requirement\n                    for physical redelivery. With respect, it seems to me that both concepts are not\n                    compatible. If parties can contract out of the requirement of physical\n                    redelivery then there is clearly no “gap” which needs to be\n                    filled. In these circumstances, I do not see why the doctrine of constructive\n                    delivery is still needed.(2)   Had the Vessel been constructively redelivered?106    However, should it come to pass that,\n                    contrary to my holding, there is place for such a doctrine, then, in my view,\n                    constructive redelivery is still not made out on the facts. I begin by reviewing\n                    the observations made inThe TurakinaandThe Rangioraon this issue. In determining\n                    whether a vessel could be regarded to have been constructively redelivered,\n                    Tamberlin J inThe Turakinaheld at 677 that\n                    the inquiry should be focussed on “some step or acknowledgmentby the chartererto give effect to the\n                    redelivery” [emphasis added]. This is understandable because physical\n                    redelivery requires a clear act by the charterer; thus, constructive redelivery,\n                    as an equitable substitute, must likewise emanate from the conduct of the\n                    charterer. Tamberlin J did not provide examples of such “steps”\n                    but inThe Rangiora, Giles J observed at 55 that\n                    it would suffice if the owner’s agent attended onboard the vessel to\n                    announce that it had retaken possession of the vessel or if the owner issued\n                    proceedings seeking repossession. However, I note that these examples concern\n                    acts by theownerand not thechartererand therefore may not be particularly useful to\n                    illustrate conduct sufficient to constitute constructive redelivery. In any\n                    event, as highlighted by Mercuria’s counsel, Mr Philip Tay (“Mr\n                    Tay”), such examples are tantamount to a physical retaking of the vessel\n                    by the owners.107    In finding that the Vessel was\n                    constructively redelivered, the Assistant Registrar relied on the following\n                    conduct of Sejin and found that any one of them was sufficient:(a)     The implicit acknowledgment of the\n                        termination by Mr Park, the CEO of Sejin, at a meeting in mid-April 2011 in\n                        which he requested that HKC withdraw the 4 April Notice.(b)     Sejin’s letter of 4 July 2011\n                        to HKA stating that it “wanted to return the ship safely through the\n                        ship’s normal sailing route but [that] the situation does not allow us\n                        to do that so far”.(c)     Finally, Sejin’s letter of 15 July 2011 stating\n                        that it “will do our best to return the ship to Korea as soon as\n                        possible”.It did not matter to HKC for the purposes of setting aside\n                            thein remwrits which of the three dates\n                            terminated the bareboat charter because the earliest of thein remwrits was issued by Winplus on 28 July\n                            2011 while the latest of the three dates occurred on 15 July 2011,priorto the issuance of any of thein remwrits.108    After examining the evidence before me, I am\n                    not able to agree with the Assistant Registrar that constructive redelivery had\n                    been effected. As a starting point, I first observe that certainty is critical\n                    in the shipping trade since it invariably involves multiple third party\n                    interests. Therefore any step or conduct as regards redelivery by the bareboat\n                    charterer must be clear and unequivocal. The examples cited by counsel in their\n                    further submissions bear this out. For pledges, constructive delivery or\n                    possession can arise from the delivery of the keys to the property. A bank can\n                    be regarded as being in constructive possession of goods upon the deposit of the\n                    bill of lading which, in shipping parlance, is “the key to the\n                    warehouse”. Likewise, a seller in possession can be considered to have\n                    constructively delivered the chattel if he assents to hold the thing sold on\n                    account for the buyer. In each of these examples, the conduct of the relevant\n                    party is both clear and unequivocal.109    As a preliminary point, I pause to note that\n                    the Assistant Registrar stated at [129] of the Judgment that inThe Rangiora, “a letter from the liquidators\n                    acknowledging receipt of the notice of termination and accepting the termination\n                    was sufficient to constitute constructive redelivery of the ship”. This\n                    is incorrect. First, it was opposing counsel and not the court who was prepared\n                    to accept in principle that the letter of acknowledgment could constitute\n                    constructive redelivery (seeThe Rangioraat 50).\n                    In any event, the concession was moot because the letter was not despatched\n                    prior to the commencement of the action. Second, the court in fact found that\n                    there was no redelivery – actual, symbolic or constructive (seeThe Rangioraat 55).110    This brings me to the crux of the issue: was\n                    the conduct of Sejin clear and unequivocal? In the present case, there was no\n                    overt act by Sejin capable of representing redelivery. Instead HKC’s\n                    reliance was on correspondence and matters alleged to have been said at a\n                    meeting. It is therefore imperative to examine the context and factual matrix\n                    surrounding the three events found to have been sufficient by the Assistant\n                    Registrar.111    First, as regards the meeting in mid-April\n                    2011, she found that in requesting for the revocation of the 4 April Notice,\n                    Sejin had implicitly acknowledged the termination of the Lease Agreement. While\n                    that may be correct, it is not sufficient. It is important always to bear in\n                    mind that, to bring an end to a bareboat charter,bothcontrol and possession must be withdrawn. As rightly\n                    observed by Giles J inThe Rangioraat 55,\n                    “[n]otice of termination achieves resumption of, or cancellation ofcontrolbut it does not effectredelivery” [emphasis added]. An acknowledgement\n                    of termination deals with the requirement of control but not with possession. On\n                    the facts, there was no clear act which represented the reversion of possession.\n                    Instead, the conduct of Sejin following the mid-April meeting was entirely\n                    inconsistent with any intention to redeliver. On 23 May 2011, Sejin, in response\n                    to HKA’s 9 May letter, informed HKA that it had entered into a\n                    charterparty dated 13 May 2011 with Frumentarius. On 31 May 2011, Sejin provided\n                    HKA with a written update that the Vessel had entered Belawan and was in the\n                    process of loading palm oil cargo and that the Vessel would proceed next to\n                    Dumai for additional loading and then onwards to the Mediterranean Sea and the\n                    Black Sea for discharge. Sejin’s sailing instructions clearly showed that\n                    it had no intention to redeliver the Vessel in response to the 4 April\n                    Notice.112    Second, neither the letter of 4 July 2011\n                    nor the letter of 15 July 2011 was clear and unequivocal enough to constitute\n                    constructive redelivery. On 4 July 2011, Sejin wrote that it “wanted\n                    to return the return the ship safely through the ship’s normal sailing\n                    route, but the situation does not allow us to do that”. On 15 July 2011,\n                    Sejin wrote, “we will do our best to return the ship to Korea as soon as\n                    possible”. These letters were couched in tentative and equivocal\n                    language: “wantedto return….butthe situation does not allow us to”\n                    and “we willdo our bestto return the\n                    ship” [emphasis added]. The reason for this is clear from the context. At\n                    the time the letters were authored, the Vessel – as HKC/HKA were well\n                    aware – was already laden with cargoes which had yet to be delivered at\n                    their discharge ports. Viewed holistically, what Sejin was in fact saying was\n                    that it intended to continue using the Vessel to deliver the cargoes to their\n                    discharge portsbeforecontemplating the return of\n                    the Vessel – it is clear that Sejin did not, through either of these\n                    letters, evince a clear intention to redeliver the Vessel.113    In the circumstances, I am unable to accept\n                    that any of the three events constituted a clear and unequivocal step or\n                    acknowledgment by Sejin to redeliver the Vessel to HKC in response to the 4\n                    April Notice. Thus, HKC also fails on the issue of constructive\n                    redelivery.HKC’s appeals114    This portion of the judgment deals with\n                    HKC’s appeals against the Assistant Registrar’s decision to dismiss\n                    its striking out applications in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011. I first\n                    pause to observe that this alternative claim is only relevant if thein remwrits against Sejin as bareboat charterers are,\n                    contrary to my primary finding, set aside. In these actions, KRC and Mercuria\n                    claim, in the alternative, against HKC directly. The thrust of their argument is\n                    that, in permitting cargo to be loaded onboard the Vessel and allowing the\n                    master to issue bills of lading in respect thereof (notwithstanding the\n                    termination of the Lease Agreement), HKC must be treated as having clothed the\n                    master with theostensible authorityto enter into\n                    contracts of carriage on its behalf as owner of the Vessel. If they are correct\n                    that HKC is directly liable for their losses, there is no doubt that the Vessel\n                    may be arrested as HKC is the owner of the Vessel. Ms Tan and Mr Tay, counsel\n                    for KRC and Mercuria respectively, relied principally on the cases arising from\n                    the arrest of theSocofl Streamto establish this\n                    point.115    HKC applied to strike out these alternative\n                    claims against it on the basis that they were “factually\n                    unsustainable”. The crux of Mr Heng’s case was that HKC had never,\n                    by words or conduct, represented or permitted it to be represented that the\n                    master had authority to act on its behalf in issuing the bills of lading or in\n                    carrying the cargo owned by KRC and Mercuria. Mr Heng submitted that the\n                    contrary was true instead: he argued that the facts showed that HKC had\n                    consistently treated the Lease Agreement as having been terminated with the\n                    issuance of the 4 April Notice, as evinced by HKC’s repeated demands for\n                    the return of the Vessel.116    I do not agree with Mr Heng’s\n                    submissions. To begin with, I do not think that it is entirely accurate to state\n                    that HKC had consistently treated the Lease Agreement as having been terminated\n                    from the 4 April Notice onwards. That position may have been reflected in its\n                    written correspondence with Sejin, but its conduct ofknowinglypermitting the Vessel to be traded even after the 4\n                    April Notice suggests otherwise. Furthermore, I do not see how HKC’s\n                    conduct of repeatedly demanding the redelivery of the Vessel takes\n                    Mr Heng’s case very far. Those communications were wholly private in\n                    nature and were never made known to third party shippers dealing with the Vessel\n                    (such as KRC and Mercuria) who would ordinarily assume that they were\n                    transacting with the actual or disponent owner of the Vessel. Publicly, the\n                    picture was very different. It appeared that HKCknowinglypermitted the Vessel to be traded even after the 4\n                    April Notice. If the Lease Agreement had been terminated, as HKC argued, it\n                    should and could have taken steps to ensure that third parties were aware of\n                    this in order to avoid attracting potential liability to itself through the\n                    continued trading of the Vessel. HKC was slow, however, to take any such steps\n                    prior to the loading of KRC and Mercuria’s cargo at Belawan and Dumai\n                    respectively. The decisions arising from the arrest of theSocofl Streamare highly instructive in this regard and I turn\n                    now to consider them.The Socofl Stream cases117    The factual matrix leading to the arrest of\n                    theSocofl Streamhas already been outlined at\n                    [84] above. It will be recalled that Sovcomflot purportedly terminated the\n                    bareboat charter on 15 December 1998. On 25 December 1998, Sovcomflot\n                    demanded that the vessel be redelivered but did not nominate a port for this to\n                    be done. On 30 December 1998, Kamchatka replied stating that it disputed the\n                    debt claimed by Sovcomflot and that, until the parties’ rights and\n                    obligations had been finally determined, “we … do not propose to\n                    return possession of the … vessel to you or to whoever may be entitled\n                    thereto” (seeThe Socofl Stream\n                        (jurisdiction)at [7]). As Moore J noted at [8], it was at least\n                    implicit in this response that Kamchatka intended to continue to use the vessel\n                    for trading as it had done up to that point as the sub-demise charterer, pending\n                    resolution of Sovcomflot’s disputed debt. Following this, Kamchatka\n                    continued to deploy the vessel for the carriage of goods. It loaded goods\n                    belonging to CMC in Singapore and Port Klang in early January 1999 before\n                    it was finally arrested on 25 January 1999 by Sovcomflot in Brisbane. CMC\n                    commencedin remproceedings against the vessel in\n                    February 1999 and Sovcomflot’s application to strike it out for want of\n                    jurisdiction was the subject of the proceedings inThe Socofl\n                        Stream (jurisdiction).118    I have already stated how, inThe Socofl Stream (jurisdiction), Moore J found that the\n                    sub-demise charter had been validly terminated by Sovcomflot through its\n                    issuance of the termination notice. CMC’s invocation of the court’s\n                    admiralty jurisdiction on the basis thatKamchatkawas the relevant person was therefore invalid. However, that was not the end of\n                    the matter. As with KRC and Mercuria here, CMC also argued, in the alternative,\n                    thatSovcomflothad clothed the master with\n                    ostensible authority to bind it in respect of the bills of lading issued by\n                    permitting the vessel to be traded notwithstanding the termination of the\n                    sub-demise charter. Moore J expressed the view at [31] that this submission was\n                    “not untenable” and he had the opportunity to revisit it more\n                    fully when the merits of CMC’s claim came before him inCMC (Australia) Pty Ltd v ‘Socofl Stream’[2000] FCA\n                    1681 (“The Socofl Stream (merits; 1st\n                        instance)”).119    InThe Socofl Stream\n                        (merits; 1st instance), Moore J held that Sovcomflot was liable\n                    to CMC on the basis that it had clothed the master with ostensible authority. In\n                    arriving at this view, Moore J placed importance on the fact that Sovcomflot was\n                    contractually obliged to nominate a port for redelivery but had failed to do so.\n                    He reasoned as follows at [87]:Sovcomflot's demand for redelivery in its telex of 25 December 1998, in\n                        which it demanded that Kamchatka \"forthwith re-deliver the above vessel to\n                        the disponent owner as soon as possible at a safe port to be nominated by\n                        us, failing which re-delivery the disponent owner (or their agent) may\n                        itself enter upon and repossess the vessel,\" was a barren one in the absence\n                        of the nomination of a port for redelivery. Moreover,the\n                            failure of Sovcomflot to nominate a port might reasonably have been\n                            taken by Kamchatka to be an indication that Sovcomflot was not prepared\n                            to assert or enforce its legal rights, at least fully.\n                        Sovcomflot neglected to nominate a port for redelivery even when Kamchatka\n                        made it plain (again) in its telex of 30 December 1998 that it proposed to\n                        continue to trade.Sovcomflot thus afforded Kamchatka the\n                            opportunity to continue to trade using the Vessel under the command of\n                            the Master. Sovcomflot effectively clothed the Master with authority to\n                            issue bills of lading on behalf of the \"owner\", that is, the person who\n                            was, at that time, in fact and in law the demise charterer. Sovcomflot\n                            would have had no reasonable basis, in my opinion, for assuming that\n                            what had occurred in late December 1998 between it and Kamchatka would\n                            be known to shippers who might use the Vessel before Sovcomflot regained\n                            physical possession of it. It should have known that by allowing\n                            Kamchatka to trade in the way just discussed, shipowners would enter\n                            contracts of carriage on the assumption that the Master could bind the\n                            owner.[emphasis added]120    Sovcomflot’s appeal against Moore\n                    J’s decision was heard by Ryan, Tamberlin, and Conti JJ who delivered a\n                    joint judgment inThe Ship “Socofl Stream” v\n                        CMC (Australia) Pty Ltd[2001] FCA 961 (“The Socofl Stream (merits; appeal)”). Counsel for\n                    Sovcomflot attacked Moore J’s reasoning on the issue of ostensible\n                    authority by arguing that it rested on the implied finding that, had Sovcomflot\n                    demanded the redelivery of the vessel to a port nominated by it, Kamchatka would\n                    necessarily have complied. He argued that, on the facts, Kamchatka would have\n                    ignored such a demand. The appellate judges stated at [20] that it was\n                    “unnecessary to resolve this question”. Instead, they held that,\n                    for the purpose of determining whether the master had been clothed with\n                    ostensible authority, it was necessary to focus on the events which transpired\n                    between Sovcomflot’s issuance of the termination notice and the time\n                    CMC’s cargo was loaded and the bills of lading issued. On this analysis,\n                    they had no doubt that Sovcomflot – by its conduct of allowing cargo to be\n                    loaded onto the vessel rather than taking steps to make clear that it was no\n                    longer on demise charter – had represented to third parties that the\n                    master had ostensible authority to bind it which was relied on by CMC (see\n                    [37]):In the present case, it was said that there was no evidence of reliance by\n                        CMC on any conduct. We disagree.In our view, the\n                            relevant conduct by Sovcomflot was its allowing the \"Socofl Stream\" to\n                            take on cargo after 15 December 1998 for which the master or his agent\n                            issued bills of lading. The evidence does not exclude the natural\n                            inference thatSovcomflot, at any time\n                            after 15 December 1998, could have made clear by arresting the ship (as\n                            it ultimately did) or otherwise, that the ship no longer had the\n                            disponent owner's authority to take on cargo and issue bills of\n                            lading. CMC relied on the conduct of\n                            Sovcomflot which we have just identified by having its agents at\n                            Singapore and Port Klang put consignments of steel on board the vessel\n                            and obtain bills of lading in respect of those consignments in the usual\n                            way.[emphasis added in italics and in bold italics]121    While the courts at first instance and on\n                    appeal focused on different aspects of Sovcomflot’s conduct, it seems\n                    clear to me that the general thrust of their reasoning was similar. The point\n                    was that, following Sovcomflot’s termination of the demise charter, it was\n                    informed of the possibility that Kamchatka might continue trading the vessel\n                    and, despite knowing that, Sovcomflot did not do anything to prevent Kamchatka\n                    from perpetuating this state of affairs. In the circumstances, Sovcomflot could\n                    not argue that the master had no authority to bind it when issuing bills of\n                    lading to third party shippers who loaded cargo onto the vessel. After all, as\n                    the appellate court observed inThe Socofl Stream (merits;\n                        appeal)at [22], such third parties generally operate on the\n                    assumption that they are dealing with either the actual or disponent owner of\n                    the vessel and would not know that there was a demise charter that had been\n                    terminated:…The assumption to be imputed to CMC is that, when the\n                            ship, in the person of the Master, received cargo on board and issued\n                            bills of lading, that was done on behalf of the actual or disponent\n                            owner of the ship for the time being.On that analysis,\n                        although there may have been a \"complete change\" of ownership by reason of\n                        Sovcomflot's termination of the demise charter to Kamchatka,that did not change any assumption which might reasonably have\n                            been made by third parties dealing with the ship. …\n                        [emphasis added]Whether the master had ostensible authority to bind HKC122    The parallels between theSocofl Streamcases and the present case are clear. In both\n                    cases, the vessels in question were under demise charters which were purportedly\n                    terminated by the issuance of a notice. Demands were also similarly made for the\n                    redelivery of the vessel but these were not complied with. The demise charterers\n                    in both cases also communicated their intentions to continue trading the vessel\n                    which they went on to do by loading cargo belonging to the respective\n                    plaintiffs.123    In fact, the argument for ostensible\n                    authority appears to be even stronger in this case. In theSocofl Streamcases, Sovcomflot was not provided with details of\n                    the shippers, whereas, here, Sejin provided full details of the shippers to HKC.\n                    HKC was therefore in a better position than Sovcomflot was to prevent the\n                    loading of cargoes and could have done so by taking the simple step of\n                    contacting the shippers but it failed to do so despite being informed of the\n                    details of prospective fixtures and an update on the movement of the Vessel on\n                    23 and 31 May 2011 respectively (see [19]–[20] above). By the time HKA\n                    issued its formal written reply some two weeks later on 14 June 2011, the Vessel\n                    had already completed loading cargoes belonging to KRC and Mercuria respectively\n                    and issued separate bills of lading in respect of each.124    I should mention that Mr Sejun Kim has\n                    stated in his affidavit that HKC was “very upset” to learn from\n                    Sejin’s 23 May 2011 letter that Sejin refused to return the Vessel. He\n                    stated that HKC then “complained” about the prospective fixtures,\n                    “objected” to the continued use of the Vessel, and\n                    “demanded” its immediate return. Notably, however, there was no\n                    documentary proof which showed that HKC did any of these things. This is\n                    particularly striking given that, during the critical period after the 4 April\n                    Notice had been issued, the parties frequently communicated their respective\n                    positions through written correspondence. Mr Sejun Kim’s bare assertions\n                    in this respect were unsupported with reference to the objective evidence before\n                    me.125    However, even if I accept Mr Sejun\n                    Kim’s assertions to be true, I fail to see how this assists HKC’s\n                    case. The purported termination of the Lease Agreement and the subsequent\n                    demands for redelivery were known only to the immediate contracting parties.\n                    What is important was that the Vessel’s change in status had not been\n                    brought to the attention of the outside world by some manifest act of HKC. As I\n                    had pointed out earlier in this judgment, third parties in the position of KRC\n                    and Mercuria do not have the benefit of a public registry to check whether a\n                    vessel is on bareboat charter. They therefore could not have been expected to\n                    know that the Lease Agreement had at one time been in force, let alone that it\n                    had been terminated. On the other hand, HKC had full knowledge of the state of\n                    play: it knew of the purported termination of the Lease Agreement and that,\n                    despite the purported termination, Sejin still intended to load cargo onto the\n                    Vessel. By failing to take any overt steps to prevent that, HKC must be taken to\n                    have represented to third parties that the master had the authority to bind\n                    it.126    In this connection, it must be emphasised\n                    that Sejin’s continued trading of the Vessel could hardly be described as\n                    surreptitious. Sejin was open in providing explicit information regarding the\n                    Vessel’s trading route under the prospective fixtures and also the names\n                    and addresses of the charterers whom it had contracted with, such as\n                    Frumentarius. Mr Tay rightly pointed out in his submissions that HKC could\n                    easily have contacted these charterers to inform them that Sejin no longer had\n                    any right to continue with the Vessel’s employment and that cargo should\n                    not be loaded on board. In fact, a more effective means at HKC’s disposal\n                    to prevent the Vessel from being traded was simply to have obtained a warrant\n                    for her arrest. This had in fact been contractually provided for in Art 26(5) of\n                    the Lease Agreement which states that HKC may unilaterally retrieve the Vessel\n                    at Sejin’s expense if Sejin delays the return of the Vessel. However, this\n                    right was never exercised. Mr Sejun Kim’s explanation for HKC’s\n                    inaction in this regard was that he “did not know where the Vessel was or\n                    how to retrieve the Vessel”. That, however, did not strike me as a\n                    convincing reason, especially when Sejin had provided an update on the\n                    Vessel’s location at Belawan and its subsequent trading route. In this\n                    regard, I note that Sovcomflot’s representative made similar arguments inThe Socofl Stream (merits; 1st instance), but,\n                    likewise, this argument did not gain much traction before Moore J (see\n                    [15]–[17]):Mr Izmailov said during cross-examination that when the charterparty was\n                        terminated no port for re-delivery was nominated because Sovcomflot did not\n                        know where the Vessel was. He appeared to accept that, in theory, he could\n                        have contacted Kamchatka to ascertain the location of the Vessel but said\n                        that to do so would have been useless. He also accepted that a way of\n                        finding out the whereabouts of the Vessel would have been to use the Lloyd's\n                        Register and other services which provided updates on the location of\n                        vessels. He asserted that after the notice of termination had been given,\n                        any trading by Kamchatka would be \"illegal\". He appeared to accept, however,\n                        that the Vessel might continue to trade after the notice had been given. He\n                        said that his expectation was, at the time the notice was given, that\n                        Kamchatka would agree to the notice and provide, I infer, a trading schedule\n                        of the Vessel identifying where it was located. …Mr Neill, CMC's solicitor, gave evidence about steps Sovcomflot could have\n                        taken to locate the Vessel. It was admitted over objection though the\n                        general thrust of the evidence was not challenged. Some of it was\n                        self-evident. The first means of locating the Vessel was by asking\n                        Kamchatka. The second was using one of two commercial tracking services,\n                        namely MRC or one maintained by Lloyd's. The third was through Sovcomflot's\n                        London solicitors though on the basis they would also use these commercial\n                        tracking services. The last was for Sovcomflot to inquire of their\n                        shipbroker. …I am satisfied that it would have been open to\n                            Sovcomflot to have ascertained the location of the Vessel before issuing\n                            the notice terminating the demise charterparty.It could have\n                        done so with a view to nominating a port for redelivery.I accept that the Vessel would not have been located immediately.\n                            However, by not taking steps to locate the Vessel as a step towards\n                            nominating a port for redelivery, Sovcomflot created a circumstance in\n                            which Kamchatka could continue to trade using the Vessel though no\n                            longer as a demise charterer.…[emphasis added]127    InThe Socofl Stream\n                        (merits; appeal), the appellate court referred to Moore J’s\n                    finding above and stated as follows at [56]:…[H]is Honour's finding … supports the conclusion\n                            that it was open to Sovcomflot to locate the vessel and circumscribe, in\n                            an appropriately public way, the master's authority to bind\n                            it.Such a conclusion is not tantamount to saying, as Counsel\n                        for Sovcomflot argued, that \"it may have been possible, if Sovcomflot had\n                        ordered its affairs entirely in order to protect the interests of persons\n                        such as [CMC], there were things which Sovcomflot could have done which may\n                        have prevented any loss to [CMC]\" … [original emphasis omitted;\n                        emphasis added in italics]128    Here, HKC did not need any assistance in\n                    locating the Vessel. HKC was kept informed of the Vessel’s sailing route\n                    at all material times. In light of the above, I fail to see how KRC and\n                    Mercuria’s alternative claims against HKC were “factually\n                    unsustainable” as Mr Heng argued. The manner in which events unfolded\n                    between the issuance of the 4 April Notice and the completion of loading at\n                    Belawan and Dumai supports the view that the master was clothed with ostensible\n                    authority to bind HKC. In the result, I find that KRC and Mercuria’s\n                    alternative claims should not be struck out.129    Let me be clear. A finding of ostensible\n                    authority is necessarilyfact-specific(see also\n                    [81] above). I have arrived at this finding because of HKC’s conduct inknowinglyallowing Sejin to continue loading\n                    cargoes notwithstanding the purported termination and its abject failure to take\n                    any steps to regain possession of the Vessel. It is not the case that every\n                    shipowner, after having terminated a bareboat charter, will inevitably\n                    thereafter be liable for the trading activities of the vessel on basis of the\n                    master’s ostensible authority. This would lead to the ironic situation\n                    where shipowners, in seeking to defeatin remclaims against the bareboat charterer by terminating the bareboat charter at the\n                    earliest opportunity, nevertheless end up with the same liability in a different\n                    form,ie, in the form of a direct claim by virtue\n                    of the doctrine of ostensible authority. This anomalous outcome was also noted\n                    by Finkelstein J inASP Holdingsin the passage\n                    which I have quoted above at [90].Conclusion130    In the premises, I allow the\n                    plaintiffs’ appeals in RA 426/2013, RA 1/2014, RA 2/2014, and RA\n                    6/2014 against the Assistant Registrar’s decision to set aside the fourin remwrits. I hold that Sejin was, on a\n                    balance of probabilities, still the bareboat charterer of the Vessel at the time\n                    the plaintiffs’ respective actions were commenced. I have given five\n                    alternative reasons for reaching this conclusion, although the last two are\n                    essentiallyobiter, given that the determination\n                    of the contractual termination issue against HKC is sufficient for me to allow\n                    the plaintiffs’ appeals:(a)     First, the 4 April Notice was\n                        invalidly issued by HKA because the right of termination had not been\n                        transferred to HKA under the ATA and/or the NCT.(b)     Second, the Lease Agreement had not\n                        been validly terminated by HKA becauseHKCdid\n                        not form the opinion that Sejin was facing difficulties in continuing its\n                        normal business activities required for the right to termination under Art\n                        24(2) and the 4 April Notice had, in any event, failed to identify the\n                        “cause” which led it to form such an\n                    opinion.(c)     Third,\n                        the non-payment of hiresimpliciterwas not a\n                        proper ground for the immediate termination of the Lease Agreement under Art\n                        24(2).(d)     Fourth,\n                        physical redelivery is required at common law to terminate a bareboat\n                        charter and even if this general rule can be contracted out of (a\n                        possibility which I have expressed my doubts on), that does not appear to be\n                        what the parties had done, especially given the presence of Art 26(3) in the\n                        Lease Agreement.(e)     Fifth, even if the doctrine of constructive redelivery were accepted\n                        as a part of our law (a position which I have also expressed reservations\n                        on), the Vessel had not been constructively redelivered to HKC because there\n                        was no clear and unequivocal act by Sejin capable of representing redelivery\n                        on the facts of this case.131    I also dismiss HKC’s appeals in RA\n                    8/2014 and RA 7/2014 to strike out KRC and Mercuria’s alternative claims\n                    in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011 respectively. I find that KRC and\n                    Mercuria’s claims are not factually unsustainable and thus should not be\n                    struck out.132    In the court below, the Assistant Registrar\n                    awarded HKC 90% of the costs for the setting aside applications and ordered\n                    costs against HKC in favour of KRC and Mercuria in respect of the unsuccessful\n                    striking out applications. The costs orders were to be taxed if not\n                    agreed.133    Before me, the plaintiffs have succeeded in\n                    their respective appeals while HKC’s appeals have been dismissed. There is\n                    no reason for me to depart from the usual order for costs to follow the event. I\n                    invited the parties to submit on costs. Their submissions on costs in the event\n                    that the plaintiffs’ appeals are allowed and HKC’s appeals are\n                    dismissed ranged from $12,000 to $19,500 plus reasonable disbursements for the\n                    hearing below (HKC’s new counsel who did not have conduct of the case\n                    below, did not submit on costs for the hearing below) and $5,000 to $7,000 for\n                    the plaintiffs’ appeals and $3,000 for HKC’s appeals. While HKC was\n                    represented by the same counsel for all the proceedings, the plaintiffs were\n                    separately represented except in the case of Frumentarius and KRC. They were\n                    represented by the same counsel, Ms Tan, who rightly submitted that there should\n                    only be one set of costs for Frumentarius and KRC.134    Although the facts are relatively\n                    undisputed, the appeals involved novel and interesting points of law. The\n                    hearing spanned a total of 14 calendar days though much time was spent on the\n                    unnecessary dispute over Korean law. However, it was HKC who put Korean law in\n                    issue. Though it might not have been necessary for the plaintiffs to respond to\n                    HKC’s reliance on Korean law, as was the experience of Mercuria, it was\n                    not unreasonable for them to have done so. Therefore, I would not discount the\n                    costs incurred in respect of the Korean law issue. Taking into account all the\n                    circumstances, I order HKC to pay the following costs:(a)     To Winplus – costs fixed at\n                        $15,000 for the hearing below and $5,000 for the appeal in RA 426/2013, both\n                        inclusive of disbursements.(b)     To Frumentarius and KRC – one set of costs fixed\n                        at $15,000 for the hearing below, $5,000 for the appeals in RA 1/2014 and RA\n                        2/2014, and $3,000 for RA 8/2014, all inclusive of\n                    disbursements.(c)     To\n                        Mercuria – costs fixed at $15,000 for the hearing below, $5,000 for\n                        the appeal in RA 6/2014, and $3,000 for RA 7/2014, all inclusive of\n                        disbursements.Acodaon the use of expert evidence in\n                the proof of foreign law135    Thiscodais\n                    necessitated by my observation that even though HKC’s applications first\n                    came up for hearing before the Assistant Registrar on 11 October 2012, the\n                    next day of hearing only commenced some nine months later on 2 July 2013. In my\n                    view, this lengthy delay between hearings is regrettable. After having reviewed\n                    the record of the proceedings below, it is clear that this delay was a result of\n                    a dispute between the parties over the opinion expressed by one of the Korean\n                    law experts. However, I am of the view thatallthe opinions filed in these proceedings were ultimately indistinguishable from\n                    submissions which offered the court no substantive assistance in terms ofproof of foreign law. All that trouble could\n                    have been avoided if an expert’s role in providing an opinion on foreign\n                    law was properly understood at the outset. That role, as I will explain, is also\n                    a targeted one where, as in the present case, the expert is asked to provide an\n                    opinion to aid the local court in theconstruction of private\n                        documentssuch as the Lease Agreement, NCT, and\n                ATA.136    In order to illustrate why the proceedings\n                    below were so protracted, it is necessary for me to first set out the various\n                    expert opinions in some detail.The prominent use of expert opinions belowThe expert evidence on Korean law137    There were three Korean law experts who had\n                    each filed multiple opinions in the proceedings below:(a)     Prof Kim was the expert appointed\n                        by HKC. He filed a total of three affidavits exhibiting his opinions prior\n                        to the commencement of the hearings below.(b)     Mr Soo Keun Kyung (“Mr Kyung”)\n                        was the expert appointed by Winplus. He filed two affidavits exhibiting his\n                        opinions prior to the commencement of the hearings below and a third\n                        affidavit thereafter to make a minor correction to his first\n                    opinion.(c)     Mr Jong\n                        Hyeon Choi (“Mr Choi”) was the expert jointly appointed by\n                        Frumentarius and KRC. He filed two affidavits exhibiting his opinions prior\n                        to the commencement of the hearings below. As I will explain, the opinion\n                        provided in his second affidavit was the source of the parties’\n                        dispute below and that led to him filing three further affidavits to clarify\n                        his position.(d)     To the credit of Mercuria, it consistently maintained the view that Korean\n                        law was irrelevant to the determination of the issues before the court and\n                        therefore elected not to file any affidavit on Korean law. Unfortunately,\n                        Mercuria was alone in this view.138    Each of the three experts filed at least two\n                    rounds of opinions prior to the commencement of the hearings below. I note that\n                    the views expressed in these opinions, in particular those of Prof Kim and Mr\n                    Kyung, covered extensive ground but, unfortunately, none was particularly\n                    relevant. Once one cuts through the chaff, it becomes apparent that, on the\n                    crucial question which the experts sought to provide an opinion on –viz, whether the 4 April Notice had terminated the\n                    Lease Agreement under Korean law – there essentially emerged two\n                    fundamental points of disagreement which were alluded to earlier in this\n                    judgment at [13] and [16]. In my view, these two points are best presented by\n                    tracking how they arose in the different rounds of exchanges between the\n                    experts.139    In the first round of opinions, the central\n                    point of departure between the experts was whether the 4 April Notice had been\n                    issued in compliance with Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement so as to constitute a\n                    valid termination. In Prof Kim’s opinion, Art 24(2) enabled HKC to\n                    exercise a right ofimmediatetermination; hence\n                    the reasons justifying such termination had to be “very serious\n                    ones”. He then went on to emphasise that Sejin’s failure to make\n                    rental payments for the past six months had resulted in arrears of a\n                    “very substantial amount”. When this was taken together with the\n                    sharp drop in the price of the Vessel and the poor market conditions (reasons\n                    which were not stated in the 4 April Notice), Prof Kim concluded that there was\n                    “enough for HKC to form its view” under Art 24(2) and to issue a\n                    termination notice as it did. Mr Choi disagreed. In his view, Art 24(2) clearly\n                    required a termination notice to specify the “cause” for\n                    termination but this was absent from the 4 April Notice whose validity was\n                    therefore “disputable”. This point was similarly raised by Mr\n                    Kyung.140    I pause here to make an important\n                    observation. The first set of legal opinions was disappointingly short on legal\n                    analysis. None of the experts endeavoured to provide any explanation whatsoever\n                    as to how their views were derived from particular Korean law principles or\n                    rules of interpretation and no such sources of foreign law had been cited in\n                    support of the conclusions reached. One is therefore left with the distinct\n                    impression that the experts’ conclusions were grounded in little more than\n                    their personal opinion rather than the result of a considered application of\n                    Korean law. Their opinions were entirely unhelpful and revealed a fundamental\n                    misapprehension of the role of expert evidence in the proof of foreign law. It\n                    therefore came as no surprise that the experts’ further round of opinions\n                    was afflicted with the same problems.141    The second round of expert opinions was\n                    dominated by the differing views of Prof Kim and Mr Kyung on the rather separate\n                    question of whetherHKAcould terminate the Lease\n                    Agreement by issuing the 4 April Notice (see [16] above). I should explain that\n                    this issue came to be at the forefront of their considerations because, in the\n                    first round of opinions, Mr Kyung noted that Prof Kim had wrongly assumed the 4\n                    April Notice to have been issued byHKC(rather\n                    thanHKA, as was the case). Mr Kyung pointed out\n                    that this was a “fundamental error” of fact and that Prof\n                    Kim’s opinion on the effectiveness of the 4 April Notice should be\n                    rejected as a result.142    Prof Kim sought to overcome Mr Kyung’s\n                    objection in his second opinion by stating that, even if HKA had sent the 4\n                    April Notice, this did not cause it to be invalid. He pointed to the NCT which\n                    appeared to transfer, in addition to the credits under the Lease Agreement,\n                    certain other “right[s]” or “status” to HKA (see\n                    [13] above). In Prof Kim’s interpretation, these terms encompassed theright to terminatethe Lease Agreement and so\n                    HKA could properly issue the 4 April Notice. Alternatively, Prof Kim stated\n                    that, even if HKC had retained the right to terminate, “HKA can be said\n                    to have terminated the Lease Agreement for and on behalf of HKC” as its\n                    authorised agent. It bears mention that none of these views were supported by\n                    any references to Korean law principles. In short, it was simply a matter of\n                    interpretation of the contractual documents before the court. In my view, such\n                    an argument could well have been presented by counsel before me in their own\n                    right. There was no enhancement in the value of the argument by having it\n                    articulated through the Korean law experts.143    As for Mr Kyung, he maintained in his second\n                    opinion that the issuance of the 4 April Notice by HKA (as opposed to HKC) was a\n                    fundamental defect. In particular, he disagreed with Prof Kim on the effect of\n                    the NCT. According to Mr Kyung, the NCT was “merely a notice” and\n                    so could not exceed the ATA in terms of what was transferred. Since the ATA only\n                    purported to transfer thecreditsunder the Lease\n                    Agreement, it followed that HKA could not acquire the altogether separate right\n                    to terminate the same despite what the NCT purported to transfer. It is again\n                    noteworthy, however, that Mr Kyung’s opinion here was similarly bereft of\n                    any references to Korean law principles although it is correct as a legal\n                    submission (see [44] above).144    As for Mr Choi, his second opinion was\n                    silent on whether the 4 April Notice could be issued by HKA. This\n                    “silence” became the source of much controversy in the proceedings\n                    below and that ultimately led to the wholly unnecessary delay between\n                    hearings.145    To be fair to the experts, it was not the\n                    case that their submissions were entirely devoid of references to legal\n                    authority. For example, the exchange between Mr Kyung and Prof Kim over the\n                    validity of the ATA in transferring the lease credits to HKA (see [11] above)\n                    was keenly contested on a point of legal principle. In his first opinion, Mr\n                    Kyung pointed out that Art 37 of the Lease Agreement required the transfer of\n                    rights belonging to HKC to be “with prior consent from [Sejin]”,\n                    yet the ATA, which purported to transfer HKC’s right to the lease credits\n                    to HKA, appeared to have been executed without such consent. In response, Prof\n                    Kim relied heavily on a judgment of the Supreme Court of Korea to establish\n                    that, as a matter of Korean law, an agreement not to transfer credits without\n                    the prior consent of the obligor (ie, Sejin) could\n                    only be raised against the transferee (ie, HKA)ifthe transferee knew of the agreement in the\n                    first place, and there was nothing to suggest that HKA knew of Art 37 of the\n                    Lease Agreement between HKC and Sejin.146    The problem, however, was that these\n                    references were of little assistance because they ultimately pertained to a moot\n                    point. The scope of what the ATA purported to transfer was merely thecreditsunder the Lease Agreement (see [11] and [44]\n                    above). Even if HKC succeeded in proving that the ATA was valid, this would only\n                    mean that the right to receive the credits was indeed transferred to HKA.\n                    However, the transfer ofcreditsunder the Lease\n                    Agreement does not, in and of itself, answer the critical question of whether\n                    HKA could properlyterminatethe Lease Agreement\n                    by issuing the 4 April Notice. The central inquiry is still whether theright to terminate the Lease Agreementhad\n                    been transferred to HKA and that point, in the experts’ views at least,\n                    turned on the construction of the words “right” or\n                    “status” in theNCTwhich,\n                    unfortunately, was a subject on which conclusions were reached without adequate\n                    reference to legal authority. In this regard, I note that the question of the\n                    validity of the ATA featured neither in the Assistant Registrar’s decision\n                    nor was it raised on appeal before me.147    It is therefore regrettable that the\n                    experts’ opinions on the appropriate construction of theNCTwere not supplemented with references to Korean law\n                    principles in the same way their opinions on the validity of the ATA\n                    were.The protracted nature of the proceedings below148    In the proceedings below, HKC was\n                    represented by Ms Vivian Ang (“Ms Ang”) but, by the time of the\n                    appeal before me, HKC had engaged new solicitors and was represented by Mr Heng.\n                    As for the plaintiffs in the four admiralty actions, they were represented by\n                    the same counsel throughout. Winplus was represented by Ms Sharmini,\n                    Frumentarius and KRC were represented by Ms Tan, and Mercuria was represented by\n                    Mr Tay.149    The first day of hearing before the\n                    Assistant Registrar commenced on 11 October 2012. It is notable that, at the end\n                    of this hearing, Ms Ang was recorded as having submitted that Mr Choi had\n                    “no issue with the April termination notice”. It appears that what\n                    Ms Ang had meant by this submission is that Mr Choi agreed with Prof Kim that\n                    the NCT was effective in transferring the right to terminate the Lease Agreement\n                    to HKA. This point was only followed up on some time later by Ms\n                Tan.150    The parties appeared before the Assistant\n                    Registrar the next day but this hearing was adjourned because an objection was\n                    raised that certain Korean documents which Prof Kim had referred to in his\n                    opinions had not been translated in full. Prof Kim was given until 5 November\n                    2012 to file and serve an affidavit with all additional translations and the\n                    Assistant Registrar also fixed four additional days of hearing on 19, 20, 21 and\n                    23 November 2012. On 5 November 2012, however, Ms Ang’s firm wrote to\n                    inform the court that her clients were unable to complete the translation of all\n                    the relevant Korean documents as they were quite substantial and requested for a\n                    one week extension. In light of this, the court wrote to all parties two days\n                    later informing them to attend a special pre-trial conference\n                    (“PTC”) on 15 November 2012.151    At the 15 November 2012 PTC, the Assistant\n                    Registrar inquired into the status of the translation and was informed that the\n                    relevant documents had already been filed and served. However, the Assistant\n                    Registrar was then informed by Ms Tan that Mr Choi had filed a third affidavit\n                    to clarify that, contrary to Ms Ang’s submission on the first day of\n                    hearing, he didnotagree with Prof Kim’s\n                    opinion on the effect of the NCT but was, instead, aligned with Mr Kyung on this\n                    issue. Ms Ang objected to this. In her view, Mr Choi was taking a\n                    “radically different” position in his third affidavit and thus she\n                    requested for time to advise her clients on the legal avenues available to them,\n                    including making an application under O 40A r 4 of the ROC for leave to put\n                    questions to Mr Choi in relation to his third affidavit. In the result, the\n                    Assistant Registrar vacated the four hearing dates which had earlier been\n                    scheduled and directed that if Ms Ang were minded to make an application under O\n                    40A r 4, she was to do so by 29 November 2012.152    The parties next attended before the\n                    Assistant Registrar at a PTC on 13 December 2012. Ms Ang informed the\n                    Assistant Registrar that she had yet to file an application under O 40A r 4. She\n                    explained that she had held back from doing so because her clients were\n                    exploring the possibility of transferring the issues which were subject to\n                    Korean law to be heard by the Korean courts. This was the first time that the\n                    other parties had heard of this proposal and, in the face of their resistance,\n                    Ms Ang eventually agreed to have the matter proceed in Singapore. She sought an\n                    extension of time to file the O 40A r 4 application and the Assistant Registrar\n                    directed that this be done by the following day. This was duly complied with. Ms\n                    Ang filed Summons No 6434 of 2012 (“SUM 6434/2012”) on 14\n                    December 2012 seeking leave to put questions to Mr Choi regarding his third\n                    affidavit. The hearing of this summons was fixed for 15 February\n                2013.153    Prior to the hearing of SUM 6434/2012, Mr\n                    Choi filed a fourth affidavit on 11 January 2013 in which he maintained that his\n                    third affidavit was merely clarificatory in nature and did not constitute a\n                    substantive change in his position. He explained that his silence on the effect\n                    of the ATA and NCT in his second opinion did not mean that he agreed with Prof\n                    Kim’s views and reiterated that he shared the same opinion as Mr Kyung on\n                    this issue. In conclusion, he stated that it was unnecessary for questions to be\n                    put to him pursuant to O 40A r 4. I pause to observe that Mr Choi was right in\n                    saying that his silence did not mean that he had agreed with Prof Kim as the\n                    burden of proof of foreign law rests with the party asserting it. However, after\n                    several rounds of hearings on 15, 20 February and 22 April 2013, the Assistant\n                    Registrar eventually granted leave for questions to be put to Mr Choi who was,\n                    in turn, required to provide his answers by 10 May 2013. Mr Choi complied by\n                    duly filing a fifth affidavit within the stipulated time. However, nothing of\n                    note emerged from this application.154    This long-drawn skirmish over Mr\n                    Choi’s position on the ATA/NCT issue finally drew to a close at a special\n                    PTC on 19 June 2013. The Assistant Registrar was informed that HKC would not be\n                    filing further affidavits in reply to Choi’s third, fourth, and fifth\n                    affidavits and this paved the way for HKC’s setting aside and striking out\n                    applications to recommence hearing. This was scheduled to take place on 2 July\n                    2013, regrettably almost nine months after the first day of\n                hearing.155    There were 13 days of hearings between 2\n                    July 2013 and the final day on 20 September 2013. Having perused the Notes of\n                    Evidence below, it is plain to me that the parties spent a considerable amount\n                    of this time poring over the experts’ various rounds of opinions and\n                    pitting one against the other on the two material points of departure that arose\n                    from their first two rounds of opinions. Was this at all necessary?\n                    Unfortunately not. The opinion of a foreign law expert is used toprovethecontentof that\n                    foreign law by reference to relevant sources of law. However, not only were the\n                    opinions poor guides to the content of Korean law, the parties themselves did\n                    not appear to think that the case would have been decided differently if Korean\n                    law, rather than Singapore law, applied. That being the case, I fail to see how\n                    it was relevant or useful for the parties to trawl through the opinions as they\n                    did below. Given this state of affairs, I consider it beneficial to express some\n                    views on the proof of foreign law in general before expounding, in particular,\n                    on what an expert’s opinion on foreign law should seek to encompass,\n                    particularly where the matter concerns the construction of private\n                    documents.156    Before doing so, I should mention that, from\n                    my reading of the Judgment below, little weight, if any, was eventually accorded\n                    to the opinions of the Korean law experts. Although the contest on the differing\n                    opinions on Korean law dominated the hearings before the Assistant Registrar,\n                    the opinions barely featured in the Judgment. Of the four principal grounds of\n                    her decision summarised in [33(a)] above, the only issue in which the Assistant\n                    Registrar appeared to have peripherally relied on Korean law was whether HKA\n                    could exercise the right of termination. In this regard, she preferred\n                    Mr Kyung’s opinion over Prof Kim’s that the ATA did not\n                    transfer the right to terminate and that the NCT could not transfer more rights\n                    than those transferred under the ATA. In my view, that was a conclusion capable\n                    of being reached based on a simple construction of the terms of the ATA and the\n                    NCT. The experts did not add any value to the analysis of that issue which, in\n                    any case, is a matter ultimately for the court to construe.Proof of foreign lawGeneral principles157    It is well-established that the content of\n                    foreign law is a question of fact which must be pleaded and proved. In general,\n                    however, parties are notobligedto do so even if,\n                    according to the rules of private international law, the issue at hand is\n                    governed by foreign law. Indeed, parties often have sound reasons for choosing\n                    to ignore foreign law. Undertaking to prove foreign law can be an expensive\n                    exercise. Furthermore, where an application of foreign law will lead to the same\n                    result as an application of the law of the forum, it is also unnecessary (see\n                    Pippa Rogerson,Collier’s Conflict of Laws(Cambridge University Press, 4th Ed, 2013) at p 50).158    Where, however, a party has pleaded and\n                    wishes to prove foreign law, he has two modes by which he can adduce such proof.\n                    As the Court of Appeal noted in the leading case ofPacific\n                        Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal[2008]\n                    2 SLR(R) 491 (“Pacific Recreation”)\n                    at [54], such a party has the option of (a) directly adducing raw sources of\n                    foreign law as evidence; and/or (b) adducing the opinion of an expert on foreign\n                    law. However, as the Court of Appeal went on to observe at [60], even if raw\n                    sources of foreign law were admissible under the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev\n                    Ed) (“Evidence Act”), it is still “preferable” for\n                    them to be accompanied by expert opinions whenever possible. This is simply\n                    “a matter of prudence” because our courts may well find it\n                    difficult to competently interpret such raw sources of foreign law unaided (seeWong Kai Woon alias Wong Kai Boon and another v Wong Kong\n                        Hom alias Ng Kong Hom and others[2000] SGHC 176 at\n                [55]).159    Where the foreign law is not proved, the\n                    content of foreign law will be presumed to be the same as the law of the forum\n                    (seeGoh Chok Tong v Tang Liang Hong[1997] 1\n                    SLR(R) 811 at [84]). This result is unsurprising. As the Court of Appeal\n                    explained inEFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik\n                        Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another[2014] 1 SLR 860 at [57],\n                    the court lacks knowledge of foreign law and must therefore be informed of its\n                    content by evidence from the parties. In the absence of satisfactory proof of\n                    foreign law, Singapore courts will simply apply Singapore law. The court will\n                    generally not take judicial notice of foreign law, subject to the exceptions\n                    provided in s 59 of the Evidence Act.The role of the foreign law expert generally160    The role of an expert in providing an\n                    opinion on foreign law was neatly summarised by Evans LJ inMCC Proceeds Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc and others[1999] CLC 417 (“MCC Proceeds”) and\n                    adopted by the Court of Appeal inPacific\n                        Recreationat [76]. According to Evans LJ, the three main duties\n                    of a foreign law expert are:(1) to inform the court of the relevant contents of the foreign law;\n                        identifying statutes or other legislation and explaining where necessary the\n                        foreign court's approach to their construction;(2) to identify judgments or other authorities, explaining what status\n                        they have as sources of the foreign law; and(3) where there is no authority directly in point, to assist the English\n                        judge in making a finding as to what the foreign court's ruling would be if\n                        the issue was to arise for decision there.161    It is clear from this exposition that the\n                    foremost function of an expert witness on foreign law is to inform the court of\n                    the relevantcontentsof the foreign law and he\n                    does so chiefly by placing the relevant sources of foreign law before the court,\n                    whether they be statutory or in the form of foreign decisions (seePacific Recreationat [77]). Indeed, this is a\n                    requirement under O 40A r 3(2)(b) of the ROC which\n                    states that an expert’s report must “give details of any literature\n                    or other material which the expert witness has relied on in making the\n                    report”.162    Evans LJ acknowledged, however, that there\n                    may well be circumstances where there is no authority directly in point. In such\n                    circumstances, there is much greater scope for the expert to give opinion\n                    evidence on the matter. However, it is notable that Evans LJ stressed at [24] ofMCC Proceedsthat the expert’s role was\n                    still restricted to “predict[ing] the likely decision of a foreign\n                    court” and not to “press upon the English judge the\n                    witness’s personal views as to what the foreign law might be”. This\n                    merely expresses the commonsensical view that the court can derive no meaningful\n                    assistance from the bare assertions of experts on foreign law advanced without\n                    any objectively explicable basis. This point was reinforced by the Court of\n                    Appeal inPacific Recreationat [85]:Whatever the case, it is clear that the expert cannot merely present his\n                        conclusion on what the foreign law is without also presenting the underlying\n                        evidence and the analytical process by which he reached his conclusion.\n                        …163    In the event that there are relevant sources\n                    of foreign law, the expert’s role generally extends further than simply\n                    placing them before the court: he should also explain the effect of such foreign\n                    law because the raw contents on their own might often mislead persons not\n                    familiar with the particular system of law (seePacific\n                        Recreationat [78]). Therefore, where the expert has cited\n                    foreign cases, he should seek to explain how the foreign court would regard it\n                    in terms of its precedential value. Likewise, where the court is concerned with\n                    the construction of a foreign statute, the expert should set out the relevant\n                    foreign rules of statutory construction and state his views on the meaning and\n                    effect of the foreign statute in question (seePacific\n                        Recreationat [79]). I pause to observe that it is somewhat\n                    ironic thatPacific Recreationwas repeatedly\n                    cited by HKC to remind the opposing experts of theirdutiesto the court even though the more important lesson to be\n                    extracted fromPacific Recreationconcerned theroleof experts in the proof of foreign\n                    law.The limited role of the foreign law expert in the construction of\n                private documents164    It is important to note for present\n                    purposes, however, that the foreign law expert’s role is more\n                    circumscribed where he is asked to provide the court with an opinion concerning\n                    the construction of a private document. In such circumstances, expert evidence\n                    is only admissible for the “limited purpose” of identifying the\n                    relevant foreign law principles of construction andnotfor the additional purpose of expressing an opinion as to\n                    the true construction applying those principles (seePhipson\n                        on Evidence(Hodge M Malek gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 18th Ed,\n                    2013) at para 33-83; see also Richard Fentiman,International\n                        Commercial Litigation(Oxford University Press, 2010) at para\n                    6.39). This nuanced distinction was also recognised by the Court of Appeal inPacific Recreationat [81]:…[I]t should be noted that the expert's role differs\n                            slightly when the issue is the construction of a foreigndocument,\n                            as opposed to a foreignstatutory\n                            provision.InKing v Brandywine Reinsurance Co[2005] 1 Lloyd's\n                        Rep 655, the court had to consider the meaning of the phrase \"removal of\n                        debris\" contained in an insurance policy document which was governed by New\n                        York law. Waller LJ incisively stated at [68] that:It is perhaps also important to remember thatthe role of an expert, unless the court is concerned with\n                                    special meanings, is to prove the rules of construction of the\n                                    foreign law, and it is then for the court to interpret the\n                                    contract in accordance with those rules. In other\n                                words the view of the expert as to the meaning which would be given\n                                to the word \"debris\" isnot admissibleevidence unless he is saying that it has a special meaning under New\n                                York law [see Dicey & Morris 13th ed., 32-189].[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold]165    The proposition set out by Waller LJ inKing v Brandywine Reinsurance Co[2005] 1\n                    Lloyd’s Rep 655 in the passage above has been repeatedly endorsed by the\n                    English courts (see,eg,Rendall v Combined Insurance Co of America[2005] EWHC 678\n                    (Comm) at [68];Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue\n                        and Customs and another v Ben Nevis (Holdings) Ltd and others[2012] EWHC 1807 (Ch) at [41]). A good illustration of its application can be\n                    seen inRouyer Guillet Et Compagnie v Rouyer Guillet & Co\n                        Ltd[1949] 1 All ER 244. There, the defendants were English\n                    companies which had applied to stay an action for passing off against them\n                    commenced by the plaintiff French company. The applications essentially turned\n                    on the construction of two sources of foreign law: (a) a 1925 French statute;\n                    and (b) a document which was, in effect, the articles of association of the\n                    French company. Expert evidence was adduced in respect of both these matters and\n                    what is particularly instructive is the different treatment accorded to each of\n                    them by the English Court of Appeal. This can be seen in the speech of Lord\n                    Greene MR (with whom Somervell and Evershed LJJ agreed) at 244:I must make it clear that the evidence of French law is\n                            subject toa certain differentiationas between the evidence of the meaning of\n                            the law of 1925 and the evidence of the meaning of the\n                            articles.As I understand the law of England, evidence as to\n                        the meaning of the statute is to be obtained from the evidence of expert\n                        French witnesses and the decisions of the French courts. On a matter of\n                        French law the decision of a French court would be most persuasive.On the other hand,evidence on the construction of a private document, such as articles of\n                            association, is admissible so far as it deals with French rules of\n                            construction or French rules of law or the explanation of French\n                            technical terms, but evidence as to its meaning after those aids have\n                            been taken into account is not admissible. It is for the court to\n                            construe the document, having fortified itself with the permissible\n                            evidence.… [emphasis added in italics and in bold\n                        italics]166    The origin of the principle as articulated\n                    above appears to stretch back to the early case ofThe\n                        Duchess Di Sora v AL Phillipps and others, executors, etc(1863)\n                    10 HLC 624 (“Di Sora”). InDi Sora, the court had to construe a particular article\n                    in a pre-nuptial agreement executed in Rome in the Italian language between\n                    parties domiciled there. Many Italian witnesses were examined at the first\n                    instance hearing in order to elucidate the legal meaning and effect of this\n                    single article. When the matter came up before the House of Lords, however, it\n                    was noted that there appeared to be some confusion over the role of expert\n                    opinion in the construction of a foreign private document. This state of\n                    relative uncertainty was neatly summed up in the opening passages of Lord\n                    Chelmsford’s speech at 636–637:My Lords, this case, in which the evidence fills so large a volume, and\n                        which has occupied so many days in hearing the arguments only of the counsel\n                        for the Appellants, turns upon the construction of one short clause in a\n                        written contract executed in a foreign country. Hence has arisen the\n                        necessity of having recourse to witnesses skilled in the law of that\n                        country, in order to assist the English Judge in his duty of construing the\n                        clause in question. This necessity has given rise to a controversy at the\n                        bar as to the extent to which the Judge requires and is bound to accept the\n                        opinions of these skilled witnesses. The limits within which experts in\n                        foreign law (always assuming their credibility), are to be authoritative in\n                        cases in which their aid is required, seem never to have been exactly\n                        defined. …… [It] is said on one side, that upon a question of the\n                        construction of a contract, the province of the witnesses ought to be\n                        confined to giving information as to the law of the country applicable to\n                        the case, and as to the sense of words and phrases in the instrument which\n                        bear a peculiar or technical meaning, or which, taken together, require a\n                        peculiar construction, and that the mind of the Judge will then be\n                        sufficiently instructed to enable him to assume the office of construction\n                        which properly belongs to him.On the other side it is contended that the skilled witnesses must be the\n                        guides of the Judge, and must lead him by the hand throughout; that they\n                        must not only inform his mind as to the law, but must teach him the correct\n                        construction of the instrument itself. …167    Lord Chelmsford then went on to explain why,\n                    of the two contrasting approaches as set out above, the latter was wrong in\n                    principle. In his view, the true construction to be placed on a private document\n                    was a question of law to be answered by the judge who would, if he merely\n                    adopted the views of the foreign experts uncritically, be derelict in his\n                    duties. Viewed in this manner, the role of the expert must therefore be confined\n                    to the giving of evidence on thecontentof the\n                    foreign law, such as the relevant rules of construction. As Lord Chelmsford\n                    stated at 638–639 ofDi Sora:…[I]t is difficult to understand how the construction of a\n                            contract can be a question of fact. The construction of a contract is\n                            nothing more than the gathering of the intention of the parties to it\n                            from the words they have used.If the law applicable to the\n                        case has ascribed a peculiar meaning to particular words, the parties using\n                        them must be bound to that meaning; but if there is no such established\n                        sense, the intention must be collected in the ordinary manner from the\n                        language employed, and we know from experience that different minds often\n                        arrive at opposite conclusions of intention from the same expressions.The meaning of a foreign instrument, therefore\n                            (cleared of the difficulty of technical terms), cannot be a fact to be\n                            proved; it is at the utmost merely a probable opinion of the witnesses\n                            as to the construction which would be likely to be put upon it by the\n                            foreign tribunal. And if the Judge is implicitly to receive the opinion\n                            of the witnesses, or of the majority of them, they in fact perform his\n                            office, and construe the instrument for him.…The office of construction of a written instrument,\n                            whether foreign or domestic, brought into controversy before our\n                            tribunals, properly belongs to the Judge.In the case of a foreign instrument, he necessarily requires some\n                            person's assistance. In the first place he must have a translation of\n                            the instrument, a translator being (as I have already said) a\n                        witness as to the meaning and also the grammatical construction of the\n                        words.He must then have the way cleared for him by\n                            explanatory evidence, of any words which are of a technical description,\n                            or which have a peculiar meaning, different from that which, literally\n                            translated into our language, they would bear; and, if there is any\n                            established principle of construction of the particular instrument by\n                            the foreign tribunal, proof of it must be given.But the witnesses having supplied the Judge with all\n                            these facts, they must retire and leave his sufficiently informed mind\n                            to his own proper office—that of ascertaining for himself the\n                            intention of the parties; or, in other words, of construing the language\n                            of the instrument in question.[emphasis added in italics and in bold italics]The quality of the expert evidence in the present case168    Armed with a proper appreciation of the\n                    foreign law expert’s role, especially in the context of construing private\n                    documents, I turn now to consider the opinions of the three Korean law experts\n                    here to determine whether the experts had kept within their remit.169    InWu Yang Construction\n                        Group Ltd v Zhejiang Jinyi Group Co, Ltd and others[2006] 4\n                    SLR(R) 451 at [14], Andrew Phang Boon Leong J (as he then was) stated that the\n                    ability of the (domestic) court to make an informed decision on a question\n                    determinable by reference to foreign law “is dependent largely on the\n                    quality of the expert evidence adduced”. It should be clear by now that I\n                    was less than impressed by the quality of the expert opinions in the present\n                    case. Round after round of opinions were filed but, each time, they were wide\n                    off the mark in terms of whatshouldhave been\n                    addressed. There was little attempt by any of the experts to put forward and\n                    explain the sources of foreign law which they were relying on to aid the\n                    court’s construction of the Lease Agreement, ATA and NCT, but where they\n                    did cite such foreign sources of law, for example to establish the validity of\n                    the ATA, this turned out to be irrelevant. To put it bluntly, the experts were\n                    offering their personal views of the matter instead of assisting this court with\n                    evidence of the content of foreign law. InThe\n                        “H156”[1999] 2 SLR(R) 419, G P Selvam J noted\n                    perceptively at [14] that the expert opinion there consisted only of “one\n                    judgmental sentence” which was also unaccompanied by any propositions of\n                    foreign law or foreign materials to support the expert’s conclusion. In\n                    these circumstances, Selvam J witheringly described the expert’s report at\n                    [27] as a mere “pretended opinion” and held that any reliance\n                    placed on it would be “completely misconceived because there was no\n                    opinion before the court”. In my view, Selvam J’s observations are\n                    equally applicable in the present case.170    To compound matters, the experts’\n                    opinions here were not only problematic for what they lacked but also for what\n                    they contained. In my view, the experts were effectively makingsubmissionson what the true construction of the\n                    relevant documents should be. In doing so, they had clearly overstepped their\n                    role which, as I have explained, is limited only to the provision of the rules\n                    of construction under Korean law. For example, it was not for Prof Kim to opine\n                    on the meaning of the terms “right” and “status” as\n                    used in the NCT and to conclude that incorporated within these terms was\n                    precisely the right to terminate the Lease Agreement as HKC hoped to establish.\n                    Neither was it for Mr Kyung and Mr Choi to interpret the requirements of Art\n                    24(2) of the Lease Agreement and conclude that the 4 April Notice was\n                    deficient by reference to those requirements. They merely expressed their own\n                    views on these issues without attempting to provide the court with any source of\n                    Korean law in aid of their conclusions.171    To clarify, I am not suggesting that the\n                    experts were necessarily wrong in their submissions. All I am saying is that\n                    this is not the role of the foreign law expert. It is the court’s duty to\n                    determine the correct construction of a private document but, unfortunately, the\n                    parties appeared not to have appreciated this point. The protracted battle over\n                    the expert opinions (which dominated the hearings below) only served to prolong\n                    matters unnecessarily and at great cost. It is hoped that, in future, such a\n                    misunderstanding on the role of foreign law experts will not be repeated. Having\n                    said that, it is the duty of the Singapore instructing counsel to apprise the\n                    foreign law experts of their limited and targeted role.",
        "Subsequent correspondence and the continued trading of the\n                Vessel": "17     There was no formal written response from\n                    Sejin to the 4 April Notice. Instead, Mr Sejun Kim stated that he had a meeting\n                    with the Chief Executive Officer of Sejin, Mr Keunhyuk Park (“Mr\n                    Park”), sometime in mid-April 2011 to discuss matters. According to Mr\n                    Sejun Kim, Mr Park asked him whether the termination could be revoked and the\n                    Lease Agreement revived. In response, Mr Sejun Kim replied that the Lease\n                    Agreement had been terminated and that this termination could not be revoked\n                    with a mere promise by Sejin to pay the outstanding rental. 18     On 9 May 2011, the Chief Executive Officer of\n                    HKA who signed off on the 4 April Notice, Mr Jaejeong Yoo (“Mr\n                    Yoo”), issued a further notice to Mr Park reiterating that Sejin had\n                    “lost all the benefit of time” for payment of the rental arrears.\n                    In the notice, Mr Yoo demanded immediate payment of sums due as well as the\n                    return of the Vessel by 13 May 2011. However, Sejin failed to do\n                either. 19     On 23 May 2011, Sejin wrote in response to\n                    HKA’s 9 May letter. Sejin explained that it had been unable to discharge\n                    its monthly payment obligations because frequent breakdowns of the Vessel had\n                    affected her normal sailing schedule. However, Sejin went on to inform HKA that\n                    it “finally … [had] the opportunity to pay the entire overdue\n                    lease amount” out of freight earnings under certain prospective\n                    sub-charters which it had entered into. The details of these fixtures were\n                    provided to HKA and included a charterparty dated 13 May 2011 which Sejin\n                    had entered into with the plaintiff in Admiralty in Rem No 197 of 2011\n                    (“ADM 197/2011”), Frumentarius Ltd (“Frumentarius”),\n                    for a voyage from Belawan, Indonesia to Taman, Russia. Sejin stated that the\n                    freight earnings from these fixtures would amount to roughly US$1.7m and\n                    requested that the deadline for repayment of the outstanding rental sums be\n                    changed to 17 June 2011. I pause to observe that the charter-hire arrears at\n                    this stage only amounted to 289,430,562 Korean Won (approximately US$261,445.52\n                    at the current exchange rate). Sejin concluded its letter with the following\n                    statement: “If our company cannot keep the above payment promise, we\n                    promise that our company will agree to all the actions your company will take,\n                    and will implement all the instructions related to the ship\n                    retrieval.” 20     Sejin did not receive any written response\n                    from either HKC or HKA until 14 June 2011. Sejin continued to trade using the\n                    Vessel in the intervening period and, on 31 May 2011, provided HKA with a\n                    written update that the Vessel had entered Belawan and was in the process of\n                    loading palm oil cargo. Sejin also stated that the Vessel would proceed next to\n                    Dumai, Indonesia for additional loading before heading towards the Mediterranean\n                    Sea and then the Black Sea for discharge. Neither HKC nor HKA reacted to\n                    Sejin’s advice on the Vessel’s loading schedule in spite of the\n                    purported termination of the Lease Agreement. 21     In accordance with the itinerary outlined in\n                    Sejin’s letter, the Vessel completed loading three parcels of palm oil\n                    cargo at Belawan on 4 June 2011. The cargo was owned by the plaintiff in\n                    Admiralty in Rem No 198 of 2011 (“ADM 198/2011”), a Russian\n                    company known as KRC Efko-Kaskad LLC (“KRC”). KRC had\n                    sub-chartered the Vessel from Frumentarius for carriage of its goods to Taman.\n                    The Vessel then proceeded to Dumai, where she completed loading an additional\n                    parcel of palm oil cargo on 11 June 2011 owned by the plaintiff in Admiralty in\n                    Rem No 201 of 2011 (“ADM 201/2011”), a Swiss company known as\n                    Mercuria Energy Trading SA (“Mercuria”), to be shipped to Huelva,\n                    Spain. On 13 June 2011, while at Dumai, the Vessel also stemmed bunkers which\n                    were supplied by the plaintiff in Admiralty in Rem No 184 of 2011 (“ADM\n                    184/2011”), Winplus Corporation Co Ltd\n                (“Winplus”). 22     On 14 June 2011, HKA issued a formal written\n                    response to Sejin’s letter dated 23 May 2011. In this response, HKA made\n                    reference to the 4 April Notice and its letter of 9 May 2011 and stated that, in\n                    light of Sejin’s non-compliance with the demands for payment and return of\n                    the Vessel, Sejin’s conduct was “an embezzlement and subject to\n                    criminal penalty”. HKA further stated that it could not fully accept\n                    Sejin’s request to postpone the deadline for repayment and then set out a\n                    number of conditions which Sejin had to fulfil if it wanted to revive the Lease\n                    Agreement. Despite HKA’s position, however, the Vessel was neither\n                    redelivered nor was payment of the arrears made by Sejin. Instead the Vessel\n                    proceeded from Dumai to Singapore where she arrived on 16 June 2011. On 30 June\n                    2011, the Vessel took on more bunkers, which were also supplied by\n                    Winplus. 23     In his affidavit, Mr Sejun Kim stated that he\n                    had learnt of the Vessel’s presence in Singapore from Mr Park on 29 June\n                    2011 and HKA immediately sent out a final notice for its redelivery. Sejin\n                    responded in a letter dated 4 July 2011 stating,inter\n                        alia, that it was not intentionally delaying the return of the\n                    Vessel and elaborating, “[w]e wanted to return the ship safely through\n                    the ship’s normal sailing route, but the situation does not allow us to do\n                    that so far”. On 15 July 2011, Sejin sent a further letter to Mr Sejun\n                    Kim which, while pertaining mostly to the description of certain transhipment\n                    arrangements, also contained the following statement: “we will do our\n                    best to return the ship to Korea as soon as possible.”",
        "The arrest and sale of the Vessel": "24     Despite Sejin’s express desire toeventuallyredeliver the Vessel to HKC, that\n                    was never in fact done because, on 28 July 2011, Winplus filed anin remwrit against the Vessel to commence ADM 184/2011\n                    and arrested her in Singapore on the same day. Winplus’ invocation of the\n                    court’s admiralty jurisdiction was based on its claim solely against\n                    Sejin, the demise charterer of the Vessel, for the unpaid bunkers which were\n                    supplied in Dumai and in Singapore. 25     On 8 August 2011, three furtherin remwrits commencing ADM 197/2011, ADM 198/2011\n                    and ADM 201/2011 were issued against the Vessel by Frumentarius, KRC, and\n                    Mercuria respectively. All three writs named the owners and/or demise charterers\n                    of the Vessel as defendant. Frumentarius’ claim was for the loss or damage\n                    arising from the breach of the charterparty entered into with Sejin, while KRC\n                    and Mercuria’s claims arose from the non-delivery of their cargoes to\n                    Taman and Huelva respectively. 26     Between 22 and 23 August 2011, HKC entered\n                    appearances in all thein remactions as the\n                    registered owner of the Vessel. Sejin did not enter any\n                appearances. 27     On 7 October 2011, after the parties with\n                    cargo remaining on board the Vessel had arranged for their transhipment, the\n                    court ordered the Vessel to be appraised and sold. As the bids received did not\n                    meet the Vessel’s appraised value, the court approved of its sale below\n                    the appraised value on 23 December 2011.",
        "The applications by HKC": "",
        "HKC’s setting aside applications": "28     On 29 February 2012, HKC filed similar\n                    applications in all four admiralty actions seeking,inter\n                        alia, to set aside the writs and all subsequent proceedings taken\n                    in these actions on the basis that the court’sin\n                        remjurisdiction had not been properly invoked. 29     The crux of HKC’s case both here and\n                    below was that the Lease Agreement had been terminated by the 4 April Noticepriorto the issuance of thein remwrits in all the actions. If HKC’s\n                    submission is correct, the plaintiffs would fail in establishing a crucial\n                    jurisdictional fact under s 4(4)(b)(i) of the\n                    HCAJA,viz, that Sejin, as “the relevant\n                    person”, was the bareboat charterer of the Vessel at the time when the\n                    various actions were brought. If that is so, the writs must be set aside on the\n                    basis that the court had no jurisdiction. 30     The plaintiffs strenuously denied that the\n                    Lease Agreement had already been terminated at the time their respective actions\n                    were commenced. Their arguments (both here and below) proceeded along the\n                    following lines: (a)     First, HKA had merely been\n                        transferred a right to claim the credits under the Lease Agreement and had\n                        not, whether by way of the NCT or the ATA, acquired a right to terminate the\n                        same. Thus, the 4 April Notice issued by HKA was ineffective in\n                        purporting to terminate the Lease Agreement. (b)     Second, even if HKA had the right to terminate\n                        the Lease Agreement, the 4 April Notice was nevertheless ineffective because\n                        it failed to comply with certain requirements under Art 24(2), such as the\n                        specification of the relevant “cause” for\n                    termination. (c)     Third,\n                        the plaintiffs further submitted that a bareboat charter could generally be\n                        brought to an end only upon physical redelivery of the vessel. Thus, the\n                        Vessel in this case, having never been physically redelivered, still\n                        remained on bareboat charter to Sejin when thein\n                            remwrits were issued.",
        "HKC’s striking out applications": "31     As mentioned earlier, two of the four writs\n                    contained alternative claims brought directly against HKC as the registered\n                    owner of the Vessel. These were the writs issued by the cargo interests, KRC and\n                    Mercuria, in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011 respectively. They claimed that\n                    (even if the Lease Agreement had been terminated by the 4 April Notice)in personamliability attached to HKC, who, in\n                    permitting cargo to be loaded and in permitting the master to issue bills of\n                    lading for the same, had clothed the master with ostensible authority to bind\n                    HKC as the registered owner of the Vessel. If this is correct, then the\n                    court’s admiralty jurisdiction would have been properly invoked as against\n                    HKC since there is no question that HKC, as “the relevant person”\n                    in this alternative claim, remained the registered owner of the Vessel at the\n                    time when these actions were brought. 32     In its applications filed in ADM 198/2011 and\n                    ADM 201/2011, HKC sought to strike out these alternative claims under O 18 r 19\n                    of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) and/or\n                    the inherent jurisdiction of the court.",
        "The decision below": "33     The Assistant Registrar’s decision may\n                    be summarised as follows: (a)     In respect of HKC’s setting\n                        aside applications, the Assistant Registrar held that the Lease Agreement\n                        was terminatedpriorto the issuance of the\n                        writs. Hence, the court’s admiralty jurisdiction was wrongly invoked\n                        insofar as they were based on Sejin’sin\n                            personamliability. She reasoned thus: (i)       First, although the ATA\n                            and/or the NCT did not transfer HKC’s right to terminate the Lease\n                            Agreement to HKA, HKA was nevertheless impliedly or apparently\n                            authorised to issue the 4 April Notice for and on behalf of HKC based on\n                            the conduct of the parties (see the Judgment at [42],\n                            [46]–[48]). (ii)       The 4 April Notice complied with Art 24(2) of\n                            the Lease Agreement (see the Judgment at [64]). In particular, the\n                            “cause” for termination,viz, Sejin’s non-payment of rental arrears, was\n                            sufficiently clear from the 4 April Notice and this was borne out by,inter alia, the background against\n                            which this notice had been sent and the parties’ subsequent\n                            correspondence which showed that Sejin did not question or challenge the\n                            termination (see the Judgment at [67]–[69]). (iii)       The 4 April Notice was\n                            not sufficient on its own, however, to terminate the Lease Agreement. At\n                            common law, a bareboat charter was brought to an end only when the\n                            vessel had been physically redelivered and even though this general rule\n                            could be contracted out of by the parties, the terms of the Lease\n                            Agreement in this case made it clear that physical redelivery of the\n                            Vessel was required for effective termination (see the Judgment at [112]\n                            and [122]). (iv)       Notwithstanding the need for physical\n                            redelivery, a bareboat chartered ship could beconstructivelyredelivered if there was “some\n                            step or acknowledgment by the charterer to give effect to the\n                            redelivery” (see the Judgment at [126]). In this regard, Mr\n                            Park’s acknowledgment at his meeting with Mr Sejun Kim in\n                            mid-April 2011 that the 4 April Notice was a notice of termination\n                            constituted constructive redelivery of the Vessel (see the Judgment at\n                            [129]). Alternatively, Sejin’s declarations of intent to redeliver\n                            the Vessel on 4 and 15 July 2011 were also sufficient to effect\n                            constructive redelivery. The Lease Agreement had therefore terminated on\n                            15 July 2011 at the latest (see the Judgment at\n                            [136]–[137]). (b)     In respect of HKC’s application to strike out KRC\n                        and Mercuria’ s alternative claims in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011,\n                        the Assistant Registrar found that these claims were not so legally and\n                        factually unsustainable as to warrant being struck out. If it were accepted\n                        that the Lease Agreement had been terminated by mid-April 2011, then HKC\n                        could have made it clear that Sejin no longer had the authority to load\n                        further cargoes and issue bills of lading. It was also open to HKC to take\n                        steps to recover possession of the Vessel but it did not do so. In light of\n                        the foregoing, HKC indirectly represented to shippers (such as KRC and\n                        Mercuria) that Sejin had the authority to bind HKC to the bills of lading\n                        which were issued at the material time (see the Judgment at\n                    [153]).",
        "The present appeals": "34     The plaintiffs all appealed against the\n                    Assistant Registrar’s decision to set aside their respectivein remwrits. They argued that Sejin was still the\n                    demise charterer at the time their actions were commenced.

        "The plaintiffs’ appeals": "36     I begin by considering the plaintiffs’\n                    appeals against the Assistant Registrar’s decision to set aside theirin remactions on the basis that Sejin was no\n                    longer the demise charterer at the commencement of these actions. The Court of\n                    Appeal has made clear inThe “Bunga Melati\n                        5”[2012] 4 SLR 546 (“The Bunga\n                        Melati”) at [112] that when there is a challenge to the\n                    invocation of the court’s admiralty jurisdiction, the onus is on the\n                    arresting party to discharge the following burdens under s 4(4) of the\n                    HCAJA: (a) prove,on the balance of probabilities,\n                        that the jurisdictional facts under the limb it is relying on in s\n                            3(1)(d) to 3(1)(q) exist; and showan arguable\n                            casethat its claim is of the type or nature required by the\n                        relevant statutory provision (\"step 1\"); (b) prove,on the balance of probabilities,\n                        that the claim arises in connection with a ship (\"step 2\"); (c) identify,without having to show in\n                            argument, the person who would be liable on the claim in an\n                        actionin personam[ie, the “relevant person”] (\"step 3\"); (d) proveon the balance of probabilities,\n                        that the relevant person was, when the cause of action arose, the owner or\n                        charterer of, or in possession or in control of, the ship (\"step 4\");\n                        and (e)proveon the balance\n                            of probabilities, that the relevant person\n                            was, at the time when the action was brought: (i) the\n                        beneficial owner of the offending ship as respects all the shares in it orthe charterer of that ship under a demise\n                            charter; or (ii) the beneficial owner of the sister ship as\n                        respects all the shares in it (\"step 5\"). [original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold] 37     In the context of the plaintiffs’\n                    appeals, all parties agreed that the “relevant person” under step\n                    3 is Sejin and that the dispute centres only on step 5: was Sejin, on a balance\n                    of probabilities, still the demise charterer of the Vessel at the time the fourin remactions were brought? 38     The parties’ arguments on appeal were\n                    broadly similar to what they had advanced below and may be briefly summarised.\n                    On one hand, HKC submitted that the 4 April Notice issued by HKA constituted a\n                    valid and sufficient termination under Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement. Thus,\n                    HKC argued that Sejin was not the demise charterer of the Vessel at the time the\n                    writs were brought. On the other hand, the plaintiffs submitted that the 4 April\n                    Notice was invalid because,inter alia, HKA did\n                    not have the right to terminate the Lease Agreement. They also submitted, in the\n                    alternative, that physical redelivery of the Vessel was essential for the\n                    termination of the Lease Agreement and yet this was never done. The plaintiffs\n                    also submitted that the doctrine of constructive delivery, which the Assistant\n                    Registrar had recognised and applied, ought not to be a part of our law. In the\n                    result, they argued that Sejin was still the demise charterer of the Vessel at\n                    the time the writs were brought. 39     These arguments raise the following\n                    sub-issues, each of which I will deal with in turn: (a)     Was HKA’s issuance of the 4\n                        April Notice a valid contractual termination of the Lease Agreement under\n                        Art 24(2) (“the contractual termination\n                    issue”)? (b)     Was\n                        physical redelivery of the Vesselfurtherrequired to bring about effective termination (“the physical\n                        redelivery issue”)? (c)     If so, should Sejin nonetheless be regarded as having\n                        constructively redelivered the Vessel (“the constructive redelivery\n                        issue”)? The contractual termination issue 40     Before proceeding to examine the merits of the\n                    contractual termination issue, there is a preliminary point that needs to be\n                    disposed of. Sejin, in its correspondence with HKC/HKA, did not appear to\n                    challenge the validity of the termination under Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement\n                    and has not entered appearance in these proceedings to do so. This raises the\n                    question of whetherthe plaintiffs, as strangers\n                    to the Lease Agreement, can question the validity of its termination given that\n                    this has not been challenged bySejin. 41     As I have stressed at the outset, the question\n                    of termination is not merely a contractual issue affecting the immediate\n                    contracting parties,ie, Sejin and HKC. It has a\n                    pivotal bearing on the jurisdiction of this court in respect of the fourin remwrits issued against Sejin. There is no\n                    dispute that questions affecting the jurisdiction of the court are to be\n                    determined by thelex fori(seeThe “Kapitan Temkin”[1998] 2 SLR(R) 537).\n                    HKC’s reliance on the bald opinion of its expert witness (Prof In Hyeon\n                    Kim (“Prof Kim”)) that “the Korean court is unlikely to\n                    accept any objection from a third party such as Winplus where the parties to the\n                    Lease Agreement and the Notice of Transfer are not questioning the same”\n                    is unhelpful. In my view, on issues that go to the root of the court’s\n                    jurisdiction, it is entirely appropriate for the court to examine the objective\n                    evidence in order to be satisfied as to whether jurisdiction has been made\n                    out. 42     The admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court\n                    is conferred by statute and exists where the requisite statutory conditions have\n                    been satisfied; it cannot be conferred by the agreement or waiver of the parties\n                    if it does not exist under the HCAJA (seeThe “Ohm\n                        Mariana” ex “Peony”[1992] 1 SLR(R) 556\n                    at [15] andThe “Alexandrea”[2002] 1 SLR(R) 812 at [10]–[11]). Similarly, the admiralty jurisdiction\n                    of this court exists in this case only if the requisite statutory conditions\n                    have been satisfied (ie, if Sejin was the demise\n                    charterer at the time the writs were brought). HKC’s submission that the\n                    doctrine of privity of contract would preclude the plaintiffs from challenging\n                    the termination, with respect, misses the point. The issue here is one of\n                    jurisdiction and not one of contract. The plaintiffs were not seeking, as\n                    non-parties, to sue on the Lease Agreement (which is a purely contractual\n                    point). Rather, they were seeking to show that the court has jurisdiction in\n                    this matter because the Lease Agreement was still valid when thein remwrits were issued – that is a\n                    jurisdictional issue. I agree that it is open to the plaintiffs to challenge the\n                    validity of the termination so as to establish jurisdiction in aid of the\n                    enforcement of their respective claims notwithstanding Sejin’s apparent\n                    acceptance of the termination. 43     Counsel for Winplus, Ms Yogarajah Sharmini\n                    (“Ms Sharmini”), helpfully drew my attention to two cases where\n                    the validity of the termination of the bareboat charters was examined by the\n                    court on points not pursued by the bareboat charterers. InShips “Hako Endeavour”, “Hako Excel”,\n                        “Hako Esteem” and “Hako Fortress” v Programmed\n                        Total Marine Services Pty Ltd(2013) 296 ALR 265\n                        (“The Hako Fortress”), the\n                    arresting party (not the bareboat charterer) argued that the notice of\n                    termination was invalid as it was served at an address different from that\n                    specified in the bareboat charter. Similarly inASP Holdings\n                        Ltd v Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd(2006) 235 ALR 554\n                        (“ASP Holdings”), the arresting\n                    party attacked the validity of the termination notice on points which were not\n                    raised by the administrator of the bareboat charterer. In both cases, the court\n                    nonetheless examined the points raised by the arresting parties to determine\n                    whether the bareboat charters had been validly terminated pursuant to the\n                    notices. In the case ofThe Hako Fortress, the\n                    court held that the notice was valid while inASP\n                        Holdings, the court accepted the argument raised by the arresting\n                    party and found the notice to be invalid. These cases illustrate that the\n                    validity of a termination notice – which has a material impact on\n                    jurisdiction – can and must be examined by the court notwithstanding the\n                    fact that the bareboat charterer might have accepted the termination as being\n                    valid. (1)   HKA did not acquire the right to terminate the Lease\n                Agreement under the ATA and/or the NCT 44     The contractual termination issue received\n                    much attention by the experts. Much ink was spilled on the question whether the\n                    right to terminate the Lease Agreement had been transferred under the ATA and/or\n                    the NCT. On this issue, I agree with the Assistant Registrar that the ATA did\n                    not purport to transfer the right of termination from HKC to HKA and that the\n                    only asset which was transferred thereunder was the credit payable to HKC under\n                    the Lease Agreement. On this score, there can be no dispute that the right to\n                    terminate was not transferred under the ATA. I also agree with the Assistant\n                    Registrar that the NCT could not be relied on by HKA to terminate the Lease\n                    Agreement since it served merely as a notice to Sejin of the intended credit\n                    transfer and could not transfermorerights than\n                    was transferred under the ATA. In this context, it is pertinent to note that the\n                    NCT was servedpriorto the execution of the ATA.\n                    Accordingly the operative instrument which dealt with the transfer of the\n                    “assets” was the ATA and no more. (2)   The requisite opinion under Art 24(2) must have been formed\n                by HKC 45     The Assistant Registrar, having arrived at the\n                    above finding, then proceeded to find that HKA had implied and/or apparent\n                    authority to issue the 4 April Notice on behalf of HKC. This is where I part\n                    company with the Assistant Registrar’s reasoning. I am of the view that\n                    this inquiry is premature. Instead, I am of the view that a more fundamental\n                    question arises from the plain wording of Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement.\n                    Article 24(2) was set out earlier but I reproduce it again for ease of\n                    reference: In the event [HKC] is of the opinion that[Sejin] is facing difficulties in continuing its normal business activities\n                        due to any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to reasons of\n                        application for bankruptcy, compulsory composition or company rehabilitation\n                        procedure or work-out, giving rise to concerns about [Sejin’s] ability\n                        to perform its obligations to [HKC] or to maintain or manage the Vessel,[HKC] may terminate this Contract with notification\n                            specifying the causetowards [Sejin]. [emphasis added] 46     It is clear that there are two conditions\n                    precedent to the exercise of the right of termination under Art 24(2). First, it\n                    is necessary forHKCto form anopinionthat Sejin is unable to carry on with its normal\n                    business activities. Second, HKC must specify thecausefor the formation of theopinionin the notification sent to Sejin. I shall deal with the\n                    second condition later. For now, I observe that the first condition premises the\n                    right to termination on the formation of a subjective,bona\n                        fideopinion byHKCregarding\n                    Sejin’s circumstances and the viability of the Lease Agreement. However,\n                    there was simply no evidence by any of the experts (whether under Korean law or\n                    otherwise) that this requirement could be satisfied upon proof thatHKA(and notHKC) had\n                    formed the requisite opinion. 47     The Privy Council’s decision inLoke Hong Kee (S) Pte Ltd v United Overseas Land\n                        Ltd[1981–1982] SLR(R) 424 (“Loke\n                        Hong Kee”), which arose on appeal from a decision of the\n                    Court of Appeal in Singapore, is apposite. In that case, the court had to\n                    consider a clause in a building contract which entitled the respondent employer\n                    to determine the appellant contractor’s employment if,inter alia, the works were “in the opinion of the\n                    [respondent’s] architect unsatisfactory”. Lord Keith of Kinkel\n                    (delivering the judgment of the Board) interpreted this particular provision at\n                    [11] as follows: … The phrase \"in the opinion of the architect unsatisfactory\" which\n                        appears in art V(3) carries the kind of subjective connotation which is\n                        necessarily associated with words expressive of satisfaction or\n                        dissatisfaction.It is the view of the particular\n                            architectas to what is or is not satisfactory which is to be\n                        the criterion, not any objective standard. … [emphasis added] 48     The lack of any evidence to suggest that HKC\n                    had formed the requisite opinion when the 4 April Notice was issued is therefore\n                    an insuperable barrier to HKC’s present claim that the Lease Agreement was\n                    validly terminated by HKA in accordance with Art 24(2). I note that Mr Sejun Kim\n                    filed an affidavit on HKC’s behalf in these proceedings to state that HKC\n                    had indeed been gravely concerned about Sejin’s continued performance of\n                    the Lease Agreement at the material time (see [14] above). He elaborated that\n                    several factors were responsible for HKC arriving at this view,viz, (a) Sejin’s failure to make rental payments\n                    for a period of six months; (b) the Vessel’s substantial depreciation in\n                    value; and (c) the extremely bad worldwide market conditions for trading the\n                    Vessel. However, apart from the non-payment of rental arrears, the two other\n                    points were not stated in the 4 April Notice. Further, Mr Sejun Kim’s\n                    assertions were not supported by any sort of contemporaneous evidence: there\n                    was, for example, no email or other written evidence showing that HKC had formed\n                    and communicated such opinion to HKA before the latter proceeded to issue the 4\n                    April Notice. This may be usefully contrasted withLoke Hong\n                        Keewhere there was clear evidence at [6]–[7] that the\n                    respondent had only exercised its right to terminate the appellant’s\n                    employment after receiving a letter from its architect explaining the basis of\n                    his opinion that the progress of the works was unsatisfactory. Mr Sejun\n                    Kim’s assertions, it should be added, were also not supported by any\n                    affidavit from Mr Yoo of HKA confirming that the purported termination by HKA\n                    had indeed been exercised on the basis of HKC’s opinion. 49     I observe that Prof Kim had stated in his\n                    first opinion that, given the circumstances described by Mr Sejun Kim, there was\n                    “enough for HKC to form its view” to terminate the Lease Agreement\n                    under Art 24(2) (see [139] below). Whether or not Sejin’s circumstances\n                    were serious enough to warrant termination in HKC’s opinion is irrelevant.\n                    The pertinent question is whetherHKCdid,in fact, form such an opinion. This point is,\n                    self-evidently, something which only HKC can know and which therefore only HKC\n                    can make good through the evidence of its authorised representatives. Prof Kim\n                    had been offered as an expert witness. He was not a factual witness who had been\n                    called to give evidence on HKC’s behalf. Accordingly, it was entirely out\n                    of bounds for Prof Kim to expresshis own opinionas to what would constitute circumstances serious enough forHKCto form an opinion that the Lease Agreement should be\n                    terminated. I further observe that Prof Kim had also gone on to express in his\n                    second opinion that even if HKA did not have the express right to terminate the\n                    Lease Agreement in issuing the 4 April Notice, HKA was nevertheless authorised\n                    to do so for and on behalf of HKC (see [142] below). It bears repeating that\n                    this is a matter which Prof Kim has no personal knowledge of. In fact, his\n                    opinion on this issue was completely without foundation because there is nothing\n                    on the face of the 4 April Notice to suggest that HKA was issuing it on behalf\n                    of HKC. Ultimately, Prof Kim’s apparent zeal to cover all bases in support\n                    of HKC’s position here has, in my assessment, served only to compromise\n                    his standing as an expert. 50     In summary,even\n                        ifHKA were authorised to terminate the Lease Agreement (as the\n                    Assistant Registrar had gone on to find), it could only do so under Art 24(2) if\n                    HKC had formed the requisite opinion, but there is no evidence on which I am\n                    able to conclude that it did. Thus, the 4 April Notice did not validly terminate\n                    the Lease Agreement under Art 24(2). Nevertheless, before I leave this point, I\n                    should express some views on the Assistant Registrar’s finding of\n                    HKA’s apparent authority to issue the 4 April Notice (see [33(a)(i)]\n                    above). She correctly cited relevant authority to demonstrate that, for apparent\n                    authority to arise, there must be: (a) a representation by the principal to a\n                    third party that the agent had the authority to enter into the transaction on\n                    its behalf; and (b) reliance by the third party on the principal’s\n                    representation. 51     However it must be emphasised that the\n                    doctrine of apparent authority is typically relied onby a\n                        third partyto prevent the principal from resiling from\n                    transactions entered into by the agent. The doctrine isnotopen to be invokedby the\n                        principalas a means of retrospectively legitimising or\n                    validating the otherwise unauthorised acts of its agent in the absence of\n                    ratification. The doctrine of apparent authority has therefore been described in\n                    G E Dal Pont,Law of Agency(LexisNexis\n                    Butterworths, 3rd Ed, 2014) (“Dal\n                    Pont”) at para 20.3 as having a “negative” as\n                    opposed to “positive” impact. This can be traced to the widespread\n                    judicial acceptance of its theoretical underpinning in the doctrine ofestoppel(see,eg,Rama Corporation Ld v Proved Tin and General Investments\n                        Ld[1952] 2 QB 147 at 149;Freeman &\n                        Lockyer (a firm) v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd and\n                        another[1964] 2 QB 480 at 503;ING Re (UK)\n                        Ltd v R&V Versicherung AG[2006] 2 All ER (Comm) 870 at\n                    [99]). Hence, the doctrine of apparent authority has erstwhile been referred to\n                    as “agency by estoppel” (seeThe Law of\n                        Contract in Singapore(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy\n                    Publishing, 2012) (“The Law of Contract in\n                        Singapore”) at para 15.040). Once it is recognised that\n                    apparent authority is based on estoppel, the uni-directional manner of its\n                    operation becomes clear: it may be called in aid by a third party to prevent the\n                    principal from denying the authority of his agent which he has represented to be\n                    genuine but, crucially for present purposes, it does not allow the principal to\n                    positively assert or rely on the apparent authority of his agent to improve his\n                    position. Many commentators have therefore stated that a principal may not rely\n                    on the apparent authority of its agent toenforcea contract which the latter has entered into (see Peter Watts and F M B\n                    Reynolds,Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency(Sweet\n                    & Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2014) at para 8-029; Roderick Munday,Agency: Law and Principles(Oxford University Press,\n                    2nd Ed, 2013) at para 4.49;The Law of Contract in\n                        Singaporeat para 15.044;Dal Pontat para 20.3). I do not see why the outcome should be any different where the\n                    principal seeks to rely on the same to argue that such a contract has beenterminatedto his advantage. 52     For the reasons stated above, I find that,\n                    with respect, the Assistant Registrar erred in her application of the doctrine\n                    of apparent authority. HKC (the apparent principal) cannot rely on HKA’s\n                    apparent authority to issue the 4 April Notice to assert that the Lease\n                    Agreement had been validly terminated. (3)   Sejin’s non-payment of rentalsimpliciteris a cause for termination under Art 24(1) and not Art\n                24(2) 53     In my view, there is a further difficulty with\n                    HKC’s argument that the 4 April Notice validly terminated the Lease\n                    Agreement under Art 24(2). According to para 3 of the 4 April Notice, it appears\n                    that HKA relied on the fact that Sejin had “lost all the benefit of time\n                    of debt” as the basis for asserting its right of termination under Art\n                    24(2) against HKA (see [15] above). The experts disagreed as to whether this\n                    sufficiently specified the “cause” of termination as required\n                    under Art 24(2). That dispute led the Assistant Registrar to consider the\n                    conduct of the parties prior to and subsequent to the issuance of the notice to\n                    determine whether Sejin was under any confusion as to the cause for the\n                    termination. However, I consider that the 4 April Notice is beset with a more\n                    fundamental problem. It appears to me that the purported reason given,viz, Sejin’s non-payment of rental arrearssimpliciter, cannot even trigger the right to\n                    terminate underArt 24(2)to begin with. Let me\n                    explain. 54     Article 24(2) is a general provision which\n                    allows for the termination of the Lease Agreement. It is preceded by Art 24(1),\n                    which sets out aseparateprocedure for\n                    terminating the Lease Agreement predicated on the occurrence of certain clearly\n                    defined events. Article 24(1) is a lengthy provision but it suffices for me to\n                    reproduce only the following portion: Article 24 (Termination of\n                            contract) 1. [Sejin] shall notify\n                        immediately in the event of any of following [sic] has been caused by [Sejin] or its joint guarantor. Once\n                        [HKC] acknowledges that any of the following items were caused by [Sejin],\n                        regardless of receiving notifications,[HKC] shall notify\n                            [Sejin] to rectify the cause within 10 days. This contract can be\n                            terminated if the cause is not rectified within the period.\n                        However, the contract can be terminated immediately for item 8 to 14. (1)More than one delay in payment as\n                                    required by the contract from [Sejin] to [HKC].… [emphasis added] 55     Article 24(1) of the Lease Agreement sets out\n                    a clear schema for an exercise of the right of termination. It lists a total of\n                    14 specific events. If the first seven are present, it is unambiguously stated\n                    that HKC shall issue arectification noticeto\n                    Sejin and it is only if Sejin fails to make the necessary rectification after\n                    the expiry of a ten day period that the right to termination arises. For the\n                    next seven, HKC has the right toimmediatetermination without needing to give Sejin a period of time to make\n                    rectification. 56     Sejin’s failure to make its monthly\n                    rental payments timeously falls within the former category of events. In my\n                    view, the comprehensive list of events as set out in Art 24(1) of the Lease\n                    Agreement shows that the parties had painstakingly addressed their minds to the\n                    situations in which termination should be preceded by the issuance of a prior\n                    rectification notice and those which should give rise to an immediate right of\n                    termination. The failure to make timely payment of rental belongs to the former\n                    category. Holding that this same ground, without more, can nevertheless provide\n                    cause forimmediateterminationwithout prior noticeunder Art 24(2) would render Art 24(1)\n                    otiose and would remove from Sejin a contractual safeguard against immediate\n                    termination which – on a proper construction of the termination regime in\n                    Art 24 – it appears the parties intended for Sejin to\n                have. 57     This begs the question: what, then, is the\n                    ambit of Art 24(2)? Article 24(2) appears to be worded quite broadly: it states\n                    that the Lease Agreement may be terminated in the event that HKC is “of\n                    the opinion that [Sejin] is facing difficulties in continuing its normal\n                    business activitiesdue to any reason\n                    whatsoever… [HKC] may terminate\n                    this contract with notification specifying the cause towards [Sejin]”\n                    [emphasis added]. However, one must be careful not to place undue emphasis on\n                    this italicised phrase or divorce it from the rest of the clause. The\n                    “cause” (which Sejin must be notified of) is notanyreason underlying the termination at large. Instead,\n                    on my interpretation of Art 24(2), the “cause” mustspecificallyrefer to the reason why HKC has formed its\n                    opinion that Sejin “is facing difficulties in continuing its normal\n                    business activities”. And, in this connection, it is of some significance\n                    that Art 24(2) has enumerated by way of illustration a list of events that might\n                    make it difficult for Sejin to continue its normal business activities,eg, application of bankruptcy, compulsory\n                    composition, and company rehabilitation procedure. While these reasons are\n                    expressly stated to be non-exhaustive, their collocation discloses the\n                    parties’ intentions that the particular reason relied on for termination\n                    under Art 24(2)without prior noticemust bear\n                    some relation toSejin’s ability to operate as a going\n                        concern.Properly construed, Sejin’s mere inability to pay\n                    its debts to HKCsimpliciterdoes not fall within\n                    this category. Instead, that event is governed by Art 24(1) which specifically\n                    provides that termination on this ground must be preceded by a rectification\n                    notice. 58     For completeness, I will add that there is no\n                    evidence before the court that, at any time prior to the 4 April Notice, Sejin\n                    had been sent any notices to effect immediate rectification. Thus, there is no\n                    basis for concluding (and neither did HKC raise such a point) that the Lease\n                    Agreement had been terminated under Art 24(1). (4)   Conclusion 59     In summary, I find that the 4 April Notice was\n                    invalid for three reasons. First, HKA had not been transferred the right of\n                    termination and therefore could not have terminated the Lease Agreement under\n                    Art 24(2). Second, a valid termination under Art 24(2) is premised on HKC having\n                    first formed an opinion that Sejin could not continue its normal business\n                    activities. On the facts, HKC had not formed such an opinion. Third, the\n                    non-payment of rental arrearssimpliciteris not a\n                    “cause” that gives rise to a right of immediate termination under\n                    Art 24(2). In the premises, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that\n                    Sejin remained the demise charterer under the Lease Agreement at the time the\n                    plaintiffs’ respectivein remactions were\n                    commenced. Hence I allow the plaintiffs’ appeals against the Assistant\n                    Registrar’s order to set aside the fourin\n                        remwrits. There is strictly no need for me to consider the\n                    remaining two issues which I had outlined earlier at [39] but, as I heard\n                    extensive submissions on both these matters, I will proceed to express my views\n                    on them. The physical redelivery issue 60     Assuming that the 4 April Notice constituted a\n                    valid notice of termination, the question then arises as to whether the notice\n                    itself was sufficient to terminate the Lease Agreement or whether Sejin was\n                    nevertheless additionally required to physically redeliver the Vessel to bring\n                    the Lease Agreement to an end. In more general terms, is physical redelivery\n                    necessary to terminate a bareboat charter? 61     This is a novel question of law insofar as\n                    Singapore is concerned but it has been judicially considered in several other\n                    Commonwealth jurisdictions, notably, in Australia (seePatrick Stevedores No 2 Pty Ltd v MV “Turakina”(1998) 154 ALR 666 (“The Turakina”),CMC (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Ship “Socofl\n                        Stream”[1999] FCA 1419 (“The\n                        Socofl Stream (jurisdiction)”),ASP\n                        Holdings,The Hako Fortress), New\n                    Zealand (seeThe “Rangiora”,\n                        “Ranginui” and “Takitimu”[2000] 1\n                    Lloyd’s Rep 36 (“The\n                    Rangiora”)) and Hong Kong (seeGulf Marine\n                        and Industrial Supplies Inc v The Demise Charterers of the Ship or Vessel MV\n                        ‘Trident Dawn’ (Qatar Flag)[1992] HKCFI 273). The\n                    Assistant Registrar undertook an extensive survey of these cases and eventually\n                    arrived at the following view on the state of the law regarding the need for\n                    physical redelivery (see the Judgment at [112]): … I am of the view that the guiding principle that may be drawn\n                        from the above authorities is that,in general, both a\n                            notice of termination and redelivery of the ship are required to\n                            terminate a demise charterparty so that control and possession by the\n                            demise charterer may be brought to an end. This is due to the\n                        unique nature of the demise charterparty. However, as a demise charterparty\n                        is in essence a contract between the owner and the charterer,parties are free to include terms in the demise charterparty as\n                            to how possession of the ship is to be terminated. Such terms may vary\n                            or affect the obligation of redelivery upon the termination of a demise\n                            charterparty.This is the common thread that may be found to\n                        run through all the cases considered on this issue. [emphasis added] 62     According to the Assistant Registrar, two\n                    clear propositions emerge from the cases. First, as a general rule, physical\n                    redelivery is necessary to terminate a bareboat charter and, second, parties may\n                    contract out of this rule through the use of specific provisions in the bareboat\n                    charter itself. I agree with the first but not the second. 63     I should mention that in their submissions on\n                    the physical redelivery issue, the parties relied on the common law and not on\n                    Korean law. Counsel for HKC, Mr Henry Heng (“Mr Heng”), argued\n                    that, on a proper reading of the relevant clauses in the Lease Agreement, it is\n                    clear that the parties have contracted out of the general common law rule\n                    requiring physical redelivery. However, according to counsel for the respective\n                    plaintiffs, the Lease Agreement did not have such effect and in fact contained a\n                    clause which reinforced the requirement of physical redelivery. 64     Before analysing the parties’\n                    submissions, I will first explain why I agree with the Assistant\n                    Registrar’s views on the general common law requirement for physical\n                    redelivery. (1)   The general rule at common law 65     The requirement of physical redelivery is\n                    intrinsically tied to the distinctive nature of a bareboat\n                charter. 66     A bareboat charter essentially operates as a\n                    lease of the vessel to the charterer. The services of the master and crew may or\n                    may not be superadded but, ultimately, what is critical is that they are for all\n                    intents and purposes the servants of the charterer, and, through them, the\n                    possession and control of the vessel is vested in the charterer (see Sir Bernard\n                    Ederet al,Scrutton on\n                        Charterparties and Bills of Lading(Sweet & Maxwell, 22nd Ed,\n                    2011) (“Scrutton”) at para 4-002).\n                    It has therefore been said that the hallmark of a bareboat charter is the\n                    transfer ofpossession and controlof the vessel\n                    from the owner to the charterer (seeThe “Guiseppe di\n                        Vittorio”[1998] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 136 at 156). A\n                    bareboat charter does not transfer legal or beneficial title in the vessel to\n                    the charterer but, because possession and control of the vessel resides in him\n                    for the duration of the charter, it is not incorrect to speak of him as having\n                    temporary ownership of the vessel or as being its ownerpro\n                        hac vice(seeMedway Drydock & Engineering\n                        Co Ltd v MV Andrea Ursula[1973] 1 QB 265 at 269). Thissemblanceof ownership explains why I stated\n                    at the outset of this judgment that third parties may well believe or assume, in\n                    their dealings with the bareboat charterer, that they are in fact dealing with\n                    the vessel’s true owner. 67     It is useful, for present purposes, to observe\n                    how the key elements of a bareboat charter,viz,\n                    the transfer of possession and control, are absent in other forms of charters.\n                    As explained inScruttonat para 4-003, under a\n                    charter which is not by demise, the owner agrees to render services by his\n                    master and crew to carry goods put on board his ship by or on behalf of the\n                    charterer. In these situations, control and possession remains with the owner at\n                    all times through the master and crew who continue to be his servants. This is\n                    so notwithstanding the temporary right of the charterer to have his goods loaded\n                    and conveyed in the vessel. 68     The fundamental difference between a bareboat\n                    charter and other forms of charters is described succinctly in Tan Lee Meng,The Law in Singapore on Carriage of Goods by\n                        Sea(Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 1994) at p 219, where the learned\n                    author states: … Whereas a shipowner who has demised his vessel lets out the\n                        entire vessel and hands over total control and possession to the demise\n                        charterer, a shipowner who has entered into a time charterparty or a voyage\n                        charterparty is merely letting out the cargo carrying capacity of the\n                        vessel, which is manned by his own master and crew and the vessel remains in\n                        the shipowner’s possession and under his control. 69     With these general observations in mind, I\n                    turn now to consider the cases on physical redelivery. I begin withThe Turakinawhich, as the Assistant Registrar observed\n                    at [77] of the Judgment, has been referred to in almost every case which has\n                    dealt with the point of law that concerns us here. In that case, the ship,Turakina, was sub-demise chartered from Deli\n                    Shipowners BV (“Deli”) to South Pacific Shipping Ltd\n                    (“SPS”) on the standard form known as Barecon 89. She was arrested\n                    in Sydney by the plaintiff stevedoring company pursuant to a claim for services\n                    rendered. The owner then applied for a release of the vessel on the basis that\n                    the court’s admiralty jurisdiction had been improperly invoked. The\n                    owner’s case was that the vessel was no longer on demise charter at the\n                    time when the proceedings for arrest were instituted because Deli had validly\n                    terminated it by issuing to SPS a notice of termination the day before. As in\n                    the present case, the crucial question which arose inThe\n                        Turakinawas whether the notice of termination was adequate to\n                    terminate the demise charter or whether physical redelivery was additionally\n                    required for this purpose. In this regard, the shipowner sought to rely on\n                    several cases involving the effective cancellation oftime\n                        chartersby the issuance of withdrawal notices to argue that\n                    Deli’s notice was sufficient for terminating thedemise\n                        charter. Tamberlin J was not persuaded by this approach. He\n                    rightly recognised at 675 that there was a “significant\n                    distinction” between a time or voyage charter and a demise charter before\n                    going on to observe as follows: … This distinction resides in the fact that in a non-demise charter\n                        there is no requirement for delivery or transfer of possession to the\n                        charterer at the commencement of the charter. Accordingly, redelivery cannot\n                        require a transfer back of possession. In such a case, the services provided\n                        to the charterer are terminated upon notice of withdrawal. However,in the case of a demise charter the vessel itself is\n                            let and possession is taken by the charterer. Therefore,once the vessel is withdrawn from the service of the\n                            charterer, an obligation to redeliver possession arises because\n                            possession has been delivered at the commencement of the\n                            charter. Redelivery, in its natural and\n                            ordinary meaning, denotes a delivery back of that which was originally\n                            delivered.… [emphasis added in italics and in bold\n                        italics] 70     The logic applied by Tamberlin J is simple\n                    and, in my view, sound. A bareboat charter commences only when the twin\n                    ingredients of possession and control have been transferred from owner to\n                    charterer. It is therefore brought to an end only if there is, by the same\n                    token, a transfer back of possession and control. It is difficult to see how\n                    that can be effected without a physical redelivery of the bareboat chartered\n                    vessel. Applying that reasoning, in the absence of physical redelivery, the\n                    demise charter was found to have remained valid inThe\n                        Turakinaand the owner’s application for the vessel’s\n                    release was accordingly dismissed. This finding was further reinforced by the\n                    terms of the bareboat charter which, at Cl 10(a), expressly stipulated that\n                    hire shall continue to be payable until the day and hour of redelivery of\n                    possession of the vessel. Tamberlin J then went on to observe at 677 that there\n                    was also no step or acknowledgment by the bareboat charterer to “give\n                    effect to the redelivery”. This observation, as will be elaborated below,\n                    became the source of inspiration for the doctrine of constructive\n                    redelivery. 71     The subsequent case ofThe\n                        Rangiorainvolved the arrest of three ofTurakina’ssister ships in Auckland, New Zealand. These\n                    vessels were also demise chartered by SPS from Deli on the Barecon 89 form. Deli\n                    had issued termination notices prior to the commencement of variousin remactions against the vessels and, again, the\n                    question arose as to whether or not the court’sin\n                        remjurisdiction had been properly invoked. Giles J noted at 52\n                    that the question of whether redelivery was necessary to terminate the demise\n                    charters constituted “the fulcrum of the case” and, on this\n                    crucial question, he agreed with Tamberlin J’s views inThe Turakina. The following passage from Giles J’s\n                    judgment at 55 is relevant: In my opinion,bearing in mind the two fundamental\n                            planks of a demise charter – the parting of both possession and\n                            control – the contract continues to have effect until both are\n                            withdrawn, (albeit unilaterally, in a breach situation), from\n                        the demise charterer.Notice of termination achieves\n                            resumption of, or cancellation of control but it does not effect\n                            redelivery.… [emphasis added] 72     In summary, the complete transfer of\n                    possession and control from the shipowner to the charterer is the very\n                    quintessence of a bareboat charter. Thus, physical redelivery (which effects a\n                    reversion of the transfer of possession and control) is necessary for its\n                    termination. (2)   Can one contract out of the general rule? 73     Mr Heng submitted that the parties in the\n                    instant case had contracted out of the general rule requiring physical\n                    redelivery. He referred me to several provisions of the Lease Agreement to make\n                    good his submission. Before dealing with the factual analysis whether the\n                    contractual provisions were sufficient to allow the parties to contract out of\n                    the general requirement for physical redelivery, I should state that I have\n                    serious reservations whether this could be done as a matter of\n                law. 74     The mere issuance of termination notices inThe TurakinaandThe\n                        Rangiorawere held to be insufficient to terminate the respective\n                    bareboat charters in the absence of physical redelivery. However, inThe Rangiora, Giles J went on to observe that it is open\n                    for maritime parties to make specific provision as to how redelivery is to be\n                    effected upon early termination. On the facts, however, Giles J held at 56 that\n                    the Barecon 89 form used inThe TurakinaandThe Rangioradid not provide for termination\n                    in the absence of physical delivery: I agree with the submission made by both Counsel for the plaintiffs thatthe deficiency here lies in the drafting of the\n                            contract. I hesitate to criticize a standard form deriving\n                        its pedigree from the Baltic and International Maritime Council. But, the\n                        reality is that at English law (and German law) a demise charter necessarily\n                        envisages a parting with possession and control.The\n                            Barecon 89 form goes to great length to deal with redelivery at\n                            expiration of charter period; it expressly provides for withdrawal for\n                            breach but it fails to address how \"redelivery\" is to be secured in that\n                            situation.I have no doubt that an\n                            experienced craftsman could cover \"redelivery\" in an early termination\n                            context in a way which would be contractually effective.It\n                        might include a \"deeming\" provision incorporating directions where a vessel\n                        was at sea and/or providing for a procedure constituting recovery of\n                        possession irrespective of the charterer’s obligations to others.For whatever reason that has been overlooked in the\n                            present form.It is thus left to the Court to resolve, paying\n                        due regard to the common law. … [emphasis added in italics and in\n                        bold italics] 75     It is correct that the Barecon 89 form\n                    contains a particular provision that is wholly consistent with the continuation\n                    of the bareboat charter up to the point of physical redelivery. This is found in\n                    Cl 10(a), the relevant portion of which prescribes that the bareboat\n                    charterer’s obligation to pay hire shall “continue until the date and hour when the Vessel is redeliveredby the Charterers to her Owners” [emphasis added]. As Giles J noted inThe Rangioraat 55, the fact that the contract\n                    recognises the continuing obligation to pay charter-hire until redelivery\n                    supports the view that redelivery is indeed necessary to terminate the bareboat\n                    charter. Tamberlin J also recognised at 676 ofThe\n                        Turakinathe importance of Cl 10(a) when he stated that this\n                    clause was a sufficient answer to the shipowner’s submission that SPS had,\n                    upon issuance of the termination notice by Deli, been reduced to a mere\n                    involuntary bailee of the vessel. 76     However, I fail to see how parties can\n                    contract out of the requirement of physical delivery. If it is accepted that the\n                    requirement for physical redelivery as a requirement for termination stems from\n                    the unique nature of a bareboat charter (viz, that\n                    it effects the complete transfer of possession and control), I do not see how\n                    parties can simply contract out of its performance. Until physical redelivery is\n                    achieved, the bareboat charterer continues to enjoy the full rights of control\n                    and possession of the vessel. Perhaps more crucially, third parties will\n                    continue to deal with bareboat charterers on the basis of their actual control\n                    and physical possession of the vessel. 77     It may be queried whether the view which I\n                    have preferred here is unduly prejudicial to shipowners. Damien J Cremean has,\n                    for instance, expressed the opinion inAdmiralty\n                        Jurisdiction: Law and Practice in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong\n                        Kong(The Federation Press, 3rd Ed, 2008) at p 185 that\n                    “there will occur cases where one would want to say a demise charter is\n                    over even though possession has not been able to be retaken – perhaps the\n                    demise charterer has put it out of the owner’s power to do so”. The\n                    concern articulated here seems to be one of fairness – why should ashipowner, who may experience difficulties\n                    securing the immediate or prompt redelivery of his vessel upon valid contractual\n                    termination, continue to be exposed to the risk of having his vessel arrested in\n                    the intervening period as a result of thecharterer’sunauthorised trading of the same? There is no\n                    doubt some attraction in this view but, to my mind, it fails to take into\n                    account the position ofthird partiesin the\n                    overall calculus of competing interests. 78     It is pertinent to stress that third parties\n                    who provide services to or load cargo on vessels will often be unaware that the\n                    particular vessel is on bareboat charter. Previously, this placed them in an\n                    acutely vulnerable position because bareboat chartered vessels were insulated\n                    from arrest. Following legal reforms in many jurisdictions, this is no longer\n                    the case (see [4] above). The consultation paper prepared by the\n                    Attorney-General’s Chambers which preceded the 2004 Amendment in Singapore\n                    noted that, although allowing a bareboat chartered vessel to be arrested might,\n                    at first blush, appear rather “startling” as it effectively\n                    allowed recovery against the shipowner for the liabilities of the charterer,\n                    this was nevertheless internationally acceptable and, on the whole, desirable\n                    because “an effective admiralty regime should not cast the burden of\n                    determining ownership or other relationship with the vessel on the person\n                    dealing with the vessel” (seeAdmiralty Jurisdiction\n                        of the High Court: Arrest of Ships on Demise Charter to Secure the\n                        Obligations of the Demise Charterer (Consultation Paper)(24\n                    April 2003) LLRD No 1/2003 at paras 4.3–4.4 and 4.8). The legislative\n                    scheme in Singapore today – as it is the case across many leading maritime\n                    jurisdictions – therefore appears to have struck the balance in favour of\n                    third parties who can now deal with a vessel safe in the knowledge that,\n                    regardless of whether the party with whom they directly transact is the owner or\n                    bareboat charterer, they can arrest the vessel as security for their\n                    claims. 79     In my judgment, holding that a validcontractualtermination suffices to bring a bareboat\n                    charter to an end in the absence of physical redelivery may upset the\n                    aforementioned balance. This is because third parties will find that it is no\n                    longer safe to assume that they have contracted with either the owner or\n                    bareboat charterer of a vessel inallcircumstances. If they deal with the vessel after contractual termination but\n                    before redelivery, it is possible that they may have in fact dealt withneither– the owner certainly does not\n                    have control and possession of the vessel during this curious period where she\n                    is in “limbo” whereas the party in full possession and control is\n                    no longer the bareboat charterer following contractual termination. In that\n                    event, the third party will have no basis for arresting the vessel and is thus\n                    left without security for its claim. This appears to me to cut against the\n                    spirit of the 2004 Amendment which, as I have stated, was aimed at lifting third\n                    parties from the burden of determining the true state of the relationship\n                    between owners and charterers. 80     I recognise, however, that it may still be\n                    possible for third parties to arrest the vessel in certain limited situations\n                    notwithstanding the contractual termination of the bareboat charter. This is\n                    where it is shown that the master had acted with the ostensible authority ofthe ownerin dealing with third parties, in\n                    which event the court’s admiralty jurisdiction may yet be validly invoked\n                    on the basis of the owner’sin personamliability. This was found to be so in the case involving theSocofl Stream(discussed below) which is, unsurprisingly, also\n                    the principal authority relied on by KRC and Mercuria to resist the striking out\n                    of their alternative claims against HKC in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011.\n                    On this view, one may argue that allowing a shipowner to contract out of the\n                    general rule may not be as harsh on third parties as it appears. 81     I am not persuaded by this argument. It is\n                    important to appreciate that theSocofl Streamexception does not arise automatically by operation of law. Instead, it is a\n                    fact-specific finding limited to circumstances resembling that in theSocofl Streamas discussed at [117]–[121] below.\n                    If it were otherwise, it would entirely defeat the shipowner’s purpose in\n                    terminating the bareboat charter to begin with (which is to prevent the vessel\n                    from being arrested in satisfaction ofin personamclaims against the bareboat charterer). TheSocofl\n                        Streamexception remains only of limited application and, with\n                    that being so, I am not convinced that it affords sufficient protection to third\n                    party interests. 82     Therefore, in my view, allowing a shipowner to\n                    contract out of the general rule requiring physical redelivery works unfairness\n                    on third parties because, ultimately, in the absence of such redelivery, it is\n                    difficult to see how the change in legal status of the vessel can be made\n                    apparent to them. A shipowner is fully aware that, by executing a bareboat\n                    charter, he vests complete possession and control of his vessel in the charterer\n                    who, as the vessel’s ownerpro hac vice, can\n                    incur liabilities in respect of the vessel’s usevis-à-visthird parties (even to the extent of exposing the\n                    vessel to the possibility of arrest). In other words, an owner who lets his\n                    vessel out on bareboat charter does so with his eyes wide open: he knows the\n                    risks attendant to such an arrangement and has made a considered commercial\n                    decision to proceed. By contrast, a third party has little way of knowing\n                    whether the vessel he is dealing with is on bareboat charter, let alone that the\n                    bareboat charter has been terminated. 83     When I examine the balance of competing\n                    interests in this context, it seems eminently fair to me that the risk ought to\n                    fall on the shipowner. I therefore consider the better position to be that\n                    partiescannotcontract out of the general common\n                    law rule which requires physical redelivery to bring an end to a bareboat\n                    charter. 84     I should point out, however, that the position\n                    which I have stated here has not been shared elsewhere. A case illustrating the\n                    proposition that parties can contract out of the general rule isThe Socofl Stream (jurisdiction). There, the court had\n                    to deal with an application by Sovremenniy Kommercheskiy Flot\n                    (“Sovcomflot”) to strike out thein\n                        remproceedings commenced by CMC (Australia) Pty Ltd\n                    (“CMC”) against the shipSocofl\n                        Streamin February 1999 on the basis that the court lacked\n                    jurisdiction. The relevant persons named in the writ issued by CMC were\n                    Sovcomflot, Kamchatka Shipping Company (“Kamchatka”), and Aurora\n                    Navigation SA (“Aurora”). Sovcomflot had demise chartered the\n                    vessel from its owners, Aurora, in 1990 and, in turn, sub-demise chartered it to\n                    Kamchatka in 1993. On 15 December 1998, Sovcomflot issued a notice purporting to\n                    terminate the sub-demise charter on the basis that Kamchatka had failed to make\n                    two quarterly payments of hire. Sovcomflot subsequently demanded redelivery of\n                    the vessel but Kamchatka did not comply and continued to trade the vessel by\n                    loading cargo (which was the subject of the proceedings) in Singapore and Port\n                    Klang, Malaysia in early January 1999. TheSocofl\n                        Streamwas finally arrested by Sovcomflot on 25 January 1999\n                    after it had entered the Port of Brisbane. In its striking out application,\n                    Sovcomflot argued that its 15 December 1998 notice was effective in terminating\n                    the sub-demise charter, notwithstanding Kamchatka’s failure to redeliver\n                    the vessel. Thus, Sovcomflot argued, the court had noin\n                        remjurisdiction over the vessel since Kamchatka was no longer\n                    the demise charterer at the date of commencement of the proceedings by CMC in\n                    February 1999. 85     One of the central questions which arose inThe Socofl Stream (jurisdiction)was the\n                    nature of the relationship between Sovcomflot and Kamchatka at the commencement\n                    of CMC’s action. Did Kamchatka remain the sub-demise charterer given its\n                    continued possession and control of the vessel? Or had Sovcomflot’s\n                    termination notice brought an end to the sub-demise charter at an earlier time?\n                    Moore J held that the latter view was correct. A key plank of his reasoning\n                    concerned Art 11(2)(a) of the sub-demise charter, which read (see [9]): (2)(a) If any Event of Default occurs and is not remedied within seven (7)\n                        business days from the date of telex notice by the Owner [ie, Aurora] or Disponent Owner [ie, Sovcomflot] as the case may be to the Charterer\n                            [ie, Kamchatka], then the Owner or\n                        Disponent Owner may, by telex notice to the Charterer, forthwith terminate\n                        this Agreement and upon such termination the Charterer shall forthwith pay\n                        to the Owner or Disponent Owner as the case may be a sum equal to the then\n                        outstanding Charter Hire Principal together with all other sums then due and\n                        unpaid under this Agreement and any other indebtedness of the Charterer\n                        under other agreements with the Owner and Disponent Owner and interest on\n                        the Charter Hire Principal calculated at the Default Rate for such period of\n                        time as the Charter Hire Principal remains overdue, whereupon the\n                        Charterer's obligation to pay the Charter Hire shall cease and the Owner or\n                        Disponent Owner as the case may be shall thereupon transfer title to the\n                        Vessel to the Charterer in the mannermutatis\n                            mutandisprovided in Articles 17 and 18 below. 86     In Moore J’s view at [27]–[28],\n                    this provision conferred on Sovcomflot a “clear contractual right”\n                    to terminate the sub-demise charter by giving a telex notice and, in such\n                    circumstances, it was “difficult to avoid a conclusion that … the\n                    charterer ceased to be a demise charterer from the time of termination at least\n                    in the absence of provisions in the charterparty that suggested some other\n                    result”. Moore J distinguishedThe Turakinaby observing as follows at [27]: In the present case the structure and terms of the 1993 sub-demise\n                        charterparty arematerially differentto those\n                        of the charterparty considered by Tamberlin J inThe\n                            \"Turakina\"and there isa clear\n                            contractual rightconferred by article 11(2)(a) on Aurora or\n                        Sovcomflot to terminate the 1993 sub-demise charterparty by giving a telex\n                        notice. It was exercised by Sovcomflot.There was no\n                            equivalent power to terminate in the charterparty considered by\n                            Tamberlin J.… [T]he 1993 sub-demise charterparty\n                        clearly contemplated, in my opinion, the termination of the demise charter\n                        by the notice.Unlike the charterparty in The \"Turakina\",\n                            the 1993 sub-demise charterparty did not contain provisions which fairly\n                            unambiguously point to the continuation of the demise charter pending\n                            redelivery of the vessel.… [emphasis added] 87     With respect, I do not find the distinction\n                    drawn by Moore J to be entirely convincing. Why should the contractual right to\n                    withdraw the vessel and to terminate by telex make such a significant\n                    difference? In my view, the latter is no different from the contractual right to\n                    withdraw the vessel for non-payment and to claim damages as was the case inThe Turakina. Neither clause changes the fact\n                    that the bareboat charterer continues to enjoy actual control and possession of\n                    the vessel pending actual physical redelivery. 88     It is worth noting that the revised Barecon\n                    2001 form, which succeeded Barecon 89, was introduced to address the practical\n                    difficulties faced by owners in retaking possession of their vessels when the\n                    bareboat charter is terminated while the vessel is on the high seas. Clauses 28\n                    and 29 of Barecon 2001 provide as follows: 28\n                        Termination (a) Charterers’ Default The Owners shall be entitled to withdraw\n                            the Vessel from the service of the Charterers and terminate the Charter\n                            with immediate effect by written notice to the Charterers\n                        if: (i)the Charterers fail to pay hire in\n                                    accordance with Clause 11.However, where there is a\n                                failure to make punctual payment of hire due to oversight,\n                                negligence, errors or omissions on the part of the Charterers or\n                                their bankers, the Owners shall give the Charterers written notice\n                                of the number of clear banking days stated in Box 34 (as recognised\n                                at the agreed place of payment) in which to rectify the failure, and\n                                when so rectified within such number of days following the\n                                Owners’ notice, the payment shall stand as regular and\n                                punctual.Failure by the Charterers to pay hire\n                                    within the number of days stated in Box 34 of their receiving\n                                    the Owners’ notice as provided herein, shall entitle the\n                                    Owners to withdraw the Vessel from the service of the Charterers\n                                    and terminate the Charter without further\n                                notice; … 29\n                        Repossession In the event of the termination of this Charter in accordance with the\n                        applicable provisions of Clause 28,the Owners shall have\n                            the right to repossess the Vessel from the Charterers at her current or\n                            next port of call, or at a port or place convenient to them\n                        without hindrance or interference by the Charterers, courts or local\n                        authorities.Pending physical repossession of the Vessel\n                            in accordance with this Clause 29, the Charterers shall hold the Vessel\n                            as gratuitous bailee only to the owners.The Owners shall\n                        arrange for an authorised representative to board the Vessel as soon as\n                        reasonably practicable following the termination of the Charter.The Vessel shall be deemed to be repossessed by the Owners from\n                            the Charterers upon the boarding of the Vessel by the Owners’\n                            representative.All arrangements and expenses relating to the\n                        settling of wages, disembarkation and repatriation of the Charterers’\n                        Master, officers and crew shall be the sole responsibility of the\n                        Charterers. [emphasis added in italics and in bold italics] 89     The decision of Rares J inThe Hako Fortressis instructive in explaining how Cll 28 and 29\n                    are intended to operate (see [61], [63] and [64]): The terms of the Barecon 89 and 2001 formsdiffered\n                            materiallyon the circumstances in which the owners could\n                        withdraw the vessel and its consequences: see M Davis:Bareboat Charters, 2nd ed, LLP London, 2005, at\n                        [28.13]–[28.14].More importantly, cl 29 of the\n                            Barecon 2001 form was a new provision that Davis observed at [29.01] was\n                            designed to clarify and strengthen the owners’ position if the\n                            charter was terminated under cl 28 and to address the practical\n                            difficulties that may occur in such circumstances.As he\n                        pointed out if the owners terminated a demise charter while the ship was on\n                        the high seas, they were in a potentially vulnerable position if they were\n                        unable, then and there, to retake possession. Clearly, cl 29 was formulated\n                        with this in mind. … I am of opinion that as a matter of principle the terms\n                            of cll 28 and 29 of the Barecon 2001 form of charterparty can operate as\n                            they were intended without requiring the owners, first, to physically\n                            retake possession of the ship following her withdrawal and the\n                            termination of the charterparty.… The charterer\n                        becomes entitled to possession of the ship under and by virtue of the\n                        contractual rights that the owners confer on it by the terms of the demise.\n                        But that right to possession and control can be affected by another of the\n                        terms of the Barecon 2001 form. Thus,cl 29 provides that\n                            upon withdrawal of the ship and termination of the charter, the nature\n                            of the charterer’s possession changes from possession for the\n                            charterer’s use and benefit to possession as a gratuitous bailee\n                            for the owners. Possession of the latter kind is\n                        substantively different in character to the plenary right to possession and\n                        use of the ship formerly enjoyed by the charterer while the charter remained\n                        on foot. When the charterer is in possession as a gratuitous bailee under cl 29, he\n                        holds the ship for the sole use and benefit of the owners. When, however, he\n                        is in possession because of the demise of the ship to him, the charterer\n                        holds her for his own use and benefit.The effect of the\n                            withdrawal and termination of the charter under cl 29 is the same as a\n                            physical redelivery to the owners because the charterer has lost his\n                            contractual authority and right to use and employ the ship as he\n                            pleases.… [emphasis added] 90     While the intention behind Barecon 2001 might\n                    have been to address the redelivery issue, it is not clear to me how making the\n                    bareboat charterer a gratuitous bailee, on paper, can dispense with the general\n                    requirement for physical redelivery. While it appears to be a neat legal\n                    solution that seems to notionally re-vest possession and control in the\n                    shipowner, it does not change the reality on the ground (or at sea, as is the\n                    case here). Third party rights and liabilities arise from theactualoperation of the vessel by the bareboat charterer by\n                    reason of theactualtransfer of complete control\n                    and possession of the vessel to the bareboat charterer. Similar concerns were\n                    expressed inASP Holdingswhere Cll 28 and 29 of\n                    Barecon 2001 came up for consideration. For the sake of comity, Finkelstein J\n                    felt constrained to rule at [13] that, consistent with Moore J inThe Socofl Stream (jurisdiction), Cll 28 and 29 entitled\n                    an owner to terminate a demise charter by merely issuing such notice. However,\n                    Finklestein J nonetheless expressed reservations about the notion that one could\n                    contract out of the requirement for physical redelivery at\n                    [13]–[15]: Comity requires me to applyThe Socofl\n                            Streamand thus hold that in the case of this charterparty,\n                        in particular because of cll 28 and 29, the charter can be terminated on\n                        written notice. Clause 28 provides for termination by notice and cl 29 says\n                        that when the charter is at an end the charterer is the “gratuitous\n                        bailee” of the vessel. If I may say so, this is a troubling conclusion. It is troubling because\n                        until the owner actually withdraws the vessel not only does the charterer\n                        retain possession it still mans and supplies her. The problem becomes acute\n                        if the notice of termination is served while the vessel is at sea. ApplyingThe Socofl Stream, she is not under demise\n                        while returning to port. If that be true it may surprise the owner to learn\n                        that the master now has ostensible authority to bind it. There is also the\n                        possibility that the owner may decide to retake possession at the next port\n                        of call or at a convenient port or place as contemplated by cl 29. The\n                        result of the application ofThe Socofl Streamis that the owner has control of the vessel during the voyage. The true\n                        position is probably different. I prefer the view that it is not until the vessel has been withdrawn that\n                        the demise comes to an end for it is only then that the charterer has lost\n                        exclusive possession of the vessel. That the charterparty describes the\n                        charterer’s possession before delivery as that of “gratuitous\n                        bailment’’ is not to the point.The real\n                            relation between the charterer and the vessel cannot be disguised by the\n                            use of an inapposite label or description.I appreciate,\n                        however, that others take a different view. [emphasis added] 91     While others might have been of a different\n                    view from Finklestein J, his concerns certainly resonated with me. I do not see\n                    how the parties’ attempt at constituting the charterer as a\n                    “gratuitous bailee” can be effective in transferring possession\n                    and thereby bring about an end to the charter. Having reviewed the authorities,\n                    the Assistant Registrar concluded at [112] of the Judgment that since a bareboat\n                    charterparty is in essence a contract between the owner and the charterer,\n                    parties are free to include such terms as to how possession of the vessel is to\n                    be terminated. With respect, I do not fully agree with this statement. The\n                    question of repossession goes right to the heart of whether the bareboat charter\n                    remains in force and, that being the case, I do not consider it to be within the\n                    parties’ private sphere to stipulate when or how this may occurshort of what the general law requires. As I have\n                    stressed in this judgment, a bareboat charter is only at an end in law if the\n                    two ingredients of control and possessionin factrevest in the owner – parties cannot, through the use of an inapposite\n                    label, declare this to be the case when that is not reflected in the reality of\n                    their situation. (3)   Had the parties contracted out of the general\n                rule? 92     For completeness, I will now examine whether,\n                    even assuming that it were possible to contract out of the general rule\n                    requiring physical delivery, this is provided for in the Lease\n                Agreement. 93     Mr Heng drew my attention to two provisions.\n                    First, he pointed out that Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement conferred a right on\n                    HKC to terminate the Lease Agreement upon issuance of a notice. This provision,\n                    he argued, closely resembled Art 11(2)(a) of the sub-demise charter inThe Socofl Stream (jurisdiction)which, as will be\n                    recalled, conferred a clear contractual right on the owner to terminate the\n                    sub-demise charter by telex notice. Second, Mr Heng pointed me to Art\n                    24(4), which stated that Sejin shall immediately halt use of the Vessel and\n                    return it to HKC in the event of termination. He argued that, cumulatively,\n                    these provisions suggested that the parties had intended to contract out of the\n                    requirement of physical redelivery, as was found to be the case inThe Socofl Stream (jurisdiction). 94     While there is some force in Mr Heng’s\n                    submission (assuming that it is possible to contract out of the general rule\n                    requiring physical redelivery), I do not see how he can overcome Art 26(3) of\n                    the Lease Agreement which provides: Article 26 (Return of\n                            Vessel) … 3. In the event [HKC] delays the return procedure stated in the previous\n                        clause, [Sejin] shall continue to pay the lease fee to [HKC] up till the\n                        point when [HKC] confirms the return of the Vessel. The validity of this\n                        contract shall remain in force and effect up till the aforementioned\n                        confirmation by [HKC]. 95     As the plaintiffs rightly pointed out, Art\n                    26(3) is akin to Cl 10(a) of the Barecon 89 form which was considered inThe TurakinaandThe\n                        Rangiorain that it specifies that hire shall continue to be\n                    payable by Sejin up to the point when HKC confirms the return of the Vessel.\n                    This clause reinforces the fact that the Lease Agreement is consistent with the\n                    general requirement for physical redelivery. 96     Mr Heng submitted that Art 26(3) was a\n                    “red herring”. He emphasised that Art 26(3) only operated where\n                    HKC has delayed the return of the Vessel and that this was not the case on our\n                    facts. I am not persuaded by this narrow reading of Art 26(3). If Mr Heng were\n                    correct, Sejin could deliberately delay the return of the Vessel without\n                    suffering financial penalty and conversely, HKC could, by deliberately delaying\n                    the return of the Vessel, continue to keep Sejin’s payment obligations\n                    alive, notwithstanding the latter’s desire to return the Vessel. This\n                    construction makes no commercial sense. In my view, the better reading of Art\n                    26(3) is that Sejin is under a continuing obligation to make rental payments up\n                    till the point that redelivery is made and HKC confirms the return of the\n                    Vessel. This is so regardless of the party responsible for the delay. This is\n                    because, in the absence of such redelivery, the parties do not consider the\n                    Lease Agreement to have come to an end. This view is reinforced by the final\n                    sentence in Art 26(3) which unambiguously and unqualifiedly states that the\n                    Lease Agreement “shall remain in force and effect” until HKC\n                    confirms the return of the Vessel. 97     Indeed, this also appears to be how the\n                    parties themselves understood Art 26(3) because the evidence before me suggests\n                    that Sejin did in fact continue to be charged charter-hire subsequent to the 4\n                    April Notice. As shown in the 4 April Notice (see [15] above), HKA demanded\n                    outstanding lease payments amounting to 289,430,562 Korean Won (approximately\n                    US$261,445.52 at the current exchange rate) at the time of the purported\n                    termination. However, by the time HKA issued its 14 June 2011 letter warning\n                    Sejin that its conduct amounted to embezzlement (see [22] above), HKA now\n                    demanded a significantly higher overdue lease amount of 190,000,000 Korean Won\n                    (approximately US$171,628.71) plus US$210,000 (which makes a total of\n                    US$381,628.71). As no explanation has been provided by HKA or Mr Sejun Kim\n                    on behalf of HKC for the difference in the amounts, and given the interlocutory\n                    nature of the applications, it is permissible to draw the inference at this\n                    stage that this increase could well be due to the fact that Sejin continued to\n                    be charged charter-hire under the Lease Agreement which remained in full effect.\n                    On this view of events, it would appear that the parties themselves interpreted\n                    Art 26(3) the same way which I have,viz, that\n                    charter-hire continued to be payable by Sejin until the Vessel was redelivered,\n                    irrespective of the fact that HKC was not responsible for the delay in\n                    redelivery. 98     In light of the above, I find that HKC’s\n                    appeal also fails on the physical redelivery issue. In my view, a bareboat\n                    charter can only be terminated with the physical redelivery of the vessel.\n                    Further, even if it were possible to contract out of that general rule (which I\n                    doubt), I find that the Lease Agreement did not have such an effect and in factreinforcedthe general requirement of physical\n                    redelivery at common law. Therefore, even if the 4 April Notice were valid,\n                    I find that the Lease Agreement had not been validly terminated as physical\n                    delivery had not been effected. Thus, Sejin continued to be the demise charterer\n                    at the time the plaintiffs commenced their respectivein\n                        remactions. The constructive redelivery issue 99     I have thus far held that HKC has failed on\n                    both the contractual termination and physical redelivery issues. For\n                    completeness, given the Assistant Registrar’s ruling on the doctrine of\n                    constructive redelivery and the parties’ extensive submissions on this\n                    issue, I will go on to explain why I think that HKC also fails on the\n                    constructive redelivery issue. 100    Like the doctrine of contracting out\n                    discussed above, the doctrine of “constructive redelivery” also\n                    appears to mitigate the perceived harshness of the general requirement of\n                    physical redelivery. This concept was first raised inThe\n                        Turakina(see [70] above). It seems to me that the point was\n                    raised somewhat in passing without the benefit of full arguments as to whether\n                    such a doctrine should be accepted in the first place. Tamberlin J had reached\n                    the conclusion that (due to the intrinsic nature of a bareboat charter and the\n                    terms of the Barecon 89 form) redelivery was essential to bring the bareboat\n                    charter to an end. It was then argued by the applicant that withdrawal of the\n                    vesselipso factoconstituted constructive\n                    redelivery. This submission was eventually rejected by the court on the facts.\n                    However, Tamberlin J appeared to implicitly endorse the doctrine of constructive\n                    redelivery when he went on to observe at 677 that the “notion of\n                    redelivery of possession of the vessel suggests some step or acknowledgment by\n                    the charterer to give effect to the redelivery”. 101    SinceThe\n                        Turakina, several cases have referred to the doctrine of\n                    constructive redelivery but, to the best of my knowledge, none until the\n                    decision by the Assistant Registrar has actually found constructive redelivery\n                    of a vessel to have been made out. Before examining the reasons which persuaded\n                    the Assistant Registrar to break new ground in holding that the Vessel was\n                    constructively redelivered, it may be useful to first examine the necessity for\n                    such a doctrine. (1)   Should the doctrine of constructive redelivery form part of\n                our law? 102    I agree with Ms Tan Hui Tsing (“Ms\n                    Tan”), counsel for KRC and Frumentarius, that the courts typically resort\n                    to constructive analogies to address a gap in the law that, if left unaddressed,\n                    would result in an inequitable or unfair outcome. I begin by echoing the\n                    observation of Lionel Smith in “Constructive Trusts and Constructive\n                    Trustees” [1999] 58 CLJ 294 that “[w]e have quite a lot of\n                    ‘constructive’ in different parts of our law”, such as the\n                    vehicle of the constructive trust, constructive knowledge, and constructive\n                    possession to name but a few. It is clear that in appending the term\n                    “constructive” to these various orthodox concepts, the law\n                    essentially projects legalfictionsinto the\n                    analytical process (see Nancy J Knauer, “Legal Fictions and Juristic\n                    Truth” [2010] 23 St Thomas L Rev 70 at p 71). As Sir Robert Megarry\n                    once stated extra-judicially, the term “constructive” seems to\n                    simply mean that “[i]t isn’t, but has to be treated as if it\n                    were” (see “Historical Development” inSpecial Lectures of The Law Society of Upper Canada 1990: Fiduciary\n                        Duties(Toronto, 1991) 1 at p 5). It is clear that the law does\n                    not conjure up and employ legal fictions for no good reason. There is always\n                    some underlying motivation behind their creation and sustained usage. For\n                    instance, it is something used to enable courts to incrementally test and probe\n                    the boundaries of a potential new rule before definitively acknowledging it as\n                    such (see,eg, Maksymilian Del Mar, “Legal\n                    Fictions and Legal Change” (2013) 9 Int JLC 442 at p 450 on\n                    “exploratory fictions”), or as a means of articulating a rational\n                    basis for and achieving coherence with existing legal precepts (see,eg, Roscoe Pound,Jurisprudence(The Lawbook Exchange Ltd Union, 1959) at p 450 on\n                    “dogmatic fictions”). 103    For present purposes, however, I consider\n                    that the term “constructive” may also be used to avoid the\n                    potential injustice that may result from the rigid application of orthodox\n                    principles (in this case, the general rule on physical redelivery). The\n                    “constructive trust” is a fitting example and I should clarify\n                    here that I am specifically referencing that class of constructive trusts which\n                    Millett LJ (as he then was) identified inParagon Finance plc\n                        v D B Thakerar & Co (a firm)[1999] 1 All ER 400 at 409 as\n                    one where the defendant had never assumed or intended to assume the office of a\n                    trustee at all but is yet made liable to account as a “constructive\n                    trustee” by reason of some fraud or wrongdoing on his part such as by\n                    rendering his dishonest assistance in the misapplication of trust assets or in\n                    knowingly receiving the same (see alsoWilliams v Central\n                        Bank of Nigeria[2014] 1 AC 1189 at [9],perLord Sumption). As Justice James Edelman has observed,\n                    extra-judicially, in “Two Fundamental Questions for the Law of\n                    Trusts” (2013) 129 LQR 66 at p 76, the constructive trust is used in\n                    this context as “a method of imposing liability to account in equityas ifthe defendantwere a\n                        trustee” [original emphasis] when, in truth, he is not.\n                    This is no doubt a form of fictional reasoning but the law resorts to it because\n                    it would be unconscionable, for example, to allow the defendant to profit\n                    unjustly from his participation in an unlawful transaction. Viewed in this way,\n                    it is clear that the use of “constructive” reasoning in this\n                    context was necessitated by the need to address a “gap” in trusts\n                    law. Another relevant example in this connection concerns a legal concept which\n                    I have already examined in some detail above,viz,\n                    the doctrine of apparent authority, which is sometimes also referred to as\n                    “constructive agency” (see,eg, Gail\n                    Pearson and Simon Fisher,Commercial Law: Commentary and\n                        Materials(LBC Information Services, 1st Ed, 1999) at\n                    p 390). The use of this concept may again be regarded as being fictional\n                    since it only arises in circumstances where there is noactualauthority but it is necessary for reasons of fairness and\n                    justice to recognise that the agent in question was nevertheless cloaked with\n                    the authority of his apparent principal to avoid prejudice to third parties who\n                    have transacted with him. In other words, the inadequacy of the orthodox notion\n                    of actual authority (the application of which would not lead to a just outcome)\n                    again provides an impetus for the law’s recognition of apparent or\n                    constructive authority despite the latter’s undeniably fictional\n                    character. 104    With that in mind, I now return to the issue\n                    at hand,viz, the notion of constructive\n                    redelivery in the context of bareboat charters. Having considered the issue, I\n                    do not see where theneedlies for its creation\n                    and acceptance into Singapore maritime law. As I have explained at\n                    [77]–[83] above, as between the owner and innocent third parties, it is\n                    not unfair that third parties should be able to proceedin\n                        remagainst the vessel so long as such liabilities arise and the\n                    suit is commencedpriorto physical redelivery of\n                    the vessel. To my mind, it does not appear that there is any injustice which\n                    needs to be remedied so I do not see the need for such a doctrine in our law.\n                    Further, I am of the view that importing such a doctrine would, instead, visit\n                    significant injustice onthird parties, who have\n                    no way of knowing if the bareboat charterer with whom he is transacting has\n                    already terminated the bareboat charter by effecting constructive delivery. My\n                    previous comments, though made in the context of the notion of contracting out\n                    of the general rule, also apply readily in this context. On our facts, this\n                    outcome is also a just one. HKC knowingly allowed Sejin to continue to represent\n                    itself as the bareboat charterer of the Vessel to third parties like the present\n                    plaintiffs notwithstanding the purported termination. 105    As a concluding remark, I note that the\n                    cases which accept the doctrine of constructive deliveryalsoheld that it is possible to contract out of the requirement\n                    for physical redelivery. With respect, it seems to me that both concepts are not\n                    compatible. If parties can contract out of the requirement of physical\n                    redelivery then there is clearly no “gap” which needs to be\n                    filled. In these circumstances, I do not see why the doctrine of constructive\n                    delivery is still needed. (2)   Had the Vessel been constructively redelivered? 106    However, should it come to pass that,\n                    contrary to my holding, there is place for such a doctrine, then, in my view,\n                    constructive redelivery is still not made out on the facts. I begin by reviewing\n                    the observations made inThe TurakinaandThe Rangioraon this issue. In determining\n                    whether a vessel could be regarded to have been constructively redelivered,\n                    Tamberlin J inThe Turakinaheld at 677 that\n                    the inquiry should be focussed on “some step or acknowledgmentby the chartererto give effect to the\n                    redelivery” [emphasis added]. This is understandable because physical\n                    redelivery requires a clear act by the charterer; thus, constructive redelivery,\n                    as an equitable substitute, must likewise emanate from the conduct of the\n                    charterer. Tamberlin J did not provide examples of such “steps”\n                    but inThe Rangiora, Giles J observed at 55 that\n                    it would suffice if the owner’s agent attended onboard the vessel to\n                    announce that it had retaken possession of the vessel or if the owner issued\n                    proceedings seeking repossession. However, I note that these examples concern\n                    acts by theownerand not thechartererand therefore may not be particularly useful to\n                    illustrate conduct sufficient to constitute constructive redelivery. In any\n                    event, as highlighted by Mercuria’s counsel, Mr Philip Tay (“Mr\n                    Tay”), such examples are tantamount to a physical retaking of the vessel\n                    by the owners. 107    In finding that the Vessel was\n                    constructively redelivered, the Assistant Registrar relied on the following\n                    conduct of Sejin and found that any one of them was sufficient: (a)     The implicit acknowledgment of the\n                        termination by Mr Park, the CEO of Sejin, at a meeting in mid-April 2011 in\n                        which he requested that HKC withdraw the 4 April Notice. (b)     Sejin’s letter of 4 July 2011\n                        to HKA stating that it “wanted to return the ship safely through the\n                        ship’s normal sailing route but [that] the situation does not allow us\n                        to do that so far”. (c)     Finally, Sejin’s letter of 15 July 2011 stating\n                        that it “will do our best to return the ship to Korea as soon as\n                        possible”. It did not matter to HKC for the purposes of setting aside\n                            thein remwrits which of the three dates\n                            terminated the bareboat charter because the earliest of thein remwrits was issued by Winplus on 28 July\n                            2011 while the latest of the three dates occurred on 15 July 2011,priorto the issuance of any of thein remwrits. 108    After examining the evidence before me, I am\n                    not able to agree with the Assistant Registrar that constructive redelivery had\n                    been effected. As a starting point, I first observe that certainty is critical\n                    in the shipping trade since it invariably involves multiple third party\n                    interests. Therefore any step or conduct as regards redelivery by the bareboat\n                    charterer must be clear and unequivocal. The examples cited by counsel in their\n                    further submissions bear this out. For pledges, constructive delivery or\n                    possession can arise from the delivery of the keys to the property. A bank can\n                    be regarded as being in constructive possession of goods upon the deposit of the\n                    bill of lading which, in shipping parlance, is “the key to the\n                    warehouse”. Likewise, a seller in possession can be considered to have\n                    constructively delivered the chattel if he assents to hold the thing sold on\n                    account for the buyer. In each of these examples, the conduct of the relevant\n                    party is both clear and unequivocal. 109    As a preliminary point, I pause to note that\n                    the Assistant Registrar stated at [129] of the Judgment that inThe Rangiora, “a letter from the liquidators\n                    acknowledging receipt of the notice of termination and accepting the termination\n                    was sufficient to constitute constructive redelivery of the ship”. This\n                    is incorrect. First, it was opposing counsel and not the court who was prepared\n                    to accept in principle that the letter of acknowledgment could constitute\n                    constructive redelivery (seeThe Rangioraat 50).\n                    In any event, the concession was moot because the letter was not despatched\n                    prior to the commencement of the action. Second, the court in fact found that\n                    there was no redelivery – actual, symbolic or constructive (seeThe Rangioraat 55). 110    This brings me to the crux of the issue: was\n                    the conduct of Sejin clear and unequivocal? In the present case, there was no\n                    overt act by Sejin capable of representing redelivery. Instead HKC’s\n                    reliance was on correspondence and matters alleged to have been said at a\n                    meeting. It is therefore imperative to examine the context and factual matrix\n                    surrounding the three events found to have been sufficient by the Assistant\n                    Registrar. 111    First, as regards the meeting in mid-April\n                    2011, she found that in requesting for the revocation of the 4 April Notice,\n                    Sejin had implicitly acknowledged the termination of the Lease Agreement. While\n                    that may be correct, it is not sufficient. It is important always to bear in\n                    mind that, to bring an end to a bareboat charter,bothcontrol and possession must be withdrawn. As rightly\n                    observed by Giles J inThe Rangioraat 55,\n                    “[n]otice of termination achieves resumption of, or cancellation ofcontrolbut it does not effectredelivery” [emphasis added]. An acknowledgement\n                    of termination deals with the requirement of control but not with possession. On\n                    the facts, there was no clear act which represented the reversion of possession.\n                    Instead, the conduct of Sejin following the mid-April meeting was entirely\n                    inconsistent with any intention to redeliver. On 23 May 2011, Sejin, in response\n                    to HKA’s 9 May letter, informed HKA that it had entered into a\n                    charterparty dated 13 May 2011 with Frumentarius. On 31 May 2011, Sejin provided\n                    HKA with a written update that the Vessel had entered Belawan and was in the\n                    process of loading palm oil cargo and that the Vessel would proceed next to\n                    Dumai for additional loading and then onwards to the Mediterranean Sea and the\n                    Black Sea for discharge. Sejin’s sailing instructions clearly showed that\n                    it had no intention to redeliver the Vessel in response to the 4 April\n                    Notice. 112    Second, neither the letter of 4 July 2011\n                    nor the letter of 15 July 2011 was clear and unequivocal enough to constitute\n                    constructive redelivery. On 4 July 2011, Sejin wrote that it “wanted\n                    to return the return the ship safely through the ship’s normal sailing\n                    route, but the situation does not allow us to do that”. On 15 July 2011,\n                    Sejin wrote, “we will do our best to return the ship to Korea as soon as\n                    possible”. These letters were couched in tentative and equivocal\n                    language: “wantedto return….butthe situation does not allow us to”\n                    and “we willdo our bestto return the\n                    ship” [emphasis added]. The reason for this is clear from the context. At\n                    the time the letters were authored, the Vessel – as HKC/HKA were well\n                    aware – was already laden with cargoes which had yet to be delivered at\n                    their discharge ports. Viewed holistically, what Sejin was in fact saying was\n                    that it intended to continue using the Vessel to deliver the cargoes to their\n                    discharge portsbeforecontemplating the return of\n                    the Vessel – it is clear that Sejin did not, through either of these\n                    letters, evince a clear intention to redeliver the Vessel. 113    In the circumstances, I am unable to accept\n                    that any of the three events constituted a clear and unequivocal step or\n                    acknowledgment by Sejin to redeliver the Vessel to HKC in response to the 4\n                    April Notice. Thus, HKC also fails on the issue of constructive\n                    redelivery.",
        "HKC’s appeals": "114    This portion of the judgment deals with\n                    HKC’s appeals against the Assistant Registrar’s decision to dismiss\n                    its striking out applications in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011. I first\n                    pause to observe that this alternative claim is only relevant if thein remwrits against Sejin as bareboat charterers are,\n                    contrary to my primary finding, set aside. In these actions, KRC and Mercuria\n                    claim, in the alternative, against HKC directly. The thrust of their argument is\n                    that, in permitting cargo to be loaded onboard the Vessel and allowing the\n                    master to issue bills of lading in respect thereof (notwithstanding the\n                    termination of the Lease Agreement), HKC must be treated as having clothed the\n                    master with theostensible authorityto enter into\n                    contracts of carriage on its behalf as owner of the Vessel. If they are correct\n                    that HKC is directly liable for their losses, there is no doubt that the Vessel\n                    may be arrested as HKC is the owner of the Vessel. Ms Tan and Mr Tay, counsel\n                    for KRC and Mercuria respectively, relied principally on the cases arising from\n                    the arrest of theSocofl Streamto establish this\n                    point. 115    HKC applied to strike out these alternative\n                    claims against it on the basis that they were “factually\n                    unsustainable”. The crux of Mr Heng’s case was that HKC had never,\n                    by words or conduct, represented or permitted it to be represented that the\n                    master had authority to act on its behalf in issuing the bills of lading or in\n                    carrying the cargo owned by KRC and Mercuria. Mr Heng submitted that the\n                    contrary was true instead: he argued that the facts showed that HKC had\n                    consistently treated the Lease Agreement as having been terminated with the\n                    issuance of the 4 April Notice, as evinced by HKC’s repeated demands for\n                    the return of the Vessel. 116    I do not agree with Mr Heng’s\n                    submissions. To begin with, I do not think that it is entirely accurate to state\n                    that HKC had consistently treated the Lease Agreement as having been terminated\n                    from the 4 April Notice onwards. That position may have been reflected in its\n                    written correspondence with Sejin, but its conduct ofknowinglypermitting the Vessel to be traded even after the 4\n                    April Notice suggests otherwise. Furthermore, I do not see how HKC’s\n                    conduct of repeatedly demanding the redelivery of the Vessel takes\n                    Mr Heng’s case very far. Those communications were wholly private in\n                    nature and were never made known to third party shippers dealing with the Vessel\n                    (such as KRC and Mercuria) who would ordinarily assume that they were\n                    transacting with the actual or disponent owner of the Vessel. Publicly, the\n                    picture was very different. It appeared that HKCknowinglypermitted the Vessel to be traded even after the 4\n                    April Notice. If the Lease Agreement had been terminated, as HKC argued, it\n                    should and could have taken steps to ensure that third parties were aware of\n                    this in order to avoid attracting potential liability to itself through the\n                    continued trading of the Vessel. HKC was slow, however, to take any such steps\n                    prior to the loading of KRC and Mercuria’s cargo at Belawan and Dumai\n                    respectively. The decisions arising from the arrest of theSocofl Streamare highly instructive in this regard and I turn\n                    now to consider them. The Socofl Stream cases 117    The factual matrix leading to the arrest of\n                    theSocofl Streamhas already been outlined at\n                    [84] above. It will be recalled that Sovcomflot purportedly terminated the\n                    bareboat charter on 15 December 1998. On 25 December 1998, Sovcomflot\n                    demanded that the vessel be redelivered but did not nominate a port for this to\n                    be done. On 30 December 1998, Kamchatka replied stating that it disputed the\n                    debt claimed by Sovcomflot and that, until the parties’ rights and\n                    obligations had been finally determined, “we … do not propose to\n                    return possession of the … vessel to you or to whoever may be entitled\n                    thereto” (seeThe Socofl Stream\n                        (jurisdiction)at [7]). As Moore J noted at [8], it was at least\n                    implicit in this response that Kamchatka intended to continue to use the vessel\n                    for trading as it had done up to that point as the sub-demise charterer, pending\n                    resolution of Sovcomflot’s disputed debt. Following this, Kamchatka\n                    continued to deploy the vessel for the carriage of goods. It loaded goods\n                    belonging to CMC in Singapore and Port Klang in early January 1999 before\n                    it was finally arrested on 25 January 1999 by Sovcomflot in Brisbane. CMC\n                    commencedin remproceedings against the vessel in\n                    February 1999 and Sovcomflot’s application to strike it out for want of\n                    jurisdiction was the subject of the proceedings inThe Socofl\n                        Stream (jurisdiction). 118    I have already stated how, inThe Socofl Stream (jurisdiction), Moore J found that the\n                    sub-demise charter had been validly terminated by Sovcomflot through its\n                    issuance of the termination notice. CMC’s invocation of the court’s\n                    admiralty jurisdiction on the basis thatKamchatkawas the relevant person was therefore invalid. However, that was not the end of\n                    the matter. As with KRC and Mercuria here, CMC also argued, in the alternative,\n                    thatSovcomflothad clothed the master with\n                    ostensible authority to bind it in respect of the bills of lading issued by\n                    permitting the vessel to be traded notwithstanding the termination of the\n                    sub-demise charter. Moore J expressed the view at [31] that this submission was\n                    “not untenable” and he had the opportunity to revisit it more\n                    fully when the merits of CMC’s claim came before him inCMC (Australia) Pty Ltd v ‘Socofl Stream’[2000] FCA\n                    1681 (“The Socofl Stream (merits; 1st\n                        instance)”). 119    InThe Socofl Stream\n                        (merits; 1st instance), Moore J held that Sovcomflot was liable\n                    to CMC on the basis that it had clothed the master with ostensible authority. In\n                    arriving at this view, Moore J placed importance on the fact that Sovcomflot was\n                    contractually obliged to nominate a port for redelivery but had failed to do so.\n                    He reasoned as follows at [87]: Sovcomflot's demand for redelivery in its telex of 25 December 1998, in\n                        which it demanded that Kamchatka \"forthwith re-deliver the above vessel to\n                        the disponent owner as soon as possible at a safe port to be nominated by\n                        us, failing which re-delivery the disponent owner (or their agent) may\n                        itself enter upon and repossess the vessel,\" was a barren one in the absence\n                        of the nomination of a port for redelivery. Moreover,the\n                            failure of Sovcomflot to nominate a port might reasonably have been\n                            taken by Kamchatka to be an indication that Sovcomflot was not prepared\n                            to assert or enforce its legal rights, at least fully.\n                        Sovcomflot neglected to nominate a port for redelivery even when Kamchatka\n                        made it plain (again) in its telex of 30 December 1998 that it proposed to\n                        continue to trade.Sovcomflot thus afforded Kamchatka the\n                            opportunity to continue to trade using the Vessel under the command of\n                            the Master. Sovcomflot effectively clothed the Master with authority to\n                            issue bills of lading on behalf of the \"owner\", that is, the person who\n                            was, at that time, in fact and in law the demise charterer. Sovcomflot\n                            would have had no reasonable basis, in my opinion, for assuming that\n                            what had occurred in late December 1998 between it and Kamchatka would\n                            be known to shippers who might use the Vessel before Sovcomflot regained\n                            physical possession of it. It should have known that by allowing\n                            Kamchatka to trade in the way just discussed, shipowners would enter\n                            contracts of carriage on the assumption that the Master could bind the\n                            owner.[emphasis added] 120    Sovcomflot’s appeal against Moore\n                    J’s decision was heard by Ryan, Tamberlin, and Conti JJ who delivered a\n                    joint judgment inThe Ship “Socofl Stream” v\n                        CMC (Australia) Pty Ltd[2001] FCA 961 (“The Socofl Stream (merits; appeal)”). Counsel for\n                    Sovcomflot attacked Moore J’s reasoning on the issue of ostensible\n                    authority by arguing that it rested on the implied finding that, had Sovcomflot\n                    demanded the redelivery of the vessel to a port nominated by it, Kamchatka would\n                    necessarily have complied. He argued that, on the facts, Kamchatka would have\n                    ignored such a demand. The appellate judges stated at [20] that it was\n                    “unnecessary to resolve this question”. Instead, they held that,\n                    for the purpose of determining whether the master had been clothed with\n                    ostensible authority, it was necessary to focus on the events which transpired\n                    between Sovcomflot’s issuance of the termination notice and the time\n                    CMC’s cargo was loaded and the bills of lading issued. On this analysis,\n                    they had no doubt that Sovcomflot – by its conduct of allowing cargo to be\n                    loaded onto the vessel rather than taking steps to make clear that it was no\n                    longer on demise charter – had represented to third parties that the\n                    master had ostensible authority to bind it which was relied on by CMC (see\n                    [37]): In the present case, it was said that there was no evidence of reliance by\n                        CMC on any conduct. We disagree.In our view, the\n                            relevant conduct by Sovcomflot was its allowing the \"Socofl Stream\" to\n                            take on cargo after 15 December 1998 for which the master or his agent\n                            issued bills of lading. The evidence does not exclude the natural\n                            inference thatSovcomflot, at any time\n                            after 15 December 1998, could have made clear by arresting the ship (as\n                            it ultimately did) or otherwise, that the ship no longer had the\n                            disponent owner's authority to take on cargo and issue bills of\n                            lading. CMC relied on the conduct of\n                            Sovcomflot which we have just identified by having its agents at\n                            Singapore and Port Klang put consignments of steel on board the vessel\n                            and obtain bills of lading in respect of those consignments in the usual\n                            way.[emphasis added in italics and in bold italics] 121    While the courts at first instance and on\n                    appeal focused on different aspects of Sovcomflot’s conduct, it seems\n                    clear to me that the general thrust of their reasoning was similar. The point\n                    was that, following Sovcomflot’s termination of the demise charter, it was\n                    informed of the possibility that Kamchatka might continue trading the vessel\n                    and, despite knowing that, Sovcomflot did not do anything to prevent Kamchatka\n                    from perpetuating this state of affairs. In the circumstances, Sovcomflot could\n                    not argue that the master had no authority to bind it when issuing bills of\n                    lading to third party shippers who loaded cargo onto the vessel. After all, as\n                    the appellate court observed inThe Socofl Stream (merits;\n                        appeal)at [22], such third parties generally operate on the\n                    assumption that they are dealing with either the actual or disponent owner of\n                    the vessel and would not know that there was a demise charter that had been\n                    terminated: …The assumption to be imputed to CMC is that, when the\n                            ship, in the person of the Master, received cargo on board and issued\n                            bills of lading, that was done on behalf of the actual or disponent\n                            owner of the ship for the time being.On that analysis,\n                        although there may have been a \"complete change\" of ownership by reason of\n                        Sovcomflot's termination of the demise charter to Kamchatka,that did not change any assumption which might reasonably have\n                            been made by third parties dealing with the ship. …\n                        [emphasis added] Whether the master had ostensible authority to bind HKC 122    The parallels between theSocofl Streamcases and the present case are clear. In both\n                    cases, the vessels in question were under demise charters which were purportedly\n                    terminated by the issuance of a notice. Demands were also similarly made for the\n                    redelivery of the vessel but these were not complied with. The demise charterers\n                    in both cases also communicated their intentions to continue trading the vessel\n                    which they went on to do by loading cargo belonging to the respective\n                    plaintiffs. 123    In fact, the argument for ostensible\n                    authority appears to be even stronger in this case. In theSocofl Streamcases, Sovcomflot was not provided with details of\n                    the shippers, whereas, here, Sejin provided full details of the shippers to HKC.\n                    HKC was therefore in a better position than Sovcomflot was to prevent the\n                    loading of cargoes and could have done so by taking the simple step of\n                    contacting the shippers but it failed to do so despite being informed of the\n                    details of prospective fixtures and an update on the movement of the Vessel on\n                    23 and 31 May 2011 respectively (see [19]–[20] above). By the time HKA\n                    issued its formal written reply some two weeks later on 14 June 2011, the Vessel\n                    had already completed loading cargoes belonging to KRC and Mercuria respectively\n                    and issued separate bills of lading in respect of each. 124    I should mention that Mr Sejun Kim has\n                    stated in his affidavit that HKC was “very upset” to learn from\n                    Sejin’s 23 May 2011 letter that Sejin refused to return the Vessel. He\n                    stated that HKC then “complained” about the prospective fixtures,\n                    “objected” to the continued use of the Vessel, and\n                    “demanded” its immediate return. Notably, however, there was no\n                    documentary proof which showed that HKC did any of these things. This is\n                    particularly striking given that, during the critical period after the 4 April\n                    Notice had been issued, the parties frequently communicated their respective\n                    positions through written correspondence. Mr Sejun Kim’s bare assertions\n                    in this respect were unsupported with reference to the objective evidence before\n                    me. 125    However, even if I accept Mr Sejun\n                    Kim’s assertions to be true, I fail to see how this assists HKC’s\n                    case. The purported termination of the Lease Agreement and the subsequent\n                    demands for redelivery were known only to the immediate contracting parties.\n                    What is important was that the Vessel’s change in status had not been\n                    brought to the attention of the outside world by some manifest act of HKC. As I\n                    had pointed out earlier in this judgment, third parties in the position of KRC\n                    and Mercuria do not have the benefit of a public registry to check whether a\n                    vessel is on bareboat charter. They therefore could not have been expected to\n                    know that the Lease Agreement had at one time been in force, let alone that it\n                    had been terminated. On the other hand, HKC had full knowledge of the state of\n                    play: it knew of the purported termination of the Lease Agreement and that,\n                    despite the purported termination, Sejin still intended to load cargo onto the\n                    Vessel. By failing to take any overt steps to prevent that, HKC must be taken to\n                    have represented to third parties that the master had the authority to bind\n                    it. 126    In this connection, it must be emphasised\n                    that Sejin’s continued trading of the Vessel could hardly be described as\n                    surreptitious. Sejin was open in providing explicit information regarding the\n                    Vessel’s trading route under the prospective fixtures and also the names\n                    and addresses of the charterers whom it had contracted with, such as\n                    Frumentarius. Mr Tay rightly pointed out in his submissions that HKC could\n                    easily have contacted these charterers to inform them that Sejin no longer had\n                    any right to continue with the Vessel’s employment and that cargo should\n                    not be loaded on board. In fact, a more effective means at HKC’s disposal\n                    to prevent the Vessel from being traded was simply to have obtained a warrant\n                    for her arrest. This had in fact been contractually provided for in Art 26(5) of\n                    the Lease Agreement which states that HKC may unilaterally retrieve the Vessel\n                    at Sejin’s expense if Sejin delays the return of the Vessel. However, this\n                    right was never exercised. Mr Sejun Kim’s explanation for HKC’s\n                    inaction in this regard was that he “did not know where the Vessel was or\n                    how to retrieve the Vessel”. That, however, did not strike me as a\n                    convincing reason, especially when Sejin had provided an update on the\n                    Vessel’s location at Belawan and its subsequent trading route. In this\n                    regard, I note that Sovcomflot’s representative made similar arguments inThe Socofl Stream (merits; 1st instance), but,\n                    likewise, this argument did not gain much traction before Moore J (see\n                    [15]–[17]): Mr Izmailov said during cross-examination that when the charterparty was\n                        terminated no port for re-delivery was nominated because Sovcomflot did not\n                        know where the Vessel was. He appeared to accept that, in theory, he could\n                        have contacted Kamchatka to ascertain the location of the Vessel but said\n                        that to do so would have been useless. He also accepted that a way of\n                        finding out the whereabouts of the Vessel would have been to use the Lloyd's\n                        Register and other services which provided updates on the location of\n                        vessels. He asserted that after the notice of termination had been given,\n                        any trading by Kamchatka would be \"illegal\". He appeared to accept, however,\n                        that the Vessel might continue to trade after the notice had been given. He\n                        said that his expectation was, at the time the notice was given, that\n                        Kamchatka would agree to the notice and provide, I infer, a trading schedule\n                        of the Vessel identifying where it was located. … Mr Neill, CMC's solicitor, gave evidence about steps Sovcomflot could have\n                        taken to locate the Vessel. It was admitted over objection though the\n                        general thrust of the evidence was not challenged. Some of it was\n                        self-evident. The first means of locating the Vessel was by asking\n                        Kamchatka. The second was using one of two commercial tracking services,\n                        namely MRC or one maintained by Lloyd's. The third was through Sovcomflot's\n                        London solicitors though on the basis they would also use these commercial\n                        tracking services. The last was for Sovcomflot to inquire of their\n                        shipbroker. … I am satisfied that it would have been open to\n                            Sovcomflot to have ascertained the location of the Vessel before issuing\n                            the notice terminating the demise charterparty.It could have\n                        done so with a view to nominating a port for redelivery.I accept that the Vessel would not have been located immediately.\n                            However, by not taking steps to locate the Vessel as a step towards\n                            nominating a port for redelivery, Sovcomflot created a circumstance in\n                            which Kamchatka could continue to trade using the Vessel though no\n                            longer as a demise charterer.… [emphasis added] 127    InThe Socofl Stream\n                        (merits; appeal), the appellate court referred to Moore J’s\n                    finding above and stated as follows at [56]: …[H]is Honour's finding … supports the conclusion\n                            that it was open to Sovcomflot to locate the vessel and circumscribe, in\n                            an appropriately public way, the master's authority to bind\n                            it.Such a conclusion is not tantamount to saying, as Counsel\n                        for Sovcomflot argued, that \"it may have been possible, if Sovcomflot had\n                        ordered its affairs entirely in order to protect the interests of persons\n                        such as [CMC], there were things which Sovcomflot could have done which may\n                        have prevented any loss to [CMC]\" … [original emphasis omitted;\n                        emphasis added in italics] 128    Here, HKC did not need any assistance in\n                    locating the Vessel. HKC was kept informed of the Vessel’s sailing route\n                    at all material times. In light of the above, I fail to see how KRC and\n                    Mercuria’s alternative claims against HKC were “factually\n                    unsustainable” as Mr Heng argued. The manner in which events unfolded\n                    between the issuance of the 4 April Notice and the completion of loading at\n                    Belawan and Dumai supports the view that the master was clothed with ostensible\n                    authority to bind HKC. In the result, I find that KRC and Mercuria’s\n                    alternative claims should not be struck out. 129    Let me be clear. A finding of ostensible\n                    authority is necessarilyfact-specific(see also\n                    [81] above). I have arrived at this finding because of HKC’s conduct inknowinglyallowing Sejin to continue loading\n                    cargoes notwithstanding the purported termination and its abject failure to take\n                    any steps to regain possession of the Vessel. It is not the case that every\n                    shipowner, after having terminated a bareboat charter, will inevitably\n                    thereafter be liable for the trading activities of the vessel on basis of the\n                    master’s ostensible authority. This would lead to the ironic situation\n                    where shipowners, in seeking to defeatin remclaims against the bareboat charterer by terminating the bareboat charter at the\n                    earliest opportunity, nevertheless end up with the same liability in a different\n                    form,ie, in the form of a direct claim by virtue\n                    of the doctrine of ostensible authority. This anomalous outcome was also noted\n                    by Finkelstein J inASP Holdingsin the passage\n                    which I have quoted above at [90].",
        "Conclusion": "130    In the premises, I allow the\n                    plaintiffs’ appeals in RA 426/2013, RA 1/2014, RA 2/2014, and RA\n                    6/2014 against the Assistant Registrar’s decision to set aside the fourin remwrits. I hold that Sejin was, on a\n                    balance of probabilities, still the bareboat charterer of the Vessel at the time\n                    the plaintiffs’ respective actions were commenced. I have given five\n                    alternative reasons for reaching this conclusion, although the last two are\n                    essentiallyobiter, given that the determination\n                    of the contractual termination issue against HKC is sufficient for me to allow\n                    the plaintiffs’ appeals: (a)     First, the 4 April Notice was\n                        invalidly issued by HKA because the right of termination had not been\n                        transferred to HKA under the ATA and/or the NCT. (b)     Second, the Lease Agreement had not\n                        been validly terminated by HKA becauseHKCdid\n                        not form the opinion that Sejin was facing difficulties in continuing its\n                        normal business activities required for the right to termination under Art\n                        24(2) and the 4 April Notice had, in any event, failed to identify the\n                        “cause” which led it to form such an\n                    opinion. (c)     Third,\n                        the non-payment of hiresimpliciterwas not a\n                        proper ground for the immediate termination of the Lease Agreement under Art\n                        24(2). (d)     Fourth,\n                        physical redelivery is required at common law to terminate a bareboat\n                        charter and even if this general rule can be contracted out of (a\n                        possibility which I have expressed my doubts on), that does not appear to be\n                        what the parties had done, especially given the presence of Art 26(3) in the\n                        Lease Agreement. (e)     Fifth, even if the doctrine of constructive redelivery were accepted\n                        as a part of our law (a position which I have also expressed reservations\n                        on), the Vessel had not been constructively redelivered to HKC because there\n                        was no clear and unequivocal act by Sejin capable of representing redelivery\n                        on the facts of this case. 131    I also dismiss HKC’s appeals in RA\n                    8/2014 and RA 7/2014 to strike out KRC and Mercuria’s alternative claims\n                    in ADM 198/2011 and ADM 201/2011 respectively. I find that KRC and\n                    Mercuria’s claims are not factually unsustainable and thus should not be\n                    struck out. 132    In the court below, the Assistant Registrar\n                    awarded HKC 90% of the costs for the setting aside applications and ordered\n                    costs against HKC in favour of KRC and Mercuria in respect of the unsuccessful\n                    striking out applications. The costs orders were to be taxed if not\n                    agreed. 133    Before me, the plaintiffs have succeeded in\n                    their respective appeals while HKC’s appeals have been dismissed. There is\n                    no reason for me to depart from the usual order for costs to follow the event. I\n                    invited the parties to submit on costs. Their submissions on costs in the event\n                    that the plaintiffs’ appeals are allowed and HKC’s appeals are\n                    dismissed ranged from $12,000 to $19,500 plus reasonable disbursements for the\n                    hearing below (HKC’s new counsel who did not have conduct of the case\n                    below, did not submit on costs for the hearing below) and $5,000 to $7,000 for\n                    the plaintiffs’ appeals and $3,000 for HKC’s appeals. While HKC was\n                    represented by the same counsel for all the proceedings, the plaintiffs were\n                    separately represented except in the case of Frumentarius and KRC. They were\n                    represented by the same counsel, Ms Tan, who rightly submitted that there should\n                    only be one set of costs for Frumentarius and KRC. 134    Although the facts are relatively\n                    undisputed, the appeals involved novel and interesting points of law. The\n                    hearing spanned a total of 14 calendar days though much time was spent on the\n                    unnecessary dispute over Korean law. However, it was HKC who put Korean law in\n                    issue. Though it might not have been necessary for the plaintiffs to respond to\n                    HKC’s reliance on Korean law, as was the experience of Mercuria, it was\n                    not unreasonable for them to have done so. Therefore, I would not discount the\n                    costs incurred in respect of the Korean law issue. Taking into account all the\n                    circumstances, I order HKC to pay the following costs: (a)     To Winplus – costs fixed at\n                        $15,000 for the hearing below and $5,000 for the appeal in RA 426/2013, both\n                        inclusive of disbursements. (b)     To Frumentarius and KRC – one set of costs fixed\n                        at $15,000 for the hearing below, $5,000 for the appeals in RA 1/2014 and RA\n                        2/2014, and $3,000 for RA 8/2014, all inclusive of\n                    disbursements. (c)     To\n                        Mercuria – costs fixed at $15,000 for the hearing below, $5,000 for\n                        the appeal in RA 6/2014, and $3,000 for RA 7/2014, all inclusive of\n                        disbursements.",
        "Acodaon the use of expert evidence in\n                the proof of foreign law": "135    Thiscodais\n                    necessitated by my observation that even though HKC’s applications first\n                    came up for hearing before the Assistant Registrar on 11 October 2012, the\n                    next day of hearing only commenced some nine months later on 2 July 2013. In my\n                    view, this lengthy delay between hearings is regrettable. After having reviewed\n                    the record of the proceedings below, it is clear that this delay was a result of\n                    a dispute between the parties over the opinion expressed by one of the Korean\n                    law experts. However, I am of the view thatallthe opinions filed in these proceedings were ultimately indistinguishable from\n                    submissions which offered the court no substantive assistance in terms ofproof of foreign law. All that trouble could\n                    have been avoided if an expert’s role in providing an opinion on foreign\n                    law was properly understood at the outset. That role, as I will explain, is also\n                    a targeted one where, as in the present case, the expert is asked to provide an\n                    opinion to aid the local court in theconstruction of private\n                        documentssuch as the Lease Agreement, NCT, and\n                ATA. 136    In order to illustrate why the proceedings\n                    below were so protracted, it is necessary for me to first set out the various\n                    expert opinions in some detail.",
        "The prominent use of expert opinions below": "The expert evidence on Korean law 137    There were three Korean law experts who had\n                    each filed multiple opinions in the proceedings below: (a)     Prof Kim was the expert appointed\n                        by HKC. He filed a total of three affidavits exhibiting his opinions prior\n                        to the commencement of the hearings below. (b)     Mr Soo Keun Kyung (“Mr Kyung”)\n                        was the expert appointed by Winplus. He filed two affidavits exhibiting his\n                        opinions prior to the commencement of the hearings below and a third\n                        affidavit thereafter to make a minor correction to his first\n                    opinion. (c)     Mr Jong\n                        Hyeon Choi (“Mr Choi”) was the expert jointly appointed by\n                        Frumentarius and KRC. He filed two affidavits exhibiting his opinions prior\n                        to the commencement of the hearings below. As I will explain, the opinion\n                        provided in his second affidavit was the source of the parties’\n                        dispute below and that led to him filing three further affidavits to clarify\n                        his position. (d)     To the credit of Mercuria, it consistently maintained the view that Korean\n                        law was irrelevant to the determination of the issues before the court and\n                        therefore elected not to file any affidavit on Korean law. Unfortunately,\n                        Mercuria was alone in this view. 138    Each of the three experts filed at least two\n                    rounds of opinions prior to the commencement of the hearings below. I note that\n                    the views expressed in these opinions, in particular those of Prof Kim and Mr\n                    Kyung, covered extensive ground but, unfortunately, none was particularly\n                    relevant. Once one cuts through the chaff, it becomes apparent that, on the\n                    crucial question which the experts sought to provide an opinion on –viz, whether the 4 April Notice had terminated the\n                    Lease Agreement under Korean law – there essentially emerged two\n                    fundamental points of disagreement which were alluded to earlier in this\n                    judgment at [13] and [16]. In my view, these two points are best presented by\n                    tracking how they arose in the different rounds of exchanges between the\n                    experts. 139    In the first round of opinions, the central\n                    point of departure between the experts was whether the 4 April Notice had been\n                    issued in compliance with Art 24(2) of the Lease Agreement so as to constitute a\n                    valid termination. In Prof Kim’s opinion, Art 24(2) enabled HKC to\n                    exercise a right ofimmediatetermination; hence\n                    the reasons justifying such termination had to be “very serious\n                    ones”. He then went on to emphasise that Sejin’s failure to make\n                    rental payments for the past six months had resulted in arrears of a\n                    “very substantial amount”. When this was taken together with the\n                    sharp drop in the price of the Vessel and the poor market conditions (reasons\n                    which were not stated in the 4 April Notice), Prof Kim concluded that there was\n                    “enough for HKC to form its view” under Art 24(2) and to issue a\n                    termination notice as it did. Mr Choi disagreed. In his view, Art 24(2) clearly\n                    required a termination notice to specify the “cause” for\n                    termination but this was absent from the 4 April Notice whose validity was\n                    therefore “disputable”. This point was similarly raised by Mr\n                    Kyung. 140    I pause here to make an important\n                    observation. The first set of legal opinions was disappointingly short on legal\n                    analysis. None of the experts endeavoured to provide any explanation whatsoever\n                    as to how their views were derived from particular Korean law principles or\n                    rules of interpretation and no such sources of foreign law had been cited in\n                    support of the conclusions reached. One is therefore left with the distinct\n                    impression that the experts’ conclusions were grounded in little more than\n                    their personal opinion rather than the result of a considered application of\n                    Korean law. Their opinions were entirely unhelpful and revealed a fundamental\n                    misapprehension of the role of expert evidence in the proof of foreign law. It\n                    therefore came as no surprise that the experts’ further round of opinions\n                    was afflicted with the same problems. 141    The second round of expert opinions was\n                    dominated by the differing views of Prof Kim and Mr Kyung on the rather separate\n                    question of whetherHKAcould terminate the Lease\n                    Agreement by issuing the 4 April Notice (see [16] above). I should explain that\n                    this issue came to be at the forefront of their considerations because, in the\n                    first round of opinions, Mr Kyung noted that Prof Kim had wrongly assumed the 4\n                    April Notice to have been issued byHKC(rather\n                    thanHKA, as was the case). Mr Kyung pointed out\n                    that this was a “fundamental error” of fact and that Prof\n                    Kim’s opinion on the effectiveness of the 4 April Notice should be\n                    rejected as a result. 142    Prof Kim sought to overcome Mr Kyung’s\n                    objection in his second opinion by stating that, even if HKA had sent the 4\n                    April Notice, this did not cause it to be invalid. He pointed to the NCT which\n                    appeared to transfer, in addition to the credits under the Lease Agreement,\n                    certain other “right[s]” or “status” to HKA (see\n                    [13] above). In Prof Kim’s interpretation, these terms encompassed theright to terminatethe Lease Agreement and so\n                    HKA could properly issue the 4 April Notice. Alternatively, Prof Kim stated\n                    that, even if HKC had retained the right to terminate, “HKA can be said\n                    to have terminated the Lease Agreement for and on behalf of HKC” as its\n                    authorised agent. It bears mention that none of these views were supported by\n                    any references to Korean law principles. In short, it was simply a matter of\n                    interpretation of the contractual documents before the court. In my view, such\n                    an argument could well have been presented by counsel before me in their own\n                    right. There was no enhancement in the value of the argument by having it\n                    articulated through the Korean law experts. 143    As for Mr Kyung, he maintained in his second\n                    opinion that the issuance of the 4 April Notice by HKA (as opposed to HKC) was a\n                    fundamental defect. In particular, he disagreed with Prof Kim on the effect of\n                    the NCT. According to Mr Kyung, the NCT was “merely a notice” and\n                    so could not exceed the ATA in terms of what was transferred. Since the ATA only\n                    purported to transfer thecreditsunder the Lease\n                    Agreement, it followed that HKA could not acquire the altogether separate right\n                    to terminate the same despite what the NCT purported to transfer. It is again\n                    noteworthy, however, that Mr Kyung’s opinion here was similarly bereft of\n                    any references to Korean law principles although it is correct as a legal\n                    submission (see [44] above). 144    As for Mr Choi, his second opinion was\n                    silent on whether the 4 April Notice could be issued by HKA. This\n                    “silence” became the source of much controversy in the proceedings\n                    below and that ultimately led to the wholly unnecessary delay between\n                    hearings. 145    To be fair to the experts, it was not the\n                    case that their submissions were entirely devoid of references to legal\n                    authority. For example, the exchange between Mr Kyung and Prof Kim over the\n                    validity of the ATA in transferring the lease credits to HKA (see [11] above)\n                    was keenly contested on a point of legal principle. In his first opinion, Mr\n                    Kyung pointed out that Art 37 of the Lease Agreement required the transfer of\n                    rights belonging to HKC to be “with prior consent from [Sejin]”,\n                    yet the ATA, which purported to transfer HKC’s right to the lease credits\n                    to HKA, appeared to have been executed without such consent. In response, Prof\n                    Kim relied heavily on a judgment of the Supreme Court of Korea to establish\n                    that, as a matter of Korean law, an agreement not to transfer credits without\n                    the prior consent of the obligor (ie, Sejin) could\n                    only be raised against the transferee (ie, HKA)ifthe transferee knew of the agreement in the\n                    first place, and there was nothing to suggest that HKA knew of Art 37 of the\n                    Lease Agreement between HKC and Sejin. 146    The problem, however, was that these\n                    references were of little assistance because they ultimately pertained to a moot\n                    point. The scope of what the ATA purported to transfer was merely thecreditsunder the Lease Agreement (see [11] and [44]\n                    above). Even if HKC succeeded in proving that the ATA was valid, this would only\n                    mean that the right to receive the credits was indeed transferred to HKA.\n                    However, the transfer ofcreditsunder the Lease\n                    Agreement does not, in and of itself, answer the critical question of whether\n                    HKA could properlyterminatethe Lease Agreement\n                    by issuing the 4 April Notice. The central inquiry is still whether theright to terminate the Lease Agreementhad\n                    been transferred to HKA and that point, in the experts’ views at least,\n                    turned on the construction of the words “right” or\n                    “status” in theNCTwhich,\n                    unfortunately, was a subject on which conclusions were reached without adequate\n                    reference to legal authority. In this regard, I note that the question of the\n                    validity of the ATA featured neither in the Assistant Registrar’s decision\n                    nor was it raised on appeal before me. 147    It is therefore regrettable that the\n                    experts’ opinions on the appropriate construction of theNCTwere not supplemented with references to Korean law\n                    principles in the same way their opinions on the validity of the ATA\n                    were. The protracted nature of the proceedings below 148    In the proceedings below, HKC was\n                    represented by Ms Vivian Ang (“Ms Ang”) but, by the time of the\n                    appeal before me, HKC had engaged new solicitors and was represented by Mr Heng.\n                    As for the plaintiffs in the four admiralty actions, they were represented by\n                    the same counsel throughout. Winplus was represented by Ms Sharmini,\n                    Frumentarius and KRC were represented by Ms Tan, and Mercuria was represented by\n                    Mr Tay. 149    The first day of hearing before the\n                    Assistant Registrar commenced on 11 October 2012. It is notable that, at the end\n                    of this hearing, Ms Ang was recorded as having submitted that Mr Choi had\n                    “no issue with the April termination notice”. It appears that what\n                    Ms Ang had meant by this submission is that Mr Choi agreed with Prof Kim that\n                    the NCT was effective in transferring the right to terminate the Lease Agreement\n                    to HKA. This point was only followed up on some time later by Ms\n                Tan. 150    The parties appeared before the Assistant\n                    Registrar the next day but this hearing was adjourned because an objection was\n                    raised that certain Korean documents which Prof Kim had referred to in his\n                    opinions had not been translated in full. Prof Kim was given until 5 November\n                    2012 to file and serve an affidavit with all additional translations and the\n                    Assistant Registrar also fixed four additional days of hearing on 19, 20, 21 and\n                    23 November 2012. On 5 November 2012, however, Ms Ang’s firm wrote to\n                    inform the court that her clients were unable to complete the translation of all\n                    the relevant Korean documents as they were quite substantial and requested for a\n                    one week extension. In light of this, the court wrote to all parties two days\n                    later informing them to attend a special pre-trial conference\n                    (“PTC”) on 15 November 2012. 151    At the 15 November 2012 PTC, the Assistant\n                    Registrar inquired into the status of the translation and was informed that the\n                    relevant documents had already been filed and served. However, the Assistant\n                    Registrar was then informed by Ms Tan that Mr Choi had filed a third affidavit\n                    to clarify that, contrary to Ms Ang’s submission on the first day of\n                    hearing, he didnotagree with Prof Kim’s\n                    opinion on the effect of the NCT but was, instead, aligned with Mr Kyung on this\n                    issue. Ms Ang objected to this. In her view, Mr Choi was taking a\n                    “radically different” position in his third affidavit and thus she\n                    requested for time to advise her clients on the legal avenues available to them,\n                    including making an application under O 40A r 4 of the ROC for leave to put\n                    questions to Mr Choi in relation to his third affidavit. In the result, the\n                    Assistant Registrar vacated the four hearing dates which had earlier been\n                    scheduled and directed that if Ms Ang were minded to make an application under O\n                    40A r 4, she was to do so by 29 November 2012. 152    The parties next attended before the\n                    Assistant Registrar at a PTC on 13 December 2012. Ms Ang informed the\n                    Assistant Registrar that she had yet to file an application under O 40A r 4. She\n                    explained that she had held back from doing so because her clients were\n                    exploring the possibility of transferring the issues which were subject to\n                    Korean law to be heard by the Korean courts. This was the first time that the\n                    other parties had heard of this proposal and, in the face of their resistance,\n                    Ms Ang eventually agreed to have the matter proceed in Singapore. She sought an\n                    extension of time to file the O 40A r 4 application and the Assistant Registrar\n                    directed that this be done by the following day. This was duly complied with. Ms\n                    Ang filed Summons No 6434 of 2012 (“SUM 6434/2012”) on 14\n                    December 2012 seeking leave to put questions to Mr Choi regarding his third\n                    affidavit. The hearing of this summons was fixed for 15 February\n                2013. 153    Prior to the hearing of SUM 6434/2012, Mr\n                    Choi filed a fourth affidavit on 11 January 2013 in which he maintained that his\n                    third affidavit was merely clarificatory in nature and did not constitute a\n                    substantive change in his position. He explained that his silence on the effect\n                    of the ATA and NCT in his second opinion did not mean that he agreed with Prof\n                    Kim’s views and reiterated that he shared the same opinion as Mr Kyung on\n                    this issue. In conclusion, he stated that it was unnecessary for questions to be\n                    put to him pursuant to O 40A r 4. I pause to observe that Mr Choi was right in\n                    saying that his silence did not mean that he had agreed with Prof Kim as the\n                    burden of proof of foreign law rests with the party asserting it. However, after\n                    several rounds of hearings on 15, 20 February and 22 April 2013, the Assistant\n                    Registrar eventually granted leave for questions to be put to Mr Choi who was,\n                    in turn, required to provide his answers by 10 May 2013. Mr Choi complied by\n                    duly filing a fifth affidavit within the stipulated time. However, nothing of\n                    note emerged from this application. 154    This long-drawn skirmish over Mr\n                    Choi’s position on the ATA/NCT issue finally drew to a close at a special\n                    PTC on 19 June 2013. The Assistant Registrar was informed that HKC would not be\n                    filing further affidavits in reply to Choi’s third, fourth, and fifth\n                    affidavits and this paved the way for HKC’s setting aside and striking out\n                    applications to recommence hearing. This was scheduled to take place on 2 July\n                    2013, regrettably almost nine months after the first day of\n                hearing. 155    There were 13 days of hearings between 2\n                    July 2013 and the final day on 20 September 2013. Having perused the Notes of\n                    Evidence below, it is plain to me that the parties spent a considerable amount\n                    of this time poring over the experts’ various rounds of opinions and\n                    pitting one against the other on the two material points of departure that arose\n                    from their first two rounds of opinions. Was this at all necessary?\n                    Unfortunately not. The opinion of a foreign law expert is used toprovethecontentof that\n                    foreign law by reference to relevant sources of law. However, not only were the\n                    opinions poor guides to the content of Korean law, the parties themselves did\n                    not appear to think that the case would have been decided differently if Korean\n                    law, rather than Singapore law, applied. That being the case, I fail to see how\n                    it was relevant or useful for the parties to trawl through the opinions as they\n                    did below. Given this state of affairs, I consider it beneficial to express some\n                    views on the proof of foreign law in general before expounding, in particular,\n                    on what an expert’s opinion on foreign law should seek to encompass,\n                    particularly where the matter concerns the construction of private\n                    documents. 156    Before doing so, I should mention that, from\n                    my reading of the Judgment below, little weight, if any, was eventually accorded\n                    to the opinions of the Korean law experts. Although the contest on the differing\n                    opinions on Korean law dominated the hearings before the Assistant Registrar,\n                    the opinions barely featured in the Judgment. Of the four principal grounds of\n                    her decision summarised in [33(a)] above, the only issue in which the Assistant\n                    Registrar appeared to have peripherally relied on Korean law was whether HKA\n                    could exercise the right of termination. In this regard, she preferred\n                    Mr Kyung’s opinion over Prof Kim’s that the ATA did not\n                    transfer the right to terminate and that the NCT could not transfer more rights\n                    than those transferred under the ATA. In my view, that was a conclusion capable\n                    of being reached based on a simple construction of the terms of the ATA and the\n                    NCT. The experts did not add any value to the analysis of that issue which, in\n                    any case, is a matter ultimately for the court to construe.",
        "Proof of foreign law": "General principles 157    It is well-established that the content of\n                    foreign law is a question of fact which must be pleaded and proved. In general,\n                    however, parties are notobligedto do so even if,\n                    according to the rules of private international law, the issue at hand is\n                    governed by foreign law. Indeed, parties often have sound reasons for choosing\n                    to ignore foreign law. Undertaking to prove foreign law can be an expensive\n                    exercise. Furthermore, where an application of foreign law will lead to the same\n                    result as an application of the law of the forum, it is also unnecessary (see\n                    Pippa Rogerson,Collier’s Conflict of Laws(Cambridge University Press, 4th Ed, 2013) at p 50). 158    Where, however, a party has pleaded and\n                    wishes to prove foreign law, he has two modes by which he can adduce such proof.\n                    As the Court of Appeal noted in the leading case ofPacific\n                        Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal[2008]\n                    2 SLR(R) 491 (“Pacific Recreation”)\n                    at [54], such a party has the option of (a) directly adducing raw sources of\n                    foreign law as evidence; and/or (b) adducing the opinion of an expert on foreign\n                    law. However, as the Court of Appeal went on to observe at [60], even if raw\n                    sources of foreign law were admissible under the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev\n                    Ed) (“Evidence Act”), it is still “preferable” for\n                    them to be accompanied by expert opinions whenever possible. This is simply\n                    “a matter of prudence” because our courts may well find it\n                    difficult to competently interpret such raw sources of foreign law unaided (seeWong Kai Woon alias Wong Kai Boon and another v Wong Kong\n                        Hom alias Ng Kong Hom and others[2000] SGHC 176 at\n                [55]). 159    Where the foreign law is not proved, the\n                    content of foreign law will be presumed to be the same as the law of the forum\n                    (seeGoh Chok Tong v Tang Liang Hong[1997] 1\n                    SLR(R) 811 at [84]). This result is unsurprising. As the Court of Appeal\n                    explained inEFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik\n                        Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another[2014] 1 SLR 860 at [57],\n                    the court lacks knowledge of foreign law and must therefore be informed of its\n                    content by evidence from the parties. In the absence of satisfactory proof of\n                    foreign law, Singapore courts will simply apply Singapore law. The court will\n                    generally not take judicial notice of foreign law, subject to the exceptions\n                    provided in s 59 of the Evidence Act. The role of the foreign law expert generally 160    The role of an expert in providing an\n                    opinion on foreign law was neatly summarised by Evans LJ inMCC Proceeds Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc and others[1999] CLC 417 (“MCC Proceeds”) and\n                    adopted by the Court of Appeal inPacific\n                        Recreationat [76]. According to Evans LJ, the three main duties\n                    of a foreign law expert are: (1) to inform the court of the relevant contents of the foreign law;\n                        identifying statutes or other legislation and explaining where necessary the\n                        foreign court's approach to their construction; (2) to identify judgments or other authorities, explaining what status\n                        they have as sources of the foreign law; and (3) where there is no authority directly in point, to assist the English\n                        judge in making a finding as to what the foreign court's ruling would be if\n                        the issue was to arise for decision there. 161    It is clear from this exposition that the\n                    foremost function of an expert witness on foreign law is to inform the court of\n                    the relevantcontentsof the foreign law and he\n                    does so chiefly by placing the relevant sources of foreign law before the court,\n                    whether they be statutory or in the form of foreign decisions (seePacific Recreationat [77]). Indeed, this is a\n                    requirement under O 40A r 3(2)(b) of the ROC which\n                    states that an expert’s report must “give details of any literature\n                    or other material which the expert witness has relied on in making the\n                    report”. 162    Evans LJ acknowledged, however, that there\n                    may well be circumstances where there is no authority directly in point. In such\n                    circumstances, there is much greater scope for the expert to give opinion\n                    evidence on the matter. However, it is notable that Evans LJ stressed at [24] ofMCC Proceedsthat the expert’s role was\n                    still restricted to “predict[ing] the likely decision of a foreign\n                    court” and not to “press upon the English judge the\n                    witness’s personal views as to what the foreign law might be”. This\n                    merely expresses the commonsensical view that the court can derive no meaningful\n                    assistance from the bare assertions of experts on foreign law advanced without\n                    any objectively explicable basis. This point was reinforced by the Court of\n                    Appeal inPacific Recreationat [85]: Whatever the case, it is clear that the expert cannot merely present his\n                        conclusion on what the foreign law is without also presenting the underlying\n                        evidence and the analytical process by which he reached his conclusion.\n                        … 163    In the event that there are relevant sources\n                    of foreign law, the expert’s role generally extends further than simply\n                    placing them before the court: he should also explain the effect of such foreign\n                    law because the raw contents on their own might often mislead persons not\n                    familiar with the particular system of law (seePacific\n                        Recreationat [78]). Therefore, where the expert has cited\n                    foreign cases, he should seek to explain how the foreign court would regard it\n                    in terms of its precedential value. Likewise, where the court is concerned with\n                    the construction of a foreign statute, the expert should set out the relevant\n                    foreign rules of statutory construction and state his views on the meaning and\n                    effect of the foreign statute in question (seePacific\n                        Recreationat [79]). I pause to observe that it is somewhat\n                    ironic thatPacific Recreationwas repeatedly\n                    cited by HKC to remind the opposing experts of theirdutiesto the court even though the more important lesson to be\n                    extracted fromPacific Recreationconcerned theroleof experts in the proof of foreign\n                    law. The limited role of the foreign law expert in the construction of\n                private documents 164    It is important to note for present\n                    purposes, however, that the foreign law expert’s role is more\n                    circumscribed where he is asked to provide the court with an opinion concerning\n                    the construction of a private document. In such circumstances, expert evidence\n                    is only admissible for the “limited purpose” of identifying the\n                    relevant foreign law principles of construction andnotfor the additional purpose of expressing an opinion as to\n                    the true construction applying those principles (seePhipson\n                        on Evidence(Hodge M Malek gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 18th Ed,\n                    2013) at para 33-83; see also Richard Fentiman,International\n                        Commercial Litigation(Oxford University Press, 2010) at para\n                    6.39). This nuanced distinction was also recognised by the Court of Appeal inPacific Recreationat [81]: …[I]t should be noted that the expert's role differs\n                            slightly when the issue is the construction of a foreigndocument,\n                            as opposed to a foreignstatutory\n                            provision.InKing v Brandywine Reinsurance Co[2005] 1 Lloyd's\n                        Rep 655, the court had to consider the meaning of the phrase \"removal of\n                        debris\" contained in an insurance policy document which was governed by New\n                        York law. Waller LJ incisively stated at [68] that: It is perhaps also important to remember thatthe role of an expert, unless the court is concerned with\n                                    special meanings, is to prove the rules of construction of the\n                                    foreign law, and it is then for the court to interpret the\n                                    contract in accordance with those rules. In other\n                                words the view of the expert as to the meaning which would be given\n                                to the word \"debris\" isnot admissibleevidence unless he is saying that it has a special meaning under New\n                                York law [see Dicey & Morris 13th ed., 32-189]. [original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold] 165    The proposition set out by Waller LJ inKing v Brandywine Reinsurance Co[2005] 1\n                    Lloyd’s Rep 655 in the passage above has been repeatedly endorsed by the\n                    English courts (see,eg,Rendall v Combined Insurance Co of America[2005] EWHC 678\n                    (Comm) at [68];Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue\n                        and Customs and another v Ben Nevis (Holdings) Ltd and others[2012] EWHC 1807 (Ch) at [41]). A good illustration of its application can be\n                    seen inRouyer Guillet Et Compagnie v Rouyer Guillet & Co\n                        Ltd[1949] 1 All ER 244. There, the defendants were English\n                    companies which had applied to stay an action for passing off against them\n                    commenced by the plaintiff French company. The applications essentially turned\n                    on the construction of two sources of foreign law: (a) a 1925 French statute;\n                    and (b) a document which was, in effect, the articles of association of the\n                    French company. Expert evidence was adduced in respect of both these matters and\n                    what is particularly instructive is the different treatment accorded to each of\n                    them by the English Court of Appeal. This can be seen in the speech of Lord\n                    Greene MR (with whom Somervell and Evershed LJJ agreed) at 244: I must make it clear that the evidence of French law is\n                            subject toa certain differentiationas between the evidence of the meaning of\n                            the law of 1925 and the evidence of the meaning of the\n                            articles.As I understand the law of England, evidence as to\n                        the meaning of the statute is to be obtained from the evidence of expert\n                        French witnesses and the decisions of the French courts. On a matter of\n                        French law the decision of a French court would be most persuasive.On the other hand,evidence on the construction of a private document, such as articles of\n                            association, is admissible so far as it deals with French rules of\n                            construction or French rules of law or the explanation of French\n                            technical terms, but evidence as to its meaning after those aids have\n                            been taken into account is not admissible. It is for the court to\n                            construe the document, having fortified itself with the permissible\n                            evidence.… [emphasis added in italics and in bold\n                        italics] 166    The origin of the principle as articulated\n                    above appears to stretch back to the early case ofThe\n                        Duchess Di Sora v AL Phillipps and others, executors, etc(1863)\n                    10 HLC 624 (“Di Sora”). InDi Sora, the court had to construe a particular article\n                    in a pre-nuptial agreement executed in Rome in the Italian language between\n                    parties domiciled there. Many Italian witnesses were examined at the first\n                    instance hearing in order to elucidate the legal meaning and effect of this\n                    single article. When the matter came up before the House of Lords, however, it\n                    was noted that there appeared to be some confusion over the role of expert\n                    opinion in the construction of a foreign private document. This state of\n                    relative uncertainty was neatly summed up in the opening passages of Lord\n                    Chelmsford’s speech at 636–637: My Lords, this case, in which the evidence fills so large a volume, and\n                        which has occupied so many days in hearing the arguments only of the counsel\n                        for the Appellants, turns upon the construction of one short clause in a\n                        written contract executed in a foreign country. Hence has arisen the\n                        necessity of having recourse to witnesses skilled in the law of that\n                        country, in order to assist the English Judge in his duty of construing the\n                        clause in question. This necessity has given rise to a controversy at the\n                        bar as to the extent to which the Judge requires and is bound to accept the\n                        opinions of these skilled witnesses. The limits within which experts in\n                        foreign law (always assuming their credibility), are to be authoritative in\n                        cases in which their aid is required, seem never to have been exactly\n                        defined. … … [It] is said on one side, that upon a question of the\n                        construction of a contract, the province of the witnesses ought to be\n                        confined to giving information as to the law of the country applicable to\n                        the case, and as to the sense of words and phrases in the instrument which\n                        bear a peculiar or technical meaning, or which, taken together, require a\n                        peculiar construction, and that the mind of the Judge will then be\n                        sufficiently instructed to enable him to assume the office of construction\n                        which properly belongs to him. On the other side it is contended that the skilled witnesses must be the\n                        guides of the Judge, and must lead him by the hand throughout; that they\n                        must not only inform his mind as to the law, but must teach him the correct\n                        construction of the instrument itself. … 167    Lord Chelmsford then went on to explain why,\n                    of the two contrasting approaches as set out above, the latter was wrong in\n                    principle. In his view, the true construction to be placed on a private document\n                    was a question of law to be answered by the judge who would, if he merely\n                    adopted the views of the foreign experts uncritically, be derelict in his\n                    duties. Viewed in this manner, the role of the expert must therefore be confined\n                    to the giving of evidence on thecontentof the\n                    foreign law, such as the relevant rules of construction. As Lord Chelmsford\n                    stated at 638–639 ofDi Sora: …[I]t is difficult to understand how the construction of a\n                            contract can be a question of fact. The construction of a contract is\n                            nothing more than the gathering of the intention of the parties to it\n                            from the words they have used.If the law applicable to the\n                        case has ascribed a peculiar meaning to particular words, the parties using\n                        them must be bound to that meaning; but if there is no such established\n                        sense, the intention must be collected in the ordinary manner from the\n                        language employed, and we know from experience that different minds often\n                        arrive at opposite conclusions of intention from the same expressions.The meaning of a foreign instrument, therefore\n                            (cleared of the difficulty of technical terms), cannot be a fact to be\n                            proved; it is at the utmost merely a probable opinion of the witnesses\n                            as to the construction which would be likely to be put upon it by the\n                            foreign tribunal. And if the Judge is implicitly to receive the opinion\n                            of the witnesses, or of the majority of them, they in fact perform his\n                            office, and construe the instrument for him. …The office of construction of a written instrument,\n                            whether foreign or domestic, brought into controversy before our\n                            tribunals, properly belongs to the Judge.In the case of a foreign instrument, he necessarily requires some\n                            person's assistance. In the first place he must have a translation of\n                            the instrument, a translator being (as I have already said) a\n                        witness as to the meaning and also the grammatical construction of the\n                        words.He must then have the way cleared for him by\n                            explanatory evidence, of any words which are of a technical description,\n                            or which have a peculiar meaning, different from that which, literally\n                            translated into our language, they would bear; and, if there is any\n                            established principle of construction of the particular instrument by\n                            the foreign tribunal, proof of it must be given.But the witnesses having supplied the Judge with all\n                            these facts, they must retire and leave his sufficiently informed mind\n                            to his own proper office—that of ascertaining for himself the\n                            intention of the parties; or, in other words, of construing the language\n                            of the instrument in question.

        "The quality of the expert evidence in the present case": "168    Armed with a proper appreciation of the\n                    foreign law expert’s role, especially in the context of construing private\n                    documents, I turn now to consider the opinions of the three Korean law experts\n                    here to determine whether the experts had kept within their remit. 169    InWu Yang Construction\n                        Group Ltd v Zhejiang Jinyi Group Co, Ltd and others[2006] 4\n                    SLR(R) 451 at [14], Andrew Phang Boon Leong J (as he then was) stated that the\n                    ability of the (domestic) court to make an informed decision on a question\n                    determinable by reference to foreign law “is dependent largely on the\n                    quality of the expert evidence adduced”. It should be clear by now that I\n                    was less than impressed by the quality of the expert opinions in the present\n                    case. Round after round of opinions were filed but, each time, they were wide\n                    off the mark in terms of whatshouldhave been\n                    addressed. There was little attempt by any of the experts to put forward and\n                    explain the sources of foreign law which they were relying on to aid the\n                    court’s construction of the Lease Agreement, ATA and NCT, but where they\n                    did cite such foreign sources of law, for example to establish the validity of\n                    the ATA, this turned out to be irrelevant. To put it bluntly, the experts were\n                    offering their personal views of the matter instead of assisting this court with\n                    evidence of the content of foreign law. InThe\n                        “H156”[1999] 2 SLR(R) 419, G P Selvam J noted\n                    perceptively at [14] that the expert opinion there consisted only of “one\n                    judgmental sentence” which was also unaccompanied by any propositions of\n                    foreign law or foreign materials to support the expert’s conclusion. In\n                    these circumstances, Selvam J witheringly described the expert’s report at\n                    [27] as a mere “pretended opinion” and held that any reliance\n                    placed on it would be “completely misconceived because there was no\n                    opinion before the court”. In my view, Selvam J’s observations are\n                    equally applicable in the present case. 170    To compound matters, the experts’\n                    opinions here were not only problematic for what they lacked but also for what\n                    they contained. In my view, the experts were effectively makingsubmissionson what the true construction of the\n                    relevant documents should be. In doing so, they had clearly overstepped their\n                    role which, as I have explained, is limited only to the provision of the rules\n                    of construction under Korean law. For example, it was not for Prof Kim to opine\n                    on the meaning of the terms “right” and “status” as\n                    used in the NCT and to conclude that incorporated within these terms was\n                    precisely the right to terminate the Lease Agreement as HKC hoped to establish.\n                    Neither was it for Mr Kyung and Mr Choi to interpret the requirements of Art\n                    24(2) of the Lease Agreement and conclude that the 4 April Notice was\n                    deficient by reference to those requirements. They merely expressed their own\n                    views on these issues without attempting to provide the court with any source of\n                    Korean law in aid of their conclusions. 171    To clarify, I am not suggesting that the\n                    experts were necessarily wrong in their submissions. All I am saying is that\n                    this is not the role of the foreign law expert. It is the court’s duty to\n                    determine the correct construction of a private document but, unfortunately, the\n                    parties appeared not to have appreciated this point. The protracted battle over\n                    the expert opinions (which dominated the hearings below) only served to prolong\n                    matters unnecessarily and at great cost. It is hoped that, in future, such a\n                    misunderstanding on the role of foreign law experts will not be repeated. Having\n                    said that, it is the duty of the Singapore instructing counsel to apprise the\n                    foreign law experts of their limited and targeted role."
