        "The pleadings": "42     I turn now to the pleadings. The statement of\n                    claim was prolix to the extreme numbering 84 pages as the plaintiff set out\n                    (unnecessarily) almost verbatim, the report of I-Analysis. I will not repeat the\n                    plaintiff’s various heads of claim as they have been set out in[1]and[2]above. 43     As for the defence, the first to sixth\n                    defendants filed a joint defence while Chow filed his own separate defence as\n                    the seventh defendant. In their joint defence, the six defendants essentially\n                    denied they had breached their fiduciary duties as directors and/or their\n                    employment contracts and that they had engaged in a conspiracy to harm the\n                    plaintiff and/or to siphon off its business. The defendants contended that the\n                    third defendant only commenced operations on 1 April 2005 notwithstanding\n                    its incorporation two months earlier. They denied that the third defendant\n                    operated at the plaintiff’s premises without the latter’s knowledge\n                    and consent. They asserted that the third defendant conducted its business\n                    openly and with the plaintiff’s knowledge at the plaintiff’s\n                    premises between 1 April 2005 and 18 July 2005. 44     The defendants alleged that the plaintiff\n                    failed to pay their salaries for the month of June 2005 and that Peter had paid\n                    the employees their salaries on the plaintiff’s behalf. (This complaint\n                    was not pursued at the trial). The defendants admitted that Chow only dealt with\n                    Justin and Richard for the NH Glass project but denied that they had conspired\n                    with Chow to cause harm and/or loss to the plaintiff. The defendants pleaded\n                    that the third defendant was incorporated to take over the plaintiff’s\n                    projects because Lim wanted to close down the plaintiff’s operations and\n                    for that reason, the third defendant took over the NH Glass\n                project. 45     In his defence, Chow disclaimed knowledge of\n                    the plaintiff’s capital structure and shareholdings and averred that he\n                    only dealt with Justin as a director of the plaintiff, as Justin was in charge\n                    of the plaintiff’s electrical engineering works. Chow asserted that he\n                    dealt with Richard, Peter and Bob as employees of the plaintiff. Chow stated he\n                    was unaware that Justin ceased employment with the plaintiff on 30 June\n                    2005 or that Justin was a shareholder of the third defendant. 46     Chow denied he had acted in concert with the\n                    six defendants to defraud and harm the plaintiff as alleged in the statement of\n                    claim. Chow averred that although he paid the plaintiff`$75,000 on\n                    4 January 2005, progress was slow on the NH Glass project. Justin informed\n                    him in February 2005 that the plaintiff was unable to complete the NH Glass\n                    project on time whereas the third defendant could do so under Justin’s\n                    supervision. Justin requested that Chow terminate the plaintiff’s contract\n                    and award the same to the third defendant. Out of anxiety that the NH Glass\n                    project would be delayed, Chow averred that he agreed to Justin’s request\n                    and issued the cancellation letter (which Justin prepared) to the plaintiff. He\n                    trusted Justin totally. Chow stated he paid all invoices issued to him by the\n                    third defendant. 47     I should point out that by an order of court\n                    dated 9 March 2009, the plaintiff was ordered to provide security for costs\n                    of $60,000 to the six defendants. By another order of this court on\n                    22 September 2009 (after the first part hearing in July 2009), the\n                    plaintiff was ordered to provide further security of $40,000 for the costs of\n                    the defendants, making a total of $100,000.",
        "The evidence": "",
        "The plaintiff’s case": "48     Besides Lim (PW1), Cerasi (PW2) and Ronald\n                    (PW3), the plaintiff’s other four witnesses were Lim’s wife (PW4),\n                    Lim’s son (PW7) as well as the plaintiff’s auditor Sashi Kala Devi\n                    (“Devi”) (PW5) and one of its labour supply subcontractors Joseph\n                    Lim Swee King (PW6). Each defendant testified for his/her own case and in\n                    Justin’s case, he testified for the third defendant as well. As for Chow,\n                    he appeared in person as his previous solicitors had discharged themselves from\n                    acting for him before the trial. Chow revealed to the court that he lacked the\n                    funds to pay for legal representation. 49     Lim was the key witness for the plaintiff. His\n                    AEIC was lengthy, his exhibits voluminous and his cross-examination extended to\n                    almost three days. His testimony was heavily criticised in the defendants’\n                    closing submissions as being neither credible nor truthful nor consistent with\n                    documents that were before the court. 50     The other witness of the plaintiff who came in\n                    for equally strong criticism by the defendants was Cerasi who was accused of\n                    disregarding his duties as an independent expert under Order 40A of the Rules of\n                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed (“the Rules”). I shall\n                    consider the criticism against Cerasi when I look at his testimony later.\n                    Meanwhile, I turn my attention to Lim’s evidence. 51     Having reviewed his testimony, I am of the\n                    view that the defendants’ criticism of Lim (PW1) was not unwarranted. He\n                    repeatedly claimed he could not recall events (until he was admonished by the\n                    court), he prevaricated and often contradicted himself in the course of\n                    cross-examination. Despite his assertion that Ronald was neither a shareholder\n                    nor involved in the plaintiff in any way, Lim could not satisfactorily explain\n                    why Ronald went to the extent of filing an affidavit on the plaintiff’s\n                    behalf (on 4 February 2009 in exhibit D2) to oppose the defendants’\n                    application for security for costs. In fact, Lim claimed that he did not even\n                    ask Ronald to file the affidavit nor did he instruct the plaintiff’s\n                    solicitors to do so. It was only after considerable pressing by the court that\n                    Lim admitted he had informed Ronald of the contents of Justin’s affidavit\n                    filed in support of the application. His explanation as to how Ronald was so\n                    well informed on the affairs of the plaintiff as to be able to oppose the\n                    application was absurd – Lim claimed that Ronald frequently visited the\n                    plaintiff’s premises to play with the dogs and have meals there with the\n                    defendants who asked Ronald for his ideas. Ronald thereby became familiar with\n                    the company’s financial affairs (see p 22 of the defendants’\n                    submissions). Ronald’s explanation for his involvement in the application\n                    was that he was pulled in by Lim because he was a good friend of Lim. I should\n                    point out that this “good friend” of Lim’s went so far\n                    (according to the defendants’ case) as to propose at the management\n                    meeting held on 27 June 2005, that the plaintiff should cease operations\n                    with effect from 30 June 2005 because it was heavily in debt. 52     Lim maintained his denial that Ronald attended\n                    any management meetings of the plaintiff. He took the position that the minutes\n                    of such meetings prepared by the second defendant reflecting Ronald and himself\n                    (named as John Lim) as attendees were fabricated. These were for meetings that\n                    took place between 27 March 2004 and 27 June 2005. Ronald was recorded\n                    as having attended five out of eight meetings in question. The defendants\n                    pointed out that Lim could not offer any reason why the defendants would include\n                    Ronald in the meetings if indeed he (as well as Lim) was not present.\n                    Ronald’s surmise that the defendants bore a grudge against him because he\n                    did not want to give them his project[note: 5]was only a guess as Ronald himself\n                    admitted. 53     The defendants pointed out that Lim’s\n                    claim that he was unaware of and did not attend the management meeting on\n                    27 June 2005[note: 6]was even less credible because he referred to\n                    the same in his letter dated 29 June 2005[note: 7]terminating the employment of a staff\n                    member Zulkarnain Bin Said where he said: It is most unfortunate that we have to inform you that decisions have been\n                        made to close the Engineering department during the management meeting with\n                        effect from 30thJUNE 2005. The reasons due to\n                        slow down in business and the company have to trim down its overhead. We hereby, wish you best of luck for all your future ventures and hope\n                        that you could acquire a suitable job within the shortest period of\n                        time. Lim’s subsequent letters of termination addressed to the first\n                    to fifth defendants (but not the third defendant) all dated 18 July\n                        2005[note: 8]also referred\n                    to 30 June 2005 as the termination date. The defendants submitted that the\n                    words “during the management meeting” in para 1 of the above\n                    letter could only have referred to the meeting held on 27 June 2005, as\n                    both the minutes and the aforesaid letters referred to the same dateviz30 June 2005 as being the last date of\n                    operations for the plaintiff’s engineering department. 54     In their reply dated 18 July\n                        2005[note: 9]to Lim’s\n                    termination notice, Justin and Bob had pointed out the disruption to the\n                    plaintiff’s ongoing projects and its exposure to liability if the\n                    plaintiff ceased operations on 30 June 2005. They reminded Lim that\n                    “at the Board Meeting on 27 June 2005, the Board of Directors had\n                    decided that the Company’s operations were to continue until the end of\n                    July 2005 in order for the on-going projects to be completed”. Despite\n                    the reference to the management meeting on 27 June 2005 in his own letters\n                    as well as in Justin’s and Bob’s letters, Lim maintained his\n                    ignorance of the meeting. Neither did he question Justin or Bob on their\n                    reference to the board meeting of 27 June 2005 in their reply to\n                    him. 55     Lim also claimed he did not know of the\n                    existence of the third defendant until he engaged the services of I-Analysis.\n                    This denial was also challenged by the defendants who pointed to Lim’s\n                    note dated 4 July 2005 (see above at[27])[note: 10]to\n                    Justin (copied to Bob and Peter) where he said: Please make the necessary arrangements for any future letters concerning\n                        your company NOT to be sent to No. 4 Soon Lee Road (S) 628071. Please redirect all your letters with immediate effect. Confronted with the above document in cross-examination, Lim\n                        claimed[note: 11]that\n                    the word “company” referred to SY Instrumentation and not to the\n                    third defendant. When he was reminded by counsel for the defendants that in his\n                    own AEIC (at para 10), Lim had deposed that SY Instrumentation was a failed\n                    business of Justin’s, Lim’s (unconvincing) explanation was that he\n                    had received letters and correspondence addressed to SY Instrumentation which,\n                    when requested by counsel, he was unable to produce claiming he had handed them\n                    to Justin. Pressed further by the court, Lim changed tack and said Justin could\n                    well have registered the third company without operating it, despite the clear\n                    words that Lim used in the note. 56     Lim however did agree that he refused to allow\n                    Justin to have sight of the management accounts of either the plaintiff or SYEI\n                    because “they were not yet prepared”.[note: 12]It is noteworthy that\n                    according to the defendants, Justin had asked for the accounts at the management\n                    meeting on 13 August 2004 (which Lim and Ronald denied attending). During\n                        cross-examination[note: 13],\n                    Lim had three versions of when he was told of Justin’s request for\n                    accounts. First, he said he knew it was at the meeting held on 13 August\n                    2004 because Justin told him about the meeting although he did not attend.\n                    Later, he said that he learnt of the meeting subsequently from his staff Angie.\n                    His third version was that Angie told him of Justin’s request for the\n                    accounts but without mentioning any meeting. 57     The defendant submitted that the court should\n                    draw an adverse inference against the plaintiff for not calling Angie to testify\n                    not only on this aspect of the testimony, but also on the minutes of the meeting\n                    dated 3 June 2005 which set[note: 14]Theresa testified was not recorded\n                    by her[note: 15]but\n                    was given to her by Angie. Theresa’s version of the minutes of the meeting\n                    was also exhibited by the defendants. The significance of the minutes dated\n                    3 June 2005 (be it Angie’s or Theresa’s version) was that it\n                    recorded Justin’s request to rent space from the plaintiff. Lim had\n                    admitted there was such a discussion but he claimed it took place at a\n                    coffee-shop and not at the plaintiff’s premises. Leaving aside the venue\n                    of the discussion which is inconsequential, Lim’s own evidence meant that\n                    the plaintiff was aware that Justin was setting up a company to carry out\n                    mechanical engineering projects. I should point out that Lim initially claimed\n                    that Angie had left the plaintiff’s employment but retracted his testimony\n                    when counsel for the defendants confronted him with the plaintiff’s letter\n                    dated 14 July 2005 wherein Justin, Theresa, Peter and Bob were directed to\n                    hand over all the plaintiff’s documents to Angie.[note: 16] 58     Lim explained that he did not accept the April\n                    and May letters (see above at[15]) (which\n                    he described as “suspicious” and “unauthentic’ in\n                    para 47 of his AEIC) because Bob did not have his authorisation to issue\n                    those letters although he agreed that Justin’s last day of employment was\n                    30 June 2005. In this regard, the defendants pointed out that Lim\n                    contradicted his own AEIC as Lim had there (in para 46) deposed that\n                    Justin’s last day with the plaintiff was 30 April 2005 and he had not\n                    agreed to an extension until 30 June 2005. 59     It would not be necessary to refer to other\n                    aspects of Lim’s testimony as the extracts that were referred to above\n                    already cast grave doubts on his credibility as a whole. I turn instead to the\n                    defendants’ case as well as the case of Chow who, as will become evident\n                    later, was unwittingly sued merely for awarding the NH Glass project to the\n                    plaintiff prior to issuing the cancellation letter.",
        "The defendants’ case": "60     Richard corroborated Justin’s evidence\n                    that Bob had announced at a meeting on 7 January 2004 that Lim wanted Justin to\n                    stop all jobs of the plaintiff concerning the NH Glass project and that Justin\n                    should set up his own company. Their testimony that Lim stopped paying the\n                    plaintiff’s suppliers and contractors and this caused delay in the\n                    progress of the NH Glass project was supported by Chow, who said the delay\n                    prompted him to issue the warning letter on 1 April 2005 (see above at[35]). Because of Lim’s\n                    obstructive conduct, Justin requested for the issuance of the cancellation\n                    letter with Chow’s concurrence and arranged for the third defendant to\n                    continue work on the NH Glass project which was eventually completed in October\n                    2005. 61     In claiming the balance $225,000 for the NH\n                    Glass project, the defendants submitted that the plaintiff was in effect\n                    claiming for 75% of the work which it could not and did not do, due to its\n                    financial constraints and Lim’s conduct. 62     The defendants pointed out that the third\n                    defendant not only assumed liability for the job when it took over the NH Glass\n                    project but it also assumed the obligation to pay liquidated damages for delays\n                    at 10% per diem of the contract price, under its agreement dated 2 April\n                    2005 with the seventh defendant. 63     As for the plaintiff’s claim for\n                    purchase of materials totalling $124,564.83 (referred to at[5]above), Justin explained that not all the\n                    materials were used in the NH Glass project. Some were used in the SIS project.\n                    However, as Richard who was in charge of the SIS project had handed over all the\n                    plaintiff’s documents for the project, the defendants could not say which\n                    proportion of the materials went into the two projects. Pointedly, neither did\n                    the plaintiff produce any documents to support this claim. 64     In relation to the plaintiff’s claim for\n                    $20,000 which it alleged was wrongly paid to the third defendant by the seventh\n                    defendant, the defendants contended that this claim was baseless. The sum had\n                    nothing to do with the NH Glass project as it was reimbursement by the plaintiff\n                    to Justin for payment made to SLS, a subcontractor of the plaintiff, for the SIS\n                    project. SLS had supplied $40,000 worth of labour to the plaintiff for the SIS\n                    project. The evidence showed that the plaintiff made partial payment of $20,000\n                    for the labour supplied by a cheque in favour of SLS numbered 138896[note: 17]drawn on United Overseas\n                    Bank. 65     It was Justin’s testimony[note: 18]that he borrowed the balance\n                    $20,000 due to SLS from Chow which sum the plaintiff reimbursed him on\n                    28 March 2005. It was also Justin’s evidence[note: 19]that the third defendant\n                    issued an invoice dated 11 March 2005 for $20,000 to the seventh defendant\n                    at Chow’s request and it was backdated. Justin’s evidence was\n                    corroborated by Chow.[note: 20]Extrinsic evidence supporting Justin’s testimony was to be found in a\n                    payment voucher of the plaintiff dated 28 March 2005 and the\n                    plaintiff’s note to SLS dated 9 March 2005[note: 21]which SLS\n                    countersigned as acknowledgment of payment of $20,000. In the plaintiff’s\n                    note, the word “GLASS” denoting NH Glass had been cancelled and\n                    replaced with the word “SUGAR” denoting SIS, while the handwritten\n                    number 10481 thereon was that of the SIS project. Lim agreed with the\n                    defendants’ counsel that the corrections were made by Richard. I should\n                    point out that the payment voucher contained the reference number 10521 which\n                    was the job number for the NH Glass project. Further, when cross-examined, Lim\n                    admitted that when SLS sued the plaintiff, the latter proved it had paid $20,000\n                    to SLS by tendering the payment voucher as evidence. Consequently, the plaintiff\n                    implicitly accepted the defendants’ position on the payment\n                    voucher. 66     The defendants accused Lim of bad faith\n                    – Lim was well aware of the true position and yet he chose to fabricate\n                    this frivolous claim. The defendants pointed out that Lim relied on the third\n                    defendant’s invoice to the seventh defendant dated 11 March\n                        2005[note: 22]as well as the\n                    plaintiff’s payment voucher dated 28 March 2005 but deliberately\n                    failed to disclose the plaintiff’s note to SLS dated 9 March 2005\n                    until the trial. 67     I shall deal with the last item of the\n                    plaintiff’s claim ($90,000) that was allegedly received by the third\n                    defendant from Chow on 2 April 2005 vide OCBC cheque no. 655735 when I consider\n                    the testimony of Chow (see below at[75]). 68     The final issue in the defendants’ case\n                    related to the controversial minutes that Theresa prepared but which Lim and\n                    Ronald both disavowed. Theresa performed administrative functions in the\n                    plaintiff’s organisation and her dutyinter\n                        aliawas to assist Justin, Bob and Peter with recording of\n                    minutes of meetings, preparation of quotations and delivery orders. Like the\n                    other individual defendants, Theresa’s employment was terminated by the\n                    plaintiff on 30 June 2006. Although she had deposed in her AEIC that the\n                    plaintiff failed to pay her salary for June 2006 as well as one month’s\n                    salary in lieu of notice, Theresa informed the court that she was no longer\n                    pursuing those claims. 69     Theresa testified that she had prepared all\n                    the minutes (save one) which recorded the attendance of Lim and Ronald. These\n                    were for the meetings in (a), (b),(c),(f), (g) and (h) below. Theresa also\n                    prepared the minutes of other meetings. However, she did not attend the meeting\n                    in (e) but prepared the minutes based on what Justin, who attended, reported to\n                    her. Theresa also received from Angie a copy of the minutes the latter had\n                    prepared of the same meeting: (a)     On 24 March 2004, Bob announced\n                        that Justin would run the plaintiff’s administration department with\n                        immediate effect. (b)     On 13 August 2004[note: 23]Justin requested for the\n                        plaintiff’s accounts and for the balance sheet to be produced at the\n                        end of each month; Angie said the accounts department faced a heavy workload\n                        then. (This appeared to be the excuse why Justin did not receive the\n                        accounts and balance sheet subsequently). (c)     On 21 September 2004[note: 24]Ronald suggested that due\n                        to differences between the staff, it was decided (presumably by him and Lim)\n                        that the plaintiff and SYEI should be managed separately. (d)     On 7 January 2005[note: 25], Bob reported that Lim\n                        wanted him to inform Justin that the latter should stop getting new orders\n                        from the plaintiff and that Justin should set up his own company. Justin\n                        reported that no funds were coming from the finance department to pay the\n                        plaintiff’s workers, contractors and suppliers. (e)     On 28 January 2005[note: 26], Justin reported that Lim\n                        had expressed his intention to stop all jobs relating to the NH Glass\n                        project. As the plaintiff had collected a deposit, Justin felt the plaintiff\n                        had no choice but to complete the fabrication works to cover the deposit. He\n                        suggested that the seventh defendant take over the balance\n                    job. (f)     On 3 June\n                            2005[note: 27], it\n                        was reported that Justin had tendered his resignation on 31 March 2005\n                        and his last day would be 30 April 2005. Bob reported he would retain\n                        Justin and extend his stay until 30 June 2005 to complete projects.\n                        Staff of Justin and Richard would have their services terminated once the\n                        projects they worked on were completed. Justin would pay rent for the\n                        plaintiff’s premises and would let the plaintiff know what rental he\n                        would pay and the period of lease. Justin was not allowed to register his\n                        company’s address at the plaintiff’s premises. His\n                        company’s business dealings, his workers and subcontractors were not\n                        related in any way with the plaintiff. (g)     On 22 June 2005[note: 28], Lim reported on the loans and\n                        overdraft owed by the plaintiff to its bankers and said that the company had\n                        other creditors. He and Ronald suggested selling the plaintiff’s\n                        premises. Lim suggested that Justin rent a place elsewhere as the\n                        plaintiff’s premises may be sold off. (h)     On 27 June 2005[note: 29]Ronald reported that the\n                        plaintiff’s debts were too heavy and it would cease operations on\n                        30 June 2005. He proposed that the plaintiff’s premises be sold\n                        to settle the bank’s loan. Lim and Ronald agreed that Peter could\n                        continue doing the same business provided that a new company was set up and\n                        it had no connection with the plaintiff. Lim and Ronald further agreed that\n                        Peter could rent the plaintiff’s premises until the building was\n                        sold. 70     In cross-examination, Theresa clarified that\n                    she attended shareholders’ meetings but never prepared the minutes. She\n                    further clarified that the minutes of shareholders’ meetings were not\n                    recorded by her but by the company secretary of the plaintiff; she prepared\n                    minutes of informal meetings or directors’ meetings. Theresa maintained\n                    that the minutes she had recorded were a true and accurate reflection of what\n                    took place at meetings that she attended. Counsel for the plaintiff did not\n                    dispute that Therasa prepared the minutes. Indeed, in the plaintiff’s\n                    closing submissions (at para 86), Theresa’s minutes were relied on\n                    for the submission that they did not support the defendants’ case. I\n                    believe Theresa’s minutes fairly represented what transpired at meetings,\n                    notwithstanding the shortcomings in her grammar and language. As for the minutes\n                    of the meeting held on 3 June 2005, the only person who could disprove\n                    Theresa’s evidence that Angie prepared and handed her a copy of the\n                    minutes would be the latter. However, the plaintiff chose not to call Angie to\n                    testify, and did not offer any explanation that would preclude the court from\n                    drawing an adverse inference by her absence. 71     It would not be necessary to refer to the\n                    testimony of the other defendants as Richard, Peter and Bob essentially repeated\n                    and corroborated in parts, what Justin alleged in his AEIC; they were not\n                    material witnesses. The additional piece of evidence from Bob’s AEIC has\n                    already been set out earlier at[40].",
        "The seventh defendant’s case": "72     As stated earlier[48], Chow decided to act in person on 5 July 2008 which\n                    was just eight days before this trial commenced. His previous solicitors had not\n                    filed his AEIC before their discharge from acting for him. For the same reason,\n                    Chow did not file any closing submissions. In the interests of justice, Chow was\n                    allowed to give oral testimony and his examination-in-chief was led by the\n                    court. 73     Chow (DW6) testified that he had never\n                    communicated with Lim for the NH Glass project; he only dealt with Justin\n                    exclusively from the outset. Chow added that his only interest was to finish the\n                    NH Glass project within the three months’ deadline. Eventually, the\n                    project was completed in four months, after an extension of one month was given\n                    by his employer. Chow said he transferred the project to the third defendant at\n                    Justin’s request because he was told by Justin (whom he trusted) that\n                    technical problems had occurred in the plaintiff which would delay the project.\n                    Chow signed the cancellation letter dated 31 March 2005 to cancel the\n                    purchase order (see above at[4]) which\n                    Justin accepted on the plaintiff’s behalf on 1 April 2005. Chow then\n                    immediately accepted the third defendant’s offer letter dated\n                    31 March 2005 (signed by Justin) to take over the NH Glass project as he\n                    had no other alternative contractor; he was also under pressure from his\n                    employer coupled with the threat of being liable for a penalty amounting to 10%\n                    of his contract’s value of $400,000 if he did not complete the work in\n                    time. 74     According to Chow, it made little difference\n                    to him that the third defendant took over the NH Glass project as Justin\n                    continued to supervise the project. Even the third defendant’s address (at\n                    No. 4 Soon Lee Road) was the same as the plaintiff’s. Chow thought the\n                    third defendant was a subsidiary of the plaintiff. He pointed out that had he\n                    conspired with Justin as the plaintiff alleged, he would have deducted his share\n                    of the alleged secret profit before he paid the third defendant the balance 75%\n                    of the contract value. Chow added that he would never betray the plaintiff or\n                    Lim. He agreed with counsel for the defendants that as at 31 March 2005,\n                    the plaintiff had completed around 25% of the NH Glass project equivalent to\n                    $75,000 in value. 75     As for the $90,000 claim of the plaintiff,\n                    Chow agreed that the third defendant had rendered invoice numbered 238802/05 in\n                    that sum to the seventh defendant on 17 March 2005[note: 30]as 30% of the progress payment\n                    for the NH Glass project. Chow confirmed Justin’s earlier\n                        testimony[note: 31]that\n                    the sum was actually a loan Chow had extended to the third defendant at\n                    Justin’s request on or about 2 April 2005. This was corroborated by the\n                    seventh defendant’s payment voucher.[note: 32]Chow agreed that the third\n                    defendant’s said invoice had been backdated to 31 March 2005. The\n                    $90,000 payment was also reflected in the third defendant’s invoice\n                    numbered 238808/05 dated 23 April 2005[note: 33]to the seventh defendant which\n                    contained the following particulars: DescriptionQty.Unit PriceAmountTo supply and install Air\n                                            Ducting For NH Techno Glass Factory\n                                        Project1S$225,000.00S$225,000.00Less\n                                                1stprogressive\n                                            payment1S$20,000.00S$20,000.00Less\n                                                2ndprogressive\n                                            payment1S$90,000.00S$90,000.00Sub TotalS$115,000.00Add 5% GSTS$115,000.00   Chow concluded his testimony with his request to the court that the\n                    plaintiff’s claim against him should be dismissed as he had nothing to do\n                    with the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendants.",
        "The expert testimony": "76     As observed earlier (at[50]) the plaintiff’s expert’s\n                    testimony came in for heavy criticism from the defendants in their closing\n                    submissions. I turn my attention now to Cerasi’s evidence. 77     Cerasi (PW2), a digital computer forensic\n                    practitioner deposed in his AEIC that he was tasked with investigating the\n                    activities of the defendants to ascertain if they had committed any wrongdoings\n                    detrimental to the interests of the plaintiff, even though he agreed with\n                    counsel for the defendants[note: 34]that such issues were not within his\n                    area of expertise. Notwithstanding his admission in court, Cerasi’s report\n                    was replete with findings of wrongdoings on the part of the six defendants,\n                    essentially adopting Lim’s/the plaintiff’s allegations, thereby\n                    overstepping the boundaries of his mandate/duties as set out under O 40A r 2 of\n                    the Rules; it states: (1) It is the duty of an expert to assist the Court on the matters within\n                        his expertise. (2) This duty overrides any obligation to the person from whom he has\n                        received instructions or by whom he is paid. 78     An example of Cerasi’s shortcoming was\n                    highlighted by the defendants. Cerasi claimed (at paras 9, 10, 11 and 12 of his\n                    AEIC) that he was told that the defendants had contacted the plaintiff’s\n                    customers (such as Hitachi Zosen) to say that the third defendant was a\n                    subsidiary of the plaintiff and to incorrectly inform customers like Temptech\n                    Pte Ltd) that the plaintiff’s engineering department had closed and was\n                    operating as the third defendant. Cerasi stated he was told that the defendants\n                    then transferred ownership of the plaintiff’s account with its internet\n                    service provider as well as its telephone and fax lines to the third defendant.\n                    Further, Cerasi said he was also told that the defendants accepted the\n                    termination of the NH Glass project and sent the third defendant’s\n                    quotations for the same project but used materials purchased by the plaintiff\n                    for the same project. Such information could only have been furnished by Lim.\n                    Cerasi accepted the allegations at face value and failed to verify whether they\n                    were true. 79     Based on what Lim told him, Cerasi in his\n                    findings then set out all the allegedly wrongful activities/wrongdoings of each\n                    and every individual defendant as well as of other former employees of the\n                    plaintiff. For added measure, he went on (in para 17 of his AEIC) to depose\n                    that these individuals diverted business away from their employer to a new\n                    entityvizthe third defendant to the detriment of\n                    the plaintiff. He then concluded that the defendants had conspired to divert the\n                    NH Glass project to the third defendant to the plaintiff’s detriment. He\n                    further echoed Lim’s suspicions that the April and May letters signed by\n                    Bob were questionable. 80     Cerasi’s AEIC showed he obviously lacked\n                    impartiality and that his findings went against the grain of O 40A r 2(2) of the\n                    Rules. Consequently, I reject his testimony in toto.",
        "The findings": "81     The only issue for determination by this court\n                    is, did the defendants (other than the third defendant) breach their fiduciary\n                    duties as directors and/or their duties as employees of the plaintiff when\n                    Justin agreed with Chow to terminate the PO and offered to take over the NH\n                    Glass project on the third defendant’s behalf? 82     I had previously (at[51]) reviewed Lim’s testimony and concluded therefrom\n                    that the defendants’ criticisms that he was an unreliable as well as an\n                    untruthful witness were justified, in the light of Lim’s shifts in\n                    position, the numerous inconsistencies in his oral testimony and his repeated\n                    prevarications. Indeed, I disbelieve Lim’s testimony in its\n                    entirety. 83     Ronald fared no better than Lim as a witness.\n                    I am not persuaded he spoke the truth when he claimed he had no interest in the\n                    plaintiff or in its business. Ronald could not offer any plausible explanation\n                    why his being a good friend of Lim but an outsider of the company warranted his\n                    regular attendance at management and other meetings of the plaintiff and almost\n                    daily visits to the plaintiff’s premises. I am satisfied from\n                    Theresa’s testimony that she had accurately recorded the minutes of those\n                    meetings that showed Lim’s and Ronald’s attendance, despite their\n                    denials (which I reject). I need only to highlight three meetings, those held on\n                    21 September 2004, 22 June 2005 and 27 June 2005. Why would an\n                    outsider like Ronald actively participate at these meetings to say (on\n                    21 September 2004) that the plaintiff and SYEI should be managed separately\n                    and announce (at the June 2005 meetings) that the plaintiff’s premises\n                    should be sold because the company’s debts were too heavy? 84     I find that the defendants’ suspicions\n                    that Ronald was/is a major shareholder of the plaintiff were not unfounded. In\n                    all likelihood, Ronald’s shares in the plaintiff were/are held on trust\n                    for him by Lim who by all accounts was beholden to Ronald. It was Ronald who was\n                    instrumental in introducing Epson’s property to the plaintiff to purchase.\n                    That would explain why Ronald would not want to register himself as a\n                    shareholder and appear in the records of the Accounting and Regulatory Authority\n                    (“ACRA”). As an employee of Epson, even if he did not have an\n                    employment or a service contract (which is unlikely), he would still be in\n                    breach of his implied fidelity duties by having other business interests,\n                    particularly if such interests conflicted with his duties and responsibilities\n                    to Epson. First, Ronald had introduced Epson’s property to the plaintiff\n                    to purchase at $700,000. Then, the plaintiff sold the property for $1.8m. If he\n                    was/is a major shareholder of the plaintiff as Justin and the other defendants\n                    alleged and which I suspect is very likely, Ronald would obtain a substantial\n                    share of the profits. 85     I entertain no doubts on the veracity of the\n                    defendants’ testimony and that of Justin in particular; their version of\n                    events was corroborated by Chow, whom I found to be honest, forthright and a\n                    refreshing change from Lim and Ronald. 86     Chow’s testimony (see above at[65]and[74])\n                    in effect demolished the plaintiff’s claims for $20,000 and $90,000 as\n                    they were loans that Chow extended to Justin to help Justin pay\n                    subcontractors. 87     Before I address the plaintiff’s claims\n                    for $225,000 and $225,720 that were paid to the third defendant for the NH Glass\n                    project, I need first to deal with Lim’s professed claim that he was\n                    unaware of the existence of the third defendant until he engaged the services of\n                    I-Analysis. Earlier (at[55]), I had alluded\n                    to Lim’s note dated 4 June 2005 that strongly suggested that since he\n                    was not only aware of the third defendant existence but also that it operated at\n                    the plaintiff’s premises until the latter moved out, Lim’s\n                    explanation that he meant SY Instrumentation when he referred to the\n                    “company” is an untruth. My view is reinforced by his\n                        note[note: 35]dated 4 July 2005\n                    to Theresa, copied to Bob and Peter that stated: Further to our discussion, please take note of the following:- 1) Kindly make the necessary arrangement to inform your suppliers to bill\n                        under your company with immediate effect from01 July 2005. 2) Regarding the two lorriesYJ6711TandYJ6127Eplease inform us if your company\n                        is interested in buying. 3) Kindly arrange to give termination letter to the staff as at30/6/2005with immediate effect. Please let us a\n                        duplicate copy of the termination letter. 4) Regarding rental of premises by Mr Peter Lim, please let us know your\n                        rental charges. 5) Regarding Mr Justin Foo’s rental, what is the outcome of the\n                        payment? Please let us know immediately. 88     In response to Lim’s note, Peter had\n                    sent Lim a memorandum on 5 July 2005[note: 36]where he wrote: 1    Decision has been made to purchase only\n                            YJ6711T 2    Confirmed renting of existing office, Spray\n                            Booth/machine workshop and ground floor workshop at\n                        S$4000.00 3    Mr Justin Foo confirmed rental of workshop for the\n                            last one and a half month with electricity until\n                                15thof July at a total sum of S$3750.\n                            Please bill him accordingly. 89     I make two observations on the above\n                    documents. First, Lim’s note and Peter’s memorandum corroborated the\n                    minutes taken by Theresa of the two meetings in June 2005 (see [69(g) and (h)])\n                    which recorded that Lim and Ronald intended to cease the plaintiff’s\n                    operations as of 30 June 2005. Otherwise, why would the plaintiff terminate\n                    the services of all its staff and dispose of its vehicles one of which (YJ6711T)\n                    was purchased by Peter? Evidence of Peter’s purchase of the said vehicle\n                    for $20,000 is to be found in the plaintiff’s tax invoice SYH1244 dated\n                    28 September 2005.[note: 37]It is damning evidence\n                    of Lim’s character that he did not disclose his note, Peter’s\n                    memorandum or the tax invoice. Those documents either emanated from the\n                    plaintiff or were in its possession. But it was the defendants who produced\n                    them. 90     It is crystal clear from para 1 of\n                    Lim’s note that he must have known that the defendants had a company that\n                    would take over the plaintiff’s projects. Lim’s note also talked\n                    about Peter’s and Justin’s intention to rent space from the\n                    plaintiff. Such conduct on the part of the duo is not consistent with the\n                    plaintiff’s allegation that Justin and Theresa (the other director of the\n                    third defendant) incorporated the third defendant and carried out its operations\n                    surreptitiously at the plaintiff’s premises. 91     I should add that the plaintiff had novated\n                    its contract with SIS to Automation Control Engineering Pte Ltd on 14 September\n                    2005 and transferred two projects to Peter on 28 July 2005 (see above at[32]). Such acts were consistent with\n                    the defendants’ contention that Lim and Ronald wanted to close down the\n                    plaintiff’s operation. 92     Contrary to the plaintiff’s closing\n                    submissions, I do not find that any of the six defendants had breached their\n                    fiduciary duties (in the case of Justin and Bob) and/or fidelity duties as\n                    employees (in the case of Theresa, Richard and Peter) to the plaintiff. Neither\n                    do I accept that Peter, despite not being a director of the plaintiff, behaved\n                    as and was accepted as one and should similarly be held to owe fiduciary duties\n                    to the plaintiff, which he breached. Further, I do not accept that the third or\n                    seventh defendants had participated in any conspiracy with the other five\n                    defendants to cause harm to the plaintiff or that the third or seventh\n                    defendants had dishonestly assisted in any breach of fiduciary duties owed by\n                    the other defendants to the plaintiff. 93     The plaintiff’s submissions completely\n                    ignored the damning evidence extracted from Lim in cross-examination and which\n                    was corroborated either by his own correspondence or correspondence to him,\n                    and/or minutes of meetings that clearly showed that: (a)     Lim (and Ronald) intended to close\n                        down the plaintiff’s operations; (b)     Lim indicated to them that Justin and/or Peter\n                        could/should start their own company/companies to carry on the business of\n                        the plaintiff; (c)     Justin and/or Peter could rent space at the plaintiff’s premises for\n                        their new company/companies at rents to be agreed, provided the new\n                        company/companies had a different registered address from the\n                        plaintiff’s; (d)     Peter indicated to Lim that the third defendant would move out from\n                        the plaintiff’s premises after one and a half months’\n                        occupation; (e)     letters, correspondence and invoices of or to the third defendant were\n                        received at/sent out from the plaintiff’s\n                premises. 94     In its closing submissions, the plaintiff (at\n                    para 89) pointed out that the minutes of the meeting held on 7 January\n                    2005 stated that Lim wanted Justin to stop getting new orders and to set up a\n                    new company, not that Justin was permitted to set up a new company to take over\n                    the NH Glass project. Further, the minutes of the meeting on 28 January\n                    2005 showed that Justin himself reported that the seventh defendant, not the\n                    third defendant, was to take over the balance of the NH Glass project. Finally\n                    at the meeting on 3 June 2005, nothing was said specifically about the NH\n                    Glass project. On the contrary, it was reported that Justin was to continue all\n                    of his uncompleted projects (see above at [69(e)]. The plaintiff therefore\n                    argued that there was no evidence to suggest that the plaintiff consented to the\n                    third defendant’s taking over of the NH Glass project. 95     The above submissions completely disregarded\n                    the factual matrix of the case – as early as January 2005 (presumably\n                    after the PO dated 4 January 2005 was issued). Lim (according to Bob)\n                    wanted Justin to stop getting new orders. The NH Glass project was already in\n                    delay by March 2005 and by Lim’s own evidence, he expected Justin to leave\n                    the plaintiff’s services by 30 April 2005 since he had not authorised\n                    Bob to extend Justin’s employment until 30 June 2005. Who then was to\n                    take over the NH Glass project after 30 April 2005 if not Justin’s\n                    new company, the third defendant? The NH Glass project had always been under the\n                    charge of Justin with Richard’s assistance. 96     I would add that the plaintiff’s\n                    contention that the defendants’ pleadings had admitted to having breached\n                    their duties as employees of the plaintiff is incorrect (see paras 32 and 172 of\n                    its submissions). By para 18 of their common defence, the defendants\n                    admitted to paras 2 and 4 of the statement of claim in relation to their\n                    fiduciary duties as directors and their duties as employees respectively of the\n                    plaintiff, not that they had breached those duties. It was the plaintiff’s\n                    fault in pleading in one and the same sentence (in para 4 of the statement\n                    of claim) that the defendants owed duties as employees of the plaintiff which\n                    they had breached, that caused the defendants to make the inadvertent error of\n                    admitting to their duties as employees and to the breach thereof. 97     I turn next to the plaintiff’s claim for\n                    $225,720. This comprised of $20,000 and $90,000 allegedly received by Justin on\n                    the plaintiff’s behalf, $115,000 allegedly received by the third defendant\n                    on the plaintiff’s behalf and $720 invoiced by the third defendant to Chow\n                    on 15 April 2005 for glass supplied to the NH Glass project which invoice was\n                    signed by Justin. Justin’s evidence (corroborated by Chow) was that he had\n                    to borrow money from Chow ($110,000) to pay the plaintiff’s suppliers and\n                    subcontractors because of Lim’s refusal to sign cheques to make payment.\n                    It is noteworthy that Lim himself testified[note: 38]that he stopped payments to the\n                    plaintiff’s workers, subcontractors and suppliers. At the meeting on\n                    27 June 2005 (see above at [69(h)]), Ronald had announced that the\n                    plaintiff was heavily in debt. It was also in evidence that the plaintiff had\n                    been operating at a loss for the years 2003 to 2005. Lim’s conduct had\n                    caused delay to the NH Glass project. The plaintiff was at risk not only of\n                    having its services terminated but also of having to pay damages for its delay\n                    in completing the project. Justin who was in charge of the project took the\n                    pragmatic approach – he persuaded Chow to terminate the plaintiff’s\n                    contract because Lim did not want to continue with it and it was in delay;\n                    Justin took over the project immediately in the name of the third defendant,\n                    assuming the plaintiff’s liability, in order to complete the same, which\n                    was done in October 2005, well after the plaintiff had ceased\n                operations. 98     On the evidence, the transfer of the NH Glass\n                    to the third defendant was known to and/or authorised by or acquiesced to by\n                    Lim. Yet he had the gall to turn around and sue Justin, the third defendant and\n                    the other defendants for conspiracy and to claim the balance 75% value of the NH\n                    Glass project totalling $225,000 ($300,000 x 75%). To allow the plaintiff to\n                    recover $225,000 and/or $225,720 for work it did not and could not carry out on\n                    the NH Glass project would be to unjustly enrich the plaintiff at the third\n                    defendant’s expense. 99     I disbelieve Lim’s claim that the\n                    plaintiff had expended $124,564.83 in purchasing materials for the NH Glass\n                    project. Rather, I accept Richard’s evidence that not all the materials\n                    were used in the NH Glass project as part thereof went into the SIS project.\n                    Richard also testified that he was unable to ascertain the proportion of\n                    materials used in the two projects because he had handed all the documents over\n                    to the plaintiff. As the plaintiff failed to produce documents to substantiate\n                    its claim that all the materials went into the NH Glass project, I am dismissing\n                    it without more. 100    I would add that Lim’s allegation that\n                    the five individual defendants removed the hard disks from the computer systems\n                    in the plaintiff’s office is a complete fabrication.",
        "Conclusion": "101    In the light of the evidence adduced in\n                    court, I have no hesitation in finding that the plaintiff’s various heads\n                    of claim are completely unmeritorious. I agree with the defendants that the\n                    plaintiff’s action was instituted in bad faith undoubtedly by Lim and/or\n                    Ronald with the motive of denying the plaintiff’s other shareholdersvizJustin and Bob (through his shareholding\n                    in SYEI which is the third shareholder of the plaintiff) of any share in the\n                    sale proceeds of the plaintiff’s premises. To-date, in breach of his\n                    director’s duties, Lim has failed to account for the sale proceeds. There\n                    was no conspiracy between the defendants to cause harm to the plaintiff as\n                    alleged or at all. 102    For added measure, Lim and/or Ronald added\n                    Chow as the seventh defendant to this suit when Chow was an innocent party whose\n                    only fault was to award the NH Glass project to the plaintiff and subsequently\n                    to the third defendant, because he knew that Justin was capable of doing the\n                    work required. 103    Consequently, the plaintiff’s action\n                    is dismissed with costs to all seven defendants to be taxed on a standard basis\n                    unless otherwise agreed.
