        "Introduction": "1       This was an appeal against the decision of the\n                    Judge (“the Judge”) inLee Shieh-Peen Clement\n                        and another v Ho Chin Nguang and others[2010] SGHC 12\n                    which held that the Respondents were not in breach of, or in contempt of, a\n                    Mareva injunction issued against them. At the conclusion of the hearing we\n                    allowed the appeal and held that the Respondents were in breach of the Mareva\n                    injunction. We now give our reasons.",
        "Background": "2       Lee Shieh-Peen Clement and Kong Yew Seng, the\n                    plaintiffs in the main action and the first and second appellants in the appeal\n                    (“the Appellants”), are both businessmen. Ho Chin Nguang\n                    (“Ho”), the first defendant in the main action, is a friend of the\n                    Appellants and is also a businessman. Ng Sow Moi (“Ng”), the\n                    second defendant in the main action, is Ho’s wife, while Ho May Ing\n                    (“May Ing”), the third defendant in the main action, is Ho’s\n                    sister. For the purposes of the appeal, only Ho and Ng were the respondents and\n                    they will hereinafter be referred to collectively as “the\n                    Respondents”. 3       Sometime in May or June 2007, the Appellants\n                    entered into a joint venture (“the Agreement”) with Ho to\n                    incorporate a Chinese company (“the Company”) for the purposes of\n                    taking over a Gold Mining Project in Myanmar (“the first\n                    project”). While the exact oral terms of the Agreement on the first\n                    project were disputed, what was not in dispute was that in pursuance of the\n                    Agreement the Appellants in July/August 2007 issued two cheques for the total\n                    sum of S$4 million to Ho for the purposes of the first project. These cheques\n                    were deposited into a bank account in the name of the Respondents. 4       In March 2008, the second appellant, Kong Yew\n                    Seng, transferred another sum of S$4 million to Ho’s bank account for a\n                    potential joint investment in an iron ore mine in China. The Appellants averred\n                    that this sum of money was initially intended to be a bridging loan which could\n                    be converted into an investment in the purchase of the mine should the due\n                    diligence checks prove worthwhile. This bridging loan was also granted on the\n                    condition that it would be repaid in full to the Appellants in three months from\n                    the date of receipt of the said sum by Ho. However, with regard to this sum, the\n                    Respondents denied that it was intended to be a bridging loan. Instead, they\n                    asserted that the said sum was to all intents and purposes meant as a joint\n                    investment by the Appellants for subsequent investments (“the second\n                    project”) through the Company. 5       Later the Appellants discovered that some of the\n                    representations made by Ho in inducing the Appellants to be involved in the\n                    first project and the bridging loan were false. In September 2008, Ho returned a\n                    total of S$1.61 million to the Appellants. The Appellants also took away three\n                    cars which were registered in Ho’s name, Ho’s UOB bank passbook,\n                    identity card, passport and three of his watches. The Appellants alleged that\n                    all the payments and chattels were handed over to the Appellants by the\n                    Respondents on their own free will. These constituted part repayment of the\n                    monies due and owing by the Respondents to the Appellants with respect to the\n                    bridging loan. On the other hand, the Respondents contended that the Appellants\n                    wanted to back out of the first project and unreasonably demanded for the refund\n                    of S$4 million for the second project. Resorting to threats and harassments, the\n                    Respondents alleged that the Appellants compelled the Respondents to return the\n                    sum of S$1.61 million to them and also took away the abovementioned\n                    items. 6       On 31 March 2009, the Appellants commenced\n                    Suit 285 of 2009, which is the main action against Ho, Ng and May Ing to recover\n                    the sum of S$5.07 million to S$5.1 million. At the same time, the Appellants\n                    also took out anex parteapplication for a Mareva\n                    injunction against all three defendants. On 7 April 2009, the Appellants\n                    successfully obtained anex parteinterim Mareva\n                    injunction against them. Under this order, the defendants were allowed to spend\n                    only S$500 a week for ordinary living expenses and S$500 a week or a reasonable\n                    sum on legal advice. 7       The Appellants later withdrew their claim\n                    against May Ing, and theex parteinterim Mareva\n                    injunction granted on 7 April 2009 was replaced by a final Mareva\n                    injunction on 31 July 2009 (“the Order”) against Ho and Ng,\n                    the Respondents in this appeal. Under the Order, the Respondents were allowed to\n                    spend S$1,500 a week towards their ordinary living expenses and S$1,500 a week\n                    or a reasonable sum on legal advice and representation. The relevant terms of\n                    the Order were: Disposal of assets 1.    (1)   The 1stand\n                                2ndDefendants must not: (a)   remove from Singapore, in any way\n                            dispose of or deal with or diminish the value of their assets which are\n                            in Singapore whether in their own name(s) or not and whether solely or\n                            jointly owned up to the value of SGD$5,100,000; or (b)   in any way dispose of or deal with or\n                                diminish the value of any of their assets whether they are in or\n                                outside Singapore whether in their own name(s) or not and whether\n                                solely or jointly owned up to the same value.

(4)   If the total unencumbered value of the\n                                1stand 2ndDefendants’ assets in Singapore does not exceed SGD $5,100,000.00,\n                            the 1stand 2ndDefendants must not remove any of those assets from Singapore and must\n                            not dispose of or deal with any of them, but if they have other assets\n                            outside Singapore, the 1stand\n                                2ndDefendants may dispose of or deal\n                            with those assets as long as the total unencumbered value of all his\n                            assets whether in or outside Singapore remains not less than SGD\n                            $5,100,000.00.

The 1stand 2ndDefendants shall account to the\n                        Plaintiffs within three (3) weeks for the amount of money spent in this\n                        regard. 8       On 17 November 2009, the Appellants\n                    obtained leave to apply for an order of committal against the Respondents for\n                    their contempt of the orders of court of 7 April 2009 and 31 July 2009\n                    by failing to inform the Appellants’ solicitors in writing within the\n                    requisite time limit or at all of: (a)     the value and details of all their\n                        assets whether in or outside Singapore by way of an affidavit which was to\n                        have been served on the Appellants’ solicitors within seven (7) days\n                        after the orders dated 7 April 2009 and 31 July 2009 had been\n                        served on the Respondents; and (b)     the source of the money to be used before spending the\n                        same in the amount specifically limited by the High Court for the\n                        Respondents’ expenditure on ordinary living and legal\n                    expenses.",
        "The decision of the Judge": "9       On 11 December 2009 the committal\n                    application came before the Judge who held that the Respondents had not breached\n                    cl 2 of the Order (“clause 2” or “cl 2”) with\n                    respect to the disclosure of the Respondents’ assets. In his view,\n                    cl 2 by its express terms only required a one-off disclosure by an\n                    affidavit listing out the assets of the Respondents and that had been done.\n                    Clause 2 did not require the Respondents to file further affidavits to set out\n                    assets which the Respondents might subsequently have acquired. On that basis,\n                    Ho’s subsequent receipt of a monthly cash allowance of IDR 134,819,900\n                    (“the monthly allowance”) from the Indonesian company PT Mega\n                    Fortune (“PT Mega”) for his role as its advisor and Vice Chairman,\n                    after the due submission by the Respondents of the affidavit of assets as\n                    required by cl 2, was not an asset that was required to be disclosed by the\n                    Respondents pursuant to the terms of the Order, in particular\n                cl 2. 10     The Judge also held that cl 1(4) of the\n                    Order by its terms only restricted the disposal or dealing of disclosed assets.\n                    It was concerned with the diminution of the disclosed assets. In his opinion,\n                    the monthly allowance was not by its nature an asset within the contemplation of\n                    the Order, and this was so even if we assumed that there was a continuing\n                    obligation on the part of the Respondents to update and disclose after-acquired\n                    assets. Accordingly, there was no breach arising from Ho’s receipt of the\n                    monthly allowance. 11     Moreover, the Judge was of the view that there\n                    was no breach of the Order by the Respondents’ failure to provide an\n                    estimate of the values of their shares in various companies. In light of the\n                    fact that the shares were of private companies in multiple jurisdictions, the\n                    Judge thought that no additional commercial purposes could be served by\n                    requiring the Respondents to provide an estimate of the shares when the\n                    Appellants had been given the relevant financial statements and were able to\n                    arrive at their own conclusion as to the valuation of those assets. The Judge\n                    was of the opinion that to require the Respondents to take the further step of\n                    procuring independent valuations of unlisted companies would be unduly onerous\n                    considering the interlocutory nature and the purpose of a Mareva\n                    injunction. 12     As regards cl 3 of the Order (“cl\n                    3”), the Judge found that the Respondents were not in breach of that\n                    clause when they failed to declare the sources of the funds from which they had\n                    utilised to spend on their ordinary living and legal expenses. The Judge noted\n                    Ho’s explanation in his affidavit that the funds in question were the\n                    monthly cash allowances received by him subsequent to the filing of his\n                    affidavit of assets on account of his role as advisor and Vice Chairman of PT\n                    Mega. Moreover, given that Ho’s interest in PT Mega had been duly\n                    disclosed in his affidavit of assets, and he had not drawn on or dissipated the\n                    bank accounts and assets disclosed in his affidavit of assets, the Judge said it\n                    would be a stretch to conclude that Ho was to be subject to committal\n                    proceedings by virtue of having received subsequent advances or gifts which had\n                    already been determined (see[10]above) not\n                    to constitute assets for the purposes of the Order. 13     In the premises, the Judge found that there\n                    was no breach of the Order on the part of the Respondents. Therefore, the\n                    Appellants’ application to commit the Respondents was\n                denied.",
        "Issues arising in this appeal": "14     On the submissions of the parties, there were\n                    five main issues which arose in the appeal, namely: (a)     Whether the monthly allowance\n                        received by Ho constituted an asset for the purposes of the\n                    Order; (b)     Whether the\n                        Order operates only to restrict the disposal or dealing of disclosed\n                        assets; (c)     Whether\n                        the Respondents disclosed sufficient details of their assets with respect to\n                        cl 2; (d)     Whether the Respondents breached cll 3 and 4 in not informing the\n                        Appellants about the monthly allowance from PT Mega before using it on their\n                        monthly expenditure; and (e)     Whether an order of committal was an appropriate sanction\n                        for the breach or breaches of the Order. We will now\n                    address each of these issues in turn.",
        "General approach": "15     Before addressing these arguments, we must\n                    emphasize the paramount importance of respecting and obeying orders of court.\n                    The proper administration of justice proceeds on the basis that orders of court\n                    would and should be observed. At the core of this principle of obeying court\n                    orders is the public interest in the administration of justice, including the\n                    dispatch of litigation as expeditiously as justice in the case requires. No\n                    party should be allowed to disregard orders of court. As Yong Pung How CJ\n                    put it inRe Tan Khee Eng John[1997] 1 SLR(R) 870 at [14]: We are inviting anarchy in our legal system if we allow\n                            lawyers or litigants to pick and choose which orders of court they will\n                            comply with, or to dictate to the court how and when\n                        proceedings should be conducted. [emphasis added] 16     It is within the purview of the courts to\n                    ensure that its orders are not contravened or thwarted (seePertamina Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC and others[2007] 2 SLR(R) 518). Accordingly, a court will not hesitate to punish\n                    any lawyer or litigant who fails to obey its orders or who seeks to undermine\n                    the effectiveness of its orders. The courts will jealously guard against any\n                    interference by any party which would disturb the proper administration of\n                    justice(see Jasa Keramat Sdn Bhd v Monatech (M) Sdn\n                        Bhd[2001] 4 MLJ 577 at 592C-G). 17     The Order which this appeal was concerned with\n                    was a Mareva injunction. The object of such an interlocutory order is to prevent\n                    a defendant from dissipating his assets and thus rendering nugatory a judgment\n                    which might eventually be obtained by the plaintiff against him, when the assets\n                    would otherwise have been available to satisfy the judgment. Therefore, the\n                    Mareva injunction is an important weapon in the arsenal of the court in dealing\n                    with such a situation. In this regard, we must stress that the party against\n                    whom a Mareva injunction is issued must obeyboththe letter and the spirit of the order (seePan-United Marine\n                        Ltd v Chief Assessor[2008] 3 SLR(R) 569 at [42] where\n                    the Court of Appeal emphasized the importance of looking at both the letter and\n                    the spirit of the law in a different context). If there is any real uncertainty\n                    as to the scope of an order the proper thing for a party to do is to seek the\n                    assistance of the court or, at the very least, inform the other party of the act\n                    that is intended to be carried out. Deliberate concealment or what seems like\n                    clever manoeuvres to get round a Mareva injunction will be dealt with\n                    accordingly.",
        "Was the monthly allowance received by Ho from PT Mega an asset within\n                the scope of the Order?": "18     The Appellants argued that the Judge erred in\n                    holding that Ho’s subsequent receipt of the monthly allowance after the\n                    due submission of the affidavit of assets did not by its nature constitute an\n                    asset for the purposes of the Order. In support of this argument, the Appellants\n                    cited the case ofOCM Opportunities Fund II, LP and others v\n                        Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and others[2004]\n                    4 SLR(R) 74 (“OCM Opportunities\n                        Fund”), where Belinda Ang Saw Ean J opined at [57]\n                    that: The Mareva jurisdiction extends to all assets, whether tangible assets or\n                        mere choses in action, provided that the defendant is the legal or\n                        beneficial owner of them: seeThe Practice and Procedure\n                            of the Commercial Court(5th Ed, 2000) at 138.Salary, like fees and commission, is a chose in action and is\n                            capable of being caught by an injunction. A monthly salary\n                        that is paid into a bank account is caught by an injunction as and when it\n                        is paid into the account. [emphasis added] 19     In contrast, the Respondents argued that the\n                    monthly allowance was not an asset for the purposes of the Order. Counsel for\n                    the Respondents highlighted the fact that he did not hold the legal title to his\n                    shareholding in PT Mega. Legal title was held by a proxy. Thus, it was a\n                    relationship of trust and his receipt of the monthly allowance was dependent\n                    upon him keeping his business counterparts happy. Moreover, Ho also claimed that\n                    a substantial part of the monthly allowance was spent on paying for the expenses\n                    of Ho’s business counterparts, their families and relations each time they\n                    visited Singapore from Indonesia and China. 20     The Respondents also pointed out that an asset\n                    was defined as a resource owned by a person which has a present or future\n                    economic value that can be realised. Implicit in that definition was the element\n                    of certainty that the economic value is owned and could be realised or enforced.\n                    The resource in question should not be gratuitous or dependent upon the goodwill\n                    of others. Following from this argument, the Respondents further argued thatOCM Opportunities Fundwas clearly\n                    distinguishable from the present case because the monthly allowance received by\n                    Ho was not a chose in action as it did not possess the element of contractual\n                    certainty like that of a salary, fee, commission or a debt owed by PT Mega to\n                    Ho. Instead, his entitlement to the monthly allowance was dependent on trust and\n                    the continual maintenance of good relationships between Ho and his Indonesian\n                    counterparts. 21     We were unable to accept this argument of the\n                    Respondent which had no basis in reality. Although Ho held his title to his\n                    shareholding in PT Mega by proxy, that shareholding was no less his. Ho had\n                    declared in his affidavit that the shareholding in PT Mega was an asset of his.\n                    It was disingenuous of him to assert that just because the legal title to the\n                    shareholding was held by a proxy that the shareholding did not belong to him.\n                    Through his proxy Ho was holding 90% of the shares in PT Mega which appeared to\n                    own assets of approximately US$13 million.[note: 1]Ho was the beneficial owner of that\n                    portion of the shareholding in PT Mega. To all intents and purposes, Ho was in\n                    complete control of PT Mega. Equally important, we also noted that there was no\n                    evidence that his proxy had not been acting in the affairs of the company in\n                    accordance with his instructions. Indeed, the fact that Ho was holding the\n                    important positions of company advisor and Vice Chairman was indeed telling. As\n                    his beneficial interest in the 90% shareholding in PT Mega had been declared to\n                    be an asset of his, it must necessarily follow that whatever payments made by PT\n                    Mega to him, under whatever guise or label, must also be caught by the Order. If\n                    this were not to be the case, there would be such a wide gaping hole which would\n                    render completely ineffective a Mareva injunction. In the circumstances, it was\n                    entirely lame for Ho to assert that his receipt of the monthly allowance was\n                    dependent purely on trust and the continual maintenance of good relationships\n                    between him and his Indonesian counterparts. 22     As regards the Respondents’ contention\n                    that a substantial part of the monthly allowance received by Ho was spent on\n                    paying for the expenses of Ho’s business counterparts, their families and\n                    relations each time they visited Singapore, this was nothing more than a bareex-post factoassertion without any shred of\n                    objective evidence in support. There was nothing to indicate how much of the\n                    monthly allowance was in fact (if at all) utilised for such expenses. Indeed, Ho\n                    had admitted that he could not produce any acknowledgment, invoice or payment\n                    voucher to support those expenditures, notwithstanding his claims that his\n                    Indonesian business counterparts and their family members visited Singapore very\n                    frequently either to shop or to seek medical treatment, while his Chinese\n                    business counterparts dropped by once or twice a year and spent more on meals\n                    and entertainment.[note: 2] 23     Accordingly, we found that the monthly\n                    allowance received by Ho was not a gift or an advance, but a payment he was\n                    entitled to on account of his being thede factoowner of 90% of PT Mega. It was therefore an asset which came within the scope\n                    of the Order.",
        "Whether the Order applied to the disposal or dealing of\n                after-acquired assets": "24     It was not disputed that the\n                    Respondents’ disclosed assets were not sufficient to meet the amount\n                    injuncted by the Order, and the monthly allowance was an asset which was\n                    acquired by Ho after the making of the affidavit of assets. The\n                    Appellants’ case was that the Order operated to restrict the\n                    Respondents’ disposal of all assets up to the value of S$5.1 million,\n                    regardless of whether the assets up to this value were disclosed by the\n                    Respondents or otherwise. Given that the Respondents’ disclosed assets\n                    were insufficient to meet the amount injuncted under the Order, the monthly\n                    allowance received by Ho, though received after he had filed his affidavit of\n                    assets must likewise be caught by the Order. 25     The Appellants further argued that it defied\n                    logic and the very purpose of a Mareva injunction to limit its scope to only\n                    disclosed assets. To take the view that a Mareva injunction is limited in its\n                    scope to only disclosed assets would seriously undermine the object of a Mareva\n                    injunction as it would mean that the defendant could freely use his newly\n                    acquired assets as he pleases when he has yet to meet the amount injuncted in\n                    the Order. Furthermore, such a narrow view of the Order would not only encourage\n                    stealth and subterfuge, but also substantially emasculate the\n                Order. 26     To address this issue it would be necessary to\n                    start from first principles. The undoubted object of the Mareva injunction is to\n                    prevent the course of justice from being frustrated by a defendant’s\n                    actions which would have the effect of rendering nugatory or less effective any\n                    judgment or order which the plaintiff may thereafter obtain against the\n                    defendant. InCommissioners of Customs and Excise v Barclays\n                        Bank[2006] 3 WLR 1, Lord Bingham said at [10]: It is very well established that the purpose of a freezing injunction is\n                        to restrain a defendant or prospective defendant from disposing of or\n                        dealing with assets so as to defeat, wholly or in part, a likely judgment\n                        against it. The purpose is not to give a claimant security for his claim or\n                        give him any proprietary interest in the assets restrained: Gangway Ltd v\n                        Caledonian Park Investments (Jersey) Ltd [2001] 2 Lloyd’s\n                        Rep 715 , para 14, per Colman J. The ownership of the assets\n                        does not change. All that changes is the right to deal with them. See alsoPolly Peck International plc v Nadir and\n                        others(No 2) [1992]\n                    4 All ER 769 at 785. 27     The position is restated by Mark S W\n                    Hoyle,Freezing and Search Orders(London:\n                    Informa, 4thEd, 2006) as follows at\n                    para 1.18: The single most effective reason for granting a Mareva injunction was, in\n                        practical terms, encompassed within the need to prevent a defendant snapping\n                        his fingers at a judgment of the court with financial impunity, because he\n                        had arranged his affairs so as to leave no worthwhile assets within the\n                        reach of the plaintiff judgment creditor [per Lord Denning MR inPertamina[1978] 1QB 644 at p. 661,\n                        referring to the words of Kerr J]. The material provisions on the financial limit of the Order were set\n                    out in cll 1(1) and 1(4) (see[7]above). 28     The combined effect of these two provisions\n                    was to injunct the amount of S$5.1 million. They did not say that the Order\n                    would only apply to assets declared by the Respondent in his affidavit. The all\n                    important thing which the Order sought to achieve was to secure for the\n                    Appellants the sum of up to S$5.1 million. To read the Order as having been\n                    “frozen” as at the date of the making of the affidavit would very\n                    seriously emasculate it. As the Appellant so rightly pointed out, to construe\n                    the Order so narrowly would encourage stealth and subterfuge and in turn\n                    engender controversies as to the origin of particular assets. We would\n                    illustrate the problems a narrow interpretation of such an Order would cause as\n                    follows. Let’s say that shortly after the making of the affidavit of\n                    assets the defendants have by a stroke of luck acquired new assets. On this\n                    view, the defendants would be free to spend their new funds and the only way for\n                    the plaintiff to stop this would be for him to apply for a fresh order. To\n                    require the plaintiff to re-apply for a fresh order, he must have some basis to\n                    allege that he suspects that the defendants have acquired new assets. If the\n                    defendants do not disclose that they have new funds, and certainly on this\n                    narrow view of such an Order Ho is not obliged to do so, the plaintiff will\n                    remain in the dark and he would not have any basis to apply for a fresh order.\n                    In any event to require the plaintiff to make a fresh application whenever he\n                    suspects the defendants to be in possession of new funds would be too cumbersome\n                    and would seriously undermine the utility of the Mareva\n                injunction. 29     In our opinion, contrary to the view of the\n                    Judge, there was nothing in cl 1(4) which suggested that the Order only\n                    applied to disclosed assets. Suppose a defendant deliberately refuses to\n                    disclose an asset, what then is the position of that asset? Would it then become\n                    an undisclosed asset and not be subject to the Order? This would be ridiculous.\n                    It was clear on a plain reading of cl 1(4) that the Respondents could\n                    dispose of or deal with their assets outside Singapore even when they have\n                    inadequate assets in Singapore to meet the Appellants’ claim as long as\n                    the total unencumbered value of their assetsin and outside\n                        of Singaporewere above the stipulated sum of S$5.1 million. The\n                    purpose of cl 1(4) was to underscore the fact that the Order was only to\n                    attach up to the sum of S$5.1 million and nothing more and it in no way sought\n                    to derogate from cl 1(1). 30     The approach taken by the Judge is untenable\n                    from another angle. It cannot be doubted that cl 1(4) operated from the\n                    moment the Order was granted (seeZ Ltd v A-Z and\n                        AA-LL[1982] 1 QB 558 at 572) and the Respondents had\n                    to comply with it upon being served. The Judge’s interpretation of\n                    cl 1(4) that it applies only to restrict the disposal or dealing of\n                    disclosed assets would lead to the illogical conclusion that the Order did not\n                    freeze any assets at all until the Respondents disclosed their assets in an\n                    affidavit. Such an interpretation would again render the Order nugatory.\n                    Moreover, it would be contrary to the very purpose of a Mareva injunction to\n                    limit the scope of such an injunction to disclosed assets which did not exceed\n                    the amount provided for in the injunction, as it would make it meaningless for\n                    the quantum of such an injunction to be specified since the injunction would\n                    allow for the Respondents to diminish their total assets by using after-acquired\n                    assets or monies without due regard to their liabilities under the\n                    injunction. 31     Finally we would add that we are fortified in\n                    our view by the decision inTDK Tape Distributor (UK) Ltd v\n                        Videochoice Ltd and Others[1986] 1 WLR 141\n                        (“TDK Tape”), where it was held\n                    that a Mareva injunction would encompass assets acquired after the date the\n                    injunction was granted. InTDK Tape, the\n                    defendants’ solicitors applied the proceeds of an insurance policy which\n                    had matured upon the death of the defendant’s wife towards the settlement\n                    of their outstanding fees, after the grant of the Mareva injunction.\n                    Skinner J held that the policy was in existence at the time the defendant\n                    disclosed his assets by affidavit, and it was not an after-acquired asset.\n                    Equally significant is that Skinner J opined that even if the policy had\n                    been an after-acquired asset, it would still have been caught by the injunction\n                    (at 145): It seems to me that it would be a negation of the purpose of that\n                        injunction if, every time the defendant acquired some new asset or property,\n                        it was up to the plaintiffs to discover that and make an application to the\n                        court that the existing injunction be extended to deal with it. It seems to\n                        me thata Mareva injunction is looking to the future and\n                            is dealing with the situation between the obtaining of the judgment and\n                            its eventual execution, and it will cover any assets which are acquired\n                            between the granting of the order and the eventual execution of any\n                            judgment obtained in the action in question.

The view on this\n                        matter expressed obiter by Skinner J in T.D.K. Tape Distributor (U.K.)\n                        Ltd. v Videochoice Ltd. [1986] 1 W.L.R. 141 at 145B-D reflects the\n                        assumption which has consistently been adopted in this court. Skinner J’s reasoning inTDK\n                        Tapehas also been adopted in other jurisdictions (see the\n                    Malaysian case ofYukilon Manufacturing Sdn Bhd & Anor v\n                        Dato ‘ Wong Gek Ming & Ors(No 4) [1998]\n                    7 MLJ 551 and the Hong Kong case ofSave Power\n                        Limited v Arthur Tse Lup Kee[1995] HKEC 353).",
        "Did the Respondents breach cll 3 and 4 of the Order in not informing\n                the Appellants about the monthly allowance before using it on their monthly\n                expenditure?": "33     The Appellants argued that the Judge erred in\n                    finding that the Respondents did not breach the Order when the Respondents\n                    failed to declare the source of their funds before spending the same on their\n                    monthly expenses. It seemed to us clear that the Judge had come to this view\n                    primarily because he thought that the monthly allowance was not an asset within\n                    the scope of the Order and that in spending the monthly allowance the\n                    Respondents were therefore not required to make any declaration as to its source\n                    pursuant to cl 3 of the Order. To repeat, what cl 3 demanded was that\n                    the Respondents should not spend beyond the prescribed limits in respect of\n                    their ordinary living expenses and legal fees and should further, before\n                    spending any money on the aforesaid purposes inform the Appellants’\n                    solicitors where the money was to come from (see cl 3 set out above at[7]). 34     It was not disputed that Ho spent about\n                    S$16,115.27 to S$19,615.27 per month between June and November 2009 and that\n                    these sums exceeded the spending limits imposed on the Respondents by cl 3.\n                    In addition, Ho had failed to inform the Appellants’ solicitors as to the\n                    source of the fund from which the expenditures would be taken.Prima facie, the Respondents had breached both aspects\n                    of the obligation under cl 3. However, the Judge agreed with the\n                    Respondents, holding that there was no breach of the Order because Ho’s\n                    interest in PT Mega had been duly disclosed in his affidavit of assets, and he\n                    had not drawn on or dissipated the bank accounts and assets that he had\n                    disclosed. It was clear that the Judge had arrived at this decision based on his\n                    perception that the monthly allowance was a subsequent advance or gift which did\n                    not constitute an asset for the purposes of the Order. However, if this were to\n                    be the correct view of the monthly allowance, then even if Ho had started to\n                    receive it before the grant of theex parteMareva\n                    injunction, the Respondents could argue that every payment so received was a\n                    gift, and thus was not caught by the Order. The fact that the monthly allowance\n                    was received by Ho after the grant of the Mareva injunction would not have made\n                    a difference. 35     As we have ruled in[23]above that the monthly allowance constituted an asset for\n                    the purposes of the Order even though it was a payment received after the\n                    Respondents had filed their affidavit of assets, we therefore held that the\n                    Judge was in error in holding that the Respondents had not breached cl 3.\n                    In fact the Respondents had admitted that they had breached cl 3 in not\n                    accounting for their weekly expenditures. They said:[note: 3] ...[w]e [the Respondents] had inadvertently failed to account to the\n                        Plaintiffs [the Appellants] under the 2ndInjunction Order dated 31stJuly 2009 and I wish\n                        to apologise for our failure. 36     Indeed, we would further hold that the\n                    Respondents, in spending the sums in excess of what was permitted under\n                    cl 3 had also committed a breach of that part of the Order. In passing, we\n                    would mention that the Respondents made the argument that they should not be\n                    compelled to reduce their ordinary standard of living with a view to putting by\n                    sums to satisfy a judgment which may or may not be given in the future. This\n                    argument is wholly without merit. Once a Mareva injunction is made against a\n                    defendant and the assets which he discloses do not satisfy the sum to be\n                    injuncted, the defendant would no longer have the liberty to spend his money as\n                    he pleases. He is subject to the restrictions placed by the court. 37     Lastly, before we move to the next issue we\n                    wish to add that we did not think that the Respondents had breached\n                    cl 4.This was because that clause concerned the Respondents’ dealing\n                    or disposing of their assets in the ordinary course of business. We were here\n                    concerned only with the expenditures incurred by the Respondents on living\n                    expenses and legal fees, and not how they dealt with their assets in the course\n                    of business. Thus there could not have been a breach of cl 4 because it was\n                    inapplicable.",
        "Have the Respondents disclosed sufficient details of their assets\n                pursuant to cl 2 of the Order?": "38     On this issue, the Appellants submitted that\n                    the Judge erred in finding that there was no breach of cl 2 despite the\n                    Respondents’ failure to provide the value and details of the assets\n                    comprising their disclosed shareholdings in a number of private companies\n                    (“the Private Companies”). The Appellants accepted that the\n                    Respondents had provided some financial statements relating to the Private\n                    Companies, but argued that the veracity of these statements was doubtful. The\n                    Appellants also disputed the Judge’s finding that they had conceded that\n                    the Respondents had provided them with the latest available financial statements\n                    of the Private Companies. They further argued that the Judge was wrong to find\n                    that there was no additional commercial purpose in getting the Respondents to\n                    provide their estimate of the value of their shareholdings in the Private\n                    Companies because it was the Respondents’ duty to do so under the Order\n                    and that case law required that the Respondents disclose at least the net asset\n                    value of their shares in the Private Companies. 39     We agreed with the Appellants that they had\n                    not conceded that the Respondents had provided them with the latest available\n                    financial statements relating to the Private Companies. Instead, the Appellants\n                    only acknowledged that they had received documents from the Respondents which\n                    were relevant to the Private Companies but that those documents did not provide\n                    an estimate of the market values of the shares of the Private\n                Companies. 40     However, what was more problematic was the\n                    Appellants’ assertion that the onus was on the Respondents to provide to\n                    the Appellants an estimate of the values of their shareholdings in the Private\n                    Companies. In support of this argument, the Appellants citedOCM Opportunities Fundat [41] which held that: ...To that extent,in the case of shares in private\n                            companies, there is normally no difficulty disclosing the value on a\n                            simple net asset basis, as this can be determined from the\n                        accounts of the company concerned. A disclosure of the par value of the\n                        shares, as some of the majority defendants had done, is not adequate. [emphasis added] 41     We would emphasise that these views expressed\n                    inOCM Opportunities Fundshould be construed in\n                    their proper context. In that case, where the plaintiff was granted leave to\n                    cross-examine the defendants on their affidavits of assets on the ground that\n                    the information furnished was incomplete and lacking in particulars, the court\n                    in addressing the law, approved the general proposition that a defendant was not\n                    required to incur any expenses in order to obtain a valuation of his assets.\n                    Instead, the defendant was only obliged to disclose the value of his assets to\n                    the best of his ability. The court then stated thatmerely\n                        disclosing the par valueof the shares in private companies was\n                    inadequate because there was usually no difficulty in disclosing the value of a\n                    share in a company on a simple net asset basis based on the accounts of the\n                    company. 42     In the present case, there was clear\n                    difficulty for the Respondents to disclose the value of the shares in each of\n                    the Private Companies. As the Judge rightly pointed out, these shares in\n                    question related to several private companies in multiple jurisdictions. While\n                    the parties were in dispute as to which documents the Respondents had furnished\n                    to the Appellants in relation to the Private Companies, the fact of the matter\n                    was that the Respondent did supply the Appellants with the relevant financial\n                    statements of the Private Companies. 43     We agreed with the Judge that based on the\n                    financial statements provided by the Respondents, the Appellants should and were\n                    in fact able to arrive at their own conclusion as to the valuation of the shares\n                    in question. To require the Respondents to take the further step of procuring\n                    independent valuations of unlisted private companies would be unduly onerous\n                    considering the interlocutory nature and the purposes of a Mareva injunction.\n                    Accordingly, we found that the Respondents had disclosed sufficient details of\n                    their assets pursuant to cl 2.",
        "Whether an order of committal is appropriate for the breaches\n                committed by the Respondents": "44     The power to punish for contempt summarily is\n                    intended to enable the court to deal with conduct which would adversely affect\n                    the administration of justice. It is necessary to maintain the dignity and\n                    authority of the court and to ensure a fair trial (seeSummit\n                        Holdings Ltd and another v Business Software Alliance[1999]\n                    2 SLR(R) 592 at [19]). 45     The relevant principles pertaining to an order\n                    of committal are stated inSingapore Court Practice\n                        2009(Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed)(LexisNexis, 2009)\n                        (“Pinsler”) at para 52/1/2\n                    as follows: ... As a general principle, the judgment creditor is expected to use\n                        alternative enforcement methods before contemplating committal. Even if\n                        those methods have been engaged without success, the court will not commit\n                        the judgment debtor unless there is credible evidence that the\n                        debtor’s non-compliance was wilful in the sense that he refused or\n                        neglected to pay in spite of his ability to do so (Khoo Wai Leong,\n                        Ronnie v Andrew J Hanam [2003] SGMC 41, para 35;\n                        … The other purpose of the order is to punish the offender for his contempt\n                        (Re Barrell Enterprises [1973] 1 WLR 19). … Committal to prison is normally a measure of last resort. Other options\n                        are available to the court, and often the exercise of its discretion will be\n                        based on the attitude of the offender. If he is apologetic and promises to\n                        comply with the court order (or if he has already complied with it since the\n                        service on him of the notice of motion for committal), the court may merely\n                        reprimand him in strong terms. If he has yet to comply with the order, the\n                        court may warn him that unless he does so he will be imprisoned. Further, para 52/2/1 ofPinslerreads: The importance of these requirements was recently emphasized by KC\n                        Vohrah J in Syarikat M Mohamed v Mahindapal Singh [1991]\n                        2 MLJ 112, at 114: ‘… since committal proceedings are\n                        quasi-criminal proceedings and the liberty of the subject is involved, the\n                        procedural rules applicable must be strictly enforced.’ The point is\n                        that the person against whom the committal proceedings are brought\n                        ‘needs to know with particularity what charge or charges they are\n                        faced with, charges which can land them in prison’ (at 115). The\n                        learned judge ruled that as it is the specific purpose of the statement to\n                        include these grounds, any omission to do so cannot be made good by setting\n                        them out in the affidavit, the purpose of which is to merely verify the\n                        statement. … (See Cartier International BV v Lee Hock Lee [1993]\n                        1 SLR 616 in which the High Court reiterated these\n                        requirements.) 46     InP J Holdings Inc v\n                        Ariel Singapore Pte Ltd[2009] 3 SLR(R) 582 at [7],\n                    Choo Han Teck J stated: ...Order 45 r 5 (1)(a) applies only when “a person required by a judgment or\n                        order to do an act within a time specified in the judgment or orderrefuses or neglectsto do it.”\n                        [emphasis added] … InRe Quintin Dick[1926] Ch 992, Romer J held that the term “refuse or\n                        neglect” was not equivalent to “fail or omit”, and that\n                        the former implied a conscious act of volition whereas the latter did not.\n                        InNg Tai Tuan v Chng Gim Huat Pte Ltd[1990] 2 SLR(R) 231, Chao Hick Tin JC (as he then was)\n                        expressed the view that the word “neglect” necessarily implies\n                        some element of fault. He cited the case ofIn re London\n                            and Paris Banking Corporation(1874) LR 19 Eq 444\n                        where Sir G Jessel MR said, at p 446: … the word ‘neglected’ is not necessarily\n                            equivalent to the word ‘omitted’. Negligence is a term which\n                            is well known in law. Negligence in paying a debt on demand, as I\n                            understand, is omitting to pay without reasonable excuse. Mere omission\n                            by itself does not amount to negligence. ... The word “refuse” has also been similarly defined. InDP Vijandran v Majlis Peguam[1995]\n                        2 MLJ 391 , the court noted that “[t]he ordinary\n                        meaning of the word refuse is to decline to give”, and that\n                        “failure is not synonymous with refusal” Similar sentiments\n                        were also expressed by the tribunal inLowson v Percy\n                            Main & District Social Club & Institute Ltd[1979] ICR 568. I agree with the foregoing cases. … 47     With respect to the question as to the proper\n                    sanction to be imposed by this court, we had borne in mind the following\n                    circumstances. First, the case of the Respondents was that the breaches which\n                    they had committed were due to their failure to appreciate that the monthly\n                    allowance constituted an asset under the Order. The Respondents had assumed that\n                    since they had already disclosed all their assets in their affidavit of assets,\n                    including Ho’s shareholding in PT Mega, Ho’s subsequent receipt of\n                    the monthly allowance after the filing of the affidavit of assets would not\n                    constitute an asset for the purposes of the Order. Hence the Respondents felt\n                    they were free to spend the monthly allowance on their monthly expenditures\n                    without informing the Appellants. Second, they claimed that this erroneous\n                    assumption in their minds was contributed by the fact that the Appellants,\n                    though aware that the Respondents had not written to them to account for their\n                    monthly expenditures since the first injunction Order was served on the\n                    Respondents on 7 April 2009, did not complain about this omission until\n                    some six months later on 11 September 2009. The Respondents explained their\n                    mental thoughts as follows[note: 4]: If the Defendants [Respondents] were aware that this cash allowance should\n                        be disclosed and accounted for, they would have done so. After all, the\n                            1stDefendant’s [Ho’s] interest\n                        in PT Mega Fortune has been honestly disclosed. There is also nothing to\n                        hide as the Defendant’s [Ho’s] cash allowance is used for the\n                        Defendants’ [Respondents’] monthly expenses of S$16,115.27\n                        – S$19,615.27 which are all entirely proper and reasonable. 48     However, it was clear to us that the\n                    Respondents were less than candid about their interests in PT Mega, especially\n                    with regard to the details on the monthly allowance. Even though Ho holds an\n                    overwhelming 90% of the shareholding in PT Mega and therefore has complete\n                    control over the company which had assets totalling approximately US$13 million,\n                    the Respondents had not provided any relevant documents to show how the monthly\n                    allowance was arrived at. Moreover, no documents were adduced to confirm\n                    Ho’s assertion that he only received the monthly allowance subsequent to\n                    the Respondents having filed the affidavit of assets or that this was the only\n                    payment he received from PT Mega. Accordingly, we were unable to accept the\n                    Respondents’ claim that the breaches arose out of their non-appreciation\n                    of the scope of the Order. 49     However, we did not, in any event, feel that\n                    this was a case which we needed to commit the Respondents, particularly Ho, to\n                    prison. As mentioned inPinsler(see[45]above) committal to prison should normally be\n                    a measure of last resort. The advantage which the Respondents had obtained in\n                    breaching the Order was to have more money to spend. In this instance, we felt\n                    that a financial sanction would be sufficient. In our opinion, an appropriate\n                    order to make was to require the Respondents to restore S$200,000 into their\n                    Singapore account within seven days, with proof of such restoration to be\n                    furnished to the Appellants’ solicitors. This sum was computed based on\n                    the monthly amounts which the Respondents had spent in excess of the limit laid\n                    down in the two Mareva injunctions over the period of the breach. Furthermore,\n                    in order to impress upon the Respondents the utmost importance of complying with\n                    an injunction, and that they should not resort to unilateral interpretations\n                    favouring themselves, we ordered that the costs for this appeal be awarded to\n                    the Appellants on an indemnity basis. That should suffice to register the\n                    court’s disapproval of their conduct.",
        "Conclusion": "50     For the reasons above, we allowed the appeal\n                    with the usual consequential orders, and with the Appellants being entitled to\n                    costs on the indemnity basis here and costs on the standard basis\n                below.
