        "The facts": "2\n\n        The appellants were the lawful holders of two\n\nbills of lading, No. 01/PRT/PL/VII/01 and No. 02/PRT/PL/VII/01, dated 13 July 2001. The\n\nbills related to the carriage of a cargo of cocoa beans of a total weight of 609 m/t on\n\nboard the vessel \"PRATIWI\" from Palu, Indonesia to Pasir Gudang, Johore. The\n\nappellants were the buyers of the cargo. The defendant-respondents were the owners of the\n\nvessel \"PRATIWI\".3\n\n        Foong Sun Shipping (Pte) Ltd (Foong Sun) were\n\nthe respondents’ agents and managers of the vessel. The bills of lading for this\n\ncargo were in Foong Sun’s standard form. The appellants had business dealings with\n\nFoong Sun from early 2001.4\n\n        On 17 July 2001 a fire occurred on board the\n\nvessel. It started at the engine room. After the fire was put out, the vessel was towed to\n\nBanjarmasin, Indonesia. The fire so badly damaged the vessel that eventually it was\n\ndeclared a constructive total loss and had to be sold for scrap for only S$50,000. No\n\ninsurance had been taken out in respect of its hull and machinery though there was a\n\npolicy with China Insurance for third party liability for up to $500,000.5\n\n        The cargo of cocoa beans was then transferred\n\nto another vessel \"SUN RAY\" which carried it to Pasir Gudang. Unfortunately, the\n\ncargo was found on arrival to have also been damaged by the fire. It was eventually\n\ndisposed of in a salvage sale, causing the appellants a loss that was subsequently\n\nquantified at $904,164.22. In October 2001, the appellants had made a claim against the\n\nrespondents for the loss, without stating a specific sum. On 31 October 2001, the\n\nrespondents denied liability.6\n\n        The appellants had insured the cargo with\n\nMalaysian Assurance Alliance Bhd (MAA). The appellants notified Foong Sun that they would\n\nbe submitting their claim for the loss to MAA. But on 10 April 2002, MAA informed the\n\nappellants that MAA would be repudiating liability because there was a breach of the\n\npolicy. The appellants informed Foong Sun of this development and thereafter, the\n\nappellants’ Finance and Trading Manager, Mr Hia Cheng, discussed the situation with\n\nthe Manager of Foong Sun, Ms Elaine Quek. Both expressed a wish to resolve the matter\n\namicably.7\n\n        On 16 May 2002 the appellants’ solicitors\n\nmade a claim of RM1,948,253 against China Insurance under their third party policy issued\n\nto the respondents. This communication was copied to Foong Sun.8\n\n        On 18 June 2002, China Insurance denied\n\nliability through its solicitors, M/s Kenneth Tan Partnership (KTP), on the ground that\n\nthe fire started without the fault of the owners. On the same day, the appellants’\n\nsolicitors directed the claim of the appellants to the respondents. The appellants also\n\nasked Foong Sun’s solicitors, KTP, for details of the owners of the PRATIWI,\n\nincluding its country of incorporation, registered address and assets. The details were\n\nnot furnished.9\n\n        The appellants instituted this action on 12\n\nJuly 2002. Their claim was based on breach of contract and, in the alternative, on\n\nnegligence. At the time, the searches carried out by the appellants indicated that the\n\n\"PRATIWI\" was owned by the respondents who had the same address as Foong Sun did\n\nand that the vessel’s previous name was \"TAKATORI\". Neither the\n\nrespondents, nor Foong Sun, informed the appellants that the respondents also owned\n\nanother vessel, the \"LANGSA\".10\n\n        In the meantime, on 22 June 2002, unbeknown to\n\nthe appellants, the respondents had sold the \"LANGSA\". On 17 July 2002 the\n\nappellants learned, from discreet enquiries with the staff of Foong Sun, that the\n\n\"LANGSA\" had changed her name to \"SRI BAHARI\". However, subsequent\n\nsearches on the \"SRI BAHARI\" carried out by Lloyds’ Marine Intelligence\n\nUnit in England, Harper Wira Insurance Surveyors & Adjusters in Malaysia and Seabird\n\nConsultants of Singapore, on behalf of the appellants did not bring forth consistent\n\nresults. Harper Wira reported that the vessel’s owner was Foong Sun, whereas Seabird\n\nConsultants learned that it was PT Pelayaran Fajar Sribahari SAK. Furthermore, both\n\nSeabird Consultants and Lloyds Marine Intelligence Unit could not confirm whether the\n\n\"LANGSA\" had changed its name to \"SRI BAHARI\"11\n\n        On 26 July 2002 the appellants’ solicitors\n\nwrote to the respondents’ solicitors, KTP, seeking confirmation that the respondents\n\nwere still trading. There was no response.12\n\n        On 29 July 2002, the appellants sought a\n\nworld-wide Mareva injunction against the assets of the respondents, including the LANGSA\n\nand the sale proceeds of the \"PRATIWI\". The application came before the\n\njudge-in-chambers on 2 August 2002 who refused it. Thereafter, the appellants asked for\n\nfurther arguments and confined their application to only the vessel \"LANGSA\" or\n\nits proceeds. On 8 August 2002, the judge certified that she would not require further\n\narguments.13\n\n        In the court below, the respondents raised only\n\none ground to resist the application, i.e., that the appellants had not shown that there\n\nwas any real risk of dissipation of assets. The judge held that there was no \"solid\n\nevidence\" of any risk of dissipation to satisfy the court that a Mareva injunction\n\nshould be granted over assets in Singapore, much less to pounce on the respondents’\n\nassets worldwide. The fact that the respondents were a Panamanian company and only owned\n\nthe vessel \"LANGSA\" and no others, did not necessarily mean that an injunction\n\nshould be granted. Before us, the main issue was again whether the real risk of\n\ndissipation test had been satisfied.",
        "Real risk of\n\ndissipation": "14\n\n        There was a suggestion that as the appellants\n\nhad shipped cargoes on board the LANGSA previously, they would have known that it belonged\n\nto the respondents. We were unable to follow the logic of this contention. The appellants\n\ndid not deal with the respondents but with Foong Sun who managed the LANGSA and issued its\n\nown form of bill of lading. A ship’s manager cum agent could be handling the vessels\n\nof many owners. The appellants said that they did not know who the owners of the LANGSA\n\nwere. There was no evidence that the shippers of goods would normally check on the\n\nownership of a vessel. It was only after the fire had occurred on the PRATIWI and when\n\nfurther searches on the Lloyds’ Register of Ships Supplement & New Entries\n\nJuly/August 2001 and May/June 2002 were made, that it was discovered that the respondents\n\nalso owned the LANGSA. Upon this discovery, the writ issued earlier was, on 16 July 2002,\n\namended to include the LANGSA.15\n\n        The appellants relied in the main upon the\n\nfollowing facts and circumstances to contend that there was a real risk of dissipation:-(i)\n\n        The timing of the sale of the LANGSA. In assessing the significance of\n\n    this timing, the following two dates must be kept in mind. In April 2002 the appellants\n\n    informed the respondents that the insurers of the cargo had repudiated liability. Then on\n\n    18 June 2002, China Insurance informed the appellants that they denied liability for the\n\n    claim. Thus, the matter could not be resolved amicably. Four days later, on 22 June 2002,\n\n    the respondents executed the bill of sale of their only asset, the LANGSA, through their\n\n    agents, Foong Sun. No reason was offered as to why the respondents had to dispose of that\n\n    asset.(ii)\n\n        The bill of sale stated that the price had been paid. Admittedly, in\n\n    Elaine Quek’s affidavit she stated that the payment had not yet been received. But\n\n    the question was, why did the bill of sale state something which was not true? Was there\n\n    anything behind that? These were queries which any fair minded individual, viewing the\n\n    situation, would naturally have raised. Answers should have been provided. Yet none was\n\n    forthcoming.(iii)\n\n        The respondents were no longer carrying on business, having sold their\n\n    only asset, the LANGSA.(iv)\n\n        The respondents were evasive about their country of incorporation,\n\n    registered office address, assets and other matters;(v)\n\n        The proceeds of sale of the LANGSA, being cash, could easily be\n\n    disposed of or dissipated.(vi)\n\n        The respondents were incorporated in Panama, a country with whom\n\n    Singapore had no arrangement for the reciprocal enforcement of judgments.",
        "The Law": "16\n\n        It is settled law that an appellate\n\ncourt’s function in relation to the judge’s exercise of discretion in granting\n\nor refusing to grant an interlocutory relief is only one of review and not to exercise an\n\nindependent discretion of its own. In the words of Lord Diplock inHadmor Productions\n\nLtd v Hamilton[1982] 2 WLR 322.(The appellate\n\n    court) must defer to the judge’s exercise of his discretion and not interfere with it\n\n    merely upon the ground that the members of the appellate court would have exercised the\n\n    discretion differently. The function of the appellate court is initially one of review\n\n    only. It may set aside the judge’s exercise of his discretion on the ground that it\n\n    was based upon a misunderstanding of the law or of the evidence before him or upon an\n\n    inference that particular facts existed or did not exist which, although it was one that\n\n    might legitimately have been drawn upon the evidence that was before the judge can be\n\n    demonstrated to be wrong by further evidence that has become available by the time of the\n\n    appeal… \"17\n\n        There are two main requirements which a\n\nplaintiff must satisfy before a court will grant a Mareva injunction. The first is that\n\nthe plaintiff must have a \"good arguable case\". The respondents did not raise\n\nany argument in relation to this requirement. Their arguments centred wholly on the second\n\nrequirement, which is that there is a real risk of dissipation of assets or, in the words\n\nof the Court of Appeal inNinemia Maritime Corporation v Trave Schiffahrtsgesellschaft\n\nGmb H[1983] 1 WLR 1412 at 1422(\"The Niedersachsen\")the test is\n\nwhether \"the refusal of Mareva injunction would involve a real risk that a judgment\n\nor award in favour of the plaintiffs would remain unsatisfied\" and this is an\n\nobjective test. The court is not concerned with motive or purpose as opposed to effect:Felixstowe\n\nDock & Rly Co v United States Lines Ltd[1989] QB 360. There is no need to show an\n\nintention to dissipate assets: seeThe Niedersachsen.18\n\n        Clearly, mere assertion that there is a risk of\n\ndissipation is not good enough. There must be some \"solid evidence\" to\n\nsubstantiate the alleged risk. In the words of Mustill J inThe Niedersachsen[1984] 1 All ER 398, whose judgment was upheld on appeal, (at p.406):-It is not enough\n\n    for the plaintiff to assert a risk that the assets will be dissipated. He must demonstrate\n\n    this by solid evidence This evidence may take a number of different forms. It may consist\n\n    of direct evidence that the defendant has previously acted in a way which shows that his\n\n    probity is not to be relied on. Or the plaintiff may show what type of company the\n\n    defendant is (where it is incorporated, what are its corporate structure and assets, and\n\n    so on) so as to raise an inference that the company is not to be relied on. Or again, the\n\n    plaintiff may be able to found his case on the fact that inquiries about the\n\n    characteristics of the defendant have led to a blank wall. Precisely, what form the\n\n    evidence may take will depend on the particular circumstances of the case. But the\n\n    evidence must always be there.\"19\n\n        As is apparent from what Mustill J said, the\n\nhard question in each case is to determine whether the evidence adduced is sufficient to\n\nestablish that there is a real risk of dissipation. It is practically impossible to lay\n\ndown any general guidelines on how the evidential burden could be held to have been\n\nfulfilled. But the evidence must reasonably have a bearing on the risk factor. In our\n\nopinion, a good piece of evidence would be where the defendant, for no sufficient reason,\n\nstarts to put his property up for sale or where a company just ceases business.20Steven Gee on Mareva Injunctions and Anton\n\nPiller Relief (4thEdn)at p. 195-7 set out the factors which are relevant\n\nto the consideration of the question of risk. Below are some of the factors which the\n\nauthor has identified and which are germane to the present appeal.\"1.\n\n        The nature of the assets which are to be the subject of the proposed\n\n    injunction, and the ease or difficulty with which they could be disposed of or dissipated.\n\n    The plaintiff may find it easier to establish the risk of dissipation of a bank account,\n\n    or of moveable chattels, than the risk that the defendant will dispose of real estate,\n\n    e.g., his house or office. …2.\n\n        The nature and financial standing of the defendant’s business ..3.\n\n        The length of time the defendant has been in business ….4.\n\n        The domicile or residence of the defendant ….5.\n\n        If the defendant is a foreign company, partnership, or trader, the\n\n    country in which it has been registered or has its main business address, and the\n\n    availability or non-availability of any machinery for reciprocal enforcement of English\n\n    judgments or arbitration awards in that country. …6.\n\n        The defendant’s past or existing credit record. A history of\n\n    default in honouring other debts may be a powerful factor in the plaintiff’s favour\n\n    – on the other hand, persistent default in honouring debts, if it occurs in a period\n\n    shortly before the plaintiff commences his action, may signify nothing more than the fact\n\n    that the defendant has fallen upon hard times and has cash-flow difficulties, or is about\n\n    to become insolvent. …9.\n\n        The defendant’s behaviour in response to the plaintiff’s\n\n    claims: a pattern of evasiveness, or unwillingness to participate in the litigation or\n\n    arbitration, or raising thin defences after admitting liability, or total silence, may be\n\n    factors which assist the plaintiff.\"",
        "Our Decision": "21\n\n        It appeared to us clear that the following\n\nfactors were not given sufficient consideration by the court below in refusing the grant\n\nof a Mareva injunction:-(i)\n\n        The sale on 22 June 2002 of the only vessel, LANGSA, owned by the\n\n    respondents.(ii)\n\n        The respondents had ceased business.(iii)\n\n        The false statement in the bill of sale that the proceeds had been\n\n    paid.(iv)\n\n        The respondents are a company incorporated in Panama, a country with\n\n    whom Singapore has no arrangement on reciprocal enforcement of judgment.(v)\n\n        The proceeds of sale of the LANGSA when eventually received could be\n\n    easily dissipated or removed out of Singapore.22\n\n        In our judgment, these facts constituted\n\n\"solid evidence\" indicating that there was a real risk of dissipation. We\n\nrecognised that each of these factors, on its own, would not necessarily indicate a real\n\nrisk. An example would be where a defendant was a foreign company. That factper secould not be a ground to allege that there would be a real risk of dissipation. A\n\nplaintiff who entered into a commercial arrangement with a foreign entity would have\n\nrealized that he would encounter certain inconvenience in enforcing the contract or a\n\njudgment. That would be the normal order of things. But when one were to take this factor,\n\ntogether with the other factors enumerated above into account, the picture could well be\n\ndifferent as in this case.23\n\n        Of the five factors listed in 22 above, the\n\ntwo most critical ones were: (i) the fact that the respondents had sold the LANGSA, and\n\n(ii) the respondents had ceased to carry on business. It was significant that no reason\n\nwas offered to explain why the respondents had to dispose of their only asset, the\n\n\"LANGSA\". This could not be a transaction in the ordinary course of business.\n\nUnless an explanation was offered it wouldprima faciebe an act of dissipation.\n\nThis factor alone would have sufficed for the court to grant a Mareva injunction.24\n\n        Similarly, with regard to the factor of the\n\nrespondents ceasing business, here again there was no explanation. There was no indication\n\nof any future plans. This factor alone would also have sufficed for the issue of a Mareva\n\ninjunction. With respect to the judge below, we thought she indulged in speculation when\n\nshe held that there was no evidence that the stoppage of trading by the respondents would\n\nbe permanent. But the fact of the matter was that no explanation was given by the\n\nrespondents at all. What was real was that the business of the respondents had stopped.\n\nThere was no evidence to contradict or qualify that. If the stoppage was intended to be\n\ntemporary, why didn’t the respondents say so?25\n\n        The bill of sale stated that the proceeds of\n\nsale had been paid when it was not. Why was a falsehood stated in the bill? No explanation\n\nwas offered by either Elaine Quek or the respondents. The argument was made that if there\n\nwas any intention to deceive, Elaine Quek would not have disclosed that the purchaser had\n\nnot yet made payment. Be that as it may, it was a matter exclusively within the knowledge\n\nof the respondents and/or Elaine Quek. Perhaps, faced with an application for a Mareva\n\ninjunction, Elaine Quek felt compelled to set out the true position. The silence certainly\n\ndid not help. Moreover, the proceeds of the LANGSA, when paid to the respondents, would be\n\nin cash and could be easily disposed of or dissipated.26\n\n        It seemed to us that a very significant feature\n\nof the case was the deafening silence on the part of the respondents and their managers,\n\nFoong Sun. Foong Sun, in the person of Elaine Quek, purported to speak for the respondents\n\nbut gave no explanation of the various actions taken by the respondents including the fact\n\nthat the respondents had agreed to a deferred payment of the price of the LANGSA. The\n\ncourt was also not told what were the actual payment terms. Points which required answers\n\nwere just left unanswered. We would also add that many documents were disclosed in the\n\nproceedings, but we were never shown a single document emanating from the respondents.27\n\n        Finally, there was one other circumstance we\n\nought to allude to. It would be noted that China Insurance had issued a policy to cover\n\nthe respondents for third party liabilities up to $500,000. But that was still way below\n\nthe quantified claim of the appellants at $904,164. Moreover, China Insurance had yet to\n\nreply to the appellants’ letter seeking confirmation that China Insurance would pay\n\nif the appellants should establish their claim against the respondents.28\n\n        The cross-undertaking in damages furnished by\n\nthe appellants provided an adequate safeguard against the possibility that the injunction\n\nmight be wrongly granted. It could not be argued that the injunction might destroy the\n\nrespondents’ business, or that a third party’s confidence in them might be\n\nundermined, as the respondents had already ceased business.29\n\n        The injunction which the appellants sought\n\nbefore us, and which we granted, was very specific, namely, only in respect of the\n\nproceeds of sale of the LANGSA, irrespective of whether the moneys would be received in\n\nSingapore or elsewhere. Here again, we would observe that the respondents did not indicate\n\nwhether the payment would be received in Singapore or elsewhere. We did not think this\n\ninjunction was really of a worldwide nature. But even if this injunction could be\n\nconsidered to be of that nature, it should still be granted as it did not appear that the\n\nrespondents had other assets within the jurisdiction. InDerby & Co Ltd v Weldon\n\n(Nos 3 & 4)[1990] 1 Ch 65 Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR said (at p.79):-I can see neither\n\n    rhyme nor reason in regarding the existence of some asset within the jurisdiction of\n\n    however little value as a pre-condition for granting aMarevainjunction in respect\n\n    of assets outside the jurisdiction. The existence ofsufficientassets within the\n\n    jurisdiction is an excellent reason for confining the jurisdiction to such assets, but,\n\n    other considerations apart, the fewer the assets within the jurisdiction the greater the\n\n    necessity for taking protective measures in relation to those outside it.\"30\n\n        In the result, we allowed the appeal and\n\ngranted a Mareva injunction over the proceeds of sale of the LANGSA.Sgd:CHAO HICK TINJUDITH PRAKASHJUDGE OF APPEALJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
