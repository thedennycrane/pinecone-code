        "Case for the prosecution": "3. The facts leading to the arrest of the appellant and Abdul Nasser were not in\n\ndispute. Both were arrested on the morning of 23 October 2000, at around 11.50 am, in the\n\nmidst of a surveillance operation carried out by officers from the Central Narcotics\n\nBureau ('CNB'). A few minutes before the arrest, Abdul Nasser was seen boarding a silver\n\ncoloured car driven by the appellant along Aljunied Road. The appellant drove the car into\n\na slip road known as Lorong 25, near Aljunied MRT station. There, Abdul Nasser alighted,\n\nretrieved a rather large plastic bag from the rear passenger seat of the car, and then\n\nwalked towards the MRT station. On his way he was arrested. The plastic bag he was\n\ncarrying was found to have in it five parcels of substances, which were later found by the\n\nDepartment of Scientific Services to contain 2370.5 grams of cannabis.4. The appellant was apprehended at about the same time as Abdul Nasser. He did not\n\nhave a chance to turn his car around to make his escape. A search was conducted on him and\n\nhis car and, among the things found, were: (i) $317.85 from his wallet, (ii) $950 from the\n\nside pocket of the driver's door, and (iii) $6,740 from the pocket behind the driver's\n\nseat. It was subsequently established that the $6,740 found in the car belonged to his\n\nsister and her husband, as was the car driven by him.5. Upon the arrest of Abdul Nasser, he was brought to the side of the slip road and\n\nquestioned by one ASP Chin Chee Meng ('ASP Chin'), the officer-in-charge of the\n\nsurveillance of Abdul Nasser and the appellant. According to him, he recorded an oral\n\nstatement from Abdul Nasser at around 11.55 am. At the trial, a voir dire was held to\n\ndetermine whether the statement was made voluntarily. At the conclusion, this statement\n\nwas found not to have been made by Abdul Nasser voluntarily, and was therefore not\n\nadmitted in evidence.6. A statement was similarly recorded by ASP Chin from the appellant after his arrest,\n\nbut in differing circumstances. According to the appellant, upon his arrest he was made to\n\nlie prone on the ground under the hot noonday sun, pinned down by the two CNB officers who\n\narrested him, for about 30 to 40 minutes, before being moved to some shade, but not until\n\nhe had answered several questions posed to him by ASP Chin. He claimed that ASP Chin told\n\nhim that only when his questions were answered would he be moved to the shade and given\n\nsome water. This was in spite of his pleas to the contrary. The appellant testified that\n\nhe asked for some water not only to quench his thirst but also to wash sweat from his\n\nface, which had trickled into his eyes causing him pain. He further alleged that one of\n\nthe officers who arrested him brandished a gun in his face.7. The prosecution denied the appellant's version of the events. Their account was that\n\nafter the appellant was arrested, ASP Chin gave instructions that the appellant be brought\n\nto the left side of the appellant's car where there was some shade from the hot afternoon\n\nsun. ASP Chin then proceeded to take a statement from Abdul Nasser and thereafter he took\n\na statement from the appellant, which took about 20 minutes and ended at around 12.40 pm.\n\nUpon completing the statement, the questions and answers were read back to the appellant,\n\nwho confirmed that it was correct. The statement was then counter-signed by the appellant,\n\nASP Chin and one Sergeant Azhari, another CNB officer at the scene of arrest. The\n\nstatement was voluntarily made by the appellant and at no time was there any threat,\n\ninducement or promise made to him.8. A voir dire was conducted to determine whether the statement was made by the\n\nappellant voluntarily, and at the conclusion the trial judge held that there was no\n\nthreat, inducement or promise made to the appellant and that the statement was made\n\nvoluntarily. Accordingly, the statement was admitted in evidence.9. The appellant's recorded statement stated as follows:Q1: Can you speak English?A1: Yes. …Q3: What were in the plastics (sic) bag inside the car you were driving?A3: Drugs.Q4: What kind of drugs?A4: What you call it… ahh Ganja.Q5: How much Ganja were in the plastic bag?A5: I don't know… 4 or 5 packets.Q6: How much do you earn for sending these 4 or 5 packets of Ganja?A6: $500 Singapore dollars.Q7: Who were these Ganja you were sending meant for?A7: Nasir.Q8: Who is Nasir?A8: (Recorder's note: [the appellant] indicated subject [Abdul Nasser] arrested with\n\n  him). That one lah arrested with me.Q9: Who was (sic) you and Nasser going to meet?A9: I don't know.Q10: When did you pass the plastic bag containing the 4 or 5 packets of Ganja to\n\n  Nasser?A10: Outside the car when I stopped the car near to Aljunied MRT slip road.Q11: Exactly how many packets of Ganja were there in the plastic bags?A11: I really don't know it's my last piece.Q12: 'Piece' means what?A12: 'Piece' means Ganja.10. Soon after the arrest, the CNB officers raided the premises occupied by the\n\nappellant and Abdul Nasser respectively. Nothing incriminating was found in the premises\n\nof Abdul Nasser; however, three small packets of substances, later found to be cannabis by\n\nthe Department of Scientific Services, were recovered from the premises occupied by the\n\nappellant, namely, the unit 25-D Shelford Road.11. Later in the early hours of the morning on 24 October 2000, at the office of the\n\nCNB, a caution statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 ed)\n\nwas recorded from the appellant by ASP Fan Tuck Chee, the investigating officer. In the\n\nstatement the appellant said: 'Yes, I did give him'. We shall refer to this statement as\n\n'the s 122(6) statement'.",
        "The defence": "12. Both the appellant and Abdul Nasser gave evidence in their respective defences.\n\nThey each put up what the trial judge termed a 'cut-throat' defence, that is, each denying\n\nany knowledge of the drugs and saying that they belonged to the other. Both agreed that\n\nthey were mere acquaintances of each other. Abdul Nasser stated he was introduced to the\n\nappellant by a mutual friend barely three months ago, and had met him only once thereafter\n\nprior to meeting on the day of their arrest. He claimed that the appellant telephoned him\n\non the morning of 23 October 2000 and, upon learning that he was on his way to the market,\n\noffered him a lift. They agreed to meet by Aljunied MRT station. The appellant picked him\n\nup at the appointed place, and drove to Lorong 25. There, the appellant asked him to take\n\nout a plastic bag, which was on the rear passenger seat of the car, and hand it to a man\n\ndressed in army fatigues who was then waiting at the MRT station. The appellant also said\n\nthat he would follow him after parking his car. Abdul Nasser followed the appellant's\n\ninstructions, retrieved the plastic bag and walked towards the MRT station. At this\n\njuncture, the CNB officers intervened and arrested him. He claimed he did not see the\n\ncontents of the bag, nor did he have the opportunity to do so, given that the events all\n\noccurred in the space of a few minutes.13. The appellant's evidence, on the other hand, was a complete denial that he had\n\nknowledge that the plastic bag, which he delivered to Abdul Nasser, contained the\n\ncannabis. He said that he was a maintenance manager for one Mr Loo Choon Beng ('Mr Loo')\n\nin his condominium at 25 Shelford Road as well as for Windsor Nursing Home from which he\n\nderived his pay. Working for Mr Loo entitled him to the use of the unit, 25-D Shelford\n\nRoad which he shared with a gardener, although Mr Loo made it clear that this unit could\n\nnot be rented out for residential purposes. The appellant took it to mean that Mr Loo\n\nwould have no objection if it was rented out as a store.14. The appellant said that his friend Sidek brought Abdul Nasser to Shelford Road\n\nsometime last year with a view to renting some space from his unit to store 'jamu', an\n\nIndonesian herbal medicine. He quoted a fee to Abdul Nasser but no agreement was concluded\n\nand the matter was left at that. Since then he met Abdul Nasser twice, including the\n\nmeeting on the day of the arrest.15. On the morning of 23 October 2000 (which was the day of the arrest), the appellant\n\nsaid that Abdul Nasser telephoned him and told him that he was going over to Shelford\n\nRoad. The appellant told Abdul Nasser that he was not free to entertain him, as he was\n\ngoing to his mother's home to bring her for her medical check-up. Abdul Nasser said that\n\nhe would called again. Several minutes later, he called, and told the appellant he had\n\nleft a 'red bag' in the appellant's store room, and asked if the appellant could bring it\n\nto him. A few minutes later, Abdul Nasser called again, and this time he asked the\n\nappellant to meet him at the bus stop at Aljunied MRT station, and that he would pay the\n\nappellant $50 for his trouble. The appellant claimed that Abdul Nasser later did pay him\n\nthis sum. Abdul Nasser also told the appellant that the things he left behind were in the\n\n'red bag' and that as the bag had holes, he did not want it any more and asked the\n\nappellant to transfer the contents into two plastic bags. Following this conversation and\n\non Abdul Nasser's instructions, the appellant transferred the contents of this 'red bag'\n\ninto a plastic bag which he then put into another plastic bag so that he needed to carry\n\nonly one plastic bag for convenience. The contents in the 'red bag' consisted of five\n\nparcels all wrapped in masking tapes and the actual contents could not be seen. He said\n\nthat they were emitting a 'funny' odour, and he thought that the contents contained herbs.\n\nHe then proceeded to meet Abdul Nasser, and placed the plastic bag on the front passenger\n\nseat.16. The appellant met Abdul Nasser at their pre-arranged meeting place. Instead of\n\nretrieving the plastic bag, Abdul Nasser boarded the appellant's car and placed the bag in\n\nthe rear passenger seat. He instructed the appellant to drive to the slip road, Lorong 25\n\nand upon arrival there, he alighted and soon thereafter he was arrested. So was the\n\nappellant.17. As regards the three packets of cannabis recovered from 25-D Shelford Road, the\n\nappellant admitted that they belonged to him. The learned judge felt that although this\n\nevidence was not strictly relevant to the offences committed by the appellant, nonetheless\n\nit added weight to the prosecution's case that the appellant was lying when he stated he\n\nhad no knowledge that he was delivering cannabis to Abdul Nasser.",
        "The decision below": "18. The charge against the appellant was that he trafficked in the five parcels of\n\ncannabis by delivering them to Abdul Nasser. He was found in possession of a plastic bag\n\nwhich contained the cannabis. The fact of possession of the plastic triggered the\n\npresumption under sub-ss (1) and (2) of s 18 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. He had to rebut\n\nthese two presumptions by showing, on the balance of probabilities, that he did not know\n\nand could not reasonably have known that the bag he delivered to Abdul Nasser contained\n\nthe drugs.19. The trial judge found the evidence against the appellant compelling. It was not\n\ndisputed that the 'red bag' containing the five parcels of cannabis was kept in the\n\nstore-room of 25 - D, Shelford Road, which at the material time was occupied by the\n\nappellant. The appellant admitted that he packed the five parcels of cannabis into a\n\nplastic bag and brought them to Aljunied MRT station. The judge found unsatisfactory the\n\nappellant's evidence that Abdul Nasser stored the 'red bag' at his store-room and that on\n\nthe morning of 23 October 2000 Abdul Nasser requested him to bring the contents of the\n\n'red bag' to him (Abdul Nasser) at Aljunied MRT station. The judge could find no cogent\n\nreason why Abdul Nasser, who was merely an acquaintance of the appellant, would have\n\nstored such a large quantity of cannabis at the store-room and have the appellant deliver\n\nthem to him the following day for a fee of $50. Further, his cautioned statement under s\n\n122 (6) of the CPC gave no indication of his defence, which was that he had no knowledge\n\nof the contents of the bag or that the contents belonged to Abdul Nasser. A sum of $950\n\nwas found in the side pocket on the driver's door of the car he was then driving. The\n\njudge did not find satisfactory his explanation as to how he came to this sum. Three small\n\npackets of cannabis were found in the premises which he occupied, and he admitted that\n\nthey belonged to him and that he smoked cannabis from time to time. Summing up his case\n\nagainst the appellant, the learned judge held at 25: 25 Taking all the evidence into\n\naccount, including the manner in which the second accused [the appellant] gave his\n\ntestimony, I am satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt\n\nagainst the second accused, and nothing he or his witnesses have said had created any\n\ndoubt in my mind that he did not know that the plastic bag he brought to the first accused\n\n[Abdul Nasser] contained cannabis.",
        "The appeal": "20. The appellant's appeal was straightforward. In his submission before us, Mr Subhas\n\nAnandan, counsel for the appellant, made two principal arguments. The first related to the\n\njudge's acceptance of the prejudicial evidence of Abdul Nasser against the appellant. The\n\nsecond related to the statements made by the appellant to the CNB officers after his\n\narrest.",
        "Evidence of Abdul Nasser": "21. The appellant and Abdul Nasser each put up a defence which cast the blame on the\n\nother. Each claimed that he had no knowledge of the drugs in the plastic bag and each said\n\nthat the contents of the plastic bag belonged to the other and that he was used as a mere\n\npawn in the drug trafficking operation carried out by the other. Before the judge, the\n\nrespective counsels for the appellant and Abdul Nasser each urged the judge to exercise\n\ngreat caution in accepting the evidence of the other accused against his own client.22. Before us, counsel for the appellant submitted that the judge failed to consider\n\nadequately the likelihood of Abdul Nasser giving unreliable evidence so as to exonerate\n\nhimself and implicate the appellant. He pointed out that the appellant and Abdul Nasser\n\nwere participes criminis in the offence with which they were charged, and that under s 116\n\nof the Evidence Act the court may presume that an accomplice was unworthy of credit and\n\nhis evidence be treated with caution. Counsel therefore submitted that Abdul Nasser's\n\nevidence should be presumed to be unworthy of credit and should be treated as such, and\n\nthat the judge erred in accepting the evidence of Abdul Nasser on the material events\n\nshowing that he had no knowledge of the drugs, despite the material discrepancies and\n\ninconsistencies therein.23. It is true that Abdul Nasser's evidence in substance was that he had no knowledge\n\nof the contents of the plastic bag. His evidence was that he retrieved the bag from the\n\nrear seat of the appellant's car because he was asked by the appellant to bring it out and\n\nhand it to a man in army fatigues who was then waiting at the MRT station. In this\n\nrespect, there was evidence from the prosecution that there was a man in army fatigues at\n\nthe MRT station and an unsuccessful attempt was made to arrest that man.24. The evidence of Abdul Nasser was crucial to his defence. The judge considered this\n\nevidence against all the evidence adduced against him and evaluated it at 30 as follows:\n\n30. … So, having put the case against the first accused [Abdul Nasser] as highly as I\n\ncan on the evidence, I weigh them against the testimony of the first accused himself. He\n\nwas clearly not as articulate or alert as the second accused [the appellant]. If he had a\n\ndevious or sophisticated mind it was not apparent from his evidence or the manner in which\n\nhe gave it. I am prepared to attribute the inaccuracies in his evidence to forgetfulness\n\nand simplicity of mind. I had also taken into account that he had no previous connections\n\nwith drug-taking or drug-trafficking; nor were there any drugs or drug related\n\nparaphernalia in his possession anywhere; and that his s 121 CPC statement (admitted in\n\nevidence by the defence) which appeared to have been comprehensively and fairly recorded\n\nby ASP Fun, about a week after the arrest, bears out what he had said in court. I am\n\nsatisfied that that on the balance of probabilities, the first accused did not know that\n\nhe was carrying cannabis at the time of his arrest.In our judgment the judge had properly evaluated the evidence of Abdul Nasser and was\n\njustified in coming to the conclusion that Abdul Nasser did not know that the plastic bag\n\ncontained cannabis.",
        "The appellant's evidence": "25. Turning to the evidence of the appellant, we did not find that the judge evaluated\n\nhis evidence relying solely on the evidence of Abdul Nasser. The judge found that the\n\nevidence against the appellant was compelling and in arriving at this conclusion no\n\nreliance was placed on Abdul Nasser's evidence. The judge said at 21: 21. The evidence\n\nagainst the second accused [the appellant] is compelling. He packed the five parcels of\n\ncannabis into the plastic bag and brought them in his car to the Aljunied MRT station.\n\n… His cautioned statement gave no indication of his defence which was that he had no\n\nknowledge of the contents, or that the contents belonged to the first accused [Abdul\n\nNasser]. Instead, it was an admission of the fact of his giving the bag (and cannabis) to\n\nthe first accused. A large sum of money was found in the car driven by the second accused\n\nat the time of his arrest. Cannabis was found in his place of abode; and he freely\n\nadmitted that those belonged to him and that he smoked cannabis from time to time. His\n\ntestimony must, therefore, be considered against this background.26. Next, the judge considered the inherent improbabilities of the appellant's evidence\n\nthat he did not know that the five parcels in the plastic bag contained cannabis. The\n\njudge held at 22: 22. The evidence of the second accused [the appellant] is unsatisfactory\n\nin certain aspects. First, there was no cogent reason why the first accused [Abdul Nasser]\n\ncould not have kept the \"red\" bag (containing the five parcels of cannabis) in\n\nhis own home. The bag was not at all a large one and could easily have been kept almost\n\nanywhere in a flat. No evidence or suggestion was put forward as to why he could not have\n\ndone so. Secondly, no reason was given or suggested as to why the first accused would go\n\nunannounced to the residence of the second accused, a person he had only met twice before,\n\nand leave a consignment of cannabis there, unguarded, without telling him. The\n\nincontrovertible evidence was that the \"red\" bag was kept in an unlocked\n\nstore-room at the second accused's flat at 25-D Shelford Road. If the cannabis belonged to\n\nthe first accused, would he have done that? I think it most unlikely. Furthermore, no\n\nreason was offered as to why he would leave the bag there for just the night and Sunday\n\nand have the second accused deliver them to him for a delivery fee of $50. I am of the\n\nview that the testimony of the second accused that the first accused instructed him to\n\ntransfer the cannabis from the \"red\" bag to two plastic bags was an\n\nembellishment. The second accused said that the first accused told him that he no longer\n\nrequired the \"red\" bag because it was full of holes. When examined in court, the\n\nbag was rather new and no holes were found on it.The judge could not be faulted in his evaluation of this evidence of the appellant. We\n\nagreed entirely with the judge.",
        "The appellant's statements": "27. We now turn to counsel's arguments in relation to the two statements made by the\n\nappellant after his arrest, namely, the statement made by the appellant to ASP Chin\n\nimmediately after his arrest, and the s 122(6) statement made by the appellant to ASP Fan\n\nTuck Chee.28. We turn first to counsel's argument on the s 122(6) statement. That statement was\n\ntaken in the wee hours of the morning, and counsel submitted that insufficient weight was\n\ngiven to the fact that the appellant was under extreme exhaustion then and that statement\n\nshould have been excluded altogether. We were unable to agree. The judge clearly took into\n\naccount that the statement was taken from the appellant at the very early hours of the\n\nmorning and the appellant's state of mind at the time. Nonetheless, he came to the\n\nconclusion that the statement was given by him voluntarily. We only needed to refer to the\n\nrelevant parts of the learned judge's reasons, which was stated at 23: 23 … I take\n\ninto account that the second accused [the appellant] was under some stress on the day of\n\nhis arrest, and that he was led from one place to another in the course of assisting the\n\nCNB in their investigations such that by 3 am the following morning when his cautioned\n\nstatement was recorded he was probably exhausted. In the circumstances, how ought his\n\ncautioned statement be evaluated? There is no doubt that the statement was properly\n\nrecorded by the investigating officer ASP Fan Tuck Chee. All the second accused said was,\n\n\"Yes, I did give him.\" I do not think that, given his character and disposition,\n\nthe second accused could not, even in those circumstances, have at least said, \"Those\n\ndrugs did not belong to me\" or words to that effect. .. The cautioned statement of\n\nthe second accused was of no assistance to him even if no adverse inference was drawn from\n\nit.In our judgment, the judge did not erred in his evaluation of the appellant's s 122(6)\n\nstatement.29. Counsel's argument against the admission of the statement made to ASP Chin was more\n\ncontentious. It will be recalled that the appellant claimed that he was pinned down on the\n\nground for more than 30 minutes after his arrest whilst a statement was elicited from him.\n\nIt was further claimed that he was told he would only be moved to some shade after he\n\nanswered several questions posed by ASP Chin. Counsel argued that such treatment and\n\nhandling of the appellant by the CNB officers after the arrest was tantamount to\n\noppression sufficient to justify the exclusion of the statement, as it was obvious that in\n\nthe circumstances the statement was not made by the appellant voluntarily. It was not\n\ndisputed that oppression could render inadmissible a confession in the present instance\n\nunder s 24 of the Evidence Act: see Gulam bin Notan Mohd Shariff Jamalddin v PP[1999] 2 SLR 181at p 203.30. The prosecution's witnesses, however, denied the appellant's allegations. In\n\nparticular, Sgt Khairudin who was present in the arrest of the appellant denied that the\n\nappellant was pinned to the ground for 40 minutes. ASP Chin also denied the appellant's\n\nallegations. He said that he asked the officers who had arrested the appellant to bring\n\nhim to the left side of the car, where there was some shade, so that he could keep an eye\n\non him, while he recorded a statement from Abdul Nasser. The appellant was seated on the\n\nroad from the time of his arrest to 12.20 pm when he began recording a statement from the\n\nappellant, which took about 20 minutes.31. Unfortunately, the judge did not make a clear finding on all this evidence before\n\nhim. We were in no position to determine on the evidence whether in fact the appellant was\n\nso treated as he alleged. Suffice it to say that if what the appellant said was\n\nsubstantially true, then the circumstances in which the statement was taken were\n\noppressive and the burden was on the prosecution to prove otherwise. For our purpose, this\n\nwas not a material point. Even if this evidence was excluded - and in this appeal we\n\nproceeded on that basis - there was ample evidence to justify the conclusion of the judge\n\nthat the prosecution had proved the charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.",
        "Decision on appeal": "32. Like the judge, we found the evidence against the appellant compelling. It was\n\nadmitted by him that the five parcels containing drugs were stored at 25-D Shelford Road,\n\nthe store-room of which he was in occupation at the material time. He did pack the five\n\nparcels into the big plastic bag and brought the bag in his car to Aljunied MRT station.\n\nAt the time he packed the five parcels, he noticed a funny odour emitting from them. It\n\nwas apparent to us that he knew what the odour was. On his own admission, he was a drug\n\nuser, and upon a raid carried out at 25-D Shelford Road, three small packets of cannabis\n\nwere found there and he admitted that they belonged to him. His evidence was that the five\n\nparcels were stored in the store-room by Abdul Nasser. The judge found this highly\n\nimprobable and did not accept it. Nor did we. We could find no reason why Abdul Nasser,\n\nbeing only a mere acquaintance of the appellant, whom he had met only twice previously,\n\nwould leave such a large quantity of cannabis at his store-room only to be delivered to\n\nhim later.33. The charge against the appellant was that he trafficked in the five parcels\n\ncontaining cannabis by delivering them to Abdul Nasser, an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the\n\nMisuse of Drugs Act. On the evidence, it was proved that he packed the five parcels,\n\nplaced them in a large plastic bag, brought them in his car and delivered them to Abdul\n\nNasser. As a result, there arose the presumptions under sub-ss (1) and (2) of s 18 of the\n\nAct. Under s 18(1) of the Act, as he had in his possession, custody or control of the\n\nplastic bag which contained the drugs, he was presumed, until the contrary was proved, to\n\nhave the drugs in his possession. Under s 18(2) of the Act, he was presumed, until the\n\ncontrary was proved, to know the nature the drugs. The burden therefore was on him to\n\nrebut the statutory presumptions. He clearly failed to do so. His own evidence was that he\n\ndid not know that the five parcels contained cannabis. In view of the weight of evidence\n\nagainst him, his evidence was not accepted by the judge, nor was it accepted by us. In our\n\njudgment, he had not rebutted the presumptions. He had possession of the drugs and he\n\ndelivered them to Abdul Nasser. Therefore, the charge of trafficking in the five parcels\n\ncontaining the cannabis had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the appeal\n\nwas dismissed.Appeal dismissed- Sgd -YONG PUNG HOW- Sgd -L P THEAN- Sgd -CHAO HICK TINChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudge of AppealDate: 3 September 2001Copyright © Government of Singapore."
