        "Section 33": "4\n\n         I shall deal with the two grounds in the\n\nsame order. Section 33(1)(b) states that in determining the compensation payable,\n\n\"any increase in the value of any other land of the person interested likely to\n\naccrue from the use of which the land acquired will be put\" shall be taken into\n\naccount. This provision overrides the decision inSouth Eastern Rly Co v London County\n\nCouncil[1915] 2 Ch 252 which held that the effect of the scheme on an adjoining\n\nproperty should be ignored when calculating the compensation for the acquired property. SoSouth Eastern Rlywould no longer apply. But I do not think anything more can or\n\nshould be read into that.5\n\n         In a sense, it can be argued that s\n\n33(1)(b) strengthens the reverse argument: if Parliament had intended to do away with the\n\nnegative principle ofPointe Gourde,it would have done so more clearly as it did\n\nin s 33(1)(b) in overridingSouth Eastern Rly, rather than leaving it to\n\nimplications. In this regard, the second reading speech made by the then Minister for Law\n\nand National Development, Mr E W Barker, in Parliament when explaining the Land\n\nAcquisition Bill, 1966, which was intended to consolidate the law, is germane:-(1) the assessment of\n\n    compensation provisions have been re-drafted on the basis of two principles enunciated by\n\n    the Prime Minister in December 1963. Firstly,that no landowner should benefit from\n\n    development which has taken place at public expense and, secondly, that the price paid on\n\n    acquisition of land for public purposes should not be higher than what the land would have\n\n    been worth had the Government not carried out development generally in the area,and\n\n    (2) provision has been made for the hearing of appeals by an Appeals Board instead of the\n\n    Court as at present.6\n\n         As regards s 33(5)(e), this provision in\n\nsummary states that in determining market value no account shall be taken of the potential\n\nvalue of the land for any other more intensive use other than the purpose designated in\n\nthe Development Baseline (previously the Master Plan). As far as I can see, s 33(5)(e) has\n\nnothing to do with either the positive or negative principle ofPointe Gourde.This\n\nis borne out by the second reading speech of Mr Barker made on 18 December 1973 when\n\nexplaining the object behind s 33(5)(e):-This will obviate the argument\n\n    that is sometimes made where land has been zoned for a restrictive use, as for example,\n\n    \"public open space\", that the land has got considerable potential for\n\n    development for residential or other purposes. In future, such arguments based on the\n\n    hypothetical consideration that a future change of zoning or use will be granted by the\n\n    Planning Department will not be taken into consideration in determining the compensation\n\n    payable upon acquisition. Thus, land zoned \"Agriculture\", \"Rural\",\n\n    \"Green Belt\" or \"Unclassified\" at the time of acquisition, will be\n\n    valued as such.7\n\n         Finally, as regards the phrase \"and\n\nno others\" in s 33(1) it is true that the phrase was first introduced into the\n\nLand Acquisition Ordinance in 1932. The then Acting Commissioner of Lands, Mr WS Ebden,\n\nwhen speaking in the Legislative Council, made it clear that the phrase was inserted to\n\nlimit the heads of compensation to only those enumerated in s 25 of the then Ordinance. Mr\n\nEbden himself thought that even without the phrase, s 25 was clear enough and that owners\n\nwhose lands had been acquired could only claim under those heads enumerated in s 25. But\n\nhis predecessor had thought, in the light of a decision then, that what was listed in s 25\n\nwere merely guides and were not exhaustive and that an award could be given in respect of\n\na matter which did not fall under any of those heads. So the phrase was inserted to remove\n\nany conceivable doubt.8\n\n         At this moment, and for a better\n\nappreciation of the issue, it may be expedient if I set out the heads enumerated under the\n\npresent s 33(1):-(a)    the market\n\n    value -(i) (A) …(inapplicable)\n\n      …;(B) … (inapplicable) …;(C) as at 1stJanuary\n\n      1995 in respect of land acquired on or after 27thSeptember 1995;(ii) as at the date of the\n\n      publication of the notification under section 3(1) if the notification is, within 6 months\n\n      from the date of its publication, followed by a declaration under section 5 in respect of\n\n      the same land or part thereof; or(iii) as at the date of the\n\n      publication of the declaration made under section 5, whichever is the lowest.(b) any increase in the value of\n\n    any other land of the person interested likely to accrue from the use to which the land\n\n    acquired will be put;(c) the damage, if any, sustained\n\n    by the person interested at the time of the Collector’s taking possession of the land\n\n    by reason of severing that land from his other land;(d) the damage, if any, sustained\n\n    by the person interested at the time of the Collector’s taking possession of the land\n\n    by reason of the acquisition injuriously affecting his other property, whether movable or\n\n    immovable, in any other manner;(e) if, in consequence of the\n\n    acquisition, he is compelled to change his residence or place of business, the reasonable\n\n    expenses, if any, incidental to that change; and(f) if, in consequence of the\n\n    acquisition, any reissue of title is necessary, the fees or costs relating to survey,\n\n    issue and registration of title, stamp duty and such other costs or fees which may\n\n    reasonably be incurred.9        In\n\nrelation to the present case, heads (b) to (f) are not pertinent. Only head (a), which\n\nrelates to how the market value is to be determined, is relevant. Under this head, the\n\nlowest of the market values on three different dates, namely, 1 January 1995, (the\n\nacquisition being after 27 September 1995), the date of publication of s 3(1) notification\n\n(in this case there was no such s 3(1) notification) and the date of publication of s 5\n\ndeclaration, shall be taken to be the market value. This head really sets the valuation\n\ndate and has nothing to do with the increase or decrease in value which is due to the\n\nscheme underlying the acquisition. It is common ground between the parties that in this\n\ncase the applicable date is the date on which the s 5 declaration was published, the\n\nmarket being lowest at that point. So the market value on that date is determinative. It\n\nis vitally important to note that thePointe Gourdeprinciple relates to the\n\ndetermination of the market value and it does not add a new head of claim. In my view,\n\nthere is nothing in head (a) nor in heads (b) to (f), which necessarily suggests that thePointe\n\nGourdeprinciple should be disregarded in determining the market value of the acquired\n\nland.10        If\n\nit were correct to hold that by virtue of the phrase \"and no others\" in s\n\n33(1), the negativePointe Gourdeprinciple is excluded, then it should also be\n\nwholly unnecessary to provide in s 34(e) that the Board shall not take into consideration\n\n\"any increase to the value of the land acquired likely to accrue from the use to\n\nwhich it will be put when acquired\", this being the positive principle ofPointe\n\nGourde. Why is there a need to have s 34(e) when such a claim or argument would not\n\nhave been possible? Indeed, the enactment of s 34(e), which really relates to the\n\ndetermination of the market value, is inconsistent with the argument placed on the words\n\n\"and no others\" by the Collector of Land Revenue.",
        "Presumption against implied\n\nalteration": "11        In\n\nthis connection, it is vitally important to bear in mind another settled principle of\n\ninterpretation of statutes. The principle is that the court should not construe a\n\nstatutory provision to have modified or altered a common law principle or right unless\n\nParliament has by express words, or necessary implications, done so. Lord Reid said inBlack-Clawson\n\nInternational Limited v Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg AG[1975] AC 591 at 614:-There is a presumption which can\n\n    be stated in various ways. One is that in the absence of any clear indication to the\n\n    contrary Parliament can be presumed not to have altered the common law further than was\n\n    necessary to remedy the \"mischief\"12        InNational\n\nAssistance Board v Wilkinson[1952] 2QB 648, Lord Devlin said (at p.661):-\"It is a well-established\n\n    principle of construction that a statute is not to be taken as effecting a fundamental\n\n    alteration in the general law unless it uses words that point unmistakeably to that\n\n    conclusion.\"13        InMurugiah\n\nv Jainudeen[1955] AC 14 the Privy Council, on an appeal from Ceylon, approved the\n\nfollowing passage found inMaxwell’s Interpretation of Statute (10thEdn at p.81):-\"Presumption against\n\n    implicit alteration of law: One of these presumptions is that the legislature does not\n\n    intend to make any substantial alteration in the law beyond what it explicitly declares,\n\n    either in express terms or by clear implications, or, in other words, beyond the immediate\n\n    scope and object of the statute. In all general matters outside those limits the law\n\n    remains undisturbed. It is in the last degree improbable that the legislature would\n\n    overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or departs from the general system of\n\n    law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness.\"14        A\n\nvery useful summary of the principles on the interpretation of statutes is set out inBennion\n\non Statutory Interpretation (3rdEdn)at p.626. I should add that the\n\nauthor was a former British Parliamentary Counsel:-(1) It is a principle of legal\n\n    policy that law should be altered deliberately rather than casually, and that Parliament\n\n    should not change either common law or statute law by a sidewind, but only by measured and\n\n    considered provisions. In the case of common law or Acts embodying common law, the\n\n    principle is somewhat stronger than in other cases. It is also stronger the more\n\n    fundamental the change is.(2) The court, when considering,\n\n    in relation to the facts of the instant case, which of the opposing constructions of the\n\n    enactment would give effect to the legislative intention, should presume that the\n\n    legislator intended to observe the principle. The court should therefore strive to avoid\n\n    adopting a construction which involves accepting that Parliament contravened the\n\n    principle.15        The\n\nfact that Parliament had incorporated the positive principle ofPointe Gourdeinto\n\ns 34(e) does not necessarily mean that it had discarded the negative principle. It simply\n\ndoes not follow. In their judgment, my learned brothers accepted this. In fact, it could\n\nbe argued that this fact reinforces the reverse argument: if Parliament intended to do\n\naway with the negative principle, it would have easily said so. When it does not say so,\n\nit must be inferred that Parliament had no such intention.16        In\n\nthis context, the decision of the Privy Council inMelwood Units v Commissioner of Main\n\nRoads[1978] WLR 520, a case on appeal from New South Wales, is on point. There, the\n\nPrivy Council held that statutory enactment of only the positivePointe Gourdeprinciple did not imply that its converse principle was intended to be omitted. Lord\n\nRussell said (at 526):-In their Lordships opinion it is\n\n    a part of the common law deriving as a matter of principle from the nature of compensation\n\n    for resumption or compulsory acquisition, that neither relevantly attributable\n\n    appreciation nor depreciation in value is to be regarded in the assessment of land\n\n    compensation. The relevant New South Wales section merely reflects the law … and the\n\n    absence of the reverse of the medal in the relevant section of the Queensland Main Roads\n\n    Acts is not to be taken as altering the law.\"17        The\n\nconsequences of holding that the negativePointe Gourdeprinciple can have no place\n\nunder our Act could be very severe. It could lead to the acquired property being\n\ncompensated perhaps even nominally. Let me explain. As is often the case, a public scheme\n\nis announced before the lands affected are actually acquired. It could be six months, or a\n\nyear or two before the acquisition. It could even be very much longer, as in the present\n\ncase. Following the announcement, say for a new MRT station, if the land is affected\n\ntotally, it is unlikely that thereafter there will be buyers for that land. If the\n\nnegativePointe Gourdeprinciple is held not to be applicable, no one would\n\nthereafter touch it. In the past, perhaps some people might buy on speculation, expecting\n\na near full compensation. With the instant ruling, the land may become totally unsaleable.\n\nConceivably, the land could, as a result, have no significant market value at the time of\n\nacquisition. Any sale of another property around that area, which is not affected by the\n\nscheme, would hardly be an appropriate comparable. Such a consequence is indeed grave.18        Even\n\nin a situation where only part of a land is acquired, the adverse consequence of the\n\nruling will also be felt, although the extent of its effect would be less clear cut. It is\n\ncommon knowledge that, hitherto, whenever a public scheme affects a private property, be\n\nit a road line or any other public project, the value of the property will invariably be\n\nadversely affected. The extent of such adverse effect would necessarily depend on the\n\ncircumstances. It is probably true to say that if the scheme was a road line, its negative\n\neffect on the price of the property would be less, as there was usually a belief that the\n\nroad widening might not take place for some years to come and that when acquisition should\n\noccur there would be compensation. So a buyer of a property of 10,000 square feet,\n\naffected by a road line say to the extent of 2,000 square feet, would naturally tell the\n\nowner that he really had only 8,000 square feet to sell. But the owner would be able to\n\nretort that if that part were eventually acquired, the buyer would be compensated. But\n\nwith this ruling, I am not sure an owner can truly tell a buyer that he would be\n\nadequately compensated for the part which would be acquired.19        All\n\nthese discussions may appear somewhat theoretical. But when one looks at the figures\n\nthrown about (e.g., $488,000/$285,000 or $406,000/$240,000) in relation to the case which\n\ngive rise to the present Case Stated, the problems are real. They indicated a drop of some\n\n40%. This was under the current position before this Case Stated where the seller and\n\nbuyer were unaware as to how the negativePointe Gourdeprinciple was to be\n\napplied, but with the buyer thinking he would be compensated in the usual way. It must\n\nfollow that if the negativePointe Gourdeprinciple were now held to be\n\ninapplicable, the consequential fall in value will be even more severe.20        I\n\nwould hasten to add that I recognise, as pointed out by State Counsel for the Collector,\n\nthat if we were to apply in general the negative principle ofPointe Gourde, it\n\ncould lead to an owner, who has purchased a property at a depressed price from a desperate\n\nseller during the interim period between the announcement of the scheme and the actual\n\nacquisition, getting a windfall. This aberration cannot and should not be a good enough\n\nreason to deny other owners their just due. With respect, the reasoning isnon sequitur.\n\nIf this sort of aberrations should give rise to concern, the solution lies in further fine\n\ntuning the law by legislative intervention.",
        "Objects of the Act": "21        I am\n\nconscious that the Act is a piece of social legislation for the good of society as a\n\nwhole. Public interest stands paramount. No one should stand in the way of the progressive\n\ndevelopment of the country: thus the need for an acquisition law. For some property\n\nowners, it is not just a question of price. They simply would not want to move, no matter\n\nhow attractive the offer. We have read in the media where some owners even refused an en\n\nbloc sale where they could have reaped significant benefits. While it is understandable\n\nthat they may have sentimental attachment to the place, such sentiments should never be\n\nallowed to stand in the way of progress and public interest. While the Act has set out the\n\nperimeters (under ss 33 and 34) as to how the compensation of an acquired property is to\n\nbe assessed, some of which are obviously geared towards giving something less than the\n\ncurrent market value to the owner (like s 33(1)(a) – the lowest value based on three\n\ndifferent dates), it is highly doubtful that Parliament intended the owner to bear the\n\nbrunt of the sacrifices which would be the case if the negative principle is not applied.\n\nHere, I think Mr Barker’s speech in 1966, which is quoted in 4 above, should be\n\nplaced foremost in mind.22        It\n\nwould be noted that the emphasis by Mr Barker was on landowners benefitting, and to make\n\nsure they would not. That was the cardinal object. But it is altogether another thing to\n\nexpect an owner to lose his property as well as to suffer very substantial loss in terms\n\nof compensation. It would be a heavy burden to place only on the owner, instead of\n\nspreading the burden among taxpayers.23        I\n\nwould further add that Mr Barker reiterated the same objective in his third reading speech\n\nof the 1966 Bill, after it was examined by the Select Committee, when he said the\n\nfollowing:-As has already been explained in\n\n    this House previously,the principle underlining this provision is that no landowner\n\n    should benefit at the public’s expense, from any windfall gains resulting from\n\n    enhancement of land values either through Acts of God or because of public expenditure in\n\n    the neighbourhood. Members are aware of the phenomenal increases in land values which\n\n    result when heavily encumbered lands are devastated by fire. This fortuitous increase in\n\n    value will not now go to the landowner. Again, development by Government and public\n\n    authorities in areas like Jurong, Kallang Basin and Kranji has resulted in phenomenal\n\n    increases in land values in these neighbourhoods. It was ironical that under the existing\n\n    legislation, when additional lands in these areas had to be acquired for public purposes,\n\n    Government had to pay compensation at values which Government itself had helped to\n\n    enhance. The element of enhancement attributable in these cases to public participation\n\n    (as opposed to participation by the private sector), is the element which under the new\n\n    Bill will be creamed off when land is acquired for public purposes. (Emphasis added).24        All\n\nsaid, even with the application of the negative principle and the owner gets compensation\n\nnear to the market value, it would not help him do more than to acquire something\n\nequivalent elsewhere in the open market. There will not be any gain or benefit of the sort\n\nwhich the Minister for Law and National Development said the statutory scheme under the\n\nAct was intended to prevent the owner from obtaining.25        It\n\nseems to me critical to bear in mind that what is encapsulated in the positive and\n\nnegative principle ofPointe Gourdeis really fairness. A landowner should not\n\nbenefit from the proposed scheme leading to the acquisition; but neither should he be\n\npenalised on that account.26        \n\nThere is a previous case where thePointe Gourdeprinciple was raised in argument\n\n–Chew Ming Teck v Collector of Land Revenue and anor[1988] SLR 118. It was a\n\ndecision of this Court. In that case, it was argued that no account should be taken of the\n\nfact that planning permission for redevelopment by the owner was refused due to a public\n\nscheme. This Court seemed to have accepted that thePointe Gourdeprinciple\n\napplied, although it was true that the respondents there agreed with the appellant’s\n\nargument that the land must be valued for compensation leaving out of account any effect\n\non value, either up or down, of the acquisition itself or the scheme underlying it. But,\n\non the facts, the Court held that when the Collector awarded the appellant a nominal sum\n\nof $1/- he did not allow the refusal of the planning permission to the appellant to\n\ninfluence his valuation, either up or down, as the interest which the appellant had in the\n\nland was only a building sublease under which, upon the completion of the new buildings,\n\nthe owners of the land would grant to the appellant a lease of 30 years with two options\n\nof 30 years each. All I would observe is that the Collector in the present case is taking\n\na stand different from that he had taken inChew Ming Teckas far as the negativePointe\n\nGourdeprinciple is concerned.",
        "Conclusion": "27        In\n\nconclusion, it is my opinion that there is nothing in the Act which necessarily suggests\n\nthat the negative principle has no place under our statutory scheme of compensation.\n\nParliament wanted to modify the ruling inSouth Eastern Rly Co,so there is s\n\n33(1)(b). Similarly, Parliament expressly incorporated the positive principle ofPointe\n\nGourdein s 34(e) in order to make it clear beyond doubt that that principle applies.\n\nSo it cannot be said that Parliament was not aware of the negative principle. In any case,\n\nas mentioned before, the fact that there is no express reference to the negative principle\n\ndoes not mean that the negative principle is thereby impliedly abrogated. Bearing in mind\n\nthe ministerial speeches made in Parliament as to the objects of ss 33 and 34 of the Act,\n\nI am humbly of the view that it was not the intention of Parliament that a common law\n\nprinciple such as this, which concerns rights of property owners, should be done away with\n\nby a sidewind. Otherwise, Parliament would have said so as expressly as they did in s\n\n33(1)(b) in relation to the rule enunciated inSouth Eastern Rly Co.28        I\n\ndeeply regret that I am unable, in this instance, to come to the same views as my learned\n\nbrothers, whose opinions I have always held in the highest regard.Sgd:"
