        "Background facts": "2.    The appellant and the respondent first met while\n\nthey were both working in a textile company: he was then the manager and she was his\n\nassistant. After they had known each other for about three months, they both left the\n\nemployment of the company at the same time. The appellant went to work as a nurse in a\n\ngovernmental hospital at Thomson Road, while the respondent proceeded to set up his own\n\nbusiness. He started his own textile business trading in garments sometime in January\n\n1969. The appellant assisted the respondent in the setting up of his business by, among\n\nother things, providing him with some monies, which she had saved. The respondent\n\npersuaded the appellant to resign from her job as a nurse and to assist him in his\n\nbusiness, which she later agreed. They were married on 23 June 1969.3.    The respondent registered his business under the\n\nname and style of International Industrial & Trading Company on 1 July 1969. The\n\nappellant started to work for the respondent at about that time. She took on a variety of\n\nroles, from designing the garments and marketing the company’s products to handling\n\nthe company’s secretarial and accounting needs. In 1971, the respondent extended his\n\nbusiness into manufacturing garments and set up a factory of which the appellant took\n\ncharge. From 1971 to 1977, she worked and lived in the factory. Through her initiatives\n\nand creativity, she ‘invented’ a novel management method, the\n\n‘Colour-Dotted Management Method’, which boosted the productivity of the\n\nfactory. The business grew and at one stage the respondent had over 20 employees. For all\n\nthe work she did, the appellant was not paid a salary or staff allowance. Nor was she\n\ngiven a share of the profits.4.    They have three children, two sons born on 12\n\nDecember 1970 and 24 May 1972, and one daughter born on 11 August 1973. All of them are\n\nabove 21 years old. Both their sons graduated from a polytechnic, and their daughter\n\ncompleted her university education. The appellant is 54 years old and the respondent 60\n\nyears.5.    In late 1977 or thereabouts, the appellant\n\ndiscovered that the respondent had an affair with a seamstress in his employ. She left the\n\nbusiness but continued to maintain the marriage for the sake of the children. She became a\n\nprivate tutor, giving tuition to students over extremely long hours at her residence.\n\nApart from giving private tuition, she also had to attend to the usual household chores\n\nlike cooking, washing and looking after the children. By 1984, she managed to save some\n\nmoneys amounting to about $100,000 which she placed on fixed deposits with United Overseas\n\nFinance Ltd and DBS Bank.6.    Meanwhile, the respondent continued to carry on\n\nthe business, which subsequently ran into difficulties. By November 1980, he was unable to\n\npay the rent for the factory and the salaries of his staff. In March 1982, the factory was\n\nclosed and the business ceased. He sold all the assets of the business but did not pay the\n\nappellant any part of the proceeds of sale. He then left for Indonesia, leaving the\n\nappellant and the children. There, he worked for a garment factory known as PT Busuana\n\nIndah Inter Industri, and was appointed the manager. While he was in Indonesia, he only\n\nreturned once or twice a month and did not provide any maintenance for the appellant and\n\nthe children. It was left to the appellant to maintain herself and the children. The\n\nproduction at the factory of which he was in charge was unsatisfactory. In the following\n\nyear, at his urgent request, the appellant went to Indonesia to help him, leaving her\n\nmother to look after the three children. She helped him implement the ‘Colour Dotted\n\nManagement Method’ in the factory, and as a result, the factory’s production\n\nincreased significantly; her efforts in the factory saved the respondent his job. She\n\nworked there for about three months and thereafter returned to Singapore.7.    In 1984, the couple decided to buy the apartment,\n\n30 Ah Hood Road, #12-02, Nadia Mansions, Singapore at the price of $500,544. They signed\n\nthe sale and purchase agreement on 20 March 1984 with the developer. The flat was then\n\nstill under development, and it was completed only in July 1985. The parties agreed to pay\n\n40% of the purchase price in cash in four equal instalments, with the balance to be\n\nfinanced by the bank on an overdraft account to be secured by a mortgage over the flat.\n\nThe appellant paid for all the four instalments. It was also the appellant who was mainly\n\nresponsible for servicing the overdraft.8.    In 1986, the respondent’s fortunes again\n\nwaned and he returned to Singapore and worked for the company, Tex Line Associates Pte\n\nLtd. The respondent still did not pay for any of the household expenses; nor did he pay\n\nthe monthly instalments for the apartment. The appellant shouldered the main burden of\n\nmaintaining the family. The respondent’s refusal to contribute to supporting the\n\nfamily and servicing the housing loan caused the couple to have frequent quarrels where\n\nthe respondent behaved aggressively towards the appellant. In 1989, as a result of one\n\nsuch incident, the appellant reported the matter to the police. With the help and\n\nintervention of some of the couple’s mutual friends, the respondent agreed to pay\n\nmonthly a sum of $1,000 towards the household expenses. It was during these times that, on\n\n26 June 1989, the respondent agreed to withdraw $50,000 from his CPF account to pay in\n\npart the term loan owed to United Overseas Finance Ltd (‘UOF’). He also agreed\n\nthat a sum of $1,000 be deducted monthly from his CPF account to pay for the instaments of\n\nthe UOF loan with the appellant topping up the balance.9.    The respondent, however, did pay for his\n\nsons’ polytechnic education using his CPF account, but his sons had since repaid him\n\nfor all the costs incurred. The respondent promised to pay for his daughter’s\n\nuniversity education, but as the finances were often not forthcoming, the appellant ended\n\nup paying a large part of her daughter’s education.10.    The respondent did not keep his promise to pay\n\nthe monthly sum of $1,000 for the household expenses. In the result, the appellant had\n\ngreat difficulties in trying to service the housing loan and maintain the family. Finally,\n\nin 1990 she resorted to applying to the court for maintenance, whereupon he agreed to pay\n\n$1,260 per month towards the family’s maintenance. An order was made against him for\n\npayment of such maintenance. The figure was arrived at on the basis of what he told the\n\nappellant, that is, that he was earning about $3,000 a month. In actual fact, he earned\n\nmuch more.11.    The judge in the High Court found that it was at\n\nabout this time that the appellant took in a number of lodgers who were Indonesia\n\nstudents, and that she ‘did earn no insubstantial sums’ from such lodgers. The\n\njudge also found that the moneys she earned from ‘the lodging enterprise’\n\naccounted for the expenditure for the renovations of the apartment that were carried out\n\nand also enabled her to defray the household expenses and the instalments for the housing\n\nloan. There was no dispute on such findings.12.    The respondent left the family in 1992 without a\n\nforwarding address and defaulted in paying the maintenance ordered by the court. The\n\nappellant could only enforce the payment of the arrears, when he returned to Singapore,\n\nwhich he did in 1994. At that time, upon the respondent’s application, the\n\nmaintenance was reduced to $315 per month on the ground that all the children were by then\n\nsui juris. The respondent defaulted in payment of maintenance again from 1996 onwards. The\n\nappellant was only able to enforce the payment of the arrears in 1999, when he returned to\n\nSingapore. After his return, he filed the petition for divorce based on the fact that the\n\nparties had lived apart for a continuous period of not less than 4 years. The petition was\n\nuncontested, and the decree nisi was granted on 8 July 1999.13.    The appellant has since discovered that the\n\nrespondent has settled in South Africa, living with a woman, Tso Kum Yung. He and Tso Kum\n\nYung are directors of two companies in South Africa trading in garments namely, Korsum\n\nTrading and Texline Import and Export. The respondent, however, claimed that since\n\nDecember 2000, after Tso Kum Yung had sold her property, he had been working as a farm\n\nassistant and living in the farm. There was no indication that he intended to return to\n\nSingapore.",
        "The appeal": "14.    The only issue in this appeal was whether the\n\ndivision of matrimonial asset between the parties as ordered by the judge in the High\n\nCourt was ‘just and equitable’, having regard to all the circumstances of the\n\ncase. On this issue, we turn first to the direct financial contribution made by the\n\nparties for the acquisition of the apartment. The judge found that the appellant had\n\ncontributed in total a sum of $884,857.55 representing 87.7%, and the respondent only a\n\ntotal sum of $123,970.91 representing 12.3%.15.    Before us, the respondent did not accept this\n\nfinding and disputed the extent of the appellant’s contribution. We found that he had\n\nnot shown that the finding was in error or in any way unsustainable. In our judgment, this\n\nfinding was amply supported by the documentary evidence adduced by the appellant. There\n\nwere documents produced showing that the appellant liquidated two of her UOF fixed\n\ndeposits and two of her UOB Asian Currency Unit fixed deposits to pay for 40% of the\n\npurchase price. She also produced bank statements to prove her contributions to the\n\nmonthly instalments for servicing the mortgage. The statements also showed that she was\n\nthe one who paid for expenses such as maintenance fees, property taxes, upgrading levies,\n\ninsurance and the legal fees incurred in relation to the apartment. Finally, she produced\n\nreceipts evidencing her expenditure on the renovation of the flat.16.    The documentary evidence adduced by the appellant\n\nwas considered by the judge in some depth. He said at  8:8 I go to the substance of the matter. I examined the 14 banking\n\n  documents exhibited in the wife’s affidavit affirmed on 25 October 2000. They proved\n\n  that the husband did not pay any part of the initial deposit of $200,217.60. In 1984 they\n\n  agreed to purchase the flat for $500,544.00, having exercised the option to purchase on 20\n\n  March 1984. The flat was still under development. It was completed in July of the\n\n  following year. The first 4 initial deposits were of $50,054.40 each. The couple had in\n\n  fact agreed to pay for them in equal shares. But the documentary evidence, which she\n\n  sought to adduce, proved that he did not carry out his part of the bargain. She paid the\n\n  initial \"booking fee\" out of her UOF SGD Fixed Deposit Account No.\n\n  606-405-729-1. The balance of $54.40 was withdrawn from her DBS Savings a/c. In April 1984\n\n  the second installment became payable. She again lifted another UOF fixed deposit of\n\n  $50,000 and paid the balance of $54.40 from her DBS Savings a/c. When the 3rdand 4thinstallments fell due in June, 1984 the husband was unable to pay. The\n\n  wife used her UOB fixed deposit No. 51128 to pay for the third installment. In his letter\n\n  to United Overseas Bank of 6 June 1984 the husband admitted just as much. As for the\n\n  payment of the 4thinstallment, the husband’s letter confirmed that he was\n\n  strapped for cash in his business in Indonesia and again the wife used her UOB fixed\n\n  deposit under receipt No. 51128 to pay for it.He then turned to consider the evidence adduced by the respondent and\n\nconcluded at  10:10 [T]hey proved\n\n  that he did not make any direct financial contributions except for the payment of the lump\n\n  sum and monthly installments from his CPF a/c, which as I had noted, he reluctantly agreed\n\n  because the wife had by then exhausted all her means to pay for them.The judge also relied on a further affidavit filed by the appellant\n\nwhich showed that she had borrowed moneys from an Indonesian lady, Amy Lousiana, who is\n\nthe mother of one the appellant’s borders, to pay for the instalments for the house\n\nand household expenses. The judge said at  11:11 On 2 February 2001 the wife sought the admission of another\n\n  affidavit, which she had filed. She wanted to admit the OCBC banking documents, which\n\n  confirmed her version that one of her friends, an Indonesian lady by the name of Amy\n\n  Lousiana, had extended to her financial assistance throughout the years when she needed to\n\n  pay for the flat and house expenses. This lady was the mother of one of the several\n\n  Indonesian lodgers who lived in the flat. The wife had incurred liabilities which she has\n\n  to pay back to Amy Lousiana and this was a relevant factor to take into account.17.    The judge came to the following conclusion at \n\n20:20 … In the end, I accepted the figures submitted by the wife. She\n\n  claimed that she had contributed $884,857.55. The particulars are set out on p 25 of her\n\n  written submissions of 5 March 2001. The husband, on the other hand, contributed the sum\n\n  of $123,970.91 from his CPF a/c, which I agree, is part of the matrimonial assets to which\n\n  the wife is entitled to a share. Her direct contributions totalled 87.7%.In our judgment, the judge was fully justified in making this finding,\n\nand we agreed with him entirely.",
        "Indirect contributions": "18.    It is not disputed that the appellant made\n\nsubstantial contributions to the welfare of the family and the marriage. The parties were\n\nmarried for some 30 years, although during the last 7 years they lived apart. Since 1978,\n\nthe appellant stayed at home, looked after the children and worked as a private tutor.\n\nLater, she took in boarders to supplement her income. The three children were brought up\n\nmainly by the appellant. The respondent for a great part of the time was an\n\n‘absentee’ husband and father. The evidence showed that he had not been a\n\nresponsible husband and father. The appellant maintained herself and the children for the\n\ngreater part of the marriage before she sought a maintenance order from the court in 1990.\n\nThe appellant with her children has been living at the apartment and looking after it\n\nsince its purchase.19.    In the early days of their marriage, the\n\nappellant gave the respondent substantial help in his business without getting anything in\n\nreturn. Such help included giving the respondent financial assistance to set up his\n\ngarment business under the name of International Industrial Trading Company, and giving up\n\nher job to work for the respondent from 1969 to 1977 without any salary or payment. While\n\nshe was working in his factory, she also ‘invented’ a new management method\n\ncalled the ‘Colour Dotted Management Method’ which boosted the productivity of\n\nthe factory. When the respondent was in Indonesia and requested for her help, she went\n\nover there to help him implement the management method in a factory, of which he was in\n\ncharge. That increased the productivity of the factory and saved him his job.",
        "The respondent’s assets": "20.    There were other assets which the respondent must\n\nhave acquired during the marriage and these assets did not appear to have been taken into\n\naccount in the division. These include the respondent’s CPF account (apart from the\n\namounts withdrawn for payment of the flat) and his business assets which he must have\n\naccumulated over the past thirty years. The respondent appeared to have settled in South\n\nAfrica and was quite secretive in his business activities there. The judge in the High\n\nCourt did not accept that he had no assets. Nor did we.",
        "Division": "21.\n\n    The judge did consider whether he should give to the appellant the\n\nentire matrimonial home but refrained from so doing on account of the respondent’s\n\ncontributions, direct and indirect. He said at  20:In view of the wife’s substantial indirect contributions to the\n\n  accumulation of the matrimonial assets, I was sorely tempted to accede to her request that\n\n  I award her the entire flat and order him to repay his own CPF, as it would mean that he\n\n  would immediately take out the bulk of it since he is past 55 years old. But I did not do\n\n  so because it would be out of line with an objective view of the facts. He was not totally\n\n  derelict. He did pay for half of the daughter’s education. Though under compulsion,\n\n  he did pay maintenance. He did give money to his son when the latter was in need. He had\n\n  made some contributions. I felt I would fall in error in awarding him no share in the\n\n  matrimonial flat. I therefore awarded him 20% of the net proceeds of sale. The other terms\n\n  of my order are set out in an order which I approved.22.    With respect, we were unable to agree with the\n\njudge. In the circumstances of this case, an order awarding her the entire apartment would\n\nnot be out of line. There were ample grounds for such an order.23.    As the judge found and we agreed, the direct\n\nfinancial contributions made by the parties towards the acquisition of the flat were as\n\nfollows: 87.7% thereof by the appellant, and 12.3% by the respondent. In addition, there\n\nwere the indirect contributions made by the parties. It is not disputed that the indirect\n\ncontributions made by the appellant were truly substantial. She shouldered the burden of\n\nmaintaining the family for the greater part of the marriage, and worked long hours to\n\nprovide financial means and support for herself and the children. She took on the task of\n\nbring up the children single-handedly. In the course of so doing, she incurred substantial\n\ndebts for the joint benefit of herself and the family and would have to discharge these\n\ndebts herself. During the earlier part of the marriage, she rendered substantial help to\n\nthe respondent’s business without getting anything in return.24.    It is true that the respondent did pay for half\n\nof his daughter’s university education and his sons’ education at the\n\npolytechnic. But, in our view, these contributions were quite insignificant compared to\n\nthe total contributions made by the appellant to the welfare of the family. The respondent\n\nwas absent during a substantial part of the marriage: he was in Indonesia during the\n\nperiod between 1982 and 1986, and during that period he did not provide any maintenance\n\nfor the family. In 1992, he left the family, and while he was away he did not provide any\n\nmaintenance for the family, and only made good the arrears of maintenance later when he\n\nwas compelled to do so. He acted irresponsibly and appeared to have no concern or care for\n\nhis family. The respondent also kept for himself some matrimonial assets, such as the\n\nproceeds from the sale of the assets of the garment business and his own CPF account.\n\nThese and other assets of his should also be taken into account in the division of the\n\nmatrimonial assets.25.\n\n    In the result, at the conclusion of the appeal we had no hesitation in\n\nawarding the entire apartment to the appellant and directing the respondent to repay his\n\nown CPF account, if required, with his own funds. That, in our judgment, was a just and\n\nequitable division of the matrimonial asset between them.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeSgd:L P THEANJudge of AppealSgd:CHAO HICK TINJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
